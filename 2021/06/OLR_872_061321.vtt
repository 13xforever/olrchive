00:00.000 --> 00:24.240
Happy E3 Week! And that's pretty much it. God, this is a lot of time to fill. I hate

00:24.240 --> 00:29.920
saying the same thing over and over, even a year apart. So, that's it! It's E3 Week!

00:31.520 --> 00:35.040
What else is there to say? Let's start the show!

00:41.040 --> 00:49.840
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge

00:49.920 --> 00:57.840
Radio. We've got a lot more to say. We're live once again tonight with episode number 872 of

00:57.840 --> 01:05.280
our show for this June the 13th of 2021. I am Rob Roberts and I am joined via Discord by my co-host,

01:05.280 --> 01:08.480
say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.040
Greetings and salivations.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.080
Hi, how are you doing?

01:12.800 --> 01:19.280
I am okay. I am just going into all of my various Discords and letting them know they should be

01:19.280 --> 01:19.920
listening to us.

01:20.720 --> 01:21.760
Getting that promotion in.

01:22.560 --> 01:23.600
That's what I do.

01:23.600 --> 01:27.040
Speaking of promotion, I probably am not supposed to talk about this on air,

01:27.040 --> 01:31.520
but oops, I'll ask for forgiveness later. But I've been hearing some more DarkSakura tunes.

01:32.080 --> 01:36.000
You sent me one this morning or yesterday and I was like,

01:36.000 --> 01:39.040
when's the album dropping? When's the album dropping?

01:39.040 --> 01:46.240
Well, most of the stuff I'm just doing is loops and I just started playing around with things

01:46.240 --> 01:50.400
yesterday just to kind of futz around with a different style and I was trying to do like

01:50.400 --> 01:55.600
this weird acoustic thing and it turned out like all kinds of Southern rock and my mom really likes

01:55.600 --> 01:59.840
it. So, yay, I guess.

01:59.840 --> 02:07.440
Good. Yeah, I think a lot of people right now are streaming Solar Power by Lorde. But, you know,

02:07.440 --> 02:07.840
in a few weeks...

02:07.840 --> 02:08.480
It's a good song.

02:08.480 --> 02:09.520
Yeah, it's a good song. They're going to be...

02:11.200 --> 02:14.560
This week has been a blessing in music. We had a new Marina album,

02:14.560 --> 02:18.160
we had that Kylie Lady Gaga thing, which is a gift from Gay God.

02:18.880 --> 02:21.520
We had a garbage album.

02:21.520 --> 02:22.080
Your cover.

02:22.640 --> 02:23.140
What's that?

02:23.920 --> 02:27.600
That's not the only cover because someone covered the country Born This Way.

02:27.600 --> 02:30.800
Oh, yeah. Orville Peck did that and then Big Freedia did Judas.

02:30.800 --> 02:33.120
Big Freedia. Yeah, that was so good.

02:33.120 --> 02:36.960
That whole reimagining or whatever is going to be pretty crazy. But yeah,

02:36.960 --> 02:41.760
I was just saying this is a great week for music. So people are satisfied with music for quite some

02:41.760 --> 02:48.960
time. And then, you know, hopefully in a few weeks, well, maybe more like a few months,

02:48.960 --> 02:52.800
we'll have Dark Soccer to add to that list and whatever album she ends up putting out.

02:52.800 --> 02:53.360
No pressure.

02:55.760 --> 03:02.320
No pressure. Hi, chat over at twitch.tv slash Vogue Network. And the chat is commenting that

03:02.320 --> 03:07.600
I look a little out of focus. You know what? I bet the resolution on my camera dropped because OBS

03:07.600 --> 03:14.880
had a small update today. And every time they do that, I see that the camera setting sometimes

03:14.880 --> 03:19.120
reset for Dark Soccer and Loki. Not an issue because we capture them via Discord. So it

03:19.120 --> 03:22.480
doesn't really change. So they're just coming in from Discord. But me, I think mine reset.

03:22.480 --> 03:27.120
So I'll try to fix that. So do not adjust your sets on Twitch. I might get I might have that

03:27.120 --> 03:30.560
whole thing I had last week where I get really big again and all that. But we'll fix all that.

03:31.600 --> 03:32.960
I also want to say your ego.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.560
Rob, Rob, it's just water weight.

03:34.560 --> 03:40.400
Hey, hi, Loki, by the way. The first words out of your mouth tonight are shade. It must be

03:41.440 --> 03:46.800
game convention week, that's for sure. Hey, I want to give a shout out in our chat because I just saw

03:46.800 --> 03:52.720
Black Compat said hi hi in the chat. And I want to say hi hi and grats, grats right back at you,

03:52.720 --> 03:56.480
Black Compat, because and if you don't know Black Compat, you should be following them,

03:56.480 --> 04:02.240
fix that because Black Compat is the artists formerly known as Electric Sistahood, which

04:02.240 --> 04:06.080
was on the VOG network. And we go back our little our little friendship goes back to all games back

04:06.080 --> 04:11.120
in the day and all that. So we've been we've been frenzy's friend shows for a long time. Black

04:11.120 --> 04:16.080
Compat just got the partner. Well, they're not partner yet, but they just applied for partner.

04:16.080 --> 04:20.800
But that means they met the stats and all that measurement for partner. And that's a huge

04:20.800 --> 04:25.280
accomplishment. So I just want to say congrats. And if Twitch doesn't accept you as a partner,

04:25.280 --> 04:31.200
they are dumb. So fingers and toes crossed for you guys. So just want to give that some people

04:31.200 --> 04:35.600
who shouldn't make partner who have made partners. So I will be super pissed.

04:35.600 --> 04:41.680
I saw that Twitch drama this week. That was something. No, I the lovely ladies over at

04:41.680 --> 04:47.600
Black Compat would be a huge win for Twitch. So I hope you listen in Twitch admins. Do it.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.720
Yeah. All right. No Twitch admins are listening to this show.

04:51.920 --> 04:57.680
And also unban my friend. All right. Loki, hi. How are you? How's your week been?

04:58.560 --> 05:02.240
We're pretty good. Yeah. What do you mean up to I see a lot of

05:03.520 --> 05:07.840
pics of the kids. What's what's going on and all that stuff? Do one of the kids have a birthday

05:07.840 --> 05:14.560
this week? No, no, it's my youngest son's graduated from first grade. So he's in now

05:14.560 --> 05:20.960
in second grade. Oh, that's great. Wait a minute. But like, it's OK. So the graduation happened

05:20.960 --> 05:25.280
this week. They didn't they don't start school or is it like a year round school type of thing?

05:26.240 --> 05:30.480
I will. His school's kind of year round, but I mean, honestly, like with the stuff,

05:30.480 --> 05:34.800
they're giving him a third grade work anyways as it is. Oh, wow. I guess he's pretty smart. So

05:37.040 --> 05:40.880
it's just it's kind of all year round. He's always at that school, so they don't really

05:40.880 --> 05:45.600
have a starting end. Let me ask a kind of a weird question, but do you think, you know,

05:45.600 --> 05:49.200
because you mentioned like, oh, the kids smart and getting the more advanced work.

05:49.200 --> 05:53.440
Do you think the fact that you've kind of taught them about programming and I know you've put them

05:53.440 --> 05:57.920
in like the supplemental classes and stuff and well, I don't know if that's it's both your kids

05:57.920 --> 06:04.400
you put in those like Code Ninja classes, right? No, just my oldest son right now.

06:04.400 --> 06:09.200
OK, but but still like there I know they've got to be learning stuff from you and a lot of the

06:09.200 --> 06:14.080
stuff like with Minecraft and all that. Do you think I just because I think about like how we

06:14.080 --> 06:18.320
when we were growing up, video games would give you such a bad rap, right? Like only like,

06:18.320 --> 06:23.200
you know, nerds and deviants played video games and all this stuff. But I think I feel like we're

06:23.200 --> 06:28.000
in a world now where video games are super educational. And I don't I don't just mean I

06:28.000 --> 06:32.320
don't mean like number munchers. We're in the world is Carmen Sandiego. Don't get me wrong.

06:32.320 --> 06:36.400
Those games are phenomenal and a part of our upbringing. But I mean, things like, for example,

06:36.400 --> 06:42.880
this week, big release game builder garage comes out, right? Huge target on teaching kids. I don't

06:42.880 --> 06:49.120
think anybody's going to make the next big video game in game builder garage. But it's a nice

06:49.120 --> 06:55.520
little playroom to learn about logic gating and law. And I think that's a huge skill to teach kids

06:55.520 --> 07:04.640
like if then or and like every industry touches logic, even the work I do, I have to use logic a

07:04.640 --> 07:11.200
lot in my presentation. I work in tech. Exactly. It's all over. So I so that's my very long window

07:11.200 --> 07:18.640
way of asking, do you think the games helped the kid? Yeah, I guess I don't really see him do that

07:18.640 --> 07:23.760
a lot because he's been playing Roblox all the time. But OK, but that's another example in a

07:23.760 --> 07:30.320
way. And actually to that, he's actually going to be doing a so they have the code ninjas like

07:30.320 --> 07:35.440
regular stuff. And then he's got a they have this summer camps that they run. So they have different

07:35.440 --> 07:41.120
specialized things. And so he's actually doing a Roblox one in like a week here. So he'll be

07:41.120 --> 07:45.440
learning how to make stuff for that. So I think that'll be a little bit better. But yeah, he's

07:45.440 --> 07:53.920
already moving on to the next belt here pretty soon, which I think they switched to Lua instead

07:53.920 --> 08:03.280
of JavaScript. I don't know. That's what it is right now. But yeah, I mean, I don't know. He's

08:03.280 --> 08:09.360
not he does it on the side, like independently, but he doesn't use like scratch, for example,

08:09.360 --> 08:16.160
to make games right now. He's using it to make animations. So, you know, he's having fun with

08:16.160 --> 08:22.480
that. But yeah, I'm sure that'll come down, you know, later on, once he kind of gets a bigger

08:22.480 --> 08:29.360
idea of like what to do with it. It'll definitely help him. Yeah. Did you pick up on the topic of

08:29.360 --> 08:34.560
that? Yeah. Game Builder Garage. I did pick it up. So my youngest son is playing that.

08:34.560 --> 08:38.560
And so he showed me like this tag game he made the other day, which I think is just part of the

08:38.560 --> 08:44.240
tutorial, but like that you like has a two player game where one person has to try to tag you. And

08:44.240 --> 08:49.200
if they tag you hit with something, then you lose or something like that. So it's pretty cool.

08:51.360 --> 08:55.760
Yeah, I got to check out the demo for that still. And at some point, I feel like I might get the

08:55.760 --> 09:00.080
full game. I almost want to just get the game to play other people's games like that. That's

09:00.080 --> 09:06.080
the best part of Mario Maker to me, honestly. So our little big planet or, you know, we have to

09:06.080 --> 09:10.800
pick up dreams, you know, that that's something that dreams has been on a deep cut sale recently,

09:10.800 --> 09:15.520
too. Somebody in chat earlier was saying they got it for 999. So that game's Yeah, it's I don't know

09:15.520 --> 09:19.520
if that's right now, or if that was a few weeks ago, but I'm sure there's a lot of sales going on

09:19.520 --> 09:25.360
this week, for sure. So check that out. Anyway, um, it's a huge week in gaming, right? This is,

09:25.360 --> 09:29.040
you know, as Jason was kind of tongue in cheek alluding to in the intro, which I love that.

09:29.040 --> 09:34.640
It's, you know, E3 week and this is an interesting year because we're in the middle of E3. Most years

09:34.640 --> 09:39.680
I think last year was like this too. But most years, E3 is like a Tuesday, Wednesday,

09:39.680 --> 09:43.600
Thursday sort of thing because E3 really is supposed to be a trade show. It's for people

09:43.600 --> 09:47.520
that are in the industry. It's for people. It's working, you know, so it's during work time,

09:48.240 --> 09:52.240
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, with Monday being set up and Friday being tear down and travel home

09:52.240 --> 09:57.600
and all that good stuff. So having this kind of like right in the middle where we're kind of right

09:57.600 --> 10:02.080
in the middle of E3 week when we're doing our show Sunday night is a little interesting and a little

10:02.080 --> 10:08.160
different. But obviously it's not just E3 because obviously with everything that's been going on in

10:08.160 --> 10:12.640
the world, with all the changes that have been going on in E3, we've seen some other deviations.

10:12.640 --> 10:17.120
We've seen indies that are kind of putting together their own thing. And of course we have,

10:17.120 --> 10:22.160
I think the first recap we want to get into a little bit, Jeff Keighley's Summer Game Fest,

10:22.160 --> 10:28.000
which was the first event, media event. They're not really press conferences anymore. I keep

10:28.000 --> 10:32.400
wanting like my old brain that's been doing the show for 19 years and covering E3 for a long time

10:32.400 --> 10:35.120
wants to keep saying press conference, press conference. That's not really what they are now,

10:35.120 --> 10:39.440
especially in the age of COVID. They're digital media showcases, basically, or digital media

10:39.440 --> 10:45.680
events. So the first big event we had was the Summer Game Fest event on Thursday, right in the

10:45.680 --> 10:51.200
middle of the workday. So I unfortunately was not going to be able to watch it, but then get this,

10:51.920 --> 10:58.800
our VPN at work went down for like an hour. So I had time to watch it and I didn't do it.

10:58.800 --> 11:03.120
I didn't do it. I didn't hack it. Maybe somebody else at work did something. No,

11:03.120 --> 11:09.280
it's just, I think just lucky timing, I guess. So I kind of got to watch that a little bit. I mean,

11:09.280 --> 11:13.680
I kind of, work came back up partway through, so I had to kind of multitask. But I did get to see

11:13.680 --> 11:18.480
it live, which I didn't think I'd originally be able to. Thoughts overall. Let's start.

11:18.480 --> 11:22.960
Loki, I know you'll kind of touch on everything, but how was your feeling overall of the Summer

11:22.960 --> 11:28.160
Game Fest? Especially because I think that type of announcement was kind of new. I know we had

11:28.160 --> 11:32.960
Summer Game Fest last year, but it was like this big four month nebulous thing. And I feel like

11:32.960 --> 11:40.400
this was a different type of, it's like Jeff and Friends own digital media event outside of the big

11:40.400 --> 11:44.080
ones. And it was interesting. There were some high points for me and some low points for me.

11:44.080 --> 11:47.840
But Loki, I'll start with you. What were some of the high points for you and the low points for you?

11:48.880 --> 11:53.120
I'm trying to, gosh, like that's the problem with E3 and all these different events is everything

11:53.120 --> 11:58.080
starts bleeding into each other. Like I don't remember what was announced there versus what

11:58.080 --> 12:04.800
was announced, you know, other places. I mean, was the one from Software Game looks cool,

12:04.800 --> 12:11.440
even though it's a game I'm never going to play it. But it looks cool. I'm trying to think if

12:11.440 --> 12:17.280
there's anything like really exciting that they announced there that other than that, that I don't

12:17.280 --> 12:22.400
know, honestly, like the Xbox stuff, like some of these smaller indie games look really, really

12:22.400 --> 12:27.760
good. Like I'm trying to think of some of the examples here, but like there is like some like

12:27.760 --> 12:34.880
2D looking games that they have that just absolutely just gorgeous. Yeah. But I think

12:34.880 --> 12:39.360
those are more interesting than some of these bigger games almost. Well, let's talk about the

12:39.360 --> 12:44.160
big ones. So the grand finale at the end of the whole thing was Elden Ring. I'm not sure

12:44.160 --> 12:47.840
personally how I kind of feel about this game. Like I understand there's a lot of people very

12:47.840 --> 12:53.280
hyped for this game, but I'm also, I'm not big on Game of Thrones like a lot of people. Sorry. I

12:53.280 --> 12:58.240
just, you know, I play so many games. I've fallen behind on my TV. So I never really got into that.

12:58.240 --> 13:04.160
So the George R.R. Martin thing. Yeah. Evil Dead. That was something that looked pretty cool.

13:04.800 --> 13:10.800
Okay. I like Evil Dead. But Elden Ring. So there's, you know, the trailer and I'm just,

13:10.800 --> 13:15.040
I'm not super into the Souls game, but then I think about my husband, Alan, he loves Dark

13:15.040 --> 13:20.880
Souls and he's played Dark Souls. He's platinumed Dark Souls. That is, that is a gaming flex right

13:20.880 --> 13:25.200
there to have the, well, I'm sorry, the Steam equivalent of platinum, but he has every

13:25.200 --> 13:30.080
achievement or whatever. So he's, he's done that on Dark Souls. I think he's done it on Dark Souls

13:30.080 --> 13:34.960
too. And I think oddly enough, he hasn't really completed Dark Souls 3. I guess there's something

13:34.960 --> 13:39.600
about it that is different or whatever. So I think he might be more into that sort of thing,

13:39.600 --> 13:44.640
but I, for me, I'm just kind of like, it looks pretty. I'm like, this is eye candy,

13:44.640 --> 13:49.440
like left and right. You know, we're really seeing the potential of the systems, but I otherwise was

13:49.440 --> 13:55.440
just kind of like, all right, cool for the people that are into Souls games. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

13:56.240 --> 14:01.120
And I do see some excitement in her chat also. Uh, Ninja the monkey in chat says Elden Ring,

14:01.120 --> 14:06.160
finally. Uh, we also have a Quest Buster is reminding, um, also the Elden Ring trailer.

14:06.240 --> 14:09.600
I want to get this comment out too, because Bobby says, uh, Bobby Blackwell says,

14:09.600 --> 14:14.000
this was the game awards without the awards. Yeah, it absolutely was. It was, uh, you know,

14:14.000 --> 14:19.040
just kind of just the announcement part of it. I'll tell you one announcement that surprised me

14:19.040 --> 14:24.880
that I was into was the, uh, the first or second one. It was the, uh, tiny Tina borderlands.

14:24.880 --> 14:29.440
Yeah, the wonderlands. I was, yeah, that's it. Tiny Tina wonderlands. I was actually kind of

14:29.440 --> 14:33.680
into it because, uh, when I saw it was gearbox and 2k and all that. And then there should,

14:33.680 --> 14:38.000
at first I was like, okay, Oh God, is this going to be a fart joke game? Like when they,

14:38.000 --> 14:41.200
when they were kind of announcing some of those comment comics in it, I was like,

14:41.200 --> 14:45.680
it's going to be a fart joke game, but then Wanda Sykes was one of the comments. And I was like,

14:45.680 --> 14:50.400
okay, Wanda Sykes is amazing. And she can tell all the fart jokes she wants. I will,

14:50.400 --> 14:57.120
I'll check it out for her. Cause I, I, I, I just love the way she talks. Like I just, I she's like,

14:57.120 --> 15:02.800
just hearing her tell a story is hilarious. Her standup albums. And I listened to them

15:02.880 --> 15:08.560
every so often. Yeah. No. And, and, and somebody has a delivery. I just know, I know there's been

15:08.560 --> 15:13.360
that meme around Facebook. Like who would narrate the book on tape of your life? And I've always

15:13.360 --> 15:18.480
said Wanda Sykes because she's so funny and my life's pretty funny. I can see that. Yeah. So,

15:18.480 --> 15:27.280
um, so I know who I would want to narrate mine. Who actually it's a streamer. Oh, kill cannon.

15:27.280 --> 15:31.200
Okay. Okay. It was just narrate my life. Have you listened to this man's voice?

15:31.200 --> 15:35.760
Uh, I, I have, but I'm only a little bit, so I'm like having trouble recalling it

15:35.760 --> 15:39.680
in my mind. Oh my God. He's got such a nice voice. I thought you were going to see,

15:39.680 --> 15:43.280
I thought you were going to say LC at first and I can definitely hear their voice in my head. You

15:43.280 --> 15:50.800
know, got them. I can definitely hear that. We love to see, um, no, I, I went kill cannon to

15:50.800 --> 15:56.000
narrate my life just because I would, I would follow sleep to that, to those soothing tones.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.360
Uh, low key. Why not? Let's finish the trifecta. Who would narrate your autobiography or whatever,

16:01.360 --> 16:09.200
uh, with the book on tape version? Um, Ryan Reynolds. Oh God, that is such the heterosexual

16:09.200 --> 16:15.360
answer. I love that. All right. He's snarky. It's the snark that I'm attracted to.

16:16.800 --> 16:24.240
You have a little man crush. Well, and he showed up. Okay. Tying it back. He showed up at the

16:24.240 --> 16:29.040
summer game fest thing too, with that trailer for the movie. I'm excited about that movie.

16:29.040 --> 16:33.680
Actually, I know who else I would choose and that would be Emma Stone, but as Cruella.

16:34.480 --> 16:39.040
Oh, okay. Love that. I need to see it. I need to see it. Rob, we should go see it.

16:39.040 --> 16:44.160
I think we should. I haven't been to a theater in, since, uh, I don't, I literally don't remember

16:44.160 --> 16:48.640
the last time I was in a movie theater. Let's have a friend date. Are we gonna have a friend date?

16:48.640 --> 16:53.760
Oh my God. Can we, can we have a friend date and then we're going to get one popcorn and share it

16:53.760 --> 17:00.640
and maybe our hands will awkwardly touch. Let's do it. Okay. All right. Let's do it.

17:02.480 --> 17:07.600
Okay. Uh, let's see. Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says, William Shatner. I understand that,

17:07.600 --> 17:13.680
but William Shatner is kind of an asshole. Um, and yeah, anyway, I'm going to just tell that

17:13.680 --> 17:19.120
story another day. Um, let's see evil, uh, ether VL and chat says Morgan Freeman. Oh,

17:19.120 --> 17:24.560
that's a good one too. All right. Morgan Freeman's the one that's like the meme

17:24.560 --> 17:30.560
version of that. I will just have corpse husband do it. I love that. Bobby Black Wolf says someone

17:30.560 --> 17:35.760
doing William Shatner's voice then. Perfect. Perfect. It's like, it's like, uh, it's not

17:35.760 --> 17:41.840
Johnny Depp as, uh, captain Jack Sparrow. It's somebody else doing captain Jack Sparrow.

17:41.840 --> 17:47.440
Why not just have, um, Patrick Stewart narrate your life? Oh, that's a good one. That's a good

17:47.440 --> 17:54.880
one. Anyway. All right. Look back to the, uh, so tiny Tina's wonderlands. I was into it because

17:54.880 --> 18:00.640
I was like, Oh my God, if they made borderlands a high fantasy game, I'm kind of all about that.

18:00.640 --> 18:05.920
That sounds like it'd be a lot of fun. Yeah. So I think that might've been my favorite thing,

18:05.920 --> 18:12.080
believe it or not that I saw. I found some games that looked interesting to me, although I am

18:12.080 --> 18:18.000
super, super pissed about star Lord, the game house. Oh, the, the one they were talking about

18:18.000 --> 18:25.040
today. Yeah. Well, we'll get into that later. Yeah. But I'm also interested in that, um,

18:25.040 --> 18:29.440
avatar game. Cause I freaking love the avatar universe. You're jumping way ahead.

18:29.440 --> 18:33.600
That's all I'm jumping ahead, but those are what I'm excited about. A lot of people have

18:33.600 --> 18:36.560
their feelings. All right. This week we'll get to, we'll get to the avatar thing in the next

18:36.560 --> 18:43.040
segment. Um, so, uh, the other announcements. Okay. The death stranding director's cut. What

18:43.040 --> 18:47.920
are your, what are your like? Cause, so it was, um, you know, it was totally obvious too. Jeff

18:47.920 --> 18:55.040
Keeley is like, I've got a friend here. That's gonna talk to, it's just like, Oh my God. Like

18:55.040 --> 18:59.280
you and Hideo Kojima have like such a bromance. Like it's so obvious. Like your crush is so

18:59.280 --> 19:05.200
obvious. Jeff. Like, I feel like if I looked at Jeff binder, Jeff's binder, it would say

19:05.200 --> 19:12.480
Mr. Jeff Kojima, Mr. Jeff Kojima all over it. Like your crush is so obvious, but there's a box.

19:13.200 --> 19:16.560
Yeah. Well, okay. Did you, did you see that trailer? Cause it was pretty funny

19:16.560 --> 19:21.680
because at first, you know, I was like, wait a minute, is this a different game in the death

19:21.680 --> 19:26.400
stranding engine? Because that was the vibe I got at first and I was like into it. I was like, Oh,

19:26.400 --> 19:31.200
they're going to meet. But then it was like, kind of like self parody. It was like Kojima's

19:31.680 --> 19:37.040
colliding for the thing. Yeah. Oh no. And then it ended up. Yeah. It was definitely like a special

19:37.040 --> 19:41.040
thing for the event. It's like, how much can they really, I mean, I guess they can milk it forever

19:41.040 --> 19:48.800
for, um, mill your solid, but I thought it was like VR missions, I guess for, um, death stranding.

19:48.800 --> 19:52.800
Yeah. But also how are you going to crawl through an event with all that stuff on your backpack?

19:52.800 --> 19:58.720
I mean, that's just physically impossible. You can't be stealthy carrying around like

19:58.720 --> 20:05.280
20 stacked packages on your back. Yeah. A 50 foot tall package stack on your back. Um,

20:05.280 --> 20:10.000
Questbuster in chat says, I thought the same. I thought he was hinting towards some new expansion

20:10.000 --> 20:13.680
or something for death stranding. That's what I kind of got the vibe at too. I was like, Oh,

20:13.680 --> 20:18.720
maybe like an expansion. Like my, my brain went to the final fantasy seven remake and the inner and

20:18.720 --> 20:22.640
the integrate and the Yuffie thing that all happened just this week as well. Um, and I

20:22.640 --> 20:25.760
thought maybe that's what was happening for death stranding. And I guess when they say director's

20:25.760 --> 20:31.040
cut, I would assume that's what it is. Like, wouldn't a director's cut be adding stuff in.

20:31.040 --> 20:36.640
Isn't that what a director's cut does? It would be adding things that were intended to be in.

20:36.640 --> 20:42.000
Yeah. Yeah. We really just wanted to put mill gear into death stranding completely.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.560
I don't think any of that is actually in the game. I think that was all just a big joke for the

20:46.560 --> 20:52.800
reveal, but it's interesting. I did. You know what though? At the end of the day, I, and I, I say,

20:52.800 --> 20:59.920
I did love death stranding, even if I didn't beat it, because I think it came out at the re that

20:59.920 --> 21:04.800
game's release is so interesting because I think it came out at the right time and the wrong time.

21:04.800 --> 21:10.720
I think it came out at the right time because what a, I don't even know the word for it. What

21:10.720 --> 21:18.240
a poetic piece, I guess on COVID without exactly. Right. It came out. It just is. I mean,

21:19.200 --> 21:24.480
yeah, we had animal crossing as the perfect release, but death stranding also really had

21:24.480 --> 21:29.040
that parallel going on and it wasn't even intentional. Right. But then for me, that also

21:29.040 --> 21:35.440
made it a bad thing because for me and like, you know, you know, as an extrovert, I've been having

21:35.440 --> 21:41.680
a very hard time these last 50 months. So for me, it was almost like too much for me, like mentally.

21:41.680 --> 21:47.520
And I was, and for that reason, I was more drawn to the cute little animal friendships and my BFF

21:47.920 --> 21:51.040
catch up and all that stuff at animal crossing instead, which I still need to give you your

21:51.040 --> 21:56.720
catch up. Yay. All right. Can she come on the date to the movie? Yeah, she can come on the date to

21:56.720 --> 22:02.320
the movie. Okay. Yay. Quest Buster in chat says I enjoyed death stranding. It was different and

22:02.320 --> 22:07.760
it was kind of fun co-oping and road building with shared resource donations. Also zip line

22:07.760 --> 22:13.760
networks for the win. Yeah, absolutely. So I I'll, I'll, I'll check it. I don't have a PS five yet,

22:13.760 --> 22:17.440
but I imagine by the time I get one, the director's cut will be down in price a little

22:17.440 --> 22:21.600
bit. So I'll probably still check it out. I'll double dip. Why not? I guess I'm the problem.

22:22.240 --> 22:26.400
Is it only on PlayStation five? Are they doing like, um, the PC version as well?

22:26.400 --> 22:31.840
I guess they didn't say my assumption was a PS five thing, but you ask a good question.

22:33.680 --> 22:39.920
It probably is the only piece, but I don't know. PC's a decent guess. Um, did you know your webcam

22:40.000 --> 22:45.040
died? Loki. I'm sure Jamie because I'm eating ice cream. It's okay. I'm like, I'm talking to,

22:45.040 --> 22:50.000
I'm talking to two dots right now. No, it's all good. It's all good. Sorry. It's my wife got me

22:50.000 --> 22:56.960
vampire penguin. So like, you know, it's, uh, it's fine. You can show us ice cream, Loki. It's okay.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.240
Okay. See? Yeah, I'm okay with that. All right. Anyway. Uh, what else, what else do we miss from

23:02.240 --> 23:06.160
summer game Fest though? If you can take a break between bites to remind me of the things I'm

23:06.160 --> 23:10.800
missing. Oh gosh. I'm trying to remember all the different things they announced. Um,

23:11.440 --> 23:16.560
lots of Netflix stuff. Like I'm kind of curious. I mean, I don't know, like I'm curious about the,

23:16.560 --> 23:21.520
the blood dragon inspired thing. Although what they showed, like,

23:22.080 --> 23:26.400
doesn't resemble blood dragon, like blood dragons, like just very tongue in cheek,

23:26.400 --> 23:32.880
you know, spoof of all eighties actions stuff with like a ton of like neon synthwave stuff.

23:33.680 --> 23:39.280
And the guy that's doing it, I like his fan films that he puts out the unofficial,

23:39.280 --> 23:44.960
like bootleg films or whatever. Um, I just don't see it. I mean, it looks like a pretty

23:44.960 --> 23:50.080
cool animated thing, but like, it's just not, it's not blood dragon. I don't know.

23:50.080 --> 23:54.640
Okay. I have, I'll check it out. I have a list of a few things to remind myself, um,

23:54.640 --> 24:00.560
of what was announced at the summer game Fest. Um, uh, a near automatic crossover with fall guys

24:00.640 --> 24:04.640
and that to be costume for fall guys. That was kind of funny. I thought of act deaf because I

24:04.640 --> 24:10.800
know he's a fan of that game. Um, the two point campus. So that's one of those SIM games. That's

24:10.800 --> 24:16.000
that whole SIM universe that a two point hospital. Yeah, exactly. So two point campus. And that

24:16.000 --> 24:20.640
looked a little batshit crazy, but I also know that like, I know dark soccer loves those SIM

24:20.640 --> 24:24.000
type games. So I kind of was like, oh, maybe that'd be something that she's into. Well,

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
not to say I'm not into him. I might check it out. Um, it just looked a little batshit crazy

24:28.000 --> 24:31.360
to me, like almost like there was too much going on in that game. You know,

24:31.360 --> 24:36.560
but I think that's the appeal of that series is that they're a little bit, uh, tongue in cheek,

24:36.560 --> 24:41.920
so to speak. Yeah. You couldn't do your, was it your magicians campus or something like that?

24:42.960 --> 24:48.720
Interesting. Um, the also, I thought this was a very strange time to announce this whole, like,

24:48.720 --> 24:53.680
we've got a new gaming label and that was a big thing they got into there was that there was,

24:53.680 --> 24:58.240
uh, that prime matter where payday three Kings bounty two, the new painkiller game.

24:58.240 --> 25:01.760
So they kind of had a bunch of like rapid fire stuff in there. Um, that was interesting that

25:01.760 --> 25:05.440
they use that opportunity to say we're launching a new label. I thought that was a little weird,

25:05.440 --> 25:11.200
but I mean, not like bad weird, but just like, just kind of weird, weird. So anyway. Um, and

25:11.200 --> 25:18.240
then there were some other ones too. There's, um, uh, Jurassic world evolution too. They

25:18.240 --> 25:22.160
have played the first one, but it looked interesting. I don't know. Maybe I'd be

25:22.160 --> 25:28.320
more interested when the movie comes up. Sorry. Alan is texting me from target. My favorite place

25:28.320 --> 25:34.160
and like, uh, do you want this? Do you want this? Um, okay. Um, yeah, I, I forgot. Okay.

25:34.160 --> 25:38.880
Here's the thing. I forgot there was even a drastic world evolution one until, and then

25:38.880 --> 25:42.320
when they played that trailer, I was like, Ooh, this looks really pretty. What is this? And then

25:42.320 --> 25:46.400
they were like, it's evolution too. And I was like, Oh yeah, I forgot that that was a thing.

25:46.400 --> 25:51.520
So maybe that's a series I need to check out. I don't know. Um, and then there was one more

25:51.520 --> 25:55.120
and I was hoping Dar Sakura would be back for this, but, um, that's all right. I can ask her

25:55.120 --> 26:00.800
later, but there was that metal slug tactics game that was kind of interesting. Yeah. It's

26:00.800 --> 26:05.280
kind of our left field there, but it looked interesting. Yeah, for sure. So I thought that

26:05.280 --> 26:10.160
was a little bit weird that that, um, showed up. I also, I think the tactics thing has been a mobile

26:10.160 --> 26:17.920
game before, but like all I wanted though from that is like very, they had this anime intro type

26:17.920 --> 26:24.240
thing to it. I'm like, I want a metal slug anime now. Not necessarily like, uh, the tactics game

26:24.240 --> 26:31.120
is fine, but it's like, I'll take the anime, please. Um, can that come to Netflix? So,

26:32.800 --> 26:37.680
yeah. So overall I thought the summer game Fest thing, it was fine. There were some decent

26:37.680 --> 26:45.120
announcements, but I did think it ran a little long for what they had in it. Um, there were some

26:45.120 --> 26:49.200
nice, like, you know, they had like the Weezer thing and the, actually that first musical

26:49.200 --> 26:53.680
performance was the best one. And I, I'm so sorry, I forgot her name or the game that it was

26:53.680 --> 26:57.520
promoting, which is terrible. But all I remember is that I really liked that performance that was

26:57.520 --> 27:02.080
better than the Weezer thing to me. Um, somebody in chat, please help me out here. Um, but if you

27:02.080 --> 27:07.280
want to talk about music to stream, that was really cute. I have that weird tie-in with that boat,

27:07.280 --> 27:12.480
like gateboarding game. Well, that game looked cute for sure. Yeah, it's cute. It's just like,

27:12.480 --> 27:18.880
like, this is so random that this is tied in with the game, but okay. Yeah. Yeah. Um, gosh,

27:18.880 --> 27:22.080
now it's bugging me. I can't remember the name of the artist, like butterfly something, butterfly

27:22.080 --> 27:26.880
garden. I can't remember. Shucks. Uh, hopefully somebody in chat will help me out here in a

27:26.880 --> 27:32.800
moment. Um, but yeah, that was the, uh, the musical performance I liked. Thank you. Okay. Wow. I

27:32.800 --> 27:37.040
messed up the name completely. Mike Deff said it was Japanese breakfast. Where the hell did I get

27:37.120 --> 27:42.480
butterfly garden from? Was that the name of the song maybe? Or am I just, am I just at the point

27:42.480 --> 27:47.120
where I'm just straight up making shit up? All right. Butterflies and gardens. Apparently,

27:47.120 --> 27:50.880
apparently I'm thinking of a nice, so Japanese breakfast was the name of the artist. That does

27:50.880 --> 27:55.840
sound right now that you're saying that. So, um, that was, uh, that was great. All right. Um,

27:55.840 --> 28:01.680
let's move on. Let's talk about the next, uh, uh, media event, which was Ubisoft's event.

28:01.680 --> 28:06.320
So the Ubisoft forward event happened. Um, I actually don't think any of us were able

28:06.320 --> 28:10.800
to catch it live. We only caught kind of the headlines, but let me kick it back over to dark

28:10.800 --> 28:15.120
soccer because you had brought up the avatar game. Um, and I know this was a big thing that

28:15.120 --> 28:20.800
Ubisoft announced. And a lot of the reaction I saw online to this was, well, this game's about

28:20.800 --> 28:26.240
10 years too late, but I don't think so. I don't think so either. Cause if you've got those sequel

28:26.240 --> 28:31.280
at like, wasn't the first sequel supposed to be this year, but then COVID. Yeah. I think

28:31.760 --> 28:36.720
the new avatar movie is coming out. Yeah. So, so this is perfectly right. I think that people have

28:36.720 --> 28:41.760
allowed themselves to forget. Yeah. I think you're right. But our soccer, I know you were a big fan

28:41.760 --> 28:44.880
of the movie and the lore and all that stuff. What, what do you, what did you think about

28:44.880 --> 28:49.520
hearing about this new game? Um, I would have liked to have seen more about it,

28:49.520 --> 28:56.880
but it looks really pretty and I'm interested in this snow drop engine. Um, uh, I think that

28:56.880 --> 29:00.320
it would, you know, once I see a little bit more about it, you know, depending on like

29:00.960 --> 29:06.720
character customization, what the story's going to be, it just still makes me think I would like a,

29:06.720 --> 29:13.440
um, uh, an MMO in that universe. I would play an MMO in that universe in a heartbeat.

29:14.320 --> 29:19.760
And I think it's also, it's an avatar game is also a good, um, chance to kind of reintroduce

29:19.760 --> 29:24.640
avatar to, uh, the world. Cause it has been a little while since that first movie.

29:24.640 --> 29:29.520
And I think there's a lot of pressure on those sequels to perform very well because that first,

29:29.520 --> 29:34.240
you know, movie is like the biggest motion picture of all time, if I'm not mistaken, right? Yeah.

29:34.240 --> 29:38.880
So, I mean, absolutely. So there's a lot of pressure on those sequels to do very well.

29:38.880 --> 29:42.960
And so I think in order to help that they kind of need to bring avatar back into

29:42.960 --> 29:48.160
that pop culture consciousness, if that makes sense. Um, totally. That's what they need to do.

29:48.160 --> 29:53.200
And the, um, Disney stuff at Orlando is a part of that too, right? Cause they just opened the

29:53.200 --> 29:57.360
Pandora thing at is the animal kingdom or one of those parks down there. They opened the whole

29:57.360 --> 30:02.400
Pandora's world there and that's a big deal. Uh, apparently it's really well done. Yeah. So.

30:03.680 --> 30:08.400
It's I just, I was watching the trailer and I've watched it a couple of times. It just seems

30:08.400 --> 30:14.800
really like that was one of the few things that really grabbed me out of the stuff I was able to

30:14.800 --> 30:21.200
see. Um, going into chat, a Zen monkey says avatar got beat by infinity war end game. I think did it.

30:21.200 --> 30:25.440
I thought they did a rerelease of avatar that put it, but I could be wrong. I don't, but

30:26.160 --> 30:31.200
either way shenanigans at one point, but I think they re-released it in theaters again. So that's

30:31.200 --> 30:37.040
why it's like, it's back all that stuff aside. It still doesn't negate the point that those

30:37.040 --> 30:42.000
sequels are under tremendous pressure to do well because the first movie did so well. Um,

30:42.000 --> 30:45.680
see a Tiberian chat says they could always cancel sequels like they did divergent. Well,

30:45.680 --> 30:48.640
they're not going to do that because they've already filmed at least two of them, right?

30:48.640 --> 30:52.960
Like isn't a James Cameron filming like four of them, like back to back to back,

30:52.960 --> 30:58.400
like not taking a break. Yeah. It's, it's seems like it's a lot like when we get a sequel,

30:58.400 --> 31:01.840
we're getting sequels. There's going to be a whole Cameron. So, you know,

31:01.840 --> 31:08.800
he's going to go through it anyway. Yeah, for sure. Um, so yeah. Uh, crystal, uh, crystal,

31:09.600 --> 31:14.480
why can't I talk today? Crystal skies in chat says, yeah, two of them are already filmed.

31:14.480 --> 31:18.080
I thought that's what I'd heard too. Cause I, I remember there was talk about Sigourney Weaver

31:18.080 --> 31:22.080
being in them and all that, which made me go, didn't well, you know, I don't, I don't want,

31:22.080 --> 31:27.120
but you know, everyone lives through the tree. How is she in it? Okay. So, Oh, wow. They have

31:27.120 --> 31:32.320
an entire city built in New Zealand. Well, that's the place to film it. I'm sure that's going to be

31:32.320 --> 31:36.880
interesting. So anyway. Um, so, okay. Yeah. So the game is happening and I'm sure the game is going

31:36.880 --> 31:42.880
to be, um, um, uh, pretty, pretty big undertaking as well. Um, let's see, what else did we miss at

31:42.880 --> 31:49.200
the Ubisoft event? Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So that whole thing's getting a sequel, which is, uh,

31:49.200 --> 31:55.440
pretty exciting. What do you think about that? It looks deep. I played a little bit of the first

31:55.440 --> 32:00.560
one. I know my kids played more of it, but yeah, it looks cool. Um, I just, I like how Nintendo

32:00.560 --> 32:05.920
leaked that. Yeah. Uh, it just came to my mind, of course, my, my music game roots are very excited

32:05.920 --> 32:10.960
to hear about this, that rock Smith is making a comeback. Um, so, but it's, it's this whole rock

32:10.960 --> 32:16.080
Smith port for a while though they did, but now there's a whole new thing coming out. There's this

32:16.080 --> 32:20.720
rock Smith plus that's coming out. Um, that is going to help you learn how to play guitar. And

32:20.720 --> 32:24.800
I think they're actually like teaming up with like guitar schools and this whole thing. And there's

32:24.800 --> 32:29.760
like a special guitar and all this stuff. So, uh, it's kind of neat to see that that series is still

32:29.760 --> 32:35.280
going on. Yeah. Uh, there's going to be a mobile app and a workshop in the game. So it's like,

32:35.280 --> 32:41.120
Hey, please buy more stuff for us. Yeah. Real time feedback. That's, that's pretty cool. How like,

32:41.120 --> 32:45.120
you know, the whole like learning through a game thing is really going to the next level. That's

32:45.120 --> 32:52.640
for sure. Wasn't that what Exeter was doing for a bit? Um, you, you, well, he was playing that

32:52.640 --> 32:58.960
game a lot. Yes. He was trying to learn how to play through it. Absolutely. So, um, let's see

32:58.960 --> 33:03.120
some other things that they taught. They talked a lot about rainbow six, um, which I know is a

33:03.120 --> 33:07.360
huge series, just not one that I am super into, but I know they spend a lot of time on that.

33:07.360 --> 33:12.960
They're getting cross play, uh, cross progression with PC. You know, there's a new Just Dance game.

33:12.960 --> 33:18.320
Who's excited about that? That's coming out too. Of course they had to do that. Uh, a new kind of

33:18.320 --> 33:23.440
like expansion for Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which is, um, good that I don't, I think it's

33:23.440 --> 33:27.280
good. They're not doing a whole nother Assassin's Creed game, but they're doing an expansion. I

33:27.280 --> 33:32.080
think is a good way to do it. Um, so that's pretty cool. Uh, and then they were talking about fire

33:32.080 --> 33:38.640
cry six a little bit as well. So, uh, and, uh, also what was not there, the Prince of Persia

33:38.640 --> 33:43.600
Sansa time remake, they bumped it all the way to 2022. Now that thing has been delayed a couple

33:43.600 --> 33:49.280
times now, and now they bumped it all the way to 2022. They did not show it. So interesting.

33:49.280 --> 33:53.360
It's going to just see if it's actually going to happen. I think it will, but I think it's

33:53.360 --> 33:58.560
just having problems. And in all fairness, it's probably COVID related and the difficulties of

33:58.560 --> 34:03.920
developing from home and being able to squash the bugs that way. It's probably, uh, uh, you know,

34:03.920 --> 34:10.400
not, not doing too well. So they have to take a little extra time. Um, Loki, I know you love

34:10.400 --> 34:15.520
these guys that are up next on our agenda, the devolver digital presentation. Did you check this

34:15.520 --> 34:24.400
one out? I did skim through it. Yeah. Um, they have like, was it the, um, shadow warrior three

34:24.400 --> 34:30.240
looks just nuts. I thought originally when I was looking at that, that it was a new serious Sam

34:30.240 --> 34:37.120
game, but yeah, it just looks absolutely crazy. So there's that, um, gosh, I'm trying to think

34:37.120 --> 34:45.040
of the atomic, what was the, there was another game, but I can't remember once again, I watched

34:45.040 --> 34:52.960
the Xbox and I watched the developer digital all like back to back. Um, gosh, I can't remember

34:52.960 --> 34:57.040
what other game they had there that was like really amazing, but there was like a bunch of

34:57.040 --> 35:01.680
like crazy stuff. I mean, it's always crazy. And then of course, you know, the, the gimmicks that

35:01.680 --> 35:06.160
they do where they're selling like a thousand dollar VHS tape or something like that. Um,

35:06.800 --> 35:12.080
always funny. I like this stuff. Yeah, I guess they had a whole like monetization as they're

35:12.080 --> 35:16.560
kind of riffing on the whole like monetization type of thing. Um, so the games they announced,

35:16.560 --> 35:21.680
Loki, maybe one of these old joggy memory, uh, track to Yomi was one of the games.

35:21.760 --> 35:26.880
Um, yeah, that looked interesting. Yeah. Uh, wizard with a gun. I liked, I liked that based

35:26.880 --> 35:31.120
on title alone. That's by the, that's by the folks. I want to, I mean, I can't remember.

35:31.840 --> 35:36.400
I know it wasn't like they, I thought it was another gun game based on the,

35:36.400 --> 35:40.480
the little animated trailer thing that they had at first, but yeah, it's not,

35:41.040 --> 35:46.960
but that looked interesting. It kind of had a don't starve vibe to it. Uh, this game sounds

35:46.960 --> 35:53.920
super interesting to me. Inscription, which is a, uh, rogue like, but a deck builder with escape

35:53.920 --> 36:00.000
room style puzzles and psychological horror. I'm like, wow, way complicated way to take a

36:00.000 --> 36:03.680
lot of random shit that I'm into and like throw it all in the same game. I'm, I'm cool with it.

36:03.680 --> 36:09.600
I'm into it. Why not? Um, let's see. And then, uh, devolver tumble time. Is that actually the

36:09.600 --> 36:14.320
name of the game? I think it is. I thought that was just a parody that he had in there,

36:14.320 --> 36:18.880
but yeah, no, it's a, it's a, it's a legit mobile game that's coming out. iOS and Android,

36:18.880 --> 36:28.560
uh, demon throttle, uh, is one, uh, death's door, uh, phantom abyss and then shadow warrior three.

36:28.560 --> 36:32.560
And that's everything that I see on my list. Demon throttle look cool. Um, but yeah,

36:32.560 --> 36:40.720
shadow warrior three is just insane looking. All right. Um, cool. So, uh, that was pretty much what

36:40.720 --> 36:44.000
was going on with devolver. Admittedly, I didn't catch it just because there was a lot of other

36:44.000 --> 36:48.240
stuff going on this weekend. Uh, I couldn't sit in front of press conferences all weekend long,

36:48.240 --> 36:51.520
but I knew I could catch, uh, some of the wrap ups later on, which it sounds like,

36:51.520 --> 36:53.680
look, you kind of did you binge watch everything today, right?

36:54.240 --> 36:59.200
I just tried to get as much of it in there as I could. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm just, I'm,

36:59.200 --> 37:06.320
I don't always do this, but I have to, so I just got a text message from my dad and he says he's

37:06.320 --> 37:10.080
watching on the iPad right now, which I don't know if I've ever gotten a text like that,

37:10.080 --> 37:14.640
that he's actually watching the show live as it's going on. So, um, can you all in chat show

37:14.640 --> 37:19.200
a little love to my dad who's, uh, watching, especially with father's day coming up next week.

37:19.200 --> 37:23.040
Uh, I think it's pretty rad that he's watching right now. So, um, give him some shout outs

37:23.040 --> 37:27.360
and chat and hello, hello. And, uh, sorry, I'm not texting you back, but I'm a little busy right now,

37:27.360 --> 37:36.560
but there you go. All right. Dad, father's day is actually pretty sad for me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37:36.560 --> 37:41.200
I know. I know it's, uh, yeah. Well, and, and, you know, mother's day for me is rough too. So,

37:41.200 --> 37:46.880
um, yeah. So, um, but, uh, dad, dad chapped a little, tapped a little button that shows you

37:46.880 --> 37:52.160
chat if you don't already see it. Cause there's a lot of love in there. Okay. Anyway. Um, let's

37:52.160 --> 37:57.760
move on. Uh, let's talk about one that I definitely watched. Cause I was, uh, watching this event live,

37:57.760 --> 38:04.080
um, watching it. What's that? I say where you hate watching it. No, I wasn't the Microsoft event.

38:04.080 --> 38:09.440
I wasn't hate watching that was great. No. And I w I wasn't intending on hate watching that,

38:09.440 --> 38:15.840
but we'll get to that. So the Microsoft event. So Bobby and I were doing co-stream much. God,

38:15.840 --> 38:21.120
there was a lot. Well, what do you think? Yeah. Overall, what did you think of Microsoft? Cause

38:21.120 --> 38:26.960
I kind of, I thought it was a tepid reaction on Twitter, but I wasn't, I thought it was excellent.

38:26.960 --> 38:32.720
I thought they did a great job. Yeah. I was a little shocked. It was only an hour and 15

38:32.720 --> 38:37.520
minutes. But, um, when you consider it, like what I really loved about it. And, uh, when Bobby and

38:37.520 --> 38:43.600
I were talking, he really kind of, uh, uh, phrased this a really good way too, is that, um, you have,

38:43.600 --> 38:47.840
you have the beginning and, uh, you know, they're, they're saying Microsoft saying, this is what we're

38:47.840 --> 38:51.760
going to show you. And then they show it to you. And then at the end, they say, this is what we've

38:51.760 --> 38:56.640
shown you. Like, here's the, here's the receipts. And they really did. They showed what, 30 games,

38:56.640 --> 39:03.120
27 of them coming to game pass. And once again, I'm sitting here going, this is the greatest

39:03.120 --> 39:09.120
game pass commercial that Microsoft is doing with this event. Like there was so much good stuff

39:09.120 --> 39:13.840
where it was like, get it on game pass, get it on game pass. I mean, we're talking about new stuff,

39:13.840 --> 39:21.360
like the halo game. And we're talking about things like Hades, right? Uh, an amazing game from last

39:21.360 --> 39:26.640
year that is also going to be coming to game pass. Um, and I think one of the other big shocks

39:26.640 --> 39:31.440
for a game that's coming to game pass is that I had done Chronicles, which, you know, don't call

39:31.440 --> 39:38.560
it Suey Coden, but wink, right? There's, there's that whole thing. And that was, that was crowdfunded.

39:38.560 --> 39:45.280
So it was a little shocking to hear that Microsoft kind of paid to get it on game pass, but the, um,

39:45.280 --> 39:50.480
the creators immediately were doing, if you want to call it damage control, I don't know what you'd

39:50.480 --> 39:53.760
call it because I don't think everybody feels burned by this, but you know, there's going to be

39:53.760 --> 39:58.080
some anti Xbox people out there that are like, why is this on game pass? I didn't back this game for

39:58.080 --> 40:02.080
to be on game. Cause you know, there's always, somebody's going to complain, but they sent out

40:02.080 --> 40:06.400
an email almost immediately to backers and disclosure. I am, I was a backer of the game

40:06.400 --> 40:13.280
that says, um, it's coming out. Uh, there's going to be a third DLC that this Microsoft deal has

40:13.280 --> 40:17.600
completely funded now, in addition to the two, we promised you, and this will be free to all

40:17.600 --> 40:22.480
the backers. So it's like, you're, you're going to get more of this game because of this deal.

40:22.480 --> 40:27.440
I think it's going to hate on that though, but there's haters going to hate haters going to hate

40:28.560 --> 40:33.920
exactly. Exactly. Right. Yeah. And crystal skies 80 and chat says it gets me free deals DLC. So

40:33.920 --> 40:38.720
I'm good. And I think that's an important consider that perspective. They're not taking anything

40:38.720 --> 40:45.360
away. They're adding to, and this is this, this, this happens a lot in gaming on a lot of

40:45.360 --> 40:51.040
different topics. People get mad, but they're not taking away. They're adding to. So it's going to

40:51.040 --> 40:54.880
be fine. They're not suddenly taken away the PlayStation version or the switch version.

40:54.880 --> 40:59.200
It's just that it's also going to be on game pass, but that's still a huge land for game pass.

40:59.200 --> 41:04.480
And in my opinion, a very smart move on Microsoft's part, because what is their biggest,

41:04.480 --> 41:12.000
weakest spot right now at Microsoft Japanese developed games and especially exclusive ones,

41:12.000 --> 41:16.240
they have a huge weak spot there and everybody knows that's Microsoft's blind spot. And they,

41:16.240 --> 41:22.240
they have a really hard time with that is the Japanese develop. So they, they gave this game

41:22.240 --> 41:26.800
a lot of money and now that's a huge asset in Microsoft's pocket. I think it's a very smart

41:26.800 --> 41:33.680
deal. Good for them. So, all right. Let's see what else do we want to talk about from the Microsoft

41:33.680 --> 41:39.200
of that? I know the big one I have to talk about y'all. Cause it was like this unless Nintendo

41:39.760 --> 41:44.080
really blows it out of the water on Tuesday, which I'm managing my expectations.

41:44.080 --> 41:49.120
I don't see how anything beats Forza Horizon 5. That blew my fucking mind. That trailer was

41:49.120 --> 41:56.160
amazing. Um, and what is gorgeous, um, love the fact that they set it in Mexico.

41:57.120 --> 42:03.440
And I think it's important to note. I love that the game is trying to shatter a lot of

42:03.440 --> 42:09.840
perceptions of Mexico because let's be real. A lot of folks in the U S have a certain perception

42:09.840 --> 42:16.480
of Mexico based on the news and the media and that whole thing. Right. And I love the fact that

42:16.480 --> 42:22.560
through a video game, they're going to really challenge our perception perceptions of that

42:22.560 --> 42:28.480
and really show a lot of, you know, all these diverse things, uh, from an entire country.

42:28.480 --> 42:32.160
And I think they really drove the point home when they were like, look how you can get out

42:32.160 --> 42:37.280
of your car and take a picture of this mural that was actually developed by a Mexican artist.

42:37.280 --> 42:42.560
And as a Diego, I do not remember the artist's name in the moment. I'm sorry. I was absorbing

42:42.560 --> 42:49.040
a lot of information, but it was one of the mural, the most, uh, famous, uh, mural creators and

42:49.040 --> 42:56.080
painters of Mexico is also married. Uh, uh, his name was Diego Rivera. He was married to, uh,

42:56.080 --> 43:01.200
Frida Kahlo. Ah, okay. Okay. And they cheated on each other a lot, but that's art history.

43:01.280 --> 43:05.760
That's art history. But even, you know, and so, so even next to all that, the game just

43:05.760 --> 43:10.960
looked beautiful. My God. Like I, I, I went back and looked at the, the thing that Bobby and I was

43:10.960 --> 43:17.040
doing, my jaw was on the floor watching the graphics. It was so good. Um, so yeah. Uh,

43:17.040 --> 43:23.600
Mike Deft is confirming it was not Diego Rivera. Yeah. I didn't see all of it yet. So yeah,

43:23.600 --> 43:27.520
just saw a little bit of the trailer. Check out the footage for the game. It looks amazing.

43:27.600 --> 43:33.200
Look at a mural. I'd look at Diego. What I also thought was kind of novel about

43:33.200 --> 43:38.640
Forza and, uh, Forza Horizon and the fact that it was showing up at Microsoft's conference.

43:38.640 --> 43:45.840
That's the game they dedicated the most time to not halo, not battlefield. They dedicated the most

43:45.840 --> 43:52.000
time to Forza Horizon five. And like, I, I, I, I, on one hand, I get it because those Forza games

43:52.000 --> 43:56.480
are always incredibly critically well-received and I'm sure this game is going to be no different.

43:56.480 --> 44:02.400
Um, obviously it's huge. Yeah. And showing up like now you're getting to watch it in 4k even.

44:02.400 --> 44:06.640
And when it was being streamed live, it wasn't in 4k. And I bet it's even more gorgeous in 4k.

44:06.640 --> 44:12.080
I got to go back and watch it again. Um, but, uh, just the fact that that was the tent pole

44:12.080 --> 44:17.120
made me so happy because that was what really finally converted me over to the Xbox camp was

44:17.120 --> 44:22.400
really playing Forza Horizon was like a huge, you know, I was like, there just isn't a racing game

44:22.400 --> 44:28.640
like this. This is huge. So, and crystal skies in chat points out Forza Horizon still has a massive

44:28.640 --> 44:33.840
dedicated fan base. And by the way, shout out you guys, I, since we're recording a podcast,

44:33.840 --> 44:38.080
you know what, but you guys have a hype train going in chat and I just, I just want to say

44:38.080 --> 44:42.480
thank you. I'm sorry. You know, since we're recording this show, I don't like to do the

44:42.480 --> 44:45.840
usual Twitch thing of, of doing all the shout outs in the middle of the show, cause it kind

44:45.840 --> 44:51.680
of disrupts the flow of the podcast, but I just, your generosity is so kind. So thank you guys so

44:51.680 --> 44:55.120
much. I really appreciate all of you. Thank you for being here on Sunday night. I appreciate it.

44:55.760 --> 45:02.480
Um, Mike, I really like this mural. Oh yeah. Mike Defton chat called out. It is a Farid Rueda. I

45:02.480 --> 45:05.840
hope I said that name right. Uh, who did that mural? Yeah. It's a cool mirror. It looks like

45:05.840 --> 45:09.520
something you'd see on a, uh, like in the wide open walls downtown, doesn't it? Especially

45:09.520 --> 45:14.880
because it's a bear in California is really big on bears. It makes me think of some of the murals

45:14.880 --> 45:21.920
I've seen in parts of, uh, Oakland. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, yeah, that stole the whole damn show

45:21.920 --> 45:28.880
to me was that Forza Horizon, but right before Forza Horizon came up was that Microsoft flight

45:28.880 --> 45:38.800
simulator on Xbox and who that was gorgeous. I mean that we, it's, it's, we already know that

45:38.800 --> 45:42.400
game is gorgeous. Like, you know, it's already been out on PC and it's kind of like, if you,

45:42.400 --> 45:45.600
if you watch people stream that game, you've played it yourself. It's like, we, we've been

45:45.600 --> 45:51.040
new. We knew that game was gorgeous, but to see it on the series X, you know, a platform that's

45:51.040 --> 45:56.960
really optimized for gaming and to just look, I mean, Oh my God, dark soccer, bring up that

45:56.960 --> 46:02.560
trailer too, because never in my life, 20 years ago, I would have never thought like I'm into

46:02.560 --> 46:10.400
flight Sims, but like, I actually had been watching that one and you want to know, honestly,

46:10.400 --> 46:15.040
the first thing that popped into my head and you're going to laugh your ass off about this

46:15.040 --> 46:21.280
is I was thinking of a Soren from Disneyland. Oh, Oh my God. Kinda. You do kind of get that

46:21.280 --> 46:25.920
vibe from a trailer like that, right? I totally got that vibe down to the music and everything,

46:25.920 --> 46:32.080
but it is really, it is really pretty. Um, all the various different kinds of planes now I probably,

46:32.080 --> 46:38.720
well, there's a Top Gun reference of course. Um, I mean, I probably wouldn't play it,

46:38.720 --> 46:44.720
but I would watch people play it. Does that make sense? Yeah. Well, yes, especially how you've,

46:44.720 --> 46:50.400
you've turned into quite the Twitch person this past three months, ever since you discovered

46:50.400 --> 46:55.600
the Dead by Daylight community. And it's like queer people playing horror games, my home,

46:56.800 --> 47:02.240
right? Am I wrong? Well, no, I was just like, well, honestly, like what got me

47:03.120 --> 47:11.280
into that was, um, my friend, uh, sweet Nika. And then I discovered the rest of the community

47:11.280 --> 47:16.720
around it and I'm like, Ooh, I like these people and I like this game and I suck at it,

47:16.720 --> 47:24.480
but I'm getting better. And yeah. So anyway, um, anyway, um, yes. So you brought up the Top Gun

47:24.480 --> 47:28.800
thing that was actually, um, there's, it's like, it looks like a free exp, no, maybe not free. I

47:28.800 --> 47:34.240
don't know, but it's free. Oh shit. So like a free expansion to flight simulator that they're

47:34.240 --> 47:40.480
actually, you can fly the fricking planes from Top Gun and all that. So I tie in with the new movie.

47:40.480 --> 47:45.760
Oh yeah. For sure. For sure. But it's, it's still, it's like how it went in F 15 Tomcat.

47:45.760 --> 47:51.760
Yeah. How completely unnecessary, but awesome. Right. As long as, as long as we get like the

47:51.760 --> 47:57.040
Top Gun soundtrack in there as well. Yes. That remix was great. Bobby, like the minute Bobby

47:57.040 --> 48:02.560
heard that bong that starts right there. He's like, it's Top Gun. Holy shit. It's Top Gun.

48:05.760 --> 48:09.280
Yeah. Right now we just need like Kenny Loggins on the soundtrack.

48:10.480 --> 48:17.440
Um, but no, for me, all I need, just the thing I do not want, please do not have the refueling

48:17.440 --> 48:22.800
plane in flight simulator. No, no, no, no. And if you don't know what I'm talking about,

48:23.360 --> 48:29.120
go back to the NES Top Gun game, which was amazing. Like for back in the day on the NES,

48:29.120 --> 48:35.600
the Top Gun game was the shit. That game was awesome. The only thing cooler than the Top Gun

48:35.600 --> 48:42.880
video game was the Top Gun ride at Six Flags Great America in the Bay Area. Yeah. But Rob,

48:44.000 --> 48:48.560
it honestly, okay. I'm going to, I'm going to admit something to you. Okay. I had the

48:48.640 --> 49:00.240
how to win at video games, VHS tape, and it had how to do the refuel thing perfectly every time.

49:00.240 --> 49:07.040
Wow. I could never get it. I could never get it. Once you have like the pitch and everything,

49:07.040 --> 49:13.680
it actually isn't that hard to get your plane there. If you do the same one every time.

49:13.680 --> 49:19.040
It's just interesting. But honestly though, After Burner was better.

49:21.760 --> 49:26.720
Always saying it. A Sega fan till the very end. A Sega fan till the very end. No, keep in mind,

49:26.720 --> 49:34.080
I grew up with Nintendo and Super Nintendo. Dan's the Sega guy. I know. But stepping back now,

49:34.640 --> 49:41.360
I can say this, After Burner is a better game because no refueling and it's a lot more fast

49:41.360 --> 49:46.880
paced. The Top Gun was no slouch. All right. It was no slouch. No. All right.

49:46.880 --> 49:50.720
After Burner had better music. But the two, I got to say, aside from those though,

49:50.720 --> 49:54.160
there was some other smaller stuff that looked pretty awesome. Like Replace,

49:55.120 --> 50:00.880
that pixel art kind of like, I don't even know. It just looks amazing. Just the artwork in that

50:00.880 --> 50:07.600
is such amazing work. I need to try it. And then Atomic Heart, which kind of looked like a

50:07.600 --> 50:14.160
Soviet version of Fallout, looked just crazy. So I'm gonna check those out.

50:14.160 --> 50:18.080
I just have to shout out the chatters one more time because that hype train got all the way to

50:18.080 --> 50:23.920
level five. They beat the final boss of the hype train. There's no more levels to the hype train.

50:23.920 --> 50:28.880
They got it all the way. They defeated the hype train much like Final Fantasy VI.

50:28.880 --> 50:34.560
They suplexed that hype train. Absolutely. Thank you guys so much. Thank you to all of

50:34.640 --> 50:38.640
you who participated with that. Thank you. Thank you. Another game that just is really

50:38.640 --> 50:43.040
pretty to me, although I don't know if I'm going to play it though, is Out of Worlds.

50:44.320 --> 50:49.440
You must watch the trailer. The narration. Okay. The narration. Well, listen to it too,

50:49.440 --> 50:54.640
because the narration is funny as hell. But yes, it looks good too. I thought it was Fable at first

50:54.640 --> 50:59.440
until there was Space Aliens. I was like, wait, this can't be Fable. What if they did like

51:00.080 --> 51:06.480
Fable alien version? I'd be into it, but they need to give us Fable the regular version first,

51:06.480 --> 51:13.840
which we haven't seen yet. We need more Fable. You should really play Out of Worlds. I hear it's

51:13.840 --> 51:18.080
really good. Oh, I played a little bit of it and it is really fun. And it's just one of those again,

51:18.080 --> 51:22.320
you know, then I got distracted by something shiny and didn't go back and finish it,

51:22.320 --> 51:26.640
but I need to. I really do. Let's talk about some of the other announcements of the Microsoft

51:26.640 --> 51:31.600
Bethesda event. I think a big one we have to mention. Starfield. So we kind of got the first

51:31.600 --> 51:37.520
look at Starfield, although they didn't really show the game. So I still am not really like,

51:37.520 --> 51:43.840
okay, it's space. We knew that. But I will say like, not to sound like low on it, because when

51:43.840 --> 51:49.440
I was watching the trailer, I was like, the level of graphical detail in this game is amazing.

51:49.440 --> 51:54.480
You know, there was really paying attention to detail. And maybe that's why this game is taking

51:54.480 --> 51:58.640
so fucking long, which is fine, is that they're paying such attention to detail. But we did

51:58.640 --> 52:02.960
finally get the date. It's going to be 11-11-22, which is cute, because that's, you know, what,

52:02.960 --> 52:08.880
11 years after Skyrim, right? So it's going to be then. And they did confirm, they put an end to

52:08.880 --> 52:15.200
this whole, are they or are they? It is Xbox exclusive. So none for you, PlayStation, which,

52:16.480 --> 52:21.520
you know, is an expected move on Microsoft's part. They got to do it to kind of counter

52:22.320 --> 52:27.280
the Horizon Zero Dawns and the, you know, God of Wars of the world. They had to do something

52:27.840 --> 52:31.600
of their own. But unfortunately, we didn't really get to see gameplay. And so I'm like,

52:31.600 --> 52:37.760
is it Skyrim in space? Is it? What is it? So unfortunately, that part was still kind of

52:37.760 --> 52:42.240
missing for me. But hopefully we'll see more. At least we know, okay, we got about a year and a

52:42.240 --> 52:46.880
half to go. So we'll probably see way more about it at the next E3, that's for sure.

52:47.600 --> 52:49.360
So it's no man's mass effect.

52:50.160 --> 52:54.560
Hey, you know, I love this. You know, I love the space games. So that's why I'm already,

52:54.560 --> 53:01.600
you know, yeah, you joke, but that that game already has me on it. Exactly. Let's see some

53:01.600 --> 53:06.800
of the other things to mention. So they closed with an interesting game. Let's talk about the

53:06.800 --> 53:12.960
actual closing of it because I saw some comments in chat. So they closed with a game called Redfall

53:13.680 --> 53:20.560
that was a like co op open world game, if I remember right. And it looks a lot like a

53:21.200 --> 53:25.440
zombie Left 4 Dead type of thing, except it's not zombies. It's vampires.

53:27.040 --> 53:33.520
So it's a vampire shooter game. Now, here's the thing. I liked it. I liked that it was a,

53:33.520 --> 53:38.720
you know, diverse roster of characters that looked very like they all had very big personalities

53:39.280 --> 53:42.400
that look like a lot of fun. I felt like I was watching

53:42.400 --> 53:48.160
like a good Netflix anime type of thing. But the problem was, where's the game?

53:51.520 --> 53:54.400
They're just trying to build hype. I know, but it's, you know, and that's,

53:55.360 --> 54:00.080
it's it's hard because I just I'm kind of where's the game? What am I supposed to get hyped about?

54:00.080 --> 54:05.520
Because we're all old enough to know that isn't what the game really looks like. So look, I get

54:05.760 --> 54:12.800
from a concept level, okay, they sold it. And my brain goes way back to when Blizzard first teased

54:12.800 --> 54:18.480
Overwatch. They had their epic cinematic, right? And that was really to sell the universe,

54:18.480 --> 54:22.720
this brand new IP that they're putting out. And they really did a kick ass job of it. But they

54:22.720 --> 54:26.480
immediately followed it up with, oh, and this game is playable on the show floor at Blizzcon.

54:26.480 --> 54:30.400
So people knew like that it was going to be like a Team Fortress-esque type of game right off the

54:30.400 --> 54:35.280
bat. We don't really know what this game is. And that's the only problem I really had with it,

54:35.360 --> 54:40.720
especially as a closer. I was just kind of surprised, like a new IP that you're not

54:40.720 --> 54:46.320
really showing us the game is the closer. It was just an interesting choice. I'm not saying like,

54:46.320 --> 54:51.840
it was a choice fail. I'm not saying fail. I'm just like, I'm not, I would have probably just

54:51.840 --> 54:57.440
maybe ended with the Forza Horizon 5, but, or see, I'm kind of like maybe the Starfield thing,

54:57.440 --> 55:01.120
but then I think I would have had the same bitch is that they're not actually showing gameplay.

55:01.120 --> 55:08.160
Why did they do that last? So I don't know. Um, choices. Yeah. Zen Monkey in chat says,

55:08.160 --> 55:12.480
I loved it. We'll see the game early next year. It's Borderlands with vampires set in the present

55:12.480 --> 55:16.640
day. Yeah. And again, I'm not trying to shit on people that did enjoy it. That's great. I mean,

55:16.640 --> 55:21.040
that's what it's trying to do is build hype, get you into this. But for me, I'm just like,

55:21.040 --> 55:25.440
where's the game, sis? I got to see like, what, like, and that's, that's when I'm going to know

55:25.440 --> 55:31.280
if I'm like, Ooh, I'm into this or I don't know. It looks a little, not my type of thing. Like

55:31.280 --> 55:36.160
kind of like stalker too. I'm like, this looks really pretty. Probably not the type of thing

55:36.160 --> 55:45.200
I'm into, but it is on game pass. So, I mean, maybe I check it out that way. So, um, Questbuster

55:45.200 --> 55:50.480
in chat says there's also vampire blood hunt based on the masquerade IP that's coming out this year,

55:50.480 --> 55:57.120
a vampire battle royale. Yeah. I thought of that too. So definitely, um, zombies out with that's

55:57.120 --> 56:01.440
old news. I mean, sure we have back for blood coming too, but zombies that's, that's the old

56:01.440 --> 56:06.880
vampires. That's the hot shit. But here's my question. Do the vampires sparkle?

56:08.640 --> 56:15.440
No, because they're real vampires. But sparkle dark Sakura. No.

56:15.440 --> 56:22.320
All right. The answer is always no. What else from Microsoft's event do I need to mention,

56:22.320 --> 56:27.360
Loki? Halo Infinite looks amazing. Oh yeah. Yeah. I guess I thought I touched on that a little bit.

56:28.240 --> 56:34.240
Well, did they recover from what they showed last time, which was not well received? Absolutely.

56:34.240 --> 56:40.160
Which for the record, I wasn't bothered by what I saw last time. I didn't think they had to make it.

56:40.160 --> 56:44.320
Yeah. I just was like, okay, it's got a Halo one vibe. They're, they're doing a throwback thing,

56:44.320 --> 56:50.080
but they really went out of their way to like show, like, look where the game's at now. It's

56:50.080 --> 56:54.240
in a very different place. So, I mean, good for them. Uh, the only thing that was a little muddled

56:54.240 --> 56:58.480
for me and maybe chat, you guys can help me clear this up. I don't understand what they meant when

56:58.480 --> 57:05.360
they said episode one is out this holiday. Did they just mean the multiplayer episode one? Or

57:05.360 --> 57:10.160
are they like dividing up the main game because it's not all going to be done yet. That was the

57:10.160 --> 57:14.560
part that threw me a little bit. And I was like, they, that muddled the message for me big time.

57:14.560 --> 57:20.320
I wish they hadn't done that, but otherwise multiplayer and then have the story campaign is

57:20.320 --> 57:27.360
split up. Maybe, maybe, I don't know. So, uh, everybody in chat is still yelling about me

57:27.360 --> 57:32.880
talking about sparkling vampires. Sorry about that. Uh, fifth dream does say infinite implies

57:32.880 --> 57:39.040
game as a service. I E in pieces. Well, that is a fair point. Absolutely. But they also mentioned

57:39.040 --> 57:44.800
it was a ship too, or their place or something. Yeah. Yeah. And so I'm kind of like, well,

57:44.800 --> 57:51.840
what are they charging 60 bucks for then? I don't even, are they charging $60? Cause like,

57:51.840 --> 57:56.240
we don't know what the price is yet. I guess that's true too. It could be $70. Well, but then

57:56.240 --> 58:00.720
for a lot of people it's game pass. And that was kind of the thing that's kind of what I left with

58:00.720 --> 58:04.720
on that as I was like, well, are they releasing part of the game or I was like, well, it doesn't

58:04.720 --> 58:09.280
really matter. Cause I have game pass. So I'll just get whatever they put out again,

58:09.280 --> 58:14.160
a lovely game pass commercial Microsoft put out today, a very lovely game pass commercial.

58:14.800 --> 58:21.840
So, all right. Uh, pretty cool as well. Which one? I got a stock or two. I got it. Well,

58:21.840 --> 58:24.480
I mean, it's pretty obvious cause it's pretty similar, but I got a very,

58:25.280 --> 58:28.880
you know, Metro vibe from that, but I mean, it looks good.

58:29.120 --> 58:36.560
Uh, Phoenix 77, 26 talking about the, uh, halo release says, I mean, look at FIFA Rob

58:36.560 --> 58:43.040
and the shit that does for $60 USD. Uh, E3VL says $60 for campaign multiplayer live service

58:43.040 --> 58:46.480
multiplayer is free to play. Yeah. I definitely caught that. And that's a great thing. And I

58:46.480 --> 58:49.920
think we should all be thankful to go back to Phoenix's comment. We should all be thankful.

58:49.920 --> 58:59.280
It's not an EA game. All right. So, all right. Uh, yeah. And Pele Hanumea says the plot to

58:59.280 --> 59:02.400
infinite is where's Cortana. That sure looked like what they were kind of showing there,

59:02.400 --> 59:06.800
but it looks really pretty everything that was there. So cool. All right. Anything else

59:06.800 --> 59:14.160
from Microsoft before we move on to the next one? Okay. Let's move on. Let's talk about the last

59:14.160 --> 59:19.520
one that I watched today and that was a square Enix's event. Um, Oh yeah. Let's talk about some

59:19.520 --> 59:30.080
fucking choices. Jesus. Like, I'm kind of excited about the pixel remaster. I'm not, I'm, I'm

59:30.080 --> 59:34.080
pissed about it. I'm, I'm straight up pissed about it. I'm going to tell you why it was the very end

59:34.080 --> 59:39.120
of the trailer that said coming for steam and mobile. And do you guys not have phones?

59:40.720 --> 59:46.800
Here's the thing. When's and square's done this before when they put games out on steam that are

59:46.800 --> 59:52.880
just mobile ports, they're terrible. And look, I'm sorry. Final fantasy is not, especially the

59:52.880 --> 59:58.080
classic games are not meant to be played on mobile. Like I'm fine with RPGs that are created

59:58.080 --> 01:00:02.800
for the mobile space with the touch controller and all that in mind. Case in point, Fantasian.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:08.160
Great. That is good. Yeah. And that is like the final fantasy esque thing for mobile. I'm thrilled

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:12.880
that exists and I want to play it at some point. I don't need final fantasy six shoe horn on a

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:19.680
fucking mobile phone again. Like I just, that's what's irritating me about it. I, I'm not looking

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:25.200
at it the same way. I'm looking at it with hopefully having that same sort of control

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:32.560
like Fantasian does. And if so, I'd be super happy with it. You know what I wanted, I want to be able

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:39.920
to play it on my Mac. I'm, I'm happy to be proved wrong and it ends up being okay. But I just, I

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:45.840
guess I'm disappointed. It's not like on the switch. Which seems to be the perfect place for

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:51.040
something like that. And then I actually have my controller and I can play it like, and, and just

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:55.920
to package just like final fantasy one and two from game boy advance. I don't know what they

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:59.840
would do for three. I guess they could do a new translation of that or whatever that that's going

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:04.000
to be the most interesting release is final fantasy three, in my opinion, because keep in mind,

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.240
we've only ever gotten that game in the 3d remake localized. So it's going to be interesting that

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:13.040
that's the most interesting one to me. And if I buy any of them, it'll be that one. And then,

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:18.240
you know, four had a great version on PSP and so on. So it's not like it's not the pixel remaster

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:23.840
part that bothers me. It's just the whole fact that if they're aiming for mobile, I'm, I'm not

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:29.920
sure I'm into it. But we do still have Nintendo's event on Tuesday. And they could end up announcing

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.840
it again. And it's coming to switch as well. Although I'm trying to be a realist about that.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:39.040
And I realized that is probably not going to happen. But I just like I was so kicked in the

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:44.400
gut after that, that I just, I almost like tuned out the rest of the Square Enix thing. I was just

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:53.360
like, I just, why? But anyway, so there was some other stuff. The Guardians of the Galaxy game. So

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:58.560
Dark Soccer, you brought this up earlier. They spent a lot of time on it a lot, a lot of time

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:03.600
on that Guardians of the Galaxy game. But I thought I thought it looked decent. And

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:09.360
I liked it. It's based more off the comic look. Yeah. Yeah. Shane had a great tweet about it.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:13.600
He tweeted something like, Hey, since a Star Lord doesn't look like Chris Pratt at all,

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:17.040
I'm kind of into this. Yeah, I thought it was funny.

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:23.680
It's I like that Gamora looks like she does in the comics.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:27.680
Yeah. Yeah, they all do. I think that you can only play Star Lord.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:35.680
As far as we know, I'm sure there'll be DLC or something, but who knows? But a lot of people

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:40.240
were right off the bat kind of boxing that. Well, I don't say boxing it in, but throwing it in,

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:47.200
sorting it in with the Avengers game. And it's important to note Avengers was done by a different

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:53.040
studio. So this Guardians of the Galaxy is coming from Eidos Montreal. So it is being developed in

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:58.560
a different place. So I and they were very big to say at the beginning, this is a single player

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:03.200
game, or at least has a single player experience. So they were trying to kind of differentiate it

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:10.480
from the beginning from what you might see with the Avengers or what have you. Alan bought me a

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:15.680
present. Look at this. Look at this from Target. Thank you, Alan. Can you actually since you're

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:19.680
standing? I know you guys can't see I'll describe put it closer to the camera. Just so folks see it.

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:25.840
It's a little Street Fighter two mini machine. But that actually has like the full controller

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:32.160
with the six buttons. Yeah, right. All right. I need one of those. He got it at Target. But it's

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:39.120
I think wasn't it like $50? 50 bucks. But this is bucks. I can just play this. This is a little

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:45.520
more solid than the this is by far bigger than any of the other mini cabs I have. That's for sure.

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:50.080
Wow, this has a huge cord that goes with it, too. That's, that's something else. So there you go.

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:55.840
SG100 Matt says Alan loves me. Yeah, that's true. That's true. Thank you, Alan.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:02.880
He did have to ask. Am I allowed to spend $50 on this for you? And I'm like, Well, if it's for me,

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:10.400
yeah. All right. All right. It does look good. That game looks pretty awesome. Yeah. So let's

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:14.800
see. Sorry. Sorry. I derailed us a little bit. But that's the joy of doing things live. So yeah,

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.880
Guardians of the Galaxy. I'm into it. I want to check it out. What else did they announce? They

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:24.720
had that what was the the Babylon? That was the game that was right after the final? Yeah, the

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:29.120
the thing that was right after the Final Fantasy news. So I was kind of seeing fall. Yeah. I mean,

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:35.520
it did look interesting, though. It's a platinum thing, right? Yeah. So I want to check out the

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:39.120
beta that game for sure. And then I think the other big thing they announced there was that

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:43.520
Final Fantasy origin. That whole thing had been rumored on various, you know, Twitter's social

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:48.400
media web forums for a little bit is that Final Fantasy is getting a Dark Souls esque type of

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:53.040
game because that is now all the rage apparently between things like Elden Ring. And now we've got

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:58.000
this coming as well as the Final Fantasy take on the Dark Souls. Although it appears to be

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.880
possibly something that's like a prequel to Final Fantasy one, because it's it's Final Fantasy

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:08.560
origin, not to be confused with Final Fantasy origins, a great PlayStation compilation of old

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:14.400
Final Fantasy games that were not done for mobile. But anyway, it's like it's a little too

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:23.920
Devil May Cry. Yeah, I think Team Ninja. So that reminded me a lot of like Ninja Gaiden or

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:30.800
something like that. Yeah, they're redos of Ninja Gaiden, but it's. I suppose it would be

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:36.160
interesting. I mean, it's in the universe, but, you know, I don't know. Well, I'm happy.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:40.720
Go ahead. Well, I was just saying as much as I love Final Fantasy seven,

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:47.360
at least it's not a Final Fantasy seven universe. Yeah, and I'm I'm I'm glad they're doing a demo

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:51.040
to even if I don't have a PlayStation five. So I'm a little bit like sad that they don't have

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:56.560
a comparable thing on Series X right now, but at least they have a demo coming out so we can get

01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:00.960
a better sense of, you know, what is this game? And that does show that they really believe in it.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:06.640
You know, to put out a demo can really make or break your entire game. And especially if you're

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:11.680
Square Enix, Square Enix knows this better than anyone right now. Hello, Balan Wonderland, right?

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:17.440
A demo can make or break your entire game. Although, you know, then there was also Ni No

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:21.280
Kuni, which had a terrible demo, but the game turned out okay. But I digress. But the fact

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:24.480
that they're putting it out there and actually having a demo that's playable, I think is pretty

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:30.160
interesting. So I want to check. I'm sure somebody will stream that demo or it'll be on YouTube.

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:36.400
So I can at least get a sense of like what it's all about that way. So it'll be interesting. I'm

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:40.880
curious about it. I'm willing to give it a shot. Let's put it that way. Because it does seem like

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:44.880
Final Fantasy wants a franchise out of this because the name of the game is not Final Fantasy

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:50.400
Origin. The name of the game is something else that escapes me in the moment. It had a different

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:54.720
title. Rangers of Paradise. Thank you. Stranger of Paradise. Stranger of Paradise,

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:59.840
Final Fantasy Origin. So ending though on that trailer, though, did kind of give me a little

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:05.840
bit of a chill. How so? Just with Garland. Yeah, true. True. I mean, I saw it coming,

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:12.080
but at the same time was just like, hey, I like it. I can't wait for the sequel, though. Stranger

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:18.640
of Paradise, Chocoba Racing Origin. It's going to be amazing. I hope so. I hope so. A Souls-like

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:25.200
Chocoba Racing game. I think many folks probably surprised. No updates on Final Fantasy 16.

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:30.960
No. So I guess that'll be ready when it's ready. I mean, I don't think any of us were anticipating

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:37.520
it this year anyway. So maybe they just would rather keep. I guess that super cut at the very

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:42.560
end of the Square Enix thing might have had like two seconds of new footage of Final Fantasy 16.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:48.480
But otherwise, they didn't really have an update on it. So, you know, which all right,

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:51.840
if it's not ready, it's not ready. And we're probably not seeing it till next year,

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:56.320
realistically anyway. So, but I was a little surprised there wasn't an update because it's

01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:03.760
such a tentpole title for Square Enix, but okay. I mean, they did Creative Unit 3 did just have

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:08.960
their Final Fantasy 14 showcase a few weeks ago. So maybe they just weren't ready to talk about 16

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:17.600
right away. I don't know, whatever. So, no. All right. Well, there were other things that weren't

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:22.960
in the big batches. Yeah. Anything else you want to shout out here before we get to predictions or

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:28.320
whatever? The Among Us stuff is kind of cute. Oh yeah. Well, that was in the Microsoft thing.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:34.560
Was it? I didn't notice. Actually, I think it was in the Microsoft and Summer Game Fest. You know,

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:39.360
that game is still huge. What was your take on all that? Well, just the, I mean, it's not,

01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:43.920
I think it would be nicer, especially with all the streamers that I watched it play a lot of

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:51.120
Among Us. It definitely allows for more friends to get together and have fun being totally sus.

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:56.880
The colors though were interesting. Like I'm totally into the maroon.

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:02.720
Yeah. And the expansion to 15 players, right? Cause that, the 10 is the old.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:06.720
That's what I was just saying about the 15. Being able to play with more people.

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:10.320
Oh, and of course the Jeff outfit, the Jeff Keeley outfit. That was the big thing.

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:18.640
Yeah. That return. Yes, there is that. But I mean, this, the game itself was sort of like,

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:23.840
it took a little bit of time for it to really take off and now it's super taken off.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:31.760
And I think that it's just, I mean, just another thing for the power of the internet, you know?

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:38.080
For sure. That's how I look at it. Any other games you want to shout out?

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:42.000
You or Loki before we, yeah. No.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.040
Okay. I didn't watch this, so no. All right.

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:51.120
I mean, totally, totally not part of, part of the thing, but we get our new Dead by Daylight DLC

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:56.320
soon and I'm kind of quaking for it. Yeah, that'll be exciting. That's for sure.

01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:02.880
So, yes. Yeah. Well, I know we have a Dead by Daylight story coming up later and what was

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:07.520
diverting your attention today, but we'll get into that a little later. For now, let's talk about the

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:11.440
upcoming week because we are right in the middle of things. So we're taping this on Sunday night.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:15.280
So by the time some of you are listening to this podcast, we may actually have more details on

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:19.200
things that we didn't know about at the time we were taping this. And certainly one of the big

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:24.320
things, you know, if you're listening to this after Tuesday, Nintendo will have had their direct

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:29.920
Tuesday morning. And, you know, the bar is set pretty high for Nintendo, I think. There's a lot,

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:36.160
you know, and probably mistakenly so by a lot of people. There's this weird ass rumor going

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:42.640
around right now about the whole GameStop ad that says New Nintendo Switch when I,

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:48.800
I'm going to be, I'm going to be completely, I'm just gonna say it. Consider the source on that,

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:53.920
which is one of the most clickbaity game journalists I've ever seen in my life.

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:56.560
And we don't have to drag him in chat if you know what I'm talking about.

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:03.280
I just, I think it's one of the most clickbaity people I've ever seen in my life. And if you look

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:08.160
on that ad that they're like, oh, it said the New Nintendo Switch. It literally says the promotion

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:12.480
starts today. So if there was a New Nintendo Switch, I think we would have known about it

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:20.640
today. So I think they meant new as in not used or new as in the remake that has the better battery,

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:25.200
because even the picture was still the old Nintendo Switch. So I don't, I don't know what,

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:29.520
I think they're making something out of nothing, which is what clickbait journalists do. So,

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:35.280
whatever. Anyhow, and Nintendo has said they're not announcing hardware. Like they said very

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:40.240
plainly, it's 40 minutes of software. And I really do think there is the potential that they delayed

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:44.160
the hardware suddenly to next year when they realized they would not be able to make enough.

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:49.040
For a change, Nintendo probably made the right decision in that aspect.

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:54.800
But let's talk about the software that we might see from Nintendo. You know, huge, if we want to

01:11:54.800 --> 01:12:00.800
believe rumors, although in my opinion, a lot of Nintendo rumors are kind of all bullshit right

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:04.960
now because that New Nintendo thing is not playing out. So I don't know how much stock I put in this

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:11.600
whole 2D Metroid thing that supposedly is what we're going to see. I would, don't get me wrong,

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:15.680
I would fucking love it. But I'm not going to, I'm not going to set that bar and just get

01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:22.000
disappointed. So if it happens, yay. I would also be yay just with a simple Metroid Prime 4 update.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.080
And even if they also date it for 2022, I'm fine with that. And because that's probably

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:34.160
how long it's going to take, honestly. So, but 40 minutes is a lot for Nintendo.

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:34.960
That's a lot of time.

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:36.080
That is a lot of time.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:45.040
Well, and they, I have a feeling they are going to unveil something big and do a deep dive.

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:51.840
Um, because look at things like Game Builder Garage or some of the other recent stuff this

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:56.800
year. Nintendo is announcing things with a six week lead time. So it is very, and this is,

01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:01.600
I think what's realistic. If whether it's a 2D Metroid or something else, I think Nintendo

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:06.640
will announce like a Labor Day game and give us a deep dive on it, on why we're all going

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:10.880
to pre-order it today. So we'll, we'll see. We'll see what happens with that.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:17.120
Um, some folks in chat E3VL says, I just want a Breath of the Wild 2 gameplay trailer. Dark

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:20.880
Tetsuya says, yeah, I'd love to see more on Breath of the Wild 2. Um, big same, you know,

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:24.640
I have strong feelings on that. I think Nintendo really needs to put up or shut up on that.

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:28.400
And yes, I know at the end of the day, it's not going to change sales whatsoever. They can,

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:34.160
they can do whatever they want, but I just, it's like, come on. Like, you know, where it,

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:40.240
give the fans something, like it just starts to feel like they don't care about fans when they,

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:44.560
when they go so long without even like just a hint of information. It's just,

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:52.080
yeah, a lot to me. Uh, SheHulk10 in chat says, I need Donkey Kong. I could see that as well

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:57.680
as like a surprise Labor Day release. I think something like that, like a Donkey Kong, uh,

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:01.840
in the style of Tropical Freeze and that whole thing. I think a Donkey Kong game like that

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:06.160
coming out Labor Day, like a six week lead time and they do a deep dive on it. I think that is,

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:10.240
I think that is a realistic prediction, but it is a prediction for sure.

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:16.080
I would just like to see something. It'd be nice for like a new Mario Kart. I think it'd be,

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:20.080
I mean, it's really, it's been a while since we've had any Mario Kart game since the last

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:24.720
one that they released was on the Wii U. Not counting the world or the camera game,

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:30.880
the AR game. That was, that was its own thing. That was, that was, yeah, I think you have to,

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:35.360
but you know, you know, they're going to say it. If I don't say we had the, the, the AR game,

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:38.320
they're going to say, we just got a Mario game last year, Loki.

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:42.240
Yeah, that doesn't even count though. It's like, we have the mobile game too.

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:48.720
That I would think counted more than the AR game. Like I think I've learned my lesson with not

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:55.280
buying any more AR things from them. Like it just, it just doesn't get used at all. Um,

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:01.760
I don't know. We'll see. I'm not, I don't have high expectations

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:05.200
because, you know, if you do that, you're just gonna get disappointed.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:08.880
Yeah, I understand. I just hope there's a couple of nice things that are like,

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:14.880
we're going to release it today. Cause I love that stuff. I love this. Maybe another 99 game,

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:20.000
even though they just did the Pac-Man one, but I would, I would be all about like a new 99 game.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.280
I think that would be fun. Um, but you know, I I'm, I'm always, I would, I would love to see

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:30.000
the NES remix series come back. Um, another sleeper series I'd love to see come back.

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:34.800
And this one gets rumored a lot Wario where, where the hell's that been? I'd love to see

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:40.160
that come back on switch. Um, but again, I don't want to, you know, set the bar too crazy high

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:47.040
because it'll just be disappointment. So, um, She-Hulk 10 in chat says Nintendo needs

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:53.360
X-Box game pass streaming X-Box games. Oh, like an X cloud player. Um, I, you know,

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:58.400
I think there's a lot of people that would be so fucking hype if something like that happens.

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:04.000
But I, I, that, that is like, uh, that is one of those things where like, if we were betting

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.040
illegally on what would be announced, like that would be a high odd thing. That would be like a,

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:14.640
uh, 50 to one odds that something like that happens, you know, that's a, that's a stretch.

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:20.160
I don't know. Um, but it is interesting, isn't it? When Phil Spencer sits there and he has a

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:25.920
switch sitting behind him, it is. But for me, I'm like, well, that's just like, you know, that's,

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:32.320
um, Psychonauts 2 coming to switch. You know, I, I, I don't know if I'm willing to say,

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:36.240
it's going to be this X cloud thing, but it would, Holy shit, would that be amazing?

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:43.200
That would be, I'm sure he wouldn't say no. Microsoft doesn't have a portable system.

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:50.000
Nintendo would have the strength of Microsoft's library on their portable system, but is it worth

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.160
it to them? I don't know. I just, I there there's a lot of it where I'm like, it just,

01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:01.280
I feel like that the fanboy want is outreach outweighing the realization of what is realistic

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:07.040
and good business sense, especially for a company like Nintendo. So I don't, I'm not willing to put

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:11.360
my heart too much into that rumor. I think it's rad as hell. I'd love it, but I just,

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:16.640
I think realistically it's not going to happen, but I, I will, I will sit here and happily eat

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:21.840
my words with a big old spoon on next week's show. I will happily do that. We'll just say that there's

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:25.840
no new Nintendo switch. And what they're doing instead is that, you know, game passes coming

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:31.600
to switch and Nintendo games are coming to the Xbox series X. There you go. Dream the fuck on

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:37.840
with that one. All right, let's move on. Let's talk about, okay. I think that was finally

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:42.080
everything like E3 and summer game fast and all that stuff. Let's talk about our gaming

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:45.840
weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week. I think dark soccer stepped

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:48.960
away cause her camera's off. So Loki, I'll start with you. How was your gaming week?

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:56.640
It was incredible. So this week, as I talked about last week, I actually recorded my streaming

01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:05.520
session today with Tango from, from hermitcraft. So that was fun. We didn't really build a ton.

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:09.840
It was more of just kind of just sitting there and like chatting while we were just like trying

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:16.240
to place blocks. Cause like it's kind of silly. I brought them on and I'm like, so what I did

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:19.760
and this will be all into my video too when I, when I put it out.

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:32.800
So I had spent this entire week crafting a very immense redstone machine. So what it was is,

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:40.800
is this giant light board. It was that would scroll his logo across it and then freeze for

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:46.160
a second and then animate off. So it was like an animated like logo board thing. So I built that

01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:55.280
creative, brought it back into the server and built it in survival there. And then what I had

01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:02.000
planned to do, but I ran out of time was I was going to make a joke about how my gold farm

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.080
produces way too much gravel. So I was going to cover the whole thing in gravel and just like

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:13.200
kind of reveal it. There's a way you can kind of use scaffolding and stuff to drop gravel,

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:18.880
kind of like dropping a curtain or something like that. And so that was going to be the joke

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:23.840
is that, but instead I just showed it to him and what we were going to do is build the building

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:30.480
that was going to go around that. And so that's what we did. He's not much, he doesn't normally

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:36.640
do building so much. It's not like something he'll more like, you know, like making the redstone

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:42.480
systems and stuff like that. So we both kind of struggled like coming up, it was like

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:50.320
creative blockers and we're just like, so we ended up just kind of messing around for like,

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:54.320
you know, two hours or whatever. So I showed him around the server and everything, but yeah,

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:58.160
it was fun. I was picking his brain on like content creation stuff, his process and all that

01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:05.520
and just like, you know, getting tips on, you know, stuff. And so it was fun. It was, it was

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:11.920
nice. And then at the end, you know, it was basically like, Hey, I want to, you know,

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:17.440
you know, we're going to stay friends on discord, you know, you know, send me, you know, show me

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:21.280
what, you know, once you've finished the build, send me a screenshot, you know, and, you know,

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:24.960
keep me up to date with what you're doing and stuff like that. So like, awesome. I think that's

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:29.280
cool. Like I really enjoyed that. That's kind of what I was trying to get out of it. So it, yeah,

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:34.560
it was really cool. That was very nervous. Oh my God. I've been up to like two in the morning,

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:38.240
the last two days, because I've been trying to like cram everything into this time,

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:45.040
but like, it was just, it was so worth it. So that was basically what I did this week. Like I said,

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:50.320
I will be making a video with it. I don't know when it's going to be out yet. Cause I have to,

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:55.360
I want to finish the build that we started. Cause we got like part of a wall and then there's,

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:58.160
there's some funny stuff with that too. Like I don't want to spoil it, but like,

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:06.400
um, it was pretty funny when we noticed something in the, in the, yeah, fun times are had, but, um,

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:12.160
so yeah, it's, um, uh, I'm very much looking forward to putting it out. I still want to,

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:17.920
you know, keep going with the content creation stuff. Um, yeah, just going to get better.

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:21.840
Each episode I put out learning more, just learning from my mistakes,

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:25.200
that type of thing. So yeah, that's pretty much that. That's it. I hope he gives your

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.920
video a shout too. I hope you get that exposure. It's going to be great.

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:32.080
That would be amazing. I don't have any expectations for that though.

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:39.840
I would love that, but I absolutely wouldn't expect that at all. It's more of just like,

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:45.520
that would be cool, but like absolutely no expectations though. That said, if you do follow,

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:49.520
um, the Hermitcraft stuff, I think the next season's coming very soon.

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:55.760
He sort of hinted at that, but like, um, there is, uh, one of the guys on there,

01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:00.400
Ren dog, he put out his, uh, finale, which he edited together. He's a big Star Wars fan.

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:04.560
So his like built are all Star Wars theme. And so it's a great watch. He's like, did this big

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:08.720
old animated movie thing. So, um, that's worth checking out, but like, yeah, they're all great.

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:13.680
Like I just would, I would absolutely love that, but like that's so far in the future,

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:17.840
like that's so far in the future, but like, yeah, I, we had a great conversation about

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:23.040
pixel poops. Number two, that was fun. Oh, really? Oh, cool. He thought that was great.

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:27.840
Um, but yeah, yeah. Fun times. It was fun. I really enjoyed it.

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:30.240
Good, good, good. Happy to happy to hear it. Can't wait to see the video.

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:33.280
Um, dark soccer, let's go to you. How was your gaming week?

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:37.280
I actually did not play animal crossing at all.

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:40.240
But because you've played three times as much dead by daylight.

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:49.360
Um, maybe. Um, so yes, I have played a significant amount more of dead by daylight than

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:56.560
averaged than I usually do. Um, I've, I was supposed to start streaming on midnight Saturday,

01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:03.200
which I guess would have technically been the night Sunday morning. But, um, I busted my hand

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:10.000
in a really stupid way. So I don't know those on stream can see them all wrapped up. I, um,

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:16.800
I banged my hand on the door knob in the bathroom chasing after Midna. Oh, because she's a brat.

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:26.720
And I, it kind of felt better, you know, like not as bad because I guess it had gone numb.

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:32.560
And then, um, Friday night I, I went into urgent care and they thought it was broken,

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:38.720
uh, like one of the carpels was broken, but it ended up being a bone bruise. So that was good.

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:44.640
And after resting it all day yesterday, I, I'm probably gonna be back to streaming tonight. Um,

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:52.160
but yeah, lots of dead by daylight. Um, I am working on learning new characters. I might

01:23:52.160 --> 01:24:00.080
tackle Hagatha tonight. We'll see. Um, or I might tackle ghost face.

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:04.640
What do you think of the matchmaking they've been testing? Because, um, I know some of the

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:09.280
streamers I watch are kind of like, eh, but I gotta say like for me, like the matches I was,

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:12.880
I don't know if they're still doing it, but like the past couple of days I was playing the matches

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:17.600
I were getting were great. Like I was actually getting matched with people that were like around

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:22.880
my skill. Like I was playing a level one spirit to knock out some type of daily. And I actually

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:27.680
got a noob squad, which for me as a noob spirit, even if I was a level, what, like 13 killer or

01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:33.760
whatever I am was, was great. And so I was very happy with that. So I, I hope that met for me.

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:37.280
I thought I was like, Oh, this new metric is great. I'm not getting the bully squad.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:44.320
Yeah. Although I do have to say that beforehand, earlier in the week, I, I did, uh, sacrifice a

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:48.800
rank one survivor and that felt really good. Good job. Good. Congrats. Uh, Ninja, the monkey

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:56.320
and chat with my, my rank 17 self, uh, Ninja, the monkey and chat says, yeah, MMR has been awesome.

01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:02.480
Oh, Stella. Hi, Stella. Kitty. You want to play dead by daylight? Kitty. Okay.

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:13.440
But anyway, um, I have, I've been vastly, um, enjoying myself with the, the MMR. Um, I really,

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:21.120
it's nice being able to level with the group that I'm playing with and actually find myself getting

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:29.120
better. Although I'm pretty sure that if I hit, um, what is it that's right before red? Is it

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:35.680
green or purple? Purple? Yeah. I think I would want to stay like right in the purples. Um,

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:44.000
if I make it that far. Um, but, but I did, uh, actually get the full plague outfit from the, uh,

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:49.920
the rift. Nice. But I'm not going to use the mask on it because I like seeing her face and

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:57.760
having her be pretty fair enough. And, um, I've been playing board scapes and, um, I'm addicted,

01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:03.360
of course, because, you know, me, I'm a word nerd and it's turning right now. And for those

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:11.600
on stream who might see, I am level. I am ranked 10 on the tourney. So that makes me happy.

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:18.080
Even though it's like not worth anything. I like playing the stupid word game. Um,

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:23.760
I'm also playing Fantasia. Of course, that's my Tuesday night stream and I'm super enjoying

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:30.400
Fantasia. Um, the story is getting really good. Um, and for me pacing myself by playing just

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:38.320
little pieces of the story every week has made it kind of like tuning into a TV show a little bit.

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:42.800
I'm picking up the story like that. Fair. Some really, I'm really enjoying Fantasia.

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:49.360
All right. Anything else for your gaming week? Um, no. Um, my gaming week, I've been playing way

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:53.280
too much Final Fantasy 14. What else is new? I actually streamed on my own channel, I think twice

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:59.360
this week. Um, some Final Fantasy 14. Um, and my Ninja hit level 80. That didn't happen on stream.

01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:02.960
I think that happened yesterday. I wasn't streaming. Uh, but yeah, so I, I got another,

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:08.240
another class to 80. So I only have, I think three more to go. Black Mage, Monk, Warrior,

01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:12.880
I think is all I have that's left. So, um, that'll be, that'll be fun. I'm gonna work on that. That's

01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:20.320
for sure. Um, and then, uh, let's see, what else did I check out? Um, I also have been playing Dead

01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:26.480
by Daylight. Um, here's the crazy thing. Okay. So like, I got into Dead by Daylight to play Killer

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:31.120
because I was like, I don't know if I can play Survivor. The heartbeat stuff messes with me. I

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:34.640
don't know if I can do it, but then I just kind of like, I don't know. I was like, just get over it

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:39.680
and play Survivor. And I did. And I've been playing Survivor. I'm up to rank seven on Survivor.

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:46.320
Alan is not ranked seven. And I'm not saying that to rub it in, but I'm also saying it in a way to

01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:51.680
be like, how did I do this? I don't deserve, I don't deserve it because like, I don't, I only

01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:57.120
have Dwight's talents, Meg's talents. Those are the only two characters I've gotten to 40. And

01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:01.040
then I have some of the stuff that's been in the Shrine of Secrets, like the, a couple of Bill

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:05.120
talents, um, and maybe one other Survivor talent I grabbed from there. The Bill talents are pretty

01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:10.400
good. The Bill talents are very necessary, but, um, I have to throw this out here. Me who has never

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:16.080
played Survivor and has zero intent to play Survivor anytime soon. I bought Pebble.

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:20.320
That was the other talent that I got, was the Pebble. Yeah.

01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:22.960
I had to buy Pebble just because.

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:27.360
Um, but, uh, yeah. So I've been, I've been working on leveling up my Survivors,

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:30.960
but I don't know how the hell I hit rank seven. I really don't. Um, because I'm,

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:36.480
I'm terrible at looping killers still. It's like my big weak spot, but I am pretty good at not

01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:43.360
being found. That's where I'm, you know, uh, I I'm, I'm pretty good at the stealthy part of things.

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:47.680
Like I'm good at like working on a generator. Then like, as soon as like, I know the killer's close,

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:53.200
like crawling away around the wall and then out the window so that they can't see me, you know,

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:58.320
tiptoeing out the back doors. They can't see that I was there. Um, do you have David?

01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:01.840
That's the character I'm working on now. So David is level 28.

01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:10.560
Uh, you need, you need the no short cosmetic because I have an aesthetic game crush on dabs.

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:16.800
Yeah. He's, uh, and I call him dabs because he's British and that's a very valid nickname for David.

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:22.400
Um, but I've been getting random dailies. So I actually got Nia up to like six or seven because

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:27.040
I had two dailies for Nia. So I kind of had to do it. Um, and then I, I think I had somebody else.

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:32.320
I mean, the new entity. Yes. Yes. The new entity. Uh, so that's been my dead by daylight. I have

01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:38.480
yet to stream that game, but I will, I will, I will break the seal on that soon. Uh, I just,

01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:43.760
that will be when I play survivor. I will play with you. All right. All right. That'll be good.

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:48.960
I'm waiting for Jill. Well, I want to be, I want to be the totem bitch. So you're waiting

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:56.400
until Tuesday. Yeah. Pretty much maybe. Um, so yes, there's that. Uh, Ninja, the monkey says,

01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:01.120
come play with us, Rob. I will, but please, please keep in mind I'm ranked seven, but I'm not good.

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:06.400
Okay. So as long as we all have that expectation, then yes, I'll play. It's fine. All right. Um,

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:10.640
let's see what else, uh, for my gaming week. Oh, I should talk about something new. So I played,

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:18.400
um, on Xbox series X fantasy star online to new Genesis came out this week. Um, and so I downloaded

01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:23.680
that and I checked that out. I'm not very far into it where my opinions are really full fledged

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:27.840
right now. So I don't, I'm not going to really give you like these, this is my final thought.

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:33.280
It is also struggling a little bit with a lot of the things that every new MMO goes through. And

01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:39.600
that is lag servers are getting hit crazy, you know, that sort of thing. So I'm, I'm going to

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:43.040
give them the benefit of the doubt and a little more time to work that stuff out, especially

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:47.680
cause the game is free. Um, this isn't like a game I paid $60 for like, you know, the mass effect

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:54.640
remaster, uh, where they're still patching it. Um, so, uh, yeah. Fantasy star online to new Genesis.

01:30:54.640 --> 01:31:00.560
I do like that this, uh, the, the prologue that I've been playing, I think makes for a much better

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:07.200
tutorial than throwing 10,000 quests at you like original fantasy star online to does. Um, the only

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:12.080
downside I can really think of is that I tried to make a new character, man. There's some ugly

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:16.000
characters in that game. There's I could not make a good looking character. So I went, I,

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:20.720
you can import like your PSO two character and that's what I did. And that looked much better.

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:25.760
So, uh, yeah. So I was playing a little bit of that and, uh, I'll give you a more fully

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:29.680
real light cause I'm only like level four or five. So, and I feel like I'm still a tutorial,

01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:33.920
so I don't really have full fledged opinions yet. Um, but that is a game I'm, I've been sinking a

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:39.600
little bit of time into. Um, although I lost a good 15, 20 minutes of progress because apparently

01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:44.960
if you don't get to a certain point in the prologue, you roll all the way back to an

01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:49.120
important story, story points that kind of irritated me, but it is what it is.

01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:55.280
So that was my gaming week. All right. Uh, I know we usually do, uh, the gaming week at the top of

01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:59.920
the show, but we had all of that, uh, you know, E3 and summer game Fest news that now we're to

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:05.040
the point of the show where we're going to get into this very familiar, lovely segment. Let's

01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:21.920
do the bump. And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:27.280
and pull out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:32.720
But I believe dark soccer is putting a twist on it this week, right? Dark soccer.

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:40.880
I am. We're, we're doing this thing. All right. Tell us about it. It's a flag.

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:47.440
A flag. And here it is. What's the, uh, for those who don't know, flag is a fucking weird

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:55.600
arcade game. And I have picked a ticket spitter because it's fucking weird. The game is called

01:32:55.680 --> 01:33:00.800
stinky feet. There's not really a whole lot to say, to say about this one. Um, you can have

01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:08.160
either a single player mode or a four person mode, but basically you sit on a toilet seat

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:13.360
and you fire water. Oh, I didn't even see that there was a toilet seat you sat on because

01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:17.200
whoever filmed this YouTube lovely put their finger over the lens. A little,

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:24.480
a little crazy anyway. Sorry. But anyway, you fire water at these people stinky ass feet

01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:29.760
and these people are holding their own nose in the bathtub and you are shooting water at their,

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:36.720
at their stink ass feet while you're sitting on a toilet who puts their fucking toilet in front of

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:46.080
their tub. I mean, really, that's kind of stupid, but anyway, it's a stupid game. It's fucking weird

01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:57.200
game and it's put out by, uh, Betson. Um, I believe, oh, maybe that's just who's, who's

01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:07.760
trying to sell it, but, um, it's, it's just fucking weird. I have nothing else I can say

01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:11.600
about it other than it's fucking weird. What Loki you sound like you have a comment on this.

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:18.240
I had to ask if you're sitting on a toilet seat and spraying something at feet, is it

01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:25.600
is it dark? Sakura, the $10,000 question of the week. Is it P

01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:33.600
bitch? Maybe I have to read the blurb though from this, so I'm just going to read it verbatim. Okay.

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:41.280
It's fun, exciting, different and simple. Gameplay that works. Stinky feet is a hilarious

01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:46.640
multi target water race game that is great for all ages. And do you know how those feet got stinky?

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:55.360
Let me finish doing my cutesy announcer voice, please. Yes. Thank you. Follow the light pattern

01:34:55.360 --> 01:35:01.360
to win. It has a unique bathtub theme. Every gun is a replica of a bathtub faucet and the seats

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:10.640
resemble toilets. You can also link five to 12 units. I don't know how many people

01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:18.320
like a stinky family feet. Where do you come from? Resident evil seven.

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:25.440
All right. Um, let's get some of the comments on this segment from our chat room. Uh,

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:31.040
in no particular order, we have the heck what is happening? I need an adult. What the fuck?

01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:37.600
Okay. Then I need an adult in all caps. I can't even carnival game. Good Lord. He, he, he,

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:42.560
and it's actually not water. It's light, but you pretend dark soccer. Your look is giving

01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:47.760
me Kathy Griffin vibes. There you go. I am. Yeah, I think that's a compliment.

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:53.760
I can't go bad with that. No way. Although I am holding, I'll look at the camera cause I'm wearing

01:35:53.760 --> 01:36:00.800
my ACE pride makeup. Um, and while she's doing that, uh, dark Tetsuya says didn't ever expect

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:05.040
flag of the month to go this way. Do you, do you know what this, do you know what the segment is?

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:08.960
Are you new here? Are you new here? Dark, dark Tetsuya.

01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:15.760
It's called the fucking arcade game of the month. I almost did a game called shoot the poop,

01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:20.800
but I'm not going to do that one. Uh, and VG realness who paid you the, uh,

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:25.840
Kathy Griffin compliment has a followed up with gorge in response to your makeup.

01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:30.000
Thank you. How about that? All right. I'll send you some Oreos.

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:36.000
There it is. You're fucking weird arcade game of the month. That's a thing. Cause Canada doesn't

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.400
have the crazy flavors we do, right? That's for the record. I have to digress a little bit and

01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:50.400
talk about these Thai Lay's chips that I got that are chestnut flavored. They're sweet. Oh wow.

01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:55.840
Fucking delicious. Sounds good. I'll get you some. All right. Yeah. And I don't know what,

01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:59.920
what kind of get you. I just remember I can't get you anything with peanut butter. Right. So,

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:06.400
um, there's a million flavors at the store. Lemon cream, I think right now. Oh yeah. Yeah.

01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:09.280
Now they're getting the point where they're kind of cycling through the same flavors.

01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:13.520
They won't really see new ones anymore. So yeah, but I don't think I ever sent you lemon,

01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:18.640
so we'll have to work on that one. All right. Uh, my, I think a really good one right now is

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:21.440
that there's like a strawberry one. Is it strawberry donut or something like that?

01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:24.960
It's a pretty good one. Yeah. It was like a strawberry donut one. I haven't tried that.

01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:29.840
Okay. So I don't know. That might be gone by now, but anyway, uh, one thing I wanted to say,

01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:33.200
by the way, before we get back into rapid fire news. So I was checking out while, um,

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:36.800
we, some of you guys were talking and doing the segment, I was checking out this arcade cabinet.

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:41.600
If you missed, uh, about 30 minutes ago, Alan brought in this mini, uh, Street Fighter two

01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:46.960
arcade cab into the studio. And I was like, why does it have this giant ass wire to plug in?

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:50.080
Well, the deal is, and it's on the back of the box. I don't know if you can see it.

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:55.920
You can actually hook two of these machines together through the wire. Cause it's street

01:37:55.920 --> 01:38:02.240
fighter. Right? So, and it only has one joy. So it actually has a link cable. It has a link cable,

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:06.560
like it's a fucking game boy. Oh my goodness. So you link the two machines together, right?

01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:13.600
So there you go. I don't know if it's $50 worth of rad for a game that, you know, but it is,

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:18.400
it is bigger. So if you remember the mini cabs that are at my house, this is definitely bigger.

01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:22.560
I don't know. Like they actually, they don't just have the screen, but they have that whole

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:27.040
decoration that shows all the world warriors like around it. So that's kind of, Oh, it's champion

01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:33.600
edition. So I get to play the, uh, bosses too. That's kind of cool. Yeah. Wow. Head to head play

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:38.240
by linking two devices. I can't believe 20, 20, 21. And my husband just bought me a device with

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:44.800
the link cable. Love it. All right. Anyhow, uh, let's get into some rapid fire news. So believe

01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:48.800
it or not, we had all of these announcements, announcements, announcements, uh, from digital

01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:52.080
media events, but there were other things that happened in the industry too. Let's talk about

01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:55.520
some of them pretty quickly here. Loki, I think you have a couple of quick, quick headlines,

01:38:55.520 --> 01:39:01.760
right? Yes. Uh, so game builder garages have mentioned came out this week and they do have

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:06.720
a demo available on the switch. So if you want to check it out, you probably should do that.

01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:11.520
Cause it looks pretty awesome. I have yet to recreate pixel hoops number two in it yet.

01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:21.840
Um, but that may be coming because why not? Um, and then, um, well, yeah, hopefully you can

01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:26.400
download the demo because they've had a recent firmware update that actually prevents, uh,

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:35.440
downloading games after the update. Um, there are some errors with it, but, um, I don't know if it's

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:43.680
a lot of systems that were affected by it, but, you know, hopefully they will be, um, getting

01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:49.280
that updated soon. I think I saw Flaco tweeting about that. Oh, sorry. Flaco hope you're able to

01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:58.480
fix it. Yeah. So, um, keep out, keep an eye out for that. And then, um, last but not least also,

01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:02.480
there was some announcements during the summer games fest, um, talking about, you know,

01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:08.080
Netflix series again that they have, um, the cuphead series don't deal with the devil

01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:13.520
that Wayne Brady is going to be King dice in that, which I think is some pretty good casting

01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:19.920
actually. Um, it looks interesting. So we'll check that out when that, uh, series eventually

01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:23.760
hits Netflix. Yeah. That cuphead series looks pretty cool. I mean, which of course the game

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:27.280
has amazing art direction. It lends itself very well to a show like that. So it looked very,

01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:30.880
very cool to me. Well, it's based off old cartoons. So it makes sense that, you know,

01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:35.920
yeah, it looks like an old cartoon now. Exactly. A new old cartoon, uh, dark Sakura. How about

01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:43.520
you? What do you have for us? Oh, a couple of things. Um, so, uh, oh my God, I just completely

01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:51.360
lost where I was. So today there was a really, really fun dead by daylight tournament. Um,

01:40:52.080 --> 01:41:00.720
it was called raft con. It was organized by, uh, hydro. Um, and, uh, it was just really,

01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:04.800
really a lot of fun. It was all for charity. It was a raising money for the Trevor project,

01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:10.960
which they exceeded $2,000. I want to say it was something like around 2100,

01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:15.520
a little bit past that. Um, and it was really exciting. I mean, it was, I mean,

01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:20.640
if you're into depth by daylight, that is, it was, there was some kind of real male biter moments.

01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:27.920
Um, and, uh, it ended up, uh, killer side, uh, losing color one, which honestly, I don't think

01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:32.800
anyone was really surprised about that one. He's, he's pretty hardcore. Awesome. A nurse.

01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:41.440
I heard he had to do a pretty big match as hag though. Yes. So this one, well, it was the finals,

01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:47.680
the start of the finals, which were two matches, uh, each, uh, the other one in the finals was,

01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:56.240
uh, Laurie bird, who also was, uh, a nurse main. And, uh, they had, uh, Hawkins,

01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:02.640
which is terrible for nurse, right? I mean, it's also terrible for a lot of people, but I digress.

01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:12.080
Um, so losing color went, uh, the path of hag, which worked out great. And, uh,

01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:21.040
Laurie bird went the path of twins that worked out not so great. Um, but the, uh, the survivor team

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:30.640
that one was, uh, the mod squad, which, um, honestly, everybody did such a good, uh, a good

01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:37.760
job. Haslin's team did a really good job. I was really impressed by just the overall skill. And

01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:42.800
this would be like, if I were better at the game, this is the kind of matches I would want to do

01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:50.000
because they're just really engrossing and just really fun to participate in. And I, I, I had

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.760
a great time watching. I was really invested. I hope they put some of the highlights up on

01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:57.680
YouTube. My only complaint, and I understand why they did it today because it's pride month and

01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:02.000
everything, but my only complaint is that they chose the E three day to do it. And it's like,

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:05.200
there's all these big pressers and I've got, I've got to pay attention to them, right? I have

01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:08.960
nothing to talk about tonight. Um, so I hope some of those matches are on YouTube because I'd still

01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:14.960
love to be able to support it somehow. It was like 65 different, um, streamers involved in it.

01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:23.200
And like some of the people who, I mean, I watch regularly, uh, mithril onion, um, a good streamer,

01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:31.200
King Bay, you watch all 65. I don't watch all of them. Uh, are you sure I, again, you guys,

01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:37.040
I cannot go in to a dead by daylight channel and not suddenly see dark soccer pipe up and chat.

01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:40.560
I might even be like, who's this new person I've never watched before. Oh, this is an interesting

01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:45.440
stream. And then all of a sudden dark soccer, OLR, like, hi, good play or whatever comment

01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:50.240
she's making. I'm like, my God, she's everywhere. No, but I, I say that with love. You know,

01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:52.960
I say that with absolute and total love. I love that you're so into it.

01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:57.840
Well, I mean, but like a lot of the ones in here that are, that I'm like the most

01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:03.520
hangout in would be like Kilcannon and King Bay and, uh, uh, Twilight King, Nick and Prince.

01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:09.200
I mean, just really, but I was really impressed as far as the survivors go. And not just because

01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:16.400
I really enjoy watching Le Pen and think he's a fantastic just person, but the way Le Pen did,

01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:22.480
uh, Kate and was so good at hiding and not being found at all.

01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:24.880
Ah, that's, that's, that's my style. Yeah. I love that.

01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:31.280
Yeah. I was really impressed. Um, and still being able to, to participate with other,

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:35.200
you know, go to do rescues, do gens, do everything. So I was pretty impressed.

01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:38.640
Dark soccer. Will you help me convince Chad Starsick to play the game already?

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:43.680
Well, it's on game pass. He can play it.

01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:49.200
I I'm actually kind of floored that, that he's not.

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:51.520
Yeah, I know. I know. All right.

01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:55.360
But anyway, um, the last thing I'm going to say about this is congrats to,

01:44:55.360 --> 01:45:01.280
to everybody who participated. Thank you for doing such good work for charity and putting

01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:07.280
on an amazing show. Thank you to Hydro for, for organizing everything. And I,

01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:14.720
I really am just so impressed. I really love the way the communities come together for great cause.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.520
Um, props to everybody. Yeah. A lot of names I recognize too.

01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:27.600
The next thing is, is pertinent to my interest because her. So there's a new

01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:32.160
Castlevania series that Netflix is going to release that stars Richter Belmont,

01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:36.880
which makes me super happy because then it's all Dracula X, uh, stuff. So of course,

01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:43.680
there's Maria Renard, um, who is, uh, his sister-in-law cause you know, he,

01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:49.280
and well, and Richter is a descendant of Saifa and Trevor. I mean, cause all the rest of the

01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:58.720
Belmonts are, so I am really hoping just the whole thing is, uh, Dracula X related. I mean,

01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:04.960
I don't know if we're going to have little Maria, which would be funny cause they, um,

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:10.880
and of course the, all thing is, is during the French revolution as well. Um, but I'm just super,

01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:17.840
super happy because Richter is my, my favorite Belmont and the Dracula X and Dracula XX

01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:22.400
Nocturne in the Moonlight. Those are like two of my favorite games.

01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:29.120
All right. Lots of good stuff, lots of good stuff in that Netflix event. That's for sure.

01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:34.400
All right. Let's go travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out

01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:40.160
this week in world release dates. Uh, Loki, I had one more thing to mention. My bad. Go for it.

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:47.840
Yeah. Cause I had forgotten to, um, it has been confirmed from a release by steel series. Um,

01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:54.960
that for the resident evil chapter for dead by daylight, it has confirmed that, uh, there are

01:46:54.960 --> 01:47:03.440
legendary, uh, cosmetics for Leon and Jill that will have, uh, uh, Chris, uh, and Claire.

01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:11.920
Oh, cool. Yeah. So they, they are con it had been hinted before dbd leaks, uh, made a mention of it,

01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:18.960
but, um, steel series, let the whole cat out of the bag that it's, uh, they're legendaries.

01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:24.000
We'll get maybe, maybe Shane getting to play as Chris. Maybe we'll finally break them. Who knows?

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.440
And I'll just read it says the resident evil collection available via the end game store

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:32.640
includes two legendary sets for Leon and Jill that bring Chris and Claire Redfield into the fog.

01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:37.600
Which version of Chris, apparently this is very important to Shane. I would imagine it's the re

01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:40.960
two remake, right? Cause that's, that's what the nemesis are based off of. Right?

01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:49.040
Well, I mean, Chris wasn't in re two, so it would probably be, um, I would reckon the first one,

01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:54.800
but I mean, but keep in mind they're, they're going to do more and more cosmetics for it.

01:47:54.800 --> 01:48:02.000
So I'm sure we would get a village Chris before too long. All right. So you can get your gruff

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:12.080
buff and a tough, uh, grizzled, uh, daddy, Chris. All right. I'm just going to call him daddy, Chris.

01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:17.040
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. Uh, we'll start in the U S Loki.

01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:23.360
It's a slow week. It was a huge week this last week. So yeah. And really,

01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:28.720
we're only getting two games that are being ported over to the, um, the new gen systems.

01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:33.760
So we've got, uh, the elder scrolls online. It's getting a dedicated PlayStation five and

01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:39.280
Xbox series X version and Metro Exodus complete edition is also coming to PlayStation five and

01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:44.480
Xbox series X. That's it. Uh, it looks a little light in Japan this week as well. Uh,

01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:50.320
Japan is getting a game on the switch called Bakumatsu Orenka Shin segumi, uh, is out this

01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:56.160
week. And I am not familiar with this franchise. It is from D three. Is that Shinsengumi? Uh, yeah.

01:48:56.160 --> 01:49:00.960
All one word. Yeah. Yeah. So she's saying, uh, so it's a new, I think based off of a newer

01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:07.040
anime series, I've seen some cosplay stuff out for it yet, but I mean, the Shinsengumi

01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:13.120
was like a real group, like during the, the whole Meiji period. Um, and there's like,

01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:17.440
they've been in like a bajillion anime, manga, comic books, just different iterations of

01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:21.840
characters based on Shinsengumi. Looking at this description too, it looks like this is an older

01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:26.000
release. That's kind of like a high res for the switch. So it's kind of like a rerelease for

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:31.040
switch because yeah, then when I look at the PlayStation four, it's pretty dry this week and

01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:37.440
the PlayStation five in Japan this week, uh, that red controller, uh, is out. Uh, but that's really

01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:42.160
it it's otherwise it's a very slow week in Japan as well. How about the UK dark soccer? Is any

01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:49.040
different there? Eh, not really. Um, so what we have, oh gosh, I scrolled too far because, uh,

01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:55.680
British States are a little bit different than how ours are listed. So, um, what we have is on

01:49:55.680 --> 01:50:03.760
the 17th, we have rogue book for PC. On the 18th, we have Vader immortal, a star Wars VR series.

01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:12.400
And, uh, that's about it. Excellent. All right. Uh, let's get a few more stories in here. Some

01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:17.120
other things going on. Um, I guess this next story is kind of about E3, right Loki, but it's,

01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:23.440
it's something everybody's talking about. It's really stupid. Um, it's, it, I, I think it's the

01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:31.600
authentic E3 experience, but at home. So we've complained about E3 in the past and how you have

01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:36.800
media credentials, but you're not really media because they're, you know, only going to let

01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:42.560
certain media outlets look at this stuff. Well, that's what, um, the ESA is basically saying

01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:51.200
regarding, uh, co-streaming some of the E3 events is that they have a short list of exclusive, uh,

01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:58.400
well, basically folks that are approved to, you know, actually broadcast that stuff and that,

01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:04.880
um, they don't really authorize anybody else to do it. I'm thinking that it could be that

01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:09.520
they're white listing those so that they don't get copyright claimed, or maybe it could be just that,

01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:14.400
you know, they want to be responsible for if you're co-streaming and you get,

01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:19.840
you know, DMCA copyright claimed or something like that, but you can hold the ESA responsible,

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:26.400
like anyone would actually think to do that. But I don't know. To me, it seems like it's more of just

01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:34.880
like, you know, they, um, they're being dicks. Well, E3 is just behind the curve. You get the

01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:39.760
sense that the ESA is not run by people that are current on their technology. And that is very,

01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:44.160
this is something I've called them out on before is that for the type of organization they are,

01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:47.920
they should know their shit when it comes to technology. And it really feels like they don't.

01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:54.240
And it's very frustrating because am I, am I, am I incorrect that they leaked more data again from

01:51:54.240 --> 01:52:00.480
their registration database this time? I thought I heard that was the thing this year. Chat,

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:06.480
please feel free to jump in and help me recall. Um, yeah, I don't remember if that happened,

01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:10.480
but they basically black compat says yes. And as she says, they did. That's what I thought.

01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:13.040
And so it's one of those things where it's like, well, thank God, I didn't sign up to be your

01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:16.640
partner to stream. Cause you would have just given out my address. You would have doxed me

01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:24.000
in exchange. So it's like, I, the ESA just needs to grow the fuck up in a lot of ways. I know that

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:29.760
sounds very rude. Um, and yeah, it's rude. Um, because I think for what they're supposed to be

01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:34.000
for this industry, it's very frustrating that they're just, they're lagging behind and all

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:39.600
these different ways. Like wake up, have you ever watched a Twitch stream ESA? Do you know what

01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:43.680
co-streaming is? Here's, here's what they said. They made it, maybe they're walking it back a

01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:48.480
little bit, but they said that basically that there was over 1300 submissions. They only

01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:55.600
approved less than a hundred creators for the brands for official co-streaming. They said that

01:52:55.600 --> 01:53:00.880
the, um, unauthorized streams are still welcome to co-stream, but it won't be in the official

01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:07.200
capacity, whatever that means. So the, so it is less about being concerned about the DMCA and

01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:14.080
more of them being dicks. I mean, that's really, they just completely made that clear is that.

01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:19.360
I, I also, I also think it's ridiculous that like, you know, they had to have, okay. So like,

01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:23.920
let's say the Square Enix thing was streamed on Twitch gaming, but they had to strip out all the

01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:28.080
licensed music for the Twitch gaming thing because the musical industry might come after them

01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:34.320
otherwise. Like we need to then stop putting, stop helping the music industry by putting licensed

01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:41.360
music in trailers. Like I want to see the game industry fight the fuck back, like stop putting

01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:44.480
licensed music in trailers, then fine. You don't want us to use your music. We won't use it.

01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:50.480
And I, they need to push back on that stuff because it's ridiculous. Like what the music,

01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:54.240
and, and I said this a little bit on Bobby show. I think the thing that pisses me off the most,

01:53:54.240 --> 01:53:57.680
I swear to God, if I ever ran for public office, which I don't think I would ever do,

01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:03.680
but, um, I, I, this would be the, I would ban these bot claims. I would say robots should not

01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:09.440
be filing copyright claims. People should be filing copyright claims because that way you can

01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:14.800
measure intent. And I think that's a huge part of what this is. Like, yes, if you're running a

01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:18.560
stream where you're willfully just like playing music on demand and all this stuff, then you

01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:23.920
probably should be stricken down and not be on Twitch. But you know what? Oh my God, I accidentally

01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:28.480
played, you know, Grand Theft Auto and streamed like two seconds of a Guns N' Roses song or

01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:32.400
something. Like you should not lose your whole fucking wellbeing online because something like

01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:37.840
that. We need reform on this law. What do you think got me into making my own music?

01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:42.960
We have a government that can't do shit right now. And it's so far like, I'm like, well,

01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:45.200
we need the government to solve the copyright, but they're not going to.

01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:51.760
No, this is, they're not going to, especially when it works out for them. I mean,

01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:57.520
it's just, it's just stupid. Anyway. Um, let's see. Um, Chad starts again,

01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:00.160
chat says stripping out the music from the guardians of the galaxy trailer would have

01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:05.280
taken like 50% of the neatness away from it. Guess what? I saw it without any of the music

01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:11.680
because I was watching on the, um, Twitch gaming thing. So I didn't see it with the music.

01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:17.040
What they should do is replace all. They should have a database of really bad recorder

01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:27.040
covers of all of these songs and just replace them all. Let's see. So, uh,

01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:31.760
as she went into Matt is also clarifying what happened with the, the press information on the

01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:37.200
press site for E3, you can search fellow press people and look at their profile that had their

01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:42.160
personal info like phone numbers, personal emails, et cetera. Oh, cause I'm sure nobody

01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:48.240
had their password as password one, two, three, or, you know, the, the, the answer to one of those

01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:52.720
Facebook memes going around or something like, I'm sure, I'm sure your information was super safe.

01:55:52.720 --> 01:56:00.560
It was, it was only available to other press. Um, black and Pat in chat says their initial

01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:05.840
statement because I got the same email as Jeff was to beware and co-stream at your own risk

01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:10.960
of terms of service violations on the platform you choose. And I would think that the ESA,

01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:17.200
if they were an industry that is truly represents the gaming industry and gaming culture would be

01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:22.720
pushing back on the music industry, or at least trying to come to some sort of agreement on this

01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:26.000
so that we don't have to suffer, but the ESA doesn't give a fuck about us.

01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:30.480
Hmm. And that's the reality. They care about their bottom line.

01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:38.720
They care about the money that they can make and removing any form of it's all about control.

01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:44.320
It really is about controlling the whole thing. Uh, and black and Pat says, as a result,

01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:50.080
I canned co-streaming the Xbox briefing today for safety. Now on one hand, uh, Microsoft did

01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:53.920
kind of give express permission on their own. However, that being said, I don't blame you.

01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:56.880
I absolutely don't blame you. You don't want to take the risk. Why take the risk?

01:56:56.880 --> 01:57:00.720
Especially when you we've just acknowledged earlier in the show, you've worked very hard

01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:05.520
on your channel to this point where you're about to become a Twitch partner. If anybody

01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:08.800
that looks at your application has a brain, you're going to be a Twitch partner.

01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:15.920
And, um, you know, and this, this whole thing. And, uh, I like they, they, they lost you

01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:20.960
beak out of this whole fear thing. And I think that's a, that's a, that's a really unfortunate

01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:25.280
thing. Cause I know, I know you gals are big Xbox fans, you big, huge supporters of Microsoft,

01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:29.680
uh, from day one, they, they really miss something by not having you co-stream today.

01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:34.800
And it's because of, and it's not Microsoft's fault. It's not your fault. It's all this other

01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:38.560
fuckery. And at the end of the day, you want to, you don't want to lose what you've built.

01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:45.680
And I get that. I totally get that. Um, let's see, uh, tiger claw and chat says,

01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:49.440
streaming the guardians of the galaxy game is going to be difficult due to the game having

01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:53.920
licensed music. Won't you be able to, didn't they say something about a streamer safe mode

01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:57.920
or am I, I might be thinking of a different game, but that is an interesting thing we're in now is

01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:02.640
that games have to have streamer safe modes and two soundtracks. Because again, we can't work

01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:06.080
our shit out with the music industry. You would think that they would just,

01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:10.720
they would save money, not even having the licensed music in there. I know it compromises

01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:17.360
their vision, I guess, but yeah, you can save money. They like to save money, right?

01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:27.520
Yeah. Yeah. All right. Um, Phoenix 7726 says, I'm not saying boycotting E3 is a wise idea,

01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:31.600
but well, it's going to be interesting to see what happens when they come back.

01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:39.120
And let's, let's also keep in mind this week was not just about E3. We also had summer game fest.

01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:44.960
We also had several independent things that were rising up. And, you know, obviously I said summer

01:58:44.960 --> 01:58:49.360
game fest had some of its own issues, but there was also a lot of positives about that event.

01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:55.840
And so maybe E3 is starting to get a little bit of competition. And I think that's a very good

01:58:55.840 --> 01:59:02.400
thing at this point, to be honest. Yeah. Anyway. All right. Um, let's move on. Speaking of

01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:06.480
Microsoft stuff, I think this is very exciting and something I'm kind of surprised they didn't really

01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:12.960
talk a lot about, um, at the event today was they didn't really get into xCloud and how that's all

01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:16.320
going to work or any of that, but I guess maybe they're going to save that for a special event or

01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:22.640
something like that, but there are Xbox video gaming, video games, streaming sticks that are

01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:27.840
going to be on the way. So a few days before the whole live event, uh, apparently some executives

01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:33.520
sat down to talk about what's going on here. Uh, there was a little, uh, prerecorded media thing

01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:39.760
between Phil Spencer and, uh, Stan Nadella, uh, who was talking about game pass and Azure and all

01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:45.680
that, and then talked about how Xbox is working with TV manufacturers around the world to get

01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:50.640
game pass on TVs, which makes a lot of sense. Um, I think PlayStation had a thing with some,

01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:56.320
well, there is probably Sony TVs, but I think PlayStation was on some TVs like that whole, um,

01:59:56.320 --> 02:00:00.320
is it placed? Yeah. PlayStation now I think it was on some TVs, but so it would make a lot of

02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:05.200
sense that Xbox goes there too. Um, if you have game pass ultimate, you're going to have the cloud

02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:09.840
ability. And so you'd be able to play Xbox titles with just a controller. So you have your Xbox

02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:14.320
controller, you hook it up to the little streaming stick and bang. Now you have the cloud. I love

02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:19.120
this idea because this means I'll be able to play video games in the bedroom, uh, from my series X

02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:23.440
in the living room. I think this is great. I hope the sticks aren't too expensive, but I don't see

02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:27.280
why they would be. So yeah, they're developing standalone streaming devices. You can plug into

02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:31.920
your TV or monitor. So it sounds a lot like a Chromecast. Um, so I think this sounds awesome.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:36.320
And I, I can't wait to check this out. So is this streaming from your Xbox

02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:43.600
series X or is this just streaming through, uh, X cloud streaming from the web?

02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:51.840
My understanding is both exist. Uh, and that, that I'm not sure which of the two it is here,

02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:57.440
but I think you can choose which it is. I think one is called one thing and one is called the

02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:03.040
other. I think when you're doing like Xbox cloud gaming and that, that is like in the cloud,

02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:07.120
but when you're doing Xbox, I think there's something like play anywhere or something

02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:13.760
like that. That's when you can play from your series X. Yeah. So we'll see, uh, dark soccer.

02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:21.120
What do you have for us? Well, uh, hackers gonna hack and Steelers gonna steal. So, um,

02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:28.000
they have stolen the source code to FIFA 2021 and EA's Frostbite engine.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:34.000
You mean like FIFA 19? Yeah. Anyway, um,

02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:42.880
on a few of the different, um, hacking forums, um, uh, it was found that they had taken

02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:52.000
more than 780 gigabytes of data from EA. Um, and according to the screenshots that were shown,

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:59.120
it includes the source code for FIFA 2021 and, uh, source code and tools for the Frostbite game

02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:06.320
engine. Um, and other assets look like different software development kits and they're trying to,

02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:14.320
of course, sell these assets. Um, so they said that no data player data had been accessed,

02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:20.400
so there's no risk to the player privacy, but, um, they've tried to plug up that whole really

02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:25.200
quickly. Um, and of course, I mean, it's not the first time this has happened. Um,

02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:32.720
CD project red got a ransomware attack earlier in the year. Um, and they eventually, uh, sold

02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:40.880
the source code to that game too. Um, but now EA is saying that they're not going to be affected

02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:47.280
the same way, but that remains to be seen. Well, I saw an article that it's like completely

02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:52.080
speculative. I think it's more of like, I wish this would happen. Um, where they're saying that

02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:56.480
they could dig through the source code for like, say FIFA or something like that, to see how

02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:02.080
they use loot boxes and whatever to manipulate people into spending money on that stuff.

02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:08.000
Expose them, basically, they're never going to do that. They're, they're in it for the ransom

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:14.800
and that's it. There's no white hat, white hat hackers in that group at all. I'm assuming.

02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:20.160
Although if someone did want to say, pay for said source code, right.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:26.400
And then use, use that knowledge for an altruistic purpose.

02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:27.300
Maybe.

02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:30.560
No, they're selling it for 28 million.

02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:32.880
I don't have 28 million.

02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:36.960
Well, especially with all the, um, you know, things that, especially with all the things

02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:41.040
that EA kind of sells, like the FIFA cards and things like that, if somebody got the source code,

02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:46.560
they could really exploit that. Um, I would think, and, uh, kind of build a black market

02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:50.000
of fake stuff. You know what I mean? It could be very interesting.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.560
Or maybe they could fix a mass effect Andromeda.

02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:54.560
Isn't that the truth?

02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:57.920
Anyhow, a few more stories for you guys.

02:03:57.920 --> 02:03:58.420
Loki.

02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:05.440
All right. So I've, I'm honestly not surprised at all. I'm surprised it took this long.

02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:10.560
So we have a story about Roblox being sued by music publishers for $200 million

02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:15.600
regarding, um, illegal use of songs from numerous artists.

02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:23.200
I've seen so many games on Roblox that my kids play. They just have like all this licensed music,

02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:27.280
just all over the place. Cause it's kid, kids making it a lot of times and they don't know.

02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:32.720
They're just like, whatever, it's mine. I can put it in there. It's just, it's all over the place.

02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:39.600
So apparently the national music publishers association is suing them, um, that they're

02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:43.600
making hundreds of millions of dollars by requiring users to pay every time that they

02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:48.400
upload music onto the platform or that they should be making, um, them pay that.

02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:53.680
Um, so they said it points out some of the major artists affected Ariana Grande,

02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:59.120
Imagine Dragons Deadmau5, it's, it's everything. It's everything. Seriously. It's, it's all over

02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:05.760
the place. Like, and it's not even necessarily just music. It's IP as well. There's so much IP

02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:14.080
theft on there. It's just, it's very unregulated. Well, it will be soon. Right?

02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:19.440
That's a good way to do it. It's a wild west for right now, but that's going to be locked

02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:26.240
down pretty fast. Teach the kids the lessons early. Unfortunately. Intellectual property

02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:30.080
got to smack it down. This one, you know, it's funny, even though I was very critical of like

02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:33.680
the music industry and needing to modernize a little bit ago, this one, I'm a little more

02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:37.200
sympathetic to them on because there's the clear difference here is that a lot of these Roblox

02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:42.640
add-ons are being sold, uh, for money and all that. So I kind of think, yeah, the music industry

02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:46.880
kind of has a right to step, but I, again, I, maybe they're very frustrated and they're suing

02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:51.440
all of Roblox because they can't bought it. They can't find this stuff through bots. So they're

02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:55.760
just like, we're going to sue Roblox into oblivion. Well, this is exactly what happened

02:05:55.760 --> 02:06:02.720
to YouTube. And so it's basically, if they don't have a process where it's regulated like this,

02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:06.800
it's gonna, they're going to lock it down. It could be like Twitch where we end up seeing,

02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:11.360
I don't think they're going to like ban you. I mean, they could ban users, I guess, but like,

02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:14.800
I don't think it's going to, it's more of just like removing the offending content.

02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:18.240
And a lot of the games out there that have like a lot of the slices of music thrown in,

02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:23.040
it's just, they're like trash, but I don't think it's any like more of the popular games that are

02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:27.680
doing this. It's more of just like all the trash that people make because anybody can make stuff

02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:33.680
and post games on Roblox. It's just kids that do that just think, oh, well,

02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:37.040
I'm going to go to YouTube and I'm going to steal the sound effect, or I'm going to go to YouTube

02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:41.200
and I'm going to steal this music and throw it in there. And they don't, they don't know. They

02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:50.080
don't know anything about, you know, their IP and stuff like that. So yeah, like I said, I said this

02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:54.400
months ago that this is bound to happen. So yeah, here we are.

02:06:55.040 --> 02:07:00.480
Here we are. All right. Last tonight, before we get to emails and all that other good stuff,

02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:04.240
we have a very interesting promotion coming from Jackbox Games because of course they have

02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:11.280
Jackbox Party Pack 7 to promote. So apparently in the next week, Jackbox is going to be letting you

02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:18.080
hire free practice friends. What are practice? Yeah, you get practice friends and what they're

02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:21.840
going to do, they're going to remind you what it's like to be around other people.

02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:28.480
You sign up and you get to compete for time slots, and then you get 30 minutes of judgment free

02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:35.920
Jackbox Party Pack game time. And so the Jackbox Party Pack folks, they all must be hired improv

02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:40.320
actors or something. They're going to help you remember how to interact with people because,

02:07:40.320 --> 02:07:44.880
you know, it's been a long 15 months. But I don't plan on interacting with people ever again.

02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:49.440
Well, then maybe this isn't the promotion for you, perhaps.

02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:55.520
I'm living my hikikomori fantasy, yo. In fact, the interesting thing about it

02:07:56.240 --> 02:08:00.640
and the thing that I think they may have missed is that the last thing I want to do right now is

02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:06.640
a virtual hangout like that virtual hangouts. I've been doing that for 15 months. I don't

02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:13.920
want to do it anymore. So I think that may be where they made an error. But you know what?

02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:19.040
We need a brunch so that we can learn how to hang out with people.

02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:22.880
I've done brunch a couple times. And then there's food.

02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:25.360
Yes. I have not been to a brunch.

02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:27.840
What happened to miss? I don't want to see anybody.

02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:35.920
Well, that's different. I'm talking about like people, quote fingers, people.

02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:40.720
Oh, when you say you don't want to see people, but you do want to see a mimosa.

02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:45.840
I want to see a mimosa and I want to hang out with my friends.

02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:49.040
All right. My friends are better than people.

02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:55.840
Bobby in chat is saying bring O.L.R. back in person. Well, we'll see what happens.

02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:00.800
But I have a really good mic and you can wear my pajamas.

02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:06.240
You can bring the mic here. You can wear your pajamas here. But or we can come there.

02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:11.760
Oh, we could. But, you know, if I go out there, we could do sushi before the show.

02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:16.720
Yes. We haven't done sushi before the show in a hot minute.

02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:18.880
That is true. Now you're now you're starting to think of some of the pros.

02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:25.040
Yeah, but then that means I would have to like. Rush right home to.

02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:29.680
Yeah, well, just we'll talk about we'll talk about. All right. We'll figure it out.

02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:35.600
All right. Let's let's figure some things out with the live interactions that are via chat.

02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:39.440
If you have anything else you want to add there or you want to get to our mailbag,

02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:43.120
participate at Orange Laundry dot com is the place to send us emails.

02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:46.000
I'm also going to get to a few of the stories from discord.

02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:51.600
So let's get to the mailbag. Participate at Orange Laundry dot com. I think I saw a

02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:54.800
couple of emails tonight, right? Yeah, there's a few.

02:09:56.880 --> 02:10:03.280
So I'll go ahead and start with the earliest one. Hi, Rob. Enthusiastically rave wave at Rob

02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:11.040
regarding No Man's Sky. No Man's Sky is a game I bought at lunch and quickly became bored with.

02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:14.560
This isn't because I was dissatisfied with the trailers or the hype of the game,

02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:18.320
because I do not buy into the trailers or hype of anything.

02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:24.160
Like Flavor Flav said, don't believe the hype. Rather, I became bored with No Man's Sky because

02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:29.760
I didn't see the point. There wasn't a narrative to follow in the exploration game, nor was there

02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:34.960
an objective for me to follow that I really cared to follow. I just didn't see the point.

02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:38.640
So I stopped playing No Man's Sky because I didn't see the you said you didn't see the point.

02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:45.440
That's repetitive, dude. I'm reconsidering playing No Man's Sky because I still own it on PS4.

02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:49.600
So, Rob, as someone who has played No Man's Sky more than I have and clearly sees

02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:53.120
more of a value to the game than I had in my initial playthrough.

02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:57.920
Is there a point? Please be as open and broad as you wish. I'm open to being persuaded.

02:10:57.920 --> 02:11:02.000
Stay care of entertainment. Well, the number one thing I could

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:07.440
say is that you already bought the game. Why do I need to convince you?

02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:10.800
Like you're not going to be spending any money to get in there and play it again.

02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:14.880
So I think you already spent there. They already got your money. You might as well get your money's

02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:18.640
worth and go check out what they've changed. Like, you know, if this is a conversation on

02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:21.760
me trying to convince you to buy the game, then I guess that might be kind of a different thing.

02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:26.400
But if you already have it, like I think you're kind of just making up excuses not to play it,

02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:30.400
which is fine. I do that all the time. I'm not saying like, oh, how dare you? Please.

02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:34.400
I just talked about earlier in the show about, oh, I was playing this thing for like five minutes

02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:38.240
and then, oh, got distracted by some outer worlds. I was playing outer worlds for a little bit and

02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:42.160
then ended up flipping and going somewhere else. One of these days, I'll get back to outer worlds.

02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:48.080
One of these days. But, you know, is there? Yes, they added a better story from what was there in

02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:51.920
the beginning, but I'm not going to sit here and say, oh, it's got the depth of something like

02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:58.800
Mass Effect. No, but there it is a better tutorial. It is a better like quest that walk

02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:04.400
you piece by piece through the game that you don't feel like you're literally lost in space.

02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:13.360
Like there is a thread that will help you move things along and, excuse me, excuse me, cough,

02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:19.360
and will get you to a point where now you feel empowered enough to be able to explore on your

02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:22.800
own. And I think that might, and from what your email is saying, that sounds like it was the

02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:26.640
biggest piece that's missing for you is that the original version of No Man's Sky really didn't

02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:32.240
give you shit. And now, now it's got, you know, a full compendium built into the game and most

02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:36.880
importantly, quests that walk you through every piece of the way. You already own the game,

02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:41.120
my friend. Get your money out of it. Do the thing. Do the thing.

02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:51.600
All right, next up. What game genre name is most in need of an update or change? This comes from

02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:59.200
D. I don't think any of them do. They're all fairly accurate.

02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:08.480
No, I know. Walking sim. Walking sim needs to change. Because I think that term originally

02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:12.560
was used kind of like in a negative context, like, oh, all you do in these games is you go

02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:16.640
around and you walk, you know, when describing things like everybody's gone to the rapture,

02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:23.840
dear Esther, whatever, what remains of that's more of a community colloquialism. It's not an

02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:28.240
actual genre. Yeah, but I'm worried it's one of those things where it's like Xerox,

02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:32.960
you say it so much, it sticks. You know what I mean? Like, if that happens, it happens. It's

02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:41.440
just the nature of language. Yeah, I guess, I guess. But I mean, that's the one that comes

02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:47.680
to mind. I think the walking sim that I'm seeing kind of out there, I try to kind of,

02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:52.240
I love walking sim games, but I think it would be better if they were called something else. Like,

02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:58.240
I don't know if we talk like narrative heavy or... That's what they're called. Like, everyone's gone

02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:03.680
to the raptures, I think is what called just narrative game. Yeah, I think that's a better

02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:09.760
label for it. But that's what it's actually called. The walking sim is more a community

02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:16.560
colloquialism for it. All right. It's not actually the genre name. Loki? What about like,

02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:21.200
like Mr. Something like that? Because that almost reminds me of like a walking sim, I guess,

02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:28.480
unless there's not really puzzles to solve in say, you know, a quote unquote walking sim game.

02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:33.360
I don't know. Even something like Gone Home had puzzles in it. I mean, it was a little light.

02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:41.840
It was more like adventure puzzler. Yeah. You know, but or I like what Siata Berry says

02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:45.600
enhanced visual novel. I mean, that's what some of these are, but they're more considered. I think

02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:50.400
the genre is actually called like narrative adventure. Yeah, enhanced visual novel makes

02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:57.040
me think of something like Hot Devil Boyfriend or something like that. That's dating sim. Well,

02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:01.520
that's Yeah, like, like, that's kind of what I Yeah, so I like an actual visual novel

02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:08.480
would be something like, well, I mean, I had like a bunch of visual novel games like co new that

02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:13.680
were based off of anime like back in the day, where you just basically follow the story and

02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:21.680
little bits of it are animated. But, yeah. Anyway, I mean, that was that was the thing

02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:27.920
that popped in my head with the question. So because I mean, I adventure music game,

02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:34.480
retro fantasy, RPG, I don't have a problem with any of those. I kind of want to D, I want you to

02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:39.040
email us back. How would you answer this question? Because I'm kind of curious. I don't know. I'm

02:15:39.040 --> 02:15:43.680
just like, I'm kind of curious. Like, because sometimes I feel like maybe you got this question

02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:48.240
from something you want to see different. And so I'm like, curious what that is. So

02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:55.280
Oh, hell, Rob. Look at what just happened in chat. Oh, we just hit our point reward goal

02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:02.000
for Episode One of OLR with commentary. So we have to figure out a day that's gonna work for that.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:07.600
Yeah, we just raised 150,000 points. That's the most we've ever had for a reward. Yeah,

02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:12.480
Shane was the lucky one to cross the line there. Are you I don't know if you guys are you guys

02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:20.640
generally available on Wednesdays? I work until 830. Drat. What night? But

02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:27.360
I can make arrangements. Well, because I was going to say June 23rd, which is the actual

02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:30.400
birthday of the show, is a Wednesday this year. And I was thinking that would be a good day for

02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:35.920
it. But if you were to happen, you make it happen. I will talk offline. I don't don't hold this to

02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:40.480
that day yet. Chat, because clearly arrangements have to be made. But that is we're going to aim

02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:45.600
around that day if nothing else. Sound good. All right. But it may not be in person because

02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:49.680
I'd probably have to just get right off work and hop on. Oh, no, I don't think this has to

02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:55.440
be in person. I think we can do it over over Discord or whatever. Yeah. All right. Last email.

02:16:55.440 --> 02:17:01.760
Yes. Hello, LR. I was super excited when I heard about Tyto's upcoming mini arcade cabinet based

02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:07.680
on the full size egret 2 candy cap. I was also super excited to hear about it mentioned on OLR.

02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:12.560
But some of the amazing and coolest things about this mini were not mentioned. So I had no choice

02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:18.400
but to enlighten you all as to why this will be the best mini gaming thingy ever. Does it have a

02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:25.040
link cable? Why? Why are I'm going to finish reading? Thank you. Of course, we know that

02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:31.440
Tyto has a history of filled with amazing classic games, and we've been promised 40 of them in this

02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:35.840
thing. Most of the titles have yet to be announced, but already were given kicks, which

02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:42.160
I love. Bubble Bobble, Elevator Action, Rustan, and the iconic Space Invaders. Based on that,

02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:46.240
I feel like it's already safe to say this will have the best game selection of any mini cab to

02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:51.600
date. If you grabbed or simply paid attention to Sega's Astro City mini arcade late last year,

02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:56.240
or one of the biggest one of the biggest complaints about it was its widescreen monitor.

02:17:56.320 --> 02:18:02.320
None of the classic games use widescreen after all. The new Tyto cab will not cheap out in this

02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:08.880
regard. It's coming with an honest to goodness four to three monitor. But the coolest thing

02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:14.080
about the screen is that it rotates 90 degrees just like on the full size cabinet. This will

02:18:14.080 --> 02:18:19.680
allow you to play all of the included vertically oriented games the way they were meant to be

02:18:19.680 --> 02:18:24.720
played without scaling down the graphics to the size of postage stamp. Like the Astro City mini,

02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:31.360
Tyto's new cab will be released alongside a full sized arcade stick. The stick is meant to have

02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:39.040
to be an exact replica of the original Egret 2 candy cabs control panel. However, there's more.

02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:45.760
In addition to that arcade stick, Tyto is also releasing a full sized replica panel containing

02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:50.640
both a paddle controller and trackball. Not only does this mean we'll be getting some of Tyto's

02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:56.000
greatest games that uses control methods, but also standard USB plug will allow us to use it

02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:01.040
with emulators on PC as well. Paddle and trackball controllers are not readily available in plug and

02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:06.560
play solutions, so I'm super excited to get this. This is a long email. The paddle and trackball

02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:12.080
panel include an SD card with 10 additional games, bringing the total up to 50, including

02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:18.000
such classics as Arkanoid, Strike Bowling, and Camel Tree, which is one of my personal favorites.

02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:23.440
Strike, uh, sorry, and just in case you missed that, yes, you can add additional games with

02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:27.440
SD cards. None of the other mini cabs have this capability. Hopefully there will be

02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:32.880
many more card releases. You can switch the joystick between 8-way and 4-way operation.

02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:37.120
Instruction cards are included that sit right on top of the cab. Never mind the fact that Tyto

02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:42.240
games have some of the best soundtracks before video game soundtracks were even cool. There are

02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:47.440
a million reasons to get this. You should probably go to Amazon Japan and pre-order the Everything

02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:51.200
bundle right now that includes the mini cab, the paddle, the trackball controller with its bonus

02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:56.800
games, a full-size cab, uh, the paddle and trackball controller. Wait, I'm, I'm, I'm a

02:19:56.800 --> 02:20:01.200
line back. The full-size joystick, an additional controller, which is far more compact. The

02:20:01.200 --> 02:20:05.920
instruction cards, an art book, a collection of soundtrack CDs, and more for the low, low price

02:20:05.920 --> 02:20:11.680
of $410 US dollars for shipping. Do it, do it now. Of course, there are smaller packages available

02:20:11.680 --> 02:20:15.360
if you don't actually want all those things, but why wouldn't you want all of those things?

02:20:15.600 --> 02:20:20.480
Sorry, that was long, a little late for that, but I hope my excitement came across. I can't

02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:25.040
wait to play this thing. Yeah, Forza Horizon 5 looks pretty cool too. Have a great week.

02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:30.400
Already pre-ordered, Aaron Yyr. Hey, I appreciate the long email with all the details on that

02:20:30.400 --> 02:20:34.400
because, um, yeah, you know, I, I knew about like the screen rotating and things like that,

02:20:34.400 --> 02:20:39.200
but you know, you really went into some detail there on that. I, 400 might be a bit much,

02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:42.640
but then of course you're talking, of course I say that and then in the same breath as like,

02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:48.320
but I'll pay it for Tron. So clearly, clearly we all have our faves and we all have those

02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:52.800
weak spots and the things that God damn it moment with the wallet and all that stuff.

02:20:52.800 --> 02:20:58.000
So, um, this is one of yours and Tron is one of mine, but I think you make a good pitch for it.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:01.840
If I, if I had that type of extra money on the side, I'd love to pick one up, but I just,

02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:05.440
I don't in space, but I just don't see that happening right now, but maybe in the future,

02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:11.600
we'll see. All right. Was that it for emails? That was it. That was it for emails. Um, I was

02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:14.720
trying to scan. That was a lot of email to read though. It was a lot of emails tonight,

02:21:14.720 --> 02:21:20.160
but we hope you'll bring more participate at orange lounge, radio.com. Um, some things from

02:21:20.160 --> 02:21:25.600
the Twitter verse that, um, Simpsons arcade one-up was finally officially confirmed, uh,

02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:31.040
this week. And, uh, yes, that's happening, but no word on the Tron thing yet. Although I guess we

02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:34.400
imagine that will happen, uh, a really cool thing that was posted in our discord. Um,

02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:38.560
and if you haven't seen this YouTube, uh, definitely Google on YouTube or, you know,

02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:44.720
look it up this 40 new musicians. Welcome back soak into final fantasy 14 or Bobby posted the

02:21:44.720 --> 02:21:48.960
link in our discord. And I encourage you to join our discord vog network.com. That's VOG

02:21:48.960 --> 02:21:54.000
network.com slash discord. And you can help, uh, get stories to catch our attention throughout the

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:58.240
week and share cool little links like that. Obviously we had that, um, story a couple of

02:21:58.240 --> 02:22:03.280
weeks ago with, um, soak in revealing his battle with cancer, um, at the final fantasy 14 virtual

02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:09.120
fan fest this year. Um, so that whole, uh, the 40 musicians collaborating to kind of welcome him

02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:14.720
back and, and really kind of do a thank you. Um, I think it's really cool. I think this is really

02:22:14.720 --> 02:22:23.280
cool. SSJ 100, Matt shared, uh, a hidden 1984 level in Tetris effect. That is a throwback to

02:22:23.280 --> 02:22:28.400
the original computer terminal, the electronic a 60, and that's what the Tetris game was made

02:22:28.400 --> 02:22:33.680
for originally. And it's got a really cool look to it. Um, I know there's an old, like,

02:22:34.320 --> 02:22:38.560
maybe like 91 or something like that level in Tetris effect. That's really cool looking.

02:22:38.560 --> 02:22:42.560
This one looks cool too. Like it really looks like an old ass computer terminal,

02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:47.760
but Tetris effect in it. And I think that's just another reason to fire up an old game like that

02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:55.520
again. That's for sure. Um, and then one other story that I think is just, yeah, just barely

02:22:55.520 --> 02:23:02.240
from this week, um, Facebook gaming is trying to lure some folk. Tiger claw shared this one. Oh

02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:08.000
no, I shared this one, but what it was a discussion that tiger call, Oh, because tiger

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:13.440
claw had posted the thing about, uh, that you will no longer be able to use Facebook to log into

02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:18.320
Twitch. And that started a much longer conversation. And then I had found that story on Kotaku earlier

02:23:18.320 --> 02:23:22.560
this week about how, uh, Facebook gaming is apparently going to be giving a hundred percent

02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:28.720
of proceeds to their partners, uh, for a couple of years to try to make, uh, the Facebook gaming

02:23:28.720 --> 02:23:34.160
revenue share platform a little more, uh, lucrative. And, um, as much as I don't like

02:23:34.160 --> 02:23:38.960
Facebook and I, I, I will not go to Facebook gaming, uh, unless a lot changes. I mean,

02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:42.960
I guess I shouldn't ever permanently close the door or burn the bridge down completely,

02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:48.080
but a lot would have to change. I'm pretty happy here on Twitch, but I think it would be great if

02:23:48.080 --> 02:23:54.080
the competition and all that maybe did light a fire to Twitch to maybe increase the revenue

02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:58.000
sharing. We get a little bit here because right now it's 50 50. It would be nice if it was a

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:03.120
little bit higher, but I suppose, you know, Twitch as it is, uh, Amazon has questions about the

02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:09.760
profitability and all that stuff. So, um, maybe we got to be careful, but I, I dunno, I just feel

02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:15.520
like there's gotta be other way. Maybe if Twitch got into some of these things like, um, creating

02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:22.480
merchandise, like, you know, right now we use a stream lab store and other companies use other

02:24:22.480 --> 02:24:27.200
types of third-party stores to sell merchandise. And it seems a little silly when Twitch is backed

02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:32.080
by Amazon that they didn't get on the merch store thing first. I just think there's other ways and

02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:37.280
other ideas and things they could come up with, um, for revenue sharing that, um, then they could

02:24:37.280 --> 02:24:41.680
give more of a cut of bits and subs, but certainly that Facebook thing is going to give a little added

02:24:41.680 --> 02:24:46.720
pressure. Although it should, you know, if you really look at all the, if, then, buts, the

02:24:46.720 --> 02:24:51.600
footnotes and everything that really goes with that Facebook deal, it's not going to be like

02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:57.200
everybody. It's going to be some people to try to, you know, lure them from the Twitch and all that

02:24:57.200 --> 02:25:02.560
stuff. So, um, something to keep in mind, the headline was a little deceiving in that regard

02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:06.800
is it doesn't get into all the footnotes, but again, we all know headlines are set up to be

02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:14.400
clickbait on where? Facebook. So, all right. Anyway, that's, uh, it for the discord comments

02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:18.480
tonight. And so I think that is about going to wrap it up for our show tonight, unless

02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:22.320
let me check in with Loki and or Dark Sakura for any last minute stories.

02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:31.040
Um, I mean, one of the other announcements that they had, you know, Netflix wise, we, did we talk

02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:37.200
about Lance Reddick being, uh, a Wesker? No, we didn't, but, um, yes, that's a great thing to

02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:41.840
mention the whole, uh, Resident Evil cast being revealed. Yeah. So that's gonna be pretty awesome.

02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:48.720
Awesome. Um, Dark Tetsuya is bringing up, uh, from the arcade one upside of things,

02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:53.680
the class of 81 cabinet that was not leaked, but they announced that it's going to be like a Ms.

02:25:53.680 --> 02:25:59.040
Pac-Man, uh, and Galaga kind of combined thing. And that's got, but there's, there's much more

02:25:59.120 --> 02:26:04.720
to that as well. So it's pretty cool. Oh, thank you, Matt, for reminding me.

02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:11.040
Intellivision amico is having a press thing tomorrow, uh, 9 45 in the morning, our time

02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:16.560
Pacific, uh, 12 45 Eastern. So that could be interesting because they are launching this

02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:20.800
holiday. Um, so we'll get a little more, you know, they've been kind of putting out more and more

02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:25.440
details about the games, but I really think we're going to get a sense of what is, what is, what is

02:26:25.440 --> 02:26:29.920
this all going to look like this holiday? What are all the games and all that stuff? So, um, we

02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:35.280
know a lot, uh, and we know, I think all the free ones at this point, but, uh, we, we can't forget

02:26:35.280 --> 02:26:39.120
that Intellivision amico is a thing and that's happening this holiday. So they're going to have

02:26:39.120 --> 02:26:46.880
their press thing tomorrow. All right. Anything else? All right. I'm playing with the light on my

02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:52.560
mic on the camera. It's weird. Uh, I think we will wrap things up. Thank you guys so much for, uh,

02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:55.920
checking out our show tonight, downloading our show and checking out orange launch radio.

02:26:55.920 --> 02:27:00.640
Appreciate you guys. If would you, if, excuse me, if you like what you heard here at orange

02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:04.560
launch radio, tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word because we are the show

02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:09.120
where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here to put out on air, then what are we

02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:14.240
going to do? So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, uh, goes an awful long way as well.

02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:18.320
And we always appreciate that type of support. Um, thank you. Thank you so much. Uh, again,

02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:22.160
we had a hype train going on earlier tonight. I will acknowledge everybody after the credits here.

02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:25.520
Um, but I just want to say thank you. You guys don't have to do that, but you do.

02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:29.760
Um, and, and just thanks so much. Even if you're just listening to the show

02:27:29.760 --> 02:27:33.200
and you like never email us or tweet us or anything, you're a lurker,

02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:37.440
you know what? I appreciate that. You know what? I lurk in a lot of Twitch feeds, so

02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:43.360
it's fine. Um, I do too fairly regularly. Well, I lurk and then I see dark soccer

02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:48.880
chatting in the side. So I have to go, hi, BB, even though sometimes I feel that's

02:27:48.880 --> 02:27:52.000
disrespectful to the streamer. You know, I gotta be careful cause I need to say

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:57.760
hi to the streamer and then say hi to Jamie. You know what? I think that it just happens cause

02:27:57.760 --> 02:28:02.080
the community has gotten so close that everyone's going to say hi to everyone. So for sure. That's

02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:07.120
true. That's true. All right. Uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night

02:28:07.120 --> 02:28:12.560
and wrap it up. Um, Jamie, I will start with you. All right. Well maybe next week we'll find someone

02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:21.520
else to raid. Okay. Um, it seems to be a point of contention. Okay. Um, Loki, your final thought

02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:28.560
tonight? Uh, my final thought is I'm looking forward to taking a little bit of a break,

02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:36.080
at least no more two in the morning Minecrafts. Oh yeah. You, uh, I was like taking a break.

02:28:36.080 --> 02:28:40.880
Don't you have a lot of video to edit? No, no. Well, I still have a lot of video to

02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:46.720
shoot, so it's, it's not even edit, but it's, it's everything. Yeah. Um, and then my final

02:28:46.720 --> 02:28:51.920
thought tonight. Um, I don't know. Um, I, uh, thank you. Alan's in the kitchen, so I will

02:28:51.920 --> 02:28:56.000
dedicate my final thought to Alan. Even though he's listening to his, Oh, he gave me a thumbs

02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:02.720
up. Thank you for getting me the arcade cabinet and indulging in my stupid, um, addictions to,

02:29:02.720 --> 02:29:07.920
uh, these mini cabs and so forth and buy me snacky foods and soda and whatever else you

02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:13.520
got at target. So, all right. Excellent. Uh, that's it. A shout out to my husband at the

02:29:13.520 --> 02:29:17.840
end of the show. Oh, all right. That's it. We're going to roll credits. We will see you guys next

02:29:17.840 --> 02:29:25.520
week. Nintendo Tuesday in television Monday. I'm sure one of those we'll be talking about next

02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:29.600
week. No, we'll talk about both and other stuff. I'm sure that comes up throughout the week. It's

02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:33.120
still, it's going to be another big show next week. Stay tuned. We'll see you in seven days.

02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:38.480
