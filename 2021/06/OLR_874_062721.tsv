0	13720	Tonight, we're going to talk about classic games getting cartoons, two of them. We've
13720	17240	had video game universe TV shows, comics, movies, and more, but cartoons are having
17240	21160	something of a renaissance, something of a long overdue proliferation in this, the streaming
21160	24800	era, which is pretty on brand for gamers, now that I'm thinking about it. TV shows
24800	28200	from video games, video games related to TV shows, you got your chocolate and my peanut
28200	32280	butter, and so on. It's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to provide
32280	35640	actual detail about these two cartoons and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting
35640	37440	right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
37440	47400	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
47400	53960	where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live once again here
53960	61400	on June 27th, 2021 with episode number 874 of our show. My name is Rob Roberts and I
61400	67360	am joined this week as I usually am by first off the one and only Dark Soccer, Jamie Sommers.
67360	68960	I'm wearing merch.
68960	73140	You are? I just noticed that while we were sitting on the cat thing before we go live
73140	77840	here at Twitch, I was like, oh, she's got her new merch on. How do you like the shirt?
77840	81800	The tank top is very thin, but it's comfortable and pretty stretchy.
81800	82800	I was going to say.
82800	86440	Raise her back. You can see the shoulder action.
86440	90960	For these 100 degree days, it probably works out pretty well that it's kind of thin.
90960	97600	I don't know. We're kind of low. I've got buddies who were up there in the Northeast
97600	100720	who are like, it's way too hot to exist.
100720	105600	Yeah, it's way hot. Well, it's way, one, it is hotter in the Pacific Northwest this weekend,
105600	112480	but two, the architecture, the homes aren't all built for it. Here where we live and in
112480	117800	places like Phoenix where it's always hot, central air conditioning is standard. Absolutely.
117800	121560	You have to have it. But in places in the Pacific Northwest, they don't really see this
121560	126000	a lot. So it's not always standard. So it's a little scary. So hope everybody's doing
126000	133520	OK up there. They're feeling the heat a lot more than we are here in our area.
133520	138720	Also, I will thank Dark Soccer for the cheap plug for our shop, Vogue Network dot com slash
138720	142800	shop if you want to get a tank top to wear in the heat or otherwise.
142800	148640	I saw someone bought one of the album art prints. Yeah, we got a tweet showing off the
148640	153360	album art print and it looked really nice. Like, you know, I want one. Yeah. Now I kind
153360	156960	of want one, too. Like, I have to admit, I didn't really know what it would look like.
156960	160280	But now that, you know, I'm I'm glad a viewer took the risk and bought it and then tweeted
160280	163600	us a picture because I'm like, oh, that's a nice little keepsake. I want one of those
163600	168440	to hang in the studio, honestly. Maybe maybe I should put up a larger one. Maybe. Maybe.
168440	174440	Who knows? We'll see. All right. Anyway, I told Dan I wanted to get one. You should you
174440	181240	should buy all the things in our shop. What money? Good example. I don't know. The money.
181240	188080	I will. I will. When I get more than 12 streamers watching me at any given point in time, the
188080	194520	money spent on Dead by Daylight Cosmetics, which by which, by the way, I I finally finally
194520	199560	after all this time splurged on this week, I I had to have the Chris skin for Dead by
199560	204960	Daylight. Had to have it. I I bought the Chris and Claire. I bought all of the the Survivor
204960	209600	ones, even though I don't play Survivor. And I bought a Nia outfit today so I could try
209600	215040	to do the the outfit break. And I got it to work once, but I forgot to save the cosmetic
215040	221600	on Nia so I could keep Cheryl with black hair. And so that didn't work. So I have to try
221600	226700	it again. All right. Well, say hello as well. Playing a different game there in the background.
226700	232040	Say hello to Tech Master Loki. Hello. Hi. What is that that's playing behind you tonight?
232040	237320	I can't place that. Is that Rad Racer two? No. What is it? I can't place it again. It's
237320	241360	definitely a racing game of this side. Looks like an eight bit game. It's a racing game.
241640	246680	I can't tell if you're on a motor. Oh, you're on a motorcycle. Oh, it's the dang it. It's
246680	250920	the one where you smack people when you're on the motorcycle. No, it's not. That's not
250920	258160	Road Rash. He's playing a skateboarder. No, it's not skateboarder. What a rollerblader.
258160	267280	Yes. You know what game it is? I give up. It's Skitchen. Oh, I've never I don't think
267280	271120	I know that ever once played it. Yeah. Dark to see you got it in our chat, though, because
271120	274880	we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the
274880	278560	voice of Geeks Network, Twitch dot TV slash Vogue Network. And if you want to participate
278560	281960	along with our show, you can join us in our chat room just like dark to see you did and
281960	288080	shouted out the name of the game there. Speaking of things that happened at Twitch on Vogue
288080	295080	Network, we we've hit a milestone this week. Oh, our celebrating turning 19 years old this
295080	300240	week. So this is kind of our official celebration for that. But you guys know, as of several
300280	305720	years ago, we kind of we kind of put the confetti cannons away for every anniversary. It's like
305720	313200	birthdays after twenty one. Like, what's the point? Right. And so. So, yeah. But I mean,
313200	316240	obviously, this is a huge milestone and we did do something special for it. We did a
316240	320120	midweek broadcast and this was a lot of fun. So on Wednesday night, which was the actual
320120	324880	birthday of the show, because the first episode was June twenty third of 2002. So on June
324880	329360	twenty third this week, we actually got together and we listened to episode number one and
329400	333920	we were ready for all the cringe that came with listening to episode number one. But come
333920	339760	to find out, you know, and I hadn't listened to that show in a very long time and I don't
339760	346000	think I haven't listened to it since we did it. Exactly. So I got to say, it wasn't as bad
346000	349040	as I thought it was going to be. And I know that sounds really weird to say, especially
349040	352600	because, you know, we pour our heart and soul into this show and I'm very proud of it. But I
352600	357720	also recognize it's come a long way since the early days. And I was kind of surprised
357720	362880	episode number one was more polished than I expected it to be. Not to say it wasn't a
362880	367880	little bumpy, you know, but I was kind of walked away from that going, that wasn't that bad.
367880	372040	I kind of hyped that up to be a lot worse. And I felt like you guys kind of walked away with
372040	379840	similar opinions on that. So, yeah. Yeah. And I thought there was some very there was some
379840	386200	things in it that were very like, like how OLR still is today. Like the thing I well, there
386200	391160	were two things in it. Number one, and this shocked me. I didn't realize we had a webcam all
391160	397000	the way back on episode one. The one frame webcam. Yep. I knew the I think is even worse than that.
397000	403400	I think it was like one frame every three minutes. But I remember that we had a webcam in the early
403400	408920	days of OLR. I thought we didn't do it until we moved to that second studio that was the apartment
408920	412840	that Loki and I lived in. I didn't think we had a webcam in the first days of the show. So that was
412840	418360	a shock to find out that we've been doing video just about as long as we've been doing OLR
418920	423880	of some sort. I guess there were some gaps in that because we were doing slideshows. Exactly.
425080	430440	Exactly. But then the other thing I thought was very interesting about that whole thing was that
430440	435080	Loki, of course, we all knew Loki was at episode one, even though originally he wasn't there for
435080	439880	the discussion about we should do an Orange Lounge radio. But obviously, Loki put his heart and soul
439880	444920	into it as well from episode one so much that we kind of retconned him to a host from the beginning.
444920	449800	But if you listen to episode one where he wasn't technically a co-host yet, it's really funny
449800	454440	that he's bringing that same perspective of, oh, here's some news stories that we haven't
454440	459240	gotten to yet that we should kind of bring up. And he kind of was helping to throw out some topics
459240	463160	there towards the end of the show. And I'm the one sitting there going, well, maybe maybe the
463160	467080	critics were right. We can't fill two hours talking about Bomani. And Loki was like, well,
467080	471640	what about this? What about this? So I thought that was really surprising, like in a pleasantly
471640	476600	fun kind of way. So, yeah, that was I remember doing that. Yeah, I didn't remember that either.
476600	482520	But it's it's at the same time, I'm not surprised. It's why you're still here. Right. So it's great.
482520	489160	Yeah. Anyhow, TigerClaw in chat says, do you remember how fast your Internet was back in
489160	496440	the days? Was it on dial up? The early O.L.R. was on a DSL connection. So that was blazing fast at
496440	502600	the time. But O.L.R. was also dial up friendly radio when it started on live through 65. So
502600	507640	that's why the recording is not the greatest quality, because it was like it's like something
507640	512840	like 24 Kbps or whatever was dial up friendly at the time. So it's you know, it's it's a pretty
512840	517400	poor quality. But there were a lot of people, especially in remote parts of the country,
517400	522520	that were still on dial up at the time. So it kind of worked out for them. And then some kind
522520	527240	words from the chat. Bobby Black Wolf in chat says it shows how much O.L.R. has changed,
527240	533320	but also how much O.L.R. has stayed the same. Yep. Mr. Rhizos in chat says happy 19th anniversary
533320	537560	O.L.R. Thank you very much. And just a big, you know, thank you again. I know I say this a lot,
537560	543000	but it's because I mean it. Thank you to all of you out there who support the show, who listen,
543000	548280	who say nice things like that. I got some really touching tweets throughout the week this week in
548280	553800	response to O.L.R. turning 19 and such. And I just yeah, I mean, it's it's really the motivation
553800	559080	that keeps things going. So I just I want to give a big thank you to everyone out there that
559080	564840	continues to listen to this. I thought it was hilarious that there were more people
565960	569880	watching that broadcast on Wednesday of us listening to episode one. There were more people
569880	574200	watching that than were actually listening to episode one back in the day. But I'll tell you
574200	579880	what, Dark Tetsuya gets a gold star because he was there for both. He was there for episode and
579880	584120	his name is in episode one because we shouted him out in the chat room, which apparently we had an
584120	589000	IRC chat room in the early show that I read, I think three times throughout the whole show. So
589000	594760	I've gotten better at that. That's for sure. But anyway, I remember you saying that it didn't sound
594760	599560	like we got any at first, but yeah, they came in. That might have been it, too. I feel like the chat
599560	605160	was probably really slow in those early episodes. But Joe Mama was there. Joe Mama was the first
605160	610120	chat comment ever read. So there was that. So it's just kind of funny. Dark Sakura,
610120	614200	Loki, anything you guys want to say about the 19th birthday and all these candles on the cake?
616920	622440	It wasn't that bad. I sounded really sinacy, but I think I always sound really sinacy.
622440	627480	Well, and the poor quality of the recording and the poor microphones, I think kind of-
627480	629000	I don't think that can mimic sinus.
630120	632920	You'd be surprised how horrible it can make your voice sound, but yeah.
635320	640920	But anything on turning 19 years old, not so much episode one, but just this milestone of 19 years,
640920	646680	which we still believe makes us the longest running internet show slash podcast about games
646680	652680	out there, period. Any- I'm officially looking into the Guinness thing.
652680	655400	Yeah, that would be a very nice thing. You have to pay for it.
655400	657400	Yeah, but how much is it? I think it's worth it.
657400	659480	Yeah, we might be able to- if it's only a couple of hundred dollars,
659480	662440	I bet we could just pool it together. I think it's a couple of thousand dollars.
662440	666760	Well, maybe we'll have to just- Maybe we'll take a Kickstarter.
666760	670520	Maybe, maybe. I don't know. Loki, any thoughts on turning 19?
671240	678760	No, it's just another episode. 20 will be really cool. I mean, that'll be really significant.
678760	683080	And no one will realize- no one will know.
683080	685880	Yeah, but I gave up on that at the five-year mark.
688200	688840	Yeah, we'll see.
689880	696040	Phoenix7726 says, will y'all be putting episode one up on the RSS feed again? That's a no.
696840	701800	And the reason why, A, there's copyright music all over it because we used to take music breaks.
701800	705720	Actually, as a quick aside, and Dark Tetsuya, if you're listening, please post that link in
705720	711720	chat that you had in the private thread that only the host can see with the stories every week.
711720	716040	But you put together a YouTube playlist of all the songs from episode one,
716040	719720	and people were asking about that. So Dark Tetsuya, please share that link in chat
720680	726040	because I'd love for the folks that were asking, what were those songs that you were skipping over?
726040	728760	I'd like you guys to have a copy of that. So check that out.
728840	739800	And also just because even though I was pleasantly surprised that nothing was said was as terrible
739800	744520	as I thought it was going to be for the age of the show, there were still a couple things where
744520	754600	I'm like, people looking at that in a 2021 lens without the right frame of mind may not appreciate
754600	761240	it. So I think it's best that it just be kept in the vault. It's not hard to find. I'll tell you
761240	766520	that episode one of OLR is not hard to find, especially if you kind of poke around the old
766520	771720	forums at VOG Network, which they're no longer active or usable, but you can still look at old
771720	777400	posts. You can probably find episode one pretty easy, but I'm just going to stress this. I always
777400	783000	do. Those shows are nearly 20 years old at this point. So just keep that in mind.
783880	785800	So I found the answer.
786600	788440	For which... Oh, the Guinness thing.
788440	789160	For Guinness.
789160	790040	Yes. What is that?
790040	797480	So for a new record, it's $1,000 for a priority application where they process it in five days.
797480	802520	For a standard application, there's no cost and takes up to 12 weeks for it to be reviewed.
803080	804680	And then send us the guidelines.
804680	809400	All right. Well, Dark Soccer, you're in charge of that project. Let's make it happen. I'd love that.
809400	811080	Do we want this to happen, chat?
811080	811720	I think so.
814200	818840	Well, I'll wait to see what chat says. I'm going to do it anyway, but I want to see what they say.
818840	825640	Phoenix7726 says, was there some casual ableism or something? There was an instance of a word
825640	829240	that was used far more often 20 years ago that wasn't...
829240	829960	That wasn't me.
829960	835080	It wasn't... Well, it wasn't any of us. It was actually a guest, but I don't want to deflect on
835080	840200	the guest either because I'm sure in subsequent episodes, it fell out of our mouths too at some
840200	846360	point. But I just want to clearly say it certainly wasn't appropriate then and isn't appropriate now,
846360	851640	but society's rules were a little different. And unfortunately, we have a tendency to parrot things
851640	856920	that we hear on TV and around us and stuff. But I think it was interesting because Dark Soccer,
856920	861160	after we did that, we rated another Twitch streamer. We rated Losing Color, and we were
861160	867160	talking about it in their chat. And I thought there was some very nice chat in there about,
867160	871800	well, if you can look back on that and at least say, wow, that was cringe and I wouldn't do that
871800	875800	again, then it does show growth and that you've learned from it. And I think that's something
875800	879000	to celebrate. And that's really what it was all about, honestly. So...
879000	886920	Yeah. And I mean, in my early days of going into Elsie's channel, by the way, they were like,
886920	891880	oh, tell me all about it and let me go off at length. And then they followed us.
891880	896440	That's great. That's very nice. All right. I think you're seeing some folks in chat that
896440	901160	want to see C.O.L.R. in the Guinness Book of World Records. So we got to make that happen.
901160	902440	I'm creating my account right now.
902440	908600	All right. Okay. Anyhow, let's get into some other gaming topics here. So again,
908600	913080	one more thank you for helping us get to 19 years. Let's push through one more year. Let's
913080	919480	see if we can get to 20. All right. Let's go ahead and get into our top story tonight,
919480	926120	which has to do with Windows 11. Windows 11 was announced this week. Microsoft did a big
926200	930680	to do about that. And you might be wondering, well, what's Windows 11 have to do with gaming?
930680	934120	And I would say, really? You're going to ask that? Because there's a lot of people
934120	938760	that are playing on PC, Windows types of environments. And so, of course,
938760	943000	it's absolutely important what Windows 11 is going to be doing, especially when it comes to
943000	948600	gaming. And I think a lot of people have peered in the crystal ball and kind of thought, hmm,
948600	956840	Microsoft does Windows. Microsoft does Xbox. What is Windows 11 going to do to Xbox?
956840	960520	And sure enough, as part of the Windows 11 announcements earlier this week,
961320	966920	they have announced that Xbox Game Pass will be built into Windows 11. So if you're already subbed,
966920	970120	you can get right in there and play your games in Windows 11. I have to be honest,
970840	974360	isn't it kind of that way with Windows 10? I mean, I understand it is. Yeah,
974360	978840	I understand they're going to make it like it's maybe in Windows 10. It's kind of like a
978840	983880	separate app. It's a separate standalone thing that like like the Steam store or something that
983880	988920	you run. And so I can see that maybe like in Windows 11, it's going to be more integrated.
988920	994200	But I also kind of think this headline is a little bit like, is it going to be that different? I
994200	1000760	actually don't. Yeah. That sounds it's more click baity. Maybe a little bit. But I get the point.
1000760	1006360	I get why it's newsworthy. Integrated verse into the application versus a standalone app
1006360	1010600	is a difference. It is a different, you know, way to present. But I think for most people,
1010600	1017480	it's going to feel very similar. But we're not really surprised to see that. But Microsoft kind
1017480	1024200	of also going out of their way to invite other people into Windows 11 store, probably because
1024200	1028520	they don't want to be seen as monopolizing the market because, you know, I think Microsoft's
1028520	1032920	gotten slaps on the wrist before for things like antitrust and things like that. So even though
1032920	1036920	they're going to be building Game Pass into it, they're kind of going out of their way to say,
1036920	1043160	we want Steam. We want Epic Game Store. We want other. I think. I think they had even said we
1043160	1047000	want iMessage. I know that's not about gaming, but they have said these other things. They want
1047000	1054120	to get these other things integrated into Windows. So in a comment, I was trying to find the keyword
1054120	1062680	here. Is that who said this? The OS chief Panos Panay mentioned to The Verge in an interview
1062680	1067240	that Microsoft would like to add these third-party stores, specifically calling out Steam and Epic
1067240	1072920	Game Stores. And Panay in the interview said these stores would be very welcome.
1074040	1079640	They want to make Windows 11 a go-to source for app, saying, quote, you type the app in and you
1079640	1086200	get the app you want. So interesting. It should also be said, though, that Windows 11 does not
1086200	1092920	plan to charge a fee to have apps listed. However, that doesn't apply to games. There's been a very
1092920	1099800	interesting, clear distinction between apps are free, games are not. So I don't know how that's
1099800	1104760	going to work. If they were to try to put Steam in there, then does that mean that Microsoft would
1104760	1109000	take a cut because it's games? I don't know. I guess they would have some things to work out
1109000	1116360	there. But considering Steam exists on Windows 10 today and doesn't get a cut, I don't see why,
1117240	1121560	again, I think it's a question about is it integrated into the system and something you
1121560	1126360	get right there like on, you know, or is it, you know, a separate app that you launch? And I feel
1126360	1131160	like things like Steam, Epic Game Store and so forth will just be separate apps that you launch.
1131160	1139080	So going to comment and chat, TigerCon Chat says, I advise against upgrading to Windows 11.
1139080	1143560	You may have some hardware that you normally use that probably won't have any Windows 11 drivers
1143560	1147320	on launch. If there's a piece of hardware you've been using for the last couple years,
1147320	1151160	you have to check if the manufacturer is still supporting it with Windows 11 drivers.
1151960	1157480	And Mr. Izos in Chat says, as with new consoles, it's always worth to wait a bit to see how the
1157480	1162680	existing hardware catches up with Windows to upgrade. Never be on that first all buggy batch.
1163960	1170680	I probably will not upgrade to Windows 11 on day one, but I hope to be an early-ish adopter.
1170680	1175320	That is assuming that they don't force it on you. Like, I don't know if this is going to be
1176040	1179960	because they were talking about Windows 10 being like kind of the last update of Windows that
1179960	1183960	there's going to be unless they're going to kind of start treating us like, you know,
1183960	1187800	Mac OS or something like that, where it's just the version numbers are going to keep
1187800	1192920	going up as it updates. I don't know if they're going to make you name the new ones, Monterey.
1192920	1198680	Yeah, I understand that. But that's just kind of. I don't know, a formality. I mean,
1198680	1202360	what I'm saying is, you know, well done branding, it's well done branding. You don't have to
1202360	1209240	purchase like a brand new install of an OS. It just updates and, you know, whatever you call it,
1209240	1213080	a different name. Right. But like, I don't know if they're playing on doing that with Windows 11.
1213080	1218520	If that's the case, if they are, then they're going to shove it right into your face.
1218520	1223560	They did confirm it's free. So it's it's not and they're going to shove it right into your face.
1223560	1227560	They'll absolutely shove it in your face. But they did that with Windows 10. It's very easy
1227560	1234760	to click. Not today, you know, and I want to say with Windows, not not today, Microsoft.
1235480	1242600	I want to say when they did Windows 10, you could also make a backup of your old OS for like 30
1242680	1248200	days and revert back at any time, because I think they kind of read the tea leaves on why people
1248200	1252440	were hesitant to do the upgrade. I think that was a smart thing to do. That was the thing that
1252440	1257160	finally got me to push the button was when it was like, OK, you can revert back in 30 days if you
1257160	1262200	don't like it. So they would be very smart to do something like that with Windows 11. And I think
1262200	1269320	that'll encourage more people to adopt it. So we'll see. Let's see, other comments in chat.
1269960	1276920	Did you do pod culture and chat says I'm running 11 without issues. Just had to enable TPM in my
1276920	1281320	BIOS. Thank you. Thank you for being one of the people willing to put up with a buggy piece of
1281320	1285800	software so that when it comes out for the rest of us, those will all be ironed out. But I'm glad
1285800	1292120	it's running without issues for you so far. That's great. E3VL in chat says, didn't they force 8 to
1292120	1297000	10 when it launched? Maybe my memory was fuzzy. I didn't go from 8 to 10. I went from 7 to 10.
1297000	1303240	But I remember it wasn't forced. So there was that. Yeah, I went from 8 to 10. It wasn't forced,
1303240	1308120	but like they were kind of basically it was, you know, I hate Windows 8 so much.
1309960	1314840	Going from 7 to 8 was like kind of a downgrade almost. Yeah. Because that was when they're like,
1314840	1321960	oh, well, tablets are the future. Everything must be tablet like. So it was a warm welcome to have
1321960	1326600	another OS to go to aside from 8. So I think that's why a lot of people kind of jump ship
1326600	1332120	really fast on that. I think so. So to tie it kind of like back to gaming and all that,
1332120	1336360	I think it's going to be interesting that we have the new OS. And it does feel like it's probably
1336360	1341720	about time, like it's been a few years. It probably feels like it's about time for a new OS.
1341720	1345800	But I'm not sure if at the end of the day, our gaming experiences are going to change
1345800	1349880	that significantly. I mean, yes, they're talking about the Game Pass integration, but or the Game
1349880	1354120	Pass stuff. I just don't think it's going to play out that differently than what we see in Windows
1354120	1358440	10 today. It's not like it's going to pre install games or anything like that. At least I hope to
1358440	1362520	hell it doesn't. I don't think it will, because that would be so rude to your bandwidth. They
1363800	1370040	did that with the included games with the install before, I think. I can't remember because I
1370040	1373560	remember like Candy Crush is in there. So that was like an immediate install. But
1375320	1380600	yeah, hopefully there's not kind of bloatware in there. Obi-Wan Jabroni in chat says, I'm a Mac
1380600	1384440	user. You're speaking a foreign language. I understand, of course. And I know Dark
1384440	1388440	Soccer is a big fan of her Mac. And there's certainly nothing wrong with that. But I know
1388440	1393480	even with Mac, sometimes what goes on with Windows can still kind of affect things in case they get
1393480	1398280	like this thing you're kind of talking about with the Mass Effect trilogy and the difficulties
1398280	1404360	it's kind of been up and running getting that. But I would wonder, I think this would be an
1404360	1411400	extremely smart thing for Microsoft to do is to leverage some of that xCloud stuff like they best
1411400	1417640	have an xCloud player for the Mac. But I guess that's on Microsoft to figure that out and maybe
1417640	1425080	perhaps some things on Apple as well. Anyhow, let's go ahead and move on. Can you get Edge on
1425080	1433960	a Mac? Technically, yes. Yeah. So technically, I think it does run through Edge.
1435000	1440840	Well, xCloud's on a website, too, right? And I know Chrome's on. I'm running Chrome on this
1440840	1444280	very Mac that's powering our show. I have to use Chrome to play Stadia.
1444280	1449240	Yeah. So I was going to say, I'm pretty sure Chrome will do xCloud, too. So that's a very
1449240	1453640	good point. You're right. They don't even need a native app. It's all going to run through the web,
1453640	1458920	which is probably what the future is anyway. Oh, and Obi-Wan Jabroni says it works on Safari. Well,
1458920	1465320	there you go. That's the go-to Mac browser. So it makes sense. Anyhow.
1465320	1469080	Good. Anything you have to do to prevent no one wants to install Edge.
1470920	1476760	I don't think Edge is as bad as the last one. But anyway, all right. Let's get into other stuff.
1476760	1481560	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and what we've been playing on PC, console, or otherwise. And
1481560	1484440	we'll start off with Dark Sakura with the question, how was your gaming week?
1485320	1490120	Um, I did not again play Animal Crossing. I have played a lot of Dead by Daylight. I basically,
1490760	1496120	in just a couple hours a night for about four nights, I got Hag to 40.
1497400	1505160	Um, I'm now a Hag main. It's amazing. Uh, I actually like Larry's with Hag.
1506120	1509800	I hate Haddonfield still. It's still garbage. And the corn is still garbage.
1510680	1517160	But I actually don't mind Larry's or Hawkins. I've tried Hag. I can't do it. She's too slow for me.
1517960	1522840	And the trap thing is like, for whatever reason, the trap thing for me is so delayed.
1522840	1528120	Like when I try to trigger the trap, I can't get a hit in. So it's just Hag's run for me.
1528120	1535960	When I get an explosion alert, I've just got my pinky on my control key the whole time.
1535960	1541400	Hmm. So, or sorry, my command key. I mean, I'm playing on a Mac, but for you, it would be
1541960	1549240	what, what button is that? Alt. But anyway, um, and I'm still having some fun with doctor
1549240	1553400	and I'm still playing piggy sometimes, but I've pretty much been nothing but Hag this last week.
1553400	1561800	It's been great. Um, so I'm team Hagatha. Um, I also finally, they have updated a windows
1561800	1568760	arm sufficiently that I can get mass effect to load, but it does not load all the way.
1568760	1575960	It does not play well. It's still in the very infancy of that, uh, 64 bit emulation
1577000	1585560	or whatever emulation it wants to use. Um, so I'm still waiting, but it was exciting getting,
1585560	1593080	getting it to work. I'm actually running the, the, uh, early beta builds for windows arm
1593720	1600680	and I've been fairly pleased, fairly pleased. Nice. And of course word escapes because I'm
1600680	1609400	addicted to letters. All right. Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week? It's all Minecraft still. So,
1610200	1617000	this week's been interesting. I've was trying to set up some content to record for another episode,
1617000	1622280	had a plan and everything, but then, uh, we decided to update the server to one 17.
1622280	1628520	So that added a lot of things and totally derailed everything I wanted to do and also broke my
1628520	1634680	shaders, which I was sad about it at first, but actually I'm kind of getting used to the way it
1634680	1641000	looks before shaders. Um, and also the frame rates a little bit much better, like 10 times
1641000	1648520	better. Um, so I've been just messing around with the one 17 stuff, um, new shop designs and stuff.
1648520	1655560	So I'm going to film that content. And then I think actually that the Optifine has re-enabled
1655560	1660440	shaders. So probably I need that pretty soon. Sorry, awkward, but I need to do a quick AFK.
1661000	1664120	Smoosh is wailing. So I need to make sure he's okay. I'll be right back.
1666600	1671080	He shouldn't be wailing because that's illegal and frowned upon.
1671080	1673560	What if he's wailing on a guitar doing some sick riffs?
1674920	1682200	Maybe. I don't know. Um, so yeah, it's been a lot of that. I've been designing an axolotl shop,
1682200	1686280	so we're going to be selling axolotls in the shopping district now. And it's awesome. You
1686280	1691960	got to, can't wait to show you the design. It'll be in the new, the new episode. I have a farm now
1691960	1700440	to get those as well. So I have, I probably have at least 50 to 60 axolotls at the moment. So it's
1700440	1708520	pretty crazy. Um, but yeah, uh, one, one 17 is pretty awesome. The caves are a lot more
1708520	1713400	interesting now. Not as interesting as they're going to be in one 18 when that comes out, but
1713400	1719240	it has been, um, definitely worth getting used to the only downside though so far. And I think it's
1719240	1725080	a server issue is my entire gold farm that was in there is completely broken, which is unfortunate
1725080	1730520	because I need that gold farm to run my shop on the server. And that fact that it doesn't work
1730520	1737160	anymore is a problem. Although no, nothing in the update should have broken that it's, I think it's
1737160	1742840	more of just something because our server runs paper MC, which is kind of a modded client or
1742840	1748360	modded server. And there's additional tweaks and stuff that they do in there. The fixed stuff that
1748360	1753320	you know, maybe broken in vanilla. I think something with that is affecting what's going on.
1753320	1758120	So I'm trying to get the admins to look into that. But in the meantime, I'm also setting up a cash
1758120	1762680	for gold shop instead, you know, like those old commercials we used to see all the time.
1763560	1765880	I'm back smooshes. Okay. Thank you. Okay.
1766600	1771880	Glad he's not wailing. So yeah, it's been just lots of Minecraft stuff. So I'm hopefully going
1771880	1779240	to be working on stuff for another episode soon. I'm trying to get it down to one episode a week.
1779240	1783160	I mean, listening to the folks come behind the scenes on like the hermitcraft stuff,
1783160	1788680	they said that it takes about eight hours to film, edit and publish an episode for them.
1788680	1792840	And it's taken me way longer to do that. Like I'm having way more footage like there's
1792840	1795640	when they were talking about like, Oh, yeah, I have to go through an hour and a half worth
1795640	1803160	of footage. And that's a lot. Like, I'm going through a good 10 times the amount of footage
1803160	1808360	than they are. So I'm doing something wrong. So I need to kind of refine that process. But
1809480	1813160	hopefully we'll have a new episode soon. I don't want it to be two weeks, but maybe in the middle
1813160	1817080	of the week. Well, that's part of the learning process, though. And another quick plug for
1817080	1821640	because I don't think you put that if I, you know, what is time anymore? But I seem to remember
1821640	1825880	that your big collaboration video went up on Monday, so the day after our last show. So a big
1825880	1829240	shout out to go follow your YouTube channel to check out your latest video.
1830040	1834200	Yeah, it's up there. I think it was last Sunday or something like that. But yeah, there's a there's
1834200	1839320	a lot. My last video with Tango Tech from hermitcraft. They're in the middle of season
1839320	1843880	eight right now. So it's pretty awesome. But I got to collaborate with him a little bit and
1843880	1849720	just kind of talk about his process and stuff. And we started working on just something. I mean,
1849720	1853400	off the cuff, it's kind of hard to build, especially with it, you know, I was super
1853400	1857880	nervous. So it's hard to kind of come up with something offline, though, I've been able to
1857880	1861480	come up with something much grander, which will be in probably a future episode, but
1861480	1865720	it'll be inspired by what we kind of started there. It was still a fun experience. So I would
1865720	1871400	I totally recommend you watch it and give me a like and subscribe and all that fun stuff.
1871400	1877960	All right, we will. Let's see my gaming week. I honestly didn't play a lot of new stuff still
1877960	1883560	going on the day of the daylight. I had to play the Debbie Delight. The Debbie Delight. I played
1883560	1892520	some Nemesis. Hey, Nemesis. Yeah. Did you whip it out? I did. I wish the whip length was a
1892520	1899800	little bit longer. I wish it was a little bit faster. Yeah. And that's so that's taken some
1899800	1903640	getting taken some getting used to. But I was finally able to get that daily done where it's
1903640	1908040	like you have to max out. You have to play four times to get it done because it's max out your
1908040	1913560	meter like four times. So I did that. You can just do it by hitting zombies. I. Yeah, but it's so
1913560	1917560	much slower that way. Like it's better to just do a survivor and get them in a chase, but you have
1917560	1921800	to get so close and then do it because you can try to risk it from a little further back, but you
1921800	1927720	might not hit them. But my other big day by daylight accomplishment is I got Jill to 40.
1927720	1932200	So I got my blast mine teachable finally. So I'm probably going to move on to another character.
1932200	1936600	I'll probably do Jake next because I really want Iron Will. So, yeah, I've been working on those.
1936600	1940600	I should probably do a stream of that at some point because I talk about all the time. But
1940600	1945880	whenever I stream, it's usually playing Final Fantasy 14, which, by the way, just as an aside,
1945880	1949400	because I just realized it's not in tonight's show role and maybe it should have been.
1949400	1953960	They're doing a very interesting promotion with Final Fantasy 14 right now where you can get a
1953960	1960520	special black chocobo. It's specifically the fat chocobo. You can get a flying mount black fat
1960520	1971960	chocobo if you have to watch certain Final Fantasy 14 streamers and give four subs. And if you donate
1971960	1977960	four subs while watching particular Final Fantasy 14 streamers, then you get the black fat chocobo.
1978600	1982840	And this is causing a little bit of controversy in the community because the list of who they
1982840	1987880	curated. Again, I don't want to talk negative about any of those people, but it could have
1987880	1994200	probably shown a little more diversity. And quite frankly, in my opinion, I don't understand why
1994200	1999880	it's limited to begin with. And I'm not trying to be salty or whatever. How dare I wasn't included?
1999880	2003800	No, I mean, I stream the game once every two weeks. Of course, I'm not going to be included
2003800	2009400	in something like that, but I don't understand why they don't just open it up to anyone streaming
2009400	2015800	the game. Usually when you're talking about No Man's Sky giveaways in that game, it was anybody
2015800	2020280	who's broadcasting it. When it was things like World of Warcraft and Overwatch, it was anybody
2020280	2026120	who's broadcasting it. So I'm not sure what the thought process there was to limiting it to
2026120	2031000	certain streamers. And again, I promise you, I'm not trying to talk negative about any streamers.
2031000	2036120	I'm sure those streamers work very hard, but the problem is not who they included. The problem is
2036120	2043960	who they left out. And there's some big problems with who they left out. And so that's an issue.
2043960	2046760	But anyway, I needed to bring that up at some point because I just realized it's not on the
2046760	2051160	show role because I don't know if any big sites actually reported on that. I think it was more
2051160	2056120	of a Twitter thing. So there's that. But I have been playing Final Fantasy XIV and I did hit a
2056120	2063560	big milestone in that game. I have gotten my warrior class past level 50, which means every
2063560	2070760	job I have past level 50, which was the realm reborn cap. So I have my crown because that was
2070760	2075880	an achievement in a realm reborn was if you got everything to max level, which was 50 at the time,
2075880	2083800	your character got a red crown. So I can get that now for glamour and walk everywhere with a crown.
2083800	2091160	So I can't wait to get them all to 60. I have three jobs left that aren't 80. Warrior,
2091240	2097720	Monk, and Black Mage. Black Mage is 73. That's real close. The other two are lagging behind in
2097720	2102520	the 50s. So I'm really going to work this week and the upcoming weeks and have everything 80
2102520	2108120	well in advance of the new expansion. I'm going back to what I was talking about with XIV. Bobby
2108120	2113000	Blackwolf says, one of the streamers is part of GDQ and said that he was only told to expect just
2113000	2118360	a few subs. And he basically went on for hours and made lots of money. The subs were rolling in
2118360	2121960	and he was already a partner. Well, yeah, they don't want to, they don't want to set expectations
2121960	2127960	inappropriately, but of course these folks are going to get a ton of subs. People want shit in
2127960	2133320	Final Fantasy XIV. It's the biggest MMO right now. You know, of course people want to have that. If
2133320	2139080	Blizzard did this for wow, the exact same thing would happen. It's just weird that they didn't
2139080	2144280	foresee that. I don't know, whatever. Anyway, Misha Kha earlier was talking about playing
2144280	2151320	Palace of the Dead, which is a very good way to level up DPS alts. I might actually do some of
2151320	2155640	that with my monk. Warrior, you can kind of queue for dungeons over and over because you're not
2155640	2160600	waiting long as a tank. But yeah, Palace of the Dead is a really good way to grind experience
2161960	2167640	in the lower levels, especially. So, all right. I think that's really about it for my gameplay.
2167640	2171240	Honestly, Dead by Daylight, Final Fantasy XIV, maybe a little bit of stuff on console,
2171240	2177400	but nothing more than like an hour. So, all right. I was gone all weekend anyway. So, all right.
2178120	2180120	By the way, it's submitted.
2181400	2182200	That was fast.
2183400	2185160	Yeah, I work quick, quickly.
2185160	2189400	I'm surprised we didn't have to like, did you have to provide any documentation or anything else?
2189400	2190280	Do they just follow up?
2190920	2194840	They just follow up. Although I don't know why this is saying I'm in Uganda. Let me fix that.
2195480	2197960	Okay. Yeah. I've never been there.
2197960	2203240	That would be unfortunate if we get in the book and then oops, we were credited to the
2203240	2209560	wrong country. That would be unfortunate. Anyway. All right. Let's move on and get into some other
2209560	2213640	gaming news and we'll start with Loki with what's going on in the gaming world this week.
2214360	2220680	Yeah. So, apparently, Final Fantasy is getting an animated series. So,
2220680	2224840	Final Fantasy IX to be exact because there's been lots of different Final Fantasy animated series.
2225640	2231480	But yeah, this is pretty interesting. Kind of weird though that they picked Final Fantasy IX
2231480	2239000	being it's been so long since it's come out to actually do a series for it. But I don't know.
2239000	2245240	I guess they're doing it. So, apparently, this is going to be done by Cyber Group Studios.
2245960	2249960	They're also going to be doing different merchandising and licensing to go along with it
2249960	2256840	as well. I'm not sure where this is going to be featured yet. I'm wondering if that's going to be
2256840	2263880	on a streaming service at some point. But it'd be cool to check it out whenever it actually makes
2263880	2269560	it out. Yeah. I was kind of surprised to hear Final Fantasy IX. Well, I mean, I am and I'm not
2269560	2277000	because Final Fantasy IX's world and characters kind of lend itself well to that sort of thing.
2277000	2281800	So, I mean, it's not like they can't do one for Final Fantasy X, but I get it with IX.
2281800	2288520	But you're right. It is interesting why that one, especially when Seven's got the remake and all
2288520	2292840	this other stuff. And surely, they're going to want to push Final Fantasy XVI eventually.
2293560	2297880	But maybe for whatever reason, they just decided this is the one that has the best story to tell.
2299400	2306040	Yeah. I mean, I guess. I mean, they're targeting this right now. It's supposed to be adapted for
2306040	2314120	a target audience of eight to 13 year olds. So that'll be interesting. A whole new audience
2314120	2319560	for Final Fantasy IX. Some comments in chat. DJ Rama S says, as long as it's not Final Fantasy VIII,
2319560	2328840	that's the worst Final Fantasy. While your shade is on point with me, here's the thing. I do think
2328840	2332760	VIII had a good story, though. It's just I didn't care for the game in VIII. So if they wanted to
2332760	2337000	animate VIII, then cool, because I wouldn't have to play it. And the cutscenes are amazing in VIII,
2337000	2342040	so I'm good with that being animated. That's where I'm at, but I appreciated the shade.
2342760	2347400	Let's see. Zen Monkey says it's probably because it's the easiest to animate because they're so
2347400	2355560	small. That makes sense. Quest Buster says Final Fantasy IX is pretty family friendly.
2355560	2361000	Final Fantasy IX is pretty friendly Final Fantasy for a cartoon like this. Say friendly Final
2361000	2366680	Fantasy. Family friendly Final Fantasy. Barring a few changes, it should work out and be pretty
2366680	2373720	interesting. Yeah, I'm super curious about it. I think as you referred to there, Loki,
2373720	2378840	it's not the only thing that's getting a TV show because there's that Final Fantasy XIV TV show
2378840	2383080	that we're supposed to be getting as well. That's not animated, but that was the thing because that's
2383080	2387880	by the same studio that does The Witcher and all that stuff. That'll be interesting. It'll be
2387880	2392840	awesome, but we haven't heard anything on it in some time. But granted, all the early announcements
2392840	2399480	were right before the pandemic. I'm sure that has slowed the plans down significantly. So I get it.
2399480	2404280	But I just know that that's the thing that's kind of like in the works as well. Tiger Kong chat says
2404280	2410200	why not animate the first Final Fantasy? Do a series based on the first game that started it all.
2410200	2413960	You know, that's an interesting game coming out. Yeah, I was just gonna say there's a game coming
2413960	2419160	out. You have that Final Fantasy origin and chaos, chaos, chaos. Well, chaos was
2420280	2426920	a villain in Final Fantasy I. Also, Final Fantasy I didn't really have set protagonists.
2427480	2432600	Remember, you got to pick your party and who was in the party and whatever names you wanted
2432600	2438360	to give them. So the character design didn't really start until Final Fantasy II, which had
2438360	2443080	more defined characters. And I mean, Final Fantasy II on the NES actually had, you know, characters
2443080	2447080	that you played. It's just the job system was different. But Final Fantasy I was really,
2447800	2452280	the warriors of light could kind of be anybody. And so that might be, I mean, and sure, sure,
2452280	2458040	for the purposes of a story, give them defined roles. Make a black mage named whatever, a white,
2458040	2462840	you know, make, make those characters. But I want to say, wasn't there a Final Fantasy anime a long
2462840	2467480	time ago that explored that already? It was based on V. It was based on Final Fantasy V. I don't
2467480	2476120	remember what, it wasn't called Final Fantasy, I don't think. It was like Legend of the Crystals
2476120	2482040	or something like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm trying to remember. Oh, no, it was, yeah,
2482040	2488040	Legend of the Crystals, Final Fantasy. That's what it was. So, yeah, I just think, not bad. Yeah,
2488040	2491720	I just think that might be the issue with trying to go all the way out to Final Fantasy I. And
2491720	2496440	as was said earlier there, they're going the game direction with that anyway. So maybe they just,
2496440	2499720	you know, since they have 15 Final Fantasy games, they're going to branch them out in all these
2499720	2504520	different directions. Where's the justice for Final Fantasy XI? Are they ever going to revisit
2504520	2512120	Final Fantasy XI? That's, that's my question at this point. Well, yeah, I don't know. Yeah.
2514280	2519960	Can we get a Dissida, like, anime or something like that? That would be interesting. No One
2519960	2524440	Special. That would be weird. That would be interesting. No One Special 77 in chat says,
2524440	2528440	with Final Fantasy I character names, they were limited to four characters a piece,
2528440	2533400	really limiting in English, but in Japanese, you can do more with the characters. So it was one of
2533400	2541160	those things that just didn't localize as well, especially for an old NES cart. So, Fifth Dream
2541160	2546680	in chat says, still waiting for the spirits within game. I, I still will die on the hill that spirits
2546680	2550040	within should have been Final Fantasy VIII and Final Fantasy VIII should have been the movie.
2550040	2556280	That's, I will find me a hill to go die on because that's it. So, all right. Anyway,
2556920	2562520	let's move on. Talk about another big Square series. How about the Mana series? And it's kind
2562520	2567160	of interesting because we've been kind of seeing more Mana games pop up, right? We had the secret
2567160	2571800	amount of remake not that long ago, Trials of Mana finally localized after all these years,
2571800	2576840	and then it gets a remake as well. Legend of Mana, for better or for worse, in my opinion,
2577400	2585080	that remake just hit, right? So, what's happening with Mana next? Well, get this, producer Masaru
2585080	2592440	Oyamata confirmed during the 30th anniversary live stream that just happened that a new Mana series
2592440	2597880	game for console is in development. I think they also announced one for phones and people were kind
2597880	2603640	of like, but there is one for consoles that is in development. And say, it's saying in the
2603640	2608440	announcement, we wanted to announce it by running a cool trailer, but we're only at the start of
2608440	2614200	the 30th anniversary, but we are in fact developing a new title, but please wait a little while longer
2614200	2619960	until the proper announcement. Although we did have the Mana series creator, Kochi Ishii, take
2619960	2624600	a look at it a little bit ago. We're at that level of development, so please look forward to it.
2624600	2629000	Development still has some way to go. We're developing for console, so I hope you can look
2629000	2634440	forward to it. So meaning, don't expect the game anytime soon. This is probably, honestly, a 2023
2634440	2641480	game if nothing else. But still exciting to hear that because the Mana series has been doing so
2641480	2646760	well in the remakes, not only do we finally get second at set to three after all these years
2646760	2652440	localized, but essentially we're getting second at set to five after all these years is basically
2652440	2658760	what they're making. And that's outstanding news. I have high hopes for this. What do you guys
2658760	2665080	think about a new Mana game coming? As long as it isn't like Trials of Mana. I'm not Trials of Mana,
2665080	2672760	but the last one. Legend of Mana. Legend of Mana, yeah. Which I kind of stupidly got in Japanese.
2673640	2680840	Oh, I remember the story. Yeah. Yeah, and I just, I didn't enjoy it. I'm gonna be honest. I kind of
2680840	2686120	want to give it another go. I kind of, because I remember I really didn't like it on PlayStation
2686120	2691080	when it came out, but I can also admit it came out during a very different period in my life
2691080	2694520	when what I was looking for in gaming was a little bit different and I was a little more maybe
2694520	2701320	tunnel visioned. And so there is a part of me that wants to give it another go. So I'm on the fence,
2701320	2706200	you guys. Send me, convince me. Send me your best tweet. Convince me to play Legend of Mana and give
2706200	2711880	the remake a try. Twitter.com slash Mr. Rob Roberts. How's that for a cheap plug? Love that.
2712440	2716600	All right. Also, and I thought this was interesting because, and Jason kind of referenced
2716600	2721640	it in tonight's intro. He messaged me before the show. I hadn't heard this, but when he was putting
2721640	2727720	the show roll together, he said, did you know they actually mentioned that there is also a
2727720	2733800	Legend of Mana, the teardrop crystal anime that's in the works. So there was a lot coming out of
2733800	2739400	this Mana 30th anniversary stream. And here we go. And we just talked about a Final Fantasy anime.
2739480	2744200	Guess what? Legend of Mana is getting an anime as well. And it doesn't really matter how I feel
2744200	2748840	about the game because animes aren't games. They're very different. Again, it could be a
2748840	2754040	very interesting way to tell the story. So it will be developed. It's going to be animated by
2754040	2759880	Graffinica. I hope I said that right. In collaboration with Yokohama Animation Lab.
2759880	2765960	No release date yet, but producer Masaru Oyamata said about it. When the animation project was
2765960	2769960	first pitched to me, the remastering of Legend of Mana was not even in discussion.
2769960	2774440	I initially attended the meeting without deep thoughts, but when Mr. Iwata from Warner Brothers
2774440	2778600	Japan passionately pitched the Legend of Mana animation project with so much love,
2778600	2784200	I realized I needed to create the game as soon as I can. So rumor has it, that's how the HD
2784200	2790120	remaster project began. That's very interesting. Fans of the Legend of Mana, please be assured
2790120	2795480	the people involved in the project have lots of love for the series. So that's pretty cool.
2795560	2800680	That's very interesting that the discussion about the anime led to the game getting re-released
2800680	2806040	after all. I just figured the Trials of Mana, the Secret of Mana and like those remakes just
2806040	2813560	performed very well. So I guess my last question is, where's justice for Secret of Evermore? Look,
2814600	2820440	look, Secret of Evermore, AKA, I think I have the cart around somewhere too. It's like one of the
2820440	2827080	few carts I still have. More like Secret of Nevermore. Look, look, justice for Square USA,
2827080	2833720	okay? Secret of Evermore was not as bad as everyone says it was. Like, I thought it was a,
2833720	2840360	it was, I mean, was it the same? No, but I like the gameplay was very heavily inspired by
2840360	2843960	Secret of Mana. And I liked the different direction that it went in. I kind of liked
2843960	2848440	that it was set in a more modern day, you know, kind of setting a more relatable real world
2848440	2853720	setting I thought was really cool. So yeah, where's my justice for Secret of Evermore?
2853720	2858360	You're doing all these other remasters. Come on, come on, at least, at least put it on virtual
2858360	2865640	console if nothing else. Anyway, DJ Rama S in chat highlights a message saying, Secret of Evermore
2865640	2871800	goes on the shelf with Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. Well, then here I am walking up to DJ Rama S's
2871800	2876680	shelf and taking those games off the shelf and putting them in my Super Nintendo to play Secret
2876680	2881320	of Evermore and to listen to the music in Mystic Quest because that's really the only good part,
2881320	2888200	but it still had really good music, okay? I'll play that game just to hear the music.
2889320	2893960	Is there any, is there any game that you will play even though you don't really care for the game
2893960	2899800	just to hear the music? Chat or hosts, any game that you don't really care for the game,
2899800	2901960	but the music's so good, you'll play it anyway.
2904920	2912040	Orange Wright says, Sonic R. I actually like Sonic R. Have fun with it.
2913560	2918280	Bobby Blackwell says, Advent Rising. Oh, that's a good one. The early Xbox game. Heck yeah,
2918280	2924520	Quest Buster agrees with that. Obi Wan Jibroni, Streets of Rage 2. Good call. I don't think those
2924520	2928280	Streets of Rage games have aged very well. Personally, it's a personal opinion, but the
2928280	2934120	soundtracks, chef's kiss. I want a new Xenogears game. Is that something that we can do?
2936760	2944760	Write a letter, tweet. We can try. E3VL. All these old Square franchises. I mean, why not?
2945400	2951880	E3VL in chat says, why not just listen to the OST? Look, I don't need your facts and analysis right
2951880	2957240	now. I don't need your simple solution. Let me do it the complicated way.
2959960	2964440	I can think of a game, I really enjoyed the game, but it was hard as balls. And that was Solstice
2964440	2970040	on the NES. And it had the most amazing soundtrack. I never got very far in the game,
2970040	2974600	but I would play it just to hear the music. That's for sure. And especially back in the day when a
2974600	2978760	lot of these games released, we weren't getting OSTs. I think that's also a big part of it.
2979640	2983880	That was a Japan only thing. We didn't get them over here. And streaming media wasn't a thing
2983880	2989800	yet. Hell, Napster wasn't a thing yet back when I first played Mystic Quest, that's for sure.
2991240	2999400	I had friends that would make me cassette tapes of different soundtracks. I would get anime and
2999400	3004680	video game mix tapes. Didn't you do that on the internet? You dumped some stuff to the internet,
3004680	3010920	like the early... Was it Bust a Move? Bust a Move. I dumped the track rips from Bust a Move.
3010920	3013880	I thought that was the thing I remember you talking about in an earlier episode,
3013880	3019720	way earlier episode. Yeah. So fun. I had what I think it was like a PSX viewer
3020520	3030200	that lets you view the raw data on a PlayStation game disc. So that's how we also got all those
3031080	3037640	Symphony of the Night quote lines and everything. That's how they found the unused evil Maria ending.
3038600	3043480	Actually, now that I think about it, since it just got brought up, I will shut the fuck up
3043480	3049080	completely about Secret of Evermore getting a remake if Square Enix will bring back Bust a Move.
3050680	3056600	Because that was an Enix thing. So I'll give up my Secret of Evermore if it means a new Bust a Move.
3056600	3063080	How about that? Let's move on. Dark Sakura, what else do we have? This is a really interesting
3063080	3078920	story. So rightfully so, there's a lot of voice actors in arms over the advent of the AI voice
3078920	3089480	actor. They're like, for example, Witcher 3, A Night to Remember has new voice lines, but it was
3089480	3103000	used, well, that is it was done by a modder using basically a speech parody was what he calls it,
3103880	3115080	that he was able to use an AI trained on the original voice actor's speech to create
3115080	3125400	new lines. And so several voice actors are like, this is terrible. And a quote from Jay Britten,
3125400	3134840	who was a voice actor on Divinity Original Sin 2 and Pathfinder. I'll go ahead and read the quote.
3134840	3139400	Yes, AI might be able to replace things, but should it? We literally get to decide. Replacing
3139400	3148760	actors with AI is not only a legal minefield, but an utterly soulless choice. And this basically came
3148760	3158280	out after Obsidian, the developer, put a video out about it working with a semantic, which has
3158280	3167000	AI voices for placeholders until the voice actors are decided on to do their lines. That way,
3167560	3174360	they can use it to check out dialogue, to check conversation flow, to do base animation,
3174600	3184760	to the cadence of speech. And one of the voice actors, though, from Assassin's Creed Valhalla,
3184760	3191880	Natalie Winter, her quote, though, is she says, there's this knee jerk concern of it's going to
3191880	3197720	take our jobs. And I do believe in some cases that will happen. It's sad to think if AI voices become
3197720	3203640	good enough to be widely used, then those opportunities will decrease again. And that's
3203640	3213160	referring to the tight, tight competition as a video game voice actor. The modern question,
3213160	3217080	though, who didn't like to remember, said he used software called Cyber Voice to create the
3217080	3224680	new dialogue and the lines for Geralt. It's put out by a Russian company called Mind Simulation
3224680	3236440	Lab. And they often use that software to mimic many voices. It's really,
3240200	3247000	I would say, a very gray area right now, although a semantics CEO, Zina Qureshi,
3248760	3253160	said, and this is her quote, if actors are not comfortable with something, then it's a no go. We
3253160	3258440	take misuse very seriously. I'm sorry, that came actually. My apologies. I think that came from.
3261880	3269160	Yeah, actually, that did come from her, so I'm sorry. But at any rate, they reached out to
3269160	3278360	one of the spokespeople. And this is from an input magazine, by the way, from SAG-AFTRA Union about
3278360	3286760	how it would affect an actor's credit. And they replied in email, it would be ultimately up to
3286760	3291960	the actor as currently video game companies do not have a right to continue using a performer's voice
3291960	3297800	to create something new without their permission. So it would be so SAG-AFTRA would negotiate for
3297800	3305720	fair compensation if that came to the line. But there's nothing that prohibits anyone from
3305720	3317960	synthesizing any voice. And indeed, some of these places are calling it parody to, I guess,
3317960	3326440	get around. They're doing that to get away with it. Exactly. And on top of that, they're saying
3326440	3332200	that no AI is perfect. You're not going to get spontaneity out of the voice or the essence of
3332200	3339960	humanity as one quote. But I don't know, when I watched that video that was put out by Semantic,
3340760	3350440	it was pretty expressive. And they're like, now we have screaming and this, that, and the other.
3354120	3359480	But they're still thinking that it's a diminishment of their craft.
3360280	3367480	I'm kind of with SAG-AFTRA on that. Yeah. And personally, now I look at it like this.
3368600	3380200	Say that you have a finely woven Turkish rug, right? And the ones that take the thousands of
3380200	3387720	dollars, they take up to a year to create. Now imagine you buy a rug that looks identical,
3387720	3393400	that was just made in some factory. After a while, you're going to be able, you know,
3393400	3397640	you're going to hear, see degradation. You're going to hear degradation in the quality.
3398360	3406200	And it's not, you would probably have to put more work into tweaking the vocal output to make it
3406200	3413800	sound actually human than you would to pay your voice actor. And voice actors do not get paid as
3413800	3419880	handsomely as one might think. And I know Quest Buster is bringing up a Vocaloids 2.0. This is
3419880	3430280	completely different. Vocaloids are meant to sound digital. It is a synthesized voice. This is
3430280	3438360	actually meant to completely mimic a human voice. And on top of that, certain human voices.
3439160	3443320	I completely understand where SAG-AFTRA is coming from though, in saying that basically,
3443400	3448200	and I think that the point for me is really the part where you don't have permission to use the
3448200	3453240	voice actor's voice beyond what they were compensated for. So I mean, if a developer
3453240	3458840	wants to keep using the voice and they're going to use this, you know, AI stuff to do it, then okay,
3458840	3464600	but you need to compensate that voice actor. Now, I think that's being said, I think it's important
3464600	3469320	to understand the perspective of this story is that you have an individual modder who kind of
3469320	3474120	did this. This isn't like, it's not like CD Projekt RED did this. They didn't do that.
3474120	3479880	And on top of that, they're anonymous. Yeah. So I kind of think just the good,
3479880	3484680	decent thing to do, if you're an anonymous modder, who's going to do this kind of thing and put it
3484680	3489160	out for free on the internet, I think if you go and make money off it, you're setting yourself
3489160	3494280	up for trouble. If you're giving it away for free, I think you need to carry that disclaimer
3494280	3499560	that says these voices are, you know, manipulated or whatever, you know, whatever the,
3500120	3503080	an appropriate language would be there. I don't- Synthesized, I would say.
3503080	3508600	Yeah. Synthesized or artificial. But I also completely, I know people may strongly disagree
3508600	3513880	with me and say, Rob, it's not appropriate in any situation, but I'm also saying you're absolutely
3513880	3518520	right, but that's not a realistic outlook on how the internet works. So if the technology is out
3518520	3522760	there, people are going to use it. So we kind of need to find that common ground of especially
3522760	3528600	the free modding stuff, what should they do? And I think a disclaimer is probably appropriate.
3529160	3533240	Companies should use this under no circumstance, unless they're going to compensate the
3533960	3537800	voice actors. And even- Well, it is impressive,
3538840	3548760	you know, and I think that, I mean, we use a synthesized voice almost every day with,
3549320	3557880	be it Siri or Alexa or Waze, you know, when you're using their mappy thing.
3559560	3563560	Synthesized voice is all around us and the technology is getting better and better.
3565080	3573400	I was listening to some of the synthesis that they did for WWDC for, you know, how Siri is
3573400	3582840	supposed to sound in the future. And it was utterly amazing. I really think that with any
3582840	3588600	technology, there's always room for abuse. And I also think that any company is going to try to
3588600	3597320	save themselves some money when they can. At the same time, they need to be completely aware of the
3597320	3602680	muck that they're stepping into. Right. Interesting perspective in chat.
3602680	3606440	So a pod culture in chat says it would be great for things like Star Trek,
3606440	3612520	where Majeel as the voice of the Enterprise is no longer with us. I support that if they're
3612520	3619000	compensating her estate by continuing to use the voice. That's different. If her estate agrees to
3619000	3623000	it and says, yes, this is a nice way to carry the tradition and here's the coin we're going to get
3623000	3630040	from that, then I think it's OK. And it's not that different from movies that used footage of
3630040	3635560	Marlon Brando to get him back in the Superman movie after he's been gone for years and years,
3635560	3639160	you know, but I'm sure his estate got compensated for that. Exactly.
3639160	3645240	That's what it's all about. So, you know, everything becoming more and more, you know,
3645800	3650680	advanced, it's going to be interesting, especially with some of these, you know,
3650680	3654520	folks that are going to pass on and they'll be back in movies again.
3654520	3658840	Well, and I can I also completely understand from the voice actor and actress's perspective
3658840	3664280	is that there may be language they don't want to say that then gets me like, for example,
3664280	3668120	you know, we have what this is, eight hundred and seventy four episodes of Orange Lounge Radio.
3668120	3672440	If somebody wanted to deconstruct our voices in one of these things, and I'm sure it's very easy
3672440	3679080	to do, I would be very upset if my voice showed up saying things that I would not say. I would
3679080	3685720	be very, very mad at that. So it's like it's really getting into murky territory.
3685720	3690520	Yeah, absolutely. So like something something like you when you'd say like, you know,
3690520	3695800	Krenner Trigger is the best video game out there is better than Metroid.
3695800	3698600	I would absolutely sue. I would absolutely sue. And honestly,
3699160	3702520	that's what it's going to come down to. And that's when they're going to be able to say,
3702520	3707560	no, this is not parody. When one of these games has a voice actor say something that is against
3707560	3710440	because, you know, actors have the right to say, no, they're not going to do a certain line of
3710440	3714200	dialogue or they're not going to do a certain thing. I'm going to tell you, that's going to be
3714200	3717800	when one of these voice actors, you know, or somebody that gets deep faked with one of these
3717800	3723080	things is going to go through the roof and sue somebody out of the universe for using something
3723080	3726760	and saying something they would never say. So that that's will be what it comes down to.
3727560	3733160	Now, one, though, there are there are some positive uses for this, like text to speech
3733160	3739400	synthesis. Sure. Which I think is going into party chat on Xbox. I think it is. I think it
3739400	3746440	just went in there recently. It might be a testing beta thing, but yeah. And I think that for people
3746440	3752920	who have trouble speaking, like imagine that you have a nonverbal autistic person, they could very
3752920	3760440	well use speech synthesis to have a voice design their own virtual voice. I mean, imagine what
3760440	3766120	would have happened if Stephen Hawking had this. Sure. But the voice would have had MC Hawking,
3766120	3771400	but still the voices in those situations would probably be well aware they're donating
3771400	3776760	themselves to medicine or getting compensated or whatever the case may be. So in those situations,
3776760	3783480	like I'm sure there is, you know, some type of consent from the voice to actually to actually
3783480	3789160	do that, like Siri's voice or any automated assistance voice. Right. They get they get
3789160	3796520	compensated for that. So anyway. Let's see. Oh, that's interesting. Bobby Black Wolf says
3796520	3801800	Stephen Hawking actually chose to keep the robotic voice even when they synthesized his real voice.
3801800	3807560	I can understand why, though. Yeah. I mean, that was for all intents and purposes,
3807560	3813160	his voice at that point. Right. So and again, all these things are, you know, if the voice
3813160	3818040	actor agrees, if the person that is to use it agrees. And in that case, Stephen Hawking's
3818040	3825240	didn't agree. So that was it. So anyway. All right. So, yeah, I think this I think this is
3825240	3830040	one of the things that's kind of going to remain interesting while a modder uses it. But again,
3830040	3834680	the first time somebody says something they would never say otherwise gets put out there.
3835960	3841960	It's going to get ugly real quick. All right. Let's move on. Talk about our next story. Loki.
3842920	3850440	Yeah, so this is fun, I guess. So we kind of knew that this was going to be happening sooner or
3850440	3858920	later. But Facebook is testing VR ads in different games. So one of the first games to kind of test
3858920	3865080	out this brand new type of in game advertising is a game called Blaston, which is on the Oculus
3865080	3872360	Quest. And as such, there's been massive backlash against it. So finally, you know,
3873000	3880840	the devs behind it resolution games have decided to pull out of that testing program, basically
3880840	3884520	saying after listening to player feedback, we realized blastin isn't the best fit for this
3884520	3890520	type of advertising test. Therefore, we no longer plan to implement the test. But you know, people
3890600	3894600	have been just saying, Listen, you know, I'm not going to buy your game, I'm going to refund it,
3894600	3901720	I'm going to, you know, throw away my quest. I lots of crazy stuff, but it's coming. I mean,
3901720	3907000	they're testing it. We knew that when Facebook was buying Oculus that this is what's going to happen
3907000	3912520	tracking and ads. So yeah. And I actually think it's unfortunate, I actually think this story
3912520	3917400	has nothing to do with VR as much as I mean, it's just it just so happens this game is a VR game,
3917400	3922760	as much as it has to do with Facebook getting into VR and what people's apprehensions were
3922760	3927400	about that in the first place. Because remember, this isn't just about showing you ads in the game
3927400	3933800	that you've already purchased. It's about showing you curated and targeted ads. And that's where
3933800	3939560	that's where the real sinisterness of this comes out is that 10 by the way, it's not a free play
3939560	3944600	game or anything like that. It's a game that you bought. And then they're sneaking not just not
3944600	3948920	just any ad, because a lot of the stuff you play on like PlayStation, like let's say you bought
3948920	3953960	because honestly, people are taking issue with this in other games to like Street Fighter five,
3953960	3958120	you will sometimes load up a match and it's a match presented by you know, such as Oh,
3958120	3962600	gosh, yeah, where they like skin everything. Yeah, I remember talking about that even when
3962600	3966840	it was just like a Capcom fighting tournament or something, but like kind of where it's going to go.
3966840	3972520	Now, let's just say now, resolution games hasn't necessarily backed out completely attesting these
3972520	3979320	ads. So they've moved the test from the blast into bait, which is a free to play fishing game
3979320	3985080	that they released back in 2019. So they're still doing the test. But I mean, it seems more
3985080	3991080	appropriate in a free to play game. But still, though, it's like, I don't know. I mean, I know
3991080	3996440	they're throwing money at these devs, obviously. So it's good money for them. But it's also I don't
3996520	4002040	that's gross. It's Facebook. I just don't like it. You said that game is called Bait.
4003000	4010360	Bait. It's bait bait. So. So Facebook's want to know, do you like to bait?
4012440	4019080	All right. Let's see other comments in chat. Fifth Dream says I block everything to master
4019080	4024840	that game. But, you know, keep trying. Keep keep keep keep practicing a bait.
4026120	4032840	One day you'll masturbate. Fifth Dream in chat says I block everything on Facebook except people
4032840	4038040	or groups I follow. So I don't know what they think I like, but I'm obviously not interacting
4038040	4042680	with ads. Zen Monkey in chat says they backed out. What they're probably going to do is make
4042680	4049560	people buy loot in games. So, yeah. And this is I think even the people that we're trying to say,
4049560	4054440	oh, well, maybe Facebook's getting into this, you know, to bring more real life things into VR and
4054440	4058200	that we're giving Facebook the benefit of the doubt. Now that this is happening, it's like
4059480	4064840	fucking Facebook sucks. Fuck them. So there's there's that as well. But the problem is, I think
4064840	4069560	even if you like block things on Facebook, Facebook puts tracking things in other things
4069560	4074120	around the Internet. So it still figures out a way to follow you. Yeah, because even if you
4074120	4078440	don't have a Facebook account, they still have these like shell accounts that they
4079480	4086040	come up with, you know, stuff based on your tracking stuff. So, yeah, it's I have a nice
4086040	4090920	plug in that pretty much blocks most of that. A couple of others that I've been using. Well,
4090920	4095880	I'm I'm really glad that other companies, too, are starting to step up and give the people what they
4095880	4102680	want. And that's enhanced privacy, such as Apple's newest iOS that basically, you know, Facebook
4102680	4107080	literally was kicking and screaming on the table over that privacy update because they knew
4107080	4111400	it was going to, you know, really kick them. It's going to fuck them up. It's going to fuck up what
4111400	4119240	their whole business is about. Good. Very good. And I hope more people kind of take, you know,
4119240	4122520	following us. You know, so interesting. I saw a giant bill since I was driving home from the
4122520	4127400	Bay today, I saw a giant billboard on the road home advertising, I think Duk Duk Goose,
4127400	4133480	one of those companies. Yeah. That actually says, you know, go is that I'm sorry, go. Yeah,
4133480	4140520	I called it Duk Duk Goose. Well, whatever. So I met you, man. Clearly, clearly the billboard
4140520	4148840	worked on me. Can you get on the Internet's and find me Duk Duk Goose? Anyway, so whatever it is
4148840	4154680	called Duk Duk Go, fine. There's a, they have an ad where it's like, do you want more privacy
4154680	4159640	online? Or it's for people who value the privacy online. It's like, why don't you just say for
4159640	4163560	people that want to give the middle finger to fucking Zuckerberg? Why don't they just say that
4163560	4170600	on the billboard? Cause I'd buy, I'd probably remember the name if it had said that. Anyway.
4170600	4176280	All right. Enough about why Facebook irritates me, but you know what? I got a lot of likes on
4176280	4181880	the selfie I posted yesterday, so I guess these are the things I give up to have that attention.
4181880	4189240	Well, and Duk Duk Go is one of the built-in preferences for search engines in Safari.
4189960	4196200	Oh, I didn't know that. That's cool. Yeah, it is. All right. Let's move on and talk about Tekken
4196200	4200280	Cross Street Fighter. Did you know that Tekken Cross Street Fighter is still a thing we're
4200280	4206120	talking about in 2021? Because I bet like me, you pretty much figured this game was dead and
4206120	4211880	they just never really announced it. And as it turns out, that was kind of the case. It's
4211880	4218600	interesting. I realize this story has been updated, so please let me hear me out, folks.
4218600	4224120	So originally what happened earlier this week is that there was a report that came out that
4224680	4230280	Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada mentioned on his YouTube, Harada's Bar,
4230280	4235560	that Tekken Cross Street Fighter was about 30% done when it was canceled, which we kind of all
4235560	4243160	figured happened. Like the minute I saw Akuma show up in Tekken 7, I was like,
4243160	4247880	that's all the Tekken Street Fighter you're going to get. That's what happened to Tekken
4247880	4253160	Cross Street Fighter. That's it. There it is. Enjoy it. But yeah, apparently the game had
4253160	4258600	been in development. It was about 30% done and then it was canceled according to this YouTube.
4258600	4265160	But I'm sure some of you know, there was a follow-up where Katsuhiro Harada kind of clarified
4265160	4271480	some of those comments saying that the English subtitles didn't properly translate what he was
4271480	4278680	trying to say in Japanese. So he said that the game is in a pending state or on pause.
4278680	4284280	So what he meant to say was up to 30% of the development was in progress, but now it is still
4284280	4289320	pending. This is still the status of the project and we are still hopeful that Tekken Cross Street
4289320	4293880	Fighter will resume development when the opportunity arises. However, such a title cannot
4293880	4298040	be moved just for the convenience of one company in terms of marketing and branding. And it also
4298040	4302440	affects each other's development resources. For now, we're just waiting for the right opportunity.
4302440	4307800	Look, nothing but respect for Katsuhiro Harada and this project that he's working on in a game
4307800	4313160	I would have really loved to see. But like when you put a project on pause like that for an
4313160	4319000	indefinite period of time, when you don't know when it's restarting again, that's canceled.
4319560	4325880	Or it becomes another game. The game was canceled. Yeah. So, you know, we're getting into a
4325880	4331560	terminology war here, but it's not to say, and I think this is very important. It's not to say that
4331560	4340760	a canceled game will never show up again. Metroid Dread is calling. Ring, ring. You just saw that
4340760	4345320	a couple of weeks ago. That was a canceled game. I was going to say Star Fox 2. Oh, there you go.
4345320	4350600	There's another one. Absolutely. So it's not that canceled games will never see the light of day.
4351560	4356360	It's just it was. And how many of us had burned copies of Thrill Kill?
4357640	4365160	That was pretty much finished. Oh boy. No one special 77 in chat says odds are we'll see
4365160	4370360	Half-Life 3 before we see Tekken Cross Street Fighter. I have two answers for that. Number
4370360	4376680	one, you already saw Half-Life 3. It's called Half-Life Alyx. Number two, I actually think
4376680	4382280	you'll see Tekken Cross Street Fighter first, because I think it's interesting that this renewed
4382280	4386760	interest in it could be interesting. I'm not saying it's going to make just because this
4386760	4392280	happens is going to make it happen. But I do think there's kind of a renewed interest in it. And
4393160	4397640	you never know. You never know. Like I said, nothing gets canceled forever. But I do think
4397640	4403400	Half-Life 3 just isn't happening at this point or Half-Life exists in other stories such as Half-Life
4403400	4407560	Alyx that they did not want to call Half-Life 3 because then people would have been blue in the
4407560	4414760	face angry about Half-Life 3 as VR only. So anyway, compliment from a fifth dream in your
4414760	4420200	chat on your nails saying nice color. Thank you for the podcast, folks. Dark Soccer showed off
4420200	4425240	her nails on cam, which were I was kind of painting them because they were looking kind of
4425240	4431080	gross. So is that like a metallic purple? I can't. It's hard for me. It's actually a holographic
4431080	4439560	purple. OK, so it it'll it'll be all hollow when it's dried. OK, very cool. All right. Let's move
4439560	4445160	on. I think we have Dark Soccer with another story. We do. And it's another Whopper. All
4445160	4452600	right, everybody, time to whip out your brain. Well, not literally. Well, there are people who
4453560	4459880	to to quote the the scarecrow, a lot of people without brains do an awful lot of talking.
4459880	4466280	Was it was anyway, wasn't that the ending to Hannibal? Moving on. No, I don't remember. I
4466280	4471000	didn't watch actually I didn't watch Hannibal. I just watched, you know, Silence of Lambs.
4471000	4475480	I did because I love Julianne more. And I remember just thinking the whole time what.
4475480	4485640	Anyway, so there are different things that gaming can do to your brain.
4488200	4491800	Now, they bring up World of Warcraft for a big one, for people who are addicted to their MMOs,
4491800	4501960	right? But there's a reason people call it World of Warcrack, right? And now you remember when I
4501960	4506840	was playing it, I was way into it. I did nothing but play well. I think we were kind of all in
4506840	4513560	that at one point, right? Addict. Well, yeah, but we were kind of addicted to it, right?
4513560	4521000	A little bit. Yeah, I think so. But it is. So I'm going to go through different things for
4521000	4527720	video games and we're going to start with addiction. So Mark, I think it's Palau,
4528280	4538440	who has a PhD in cognitive neuroscience. He says that one aspect to understand how addictions work
4538440	4544600	is the reward system of the brain. The reward system mediates how pleasant stimuli, such as
4544600	4549560	the presence of food, water, social interaction, blah, blah, blah, acts as positive reinforcers
4549560	4554600	for the behavior. So when we're exposed to that pleasurable thing, we want it more and more,
4554600	4565000	like with a drug, right? And so there's now support groups for recovering from video game
4565000	4576440	addiction, or from being addicted to MMOs and stuff, right? So they are now going into
4577080	4586440	the quick hits, more like the instant dopamine, right? So talking about things like Fortnite,
4587560	4597400	where your games are quick like that, for us, even Dead by Daylight, what these do
4597400	4604920	is it's going to give you just that quick release of dopamine. The neurotransmitter that goes,
4604920	4611880	oh, happy, happy brain, happy. And then after, you know, your match and whichever game that
4611880	4616920	you're playing, you know, the more dopamine that gets released, the better you feel and
4616920	4628600	the greater your desire to play another. So. I have absolutely noticed the effect of Dead
4628600	4634120	by Daylight specifically since you brought that up. Not so much on the brain part that you're
4634120	4638760	talking about, but my heart rate, because, you know, when you wear one of these smartwatches,
4638760	4642520	it's taking your heart rate all the time. And I absolutely notice when I'm playing survivor
4642520	4647240	matches that are intense, I'm getting chased and, you know, and all that stuff. Like I look at my
4647240	4650840	log and I can tell what points of the day I was playing Dead by Daylight because my heart rate
4650840	4654360	literally goes up. It's fascinating. I should check what mine is, is killer.
4654360	4659960	Yeah. Same thing happens to me is killer. I don't feel much the same way. I just get angry,
4660040	4665400	insulting. You should add it to your streams, like add it as a thing. I used to do that with EDR.
4666840	4671960	So with mine, like with my Fitbit, they have a Bluetooth thing. You're supposed to be able to
4671960	4676840	sync it to your PC and be able to display that. And I do a screen capture, but that never worked.
4676840	4683560	So I had to always screen. I had my phone with the app open and then I had a piece of software
4683560	4689000	that screen captured the phone and put it into a window and I screen captured that and added
4689080	4693160	to OBS. And so that actually worked for DDR, but I mean, that would probably work for Dead
4693160	4695400	by Daylight too. Yeah. Interesting.
4695400	4703720	Well, I know that there are ways of, I mean, you can, you can definitely have your,
4704840	4710360	there's ways of streaming your iPhone, for example, and your watch syncs directly to your iPhone.
4710360	4715880	So just saying, but anyway, going into a little bit more about that.
4716840	4722360	There, there, this, this level of research that they're doing is still clearly in its infancy,
4722360	4729320	like very early. And, you know, the biggest things that people are in power anywhere focusing on is
4729320	4735640	that aspect of addiction. You know, they're always wanting to control what makes people happy,
4736360	4744920	but, and also they do it under the guise of, is this good for people, for example. And I agree
4745720	4751800	there are like legit places that are afraid of, of how it's going to affect the brain,
4751800	4757800	but it can also be a really good tool for improving your cognitive skills.
4757800	4764120	Now for when the research began in the nineties, the biggest thing that they were talking about
4764760	4770680	was neuroplasticity, which is a process where the brain changes and adapts when exposed to new
4770680	4775880	experiences. And the biggest thing, of course, they were talking about was hand-eye coordination.
4776440	4782680	You know, for example, how if, you know, when they were using Doom and Team Fortress to,
4783800	4790760	to do the test with, they published in 2016 of Scientific American, that individuals,
4790760	4793800	I'm going to quote here, individuals who regularly play action games demonstrate
4793800	4798760	improved ability to focus on visual details using useful for reading a fine print,
4798760	4802840	illegal document or on a prescription bottle. They also display heightened sensitivity to
4802840	4807880	visual contrast important when driving in thick fog, the multitasking required to switch back
4807880	4812280	and forth between reading a menu and holding a conversation with the dinner partner also comes
4812280	4819080	more easily. Video with this Wired article that I'm getting a lot from actually put some of that
4819080	4825480	into action with a light board where people have to hit the lights as they pop up.
4826440	4830920	And of course the pro gamer was better than the casual gamer.
4834120	4845000	So there's also from a Ted talk called Your Brain on Video Games. They talk about how
4848200	4852680	instead of, you know, what parents are saying that their kids are becoming a virtual zombie,
4853320	4861080	it's, it's boosting their brain activity. There's also another study from UC Irvine that showed that
4861080	4865960	3D games can improve functioning of the hippocampus, which is the part of the brain
4865960	4872040	that is used in learning and memory. Researchers from Queen Mary University of London and University
4872040	4876920	College London found that video games can aid mental agility and enhance strategic thinking,
4877880	4887640	which also, you know, goes back to a UX designer and gamer named James Mitchell who stated that
4887640	4891800	his critical thinking and strategy improved and he finds it easier to predict certain movements.
4892680	4897000	I've even noticed just with me getting back into playing like Dead by Daylight
4897960	4907960	that my reaction time in driving is better. Like I was on my breaks like really, really quickly
4907960	4914760	when someone, not someone, but it was a dog ran out in front of me in the neighborhood. I mean,
4914760	4920360	I was on it. I really felt that it was faster than how I might have been before. You know,
4921320	4927160	despite having almost broken my hand, I've found that I'm quick to find things that are out of
4927160	4932600	place. Like when my glasses fell off my bedside table, normally I'm fumbling around for a little
4932600	4936680	bit, but I happened to catch just a pale glint of light off of them in the dark and I found my
4936680	4945080	glasses. And I don't know, I want to say that my ability to notice things, and I already had a
4945080	4950120	pretty decent ability to see things that a lot of people around me didn't see, but I think that's
4950200	4955320	gotten even better. So maybe there was something to that whole hand-eye coordination argument we
4955320	4962040	used to use with our parents on why video games were good. Exactly. And I'm on top. Yeah. Well,
4962040	4969720	and the research is showing that you can become mentally more resilient, a faster thinker,
4969720	4979080	and even smarter in general, in real life. Oh, there was another one in there that also was
4979080	4986200	referring to the physical effects on the body as well. Like they had them play, do this thing
4986200	4990520	where you have to keep tapping on a green dot no matter what the voice you're hearing through
4990520	4995960	headphones is telling you. And that it actually builds up an anxiety response and the body reacts
4995960	5002440	to that. Your heart's racing by the time you're done with it. And just, and you were like, you
5002440	5008040	were saying with noticing your heart rate, you know, with your Apple watch. They're in these
5008040	5012760	experiences that we're having that are building the brain. Our bodies are physically reacting to
5012760	5019560	it. Now it's not going to be a replacement for taking a walk or lifting weights or doing some
5019560	5027800	physical activity, but your body is still building from it as well as your brain. So keep that in
5027800	5032440	mind. Um, I really liked this comment from Questbuster in our chat over twitch.tv slash
5032440	5037720	vog network, who says one story I like to go back to on games benefiting mental health is from a
5037720	5042680	story I dug up from the eighties when a psychologist related their experience on using wizardry
5042680	5046920	to help troubled children break out of their shells when they talked about the characters
5046920	5053960	they made, uh, clarifying wizard, the CRPG, not actual wizardry. Yo wizard Questbuster.
5055480	5060360	I don't know, but I'm oddly thinking of the episode of supernatural where the kid doesn't
5060360	5067000	want to talk to Sam or Dean. And so, uh, Garth brings out his sock puppet. Um, and the kid will
5067000	5072520	talk to the sock puppet. Hey, since you brought it up before we go to our next story, cause I
5072520	5076280	know somebody is going to ask cause I've seen it on our vog network discord. I'm not sure how often
5076280	5080920	you're you're in there, but somebody had tagged you in a, um, there's a supernatural prequel in
5080920	5088600	the works. Your thoughts quickly. All right. So I'm going to put it this way. I would probably
5088600	5096200	check it out. Okay. Yeah. But there are all these people up in arms over their dad being super
5096200	5101480	abusive because he was taking out his trauma and pain and ignoring his kids and treating them like
5101480	5109480	something. I'm not going to get into that argument. I, I could say a lot about inherited trauma,
5110920	5116840	but, um, and tiger call, don't even bother telling me anything about the supernatural
5116840	5124040	thing and how the actors reacted because I saw it. Um, I know that, uh, Jared posted his,
5124040	5131560	he played Sam posted his surprise and dismay at not having been told about it because the
5131560	5135960	production company behind this is owned by Jensen Ackles and his wife, Danielle. Um,
5137320	5141640	they're the ones that are behind this, but you know, apparently they talked about things are
5141640	5145560	cool again and people are going to react to the way they're going to react. I mean, I,
5145560	5149560	it wouldn't be the first time somebody has blown up about something on the internet that they were
5149560	5153080	kind of pissed about and then kind of regretted it later. You know, this happens all the time
5153080	5157400	with movie remakes too. Like the original stars aren't consulted about the movie remakes. They
5157400	5161240	just find out in the papers like everyone else does, Oh, they're remaking this movie. I was
5161240	5167880	started in the eighties. Same, same thing. Well, and that's the, that's the thing about it,
5167880	5178920	you know, and I, there are groups in Twitter that I am, I'd say peripherally part of, but I am the
5178920	5186600	person that waits for fact. I try not to have an immediate emotional reaction to it. And I don't
5187240	5198600	look into it as a point as an excuse to attack somebody. There's no point in attacking somebody,
5198600	5205320	attacking a fucking character, attacking the actors, dragging people through the mud
5205320	5212680	over fiction. Don't say anything about it until it's out until you have something to actually
5212680	5217800	talk about. Okay. All right. Let's move on to our next story. Got to get it back to gaming.
5217800	5222440	I had to do the quick aside though, cause we all know you, you love Supernatural. And when I saw
5222440	5227960	that, uh, story this week, I was like, Ooh, I wonder what the opinion is. So, all right. Uh,
5227960	5235640	Loki. So, uh, it looks like that we're going to be getting an update to the X cloud, um,
5236360	5243320	game streaming. So before they were streaming that the quality of like, say an Xbox, uh, one level
5243320	5249720	of performance, but now it's actually going to be upgraded to Xbox series X quality. Um,
5249720	5255000	that's going to be going to Android and PC devices right now. Uh, they're still testing
5255000	5260280	the Xbox consoles, but that's nice to see that bump in quality though. Um,
5260280	5263800	especially with games like, you know, for the horizon five or in around the corner,
5264520	5271000	that should be pretty exciting. So, uh, yeah, looking forward to checking that out. I haven't
5271000	5276120	actually used the streaming, um, yet just because I have all of my stuff natively on my concert,
5276120	5283160	my PC, but sounds cool. I literally thought the cloud was already working this way is that was
5283160	5287480	the most surprising to me. I mean, I haven't been special enough to get a beta into this or
5287480	5291400	whatever. So I've been able to check it out myself, but I was kind of surprised it wasn't
5291400	5296840	already running on the series X quality. Why the hell wouldn't it? I like, it's just, it's, it's,
5296840	5300680	it's a little, I'm sorry. I mean, I don't, it's just a little shocking to me. It took them nine
5300680	5306440	months after the release of the console for, you know, the general public to put it on the cloud,
5306440	5312120	like way to demonstrate that the cloud is going to lag behind. I just, I think hopefully this is
5312120	5316920	the last sort of thing like this by Microsoft, because I sort of feel like if they want the
5316920	5323720	cloud to be competitive, the cloud has to be cutting edge and not lagging behind. It's just
5323720	5330360	weird to me. I don't understand why they did that approach. I don't know either testing, blah, blah,
5330360	5334360	blah, whatever. Maybe it could, it's just a little, little weird to me, but all right.
5335240	5340360	So, uh, you know, cause inevitably micro inevitably Microsoft will put out another
5340360	5344840	console, the series Y or a different, you know, a different family altogether.
5344840	5349720	Although they'll think of another dumb name for it, but yeah, it'll be something like that.
5349720	5354120	Whatever it is. If they really want to make impress people with it,
5354120	5358920	they really should put it on the cloud sooner so people can get a taste of it, honestly. But I,
5360120	5366440	that's just my opinion, I guess. So yeah. All right. Uh, moving on, let's talk about
5366440	5373800	the next Yakuza game. Uh, let's talk about that because, uh, I believe we know that there is a,
5373800	5379160	where there's different, um, series, you know, the Yakuza has got, uh, the, um, judgment kind
5379160	5382920	of spinoff that's going on now, because I believe the mainline games are going to follow a little
5382920	5387640	more in the tradition of like a dragon. Whereas the judgment games will go a little more in the,
5387640	5394520	um, the, the, the more traditional, uh, step. Um, so, uh, in the Yakuza series,
5394520	5400920	they've usually had playable versions of classic Sega games, and usually these are arcade classics.
5400920	5407960	However, lost judgment is going to be going a little different direction. Um, and, uh,
5407960	5414120	they're going to have a vintage master system to replace the pinball machine from the first game.
5414120	5420120	And I guess the master system actually, yeah. So, uh, the first menu you see, uh, it's an option
5420120	5425400	screen where you can like read the manual, change the region of the game. You can pause the game,
5425400	5429800	um, which I guess on the, and I didn't realize this on the original console, the pause was on
5429800	5434440	the console, not the controller. Um, but I guess, you know, thinking about old design,
5434440	5441320	it probably was that way. Uh, and then you see in the video Penguinland or Doki Doki Penguinland,
5441320	5447560	uh, before, uh, Takuya Kimura, uh, settles in to play Alex Kidd. So I think that's kind of
5447560	5455400	interesting. So, um, yeah, so, uh, lost judgment, of course, the sequel to 2019 judgment, uh,
5455400	5461560	and it's due out in September. So, you know, you can buy this new fancy Akusa game and play old
5461560	5467960	games in it to some extent. So weird that like a company would put their old catalog of games in
5467960	5475160	there without trying to sell it separately for more money. I mean, if only other larger companies
5475160	5480520	would take note of that and like, I don't know, offered in their game with animals and
5480520	5487800	town building, maybe that might be a good idea to do that and not be super greedy and just complete
5487800	5491880	dicks about it. I don't know. Well, Loki, I think the video game companies to that would say,
5495160	5496360	everything's about the bottom line.
5499080	5502920	I know, but what, what made us all check? I mean, at least for me, I guess I can't speak
5502920	5507000	for everyone, but what made me interested in animal crossing in the first play in the
5507000	5510760	very first place? Why did I give it, give a hoot about animal crossing on the game cube?
5510760	5514920	It was that little, little sticker right on the front that said comes with two classic NES games
5514920	5520120	and you can unlock many more that sold that game to me. And it's not necessarily that people are
5520120	5524600	going to like, I don't know why they're taking it as like, people are going to just not buy
5524600	5531080	the game now because they have it available in like another game to play. Like that's not the
5531080	5534840	case. Like, I don't think like, for example, with Yakuza, like a dragon, you know, I'm not
5535480	5540040	gonna, well, I'm not interested in virtual fighter. But like, if I was, I'm not gonna not
5540040	5545720	purchase like virtual fighter five. If you know, just because I can play it in a game,
5545720	5550520	it's inconvenient to do that just kind of a neat thing to be able to do that Sega is still selling
5550520	5557640	these games separately and collections that are available out there that you can purchase. I just
5557880	5562600	don't be greedy. Just come on. Like, I don't get it why they're doing this.
5562600	5568040	And Bobby, of course, and Chad is asking, have you played like a dragon yet? And sadly,
5568040	5571880	the answer is no. But that's because I'm kind of stretched on bandwidth right now. I can't,
5572520	5578200	I can't download any new games right now. We're like almost out of bandwidth. So either I just
5578200	5584440	have to suck it up and pay extra money or I'm going to try again next month. So that's a whole
5584520	5590440	other issue. Why? Why? We don't have, you know, two terabyte caps yet, but whatever.
5591000	5597000	Anyway, let's move on. Oh, I think this is an appropriate time after that story to get
5597000	5603560	into this segment.
5612520	5618520	Time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and
5618520	5624360	tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week. What is that classic game of the week?
5624360	5634280	Lemmings. Yes, I picked lemmings. I haven't done lemmings. I was surprised I haven't done lemmings
5634280	5639480	and it's been on fucking everything. I was really surprised. I swore we talked about
5639480	5642920	this game, but I guess we just talked about it. It wasn't highlighted. Yeah,
5642920	5648520	it's certainly not. And it's a game based off of something completely fabricated too.
5649480	5660440	So, because there was a study that was fabricated that said that lemmings will
5660440	5667400	follow each other off a cliff and into death and everything. And it was done in like,
5669240	5673640	oh gosh, what was it? Yeah, it was that they were driven to mass suicide when they,
5673800	5681080	uh, when they, uh, you know, go, it was, it was stupid. Anyway, so basically in Lemmings,
5681080	5687400	it's a puzzle. It's a puzzle game. It was originally developed by DMA design in Dundee,
5687400	5696040	Scotland and published by Psygnosis for the Amiga in 1991. So we have a 30 year old game.
5696040	5707720	Um, it was also ported for many, many, many, many, many other platforms. So it was also inspired
5707720	5717640	by an animation that was done with deluxe paint. So anyway, um, the objective of the game is to
5717640	5722280	take these anthropomorphized lemmings that look nothing like a lemming by the way, cause lemmings
5722280	5731000	are fucking adorable, um, do different obstacles to an exit. Um, you have to save a certain amount
5731000	5735720	of the lemmings to win. And if you want to think of like a more modern take on it, think of like
5735720	5744680	choo choo rocket. Uh, anyway, um, you, uh, assign different lemmings, one of eight different skills
5744680	5751480	that allow them to react with the landscape. So, um, it also affects the behavior of the
5751480	5760280	other lemmings that can make, uh, safe passages for them and all kinds of things. Um, it was the
5760280	5768120	second highest rated game for Strad. Um, and it was the eighth greatest game of all time by
5768120	5773960	next generation magazine as of 1996. And one of, again, one of the most widely ported and best
5773960	5779880	selling video games, um, for all of its various ports that sold over 200 million copies. Um,
5779880	5787800	there's sequels, remakes, spinoffs, inspired games, all kinds of stuff. Um, and it's, it's been
5787800	5798520	up there. Um, so at any rate, um, the original, um, the original game, uh, you had, uh, different
5798520	5804840	levels that had four difficulty categories and each level has a trap door opening from above that
5804840	5810440	releases a stream of lemmings to follow each other. And so, like I said before, you just have
5810440	5817080	to get them from point A to point B lemmings can die by falling from a great height, falling into
5817080	5823960	water or lava and disappearing off the bottom of the map, being caught in a trap or fire, um, or
5823960	5831320	being assigned to the bomber skill. Um, and, uh, every level of course has a time limit. If it's
5831320	5840360	down to zero, then it ends. So, uh, your levels of difficulty are, um, fun, tricky, taxing,
5840360	5847880	and mayhem. So I think that's pretty funny. There's also a, uh, two player mode, 22 player levels,
5848680	5855640	um, that actually took advantage of the Amiga's ability to support two simultaneous mice.
5856440	5861560	And then of course with the, uh, later on with the Atari's ability to, uh, play with a mouse
5861560	5868520	and joystick simultaneously. So, uh, you can, you know, do your own lemmings, you have their own
5868520	5875720	base, um, and you have to get more of more lemmings regardless of color into one's own base
5875720	5883000	than the other player. So you can actually lemming snipe. So, um, as for the development of the game,
5883400	5893880	it was, uh, uh, meant to just be a, just a fun little thing, but it was inspired by that one
5893880	5900040	little, uh, eight by eight pixel box. It was you using deluxe paint and it's just of a little
5900760	5910520	dude with blue hair walking. Um, and so, uh, it was actually as part of a development for
5911160	5914600	a game called Walker, which was supposed to be a sequel to a game called blood money.
5915240	5925320	Um, but as they went through, you know, they, uh, ended up just going with games with, with
5925320	5930680	their game and they kept going and there we go. We have a lemmings. I'm not going to go like way
5930680	5936920	into the history. If you want to know more about it, there's a, uh, a documentary, um, called the
5936920	5945400	lemming story and from 2006, you can all watch. Um, so going, going back then, so going into the
5945400	5954920	various, various assistance, um, there were released for Atari ST Sinclair spectrum, uh,
5954920	5966360	the ZX spectrum PC SNES. Um, after the game was ported to 20 systems, um, David Jones, who was,
5966360	5973960	uh, in part behind this, uh, basically steady, stop counting. Um, for other ones, other commercial
5973960	5979480	ports, we've had the 3dio, the acorn, the Archimedes, the, uh, apple two GS, uh, the
5979480	5985880	Macintosh and as in the old Macintosh, the CDTV, Commodore 64 NES master system, Genesis,
5985880	5992760	turbo graphics, 16 Phillips CDI and sharp X 68,000. Um, and then there was an open source cross
5992760	6001560	platform clone in 1998 called pingas P I N G U S. Um, psychosis has continuously owned
6001560	6006200	the license for lemming. And then of course now Sony owns it, but, um,
6008920	6014600	uh, but when of course, uh, signosis closed that made it fully owned by Sony. And so they've done
6014600	6021160	more modern remakes. We have lemmings for PSP done by team 17 has the original levels and a
6021160	6030520	bunch of others and data pack support. Um, there were, uh, you can make your own user levels
6030520	6038920	through a lemmings online community. There was, uh, uh, another one, uh, for PS2 that used the
6038920	6046280	eye toy. Um, how did they would mention the eye toy again? Huh? Uh, team 17 also did one for PS3
6046280	6052680	through the PlayStation network. Um, very similar to the PSP title. Um, but of course it doesn't
6052680	6060520	have the ability to, uh, create and share levels. And then there's lemmings touch for PS Vita. Um,
6061080	6071720	that was done, uh, by, uh, it says by, uh, D3 T limited and then a sad puppy from Sony did a mobile
6071720	6077960	friendly version of lemmings for iOS and Android in 20 teen. There were a bunch of expansions for
6077960	6084680	the original called. Oh no, more lemmings was one of them. It was Christmas lemmings. Um, of course
6084680	6096280	the Christmas lemmings. Yeah. Yeah. Um, there, uh, in fact, uh, where I'm reading everything from
6096280	6102040	has a picture of the floppy, the three, the three and a half or three and a quarter. Sorry. Um,
6103240	6114840	there, uh, I mean, they're just basically so many, many, many, many. So we'll, we'll go into some of
6114840	6122200	the, the post original. So lemmings to the tribes, uh, all new world, all new world of lemmings,
6122200	6129880	um, 3d lemmings lemmings revolution. Um, there was also lemmings paintball in 1996 and the
6129880	6137960	adventures of Lomax. There were the clones, like the humans, um, pingas was when I mentioned
6137960	6146040	earlier, there is a game called, uh, mouse craft that borrows from lemmings and Tetris.
6147000	6159960	Um, and then, uh, there we go. So we've also had, uh, I mean, just lots of people reference it. I
6159960	6168920	mean, in, uh, uh, the first Warcraft game, they, uh, were inspired in part by the lemmings versus
6169000	6176200	mode, um, including also with, uh, the lost Vikings. Um, and then, uh, Terry Pratchett,
6176200	6183000	you know, um, one of the great authors, um, in his novel, interesting times, uh,
6183000	6189960	he had an army of golems that was used the way that the lemmings were used the same interface.
6190920	6198840	Um, and then he said, uh, merely because the red army can fight, dig, March and climb,
6198840	6203320	and is controlled by little icons. Can't imagine how anyone thought that not only did I wipe
6203320	6210440	lemmings from my hard disk, I override it. So I couldn't get it back. And there you go. Oh, also
6210440	6218040	the Royal mail had, uh, lemmings, uh, stamps in 2020 to pay tribute to the UK's, uh, video
6218040	6224120	game industry. And on that note lemmings. All right. There it is a true classic, uh,
6224120	6230680	one notable on stamps overseas, uh, lemmings. I, you know, I gotta admit, like I, I knew this
6230680	6236280	series, um, you know, it kind of faded away. I didn't realize how recent they were still making
6236280	6240200	these games. When you brought up like the Vita, I was like, I don't remember that having a Vita
6240200	6245560	game, but, um, I do remember this game was absolutely huge when it first came out. I
6245640	6250200	remember playing it. I remember downloading that Christmas lemmings. Uh, I think there was a,
6250200	6254520	a multi-stage demo or something that was on a BBS. And I remember, cause I don't think it
6254520	6258600	was the whole game, but I remember downloading like a Christmas lemmings thing from a gamer,
6258600	6263080	like I think had it, uh, maybe, I don't know, but like, you know, something like that. Yeah.
6263080	6270200	This game was, it was called holiday lemmings. Oh, maybe. Oh yeah. Well that would make sense too.
6270200	6273960	But, um, yeah. So it's just, it's just one of those things. It's like, yeah, it was a really
6273960	6278600	Epic part of like nineties gaming history, especially on a computer, even though they
6278600	6283320	put it out on every console out there as you kind of got into, uh, I kind of always considered it
6283320	6287160	a PC game. I think it was a super Nintendo game because it supported this. I think it was one of
6287160	6291880	the few games that supported that SNES mouse. Like you didn't need it, but I think it supported it
6291880	6297400	and it was certainly much better for having it. So, um, yeah. Orange right in chats has probably
6297400	6301480	played this on one of those shareware filled CDs back in the day. I'm positive that's where
6301480	6306040	Christmas lemmings was hiding out, man. But, um, yeah, what a throwback, what a, what a great,
6306040	6311560	great, um, game from history. Have any of y'all ever seen what an actual lemming looks like?
6312280	6315480	Oh, it's not, they're not blue with green hair. That's for sure. They're
6315480	6323640	no, they're these adorable, cute little tiny rodents. They're so freaking cute.
6324360	6329720	Like I can't get over it. So I have a very fun and embarrassing story that taught that
6330360	6338760	directly ties into what this game can't wait. Do it. So back in the early nineties,
6338760	6345080	for some reason, I was, uh, I had actually a fan site for lemmings and actually,
6345880	6349640	so I, well, it wasn't necessarily for the game. So like, here's the, here's,
6349640	6355800	here's the thing. Like I found that I could draw them kind of pretty easy. You know,
6355800	6359960	it's a pretty difficult, it's not difficult. So I was drawing a bunch of them. And so I
6359960	6365800	actually had a fan site with like my, uh, artwork that I put out there that was on like
6365800	6371000	geo cities or something like way back in the day. But yeah, the lemmings continent was,
6371000	6375880	I think you can probably still find it actually on the way back machine and stuff like that.
6375880	6382280	But yeah, that was a long time ago. I did that and actually embarrassingly enough. Um,
6382280	6389080	there was an, like a film festival or something like that, that Sega had went through. And I
6389080	6394680	remember talking to them or like somebody that worked for Sega about like pitching a game idea
6394680	6399960	or something like a sequel to all that stuff, even though they have no rights to it at all.
6399960	6402200	And I don't know why I thought that would work out, but like,
6403960	6408120	I don't know, I was obsessed for awhile, but I have artwork that at the time I thought was
6408120	6413240	pretty good. It's all right. I still have it saved, you know, um, uh, printed out. I don't
6413240	6418840	know if I have the files anymore, but, um, yeah, that was kind of like my early high school was
6418840	6424600	that kind of stuff. I love that. I had a websites in college dedicated to female musicians. There
6424600	6430520	was like four different ones and one of them was on MTV and yeah, let's try and find it. I know
6430520	6436680	that I think it's out there actually, because it was called the lemmings continent. So that's what
6436680	6441720	it was called. It was not a web, it wasn't like a.com or anything like that. It was, uh, I don't
6441720	6446520	remember what the URL was, but that that's what it was called, but you can probably find it on
6446520	6452760	the way back machine. Um, I don't remember if it was like a Yahoo site or something like that,
6452760	6457160	but I know I found it at one time cause I got copies of the artwork. I think it's still out
6457160	6464920	there, but yeah, I had my own embarrassing websites too. So I had one about Julia Chang
6464920	6471800	and Tekken three. Oh, that's true. And I had one and I had one, uh, this was that, well,
6471800	6479880	that one was geo cities and then I had one through AOL. That was, um, my absolute shipping of, uh,
6479880	6486440	Ryoga and Ukyo from Ronwell. I love that. I mean, it's, yeah, the, the, the old websites
6486440	6490760	are embarrassing, but at the same time for me, it's like, well, you know, those, uh,
6490760	6494600	those musicians really impacted me during a very difficult time in my life. So I'm,
6494600	6499160	I'm not actually embarrassed by it, but it is just a little silly. You know, it's, it's silly.
6499160	6504280	I think it's a good way for me, for me. Um, yeah. Dark soccer and chat says geo shitties.
6505160	6512040	I think I, so I do. Okay. So I did find a link that someone had posted like in an old tripod
6512040	6518200	site because they had linked to it. Um, but I, so I have the old URL, so you have to go in the way
6518200	6523240	back machine, but I'll post it in chat. All right. I love that. Our old Rocky horror site,
6523240	6528280	uh, was on a geo cities, our old cast website. It's great. Yeah. It was an old geo city site,
6528280	6532520	but that, yeah, there it is. And then, um, I think on the way back machine, you can see some
6532520	6537960	of the artwork, which now is all right. I thought I did. All right. I was excited about it. All
6537960	6545720	right. Let's move on. It's very matrixy, which is really, it doesn't really early nineties. What
6546440	6553480	you, all right. Actually it wasn't the movie 99. So there'll be late nineties. Oh, it was,
6553480	6556280	I think, I don't remember, but yeah, it was, it's very much like that.
6557560	6561560	I'm most positive. The matrix came out in 99. Cause I saw it with friends in college.
6561560	6568200	I wasn't in high school. I don't remember. I have to find out now. 1999. Yep. That's what
6568200	6572040	I thought. Yeah. The original matrix was 1999. Maybe you were just ahead of your time.
6572040	6577880	Logie. I think I saw it right before, you know, right after I moved out here.
6580280	6584600	All right. Anyhow, let's move up. Orange. Right. It says, yep. It's on the way back machine and
6584600	6588600	here's the receipts. Oh, I can't wait to look at this. Oh yes. And then I got my,
6588600	6596120	yeah, there's my artwork. It's here. This background. Well, Hey, that, that was,
6596120	6603480	that was the, the, uh, yeah. Uh, orange. Right. And Chad says it even has a section for encounters
6603480	6609560	with stupid people. The original FUs of the week. Yes. I remember that now. Oh gosh. Yeah. People
6609560	6615080	found my old personal websites and no, I'm not even giving you an EMS, but found my personal
6615080	6620120	website. So like my angsty poetry and shit, I'd probably die, but is when I had data files,
6620120	6625320	like this is where I actually had a edit data and stuff like that. And, or I did at one point.
6625320	6631640	Oh, they're cute. Yeah. So that was, that was, that was fun times when that was my kind of
6631640	6637480	getting used to working. I think I was back with corral draw, like, or yeah, it's corral draw.
6637480	6641000	It was what we had in our art class. So that was kind of just stuff I was just messing around with
6641000	6645560	and everything. But yeah, I had a character named suicide, Bob, which is completely inappropriate.
6645560	6650600	He has Pikachu's face on it. Uh, but he was a stick of dynamite that would keep resurrecting
6650600	6655960	himself kind of like, uh, predating, um, Kenny from South park, but that was, that was that
6655960	6661240	character. But yeah, it was fun times. Glad you got the, got the witness of my artwork.
6662280	6665400	And now we're going to be digging through this website. All right. All night. All right. We've
6665400	6671400	always reading your first stupid person story. Oh gosh. I don't even know. There's so many.
6672040	6676520	We need to break things up and, uh, travel ag, you bring up DDR on here though. So this was
6676520	6680520	still going when you first like this. Oh, wow. I made this when I was 20. I thought it was so
6680520	6685880	much younger. You probably ended this right before OLR started. So that's kind of a fun relic. All
6685880	6690040	right. Uh, anyway, let's move on. We got to keep moving with the show, get some rapid fire news.
6690040	6695560	So Loki, if you want to change the topic, here's your chance. Yeah. So let's talk about space jam.
6696120	6703720	Uh, so the space jam is getting a video game, or at least a SQL is. So they actually had a contest,
6704360	6708920	that kind of posed the question of what do you think a space jam video game would look like? So
6708920	6713480	they'd had fans submitting artwork and stuff. And so they based on that, the developers at
6713480	6719640	digital clips decided to go ahead and create a game that kind of looks like an old arcade beat
6719640	6727800	them up. So they have that. And that'll be coming out pretty soon on a game pass ultimate and all
6727800	6733160	the other platforms looks like July 1st. So space jam, a new legacy for that. And then tie in with
6733160	6739000	the Xbox portion of that they're actually going to be doing a goon squad tune squad and some other
6739640	6745400	random I don't know what it's supposed to be controllers that you can actually purchase,
6745400	6751080	I think through the Microsoft store and Amazon for a limited time starting July 8th. But yeah,
6751080	6756440	and then it's going to be free to play or alt it's coming to game pass ultimate July 1st free
6756440	6764920	to play for everyone else July 15. So check that out. Another cool piece of tie in stuff is this
6764920	6771560	brand new Sonic the Hedgehog DLC for Minecraft, Minecraft bedrock that is. So it's actually it's
6771560	6777560	not just like skinning Minecraft to, you know, kind of Sonic kind of how they had with the
6777560	6783160	Super Mario stuff. But it actually changes the gameplay quite a bit like you're actually playing
6783160	6787240	it kind of like Sonic the Hedgehog. So that's pretty awesome. And they've got like the Green
6787240	6794520	Hill zone, chemical plants zone, lots of other hidden things you can find in there. So worth
6794520	6802200	checking out if you have Minecraft. It looks pretty, pretty expansive. You know, before we
6802200	6808040	get to dark soccer stories now my brain is going to see having seen Loki's old website. I think a
6808040	6812280	fun bonus. I'm not saying I'm not committing to this idea. But I'm just saying maybe I might be
6812760	6818600	down for this. A fun bonus stream might be dramatic readings of our old live journal posts.
6822120	6825160	You don't a lot of mine were private for a reason, Rob.
6826360	6830680	I'm not saying everybody has to participate. I'm just saying it's an it's an idea.
6832360	6836280	All right, maybe so you could you could use one of your old websites. You don't necessarily have
6836280	6840600	to use LiveJournal. You know, I don't I don't even remember what I called those websites.
6840600	6843480	Yeah. All right. All right. How about some rapid fire news?
6844360	6854200	All right. Well, speaking of Sonic, Netflix is working on a new Sonic show
6855000	6863400	that's called Sonic Prime. And the thing is that there's a leak about it of some of the concept
6863400	6869880	artwork that came from Patrick Horan's ArtStation profile. He's a visual development and environment
6869880	6877080	artist. He's worked on Rev and Roll and the Last Inspector Gadget series. And he worked freelance
6877080	6886520	for studio Wild Brain that worked with Sega and Netflix for that series. And so we have an Eggman.
6887160	6896280	We have Sonic hiding. We have him apparently doing the Fortnite dance. And we have a prehistoric Amy
6896280	6906920	Rose. And portals. Hmm. So. We'll see. All right. Looks I mean, it looks interesting.
6908040	6911880	If this is the style they go with for the art, I really, really do think it's great.
6914280	6922920	Neat. And then in other news, one of my favorite ever series is getting a version for PS4 Switch,
6922920	6929560	PC and arcade. Yay. And it is Superlative Night Dreams, Cotton Rock and Roll.
6930600	6936840	And for anyone who doesn't know what Cotton is, it starts as this cute little witch and her name
6936840	6948120	is Nata de Cotton. And she's addicted to this bad tasting candy called Willow. And so she enlists
6948120	6951880	the aid of fairies and by enlist, I mean, she basically traps them and make them work for her.
6953000	6960600	To go retrieve all the willow. That's only part of it. But anyway, success is the company behind
6960600	6965960	it. And like I said, it's going to be out for PS4, Switch, PC and arcade. The PS4 and Switch
6965960	6976600	versions will be out December 23rd in Japan for 6380 yen. PC version winter between 2021 and 2022
6976600	6985480	and arcade version between summer fall 2021. There's also going to be a 30th anniversary
6985480	6994600	special edition that will be 10,780 yen. So about a hundred and five hundred and six bucks
6995400	7002120	that has a Nata de Cotton nendroid, the Cotton Complete Works book and the Cotton Rock and Roll
7002200	7010200	original CD. So I am super happy about that. And pre-orders are already available in Japan at
7010200	7017320	7net and Yobodashi. So if you're going to import it, there you go. Also confirmed is a cotton,
7017320	7023320	silk and applique pumpkin. Yes, their names are all based on clothing and tailoring.
7026200	7030840	One other piece of rapid fire news I want to insert in here before we get to world release
7030840	7035960	dates. I want to remind everybody that the Summer Games Done Quick Marathon is coming up this week.
7035960	7039960	It actually starts on July 4th, which ironically, I should also mention to the listeners,
7040520	7044200	we will not be here next week. We're not going to have a live show next week because the holiday
7044200	7048200	here in the States, we couldn't really get our schedules to match up. And that's OK. It's a
7048200	7051880	holiday anyway. So I imagine a lot of you guys will be out doing things, especially, you know,
7051880	7056440	now that more and more places and things are opening, you're probably or at least doing maybe
7056440	7060840	a small gathering or something like that. I don't know. But yeah, so we're not gonna be here live.
7060840	7068680	But of course, the Summer Games Done Quick Marathon starts on the 4th and runs through the
7070040	7075000	10th or 11th. I can't remember the date off my head, but I do know our very own Bobby Blackwolf
7075000	7081640	is going to be participating as one of the announcers as he has been for a few of those now,
7081640	7087720	at least a year, all the virtual ones. So I know he's doing the overnights, I think on the 5th.
7088440	7091560	And then I think a lot of you guys are going to hear him when he does the big finale,
7091560	7095320	Kingdom Hearts 2. He's going to be announcing during that. Of course, it is about the speed
7095320	7100920	runners and their commentators that they have on the virtual couch. So, you know, Bobby's there to
7100920	7105480	get the donators read and all that stuff. So the real stars of the show are the speed runners,
7105480	7110600	the charities. But it's pretty cool to kind of know somebody that's very involved with that.
7110600	7117640	Absolutely. Bobby also with a big tip here. If you use hashtag VOG Network at the end of your
7117640	7123640	donation during his shift, you have a higher chance. I want to underline bold, italicize,
7123640	7129480	chance of getting it read or excuse me, of getting it to Bobby to potentially get read.
7129480	7134600	But do not mention VOG, OLR, Bobby's podcast or anything that could be seen as self-promotion,
7134680	7142040	because again, it's about the charity and about the speed runners. I even know because I donated
7142040	7147480	two cycles ago and I think I made a joke about oh, I put the donator as Mr. Smoosh.
7147480	7154280	I said that was the donator and it didn't get read. So there was that. I guess somebody thought,
7154280	7157880	you know, it could be an entendre for something. I don't know, because I guess smoosh could mean
7157880	7163480	sex or something. I don't know. Anything can mean sex. Right. And then but last time I used
7163480	7168440	the hashtag and I just put a very generic like, you know, go, you know, actually, no,
7168440	7171640	it wasn't generic because I think I actually referenced something that was going on in the
7171640	7175720	speed run. I think I did it during the acoustic speed run and just tried to keep a positive and
7175720	7180280	it made it to Bobby and got read. So that was cool. The football baby. Yeah. Yeah. The rugby
7180280	7184680	baby rugby baby. Yeah. That whole thing. That was hilarious, by the way. Yeah. Bobby says don't use
7184680	7189160	anything that might be an inside joke. That was the mistake I made. Although I don't think Mr.
7189160	7195480	Smoosh is a joke. Mr. Smoosh is a real person. But I get it. I get it. Why that wasn't picked.
7195480	7199800	And also there was no no hashtag thing back then. So I probably didn't even make it to Bobby's desk.
7199800	7203320	So anyway, there you go. A little tip for you guys if you're going to be donating. But again,
7203320	7208280	I was stressed. Bobby is under no obligation to read them and they are under no obligation to send
7208280	7211400	them to him. If you're going to donate money, you're doing it because you appreciate the
7211400	7215160	charity. I think that's that's what it's really all about. So I just want to underline bold
7215160	7222840	italicize that disclaimer. OK, so there we go. No show next week. Summer games done quick.
7223960	7226920	Try to think of any other housekeeping I forgot at the top of the show. I don't think so.
7226920	7230760	So let's move on to world release dates. We'll start in the US. Loki.
7231560	7238360	So we've got Destroy All Humans coming out for Nintendo Switch. Disgaea 6, Defiance of Destiny,
7238360	7245000	also for Nintendo Switch. Ghoul Patrol on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7245000	7250200	Also with that, Zombies Ate My Neighbors on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7250760	7259160	We've got Sky Children of the Light on Nintendo Switch. Wonder Boy, Asha in Monster World on PC.
7259800	7265480	And last but not least, Doki Doki Literature Club Plus on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4,
7265480	7272040	PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X. I cannot believe we're in the year 2021 and we
7272040	7276920	just had Zombies Ate My Neighbors red as a new release this week. That's so exciting.
7276920	7281560	All right. Going to Japan on the Nintendo Switch, we have Summer Pockets, Reflection
7281560	7289160	Blue is out this week, as well as Moshi Kashite Obaki no Shattika for Nintendo Switch
7289800	7293240	is also coming out this week. Those, of course, are Nintendo Switch releases.
7293800	7299080	On the PlayStation 5, I don't think we have anything coming out besides maybe a peripheral,
7299080	7304280	an official wireless charger, if you want that. Cool. Otherwise, on the PlayStation 4,
7305160	7310040	also nothing. It's a pretty slow week in Japan this week. Those Nintendo Switch releases are
7310040	7314760	all you get. How about the UK Dark Soccer? Okay. I'm going to have to, because the way
7314760	7318280	the site is done, I'm going to have to just break it up and read it a little bit differently. But
7319560	7324600	on the 29th, we have Destroy All Humans for Switch. We get Curbed Space,
7325320	7332920	uh, Evil Inside on the 30th, Greed Fall Gold Edition, ATV Drift and Tricks, and Distrust,
7332920	7339000	looks like a big old box set of it. And then on the first, which is Winds a Day, actually nothing
7339000	7345480	on the first. On the second, we have Red Wings Aces of the Sky, Mask Maker for PlayStation,
7345480	7351400	Evergate. We have Nightmare Boy, Do Not Feed the Monkeys, Beholder Complete Edition,
7351400	7358840	Collector's Edition. Goodness. And then that's it for this week. I could also point out the
7358840	7363400	week after. Sure. Oh yeah. We weren't going to be here next week anyway, so sure. Yes. So we have
7363400	7368840	In Nightmare, Dark Alliance, Oddworld Soulstorm, those are all on the sixth. On the eighth,
7368840	7373240	we have Farmers vs Zombies. We have Monster Hunter Stories 2, Wings of Ruin on the ninth,
7373240	7377160	Dungeons of Nihilebek, I guess, the Amulet of Chaos,
7379800	7384600	Vampire the Masquerade, the Coteries of New York, and Shadows of New York.
7385720	7389240	I, uh, and then some Harvest Moon and some other stuff.
7390520	7395800	All right. All right. Let's get through some more stories and then we'll get to your comments from
7395800	7399960	the listeners in our, uh, some of the stories you've placed in our Discord throughout the week,
7400200	7403400	as well as our mailbag. Participate at orangeonshooter.com and of course,
7403400	7408200	live comments from chats. Uh, but for now, let's get to a few more stories starting with Loki.
7409400	7415800	Yeah. So there was this lawsuit and this sounds awfully familiar to me, but, uh, Booker T,
7416680	7418840	who, uh, his... The wrestler?
7418840	7425560	Yes, the wrestler. So Booker T Huffman, who had a wrestler or a character that he did
7425560	7431400	back in his early wrestling days called GI Bro. Uh, apparently he was saying that that character
7431400	7440680	was kind of stolen by Activision to use in Call of Duty Black Ops 4. So they have a character named
7440680	7449160	Prophet, which kind of looks similar. Um, so unfortunately though, the, uh, jury didn't see
7449160	7456120	it that way. They figured that it isn't an exact license or likeness, but I re they remember,
7456120	7462840	like, not even that long ago, we talked about another issue where the characters like this
7462840	7467560	was taken for Call of Duty game as well. And they had actually shot somebody, you know,
7468600	7475720	with similar, basically the same actress with the same get, you know, outfit and everything
7475720	7480120	also for Call of Duty likeness. So it's like kind of seeing a trend here a little bit,
7480120	7484040	the kind of just skirt and, you know, let's make it look just like the character,
7484040	7489080	but just enough so we don't get sued. Dude, the faces though, uncannily
7491640	7497640	similar. Yeah, it is. And, but once again, I think it's just one of those, like, we're
7497640	7501080	going to use the likeness without, you know, just making it different enough.
7501080	7506680	Plaintiff does not own the idea of an angry man with a scowling look. I'm sorry. That made me
7506680	7514600	laugh. Yeah. So they probably just didn't have a strong enough case, but it does seem to be like
7514600	7519400	a trend that, you know, the stuff that they're getting away with. I, I feel that they're getting
7519400	7526840	away with, but we'll see. I don't know. I'm sure this is not the last of these types of
7526840	7531960	cases we're going to hear in a courtroom. So, I mean, go back to the top of the show.
7531960	7537000	We're talking about, you know, completely, uh, going to the extent of lifting somebody's voice.
7537000	7543560	I mean, you know, anyway. All right. Um, well, moving on, let's talk about, um, this is pretty
7543560	7548040	big news for the Blizzard crowd this week. If you're a fan of Blizzard games, um, you probably
7548040	7553880	are very excited to hear that Overwatch is now cross-play. I mean, a great idea to pump some
7553880	7557880	life into a game that's, uh, I don't want to say is dying, but a game that's probably showing its
7557880	7562040	age. It's been around for a few years. Hasn't really had any big updates in a while because
7562040	7566120	obviously they're working on Overwatch 2. That is the big update that's going to be coming later.
7566120	7571480	Um, but this is a pretty big deal to, uh, get more people excited about Overwatch and revisiting
7571480	7575960	and shorten the time to find a match. I'm sure because Overwatch is now cross-play
7575960	7581000	between PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch, which means for the first time,
7581720	7586760	console players can see chat. And I bet a lot of them are very sad about that and wish they could
7586760	7591080	turn this feature off. I think actually you probably can. Uh, because if you want it,
7591080	7595800	yeah, if you want to enable cross-play, you do have to make a battle net account, which, um,
7595800	7600120	I'm sure many people already have. If you are a PC gamer at all, and you've ever played something
7600120	7604920	like Diablo, World of Warcraft, Starcraft. Your console gamer that had the play doom,
7604920	7608920	you know, I think you had to do that as well. You're thinking of a Bethesda account, but
7609480	7616120	sorry. Yeah. Similar, similar train of thought, but yes, different. Um, so do you have to have
7616120	7619320	a battle net account for call of duty? So there's probably a lot of people have that.
7619320	7625800	Um, I don't know about consoles. Um, it's, it's the official shop on PC, but I don't know about
7625800	7631240	consoles. So, but anyhow, battle net is where you do need to make an account if you don't already
7631240	7636920	have one. Um, and then, uh, PC and console players will be able to join matches together for
7636920	7642600	quick play arcade and custom. However, competitive will still not match. And I'm assuming that's a
7642600	7648360	keyboard mouse versus controller thing. Um, but anyhow, uh, what they say about the match
7648360	7652440	making process for competitive games, competitive players will be split into two pools, depending
7652440	7657400	on the system, console players and PC players for balanced purposes, PC players and console players
7657400	7661400	will not be mixed in the same pool for competitive matches. And I'm pretty sure they're just not
7661400	7669480	saying the reason why, but I think, I think I got just explained it. So, uh, anyhow, uh, it does not
7669480	7674840	unlock shared progression among consoles. So your cosmetic and your stats are still locked to
7674840	7681000	whatever platform they will not transfer. Um, also there was a patch that increases the amount of
7681000	7686280	damage that some heroes deal on console to try to, uh, bring a little parody with the PC version.
7686280	7691720	That's very interesting. So, uh, yeah. Anyway, it's been five years since Overwatch first came
7691720	7695960	out, just as a reminder. So five years later, we finally get cross play. I guess I should check
7695960	7701000	that out at some point, to be honest. Um, Mike Deft in chat says, that's the only thing I'm really
7701000	7706920	mad about. No cross progression seems dumb. I do agree. It's right there, but the queue times now
7706920	7711960	are instant. Yeah. Oh yeah. I'm sure it opened it up a lot more for sure. For sure. It's also
7711960	7717480	irritating to me that, you know, dead by daylight has the cross play, but not the cross progression
7717480	7723240	unless you're talking, I think stadia and PC is it, you know, it's a very limited set of everything
7723240	7730520	that it supports. Technically it's specifically stadia and steam. Oh, thank you. Yes. The other,
7730520	7735160	the other services don't do it like a windows store. Yes. Thank you for calling that out
7735160	7738920	because you're absolutely right. Cause I think it's ridiculous that windows game stories and
7738920	7745480	cross platform with steam, what the hell cross progression anyway. Yeah. I, I, if we pay for
7745480	7750520	this stuff, it should be able to go between the consoles. It really should. I mean, I somewhat
7750520	7757320	understand Freddy and, uh, the shape and some of the licensed killers and maybe survivors,
7757320	7762360	but the original ones, nah, that should, that should all be cross progression. But anyway,
7763000	7771240	that's another argument. Uh, moving on dark Sakura. So, um, we, we like to point out when
7771240	7777560	really old shit goes for a lot of money, right? Well, a game called air raid that was out on the,
7777560	7790520	uh, Atari 2,600 sold for over $10,000. Um, it, uh, basically, uh, an e-commerce item processor
7790520	7795720	who is at a four, uh, named Alex Juarez, who is at, uh, Fort worth, Texas based, uh,
7795720	7803080	Goodwill center found a copy of air raid. Um, that was published for the Atari 2,600 in 1982 by men
7803080	7811400	a vision. Um, it was very limited. Only 13 copies are known to exist. And so, uh, he,
7812520	7818520	he would just go into the Atari games as they came in and he took it. Well, I mean, I guess he,
7819080	7824520	I mean, I don't know if he took it, maybe he bought it from them, but yeah, something like
7824520	7833320	that. Um, a complete edition previously sold for $33,433 and 30 cents in 2012. And another
7833320	7842360	cartridge only sold on eBay for 3,575. So this is now Goodwill's highest selling piece item.
7843160	7849160	Oh, I guess the Goodwill sold it. So I hate that they got the money. They do some shitty
7849160	7856680	things to their employees, but bonds, double a six and chat says, shit air raid. I recall playing
7856680	7863400	that game. Well, hold on because there were some very similar sounding games, uh, river raid being
7863400	7869560	one of them. And Atari had an original called air C battle that my brain thought this game was at
7869560	7875720	first, but air raid was a very specific, it was a blue cartridge that was very funky kind of shape
7875720	7880600	to it. And that's what made it so unique. Um, and I, you just said there were like a limited
7880600	7885880	number of these, right? So, um, you may, you may, if you have played one, that's very impressive,
7885880	7891080	but, um, you may be confusing it with another Atari 2,600 classic. That's very similar sounding.
7891080	7897320	So, all right. Uh, yeah. Uh, no one special says, uh, the game was sky blue and had a handle,
7897320	7902920	right? Yep. Yep. Yep. So, uh, dark to see it says, yeah, that's the only downside is the Goodwill.
7902920	7907880	Um, I thought it was neat to see something super rare, just randomly pop up like that. Hell yeah.
7907880	7911880	Like, you know, if I happen to walk by a garage sale, I'm always going to kind of peak and see
7911880	7915720	if there's any video games, you know, not that I'm like intentionally looking to flip them,
7915720	7918840	but I'm just looking for like, Ooh, is there something fun in here that I just want to buy
7918840	7922920	that? Oh, maybe, you know, some I can get, I want it so no one else can have it.
7922920	7929640	This is mine. Uh, moving on Logie.
7931000	7938680	So this is one of those unfortunate updates that, um, we see from time to time with different games
7938680	7946200	that come out. So apparently Marvel's Avengers had received an update where for a brief period of
7946200	7952280	time, it was not only displaying your username in game, but it was also displaying a string
7952280	7960200	afterwards, which included your IP address. And so that's obviously a problem if, you know,
7960200	7966520	users are having their IP address exposed to other players. Um, so thankfully, though, they did,
7966520	7972520	they were able to patch this to fix the problem, but it's still kind of embarrassing that it was a
7972520	7980440	problem in the first place. Yeah, that's a pretty major thing. And I can't believe they had to
7980440	7984840	actually send a thing to like tell streamers, don't play this because, uh, you're not going
7984840	7990920	to like the side effects of it. Basically. It's kind of sad. Yeah. Yeah. Very unfortunate. Yeah.
7990920	7995240	They did. And Dr. C says, I did hear that it was finally fixed a few days after it was discovered.
7995240	7999400	Yes. But that's still a few days that you have a very unfortunate side effect there in the game.
7999400	8003160	Very, very, yeah. Especially if you didn't notice it, if you weren't paying attention to,
8003160	8008360	you know, the text on there. I mean, it's just, that could be bad. All right. Well,
8008360	8013000	lastly, hopefully there will be no, um, side effects, uh, for folks doing this. This is,
8013000	8018840	uh, PAX West has declared they will be in person this year. Um, so PAX West, of course,
8018840	8022360	you all know this gaming convention, it's going to be happening in person in September,
8022360	8026520	and that was announced via press release. Um, and then, uh, tickets will be going on sale,
8026520	8032680	$230 for the whole four day weekend, $60 for individual day passes. Um, now of course they
8032680	8036920	are saying that there will be different, um, you know, it's going to be a little bit different,
8036920	8043240	uh, that there'd be doing attendance limitation. And I believe I read something about masking as
8043240	8053160	well. Um, Oh yes. Uh, they did say the packs organizers did say in a tweet, uh, if COVID-19
8053160	8057720	remains a major barrier to safely gathering at one of our shows, we won't do it, or we will take it
8057720	8062280	virtual as much as we miss even crave the togetherness and magic of packs. We will not put
8062280	8066680	attendees exhibitors or our guests at risk for the sake of an event. If things aren't on the up and
8067160	8072680	up, um, as I think we got into last year in 2020, a lot of these companies are contractually
8072680	8078440	obliged to do something, um, or they could lose everything for good. So, um, I, this comes as no
8078440	8084520	surprise to me that packs is happening, um, dragon cons the same weekend. And as to, as of today,
8084520	8090280	uh, the plan is I'm going to dragon con. Um, but, uh, you know, again, I'm going to watch
8090280	8095560	everything and watch science most importantly. And if, uh, CDC comes out and says, don't do it,
8095560	8100520	then we won't do it. But for now we'll see. I'm I gotta say I was out and about in San Francisco
8100520	8108680	yesterday. And, uh, I, I was kind of surprised at how busy everything was. I had the Castro was
8108680	8114120	still full on in pride mode, even though there wasn't an official pride. So it was very
8114120	8121720	interesting. Yeah. So, um, but I'm vaccinated and, uh, that crowd pretty sure they're vaccinated too.
8121720	8126280	Um, sure. There's still a breakthrough risk. Um, but you know, you're taking a lot of risks
8126280	8132680	whenever you get out of bed. Um, and, uh, we know that vaccines work and vaccines will certainly,
8132680	8138120	um, unless you are, uh, older in your eighties, I think the average age is 83.
8138120	8144440	Uh, the vaccines will certainly prevent severe like death basically. So, um, yeah. So, I mean,
8145080	8149880	again, as it stands today, I don't see a problem with dragon con, but, um, I don't think it's
8149880	8155720	going to be the exact same as previous years. I think I will still choose to wear a mask. Um,
8155720	8161160	and I hope nobody gives me shit for that because that's my choice. Um, especially when, when in
8161160	8165880	transit, basically when I'm walking from my hotel room to the panel room, I will wear a mask when
8165880	8170200	I'm in the panel room on stage. I probably won't because there's kind of a built-in social
8170200	8178600	distancing when you're sitting on a panel. So, uh, yeah. So, um, yeah. So anyway, lots of people,
8178600	8182280	uh, talking about this PAX West, I sort of feel like it's just going to work out. Like there's
8182280	8187480	enough people who are kind of like apprehensive about it that aren't going to go, but PAX wants
8187480	8191480	to lower the numbers anyway. So I kind of feel like that's going to balance out. I just think
8191480	8197400	the two crowds need to play nice. Like if people, if people don't want to go, then the people that
8197400	8201880	are going shouldn't like say, oh, why aren't you going? Did it? No, that's somebody's choice to
8201880	8206840	make at the same time. If somebody doesn't go, I don't think they need to be holier than thou
8206840	8213480	to the people that are going to go. Um, because again, vaccines exist and that's why we took them.
8213480	8220600	So we'll see. Um, going into our chat over twitch.tv slash a vog network, uh, pod culture
8220600	8226040	says my 99, almost 100 year old grandma is vaccinated. Good, good. And that I hope she,
8226040	8229960	she should have been one of the first ones to get it. I know my dad got vaccinated all the way back
8229960	8235960	in early February, but he's in his eighties. Um, so he was in that early group. Yeah. All right,
8235960	8241080	let's get to the listener round table. We are going to, uh, talk to you guys through various
8241080	8245560	methods that you can use to participate with our show. Um, I'll log into discord here in a minute
8245560	8250920	at vog network.com slash discord. But first I think we'll go to dark Sakura with our mail bag
8250920	8258520	participate at orange lounge, radio.com. So we have two emails. One of them I will just start
8258520	8267320	off with hello peoples. Um, there is a, uh, link, uh, from variety about drag race. According to
8267320	8272440	variety, one of the great camp classics of 1970s television is getting a drag makeover.
8272440	8277000	Apparently several alumni of RuPaul's drag race will recreate an episode of the Brady bunch for
8277000	8282520	paramount plus which category does this event fall under a, a reason to take advantage of the
8282520	8287640	free child paramount plus B a reason to reactivate your subscription to paramount plus, which you
8287640	8292200	deactivated because you ran out of episodes of star Trek discovery to watch C a reason to
8292200	8297640	subscribe to paramount plus using a credit card number you got from the dark net D a reason to
8297640	8302920	spend the premiere weekend getting drunk off whiskey from high west. I'm not going to
8302920	8307480	advertise the distillery final state high west distillery. I don't know who they are. I know
8307480	8314680	which one I'm choosing. Stay care entertainment. Uh, I, I, please don't let us do free advertisement.
8315320	8319720	Yeah, I just, even though we totally do it, I know I was just to say, but you just advertise
8319720	8324600	the Brady bunch special and paramount plus, so you might as well throw in the whiskey thing too.
8324600	8333560	I'm going to use somebody else's subscription. Um, yeah, I have sure I have paramount plus and,
8333560	8338520	um, it's, it's fine. I think, I don't think irritation that people have with paramount
8338520	8343560	plus is specific, specifically about paramount plus, but people have an irritation that there
8343560	8349000	are all these different streaming services when Netflix was supposed to be the catch all be all.
8349000	8354440	Right. But at the same time, I think if we want there to be competition and we want to make sure
8354440	8357400	that, you know, they're all trying to one up each other, there's going to have to be several of
8357400	8362040	these. I just think now people are starting to feel like there's too many and I get that,
8362040	8366760	believe me, I get that, but there's certainly, I canceled Disney plus I wasn't using it enough.
8367080	8369080	I can't pay for the year. Um,
8370920	8373880	we'll see, but that's, and then, then I start, I start trading them.
8373880	8377160	So like I'll borrow somebody's Disney plus and give them my paramount plus,
8377160	8380520	but I've had paramount plus ever since it was CBS all access for the star Trek thing
8380520	8385880	that was referred to in the email. Um, so yeah, I mean, I'm using it to watch all stars,
8385880	8389400	but that wasn't like the reason I got it. I got it for star Trek and there's a
8389400	8393960	decent amount of stuff on there. I feel like as far as, um, those services go,
8393960	8399160	I feel like paramount plus probably is one of the stronger ones. Um, but it depends on what
8399160	8403880	you like. I don't have HBO max, but I know a lot of people are super into it. I could give a shit
8403880	8410440	about friends. Um, but there's other stuff on there too. I guess people like, so anyway. Um,
8410440	8414600	yes, I will. I, since I already have paramount plus I've been subbed for years services with CBS
8414600	8420280	all access ever since I think I first subbed to CBS all access for the big brother live feeds.
8420280	8424440	And since it's only like $5 a month, but that seat, that show has really gone to shit the past
8424440	8429480	two or three years, especially just the castings horrific. Um, so, uh, I don't really watch live
8429480	8433880	feeds anymore, but I watched the star Trek and the other stuff. So yeah, I'll watch this Brady
8433880	8437880	bunch special. I didn't even realize it was a thing until today when somebody showed me a picture or
8437880	8442120	it was actually Alan that showed me a picture of candy muse dressed as, uh, I think it was Jan,
8442920	8447320	no, which Cindy was Cindy Brady. And I just kind of laughed. I thought it was funny.
8447320	8451800	So, cause somebody, uh, photoshopped the gun meme onto that. So it looked like candy muse
8451800	8458120	as Cindy Brady holding a gun. That's funny. That's funny. All right. Anyway, um, I'll have to find
8458120	8465400	the picture and share it with you. All right. Uh, we have more emails, right? Um, yeah. Did I
8465400	8470920	actually click? No, I didn't. Good. Um, hi, you're a fly on the wall for one boardroom meeting in
8470920	8478680	gaming history. Which one do you pick? And this comes from D you're a fly on the wall in a board
8478680	8487240	room in gaming's history. Trying to find that picture for dark soccer. Sorry. Um, I know I
8487240	8493960	would want to be in the boardroom when they decided on the name, we, you and why I want to know what
8493960	8498760	the hell they were thinking. I want to know what drugs were on the table that they were all, uh,
8498760	8504200	taken. I'm just, I'm half kidding, but I, uh, since, since I'm announcing which Hills I'm
8504200	8510280	going to die on tonight, here's another one. Um, the Wii U was tanked by its name period.
8510280	8515880	That is the worst name console I think we've ever had. I may, I may regret that comment later,
8515880	8520040	but it's one of the worst game name consoles we've ever had. Um, and I want to know what the
8520040	8523960	hell they were thinking with that name, especially when it looked and it felt nothing like their
8524040	8529960	original Wii. I just, I don't get it. So I want to know, I want to know what the alternative names
8529960	8536360	were that they didn't go through with. And I want to know who was fighting for those names and why.
8537400	8543320	Well, I know what I would want. What's that? The meeting where they decided to go with Jerry
8543320	8549480	Lawson's, uh, game designs for the fair child channel F because it's because of him. We have
8549480	8555560	cartridges going way back in history. I like that. I am. Yeah. And then I also know why the
8555560	8560920	fuck they did that controller design. Cause it was shit. Um, and yeah, if we're going to talk,
8560920	8565960	go way back, then I definitely want to be in some boardrooms, uh, in the old Atari days,
8565960	8570200	because there probably were drugs on the table. And I'm very curious about what all was going
8570200	8574600	on then. Cause I don't know if y'all know, but a lot of your favorite eighties games were absolutely
8574600	8579560	drug and drug influenced. Absolutely. So it's, uh, I think that'd be interesting. Not that I
8579560	8584840	condone, not that I condone it, but I just think we should face that reality. I just want to be in
8584840	8590040	the boardrooms and they complained about Steve jobs. I would, I'll take the board. I'll take
8590040	8597640	the boardroom, um, the directly after the E3 that Konami unveiled the Brock revolution and all the
8597640	8603400	fallout from all that. I want to be in that boardroom to see the folks getting yelled out
8603400	8609640	about just that. And about like 99 nights and how they displayed that. And just, just like
8610440	8617080	the, what the, what the heck? Or, uh, when they decided not to do a sweet code and game so I
8617080	8625320	can jump out of the wall and go, you idiots, you absolute fucking idiots. Oh, well, or in the,
8625320	8631800	the boardroom, when the folks that did, uh, scabins, uh, Chateau Reneau, we were talking
8631800	8636840	about these weird Americans who are talking about their game. That is a great answer. That is,
8636840	8640520	I want to definitely, I don't know if that wouldn't necessarily do a boardroom, but it was
8640520	8645800	definitely in a conference room with the marketing team. That is a great answer. I'm, I, I, carbon
8645800	8652120	copy on that answer. That's, I want to know the reaction to when president cat happened
8652120	8657240	and that company. That's great. I got orange rounds radio.
8660840	8666680	Like who is, who's that? Who is that? Uh, great question. That was a really good question.
8666680	8671400	All right. Yeah. Props to you. I don't know if I can give you a gold star cause the email
8671400	8676440	was kind of short, but you definitely get a silver star. Is it the silver star story?
8677000	8685000	Sure. Is it lunar? Sure. Girl. Okay. All right. That's it for emails this week, right?
8685720	8691720	Yeah, it is. All right. Um, there was a good question in chat, twitch.tv slash vog network,
8691720	8697640	no one special 77, which by the way, no one special. Can you please email the show
8697640	8703560	or email me personally? Rob at vog network.com. Um, I received a really heartfelt reply to your
8703560	8707560	question last week in my Twitter DMS. And I want to forward that to you. That just occurred in my
8707560	8712280	mind that I needed to send that to you, um, uh, from somebody who's dealing with something similar.
8712280	8717160	So I wanted to send, send that to you. No one special. Anyway, for now, let me read the question,
8717160	8723960	uh, from this week. No one special asks, you know, how in the early two thousands video games,
8723960	8731000	OST internet radio stations were all the rage. Yes. No one special. We're a little bit aware.
8731640	8736840	I'm, I'm laughing with you, not at you because, uh, appropriately on our 19th anniversary,
8736840	8739960	if you think about it, the roots of orange lounge radio, if you didn't already know,
8739960	8746680	we were a live 365 station and the highlight of the station was the Sunday night life. Well,
8746680	8751080	you know, I thought it was the highlight was the Sunday night show. And there were other shows
8751080	8757160	throughout the run on life 365. We had, um, uh, remember DMN who has a different name. Now he
8757160	8763400	was DMN back in the day. Uh, and then DJ tyrant was on our network. Uh, stay tight. He was here
8763400	8769000	and they had a show. Um, and then, uh, there was, I had like two or three spinoff shows at one point
8769000	8773880	on the network. But anyway, yes, we played gaming soundtracks. I sent you the picture, right? All
8773880	8779480	right. Isn't it great? I'm saving that forever. It's going to be a reaction for me. All right.
8779480	8784760	You can thank Alan for that one. Alan, that was the Cindy Brady candy muse gun meme.
8785640	8791640	That's the best thing to ever happen. Right. Anyway. Um, sorry, let me get to no one specials
8791640	8795080	actual question here. So, you know, how in the early 2000s video games, OST internet radio
8795080	8801480	stations were all the rage in this day and age. Can we see a resurgence of those or have they
8801480	8808680	gone the way of the dodo due to DMCA? Um, I don't think they've gone the way of the dodo. I don't
8808680	8814680	think they're extinct, but I think the demand for those has gone down a bit because, and I, you
8814680	8818840	know, I feel like I can speak with some of, somewhat of an authority to this. When we were
8818840	8822840	doing orange on radio on life through 65, everything was legal because we paid a fee to
8822840	8828440	live through 65 to broadcast on there. And they in turn paid the rate, the, the, the music labels.
8828440	8833880	My understanding is life through 65 and services like that are still around. And absolutely there's
8834760	8839240	still there. I actually had to go to their website so that I could remember if that's exactly what
8839240	8844360	the website was when I did our, I did our Guinness thing. And actually, I'm sorry, I, the, the correct
8844360	8849480	terminology, we shouldn't say it's still there. We should say it died and was resurrected by
8849480	8854760	somebody else. That's kind of what happened. It's a reincarnation, your reincarnation. Um, so that
8854760	8859000	it's, it went the MySpace way. It's not really well, but I think they are still like live radio
8859000	8862600	and all that stuff. Uh, and then of course, shout cast is still out there. Shout cast was the
8862600	8867960	technology that carried this show. Um, for the first 17 years, we didn't make the move to Twitch
8867960	8874040	until the beginning of 2019, January, 2019, maybe December actually. Um, but anyhow, um,
8876040	8881320	um, my point is, is that, uh, shout cast still exists and you can find that on shout cast.
8881320	8888040	The legal question ability of that stuff is a little bit in doubt. Um, but there are services
8888040	8893960	like life 365 that will pay other, you know, folks to do that, uh, and the music rates,
8893960	8901000	but also, um, and my real answer, sorry, blah, blah, blah. But, um, the big factor that didn't
8901000	8908440	exist in 2002 and 2003, when we were first doing this, that exists now is streaming. It's Spotify,
8908440	8914840	it's Apple music, it's Pandora. It's not just streaming, but it's the fact that these Japanese
8914840	8921080	gaming companies, uh, and American ones too, have now embraced, most of them have embraced
8921080	8927080	the streaming technology. So you can go on and find official final fantasy soundtracks
8927080	8932200	on Spotify. You can find official soundtracks to lots of Namco games. I know we're up there.
8932200	8938200	Capcom games are up there and so on and so on. So a lot of people are getting it on demand,
8938200	8942760	maybe not so much DDR. I think probably because you have a lot of license issues in play there,
8943000	8947160	because you have very, very old license that are expired. So they're not on streaming services,
8947160	8951960	but I think those games we have to admit are pretty niche when we talk about video game
8951960	8958120	soundtracks altogether. Um, so that I think streaming has really cut into that is really
8958120	8965240	my long roundabout way of your answer. Um, but no one special wherever there is an internet,
8965240	8969320	there will always be someone doing something you're thinking about right now on it.
8969320	8977000	If you know what I mean. Um, let's see. Tiger con chat says mix cloud started a streaming
8977000	8981400	service for DJs to broadcast their live sets to avoid any of the copyright issues. That's smart.
8981400	8985960	That's very smart. And I was also going to say no one special. I think a lot of the audience for
8985960	8993640	that went to Twitch slash YouTube slash I guess Facebook gaming, uh, slash, you know, those types
8993640	8998760	of, uh, video, video on demand services. Um, I think a lot of the audience went there and
8998760	9003400	that's a big reason why we're on Twitch. To be honest, uh, quest buster does point out. There's
9003400	9009720	a few on YouTube that stream video game tracks and I, YouTube will have the legal and the
9009720	9015240	questionably legal stuff on there. So I, I YouTube is a great call out. Um, other ones I found were
9015240	9019800	bundled under other services, but there's also outfits like radio Sega that does radio type
9019800	9025080	shows. And I've been broadcasting classic Sega music for years. Um, our friends, uh,
9025080	9029800	with girls gone. Wow. That used to be here at the voice of geeks network. They left the network
9029800	9034680	because they went to Warcraft radio, which broadcast 24 seven about Warcraft radio. And I
9034680	9039720	get it. They're a Warcraft show. Why wouldn't they want to be on a Warcraft network? So they went
9039720	9043640	over there and, uh, I, I know they do a lot of talk programming, but I'm pretty sure they've
9043640	9048600	got to play some music from the games in between all that stuff. So, um, you know, there's that
9048600	9053560	that exists as well for sure. So, all right. It's weird as I actually see a lot of folks,
9053560	9059400	um, big streamers out there, they're using Nintendo music, like animal crossing and stuff
9059400	9066200	like that in their streams, which I think is just completely bold to do considering how litigious
9066200	9070840	Nintendo is. Do you know how many memes I've seen with the Wii shop music though?
9072280	9077640	Like there's a great drag race clip out there of Brooklyn Heights in untucked when she's like
9077640	9083160	cringing and all this, and it's set to the Wii shop music. And it's so funny. You've seen that
9083160	9088120	dark Sakura. I've heard of it. I haven't seen it. Oh, I got to find it. It's great. All right.
9088120	9093880	Anyway, uh, enough, uh, enough of the, uh, um, chat question there, but that was a very good
9093880	9097640	question. Thank you. No one special. Uh, and you, I'm going to also give you a silver star
9097640	9102200	because that was a question that had nothing to do with the stores or sales or anything like that.
9102200	9107240	And that was another very good question. So a silver star for you. All right. Maybe you can
9107240	9112120	combine your star with our emailer and then you'll have one gold star. Maybe that's a currency.
9112120	9120520	We need to start here at OLR. All right. Uh, I would love to have our own Bitcoin. Are you
9120520	9124920	kidding? Even though I think some of it's really silly. I think it's just like a parody. It'd be
9124920	9129560	fun. All right. Uh, in, in, on a serious note, uh, Loki, any last minute stories? I'm pulling
9129560	9136440	up our discord here and yeah, we've got lots of depressing news. Let's go into it. So, so start
9136440	9146600	starting off, uh, we had a developer of, um, the emulator, uh, or the SNES emulator, um,
9146600	9154840	B SNES and high again near he has taken his life. So, um, I actually saw this in cause I have
9154840	9160680	followed the, the nest of community and stuff. So I actually saw this in our discord and, uh,
9160680	9165960	I didn't really know who he was, but I knew he was a developer. I just didn't know on an emulator,
9166040	9172760	but apparently this is from a long, basically lots of online harassment that he's been receiving
9172760	9179560	cyber bullying. Um, I guess a lot of it coming from this hub called Kiwi farms, but yeah,
9179560	9187720	apparently it's just added up over time. And he kind of put out this long thread on Twitter,
9187720	9194120	you know, basically saying goodbye. So that was kind of a red flag right there. And then
9194600	9198120	I need to make sure I need to make sure this isn't sugar coated because it's
9198120	9201320	fucking pride month and we're not going to do that. And looky, I'm not blaming you. I'm
9201320	9206520	saying this story. We need to call this out is my understanding is that near or a view,
9206520	9212840	I think was another name that was used previously. It was non-binary. Um, although I think they were,
9212840	9218120	well, I think I'm not sure the pronouns were ever clarified, but to be fair, uh, they, they,
9218120	9225480	they identified as non-binary. Um, how, however, what's gross about it is that this website that
9225480	9230680	you had mentioned, uh, what was the name of that site again? Kiwi farms was targeting this
9230680	9235720	individual because they were non-binary and that's the gross shit that has to be called out because
9235720	9241000	that is, I mean, I'm, I was going to say it's unforgivable. It's unforgivable. I was going
9241000	9246200	to sit here and get very angry and say it's unacceptable because it is, but I'm not sure
9246280	9252360	what getting angry is going to do because now, if you're wondering when is this cyber bullying
9252360	9258120	going to get to the point where somebody does something very, very, here we are.
9259480	9266200	It's, it's now happened. So if you visit the, I don't think any OLR people do this,
9266200	9268840	but I'm just going to say this, even if I'm saying it to the choir,
9268840	9276200	if you visit these websites, if you post on these forums, if you contribute to this culture,
9277800	9284440	I want you to sit there and really think long and hard about this. And I want you to wonder how good
9284440	9293080	you feel about this. This, this is horrible. This, that culture targeting people based on
9294040	9304120	who they are disgusting, flush it down the internet, flush it away. Anyway,
9304840	9311800	that's all I have to say. Sorry. Thank you. And then, uh, going from that, uh, river, uh,
9311800	9318280	the real life dog counterpart for the in game dog dog meat from final out four has also died.
9319240	9326680	No. Oh yeah. I heard about that too. Oh, that's, that's sad. Yeah. Yeah. Losing pets is very hard.
9328520	9334280	All right. So there you go. I'm like, can you give us one more story,
9334280	9340600	please? To change the tone. Um, all right. Raccoon city police department still isn't
9340600	9345640	playable except in custom matches for dead by daylight. Okay. Um, wait, I'm going to,
9345640	9350280	I'm going to find something from our discord over at vog network.com slash discord,
9350280	9354120	where people post stories throughout the week in the orange lounge radio channel.
9354120	9358200	And we'd like to read some of that on air, although a lot of these, we did get to, okay,
9358200	9364200	this one's funny. I'll do this one. So this is funny. Um, 13 X forever actually posted a tweet,
9364200	9370280	uh, from user way bullocks, not to be confused with, you know, who, um, but it is, um, I'm not
9370280	9375240	a lawyer or anything, but this feels like a lawsuit waiting to happen. And it's a screen grab from
9375640	9381720	evil two and then a screen grab for the walking dead survivors. That is literally pictures
9381720	9387800	photoshopped right on top of the resident evil to cover art. So somebody made a boo-boo there.
9387800	9393560	However, in reading the replies, some people are saying that this was all made up. Um,
9393560	9397560	but then other people are saying, no, it was an advertisement that they were using.
9397560	9402360	So there's a little bit of controversy as to, is the artwork real or not? So take it with a
9402360	9407720	grain of salt, I suppose, but I could certainly see something like that with a salt lick. Yeah,
9407720	9413880	for sure. For sure. Um, let's see. And then, uh, Oh, this is interesting from dungeon buster.
9413880	9419480	TSR games is back the studio behind the original dungeons and dragons, like those old school.
9419480	9423720	I'm talking to the old school games on like Commodore 64, apple two E, you know, the old,
9423720	9429480	old school ones, uh, they have returned to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin under Gary Gygax Jr.
9430200	9436120	That's right. Yeah. So they're coming back. That's an official press release from a PR.com
9437000	9439880	link there in our discord. That is really cool. I wonder what they're going to make.
9440920	9447080	Hmm. Very cool. I don't have the license for D and D cause that was sold. Yeah,
9447080	9451960	but they could still do something maybe inspired by the old inspired by is the keyword there.
9451960	9458200	And especially the old games, who knows there. So, um, anyway, um, uh, that is a very much happier
9458200	9462360	note to end on. There's a, that studio coming back. Very, very cool. Um,
9464920	9472200	go ahead, family in general is questionable. Uh, yeah, but you know, I understand if they
9472200	9478120	want to get the license, they have to maybe make deals that, you know, no, I'm just saying
9478120	9484600	as people. Yeah, I know. All right. Anyhow, let's get to our final thoughts for tonight,
9485080	9489560	and wrap the show up. Uh, and, uh, thank you guys once again for listening to our show and
