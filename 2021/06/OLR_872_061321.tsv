0	24240	Happy E3 Week! And that's pretty much it. God, this is a lot of time to fill. I hate
24240	29920	saying the same thing over and over, even a year apart. So, that's it! It's E3 Week!
31520	35040	What else is there to say? Let's start the show!
41040	49840	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge
49920	57840	Radio. We've got a lot more to say. We're live once again tonight with episode number 872 of
57840	65280	our show for this June the 13th of 2021. I am Rob Roberts and I am joined via Discord by my co-host,
65280	68480	say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
69360	71040	Greetings and salivations.
71040	72080	Hi, how are you doing?
72800	79280	I am okay. I am just going into all of my various Discords and letting them know they should be
79280	79920	listening to us.
80720	81760	Getting that promotion in.
82560	83600	That's what I do.
83600	87040	Speaking of promotion, I probably am not supposed to talk about this on air,
87040	91520	but oops, I'll ask for forgiveness later. But I've been hearing some more DarkSakura tunes.
92080	96000	You sent me one this morning or yesterday and I was like,
96000	99040	when's the album dropping? When's the album dropping?
99040	106240	Well, most of the stuff I'm just doing is loops and I just started playing around with things
106240	110400	yesterday just to kind of futz around with a different style and I was trying to do like
110400	115600	this weird acoustic thing and it turned out like all kinds of Southern rock and my mom really likes
115600	119840	it. So, yay, I guess.
119840	127440	Good. Yeah, I think a lot of people right now are streaming Solar Power by Lorde. But, you know,
127440	127840	in a few weeks...
127840	128480	It's a good song.
128480	129520	Yeah, it's a good song. They're going to be...
131200	134560	This week has been a blessing in music. We had a new Marina album,
134560	138160	we had that Kylie Lady Gaga thing, which is a gift from Gay God.
138880	141520	We had a garbage album.
141520	142080	Your cover.
142640	143140	What's that?
143920	147600	That's not the only cover because someone covered the country Born This Way.
147600	150800	Oh, yeah. Orville Peck did that and then Big Freedia did Judas.
150800	153120	Big Freedia. Yeah, that was so good.
153120	156960	That whole reimagining or whatever is going to be pretty crazy. But yeah,
156960	161760	I was just saying this is a great week for music. So people are satisfied with music for quite some
161760	168960	time. And then, you know, hopefully in a few weeks, well, maybe more like a few months,
168960	172800	we'll have Dark Soccer to add to that list and whatever album she ends up putting out.
172800	173360	No pressure.
175760	182320	No pressure. Hi, chat over at twitch.tv slash Vogue Network. And the chat is commenting that
182320	187600	I look a little out of focus. You know what? I bet the resolution on my camera dropped because OBS
187600	194880	had a small update today. And every time they do that, I see that the camera setting sometimes
194880	199120	reset for Dark Soccer and Loki. Not an issue because we capture them via Discord. So it
199120	202480	doesn't really change. So they're just coming in from Discord. But me, I think mine reset.
202480	207120	So I'll try to fix that. So do not adjust your sets on Twitch. I might get I might have that
207120	210560	whole thing I had last week where I get really big again and all that. But we'll fix all that.
211600	212960	I also want to say your ego.
212960	214560	Rob, Rob, it's just water weight.
214560	220400	Hey, hi, Loki, by the way. The first words out of your mouth tonight are shade. It must be
221440	226800	game convention week, that's for sure. Hey, I want to give a shout out in our chat because I just saw
226800	232720	Black Compat said hi hi in the chat. And I want to say hi hi and grats, grats right back at you,
232720	236480	Black Compat, because and if you don't know Black Compat, you should be following them,
236480	242240	fix that because Black Compat is the artists formerly known as Electric Sistahood, which
242240	246080	was on the VOG network. And we go back our little our little friendship goes back to all games back
246080	251120	in the day and all that. So we've been we've been frenzy's friend shows for a long time. Black
251120	256080	Compat just got the partner. Well, they're not partner yet, but they just applied for partner.
256080	260800	But that means they met the stats and all that measurement for partner. And that's a huge
260800	265280	accomplishment. So I just want to say congrats. And if Twitch doesn't accept you as a partner,
265280	271200	they are dumb. So fingers and toes crossed for you guys. So just want to give that some people
271200	275600	who shouldn't make partner who have made partners. So I will be super pissed.
275600	281680	I saw that Twitch drama this week. That was something. No, I the lovely ladies over at
281680	287600	Black Compat would be a huge win for Twitch. So I hope you listen in Twitch admins. Do it.
287600	290720	Yeah. All right. No Twitch admins are listening to this show.
291920	297680	And also unban my friend. All right. Loki, hi. How are you? How's your week been?
298560	302240	We're pretty good. Yeah. What do you mean up to I see a lot of
303520	307840	pics of the kids. What's what's going on and all that stuff? Do one of the kids have a birthday
307840	314560	this week? No, no, it's my youngest son's graduated from first grade. So he's in now
314560	320960	in second grade. Oh, that's great. Wait a minute. But like, it's OK. So the graduation happened
320960	325280	this week. They didn't they don't start school or is it like a year round school type of thing?
326240	330480	I will. His school's kind of year round, but I mean, honestly, like with the stuff,
330480	334800	they're giving him a third grade work anyways as it is. Oh, wow. I guess he's pretty smart. So
337040	340880	it's just it's kind of all year round. He's always at that school, so they don't really
340880	345600	have a starting end. Let me ask a kind of a weird question, but do you think, you know,
345600	349200	because you mentioned like, oh, the kids smart and getting the more advanced work.
349200	353440	Do you think the fact that you've kind of taught them about programming and I know you've put them
353440	357920	in like the supplemental classes and stuff and well, I don't know if that's it's both your kids
357920	364400	you put in those like Code Ninja classes, right? No, just my oldest son right now.
364400	369200	OK, but but still like there I know they've got to be learning stuff from you and a lot of the
369200	374080	stuff like with Minecraft and all that. Do you think I just because I think about like how we
374080	378320	when we were growing up, video games would give you such a bad rap, right? Like only like,
378320	383200	you know, nerds and deviants played video games and all this stuff. But I think I feel like we're
383200	388000	in a world now where video games are super educational. And I don't I don't just mean I
388000	392320	don't mean like number munchers. We're in the world is Carmen Sandiego. Don't get me wrong.
392320	396400	Those games are phenomenal and a part of our upbringing. But I mean, things like, for example,
396400	402880	this week, big release game builder garage comes out, right? Huge target on teaching kids. I don't
402880	409120	think anybody's going to make the next big video game in game builder garage. But it's a nice
409120	415520	little playroom to learn about logic gating and law. And I think that's a huge skill to teach kids
415520	424640	like if then or and like every industry touches logic, even the work I do, I have to use logic a
424640	431200	lot in my presentation. I work in tech. Exactly. It's all over. So I so that's my very long window
431200	438640	way of asking, do you think the games helped the kid? Yeah, I guess I don't really see him do that
438640	443760	a lot because he's been playing Roblox all the time. But OK, but that's another example in a
443760	450320	way. And actually to that, he's actually going to be doing a so they have the code ninjas like
450320	455440	regular stuff. And then he's got a they have this summer camps that they run. So they have different
455440	461120	specialized things. And so he's actually doing a Roblox one in like a week here. So he'll be
461120	465440	learning how to make stuff for that. So I think that'll be a little bit better. But yeah, he's
465440	473920	already moving on to the next belt here pretty soon, which I think they switched to Lua instead
473920	483280	of JavaScript. I don't know. That's what it is right now. But yeah, I mean, I don't know. He's
483280	489360	not he does it on the side, like independently, but he doesn't use like scratch, for example,
489360	496160	to make games right now. He's using it to make animations. So, you know, he's having fun with
496160	502480	that. But yeah, I'm sure that'll come down, you know, later on, once he kind of gets a bigger
502480	509360	idea of like what to do with it. It'll definitely help him. Yeah. Did you pick up on the topic of
509360	514560	that? Yeah. Game Builder Garage. I did pick it up. So my youngest son is playing that.
514560	518560	And so he showed me like this tag game he made the other day, which I think is just part of the
518560	524240	tutorial, but like that you like has a two player game where one person has to try to tag you. And
524240	529200	if they tag you hit with something, then you lose or something like that. So it's pretty cool.
531360	535760	Yeah, I got to check out the demo for that still. And at some point, I feel like I might get the
535760	540080	full game. I almost want to just get the game to play other people's games like that. That's
540080	546080	the best part of Mario Maker to me, honestly. So our little big planet or, you know, we have to
546080	550800	pick up dreams, you know, that that's something that dreams has been on a deep cut sale recently,
550800	555520	too. Somebody in chat earlier was saying they got it for 999. So that game's Yeah, it's I don't know
555520	559520	if that's right now, or if that was a few weeks ago, but I'm sure there's a lot of sales going on
559520	565360	this week, for sure. So check that out. Anyway, um, it's a huge week in gaming, right? This is,
565360	569040	you know, as Jason was kind of tongue in cheek alluding to in the intro, which I love that.
569040	574640	It's, you know, E3 week and this is an interesting year because we're in the middle of E3. Most years
574640	579680	I think last year was like this too. But most years, E3 is like a Tuesday, Wednesday,
579680	583600	Thursday sort of thing because E3 really is supposed to be a trade show. It's for people
583600	587520	that are in the industry. It's for people. It's working, you know, so it's during work time,
588240	592240	Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, with Monday being set up and Friday being tear down and travel home
592240	597600	and all that good stuff. So having this kind of like right in the middle where we're kind of right
597600	602080	in the middle of E3 week when we're doing our show Sunday night is a little interesting and a little
602080	608160	different. But obviously it's not just E3 because obviously with everything that's been going on in
608160	612640	the world, with all the changes that have been going on in E3, we've seen some other deviations.
612640	617120	We've seen indies that are kind of putting together their own thing. And of course we have,
617120	622160	I think the first recap we want to get into a little bit, Jeff Keighley's Summer Game Fest,
622160	628000	which was the first event, media event. They're not really press conferences anymore. I keep
628000	632400	wanting like my old brain that's been doing the show for 19 years and covering E3 for a long time
632400	635120	wants to keep saying press conference, press conference. That's not really what they are now,
635120	639440	especially in the age of COVID. They're digital media showcases, basically, or digital media
639440	645680	events. So the first big event we had was the Summer Game Fest event on Thursday, right in the
645680	651200	middle of the workday. So I unfortunately was not going to be able to watch it, but then get this,
651920	658800	our VPN at work went down for like an hour. So I had time to watch it and I didn't do it.
658800	663120	I didn't do it. I didn't hack it. Maybe somebody else at work did something. No,
663120	669280	it's just, I think just lucky timing, I guess. So I kind of got to watch that a little bit. I mean,
669280	673680	I kind of, work came back up partway through, so I had to kind of multitask. But I did get to see
673680	678480	it live, which I didn't think I'd originally be able to. Thoughts overall. Let's start.
678480	682960	Loki, I know you'll kind of touch on everything, but how was your feeling overall of the Summer
682960	688160	Game Fest? Especially because I think that type of announcement was kind of new. I know we had
688160	692960	Summer Game Fest last year, but it was like this big four month nebulous thing. And I feel like
692960	700400	this was a different type of, it's like Jeff and Friends own digital media event outside of the big
700400	704080	ones. And it was interesting. There were some high points for me and some low points for me.
704080	707840	But Loki, I'll start with you. What were some of the high points for you and the low points for you?
708880	713120	I'm trying to, gosh, like that's the problem with E3 and all these different events is everything
713120	718080	starts bleeding into each other. Like I don't remember what was announced there versus what
718080	724800	was announced, you know, other places. I mean, was the one from Software Game looks cool,
724800	731440	even though it's a game I'm never going to play it. But it looks cool. I'm trying to think if
731440	737280	there's anything like really exciting that they announced there that other than that, that I don't
737280	742400	know, honestly, like the Xbox stuff, like some of these smaller indie games look really, really
742400	747760	good. Like I'm trying to think of some of the examples here, but like there is like some like
747760	754880	2D looking games that they have that just absolutely just gorgeous. Yeah. But I think
754880	759360	those are more interesting than some of these bigger games almost. Well, let's talk about the
759360	764160	big ones. So the grand finale at the end of the whole thing was Elden Ring. I'm not sure
764160	767840	personally how I kind of feel about this game. Like I understand there's a lot of people very
767840	773280	hyped for this game, but I'm also, I'm not big on Game of Thrones like a lot of people. Sorry. I
773280	778240	just, you know, I play so many games. I've fallen behind on my TV. So I never really got into that.
778240	784160	So the George R.R. Martin thing. Yeah. Evil Dead. That was something that looked pretty cool.
784800	790800	Okay. I like Evil Dead. But Elden Ring. So there's, you know, the trailer and I'm just,
790800	795040	I'm not super into the Souls game, but then I think about my husband, Alan, he loves Dark
795040	800880	Souls and he's played Dark Souls. He's platinumed Dark Souls. That is, that is a gaming flex right
800880	805200	there to have the, well, I'm sorry, the Steam equivalent of platinum, but he has every
805200	810080	achievement or whatever. So he's, he's done that on Dark Souls. I think he's done it on Dark Souls
810080	814960	too. And I think oddly enough, he hasn't really completed Dark Souls 3. I guess there's something
814960	819600	about it that is different or whatever. So I think he might be more into that sort of thing,
819600	824640	but I, for me, I'm just kind of like, it looks pretty. I'm like, this is eye candy,
824640	829440	like left and right. You know, we're really seeing the potential of the systems, but I otherwise was
829440	835440	just kind of like, all right, cool for the people that are into Souls games. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
836240	841120	And I do see some excitement in her chat also. Uh, Ninja the monkey in chat says Elden Ring,
841120	846160	finally. Uh, we also have a Quest Buster is reminding, um, also the Elden Ring trailer.
846240	849600	I want to get this comment out too, because Bobby says, uh, Bobby Blackwell says,
849600	854000	this was the game awards without the awards. Yeah, it absolutely was. It was, uh, you know,
854000	859040	just kind of just the announcement part of it. I'll tell you one announcement that surprised me
859040	864880	that I was into was the, uh, the first or second one. It was the, uh, tiny Tina borderlands.
864880	869440	Yeah, the wonderlands. I was, yeah, that's it. Tiny Tina wonderlands. I was actually kind of
869440	873680	into it because, uh, when I saw it was gearbox and 2k and all that. And then there should,
873680	878000	at first I was like, okay, Oh God, is this going to be a fart joke game? Like when they,
878000	881200	when they were kind of announcing some of those comment comics in it, I was like,
881200	885680	it's going to be a fart joke game, but then Wanda Sykes was one of the comments. And I was like,
885680	890400	okay, Wanda Sykes is amazing. And she can tell all the fart jokes she wants. I will,
890400	897120	I'll check it out for her. Cause I, I, I, I just love the way she talks. Like I just, I she's like,
897120	902800	just hearing her tell a story is hilarious. Her standup albums. And I listened to them
902880	908560	every so often. Yeah. No. And, and, and somebody has a delivery. I just know, I know there's been
908560	913360	that meme around Facebook. Like who would narrate the book on tape of your life? And I've always
913360	918480	said Wanda Sykes because she's so funny and my life's pretty funny. I can see that. Yeah. So,
918480	927280	um, so I know who I would want to narrate mine. Who actually it's a streamer. Oh, kill cannon.
927280	931200	Okay. Okay. It was just narrate my life. Have you listened to this man's voice?
931200	935760	Uh, I, I have, but I'm only a little bit, so I'm like having trouble recalling it
935760	939680	in my mind. Oh my God. He's got such a nice voice. I thought you were going to see,
939680	943280	I thought you were going to say LC at first and I can definitely hear their voice in my head. You
943280	950800	know, got them. I can definitely hear that. We love to see, um, no, I, I went kill cannon to
950800	956000	narrate my life just because I would, I would follow sleep to that, to those soothing tones.
956000	961360	Uh, low key. Why not? Let's finish the trifecta. Who would narrate your autobiography or whatever,
961360	969200	uh, with the book on tape version? Um, Ryan Reynolds. Oh God, that is such the heterosexual
969200	975360	answer. I love that. All right. He's snarky. It's the snark that I'm attracted to.
976800	984240	You have a little man crush. Well, and he showed up. Okay. Tying it back. He showed up at the
984240	989040	summer game fest thing too, with that trailer for the movie. I'm excited about that movie.
989040	993680	Actually, I know who else I would choose and that would be Emma Stone, but as Cruella.
994480	999040	Oh, okay. Love that. I need to see it. I need to see it. Rob, we should go see it.
999040	1004160	I think we should. I haven't been to a theater in, since, uh, I don't, I literally don't remember
1004160	1008640	the last time I was in a movie theater. Let's have a friend date. Are we gonna have a friend date?
1008640	1013760	Oh my God. Can we, can we have a friend date and then we're going to get one popcorn and share it
1013760	1020640	and maybe our hands will awkwardly touch. Let's do it. Okay. All right. Let's do it.
1022480	1027600	Okay. Uh, let's see. Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says, William Shatner. I understand that,
1027600	1033680	but William Shatner is kind of an asshole. Um, and yeah, anyway, I'm going to just tell that
1033680	1039120	story another day. Um, let's see evil, uh, ether VL and chat says Morgan Freeman. Oh,
1039120	1044560	that's a good one too. All right. Morgan Freeman's the one that's like the meme
1044560	1050560	version of that. I will just have corpse husband do it. I love that. Bobby Black Wolf says someone
1050560	1055760	doing William Shatner's voice then. Perfect. Perfect. It's like, it's like, uh, it's not
1055760	1061840	Johnny Depp as, uh, captain Jack Sparrow. It's somebody else doing captain Jack Sparrow.
1061840	1067440	Why not just have, um, Patrick Stewart narrate your life? Oh, that's a good one. That's a good
1067440	1074880	one. Anyway. All right. Look back to the, uh, so tiny Tina's wonderlands. I was into it because
1074880	1080640	I was like, Oh my God, if they made borderlands a high fantasy game, I'm kind of all about that.
1080640	1085920	That sounds like it'd be a lot of fun. Yeah. So I think that might've been my favorite thing,
1085920	1092080	believe it or not that I saw. I found some games that looked interesting to me, although I am
1092080	1098000	super, super pissed about star Lord, the game house. Oh, the, the one they were talking about
1098000	1105040	today. Yeah. Well, we'll get into that later. Yeah. But I'm also interested in that, um,
1105040	1109440	avatar game. Cause I freaking love the avatar universe. You're jumping way ahead.
1109440	1113600	That's all I'm jumping ahead, but those are what I'm excited about. A lot of people have
1113600	1116560	their feelings. All right. This week we'll get to, we'll get to the avatar thing in the next
1116560	1123040	segment. Um, so, uh, the other announcements. Okay. The death stranding director's cut. What
1123040	1127920	are your, what are your like? Cause, so it was, um, you know, it was totally obvious too. Jeff
1127920	1135040	Keeley is like, I've got a friend here. That's gonna talk to, it's just like, Oh my God. Like
1135040	1139280	you and Hideo Kojima have like such a bromance. Like it's so obvious. Like your crush is so
1139280	1145200	obvious. Jeff. Like, I feel like if I looked at Jeff binder, Jeff's binder, it would say
1145200	1152480	Mr. Jeff Kojima, Mr. Jeff Kojima all over it. Like your crush is so obvious, but there's a box.
1153200	1156560	Yeah. Well, okay. Did you, did you see that trailer? Cause it was pretty funny
1156560	1161680	because at first, you know, I was like, wait a minute, is this a different game in the death
1161680	1166400	stranding engine? Because that was the vibe I got at first and I was like into it. I was like, Oh,
1166400	1171200	they're going to meet. But then it was like, kind of like self parody. It was like Kojima's
1171680	1177040	colliding for the thing. Yeah. Oh no. And then it ended up. Yeah. It was definitely like a special
1177040	1181040	thing for the event. It's like, how much can they really, I mean, I guess they can milk it forever
1181040	1188800	for, um, mill your solid, but I thought it was like VR missions, I guess for, um, death stranding.
1188800	1192800	Yeah. But also how are you going to crawl through an event with all that stuff on your backpack?
1192800	1198720	I mean, that's just physically impossible. You can't be stealthy carrying around like
1198720	1205280	20 stacked packages on your back. Yeah. A 50 foot tall package stack on your back. Um,
1205280	1210000	Questbuster in chat says, I thought the same. I thought he was hinting towards some new expansion
1210000	1213680	or something for death stranding. That's what I kind of got the vibe at too. I was like, Oh,
1213680	1218720	maybe like an expansion. Like my, my brain went to the final fantasy seven remake and the inner and
1218720	1222640	the integrate and the Yuffie thing that all happened just this week as well. Um, and I
1222640	1225760	thought maybe that's what was happening for death stranding. And I guess when they say director's
1225760	1231040	cut, I would assume that's what it is. Like, wouldn't a director's cut be adding stuff in.
1231040	1236640	Isn't that what a director's cut does? It would be adding things that were intended to be in.
1236640	1242000	Yeah. Yeah. We really just wanted to put mill gear into death stranding completely.
1242000	1246560	I don't think any of that is actually in the game. I think that was all just a big joke for the
1246560	1252800	reveal, but it's interesting. I did. You know what though? At the end of the day, I, and I, I say,
1252800	1259920	I did love death stranding, even if I didn't beat it, because I think it came out at the re that
1259920	1264800	game's release is so interesting because I think it came out at the right time and the wrong time.
1264800	1270720	I think it came out at the right time because what a, I don't even know the word for it. What
1270720	1278240	a poetic piece, I guess on COVID without exactly. Right. It came out. It just is. I mean,
1279200	1284480	yeah, we had animal crossing as the perfect release, but death stranding also really had
1284480	1289040	that parallel going on and it wasn't even intentional. Right. But then for me, that also
1289040	1295440	made it a bad thing because for me and like, you know, you know, as an extrovert, I've been having
1295440	1301680	a very hard time these last 50 months. So for me, it was almost like too much for me, like mentally.
1301680	1307520	And I was, and for that reason, I was more drawn to the cute little animal friendships and my BFF
1307920	1311040	catch up and all that stuff at animal crossing instead, which I still need to give you your
1311040	1316720	catch up. Yay. All right. Can she come on the date to the movie? Yeah, she can come on the date to
1316720	1322320	the movie. Okay. Yay. Quest Buster in chat says I enjoyed death stranding. It was different and
1322320	1327760	it was kind of fun co-oping and road building with shared resource donations. Also zip line
1327760	1333760	networks for the win. Yeah, absolutely. So I I'll, I'll, I'll check it. I don't have a PS five yet,
1333760	1337440	but I imagine by the time I get one, the director's cut will be down in price a little
1337440	1341600	bit. So I'll probably still check it out. I'll double dip. Why not? I guess I'm the problem.
1342240	1346400	Is it only on PlayStation five? Are they doing like, um, the PC version as well?
1346400	1351840	I guess they didn't say my assumption was a PS five thing, but you ask a good question.
1353680	1359920	It probably is the only piece, but I don't know. PC's a decent guess. Um, did you know your webcam
1360000	1365040	died? Loki. I'm sure Jamie because I'm eating ice cream. It's okay. I'm like, I'm talking to,
1365040	1370000	I'm talking to two dots right now. No, it's all good. It's all good. Sorry. It's my wife got me
1370000	1376960	vampire penguin. So like, you know, it's, uh, it's fine. You can show us ice cream, Loki. It's okay.
1378000	1382240	Okay. See? Yeah, I'm okay with that. All right. Anyway. Uh, what else, what else do we miss from
1382240	1386160	summer game Fest though? If you can take a break between bites to remind me of the things I'm
1386160	1390800	missing. Oh gosh. I'm trying to remember all the different things they announced. Um,
1391440	1396560	lots of Netflix stuff. Like I'm kind of curious. I mean, I don't know, like I'm curious about the,
1396560	1401520	the blood dragon inspired thing. Although what they showed, like,
1402080	1406400	doesn't resemble blood dragon, like blood dragons, like just very tongue in cheek,
1406400	1412880	you know, spoof of all eighties actions stuff with like a ton of like neon synthwave stuff.
1413680	1419280	And the guy that's doing it, I like his fan films that he puts out the unofficial,
1419280	1424960	like bootleg films or whatever. Um, I just don't see it. I mean, it looks like a pretty
1424960	1430080	cool animated thing, but like, it's just not, it's not blood dragon. I don't know.
1430080	1434640	Okay. I have, I'll check it out. I have a list of a few things to remind myself, um,
1434640	1440560	of what was announced at the summer game Fest. Um, uh, a near automatic crossover with fall guys
1440640	1444640	and that to be costume for fall guys. That was kind of funny. I thought of act deaf because I
1444640	1450800	know he's a fan of that game. Um, the two point campus. So that's one of those SIM games. That's
1450800	1456000	that whole SIM universe that a two point hospital. Yeah, exactly. So two point campus. And that
1456000	1460640	looked a little batshit crazy, but I also know that like, I know dark soccer loves those SIM
1460640	1464000	type games. So I kind of was like, oh, maybe that'd be something that she's into. Well,
1464000	1468000	not to say I'm not into him. I might check it out. Um, it just looked a little batshit crazy
1468000	1471360	to me, like almost like there was too much going on in that game. You know,
1471360	1476560	but I think that's the appeal of that series is that they're a little bit, uh, tongue in cheek,
1476560	1481920	so to speak. Yeah. You couldn't do your, was it your magicians campus or something like that?
1482960	1488720	Interesting. Um, the also, I thought this was a very strange time to announce this whole, like,
1488720	1493680	we've got a new gaming label and that was a big thing they got into there was that there was,
1493680	1498240	uh, that prime matter where payday three Kings bounty two, the new painkiller game.
1498240	1501760	So they kind of had a bunch of like rapid fire stuff in there. Um, that was interesting that
1501760	1505440	they use that opportunity to say we're launching a new label. I thought that was a little weird,
1505440	1511200	but I mean, not like bad weird, but just like, just kind of weird, weird. So anyway. Um, and
1511200	1518240	then there were some other ones too. There's, um, uh, Jurassic world evolution too. They
1518240	1522160	have played the first one, but it looked interesting. I don't know. Maybe I'd be
1522160	1528320	more interested when the movie comes up. Sorry. Alan is texting me from target. My favorite place
1528320	1534160	and like, uh, do you want this? Do you want this? Um, okay. Um, yeah, I, I forgot. Okay.
1534160	1538880	Here's the thing. I forgot there was even a drastic world evolution one until, and then
1538880	1542320	when they played that trailer, I was like, Ooh, this looks really pretty. What is this? And then
1542320	1546400	they were like, it's evolution too. And I was like, Oh yeah, I forgot that that was a thing.
1546400	1551520	So maybe that's a series I need to check out. I don't know. Um, and then there was one more
1551520	1555120	and I was hoping Dar Sakura would be back for this, but, um, that's all right. I can ask her
1555120	1560800	later, but there was that metal slug tactics game that was kind of interesting. Yeah. It's
1560800	1565280	kind of our left field there, but it looked interesting. Yeah, for sure. So I thought that
1565280	1570160	was a little bit weird that that, um, showed up. I also, I think the tactics thing has been a mobile
1570160	1577920	game before, but like all I wanted though from that is like very, they had this anime intro type
1577920	1584240	thing to it. I'm like, I want a metal slug anime now. Not necessarily like, uh, the tactics game
1584240	1591120	is fine, but it's like, I'll take the anime, please. Um, can that come to Netflix? So,
1592800	1597680	yeah. So overall I thought the summer game Fest thing, it was fine. There were some decent
1597680	1605120	announcements, but I did think it ran a little long for what they had in it. Um, there were some
1605120	1609200	nice, like, you know, they had like the Weezer thing and the, actually that first musical
1609200	1613680	performance was the best one. And I, I'm so sorry, I forgot her name or the game that it was
1613680	1617520	promoting, which is terrible. But all I remember is that I really liked that performance that was
1617520	1622080	better than the Weezer thing to me. Um, somebody in chat, please help me out here. Um, but if you
1622080	1627280	want to talk about music to stream, that was really cute. I have that weird tie-in with that boat,
1627280	1632480	like gateboarding game. Well, that game looked cute for sure. Yeah, it's cute. It's just like,
1632480	1638880	like, this is so random that this is tied in with the game, but okay. Yeah. Yeah. Um, gosh,
1638880	1642080	now it's bugging me. I can't remember the name of the artist, like butterfly something, butterfly
1642080	1646880	garden. I can't remember. Shucks. Uh, hopefully somebody in chat will help me out here in a
1646880	1652800	moment. Um, but yeah, that was the, uh, the musical performance I liked. Thank you. Okay. Wow. I
1652800	1657040	messed up the name completely. Mike Deff said it was Japanese breakfast. Where the hell did I get
1657120	1662480	butterfly garden from? Was that the name of the song maybe? Or am I just, am I just at the point
1662480	1667120	where I'm just straight up making shit up? All right. Butterflies and gardens. Apparently,
1667120	1670880	apparently I'm thinking of a nice, so Japanese breakfast was the name of the artist. That does
1670880	1675840	sound right now that you're saying that. So, um, that was, uh, that was great. All right. Um,
1675840	1681680	let's move on. Let's talk about the next, uh, uh, media event, which was Ubisoft's event.
1681680	1686320	So the Ubisoft forward event happened. Um, I actually don't think any of us were able
1686320	1690800	to catch it live. We only caught kind of the headlines, but let me kick it back over to dark
1690800	1695120	soccer because you had brought up the avatar game. Um, and I know this was a big thing that
1695120	1700800	Ubisoft announced. And a lot of the reaction I saw online to this was, well, this game's about
1700800	1706240	10 years too late, but I don't think so. I don't think so either. Cause if you've got those sequel
1706240	1711280	at like, wasn't the first sequel supposed to be this year, but then COVID. Yeah. I think
1711760	1716720	the new avatar movie is coming out. Yeah. So, so this is perfectly right. I think that people have
1716720	1721760	allowed themselves to forget. Yeah. I think you're right. But our soccer, I know you were a big fan
1721760	1724880	of the movie and the lore and all that stuff. What, what do you, what did you think about
1724880	1729520	hearing about this new game? Um, I would have liked to have seen more about it,
1729520	1736880	but it looks really pretty and I'm interested in this snow drop engine. Um, uh, I think that
1736880	1740320	it would, you know, once I see a little bit more about it, you know, depending on like
1740960	1746720	character customization, what the story's going to be, it just still makes me think I would like a,
1746720	1753440	um, uh, an MMO in that universe. I would play an MMO in that universe in a heartbeat.
1754320	1759760	And I think it's also, it's an avatar game is also a good, um, chance to kind of reintroduce
1759760	1764640	avatar to, uh, the world. Cause it has been a little while since that first movie.
1764640	1769520	And I think there's a lot of pressure on those sequels to perform very well because that first,
1769520	1774240	you know, movie is like the biggest motion picture of all time, if I'm not mistaken, right? Yeah.
1774240	1778880	So, I mean, absolutely. So there's a lot of pressure on those sequels to do very well.
1778880	1782960	And so I think in order to help that they kind of need to bring avatar back into
1782960	1788160	that pop culture consciousness, if that makes sense. Um, totally. That's what they need to do.
1788160	1793200	And the, um, Disney stuff at Orlando is a part of that too, right? Cause they just opened the
1793200	1797360	Pandora thing at is the animal kingdom or one of those parks down there. They opened the whole
1797360	1802400	Pandora's world there and that's a big deal. Uh, apparently it's really well done. Yeah. So.
1803680	1808400	It's I just, I was watching the trailer and I've watched it a couple of times. It just seems
1808400	1814800	really like that was one of the few things that really grabbed me out of the stuff I was able to
1814800	1821200	see. Um, going into chat, a Zen monkey says avatar got beat by infinity war end game. I think did it.
1821200	1825440	I thought they did a rerelease of avatar that put it, but I could be wrong. I don't, but
1826160	1831200	either way shenanigans at one point, but I think they re-released it in theaters again. So that's
1831200	1837040	why it's like, it's back all that stuff aside. It still doesn't negate the point that those
1837040	1842000	sequels are under tremendous pressure to do well because the first movie did so well. Um,
1842000	1845680	see a Tiberian chat says they could always cancel sequels like they did divergent. Well,
1845680	1848640	they're not going to do that because they've already filmed at least two of them, right?
1848640	1852960	Like isn't a James Cameron filming like four of them, like back to back to back,
1852960	1858400	like not taking a break. Yeah. It's, it's seems like it's a lot like when we get a sequel,
1858400	1861840	we're getting sequels. There's going to be a whole Cameron. So, you know,
1861840	1868800	he's going to go through it anyway. Yeah, for sure. Um, so yeah. Uh, crystal, uh, crystal,
1869600	1874480	why can't I talk today? Crystal skies in chat says, yeah, two of them are already filmed.
1874480	1878080	I thought that's what I'd heard too. Cause I, I remember there was talk about Sigourney Weaver
1878080	1882080	being in them and all that, which made me go, didn't well, you know, I don't, I don't want,
1882080	1887120	but you know, everyone lives through the tree. How is she in it? Okay. So, Oh, wow. They have
1887120	1892320	an entire city built in New Zealand. Well, that's the place to film it. I'm sure that's going to be
1892320	1896880	interesting. So anyway. Um, so, okay. Yeah. So the game is happening and I'm sure the game is going
1896880	1902880	to be, um, um, uh, pretty, pretty big undertaking as well. Um, let's see, what else did we miss at
1902880	1909200	the Ubisoft event? Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So that whole thing's getting a sequel, which is, uh,
1909200	1915440	pretty exciting. What do you think about that? It looks deep. I played a little bit of the first
1915440	1920560	one. I know my kids played more of it, but yeah, it looks cool. Um, I just, I like how Nintendo
1920560	1925920	leaked that. Yeah. Uh, it just came to my mind, of course, my, my music game roots are very excited
1925920	1930960	to hear about this, that rock Smith is making a comeback. Um, so, but it's, it's this whole rock
1930960	1936080	Smith port for a while though they did, but now there's a whole new thing coming out. There's this
1936080	1940720	rock Smith plus that's coming out. Um, that is going to help you learn how to play guitar. And
1940720	1944800	I think they're actually like teaming up with like guitar schools and this whole thing. And there's
1944800	1949760	like a special guitar and all this stuff. So, uh, it's kind of neat to see that that series is still
1949760	1955280	going on. Yeah. Uh, there's going to be a mobile app and a workshop in the game. So it's like,
1955280	1961120	Hey, please buy more stuff for us. Yeah. Real time feedback. That's, that's pretty cool. How like,
1961120	1965120	you know, the whole like learning through a game thing is really going to the next level. That's
1965120	1972640	for sure. Wasn't that what Exeter was doing for a bit? Um, you, you, well, he was playing that
1972640	1978960	game a lot. Yes. He was trying to learn how to play through it. Absolutely. So, um, let's see
1978960	1983120	some other things that they taught. They talked a lot about rainbow six, um, which I know is a
1983120	1987360	huge series, just not one that I am super into, but I know they spend a lot of time on that.
1987360	1992960	They're getting cross play, uh, cross progression with PC. You know, there's a new Just Dance game.
1992960	1998320	Who's excited about that? That's coming out too. Of course they had to do that. Uh, a new kind of
1998320	2003440	like expansion for Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which is, um, good that I don't, I think it's
2003440	2007280	good. They're not doing a whole nother Assassin's Creed game, but they're doing an expansion. I
2007280	2012080	think is a good way to do it. Um, so that's pretty cool. Uh, and then they were talking about fire
2012080	2018640	cry six a little bit as well. So, uh, and, uh, also what was not there, the Prince of Persia
2018640	2023600	Sansa time remake, they bumped it all the way to 2022. Now that thing has been delayed a couple
2023600	2029280	times now, and now they bumped it all the way to 2022. They did not show it. So interesting.
2029280	2033360	It's going to just see if it's actually going to happen. I think it will, but I think it's
2033360	2038560	just having problems. And in all fairness, it's probably COVID related and the difficulties of
2038560	2043920	developing from home and being able to squash the bugs that way. It's probably, uh, uh, you know,
2043920	2050400	not, not doing too well. So they have to take a little extra time. Um, Loki, I know you love
2050400	2055520	these guys that are up next on our agenda, the devolver digital presentation. Did you check this
2055520	2064400	one out? I did skim through it. Yeah. Um, they have like, was it the, um, shadow warrior three
2064400	2070240	looks just nuts. I thought originally when I was looking at that, that it was a new serious Sam
2070240	2077120	game, but yeah, it just looks absolutely crazy. So there's that, um, gosh, I'm trying to think
2077120	2085040	of the atomic, what was the, there was another game, but I can't remember once again, I watched
2085040	2092960	the Xbox and I watched the developer digital all like back to back. Um, gosh, I can't remember
2092960	2097040	what other game they had there that was like really amazing, but there was like a bunch of
2097040	2101680	like crazy stuff. I mean, it's always crazy. And then of course, you know, the, the gimmicks that
2101680	2106160	they do where they're selling like a thousand dollar VHS tape or something like that. Um,
2106800	2112080	always funny. I like this stuff. Yeah, I guess they had a whole like monetization as they're
2112080	2116560	kind of riffing on the whole like monetization type of thing. Um, so the games they announced,
2116560	2121680	Loki, maybe one of these old joggy memory, uh, track to Yomi was one of the games.
2121760	2126880	Um, yeah, that looked interesting. Yeah. Uh, wizard with a gun. I liked, I liked that based
2126880	2131120	on title alone. That's by the, that's by the folks. I want to, I mean, I can't remember.
2131840	2136400	I know it wasn't like they, I thought it was another gun game based on the,
2136400	2140480	the little animated trailer thing that they had at first, but yeah, it's not,
2141040	2146960	but that looked interesting. It kind of had a don't starve vibe to it. Uh, this game sounds
2146960	2153920	super interesting to me. Inscription, which is a, uh, rogue like, but a deck builder with escape
2153920	2160000	room style puzzles and psychological horror. I'm like, wow, way complicated way to take a
2160000	2163680	lot of random shit that I'm into and like throw it all in the same game. I'm, I'm cool with it.
2163680	2169600	I'm into it. Why not? Um, let's see. And then, uh, devolver tumble time. Is that actually the
2169600	2174320	name of the game? I think it is. I thought that was just a parody that he had in there,
2174320	2178880	but yeah, no, it's a, it's a, it's a legit mobile game that's coming out. iOS and Android,
2178880	2188560	uh, demon throttle, uh, is one, uh, death's door, uh, phantom abyss and then shadow warrior three.
2188560	2192560	And that's everything that I see on my list. Demon throttle look cool. Um, but yeah,
2192560	2200720	shadow warrior three is just insane looking. All right. Um, cool. So, uh, that was pretty much what
2200720	2204000	was going on with devolver. Admittedly, I didn't catch it just because there was a lot of other
2204000	2208240	stuff going on this weekend. Uh, I couldn't sit in front of press conferences all weekend long,
2208240	2211520	but I knew I could catch, uh, some of the wrap ups later on, which it sounds like,
2211520	2213680	look, you kind of did you binge watch everything today, right?
2214240	2219200	I just tried to get as much of it in there as I could. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm just, I'm,
2219200	2226320	I don't always do this, but I have to, so I just got a text message from my dad and he says he's
2226320	2230080	watching on the iPad right now, which I don't know if I've ever gotten a text like that,
2230080	2234640	that he's actually watching the show live as it's going on. So, um, can you all in chat show
2234640	2239200	a little love to my dad who's, uh, watching, especially with father's day coming up next week.
2239200	2243040	Uh, I think it's pretty rad that he's watching right now. So, um, give him some shout outs
2243040	2247360	and chat and hello, hello. And, uh, sorry, I'm not texting you back, but I'm a little busy right now,
2247360	2256560	but there you go. All right. Dad, father's day is actually pretty sad for me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
2256560	2261200	I know. I know it's, uh, yeah. Well, and, and, you know, mother's day for me is rough too. So,
2261200	2266880	um, yeah. So, um, but, uh, dad, dad chapped a little, tapped a little button that shows you
2266880	2272160	chat if you don't already see it. Cause there's a lot of love in there. Okay. Anyway. Um, let's
2272160	2277760	move on. Uh, let's talk about one that I definitely watched. Cause I was, uh, watching this event live,
2277760	2284080	um, watching it. What's that? I say where you hate watching it. No, I wasn't the Microsoft event.
2284080	2289440	I wasn't hate watching that was great. No. And I w I wasn't intending on hate watching that,
2289440	2295840	but we'll get to that. So the Microsoft event. So Bobby and I were doing co-stream much. God,
2295840	2301120	there was a lot. Well, what do you think? Yeah. Overall, what did you think of Microsoft? Cause
2301120	2306960	I kind of, I thought it was a tepid reaction on Twitter, but I wasn't, I thought it was excellent.
2306960	2312720	I thought they did a great job. Yeah. I was a little shocked. It was only an hour and 15
2312720	2317520	minutes. But, um, when you consider it, like what I really loved about it. And, uh, when Bobby and
2317520	2323600	I were talking, he really kind of, uh, uh, phrased this a really good way too, is that, um, you have,
2323600	2327840	you have the beginning and, uh, you know, they're, they're saying Microsoft saying, this is what we're
2327840	2331760	going to show you. And then they show it to you. And then at the end, they say, this is what we've
2331760	2336640	shown you. Like, here's the, here's the receipts. And they really did. They showed what, 30 games,
2336640	2343120	27 of them coming to game pass. And once again, I'm sitting here going, this is the greatest
2343120	2349120	game pass commercial that Microsoft is doing with this event. Like there was so much good stuff
2349120	2353840	where it was like, get it on game pass, get it on game pass. I mean, we're talking about new stuff,
2353840	2361360	like the halo game. And we're talking about things like Hades, right? Uh, an amazing game from last
2361360	2366640	year that is also going to be coming to game pass. Um, and I think one of the other big shocks
2366640	2371440	for a game that's coming to game pass is that I had done Chronicles, which, you know, don't call
2371440	2378560	it Suey Coden, but wink, right? There's, there's that whole thing. And that was, that was crowdfunded.
2378560	2385280	So it was a little shocking to hear that Microsoft kind of paid to get it on game pass, but the, um,
2385280	2390480	the creators immediately were doing, if you want to call it damage control, I don't know what you'd
2390480	2393760	call it because I don't think everybody feels burned by this, but you know, there's going to be
2393760	2398080	some anti Xbox people out there that are like, why is this on game pass? I didn't back this game for
2398080	2402080	to be on game. Cause you know, there's always, somebody's going to complain, but they sent out
2402080	2406400	an email almost immediately to backers and disclosure. I am, I was a backer of the game
2406400	2413280	that says, um, it's coming out. Uh, there's going to be a third DLC that this Microsoft deal has
2413280	2417600	completely funded now, in addition to the two, we promised you, and this will be free to all
2417600	2422480	the backers. So it's like, you're, you're going to get more of this game because of this deal.
2422480	2427440	I think it's going to hate on that though, but there's haters going to hate haters going to hate
2428560	2433920	exactly. Exactly. Right. Yeah. And crystal skies 80 and chat says it gets me free deals DLC. So
2433920	2438720	I'm good. And I think that's an important consider that perspective. They're not taking anything
2438720	2445360	away. They're adding to, and this is this, this, this happens a lot in gaming on a lot of
2445360	2451040	different topics. People get mad, but they're not taking away. They're adding to. So it's going to
2451040	2454880	be fine. They're not suddenly taken away the PlayStation version or the switch version.
2454880	2459200	It's just that it's also going to be on game pass, but that's still a huge land for game pass.
2459200	2464480	And in my opinion, a very smart move on Microsoft's part, because what is their biggest,
2464480	2472000	weakest spot right now at Microsoft Japanese developed games and especially exclusive ones,
2472000	2476240	they have a huge weak spot there and everybody knows that's Microsoft's blind spot. And they,
2476240	2482240	they have a really hard time with that is the Japanese develop. So they, they gave this game
2482240	2486800	a lot of money and now that's a huge asset in Microsoft's pocket. I think it's a very smart
2486800	2493680	deal. Good for them. So, all right. Let's see what else do we want to talk about from the Microsoft
2493680	2499200	of that? I know the big one I have to talk about y'all. Cause it was like this unless Nintendo
2499760	2504080	really blows it out of the water on Tuesday, which I'm managing my expectations.
2504080	2509120	I don't see how anything beats Forza Horizon 5. That blew my fucking mind. That trailer was
2509120	2516160	amazing. Um, and what is gorgeous, um, love the fact that they set it in Mexico.
2517120	2523440	And I think it's important to note. I love that the game is trying to shatter a lot of
2523440	2529840	perceptions of Mexico because let's be real. A lot of folks in the U S have a certain perception
2529840	2536480	of Mexico based on the news and the media and that whole thing. Right. And I love the fact that
2536480	2542560	through a video game, they're going to really challenge our perception perceptions of that
2542560	2548480	and really show a lot of, you know, all these diverse things, uh, from an entire country.
2548480	2552160	And I think they really drove the point home when they were like, look how you can get out
2552160	2557280	of your car and take a picture of this mural that was actually developed by a Mexican artist.
2557280	2562560	And as a Diego, I do not remember the artist's name in the moment. I'm sorry. I was absorbing
2562560	2569040	a lot of information, but it was one of the mural, the most, uh, famous, uh, mural creators and
2569040	2576080	painters of Mexico is also married. Uh, uh, his name was Diego Rivera. He was married to, uh,
2576080	2581200	Frida Kahlo. Ah, okay. Okay. And they cheated on each other a lot, but that's art history.
2581280	2585760	That's art history. But even, you know, and so, so even next to all that, the game just
2585760	2590960	looked beautiful. My God. Like I, I, I went back and looked at the, the thing that Bobby and I was
2590960	2597040	doing, my jaw was on the floor watching the graphics. It was so good. Um, so yeah. Uh,
2597040	2603600	Mike Deft is confirming it was not Diego Rivera. Yeah. I didn't see all of it yet. So yeah,
2603600	2607520	just saw a little bit of the trailer. Check out the footage for the game. It looks amazing.
2607600	2613200	Look at a mural. I'd look at Diego. What I also thought was kind of novel about
2613200	2618640	Forza and, uh, Forza Horizon and the fact that it was showing up at Microsoft's conference.
2618640	2625840	That's the game they dedicated the most time to not halo, not battlefield. They dedicated the most
2625840	2632000	time to Forza Horizon five. And like, I, I, I, I, on one hand, I get it because those Forza games
2632000	2636480	are always incredibly critically well-received and I'm sure this game is going to be no different.
2636480	2642400	Um, obviously it's huge. Yeah. And showing up like now you're getting to watch it in 4k even.
2642400	2646640	And when it was being streamed live, it wasn't in 4k. And I bet it's even more gorgeous in 4k.
2646640	2652080	I got to go back and watch it again. Um, but, uh, just the fact that that was the tent pole
2652080	2657120	made me so happy because that was what really finally converted me over to the Xbox camp was
2657120	2662400	really playing Forza Horizon was like a huge, you know, I was like, there just isn't a racing game
2662400	2668640	like this. This is huge. So, and crystal skies in chat points out Forza Horizon still has a massive
2668640	2673840	dedicated fan base. And by the way, shout out you guys, I, since we're recording a podcast,
2673840	2678080	you know what, but you guys have a hype train going in chat and I just, I just want to say
2678080	2682480	thank you. I'm sorry. You know, since we're recording this show, I don't like to do the
2682480	2685840	usual Twitch thing of, of doing all the shout outs in the middle of the show, cause it kind
2685840	2691680	of disrupts the flow of the podcast, but I just, your generosity is so kind. So thank you guys so
2691680	2695120	much. I really appreciate all of you. Thank you for being here on Sunday night. I appreciate it.
2695760	2702480	Um, Mike, I really like this mural. Oh yeah. Mike Defton chat called out. It is a Farid Rueda. I
2702480	2705840	hope I said that name right. Uh, who did that mural? Yeah. It's a cool mirror. It looks like
2705840	2709520	something you'd see on a, uh, like in the wide open walls downtown, doesn't it? Especially
2709520	2714880	because it's a bear in California is really big on bears. It makes me think of some of the murals
2714880	2721920	I've seen in parts of, uh, Oakland. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, yeah, that stole the whole damn show
2721920	2728880	to me was that Forza Horizon, but right before Forza Horizon came up was that Microsoft flight
2728880	2738800	simulator on Xbox and who that was gorgeous. I mean that we, it's, it's, we already know that
2738800	2742400	game is gorgeous. Like, you know, it's already been out on PC and it's kind of like, if you,
2742400	2745600	if you watch people stream that game, you've played it yourself. It's like, we, we've been
2745600	2751040	new. We knew that game was gorgeous, but to see it on the series X, you know, a platform that's
2751040	2756960	really optimized for gaming and to just look, I mean, Oh my God, dark soccer, bring up that
2756960	2762560	trailer too, because never in my life, 20 years ago, I would have never thought like I'm into
2762560	2770400	flight Sims, but like, I actually had been watching that one and you want to know, honestly,
2770400	2775040	the first thing that popped into my head and you're going to laugh your ass off about this
2775040	2781280	is I was thinking of a Soren from Disneyland. Oh, Oh my God. Kinda. You do kind of get that
2781280	2785920	vibe from a trailer like that, right? I totally got that vibe down to the music and everything,
2785920	2792080	but it is really, it is really pretty. Um, all the various different kinds of planes now I probably,
2792080	2798720	well, there's a Top Gun reference of course. Um, I mean, I probably wouldn't play it,
2798720	2804720	but I would watch people play it. Does that make sense? Yeah. Well, yes, especially how you've,
2804720	2810400	you've turned into quite the Twitch person this past three months, ever since you discovered
2810400	2815600	the Dead by Daylight community. And it's like queer people playing horror games, my home,
2816800	2822240	right? Am I wrong? Well, no, I was just like, well, honestly, like what got me
2823120	2831280	into that was, um, my friend, uh, sweet Nika. And then I discovered the rest of the community
2831280	2836720	around it and I'm like, Ooh, I like these people and I like this game and I suck at it,
2836720	2844480	but I'm getting better. And yeah. So anyway, um, anyway, um, yes. So you brought up the Top Gun
2844480	2848800	thing that was actually, um, there's, it's like, it looks like a free exp, no, maybe not free. I
2848800	2854240	don't know, but it's free. Oh shit. So like a free expansion to flight simulator that they're
2854240	2860480	actually, you can fly the fricking planes from Top Gun and all that. So I tie in with the new movie.
2860480	2865760	Oh yeah. For sure. For sure. But it's, it's still, it's like how it went in F 15 Tomcat.
2865760	2871760	Yeah. How completely unnecessary, but awesome. Right. As long as, as long as we get like the
2871760	2877040	Top Gun soundtrack in there as well. Yes. That remix was great. Bobby, like the minute Bobby
2877040	2882560	heard that bong that starts right there. He's like, it's Top Gun. Holy shit. It's Top Gun.
2885760	2889280	Yeah. Right now we just need like Kenny Loggins on the soundtrack.
2890480	2897440	Um, but no, for me, all I need, just the thing I do not want, please do not have the refueling
2897440	2902800	plane in flight simulator. No, no, no, no. And if you don't know what I'm talking about,
2903360	2909120	go back to the NES Top Gun game, which was amazing. Like for back in the day on the NES,
2909120	2915600	the Top Gun game was the shit. That game was awesome. The only thing cooler than the Top Gun
2915600	2922880	video game was the Top Gun ride at Six Flags Great America in the Bay Area. Yeah. But Rob,
2924000	2928560	it honestly, okay. I'm going to, I'm going to admit something to you. Okay. I had the
2928640	2940240	how to win at video games, VHS tape, and it had how to do the refuel thing perfectly every time.
2940240	2947040	Wow. I could never get it. I could never get it. Once you have like the pitch and everything,
2947040	2953680	it actually isn't that hard to get your plane there. If you do the same one every time.
2953680	2959040	It's just interesting. But honestly though, After Burner was better.
2961760	2966720	Always saying it. A Sega fan till the very end. A Sega fan till the very end. No, keep in mind,
2966720	2974080	I grew up with Nintendo and Super Nintendo. Dan's the Sega guy. I know. But stepping back now,
2974640	2981360	I can say this, After Burner is a better game because no refueling and it's a lot more fast
2981360	2986880	paced. The Top Gun was no slouch. All right. It was no slouch. No. All right.
2986880	2990720	After Burner had better music. But the two, I got to say, aside from those though,
2990720	2994160	there was some other smaller stuff that looked pretty awesome. Like Replace,
2995120	3000880	that pixel art kind of like, I don't even know. It just looks amazing. Just the artwork in that
3000880	3007600	is such amazing work. I need to try it. And then Atomic Heart, which kind of looked like a
3007600	3014160	Soviet version of Fallout, looked just crazy. So I'm gonna check those out.
3014160	3018080	I just have to shout out the chatters one more time because that hype train got all the way to
3018080	3023920	level five. They beat the final boss of the hype train. There's no more levels to the hype train.
3023920	3028880	They got it all the way. They defeated the hype train much like Final Fantasy VI.
3028880	3034560	They suplexed that hype train. Absolutely. Thank you guys so much. Thank you to all of
3034640	3038640	you who participated with that. Thank you. Thank you. Another game that just is really
3038640	3043040	pretty to me, although I don't know if I'm going to play it though, is Out of Worlds.
3044320	3049440	You must watch the trailer. The narration. Okay. The narration. Well, listen to it too,
3049440	3054640	because the narration is funny as hell. But yes, it looks good too. I thought it was Fable at first
3054640	3059440	until there was Space Aliens. I was like, wait, this can't be Fable. What if they did like
3060080	3066480	Fable alien version? I'd be into it, but they need to give us Fable the regular version first,
3066480	3073840	which we haven't seen yet. We need more Fable. You should really play Out of Worlds. I hear it's
3073840	3078080	really good. Oh, I played a little bit of it and it is really fun. And it's just one of those again,
3078080	3082320	you know, then I got distracted by something shiny and didn't go back and finish it,
3082320	3086640	but I need to. I really do. Let's talk about some of the other announcements of the Microsoft
3086640	3091600	Bethesda event. I think a big one we have to mention. Starfield. So we kind of got the first
3091600	3097520	look at Starfield, although they didn't really show the game. So I still am not really like,
3097520	3103840	okay, it's space. We knew that. But I will say like, not to sound like low on it, because when
3103840	3109440	I was watching the trailer, I was like, the level of graphical detail in this game is amazing.
3109440	3114480	You know, there was really paying attention to detail. And maybe that's why this game is taking
3114480	3118640	so fucking long, which is fine, is that they're paying such attention to detail. But we did
3118640	3122960	finally get the date. It's going to be 11-11-22, which is cute, because that's, you know, what,
3122960	3128880	11 years after Skyrim, right? So it's going to be then. And they did confirm, they put an end to
3128880	3135200	this whole, are they or are they? It is Xbox exclusive. So none for you, PlayStation, which,
3136480	3141520	you know, is an expected move on Microsoft's part. They got to do it to kind of counter
3142320	3147280	the Horizon Zero Dawns and the, you know, God of Wars of the world. They had to do something
3147840	3151600	of their own. But unfortunately, we didn't really get to see gameplay. And so I'm like,
3151600	3157760	is it Skyrim in space? Is it? What is it? So unfortunately, that part was still kind of
3157760	3162240	missing for me. But hopefully we'll see more. At least we know, okay, we got about a year and a
3162240	3166880	half to go. So we'll probably see way more about it at the next E3, that's for sure.
3167600	3169360	So it's no man's mass effect.
3170160	3174560	Hey, you know, I love this. You know, I love the space games. So that's why I'm already,
3174560	3181600	you know, yeah, you joke, but that that game already has me on it. Exactly. Let's see some
3181600	3186800	of the other things to mention. So they closed with an interesting game. Let's talk about the
3186800	3192960	actual closing of it because I saw some comments in chat. So they closed with a game called Redfall
3193680	3200560	that was a like co op open world game, if I remember right. And it looks a lot like a
3201200	3205440	zombie Left 4 Dead type of thing, except it's not zombies. It's vampires.
3207040	3213520	So it's a vampire shooter game. Now, here's the thing. I liked it. I liked that it was a,
3213520	3218720	you know, diverse roster of characters that looked very like they all had very big personalities
3219280	3222400	that look like a lot of fun. I felt like I was watching
3222400	3228160	like a good Netflix anime type of thing. But the problem was, where's the game?
3231520	3234400	They're just trying to build hype. I know, but it's, you know, and that's,
3235360	3240080	it's it's hard because I just I'm kind of where's the game? What am I supposed to get hyped about?
3240080	3245520	Because we're all old enough to know that isn't what the game really looks like. So look, I get
3245760	3252800	from a concept level, okay, they sold it. And my brain goes way back to when Blizzard first teased
3252800	3258480	Overwatch. They had their epic cinematic, right? And that was really to sell the universe,
3258480	3262720	this brand new IP that they're putting out. And they really did a kick ass job of it. But they
3262720	3266480	immediately followed it up with, oh, and this game is playable on the show floor at Blizzcon.
3266480	3270400	So people knew like that it was going to be like a Team Fortress-esque type of game right off the
3270400	3275280	bat. We don't really know what this game is. And that's the only problem I really had with it,
3275360	3280720	especially as a closer. I was just kind of surprised, like a new IP that you're not
3280720	3286320	really showing us the game is the closer. It was just an interesting choice. I'm not saying like,
3286320	3291840	it was a choice fail. I'm not saying fail. I'm just like, I'm not, I would have probably just
3291840	3297440	maybe ended with the Forza Horizon 5, but, or see, I'm kind of like maybe the Starfield thing,
3297440	3301120	but then I think I would have had the same bitch is that they're not actually showing gameplay.
3301120	3308160	Why did they do that last? So I don't know. Um, choices. Yeah. Zen Monkey in chat says,
3308160	3312480	I loved it. We'll see the game early next year. It's Borderlands with vampires set in the present
3312480	3316640	day. Yeah. And again, I'm not trying to shit on people that did enjoy it. That's great. I mean,
3316640	3321040	that's what it's trying to do is build hype, get you into this. But for me, I'm just like,
3321040	3325440	where's the game, sis? I got to see like, what, like, and that's, that's when I'm going to know
3325440	3331280	if I'm like, Ooh, I'm into this or I don't know. It looks a little, not my type of thing. Like
3331280	3336160	kind of like stalker too. I'm like, this looks really pretty. Probably not the type of thing
3336160	3345200	I'm into, but it is on game pass. So, I mean, maybe I check it out that way. So, um, Questbuster
3345200	3350480	in chat says there's also vampire blood hunt based on the masquerade IP that's coming out this year,
3350480	3357120	a vampire battle royale. Yeah. I thought of that too. So definitely, um, zombies out with that's
3357120	3361440	old news. I mean, sure we have back for blood coming too, but zombies that's, that's the old
3361440	3366880	vampires. That's the hot shit. But here's my question. Do the vampires sparkle?
3368640	3375440	No, because they're real vampires. But sparkle dark Sakura. No.
3375440	3382320	All right. The answer is always no. What else from Microsoft's event do I need to mention,
3382320	3387360	Loki? Halo Infinite looks amazing. Oh yeah. Yeah. I guess I thought I touched on that a little bit.
3388240	3394240	Well, did they recover from what they showed last time, which was not well received? Absolutely.
3394240	3400160	Which for the record, I wasn't bothered by what I saw last time. I didn't think they had to make it.
3400160	3404320	Yeah. I just was like, okay, it's got a Halo one vibe. They're, they're doing a throwback thing,
3404320	3410080	but they really went out of their way to like show, like, look where the game's at now. It's
3410080	3414240	in a very different place. So, I mean, good for them. Uh, the only thing that was a little muddled
3414240	3418480	for me and maybe chat, you guys can help me clear this up. I don't understand what they meant when
3418480	3425360	they said episode one is out this holiday. Did they just mean the multiplayer episode one? Or
3425360	3430160	are they like dividing up the main game because it's not all going to be done yet. That was the
3430160	3434560	part that threw me a little bit. And I was like, they, that muddled the message for me big time.
3434560	3440320	I wish they hadn't done that, but otherwise multiplayer and then have the story campaign is
3440320	3447360	split up. Maybe, maybe, I don't know. So, uh, everybody in chat is still yelling about me
3447360	3452880	talking about sparkling vampires. Sorry about that. Uh, fifth dream does say infinite implies
3452880	3459040	game as a service. I E in pieces. Well, that is a fair point. Absolutely. But they also mentioned
3459040	3464800	it was a ship too, or their place or something. Yeah. Yeah. And so I'm kind of like, well,
3464800	3471840	what are they charging 60 bucks for then? I don't even, are they charging $60? Cause like,
3471840	3476240	we don't know what the price is yet. I guess that's true too. It could be $70. Well, but then
3476240	3480720	for a lot of people it's game pass. And that was kind of the thing that's kind of what I left with
3480720	3484720	on that as I was like, well, are they releasing part of the game or I was like, well, it doesn't
3484720	3489280	really matter. Cause I have game pass. So I'll just get whatever they put out again,
3489280	3494160	a lovely game pass commercial Microsoft put out today, a very lovely game pass commercial.
3494800	3501840	So, all right. Uh, pretty cool as well. Which one? I got a stock or two. I got it. Well,
3501840	3504480	I mean, it's pretty obvious cause it's pretty similar, but I got a very,
3505280	3508880	you know, Metro vibe from that, but I mean, it looks good.
3509120	3516560	Uh, Phoenix 77, 26 talking about the, uh, halo release says, I mean, look at FIFA Rob
3516560	3523040	and the shit that does for $60 USD. Uh, E3VL says $60 for campaign multiplayer live service
3523040	3526480	multiplayer is free to play. Yeah. I definitely caught that. And that's a great thing. And I
3526480	3529920	think we should all be thankful to go back to Phoenix's comment. We should all be thankful.
3529920	3539280	It's not an EA game. All right. So, all right. Uh, yeah. And Pele Hanumea says the plot to
3539280	3542400	infinite is where's Cortana. That sure looked like what they were kind of showing there,
3542400	3546800	but it looks really pretty everything that was there. So cool. All right. Anything else
3546800	3554160	from Microsoft before we move on to the next one? Okay. Let's move on. Let's talk about the last
3554160	3559520	one that I watched today and that was a square Enix's event. Um, Oh yeah. Let's talk about some
3559520	3570080	fucking choices. Jesus. Like, I'm kind of excited about the pixel remaster. I'm not, I'm, I'm
3570080	3574080	pissed about it. I'm, I'm straight up pissed about it. I'm going to tell you why it was the very end
3574080	3579120	of the trailer that said coming for steam and mobile. And do you guys not have phones?
3580720	3586800	Here's the thing. When's and square's done this before when they put games out on steam that are
3586800	3592880	just mobile ports, they're terrible. And look, I'm sorry. Final fantasy is not, especially the
3592880	3598080	classic games are not meant to be played on mobile. Like I'm fine with RPGs that are created
3598080	3602800	for the mobile space with the touch controller and all that in mind. Case in point, Fantasian.
3602800	3608160	Great. That is good. Yeah. And that is like the final fantasy esque thing for mobile. I'm thrilled
3608160	3612880	that exists and I want to play it at some point. I don't need final fantasy six shoe horn on a
3612880	3619680	fucking mobile phone again. Like I just, that's what's irritating me about it. I, I'm not looking
3619680	3625200	at it the same way. I'm looking at it with hopefully having that same sort of control
3625200	3632560	like Fantasian does. And if so, I'd be super happy with it. You know what I wanted, I want to be able
3632560	3639920	to play it on my Mac. I'm, I'm happy to be proved wrong and it ends up being okay. But I just, I
3639920	3645840	guess I'm disappointed. It's not like on the switch. Which seems to be the perfect place for
3645840	3651040	something like that. And then I actually have my controller and I can play it like, and, and just
3651040	3655920	to package just like final fantasy one and two from game boy advance. I don't know what they
3655920	3659840	would do for three. I guess they could do a new translation of that or whatever that that's going
3659840	3664000	to be the most interesting release is final fantasy three, in my opinion, because keep in mind,
3664000	3668240	we've only ever gotten that game in the 3d remake localized. So it's going to be interesting that
3668240	3673040	that's the most interesting one to me. And if I buy any of them, it'll be that one. And then,
3673040	3678240	you know, four had a great version on PSP and so on. So it's not like it's not the pixel remaster
3678240	3683840	part that bothers me. It's just the whole fact that if they're aiming for mobile, I'm, I'm not
3683840	3689920	sure I'm into it. But we do still have Nintendo's event on Tuesday. And they could end up announcing
3689920	3693840	it again. And it's coming to switch as well. Although I'm trying to be a realist about that.
3693840	3699040	And I realized that is probably not going to happen. But I just like I was so kicked in the
3699040	3704400	gut after that, that I just, I almost like tuned out the rest of the Square Enix thing. I was just
3704400	3713360	like, I just, why? But anyway, so there was some other stuff. The Guardians of the Galaxy game. So
3713360	3718560	Dark Soccer, you brought this up earlier. They spent a lot of time on it a lot, a lot of time
3718560	3723600	on that Guardians of the Galaxy game. But I thought I thought it looked decent. And
3723600	3729360	I liked it. It's based more off the comic look. Yeah. Yeah. Shane had a great tweet about it.
3729360	3733600	He tweeted something like, Hey, since a Star Lord doesn't look like Chris Pratt at all,
3733600	3737040	I'm kind of into this. Yeah, I thought it was funny.
3738880	3743680	It's I like that Gamora looks like she does in the comics.
3744080	3747680	Yeah. Yeah, they all do. I think that you can only play Star Lord.
3750240	3755680	As far as we know, I'm sure there'll be DLC or something, but who knows? But a lot of people
3755680	3760240	were right off the bat kind of boxing that. Well, I don't say boxing it in, but throwing it in,
3760240	3767200	sorting it in with the Avengers game. And it's important to note Avengers was done by a different
3767200	3773040	studio. So this Guardians of the Galaxy is coming from Eidos Montreal. So it is being developed in
3773040	3778560	a different place. So I and they were very big to say at the beginning, this is a single player
3778560	3783200	game, or at least has a single player experience. So they were trying to kind of differentiate it
3783200	3790480	from the beginning from what you might see with the Avengers or what have you. Alan bought me a
3790480	3795680	present. Look at this. Look at this from Target. Thank you, Alan. Can you actually since you're
3795680	3799680	standing? I know you guys can't see I'll describe put it closer to the camera. Just so folks see it.
3799680	3805840	It's a little Street Fighter two mini machine. But that actually has like the full controller
3805840	3812160	with the six buttons. Yeah, right. All right. I need one of those. He got it at Target. But it's
3812160	3819120	I think wasn't it like $50? 50 bucks. But this is bucks. I can just play this. This is a little
3819120	3825520	more solid than the this is by far bigger than any of the other mini cabs I have. That's for sure.
3825520	3830080	Wow, this has a huge cord that goes with it, too. That's, that's something else. So there you go.
3830880	3835840	SG100 Matt says Alan loves me. Yeah, that's true. That's true. Thank you, Alan.
3838320	3842880	He did have to ask. Am I allowed to spend $50 on this for you? And I'm like, Well, if it's for me,
3842880	3850400	yeah. All right. All right. It does look good. That game looks pretty awesome. Yeah. So let's
3850400	3854800	see. Sorry. Sorry. I derailed us a little bit. But that's the joy of doing things live. So yeah,
3854800	3858880	Guardians of the Galaxy. I'm into it. I want to check it out. What else did they announce? They
3858880	3864720	had that what was the the Babylon? That was the game that was right after the final? Yeah, the
3864720	3869120	the thing that was right after the Final Fantasy news. So I was kind of seeing fall. Yeah. I mean,
3869120	3875520	it did look interesting, though. It's a platinum thing, right? Yeah. So I want to check out the
3875520	3879120	beta that game for sure. And then I think the other big thing they announced there was that
3879120	3883520	Final Fantasy origin. That whole thing had been rumored on various, you know, Twitter's social
3883520	3888400	media web forums for a little bit is that Final Fantasy is getting a Dark Souls esque type of
3888400	3893040	game because that is now all the rage apparently between things like Elden Ring. And now we've got
3893040	3898000	this coming as well as the Final Fantasy take on the Dark Souls. Although it appears to be
3898000	3902880	possibly something that's like a prequel to Final Fantasy one, because it's it's Final Fantasy
3902880	3908560	origin, not to be confused with Final Fantasy origins, a great PlayStation compilation of old
3908560	3914400	Final Fantasy games that were not done for mobile. But anyway, it's like it's a little too
3916080	3923920	Devil May Cry. Yeah, I think Team Ninja. So that reminded me a lot of like Ninja Gaiden or
3923920	3930800	something like that. Yeah, they're redos of Ninja Gaiden, but it's. I suppose it would be
3930800	3936160	interesting. I mean, it's in the universe, but, you know, I don't know. Well, I'm happy.
3936720	3940720	Go ahead. Well, I was just saying as much as I love Final Fantasy seven,
3940720	3947360	at least it's not a Final Fantasy seven universe. Yeah, and I'm I'm I'm glad they're doing a demo
3947360	3951040	to even if I don't have a PlayStation five. So I'm a little bit like sad that they don't have
3951040	3956560	a comparable thing on Series X right now, but at least they have a demo coming out so we can get
3956560	3960960	a better sense of, you know, what is this game? And that does show that they really believe in it.
3960960	3966640	You know, to put out a demo can really make or break your entire game. And especially if you're
3966640	3971680	Square Enix, Square Enix knows this better than anyone right now. Hello, Balan Wonderland, right?
3971680	3977440	A demo can make or break your entire game. Although, you know, then there was also Ni No
3977440	3981280	Kuni, which had a terrible demo, but the game turned out okay. But I digress. But the fact
3981280	3984480	that they're putting it out there and actually having a demo that's playable, I think is pretty
3984480	3990160	interesting. So I want to check. I'm sure somebody will stream that demo or it'll be on YouTube.
3990160	3996400	So I can at least get a sense of like what it's all about that way. So it'll be interesting. I'm
3996400	4000880	curious about it. I'm willing to give it a shot. Let's put it that way. Because it does seem like
4000880	4004880	Final Fantasy wants a franchise out of this because the name of the game is not Final Fantasy
4004880	4010400	Origin. The name of the game is something else that escapes me in the moment. It had a different
4010400	4014720	title. Rangers of Paradise. Thank you. Stranger of Paradise. Stranger of Paradise,
4014720	4019840	Final Fantasy Origin. So ending though on that trailer, though, did kind of give me a little
4019840	4025840	bit of a chill. How so? Just with Garland. Yeah, true. True. I mean, I saw it coming,
4025840	4032080	but at the same time was just like, hey, I like it. I can't wait for the sequel, though. Stranger
4032080	4038640	of Paradise, Chocoba Racing Origin. It's going to be amazing. I hope so. I hope so. A Souls-like
4038640	4045200	Chocoba Racing game. I think many folks probably surprised. No updates on Final Fantasy 16.
4046160	4050960	No. So I guess that'll be ready when it's ready. I mean, I don't think any of us were anticipating
4050960	4057520	it this year anyway. So maybe they just would rather keep. I guess that super cut at the very
4057520	4062560	end of the Square Enix thing might have had like two seconds of new footage of Final Fantasy 16.
4062560	4068480	But otherwise, they didn't really have an update on it. So, you know, which all right,
4068480	4071840	if it's not ready, it's not ready. And we're probably not seeing it till next year,
4071840	4076320	realistically anyway. So, but I was a little surprised there wasn't an update because it's
4076320	4083760	such a tentpole title for Square Enix, but okay. I mean, they did Creative Unit 3 did just have
4083760	4088960	their Final Fantasy 14 showcase a few weeks ago. So maybe they just weren't ready to talk about 16
4088960	4097600	right away. I don't know, whatever. So, no. All right. Well, there were other things that weren't
4097600	4102960	in the big batches. Yeah. Anything else you want to shout out here before we get to predictions or
4102960	4108320	whatever? The Among Us stuff is kind of cute. Oh yeah. Well, that was in the Microsoft thing.
4109200	4114560	Was it? I didn't notice. Actually, I think it was in the Microsoft and Summer Game Fest. You know,
4114560	4119360	that game is still huge. What was your take on all that? Well, just the, I mean, it's not,
4119360	4123920	I think it would be nicer, especially with all the streamers that I watched it play a lot of
4123920	4131120	Among Us. It definitely allows for more friends to get together and have fun being totally sus.
4132720	4136880	The colors though were interesting. Like I'm totally into the maroon.
4138880	4142720	Yeah. And the expansion to 15 players, right? Cause that, the 10 is the old.
4142720	4146720	That's what I was just saying about the 15. Being able to play with more people.
4146720	4150320	Oh, and of course the Jeff outfit, the Jeff Keeley outfit. That was the big thing.
4150800	4158640	Yeah. That return. Yes, there is that. But I mean, this, the game itself was sort of like,
4159520	4163840	it took a little bit of time for it to really take off and now it's super taken off.
4164560	4171760	And I think that it's just, I mean, just another thing for the power of the internet, you know?
4173760	4178080	For sure. That's how I look at it. Any other games you want to shout out?
4178720	4182000	You or Loki before we, yeah. No.
4182000	4185040	Okay. I didn't watch this, so no. All right.
4185040	4191120	I mean, totally, totally not part of, part of the thing, but we get our new Dead by Daylight DLC
4191120	4196320	soon and I'm kind of quaking for it. Yeah, that'll be exciting. That's for sure.
4196320	4202880	So, yes. Yeah. Well, I know we have a Dead by Daylight story coming up later and what was
4202880	4207520	diverting your attention today, but we'll get into that a little later. For now, let's talk about the
4207520	4211440	upcoming week because we are right in the middle of things. So we're taping this on Sunday night.
4211440	4215280	So by the time some of you are listening to this podcast, we may actually have more details on
4215280	4219200	things that we didn't know about at the time we were taping this. And certainly one of the big
4219200	4224320	things, you know, if you're listening to this after Tuesday, Nintendo will have had their direct
4224320	4229920	Tuesday morning. And, you know, the bar is set pretty high for Nintendo, I think. There's a lot,
4229920	4236160	you know, and probably mistakenly so by a lot of people. There's this weird ass rumor going
4236160	4242640	around right now about the whole GameStop ad that says New Nintendo Switch when I,
4244240	4248800	I'm going to be, I'm going to be completely, I'm just gonna say it. Consider the source on that,
4248800	4253920	which is one of the most clickbaity game journalists I've ever seen in my life.
4253920	4256560	And we don't have to drag him in chat if you know what I'm talking about.
4258240	4263280	I just, I think it's one of the most clickbaity people I've ever seen in my life. And if you look
4263280	4268160	on that ad that they're like, oh, it said the New Nintendo Switch. It literally says the promotion
4268160	4272480	starts today. So if there was a New Nintendo Switch, I think we would have known about it
4272480	4280640	today. So I think they meant new as in not used or new as in the remake that has the better battery,
4280640	4285200	because even the picture was still the old Nintendo Switch. So I don't, I don't know what,
4285200	4289520	I think they're making something out of nothing, which is what clickbait journalists do. So,
4289600	4295280	whatever. Anyhow, and Nintendo has said they're not announcing hardware. Like they said very
4295280	4300240	plainly, it's 40 minutes of software. And I really do think there is the potential that they delayed
4300240	4304160	the hardware suddenly to next year when they realized they would not be able to make enough.
4305280	4309040	For a change, Nintendo probably made the right decision in that aspect.
4309040	4314800	But let's talk about the software that we might see from Nintendo. You know, huge, if we want to
4314800	4320800	believe rumors, although in my opinion, a lot of Nintendo rumors are kind of all bullshit right
4320800	4324960	now because that New Nintendo thing is not playing out. So I don't know how much stock I put in this
4324960	4331600	whole 2D Metroid thing that supposedly is what we're going to see. I would, don't get me wrong,
4331600	4335680	I would fucking love it. But I'm not going to, I'm not going to set that bar and just get
4335680	4342000	disappointed. So if it happens, yay. I would also be yay just with a simple Metroid Prime 4 update.
4342000	4346080	And even if they also date it for 2022, I'm fine with that. And because that's probably
4346080	4354160	how long it's going to take, honestly. So, but 40 minutes is a lot for Nintendo.
4354160	4354960	That's a lot of time.
4354960	4356080	That is a lot of time.
4357360	4365040	Well, and they, I have a feeling they are going to unveil something big and do a deep dive.
4365920	4371840	Um, because look at things like Game Builder Garage or some of the other recent stuff this
4371840	4376800	year. Nintendo is announcing things with a six week lead time. So it is very, and this is,
4376800	4381600	I think what's realistic. If whether it's a 2D Metroid or something else, I think Nintendo
4381600	4386640	will announce like a Labor Day game and give us a deep dive on it, on why we're all going
4386640	4390880	to pre-order it today. So we'll, we'll see. We'll see what happens with that.
4391440	4397120	Um, some folks in chat E3VL says, I just want a Breath of the Wild 2 gameplay trailer. Dark
4397120	4400880	Tetsuya says, yeah, I'd love to see more on Breath of the Wild 2. Um, big same, you know,
4400880	4404640	I have strong feelings on that. I think Nintendo really needs to put up or shut up on that.
4404640	4408400	And yes, I know at the end of the day, it's not going to change sales whatsoever. They can,
4408400	4414160	they can do whatever they want, but I just, it's like, come on. Like, you know, where it,
4414160	4420240	give the fans something, like it just starts to feel like they don't care about fans when they,
4420240	4424560	when they go so long without even like just a hint of information. It's just,
4425280	4432080	yeah, a lot to me. Uh, SheHulk10 in chat says, I need Donkey Kong. I could see that as well
4432080	4437680	as like a surprise Labor Day release. I think something like that, like a Donkey Kong, uh,
4437680	4441840	in the style of Tropical Freeze and that whole thing. I think a Donkey Kong game like that
4441840	4446160	coming out Labor Day, like a six week lead time and they do a deep dive on it. I think that is,
4446160	4450240	I think that is a realistic prediction, but it is a prediction for sure.
4450240	4456080	I would just like to see something. It'd be nice for like a new Mario Kart. I think it'd be,
4456080	4460080	I mean, it's really, it's been a while since we've had any Mario Kart game since the last
4460080	4464720	one that they released was on the Wii U. Not counting the world or the camera game,
4464720	4470880	the AR game. That was, that was its own thing. That was, that was, yeah, I think you have to,
4470880	4475360	but you know, you know, they're going to say it. If I don't say we had the, the, the AR game,
4475360	4478320	they're going to say, we just got a Mario game last year, Loki.
4478320	4482240	Yeah, that doesn't even count though. It's like, we have the mobile game too.
4482800	4488720	That I would think counted more than the AR game. Like I think I've learned my lesson with not
4488720	4495280	buying any more AR things from them. Like it just, it just doesn't get used at all. Um,
4497920	4501760	I don't know. We'll see. I'm not, I don't have high expectations
4502560	4505200	because, you know, if you do that, you're just gonna get disappointed.
4505200	4508880	Yeah, I understand. I just hope there's a couple of nice things that are like,
4508880	4514880	we're going to release it today. Cause I love that stuff. I love this. Maybe another 99 game,
4514880	4520000	even though they just did the Pac-Man one, but I would, I would be all about like a new 99 game.
4520000	4525280	I think that would be fun. Um, but you know, I I'm, I'm always, I would, I would love to see
4525280	4530000	the NES remix series come back. Um, another sleeper series I'd love to see come back.
4530320	4534800	And this one gets rumored a lot Wario where, where the hell's that been? I'd love to see
4534800	4540160	that come back on switch. Um, but again, I don't want to, you know, set the bar too crazy high
4540160	4547040	because it'll just be disappointment. So, um, She-Hulk 10 in chat says Nintendo needs
4547040	4553360	X-Box game pass streaming X-Box games. Oh, like an X cloud player. Um, I, you know,
4553360	4558400	I think there's a lot of people that would be so fucking hype if something like that happens.
4558400	4564000	But I, I, that, that is like, uh, that is one of those things where like, if we were betting
4564000	4569040	illegally on what would be announced, like that would be a high odd thing. That would be like a,
4569040	4574640	uh, 50 to one odds that something like that happens, you know, that's a, that's a stretch.
4574640	4580160	I don't know. Um, but it is interesting, isn't it? When Phil Spencer sits there and he has a
4580160	4585920	switch sitting behind him, it is. But for me, I'm like, well, that's just like, you know, that's,
4585920	4592320	um, Psychonauts 2 coming to switch. You know, I, I, I don't know if I'm willing to say,
4592320	4596240	it's going to be this X cloud thing, but it would, Holy shit, would that be amazing?
4596800	4603200	That would be, I'm sure he wouldn't say no. Microsoft doesn't have a portable system.
4604640	4610000	Nintendo would have the strength of Microsoft's library on their portable system, but is it worth
4610000	4614160	it to them? I don't know. I just, I there there's a lot of it where I'm like, it just,
4614800	4621280	I feel like that the fanboy want is outreach outweighing the realization of what is realistic
4621280	4627040	and good business sense, especially for a company like Nintendo. So I don't, I'm not willing to put
4627040	4631360	my heart too much into that rumor. I think it's rad as hell. I'd love it, but I just,
4631360	4636640	I think realistically it's not going to happen, but I, I will, I will sit here and happily eat
4636640	4641840	my words with a big old spoon on next week's show. I will happily do that. We'll just say that there's
4641840	4645840	no new Nintendo switch. And what they're doing instead is that, you know, game passes coming
4645840	4651600	to switch and Nintendo games are coming to the Xbox series X. There you go. Dream the fuck on
4651600	4657840	with that one. All right, let's move on. Let's talk about, okay. I think that was finally
4657840	4662080	everything like E3 and summer game fast and all that stuff. Let's talk about our gaming
4662080	4665840	weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week. I think dark soccer stepped
4665840	4668960	away cause her camera's off. So Loki, I'll start with you. How was your gaming week?
4669600	4676640	It was incredible. So this week, as I talked about last week, I actually recorded my streaming
4676640	4685520	session today with Tango from, from hermitcraft. So that was fun. We didn't really build a ton.
4685520	4689840	It was more of just kind of just sitting there and like chatting while we were just like trying
4689840	4696240	to place blocks. Cause like it's kind of silly. I brought them on and I'm like, so what I did
4697200	4699760	and this will be all into my video too when I, when I put it out.
4700880	4712800	So I had spent this entire week crafting a very immense redstone machine. So what it was is,
4712800	4720800	is this giant light board. It was that would scroll his logo across it and then freeze for
4720800	4726160	a second and then animate off. So it was like an animated like logo board thing. So I built that
4726720	4735280	creative, brought it back into the server and built it in survival there. And then what I had
4735280	4742000	planned to do, but I ran out of time was I was going to make a joke about how my gold farm
4742000	4746080	produces way too much gravel. So I was going to cover the whole thing in gravel and just like
4746800	4753200	kind of reveal it. There's a way you can kind of use scaffolding and stuff to drop gravel,
4753200	4758880	kind of like dropping a curtain or something like that. And so that was going to be the joke
4758880	4763840	is that, but instead I just showed it to him and what we were going to do is build the building
4763840	4770480	that was going to go around that. And so that's what we did. He's not much, he doesn't normally
4770480	4776640	do building so much. It's not like something he'll more like, you know, like making the redstone
4776640	4782480	systems and stuff like that. So we both kind of struggled like coming up, it was like
4783040	4790320	creative blockers and we're just like, so we ended up just kind of messing around for like,
4790880	4794320	you know, two hours or whatever. So I showed him around the server and everything, but yeah,
4794320	4798160	it was fun. I was picking his brain on like content creation stuff, his process and all that
4798720	4805520	and just like, you know, getting tips on, you know, stuff. And so it was fun. It was, it was
4805520	4811920	nice. And then at the end, you know, it was basically like, Hey, I want to, you know,
4811920	4817440	you know, we're going to stay friends on discord, you know, you know, send me, you know, show me
4817440	4821280	what, you know, once you've finished the build, send me a screenshot, you know, and, you know,
4821280	4824960	keep me up to date with what you're doing and stuff like that. So like, awesome. I think that's
4824960	4829280	cool. Like I really enjoyed that. That's kind of what I was trying to get out of it. So it, yeah,
4829840	4834560	it was really cool. That was very nervous. Oh my God. I've been up to like two in the morning,
4834560	4838240	the last two days, because I've been trying to like cram everything into this time,
4838240	4845040	but like, it was just, it was so worth it. So that was basically what I did this week. Like I said,
4845040	4850320	I will be making a video with it. I don't know when it's going to be out yet. Cause I have to,
4850320	4855360	I want to finish the build that we started. Cause we got like part of a wall and then there's,
4855360	4858160	there's some funny stuff with that too. Like I don't want to spoil it, but like,
4858160	4866400	um, it was pretty funny when we noticed something in the, in the, yeah, fun times are had, but, um,
4866400	4872160	so yeah, it's, um, uh, I'm very much looking forward to putting it out. I still want to,
4872160	4877920	you know, keep going with the content creation stuff. Um, yeah, just going to get better.
4877920	4881840	Each episode I put out learning more, just learning from my mistakes,
4881840	4885200	that type of thing. So yeah, that's pretty much that. That's it. I hope he gives your
4885280	4887920	video a shout too. I hope you get that exposure. It's going to be great.
4887920	4892080	That would be amazing. I don't have any expectations for that though.
4893440	4899840	I would love that, but I absolutely wouldn't expect that at all. It's more of just like,
4899840	4905520	that would be cool, but like absolutely no expectations though. That said, if you do follow,
4905520	4909520	um, the Hermitcraft stuff, I think the next season's coming very soon.
4909520	4915760	He sort of hinted at that, but like, um, there is, uh, one of the guys on there,
4915760	4920400	Ren dog, he put out his, uh, finale, which he edited together. He's a big Star Wars fan.
4920400	4924560	So his like built are all Star Wars theme. And so it's a great watch. He's like, did this big
4924560	4928720	old animated movie thing. So, um, that's worth checking out, but like, yeah, they're all great.
4928720	4933680	Like I just would, I would absolutely love that, but like that's so far in the future,
4933680	4937840	like that's so far in the future, but like, yeah, I, we had a great conversation about
4937840	4943040	pixel poops. Number two, that was fun. Oh, really? Oh, cool. He thought that was great.
4943040	4947840	Um, but yeah, yeah. Fun times. It was fun. I really enjoyed it.
4947840	4950240	Good, good, good. Happy to happy to hear it. Can't wait to see the video.
4950800	4953280	Um, dark soccer, let's go to you. How was your gaming week?
4954560	4957280	I actually did not play animal crossing at all.
4957840	4960240	But because you've played three times as much dead by daylight.
4961200	4969360	Um, maybe. Um, so yes, I have played a significant amount more of dead by daylight than
4969360	4976560	averaged than I usually do. Um, I've, I was supposed to start streaming on midnight Saturday,
4976560	4983200	which I guess would have technically been the night Sunday morning. But, um, I busted my hand
4983200	4990000	in a really stupid way. So I don't know those on stream can see them all wrapped up. I, um,
4990720	4996800	I banged my hand on the door knob in the bathroom chasing after Midna. Oh, because she's a brat.
4997760	5006720	And I, it kind of felt better, you know, like not as bad because I guess it had gone numb.
5007520	5012560	And then, um, Friday night I, I went into urgent care and they thought it was broken,
5012560	5018720	uh, like one of the carpels was broken, but it ended up being a bone bruise. So that was good.
5019280	5024640	And after resting it all day yesterday, I, I'm probably gonna be back to streaming tonight. Um,
5025440	5032160	but yeah, lots of dead by daylight. Um, I am working on learning new characters. I might
5032160	5040080	tackle Hagatha tonight. We'll see. Um, or I might tackle ghost face.
5040720	5044640	What do you think of the matchmaking they've been testing? Because, um, I know some of the
5044640	5049280	streamers I watch are kind of like, eh, but I gotta say like for me, like the matches I was,
5049280	5052880	I don't know if they're still doing it, but like the past couple of days I was playing the matches
5052880	5057600	I were getting were great. Like I was actually getting matched with people that were like around
5057600	5062880	my skill. Like I was playing a level one spirit to knock out some type of daily. And I actually
5062880	5067680	got a noob squad, which for me as a noob spirit, even if I was a level, what, like 13 killer or
5067680	5073760	whatever I am was, was great. And so I was very happy with that. So I, I hope that met for me.
5073760	5077280	I thought I was like, Oh, this new metric is great. I'm not getting the bully squad.
5078000	5084320	Yeah. Although I do have to say that beforehand, earlier in the week, I, I did, uh, sacrifice a
5084320	5088800	rank one survivor and that felt really good. Good job. Good. Congrats. Uh, Ninja, the monkey
5088800	5096320	and chat with my, my rank 17 self, uh, Ninja, the monkey and chat says, yeah, MMR has been awesome.
5096320	5102480	Oh, Stella. Hi, Stella. Kitty. You want to play dead by daylight? Kitty. Okay.
5103440	5113440	But anyway, um, I have, I've been vastly, um, enjoying myself with the, the MMR. Um, I really,
5114720	5121120	it's nice being able to level with the group that I'm playing with and actually find myself getting
5121120	5129120	better. Although I'm pretty sure that if I hit, um, what is it that's right before red? Is it
5129120	5135680	green or purple? Purple? Yeah. I think I would want to stay like right in the purples. Um,
5135680	5144000	if I make it that far. Um, but, but I did, uh, actually get the full plague outfit from the, uh,
5144000	5149920	the rift. Nice. But I'm not going to use the mask on it because I like seeing her face and
5149920	5157760	having her be pretty fair enough. And, um, I've been playing board scapes and, um, I'm addicted,
5157760	5163360	of course, because, you know, me, I'm a word nerd and it's turning right now. And for those
5163360	5171600	on stream who might see, I am level. I am ranked 10 on the tourney. So that makes me happy.
5172400	5178080	Even though it's like not worth anything. I like playing the stupid word game. Um,
5178080	5183760	I'm also playing Fantasia. Of course, that's my Tuesday night stream and I'm super enjoying
5183760	5190400	Fantasia. Um, the story is getting really good. Um, and for me pacing myself by playing just
5190400	5198320	little pieces of the story every week has made it kind of like tuning into a TV show a little bit.
5198320	5202800	I'm picking up the story like that. Fair. Some really, I'm really enjoying Fantasia.
5203680	5209360	All right. Anything else for your gaming week? Um, no. Um, my gaming week, I've been playing way
5209360	5213280	too much Final Fantasy 14. What else is new? I actually streamed on my own channel, I think twice
5213360	5219360	this week. Um, some Final Fantasy 14. Um, and my Ninja hit level 80. That didn't happen on stream.
5219360	5222960	I think that happened yesterday. I wasn't streaming. Uh, but yeah, so I, I got another,
5222960	5228240	another class to 80. So I only have, I think three more to go. Black Mage, Monk, Warrior,
5228240	5232880	I think is all I have that's left. So, um, that'll be, that'll be fun. I'm gonna work on that. That's
5232880	5240320	for sure. Um, and then, uh, let's see, what else did I check out? Um, I also have been playing Dead
5240320	5246480	by Daylight. Um, here's the crazy thing. Okay. So like, I got into Dead by Daylight to play Killer
5246480	5251120	because I was like, I don't know if I can play Survivor. The heartbeat stuff messes with me. I
5251120	5254640	don't know if I can do it, but then I just kind of like, I don't know. I was like, just get over it
5254640	5259680	and play Survivor. And I did. And I've been playing Survivor. I'm up to rank seven on Survivor.
5260400	5266320	Alan is not ranked seven. And I'm not saying that to rub it in, but I'm also saying it in a way to
5266320	5271680	be like, how did I do this? I don't deserve, I don't deserve it because like, I don't, I only
5271680	5277120	have Dwight's talents, Meg's talents. Those are the only two characters I've gotten to 40. And
5277120	5281040	then I have some of the stuff that's been in the Shrine of Secrets, like the, a couple of Bill
5281040	5285120	talents, um, and maybe one other Survivor talent I grabbed from there. The Bill talents are pretty
5285120	5290400	good. The Bill talents are very necessary, but, um, I have to throw this out here. Me who has never
5290400	5296080	played Survivor and has zero intent to play Survivor anytime soon. I bought Pebble.
5297760	5300320	That was the other talent that I got, was the Pebble. Yeah.
5300320	5302960	I had to buy Pebble just because.
5302960	5307360	Um, but, uh, yeah. So I've been, I've been working on leveling up my Survivors,
5307360	5310960	but I don't know how the hell I hit rank seven. I really don't. Um, because I'm,
5310960	5316480	I'm terrible at looping killers still. It's like my big weak spot, but I am pretty good at not
5316480	5323360	being found. That's where I'm, you know, uh, I I'm, I'm pretty good at the stealthy part of things.
5323360	5327680	Like I'm good at like working on a generator. Then like, as soon as like, I know the killer's close,
5327680	5333200	like crawling away around the wall and then out the window so that they can't see me, you know,
5333200	5338320	tiptoeing out the back doors. They can't see that I was there. Um, do you have David?
5339360	5341840	That's the character I'm working on now. So David is level 28.
5342400	5350560	Uh, you need, you need the no short cosmetic because I have an aesthetic game crush on dabs.
5350560	5356800	Yeah. He's, uh, and I call him dabs because he's British and that's a very valid nickname for David.
5357360	5362400	Um, but I've been getting random dailies. So I actually got Nia up to like six or seven because
5362400	5367040	I had two dailies for Nia. So I kind of had to do it. Um, and then I, I think I had somebody else.
5367040	5372320	I mean, the new entity. Yes. Yes. The new entity. Uh, so that's been my dead by daylight. I have
5372320	5378480	yet to stream that game, but I will, I will, I will break the seal on that soon. Uh, I just,
5379520	5383760	that will be when I play survivor. I will play with you. All right. All right. That'll be good.
5383760	5388960	I'm waiting for Jill. Well, I want to be, I want to be the totem bitch. So you're waiting
5388960	5396400	until Tuesday. Yeah. Pretty much maybe. Um, so yes, there's that. Uh, Ninja, the monkey says,
5396400	5401120	come play with us, Rob. I will, but please, please keep in mind I'm ranked seven, but I'm not good.
5401120	5406400	Okay. So as long as we all have that expectation, then yes, I'll play. It's fine. All right. Um,
5406400	5410640	let's see what else, uh, for my gaming week. Oh, I should talk about something new. So I played,
5410640	5418400	um, on Xbox series X fantasy star online to new Genesis came out this week. Um, and so I downloaded
5418400	5423680	that and I checked that out. I'm not very far into it where my opinions are really full fledged
5423680	5427840	right now. So I don't, I'm not going to really give you like these, this is my final thought.
5427840	5433280	It is also struggling a little bit with a lot of the things that every new MMO goes through. And
5433280	5439600	that is lag servers are getting hit crazy, you know, that sort of thing. So I'm, I'm going to
5439600	5443040	give them the benefit of the doubt and a little more time to work that stuff out, especially
5443040	5447680	cause the game is free. Um, this isn't like a game I paid $60 for like, you know, the mass effect
5448160	5454640	remaster, uh, where they're still patching it. Um, so, uh, yeah. Fantasy star online to new Genesis.
5454640	5460560	I do like that this, uh, the, the prologue that I've been playing, I think makes for a much better
5460560	5467200	tutorial than throwing 10,000 quests at you like original fantasy star online to does. Um, the only
5467200	5472080	downside I can really think of is that I tried to make a new character, man. There's some ugly
5472080	5476000	characters in that game. There's I could not make a good looking character. So I went, I,
5476000	5480720	you can import like your PSO two character and that's what I did. And that looked much better.
5480720	5485760	So, uh, yeah. So I was playing a little bit of that and, uh, I'll give you a more fully
5485760	5489680	real light cause I'm only like level four or five. So, and I feel like I'm still a tutorial,
5489680	5493920	so I don't really have full fledged opinions yet. Um, but that is a game I'm, I've been sinking a
5493920	5499600	little bit of time into. Um, although I lost a good 15, 20 minutes of progress because apparently
5499600	5504960	if you don't get to a certain point in the prologue, you roll all the way back to an
5504960	5509120	important story, story points that kind of irritated me, but it is what it is.
5509120	5515280	So that was my gaming week. All right. Uh, I know we usually do, uh, the gaming week at the top of
5515280	5519920	the show, but we had all of that, uh, you know, E3 and summer game Fest news that now we're to
5519920	5525040	the point of the show where we're going to get into this very familiar, lovely segment. Let's
5525040	5541920	do the bump. And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault
5541920	5547280	and pull out a classic and tell you about it. It's time for the classic game of the week.
5547280	5552720	But I believe dark soccer is putting a twist on it this week, right? Dark soccer.
5553600	5560880	I am. We're, we're doing this thing. All right. Tell us about it. It's a flag.
5560880	5567440	A flag. And here it is. What's the, uh, for those who don't know, flag is a fucking weird
5567440	5575600	arcade game. And I have picked a ticket spitter because it's fucking weird. The game is called
5575680	5580800	stinky feet. There's not really a whole lot to say, to say about this one. Um, you can have
5580800	5588160	either a single player mode or a four person mode, but basically you sit on a toilet seat
5588800	5593360	and you fire water. Oh, I didn't even see that there was a toilet seat you sat on because
5593360	5597200	whoever filmed this YouTube lovely put their finger over the lens. A little,
5597200	5604480	a little crazy anyway. Sorry. But anyway, you fire water at these people stinky ass feet
5604480	5609760	and these people are holding their own nose in the bathtub and you are shooting water at their,
5609760	5616720	at their stink ass feet while you're sitting on a toilet who puts their fucking toilet in front of
5616720	5626080	their tub. I mean, really, that's kind of stupid, but anyway, it's a stupid game. It's fucking weird
5626080	5637200	game and it's put out by, uh, Betson. Um, I believe, oh, maybe that's just who's, who's
5637200	5647760	trying to sell it, but, um, it's, it's just fucking weird. I have nothing else I can say
5647760	5651600	about it other than it's fucking weird. What Loki you sound like you have a comment on this.
5652560	5658240	I had to ask if you're sitting on a toilet seat and spraying something at feet, is it
5660880	5665600	is it dark? Sakura, the $10,000 question of the week. Is it P
5668240	5673600	bitch? Maybe I have to read the blurb though from this, so I'm just going to read it verbatim. Okay.
5674640	5681280	It's fun, exciting, different and simple. Gameplay that works. Stinky feet is a hilarious
5681440	5686640	multi target water race game that is great for all ages. And do you know how those feet got stinky?
5688400	5695360	Let me finish doing my cutesy announcer voice, please. Yes. Thank you. Follow the light pattern
5695360	5701360	to win. It has a unique bathtub theme. Every gun is a replica of a bathtub faucet and the seats
5701360	5710640	resemble toilets. You can also link five to 12 units. I don't know how many people
5714720	5718320	like a stinky family feet. Where do you come from? Resident evil seven.
5720720	5725440	All right. Um, let's get some of the comments on this segment from our chat room. Uh,
5725440	5731040	in no particular order, we have the heck what is happening? I need an adult. What the fuck?
5731040	5737600	Okay. Then I need an adult in all caps. I can't even carnival game. Good Lord. He, he, he,
5737600	5742560	and it's actually not water. It's light, but you pretend dark soccer. Your look is giving
5742560	5747760	me Kathy Griffin vibes. There you go. I am. Yeah, I think that's a compliment.
5748320	5753760	I can't go bad with that. No way. Although I am holding, I'll look at the camera cause I'm wearing
5753760	5760800	my ACE pride makeup. Um, and while she's doing that, uh, dark Tetsuya says didn't ever expect
5760800	5765040	flag of the month to go this way. Do you, do you know what this, do you know what the segment is?
5765840	5768960	Are you new here? Are you new here? Dark, dark Tetsuya.
5771440	5775760	It's called the fucking arcade game of the month. I almost did a game called shoot the poop,
5775760	5780800	but I'm not going to do that one. Uh, and VG realness who paid you the, uh,
5780800	5785840	Kathy Griffin compliment has a followed up with gorge in response to your makeup.
5785840	5790000	Thank you. How about that? All right. I'll send you some Oreos.
5791200	5796000	There it is. You're fucking weird arcade game of the month. That's a thing. Cause Canada doesn't
5796000	5800400	have the crazy flavors we do, right? That's for the record. I have to digress a little bit and
5800400	5810400	talk about these Thai Lay's chips that I got that are chestnut flavored. They're sweet. Oh wow.
5810960	5815840	Fucking delicious. Sounds good. I'll get you some. All right. Yeah. And I don't know what,
5815840	5819920	what kind of get you. I just remember I can't get you anything with peanut butter. Right. So,
5821280	5826400	um, there's a million flavors at the store. Lemon cream, I think right now. Oh yeah. Yeah.
5826960	5829280	Now they're getting the point where they're kind of cycling through the same flavors.
5829280	5833520	They won't really see new ones anymore. So yeah, but I don't think I ever sent you lemon,
5833520	5838640	so we'll have to work on that one. All right. Uh, my, I think a really good one right now is
5838640	5841440	that there's like a strawberry one. Is it strawberry donut or something like that?
5841440	5844960	It's a pretty good one. Yeah. It was like a strawberry donut one. I haven't tried that.
5844960	5849840	Okay. So I don't know. That might be gone by now, but anyway, uh, one thing I wanted to say,
5849840	5853200	by the way, before we get back into rapid fire news. So I was checking out while, um,
5853200	5856800	we, some of you guys were talking and doing the segment, I was checking out this arcade cabinet.
5856800	5861600	If you missed, uh, about 30 minutes ago, Alan brought in this mini, uh, Street Fighter two
5861600	5866960	arcade cab into the studio. And I was like, why does it have this giant ass wire to plug in?
5866960	5870080	Well, the deal is, and it's on the back of the box. I don't know if you can see it.
5870720	5875920	You can actually hook two of these machines together through the wire. Cause it's street
5875920	5882240	fighter. Right? So, and it only has one joy. So it actually has a link cable. It has a link cable,
5882240	5886560	like it's a fucking game boy. Oh my goodness. So you link the two machines together, right?
5887360	5893600	So there you go. I don't know if it's $50 worth of rad for a game that, you know, but it is,
5893600	5898400	it is bigger. So if you remember the mini cabs that are at my house, this is definitely bigger.
5898400	5902560	I don't know. Like they actually, they don't just have the screen, but they have that whole
5902560	5907040	decoration that shows all the world warriors like around it. So that's kind of, Oh, it's champion
5907040	5913600	edition. So I get to play the, uh, bosses too. That's kind of cool. Yeah. Wow. Head to head play
5913600	5918240	by linking two devices. I can't believe 20, 20, 21. And my husband just bought me a device with
5918240	5924800	the link cable. Love it. All right. Anyhow, uh, let's get into some rapid fire news. So believe
5924800	5928800	it or not, we had all of these announcements, announcements, announcements, uh, from digital
5928800	5932080	media events, but there were other things that happened in the industry too. Let's talk about
5932080	5935520	some of them pretty quickly here. Loki, I think you have a couple of quick, quick headlines,
5935520	5941760	right? Yes. Uh, so game builder garages have mentioned came out this week and they do have
5941760	5946720	a demo available on the switch. So if you want to check it out, you probably should do that.
5946720	5951520	Cause it looks pretty awesome. I have yet to recreate pixel hoops number two in it yet.
5952160	5961840	Um, but that may be coming because why not? Um, and then, um, well, yeah, hopefully you can
5961840	5966400	download the demo because they've had a recent firmware update that actually prevents, uh,
5966400	5975440	downloading games after the update. Um, there are some errors with it, but, um, I don't know if it's
5975440	5983680	a lot of systems that were affected by it, but, you know, hopefully they will be, um, getting
5983680	5989280	that updated soon. I think I saw Flaco tweeting about that. Oh, sorry. Flaco hope you're able to
5989280	5998480	fix it. Yeah. So, um, keep out, keep an eye out for that. And then, um, last but not least also,
5998480	6002480	there was some announcements during the summer games fest, um, talking about, you know,
6002480	6008080	Netflix series again that they have, um, the cuphead series don't deal with the devil
6008080	6013520	that Wayne Brady is going to be King dice in that, which I think is some pretty good casting
6013520	6019920	actually. Um, it looks interesting. So we'll check that out when that, uh, series eventually
6019920	6023760	hits Netflix. Yeah. That cuphead series looks pretty cool. I mean, which of course the game
6023760	6027280	has amazing art direction. It lends itself very well to a show like that. So it looked very,
6027280	6030880	very cool to me. Well, it's based off old cartoons. So it makes sense that, you know,
6030880	6035920	yeah, it looks like an old cartoon now. Exactly. A new old cartoon, uh, dark Sakura. How about
6035920	6043520	you? What do you have for us? Oh, a couple of things. Um, so, uh, oh my God, I just completely
6043520	6051360	lost where I was. So today there was a really, really fun dead by daylight tournament. Um,
6052080	6060720	it was called raft con. It was organized by, uh, hydro. Um, and, uh, it was just really,
6060720	6064800	really a lot of fun. It was all for charity. It was a raising money for the Trevor project,
6064800	6070960	which they exceeded $2,000. I want to say it was something like around 2100,
6070960	6075520	a little bit past that. Um, and it was really exciting. I mean, it was, I mean,
6075520	6080640	if you're into depth by daylight, that is, it was, there was some kind of real male biter moments.
6080640	6087920	Um, and, uh, it ended up, uh, killer side, uh, losing color one, which honestly, I don't think
6087920	6092800	anyone was really surprised about that one. He's, he's pretty hardcore. Awesome. A nurse.
6093440	6101440	I heard he had to do a pretty big match as hag though. Yes. So this one, well, it was the finals,
6101440	6107680	the start of the finals, which were two matches, uh, each, uh, the other one in the finals was,
6107680	6116240	uh, Laurie bird, who also was, uh, a nurse main. And, uh, they had, uh, Hawkins,
6117200	6122640	which is terrible for nurse, right? I mean, it's also terrible for a lot of people, but I digress.
6122640	6132080	Um, so losing color went, uh, the path of hag, which worked out great. And, uh,
6132720	6141040	Laurie bird went the path of twins that worked out not so great. Um, but the, uh, the survivor team
6141040	6150640	that one was, uh, the mod squad, which, um, honestly, everybody did such a good, uh, a good
6150640	6157760	job. Haslin's team did a really good job. I was really impressed by just the overall skill. And
6157760	6162800	this would be like, if I were better at the game, this is the kind of matches I would want to do
6162800	6170000	because they're just really engrossing and just really fun to participate in. And I, I, I had
6170000	6173760	a great time watching. I was really invested. I hope they put some of the highlights up on
6173760	6177680	YouTube. My only complaint, and I understand why they did it today because it's pride month and
6177680	6182000	everything, but my only complaint is that they chose the E three day to do it. And it's like,
6182000	6185200	there's all these big pressers and I've got, I've got to pay attention to them, right? I have
6185200	6188960	nothing to talk about tonight. Um, so I hope some of those matches are on YouTube because I'd still
6188960	6194960	love to be able to support it somehow. It was like 65 different, um, streamers involved in it.
6194960	6203200	And like some of the people who, I mean, I watch regularly, uh, mithril onion, um, a good streamer,
6203440	6211200	King Bay, you watch all 65. I don't watch all of them. Uh, are you sure I, again, you guys,
6211200	6217040	I cannot go in to a dead by daylight channel and not suddenly see dark soccer pipe up and chat.
6217040	6220560	I might even be like, who's this new person I've never watched before. Oh, this is an interesting
6220560	6225440	stream. And then all of a sudden dark soccer, OLR, like, hi, good play or whatever comment
6225440	6230240	she's making. I'm like, my God, she's everywhere. No, but I, I say that with love. You know,
6230240	6232960	I say that with absolute and total love. I love that you're so into it.
6233680	6237840	Well, I mean, but like a lot of the ones in here that are, that I'm like the most
6237840	6243520	hangout in would be like Kilcannon and King Bay and, uh, uh, Twilight King, Nick and Prince.
6243520	6249200	I mean, just really, but I was really impressed as far as the survivors go. And not just because
6249200	6256400	I really enjoy watching Le Pen and think he's a fantastic just person, but the way Le Pen did,
6256400	6262480	uh, Kate and was so good at hiding and not being found at all.
6262480	6264880	Ah, that's, that's, that's my style. Yeah. I love that.
6265440	6271280	Yeah. I was really impressed. Um, and still being able to, to participate with other,
6271280	6275200	you know, go to do rescues, do gens, do everything. So I was pretty impressed.
6275200	6278640	Dark soccer. Will you help me convince Chad Starsick to play the game already?
6281360	6283680	Well, it's on game pass. He can play it.
6283680	6289200	I I'm actually kind of floored that, that he's not.
6289200	6291520	Yeah, I know. I know. All right.
6292080	6295360	But anyway, um, the last thing I'm going to say about this is congrats to,
6295360	6301280	to everybody who participated. Thank you for doing such good work for charity and putting
6301280	6307280	on an amazing show. Thank you to Hydro for, for organizing everything. And I,
6307280	6314720	I really am just so impressed. I really love the way the communities come together for great cause.
6316000	6319520	Um, props to everybody. Yeah. A lot of names I recognize too.
6321200	6327600	The next thing is, is pertinent to my interest because her. So there's a new
6327600	6332160	Castlevania series that Netflix is going to release that stars Richter Belmont,
6332160	6336880	which makes me super happy because then it's all Dracula X, uh, stuff. So of course,
6337040	6343680	there's Maria Renard, um, who is, uh, his sister-in-law cause you know, he,
6343680	6349280	and well, and Richter is a descendant of Saifa and Trevor. I mean, cause all the rest of the
6349280	6358720	Belmonts are, so I am really hoping just the whole thing is, uh, Dracula X related. I mean,
6358720	6364960	I don't know if we're going to have little Maria, which would be funny cause they, um,
6365120	6370880	and of course the, all thing is, is during the French revolution as well. Um, but I'm just super,
6370880	6377840	super happy because Richter is my, my favorite Belmont and the Dracula X and Dracula XX
6377840	6382400	Nocturne in the Moonlight. Those are like two of my favorite games.
6384480	6389120	All right. Lots of good stuff, lots of good stuff in that Netflix event. That's for sure.
6389840	6394400	All right. Let's go travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out
6394400	6400160	this week in world release dates. Uh, Loki, I had one more thing to mention. My bad. Go for it.
6400160	6407840	Yeah. Cause I had forgotten to, um, it has been confirmed from a release by steel series. Um,
6408800	6414960	that for the resident evil chapter for dead by daylight, it has confirmed that, uh, there are
6414960	6423440	legendary, uh, cosmetics for Leon and Jill that will have, uh, uh, Chris, uh, and Claire.
6424320	6431920	Oh, cool. Yeah. So they, they are con it had been hinted before dbd leaks, uh, made a mention of it,
6432640	6438960	but, um, steel series, let the whole cat out of the bag that it's, uh, they're legendaries.
6438960	6444000	We'll get maybe, maybe Shane getting to play as Chris. Maybe we'll finally break them. Who knows?
6444000	6447440	And I'll just read it says the resident evil collection available via the end game store
6447440	6452640	includes two legendary sets for Leon and Jill that bring Chris and Claire Redfield into the fog.
6453680	6457600	Which version of Chris, apparently this is very important to Shane. I would imagine it's the re
6457600	6460960	two remake, right? Cause that's, that's what the nemesis are based off of. Right?
6461600	6469040	Well, I mean, Chris wasn't in re two, so it would probably be, um, I would reckon the first one,
6469040	6474800	but I mean, but keep in mind they're, they're going to do more and more cosmetics for it.
6474800	6482000	So I'm sure we would get a village Chris before too long. All right. So you can get your gruff
6482000	6492080	buff and a tough, uh, grizzled, uh, daddy, Chris. All right. I'm just going to call him daddy, Chris.
6492080	6497040	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. Uh, we'll start in the U S Loki.
6497680	6503360	It's a slow week. It was a huge week this last week. So yeah. And really,
6503360	6508720	we're only getting two games that are being ported over to the, um, the new gen systems.
6508720	6513760	So we've got, uh, the elder scrolls online. It's getting a dedicated PlayStation five and
6513760	6519280	Xbox series X version and Metro Exodus complete edition is also coming to PlayStation five and
6519280	6524480	Xbox series X. That's it. Uh, it looks a little light in Japan this week as well. Uh,
6524480	6530320	Japan is getting a game on the switch called Bakumatsu Orenka Shin segumi, uh, is out this
6530320	6536160	week. And I am not familiar with this franchise. It is from D three. Is that Shinsengumi? Uh, yeah.
6536160	6540960	All one word. Yeah. Yeah. So she's saying, uh, so it's a new, I think based off of a newer
6540960	6547040	anime series, I've seen some cosplay stuff out for it yet, but I mean, the Shinsengumi
6547040	6553120	was like a real group, like during the, the whole Meiji period. Um, and there's like,
6553120	6557440	they've been in like a bajillion anime, manga, comic books, just different iterations of
6557440	6561840	characters based on Shinsengumi. Looking at this description too, it looks like this is an older
6561840	6566000	release. That's kind of like a high res for the switch. So it's kind of like a rerelease for
6566000	6571040	switch because yeah, then when I look at the PlayStation four, it's pretty dry this week and
6571040	6577440	the PlayStation five in Japan this week, uh, that red controller, uh, is out. Uh, but that's really
6577440	6582160	it it's otherwise it's a very slow week in Japan as well. How about the UK dark soccer? Is any
6582160	6589040	different there? Eh, not really. Um, so what we have, oh gosh, I scrolled too far because, uh,
6589040	6595680	British States are a little bit different than how ours are listed. So, um, what we have is on
6595680	6603760	the 17th, we have rogue book for PC. On the 18th, we have Vader immortal, a star Wars VR series.
6604400	6612400	And, uh, that's about it. Excellent. All right. Uh, let's get a few more stories in here. Some
6612400	6617120	other things going on. Um, I guess this next story is kind of about E3, right Loki, but it's,
6617120	6623440	it's something everybody's talking about. It's really stupid. Um, it's, it, I, I think it's the
6623440	6631600	authentic E3 experience, but at home. So we've complained about E3 in the past and how you have
6631600	6636800	media credentials, but you're not really media because they're, you know, only going to let
6636800	6642560	certain media outlets look at this stuff. Well, that's what, um, the ESA is basically saying
6643440	6651200	regarding, uh, co-streaming some of the E3 events is that they have a short list of exclusive, uh,
6651760	6658400	well, basically folks that are approved to, you know, actually broadcast that stuff and that,
6658400	6664880	um, they don't really authorize anybody else to do it. I'm thinking that it could be that
6664880	6669520	they're white listing those so that they don't get copyright claimed, or maybe it could be just that,
6670320	6674400	you know, they want to be responsible for if you're co-streaming and you get,
6674400	6679840	you know, DMCA copyright claimed or something like that, but you can hold the ESA responsible,
6679840	6686400	like anyone would actually think to do that. But I don't know. To me, it seems like it's more of just
6686400	6694880	like, you know, they, um, they're being dicks. Well, E3 is just behind the curve. You get the
6694880	6699760	sense that the ESA is not run by people that are current on their technology. And that is very,
6699760	6704160	this is something I've called them out on before is that for the type of organization they are,
6704160	6707920	they should know their shit when it comes to technology. And it really feels like they don't.
6707920	6714240	And it's very frustrating because am I, am I, am I incorrect that they leaked more data again from
6714240	6720480	their registration database this time? I thought I heard that was the thing this year. Chat,
6720480	6726480	please feel free to jump in and help me recall. Um, yeah, I don't remember if that happened,
6726480	6730480	but they basically black compat says yes. And as she says, they did. That's what I thought.
6730480	6733040	And so it's one of those things where it's like, well, thank God, I didn't sign up to be your
6733040	6736640	partner to stream. Cause you would have just given out my address. You would have doxed me
6736640	6744000	in exchange. So it's like, I, the ESA just needs to grow the fuck up in a lot of ways. I know that
6744000	6749760	sounds very rude. Um, and yeah, it's rude. Um, because I think for what they're supposed to be
6749760	6754000	for this industry, it's very frustrating that they're just, they're lagging behind and all
6754000	6759600	these different ways. Like wake up, have you ever watched a Twitch stream ESA? Do you know what
6759600	6763680	co-streaming is? Here's, here's what they said. They made it, maybe they're walking it back a
6763680	6768480	little bit, but they said that basically that there was over 1300 submissions. They only
6768480	6775600	approved less than a hundred creators for the brands for official co-streaming. They said that
6775600	6780880	the, um, unauthorized streams are still welcome to co-stream, but it won't be in the official
6780880	6787200	capacity, whatever that means. So the, so it is less about being concerned about the DMCA and
6787200	6794080	more of them being dicks. I mean, that's really, they just completely made that clear is that.
6794720	6799360	I, I also, I also think it's ridiculous that like, you know, they had to have, okay. So like,
6799360	6803920	let's say the Square Enix thing was streamed on Twitch gaming, but they had to strip out all the
6803920	6808080	licensed music for the Twitch gaming thing because the musical industry might come after them
6808080	6814320	otherwise. Like we need to then stop putting, stop helping the music industry by putting licensed
6814320	6821360	music in trailers. Like I want to see the game industry fight the fuck back, like stop putting
6821360	6824480	licensed music in trailers, then fine. You don't want us to use your music. We won't use it.
6825280	6830480	And I, they need to push back on that stuff because it's ridiculous. Like what the music,
6830480	6834240	and, and I said this a little bit on Bobby show. I think the thing that pisses me off the most,
6834240	6837680	I swear to God, if I ever ran for public office, which I don't think I would ever do,
6837680	6843680	but, um, I, I, this would be the, I would ban these bot claims. I would say robots should not
6843680	6849440	be filing copyright claims. People should be filing copyright claims because that way you can
6849440	6854800	measure intent. And I think that's a huge part of what this is. Like, yes, if you're running a
6854800	6858560	stream where you're willfully just like playing music on demand and all this stuff, then you
6858560	6863920	probably should be stricken down and not be on Twitch. But you know what? Oh my God, I accidentally
6863920	6868480	played, you know, Grand Theft Auto and streamed like two seconds of a Guns N' Roses song or
6868480	6872400	something. Like you should not lose your whole fucking wellbeing online because something like
6872400	6877840	that. We need reform on this law. What do you think got me into making my own music?
6878160	6882960	We have a government that can't do shit right now. And it's so far like, I'm like, well,
6882960	6885200	we need the government to solve the copyright, but they're not going to.
6886080	6891760	No, this is, they're not going to, especially when it works out for them. I mean,
6892720	6897520	it's just, it's just stupid. Anyway. Um, let's see. Um, Chad starts again,
6897520	6900160	chat says stripping out the music from the guardians of the galaxy trailer would have
6900160	6905280	taken like 50% of the neatness away from it. Guess what? I saw it without any of the music
6905280	6911680	because I was watching on the, um, Twitch gaming thing. So I didn't see it with the music.
6911680	6917040	What they should do is replace all. They should have a database of really bad recorder
6917680	6927040	covers of all of these songs and just replace them all. Let's see. So, uh,
6927040	6931760	as she went into Matt is also clarifying what happened with the, the press information on the
6931760	6937200	press site for E3, you can search fellow press people and look at their profile that had their
6937200	6942160	personal info like phone numbers, personal emails, et cetera. Oh, cause I'm sure nobody
6942160	6948240	had their password as password one, two, three, or, you know, the, the, the answer to one of those
6948240	6952720	Facebook memes going around or something like, I'm sure, I'm sure your information was super safe.
6952720	6960560	It was, it was only available to other press. Um, black and Pat in chat says their initial
6960560	6965840	statement because I got the same email as Jeff was to beware and co-stream at your own risk
6965840	6970960	of terms of service violations on the platform you choose. And I would think that the ESA,
6970960	6977200	if they were an industry that is truly represents the gaming industry and gaming culture would be
6977200	6982720	pushing back on the music industry, or at least trying to come to some sort of agreement on this
6982720	6986000	so that we don't have to suffer, but the ESA doesn't give a fuck about us.
6986880	6990480	Hmm. And that's the reality. They care about their bottom line.
6991920	6998720	They care about the money that they can make and removing any form of it's all about control.
6998720	7004320	It really is about controlling the whole thing. Uh, and black and Pat says, as a result,
7004320	7010080	I canned co-streaming the Xbox briefing today for safety. Now on one hand, uh, Microsoft did
7010080	7013920	kind of give express permission on their own. However, that being said, I don't blame you.
7013920	7016880	I absolutely don't blame you. You don't want to take the risk. Why take the risk?
7016880	7020720	Especially when you we've just acknowledged earlier in the show, you've worked very hard
7020720	7025520	on your channel to this point where you're about to become a Twitch partner. If anybody
7025520	7028800	that looks at your application has a brain, you're going to be a Twitch partner.
7028800	7035920	And, um, you know, and this, this whole thing. And, uh, I like they, they, they lost you
7037040	7040960	beak out of this whole fear thing. And I think that's a, that's a, that's a really unfortunate
7040960	7045280	thing. Cause I know, I know you gals are big Xbox fans, you big, huge supporters of Microsoft,
7045280	7049680	uh, from day one, they, they really miss something by not having you co-stream today.
7049680	7054800	And it's because of, and it's not Microsoft's fault. It's not your fault. It's all this other
7054800	7058560	fuckery. And at the end of the day, you want to, you don't want to lose what you've built.
7058560	7065680	And I get that. I totally get that. Um, let's see, uh, tiger claw and chat says,
7065680	7069440	streaming the guardians of the galaxy game is going to be difficult due to the game having
7069440	7073920	licensed music. Won't you be able to, didn't they say something about a streamer safe mode
7073920	7077920	or am I, I might be thinking of a different game, but that is an interesting thing we're in now is
7077920	7082640	that games have to have streamer safe modes and two soundtracks. Because again, we can't work
7082640	7086080	our shit out with the music industry. You would think that they would just,
7086080	7090720	they would save money, not even having the licensed music in there. I know it compromises
7090720	7097360	their vision, I guess, but yeah, you can save money. They like to save money, right?
7097360	7107520	Yeah. Yeah. All right. Um, Phoenix 7726 says, I'm not saying boycotting E3 is a wise idea,
7107520	7111600	but well, it's going to be interesting to see what happens when they come back.
7111600	7119120	And let's, let's also keep in mind this week was not just about E3. We also had summer game fest.
7119120	7124960	We also had several independent things that were rising up. And, you know, obviously I said summer
7124960	7129360	game fest had some of its own issues, but there was also a lot of positives about that event.
7129360	7135840	And so maybe E3 is starting to get a little bit of competition. And I think that's a very good
7135840	7142400	thing at this point, to be honest. Yeah. Anyway. All right. Um, let's move on. Speaking of
7142400	7146480	Microsoft stuff, I think this is very exciting and something I'm kind of surprised they didn't really
7146480	7152960	talk a lot about, um, at the event today was they didn't really get into xCloud and how that's all
7152960	7156320	going to work or any of that, but I guess maybe they're going to save that for a special event or
7156320	7162640	something like that, but there are Xbox video gaming, video games, streaming sticks that are
7162640	7167840	going to be on the way. So a few days before the whole live event, uh, apparently some executives
7167840	7173520	sat down to talk about what's going on here. Uh, there was a little, uh, prerecorded media thing
7173520	7179760	between Phil Spencer and, uh, Stan Nadella, uh, who was talking about game pass and Azure and all
7179760	7185680	that, and then talked about how Xbox is working with TV manufacturers around the world to get
7185680	7190640	game pass on TVs, which makes a lot of sense. Um, I think PlayStation had a thing with some,
7190640	7196320	well, there is probably Sony TVs, but I think PlayStation was on some TVs like that whole, um,
7196320	7200320	is it placed? Yeah. PlayStation now I think it was on some TVs, but so it would make a lot of
7200320	7205200	sense that Xbox goes there too. Um, if you have game pass ultimate, you're going to have the cloud
7205200	7209840	ability. And so you'd be able to play Xbox titles with just a controller. So you have your Xbox
7209840	7214320	controller, you hook it up to the little streaming stick and bang. Now you have the cloud. I love
7214320	7219120	this idea because this means I'll be able to play video games in the bedroom, uh, from my series X
7219120	7223440	in the living room. I think this is great. I hope the sticks aren't too expensive, but I don't see
7223440	7227280	why they would be. So yeah, they're developing standalone streaming devices. You can plug into
7227280	7231920	your TV or monitor. So it sounds a lot like a Chromecast. Um, so I think this sounds awesome.
7232000	7236320	And I, I can't wait to check this out. So is this streaming from your Xbox
7236320	7243600	series X or is this just streaming through, uh, X cloud streaming from the web?
7243600	7251840	My understanding is both exist. Uh, and that, that I'm not sure which of the two it is here,
7251840	7257440	but I think you can choose which it is. I think one is called one thing and one is called the
7257440	7263040	other. I think when you're doing like Xbox cloud gaming and that, that is like in the cloud,
7263040	7267120	but when you're doing Xbox, I think there's something like play anywhere or something
7267120	7273760	like that. That's when you can play from your series X. Yeah. So we'll see, uh, dark soccer.
7273760	7281120	What do you have for us? Well, uh, hackers gonna hack and Steelers gonna steal. So, um,
7281120	7288000	they have stolen the source code to FIFA 2021 and EA's Frostbite engine.
7288000	7294000	You mean like FIFA 19? Yeah. Anyway, um,
7295520	7302880	on a few of the different, um, hacking forums, um, uh, it was found that they had taken
7302880	7312000	more than 780 gigabytes of data from EA. Um, and according to the screenshots that were shown,
7312000	7319120	it includes the source code for FIFA 2021 and, uh, source code and tools for the Frostbite game
7319120	7326320	engine. Um, and other assets look like different software development kits and they're trying to,
7326320	7334320	of course, sell these assets. Um, so they said that no data player data had been accessed,
7334320	7340400	so there's no risk to the player privacy, but, um, they've tried to plug up that whole really
7340400	7345200	quickly. Um, and of course, I mean, it's not the first time this has happened. Um,
7345200	7352720	CD project red got a ransomware attack earlier in the year. Um, and they eventually, uh, sold
7352720	7360880	the source code to that game too. Um, but now EA is saying that they're not going to be affected
7360880	7367280	the same way, but that remains to be seen. Well, I saw an article that it's like completely
7367280	7372080	speculative. I think it's more of like, I wish this would happen. Um, where they're saying that
7372080	7376480	they could dig through the source code for like, say FIFA or something like that, to see how
7376480	7382080	they use loot boxes and whatever to manipulate people into spending money on that stuff.
7382800	7388000	Expose them, basically, they're never going to do that. They're, they're in it for the ransom
7388000	7394800	and that's it. There's no white hat, white hat hackers in that group at all. I'm assuming.
7394800	7400160	Although if someone did want to say, pay for said source code, right.
7402000	7406400	And then use, use that knowledge for an altruistic purpose.
7406800	7407300	Maybe.
7408960	7410560	No, they're selling it for 28 million.
7411360	7412880	I don't have 28 million.
7412880	7416960	Well, especially with all the, um, you know, things that, especially with all the things
7416960	7421040	that EA kind of sells, like the FIFA cards and things like that, if somebody got the source code,
7421040	7426560	they could really exploit that. Um, I would think, and, uh, kind of build a black market
7426560	7430000	of fake stuff. You know what I mean? It could be very interesting.
7430000	7432560	Or maybe they could fix a mass effect Andromeda.
7433200	7434560	Isn't that the truth?
7435680	7437920	Anyhow, a few more stories for you guys.
7437920	7438420	Loki.
7439600	7445440	All right. So I've, I'm honestly not surprised at all. I'm surprised it took this long.
7445440	7450560	So we have a story about Roblox being sued by music publishers for $200 million
7450560	7455600	regarding, um, illegal use of songs from numerous artists.
7455600	7463200	I've seen so many games on Roblox that my kids play. They just have like all this licensed music,
7463200	7467280	just all over the place. Cause it's kid, kids making it a lot of times and they don't know.
7467280	7472720	They're just like, whatever, it's mine. I can put it in there. It's just, it's all over the place.
7472720	7479600	So apparently the national music publishers association is suing them, um, that they're
7479600	7483600	making hundreds of millions of dollars by requiring users to pay every time that they
7483600	7488400	upload music onto the platform or that they should be making, um, them pay that.
7488400	7493680	Um, so they said it points out some of the major artists affected Ariana Grande,
7493680	7499120	Imagine Dragons Deadmau5, it's, it's everything. It's everything. Seriously. It's, it's all over
7499120	7505760	the place. Like, and it's not even necessarily just music. It's IP as well. There's so much IP
7505760	7514080	theft on there. It's just, it's very unregulated. Well, it will be soon. Right?
7515200	7519440	That's a good way to do it. It's a wild west for right now, but that's going to be locked
7519440	7526240	down pretty fast. Teach the kids the lessons early. Unfortunately. Intellectual property
7526240	7530080	got to smack it down. This one, you know, it's funny, even though I was very critical of like
7530080	7533680	the music industry and needing to modernize a little bit ago, this one, I'm a little more
7533680	7537200	sympathetic to them on because there's the clear difference here is that a lot of these Roblox
7537200	7542640	add-ons are being sold, uh, for money and all that. So I kind of think, yeah, the music industry
7542640	7546880	kind of has a right to step, but I, again, I, maybe they're very frustrated and they're suing
7546880	7551440	all of Roblox because they can't bought it. They can't find this stuff through bots. So they're
7551440	7555760	just like, we're going to sue Roblox into oblivion. Well, this is exactly what happened
7555760	7562720	to YouTube. And so it's basically, if they don't have a process where it's regulated like this,
7562720	7566800	it's gonna, they're going to lock it down. It could be like Twitch where we end up seeing,
7566800	7571360	I don't think they're going to like ban you. I mean, they could ban users, I guess, but like,
7571360	7574800	I don't think it's going to, it's more of just like removing the offending content.
7574800	7578240	And a lot of the games out there that have like a lot of the slices of music thrown in,
7578240	7583040	it's just, they're like trash, but I don't think it's any like more of the popular games that are
7583040	7587680	doing this. It's more of just like all the trash that people make because anybody can make stuff
7587680	7593680	and post games on Roblox. It's just kids that do that just think, oh, well,
7593680	7597040	I'm going to go to YouTube and I'm going to steal the sound effect, or I'm going to go to YouTube
7597040	7601200	and I'm going to steal this music and throw it in there. And they don't, they don't know. They
7601200	7610080	don't know anything about, you know, their IP and stuff like that. So yeah, like I said, I said this
7610640	7614400	months ago that this is bound to happen. So yeah, here we are.
7615040	7620480	Here we are. All right. Last tonight, before we get to emails and all that other good stuff,
7620480	7624240	we have a very interesting promotion coming from Jackbox Games because of course they have
7624240	7631280	Jackbox Party Pack 7 to promote. So apparently in the next week, Jackbox is going to be letting you
7631280	7638080	hire free practice friends. What are practice? Yeah, you get practice friends and what they're
7638080	7641840	going to do, they're going to remind you what it's like to be around other people.
7641840	7648480	You sign up and you get to compete for time slots, and then you get 30 minutes of judgment free
7649200	7655920	Jackbox Party Pack game time. And so the Jackbox Party Pack folks, they all must be hired improv
7655920	7660320	actors or something. They're going to help you remember how to interact with people because,
7660320	7664880	you know, it's been a long 15 months. But I don't plan on interacting with people ever again.
7664880	7669440	Well, then maybe this isn't the promotion for you, perhaps.
7669440	7675520	I'm living my hikikomori fantasy, yo. In fact, the interesting thing about it
7676240	7680640	and the thing that I think they may have missed is that the last thing I want to do right now is
7680640	7686640	a virtual hangout like that virtual hangouts. I've been doing that for 15 months. I don't
7686640	7693920	want to do it anymore. So I think that may be where they made an error. But you know what?
7694640	7699040	We need a brunch so that we can learn how to hang out with people.
7700240	7702880	I've done brunch a couple times. And then there's food.
7702880	7705360	Yes. I have not been to a brunch.
7706080	7707840	What happened to miss? I don't want to see anybody.
7708800	7715920	Well, that's different. I'm talking about like people, quote fingers, people.
7715920	7720720	Oh, when you say you don't want to see people, but you do want to see a mimosa.
7721520	7725840	I want to see a mimosa and I want to hang out with my friends.
7725840	7729040	All right. My friends are better than people.
7730320	7735840	Bobby in chat is saying bring O.L.R. back in person. Well, we'll see what happens.
7737200	7740800	But I have a really good mic and you can wear my pajamas.
7740800	7746240	You can bring the mic here. You can wear your pajamas here. But or we can come there.
7746240	7751760	Oh, we could. But, you know, if I go out there, we could do sushi before the show.
7752800	7756720	Yes. We haven't done sushi before the show in a hot minute.
7756720	7758880	That is true. Now you're now you're starting to think of some of the pros.
7760400	7765040	Yeah, but then that means I would have to like. Rush right home to.
7766560	7769680	Yeah, well, just we'll talk about we'll talk about. All right. We'll figure it out.
7770240	7775600	All right. Let's let's figure some things out with the live interactions that are via chat.
7775600	7779440	If you have anything else you want to add there or you want to get to our mailbag,
7779440	7783120	participate at Orange Laundry dot com is the place to send us emails.
7783120	7786000	I'm also going to get to a few of the stories from discord.
7786880	7791600	So let's get to the mailbag. Participate at Orange Laundry dot com. I think I saw a
7791600	7794800	couple of emails tonight, right? Yeah, there's a few.
7796880	7803280	So I'll go ahead and start with the earliest one. Hi, Rob. Enthusiastically rave wave at Rob
7804240	7811040	regarding No Man's Sky. No Man's Sky is a game I bought at lunch and quickly became bored with.
7811040	7814560	This isn't because I was dissatisfied with the trailers or the hype of the game,
7814560	7818320	because I do not buy into the trailers or hype of anything.
7818320	7824160	Like Flavor Flav said, don't believe the hype. Rather, I became bored with No Man's Sky because
7824160	7829760	I didn't see the point. There wasn't a narrative to follow in the exploration game, nor was there
7829760	7834960	an objective for me to follow that I really cared to follow. I just didn't see the point.
7834960	7838640	So I stopped playing No Man's Sky because I didn't see the you said you didn't see the point.
7838640	7845440	That's repetitive, dude. I'm reconsidering playing No Man's Sky because I still own it on PS4.
7845440	7849600	So, Rob, as someone who has played No Man's Sky more than I have and clearly sees
7849600	7853120	more of a value to the game than I had in my initial playthrough.
7853120	7857920	Is there a point? Please be as open and broad as you wish. I'm open to being persuaded.
7857920	7862000	Stay care of entertainment. Well, the number one thing I could
7862000	7867440	say is that you already bought the game. Why do I need to convince you?
7867440	7870800	Like you're not going to be spending any money to get in there and play it again.
7870800	7874880	So I think you already spent there. They already got your money. You might as well get your money's
7874880	7878640	worth and go check out what they've changed. Like, you know, if this is a conversation on
7878640	7881760	me trying to convince you to buy the game, then I guess that might be kind of a different thing.
7881760	7886400	But if you already have it, like I think you're kind of just making up excuses not to play it,
7886400	7890400	which is fine. I do that all the time. I'm not saying like, oh, how dare you? Please.
7890400	7894400	I just talked about earlier in the show about, oh, I was playing this thing for like five minutes
7894400	7898240	and then, oh, got distracted by some outer worlds. I was playing outer worlds for a little bit and
7898240	7902160	then ended up flipping and going somewhere else. One of these days, I'll get back to outer worlds.
7902160	7908080	One of these days. But, you know, is there? Yes, they added a better story from what was there in
7908080	7911920	the beginning, but I'm not going to sit here and say, oh, it's got the depth of something like
7911920	7918800	Mass Effect. No, but there it is a better tutorial. It is a better like quest that walk
7918800	7924400	you piece by piece through the game that you don't feel like you're literally lost in space.
7924400	7933360	Like there is a thread that will help you move things along and, excuse me, excuse me, cough,
7933360	7939360	and will get you to a point where now you feel empowered enough to be able to explore on your
7939360	7942800	own. And I think that might, and from what your email is saying, that sounds like it was the
7942800	7946640	biggest piece that's missing for you is that the original version of No Man's Sky really didn't
7946640	7952240	give you shit. And now, now it's got, you know, a full compendium built into the game and most
7952240	7956880	importantly, quests that walk you through every piece of the way. You already own the game,
7956880	7961120	my friend. Get your money out of it. Do the thing. Do the thing.
7961120	7971600	All right, next up. What game genre name is most in need of an update or change? This comes from
7971600	7979200	D. I don't think any of them do. They're all fairly accurate.
7981200	7988480	No, I know. Walking sim. Walking sim needs to change. Because I think that term originally
7988480	7992560	was used kind of like in a negative context, like, oh, all you do in these games is you go
7992560	7996640	around and you walk, you know, when describing things like everybody's gone to the rapture,
7996640	8003840	dear Esther, whatever, what remains of that's more of a community colloquialism. It's not an
8003840	8008240	actual genre. Yeah, but I'm worried it's one of those things where it's like Xerox,
8008240	8012960	you say it so much, it sticks. You know what I mean? Like, if that happens, it happens. It's
8012960	8021440	just the nature of language. Yeah, I guess, I guess. But I mean, that's the one that comes
8021440	8027680	to mind. I think the walking sim that I'm seeing kind of out there, I try to kind of,
8027680	8032240	I love walking sim games, but I think it would be better if they were called something else. Like,
8032240	8038240	I don't know if we talk like narrative heavy or... That's what they're called. Like, everyone's gone
8038240	8043680	to the raptures, I think is what called just narrative game. Yeah, I think that's a better
8043680	8049760	label for it. But that's what it's actually called. The walking sim is more a community
8049760	8056560	colloquialism for it. All right. It's not actually the genre name. Loki? What about like,
8057520	8061200	like Mr. Something like that? Because that almost reminds me of like a walking sim, I guess,
8061200	8068480	unless there's not really puzzles to solve in say, you know, a quote unquote walking sim game.
8069200	8073360	I don't know. Even something like Gone Home had puzzles in it. I mean, it was a little light.
8073360	8081840	It was more like adventure puzzler. Yeah. You know, but or I like what Siata Berry says
8081840	8085600	enhanced visual novel. I mean, that's what some of these are, but they're more considered. I think
8085600	8090400	the genre is actually called like narrative adventure. Yeah, enhanced visual novel makes
8090400	8097040	me think of something like Hot Devil Boyfriend or something like that. That's dating sim. Well,
8097040	8101520	that's Yeah, like, like, that's kind of what I Yeah, so I like an actual visual novel
8102480	8108480	would be something like, well, I mean, I had like a bunch of visual novel games like co new that
8108480	8113680	were based off of anime like back in the day, where you just basically follow the story and
8113680	8121680	little bits of it are animated. But, yeah. Anyway, I mean, that was that was the thing
8121680	8127920	that popped in my head with the question. So because I mean, I adventure music game,
8127920	8134480	retro fantasy, RPG, I don't have a problem with any of those. I kind of want to D, I want you to
8134480	8139040	email us back. How would you answer this question? Because I'm kind of curious. I don't know. I'm
8139040	8143680	just like, I'm kind of curious. Like, because sometimes I feel like maybe you got this question
8143680	8148240	from something you want to see different. And so I'm like, curious what that is. So
8149040	8155280	Oh, hell, Rob. Look at what just happened in chat. Oh, we just hit our point reward goal
8156000	8162000	for Episode One of OLR with commentary. So we have to figure out a day that's gonna work for that.
8162000	8167600	Yeah, we just raised 150,000 points. That's the most we've ever had for a reward. Yeah,
8167680	8172480	Shane was the lucky one to cross the line there. Are you I don't know if you guys are you guys
8172480	8180640	generally available on Wednesdays? I work until 830. Drat. What night? But
8183200	8187360	I can make arrangements. Well, because I was going to say June 23rd, which is the actual
8187360	8190400	birthday of the show, is a Wednesday this year. And I was thinking that would be a good day for
8190400	8195920	it. But if you were to happen, you make it happen. I will talk offline. I don't don't hold this to
8195920	8200480	that day yet. Chat, because clearly arrangements have to be made. But that is we're going to aim
8200480	8205600	around that day if nothing else. Sound good. All right. But it may not be in person because
8205600	8209680	I'd probably have to just get right off work and hop on. Oh, no, I don't think this has to
8209680	8215440	be in person. I think we can do it over over Discord or whatever. Yeah. All right. Last email.
8215440	8221760	Yes. Hello, LR. I was super excited when I heard about Tyto's upcoming mini arcade cabinet based
8221760	8227680	on the full size egret 2 candy cap. I was also super excited to hear about it mentioned on OLR.
8227680	8232560	But some of the amazing and coolest things about this mini were not mentioned. So I had no choice
8232560	8238400	but to enlighten you all as to why this will be the best mini gaming thingy ever. Does it have a
8238400	8245040	link cable? Why? Why are I'm going to finish reading? Thank you. Of course, we know that
8245040	8251440	Tyto has a history of filled with amazing classic games, and we've been promised 40 of them in this
8251440	8255840	thing. Most of the titles have yet to be announced, but already were given kicks, which
8255840	8262160	I love. Bubble Bobble, Elevator Action, Rustan, and the iconic Space Invaders. Based on that,
8262160	8266240	I feel like it's already safe to say this will have the best game selection of any mini cab to
8266240	8271600	date. If you grabbed or simply paid attention to Sega's Astro City mini arcade late last year,
8271600	8276240	or one of the biggest one of the biggest complaints about it was its widescreen monitor.
8276320	8282320	None of the classic games use widescreen after all. The new Tyto cab will not cheap out in this
8282320	8288880	regard. It's coming with an honest to goodness four to three monitor. But the coolest thing
8288880	8294080	about the screen is that it rotates 90 degrees just like on the full size cabinet. This will
8294080	8299680	allow you to play all of the included vertically oriented games the way they were meant to be
8299680	8304720	played without scaling down the graphics to the size of postage stamp. Like the Astro City mini,
8304720	8311360	Tyto's new cab will be released alongside a full sized arcade stick. The stick is meant to have
8311360	8319040	to be an exact replica of the original Egret 2 candy cabs control panel. However, there's more.
8319040	8325760	In addition to that arcade stick, Tyto is also releasing a full sized replica panel containing
8325760	8330640	both a paddle controller and trackball. Not only does this mean we'll be getting some of Tyto's
8330640	8336000	greatest games that uses control methods, but also standard USB plug will allow us to use it
8336000	8341040	with emulators on PC as well. Paddle and trackball controllers are not readily available in plug and
8341040	8346560	play solutions, so I'm super excited to get this. This is a long email. The paddle and trackball
8346560	8352080	panel include an SD card with 10 additional games, bringing the total up to 50, including
8352080	8358000	such classics as Arkanoid, Strike Bowling, and Camel Tree, which is one of my personal favorites.
8358880	8363440	Strike, uh, sorry, and just in case you missed that, yes, you can add additional games with
8363440	8367440	SD cards. None of the other mini cabs have this capability. Hopefully there will be
8368240	8372880	many more card releases. You can switch the joystick between 8-way and 4-way operation.
8372880	8377120	Instruction cards are included that sit right on top of the cab. Never mind the fact that Tyto
8377120	8382240	games have some of the best soundtracks before video game soundtracks were even cool. There are
8382240	8387440	a million reasons to get this. You should probably go to Amazon Japan and pre-order the Everything
8387520	8391200	bundle right now that includes the mini cab, the paddle, the trackball controller with its bonus
8391200	8396800	games, a full-size cab, uh, the paddle and trackball controller. Wait, I'm, I'm, I'm a
8396800	8401200	line back. The full-size joystick, an additional controller, which is far more compact. The
8401200	8405920	instruction cards, an art book, a collection of soundtrack CDs, and more for the low, low price
8405920	8411680	of $410 US dollars for shipping. Do it, do it now. Of course, there are smaller packages available
8411680	8415360	if you don't actually want all those things, but why wouldn't you want all of those things?
8415600	8420480	Sorry, that was long, a little late for that, but I hope my excitement came across. I can't
8420480	8425040	wait to play this thing. Yeah, Forza Horizon 5 looks pretty cool too. Have a great week.
8425040	8430400	Already pre-ordered, Aaron Yyr. Hey, I appreciate the long email with all the details on that
8430400	8434400	because, um, yeah, you know, I, I knew about like the screen rotating and things like that,
8434400	8439200	but you know, you really went into some detail there on that. I, 400 might be a bit much,
8439200	8442640	but then of course you're talking, of course I say that and then in the same breath as like,
8442640	8448320	but I'll pay it for Tron. So clearly, clearly we all have our faves and we all have those
8448320	8452800	weak spots and the things that God damn it moment with the wallet and all that stuff.
8452800	8458000	So, um, this is one of yours and Tron is one of mine, but I think you make a good pitch for it.
8458000	8461840	If I, if I had that type of extra money on the side, I'd love to pick one up, but I just,
8461840	8465440	I don't in space, but I just don't see that happening right now, but maybe in the future,
8466080	8471600	we'll see. All right. Was that it for emails? That was it. That was it for emails. Um, I was
8471600	8474720	trying to scan. That was a lot of email to read though. It was a lot of emails tonight,
8474720	8480160	but we hope you'll bring more participate at orange lounge, radio.com. Um, some things from
8480160	8485600	the Twitter verse that, um, Simpsons arcade one-up was finally officially confirmed, uh,
8485600	8491040	this week. And, uh, yes, that's happening, but no word on the Tron thing yet. Although I guess we
8491040	8494400	imagine that will happen, uh, a really cool thing that was posted in our discord. Um,
8494400	8498560	and if you haven't seen this YouTube, uh, definitely Google on YouTube or, you know,
8498560	8504720	look it up this 40 new musicians. Welcome back soak into final fantasy 14 or Bobby posted the
8504720	8508960	link in our discord. And I encourage you to join our discord vog network.com. That's VOG
8508960	8514000	network.com slash discord. And you can help, uh, get stories to catch our attention throughout the
8514000	8518240	week and share cool little links like that. Obviously we had that, um, story a couple of
8518240	8523280	weeks ago with, um, soak in revealing his battle with cancer, um, at the final fantasy 14 virtual
8523280	8529120	fan fest this year. Um, so that whole, uh, the 40 musicians collaborating to kind of welcome him
8529120	8534720	back and, and really kind of do a thank you. Um, I think it's really cool. I think this is really
8534720	8543280	cool. SSJ 100, Matt shared, uh, a hidden 1984 level in Tetris effect. That is a throwback to
8543280	8548400	the original computer terminal, the electronic a 60, and that's what the Tetris game was made
8548400	8553680	for originally. And it's got a really cool look to it. Um, I know there's an old, like,
8554320	8558560	maybe like 91 or something like that level in Tetris effect. That's really cool looking.
8558560	8562560	This one looks cool too. Like it really looks like an old ass computer terminal,
8562560	8567760	but Tetris effect in it. And I think that's just another reason to fire up an old game like that
8567760	8575520	again. That's for sure. Um, and then one other story that I think is just, yeah, just barely
8575520	8582240	from this week, um, Facebook gaming is trying to lure some folk. Tiger claw shared this one. Oh
8582240	8588000	no, I shared this one, but what it was a discussion that tiger call, Oh, because tiger
8588000	8593440	claw had posted the thing about, uh, that you will no longer be able to use Facebook to log into
8593440	8598320	Twitch. And that started a much longer conversation. And then I had found that story on Kotaku earlier
8598320	8602560	this week about how, uh, Facebook gaming is apparently going to be giving a hundred percent
8602560	8608720	of proceeds to their partners, uh, for a couple of years to try to make, uh, the Facebook gaming
8608720	8614160	revenue share platform a little more, uh, lucrative. And, um, as much as I don't like
8614160	8618960	Facebook and I, I, I will not go to Facebook gaming, uh, unless a lot changes. I mean,
8618960	8622960	I guess I shouldn't ever permanently close the door or burn the bridge down completely,
8622960	8628080	but a lot would have to change. I'm pretty happy here on Twitch, but I think it would be great if
8628080	8634080	the competition and all that maybe did light a fire to Twitch to maybe increase the revenue
8634080	8638000	sharing. We get a little bit here because right now it's 50 50. It would be nice if it was a
8638000	8643120	little bit higher, but I suppose, you know, Twitch as it is, uh, Amazon has questions about the
8643120	8649760	profitability and all that stuff. So, um, maybe we got to be careful, but I, I dunno, I just feel
8649760	8655520	like there's gotta be other way. Maybe if Twitch got into some of these things like, um, creating
8655520	8662480	merchandise, like, you know, right now we use a stream lab store and other companies use other
8662480	8667200	types of third-party stores to sell merchandise. And it seems a little silly when Twitch is backed
8667200	8672080	by Amazon that they didn't get on the merch store thing first. I just think there's other ways and
8672080	8677280	other ideas and things they could come up with, um, for revenue sharing that, um, then they could
8677280	8681680	give more of a cut of bits and subs, but certainly that Facebook thing is going to give a little added
8681680	8686720	pressure. Although it should, you know, if you really look at all the, if, then, buts, the
8686720	8691600	footnotes and everything that really goes with that Facebook deal, it's not going to be like
8691600	8697200	everybody. It's going to be some people to try to, you know, lure them from the Twitch and all that
8697200	8702560	stuff. So, um, something to keep in mind, the headline was a little deceiving in that regard
8702560	8706800	is it doesn't get into all the footnotes, but again, we all know headlines are set up to be
8706800	8714400	clickbait on where? Facebook. So, all right. Anyway, that's, uh, it for the discord comments
8714400	8718480	tonight. And so I think that is about going to wrap it up for our show tonight, unless
8718480	8722320	let me check in with Loki and or Dark Sakura for any last minute stories.
8725760	8731040	Um, I mean, one of the other announcements that they had, you know, Netflix wise, we, did we talk
8731040	8737200	about Lance Reddick being, uh, a Wesker? No, we didn't, but, um, yes, that's a great thing to
8737200	8741840	mention the whole, uh, Resident Evil cast being revealed. Yeah. So that's gonna be pretty awesome.
8743200	8748720	Awesome. Um, Dark Tetsuya is bringing up, uh, from the arcade one upside of things,
8748720	8753680	the class of 81 cabinet that was not leaked, but they announced that it's going to be like a Ms.
8753680	8759040	Pac-Man, uh, and Galaga kind of combined thing. And that's got, but there's, there's much more
8759120	8764720	to that as well. So it's pretty cool. Oh, thank you, Matt, for reminding me.
8764720	8771040	Intellivision amico is having a press thing tomorrow, uh, 9 45 in the morning, our time
8771040	8776560	Pacific, uh, 12 45 Eastern. So that could be interesting because they are launching this
8776560	8780800	holiday. Um, so we'll get a little more, you know, they've been kind of putting out more and more
8780800	8785440	details about the games, but I really think we're going to get a sense of what is, what is, what is
8785440	8789920	this all going to look like this holiday? What are all the games and all that stuff? So, um, we
8789920	8795280	know a lot, uh, and we know, I think all the free ones at this point, but, uh, we, we can't forget
8795280	8799120	that Intellivision amico is a thing and that's happening this holiday. So they're going to have
8799120	8806880	their press thing tomorrow. All right. Anything else? All right. I'm playing with the light on my
8806880	8812560	mic on the camera. It's weird. Uh, I think we will wrap things up. Thank you guys so much for, uh,
8812560	8815920	checking out our show tonight, downloading our show and checking out orange launch radio.
8815920	8820640	Appreciate you guys. If would you, if, excuse me, if you like what you heard here at orange
8820640	8824560	launch radio, tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word because we are the show
8824560	8829120	where every gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here to put out on air, then what are we
8829120	8834240	going to do? So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, uh, goes an awful long way as well.
8834240	8838320	And we always appreciate that type of support. Um, thank you. Thank you so much. Uh, again,
8838320	8842160	we had a hype train going on earlier tonight. I will acknowledge everybody after the credits here.
8842320	8845520	Um, but I just want to say thank you. You guys don't have to do that, but you do.
8845520	8849760	Um, and, and just thanks so much. Even if you're just listening to the show
8849760	8853200	and you like never email us or tweet us or anything, you're a lurker,
8853200	8857440	you know what? I appreciate that. You know what? I lurk in a lot of Twitch feeds, so
8857440	8863360	it's fine. Um, I do too fairly regularly. Well, I lurk and then I see dark soccer
8863360	8868880	chatting in the side. So I have to go, hi, BB, even though sometimes I feel that's
8868880	8872000	disrespectful to the streamer. You know, I gotta be careful cause I need to say
8872000	8877760	hi to the streamer and then say hi to Jamie. You know what? I think that it just happens cause
8877760	8882080	the community has gotten so close that everyone's going to say hi to everyone. So for sure. That's
8882080	8887120	true. That's true. All right. Uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night
8887120	8892560	and wrap it up. Um, Jamie, I will start with you. All right. Well maybe next week we'll find someone
8892560	8901520	else to raid. Okay. Um, it seems to be a point of contention. Okay. Um, Loki, your final thought
8901520	8908560	tonight? Uh, my final thought is I'm looking forward to taking a little bit of a break,
8910720	8916080	at least no more two in the morning Minecrafts. Oh yeah. You, uh, I was like taking a break.
8916080	8920880	Don't you have a lot of video to edit? No, no. Well, I still have a lot of video to
8920880	8926720	shoot, so it's, it's not even edit, but it's, it's everything. Yeah. Um, and then my final
8926720	8931920	thought tonight. Um, I don't know. Um, I, uh, thank you. Alan's in the kitchen, so I will
8931920	8936000	dedicate my final thought to Alan. Even though he's listening to his, Oh, he gave me a thumbs
8936000	8942720	up. Thank you for getting me the arcade cabinet and indulging in my stupid, um, addictions to,
8942720	8947920	uh, these mini cabs and so forth and buy me snacky foods and soda and whatever else you
8947920	8953520	got at target. So, all right. Excellent. Uh, that's it. A shout out to my husband at the
8953520	8957840	end of the show. Oh, all right. That's it. We're going to roll credits. We will see you guys next
8957840	8965520	week. Nintendo Tuesday in television Monday. I'm sure one of those we'll be talking about next
8965520	8969600	week. No, we'll talk about both and other stuff. I'm sure that comes up throughout the week. It's
8969600	8973120	still, it's going to be another big show next week. Stay tuned. We'll see you in seven days.
8973120	8978480	Have a great night, everybody. Good night. You've been listening to orange lounge radio
