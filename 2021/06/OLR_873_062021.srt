1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,720
Over its lifetime, the Xbox One eventually gained backwards compatibility for some titles

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,920
as far back as the Xbox, well, the very first Xbox.

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,440
But soon, Xbox One owners could gain the ability to play some Xbox Series S and X titles, presumably

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,560
via Game Pass.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,360
PlayStation Now has, of course, provided similar features like this for many years already.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,080
This is likely a new majority trend of gaming.

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,280
And now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki, to tell you more

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,000
about this and the rest of the week's news, starting right now on the show, where every

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,360
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,620
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:56,600
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are back and live once again with episode number 873

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,200
of our show for June 20th, 2021.

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,960
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joining you here every week with my co-hosts.

15
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,560
First off, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers, not here at the moment.

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,200
She's going to come into the show a little bit later on around 7 o'clock Pacific time,

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
10 o'clock Eastern.

18
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,340
So we'll say hi to her a little later.

19
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,480
But we do have joining us right off the top of the show, we have Loki joining us.

20
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,480
Hi, Loki.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,480
Hello.

22
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,480
How's it going?

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,480
Hi, how are you?

24
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,480
I'm doing pretty good.

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,480
Rushing around.

26
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,480
Yeah.

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,200
Kind of running around there at the last minute before the show starts tonight.

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,360
Hold on, my bridge is still open.

29
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,360
You're okay.

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,800
I have no idea what's going on over there.

31
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,800
That's fine.

32
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,960
And, you know, it's the joy of doing live stuff because my headphones that I usually

33
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,420
hear Loki on just decided they're not going to work tonight.

34
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,760
So something's weird with my setup on how I listen to things.

35
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,880
So that's another thing I've got to try to fix behind the scenes.

36
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,080
Luckily, I can still hear him from the TV that's in the studio here.

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,560
But it's a little harder to hear.

38
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,480
I prefer the headphones.

39
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,960
But that's just the joy of running and doing things live sometimes.

40
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,960
Things happen.

41
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,960
Oh, thank you.

42
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,960
SG100 Matt gave me the Intel.

43
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,960
His fridge is open.

44
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,960
That's what he said.

45
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,960
Thank you.

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,960
The live chat.

47
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,640
Always here to save the day because we do tape live.

48
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,520
Every Sunday night.

49
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,520
What's that?

50
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,400
I was going to say I shut it really quickly because I was putting my dinner stuff away.

51
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,960
And it's got like this weird latch on it.

52
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,440
So if you shut it too fast, it stays open.

53
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,000
I see.

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That sounds complicated.

55
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,440
That's all right.

56
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
All right.

57
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,440
News for everybody.

58
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
All right.

59
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
Let's see.

60
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,440
What else I want to say?

61
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,840
Yes, we do have our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock

62
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,820
Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at twitch.tv slash vog network right after the Bobby Black

63
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,820
Wolf show.

64
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,520
And Loki, I wanted to say as well.

65
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,520
Happy Father's Day.

66
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,320
It is that day and happy Father's Day to all the gamer dads out there and all my gamer

67
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
daddies.

68
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,320
Wink wink nudge nudge.

69
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,440
I hope you all are having a wonderful day.

70
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,920
Was your day full of Metroid I see playing behind you?

71
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,520
I think that's Metroid Zero Mission specifically.

72
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,080
That's Metroid Fusion, actually.

73
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,840
Oh, my bad.

74
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,360
So no, it was not playing Metroid at all.

75
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,560
It was roller skating and grocery shopping.

76
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
I see.

77
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,400
And rushing to finish while rushing to upload my video because for those who don't follow

78
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,320
me on Twitter, Comcast decided to be Comcast for the last two days.

79
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,380
And so I haven't had internet for like a day and a half just on the weekend, too, which

80
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,380
is great.

81
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,760
Perfect timing because I had my I stayed up till two in the morning to get my episode

82
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,760
done.

83
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,560
It's ready to upload it and buy internet.

84
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,260
So it's yeah, that was fun.

85
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,440
And the kids, you know, they don't like not having internet.

86
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,200
They kind of bounce off the walls.

87
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,320
So yeah, it was unfortunate.

88
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,680
So I finally got that uploaded this afternoon.

89
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,240
So my brand new episode with Tango Tech from Hermitcraft is up, which is amazing.

90
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,680
I had a really great time with him last week, and it was very exciting to be able to cut

91
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,440
that down once again.

92
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,880
I listened back to it as I was editing it, and I don't like listening to well, this is

93
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,000
going to be interesting going into Wednesday because I don't like listening back to myself

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,040
as it is and listening back to myself when I'm incredibly nervous, made me incredibly

95
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
nervous.

96
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,760
So that was fun.

97
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:30,520
But I did get to cut it down to make it seem like I'm less nervous than I actually was,

98
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,520
which is good.

99
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,520
But yeah, go check it out if you can, you know, hopefully people find it because I mean,

100
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,600
it's pretty amazing.

101
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,600
And I know I've been watching a lot of Hermitcraft season eight that they just started.

102
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
So yeah.

103
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Yeah.

104
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Keep on going.

105
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Excellent.

106
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,680
I fixed my headphone problems while you were talking there.

107
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
Thank you.

108
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,800
ST100Matt actually links that video there live in our chat room.

109
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,240
I'm sure for those that are not listening live tonight, because of course, we love all

110
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,480
the podcast listeners as well.

111
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,920
Hopefully you can get the link there.

112
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,120
I'm sure that'll be in our Discord server if it's not already, then yeah.

113
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,640
Speaking of things to check out, I do need to give this one cheap plug at the top of

114
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,640
the show.

115
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,800
I don't like to push the stuff to spend money on a lot.

116
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,720
But you know, some people ask like, can I get a shirt that says Orange Lounge Radio

117
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
on it?

118
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,720
Yes, you can.

119
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,040
We've actually done a really big update to our store.

120
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,280
So if you haven't checked out the shop, check that out over at vognetwork.com slash shop.

121
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,640
And now not only can you get that cool little OLR pixel logo, but Jamie went in there made

122
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,640
some new stuff.

123
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,720
So there's a very like Sega inspired Orange Lounge Radio type of shirt you can get.

124
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,120
You can get a one piece swimsuit if that's your thing.

125
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,400
Loki, I'm sure you're very excited to hear that you can get some stickers.

126
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
You can get some tumblers.

127
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,600
You can get there's actually a fanny pack like my wife would be super.

128
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
You can get a fanny.

129
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,360
Apparently, that's the hot merch.

130
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,940
Somebody else is bringing that up earlier.

131
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,360
So fanny packs are all the rage again.

132
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,100
And then actually speaking of pixel logos.

133
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,100
So we have some really cool.

134
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,740
OK, so dark soccer did a new Orange Lounge Radio logo.

135
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,980
She did a cool little retro kind of vog network look.

136
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,980
That's pretty cool.

137
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,980
So check that out.

138
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,960
And then speaking of retro looks, Loki's vog pixel art we talked about on the show a couple

139
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,120
weeks ago.

140
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,880
He just had to resend me the email and go, I sent this to you months ago, dummy.

141
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,880
No, he didn't say that.

142
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,860
But that's that's definitely what I heard.

143
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,860
That's OK.

144
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,860
He said that.

145
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:24,060
And that's it's like my work, you know, where the well, the tone of your email.

146
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,220
There's no tone in the email.

147
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,220
It's text.

148
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,640
Well, I interpreted it as you were angry.

149
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,160
Loki started off his email saying per my prior email.

150
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
He did.

151
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,160
No, he was totally fine.

152
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
I'm just giving a shit.

153
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,560
I feel like a dummy because you totally had sent that before.

154
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
But things happen.

155
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But now the vog pixel stuff is up on the show up on the shop, too.

156
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,200
So, yeah, there's there's in fact, I think we put so much stuff on there.

157
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,300
We had to get rid of stuff.

158
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,140
I don't think you can get the vog masks anymore.

159
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,960
They might if they're still there.

160
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,960
It's not going to be for much longer because we kind of collaboratively decided those are

161
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,240
the first things being pulled.

162
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,200
I didn't care for the masks myself, but, you know, I guess if some people wanted them,

163
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
that's cool, too.

164
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
So.

165
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
All right.

166
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
There you go.

167
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,520
She Hulk in chat.

168
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
Thank you.

169
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,520
Saying push it.

170
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
So sell in the store.

171
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
Yes, I will.

172
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
And thank you very much for the biddies.

173
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
Appreciate that.

174
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
All right.

175
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
Let's get it.

176
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,480
OK.

177
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
Bobby says the masks are gone.

178
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
OK.

179
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
That's what I thought, because I know there's like a ton of new stuff in there.

180
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
And I know Bobby still wants to add a couple of things, too.

181
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,000
So I know we want to make sure we have enough room for everybody's stuff.

182
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So.

183
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
All right.

184
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Check that out.

185
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Again, vog network dot com slash shop.

186
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Let's get to news.

187
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,760
This was kind of the second half of E3 week.

188
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,680
There were some, you know, live I can't always say press conferences, but that's not really

189
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,660
what they are this year.

190
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:43,380
Kind of the presentations, direct presentations, whatever you want to call them.

191
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,100
There was a few of them.

192
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,100
Capcom had one and it was extremely not notable.

193
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,100
I'm sorry.

194
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,060
Sorry if you're a Capcom fan, but I think everybody who watched that presentation kind

195
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,340
of saw they didn't really give any new stuff, which is fine.

196
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,580
I guess they kind of promoted it in other places, except they said, oh, we're making

197
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,780
DLC for Resident Evil 8 Village because it's so popular.

198
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,780
Thank you.

199
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,300
We hadn't started it yet, but we're going to get right on that.

200
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,300
So there's that.

201
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,300
Yeah.

202
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,300
Yeah.

203
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,300
It was interesting.

204
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,300
Quest Buster says no.

205
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,300
Rob's right.

206
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,300
The Capcom one was pretty trash.

207
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,880
I think there was a Bandai Namco one, too.

208
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,840
But again, I don't think it gave us anything really new.

209
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,320
I think it was kind of just the stuff we already knew about, which I understand these kind

210
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,220
of presentations that come a little late.

211
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,820
I don't want to give too much shit because these presentations that come a little late

212
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,620
kind of have to read like how is Bandai Namco going to one up themselves after they put

213
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:38,620
that Elden Ring trailer in the Summer Games Fest thing.

214
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,580
Like, you know, it's but, you know, maybe sometimes people hope like, oh, maybe we'll

215
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,500
get gameplay or we'll get as a B trailer.

216
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Yeah.

217
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
No, I guess.

218
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
Guess none of that as well.

219
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
So.

220
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Yeah.

221
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:57,420
Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf is pointing out the E3 2008, the small one that wasn't in Santa

222
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,140
Monica, was the only Capcom presser I attended.

223
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,340
There was no game news.

224
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,380
It was just Avi Arad and some other people talking about how great the Lost Planet movie

225
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,380
was going to be.

226
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,460
I remember that one.

227
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,460
Yeah.

228
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,900
So sometimes these ones that are a little later, I mean, Konami always used to go late

229
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,900
in the game, too.

230
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,540
And we saw how well that worked out for them a couple of years in a row.

231
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,540
Right.

232
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,540
So, yeah.

233
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,940
So it's going to be great because it only lives in my imagination.

234
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,940
Yeah.

235
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:27,220
So most of the press events and stuff this week were not that exciting.

236
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,660
Let's be real or already had news that had come out before last week's show.

237
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,820
However, of course, Tuesday morning was the one that I think unarguably everyone was

238
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,420
really waiting for and knew would be the biggest one.

239
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,660
And that was the Nintendo Direct.

240
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,700
So let's recap a little bit about the Nintendo Direct and folks thoughts on that.

241
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,940
So, Loki, I know you watched it.

242
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,020
You actually watched it live.

243
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,020
I had to watch it.

244
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,180
I had to do the tape delay thing.

245
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,460
I had to do the thing like when we watch the Grammys on the West Coast.

246
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,180
It already aired on the East Coast, but we get the three hour tape delay.

247
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,680
The only one of those shows they don't actually I never watched the Grammys.

248
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
They're kind of garbage.

249
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,460
But it was just the first award show that came to mind that wasn't the Oscars or the

250
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,700
Super Bowl, because those are the two things that do air live on the West and East Coast

251
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,700
at the same time.

252
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,580
But most everything else, you have to wait three hours for.

253
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,460
So I had to watch the Nintendo Direct that way because I had I had meetings at work like

254
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,100
I couldn't get out of day job stuff.

255
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
It's important.

256
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,300
Well, I had meetings, too, but, you know, I just don't care.

257
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:30,820
No, I kind of had to lead mine, so well, OK, well, yeah, we had I had a meeting at

258
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,820
the same time.

259
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
It was about like.

260
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:40,700
It was about being motivated to like to be more organized and stuff, and it was just

261
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,380
a big old waste of time, so I popped this on instead.

262
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,460
It was way more interesting.

263
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,100
Love that you had a meeting about work motivation and you're sitting there watching this Nintendo

264
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,100
thing.

265
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,100
It cracks me up.

266
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,860
I actually waited until I had an appropriate break, like an hour and a half later, and

267
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,020
then I was like, OK, I can probably watch this 40 minute presentation in 30 minutes

268
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,300
because I'll just fast forward all the game footage about things that I'm just like, I

269
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,620
don't really need to see it.

270
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,620
So, yeah.

271
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,420
And yeah, I would say I actually didn't do that as much as you think.

272
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,300
I probably got through it in about thirty five minutes.

273
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,300
So.

274
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,300
But yeah.

275
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,620
So I really enjoyed it.

276
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,620
Loki, what were your thoughts overall?

277
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,620
I thought it was pretty good.

278
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,940
There's I mean, like with most things, I think it did have a lot of stuff in there that

279
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,900
people were looking for and some surprise stuff that I was looking for.

280
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,780
Still a few things missing that, you know, kind of like some updates on, you know, like

281
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,700
being a three prime four and stuff like that.

282
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,700
Yeah.

283
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,260
But I mean, there is a lot of meat there, so it was still pretty good.

284
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,260
Yeah.

285
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,260
So I kind of going through.

286
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:46,020
Well, but before you get to that, I think I kind of agree with you is that, yeah, overall,

287
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,300
I was very positive on it.

288
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,180
And for me, you know, I kind of have like my wish list, things that if Nintendo would

289
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,740
announced would make me extremely happy.

290
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,940
And I got two things on my wish list this year from Nintendo, and that hardly ever happens.

291
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,500
And let's just I know we want to run down everything that happens.

292
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,220
But I think the obvious things to bring to the table, there's a brand new 2D Metroid

293
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,220
game.

294
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,220
Y'all know that's my jam.

295
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,020
Well, it's kind of new, like I get and I didn't even pick up on this at first.

296
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,420
And like, yeah, because I recognize the name.

297
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,220
So that's been in like development for a while or at least rumored for a while.

298
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,220
Yeah.

299
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,220
Yeah.

300
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,260
Yeah.

301
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,260
Yeah.

302
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,620
The Metroid Dread was originally, I think, going to be the DS.

303
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,660
I think they were developing alongside Fusion.

304
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,620
And it was right at that time, like the advance and the DS were kind of both.

305
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,740
So Fusion came out on the advance and then Dread kind of did it.

306
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,620
And it's like Metroid Other M kind of happened instead.

307
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,660
So we never really got Dread at that time.

308
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,420
And I didn't piece together at first.

309
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,980
Oh, it's that game.

310
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,700
But obviously, you know, here we are like 14 years later.

311
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,740
It's still Metroid Dread and maybe some of the original story ideas are there.

312
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,740
But obviously the game is completely different now that it's on the Switch.

313
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,780
It's not pixels.

314
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,260
It's kind of got a different look to it.

315
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,260
But obviously I'm here.

316
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,700
I'm here with pixels, to be honest.

317
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,860
I mean, I kind of wish it was in the style, like, say, the modern Rayman games and stuff

318
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,940
like that, where it's hand drawn.

319
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,940
That would have been so good, but it's all right.

320
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:12,500
Yeah, I, I, I would have I would have been thrilled if it was more a pixel looking game,

321
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
but I'm OK.

322
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,620
I understand they want to evolve it.

323
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,020
You know, they're pushing it a different direction.

324
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,780
So like even I remember because I was writing out like in my Apple notes as I was watching

325
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,360
it instead of live tweeting, I was kind of like, oh, this is a different look.

326
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,780
It's going to take me some getting used to.

327
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,780
But you know what?

328
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,860
As long as the game's fluid, it's going to be fine.

329
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,220
And I'm just thrilled we get a new Metroid in the series.

330
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,540
Now I'm Tiger Claw in chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network says this new 2D Metroid

331
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,100
game is supposedly the final one for Samus.

332
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,300
If it sells really well, I'm sure they will find a way to do another one or there must

333
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,740
be some other character they're going to push it off to in the story of the game or so.

334
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,740
I don't know.

335
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,740
Obviously, Metroid Prime four.

336
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,840
We know it's still happening.

337
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,660
So, look, you said they didn't do an update.

338
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,660
They kind of did.

339
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,660
They didn't.

340
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,660
I know what you meant, though.

341
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,300
You wanted to see more footage or like what the hell is this thing look like?

342
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,500
But they did any footage, you know, they did say we're working on it.

343
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,660
We can't talk about it today, but we hope you'll take this instead.

344
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,980
And for me, I'm happy to take that instead this year.

345
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:16,340
So I'm fine if they need a little more time on Metroid Prime four.

346
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,340
So yeah.

347
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,940
Quest Quest Buster in chat says it's for the Samus Metroid arc, I thought, but not the

348
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,940
end of Samus.

349
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,260
Yeah, I just I just don't see them like actually actually having to be the last Samus game.

350
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,860
They could kill Samus at the end of this game and still not be done with her.

351
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,380
And obviously, I don't know spoilers or story or anything like that.

352
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,820
None of us have played the game yet.

353
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,220
But you know, it's just it's just like the alien franchise in Ripley.

354
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,220
OK.

355
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:45,580
Kill Samus, but then like she'll come back as a clone or something like that, like she's

356
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,340
not going to be done, done, done.

357
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,340
You know what I mean?

358
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,340
Yeah.

359
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,660
There will be there'll be Samus X like Mega Man will be Samus X.

360
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,660
Right.

361
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,660
Exactly.

362
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,960
So, yeah.

363
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,580
And as Joe and Hunter Matt says, in fact, there are no actual Metroids in this apparently.

364
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,700
I don't know if I believe that.

365
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,580
I know what I know what they're saying.

366
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,580
I know what they're saying.

367
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,580
I don't know if I believe it.

368
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,420
I think it's one of those things where they'll surprise us in the very last level.

369
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,820
But OK, let's let's not set our expectations too high.

370
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,020
But I'm just I'm just really happy to get a new 2D Metroid and see where they go with

371
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,020
it.

372
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,900
But I'm not sure I believe that there's no Metroids in it.

373
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,900
Sorry.

374
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,500
I just kind of like I think you're lying, but we'll see.

375
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,100
We'll see.

376
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,340
And then the other one and Loki, I know you've got to be thrilled with this one, too.

377
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,260
The new WarioWare announcement like that.

378
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,260
That's fantastic.

379
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,620
For all intents and purposes, that really came out of nowhere.

380
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,700
Like, I know there was some rumors about it, but a lot of things were rumored this year

381
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,460
that didn't happen, like a new model for the Switch.

382
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,300
So, you know, obviously, you know, anything can and will happen.

383
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,140
I'm very thrilled that the new WarioWare ended up being a thing.

384
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,900
I think it's interesting that they talked about it being the first WarioWare with co-op

385
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,900
when it's not.

386
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,980
Yeah, I don't think WarioWare.

387
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,500
It's not WarioWare on the GameCube had co-op.

388
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,980
So that was a little maybe they didn't say the first, but they kind of made it sound

389
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,860
like now there's co-op.

390
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,460
And it's like, well, you had that in the GameCube version.

391
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:21,700
It was, I think, very certain modes and very limited in that game, but it existed before.

392
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:32,700
I think I think the actual games themselves were not I think they were still for one player,

393
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,020
but you still played them.

394
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:39,700
I think that's the difference is that in this new one, you actually have games that

395
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,220
are playable with two people at once.

396
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,180
And I don't think the GameCube version had that.

397
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,180
I can't remember.

398
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,740
So, there is that.

399
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,500
Hi, joining us here a little early, but that's OK.

400
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
We love to see her.

401
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Hi there, DarkSakura.

402
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
I see you just joined us.

403
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
Hi.

404
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
Yeah, I woke up.

405
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Well, good morning.

406
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,860
I have, I have strain cheese.

407
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,860
Yummy.

408
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,500
Hey, we just talked about the new Metroid and I know you have to have some feelings

409
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
on that.

410
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,300
What are your thoughts seeing the Metroid Dread announcement?

411
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,460
Give now.

412
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,460
What do you think?

413
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,180
What do you think about the whole there are no Metroids in this game?

414
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:19,780
I said that's bull, that they're lying, that they're trying to keep it a secret or something.

415
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:23,980
I honestly don't care about there being no Metroids in it because I saw Chozo and that

416
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,980
makes me happy.

417
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,340
There are other pieces of Metroid lore for us to be in love with.

418
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:36,140
I certainly want more of the Chozo in it because, I mean, the only real story that any of us

419
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:41,260
got for the Chozo is in the manga, as I recall correctly.

420
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:47,340
If you want to discount like hints in Super Metroid, because I would say they were.

421
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,660
I mean, like real lore.

422
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,560
Yeah, I totally know what you mean.

423
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,860
But like, you know, in Super Metroid, they kind of became more than just the statue.

424
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,140
Like it was very clear there was more to them.

425
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,140
You know what I mean?

426
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,140
So, yeah.

427
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,140
Well, right.

428
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,140
Yeah.

429
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:06,620
If I recall correctly, I think it came out either before or around Super Metroid.

430
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:13,440
So I have to look that back up, but I'm glad that we're seeing some of them.

431
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,720
I almost wonder if this is some kind of prequel.

432
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,940
I don't think it's intended to be because you still have Prime serving as the prequels,

433
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,700
I think.

434
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,220
But anything's possible, really.

435
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,740
Like a pre-Metroid story.

436
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,740
Perhaps.

437
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,980
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says they're already making strats based on the trailer.

438
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,540
And I think he's referencing this comment from Tiger Claw.

439
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,940
Can't wait to see speedrunners take on this game and beat it under an hour.

440
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,940
I love that.

441
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,740
They're already strategizing based on the trailer.

442
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,740
Amazing.

443
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,740
So, yeah.

444
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,740
Yeah.

445
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,900
Sacred Jade in chat says, I thought this was a sequel to Fusion.

446
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,260
I think it is supposed to be like Metroid 5.

447
00:18:51,260 --> 00:19:00,320
So if you consider Metroid slash Metroid Zero, Super Metroid, Metroid Fusion, I guess

448
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,900
Other M or am I missing one?

449
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,060
No, of course I'm missing one.

450
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,820
Samus 2 on the Game Boy, Return of Samus.

451
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,340
They don't count Other M. Sorry, I skipped one.

452
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:11,100
So it's Metroid, Return of Samus, then Super Metroid, then Fusion.

453
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,760
Now this is 5, Metroid.

454
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,660
So Other M has been thrown out of the canon.

455
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,260
So, so much for that.

456
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,040
All right.

457
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,120
One has a few things they're embarrassed about in their history.

458
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,960
I didn't think Other M was as bad as everyone else does.

459
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,580
Like it's, it's definitely different.

460
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,580
She's different.

461
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,480
Like that's, that's, that's my review of Metroid Other M. She's different.

462
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:41,040
Not as different as Federation Force, but you know, that's what, that's one we'd like

463
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,040
to forget.

464
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,160
Loki, we don't talk about Federation Force.

465
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,680
We just, that, that she, she passed away.

466
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,080
Like we don't talk about that one anymore.

467
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,400
All right, let's see.

468
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,380
So other stuff in the Nintendo Direct.

469
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,840
So we've got Metroid out of the way.

470
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,120
We got Samus out of the way.

471
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,340
Oh, I should mention this.

472
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,280
The Breath of the Wild 2 footage.

473
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,400
So I have been an insufferable bitch on this show saying that if Nintendo doesn't show

474
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,960
Breath of the Wild 2 footage, they're doing the fans a disservice.

475
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:17,280
And y'all in chat, especially Bobby Blackwell, have been saying no person in the history

476
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,200
of ever has not like pre-ordered or bought the game because they didn't show footage

477
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
at a certain event.

478
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,040
And I was like, I don't care.

479
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,440
Your facts are inconvenient and I reject them.

480
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,420
And my point is, is that Nintendo is disrespecting their fans by continuing to not give a Breath

481
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,500
of the Wild 2 update.

482
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,660
They need to give us at least a little something, a little piece, a little taste.

483
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,160
Just lick, let me lick the wall just once, okay?

484
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,920
And I think they did that.

485
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,960
I know some people are kind of disappointed with what little of Breath of the Wild 2 they

486
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
showed.

487
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,720
I'm going to actually, I will surprise you all and actually defend it and say that was

488
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,100
what I was talking about.

489
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,100
That was fine.

490
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,100
That was needed.

491
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,600
That was all the update we needed.

492
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,600
We're good.

493
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Yeah, I think it was fine.

494
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
It looked great.

495
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
Mm-hmm.

496
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
So yeah.

497
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,580
Darktitsuyu in chat says, it was a brief tease, but I went away happy.

498
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,960
Can't wait to see what they do with the dual areas.

499
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
Absolutely.

500
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,800
Especially, are we getting the upside down castle in Breath of the Wild 2?

501
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,200
Because that's kind of cool.

502
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,160
Questbuster in chat says, I'm pretty excited on seeing what they had for Breath of the

503
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,160
Wild 2.

504
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,520
Did you notice those parallels to Skyward Sword?

505
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,560
I sure did.

506
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:33,160
Because that whole little blip started with Link falling through the sky just like a scene

507
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,600
in Skyward Sword.

508
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:40,760
And I'm laughing because I saw the most hilarious edit where somebody took that link flying

509
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,340
through the air thing.

510
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,500
And they photoshopped that instead of wearing pants, he's wearing a jockstrap.

511
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,380
So his ass is hanging out as he's flying through the air.

512
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,560
And I'm sorry, I'm immature and I thought it was really fucking funny.

513
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,620
So there's that.

514
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,060
But the Breath of the Wild footage was fun.

515
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,060
And it was also weird too, the show that, because they showed that like right after

516
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,600
the Skyward Sword HD or remaster thing.

517
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,900
So it was like, these are similar.

518
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,100
I don't know.

519
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:15,740
The way they set that whole segment up was a little bit of a misstep because they were

520
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,380
like, and here is the last game we have to talk about today.

521
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,380
And it went into Hyrule Warriors DLC.

522
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:27,580
And I was like sitting there going, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you for doing

523
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,700
the Hyrule Warriors last.

524
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,780
But then it kind of went into, then Anamora showed up and was like, let's talk about Zelda.

525
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,300
And I was like, oh, oh, okay, we're cool.

526
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:43,060
Oh, you're talking Zelda, the whole part, the whole piece, the whole story is the last

527
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,060
game of the day.

528
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,060
And I calmed down.

529
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,220
And so they did, of course, the Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild 2, and that little Game

530
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,220
and Watch thing, which is interesting.

531
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,220
It's actually pretty cool.

532
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,020
It has three games on it.

533
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,020
Yeah.

534
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,180
And I like that.

535
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,820
I like that more than the Mario one, I think.

536
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:02,580
Yeah, I think because the Mario games, how do I say this nicely?

537
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,140
The Mario is kind of played out at this point.

538
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,580
Obviously, Super Mario Brothers is an epic, epic game.

539
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,100
But how many times and how many places do you need the original Super Mario Brothers

540
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,100
to be played?

541
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,380
I feel like there's going to be a version that comes out for refrigerators soon.

542
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,580
That is like how many places that shows up.

543
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,740
But the original Legend of Zelda, and especially like Zelda 2 Adventures of Link, the Game

544
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,200
Boy one too, those are some deeper cuts.

545
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,540
And I think that's nice to see those on the little Game and Watch.

546
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,060
I think the little clock thing looks cute, the way that you can play it.

547
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,700
So I'm more interested in the Zelda one than I was the Mario one.

548
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,700
I will say that.

549
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:46,340
So what are you going to do when they release the Metroid Game and Watch next year?

550
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,040
Shove it right in my ass, Loki.

551
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:56,900
I can see them doing like a Metroid, a Metroid, the Game Boy, Metroid Returns, and then just

552
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,780
for the hell of it, maybe throw in Kid Icarus or something like that.

553
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,860
Now you're just like throwing fanboy options out there.

554
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,420
Like yeah right, Kid Icarus.

555
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,140
Like Nintendo's going to acknowledge that franchise again.

556
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:14,660
First off, Sakurai's going to have to take a nap before we can even think about a new

557
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,020
Kid Icarus game.

558
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,500
And I don't know what's up with that, so yeah.

559
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,060
I would love that though, don't get me wrong.

560
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:27,120
Like a Metroid Kid Icarus Game and Watch, like a password pack Game and Watch, I'm all

561
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
about that.

562
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,120
That would be amazing.

563
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,440
With that silver color.

564
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,000
So alright, anyway.

565
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,640
Bobby says I'm on a butt kick today.

566
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,920
I said two things.

567
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,920
Come on.

568
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,960
What was I supposed to say to that?

569
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,320
Imagine they release your favorite game on a Game and Watch.

570
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,320
What are you going to do?

571
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,320
Of course I'm going to buy it.

572
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,840
If I can get one.

573
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,840
That is.

574
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:54,360
The funny thing is that I'm in so many other streamers groups that I have plenty of butt

575
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,280
icons to satisfy anybody.

576
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,000
You're very kind and generous with a lot of the Dead by Daylight streamers.

577
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I see you sub to a lot of them.

578
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,100
And a lot of them have some nasty icons, so I don't know.

579
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,200
Some of those I'm like, how did that get through moderation?

580
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,200
So I'm always...

581
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,960
I'm having to be a little bit more judicious with who I sub to.

582
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
I understand.

583
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
I understand.

584
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,780
It's okay to have an occasional butt show up, you know?

585
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,080
It's just a butt.

586
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,080
Everybody has one.

587
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,080
Gosh.

588
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:31,080
Anyway, Darsakra, I have to ask you your thoughts on what little we saw, the little tease for

589
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,120
Breath of the Wild 2 and the Zelda stuff.

590
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,200
I'm exactly the same feeling as I was before.

591
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,260
I'm looking forward to it coming out.

592
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,300
This didn't really show me anything else.

593
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,640
Zelda fell down a hole.

594
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,640
We'll see.

595
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,640
All right.

596
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,760
Loki, why don't you walk us through some of the other things that they mentioned with

597
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,000
the Nintendo Direct?

598
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,160
Yeah, so actually kind of going back to the... even though you didn't like it, the Zelda

599
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,080
Hyrule Warriors DLC looked actually pretty cool, where you can actually play as the guardian

600
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,080
stuff.

601
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,960
So my son's excited about that, at least.

602
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,680
Other things that they talked about, they have a new Mario Party Superstars coming out.

603
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,720
That's going to be a collection of the mini games.

604
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,140
I think they did something similar already, but I guess it's now more.

605
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,560
It's like the greatest hits album.

606
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,760
Yeah, but they did that, though, with like the...

607
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,920
It was like Mario Party Gold or something like that.

608
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,720
I thought that came out already.

609
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,560
I think the big thing about this one is that it's all online now, because they finally

610
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,040
figured out that people can play Mario Party online and how to do that.

611
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,720
They figured it out online finally.

612
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,180
That's good.

613
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:40,120
They talked about the new DLC character for Smash Brothers, which is going to be Kazuya

614
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,620
Mishima from Tekken.

615
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,620
So that's cool.

616
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,200
We got all these fighting games kind of mixed together.

617
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,640
We're almost to Urgites, almost.

618
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:56,240
Apparently Heihachi is part of the temple level.

619
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
What else?

620
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,920
We got confirmation that Guardians of the Galaxy was also coming to the Switch, as well

621
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,800
as some other Switch games that we kind of figured were also coming.

622
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:14,640
So Two Point Campus, Just Dance 2022, Worms Rumble, Dragon Ball Z, Kakarot, and New Power

623
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,520
Awakens, part one and two.

624
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,160
So that's a long title.

625
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:24,200
A new Super Monkey Ball, Banana Mania, that's going to be a collection that's coming as

626
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,200
well.

627
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,640
Shimagami Tensei V, and what else?

628
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,400
New collection of Danganronpa games.

629
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,400
What?

630
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,400
Yep.

631
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,400
Yep.

632
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:44,120
It's Danganronpa Decadence, it's Trigger Happy Havoc, Danganronpa 2, V3, and the new

633
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,600
Danganronpa S Ultimate Summer Camp.

634
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Yay.

635
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,760
We've got a 3D Advance Wars remake, so that was kind of cool.

636
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,920
Oh yeah, that was very unexpected, in my opinion.

637
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,440
I was not expecting an Advance Wars remake, I'm not complaining.

638
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,400
It's not a series I super got into, but I know it is loved, I know people really appreciate

639
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
that.

640
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,560
I'm excited to see it.

641
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,280
And then, what else?

642
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,800
Fatal Frame is also coming, it's a Fatal Frame made out of black water.

643
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,760
That was kind of a surprise as well.

644
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,520
So yeah, I think Nintendo had a great direct, I really do.

645
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:30,440
You know, it wasn't like my face melted off, it was so amazing, but I walked out of it

646
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,880
going okay, I see what games I'm going to be playing this holiday and I'm going to have

647
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,880
fun with it.

648
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,360
And video games should be fun, yay.

649
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:44,320
So I was above, more than satisfied, we'll say that.

650
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,560
Alright, so there's the Nintendo Direct Recap.

651
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:52,360
Before we close the book on E3, Loki, am I missing anything else with the show itself

652
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,600
like isn't coming up later in our show or something that needs to be brought up?

653
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,120
I think we touched on everything, but I'm worried I missed something.

654
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,840
If there's something, then I missed it too, because E3 is hard, because there's a ton

655
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,880
of announcements and they're all over the place.

656
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,120
Should we say something about that in television presentation?

657
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,800
I didn't watch it, but I kind of read about it.

658
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,280
I watched it.

659
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,120
I still have a system pre-ordered.

660
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,200
I ordered them when they first came out.

661
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,440
I think the direction the system is taking is interesting.

662
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,240
They're really going to need the games to back it up, and I think they're really going

663
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,160
to need to show solid games that aren't just like, oh, I could do this on my cell phone.

664
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,840
They kind of have that opportunity with like, say, Earthworm Jim.

665
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,560
I think the whole, even though that series has its own issues, but I'm not going to go there.

666
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,720
But the Echo the Dolphin thing was a lot more exciting, not that series itself,

667
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,640
but the creators are making like a new game.

668
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,760
I think that now that's the kind of stuff where I'm like, OK, and television could have

669
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:57,640
a very interesting niche there if they get some of these like retro developers to come

670
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,560
back and do like a new thing.

671
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,200
I think that could be very because, you know, a lot of retro developers are kind of I think

672
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,040
we were talking a little bit about this with the Ken and Roberta Williams story last week

673
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:13,160
or the week before was that it's harder to develop a game now with, you know, one person

674
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,480
or a small team than it was back in the day.

675
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,600
But I think in television kind of opens up that possibility again a little bit because

676
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,880
of the rules for its system.

677
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,360
It almost lends itself better to small dev teams.

678
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,040
So I wonder if they're going to attract some of the retro devs a little more often.

679
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,920
I think they could be interesting.

680
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:33,560
Quest Buster in chat says the Amico presentation was neat.

681
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,480
Tallarico really emphasized that they weren't in competition with the big three.

682
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,120
They just want to be another fun option in addition to those.

683
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,200
And that's absolutely the right path to take.

684
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,880
But gaming, there's so much gaming that is outside just the big three.

685
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,000
I mean, hello, cell phones is huge.

686
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:56,440
But even now, you know, between arcade one up cabinets and little mini cabinets like

687
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,600
that Street Fighter one that Alan brought me in the middle of the show last week, you

688
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,400
know, there's there's other ways to kind of check games out that aren't just like your

689
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,920
traditional kind of system as well.

690
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,760
Games are baked into TVs now.

691
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,600
You know, it's it's the cloud gaming.

692
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,100
It is.

693
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,440
Gaming is kind of going beyond just the big three.

694
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,840
So I think it's very, very interesting.

695
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,560
SSJ 100.

696
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,600
Matt says put Pixel Poops on Amico, Tommy.

697
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,320
I've been saying to YYR he needs to I think I don't know.

698
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,600
I feel like he might have at least tried to like send an email.

699
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:34,760
I don't know if the email got anywhere, but I know like I think I think YYR's games, not

700
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,320
just Pixel Poops, but the types of games he develops like super multitasking like Amico

701
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,840
would be such a good platform for that.

702
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:46,680
So I'd be curious to see like what what's involved with developing for that.

703
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,840
Like I don't know what frameworks and stuff that it's supported on there.

704
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:55,640
I don't really know what the Intellivision Amico can do and like hardware wise.

705
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,320
So like how do I develop for that?

706
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,160
So I would love information on that, but.

707
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,440
I mean, they have an email address.

708
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,080
That's about it.

709
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:08,440
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says Pixel Poops wouldn't go on the Amico because of the subject matter.

710
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,720
Other YYR games might.

711
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,480
I have the fix for you.

712
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,440
Here you go.

713
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,560
Because they're little brown piles, you're just going to call them pixel dumps.

714
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,080
And that's what it's pixel dumps.

715
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,560
And you're just going to and you change the taco stand to a pixel store and you're just

716
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,760
dumping pixels on the ground.

717
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,120
That's there.

718
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,600
There you go.

719
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,600
See, I made YYR's game Christian friendly.

720
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,160
How about that?

721
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,600
Pixel pocket says you could make it ice cream.

722
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,480
Oh my God.

723
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,080
It would be like the sweat on Mortal Kombat.

724
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:42,600
So now my God, instead of little brown piles on the ground, it would just be little pink

725
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
piles and it's strawberry ice cream.

726
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,680
And then the little taco cabana turns into ice cream cabana.

727
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,200
There you go.

728
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,700
Done.

729
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,000
Oh my God.

730
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,880
YYR, not to give you more work.

731
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,560
But like Pixel Poops now needs a strawberry code.

732
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,800
Or like if you put down right up left YB, it changes it to strawberry ice cream.

733
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:13,400
Orange right says people will be searching for the poop code.

734
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,520
All right.

735
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,040
Anyway, let's move on.

736
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,760
But please check it if you if you are newer to Orange Launch Radio and you don't understand

737
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,360
why we're obsessed with Pixel Poops.

738
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:28,200
It's actually a game that we well, Jamie created and we take credit for.

739
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,720
But Jamie's kind of said this on the show once.

740
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,560
You know, we have this list of dream games that's on our wiki and she threw out that

741
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:35,960
idea.

742
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,360
And then YYR, one of our listeners slash fav game developers ran with it, actually put

743
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,040
out a game called Pixel Poops.

744
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:47,640
And then like if that wasn't enough, then Loki was like, hey, I'm going to make a Pixel

745
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,080
Poops game on the NES.

746
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,360
You know, I've always I've been teasing, making a game for literally six years on the

747
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:52,680
show.

748
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:57,640
And then he releases Pixel Poops 2 on the NES maker.

749
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,880
And it's available on itch.io and Steam.

750
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:06,760
Which I do need to update that to the special editions, because there's stuff, you know,

751
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:12,040
more levels and everything and more characters and other things.

752
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:18,040
I just haven't quite trying to combine that with uploading YouTube stuff every week or

753
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,600
trying to do it every week is that stuff.

754
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,360
But I still want to do that because I have cartridges and I've got labels now.

755
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:24,840
I can't wait.

756
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,440
So physical editions.

757
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,560
Yeah, I can't wait.

758
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,160
That's going to be the must have OLR collectors item, that's for sure.

759
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:36,280
All right, let's move on and get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games

760
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,760
that we have been playing this week, whether it's Pixel Dumps or otherwise.

761
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,520
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

762
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,080
You're muted on hard mute on Discord.

763
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,520
There we go.

764
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,000
There we go.

765
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,040
It was all right.

766
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,800
I played lots of Dead by Daylight.

767
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,640
I played some Pinball.

768
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,760
Wardscapes.

769
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,520
That's it.

770
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,480
No Animal Crossing.

771
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,160
No Animal Crossing?

772
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,240
Two weeks without.

773
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,200
Oh, no.

774
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,400
Is this the beginning of the end?

775
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,080
No, I don't think so.

776
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,000
I just think that I've been really busy.

777
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,200
Understandable.

778
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,800
I'm also surprised, too, like kind of going back to Nintendo Direct, that we didn't hear

779
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,240
any updates on Animal Crossing.

780
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,800
Yeah, it's a little bit surprising, too.

781
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,520
I think like no like version update or something.

782
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,120
Maybe that's coming to like Nintendo Direct or something.

783
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,000
Yeah, yeah.

784
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,680
And also, I didn't watch Treehouse.

785
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,160
They have a lot of stuff, you know, that sometimes they announce in Treehouse.

786
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,200
So maybe it was in there.

787
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,080
I think if they announced something that big, it would have been all over Twitter.

788
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,120
So we've already would have had that.

789
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,760
So I think it's just not.

790
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,880
Yeah, I think if they do anything, it'll be in a separate direct later on or like

791
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,720
they'll do maybe a direct.

792
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,880
I don't want to set expectations unreasonably, but maybe they'll do like in I was gonna say

793
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,080
an indie game direct, but I'm not sure Animal Crossing would fit in with that.

794
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:59,880
So maybe some type of a mini direct that gives updates on a lot of indies and then an Animal

795
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,880
Crossing surprise thrown in there and maybe maybe one other game that gets DLC or something.

796
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,080
So all right.

797
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,840
Let's let's move on to Loki and your gaming week.

798
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,520
Well, it's been Minecraft still.

799
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,000
So actually, a lot of this week was editing, but still a lot of Minecraft.

800
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:25,160
And just basically working on designing the structure that I'm building for inspired by

801
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,960
the session I had with Tango Tech last week.

802
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,200
So just kind of working on that, it's going to I decided originally the concept I had

803
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,960
pitched to him when I was doing it was like, OK, we're going to build a skyscraper type

804
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,600
thing, but instead I'm going with like a industrial factory.

805
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,560
So I've been working on that, doing the redstone for that.

806
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,400
So that'll be coming soon.

807
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,240
I tease at the end of my video.

808
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,560
And so that's what I'm working on.

809
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,960
And we had to be continuing to work on this week.

810
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,600
I'm actually taking some time off from work because because it's not work.

811
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,520
So to play some more during the week.

812
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,800
So I'll be doing that.

813
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,440
And I do want to get back into streaming some more as well.

814
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:10,040
But it's hard to stream when we have cats yelling at us down at their feet.

815
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,100
But yeah.

816
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,460
All right.

817
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,300
My gaming week, I don't really have new games to talk about.

818
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,980
Sadly, I know I was supposed to get on Game Pass to get like Yakuza like a dragon and

819
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:25,580
some of the other stuff, but our bandwidth is a little tight right at the moment.

820
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,780
And I've just I've just been kind of enjoying the games that I have still.

821
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,060
I've actually been playing No Man's Sky again, which is weird because there's not

822
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:37,100
another mission, a special timed mission in there right now.

823
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:41,340
But I want to work on the achievements that I'm missing in that game, because it's really

824
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:44,220
ridiculous that I talk so much about this game and I don't have all the achievements

825
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,220
So I really need to work on those.

826
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,900
So that's kind of been my goal in No Man's Sky.

827
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,540
I've been continuing in Final Fantasy 14.

828
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,700
In fact, I did at least one stream this week.

829
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,820
There might have been two.

830
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,740
I can't remember anymore, but I know I did one just last night and I've been working

831
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:01,420
on some of the classes that are not level 80 yet, building them up.

832
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,940
So like my warrior is one of my last jobs.

833
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:09,180
I have to get to level 80 and I got that to level 51 on stream last night.

834
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,060
So that was pretty cool.

835
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,660
And then continuing in Dead by Daylight a little bit.

836
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,860
I just play a little bit every day.

837
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,660
Shout out to my husband, Alan Alchemy.

838
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,380
He did a stream earlier today for Dead by Daylight.

839
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:24,620
He did his first cosplay stream where he actually dressed up as one of the characters, Ace.

840
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:28,220
He bought all this stuff online that he dressed up as the character.

841
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,940
You can check it out on his channel at Alan Alchemy.

842
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,500
I'm pretty sure his VODs are all open and he has clips too.

843
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:38,380
And I thought that was really adorable that he really poured himself into that.

844
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:43,580
He actually grew out his facial hair a certain way so he could do the cosplay authentically.

845
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,380
That's pretty awesome.

846
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,020
Yeah, right.

847
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:51,820
So and I told him you need to go to Dragon Con so you can use some of these cosplays again.

848
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:58,220
I think Alan may be into the idea of Dragon Con next year.

849
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:02,220
This year's a little too soon and kind of like this year has been being played.

850
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:06,060
It's not necessarily the COVID thing, but it's that this year has been being planned

851
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,580
since 2019.

852
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,660
So it's a little hard for Alan to get it on that.

853
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,980
But he's talking about maybe 2022.

854
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,100
He's actually going to come, especially if he sticks with the streaming things.

855
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,300
That would be really exciting, I think.

856
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,540
And then I feel like I'm missing something for my gaming week,

857
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,660
but it's a lot of the stuff I've talked about before on this show.

858
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,140
I didn't really play anything new this week.

859
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,140
Maybe in the next week I'll finally get the Yakuza like a dragon.

860
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,060
Although I'm actually going to be gone for a couple days next weekend.

861
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,940
Not to toot my own horn, but next weekend is my birthday.

862
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,620
So I'm going to be out of town.

863
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,580
I'm going to be getting back just in time for O.L.R. on Sunday.

864
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,260
So it's going to be a rush show next week.

865
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,540
So that'll be fun.

866
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,040
So, yeah.

867
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,540
All right.

868
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:52,540
Speaking of special show stuff, before I get to the next story,

869
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,460
one thing I want to make sure you all know about,

870
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,060
if you haven't seen on Twitter yet,

871
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:01,740
Loki Dark Sakura and myself are going to be doing a very special presentation

872
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,460
on Wednesday is the 23rd, right?

873
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,660
If I did my math right.

874
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:11,020
So Wednesday night at 7 p.m. Pacific, 10 p.m. Eastern,

875
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,540
we are going to be doing a special stream here at VOG Network

876
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,980
where we listen to Orange Lounge Radio episode one.

877
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,340
And not going to lie, it's going to be a little cringe

878
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,820
because we've come a long way in 19 years.

879
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,740
But that's kind of what it's all about is celebrating how far this show has come

880
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,460
in the 19 years that we've been on the air.

881
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,780
So that is a channel point reward.

882
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,220
You guys raised the points for the live folks here at Twitch.tv

883
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,940
and it was our highest channel point reward ever.

884
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,020
And you guys still raised 150,000 points.

885
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,780
So we're going to do that special stream for you guys.

886
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:47,100
And the Wednesday date is specifically chosen.

887
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:52,860
It's intentional because June 23rd was the first Orange Lounge Radio.

888
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:56,780
Obviously, what day falls on what day of the week changes from year to year.

889
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,580
So June 23rd was a Sunday in 2002.

890
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,860
It's going to be a Wednesday this year,

891
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,820
but that will be the actual 19th birthday.

892
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,340
And Dartetsuya in chat says,

893
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,540
Didn't the show originally start at 7?

894
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,380
It started at 6.30.

895
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,060
So I'm glad you brought that up.

896
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:16,220
Orange Lounge Radio's original time was 6.30 to 8.30.

897
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,740
It was a two-hour show.

898
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:22,940
And then when we were not able to contain ourselves to two hours,

899
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,980
it was 6 to 9.

900
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,340
So and insert your own joke about 6 and 9 here.

901
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,060
So yeah, it was 6.30 to 8.30 when it first started.

902
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,860
So yeah, that is kind of interesting is that when we listen to the show,

903
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,500
it's only going to be two hours worth of show.

904
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,300
And there were music breaks in the beginning.

905
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,180
So and for obvious reasons, we're not going to play those music breaks.

906
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:45,820
We're going to kind of use our skip ahead on the music breaks to just get to the talking parts.

907
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:50,220
So the talking itself may only be about an hour, an hour 15.

908
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:55,100
I don't remember the ratio of music to talking in the early shows.

909
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:59,180
So we will cover all that on Wednesday.

910
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:04,140
I still have to figure out how to play an MP3 so you guys can hear it while I'm broadcasting it.

911
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,300
So I better figure that out before Wednesday.

912
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,160
All right.

913
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,180
Anyhow, one other shout out.

914
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,660
Sorry, I know we won't get into gaming news, but I have some shout outs this week.

915
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,180
I need to make sure I get this one out on air

916
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:18,860
because you can check it out over on their YouTube channel.

917
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:24,940
The Dragon Con Digital Media Track did a special kind of spotlight show

918
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,940
that I was lucky enough to be a guest on.

919
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,780
That was a week ago, but you can now watch on YouTube.

920
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,860
You can watch the interview that Mike did with me.

921
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:39,420
And we just talked about, you know, doing a show for 19 years

922
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,140
and talked a little bit about this upcoming Dragon Con.

923
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,580
And we talked a little bit about, you know,

924
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,780
how has the motivation been there for so long and all that stuff.

925
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:51,260
So I want to just kind of give that a shout out.

926
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:55,580
The link is in the VOG Network Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

927
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,460
Since it's a YouTube link, I can't really read it on air

928
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,020
because, you know, it just has random numbers and letters at the end of it.

929
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,260
But please be on the lookout for that or just check out.

930
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:06,460
Just do like, you know, Dragon Con Digital Media Rob Roberts.

931
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,900
You'll find it if you do a search there.

932
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,460
So look for that.

933
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,540
And then Bobby is asking me to plug.

934
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,020
Oh, thank you.

935
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,900
I actually linked it there in chat for the live folks.

936
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,140
Thank you.

937
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,340
Thank you for those in the podcast.

938
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,140
Just do a search for it.

939
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:16,640
You'll find it.

940
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,340
And then Bobby Black Wolf says,

941
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,220
Oh, and plug Summer Games Done Quick Real Quick 2.

942
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,260
Monday early morning and the Saturday night finale.

943
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,100
I don't think I need to plug Summer Games Done Quick because everybody knows about it.

944
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,100
If you don't know about Summer Games Done Quick,

945
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,260
hello, welcome to video game culture.

946
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,100
There is a very big video game event that happens in the summer and in the winter.

947
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,020
And in the winter, it's called Awesome Games Done Quick.

948
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,020
And in the summer, it's called Summer Games Done Quick.

949
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:44,060
They raise money for charity by doing games quickly.

950
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:48,620
It's not just a clever title, but the speed running community is awesome.

951
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,860
The commentary they do is great.

952
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:52,720
Excuse me.

953
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:59,120
And since it is a charity fundraising thing, there are donations that come in

954
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,880
and somebody has to read those donations and give shout outs live on air.

955
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,840
And one of those many talented somebodies that brings it all together for Summer Games Done Quick

956
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,480
is going to be VOG Network's own Bobby Black Wolf.

957
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,080
And so he will be doing some announcing Monday early, early morning.

958
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,440
Maybe depending on your time zone, it may not be quite the same.

959
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,360
I would say if you're Europe, this is a great chance to catch Bobby Black Wolf

960
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,680
because that'll be middle of the day for you guys.

961
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:28,960
But he's got a block of games on Monday that I know includes Star Tropics 2, I think.

962
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,040
And I know the original Batman on NES is in there as well and some other games as well.

963
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,960
But then the big, big one that Bobby's doing, we're really thrilled for him.

964
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,640
And, you know, it's just for the speed run in general because it's going to be great.

965
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,400
Bobby's hosting the finale, which is Kingdom Hearts 2 this year.

966
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,840
So he'll be there at the very, very end of it all on Saturday night.

967
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,280
So that is going to be awesome.

968
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,840
So congrats to Bobby and best of luck to everybody at the Summer Games Done Quick.

969
00:44:53,840 --> 00:45:01,600
And I believe that is the 4th of July weekend coming up when that all starts.

970
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,640
Remind me of the date real quick.

971
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,880
I know it's not next week, but I think it's the week after.

972
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,480
So if somebody wants to remind me of the date when that starts.

973
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:12,800
Thank you.

974
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,720
Bobby says it's July 4th through 11th.

975
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,440
Okay, that's what I thought.

976
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,280
I thought it started the weekend of July 4th.

977
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,520
Okay, so yeah, be looking out for that.

978
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,560
Okay, now we can get the news.

979
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,600
I'm done with all the announcements.

980
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,400
There was a lot tonight.

981
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,960
So that was our own E3 direct right there.

982
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,840
There you go.

983
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,880
All right, let's move on.

984
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,680
Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?

985
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,360
All right.

986
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:39,840
So starting off, you know, there was some, I guess, issues with the demo for the new

987
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,120
Final Fantasy game that's Strangers in Paradise.

988
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:52,560
So apparently that there was some issues with game corruption or where there's a gate that

989
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,480
was corrupted or something like that.

990
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:02,400
So they've, I guess, been able to unable to boot the game and running into different issues

991
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,840
with it, which is not a good way to present your game.

992
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,400
No, it is not.

993
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,320
Even though, yes.

994
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,040
Sorry, I just I need to get on my tangent about bandwidth caps again.

995
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,520
Because people were burning that game download.

996
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,560
And then it's like I wasted my bandwidth for literally nothing.

997
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:23,440
Now, if I'm not mistaken, you didn't have to re-download the entire thing to fix it.

998
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,880
Am I correct, Bobby?

999
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,600
Because I don't have PS5 still.

1000
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,960
Maybe that'll be fixed this holiday.

1001
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:29,920
We'll see.

1002
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,880
I don't have PS5 still.

1003
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,280
So I don't know.

1004
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,880
Did you have to re-download all 11 gigs or did something kind of trigger on the back

1005
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,800
end where it just figured it out?

1006
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,360
Bobby Blackwell says the patch was not 11 gigs.

1007
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,360
OK, so at least they didn't have to re-download everything.

1008
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,400
That's good, at least.

1009
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,200
But they did it.

1010
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,480
They did at least fix it, though, earlier this week.

1011
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,040
So that was that was nice that that happened.

1012
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:55,280
But still, like, you know, kind of test that before you publish it.

1013
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,640
That's embarrassing.

1014
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,000
That's embarrassing for not just Square, but Sony.

1015
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,560
And just like the PlayStation 5 is a platform.

1016
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:07,600
Sorry, I'm not trying to be a jerk, but that's a really embarrassing mistake.

1017
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,880
Like, how was this not tested?

1018
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,280
What this would look like on a retail PS5?

1019
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,480
I mean, I'm sure it was tested on dev PS5s.

1020
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,120
How was this not tested on a retail PS5?

1021
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,640
It's possible, like if there's some sort of corruption with it, maybe that, you know,

1022
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:30,080
copying something or maybe the transfer to like the server or something caused an issue.

1023
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,600
And so, you know, maybe it was fine on their end, but then they had the I don't know.

1024
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,680
But it is still annoying.

1025
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,880
It's it's it's ridiculous how that all went down.

1026
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,840
Quest Buster in chat says one could say the demo was fraught with chaos.

1027
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,800
Bobby Blackwell says I played it.

1028
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,480
They did have an easy mode, but it's a souls like and it kind of proves why Souls games

1029
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,640
should not have an easy mode because it's kind of boring.

1030
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,840
I got bored and turned it off at some point.

1031
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,880
It was just too repetitive.

1032
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:02,240
No one special 77s in chat and says so Squeenix tossed the demo of Phoenix down.

1033
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,480
Well, they I think they kind of had to because that's

1034
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,200
I mean, it's one thing when your demos bad.

1035
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,000
It's another when your demo just straight up done work.

1036
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:15,600
Can you imagine back in the day, Loki, if you'd bought one of those PlayStation magazines

1037
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,920
with the demo disk and you put the demo disk in your drive and it just goes corrupt file error?

1038
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,420
Sorry.

1039
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,280
Yeah, people would be upset.

1040
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,800
People would be a little bit upset.

1041
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,800
I get that it's different now, but it's I just can't believe that happened.

1042
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,760
Or like one of those.

1043
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,120
What was it where you got the Final Fantasy seven demo with like, yeah,

1044
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,480
Brave Fencer, Masashi, like that file error.

1045
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:36,980
Yes.

1046
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,100
Whoops.

1047
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,000
That was that's that's really just embarrassing for everyone involved.

1048
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,800
I'm sorry.

1049
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,320
Anyway, all right.

1050
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,160
At some point, I'll get a PlayStation five.

1051
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,800
I don't think my birthday I'm going to get one for that, but maybe the holidays.

1052
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,560
Anyway, let's move on and talk.

1053
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,000
Sorry, guys.

1054
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,200
Let's talk a little bit about Niantic, the creators of the game Pokemon Go,

1055
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,520
which I've talked a couple times about on this show.

1056
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,200
They make other games as well.

1057
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,400
Ingress I've talked a little bit about, even though I think that game is kind of lesser known.

1058
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,120
But Ingress is that was their first big game and still,

1059
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,560
I was going to say is still popular, but that might kind of be a lie.

1060
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,760
So is still played.

1061
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,560
We'll say that.

1062
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,120
It's still popular among the people that still play the game.

1063
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,200
Yeah, it's still popular with some people.

1064
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,400
And I would say also Harry Potter, Wizards Unite.

1065
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,360
I'm not sure how well that game is doing, but I think it's well enough.

1066
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,080
It's still going.

1067
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,280
I kind of stopped playing that a long time ago,

1068
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,160
but I know others that still play it and are into it.

1069
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,440
So there's that.

1070
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,040
Those are all the Niantic games that are out now.

1071
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,920
Niantic has also previously announced they are working on a Settlers of Catan game.

1072
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,600
That is still not out.

1073
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,360
I think that one's being tested in New Zealand or something, but that game is still not out.

1074
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:52,000
They also announced very recently they are working on a Pikmin game,

1075
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,360
or at least some type of exploration with Pikmin type of app.

1076
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,760
We're not sure exactly if that means like a game

1077
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,560
or maybe something where you're collecting like things from.

1078
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:04,720
We don't know what that is yet, but we know Niantic is doing something with Pikmin.

1079
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:11,120
Well, it was also announced this week Niantic's got another project in the works.

1080
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:15,680
A Transformers game is the next game coming from Niantic.

1081
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,880
Now this sounds like it might be a little more when I say is coming from Niantic.

1082
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,800
This might be a little more like Niantic and Wizards Unite,

1083
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:29,920
where I actually think Wizards Unite is actively developed by Portkey Games,

1084
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,920
which is a subsidiary of Warner Brothers.

1085
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:39,760
They handle all the Harry Potter stuff and they use Niantic's network of AR portals and ARs.

1086
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:44,000
I say portals because they, you know, built that all on the labor of ingress players

1087
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,120
and now Pokemon Go players a little bit as well, which is why it got worse, but I digress.

1088
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:53,040
I have to ask because now it's been like a long time.

1089
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,720
Yes, an undetermined long time.

1090
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:59,280
So they've finally given you any sort of perks for, you know,

1091
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,280
prestige or whatever in ingress.

1092
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:11,040
If you have their $5 a month sub or whatever it is, then you get one set of rewards if you're

1093
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,120
unrecursed and you get a slightly better set of rewards if you have recursed.

1094
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:19,040
But that involves you have to have their $5 a month sub to see that.

1095
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,400
That's lame.

1096
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:25,120
Yeah, I wish the reward was better for the recursion.

1097
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,360
I, you know, that's ingress.

1098
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,960
And you know what, though?

1099
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,840
You know, as much as I joke about ingress is kind of like, you know,

1100
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,720
it's not really at the level it used to be and all that they are.

1101
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,840
They have announced they are going to start bringing live events back,

1102
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,720
you know, with COVID restrictions, having lessened and vaccines being readily available

1103
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,280
if you want it.

1104
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,200
And again, we here at OLR would encourage all of you to get your vaccinations.

1105
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,360
We've all gotten ours and we're fine.

1106
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,960
And yeah, and far less of a chance to spread COVID when we have that.

1107
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,920
But anyhow, so they're going to be bringing back live events again.

1108
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:03,200
And I think they're doing a van event in Oakland July 9th.

1109
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,280
That's just like a social get together.

1110
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,200
But I think they're doing a mission day on July 11th.

1111
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,000
And that, again, is kind of like you check in at a spot,

1112
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,680
but you're really going outside and exploring the town and doing missions and getting.

1113
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,120
So I think there's that.

1114
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:22,800
And then they are saying in-person anomalies or some other type of in-person PVP events,

1115
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,200
maybe not necessarily anomaly, but some other type of event is going to be coming back.

1116
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,360
It sounds like this year.

1117
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,120
So that's kind of exciting as well.

1118
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,480
So we'll see.

1119
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:33,520
All right.

1120
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,840
Anyway, back to the Transformers game before we got on a tangent there.

1121
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:43,520
I was saying that I think this Transformers game is like the Harry Potter game in that

1122
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,160
Niantic is not the one really actively developing it,

1123
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:51,840
but they are lending their AR expertise and their layout of the world to this game.

1124
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:55,360
Because admittedly, it does work better when you have games,

1125
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,120
because there's been a lot of Pokemon Go,

1126
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:01,280
like rip off games where it's been randomly generated, so to speak.

1127
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,640
And it doesn't usually work out as well.

1128
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:04,960
I don't know.

1129
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,840
Some people really love that Jurassic Park game.

1130
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,520
Oh, the Transformers game?

1131
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,160
Heck yeah.

1132
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:10,720
Heck yeah.

1133
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,360
Right.

1134
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,960
So Transformers.

1135
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,560
Transformers Heavy Metal is supposed to launch globally this year.

1136
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,760
They're going to soft launch it in some countries soon.

1137
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,000
And I guarantee those some countries are Australia,

1138
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,800
New Zealand, because that's where all the Niantic stuff gets piloted.

1139
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:30,560
Seattle-based studio Very Very Spaceship is leading development on this.

1140
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,280
So that's why...

1141
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,400
I love the name of that studio.

1142
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,200
Yeah, I know, right?

1143
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,560
That's why I said, I don't think it's actually Niantic,

1144
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,320
but there's kind of that going on.

1145
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,680
How does this work?

1146
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,040
Here's the description.

1147
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,640
In Transformers Heavy Metal...

1148
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,320
Heavy Metal makes me think of the anime from the 80s, actually.

1149
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,160
That's why I'm in Transformers game.

1150
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:48,640
Yeah, right.

1151
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,280
In Transformers Heavy Metal, players will join the Guardian Network,

1152
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,560
a group of humans who have banded together with the Autobots in a war against the Decepticons.

1153
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:04,240
As a Guardian, players will uncover hidden regions across Earth to find resources and

1154
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:09,120
battle Decepticons in turn-based battles, either solo or with friends.

1155
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,920
The only disappointing part about that description is that it

1156
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,160
sounds like I will not be able to be a Decepticon or root for the Decepticons.

1157
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,560
That is the only unfortunate news.

1158
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,320
But okay, I'll still try it.

1159
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,960
Pretty much any AR game, and I mean any AR game,

1160
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,640
because I've played some fucking trash AR games, Garfield Go.

1161
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,160
I've played some really fucking trash AR games.

1162
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,560
I'll try it at least once.

1163
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:41,680
Just because I love the concept of real-world location AR games.

1164
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,680
I realize AR could also mean hollow lens type stuff,

1165
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,960
where literally the environment around you and what you're seeing is different.

1166
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,360
And I think Niantic is headed that direction if you look at some of their prototype stuff.

1167
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,680
But we're not there yet with these cell phone games.

1168
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,160
So it'll be very interesting.

1169
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,280
So, all right.

1170
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,440
Bobby Blackwell from chat says,

1171
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:07,840
actually, heavy metal wasn't an anime because it was made in the US by Ivan Reitman.

1172
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,080
And then I agree with Dark Sakura.

1173
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,560
Technically, anime stands for animation,

1174
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,920
and US animation is referred to as anime in Japan.

1175
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,420
HA!

1176
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:22,960
I mean, there are tons of words that are really just shortened versions.

1177
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,880
Like, Terebi is television.

1178
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,040
I'm gonna be honest.

1179
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:31,520
I called it an anime because even if it was developed, it kind of looks like an anime to me.

1180
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,400
And I realize that's also very different.

1181
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,640
So, heavy metal is an interesting movie because back in the day, here we go.

1182
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,760
You ready for grandpa to tell a story?

1183
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,440
Back in the day, Dark Sakura and Loki, you'll appreciate this,

1184
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,440
at the Birdcage Cinemas back in the day.

1185
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,480
And then these Sacramento locals.

1186
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,320
Back in the day at the Birdcage Cinema,

1187
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,040
when we used to do the Rocky Horror Picture Show at midnight,

1188
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,520
the midnight movie, the Rocky Horror Picture Show played in theater one.

1189
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,360
You know what played in theater two?

1190
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,880
Every weekend at midnight?

1191
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:03,600
Heavy metal.

1192
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:08,000
So I know that movie very well from back in the day.

1193
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,400
Do you want to know what's funny?

1194
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,040
What's funny?

1195
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,120
I was sneaked in to see it in 1981.

1196
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,640
Oh my god, that's amazing.

1197
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,640
I didn't know what was going on.

1198
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,200
I think I fell asleep, but I remembered the...

1199
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,040
I just remember asking, is that John Candy?

1200
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,400
Because he did a voice.

1201
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,360
I remember for a short while, for sure, I'd say about a year,

1202
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,160
they did Austin Powers Man of Mystery in theater three.

1203
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:40,560
And then I want to say there was another one they tried to do as a midnight movie for a short time,

1204
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,400
because it was one of those things where it was like, if we're going to open...

1205
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,320
Rocky Horror was the only one that people actually went to, by the way.

1206
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,280
Because I remember for...

1207
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,160
I remember one night...

1208
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,760
Sorry, this has nothing to do with games.

1209
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,960
I'm telling the story anyway.

1210
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,520
I remember one night, we had such a big theme night going on.

1211
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,800
We were running into theater two to fucking change

1212
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,640
into one costume to another, because we were out of space in the back part area.

1213
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,680
So it was like, you know what?

1214
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,560
Once you run up the aisle, just go fucking change in the heavy metal theater.

1215
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,280
No one's in there.

1216
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,160
Anyway, all right.

1217
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,160
I have an aside, by the way, about heavy metal.

1218
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,760
Okay, why not?

1219
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,200
I get tangents, you get tangents.

1220
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:23,840
What's your aside?

1221
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,320
So I used to play Rifts.

1222
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,120
It was one of the first tabletop games I ever played.

1223
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:33,120
And our campaign was to find the Lochnar.

1224
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,480
And basically, my character was the only one that lived.

1225
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,520
I played a true neutral character.

1226
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:47,360
She had an anti-gravity trench coat and was playing Tetris

1227
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,680
while the entire party got eaten by ants.

1228
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,400
I love that.

1229
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,800
And then she delivered the Lochnar to whoever had hired them to get it for a lot of money.

1230
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,800
And then that was the last time I ever played Rifts.

1231
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:02,240
Table games really truly only are limited by your imagination.

1232
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,360
That's for sure.

1233
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,040
By the way, speaking of the birdcage,

1234
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,320
while Rocky Horror played in theater one, Heavy Metal would play in theater two,

1235
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,520
and Austin Powers in theater three,

1236
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,200
do you know what was going on in the parking lot?

1237
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,440
Making out.

1238
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:13,940
LARPing.

1239
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,380
Well...

1240
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,160
I LARPed.

1241
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,680
Man, the birdcage being...

1242
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,240
That was a fucking cultural icon here in the Sacramento area.

1243
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,400
If any of our listeners are in Northern California,

1244
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,480
and you're over the age of 30,

1245
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,440
you understand all this reminiscing about the birdcage.

1246
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,360
That was the place, I'll tell you.

1247
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,160
All right.

1248
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,000
Yeah, I just know about his second hand.

1249
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,680
I mean, I was there when birdcage was torn down, but...

1250
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,680
Yeah, you just missed it because they tore it down in, what, 2001?

1251
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,880
No, that was the year you got here.

1252
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,480
So I think you just missed it.

1253
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,600
I was here in 99 because I remember that we watched

1254
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:51,040
X 1999 and End of Evangelion back to back

1255
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,760
when it turned to 2000 and was really depressed.

1256
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,640
I was here.

1257
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,640
The last Rocky Horror at birdcage was 2001.

1258
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,400
So you were here, you just probably never got over there.

1259
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,320
I was here, yeah.

1260
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:02,820
All right.

1261
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:03,780
Anyway...

1262
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:07,840
Because Dan and I used to go to the game room, like, all the time.

1263
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,280
Oh, that arcade was bomb.

1264
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,040
Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

1265
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:11,600
See?

1266
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,800
Had I not mansplained, we wouldn't have had any of these tangents.

1267
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,160
You're welcome, O.L. Army.

1268
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,200
What about all the good things mansplaining did?

1269
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,320
S.J. 100 Matt says,

1270
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,760
We need to bring Travis Donovan in on this memory lane trip.

1271
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,800
Absolutely.

1272
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,520
Absolutely.

1273
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,600
All right, let's move on to our next story.

1274
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,640
Did you want to do this dark soccer?

1275
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,760
You want me to do this?

1276
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,640
You can do it.

1277
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:37,200
Okay, then let's talk about the Epic Game Store and some of the...

1278
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:38,880
I'm sorry, Loki.

1279
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:39,680
Why don't you do this?

1280
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,640
I'm sorry, I noticed it was you.

1281
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,360
I thought I had this.

1282
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:43,460
Nope.

1283
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,520
So there's some...

1284
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:50,240
I don't know if it's leaks or, like, rumors or whatever, but it's...

1285
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:55,760
The database lists Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Alan Wake Remastered

1286
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,280
as titles that are going to be possibly coming out.

1287
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,560
So they're under, like, kind of code names right now.

1288
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:06,560
But if you look at the database, it actually shows, like, the cloud save folder,

1289
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,560
which then has their actual names.

1290
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:14,320
So I like these because, you know, Final Fantasy 7 Remake, that's Pineapple QA.

1291
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:18,640
And then we have Heron staging for Alan Wake Remastered.

1292
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,240
So I guess these are coming.

1293
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:21,760
Just when?

1294
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,120
I am so here for an Alan Wake Remastered.

1295
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,080
I hope it's true.

1296
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,320
I hope they got to keep the licensed music.

1297
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:32,320
That's my other big, like, request because it had an amazing soundtrack.

1298
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:37,280
Like, I'm sorry, I screamed when Pose Haunted actually was in a video game.

1299
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,720
I never thought I'd live to see the day.

1300
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,680
But yeah, and that whole soundtrack was amazing.

1301
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,560
So if they actually got to keep the licensed music and they're doing a remaster,

1302
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,520
I'm so here for it.

1303
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:46,720
Let's hope so.

1304
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:54,480
Yeah, I'm curious to see what abominations we're going to get with Final Fantasy 7

1305
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:59,040
Remastered coming to PC, and then the modding community hits it.

1306
01:00:59,040 --> 01:00:59,680
Oh boy!

1307
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,760
That's going to be interesting!

1308
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:02,720
Can't wait!

1309
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:03,840
It's going to be a lot of fun.

1310
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,340
All right.

1311
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,700
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about...

1312
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,020
Hey, let's talk about the things people are already making.

1313
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:15,060
A game that encourages making your own games.

1314
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:17,460
Game Builder Garage came out for the Nintendo Switch.

1315
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,700
That was another one of those things I meant to get around to this week.

1316
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:22,820
And, you know, just didn't get the time.

1317
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:27,220
And we were kind of wondering, like, how long before people build copyright

1318
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:29,460
questionable things in Game Builder Garage?

1319
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,620
And it was kind of like, well, it maybe...

1320
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:36,500
It seems like it might be too limited to do that kind of stuff.

1321
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,060
Like it's not Dreams, you know, on the PS4.

1322
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:41,780
Like Game Builder Garage is still a little limited in what you can do.

1323
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:44,500
So we weren't sure if there would be a lot, but as it turns out,

1324
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:48,820
no, people are able to make some pretty neat knockoffs in there.

1325
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:56,420
So apparently some Twitter users actually made the 1996 O'Green of Time prototype.

1326
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:57,540
That's amazing.

1327
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:02,500
And a user named Zelda Boy on Twitter made the original SNES Mario Kart.

1328
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:05,940
Apparently recreated that in Game Builder Garage.

1329
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:11,460
Now it looks like I'm looking at the screenshot of it and it doesn't totally look right.

1330
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:16,980
But still the idea that somebody kind of made it and it kind of works is pretty neat.

1331
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:22,100
Anyway, if you want to look up this user on Twitter, their name is Zelda Boy,

1332
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:23,860
but that's B-O-I and then one.

1333
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:28,340
You can see they put the game ID there if you want to check out that game

1334
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:29,860
and with all the controls there.

1335
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:31,460
So I think that's pretty cool.

1336
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:35,220
And yeah, the O'Green of Time prototype link doesn't exactly look right,

1337
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:39,460
but still, I mean, the fact that people are going this far with it is pretty cool.

1338
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:43,460
Yeah, I haven't played Game Builder Garage yet, but my son's still going through it.

1339
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,940
He played through like several different tutorials.

1340
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:48,820
So he's been having me play his games that he's been making with it.

1341
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:52,980
So there's one that he did where it's like a two-player game where you have...

1342
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:55,220
It's like tag, so you have to get away from the one person

1343
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:57,860
and dodge like these balls that are falling down.

1344
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:02,820
And then there was another one he did that was kind of like one of those labyrinth mazes

1345
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,060
where you tilt the marble around.

1346
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:08,980
So he uses the motion controls to control that one.

1347
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:09,620
So that's cool.

1348
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:11,140
He's enjoying it.

1349
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:12,340
All right.

1350
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:13,460
Yeah, I want to check that out.

1351
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,300
We haven't put Pixel Poops 2 on it yet, so, you know.

1352
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:17,700
By the way, one other...

1353
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:20,340
There's an Intend Dogs prototype that somebody made as well.

1354
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:22,180
Japanese user made that.

1355
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:23,940
So that's pretty cool.

1356
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:26,660
So anyway, I definitely have to check out the Game Builder Garage.

1357
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:28,900
For nothing else, I just want to play other people's games.

1358
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,820
People are very creative.

1359
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:32,180
It's not a full-price game either.

1360
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:34,580
I think it's $30 or $40.

1361
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:35,860
Oh, that's even better.

1362
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:37,860
Yeah, so it's definitely worth checking out.

1363
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:38,580
Absolutely.

1364
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:39,300
All right, moving on.

1365
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:39,800
Loki.

1366
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:48,580
All right, so Cyberpunk 2077 has been littered with bugs and problems.

1367
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:53,860
And you may remember last year they had pulled it from the PlayStation Store because it was so broken.

1368
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:56,420
Well, it's finally coming back.

1369
01:03:57,140 --> 01:04:02,820
So you can actually now check it out for the PlayStation 4 now.

1370
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:04,820
I don't think they have a dedicated PlayStation...

1371
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:08,340
Well, yeah, obviously they don't have a dedicated PlayStation 5 or Series X version yet.

1372
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:11,380
But it's coming.

1373
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:13,940
So the wait...

1374
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:17,380
I don't even know what the timeline was because I know that was supposed to be March originally.

1375
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,340
And then they pushed it back.

1376
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:24,020
I don't know if that's still August or something, but I haven't played it in a while.

1377
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:30,020
It's been probably six months since I played that game because I've been just waiting for it to be fully patched.

1378
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:31,300
Yeah, I don't blame you.

1379
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:35,700
But that's great that they can actually get the sales from PlayStation now.

1380
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:41,380
Although, you know, based on other stories, it doesn't sound like the game got hurt as bad as we thought it would.

1381
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:43,300
I mean, yes, they had to do some refunds.

1382
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:44,260
They did quite a few of those.

1383
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:48,900
But it sounded to me like the game was still, for all intents and purposes, successful.

1384
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:56,500
Despite all these, you know, launch horror stories and the fact that I got pulled from the PlayStation shop.

1385
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,820
And now that's just, you know, more money for them to bring in.

1386
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:01,460
They probably won't put this game on sale for quite some time.

1387
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:06,660
I would imagine this holiday will start to see some sales on this game, which is about the time I'll start to look at it.

1388
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:12,820
But, you know, because like Loki's kind of also saying there, when it gets the patches and all that stuff, I might be more into it.

1389
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:14,980
It's going to be a great game once it gets the patches.

1390
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:19,620
It's just, you know, it had a lot of promise, like with the concept for it.

1391
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:21,780
But they just kind of cut a lot of corners.

1392
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:36,980
So if they're able to kind of pull, I mean, it's hard to say if they pull a no man's sky and just completely bring, you know, if they at least like kind of meet us a little bit halfway there or something, you know, with like fixing, especially like the police AI, which I know was on the list of things to do.

1393
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:51,700
So it's not so cheap, or if like I'm starting, you know, to get my crime level up or whatever, I don't have police officers teleporting right behind you, I'm sitting on the ledge of a building, you know, like ridiculous stuff like that, like, then that would be fine.

1394
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,220
I don't know, I'll go back to it eventually.

1395
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:57,140
But it was it was a pretty good game.

1396
01:05:57,140 --> 01:05:58,980
It's just a pretty buggy game.

1397
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:01,300
Some more comments on Cyberpunk in our chat room.

1398
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:05,860
Quest Buster says the biggest damage was to CD Projekt's reputation.

1399
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:08,660
But from their fiscal reports, they made bank on the game.

1400
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:12,500
And Bobby Blackwell says CP 2077 was still a financial success.

1401
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:21,460
And I think it really does go a long way to underscore the fact that, you know, internet rage on Twitter, Facebook and all that stuff.

1402
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:23,140
It doesn't mean shit.

1403
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:27,540
What really matters is if you buy the game or not.

1404
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:36,020
And if you give the money or not, it really matters what's coming out of your wallet or staying in your wallet at the end of the day, if you're complaining about it on Twitter and then buy the game anyway.

1405
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:37,060
Congrats, you did nothing.

1406
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:45,940
So I mean, you know, and sometimes I mean, with the Cyberpunk stuff, I that's one of those ones where I kind of understand why people were pissed off with that.

1407
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:51,460
But there's other things where I'm always like, you know, why are people they're going to buy the game anyway?

1408
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:55,940
Why are people complaining about if they show a Breath of the Wild 2 trailer at E3 or not?

1409
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:56,340
Shut up.

1410
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:57,620
You're going to buy the game anyway.

1411
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:58,580
And, you know, tea.

1412
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:03,540
All right, let's move on.

1413
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:22,820
Let's talk about the Xbox Series X and S, because, you know, they've talked about how the X and S titles are, you know, they still want to support the Xbox One, even though they want to make games that are really only technically possible on the Xbox X and S.

1414
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:24,420
So what happens to Xbox One?

1415
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:37,300
And I remember suggesting on a prior episode, and I'm sure I'm not the only one to do this, that, well, if Microsoft's getting into this cloud thing, then why would the Xbox One at some point not just become the way you play games on the cloud?

1416
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:38,180
Well, guess what?

1417
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:39,380
Guess what?

1418
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:42,980
It looks like that is actually the direction that Microsoft is going.

1419
01:07:43,940 --> 01:08:01,780
Will Tuttle from Microsoft kind of confirmed in a Xbox news post at news.xbox.com that Xbox One owners will get to play many, so they don't want to commit to all, but many Xbox Series X and S titles through cloud gaming.

1420
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:06,900
We don't know what the details look like yet, but I guess in the future we'll know more about how this works.

1421
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:12,100
And we kind of, you know, we have an idea through some of these test programs and stuff what that might look like.

1422
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:20,820
You know, and again, this, I, you know, even though it's been speculation, they've kind of hinted this is where it's been going before.

1423
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:24,820
Phil Spencer had mentioned in an interview that he did with Kotaku in October.

1424
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:31,300
Game streaming could help bridge generations and let Xbox One users play the latest titles.

1425
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:35,780
My big shock is that they wouldn't put a cloud gaming player on Xbox 360.

1426
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:36,980
Why not?

1427
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:41,620
Maybe, maybe it isn't, I don't, how could, how can...

1428
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:42,740
Maybe it can't handle that.

1429
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:45,220
Maybe it really can't, or maybe the, are the controllers too different?

1430
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:45,460
Maybe?

1431
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:51,300
I don't know, but I, I would just, I would just be surprised they wouldn't even put a cloud gaming player on the Xbox 360.

1432
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:52,580
They might though.

1433
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:54,260
I don't rule it out.

1434
01:08:55,460 --> 01:09:02,660
But maybe they're also thinking there's not quite the, you know, Xbox 360s are starting to kind of like stop working and stuff like that.

1435
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:04,900
So maybe they don't think they'd get the game for the buck.

1436
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:14,900
And I, I don't think that like, because that's a couple generations back, like I get it that, you know, they probably still want you to at least upgrade.

1437
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:22,660
And my concern I think with the Xbox 360 would be storage because the hard drives on those weren't very large.

1438
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:23,060
True.

1439
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:28,500
And so to be able to, you know, store or cache, you know, I guess with game streaming it's not a big deal.

1440
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:36,100
But like, I think maybe they just want you to upgrade to the, at least the Xbox One to be able to run that stuff.

1441
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:39,620
Because maybe those processors are just really old and maybe storage is an issue with those.

1442
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:44,420
But they probably also just want to sell at least some of those consoles.

1443
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:46,020
At the very least, like, you know, the last gen.

1444
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:53,140
And I mean, even now, I don't know what like an original Xbox One goes for, but like, I can't imagine it's super expensive at this point.

1445
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:54,020
Not at this point.

1446
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:56,180
I want to get to this comment in chat.

1447
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:59,300
Ninja The Monkey in chat says, well, look at the Game Pass.

1448
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:03,700
Most of the newer editions are for X and S, but you can still play it on the One.

1449
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:04,180
Yes.

1450
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:11,220
And Microsoft kind of promised that in the beginning is that we're going to still be developing titles that are playable on both.

1451
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:13,300
Like Halo Infinite is playable on both.

1452
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:15,300
And this has nothing to do with cloud gaming.

1453
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:21,300
This is just the whole, like, you know, a modern PC will play it super well at these settings.

1454
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,900
But on an older PC, it'll look less great, right?

1455
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,660
The frame rate might not be quite as smooth.

1456
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:29,940
You might have the same draw distance and all that stuff, but you'll still be able to play the game.

1457
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:33,860
Honestly, same deal with PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, right?

1458
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:36,020
Like they announced Horizon Forbidden West.

1459
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:38,020
It's going to be on PlayStation 5, but guess what?

1460
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,540
They're also going to put it on PlayStation 4.

1461
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:52,340
But I think what we're looking ahead to is that Microsoft may not want to keep developing that way through the entire lifespan of the series X and S.

1462
01:10:52,340 --> 01:11:02,020
There's going to come a point where this game and this vision that we have, this Forza Motorsport 8, I think is the game that's breaking it, to be perfectly frank.

1463
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:05,220
This game won't play on the One.

1464
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:07,140
It is too powerful.

1465
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:09,380
It needs a series X and S.

1466
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:17,300
And I, you know, I say that very specifically because they were demoing Forza Motorsport in the early days of the Xbox Series X.

1467
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:19,060
We're getting Horizon instead.

1468
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:22,260
Motorsport has mysteriously disappeared and been delayed.

1469
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:26,180
And I think it's because that is the game they cannot get working on the Xbox One.

1470
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:31,380
And so they have decided, fuck it, we're going to delay it until we no longer need to put it out on the Xbox One.

1471
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:41,380
And our cloud gaming system is in place that will now allow you to do Forza Motorsport 8 or whatever it is on the Xbox One through the magic of cloud gaming.

1472
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,380
So that's that's my guess.

1473
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:47,700
Anyway, Bobby Blackwolf also, oh, this is OK.

1474
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:50,260
Now, this is a really good theory about the 360.

1475
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:57,300
The Xbox 360's Ethernet port is only a well, he actually corrects it and says, OK, it is a 100 megabyte port.

1476
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,940
I think that it's not a gigabit port.

1477
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:03,060
That's why it has a different color in my router.

1478
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,460
OK, that that makes no sense.

1479
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:06,260
Gigabit port.

1480
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:09,540
Yeah, that makes sense then that it's just not fast enough.

1481
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:11,620
The parts inside to handle cloud stuff.

1482
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:12,020
All right.

1483
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:12,420
I got you.

1484
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:12,900
I got you.

1485
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:16,500
Yeah, it can work for Netflix, but maybe not X cloud.

1486
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:16,980
I get it.

1487
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:17,620
I get it.

1488
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:17,940
All right.

1489
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:18,660
Anyway, good.

1490
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:19,780
All right.

1491
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:20,500
Well, OK.

1492
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:22,820
I think we've talked about the cloud.

1493
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:26,020
I think it's time to go back and talk about something a little retro.

1494
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:43,220
Time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault.

1495
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:45,940
And pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1496
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:48,580
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1497
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:52,580
And what did you pick this week, Dark Sakura?

1498
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:57,460
I picked a kind of fan game.

1499
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:01,380
It was a freeware role playing game.

1500
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:09,460
And it was presented as an official sequel to Barkley Shut Up and Jam and Space Jam.

1501
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,980
And it's called Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gaiden.

1502
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:15,300
And it's weird.

1503
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:23,220
If I was doing a weird home game of the month, this one would be on it.

1504
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:25,620
We have this in my background not too long ago.

1505
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:27,220
Yeah.

1506
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:37,140
So anyway, you basically are playing as Charles Barkley and a few secondary characters.

1507
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:41,860
It's it's interesting.

1508
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:51,620
So basically, it has a play system called, I guess it would be pronounced BABY,

1509
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:53,140
but it's B-A-B-B-Y.

1510
01:13:53,140 --> 01:14:01,220
BABY maybe system that the battle system was influenced by a lot of the JRPGs.

1511
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:07,380
So the enemies will appear on the game field and run at your player.

1512
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:10,980
And they will attack you if you move into their line of sight.

1513
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:14,820
And then you have a battle and you have attacks and skills.

1514
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:21,780
And basically, you also do have timed button presses like in the Mario RPG series.

1515
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:24,820
And some are accuracy based.

1516
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:26,740
So, I mean, it's your general game.

1517
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:29,700
Apart from that weirdness.

1518
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:39,300
So you're playing in 2041, 12 years prior to the main part of the game

1519
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:43,060
in this post cyber-apocalyptic Neo New York.

1520
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:48,660
Where Charles Barkley does a chaos dunk at a baseball game

1521
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:51,860
and inadvertently kills with the people who are there.

1522
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:56,260
So basketball gets outlawed and basketball players are hunted down and killed.

1523
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:01,380
So basically, that's the beginning premise.

1524
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:07,620
Someone else does another chaos dunk later and Charles Barkley is blamed for it.

1525
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:13,220
And so there is a hunt by the b-ball removal department led by Michael Jordan.

1526
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:22,020
And I'm going to leave it there because it apparently goes really, really weird.

1527
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:28,180
So like, I mean, it's got a very involved story,

1528
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:35,700
but the whole thing is that it came apart as a sort of joke based on

1529
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:39,460
an awkward phrase on Michael Jordan's Wikipedia page.

1530
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:43,780
So it was developed by Tales of Games Studios.

1531
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:48,980
They were members from Amateur Game Development Forum.

1532
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:52,260
And that phrase was about whether,

1533
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:57,300
it was about the fan debate over whether or not Space Jam was canon

1534
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:01,060
without specifying if it was talking about the Looney Tunes series

1535
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:03,140
or Michael Jordan's life in general.

1536
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:11,060
So some of the members, and I'll give the names, was Chef Boyardee, Bort, Jeezy.

1537
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:14,660
When I hear Bort, all I think is the Blort, which is what I call the blight.

1538
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:21,460
And QuackGyver all had some work in developing the game.

1539
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:24,180
And there were a few other minor contributions.

1540
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:31,220
And it was first developed in RPG Maker 2003 and ported to Game Maker 6.1.

1541
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:35,860
It was planned to be released for both, but eventually only came out

1542
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:39,220
through Game Maker 6.1 because of power and flexibility.

1543
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:42,340
And it also was,

1544
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:52,340
at the 2014 Games Done Quick, the guys behind it said they never played

1545
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:54,580
the original Shut Up and Jam.

1546
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:56,100
Sorry, I can't make words today.

1547
01:16:56,180 --> 01:17:00,180
But they said that the thought of that RPG would make them laugh,

1548
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:01,060
and that's why they did it.

1549
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:07,540
So, Tales of Games in 2012 announced a sequel called

1550
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:12,180
The Magical Realms of Ternanog Escape from Necron 7,

1551
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:15,220
Revenge of Cocolon, the official game of the movie,

1552
01:17:15,220 --> 01:17:17,860
Chapter 2 of the Hoops Barclay Saga.

1553
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:18,980
That's the full name.

1554
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:22,260
Had crowdfunding on Kickstarter to start it.

1555
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:36,500
It ended, the Kickstarter ended on December 28th and raised $120,335.

1556
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:44,740
And they were doing everything from scratch to avoid copyright issues.

1557
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:49,220
But the majority of the developers left the project,

1558
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:54,580
and that development is going slowly because only two people are behind it right now,

1559
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:56,740
and there's some very poor management going on.

1560
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,140
So we'll see if it actually happens.

1561
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:05,700
But yeah, as far as release dates, this came out January 22nd, 2008,

1562
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:08,900
which means it's permitted.

1563
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:14,580
And it was released on Windows and Mac OS X.

1564
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:18,500
And that's it.

1565
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:20,180
All right.

1566
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,100
It's weird, isn't it?

1567
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:24,340
It is very weird, that is for sure.

1568
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:28,420
Yeah, I'm reading some of the comments.

1569
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:31,140
I just think it's funny that he's talking to Larry Bird in there,

1570
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:32,420
who's wearing a fedora.

1571
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:32,920
Oh, yeah.

1572
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:36,260
I'm reading some of the comments in chat.

1573
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:39,300
I guess this is actually a very timely sort of pick.

1574
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,860
I didn't realize this because, well, for what they're all saying,

1575
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:43,620
like, this game's 10 years old, what?

1576
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:47,220
But apparently, and I know this, Questbuster says

1577
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:52,900
they even had a widely successful Kickstarter for a sequel that never materialized.

1578
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:57,060
And Bobby says they literally canceled it two weeks ago and released all the code.

1579
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:58,500
Is that not what I just said?

1580
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:01,140
Oh, it's not AFK for just a moment.

1581
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:01,640
I'm sorry.

1582
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:02,820
Okay.

1583
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:05,940
I said that in talking about the game.

1584
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:06,180
Got it.

1585
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:06,580
My bad.

1586
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:10,820
But I didn't know it was canceled, so thanks to Bobby.

1587
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:11,460
Okay.

1588
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:12,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1589
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:12,660
Okay.

1590
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:17,060
So and then there's a whole little update on the particular itch.io there.

1591
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:18,340
So, yeah.

1592
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:24,180
I would advise the chat not to make a comment about the history of the game

1593
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:25,540
until I'm done with my segment.

1594
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:27,320
Just saying.

1595
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:28,520
All right.

1596
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:30,660
What is this?

1597
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:31,540
I'm trying to see what is this?

1598
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:33,300
Sadly, no one is streaming this.

1599
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:36,820
I don't know if that's the discussion about the game or what that is.

1600
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:37,460
So, okay.

1601
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:39,620
But yeah, there it is.

1602
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:40,580
Classic game of the week.

1603
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:43,300
A very unique pick because I just...

1604
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:46,420
It looks good though for design.

1605
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:46,980
No, for sure.

1606
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:50,340
For something that's kind of like indie made or whatever.

1607
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:53,300
It definitely looks polished.

1608
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:56,420
I think is a good way to put it for something that's a homegrown

1609
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:57,780
and RPG maker type of thing.

1610
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:00,660
And obviously it's a hilarious concept, that's for sure.

1611
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:02,500
So, all right.

1612
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:06,900
Let's move on and get to some rapid fire news.

1613
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:09,540
We're going to travel around the industry quickly

1614
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:11,780
and check out some other quick headlines.

1615
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:14,420
And let's get to Loki starting off with you.

1616
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:17,620
Yeah, so the Xbox design lab is back.

1617
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:22,020
So you may remember they had something similar back with the Xbox One

1618
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:24,340
and I think even Xbox 360 controllers.

1619
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,900
Maybe it's just Xbox One controllers.

1620
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:31,540
But where you basically can go onto this design lab, customize colors,

1621
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:34,100
add your gamertag, all that stuff.

1622
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:38,980
And they'll actually ship you a completed controller in that color scheme.

1623
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:44,580
So that was originally something that was available for, I think, the Xbox One controllers.

1624
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:49,460
And then obviously the Xbox Series X came out and Series S

1625
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:51,860
and the controllers were slightly different.

1626
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:56,580
So they actually had stopped accepting the custom controllers

1627
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:59,860
for about eight months or so back in October.

1628
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:01,780
But it's back now.

1629
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:04,500
So now you can get your own Xbox Series X controller

1630
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:07,940
in gaudy colors if you want, which is cool.

1631
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:12,980
And those cost $70 with free shipping or $10 extra

1632
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:15,060
if you want to engrave your gamertag on there.

1633
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:23,300
And then GTA Online is going to be shut down on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on December 16th.

1634
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:25,780
Honestly, I'm surprised it hasn't already.

1635
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:31,700
But in case you're still playing it on the Xbox 360 and PS3, it's going to be shut down.

1636
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:35,940
I thought that they stopped getting updates on those consoles.

1637
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:39,620
So, yeah, once again, very surprised that that's still a thing.

1638
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:45,460
But wow, so many generations in with just one Grand Theft Auto game.

1639
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:46,660
I am very disappointed.

1640
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:51,700
Yeah, I keep forgetting that that was actually all the way back to PlayStation 3.

1641
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:52,740
That's so wild.

1642
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:54,980
It's going to probably be 10 years old here.

1643
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:58,660
Well, it came out in 2010.

1644
01:21:58,660 --> 01:21:59,300
No, not 10.

1645
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:00,980
It was a while ago.

1646
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:05,460
I don't think it's been 10 years yet, but it's been a while.

1647
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:09,140
So I'm not surprised.

1648
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:13,940
Before we get to Jamie's stories, the Xbox thing, can I go back there real quick?

1649
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:17,220
Because I think it's great that we can make the custom controllers,

1650
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:20,100
but I'm still irritated we can't get that Pride controller.

1651
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,500
Why can't I make that in the custom shop?

1652
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:24,260
Because I like their approach to it.

1653
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:26,900
They didn't just put one rainbow thing.

1654
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:30,740
They kind of did all this abstract, more type of style to it.

1655
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:31,300
I love it.

1656
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:33,300
And I wish I could get that as a controller.

1657
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:35,220
But whatever.

1658
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:39,940
It was for influencers only, and I don't count, so whatever.

1659
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:41,620
Anyway, let's move on.

1660
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:42,980
DarkSakura for Rapid Fire News.

1661
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:43,620
What do you have for us?

1662
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:52,100
Amazon has a gaming service called Luna that has, I guess, a beta out for it right now.

1663
01:22:53,140 --> 01:23:00,020
That's no invite access on Prime Day, which is June 21st and 22nd.

1664
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:03,220
Prime subscribers can start a seven-day trial

1665
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:08,100
and get discounts on the Luna controller and Fire TV bundle.

1666
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:13,860
It costs $5.99 a month and includes some really new games.

1667
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:26,500
The dedicated controller is discounted from $249 from the list price for $70 for Prime members.

1668
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:28,820
The controller is $70?

1669
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:31,640
Yeah.

1670
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:36,180
And I'm not going to use it because I like Stadia.

1671
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:42,340
Yeah, I think I've learned my lesson with buying controllers for streaming systems.

1672
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:48,900
Also, Bayonetta 3 had a teaser.

1673
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:49,620
It exists.

1674
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:55,780
It is progressing well according to the developers.

1675
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:58,660
So it will be out eventually.

1676
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:02,980
Or so they claim.

1677
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:05,700
I'll believe it when I see it.

1678
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:07,700
I hope so.

1679
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:11,540
I guess, man, the pandemic must really be, you know, because there's that part of me

1680
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:14,660
that just wants to instinctively go, what's taking them so damn long?

1681
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:17,220
But then I'm like, oh, yeah, COVID happens.

1682
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:18,340
It's still happening, really.

1683
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:23,860
And it's no joke, the type of influence that's had on things.

1684
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:25,700
So, yeah.

1685
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:31,060
But and, you know, Bayonetta, one of the best games of the year when it released.

1686
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:33,540
Bayonetta 2, one of the best games of the year when it released.

1687
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:37,460
So Bayonetta 3, like, the expectations are pretty high.

1688
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:41,780
So I guess it's going to take a little while for a cake like that to really sit in the

1689
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:43,860
oven and reach its full potential.

1690
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:44,500
That's for sure.

1691
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:45,560
Okay.

1692
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:50,100
Anyway, let's talk about some games we're going to be playing a little sooner than Bayonetta

1693
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:53,220
3 as we get into some release dates.

1694
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:54,980
Loki, let's start with you in the US.

1695
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:56,500
Yeah.

1696
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,100

01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:01,620

1728
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:08,100
I'm trying to figure out what game that is.

1729
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:09,780
That is...

1730
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:10,340
That looks like...

1731
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:16,820
Oh, it looks like a tactical game involving like nautical battle and things like that.

1732
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:19,140
Like air to sea, sea to air type of stuff.

1733
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:20,420
So interesting.

1734
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:21,940
Okay.

1735
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:22,900

1750
01:27:56,100 --> 01:28:00,020
Pretty much a very repetitive what also released on the Switch.

1751
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:03,540
And Samurai Warriors 5 also out in Japan this week.

1752

I am not sure if Dark Soccer is there to do the UK releases.

1753
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:09,380
So, oh, hi.

1754
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:09,540
Okay.

1755
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:10,420
So let's go to the UK.

1756
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:12,820
All right.

1757
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:17,460

Tony Hawk was on the 25th.

1771
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:42,020

Lots of games every country this week.

1780
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:01,620
Not a slow week, that's for sure.

1781
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:02,420
Awesome.

1782
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:02,980
All right.

1783
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:03,540
Let's move on.

1784
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:05,140
We have a few more headlines for you guys.

1785
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:08,340
Before we get to some of your feedback via Discord.

1786
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:09,140
The mail...

1787
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:10,420
I don't know if we have emails this week.

1788
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:10,920
We'll find out.

1789
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:15,540
And of course our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

1790
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:17,620
But first, Loki.

1791
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:20,500
This is the headline of all headlines, right?

1792
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:21,380
It is.

1793
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:22,500
I mean, it's finally out.

1794
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,860
The Atari VCS.

1795
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:24,580
You can buy it.

1796
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:26,260
I've been waiting for so long.

1797
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:31,220
It's $300 or $400 if you want it like in Walnut

1798
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:34,180
with the kind of like retro controller in there as well.

1799
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:37,620
Uh, yeah.

1800
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:38,420
Or no, I'm sorry.

1801
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:41,540
With the the Xbox gamepad type thing that's in there.

1802
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:45,620
Um, what's it do?

1803
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:47,780
It's a PC.

1804
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:48,980
It's a Ryzen PC.

1805
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:50,820
Or at least it has a Ryzen chip in it.

1806
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:52,260
What can you run on it?

1807
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:53,400
No idea.

1808
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:55,400
It...

1809
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:58,100
I don't want it.

1810
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:02,500
I wonder, I wonder if they got it when it comes down to like $50.

1811
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:03,860
But like, I'm not buying that.

1812
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:07,140
The last headline I saw on this was that Atari VCS

1813
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:09,380
was doing like a partnership with Antstream,

1814
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:11,700
the classic game streaming service,

1815
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:14,900
to have Atari stuff that was like only playable on VCS.

1816
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:17,140
Like the VCS is going to have its own version of Antstream

1817
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:22,100
because they were slowly adding some Atari titles to Antstream.

1818
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:24,500
But certainly there's a lot more that they didn't put on there.

1819
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:27,940
I wonder if that actually happened or not.

1820
01:30:27,940 --> 01:30:28,820
Oh, it did.

1821
01:30:28,820 --> 01:30:29,700
Okay, it did.

1822
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:30,180
It did.

1823
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:32,020
But it also has 100 games bundled with it.

1824
01:30:32,020 --> 01:30:33,540
So 100 Atari games.

1825
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:34,660
Retro Atari games.

1826
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:37,140
I'm sure that's worth $300.

1827
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:41,620
I don't know if I was gonna spend $400 on something like that.

1828
01:30:41,620 --> 01:30:44,420
I would get a 1UP cabinet, to be honest.

1829
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:48,420
But it's a hard sell.

1830
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:50,260
I don't know.

1831
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:53,860
At least it looks nice.

1832
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:55,060
I mean, if it's a decent...

1833
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:55,700
If it can like...

1834
01:30:56,580 --> 01:31:00,260
If I only wanted like something to like hack apart to like play retro games,

1835
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:01,940
I mean, it's a cool looking console.

1836
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:04,660
But not at that price.

1837
01:31:06,820 --> 01:31:10,580
Yeah, I just don't know what I would really need this for.

1838
01:31:10,580 --> 01:31:14,340
I mean, I guess, yeah, it's like the tiny little computer of itself.

1839
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:15,380
But I don't know.

1840
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:17,860
I'm not sure the place it has.

1841
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:20,500
But we'll see how it does.

1842
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:22,340
Maybe there's other people that'll have a place for it.

1843
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:22,820
Who knows?

1844
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:23,860
Who knows?

1845
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:24,900
All right.

1846
01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:28,260
Podculture says Ryzen Mobile CPU, isn't it?

1847
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:29,700
All right.

1848
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:37,540
All right, moving on to a story about Squeenix and the release of Outriders.

1849
01:31:37,540 --> 01:31:39,780
This was a game that I checked out on Game Pass.

1850
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:40,260
Just...

1851
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:43,060
I don't know if I would have normally bought this kind of game,

1852
01:31:43,060 --> 01:31:46,500
but because it was on Game Pass, I checked it out and I did enjoy it enough.

1853
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,020
One of these days, I need to go back to it.

1854
01:31:48,740 --> 01:31:54,580
And maybe there's a lot of people like me out there, because during a recent investors meeting,

1855
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:59,780
President and Representative Director Yosuke Matsuda said that despite whatever bugs were

1856
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:03,940
there at launch, Outriders has gotten off to a good start as a new IP.

1857
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:11,300
Going on to say that they are pleasantly surprised at the digital sales that the title has been

1858
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:12,260
getting has been high.

1859
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:15,540
The number of active users has beaten expectations.

1860
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:20,580
They also say the decision to make the game available through Game Pass as soon as the

1861
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:24,980
title launch has worked in its favor of building an install base.

1862
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:28,580
Now, this could mean some...

1863
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:32,340
Square Enix kind of seeing that this could mean some interesting things for the Xbox

1864
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:34,180
Game Pass model going forward.

1865
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:38,740
I'm not saying we're in suddenly see something like Final Fantasy 16, obviously, because

1866
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:40,660
that's going to be a PlayStation exclusive out the gate.

1867
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:44,340
But I'm just saying it is interesting now, and I'm sure other companies are going to

1868
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:48,260
kind of see that where it's like, oh, the benefits of getting a huge install base out

1869
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:50,100
the gate may be worth it.

1870
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:53,940
I bet at some point they delist Outriders from Game Pass.

1871
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:56,020
And it's like, hey, you want to keep playing?

1872
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:59,460
Now you got to pony up the money, but we'll see, I guess.

1873
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:08,580
So anyway, in mid-May, Outriders had 3.5 million players in the first month of release.

1874
01:33:09,380 --> 01:33:13,540
And then apparently there was average play times of over 30 hours.

1875
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:14,420
That's still pretty good.

1876
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:19,860
If you are not on Game Pass and you want to check the game out, there is still a demo

1877
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:22,100
that is available on all platforms.

1878
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:23,460
So you can check that out.

1879
01:33:24,260 --> 01:33:24,760
Pretty cool.

1880
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:26,120
All right.

1881
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:27,620
Let's see.

1882
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:29,380
Going to some comments from our chat.

1883
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:33,460
Questbuster in chat says the only problem is Outriders end game, which needs some work.

1884
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:36,820
I've heard that complaint elsewhere as well.

1885
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:41,060
And yeah, I wonder if there isn't going to be an expansion.

1886
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:42,020
You know what?

1887
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:42,820
I bet that's it.

1888
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:46,900
I bet they don't pull the game from Game Pass, but they release an expansion.

1889
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:49,860
And then that's where they're really going to make some money from the install base.

1890
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:53,300
And then an expansion can kind of tweak end game things, right?

1891
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:55,620
Like that's what we saw happen with Diablo 3.

1892
01:33:55,620 --> 01:33:59,460
Diablo 3 got a way better end game because of an expansion.

1893
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:02,980
And so I could see that maybe be in their solution to the problem.

1894
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:04,260
We'll see what happens with that.

1895
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:09,060
Anyway, sj100matt says I finished the main game, but I haven't touched the post-game

1896
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:10,020
excursions at all.

1897
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:12,980
I guess again, that speaks to the end game.

1898
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:17,460
I just really liked the blend of a little bit of Borderlands with Gears of War.

1899
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:20,500
And Questbuster is saying I'd love an expansion for Outriders.

1900
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:24,820
So I kind of see that could be the secret there.

1901
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:25,700
So we'll see.

1902
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:26,340
We'll see.

1903
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:27,460
Anyhow, Loki.

1904
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:31,860
You're muted, Justino.

1905
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:33,140
Sorry.

1906
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:38,740
So let's talk about some limited run games that are immediate and some physical versions of those.

1907
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:42,100
So they have their own E3 presentation as well.

1908
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:46,100
Some of our notable things, like we actually have a Turbo Duo game.

1909
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:51,860
So Castlevania Rondo Blood is getting a new special edition physical release for the Turbo

1910
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:52,580
Duo.

1911
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:55,380
And then we have Castlevania Requiem for PlayStation 4.

1912
01:34:57,540 --> 01:34:59,220
Axiom Verge 2.

1913
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:04,260
We've got River City Girls, Girls 2, and River City Girls 0.

1914
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:07,140
Shantae 1 through 5.

1915
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:10,900
Skatebird, which really should be called Skateburb, but you know.

1916
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:15,540
Zombies Ate My Neighbors and Ghoul Patrol is getting a physical version on Switch.

1917
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:19,300
Superhot also getting a version on Switch as well.

1918
01:35:20,180 --> 01:35:22,820
And yeah, lots of titles.

1919
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:28,420
There was, I think, a total of like, you know, like 15 or 20 titles, 25 new titles that are

1920
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:29,060
in there.

1921
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:32,980
So pretty amazing that they're still kind of pushing all of the physical release stuff

1922
01:35:32,980 --> 01:35:35,460
and also like, you know, the Turbo Duo version.

1923
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:36,420
That's kind of neat.

1924
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:42,340
Yeah, it's so fascinating what that company has been doing for like retro game collections,

1925
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:46,420
like just putting out the actual, you know, turbo graphics card and things like that.

1926
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:48,260
It's just, it's fascinating to me.

1927
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:49,140
I love it, though.

1928
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:49,540
I love it.

1929
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:55,700
I think that, I think they sort of, I think Limited Run kind of gets the secret sauce

1930
01:35:55,700 --> 01:36:00,660
about, you know, as the industry is moving to things like Game Pass and digital stuff,

1931
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:04,260
you know, are physical games going to have a place moving forward?

1932
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:10,100
And Limited Run definitely sees like, oh, we definitely see where like the, you know,

1933
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:12,260
the pendulum swinging really hard the other way.

1934
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:14,900
It's not just a physical release, but collectibles.

1935
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:18,500
You know, that sort of physical release is really where there's, you know, stuff to be

1936
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:19,060
made still.

1937
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:21,460
And I think they're doing a very good job of that, to be honest.

1938
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:24,340
SHO 100 Matt kind of makes the comparison.

1939
01:36:24,340 --> 01:36:27,380
Limited Run Games is the arcade one up of consoles.

1940
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:29,620
And I get that comparison, I do.

1941
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:33,700
Mike Deft in chat says Limited Run should drop the limited, though.

1942
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:36,580
Then they just be run.

1943
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:38,660
They could be loading ready run.

1944
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:45,060
I think that's not necessarily the limited, you know, scope of titles, but, you know,

1945
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:46,420
they're limited releases.

1946
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:50,820
I don't think that they're necessarily publishing, you know, hundreds of thousands of copies

1947
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:51,460
of these.

1948
01:36:51,460 --> 01:36:51,960
Mm hmm.

1949
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:56,500
And OrangeRite points out the great thing about the Turbo Duo release is that it's 100%

1950
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:56,820
official.

1951
01:36:56,820 --> 01:36:59,460
It will have the Turbo Graphics 16 branding on it.

1952
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:02,260
It helps that the game and the console are owned by the same company now.

1953
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:03,300
Yeah, that's true.

1954
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:06,900
And don't forget, they had that Turbo Mini not that long ago that was pretty damn well

1955
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:07,860
received, actually.

1956
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:10,020
So I enjoyed mine, that's for sure.

1957
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:10,520
So.

1958
01:37:11,220 --> 01:37:11,860
All right.

1959
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:14,980
Anyway, one more story for you guys tonight.

1960
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:18,340
And I love it because it's about a toaster.

1961
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:20,020
That's right.

1962
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:24,740
There is an official Destiny toaster on the way out, as if an Xbox fridge.

1963
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:25,220
Wasn't it?

1964
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:26,980
Why not, Loki?

1965
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:27,860
Why not?

1966
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:28,180
We did.

1967
01:37:28,180 --> 01:37:30,980
Did I not just talk about video game collectibles?

1968
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:32,180
That's where things are going.

1969
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:34,660
It is your destiny to make some toast.

1970
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:37,540
Every day for me.

1971
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:43,140
Anyway, so yes, you will now soon be able to get a Destiny toaster.

1972
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:45,300
It is going to cost you $85.

1973
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:48,260
That's more expensive than a Hello Kitty toaster when they had them at Target.

1974
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:49,140
Just pointing that out.

1975
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:53,380
You can preorder the toaster from the Bungie store and it will ship at some point between

1976
01:37:53,380 --> 01:37:56,260
December and January 2022.

1977
01:37:56,260 --> 01:37:57,860
What about my holiday gift?

1978
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:00,100
Well, there went that.

1979
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:01,220
All right, whatever.

1980
01:38:01,220 --> 01:38:07,220
Anyway, you also get the Burnt Edges emblem in Destiny 2.

1981
01:38:07,220 --> 01:38:12,660
So if the toaster wasn't enough, you get a little in-game thing, the Burnt Edges emblem,

1982
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:13,860
which is really fucking funny.

1983
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:17,540
Now, Loki, here's the part to be less cynical about, the cool part.

1984
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:18,980
It is part of a charity event.

1985
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:23,700
So 10% of the purchase price goes to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

1986
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:25,140
So, all right, we have that.

1987
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:26,340
10%?

1988
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:27,540
Can they do a little bit more?

1989
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:28,580
How about 30%?

1990
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:29,940
All right, anyway.

1991
01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:30,840
Exactly.

1992
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:36,100
This is not the first fundraiser that Bungie and Destiny has done.

1993
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:40,740
The Destiny community raised over $800,000 for St. Jude back in June.

1994
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:51,460
So basically, Bungie offered will make a toaster if you hit the target of $777,777.7 all across

1995
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:51,780
the board.

1996
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:56,820
If you hit seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, which why they didn't do seven sevens and

1997
01:38:56,820 --> 01:38:59,140
they did eight sevens, I'm not going to understand, but that's all right.

1998
01:38:59,140 --> 01:39:01,060
They raised a lot of good money, so that's good.

1999
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:05,700
And Bungie is making good on their promise, I guess, even if it's a little bit weird.

2000
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:10,500
Anyone in chat going to be purchasing the Destiny thing?

2001
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:12,020
No one special.

2002
01:39:12,020 --> 01:39:13,300
77 in chat says what?

2003
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:17,140
No Destiny toilet paper, Destiny doll, Destiny flamethrower, et cetera.

2004
01:39:17,140 --> 01:39:17,860
What do you think this is?

2005
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:18,980
Spaceballs?

2006
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:20,660
What do you think?

2007
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:22,740
It does sound like Spaceballs.

2008
01:39:22,740 --> 01:39:24,020
It does sound like Spaceballs.

2009
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:28,180
And actually, I think there is other Destiny merchandise out there.

2010
01:39:28,180 --> 01:39:30,020
You joke about Destiny doll.

2011
01:39:30,980 --> 01:39:32,500
They've got Funko Pops.

2012
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:33,620
I guarantee it.

2013
01:39:33,620 --> 01:39:34,580
Yeah, exactly.

2014
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:36,580
Destiny, the lunchbox.

2015
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:37,220
It's destiny.

2016
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:38,660
The fruit or was it yogurt?

2017
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:40,820
Uh, that's just you.

2018
01:39:40,820 --> 01:39:41,140
One hundred.

2019
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:42,340
Matt makes a good point, though.

2020
01:39:42,340 --> 01:39:46,100
You know what Destiny doesn't have is a fanny pack like VOG.

2021
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:46,740
That's right.

2022
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:52,420
Thank you for that plug once again for our updated shop over at vognetwork.com slash shop.

2023
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:53,540
That's right, Destiny.

2024
01:39:53,540 --> 01:39:54,660
You don't get a fanny pack.

2025
01:39:55,540 --> 01:39:56,180
I love it.

2026
01:39:56,180 --> 01:39:56,580
All right.

2027
01:39:57,460 --> 01:39:59,940
Mike Depp says there's a Destiny cookbook.

2028
01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:00,420
Really?

2029
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:03,620
I did not know that was a thing.

2030
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:05,860
All right.

2031
01:40:05,860 --> 01:40:12,020
It is time to go to the listener roundtable where I believe Dark Sakura indicated we have

2032
01:40:12,020 --> 01:40:13,220
an empty mailbag this week.

2033
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:16,580
So she's going to taunt us with churros instead on her webcam.

2034
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:18,980
Husband brought me dinner.

2035
01:40:18,980 --> 01:40:23,460
But if you would like to, where do you get dinner that comes with churros?

2036
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:23,860
Hold up.

2037
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:26,180
Del Taco.

2038
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:27,380
They have churros?

2039
01:40:27,380 --> 01:40:27,880
Really?

2040
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:34,020
I usually try not to get dessert at fast food because I already got fast food, but shit,

2041
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:35,060
I might have to break it for that.

2042
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:35,700
I love churros.

2043
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:39,060
Anyway, I need it.

2044
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:39,860
It was a need.

2045
01:40:39,860 --> 01:40:41,380
I understand.

2046
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:42,180
I understand.

2047
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:47,620
We all there's been days where it's like, I need what are like other favorite dessert.

2048
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:48,500
Oh, Cheesecake Factory.

2049
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:49,620
Frozen custard.

2050
01:40:50,580 --> 01:40:52,260
Oh, see, I don't really get that as much.

2051
01:40:52,420 --> 01:40:53,540
I eat frozen yogurt.

2052
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:57,780
So we had a Rita's nearby that sells frozen custard and it was delicious.

2053
01:40:57,780 --> 01:40:59,780
And then they closed their store.

2054
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:03,460
Because that's what happens when I find something I like.

2055
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:06,100
We stop selling it or close it down.

2056
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:07,700
It's like, oh, wait, Loki likes it.

2057
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:09,540
Quick, shut the doors.

2058
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:12,580
Isn't that fried chicken place you like that used to be near the studio?

2059
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:14,260
Like, didn't that come back somewhere?

2060
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:14,820
It is coming.

2061
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:16,260
It came back in a bunch of places.

2062
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:17,940
So I did order a bunch of that the other day.

2063
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:21,940
And I also ordered a bunch of the actual powder that they put on it from them because you

2064
01:41:21,940 --> 01:41:22,660
can buy that.

2065
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:27,060
And then I've been sprinkling that on other chicken things.

2066
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:33,380
But unfortunately, I guess the powder actually is it's good by itself, but it really got

2067
01:41:33,380 --> 01:41:35,620
to have their baked chicken to go with it.

2068
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:38,420
You kind of need both to be the cracked chicken.

2069
01:41:38,420 --> 01:41:41,220
So we'll have to order some more of that this week.

2070
01:41:42,260 --> 01:41:42,900
Okay.

2071
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:46,420
Anyway, I was going to plug the mailbag, at least, even if it was empty.

2072
01:41:46,420 --> 01:41:50,500
Even if Dark Sakura found churros in it, which is always a pleasant surprise, you can always

2073
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:50,980
email us.

2074
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:55,940
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email in a future week.

2075
01:41:55,940 --> 01:41:59,460
Um, I will get to Discord in a minute, but we do have some Roundtable stuff coming from

2076
01:41:59,460 --> 01:41:59,700
chat.

2077
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:00,500
So let's get to it.

2078
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:04,100
No One Special 77 in chat says, Roundtable question.

2079
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:10,500
Aside from Magic the Gatherings and Diablo 1 and 2, what games do you know of and would

2080
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:14,260
recommend that can be played solely with the left hand?

2081
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:16,740
Too long, didn't read version.

2082
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:21,620
Since January 23rd, 2021, I can no longer use my right arm.

2083
01:42:21,620 --> 01:42:23,220
Oh my gosh, I'm sorry to hear that.

2084
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:24,820
That explains why you haven't been around in a while.

2085
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:26,980
Well, I hope you're feeling okay.

2086
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:27,860
I'm really sorry to hear that.

2087
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:31,380
So what gaming I can do is limited.

2088
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:33,380
Oh, that's a good question.

2089
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:38,900
I don't know, Dark Sakura, I know there was a period of time where you were having a lot

2090
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:39,460
of wrist.

2091
01:42:40,340 --> 01:42:45,060
Uh, you'd had surgery on your wrist and so you were kind of doing some one-handed gaming.

2092
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:48,900
Um, is there any, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, churro time, but is there any advice,

2093
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:50,500
uh, from your experience in that?

2094
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:53,940
Cause I mean, I, I, I haven't been, she was completely different.

2095
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:55,300
I could still use my thumb.

2096
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:57,060
I know, but weren't you, weren't you still one hand?

2097
01:42:57,060 --> 01:42:58,100
Oh, you were using your thumb.

2098
01:42:58,100 --> 01:42:58,420
Okay.

2099
01:42:58,420 --> 01:42:58,740
All right.

2100
01:42:58,740 --> 01:43:02,660
I thought you were using, hold on, I'll put it up on, on chat.

2101
01:43:02,660 --> 01:43:03,940
This is what I use.

2102
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:04,900
I game with this too.

2103
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:11,300
Um, it's one of the old Microsoft thumb track ball mice, um, that they don't make anymore.

2104
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:20,340
But, um, the only thing that I could think of is, um, if there's any mobility with the

2105
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:27,140
right arm at all, like any at all, then maybe a top track ball would, would be something

2106
01:43:27,140 --> 01:43:27,780
that could be used.

2107
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:32,420
If not, then they do make those one-handed RPG controllers.

2108
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:37,300
Cause I, right after my surgery, I was playing, um, blue dragon with that.

2109
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:43,220
Not the, not the toot my own horn or anything, but if you remap some, if you remap the action

2110
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:49,300
button in your favorite NES emulator, pixel poops number two is quite playable with one

2111
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:52,260
hand because it's just directional and one button.

2112
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:54,180
So there you go.

2113
01:43:54,180 --> 01:43:56,020
And I was, go ahead, Jimmy.

2114
01:43:56,980 --> 01:44:02,980
On top of that, as we've, uh, we've told no one special in, uh, a while back, there's

2115
01:44:02,980 --> 01:44:09,300
also, uh, plenty of switch controls now where you can use, uh, head movement or another

2116
01:44:09,300 --> 01:44:13,220
hand for controlling a game with a single directional switch.

2117
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:21,380
Um, so there's plenty, there's tons of adaptive controllers out there from multiple places.

2118
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:30,020
Um, my max well, before PCs had it actually had plenty of integrated, uh, accessibility

2119
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:32,420
options, uh, for various things.

2120
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:40,980
So, well, and I w that's kind of the direction my, you know, I, I have not been in that situation

2121
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:43,700
where I only have the one hand for gaming.

2122
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:48,580
Um, so it's, it's hard cause I don't, I don't really have experience, but my brain was kind

2123
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:53,860
of going to the, well, the good news is that, you know, more and more games have been aware

2124
01:44:53,860 --> 01:44:54,980
of accessibility.

2125
01:44:54,980 --> 01:44:59,780
And so sometimes it's just about remapping the games that you want to play, but you might

2126
01:44:59,780 --> 01:45:03,060
have to rethink, well, I was, I was going to say you might have to rethink where you're

2127
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:07,380
playing them because I'm thinking of things like, okay, well, PlayStation four and five

2128
01:45:07,380 --> 01:45:08,900
have it baked into the OS.

2129
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:13,780
You can change buttons for any game, so you can change it around to basically make, you

2130
01:45:13,780 --> 01:45:15,140
know, just about anything work.

2131
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:19,540
You just might have to remap the buttons and you can do that within the actual OS.

2132
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:23,940
But since I know no one special from, you know, having been a long time listener, I

2133
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:30,260
know that no one special pretty much games like on PC, I think the mouse thing is a great

2134
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:35,700
suggestion because, and no one special is saying, um, there's virtually no mobility

2135
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:36,660
in the arm.

2136
01:45:36,660 --> 01:45:41,060
Um, which again, sorry to hear that, but I still think that mouse suggestion about there

2137
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:43,460
are games that are completely playable with the mouse.

2138
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:45,540
I know you like trading card games.

2139
01:45:45,540 --> 01:45:51,140
Um, so I would think of other, you know, very mouse focused games like, uh, like hearthstone.

2140
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:54,900
I would think even things like civilization, you can play almost completely with the mouse

2141
01:45:54,900 --> 01:45:57,540
because I know when I've played that game, I've almost played that exclusively with the

2142
01:45:57,540 --> 01:45:58,180
mouse.

2143
01:45:58,180 --> 01:46:02,420
A lot of things that were developed with the PC in mind have really taken advantage of

2144
01:46:02,420 --> 01:46:02,820
the mouse.

2145
01:46:02,820 --> 01:46:08,100
You might have to get a different mouse, a lefty mouse, but that's, that's pretty common.

2146
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:12,900
Um, so there's a, that shouldn't be too, too much of a simple web search.

2147
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:19,300
I found one handed controllers among them being a single handed controller for switch.

2148
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:27,300
Um, that will, um, uh, I think it's, it's one for switcher.

2149
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:31,220
I have to double check it, but I mean, they exist.

2150
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:33,380
You just have to look them up.

2151
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:34,260
Yeah.

2152
01:46:34,980 --> 01:46:40,100
Uh, and pod culture and chat says, uh, Adam's friend Justin that was sometimes on pod culture

2153
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:42,500
is also limited to, uh, one arm.

2154
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:44,900
I'll have to check with what he games with.

2155
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:49,620
So I do love the paying it forward there in chat to, uh, get some suggestions from other

2156
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:53,220
people who may be going through something similar, uh, in that situation.

2157
01:46:53,220 --> 01:47:00,020
So, uh, I just found a mini ring, the Bluetooth controller that you play with one hand, one

2158
01:47:00,020 --> 01:47:01,780
handed Bluetooth wireless controller.

2159
01:47:02,420 --> 01:47:05,860
Um, there's the PS one ones that you can use an adapter with.

2160
01:47:05,860 --> 01:47:10,900
There's a Banggood PSDD one, one handed game pad Bluetooth.

2161
01:47:11,540 --> 01:47:16,420
Um, there is the Logitech adaptive game kit for Xbox controller.

2162
01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:19,140
There is one that uses rings.

2163
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:27,380
There's also a hori makes, uh, what's called the tactical assault commander pro for Xbox

2164
01:47:27,380 --> 01:47:30,500
one, um, which of course then would work on a PC.

2165
01:47:31,060 --> 01:47:37,700
Um, but yeah, there, there's a number, a number of controllers out there.

2166
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:41,780
ASCII stick, um, for super Famicom, if you want to get into your retro games.

2167
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:44,020
So they're out there.

2168
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:45,800
All right.

2169
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:50,180
Um, I found, uh, a one handed PS four controller.

2170
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:54,900
Oh, so yeah, they're out there.

2171
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:58,980
It's nice to know at least that there is the more, more and more accessibility, um, you

2172
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:02,900
know, and, and options are out there because I feel like if we'd done a search 10, even

2173
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:05,540
10 years ago, there wouldn't be as many options.

2174
01:48:05,540 --> 01:48:08,420
I don't know if we would have found the RPG controllers.

2175
01:48:08,980 --> 01:48:09,480
Yeah.

2176
01:48:09,700 --> 01:48:10,020
Yeah.

2177
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:12,020
And they were practically giving those away.

2178
01:48:12,020 --> 01:48:14,260
I have one for like PlayStation and for Dreamcast.

2179
01:48:15,940 --> 01:48:16,740
Um, okay.

2180
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:19,380
Uh, thank you all for the feedback on that question.

2181
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:24,340
Let me get to, uh, some of the comments left in our discord over at vognetwork.com slash

2182
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:25,860
discord throughout the week.

2183
01:48:25,860 --> 01:48:30,820
Uh, dungeon buster had, uh, kind of highlighted a story for us that had to do with, uh, EA

2184
01:48:30,820 --> 01:48:35,700
loot boxes, uh, pulling the quote saying, if you do not buy the pack, you will see the

2185
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:39,380
previewed pack remains in the store where it is now on a refresh timer.

2186
01:48:39,380 --> 01:48:43,860
The timer has to expire before you can preview another pack of the same type.

2187
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:48,660
In one example, given by EA, a pack expired in 20 hours and 35 minutes.

2188
01:48:48,660 --> 01:48:53,540
So this has to do with EA letting you see what is in FIFA loot boxes before you buy

2189
01:48:53,540 --> 01:48:53,780
them.

2190
01:48:53,780 --> 01:48:55,540
I think I was reading a story on this somewhere else.

2191
01:48:55,540 --> 01:49:00,020
It's not all the loot boxes, but it's like limited to certain types or whatever, but

2192
01:49:00,020 --> 01:49:00,740
it is interesting.

2193
01:49:00,740 --> 01:49:03,300
I think the EA has been pressured to go this direction.

2194
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:06,020
It feels like this took forever for this to happen.

2195
01:49:06,020 --> 01:49:10,420
Um, so I'm kind of not surprised to see this happening, but I'm definitely glad at least

2196
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:14,100
we have a little more knowledge now on, you know, what exactly are you going to be buying?

2197
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:18,340
It may, it, it takes some of the gambling notion out of it, even if it is still, uh,

2198
01:49:18,340 --> 01:49:20,020
randomized, so to speak.

2199
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:20,980
So there is that.

2200
01:49:21,780 --> 01:49:22,100
All right.

2201
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:26,180
Um, Ooh, I didn't know this, uh, 13 X forever in chat.

2202
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:26,900
Excuse me.

2203
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:32,580
And discord said, apparently Sega is doing a physical Sonic card game, uh, linking us

2204
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:36,820
to a tweet from the official Sega account at Sega saying, take your sneakers to the

2205
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:41,860
tabletop with the brand new game from steam forge available to pre-order now and, uh,

2206
01:49:41,860 --> 01:49:44,260
giving links to a Sonic card game.

2207
01:49:44,260 --> 01:49:45,540
Got to play fast, right?

2208
01:49:46,340 --> 01:49:48,820
Ooh, I remember reading about this story too.

2209
01:49:48,820 --> 01:49:53,700
So thank you for highlighting for this core K in arch, uh, discord chat, uh, has to do

2210
01:49:53,780 --> 01:49:58,980
with analog and those pocket, like that game boy color thing that they were making.

2211
01:49:58,980 --> 01:50:01,620
Uh, they are going to be making more of them.

2212
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:06,580
And you might remember that they had, uh, some real issues with bots and, uh, you know,

2213
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:09,300
sniping all the, uh, good stuff and all that.

2214
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:14,100
They have also talked about analog, uh, that they're going to do robust bot protection.

2215
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:18,260
So pocket, uh, had sold out almost instantly.

2216
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:24,180
This is a $200 device that plays Neo Geo pocket color, Atari links, Sega game gear, and multiple

2217
01:50:24,180 --> 01:50:28,180
generations of game boy color color, excuse me, game boy titles, which would, I would

2218
01:50:28,180 --> 01:50:29,540
assume include color.

2219
01:50:29,540 --> 01:50:31,220
Um, but nobody could get one.

2220
01:50:31,220 --> 01:50:32,900
It seems cause all the scalpers got them.

2221
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:35,300
So, uh, that's great that it's coming back.

2222
01:50:35,300 --> 01:50:38,340
Cause I think a lot of people were like, why won't they make more?

2223
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:39,220
Well, good news, everyone.

2224
01:50:39,220 --> 01:50:42,660
They're going to make more, I'm going to guess maybe some of the supply and demand

2225
01:50:42,660 --> 01:50:47,540
supply issues, mainly with COVID, uh, probably made this really hard for a while.

2226
01:50:47,540 --> 01:50:49,940
So I'm glad to see it's, um, coming back.

2227
01:50:49,940 --> 01:50:50,740
So there is that.

2228
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:52,580
All right.

2229
01:50:53,540 --> 01:50:58,900
Uh, if you have some comments throughout the week, uh, vog network.com slash discord is

2230
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:00,580
the place to leave those comments.

2231
01:51:00,580 --> 01:51:02,260
And of course you can always send us an email as well.

2232
01:51:02,820 --> 01:51:06,500
Participate at orange lounge, radio.com.

2233
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:09,540
Um, let me check in with Loki and see if we have any last minute stories.

2234
01:51:10,740 --> 01:51:11,220
Yeah.

2235
01:51:11,220 --> 01:51:16,260
So I was going to talk about, there was a leak, uh, showing a brand new Lego Mario set.

2236
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:19,300
That's a massive Bowser airship.

2237
01:51:19,300 --> 01:51:24,740
So I'm assuming I know where this is going to be coming from, that they're going to,

2238
01:51:24,740 --> 01:51:28,740
this is going to be an announcement that's going to happen next weekend because they're

2239
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:33,220
doing their first ever Lego con, which is kind of like this virtual convention.

2240
01:51:33,220 --> 01:51:36,020
And they're supposed to be announcing more Lego Mario sets there.

2241
01:51:36,020 --> 01:51:44,580
So, um, my guess is that leaked out somewhere, but, uh, oh, well, I guess we'll see it then.

2242
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:47,140
Um, but yeah, it looks pretty cool.

2243
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:53,860
It's got over a thousand pieces in it and it's got a, uh, Kamek in there and yeah,

2244
01:51:53,860 --> 01:51:55,300
the ship is pretty large as well.

2245
01:51:55,300 --> 01:51:56,740
So, well, you know what though?

2246
01:51:56,740 --> 01:52:01,860
Sometimes things leak from companies before big conventions and they still don't materialize.

2247
01:52:01,860 --> 01:52:04,660
I E the Simpsons arcade one up cabinet.

2248
01:52:04,660 --> 01:52:06,340
What the hell happened there?

2249
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:10,740
Like I want, I want an airship the size of the USS flag though.

2250
01:52:10,740 --> 01:52:13,380
The GI Joe playset.

2251
01:52:14,660 --> 01:52:15,140
Oh yeah.

2252
01:52:15,140 --> 01:52:15,700
Yeah.

2253
01:52:15,700 --> 01:52:15,940
Yeah.

2254
01:52:15,940 --> 01:52:16,580
I love that.

2255
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:18,020
Well, I know people who have them.

2256
01:52:19,380 --> 01:52:22,420
The closest you can get to that, I mean, would be, it's not there.

2257
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:27,300
Well, I mean, it's the, uh, Marvel Avengers airship that they had was pretty large,

2258
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:28,740
but it was micro scale.

2259
01:52:28,740 --> 01:52:32,420
I want a mini fixed scale one, but that would be like the size of my kitchen table.

2260
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:33,220
So yeah.

2261
01:52:33,220 --> 01:52:35,380
Well, the flag would be the size of your kitchen table.

2262
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:36,980
So that's true.

2263
01:52:36,980 --> 01:52:37,620
Yeah.

2264
01:52:37,620 --> 01:52:37,860
Yeah.

2265
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:42,020
Um, man, I miss when they made toy sets that big.

2266
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:44,580
Yeah.

2267
01:52:45,540 --> 01:52:46,100
All right.

2268
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:47,220
Any other last minute stories?

2269
01:52:48,020 --> 01:52:49,140
Uh, no, that's all I had.

2270
01:52:49,780 --> 01:52:50,260
All right.

2271
01:52:50,820 --> 01:52:53,860
Well, I think we're, uh, it's a little shorter tonight, but that's all right.

2272
01:52:53,860 --> 01:52:55,540
We're going to get to some final thoughts.

2273
01:52:55,540 --> 01:52:58,420
It's kind of like you had those E3 announcements and then, okay.

2274
01:52:58,420 --> 01:53:01,540
Everybody's taking a break from news cause everything kind of came out at once,

2275
01:53:01,540 --> 01:53:04,740
but I'm sure we'll start to see more and more pickup in the coming weeks.

2276
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:07,140
Um, so of course, uh, before we get to the final thoughts,

2277
01:53:07,220 --> 01:53:10,020
I do want to thank everybody out there for listening to orange launch radio.

2278
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:11,780
Thank you for participating with our show.

Um, your support really means a lot to us.

2280
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:17,700
Um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio, please tell a friend or two.

2281
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:20,580
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

2282
01:53:20,580 --> 01:53:25,140
but if the voices aren't here to put out on air, then we were missing the voices.

2283
01:53:25,140 --> 01:53:27,140
So, uh, yeah, tell a friend or two about the show.

2284
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:30,580
Uh, a nice five star review on a site like iTunes goes a real long way.

2285
01:53:30,580 --> 01:53:32,980
Um, or wherever it is you found this podcast.

2286
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:37,620
Also, um, the, the hosting, uh, on Twitch for VOG network is huge.

2287
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:39,620
I really thank everybody that does that.

2288
01:53:39,620 --> 01:53:40,900
Um, thank you. Thank you.

2289
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:42,580
Uh, appreciate all that support.

2292
01:53:48,420 --> 01:53:49,940
I appreciate you being here too.

2293
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:50,900
Uh, we all do.

2294
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:53,460
And thank you, uh, for being a part of the show.

Email us or tweet us sometimes and we know you're out there or join the discord

2296
01:53:56,260 --> 01:53:56,740
or something like that.

2297
01:53:56,740 --> 01:53:57,460
I don't know.

2298
01:53:57,460 --> 01:53:57,940
Anyway.

2299
01:53:57,940 --> 01:54:00,100
Um, that's all I can think of.

2300
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:03,300
Another plug for the shop, uh, that was updated with lots and lots of good stuff

2301
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:06,420
this week, uh, including a fanny pack, vog network.com.

2302
01:54:06,420 --> 01:54:08,260
It's the, it's the must have vog item of the year.

2303
01:54:08,260 --> 01:54:12,100
The fanny pack, vog network.com slash shop for that.

2304
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:13,700
I'll have to put up a few others.

2305
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:15,620
Well, yeah.

2306
01:54:15,620 --> 01:54:20,500
And we are kind of watching what sells and what doesn't because we're only allowed to

2307
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:22,660
list, I think 25 things at a time.

2308
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:24,340
So like those are we, ha ha.

2309
01:54:24,340 --> 01:54:24,500
Yeah.

2310
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:24,740
Yeah.

2311
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:29,060
So we got to, it can't go too buck wild, but like, I think the mat, the masks are

2312
01:54:29,060 --> 01:54:32,900
now gone because, um, they weren't very good, unfortunately.

2313
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:35,220
So that is, but the mugs, the mugs are great.

2314
01:54:35,220 --> 01:54:36,260
The shirts are great.

2315
01:54:36,260 --> 01:54:38,660
Like everything else that's come from that store has been really good.

2316
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:45,860
So I put some more tank tops up instead of like just regular t-shirts cause tank tops.

2317
01:54:45,860 --> 01:54:46,100
Yeah.

2318
01:54:46,740 --> 01:54:46,980
Yeah.

2319
01:54:46,980 --> 01:54:47,620
You know?

2320
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:48,100
Yeah.

2321
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:52,020
Um, but I thought that people might like want a notebook or something.

2322
01:54:54,100 --> 01:54:56,340
So, and the stickers are actually really good quality.

2323
01:54:56,340 --> 01:54:57,940
I ordered some of my own stickers.

2324
01:54:59,140 --> 01:55:06,100
And like, I mean, I can show you as well for those on in chat right now, I can show an

2325
01:55:06,100 --> 01:55:08,580
example of just like how good the printing is on them.

2326
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:11,860
So, I mean, I'll, I'll hide that.

2327
01:55:11,860 --> 01:55:16,340
So I'm not doing like cross promotion, but I mean, they're really nice and good quality.

2328
01:55:17,060 --> 01:55:18,740
You're allowed to promote your own stream on it.

2329
01:55:18,740 --> 01:55:18,980
Okay.

2330
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:20,900
Well then look, come on.

2331
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:24,180
Well, I just don't want to, you know, ruffle any feathers.

2332
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:25,700
Fine.

2333
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:26,260
Oh my God.

2334
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:27,700
My feathers are so rough.

2335
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:34,340
Well, but anyway, but as you can see, they're really thick and they're the cutout style

2336
01:55:34,340 --> 01:55:34,660
ones.

2337
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:39,380
So it's like they have the little pull out pieces.

2338
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:41,140
Oh, I didn't know that.

2339
01:55:41,140 --> 01:55:41,780
That's cool.

2340
01:55:41,780 --> 01:55:49,220
So yeah, so if you have any like open space, like of a certain gap, then, um, it'll be

2341
01:55:49,220 --> 01:55:50,100
hollow in the center.

2342
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:51,300
That's nice.

2343
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:52,500
Yeah.

2344
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:54,740
They're really, they're really good quality stickers.

2345
01:55:54,740 --> 01:55:56,820
I think they're the kinds that you can put on like water bottles.

2346
01:55:59,380 --> 01:55:59,860
All right.

2347
01:56:00,580 --> 01:56:00,900
Awesome.

2348
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:01,380
Awesome.

2349
01:56:01,380 --> 01:56:02,260
I was trying to load up.

2350
01:56:02,260 --> 01:56:07,300
I may not, I may not have it, uh, right away because, um, the Twitch panel doesn't show

2351
01:56:07,300 --> 01:56:09,060
me those purchases.

2352
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:12,500
I only see that when I'm logged into stream labs, which I didn't have the foresight to

2353
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:13,220
do tonight.

2354
01:56:13,220 --> 01:56:16,580
So I may not be able to thank you all tonight, but I'll try to do that next week.

2355
01:56:16,580 --> 01:56:20,580
Like thank everybody who's, uh, uh, checked out some, I have seen, it does scroll along

2356
01:56:20,580 --> 01:56:21,060
the bottom.

2357
01:56:21,060 --> 01:56:25,060
If you buy it during OLR, you actually scrolls along the bottom and shows that you did that.

2358
01:56:25,060 --> 01:56:25,620
So thank you.

2359
01:56:25,620 --> 01:56:26,500
Thank you for that.

2360
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:28,580
Uh, everybody that is supporting so far.

2361
01:56:28,820 --> 01:56:33,540
You don't have to, but, um, you know, you guys do ask, can I get an OLR shirt?

2362
01:56:33,540 --> 01:56:37,140
So, um, it, it's only been like 19 years, but yes, you may.

2363
01:56:37,140 --> 01:56:38,580
You may have an OLR shirt.

2364
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:42,580
No, we ha we did have others, but you know, this is the first like big one that we've

2365
01:56:42,580 --> 01:56:42,820
done.

2366
01:56:42,820 --> 01:56:45,700
That's a print on demand too, which is really nice.

2367
01:56:45,700 --> 01:56:51,460
So, oh, and I wanted just to kind of do something a little bit different cause I don't think

2368
01:56:51,460 --> 01:56:57,620
we actually have an official orange lounge radio logo, which we need to get on.

2369
01:56:58,580 --> 01:57:00,340
Other than that thing.

2370
01:57:00,900 --> 01:57:04,900
I don't, I don't really consider that cause that was made by my ex that I haven't talked

2371
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:06,740
to in like how many years.

2372
01:57:06,740 --> 01:57:08,100
Um, I, I like it.

2373
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:10,580
I'm still mad at him for the editing on those pictures.

2374
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:10,820
Okay.

2375
01:57:12,580 --> 01:57:15,380
We're going to talk about that during the episode one stream this week.

2376
01:57:15,380 --> 01:57:15,620
Okay.

2377
01:57:17,860 --> 01:57:20,980
So, uh, he, was he on that episode?

2378
01:57:21,540 --> 01:57:24,020
Shitty might've been, God, I hope I don't have to hear him.

2379
01:57:24,020 --> 01:57:24,260
All right.

2380
01:57:24,260 --> 01:57:26,020
No, I'm just, I don't, I'm not that bitter.

2381
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:32,420
But I was, um, thinking of, uh, you know, just like maybe the Sega font was fun.

2382
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:33,300
So I did that.

2383
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:39,620
And then, um, I was kind of influenced by that whole kind of eighties retro thing going

2384
01:57:39,620 --> 01:57:40,260
around right now.

2385
01:57:40,260 --> 01:57:42,020
So I did one for VOG that way.

2386
01:57:42,020 --> 01:57:42,420
Yeah.

2387
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:46,580
Um, I know Bobby was really thrilled with that VOG network logo and I like it too that

2388
01:57:46,580 --> 01:57:49,220
what I wasn't ex I guess I wasn't expecting that.

2389
01:57:49,220 --> 01:57:54,180
So I would kind of file that in the things I didn't know I needed until I saw it Ben.

2390
01:57:54,180 --> 01:57:55,300
So congrats.

2391
01:57:55,300 --> 01:57:59,940
I might have to, well, and I'll tell you actually what started that was the design

2392
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:02,180
was my branding for, for mine.

2393
01:58:02,180 --> 01:58:05,540
Cause mine's all like neon and everything.

2394
01:58:05,540 --> 01:58:08,900
And I was like, I want to do something for VOG, but I want it to look different.

2395
01:58:09,860 --> 01:58:12,020
And I think I succeeded.

2396
01:58:12,020 --> 01:58:17,220
Um, SSJ100Matt in chat says kind of want that album art thing so I can get it signed

2397
01:58:17,220 --> 01:58:17,940
from y'all.

2398
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:21,220
Then again, that sounds weird getting something signed by friends.

2399
01:58:21,220 --> 01:58:24,020
Oh, that's, but that's really sweet that you would want something like that.

2400
01:58:24,020 --> 01:58:26,820
So I'd be happy to sign anything anytime.

2401
01:58:27,620 --> 01:58:28,900
It's a little pricey though.

2402
01:58:28,900 --> 01:58:29,620
Isn't it?

2403
01:58:29,620 --> 01:58:30,420
The canvas one.

2404
01:58:31,300 --> 01:58:38,340
I just put it up, I put it up as a whim and gosh, if y'all like it, then, then I'll

2405
01:58:38,340 --> 01:58:38,900
keep it up.

2406
01:58:39,460 --> 01:58:39,960
Yeah.

2407
01:58:40,980 --> 01:58:41,460
All right.

2408
01:58:41,460 --> 01:58:42,820
Yeah, it's funny in chat.

2409
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:43,380
No one's special.

2410
01:58:43,380 --> 01:58:46,420
Say anyone born on the day or started is now college age.

2411
01:58:46,420 --> 01:58:47,140
Funny you should say that.

2412
01:58:47,140 --> 01:58:50,660
I was listening to a couple of folks, um, their podcasts actually.

2413
01:58:50,660 --> 01:58:55,460
And they were talking about how, um, how they got started kind of in making videos

2414
01:58:55,460 --> 01:58:56,340
on YouTube and stuff.

2415
01:58:56,340 --> 01:58:57,540
And they were talking about, Oh yeah.

2416
01:58:57,540 --> 01:59:02,260
You know, we used to watch all these videos and stuff when we were like seven and this,

2417
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:02,900
you know, date.

2418
01:59:02,900 --> 01:59:04,740
I'm like, Oh my God.

2419
01:59:04,740 --> 01:59:07,220
Like we started recording.

2420
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:11,060
Some of my streamer friends, I'm just like, y'all are babies.

2421
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:13,620
Some are babies.

2422
01:59:13,620 --> 01:59:17,620
It's really one of the, since we had an, we're only at two hours for the show.

2423
01:59:17,620 --> 01:59:20,100
I'm going to allow super tangent train tonight.

2424
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:26,900
So because, um, like I, I didn't have YouTube when I was a teenager, but I got into pub

2425
01:59:26,900 --> 01:59:27,860
public access.

2426
01:59:27,860 --> 01:59:28,820
You guys know this.

2427
01:59:29,460 --> 01:59:32,420
I actually had like a sketch comedy show I did with a friend of mine.

2428
01:59:32,420 --> 01:59:34,820
Everybody always asks, can we see the tapes?

2429
01:59:34,820 --> 01:59:35,620
Can we see the tape?

2430
01:59:35,620 --> 01:59:40,020
Can we do the, uh, the high spectrum, uh, airing as a channel point reward?

2431
01:59:40,020 --> 01:59:45,460
And the answer is no, I, and it's not because I don't want to, although it is also because

2432
01:59:45,460 --> 01:59:48,100
I don't want to, but I, I literally don't know where the tapes are.

2433
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:49,300
They are tapes.

2434
01:59:49,300 --> 01:59:50,020
They're that old.

2435
01:59:50,020 --> 01:59:51,540
They're on VHS somewhere.

2436
01:59:51,540 --> 01:59:53,860
I don't even know how we, I have to send them to Bobby to play.

2437
01:59:53,860 --> 01:59:54,820
Cause I don't even have it.

2438
01:59:54,820 --> 02:00:00,580
But I, number one, I, I, if you, if you think episode one is aged poorly, you should see

2439
02:00:00,580 --> 02:00:02,420
my show from 1996.

2440
02:00:02,420 --> 02:00:02,740
Okay.

2441
02:00:02,740 --> 02:00:04,500
That's aged really poorly.

2442
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:10,740
Uh, and yeah, I don't, if you can get me a tape based camcorder or something, I can

2443
02:00:10,740 --> 02:00:11,460
rip it easily.

2444
02:00:11,460 --> 02:00:13,860
I've got the, the software for it.

2445
02:00:13,860 --> 02:00:15,940
I, I, I literally don't, I don't have the taste.

2446
02:00:16,180 --> 02:00:22,740
I would have to reach out to my former co-host and she lives in SoCal now.

2447
02:00:22,740 --> 02:00:24,180
We're, we're, we're cordial.

2448
02:00:24,180 --> 02:00:29,060
I, I, you know, she, she was the world to me when I was in high school and those earlier

2449
02:00:29,060 --> 02:00:32,580
years, but we've just, you know, life sometimes takes you in separate directions and, you

2450
02:00:32,580 --> 02:00:36,580
know, she's, uh, she's raising her family in Southern California, but we do keep in

2451
02:00:36,580 --> 02:00:37,700
touch on Instagram.

2452
02:00:37,700 --> 02:00:40,900
So I do see, I see her kids growing up on my Instagram feed.

2453
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:43,380
So there is that she has twins actually.

2454
02:00:43,380 --> 02:00:44,740
So, uh, yeah.

2455
02:00:45,220 --> 02:00:50,180
Um, but anyway, uh, so SSJ100Matt says, Travis has those tapes.

2456
02:00:50,980 --> 02:00:53,780
Travis does not have those tapes.

2457
02:00:53,780 --> 02:00:56,420
What Travis has or had.

2458
02:00:57,140 --> 02:00:59,780
So he used to play this on under station live all the time.

2459
02:00:59,780 --> 02:01:01,380
He did it.

2460
02:01:01,380 --> 02:01:06,340
What he played on his show was a lot like the public access show, but that whole thing

2461
02:01:06,340 --> 02:01:10,980
would like the, the onyx where I was playing like a jewel type character, but I was onyx

2462
02:01:10,980 --> 02:01:11,940
get it, haha.

2463
02:01:11,940 --> 02:01:17,060
And other, because Shannon, who I used to do the show with back in the day, her and

2464
02:01:17,060 --> 02:01:21,060
I went to the same college and we were in the same summer school class and we were in

2465
02:01:21,060 --> 02:01:24,100
the same group to make this project.

2466
02:01:24,100 --> 02:01:27,700
So there was a lot of influence from what we had done on our public access show that

2467
02:01:27,700 --> 02:01:28,820
was in this project.

2468
02:01:28,820 --> 02:01:32,580
So basically that whole thing that was, I don't even remember what the hell it was now.

2469
02:01:32,580 --> 02:01:34,180
You guys have seen it more than I have.

2470
02:01:34,180 --> 02:01:38,420
Uh, but I think, Oh, was that the whole, it's Holanda or something like that.

2471
02:01:38,420 --> 02:01:41,380
Like we did, it's a whole talk show thing.

2472
02:01:41,380 --> 02:01:46,820
And, um, it was, it was very similar to what the would have been on the sketch comedy show

2473
02:01:46,820 --> 02:01:48,260
that we did on public access.

2474
02:01:48,260 --> 02:01:54,100
So that is, is kind of what it is, but technically that tape is not the public access show.

2475
02:01:54,100 --> 02:01:58,660
That is the college project because he probably also has the spice girls music video that

2476
02:01:58,660 --> 02:01:59,140
we did.

2477
02:01:59,940 --> 02:02:02,980
Cause like we had two big projects in the summer class.

2478
02:02:02,980 --> 02:02:04,660
One was to make a documentary.

2479
02:02:04,660 --> 02:02:05,780
That's what it was documentary.

2480
02:02:05,780 --> 02:02:07,220
And we made a funny one.

2481
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:14,340
And then, uh, the other was to make a, um, music video and he has that, but he does not

2482
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:19,060
have my old, uh, he he's been trying to find him, but if Shannon doesn't have the tapes,

2483
02:02:19,060 --> 02:02:20,260
then they're gone.

2484
02:02:20,260 --> 02:02:23,700
I don't know where they are because Roseville doesn't even have public access anymore.

2485
02:02:23,700 --> 02:02:27,860
They might've folded it into the government access channel there.

2486
02:02:27,860 --> 02:02:32,100
So they might have the tapes in an archive somewhere, but I would be very surprised.

2487
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:33,780
I'd be very, very surprised.

2488
02:02:33,860 --> 02:02:35,060
So, um,

2489
02:02:35,060 --> 02:02:40,660
I just have to use the freedom of information act to find it in hell.

2490
02:02:42,180 --> 02:02:44,020
No, that show is not getting out.

2491
02:02:44,020 --> 02:02:50,260
SSJ 100 Matt says if it's PBS, no different, uh, public access and PBS are very different.

2492
02:02:50,260 --> 02:02:56,500
PBS is like the, the, the, the, the BBC of the U S it's the government funded, uh, channel

2493
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:57,380
that's in every market.

2494
02:02:57,380 --> 02:02:59,940
Public access is local television.

2495
02:02:59,940 --> 02:03:04,420
So I had this show, but only people in the Sacramento suburb of Roseville could see it

2496
02:03:04,420 --> 02:03:06,340
because it was on Roseville public access.

2497
02:03:06,340 --> 02:03:07,460
So what city?

2498
02:03:07,460 --> 02:03:15,540
I think that if you go, there's like a city of Roseville TV and it's the government access

2499
02:03:15,540 --> 02:03:21,140
one that there's, I think a, a request thing through them.

2500
02:03:21,140 --> 02:03:22,020
So interesting.

2501
02:03:22,020 --> 02:03:26,980
I could look into it, but so channel eight was public access and channel 11 was government

2502
02:03:26,980 --> 02:03:27,380
access.

2503
02:03:27,380 --> 02:03:28,740
So yeah, Wayne's world.

2504
02:03:28,740 --> 02:03:30,020
I'm not, yes, wait.

2505
02:03:30,020 --> 02:03:30,260
Yeah.

2506
02:03:30,260 --> 02:03:33,060
Wayne's world actually is not that far off.

2507
02:03:33,060 --> 02:03:35,300
I mean of the concept, right?

2508
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:37,540
Cause Wayne's world was a rift on public access shows.

2509
02:03:37,540 --> 02:03:38,660
It really was.

2510
02:03:38,660 --> 02:03:42,980
Um, but I think the, like, like you kind of said, the government access, they were all

2511
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:48,580
about, they air city council meetings, they air, um, you know, uh, government at work

2512
02:03:48,580 --> 02:03:48,820
stuff.

2513
02:03:48,820 --> 02:03:52,820
It's um, C-SPAN for local stuff.

2514
02:03:52,820 --> 02:03:53,540
That's what they do.

2515
02:03:53,540 --> 02:03:57,140
So 11 and eight didn't really cross paths ever.

2516
02:03:57,140 --> 02:04:01,780
But I'm thinking if they closed eight because they had to have, cause of YouTube, anything

2517
02:04:01,780 --> 02:04:04,020
they had, I would imagine folded into 11.

2518
02:04:04,660 --> 02:04:07,940
But yeah, uh, no one special hit the nail on the head here.

2519
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:12,260
Public access channels were the pre-internet version of Twitch or YouTube.

2520
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:13,620
That's exactly it.

2521
02:04:13,620 --> 02:04:18,100
So I wasn't on YouTube, but I, I did public access instead.

2522
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:23,220
And that was, that was interesting, you know, cause it was on TV.

2523
02:04:23,220 --> 02:04:26,980
And so there'd be people that I would meet at Rocky Horror that would be like, I

2524
02:04:26,980 --> 02:04:29,140
saw you on TV like two years ago.

2525
02:04:29,140 --> 02:04:30,500
Your show was weird.

2526
02:04:32,100 --> 02:04:33,140
Yeah, it is.

2527
02:04:33,140 --> 02:04:33,540
It was.

2528
02:04:34,340 --> 02:04:36,260
So anyway, all right.

2529
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:37,300
That was a walk down memory lane.

2530
02:04:37,300 --> 02:04:39,540
Any other tangents we want to do before we close up shop tonight?

2531
02:04:40,420 --> 02:04:46,020
Um, I'm just gonna do, have some fun with Debbie Delight after the show.

2532
02:04:46,020 --> 02:04:46,980
Good times.

2533
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:47,700
Good times.

2534
02:04:49,300 --> 02:04:53,700
You don't have to rape me if you don't want to, but I'll be there.

2535
02:04:54,420 --> 02:04:55,380
All right.

2536
02:04:55,460 --> 02:04:57,780
Over at, uh, dark soccer, OLR.

2537
02:04:57,780 --> 02:05:02,180
So underscore underscore, the underscore is very important.

2538
02:05:02,740 --> 02:05:04,020
Um, okay.

2539
02:05:04,660 --> 02:05:07,780
That's, uh, that's going to do it for the show tonight.

2540
02:05:07,780 --> 02:05:09,860
Um, thank you guys so much for watching us.

2541
02:05:09,860 --> 02:05:10,980
I appreciate that.

2542
02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:14,580
Um, and, uh, that's, that's it.

2543
02:05:14,580 --> 02:05:17,540
Uh, I think I already said all the closing stuff and then we got into the tangents.

2544
02:05:17,540 --> 02:05:18,500
Oh, final thoughts.

2545
02:05:18,500 --> 02:05:21,620
I didn't really properly collect final thoughts.

2546
02:05:21,620 --> 02:05:24,340
So, um, Loki, why don't we start with you your final thought tonight?

2547
02:05:24,900 --> 02:05:29,540
Final thought is, uh, if you haven't yet, go, go watch my newest video that I have on

2548
02:05:29,540 --> 02:05:35,060
my YouTube channel, which is, uh, under user at Logilr and, uh, go leave it a like.

2549
02:05:35,700 --> 02:05:36,660
Subscribe if you haven't.

2550
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:41,300
Um, my final thought is it's a big week next week.

2551
02:05:41,300 --> 02:05:42,900
Uh, my birthday is on the weekend.

2552
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:45,700
I'm looking forward to that and actually getting to do something this year.

2553
02:05:45,700 --> 02:05:50,740
Um, and then, uh, I also OLR's birthday, so, um, we'll get into it a little more next

2554
02:05:50,740 --> 02:05:54,740
week, which will be kind of like our official 19th, uh, year celebration, I suppose.

2555
02:05:54,740 --> 02:05:58,500
Um, but just, you know, big thanks you guys just showing up.

2556
02:05:58,500 --> 02:05:59,140
It means a lot.

2557
02:05:59,140 --> 02:06:02,100
And I just really thank you guys for being here, whether you've been here for 19 minutes

2558
02:06:02,100 --> 02:06:03,940
or you've been here for all 19 years.

2559
02:06:03,940 --> 02:06:05,140
Um, you're awesome.

2560
02:06:05,140 --> 02:06:06,740
And thank you so much for being a part of it.

2561
02:06:06,740 --> 02:06:08,180
Uh, last but not least our soccer.

2562
02:06:09,300 --> 02:06:13,780
Uh, just two little things, not to be a downer, but this is the first father's day I've spent

2563
02:06:13,780 --> 02:06:14,820
since my dad died.

2564
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:17,540
So if I'm in a mood, that's why.

2565
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:23,780
Um, and second of all, um, the matchmaking and dead by daylight is fucking broken as

2566
02:06:23,780 --> 02:06:24,020
fuck.

2567
02:06:24,020 --> 02:06:26,180
And I'm getting sick of the toxic little campers.

2568
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:29,300
That's I, I want that MMR thing back.

2569
02:06:29,300 --> 02:06:30,260
It was so much better.

2570
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:31,220
Right.

2571
02:06:31,220 --> 02:06:33,780
The MMR was beautiful.

2572
02:06:33,780 --> 02:06:34,100
Yeah.

2573
02:06:34,100 --> 02:06:35,460
I hope that goes back.

2574
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:39,860
Oh, and I also have a tick tock now where you can hear me complain about what about

2575
02:06:39,860 --> 02:06:44,020
being a survivor on a, uh, bot controlled survivor game.

2576
02:06:44,020 --> 02:06:45,460
How do you start a tick tack?

2577
02:06:45,460 --> 02:06:47,620
I'm, I'm on the tick tack and I don't know how to use it.

2578
02:06:48,180 --> 02:06:50,260
Well, I just uploaded my own videos.

2579
02:06:51,220 --> 02:06:57,940
Um, but, uh, I recorded a video on my phone of Midna and a little outside cat.

2580
02:06:58,820 --> 02:07:03,380
And, um, I just kind of played around with the video.

2581
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:07,540
I uploaded the video and then added some effects to it and boom, I had a ticky tocky.

2582
02:07:08,180 --> 02:07:09,220
I have a tick tack.

2583
02:07:09,220 --> 02:07:10,820
I don't remember if I'm Rob Roberts or Mr.

2584
02:07:10,820 --> 02:07:11,300
Rob Roberts.

2585
02:07:12,260 --> 02:07:17,940
And all I have is a video from Rocky horror back in like 2019 where I dressed up.

2586
02:07:17,940 --> 02:07:20,740
My Halloween costume was a PG and E executive.

2587
02:07:20,740 --> 02:07:23,780
And so I was walking around in a suit and tie holding a power cord.

2588
02:07:23,780 --> 02:07:26,340
Cause the joke was I turned off all the power anyway.

2589
02:07:26,340 --> 02:07:27,620
And that was my one tick tock.

2590
02:07:27,620 --> 02:07:31,620
But I noticed like hundreds of people viewed it and I'm like, why?

2591
02:07:31,620 --> 02:07:32,900
This is stupid.

2592
02:07:32,900 --> 02:07:34,260
So it is interesting.

2593
02:07:34,260 --> 02:07:37,060
My funniest one that says only four people looked at it.

2594
02:07:37,060 --> 02:07:39,540
What I'm sure I've linked it to more people than that.

2595
02:07:39,540 --> 02:07:41,860
So maybe it just takes a while.

2596
02:07:41,860 --> 02:07:47,780
I also though took one of my, um, one of my clips from, uh, playing dead by daylight.

2597
02:07:47,780 --> 02:07:52,740
And I put it to music with an intro from just in playing in final cut pro.

2598
02:07:53,380 --> 02:07:56,420
And it's, uh, Amanda young, how to catch a husband.

2599
02:07:56,420 --> 02:07:57,780
And it's her putting David on a hook.

2600
02:07:59,460 --> 02:07:59,960
Love that.

2601
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:01,460
All right.

2602
02:08:01,460 --> 02:08:03,140
Uh, that's going to do it.

2603
02:08:03,140 --> 02:08:04,100
Have a good week, everybody.

2604
02:08:04,100 --> 02:08:06,180
We'll see you next time here at orange launch radio.

2605
02:08:06,180 --> 02:08:06,980
Have a great week.

2606
02:08:06,980 --> 02:08:09,620
We'll see you next week for our 19th birthday.

2607
02:08:09,620 --> 02:08:14,740
And hopefully some of you on Wednesday as well for the super fun cringe episode one

2608
02:08:14,740 --> 02:08:15,380
listen through.

2609
02:08:15,380 --> 02:08:16,900
So, uh, happy gaming.

2610
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:17,620
Have fun.

2611
02:08:17,620 --> 02:08:19,460
Uh, don't be one of those jerks online.

2612
02:08:19,460 --> 02:08:20,180
Be nice.

2613
02:08:20,180 --> 02:08:20,680
Bye.

2614
02:08:21,700 --> 02:08:24,340
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

2615
02:08:24,980 --> 02:08:31,220
