0	13640	Some former Ubisoft developers have founded a new development studio, Nesting Games,
13640	17800	and have announced their desire to return to, quote, RPGs that are focused on immersion,
17800	21040	great characters, powerful storytelling, and strong gameplay.
21040	24060	First comes the proclamation, then come the delays, then comes the face of the studio
24060	25480	making you their bitch.
25480	28560	Or at least that's what happened with Daikatana, and fingers crossed for Nesting that history
28560	29720	does not repeat.
29720	30720	This is just one hype train.
30720	33600	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about
33600	35000	this and the rest of the week's gaming news.
35000	37800	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
37800	44160	Hello, my friends, out there on the internet.
44160	48320	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
48320	54440	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are back with you live once again for this episode
54440	59200	number 884 tonight, September the 19th of 2021.
59200	64800	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you guys, and I am joined by my co-hosts.
64800	66680	Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Sommers.
66680	67680	Hi, Rob.
67680	69680	Look at my shirt.
69680	70680	Hi.
70680	71680	What's that?
71680	73320	Oh, it's Golden Girls.
73320	74320	Go for gold.
74320	75320	Is that what it says?
75320	78160	That's what it says, and I got it for three bucks at Target on clearance.
78160	79160	Okay.
79160	80160	Oh, hey.
80160	81160	Work.
81160	82160	Hey, we love a sale.
82160	83160	We sure do.
83160	85240	Yeah, but especially a Golden Girls sale.
85240	86240	Yes.
86240	87240	Yes.
87280	91160	We sure have licensed that Golden Girls stuff everywhere.
91160	94680	Like I see more of it now than I did in the 80s.
94680	95680	I mean, I was young.
95680	100040	I was still sad though that the spinoff never took off.
100040	101040	What was it?
101040	102040	Golden Palace?
102040	103040	The Golden Palace.
103040	104040	Yeah.
104040	105040	The Golden Palace.
105040	106040	On CBS, and it didn't have Bea Arthur.
106040	111920	It had the others running a hotel, and they added Don Cheadle was in it.
111920	113080	I remember.
113080	114920	That was one of his first roles.
114920	122720	And I think there was another person that's a little more famous now that was in it too
122720	125160	that played the cook, and I can't remember his name off the top of my head.
125160	129080	I don't remember either, but it was an interesting premise.
129080	133200	I thought it would have been really, really good, but alas.
133200	134200	Alas.
134200	139080	And also thanks to Fat Ninja Diem for the 205 bits.
139080	140080	Yes.
140080	142240	Usually we call that out at the end, but that's all right.
142240	144160	We can always take time for a special acknowledgement.
144400	147120	I just happened to see it, so I thought I'd say it.
147120	148800	Okay, Sia Tabiri says it was...
148800	152920	I was gonna say it was one of Cheech and Chong, but I wasn't 100% sure on it, but it was Cheech
152920	156360	Martin that was in it that played Chewie the chef.
156360	161080	So okay, I should have went with my gut, but I was like, well, if I'm wrong, I don't want
161080	162080	to be wrong.
162080	165200	I should have went with my gut.
165200	166200	We're human.
166200	168640	If we're wrong, I'm sure someone on the internet will call us out later.
168640	169640	Yes.
169640	172560	Someone on the internet will cancel us later for being wrong.
172560	175320	Say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.
175320	183440	Yeah, the only thing Golden Palace ever actually succeeded at, it was a chain of Chinese, Asian
183440	185120	buffet restaurants.
185120	190560	Yeah, not the TV show, yes.
190560	191560	How are you doing?
191560	192560	What's this game behind you tonight?
192560	194480	It looks like VR or something.
194480	196200	It's Power Washing Simulator.
196200	197400	Oh shit.
197400	200160	I've seen demos for that or trailers.
200160	201480	You haven't played it though.
201480	202480	I've heard it.
202480	203480	I haven't either.
203480	205160	Oh, it looks like fun.
205160	208840	Like in a very like, you know, chill out kind of way.
208840	210400	It does look like a lot of fun actually.
210400	211400	Yeah.
211400	212400	I need to pick that game up.
212400	219360	One of my Twitch friends, Luda Bell, she plays this on the weekends and it really is chill
219360	224720	like to the point that I'm trying, I need to see if it's available for Mac on Steam.
224720	229660	I want to do one of those games like Power Washing or like Cookie Clicker or something
229660	233180	like stream that where it's like, there really is no game.
233180	237700	It ends up being a just chatting stream, but with a game playing behind it.
237700	240780	So yeah, to add to that, I mean, there's a lot of games like that.
240780	243300	So there there's also now Lawnmower Sim.
243300	244300	Okay.
244300	245300	Yeah.
245300	251700	It's all the chores just, you know, honestly, honestly, gamify real life on resulting the
251700	252700	game.
252700	256540	Microsoft Flight Simulator is that too, like, sure.
256540	257540	It's a beautiful game.
257540	260740	And, you know, it's intricate with the takeoff and everything, especially if you play in
260740	261740	pro mode.
261740	265140	But once you get airborne, do you know what you do?
265140	271460	You fly and you watch the ground behind under you change as you fly in real time.
271460	277660	So if you're flying from, I don't know, say, O.L.R.'s hometown of Sacramento to Vegas,
277660	282900	you're going to fly for an hour over nothing.
282900	286380	The Mojave just like in real life, the Mojave Desert.
286420	290780	I was pointing out there is a new simulator, though, that's a gas station simulator.
290780	293460	Oh, I don't know about popularity right now.
293460	294460	Yeah.
294460	296980	All of these games I need to get buy them all.
296980	298900	We just really need our Washington, though.
298900	303780	We really need to thank the Penn and Teller because I think they started really the whole
303780	305300	thing with Desert Bus.
305300	307380	I'll acknowledge that.
307380	310940	I mean, I don't know if any of these devs would say they were inspired by Desert Bus,
310940	314060	but indirectly, perhaps they know they were in their hearts.
314060	317740	OK, did you say car washing simulator, Logie?
317740	318860	Gas station simulator.
318860	321300	Oh, because I'm pretty sure there's already a car wash.
321300	323020	We need a car washing simulator.
323020	326700	But I mean, technically, right now we're watching in power washing simulator.
326700	327940	It is car wash simulator.
327940	329180	So I want car.
329180	330180	Well, hear me out.
330180	332020	I want car washing simulator.
332020	338020	But with your choice, bikini, cheerleader, adult adult women, not the creepy stuff.
338020	340780	Bikini cheerleader, adult women or Speedo men.
340780	341780	Your choice.
342500	348780	If that's if that neither one is your approach, then cute animals are doing the washing for
348780	349780	you for you.
349780	350780	I know what we need.
350780	354260	We need a pet salon simulator.
354260	355260	Pet what?
355260	357020	I'm pet salon simulator.
357020	359100	All of these things exist.
359100	360100	Let's see.
360100	363020	So car wash simulator.
363020	365300	There is a car wash simulator already.
365300	368340	OK, good pet grooming simulator.
368340	369340	Perfect.
369340	370340	There is not.
370900	371900	Thank you.
371900	372900	Excellent choice.
372900	374900	Copyright Jamie.
374900	378300	Excellent, excellent alternative by Sia Tabiri in chat.
378300	383980	So I was saying either bikini women or Speedo men, or if neither is what you want, Sia Tabiri
383980	387060	says both Grimace and Birdie from McDonald's.
387060	388060	Perfect.
388060	392220	The McDonald's, the Hamburglar and all that.
392220	393220	What is it?
393220	394220	The McDonaldland friends.
394220	395220	McDonaldland friends.
395220	396220	I was like the McDonald gang.
396220	397220	What are they called?
398100	400100	They're called something.
400100	401100	They are definitely.
401100	402100	Well, the Hamburglar.
402100	403100	Hello.
403100	404100	It's definitely a gang.
404100	405100	And the Fry Guys.
405100	413380	But you know, the Grimace represents the feeling you have after eating too much McDonald's.
413380	417860	Do they still make those playgrounds with like the burgers that are just giant iron
417860	418860	cages for children?
418860	419860	They don't.
419860	422940	They stopped doing that in the 80s, but like I remember going in there.
423660	426500	We used to do that all the time.
426500	429220	You climb up into those giant cages that they have in it.
429220	432340	It's like, why would I want to go up in there?
432340	435660	Because there's like no way to get out if there's other kids in there.
435660	437340	Like you're like stuck in there.
437340	441020	So you better not be claustrophobic or anything because.
441020	442500	You know, it's dangerous.
442500	448540	Now they have like those mini pits like they had at Discovery Zone, you know, the little
448540	451180	crawl around and ball pit ball pit.
451180	452180	Yeah.
452420	456380	It's it's the new thing is it's not, I had friends, every zone, let's ball pit.
456380	460100	I had friends that worked at McDonald's growing up saying that the ball pit was a peepee poo
460100	461100	poo zone.
461100	462100	Like do not do that.
462100	464460	All right.
464460	467660	That is a, that is a high volume peepee poo poo zone.
467660	468660	Like don't do it.
468660	473580	Um, some, I used to go to the Discovery Zone with my brothers and while they were off playing,
473580	476220	I found this one little place that none of the kids would want to go in.
476220	478900	It was basically like a giant hammock and I'd take a nap.
479420	482820	Tiger Claw in chat says they should make a blockbuster simulator where you run the store.
482820	484460	That's that was on the show a few weeks ago.
484460	486860	It's a VR game coming to PlayStation, isn't it?
486860	489140	It was something like it was based on the last blockbuster.
489140	492580	Like I remember that being a thing that we talked about on the show.
492580	497380	SSJ 100 Matt says still have Mayor McCheese statues around that haven't been stolen over
497380	498780	the years by local teens.
498780	499780	Wow.
499780	500780	Those should be.
500780	505740	Yeah, most of the fast food restaurants around here have taken out their playground.
505740	509380	I haven't seen a playground in forever at a fast food restaurant.
509380	513660	There's still some, you know, who has one actually, Chick-fil-A has a playground inside.
513660	515140	They have a ball pit.
515140	516140	Interesting.
516140	517140	It's super tiny.
517140	519660	That's actually what I was thinking about when I was thinking about the fake Discovery
519660	524260	Zone was that, that one Chick-fil-A that Becky used to take her son to.
524260	525260	Huh.
525260	526260	Interesting.
526260	527260	All right.
527260	528260	Anyway, we don't support Chick-fil-A do we?
528260	533980	We could talk about playing in the, uh, uh, the ball pit at the local fast food restaurant,
533980	536340	but we also play video games in our spare time.
536340	541500	Let's get into tonight's kickoff topic, uh, which is a bit of a downer surprise, I guess.
541500	542500	I don't know.
542500	543500	Uh, Loki, this is, this is weird.
543500	544500	It's kind of came out of nowhere.
544500	546900	Loki, why don't you get into the kickoff topic for us tonight?
546900	551180	So yes, unfortunately, and I think that they were in the process of shutting these down.
551180	557500	It just wasn't shut down yet, but, uh, the servers for the little big planet content
557540	564540	for PlayStation three and Vita, um, have been shut down because apparently hackers have
564700	571700	gone in and, um, you know, they were, I guess, DDoSing the servers.
573060	579180	So they right now kept them down because they kept getting Melissa's, our, um, messages
579180	582860	left, um, by the hackers in the game as well.
582860	587700	And they weren't able to trace it back to, um, yeah, they trace it back to a single fan
587700	590460	who was unhappy with Sony's treatment of the franchise.
590460	592260	Yes, that's the perfect way.
592260	595380	So I'm unhappy with what you did with little big planet.
595380	597700	So I'm going to ruin it for everybody.
597700	598700	Ruined everything.
598700	600700	That's, that's, that's great.
600700	603460	Um, it has fucking kids today.
603460	607220	That kid was never locked inside of an iron McDonald's burger.
607220	608940	I guarantee it.
609180	615980	You haven't seen your life flash before your highs inside of a iron hamburger, but, um,
615980	620900	they have brought the little big planet three servers for PlayStation four back online after
620900	626180	a small update, but the PlayStation three, uh, trilogy and the Vita versions are now
626180	627820	permanently deactivated.
627820	635580	So all that user made content, um, all those Alanis more set, you know, uh, levels, they're
635580	637620	all lost to time now.
637620	642580	Um, the Parker Posey worship level, my favorite level that was ever in little big planet.
642580	643580	Yes.
643580	644580	Yeah.
644580	645580	The Parker Posey levels.
645580	646580	Yes.
646580	647580	That's sad.
647580	650460	Um, but I mean, also it's just the fact that it came out of nowhere and it's just, it's
650460	655060	just alarming that, you know, we, cause usually when these types of shutdowns happen, you
655060	656060	have warning, right?
656060	660140	Like, you know, or, or take that whole thing when Sony was like, we're going to close the
660140	662180	PlayStation three and the Vita stores.
662180	663180	Remember that?
663180	665860	And that got dialed back real quick after the feedback.
665860	670900	But, um, usually, I mean, you know, say, uh, foes, uh, on the Microsoft side of the fence,
670900	672220	but it's still the same thing.
672220	676740	Just this week, four is a motor sports seven was sunset it like just in the past few days.
676740	679580	Um, but there was a lot of warning that that was coming.
679580	683260	You know, they, they warn people, they gave the notice, they put the game on sale and
683260	684260	all this stuff.
684260	687660	Uh, but with little big planet, it's just kind of poof gone.
687660	692660	And especially considering what an iconic series that is on PlayStation, that's just
692660	694340	really a bummer.
694340	700020	Now granted, I'm almost certain little big planet three on PlayStation four was probably
700020	705900	a giveaway game, like multiple times, whether it was on PlayStation plus or that whole,
705900	710940	um, at home with PlayStation event during the pandemic, I'm almost positive that game
710940	715100	has come up at some point, but it's, it still sucks, especially on the Vita front.
715100	719840	I mean, the PS three is one thing, but that means no more portable little big planet outside
719840	720840	the single player levels.
720840	723740	Yeah, it's a bummer.
723740	732220	So, um, yeah, I mean, does it, do you think this, um, might discourage people from contributing
732220	736980	to these sorts of communities knowing and having that reminder that their work is in
736980	738980	somebody else's hands at the end of the day?
738980	739980	Really?
739980	740980	No, I don't think so.
740980	741980	No.
741980	746660	One of these days, all those Roblox creations people are making, they're just gonna poof
746660	747660	into the night
747660	751380	and my kids will be disappointed.
751380	754920	My kids won't be disappointed by that time, but, uh, they'll probably be in their thirties
754920	755920	by that time.
755920	760140	There's a lot of content like the little big planet stuff, you know, there's a lot of content
760140	766280	that was good and there's also a lot more content that wasn't so good.
766280	772640	And honestly, that's kind of where Roblox is that music licensing and, or the, uh, piracy
772640	777760	and all sorts of assets and IPs and whatnot, and it's just a wild west of craziness there
777760	781000	that is going to be smacked down at some point.
781000	785240	But yeah, well, little big planet had a lot of those problems as well.
785240	788680	I think they started to crack down on it a little bit, but I'm pretty sure it was a copyright
788680	792000	wild wild west in many ways now.
792000	795680	And it is, you know, we still have to emphasize if I really, really, really want to play the
795680	799580	Parker Posey level all the way back from little big planet one, or I want to play the Bobby
799580	803480	Black Wolf show advertisement level that he was showing off on his show tonight because
803480	806800	we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the
806800	810840	voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf
810840	811840	show.
811840	814960	I don't think I said that yet tonight, but he had his ad level that was in little big
814960	816120	planet one.
816120	821460	And I technically could still play that on my PS4 copy of a little big planet three,
821460	827140	but for how much long longer, you know, and it sounds like even then those servers were
827140	829360	down for a while while they tried to fix them.
829360	833480	And whatever they had to do to fix it, they couldn't even deploy to the old games because
833480	834960	there's no resources.
834960	835960	There's no money.
835960	836960	There's no time.
836960	840320	There's no all of the above.
840320	841320	Pretty much.
841320	842320	Yeah.
842320	848200	So some days it's a reminder someday, all of these things that we put into video games,
848200	851720	all of these cosmetics that we buy for video games will go away.
851720	855280	One of these days, all that money, dark soccer and I have spent on dead by daylight cosmetics
855280	856280	will be worth nothing.
856500	857500	They will go away.
857500	862020	You mean all the money I've spent on dead by daylight cosmetics, uh, for you or pillars
862020	863020	for you?
863020	868700	Well, I did buy all the steam stuff myself, but yes, my Xbox, my ground level support
868700	869700	was all you.
869700	871700	I bought you some steam.
871700	873060	Oh yeah, you did.
873060	874060	You did.
874060	875060	You did.
875060	876060	Did I buy you pig?
876060	877060	I think so.
877060	880620	Right when I was first getting on steam, but there was, there was a point where I bought
880620	881980	every single thing I was missing.
881980	883420	They were having like a 70% off.
883600	887720	I bought every single thing I was missing except for Ash from Evil Dead.
887720	890440	It's the one DLC I don't have cause I don't need it.
890440	895680	Well, his perks are shit and I don't really, I don't really, you really want to run metal
895680	896800	of man, Rob.
896800	897800	You really want it.
897800	899280	No, no, no I don't.
899280	900280	Anyway.
900280	910080	Um, I, I actually, uh, was in a match on someone doing adept Ash and when I realized it, I
910080	913040	felt so sorry for them.
913060	914740	I just let him go.
914740	918820	Mike Defton chat says, speaking of things not available now, four is the motorsport
918820	919820	seven.
919820	920820	I forgot to buy it.
920820	921820	Whoops.
921820	925300	Well, the good news is get it on disc because they can't take those away now.
925300	927820	I mean the online servers are down.
927820	931460	Uh, so you'll miss out on that part of it, but you can still play the base game if you
931460	932860	can find a disc somewhere.
932860	937580	Um, but yeah, as far as getting to play the version that comes with game pass, not, yeah,
937580	941460	that, that opportunity has gone on by and, and technically with little big plan and all
941460	947100	that stuff, you can still play the base games, um, because they're not online, but I mean
947100	948720	online was kind of the best part.
948720	952520	I mean, it's a, it's a decent platformer, especially the first one was pretty good.
952520	958020	Um, but you know, the best parts are online, uh, chewy two 40 and chat says, I like little
958020	961800	big planet, but now there's dreams, sack boy, et cetera.
961800	963500	You do make a good point with dreams.
963500	967220	Sack boy is kind of a different game with the same, like it's just a platformer.
967220	970560	There's not, not really the same user content, at least to my knowledge didn't really open
970560	972340	it up for user content the same way.
972340	973340	But dreams.
973340	974340	Yes.
974340	975880	That was very much like wide open.
975880	978120	And so yeah, dreams is definitely a thing still.
978120	983920	Um, but for how long wamp wamp, like it's just one of those things that we have to realize,
983920	986900	you know, one of these days, it's just, it's very possible.
986900	990200	It just disappears and that's it.
990200	992920	So wild stuff.
992920	993920	Yeah.
993920	994920	Indeed.
994920	995920	All right.
995920	997960	Well, let's talk about, Oh, go ahead.
997960	1000120	I do want to give a shout out right now.
1000960	1004280	To, uh, another streamer puddings for happy birthday.
1004280	1005280	Oh yeah.
1005280	1007640	I caught a little bit of his birthday stream last night.
1007640	1008640	Happy birthday.
1008640	1016420	I, I made a pig card, but I figured a birthday shout out was, it was an order.
1016420	1019760	Let's move on to our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games that we've
1019760	1021120	been playing this week.
1021120	1023080	And we'll go to our soccer first.
1023520	1032720	Dead by daylight, duh, and, uh, Fantasian, which, um, I, um, I got another boss battle
1032720	1037220	done one of the other quests and get more of my people back.
1037220	1039480	And I'm having a really good time with Fantasian.
1039480	1047040	This is, uh, uh, a really solid RPG with a really solid story and lots of room for me
1047040	1050300	to make fun of how stupid the characters can be sometimes.
1050300	1052760	Is part two, the last part, do we know?
1052760	1053760	Like honest question.
1053760	1054760	I don't know.
1054760	1060200	Part two, Rob is technically not a real part two.
1060200	1062200	It's an expansion of the first game.
1062200	1063200	Oh, interesting.
1063200	1064200	Okay.
1064200	1068580	So like when I load Fantasian, I am loading my current install.
1068580	1069580	It just updated.
1069580	1070580	Oh, okay.
1070580	1078920	And, uh, it was having some problems where like, um, it would like, I would be a boss
1078920	1085480	battle or some big battle and my game would freeze and that seems to have already been
1085480	1086480	patched out.
1086480	1087480	Um, there was another patch.
1087480	1090420	If anyone else is playing it, there's a patch that came out just the other day.
1090420	1097820	And also side note, if you have any, um, uh, Apple products update your operating system
1097820	1104840	now, if you haven't already, uh, uh, make sure your iPhones, iPads, whatever Mac all
1104840	1105840	up to date.
1105840	1112720	Uh, cause there was a, uh, a security breached from some Israeli spyware company.
1112720	1114000	And so that's been patched out.
1114000	1117380	Just, just putting the word out there, making sure people are in the know.
1117380	1120960	My sister texted me about that and I've never known her to be a tech person.
1120960	1121960	That was interesting.
1121960	1125680	She's like, did you update your phone?
1125680	1127520	It was pretty big.
1127520	1128520	It was pretty big deal.
1128520	1133080	Yeah, no, I, I then saw the, the stories on sites and things like that, but anyway, okay.
1133080	1136320	Well, and of course, if you have an Apple watch, once you update your phone, you have
1136320	1138320	to update your watch and everything.
1138320	1145680	So, um, but anyway, um, of course, uh, with those two, um, I've picked up, what was it
1145680	1150960	that I still don't remember that other game that I picked up, but, um, I want to sit down
1150960	1154720	and do slay the spire and I need to sit down with final fantasy 14 and actually, if I can
1154720	1161260	play the game, um, which I'm thinking about making that like a midweek stream, just like
1161260	1167340	an hour and a half of, uh, final fantasy, do something a little different, you know,
1167340	1171860	branch out, do the variety.
1171860	1172860	Who am I kidding?
1172860	1174860	I'm going to go back to dead by daylight.
1174860	1175860	Anyway.
1175860	1176860	All right.
1176860	1180860	Anything else for a game a week?
1180860	1183020	Um, Oh yeah.
1183020	1184020	Pinball.
1184020	1189780	Oh, we, we got our, um, our Metallica back.
1189780	1193820	And of course, uh, Dan's, uh, creature from the black lagoon is back and I played a little
1193820	1200540	bit of it and, uh, so yeah, a little bit, a little bit pinball friend and for good measure.
1200540	1202540	All right.
1202540	1204340	A little bit of pinball is always good.
1204340	1206340	Uh, Loki, how about you?
1206340	1208780	How was your gaming week?
1208780	1210060	I didn't play a whole ton.
1210060	1215460	I played more Minecraft, put out new episode of, um, my series.
1215460	1216460	So that's out on YouTube.
1216460	1217460	Now.
1217460	1224420	Um, I did check out a little bit, uh, uh, cruise and blast on the switch, which it's,
1224420	1225500	it's all right.
1225500	1230900	It's not excite truck, but it's, you know, it's, it's, it's a cruise in game.
1230900	1235740	And the only complaint I would have with it, and I'm sure it's just intentional is that
1235740	1241740	it's, it's like someone took the game and bumped the saturation to like 20.
1241740	1247660	It's just like ridiculously garishly colorful, like to a point.
1247660	1252700	That's like actually irritating to look at, um, but aside from that though, my, my kids
1252700	1253700	like it.
1253700	1260380	Uh, my son's already beat the game and unlocked everything, but, um, yeah, it's, it's, I was
1260380	1266860	hoping for like something that's kind of excite truck ish, but it's, it's, it's not, nothing
1266860	1268260	will ever capture my heart.
1268260	1269860	Like excite truck.
1269860	1277820	Oh, well maybe zero could, no, there's an F zero chance of that game ever happening
1277820	1281060	at this point, which is depressing, but reality.
1281060	1282060	Yeah.
1282060	1284360	So that, that's it.
1284360	1286220	That's all I really did this week.
1286220	1287220	Cool.
1287220	1291220	Um, my gaming week, uh, I didn't get around to buying the new warrior where I was kind
1291220	1295220	of surprised at myself, but still, uh, trucking along with some of the stuff that I've been
1295220	1296220	playing.
1296220	1305180	Uh, and then let's see, I also played some dead by daylight.
1305180	1310300	Oh, something I learned about that actually, that applies to lots of PC based games, uh,
1310300	1312180	or cause I'm playing on that platform.
1312180	1317500	Um, but worth explaining and, um, shout out to a streamer I watch a lot and I know he's
1317500	1322480	been here in chat before, uh, Tay from Tay plays games with the Y, um, he was talking
1322480	1326840	to me about the Nvidia settings, which I've never played with, but you have to have an
1326840	1328060	Nvidia graphics card.
1328060	1331880	I imagine there's gotta be a similar thing on the AMD side.
1331880	1334720	I'm not trying to be a graphics card fan boy.
1334720	1336720	Like Nvidia is just what I ended up with.
1336720	1339520	I do not have a particular brand loyalty in this whole thing.
1339520	1341360	I'm going to tell you, that was my last card.
1341360	1345060	I'm going to tell you what I learned for my device and I'm sure there's something similar
1345060	1347160	for the competition out there.
1347160	1348160	Okay.
1348160	1351680	But Nvidia has this thing called the G force experience, which I've, I've not really played
1351680	1356160	around with a lot because it has like an in-game thing and I've always kind of ignored
1356160	1358740	it because my assumption was I probably slows the game down.
1358740	1361360	I'm just going to not load it and sideload it or whatever.
1361360	1366060	But Tay was telling me that you can actually really apply some filters in that, that really
1366060	1367680	make your game look a lot better.
1367680	1371000	And I've always noticed when he's streaming, I'm always like, your game looks a little
1371000	1375640	bit sharper than most people I see streaming Dead by Daylight and it's this Nvidia thing.
1375640	1381400	So I just throwing it out there, if you are an Nvidia person and you've never played around
1381400	1389280	with the G force thing, take a look at it because there's some valuable sliders in there.
1389280	1394080	You go into, you load the experience and then you hit the alt Z to access it and there's
1394080	1395920	like a filter mode.
1395920	1399600	I think you can hit alt F3 to access it directly.
1399600	1404360	And you can actually, it's like, like on your TV, you adjust the brightness, contrast, sharpness,
1404360	1407800	but you can change some other things too.
1407800	1412760	And I actually got my Dead by Daylight game to look quite a bit better thanks to that
1412760	1413760	tip.
1413760	1414760	So shout out to Tay.
1414760	1421920	I did that on my PC before with, when I was playing, I mean, gosh, it was my card before
1421920	1424960	that, but it was also a G force.
1424960	1429000	And I had to do a little bit of tweaking like that for when I ran the high res mods for
1429000	1430000	Mass Effect.
1430000	1431000	Yeah.
1431000	1432000	Yeah.
1432000	1433000	Yeah.
1433000	1436560	And Tiger Claw also brings out, G force experience has a feature that will optimize the games
1436560	1440000	to run better based on the GPU that you have.
1440000	1441920	Also not every single game is supported on it.
1441920	1442920	Um, yes, that's true.
1442920	1448480	And I actually, that feature I have used before, but I've also found that it doesn't always
1448480	1451760	optimize performance versus frames.
1451760	1455520	You have to manually go in there when you're going to optimize, you hit the little wrench
1455520	1459280	and you kind of bring it down a little bit so that you do get a little, cause I prefer
1459280	1465520	frames actually over, uh, I am all for the extra frames, save the animals.
1465520	1469360	I want extra frames because it's a smooth, smooth experience.
1469360	1473200	Um, so, uh, yeah, so I prefer performance.
1473200	1479240	Um, but, and you, I have found in my experience that that thing prefers quality, which I mean,
1479240	1480240	I get it.
1480240	1481240	It's a video card.
1481240	1485240	They want to show off, but just kind of keep that in the back of your mind.
1485240	1489880	Fifth dream in our chat at twitch.tv slash vog network says I use the filters all the
1489880	1490880	time.
1490880	1495320	At minimum, it helps with gamma and color adjustments, but you really can get in there.
1495320	1501360	I've made fallout look like borderlands, lol, yeah, like, and honestly, um, go on places
1501360	1506840	like Reddit that have people that are posting their specs.
1506840	1510600	Tay just screenshotted all his settings and put it in his discord.
1510600	1514640	So I just copied everything he had, but I started cause I was like, Oh, if there's this,
1514640	1519920	I wonder what there is for final fantasy 14, another PC game I play a lot of.
1519920	1523640	And uh, I went to go look that up and there were some ideas and thoughts with how to make
1523640	1524640	that game look better.
1524640	1527760	So, um, the internet, it's a big resource.
1527760	1528760	Use it.
1528760	1532280	Uh, that being said, I also played a little bit of final fantasy 14 this week.
1532280	1536040	Um, just because with the big patch stream that happened this week, we'll talk about
1536040	1537320	that later in the show.
1537320	1541480	It made me go, Oh yeah, I gotta, I gotta get some shit done before end Walker.
1541480	1547680	Um, and I got my monk to 60, which means every class is at least 60.
1547680	1550680	Every class has beaten heaven's word in that regard.
1550680	1553920	Now I just need to get everything to 80, but I only have three classes left to go.
1553920	1554920	So I'll get there.
1554920	1555920	I'll get there before the expansion.
1555920	1559080	Uh, and then quickly on the dead by daylight front, since dark soccer, you brought up a
1559080	1560520	depths earlier.
1560520	1564240	I got adept tap, uh, of all characters.
1564240	1565240	I'm just ranting.
1565240	1566240	Interesting.
1566240	1567240	Well, there's survivors.
1567240	1568240	He's got good perks.
1568240	1569240	He does have good perks.
1569240	1573120	And I really want, so, you know, Chris is my main in dead by daylight, right?
1573120	1579340	And in dead by daylight, you get the, um, you have to play other survivors to a certain
1579340	1583380	level to get their perks, to show up in all the survivors, blood trees.
1583380	1584700	And that's how you level them.
1584700	1586900	So the one I just did was ACE.
1586900	1588180	I did ACE Visconti.
1588180	1591260	Um, I'll say it was for my husband, but it actually wasn't.
1591260	1596340	I wanted that perk open-handed that increases your aura readings because, uh, Kindred plus
1596340	1601960	open-handed and solo queue, beautiful, beautiful, uh, combo of perks for survivors.
1601960	1602960	For the record.
1602960	1603960	Hmm.
1603960	1604960	I did a thing.
1604960	1607100	Oh, did you play survivor of the first time finally?
1607100	1609460	No, but I put points in Meg.
1609460	1611500	Oh, you're preparing.
1611500	1612500	You're preparing.
1612620	1613620	I'm preparing.
1613620	1617660	So I have to take a little side route cause, uh, you know, Finara, right?
1617660	1618660	My friend.
1618660	1619660	Yeah.
1619660	1622940	Um, I'm planning on doing a little TikTok series.
1622940	1629620	That's basically just like a bunch of Mimi stuff with, uh, with pig and Meg and David.
1629620	1631200	Okay.
1631200	1636420	And so we've been talking about, uh, like getting everything together and doing it.
1636420	1641100	And I figured, well, if I'm going to have, you know, cause I might have to do survivor
1641100	1642700	in a custom.
1642700	1650220	So I figured I'm actually going to learn survivor on, on, as I call her, the Meglet.
1650220	1657820	And uh, rather than just use all of my survivors as a, as a, excuse me, as a fashion show.
1657820	1658820	Okay.
1658820	1660180	Serena's new outfits though.
1660180	1661180	Oh my God.
1661180	1662180	All right.
1662180	1663180	But, um, yes.
1663180	1664660	It's iconic.
1664660	1670820	So yes, I got, um, so after I was done with this, I went to tap because I want his, um,
1670820	1674540	the, the, the, the thing that shows you the auras of all the totems and the gens every
1674540	1677540	time a gen pops, it's great for comboing with a map.
1677540	1681100	Um, what about using that with Jill's totem perk?
1681100	1683240	Uh, honestly, yes.
1683240	1689400	And you, I think that his, uh, perk is better than Jill's perk, but if you have a map, either
1689400	1690400	are effective.
1690400	1691400	Gotcha.
1691400	1692400	I have a hard time.
1692400	1695860	I mean, usually when I see a tap in the game, I'm just like, oh, he's going to be up to
1695860	1696860	shit.
1696900	1702300	You know, if, if I'm in a game that I've got, uh, like ruin or something going live in,
1702300	1704380	I usually go after tap first.
1704380	1705500	Tap also has that great ability.
1705500	1706500	Sorry.
1706500	1709020	I won't go too far down the DVD, but Hey, we spend a lot of time on it, but this real
1709020	1711420	quick note, it's only a mass effect.
1711420	1717220	Has that great ability where he can crawl while he's charging his meter.
1717220	1720860	That's pretty odd, but it's, it's a little bit situational, but in a lot of games I've
1720860	1725420	played, that's a, that's a clutch ability if, uh, you're running it, which, you know,
1725420	1729380	that's the hardest part of Dead by Daylight is which four perks do you pick?
1729380	1732140	I get a little worried when I see a tap in a match.
1732140	1737380	Um, uh, well he, he is the, he is the pig's antithesis.
1737380	1746140	So it's, it's appropriate for you to not like tap on just on principle.
1746140	1747140	For the record.
1747140	1751380	I have been sharing the gospel of resident pig goo and the alternate version silent pig
1751380	1752380	goo.
1752380	1753380	Yes.
1753380	1756660	Your, your build that, uh, consumes people with the traps.
1756660	1757660	Very easy.
1757660	1758660	Yes.
1758660	1759660	I know.
1759660	1760660	Isn't it great?
1760660	1761660	Y'all.
1761660	1762660	Y'all.
1762660	1763660	Um, I know dark soccer talks a lot about dead by daylight on this show.
1763660	1767860	It is like she said, it's the new mass effect, but y'all don't understand.
1767860	1768860	It doesn't matter.
1768860	1769860	Like, and I don't know.
1769860	1770860	I don't know how she does it.
1770860	1773500	You guys, I will go into a random person.
1773500	1774500	I follow that.
1774500	1777660	I'm just watching play dead by daylight and I'm like, Hey, how's it going?
1777660	1781860	And it'll be immediately like before the streamer even sees it suddenly dark soccer.
1781860	1788540	OLR says, Rob, Rob, stop following me, Rob, you say the same thing to me.
1788540	1789540	I do.
1789540	1790540	I do.
1790540	1795740	It's, it's a love fest, but I think you name check Putin's earlier.
1795740	1797380	I think he finds it funny.
1797380	1800060	So yeah, put, put, put in things is really funny.
1800060	1802300	I mean, he's, he's just adorable anyway.
1802300	1805060	And I think we've done it in Nick's chat a couple of times too.
1805060	1806060	Yeah.
1806060	1808820	I've been in random people's chats and you're there somehow.
1808820	1810580	I'm like, does she have four windows open?
1810580	1811580	How does she do it?
1811580	1814700	Well, I'll sometimes make it into somebody's chat on a raid.
1814700	1821620	Like when I've been off doing something else and I'll be like, Oh, new person, follow Rob,
1821620	1824820	which for the record, I'm actually really jealous of Nick right now because he's in
1824820	1825820	Cabo.
1825820	1826820	Oh, is that where he went?
1826820	1827820	I knew it was on the case.
1827820	1828820	All right.
1828820	1830640	Anyway, look, I want to go jealous.
1830640	1831640	We need to go to it.
1831640	1833740	We need to take an LA trip less.
1833740	1835860	I am taking an LA trip actually.
1835860	1836860	I just take me.
1836860	1840180	In fact, I have to tell you guys, I'm not going to be here the last weekend of October
1840180	1845020	because here's the thing, look, I know, I know you're going to understand dark Sakura
1845020	1847100	and Loki, you'll be fine with it.
1847100	1851720	I haven't seen Victoria in like a long time and her birthday's at the end of October.
1851720	1854740	For those of you that listen to shaking and crying back in the day.
1854740	1858960	So I was like, Victoria, I'm coming down to Southern California and she's like, yes.
1858960	1861740	So that, that's the thing that's going to happen.
1861740	1862740	Absolutely.
1862740	1867360	So speaking of friends, before we get into some gaming news tonight, I wanted to give
1867360	1873300	a shout out to a dragon con friend of mine and a Kickstarter that they are doing.
1873300	1878380	And I said, you know, usually I'm a little with plugging Kickstarters, but I know the
1878380	1883120	person behind this one, so I know it will be something that's going to be a huge success
1883120	1884720	and it's not quite video games.
1884720	1887360	It's a little bit different, but I think it's still adjacent.
1887360	1888640	It's a gaming type.
1888640	1890840	So I want to give a plug.
1890840	1895880	This is one of the creators of botched, which is a D and D podcast who is doing a Kickstarter.
1895880	1900560	It's about the story of Solomon, a man from a time long forgotten, thrust into responsibility.
1900560	1904420	He must decide how far he's willing to go in order to protect those he cares about.
1904420	1909380	The consequences of desperate decisions leads to the world's first werewolf.
1909380	1915060	This is lichen Solomon's Odyssey, a fully illustrated 60 page graphic novel.
1915060	1917120	The first in an ongoing series.
1917120	1920360	If you're interested in supporting a project more than 10 years in the making, you can
1920360	1928520	search for lichen, L-Y-C-A-N, Solomon's Odyssey on Kickstarter or head over to www.hiveheadstudios.com
1928520	1933920	or even clockfox.net because Dennis has some really weird patrons.
1933920	1937760	The project is already over 50% funded in its first week.
1937760	1939200	I think it's on like week three now.
1939200	1940200	I haven't checked in.
1940200	1944320	It's probably already funded by this point, but I wanted to make sure I gave Dennis and
1944320	1945440	that Kickstarter again.
1945440	1950360	It's lichen Solomon's Odyssey, a shout out right here on OLR.
1950360	1951360	So let's move on.
1951360	1954080	We got some other gaming news to get into.
1954080	1957400	Let's start with Loki and gaming news.
1957400	1958480	Yeah.
1958480	1964860	So Gran Turismo 7 is confirmed to be always online.
1964860	1968560	So that was something that was kind of shown off a little bit earlier this week.
1968560	1974880	And then, yeah, so that that's a nice piece considering how stable all of our internets
1974880	1977180	are.
1977180	1979960	And eventually, you know, it just may not work at all.
1979960	1985300	But yeah, so it's going to be basically unplayable if you drop the Internet because of all the
1985300	1989720	online features and anti-cheat that they have going on with it.
1989720	1998240	But apparently, you know, they had some questions regarding this decision, obviously, and why
1998240	2000920	they went ahead and did that.
2000920	2006580	He said the online connection won't be necessary for arcade mode because it doesn't impact
2006580	2008420	your game save file.
2008420	2012800	But anything else like the online connection is required for the campaign mode.
2012800	2016240	The only part of the game that doesn't require online connection is the arcade mode because
2016240	2017540	it has no effect on your save data.
2017540	2018680	So that's possible.
2018680	2021960	But anything that has to do with save data requires a connection.
2021960	2028180	For example, delivery, like delivery data, as well as something that's downloaded from
2028180	2033420	an online server.
2033420	2039940	I hate these kind of like always online games, but you don't know that going in, I guess.
2039940	2042420	Well, here's Yeah, no, no, what you're getting into.
2042420	2043500	That's the most important thing.
2043500	2047960	But I've got to be honest, ever since Diablo three in 2006, and the beginning of this whole
2047960	2053200	debate with the always online thing, and I not to completely compare the two because
2053200	2057580	Diablo three had that whole trash real money store that they ended up getting rid of and
2057580	2058620	all that stuff anyway.
2058620	2063100	But it definitely was the catalyst for the really the first time I think the always online
2063100	2064640	debate was really starting.
2064640	2068620	And now here we are what like 15 years later, has it been 15 years since Diablo three's
2068620	2069620	been out?
2069620	2075780	I remember I remember was it SimCity it's impossible to run this without it being connected
2075780	2076780	online.
2076780	2082500	Oh, yeah, that was like, it's like no, no, that was a big lie.
2082500	2091540	Um, yeah, you know, right now, it's basically, you know, to ward off cheaters, I guess.
2091540	2099060	Because you know, as a person that plays video games, there is no cheating in it online games.
2099060	2103920	It is a place where cheaters just haven't been able to penetrate that game we never
2103920	2105900	shut up about dead by daylight.
2105900	2111020	There's cheaters in matches and what dark soccer surely never come across any of those.
2111020	2112420	There's no cheaters.
2112420	2118160	It's online online, it has to be online because otherwise cheating is possible.
2118160	2124300	I mean, that is obviously means that there's no cheating online.
2124300	2129900	I mean, clearly, this is the world we live in where it is impossible.
2129900	2135280	It is just a fact that this is stupid and I really wish they wouldn't do this.
2135280	2137740	But I don't care because I don't have a PlayStation five.
2137740	2141980	I wouldn't be buying this game anyways, because I don't really like simulation racing games.
2142540	2146940	Okay, okay, but you say you don't care because it's not my thing until it is your thing and
2146940	2148340	then you're gonna care.
2148340	2149340	Because this is the way the end.
2149340	2152500	And this is what I really want to talk about is I feel like this is the way the industry
2152500	2153740	is going.
2153740	2157180	As much as we do not like these always online things.
2157180	2159100	I don't know, I'm a little bit torn.
2159100	2162980	Like of course, there's things about it I don't like because I feel like internet connections
2162980	2166580	aren't and from my perspective, it's because internet connections aren't always stable
2166580	2168680	internet gets knocked offline.
2168680	2173600	Not a lot of games respond well to losing internet for even a couple seconds.
2173600	2178360	Like when the game can handle losing internet for five minutes or so I'm a little more open
2178360	2179360	to it.
2179360	2181880	But you know how some games like the second you lose internet, it's like kicked out to
2181880	2186340	the title screen, which is ridiculous.
2186340	2187600	But I feel like it's inevitable.
2187600	2189000	This is where the industry is going.
2189000	2191860	And it's in a way it's because of cheaters.
2191860	2195240	And I think it's because and yes, Loki, I know you say that tongue in cheek like what
2195240	2196520	there's no cheaters.
2196520	2200580	But it does seem like there's a lot less of them when the game is always online.
2200580	2205120	I feel like, like whether we like it or not, this is where the industry is going to end
2205120	2211240	up is always online, especially as more, especially when we start getting rid of the wires with
2211240	2212240	the internet.
2212240	2213420	And that's going to happen in 10 years.
2213420	2215240	I've said that before on this show.
2215240	2221560	By the time we're in our 50s doing this show, the internet is going to completely be wireless.
2221560	2224640	It's going to be 5g and all that stuff.
2224640	2227160	And there's not even going to be the wires anymore with it.
2227160	2232000	And when it's internet is literally like everywhere.
2232000	2233900	It's going to be that they're going to put the games online.
2233900	2236720	And I know everybody's going to have the what about scenario?
2236720	2238780	What about this rural part of the country?
2238780	2243760	What about this particular, you know, place in another country that doesn't have a stable
2243760	2244760	internet stretch?
2244760	2250000	I'm going to tell you as hard as it is to hear, there's going to come a time when PlayStation,
2250000	2253720	Microsoft, all these companies are going to run the numbers and they're going to say,
2253720	2261000	well, you know what, we can make this always online and we might be putting 2.78% of gamers
2261000	2262460	at risk.
2262460	2264760	We're just going to have to write them off.
2264760	2268820	They'll just get Jay Allard to come out there and he'll say, hey, have you considered living
2268820	2270660	in a place that has internet?
2270660	2272920	I mean, come on.
2272920	2276480	So yeah, I get that.
2276480	2278540	And I get where they want to go with that.
2278540	2280860	And a lot of people's internet is okay.
2280860	2282820	It's not our internet that I'm worried about.
2282820	2287840	It's their internet, their stupid servers that I'm, I would think is the most unreliable
2287840	2289680	part of the whole thing.
2289680	2294940	I mean, you know, when people were trying to connect to Diablo 3, it wasn't that our
2294940	2296160	internet sucked.
2296160	2301360	It was that their servers suck because they cheap out on servers or they do these scalable
2301360	2305320	server thing that can't keep up with the demand for the game.
2305320	2311900	So I just don't trust game industry, the game industry as a whole, I guess is really what
2311900	2313680	it is.
2313680	2319920	Yeah, I mean, I understand the, I guess pessimism.
2319920	2322040	I don't know what else to call it, but I get it.
2322040	2326740	Like the game industry has definitely shown that they will use these things for more like
2326740	2329080	selfish related purposes and so forth.
2329080	2333040	And they want it to be always online so they can push more loot boxes and that sort of
2333040	2334040	thing.
2334040	2336560	Let's get that roadmap for our service stability.
2336560	2337880	I can't wait.
2337880	2338880	Sorry.
2338880	2344820	We've heard your feedback and, and we're going to really try to make our service better.
2344820	2347940	Here's a roadmap of like where we're going to go with that.
2347940	2354260	And yeah, play your role, Sony.
2354260	2356900	You've heard your feedback and chosen to ignore it.
2356900	2358460	Here's, here's the thing though.
2358460	2359660	Like I've got to be honest though.
2359660	2365940	Oh, I don't know about you guys, but like most of the games I play right now are always
2365940	2368620	online and I've come to accept that.
2368620	2371360	Final Fantasy 14, MMO, of course is always online.
2371360	2375360	Dead by Daylight, Competitive Gaming, of course is always online and those are two of my biggest
2375360	2376360	time scenes.
2376360	2380740	Cookie Clicker has, no, okay, Cookie Clicker is offline now with us on Steam.
2380740	2384720	But there's, you know, more and more games I feel like I'm playing that kind of are always
2384720	2387360	online and I've just kind of come to accept it.
2387360	2394320	But I guess on the other hand, you have the Nintendo Switch and insert LOL Nintendo online
2394320	2396180	joke here.
2396180	2400240	But there's also the fact that that magical world I talked about where wireless internet
2400240	2401240	is everywhere.
2401240	2402400	We don't live in it yet.
2402400	2407320	And so the Switch being a portable system, the games on that system kind of can't be
2407320	2414480	always online unless it is, you know, a backbone of the game, ie Pokemon Unite, let's say.
2414480	2418140	You expect that's going to be always online because again, competitive game.
2418140	2424000	You're playing online with others, but that, that system kind of can't do this yet.
2424000	2428700	So Quest Buster in chat says hugs Switch.
2428700	2435140	Yes, it's interesting how sometimes the Switch lagging behind is actually a benefit to them.
2435140	2437140	It is never a benefit to them.
2437140	2440540	We just give them such a pass because we like their games.
2440540	2441540	It is not a benefit.
2441540	2446860	They're, they're, they're starting to go towards an evil company type of route.
2446860	2447860	Yeah.
2447860	2448860	They make good games.
2448860	2449860	Okay.
2449860	2452300	There's lots of people that like games from Activision and stuff like that.
2452300	2456760	And some of their games are okay, but we give them such a pass for all this stupid
2456760	2460820	bullshit that they do because of their stupid online service and stuff.
2460820	2461820	It sucks ass.
2461820	2462820	Okay.
2462820	2463820	There we go.
2463820	2464820	It sucks.
2464820	2465820	It is pathetic.
2465820	2471320	If it was anybody else with that online service, if Microsoft had their online service, we
2471320	2473920	would be bitching and moaning about their shit.
2473920	2476080	So give it up for Nintendo.
2476080	2477080	You fucking idiots.
2477080	2482040	They can't get your shit right for like decades now.
2482040	2486180	I feel like you would give me a new goddamn Mario Odyssey game.
2486180	2487180	Don't mince words.
2487180	2488180	Tell us how you, how you really feel.
2488180	2489420	I feel like you're upset.
2489420	2490420	Loki.
2490420	2491420	Do you need to know?
2491420	2492780	I'm just, I don't really care.
2492780	2495580	Like honestly, like it's just, they're not going to, they're going to do whatever they
2495580	2496580	want.
2496580	2498380	They're going to put out their switch, a letter, whatever.
2498380	2502740	They're not really going to address the issues for like their, their services.
2502740	2506100	There's going to be third party companies that do their games better than them.
2506100	2509700	Like we have with the Nickelodeon all star stuff where their net code is better.
2509700	2510700	Okay.
2510700	2511700	That game's not out yet though.
2512360	2513360	Hold up.
2513360	2514360	Hold up.
2514360	2516360	Do not put that game on a pedestal because we saw how PlayStation all stars was kind
2516360	2517360	of mad.
2517360	2522160	I will, you know what, we'll give it a few weeks to see, you know, that they've done
2522160	2523160	it better.
2523160	2524160	I hope it is good.
2524160	2525160	Like, don't get me wrong.
2525160	2526160	I am rooting for that game.
2526160	2529400	Uh, and let, I, except I don't think we're going to get moose from, you can't do that
2529400	2533600	on television as a playable character, so I'm a little upset about that, but I'll still
2533600	2534600	support the game.
2534600	2536740	Maybe there's DLC.
2536740	2539040	Whatever happened to Christine?
2539040	2544700	Um, is it weird that I think I know, I think I fell on down a Wikipedia black hole when
2544700	2546340	I, she's like a TV producer now.
2546340	2550540	It's like what a lot of like child actors end up being TV producers and I think she's
2550540	2552540	one of them.
2552540	2559900	So anyway, uh, going in chat because Loki's Christine McGlade founder, uh, Loki's little
2559900	2563140	uh, tirade, uh, ended up getting some chat comments.
2563140	2568820	Uh, Mike Defton chat says being honest, Nintendo has always been an evil company, uh, fifth
2568820	2574840	dream says, uh, Loki's had a past with Nintendo and feels jilted, uh, dark to try their games.
2574840	2577880	Like I don't, it's just like, let's be honest here.
2577880	2578880	Like, yeah.
2578880	2579880	Okay.
2579880	2582100	We like their games, but their online service is garbage.
2582100	2583100	It is garbage.
2583100	2584100	Yeah.
2584100	2588880	Like, like just now, like, Oh, Hey, we, we're bringing you brand new features to our console
2588880	2591200	that everybody has had for decades now.
2591200	2592600	It's like, come on.
2592600	2593600	Yeah.
2593600	2595500	I mean like, I, I agree.
2595500	2600440	I don't maybe agree as passionately as Loki does, but there's an extent where I go, yes,
2600440	2603400	Nintendo makes some of the greatest games in the industry.
2603400	2608240	Like period Mario Odyssey, uh, Zelda, breath of the wild, uh, you know, the list goes on
2608240	2609560	at a smash brothers.
2609560	2611640	Um, the, the list goes on and on.
2611640	2613440	Nintendo makes the greatest games in the industry.
2613440	2616720	And I think that's why we all sit here going.
2616720	2621920	These games that are a 10 could be an 11 or a 12 if they would just stop dropping the
2621920	2623040	ball on online.
2623040	2629540	But it's this weird thing where it's like, Nintendo does what they want to do with online
2629540	2631420	and it works for them.
2631420	2636740	As much as we get frustrated, seeing the potential, they, they see that potential and they say,
2636740	2637740	we don't want it.
2637740	2638740	And they did.
2638740	2639740	It's their minimum.
2639740	2643840	They did the, they're doing like the absolute bare minimum.
2643840	2644840	That's the price.
2644840	2648420	If the sales, you know what they're doing really well with online is they're harassing
2648420	2651480	their stupid community with all of the fan.
2651480	2654500	Like I want to show you that I love your series.
2654500	2656500	So now I'm going to get a cease and desist for it.
2656500	2657500	You know what?
2657500	2660900	Like treat your fans with some goddamn respect for one.
2660900	2661900	How about that?
2661900	2662900	Nintendo?
2662900	2667200	Like, I don't know, whatever they're going to do, whatever they want, we're just going
2667200	2668200	to buy their games.
2668200	2670860	So let's call it in, call it back.
2670860	2672960	Let's move on to our next topic, Loki.
2672960	2675200	What about all the good things Nintendo has done?
2675200	2677420	And here's one that Nintendo did.
2678280	2681580	And it's not like it was what, like three or four years late to the party or anything
2681580	2682580	like that.
2682580	2685680	However, now, Loki, are you going to, are you going to acknowledge this?
2685680	2688820	Are we going to get a woo-hoo, a thumbs up, a gold star?
2688820	2689820	Nintendo has-
2689820	2693480	So can I voice chat in games now without having to have a separate app on my phone?
2693480	2696520	That separate app is Discord, yes.
2696520	2702360	Nintendo has finally added Bluetooth audio to the Switch.
2702360	2703360	That's right.
2703360	2705920	You can now use, for example, I don't know if you've noticed, those that are watching
2705920	2706920	on Twitch.
2707420	2711420	I'm sorry to the podcast crowd, but those that watch on Twitch probably subtly notice
2711420	2716380	I have these little devices in my ear, and this allows me to hear Dark Sakura and Loki
2716380	2721300	in my ear, because the TV is not really the best audio sometimes during the show that
2721300	2723020	we had when we were in person.
2723020	2728380	So these little earbuds that I have allow me to hear, and it's a Bluetooth connection
2728380	2733920	to my phone, which also sits on Discord with all of us when we're doing the show.
2733920	2738860	My point is, I can finally use these little Bluetooth AirPod headphones on my Nintendo
2738860	2739860	Switch.
2739860	2742300	I'm surprised they didn't charge you for that feature.
2742300	2745100	Like seriously, it's just, it's stupid.
2745100	2749660	That would have been funny if it was a Nintendo online subscription thing, right in time for
2749660	2750660	the renewals to come up.
2750660	2751660	They probably wanted to.
2751660	2755420	All right, but it's not, just to be clear, it is not a pay thing.
2755420	2757680	It is part of the latest Switch update.
2757680	2761220	You can now use Bluetooth devices for audio output.
2761220	2763580	Nintendo does say there may be some latency.
2763580	2767880	So I wouldn't use this to play your music games, but hooray, this feature's finally
2767880	2769180	here.
2769180	2775560	To make it work, make sure that no more than two wireless controllers are currently connected.
2775560	2779220	It's too much for the system to handle if you have more than two.
2779220	2783760	By the way, a pair of Joy-Cons is two.
2783760	2789700	So you may use, Loki, that's one pair of Joy-Con controllers and wireless audio.
2789700	2795660	So if you want to play a game with two players, with four pairs, two pair, four Joy-Con, no
2795660	2798660	Bluetooth audio for you.
2798660	2799660	Number two.
2799660	2804820	No, no, Loki, I'm not finished.
2804820	2808440	Turn on your Bluetooth device and set it to searchable.
2808440	2813520	And then from the home menu, open system settings, scroll down to Bluetooth audio and select
2813520	2814780	pair.
2814780	2817900	Number five, select your Bluetooth audio device when it's found.
2817900	2822800	And six, once connected, any audio that is played will be output through your Bluetooth
2822800	2824100	device.
2824100	2827380	Be sure to adjust the system volume to a comfortable level.
2827380	2834540	So pairing additional controllers will require you to disconnect a Bluetooth audio device.
2834540	2841660	And you can pair one Bluetooth audio device at a time, but up to 10 can be saved on a
2841660	2842660	switch.
2842660	2846660	I don't know who has 10 pair of Bluetooth audio around their house, but there you go.
2846660	2848140	Loki, any thoughts?
2848140	2851220	It's so stupid.
2851220	2852220	It is.
2852220	2856500	It's just so stupid.
2856500	2858500	Let's see.
2858500	2863420	DJ Rama S says there's a reason why Sony and Microsoft don't support Bluetooth audio.
2863420	2864420	What is?
2864420	2868060	I'm actually curious what that reason is.
2868060	2871980	Tiger Claw says if you want to use four controllers but need Bluetooth audio, you can just buy
2871980	2874940	a portable Bluetooth transmitter.
2874940	2880300	You want to get to the headphone jack of the switch and then play your Bluetooth device
2880300	2883540	to pair, I think is the word, pair your Bluetooth device to it.
2883540	2885740	I didn't even think of that as a workaround.
2885740	2890620	I bet that does have lag though, but that does work.
2890620	2893700	Tiger Claw's got an interesting solution there.
2893700	2898500	And I get it, where people want their, honestly, I think the best solution so far has been
2898500	2902340	what Microsoft and Sony have done with their controllers, where they have headphone jacks
2902340	2903340	in the controllers.
2903340	2907180	I mean, because that just works perfectly for me because the controller is wireless.
2907180	2910540	I just pop in, you know, my headphones and that's that.
2910540	2916460	If I have wireless headphones, then, you know, I use different headphones.
2916460	2920100	I don't know, whatever.
2920100	2921100	Good job, Nintendo.
2921100	2924100	At least you supported it, I guess, even though that's really crap.
2924100	2926900	Boy, oh boy.
2926900	2929020	All right.
2929020	2930300	So there you go.
2930820	2935020	Nintendo has finally caught up with the Bluetooth and now you can use AirPods, et cetera, but
2935020	2938420	not all Bluetooth audio as pointed out in our chat.
2938420	2939420	Can you do that?
2939420	2943020	It almost sounds like that they need a more powerful console to be able to do all these
2943020	2948020	features like that they should have, I don't know, put a little bit of oomph under the
2948020	2951900	engine there that that console has been running there because it sounds like it can't handle
2951900	2954780	half of the stuff they're trying to throw at it.
2954780	2960700	Jijirama S says lag and latency is the reason Sony and Microsoft use RF for wireless audio
2960700	2962420	or something along those lines.
2962420	2966020	I swear I have a PlayStation 4 headset.
2966020	2968700	I swore that was a Bluetooth headset.
2968700	2974220	It's Wi-Fi direct, I think, if I remember correctly, basically, if they connect via
2974220	2978700	Wi-Fi to your console as like your console is almost like a hotspot.
2978700	2984580	And so it does it that way, which is fine, you know, I guess I could do that.
2984580	2990220	But I don't know, like there are so many better options.
2990220	2993060	All right, let's move on.
2993060	2999540	We're going to go to our next story, Dark Sakura.
2999540	3004540	It would help if I would actually if it would unmute when I hit the button anyway.
3004540	3007780	It's just lagged like Nintendo's audio.
3007780	3009900	Speaking of audio.
3009900	3019420	So there was actually a report put out by Billboard that Twitch and the National Music
3019420	3026880	Publishers Association, the NMPA, are going to be signing a music agreement that would
3026880	3033420	basically end the DMCA nonsense going on with Twitch.
3033940	3041940	Basically, you know, Twitch was taking down streams, taking down channels for DMCA copyright,
3041940	3050300	which also along the same lines is what led to me making my own music for my channel.
3050300	3055780	You know, a lot of people, when they play music on there, they'll have the VOD excluded,
3055780	3062140	you know, which I can't do the way I have to route my sounds through my Mac.
3062180	3069020	But basically, they're thinking that it could be announced by the end of this month, September.
3069020	3070780	But we're going to wait and see.
3070780	3077140	But basically, they've been trying to get this together for some time and we might finally
3077140	3078140	see fruition.
3078140	3081660	I just hope that it works out better.
3081660	3082660	Yeah.
3082660	3086460	And as far as I know, even if this were to go through, we here at VOG Network aren't
3086460	3091700	really going to change our policy of relying on Dark Sakura custom creations, slash overclocked
3091700	3096980	remix, you know, things where we know we have the blanket license to use them on the network.
3096980	3102540	However, it might make us a little more open to, okay, we can play a video game trailer
3102540	3107140	that has licensed music in it because we won't get sued to oblivion for playing the trailer.
3107140	3110500	So that would be a nice welcome to that.
3110500	3111500	Exactly.
3111540	3116140	And I mean, it would be nice just to play, like, some ambient tunes in the background,
3116140	3126060	you know, like I would like I would like to do the ambient music ASMR fake match because
3126060	3129020	I hate ASMR and my version would just be me.
3129020	3137700	So I just hit this person and they're an asshole because everyone wants to hear me complain
3137700	3139860	in a really smooth voice.
3139860	3141180	I think that'd be hilarious.
3141180	3146460	I am here to ruin your day and you're going to go up on the hook of shame.
3146460	3147460	Death hook.
3147460	3150220	Oh, oh, my gosh.
3150220	3153660	You know, it's actually kind of funny hearing, like, just things that I've randomly come
3153660	3157700	up with being spoken by other people.
3157700	3162780	If people would actually buy my Death Hook for Cutie shirt, I would be happy.
3162780	3170620	But I would think, like, it would be like, so we're here trying to get boobs and no one
3170620	3172660	has yet booped my snoot.
3172660	3176660	Therefore, you all die.
3176660	3177660	Growl.
3177660	3181980	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, O-L-R-N-P-R, no, I don't think I don't think we would change
3181980	3185540	the hosting of our show, but maybe we could do a channel point reward or so.
3185540	3186540	We haven't had one of those in a while.
3186540	3187540	We need to get those back on track.
3187540	3191660	We'll do a channel point reward where we do an NPR style news show or something.
3191660	3193660	It might be fun.
3193660	3194660	OPR.
3194660	3195660	OPR.
3195660	3197220	That's actually really funny.
3197220	3198820	I kind of like that idea.
3198820	3199820	All right.
3200020	3203180	Sia Tabiri in chat says, I'm sorry, next paycheck comes this week.
3203180	3205900	I just spent all my money at Dollywood.
3205900	3208100	So jealous of your life, Sia Tabiri.
3208100	3209100	So, so jealous of your life.
3209100	3210100	I'm so upset.
3210100	3211100	I'm so upset.
3211100	3212580	Thank you for putting money in St. Dolly's pockets.
3212580	3213900	No, I'm just kidding.
3213900	3217020	I'm only saying that out of complete and utter jealousy.
3217020	3219020	Dollywood is on my bucket list of places to go.
3219020	3220020	That's for sure.
3220020	3221020	Anyway.
3221020	3223140	All right, let's move on.
3223140	3224140	We have more stuff.
3224140	3227180	I do hope the Twitch music licensing thing does happen.
3227220	3231500	I think, you know, it'll be it'll just be it'll just be a good thing to like not have
3231500	3235580	all these random DMCA things going around and especially like the false positives are
3235580	3236580	super annoying.
3236580	3240140	And we're always kind of like on edge, like I was kind of referencing, you know, Vogue
3240140	3241140	Network.
3241140	3245900	We don't really play licensed music, but we're really nervous sometimes about playing, you
3245900	3249700	know, news related things because it might even have just a little bit of sound.
3249700	3251980	And then, oh, false positive.
3251980	3252980	We got a strike.
3252980	3254980	This is very silly.
3254980	3257060	All right.
3257060	3258060	Let's move on.
3258060	3259060	Loki.
3259060	3260060	Oh, this.
3260060	3262060	Oh, let's let's visit some old friends with this story.
3262060	3263060	Yes.
3263060	3264060	Yes.
3264060	3265060	No, no.
3265060	3266060	Wait.
3266060	3267060	Okay.
3267060	3268060	I know.
3268060	3269060	Yes.
3269060	3270060	You already said who they are.
3270060	3271060	But yes, these are old friends.
3271060	3274500	But these are old friends were like, you really lost touch over the last 15 years and your
3274500	3277180	lives were in very different directions.
3277180	3283620	And like this friend Konami in this place, like they found they fell into a pit of despair.
3283620	3287860	Like they've been they're not holding down a job for very long.
3287860	3291460	They allegedly may have gotten into some drugs.
3291460	3297020	They have not had any stability in their life whatsoever.
3297020	3298020	They're there.
3298020	3299020	They have a rough life.
3299020	3304560	And so when we're checking in on our friend, it's kind of like one of those the potential
3304560	3312740	the potential this friend of ours could have had a last anyway, what are they up to?
3312740	3317540	Yeah, they're killing off their Pro Evolution soccer franchise are winning 11 as it's still
3317540	3319080	in Japan.
3319080	3326100	And instead, out of its huss, comes the football I wrote now that that's been out there I remember
3326100	3332140	talking about football and thinking, Whoa, I mean, I guess I get that maybe not everybody
3332140	3333680	understands winning 11.
3333680	3336380	But I thought the franchise sold pretty well.
3336380	3340520	I don't understand why they needed Okay, well, now it's football.
3340520	3343320	So E football is a free to play game.
3343320	3349980	And with that available now on the PlayStation and Microsoft storefronts, you can now pre
3349980	3354580	order the E football 2022 premium player pack.
3354580	3358320	That's right, you can pre order loot boxes.
3358320	3363840	So they're gonna have this player pack, which is $40.
3363840	3366140	And it comes with the core game, which is free to play.
3366140	3370260	So that doesn't really come with anything, a bunch of in game currency.
3370260	3376860	And six chance deals, which are the loot boxes, or eight, if you pre order.
3376860	3382380	So yeah, the chance deals allow players to randomly sign one athlete from a group of
3382380	3390260	top tier ambassador and partner player, partner club players, like Lionel Messi and Neymar.
3390260	3396380	So yeah, Konami pushing.
3396380	3397740	I don't even know.
3397740	3403620	But yeah, so apparently, though, me while the entire industry is trying to get away
3403620	3411420	from loot boxes, because they fear the congressional legislation, he's like, run straight for it.
3411420	3415140	It's fine, because it's free to play, right?
3415140	3420500	Bonds free for 29.99 Yeah, yeah, it's free to play, but you're
3420500	3421840	paying $40.
3421840	3424380	So is it really free to play at that point?
3425020	3430140	SSG100 Matt says, Konami is that college friend that you haven't seen in a while and then
3430140	3434900	suddenly see them on the highway exit ramp as a sign guy person for a local cell phone
3434900	3435900	shop.
3435900	3439660	No, no, no, look, I have respect for the dancing sign people, especially in that 105 degree
3439660	3441980	heat here in Sacramento.
3441980	3442980	Here's what it is.
3442980	3447340	Konami is that friend that you stopped at the gas station, and you look over there and
3447340	3451020	you see this guy who's not wearing a shirt and you're like, is that guy peeing in the
3451020	3452020	ice machine?
3452540	3457060	No, no, no, no, no, no, Konami is the person that you were friends with in high school
3457060	3461860	that contacted you out of the blue on Facebook and tries to sign you up for an MLM.
3461860	3462860	That's Konami.
3468860	3473180	Konami is the one that comes out of the blue saying, Have you ever tried Herbalife?
3473180	3475140	It's done wonders for me.
3476140	3481460	No, I would think that Konami is just like that friend that you used to do all this stuff
3481460	3485700	with, you know, like you play D&D with them, you go to the arcade with them and you hang
3485700	3489140	out and then they just start ghosting you and getting new friends.
3492140	3494140	They're casino friends.
3496140	3497140	Am I wrong?
3497140	3499140	Our chat's losing it right now.
3499140	3502140	No, specifically casino friends, you were right on the money there.
3502140	3503140	All right.
3505140	3508140	Best of luck to Konami with E-Football.
3508140	3512140	I guess there's those, it's not on the show world tonight, but there's those rumors about
3512140	3516140	the Castlevania Advance collection that that's that's what it is now.
3516140	3517140	Somebody had made this joke.
3517140	3522140	It already scrolled off the screen for me, but licensing Silent Hill for beer money.
3522140	3527140	That isn't too far from what seems to be happening is that they've licensed out these Castlevania
3527140	3533140	games in order to buy whatever they're buying, because I think it's a great if that's true,
3533140	3534140	it's great news.
3534140	3535140	Those Castlevania events.
3535140	3538140	I mean, how many times have we had Symphony of the Night released?
3538140	3539140	I'm not saying it's a bad thing.
3539140	3541140	That's one of the greatest games ever made, period.
3541140	3547140	But I like the Advance games, too, and the other stuff that kind of came from that, you
3547140	3551140	know, because Symphony of the Night and we haven't seen really rereleases of those in
3551140	3552140	quite some time.
3552140	3560140	So that's that's that's some good things, I guess, even if Konami has had to, you know,
3560140	3563140	sell the rights away for these questionable things.
3564140	3565140	They had to sell their nudes.
3565140	3566140	All right.
3566140	3570140	Anyway, let's move on.
3570140	3573140	Let's get to our next story, which I think is Dark Sakura's or no, is mine.
3573140	3577140	I just did.
3577140	3578140	What did I do?
3578140	3579140	It might be mine, sorry.
3579140	3580140	Maybe it's yours.
3580140	3582140	Maybe I'm the one that needs to.
3582140	3583140	We just did Konami.
3583140	3584140	All right.
3584140	3585140	It's my turn.
3585140	3586140	Sorry.
3586140	3591140	Let's talk about Ubisoft, which if they don't make some changes there with the management,
3591140	3597140	they might be destined for infamy and not some not so great ways as well.
3597140	3602140	So some ex Ubisoft devs have opened a brand new studio.
3602140	3609140	Nesting Games is a new studio that's up in Quebec in Canada, and it is officially co-owned
3609140	3612140	by the Italian publisher Digital Bros.
3612140	3618140	What's interesting, Nesting was created back in August by folks that used to be with Ubisoft,
3618140	3621140	you know, because Ubisoft has a pretty excuse me, I'm about to sneeze.
3621140	3622140	This is terrible.
3622140	3623140	Bless you.
3623140	3625140	And of course, it went away the minute I said that.
3625140	3628140	The minute I called it out, it's like it went away.
3628140	3631140	Typically for me, it happens when someone says bless you beforehand.
3631140	3632140	All right.
3632140	3636140	Anyway, if I just do that out of the blue, apologies in advance, because that's what
3636140	3637140	will happen.
3637140	3639140	Anyway, Nesting was formed back in August.
3639140	3641140	It was former Ubisoft employees.
3641140	3645140	And they've said this is an interesting kind of like quote in this whole like we're partnering
3645140	3646140	with the Italian publisher.
3646140	3651140	We want to go back to creating RPGs that are focused on immersion, great characters, powerful
3651140	3653140	storytelling, and strong gameplay.
3653140	3659140	We are moving away from the massive open world model, full of icons to clean up, and returning
3659140	3663140	to experiences that are content driven and ultimately respect the player's time.
3663140	3668140	Whether you play our games for 30 minutes or a two hour session, what you will get is
3668140	3672140	always interesting content and a gratifying experience, which have led many people to
3672140	3674140	go, is that shade?
3674140	3675140	Is that shade?
3675140	3681140	Because they're kind of saying in there, we're not going to do these messy things that basically
3681140	3683140	they're saying they used to do.
3683140	3686140	Kind of interesting there.
3686140	3690140	Anyway, and then they go on to say, we felt from day one, we're part of the family of
3690140	3692140	digital brothers and blah, blah, blah.
3692140	3694140	Nice words there about that whole partnership.
3694140	3699140	The first AAA project that Nesting Games is working on, a narrative focused single player
3699140	3702140	RPG based on a brand new property.
3702140	3706140	It's going to be Rassassin's Need.
3706140	3707140	No, I'm just kidding.
3707140	3708140	It's something else.
3708140	3714140	Probably going to distance itself from that whole property completely.
3714140	3719140	But yeah, that probably means you won't have to fill out all these parts on the map.
3719140	3721140	That's kind of what they're saying with that.
3721140	3723140	So looking forward to see what they make there.
3723140	3724140	We'll see.
3724140	3727140	Questbuster in chat says it's definitely shade.
3727140	3731140	E3VL says the last Assassin's Creed game had way too much padding.
3731140	3735140	Questbuster says, well, at least they won't have players.
3735140	3736140	Too much junk in the trunk?
3736140	3737140	Yeah.
3737140	3738140	Potentially.
3738140	3739140	For the ass creed?
3739140	3745140	Anyway, that's not the only story we have about these studios that are in need of some
3745140	3746140	makeovers, right?
3746140	3748140	We have a continuing issue.
3748140	3755140	A little reminder about the continuing issues with this company, Darsagra.
3756140	3767140	So earlier in this week, some of the employees at Activision Blizzard with the Communications
3767140	3773140	Workers of America, the CWA, which is a media labor union, filed an unfair labor practices
3773140	3784140	suit with the National Labor Relations Board, the NLRB, that accused the company of worker
3784140	3787140	intimidation and union busting.
3787140	3794140	It's just adding more and more and more to the other shit that's hitting the fan.
3794140	3799140	This is like when the shit goes past the fan and then it hits some smaller fans and spreads
3799140	3802140	out like a fine shitty mist.
3802140	3803140	Just imagine.
3803140	3806140	Don't actually live through it.
3807140	3818140	Anyway, this is, of course, coming after the suit from the DFEH, the Department of Fair
3818140	3824140	Employment and Housing for gender-based discrimination and harassment.
3824140	3827140	There's been walkouts.
3827140	3835140	They have banded with other employees from other companies, and we've seen these other
3835140	3842140	companies that have the same allegations rising try to do something about it.
3842140	3854140	So they're really moving into very union-like territory using collective action for improvement
3854140	3856140	of their working conditions.
3856140	3864140	Now, the thing is that there's not really unions.
3864140	3868140	We've talked about this before in the video game industry, and there really should be,
3868140	3875140	but they're basically doing union behavior without actually unionizing.
3875140	3876140	Make sense?
3876140	3879140	Oh, yeah.
3879140	3886140	But basically, the big thing that's standing in the way in part is American law favoring
3886140	3887140	employers.
3887140	3891140	Now, in California, it's a little bit different.
3891140	3895140	You know, my mom likes to say, oh, you live in a bubble there in California, and it's
3895140	3896140	true.
3896140	3897140	We kind of do.
3897140	3904140	We do have some pretty strong labor laws in California in particular.
3904140	3909140	Like, this suit, I don't know that something like this would have flown somewhere else,
3910140	3922140	But right now, while people are in favor of having unions, it's difficult because employers
3922140	3930140	right now have different ways to intimidate their workers and to provide barriers for
3930140	3937140	unionization, you know, especially with this really dangerous rhetoric.
3937140	3941140	Like, oh, it's going to hurt the employees, or oh, it's going to hurt our profits, and
3941140	3945140	then we can't pay our employees.
3945140	3955140	So if people don't understand this, there are some ways to create a union or for a private
3955140	3962140	sector union to be recognized.
3962140	3968140	So basically, either 30% of the workers can petition to hold a union election, and then
3968140	3976140	the NLRB steps in for that, or an employer can voluntarily recognize a union.
3976140	3986140	The first one is usually the big one, but sometimes it can be really manipulated, right?
3986140	3994140	And then companies hire other companies that exist to do nothing but union busting.
3994140	3996140	Which is allegedly what ABK kind of did.
3996140	4000140	They had that company that came in that was kind of involved with some of that stuff.
4000140	4003140	So it's just like, yeah, anyway, sorry.
4003140	4005140	I'm going to be getting to it.
4005140	4007140	Okay.
4007140	4014140	But at any rate, well, and just to go on then, that actually happened in Alabama.
4014140	4021140	They were trying to unionize in Alabama for Amazon, and Amazon pulled in one of those
4021140	4022140	companies.
4022140	4029140	Basically, the way that they do this is they do propaganda, surveillance, mandatory anti-union
4029140	4035140	meetings, delay tactics, intimidation, retaliation.
4035140	4044140	But it was basically Amazon pulling this on them, where they put a mailbox.
4044140	4049140	Well, number one, they were distributing anti-union materials, and they put a mailbox outside
4049140	4051140	their warehouse.
4051140	4057140	So the workers were thinking that Amazon was helping to tally the votes, and so it was
4057140	4059140	stealing their votes.
4059140	4067140	And the NLRB basically said Amazon was interfering and had a rerun of the election.
4067140	4071140	And a lot of this, though, just an example, like that is the same stuff that's happening
4071140	4077140	here with our video game companies, and we've seen it.
4077140	4086140	And now, even though the Activision Blizzard people haven't really pushed for unionization,
4086140	4092140	they did bring in Wilmer Hale to do a third party investigation about those workplace
4092140	4096140	issues from the lawsuit.
4096140	4098140	Activision Blizzard did.
4098140	4108140	But Winter Hale is, and I'm going to quote here, a known union busting law firm.
4108140	4111140	So they're just doing their same tactics.
4111140	4113140	They're not doing anything better.
4113140	4118140	And by third party, it means third party that's going to go in their interest.
4118140	4122140	Activision Blizzard had a statement that says, we care deeply about our employees' rights
4122140	4127140	and have made great efforts to respect the rights of all employees under the NLRB, which
4127140	4132140	is bullshit.
4132140	4136140	But even with all of this going on, even with them pulling in their union busting, all of
4136140	4144140	that, there is a collection of employees called A Better ABK.
4144140	4152140	They're saying that unionization is not their goal, but they are using very union-like tactics
4152140	4155140	to improve the way things work in a company.
4155140	4160140	Basically, if the company is going to bully them, they're going to bully right back.
4160140	4162140	And there's power in numbers.
4162140	4163140	Yeah.
4163140	4166140	And the employee letter is still not been responded to.
4166140	4173140	Well, and another employee, and this is an anonymous employee, said that they felt, I'm
4173140	4178140	going to quote a little bit here, that in this moment, collective action and solidarity
4178140	4183140	with each other without a union is the best solution and a place where a lot of people
4183140	4188140	are scared of the concept of unionization because of the slow of anti-union propaganda
4188140	4191140	that has pervaded our country.
4191140	4201140	We still have other employees at other companies like EA Dice, Paradox, Nexon, Ubisoft.
4201140	4209140	They use some of the trade unions in their relative countries like in Sweden and France
4209140	4218140	to help their employees out, but other ones have used the very similar non-union yet union
4218140	4227140	tactics to bring about the real change in the company and protect the employees.
4227140	4232140	So, I think it's a very interesting approach.
4232140	4234140	You know what I mean?
4234140	4241140	That they are putting together their own, I'm going to call it a task force.
4241140	4244140	Does that sound like a good term, a task force, not a union?
4244140	4248140	It sounds kind of like that even if they're not labeling it that.
4248140	4251140	Sure, I'm with you there.
4251140	4257140	But it is collective action for positive change.
4257140	4262140	Think of it like, okay, I hate to say it because I think that the whole last election here
4262140	4264140	was a joke.
4264140	4266140	The recall or the presidential?
4266140	4267140	The recall.
4267140	4268140	Okay.
4268140	4269140	The recall.
4269140	4275140	If you think of it kind of like how our recall elections go, enough people were pissed off
4275140	4281140	about shit that they got together and got enough signatures on it that they put it to
4281140	4282140	a vote, right?
4282140	4283140	Right.
4283140	4292140	In their eyes, recalling Newsom was a good idea and they wanted to get together and make
4292140	4296140	this happen and so the vote happened.
4296140	4299140	But it's kind of along the same lines.
4299140	4305140	You get people together with a common goal and a common vision and they can move mountains.
4305140	4310140	They don't necessarily have to be called a union to be a union of people.
4310140	4313140	All right.
4313140	4318140	We could do this in this country on a very big scale if people would get off their asses
4318140	4320140	and actually do shit.
4320140	4325140	If we elect people that actually represent those values, yes.
4325140	4326140	All right.
4326140	4328140	Before we get to our next story, Loki, I hope you won't mind.
4328140	4331140	I'm going to do a little interrupt here because I want to get an update.
4331140	4333140	I want to bring an old friend of OLR.
4333140	4335140	Sorry to warn you guys, but you'll know what's happening.
4335140	4338140	I want to bring an old friend of OLR onto the show here.
4338140	4344140	So we're going to bring in our pal Shane into the room and talk a little bit about today's
4344140	4349140	Pokemon Community Day because I know I have a very big question here in this whole experience
4349140	4358140	and that is, I want to know how much shiny Pokemons Shane was able to get today.
4358140	4359140	So I think Shane is there.
4359140	4360140	Hi.
4360140	4361140	Are you with us, Shane?
4361140	4362140	Yeah, kind of.
4362140	4363140	Hi.
4363140	4365140	I'm super tired.
4365140	4366140	You don't say.
4366140	4370140	So today in Pokemon Go was a little bit of a holy holiday, right?
4370140	4371140	Can you give us a little background?
4371140	4373140	It really was.
4373140	4376140	So today was Oshawa Community Day.
4376140	4382140	And if you have ever heard me talk like any sentence out of my mouth, you know that Oshawa
4382140	4385140	is the Pokemon I would literally die for.
4385140	4388140	So it was very important.
4388140	4389140	But let me ask you this.
4389140	4393140	I mean, aren't you, weren't you, aren't you kind of over Pokemon Go?
4393140	4397140	Like why, if you don't really care about Pokemon Go, why do you, why do you care?
4397140	4398140	Because I care about Oshawa.
4398140	4401140	Oshawa trumps my hatred for this game.
4401140	4406140	Like, they could put Oshawa in Fortnite and I'd probably start playing Fortnite.
4406140	4408140	No, I would because Oshawa would be there.
4408140	4411140	Not even I probably would.
4411140	4413140	I see.
4413140	4419140	So quickly, how did you plan to collect as many shiny and why shinies?
4419140	4421140	Why does it have to be shiny Oshawats?
4421140	4423140	Why not just a bunch of regular Oshawats?
4423140	4425140	Well, I did both.
4425140	4429140	But because shinies is like my thing in Pokemon.
4429140	4433140	After I complete the decks in a game, it's like all I do is shiny hunt.
4433140	4440140	I just it's it's like I don't know if people get a thrill out of like actually hunting
4440140	4442140	animals for whatever reason.
4442140	4444140	That's the same thing I get.
4444140	4448140	But without killing animals with weapons with tiny hunting.
4448140	4451140	It's just like it's going to take a while sometimes.
4451140	4453140	It's rare usually.
4453140	4455140	And it's just fun.
4455140	4456140	I just like it.
4456140	4459140	So overall, quickly, I don't spend too much time.
4459140	4462140	But how what was like your plan of attack today?
4462140	4467140	How did you plan to maximize the shiny Oshawa hunting across six hours?
4467140	4473140	So I, I my plan to start was to get there about 30 minutes early so I can make sure
4473140	4479140	people didn't put up stupid lures on the stops, like because I wanted rainies on them
4479140	4483140	instead of like, I don't know, something like a grass or mossy lure or whatever.
4483140	4491140	And I had planned on basically just non stop checking and just catch the shiny's basically.
4491140	4495140	But that did change because my husband came with me.
4495140	4497140	And so I did kind of tone it down.
4497140	4500140	We got there only like 20 minutes early.
4500140	4507140	And for probably about three and a half, four of the hours, the first four, three and a
4507140	4508140	half.
4508140	4513140	We kind of just leisurely walked around the area and caught basically everything.
4513140	4516140	I ran out of balls like four times today.
4516140	4520140	Oh, did you actually spend money for more or what did you do?
4520140	4521140	Yes.
4521140	4523140	Well, yes and no.
4523140	4527140	I actually kind of thought that might be a problem.
4527140	4532140	So I got like an Apple gift card a while back and I loaded it on my account and then I
4532140	4535140	just used it because I wasn't going to spend it on anything else.
4535140	4538140	So it wasn't like extra money.
4538140	4539140	It was planned money.
4541140	4547140	OK, so when all is said and done, Shane, how many shiny Ashwa did you walk away with today?
4547140	4549140	Eighty seven.
4551140	4552140	Good Lord.
4552140	4555140	Are you what are you going to do with eighty seven shiny Pokemon?
4555140	4558140	Keep them in the game.
4558140	4560140	I don't know. They're just going to sit there and be adorable.
4560140	4562140	Like, do they have to have a reason?
4562140	4564140	It's not like they're taking up any space.
4565140	4568140	Yeah, I mean, they're taking up Pokemon space, but that's fine.
4568140	4569140	That's fine.
4569140	4570140	It's not like real life space.
4570140	4572140	You don't have to put it somewhere.
4572140	4573140	No, no.
4573140	4574140	It's all on my phone.
4574140	4576140	Have you named all eighty seven?
4576140	4579140	No, I haven't named any of them.
4579140	4583140	I didn't make out too great today in terms of like four stars.
4583140	4587140	I got zero four stars and only a few three stars.
4587140	4591140	So I just I evolved some and yeah, they're just going to sit there.
4591140	4596140	I probably got rid of or I say blended because it's just funnier
4596140	4598140	when you think that you threw them in a blender.
4598140	4604140	But I blended probably around four hundred regular
4604140	4608140	Oshawa today during my late six hours.
4608140	4612140	So it was a lot.
4612140	4618140	Mike Defton Chat, who is a very Pokemon tuned person, says it's like crazy.
4618140	4619140	Shane got that many.
4619140	4623140	I don't even think the top players get that many shinies in a community day.
4623140	4626140	And yet you have to I knowing you as long as I have.
4626140	4629140	You have to be upset you didn't get one hundred.
4629140	4634140	OK, so I said I kept setting goals for myself throughout the day.
4634140	4644140	My first goal was to at least get as many shinies as Gible Day,
4644140	4646140	because that was my best one so far.
4646140	4649140	I got like I don't remember, I think like sixty one.
4649140	4653140	And so I was like, OK, I have to meet that goal.
4653140	4658140	And then when I met that goal, I was like, OK, I would like to at least get 70.
4658140	4662140	It was really early. I got I beat the first goal probably half.
4662140	4666140	No, about four hours in.
4666140	4671140	And then once I got 70, I was like, oh, come on, let's just do a hundred.
4671140	4674140	But it didn't happen. So it's OK.
4675140	4679140	Are you so usually and there's no guarantee it'll happen again this year,
4679140	4681140	but I don't see why it wouldn't happen in December.
4681140	4685140	They usually do an encore event where they bring. Yes, I'll get more.
4685140	4690140	So is your goal to top one hundred once we get to December?
4690140	4695140	Yeah, literally when that community a community day happens,
4695140	4701140	I can't think of another Pokemon that's come out this year for community day that I'm even going to care about.
4701140	4705140	So I'll only check Auschwitz. Everything else is just trash.
4705140	4712140	So and for the record and for comparison's sake, I also did community day today and I did all Bluetooth catching.
4712140	4715140	I actually was playing Ingress because there's an event going on in that game, too.
4715140	4719140	And I said, you know, usually I do all right with Bluetooth catching. I'm not Shane.
4719140	4724140	I'm happy if I get three shiny Auschwitz so I can have one of each evolution.
4724140	4730140	It's a cute Pokemon. I just don't have the same personal thing that Shane's got with Auschwitz.
4730140	4734140	So I was like, I'm happy if I get three. I had nine in 30 minutes.
4734140	4738140	And I was like, honestly, I could quit right now and I'm satisfied.
4738140	4742140	But oh, yeah, I started the day with six hundred balls.
4742140	4746140	And so I was like, whatever, I'm still working on Ingress stuff, so I'll just keep going.
4746140	4750140	So I probably played for about three hours. So I did Ingress stuff. I ended with twenty one.
4750140	4758140	I had twenty one shiny Pokemon, shiny Auschwitz today, which for me, that's oddly I got a one hundred Caterpie today.
4758140	4764140	It didn't even hatch. It was a wild Caterpie. A hundred. I don't know how the fuck that happened, but whatever.
4764140	4771140	No, no hundo Auschwitz so sadly. But yeah, I got twenty one shinies without really trying.
4771140	4776140	And I'm told Alan, who hasn't really played Pokemon go in quite some time,
4776140	4783140	actually took out his phone today and just kind of poked at it between Dead by Daylight matches and said he got two shinies today.
4783140	4787140	He was he said he got about one for every fifty.
4787140	4794140	That he was looking at. It's not bad. Yeah, I I should have just kind of given up.
4794140	4800140	It was all because I wanted a four star because I have a four star shiny Serperior.
4800140	4807140	I was like, oh, if I could get an oshawott and get, you know, all the way to samurai, it's a shiny hundred percent.
4807140	4812140	I'd be so happy. So if I had given up on that chase a little earlier,
4812140	4818140	I could have got one hundred shinies. No problem. Your your best chance for the hundo is to do lucky trades.
4818140	4826140	Like next time I see you and we're lucky friends, like we just just trade zero star oshawott on a lucky trade and you might get one hundred.
4826140	4830140	The last time I did a lucky trade, I got one hundred percent out of it. Dustin and I,
4830140	4835140	we always do one shiny trade since that's all you can do. And, you know, it wasn't great.
4835140	4840140	And then we're like, let's do a regular trade. So the second trade we did was a lucky trade.
4840140	4845140	It wasn't one hundred, but it was still lucky. And I got so mad.
4845140	4849140	And as Joe says, I was impressed with my thirty today. That's nothing compared to Shane.
4849140	4859140	No, thirty is impressive, y'all. Shane is sick. Like, like, don't compare yourself to Shane in this because you're never going to be happy.
4859140	4864140	Like Shane is sick. So let's see. Let's see what my total shiny count is.
4864140	4870140	I've got my phone right now. So on my phone, I have twelve hundred eighty seven shinies from Pokemon Go.
4870140	4878140	And that's not including ones I've transferred into the main games. So I think I have maybe four hundred shinies.
4878140	4883140	I don't know. I'm bringing I'm bringing up Pokemon Go right now to check how many shinies I have.
4883140	4888140	Let me ask you this question. I don't want to derail the whole show with Pokemon Go chat, but people want to actually know.
4888140	4894140	So Mike Deft is asking, did you use any fast catching technique in particular?
4894140	4898140	What what is your technique to catch eighty seven shinies?
4898140	4903140	OK. Oh, so I I refuse to fast catch shinies.
4903140	4908140	I will not do it. I fast catch the regulars.
4908140	4914140	Like if I tap it and well until I ran out of balls, I was like, oh, just best catch everything.
4914140	4920140	So, you know, hold the pokeball down, slide over to the left and then throw and run away.
4920140	4924140	And that's great. It's it's super good for catching regulars, but I don't trust it for shinies.
4924140	4931140	Like I have to sit there and make sure it's actually in the ball or I'll get very upset.
4931140	4938140	I have four hundred and forty six shinies and I thought I was cool. And Mike Deft says one thousand one hundred and seventeen.
4938140	4943140	Oh, yeah. Wow. It's right behind me. Wow. Wow. Wow.
4943140	4948140	All right. Shane, I know you have some homework and some other things to get to tonight, but do you have any other?
4948140	4952140	Yeah, I decided to not do it. So whatever. Well, then I'll see you on Final Fantasy later.
4952140	4958140	Do you have any do you have any other you and I need to I know Jamie does stuff Sunday nights after the show,
4958140	4964140	but during the week, you and I need to do some more Final Fantasy 14 streaming and talking about that seven hour stream,
4964140	4969140	which we'll get to later in the show. I haven't got to it yet, but for all of it, I did it.
4969140	4975140	I know. Well, quickly, I haven't got it. What was your favorite part of that seven hour stream for Final Fantasy 14?
4975140	4984140	Oh, a couple quick favorite parts. One, the title screen reveal, because that was just beautiful to everything about Reaper.
4984140	4988140	Three, everything about Sage for the Sumner rework.
4988140	4992140	OK, sounds good. Shane, I'm going to let you go.
4992140	4998140	Thank you for sharing your experience with Pokemon Go community today, because you're crazy when it comes to catching shinies,
4998140	5002140	especially Oshawa. I'm glad you caught at least 87. That's pretty good.
5002140	5006140	Like everybody sitting here going, nobody catches that many. So I know you're sad you didn't hit 100.
5006140	5011140	But like you, you probably caught more than anyone else on the planet or close.
5011140	5017140	Really close, I'm sure. Any other thoughts before we let you go? No.
5017140	5021140	OK, then I'll talk to you later. All right. Bye. All right. Bye. All right.
5021140	5025140	Thank you, Shane, for joining us here on the show. I appreciate that.
5025140	5032140	And that was kind of that was kind of last minute notice, because I knew there were going to be some listeners that would want to know.
5032140	5038140	What did his crazy ass do with Pokemon Day, especially today? Right.
5038140	5048140	I know. I know. 80s. That is 87. That's how I kept waiting to say in a row, but that was supposed to be 37 over six hours.
5048140	5052140	That's like 12 an hour. That's one every five minutes.
5052140	5058140	And Alan said, like, one in 50 would be shiny. Impressive.
5058140	5066140	All right, Loki, I'm sorry to make you wait, but you get it. What's what's next on the news for you?
5066140	5072140	You're muted, by the way, Loki. I understand you had to contain all your excitement.
5072140	5081140	I did. I did. You know, so there is the 10th anniversary of THQ Nordic.
5081140	5090140	And they basically celebrated their 10th anniversary by having a little livestream where they announced some things.
5090140	5099140	So first thing we've got is Destroy All Humans 2 Reprobed, which is the remake of Destroy All Humans or I guess remaster.
5099140	5104140	And I know it is remake and it is being made in Unreal four.
5104140	5109140	So that's going to be coming out on all modern consoles and PC.
5110140	5116140	SpongeBob SquarePants, the Cosmic Shake. It's a new 3D platformer game with SpongeBob.
5116140	5124140	Jagged Alliance 3. We have Outcast 2 A New Beginning and Superpower 3.
5124140	5131140	And then MX versus ATV Legends were the games that were announced also to tie in with their 10th anniversary.
5131140	5134140	There is a sale right now on Steam and also a couple of free games.
5134140	5139140	You get Titan Quest Anniversary Edition and Jagged Alliance 1 Gold Edition for free.
5139140	5146140	So neat. I don't know. I didn't play the new Destroy All Humans, but it looked pretty cool.
5146140	5150140	I like the second game, too, so maybe I'll check it out.
5152140	5156140	Was there anything in particular you were looking forward to during that stream?
5156140	5161140	No, I didn't even know the stream even happened. I didn't watch it live.
5161140	5165140	I think I heard about it like an hour before, but it wasn't available.
5165140	5172140	Yeah, there's not a lot from THQ that I'm excited about nowadays.
5172140	5177140	I don't remember. They used to do the Saints Row stuff.
5177140	5181140	So back in the day, I would be excited about that kind of thing.
5181140	5185140	But now that's a whole separate company that handles that.
5186140	5187140	Oh well.
5187140	5192140	Alright, one more story before we get to our regular segment here.
5192140	5197140	You know I love my AR gaming, GPS gaming, and all that stuff.
5197140	5201140	Like I just mentioned, today I was playing Ingress and Pokémon GO.
5201140	5205140	I was dual wielding, playing one on my phone while I'm bluetoothing with the other,
5205140	5207140	using my real world location to play both.
5207140	5212140	And because I like GPS gaming, I've tried them all.
5212140	5215140	I've literally tried them all, if it's on iPhone anyway.
5215140	5218140	There's been a couple Android only ones I haven't played, but for the most part I've tried them all.
5218140	5223140	And I was looking forward to trying this one, but this game got cancelled before it even came out.
5223140	5226140	And that kind of surprised me. It was a Niantic game.
5226140	5229140	Of course Niantic, being the makers of Pokémon GO,
5229140	5232140	they're kind of at the forefront of a lot of these AR and GPS games.
5232140	5235140	And that game is Catan World Explorers.
5235140	5239140	The game never came out. It came out in certain countries for testing,
5239140	5241140	but it didn't come out in the US, so as far as I'm concerned.
5241140	5242140	Like the Settlers of Catan?
5242140	5247140	Yeah, Settlers of Catan, the board game. They were turning into a real world AR game.
5247140	5251140	And they have decided they will shut the game down on November 18th.
5251140	5255140	So if you were in one of the countries, I think it was in Australia, New Zealand,
5255140	5260140	like Denmark maybe, and one country in Asia I think had it too.
5260140	5264140	So it was in a few countries, but I never got to play it.
5264140	5268140	And it's all about me. Or at least that's how I feel in the moment.
5268140	5271140	So I never will get to play it. They are pulling the game.
5271140	5274140	It's hard to tell what the hell happened.
5274140	5278140	They left a really weird note and in the note it said,
5278140	5283140	we had a vision for trading, harvesting, and building up the world in seasonal play
5283140	5287140	and resetting the board each month just like you do for each game you play at home.
5287140	5292140	But trying to adapt such a well-designed board game to a global,
5292140	5297140	location-based, massively multiplayer online game was a tough challenge.
5298140	5302140	Now, I don't know nothing about what's happening behind the scenes,
5302140	5305140	but I got a good guess based on this statement.
5305140	5308140	I think Catan pulled the license.
5308140	5312140	I don't think they were happy with the product that Niantic came up with for whatever reason.
5312140	5319140	And whether I agree with it or not, it's their artistic license to be able to do so.
5320140	5327140	But when you say we had a vision, but trying to adapt this didn't work,
5327140	5332140	it really is screaming to me that the Catan holders didn't like what you came up with,
5332140	5335140	but you were sticking to your guns with the game you made.
5335140	5338140	And what further kind of goes with that?
5338140	5342140	They talk about how the lessons that they learned while working on World Explorers
5342140	5345140	will go to future projects.
5345140	5351140	It's almost screaming to me that Niantic is going to reskin Catan and make it a different game.
5351140	5355140	Pikmin? Wow, that sounds just like an Nintendo thing.
5355140	5357140	No, not Pikmin. I'm going to stop you there.
5357140	5360140	Because Pikmin, they've said, is going to be out by the end of the year.
5360140	5363140	So Pikmin is happening and it's a different thing.
5363140	5365140	And I don't know much about it.
5365140	5369140	I hear it's AR gaming lite.
5369140	5372140	It's not going to be a very involved game.
5372140	5374140	I think it'll probably be even more aimed at kids than Pokémon is.
5374140	5376140	But that is all speculation.
5376140	5379140	I don't know until I play the game myself and give you my own impressions.
5379140	5384140	But still, to hear that Niantic, the minds behind Pokémon GO,
5384140	5388140	had to shut down a game before it even came out is shocking.
5390140	5392140	So it's just crazy.
5392140	5396140	Dark Tetsuya agrees with my logic, saying yes, that sounds like what probably happened.
5396140	5399140	Tigerclaw says, maybe it was something that sounded good on paper,
5399140	5401140	but trying to make it didn't pan out.
5401140	5404140	Yeah, apparently when they met at the table the first time, they had an idea.
5404140	5408140	Or the Catan people were like, you made Pokémon GO?
5408140	5410140	Fuck yeah, we want to work with you.
5410140	5415140	And then when Niantic said, here's the game we made, the Catan people went, yikes!
5415140	5418140	This isn't Pokémon GO, this is Withers Unite.
5418140	5420140	Yeah, this isn't Pokémon GO.
5420140	5422140	Was it the Harry Potter game?
5422140	5424140	Yeah, because the Harry Potter game is fucking Pokémon GO.
5424140	5430140	Well, the Harry Potter game, and that has its own issues with it.
5430140	5432140	Because I hate her, the one behind it.
5432140	5434140	But obviously she has nothing to do with the game.
5434140	5436140	But the game has good combat to it.
5436140	5440140	Exactly, the game has that combat that's actually pretty rad.
5440140	5445140	Like I actually way prefer fighting in Harry Potter.
5445140	5448140	Keep in mind, I haven't played it in like a year and a half.
5448140	5455140	But the fighting in that game is way better than any raid in Pokémon GO or PvP.
5456140	5458140	And it's not that much more complicated.
5458140	5462140	But it feels like there's more to it, you know?
5462140	5464140	Anyway.
5464140	5468140	D'Artitsia says Catan is all resource gathering and that sort of thing, right?
5468140	5471140	And AR game based on that does sound kind of neat.
5471140	5474140	Hey, if I have any friends at Niantic that are listening, I doubt it.
5474140	5476140	But I'm always going to take the shot.
5476140	5481140	You guys should give Sid Meier a call and say hey.
5481140	5483140	I knew you were going to say that.
5483140	5487140	Did you? Yeah, you should give Sid Meier a call and say hey.
5487140	5490140	We really like civilization.
5494140	5495140	Why not?
5495140	5497140	Do Civ Nation.
5497140	5499140	Yeah, Civ Planet or something.
5499140	5501140	Civ World.
5501140	5503140	Civilization Explorer.
5503140	5504140	Civilized World.
5504140	5505140	Fuck it.
5505140	5507140	If Catan doesn't want it, fuck it.
5507140	5510140	Do Civilization Explorer. I'm all for it.
5511140	5514140	Of course, that kind of sounds like something different than a game.
5514140	5515140	But anyway.
5515140	5517140	Alright.
5517140	5518140	Let's go.
5518140	5520140	D'Artitsia in chat says, right?
5520140	5522140	That was going to be my next sentence.
5522140	5524140	Can they do something with civilization?
5524140	5526140	You know what? I'm going to tweet them right now.
5526140	5530140	Will you all please retweet and like my status?
5530140	5533140	I like SSJ100 and Matt's comment there.
5533140	5537140	Maybe Niantic was trying to work on it from 40 meters away.
5537140	5540140	And it didn't work because they were 80 meters away.
5543140	5545140	I missed that comment but it's gold.
5545140	5546140	Alright.
5546140	5553140	Let's go to our next segment and talk about times when we didn't even have phones that could play games.
5553140	5555140	Our phones could play Snake.
5555140	5559140	No, actually when this game came from, the phone was maybe in the car.
5559140	5561140	It was in the limo because you had to be that rich.
5561140	5563140	Let's get to our next segment.
5567140	5583140	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5583140	5587140	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5587140	5591140	And what did you pick for the classic game this week, DarkSakura?
5591140	5593140	I picked a lust.
5593140	5598140	And I'm sorry, by the way, if I sound a little funny, I had to put my mouth brace in because my mouth hurts.
5598140	5599140	So I'm fine.
5599140	5600140	Sorry.
5600140	5601140	Okay.
5601140	5603140	So, Lust came out in 1988.
5603140	5605140	It's a shooter game done by Compile.
5605140	5612140	And it originally came out on the Sega Master System and then later on on the MSX2 by CP Communications.
5612140	5618140	Outside of the US, the Master System version was released as a game called Power Strike.
5618140	5625140	And then, of course, we had all kinds of sequels and derivatives from both versions of it.
5625140	5636140	So basically the story of a lust in general is there's a man-made supercomputer called the DIA-51 that had been infected by a virus that was spreading.
5636140	5642140	And eventually the machine that's infected with it wants to eliminate people.
5642140	5655140	And so when the computer attack hurts this dude's girlfriend, Yuri, then Rei, the guy, gets in a plane and goes shooting.
5655140	5657140	Because that's what you do.
5657140	5662140	Anyway, like I said, it came out for the Master System.
5662140	5664140	That's February 1988.
5664140	5670140	And it came out as Power Strike, which in the US it was male only limited edition.
5670140	5677140	But it did get some retail love over from Toys R Us and a couple other chains in North America.
5677140	5679140	And in Europe it was regular retail.
5682140	5687140	The game actually has had many other releases.
5688140	5701140	The MSX2 version itself had extra stages, two new stages, lower difficulty, and a bunch of cutscenes, which is pretty cool.
5701140	5707140	It has been ported by Squenix to phones.
5707140	5716140	And then it was re-released, the MSX2 version was re-released on the Wii's virtual console in Japan.
5716140	5728140	And then also with Aleste 2, it was released through the WOM service, W-O-O-M-B, for an MSX revival.
5728140	5733140	In the US, like I said, the Sega Master System version was called Power Strike.
5733140	5736140	And it was received very well.
5736140	5738140	It got some really good reviews.
5738140	5747140	So now for all of the sequels, of which there have been many, and even a cancelled one.
5747140	5754140	And I've even spoken about one of the games here in this segment.
5754140	5756140	I figure it's time to go back to the original.
5756140	5761140	So followed by this we had Aleste Gaiden, which was on MSX2.
5761140	5764140	We had Aleste 2, which is also MSX2.
5764140	5770140	We had Musha Aleste, which came out on the Mega Drive.
5770140	5772140	And I think I have done Musha.
5772140	5775140	We had GG Aleste, which was Game Gear Aleste.
5775140	5778140	We had Super Aleste for the SNES.
5778140	5783140	It came out in the US as Space Megaforce.
5783140	5785140	Sound familiar?
5785140	5791140	On Sega CD, we had Denine Aleste, which was Robo Aleste over here.
5791140	5795140	Also Game Gear, we had GG Aleste 2.
5795140	5799140	Also for Game Gear Micro, GG Aleste 3.
5799140	5801140	That was in 2020.
5801140	5808140	There is a to be announced release for Aleste Branch.
5808140	5812140	And an arcade version called Senjin Aleste.
5812140	5815140	Actually out this year.
5815140	5822140	For cancelled one, there was Denine Aleste 2, which would have been Robo Aleste 2 for Mega CD or Sega CD.
5822140	5824140	And then there's the related games.
5824140	5834140	So these games, some of the different Aleste versions are based on them and some in reverse.
5834140	5841140	Some of them are other compile-ish shooters that have a lot to do with the Aleste series.
5842140	5848140	Including one of the best games in the universe to ever, ever come out.
5848140	5850140	So we have Zanac.
5850140	5854140	It came out. MSX Famicom Disk NES.
5854140	5856140	We have the Guardian Legend.
5856140	5858140	As in Guardic.
5858140	5860140	Guardic Gaiden, sorry.
5860140	5864140	Guardic was kind of a different game to Guardic Gaiden.
5864140	5869140	And the shooting in there is very reminiscent of Aleste.
5870140	5873140	You have Gunhead for PC Engine.
5873140	5875140	Gunac for NES.
5875140	5881140	Seirei Senshi Spriggan, which was for PC Engine, also anime.
5881140	5885140	Spriggan Mark 2, Re-Terraform Project, also on PC Engine CD.
5885140	5889140	Power Strike 2 for the Sega Master System.
5889140	5892140	Silphia, which is a fun little game, let me tell you.
5892140	5894140	I love Silphia.
5894140	5896140	It's on PC Engine CD.
5896140	5899140	Spriggan Powers for Super Famicom.
5899140	5905140	And then some of the compile employees left and joined Rising.
5905140	5907140	Which I brought this company up before.
5907140	5911140	When we talked about Mahou Daisakusen.
5911140	5915140	They did Mahou Daisakusen in Shippu Mahou Daisakusen.
5916140	5930140	Aleste in and of itself has all kinds of little tendrils mixed in other games of similar genre.
5930140	5933140	Very much seen in other compile games.
5933140	5936140	Very much seen just in general.
5936140	5939140	We still have it today.
5940140	5944140	Like I said, there's a Senjin Aleste coming out in Arcade.
5944140	5947140	Or may already be, I don't know, I have to check.
5947140	5949140	This year.
5952140	5954140	I'm actually looking.
5956140	5958140	It came out in July.
5958140	5959140	Oh, there you go.
5959140	5966140	I was going to say, you referenced before the connection to the Guardian Legend and all that stuff.
5966140	5968140	I really see it in this game.
5968140	5970140	I'm not familiar with this game honestly.
5970140	5973140	I wasn't before you brought it up today.
5973140	5977140	But I really see the connection to the Guardian Legend at the end of the stage.
5977140	5980140	When they beat the stage, the way the ship flies away.
5980140	5982140	It plays the little tune.
5982140	5983140	The ship flies away.
5983140	5986140	It's very reminiscent of what happens in the Guardian Legend.
5986140	5987140	It's very interesting.
5987140	5990140	It's that little thing that just takes me back.
5990140	5992140	But it had some of the same developers.
5992140	5994140	Both were compile games.
5994140	5995140	Oh yeah.
5995140	5996140	I noticed that right off the bat.
5996140	5998140	I was like, oh, I just picked compile game.
5998140	5999140	I know why.
5999140	6008140	Well, but the other thing too is that I believe that some of, there's like some Aleste.
6010140	6011140	What am I trying to think?
6011140	6018140	There are some Aleste Easter eggs that I think show up in the Guardian Legend.
6018140	6024140	Like, I want to say that the Landers might have been a part of it.
6024140	6026140	But I'd have to go look that up again.
6026140	6036140	But yeah, Aleste and Garden Gaiden were only like not even a year apart in release.
6036140	6039140	So they had to have had some co-development.
6040140	6050140	But at any rate, get yourself an MSX2 or a Master System and look for Aleste or Power Strike.
6050140	6055140	And quite frankly, how dare you not have a Master System in an MSX2 already?
6055140	6058140	I don't have either one.
6058140	6061140	I do have several Master Systems.
6061140	6062140	Good memories though.
6062140	6063140	Good memories.
6063140	6064140	All right.
6064140	6065140	You know what?
6065140	6066140	You know what I have to say though?
6066140	6074140	If any of you have a Genesis, like I think the second edition of the Genesis, look for the FM Power Base Converter.
6074140	6079140	Because then you can get the FM sound to play for most games.
6079140	6081140	There's a few it doesn't work on.
6081140	6082140	All right.
6082140	6085140	There it is, your classic game of the week, Aleste.
6085140	6086140	Great pick.
6086140	6089140	I love these ones where it's like, oh, I didn't know much about it going in,
6089140	6091140	but it's got a great connection to something I do love.
6091140	6093140	So, yeah.
6093140	6096140	And well, Compile, we love Compile.
6096140	6098140	We stand Compile in this house.
6098140	6100140	We stand Compile in this house.
6100140	6101140	Absolutely.
6101140	6102140	All right.
6102140	6105140	Unlike Alestra, it won't make you poop your pants.
6105140	6107140	Dude.
6107140	6109140	I don't know.
6109140	6111140	There's some of the stages are kind of hard.
6111140	6113140	You might shit yourself.
6113140	6114140	All right.
6114140	6122140	Let's go to some rapid fire news that hopefully won't give us that same problem in the ball pit at McDonald's.
6123140	6126140	Rapid fire news, Loki.
6126140	6130140	So we have delays, as is tradition.
6130140	6133140	Dying Light 2 has been delayed to 2022.
6133140	6137140	That is now coming out February 4th.
6137140	6143140	Battlefield 2042 has been delayed a little bit to November 19th.
6143140	6149140	So that is going to be a little bit longer than October 22nd.
6149140	6151140	Come on.
6151140	6152140	And then we've got news.
6152140	6160140	I completely forgot that this was even a thing, but apparently more details on the Twisted Metal TV show that's coming.
6160140	6167140	Anthony Mackie is going to be playing a character in the show that is a name.
6167140	6168140	John Doe.
6168140	6173140	He is a smart ass male milkman.
6173140	6174140	All right.
6174140	6175140	I don't know.
6175140	6176140	I don't.
6176140	6178140	Question mark Boggle.
6178140	6179140	Yep.
6179140	6180140	Same.
6180140	6181140	Yeah.
6181140	6186140	So I guess we will have to wait and see when this happens.
6186140	6188140	They're saying that it's supposed to fill next year.
6188140	6190140	So.
6190140	6191140	Cool.
6191140	6192140	I'll watch it when it comes out.
6192140	6193140	Yep.
6193140	6194140	Same.
6194140	6195140	Same reaction.
6195140	6196140	This is Joe and Matt in chat.
6196140	6197140	What?
6197140	6201140	I hope we get a new Twisted Metal game.
6201140	6203140	That would look pretty cool on PlayStation five.
6203140	6204140	All right.
6204140	6205140	Dark Soccer.
6205140	6206140	Dark Soccer.
6206140	6208140	What do you have for us?
6208140	6214340	Well, some YouTubers, you know, there's those like YouTube channels where they like open
6214340	6218140	warehouses and go into places and stuff like that.
6218140	6219140	Yeah.
6219140	6226140	Well, this group that has a YouTube channel called Cheap Finds Gold Mines and they go
6226140	6232140	through like goodwill yard sales, but they were allowed into a house.
6233140	6239140	That was a hoarders house that had been closed for 20 years, something like that.
6239140	6240140	And it was gross.
6240140	6242140	It was super gross.
6242140	6250140	But they found all kinds of stuff like they found Blockbuster VHS tapes and different
6250140	6254140	collectibles and a bunch of video games.
6254140	6259140	It's I tried to watch some of it was it was really kind of nasty.
6259140	6268140	But they pulled out something like a bunch of factory sealed games.
6268140	6274140	They passed on some already and already opened games, but they did make exceptions for certain
6274140	6282140	games like Toomba on PS1 and the terrible PS3 Bayonetta.
6282140	6288140	And the quote is that they had to deal with a little bit of mouse poo to get some good
6288140	6290140	games.
6290140	6293140	And one of them was bitten by a brown recluse.
6293140	6299140	I'm trying to figure out how was it locked away for 20 years like that.
6299140	6306140	I mean, I realize that, you know, those situations can already sometimes be a little, you know,
6306140	6310140	messy, you know, depending on the severity of it.
6311140	6315140	How did it then sit for 20 years?
6315140	6317140	Well, that's how all the animals showed up.
6317140	6318140	Oh, yeah.
6318140	6322140	But I mean, it was absolutely a hoarder home.
6322140	6327140	And I mean, I've watched hoarders before.
6327140	6331140	Hoarders is usually what I watch to motivate myself to clean my house.
6331140	6332140	Big same.
6332140	6333140	Yeah.
6333140	6334140	Yeah.
6334140	6339140	But yeah, I wouldn't I'm surprised that like it wouldn't have just been broken into, you
6339140	6343140	know, that's apparently not sit there.
6343140	6346140	Yeah, that's weird part to me.
6346140	6350140	Well, I mean, it also depends on where in the country you are.
6350140	6354140	And I don't believe I saw where this was.
6354140	6360140	But, you know, apparently the other person on here got scabies.
6360140	6361140	Wow.
6361140	6362140	All right.
6362140	6363140	I don't know.
6363140	6368140	Would you would you brave that for a shitload of games?
6368140	6372140	If people are still dumb enough to be buying these cartridges for like a million dollars,
6372140	6377140	which, by the way, I should at some point mention those like you to there's a great
6377140	6380140	and I'm sorry, I don't remember the creator in the moment, but about our voiceover guy
6380140	6382140	Jason was telling me about it and all this stuff.
6382140	6384140	There's a great like documentary on YouTube.
6384140	6388140	Somebody in you in chat is going to know what I'm talking about instantly that went on for
6388140	6392140	like it was like a 50 minute documentary that basically talks about why those price.
6392140	6393140	And we've talked about it on this show.
6393140	6398140	Those those limited auctions were like old cartridges going for a million dollars.
6398140	6403140	They basically like how it's all B.S. like it's an artificial inflation of the industry
6403140	6406140	and it's it's basically a crime what's going on.
6406140	6407140	So somebody.
6407140	6410140	Oh, it's Jason in China.
6410140	6412140	Fuck, yeah. Hi, Jason.
6412140	6414140	Says Carl Jobst is the name there.
6414140	6418140	Carl Jobst. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. That's exactly it.
6418140	6423140	So I want to shout that out because I know Jason brought that up and I have not,
6423140	6426140	unfortunately, taken the 50 minutes to watch it myself.
6426140	6429140	Oh, you did. What did you quit? Please tell us about it, because I'm sorry.
6429140	6434140	I know it's rapid fire news and Jamie's story, but this is an important follow up, please.
6434140	6439140	Yeah. So basically, a lot of the SEAL games that are going for a lot of money right now,
6439140	6445140	they're being, I guess, graded by a certain company that's involved with this auction house.
6445140	6451140	And so a lot of these games are also being sold like to themselves, basically.
6451140	6456140	So like they will sell like one of those sealed Mario Brothers games for a million dollars,
6456140	6460140	but they're selling it to another guy that works at the auction house type of thing.
6460140	6463140	So they're inflating the prices by this.
6463140	6468140	These guys got in trouble a while back when they were inflating the prices of, oh, gosh,
6468140	6474140	what was it? Was it baseball cards, comics, something that was like back in the 80s.
6474140	6480140	It wasn't maybe in comics. I don't know. Bobby says coins. Coins.
6480140	6484140	OK. Yeah, yeah. So they were basically inflating the price.
6484140	6491140	So it's really sketch to have like an auction house and a grading company kind of working together
6491140	6495140	because the grading company is supposed to be, you know, separate.
6495140	6499140	So like the guy that owns the grading company is actually in like on the board
6499140	6503140	for the auction house or they're just like involved financially somehow.
6503140	6512140	And so it it basically allows them to grade something slightly better than they would have if, you know,
6512140	6517140	since it's going on the site, it it's just not you watch the video.
6517140	6524140	There's a lot of details, but it basically they're trying to artificially inflate the market so they can make some money.
6524140	6528140	And it's going to crash. Thank you so much, Jason, for the live crowd.
6528140	6533140	I was just about to ask, can somebody point the post the link to the video so y'all can hit save and watch later?
6533140	6538140	So Jason posted the link there in chat for those of you there on the podcast. Of course, you don't see the live chat.
6538140	6544140	But if you search YouTube for that user, Carl Jobst, J-O-B-S-T and it's Carl with a K.
6544140	6549140	Yeah. Same thing's happening with Pokemon cards right now, too, with the Paul's.
6549140	6552140	Oh, yeah. And why like Target, Wal-Mart and shit are pulling back on that.
6552140	6560140	Yeah, it's because it's all speculative and people are really into speculative gambling, marketing.
6560140	6566140	It's, you know, buying stuff that they think is going to have some value, even though it doesn't really have that value.
6566140	6572140	Perfect example. NFTs, you know, it's like these are going to be worth anything in a little bit.
6572140	6577140	But because there's a big boom on it right now, people are trying to make all sorts of money.
6577140	6582140	It sucks, though, because like, yeah, I'm trying to get like some games just to make a small collection for like the NES and stuff.
6582140	6588140	But I'm buying Contra for $70. Sorry, I'll wait for the crash. Thank you very much.
6588140	6593140	Anyway, sorry, I know we went on. You could buy our Contra and actually it's worth more than 70.
6593140	6599140	Sorry, I know we went on a hell of a tangent train there, but I think it's an important follow up because we have been talking about those stories here on OLR.
6599140	6604140	And so I think that and I think we've even been sitting here when talking about it going, it ain't worth that much.
6604140	6611140	I think it's important to talk about that, follow up a little bit and give kudos to the folks that did the work there to really dig deeper there.
6611140	6617140	Anyway, haha. Rapid fire news. Haha. Did you have one more, Jamie, or did we get both? I'm sorry.
6617140	6625140	I did. OK, go ahead. I did. Also, though, I am announcing that Dan and I are actually legit going to be starting to sell off some of the collection.
6625140	6632140	Oh, wow. That's a big room. I mean, I had to sell some stuff, too, because we've got a big change coming.
6632140	6637140	I will. I will. Some of you have figured it out, but I will talk more openly about it very soon.
6637140	6643140	I promise. Well, just know that there might be a master system in your future.
6643140	6651140	Yay. All right. I'm always saying it like that because I'm like, I'm literally in the mindset of less stuff, not more stuff.
6651140	6655140	But I will. You always need a master system. It's true. You always need a master system. All right.
6655140	6665140	Anyway, please see your others. Rapid fire. Haha. Nickelodeon has confirmed DLC for All Star Brawl with some voice acting to come.
6665140	6670140	It's going to be two more characters in addition to the 20 that have already been announced.
6670140	6675140	There. Now it was rapid. All right. That was rapid. Good. All right.
6675140	6685140	Let's travel around the world. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games that are coming out a little sooner than the Nickelodeon All Stars and what have you.
6685140	6689140	Those sorts of games. Loki will start in the US. What's out this week?
6689140	6694140	We have Kenna Bridge of Spirits on PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
6694140	6699140	World War Z Aftermath on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6699140	6703140	Pokemon Unite on iOS and Android.
6703140	6711140	Diablo 2 Resurrected on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.
6711140	6718140	Sable on PC, Mac and Xbox Series X. That game actually looks pretty awesome.
6718140	6725140	Staxel on Nintendo Switch. Death Stranding Director's Cut on PlayStation 5.
6725140	6730140	Dragon Ball Z Kakarot on Nintendo Switch.
6730140	6737140	And Lost Judgment on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.
6737140	6739140	That's it.
6740140	6750140	I have to admit, guys, I'm torn on the Diablo 2 thing. Like, I love Diablo. I want to support the employees that made that game, but it's tough.
6750140	6752140	Is it one of the Gamefast games?
6752140	6760140	No. What I think I'm going to do right now is I'm going to buy it after the first week.
6760140	6768140	Because a lot of the corporate stuff and the corporate numbers really want to tout those, like, day one sales and kind of like how the make or break is in the first week.
6768140	6776140	And so I feel like since that's all the business perspective, maybe if I skip the first week, then they can't use me in that statistic.
6776140	6779140	But then I can ultimately support the team by buying it a little late.
6779140	6784140	That's where my head's at right now. But I don't know. It's a complicated issue. What?
6784140	6786140	Devious.
6786140	6788140	Oh, my little plan?
6788140	6790140	Yeah, it's a bit devious.
6790140	6791140	A little bit.
6791140	6792140	It's hard to talk with this thing in my mouth.
6792140	6799140	No, no, you're fine. You're fine. I thought you said BS at first. I was like, how dare you? But I was like, what part?
6799140	6808140	But maybe a little. I had to really think about that, though. But yeah, I kind of feel like, okay, the corporate stuff is all about that first week.
6808140	6812140	But I could support the team at a later date. And that's kind of where my brain's at right now.
6812140	6818140	I'm not saying anyone else has to do what I do. I'm just talking about how I'm trying to approach this tricky situation.
6818140	6822140	So anyway, let's go to Japan.
6822140	6828140	Some folks in chat are suggesting Mike Deff says, buy it a month after. Maybe.
6828140	6834140	Dr. Tsuya says, yeah, I don't know if I'll be able to get it at launch. It's on my radar only because it's the one Blizzard franchise I'm interested in.
6834140	6839140	S2100 Matt says, I wanted to play Overwatch on Switch badly, but the Hong Kong thing happened. I didn't get it.
6839140	6843140	Eventually, I forgot all about it and moved on because I had too many games to play.
6843140	6849140	And that's also a very realistic approach is that, you know, whether I wait a week, two weeks, a month to finally get it,
6849140	6854140	my brain might be like, oh, shiny and end up getting something else. I still have to get that WarioWare game.
6854140	6860140	Speaking of games, I didn't end up buying in the first week, but that wasn't that was just Rob's Busy than anything else.
6860140	6862140	You can wait.
6862140	6868140	I liked the demo. I liked I don't know anyway. All right. All right.
6868140	6877140	Excuse me. Let's talk about release dates and Japan and coming out this week on September the 24th.
6877140	6884140	No, I'm sorry. The 20. Do we have games coming out this week in Japan? I'm looking at the Nintendo Switch.
6884140	6889140	And what's a week from today would be the 20.
6889140	6895140	I don't know if there is anything out on the switch anyway. There's one Dragon Ball Z game out this week.
6895140	6902140	Is that the Kakarot? Yep. That same Kakarot game that's coming out in other territories is out this week in Japan as well on the switch.
6902140	6906140	Let me see if we have a big PlayStation 5 release. Oh, yeah.
6906140	6912140	OK, so we have Lost Judgment from Sega on the PlayStation 5 this week. That's coming out everywhere as well.
6912140	6917140	Oh, there you go. There's your big release Death Stranding Director's Cut. Is this week really?
6917140	6922140	Wow, that came that's that was fast. I thought that games still had a while to go.
6922140	6924140	So that's out this week in Japan. OK, that makes a lot more sense.
6924140	6929140	So they're they're dodging some of those big releases that are out on PlayStation 5 this week.
6929140	6935140	OK, so how about the UK Dark Sakura on the 21st?
6935140	6940140	We have World War Z Aftermath also coming out now.
6940140	6946140	The rest of these are all on the 24th. Spacebase Startopia on Switch.
6946140	6952140	Ember Uber Firefighters, a game called Just Die Already.
6952140	6963140	Dragon Ball Z Kakarot. I have to say it right. The Addams Family Mansion Mayhem and Lost Judgment.
6963140	6968140	At Last Judgment, it's coming out everywhere. Indeed it is.
6968140	6976140	All right. I want to mention this other comment in chat from Quest Buster because I think it's really good.
6976140	6979140	Quest Buster says about the Diablo 2 predicament I'm talking about.
6979140	6991140	As a side note, Vicarious Visions did the heavy lifting on the Diablo 2 remake and issued a statement to judge for yourself on whether or not to support it.
6991140	7000140	That's a very good point is that, yeah, Vicarious Visions and Vicarious Visions is where we got Jen O'Neill, who is now one of the co-heads of Blizzard.
7000140	7004140	That's a good point. That's worth considering Quest Buster. Thank you for sharing that.
7004140	7008140	Oh, SSJ 100 Matt with some breaking news.
7008140	7016140	Apparently, a Pogo player in Norway caught 98 shiny oshawott today.
7016140	7026140	Shane is not the world leader today. Flop. No, I'm just kidding. He should still be very proud. 98 is a lot. That's crazy.
7026140	7033140	So but unfortunately, Shane is not the very best like no one ever was. He got beat by some person in Norway.
7033140	7041140	Oh, well, maybe there's no agents. Maybe he has the most in the US, though.
7041140	7048140	There are still records to be considered. All right, let's move on. This next story.
7048140	7054140	This is actually sad. This next story. Big, big legend in gaming, right, Loki?
7054140	7069140	Yes. So Clive Sinclair has passed away at the age of 81, and he, of course, was, you know, he invented the ZX Spectrum.
7069140	7075140	ZX. Whatever. You know what? The ZX Spectrum. Fine.
7075140	7088140	Of course, also, you know, there's several other things he's worked on as well. The ZX 80, which launched in 1980, the Commodore PET.
7088140	7097140	Yeah, the ZX 81 as well. So, yeah, that's unfortunate that he passed away.
7097140	7103140	That was actually pretty recent. Yeah. Yes.
7103140	7108140	Well, a big heart cancer to start that. Yeah.
7108140	7116140	You know, what's interesting is that when you so I know we talk about the ZX Spectrum or because the way we read our Z's, we oftentimes say the ZX Spectrum on this shore.
7116140	7120140	But actually, that whole device, if I'm not mistaken, was released.
7120140	7128140	Well, somebody validated this during Bobby's show when this came up. But that system was called the Sinclair here in the US.
7128140	7136140	It was but it was put out by Timex, who you might know from watches, had the license because, you know, in the 80s, everybody was getting into the computer, home computing stuff.
7136140	7143140	So it was the Timex Sinclair. And I think it was kind of like the value model. I think those computers were only about 100 bucks.
7144140	7153140	Now, keep in mind, that's in 1980s dollars. But still, when you consider the Commodore 64 was, I thought it was like four or $500.
7153140	7158140	But somebody in Bobby's chat was saying it was closer to $700. It probably depends when you bought it.
7158140	7167140	The Timex Sinclair was definitely the value device. I kind of think it showed that in its capabilities weren't quite up to the same level as Commodore 64.
7167140	7179140	However, I'm not being shady. There were just so many different types of systems in the 80s. And there were a lot of great games that came out of the Spectrum or the Sinclair, whatever you're looking at there.
7179140	7184140	I'm sorry, I need to go AFK. Smoosh is having a meltdown. I'll be right back.
7184140	7185140	Hi, Smooshy.
7185140	7189140	All right, I'll be right back, guys. Sorry. You need to buy time.
7189140	7190140	All right, well.
7190140	7202140	So then aside from that, you know, also, which is pretty fun is apparently there's a direct correlation between the ZX Spectrum and GTA.
7202140	7209140	So basically, DMA Designs was a group of amateur Spectrum developers.
7209140	7219140	And then of course, they eventually created Lemmines and then later Grand Theft Auto and then later Rockstar North and later became evil.
7219140	7233140	Fortunately, same same story. It's like Activision, you know, six degrees of GTA and independent developers out of their garage, you know, doing it because they need to have the industries back and then became evil.
7233140	7239140	Then they sold their souls. Everybody becomes evil at some point when they get big enough.
7239140	7243140	Well, that must be why we're not very big. We never got evil to become big.
7243140	7248140	We're just not evil. I'm a little evil. That cat's evil. Let me tell you. No, I'm just kidding. I don't know why.
7248140	7250140	What does Smooshy do this time?
7250140	7258140	He's sitting right there just howling, screaming his head off. And I don't know, he's eaten. I don't know what it is. I don't know if he's having litter box drama or what. It's just wild.
7258140	7259140	Rob.
7259140	7260140	What?
7260140	7264140	I am going to talk to you later about the stuff I give Midna to calm the fuck down.
7264140	7266140	Kitty Prozac?
7266140	7269140	I've called them her calm the fuck down treats.
7269140	7273140	Do they make marijuana for cats?
7273140	7275140	They make CBD.
7275140	7277140	OK.
7277140	7279140	Yeah. Yeah. All right.
7279140	7283140	Hey, look, hey, look, you have to make sure we all had to get through this pandemic somehow.
7283140	7296140	That's right. Well, no, no, no. I was I was going to say they also make this sort of airborne hormonal like pheromone thing for cats that's supposed to help with like angry hissy cats.
7296140	7300140	Interesting. But something like that might help chill anxiety.
7300140	7301140	I think he's having anxiety.
7301140	7304140	I know. And I don't know why he's he's.
7304140	7306140	I think he might be a little lonely.
7306140	7308140	Rob, what?
7308140	7313140	Cats can have the same psychological problems that humans do.
7313140	7316140	He has a panic disorder.
7316140	7326140	It doesn't matter how good they have it. You know, I have a really happy life and I still have, you know, depression and stuff from time to time.
7326140	7337140	But they but they do make you know, you should I mean, I know it's probably not going to be cheap, but take Mr. Smoosh in for a hormone check.
7337140	7343140	I've spent all the money, but maybe in, you know, in time when we have some money again, sure.
7343140	7350140	Or I want to take him to the kitty spa and get him that whole kitty massage and that whole stuff.
7350140	7351140	You know, be fun.
7351140	7353140	Midna would freak the fuck out.
7353140	7358140	But but I'll I'll find you the stuff that my friend uses for her cat.
7358140	7361140	I think it's just OTC stuff. So good to know.
7361140	7364140	Did you guys jump ahead at all or were you just buying time? No.
7364140	7368140	OK. We're talking about the the six degrees of GTA.
7368140	7371140	Oh, OK. Haven't heard of it.
7371140	7376140	All right. But I have heard of Final Fantasy 14 because I play an awful lot of it.
7376140	7383140	And they announced this week in a very lengthy stream some of the details for the upcoming expansion and Walker.
7383140	7390140	I'm not going to bore all of you that listen with the details, because if you're a fan of Final Fantasy 14, you probably picked up on some of the big stuff.
7390140	7395140	And if you're not a fan of Final Fantasy 14, I think seven hours of patch notes.
7395140	7403140	And well, they're not actually passionate, but usually like changes and things that are going on with heaven's work, like they basically drill down in.
7403140	7405140	This is what's going to happen to the machinist class.
7405140	7409140	And you caught when Shane was talking on the call, I kind of said what were his highlights.
7409140	7415140	And he mentioned like changes to the summoner class. One of the big ones being like now you don't summon many.
7415140	7420140	Well, you still summon the mini versions of things, but you can summon the big Garuda and the big free.
7420140	7425140	And there's actually reasons to make the big summons, which is, you know, Final Fantasy is supposed to be all about.
7425140	7430140	So that's pretty cool. So that's like one of the changes they were outlining.
7430140	7436140	And as much as I love the Final Fantasy 14 and they're very dedicated to what they do,
7436140	7444140	they're sometimes a little too detailed and a little too thorough with some of the things that they do and a little too apologetic for some of the things that they change.
7444140	7452140	I wish they'd learn a little rudeness from some of the developers over here or even Nintendo.
7452140	7457140	Don't apologize. Just just say this is the way it is and move on.
7457140	7463140	And so they they they did a seven hour stream and it went from I think it was only supposed to be four.
7463140	7471140	I think they joked at one point they were done with part one after three and a half hours of their four hour stream and they ended up going seven hours.
7471140	7475140	They started at seven Pacific time and they were going until two a.m. in the morning.
7475140	7479140	It's just a lot. But there's a lot of good stuff that's going to come in that next expansion.
7479140	7483140	Heaven's word. If you want to look at all the details, I encourage you to look at the highlight reel.
7483140	7487140	There was an 18 minute job action trailer. I did watch that.
7487140	7491140	And the moves look pretty and some of them look really fancy. It's pretty good.
7491140	7495140	So I'm hyped for the expansion. It comes out in November.
7495140	7503140	Heaven's word. Sacred Jade says the Final Fantasy 14 Blu-ray soundtrack Death Unto Dawn was released this past week as well.
7503140	7508140	Yeah, Shane had preordered that and was talking to me about that, except I guess he didn't get his copy of the soundtrack yet.
7508140	7516140	But one of my other friends got the vinyl, some Final Fantasy 14 vinyl and sent a video of him playing it on his record player.
7516140	7520140	I'm like, people actually play the vinyl records? I thought they just collected them.
7520140	7525140	Anyway, let's move on. Dark Sakura.
7525140	7532140	Well, a company that I am very fond of, Quantic Dream, is working on a new game and it's a Star Wars game,
7532140	7537140	which means it's going to have needlessly complicated controls to do everything in the game.
7537140	7545140	But yeah, it's been confirmed.
7545140	7556140	There was a French YouTuber named Gautoz who claimed that the company had signed a deal with Disney since it was done with Sony.
7557140	7577140	And it actually was corroborated by a reliable source, someone named Tom Henderson, who put a very cryptic Star Wars and Detroit Become Human mashup on Twitter.
7578140	7585140	And honestly, I would be here for it.
7585140	7589140	I mean, I don't think that Quantic Dream has made a bad game.
7589140	7592140	I mean, they just have, I think, the two, right?
7592140	7598140	Well, you haven't seen Star Wars Become Gungan, so that's still a possibility.
7598140	7602140	At any rate, I really do hope that this comes to pass.
7602140	7611140	It would be really exciting to see the kind of direction they would take it in, especially with their very complicated story systems.
7611140	7616140	I mean, do you know how many branching paths there are in Detroit?
7616140	7618140	It's pretty crazy.
7618140	7621140	The way that Dark Sakura completely ignored Loki's comment.
7621140	7626140	And I will not validate that comment with this feedback.
7626140	7627140	I won't.
7627140	7628140	It's true.
7629140	7632140	Questbuster in chat says, Beyond Two Sith.
7632140	7633140	No.
7633140	7634140	Pretty good. Pretty good.
7634140	7636140	Y'all are funny. Y'all are comedians.
7636140	7650140	However, just going to say that Quantic Dream also was reported in 2018 by two French publications, Le Monde et Media Part,
7650140	7658140	that said that they had a very toxic work culture and had financial malpractice, but Quantic Dream sued both of those for defamation.
7658140	7659140	Oh, wow.
7659140	7662140	So there we go.
7662140	7663140	All right.
7663140	7665140	All right. A few more stories.
7665140	7666140	Oh, yeah. I found the other games.
7666140	7671140	It was Nomad Soul, Fahrenheit, Heavy Rain, Beyond Two Souls, Detroit Become Human.
7671140	7672140	All right.
7672140	7676140	We have a few more stories, and then we're going to get to the listener roundtable.
7676140	7681140	If anyone wants to call in, you can join our green room over on our Discord server, vognetwork.com slash Discord.
7681140	7684140	But first, a story from Loki.
7684140	7685140	Yes.
7685140	7690140	So there is a fan game that's been made for Among Us called Among Us Arena.
7690140	7703140	It is a fighting game and like a fighting game, you play as the different characters in the game and you kill each other with basically all the different kills that they have in Among Us.
7703140	7712140	And in a take that is not Nintendo, the company or the developers behind Among Us thought it was pretty funny.
7712140	7717140	In fact, have like said that basically they're going to check it out as well.
7717140	7723140	But yeah, they're totally cool with it, as they should be.
7723140	7725140	It is free to play as well.
7725140	7731140	It's also it's also different when your studio is only three people, you know, and it's not.
7731140	7736140	You probably don't have as many complicated legal. You don't have a legal department when there's only three people at your company.
7736140	7740140	Well, I don't know if they've grown since they did Among Us. I imagine they probably have a little bit.
7740140	7743140	But, you know, originally it was three people. We all know that.
7743140	7746140	So, yeah. All right. One more story for you guys tonight.
7746140	7750140	And it's about prototypes. And these can be a lot of fun.
7750140	7756140	And Dark Soccer, I feel like some of this might be up your alley because, you know, unfinished Dreamcast stuff.
7756140	7758140	That's always kind of fun, right?
7758140	7765140	So what happened is that and of course, this thing isn't loading on my particular page over here, so I'm going to go off memory.
7765140	7768140	I hate it. If somebody wants to help me fill in here.
7768140	7775140	So what happened here is that this site and I think it's Hidden Palace that found all this or they got ties to it or whatever,
7775140	7781140	basically found a lot of prototypes for either the original Xbox or Dreamcast as well.
7781140	7787140	And so these are most of them are playable in emulators if you want to check it out or they even have.
7787140	7793140	You know, it's all questionable legality, but we are talking about systems that are way past their prime.
7793140	7796140	And this is more of a video game preservation type of thing, I think.
7796140	7807140	But what was of particular interest to me when I was looking through the archive myself is that there was Xbox versions of DDR UltraMix 1, 2, and 3.
7807140	7810140	There were prototypes of them that were available.
7810140	7814140	And that's pretty cool. Although I got to be honest, I was reading through some of the changes.
7814140	7820140	It didn't seem like there were a lot of changes. It just seemed like the early version of DDR UltraMix 1 was missing three songs.
7820140	7824140	Like they got some late licenses and that, which makes sense. It's kind of what I expected.
7824140	7829140	And then in UltraMix 3, there was like some language changes in the world.
7829140	7834140	I even forgot about that mode where you travel around the world and stuff that was in there.
7834140	7839140	And then like UltraMix 2, I don't think there was a lot like they changed some title screens and some things like that.
7839140	7844140	So you're not going to see like, oh, they cut these songs or a completely different, nah, it wasn't that juicy.
7844140	7850140	But there was some neat stuff in there. So it's interesting that, and I don't, was anyone able to pull the story up?
7850140	7855140	And how did they find this trove of discs? I don't, that part I don't remember.
7858140	7859140	Let's see.
7862140	7863140	I can figure that out.
7863140	7866140	I don't know where they found those discs, but yeah.
7866140	7869140	Yeah. Well, and sometimes the people don't want to be found.
7869140	7875140	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, to be fair, the Dreamcast is still getting homebrew stuff.
7875140	7879140	That's true, but we also have a lot of prototypes here of things that did come out.
7879140	7884140	And yeah, I noticed the Xbox prototypes, the UltraMix games, and Dark Tetsuya said this was neat.
7884140	7888140	Questbuster points out, I still love the Dreamcast startup sound.
7888140	7890140	Yes, there is that too.
7890140	7891140	Yeah.
7891140	7893140	The Dreamcast's in the first PlayStation.
7894140	7897140	Oh yeah, the first PlayStation one was iconic.
7897140	7901140	So this is all tied to something called, I was able to pull it up on my phone.
7901140	7909140	This is all something tied to something called Project Deluge, which was just something I guess this site has been working on, this hidden palace.
7909140	7911140	So they don't really say, oh, okay.
7911140	7919140	It's an ongoing project to archive and assess all of the items featured in a lot of video game development material that has been gathered over the course of many years.
7919140	7930140	This has been made possible through the dedication of only one extremely kind individual who has taken the heruculent task of dumping every single thing in the lot by themselves.
7930140	7939140	Each item in the lot was assessed by a team of dedicated individuals for playability and integrity on both software via emulation and hardware when necessary.
7939140	7944140	Each item was then lightly documented and given a general overview of some of the main interesting facts about the item in question.
7944140	7949140	I'm reading directly from that website hidden palace dot org on where this all came from.
7949140	7953140	So they're not quite saying directly, but it just sounds like sources.
7953140	7958140	And they've had a very generous individual who's found a lot of this stuff.
7958140	7965140	So I imagine somebody was in the know in the industry and had some stuff in their office that they took with them.
7965140	7967140	I bet I'm going to just guess.
7967140	7970140	OK, I don't know nothing about nothing.
7970140	7983140	A lot of this stuff, like when I was reading about the DDR UltraMix thing, the prototype for number three was slower and it actually had text on there that said, please be patient.
7983140	7986140	The retail version will not have these loading times or something like that.
7986140	8001140	That tells me these are probably all prerelease review copies from a day when you needed to have prototypes out to the outlets for five months in advance of release, because you needed that lead time to get it in the magazine.
8001140	8005140	Because the outlets had dev systems to be able to play those on.
8005140	8006140	Yes.
8006140	8007140	So my guess.
8007140	8013140	Also some of these though, they reference like the DDR economics preview version.
8013140	8016140	Like, wasn't that an event that they did as well?
8016140	8017140	I don't know.
8017140	8022140	Some of these tie within events that we may have attended.
8022140	8038140	So my big guess is that somebody in the industry that worked for a magazine and it may not have been the US, could have been Canada, could have been overseas, could have been anything, had a big collection of these review discs from over the years that they never got rid of.
8038140	8040140	And now we're all benefiting from that.
8040140	8056140	That's my, if I were to bet money, place chips on the roulette board of where this came from, I'm going to say, press reviewer from a time long forgotten when there were four month lead times to get games in magazines.
8056140	8057140	All right.
8057140	8059140	That all being said, yeah.
8059140	8062140	Questbuster in chat says, yay, preservation efforts.
8062140	8063140	It does make sense.
8063140	8065140	It says it makes sense.
8065140	8067140	Well, thank you for validating my crazy thinking.
8067140	8069140	But yeah, that just has to be what it is.
8069140	8073140	And but I completely respect the fact that this Hidden Palace site, they can't name who it is.
8073140	8078140	They don't, you know, because it is it is still a, you know, sure, all these games are old.
8078140	8081140	They're not going to, you know, sell the way they use.
8081140	8085140	I mean, I guess there's always I think some of them also could have been donated by the developers.
8086140	8100140	And that's that's true. Some of them could have, you know, like there are some game developers that kind of released their stuff to Mame, the multi arcade machine emulator, saying that you may use this.
8100140	8103140	And there's some who released who sent out the unfinished ones.
8103140	8110140	The one of the biggest ones I can think of is like their Robotech Crystal Dreams.
8110140	8112140	I remember when we were waiting for that game to come out.
8112140	8120140	That could be the case. But the reason why I'm placing my chips where I am is because you have a variety of different systems happening here.
8120140	8123140	It's not all coming from like one system, one source, one publisher.
8123140	8130140	So that that's why. But it could be I mean, they do kind of say it's one person's efforts, but it could be that maybe the donations came from.
8130140	8132140	Here's another hint too.
8132140	8138140	So I just kind of browsing through some of these different different games that are on here.
8138140	8144140	And for Powerstone, this is watermarked to one thousand eighteen thousand, which is tips and tricks.
8144140	8151140	Maybe these were copies that were sent out to different publications for like, you know, tip guides and stuff like that as well.
8151140	8158140	Absolutely. Why not? Didn't didn't our friends at pre-made? Are they still going pre-made games out in?
8158140	8163140	Oh, are they still? I mean, I don't I don't know. I better I better watch my mouth.
8163140	8167140	All right. I don't I don't know where they came from.
8167140	8171140	It's just sometimes you draw lines where you see connections.
8171140	8175140	OK, let's get to the listener roundtable.
8175140	8180140	I want to check in on the mailbag. I'm pretty sure dark soccer told me before the show there were no emails,
8180140	8183140	but it's a good chance for me to check in and I'm going to refresh.
8183140	8187140	OK, there's nothing. Participate at Orange Lounge, radio dot com.
8187140	8192140	If you want to send us an email in a future week, of course, we'll take questions in our chat room.
8192140	8195140	And I don't see anybody in our green room at the moment, but you never know.
8195140	8198140	Thank you, Dr. C. Is this Prima? If I recall correctly, they shut down.
8198140	8202140	That's what I thought, too. Yeah, I had a friend who used to write for them.
8202140	8206140	Yeah. And we we met them at one of those early E3s.
8206140	8211140	And we kind of always talked about like we should get together and have lunch because we're all in Sacramento.
8211140	8215140	What can we do for each other? But that didn't I mean, I can say that happened.
8215140	8219140	I can say that now because they're gone right one time and that like didn't happen.
8219140	8222140	Like they weren't there or something. Yeah, I remember driving over there.
8222140	8226140	Yeah, I remember. It's been so long. I remember something about that.
8226140	8233140	Yeah. What do you all think? The OLR strategy guide collab that never was.
8233140	8239140	OK, amongst many other ones that we've many other flopped collaborations over the year.
8239140	8243140	Perhaps we'll detail in a book that you can buy in stores someday.
8243140	8250140	The shit that didn't happen. The untold story. Orange Lounge fucked OVO.
8250140	8255140	How your favorite podcast was prevented from getting any bigger. All right.
8255140	8259140	No one special. Seventy seven in chat says roundtable question.
8259140	8265140	Do any of you ever hang on to old demo discs that came with gaming mags from back in the day?
8265140	8269140	If so, which ones? That's a great question. I don't know what we're just talking about.
8269140	8272140	Hold on to all of them.
8272140	8281140	They're in a bin. Yeah, I had like I was used to get like Xbox magazine stuff and you several the Xbox 360 demo discs in there.
8281140	8290140	I think I threw those out there when I end up leaving my last company because they were all at my desk and I wasn't using them for anything.
8290140	8298140	Or they're in a box. One of the two things. Yeah, I did a big purge as well with that stuff.
8298140	8303140	So I no longer have a lot of those discs. I have some, but not a lot.
8303140	8312140	I think I still have a jumping flash one, at least in a couple of Dreamcast ones and like an Xbox one.
8312140	8316140	So I used to take the PlayStation ones, though,
8316140	8322140	and rip music off of them because sometimes it would actually have a whole game's worth of information on it.
8322140	8329140	I think the reality for me is, too, is that a lot of those discs kind of exist on the Internet now, much like these prototypes we just talked about.
8329140	8335140	So like if I ever like had to see what was all of this, I could just download it from the Internet and emulate it.
8335140	8339140	That's the reality. I know that's not the same for most people. I respect that.
8339140	8343140	I understand some people are going to see the value in hanging on to them. I couldn't justify it anymore.
8343140	8350140	That's the problem. And Jason even in chat points out the digital form will likely be archive dot org.
8350140	8356140	And I'm sure most of them already do. And that's a follow up to another comment he said, saying I have a ton of PC gamer demo discs.
8356140	8360140	I just recently decided to start on a disc preservation archival project.
8360140	8365140	So I looked in some many, many years old media bins. I need to see where I can donate them.
8365140	8372140	Well. The archive dot org is definitely going to be probably a place where you'll find a lot of that stuff, so.
8372140	8377140	Good call. All right.
8377140	8381140	I don't see anything in the chat. Any other last minute stories, Loki, that you want to talk about?
8381140	8387140	Yeah, unfortunately, we had a Sega and Capcom artist pass away.
8387140	8391140	Mick McGinty. Mick McGinty.
8391140	8398140	He was famous for a lot of different cover arts of games that you may remember, like Street Fighter two.
8398140	8403140	He also did the artwork for all of the zoo type Coon games.
8403140	8412140	Streets of Rage 2, Kid Chameleon, Shining Force and Leisure Suit Larry.
8412140	8419140	So, yeah, he passed away peacefully, they said.
8419140	8426140	I'm looking at our Discord for some stories because you guys post stories throughout the week in Discord, and sometimes we don't get to all of them on the show.
8426140	8429140	But this is a good time for me to address some of them.
8429140	8432140	Apparently, we didn't I don't know why we forgot to bring this up on the show.
8432140	8441140	But apparently this G force now, which I talked about earlier in the show, they had a big leak that happened.
8441140	8447140	Which is interesting because there was a lot of titles on it where they're like things we have never heard of.
8447140	8453140	And Nvidia actually confirmed the leak is real, but the games are speculative.
8453140	8456140	That's what they're saying. So they're not they're saying there's no.
8456140	8460140	But that's what somebody who's trying to cover up a big fuck up would say, right?
8460140	8466140	Because seriously, these are the games that were in the list.
8466140	8473140	Final Fantasy nine remake Bioshock RTX remaster Resident Evil four remake.
8473140	8475140	Well, we all know that one's going to happen.
8475140	8482140	Halo five PC. I think that would happen to Grand Theft Auto trilogy.
8482140	8490140	Oh, what? They're going to remaster the Grand Theft Auto trilogy after DMCA striking all those people making content for the original trilogy.
8491140	8496140	Crisis four Half Life two remastered Injustice three and so on.
8496140	8502140	Nvidia said it was only for internal testing and that the games listed don't necessarily exist.
8502140	8505140	Sounds like some of course they don't try to cover up. That's right.
8505140	8508140	You didn't see anything here. Nothing happened here.
8508140	8519140	No, I think I think it is very possible that they just came up with a list of dummy titles that somebody came up with to just kind of test the interface of the software and all that stuff.
8519140	8528140	So but I, I, I think somebody was probably writing a fan list, but probably was like, yeah, Grand Theft Auto trilogy.
8528140	8537140	That'll happen like kind of like Logie saying, you know, like I'm going to make some educated guesses and, you know, a broken clock is still right twice a day, right?
8537140	8543140	Yeah. Yeah. Let's see.
8543140	8546140	Funcom bought the Conan IP.
8546140	8552140	The Age of Conan and Conan Exiles developer is now owned by Tencent. What's that?
8552140	8555140	And Conan O'Brien. Not that Conan.
8555140	8564140	They bought Cabinet Group, which Conan the Librarian, Detective Conan, held dozens of the intellectual properties like Conan the Barbarian, Mutant Year Zero and Solomon Kane.
8564140	8567140	Interesting.
8568140	8574140	All right. Some of the comments there from our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
8574140	8582140	Ooh, burn. Orange right in chat says, at least the list was somewhat realistic. Konami was missing.
8582140	8586140	They don't make games anymore. It's fine.
8586140	8591140	That should be the new title in the Mario is Missing series. Konami is missing.
8591140	8595140	All right. I think that's going to do it. We know right where Konami is and it ain't making games.
8595140	8600140	Yeah, it's it's living in the dumpster because they set their last dumpster. It's in that hoarder's house.
8600140	8605140	All right. With the roaches. We're going to wrap up the show for tonight.
8605140	8609140	Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking us out tonight.
8609140	8614140	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend about the show, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
8614140	8618140	But, you know, if the voices aren't here, then we can't put them out on air.
8618140	8622140	So tell a friend about the show. Leave us a five star review on iTunes.
8622140	8632140	I'm still going to say a host on Twitch goes some of the way, although it sounds like due to some recent changes, hosting isn't quite as great as it used to be.
8632140	8636140	So I have to think of a way to reword this typical shout out I do at the end.
8636140	8644140	So I will just simply say we always appreciate a follow here on Twitch and spreading the word of our Twitch channel here at VOG Network as well is very helpful.
8644140	8648140	Also, I would be remiss not to mention it is September.
8648140	8656140	So if you wanted to get a subscription to VOG Network and access the archive feed of a couple of years now of O.L.R. and Bobby Blackwell's show as well as some bonus streams.
8656140	8663140	If you want to see you want to see Shane and I recap the best Pokemon of all time definitively.
8663140	8667140	That's one of the bonus streams available to our subscribers.
8667140	8672140	So you can check that out over at Twitch.TV slash VOG Network.
8672140	8680140	What else do I want to say here? Nice review goes a long way. All that stuff. Oh, the shop. VOG Network dot com slash shop.
8680140	8692140	If you are wanting to buy some merchandise such as an Orange Lounge Radio shirt or a VOG Network shirt or a Bobby Blackwell mug, there's lots of options available to you over at VOG Network dot com slash shop.
8692140	8696140	Maybe we'll put some new shit up in the coming months. We'll see.
8696140	8701140	I think that now that's everything. So I think we're ready to get to our final thoughts and wrapping it up.
8701140	8708140	Dark soccer is going to continue the party tonight live on Twitch with some dead by daylight. I'm sure she's going to do some very sweaty pig games.
8708140	8712140	I was actually watching a little bit dark soccer stream last night.
8712140	8718140	She got very excited when she got an RPD badge so that she could use it tonight for you all to play a sweaty, sweaty pig build.
8718140	8722140	Are you holding me to do resident piggy tonight, Rob?
8722140	8726140	I'm not holding you to do anything. But you did say last night you were going to do it.
8726140	8738140	I'm probably gonna resident. I just want to do it when I've I've got myself in the right mindset because last night I was playing kind of like potato.
8738140	8742140	Well, it happens. MMR has made the game weird anyway we're all getting used to it.
8742140	8754140	MMR. I don't. OK, so I found somebody linked a video that where apparently they data mined the MMR settings.
8754140	8761140	And I'm going to go back and read it later and read it, watch it a little bit later and see if I can figure some stuff out about it.
8761140	8765140	All right. Well, let me get your final thought, because I know you probably want to head out and get that started.
8765140	8767140	MMR is balls.
8767140	8771140	All right. Thanks for being here, Dark soccer. We'll see you next week.
8771140	8773140	Loki, your final thought.
8773140	8776140	My final thought is the cat won't stop screaming at me.
8776140	8782140	Yeah, I was having that same problem, too. So I, I, I took him into Alan and said, deal with it.
8782140	8786140	All right. It worked. All right.
8786140	8791140	My final thought is WarioWare. It's got to happen this week and hopefully I'll do some streaming.
8791140	8796140	My dad's belated birth. So my dad's birthday is always during Dragon Con now.
8796140	8800140	So I always seem to miss his birthday, sadly, but that just means we go out to dinner when we get back.
8800140	8803140	So we went out on Tuesday, so I couldn't stream on Tuesday night.
8803140	8806140	And then I had other plans on Friday, so I've actually been kind of busy.
8806140	8810140	And then I'm trying to support Alan doing streaming, so I don't like to do streaming on top of him.
8810140	8813140	We don't have the Internet or the resources for that anyway.
8813140	8817140	But I will try to stream either Tuesday or Friday this week and probably do some WarioWare.
8817140	8822140	And then maybe, maybe just a random Dead by Daylight stream of my own, just because I have fun playing the game.
8822140	8826140	Final Fantasy, we talked about that with Shane. So there'll be some randomness as well. We'll do that.
8826140	8829140	So that'll be for me over at twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts.
8829140	8835140	Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show or participating live.
8835140	8840140	However you participated with Orange Lounge Radio tonight, we appreciate you and we hope you all have a wonderful week.
8840140	8844140	We'll see you in seven days to do it again here on Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.
8857140	8862140	Sunday nights at 6 p.m. Pacific, 9 p.m. Eastern.
8862140	8870140	The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network.
