00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,640
Some former Ubisoft developers have founded a new development studio, Nesting Games,

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,800
and have announced their desire to return to, quote, RPGs that are focused on immersion,

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,040
great characters, powerful storytelling, and strong gameplay.

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,060
First comes the proclamation, then come the delays, then comes the face of the studio

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,480
making you their bitch.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,560
Or at least that's what happened with Daikatana, and fingers crossed for Nesting that history

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,720
does not repeat.

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,720
This is just one hype train.

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,600
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,000
this and the rest of the week's gaming news.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,800
Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,160
Hello, my friends, out there on the internet.

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,320
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,440
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are back with you live once again for this episode

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,200
number 884 tonight, September the 19th of 2021.

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,800
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you guys, and I am joined by my co-hosts.

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,680
Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Sommers.

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,680
Hi, Rob.

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,680
Look at my shirt.

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,680
Hi.

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
What's that?

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,320
Oh, it's Golden Girls.

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,320
Go for gold.

24
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,320
Is that what it says?

25
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,160
That's what it says, and I got it for three bucks at Target on clearance.

26
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,160
Okay.

27
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,160
Oh, hey.

28
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,160
Work.

29
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,160
Hey, we love a sale.

30
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,160
We sure do.

31
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,240
Yeah, but especially a Golden Girls sale.

32
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,240
Yes.

33
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,240
Yes.

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,160
We sure have licensed that Golden Girls stuff everywhere.

35
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,680
Like I see more of it now than I did in the 80s.

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,680
I mean, I was young.

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,040
I was still sad though that the spinoff never took off.

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
What was it?

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
Golden Palace?

40
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
The Golden Palace.

41
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
Yeah.

42
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,040
The Golden Palace.

43
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
On CBS, and it didn't have Bea Arthur.

44
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,920
It had the others running a hotel, and they added Don Cheadle was in it.

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,080
I remember.

46
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,920
That was one of his first roles.

47
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:02,720
And I think there was another person that's a little more famous now that was in it too

48
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,160
that played the cook, and I can't remember his name off the top of my head.

49
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,080
I don't remember either, but it was an interesting premise.

50
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,200
I thought it would have been really, really good, but alas.

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Alas.

52
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,080
And also thanks to Fat Ninja Diem for the 205 bits.

53
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,080
Yes.

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,240
Usually we call that out at the end, but that's all right.

55
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,160
We can always take time for a special acknowledgement.

56
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,120
I just happened to see it, so I thought I'd say it.

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,800
Okay, Sia Tabiri says it was...

58
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,920
I was gonna say it was one of Cheech and Chong, but I wasn't 100% sure on it, but it was Cheech

59
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,360
Martin that was in it that played Chewie the chef.

60
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,080
So okay, I should have went with my gut, but I was like, well, if I'm wrong, I don't want

61
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,080
to be wrong.

62
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,200
I should have went with my gut.

63
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,200
We're human.

64
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,640
If we're wrong, I'm sure someone on the internet will call us out later.

65
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,640
Yes.

66
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,560
Someone on the internet will cancel us later for being wrong.

67
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,320
Say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

68
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:03,440
Yeah, the only thing Golden Palace ever actually succeeded at, it was a chain of Chinese, Asian

69
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,120
buffet restaurants.

70
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,560
Yeah, not the TV show, yes.

71
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
How are you doing?

72
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
What's this game behind you tonight?

73
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,480
It looks like VR or something.

74
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,200
It's Power Washing Simulator.

75
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,400
Oh shit.

76
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,160
I've seen demos for that or trailers.

77
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,480
You haven't played it though.

78
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,480
I've heard it.

79
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
I haven't either.

80
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,160
Oh, it looks like fun.

81
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,840
Like in a very like, you know, chill out kind of way.

82
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,400
It does look like a lot of fun actually.

83
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Yeah.

84
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
I need to pick that game up.

85
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,360
One of my Twitch friends, Luda Bell, she plays this on the weekends and it really is chill

86
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,720
like to the point that I'm trying, I need to see if it's available for Mac on Steam.

87
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,660
I want to do one of those games like Power Washing or like Cookie Clicker or something

88
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,180
like stream that where it's like, there really is no game.

89
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,700
It ends up being a just chatting stream, but with a game playing behind it.

90
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,780
So yeah, to add to that, I mean, there's a lot of games like that.

91
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,300
So there there's also now Lawnmower Sim.

92
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,300
Okay.

93
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,300
Yeah.

94
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:11,700
It's all the chores just, you know, honestly, honestly, gamify real life on resulting the

95
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,700
game.

96
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,540
Microsoft Flight Simulator is that too, like, sure.

97
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,540
It's a beautiful game.

98
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,740
And, you know, it's intricate with the takeoff and everything, especially if you play in

99
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,740
pro mode.

100
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,140
But once you get airborne, do you know what you do?

101
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:31,460
You fly and you watch the ground behind under you change as you fly in real time.

102
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:37,660
So if you're flying from, I don't know, say, O.L.R.'s hometown of Sacramento to Vegas,

103
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,900
you're going to fly for an hour over nothing.

104
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,380
The Mojave just like in real life, the Mojave Desert.

105
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,780
I was pointing out there is a new simulator, though, that's a gas station simulator.

106
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,460
Oh, I don't know about popularity right now.

107
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,460
Yeah.

108
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,980
All of these games I need to get buy them all.

109
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,900
We just really need our Washington, though.

110
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,780
We really need to thank the Penn and Teller because I think they started really the whole

111
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,300
thing with Desert Bus.

112
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,380
I'll acknowledge that.

113
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,940
I mean, I don't know if any of these devs would say they were inspired by Desert Bus,

114
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,060
but indirectly, perhaps they know they were in their hearts.

115
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,740
OK, did you say car washing simulator, Logie?

116
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,860
Gas station simulator.

117
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,300
Oh, because I'm pretty sure there's already a car wash.

118
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,020
We need a car washing simulator.

119
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,700
But I mean, technically, right now we're watching in power washing simulator.

120
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,940
It is car wash simulator.

121
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,180
So I want car.

122
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,180
Well, hear me out.

123
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,020
I want car washing simulator.

124
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:38,020
But with your choice, bikini, cheerleader, adult adult women, not the creepy stuff.

125
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,780
Bikini cheerleader, adult women or Speedo men.

126
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,780
Your choice.

127
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:48,780
If that's if that neither one is your approach, then cute animals are doing the washing for

128
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,780
you for you.

129
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,780
I know what we need.

130
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,260
We need a pet salon simulator.

131
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,260
Pet what?

132
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,020
I'm pet salon simulator.

133
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,100
All of these things exist.

134
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,100
Let's see.

135
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,020
So car wash simulator.

136
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,300
There is a car wash simulator already.

137
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,340
OK, good pet grooming simulator.

138
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,340
Perfect.

139
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,340
There is not.

140
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,900
Thank you.

141
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,900
Excellent choice.

142
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,900
Copyright Jamie.

143
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,300
Excellent, excellent alternative by Sia Tabiri in chat.

144
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,980
So I was saying either bikini women or Speedo men, or if neither is what you want, Sia Tabiri

145
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,060
says both Grimace and Birdie from McDonald's.

146
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,060
Perfect.

147
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,220
The McDonald's, the Hamburglar and all that.

148
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,220
What is it?

149
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,220
The McDonaldland friends.

150
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,220
McDonaldland friends.

151
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,220
I was like the McDonald gang.

152
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,220
What are they called?

153
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,100
They're called something.

154
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,100
They are definitely.

155
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,100
Well, the Hamburglar.

156
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,100
Hello.

157
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,100
It's definitely a gang.

158
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,100
And the Fry Guys.

159
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:53,380
But you know, the Grimace represents the feeling you have after eating too much McDonald's.

160
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,860
Do they still make those playgrounds with like the burgers that are just giant iron

161
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,860
cages for children?

162
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,860
They don't.

163
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,940
They stopped doing that in the 80s, but like I remember going in there.

164
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,500
We used to do that all the time.

165
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,220
You climb up into those giant cages that they have in it.

166
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,340
It's like, why would I want to go up in there?

167
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,660
Because there's like no way to get out if there's other kids in there.

168
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,340
Like you're like stuck in there.

169
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,020
So you better not be claustrophobic or anything because.

170
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,500
You know, it's dangerous.

171
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,540
Now they have like those mini pits like they had at Discovery Zone, you know, the little

172
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,180
crawl around and ball pit ball pit.

173
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,180
Yeah.

174
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,380
It's it's the new thing is it's not, I had friends, every zone, let's ball pit.

175
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,100
I had friends that worked at McDonald's growing up saying that the ball pit was a peepee poo

176
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,100
poo zone.

177
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,100
Like do not do that.

178
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,460
All right.

179
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,660
That is a, that is a high volume peepee poo poo zone.

180
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,660
Like don't do it.

181
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,580
Um, some, I used to go to the Discovery Zone with my brothers and while they were off playing,

182
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,220
I found this one little place that none of the kids would want to go in.

183
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,900
It was basically like a giant hammock and I'd take a nap.

184
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,820
Tiger Claw in chat says they should make a blockbuster simulator where you run the store.

185
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,460
That's that was on the show a few weeks ago.

186
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,860
It's a VR game coming to PlayStation, isn't it?

187
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,140
It was something like it was based on the last blockbuster.

188
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,580
Like I remember that being a thing that we talked about on the show.

189
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,380
SSJ 100 Matt says still have Mayor McCheese statues around that haven't been stolen over

190
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,780
the years by local teens.

191
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,780
Wow.

192
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,780
Those should be.

193
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,740
Yeah, most of the fast food restaurants around here have taken out their playground.

194
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,380
I haven't seen a playground in forever at a fast food restaurant.

195
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,660
There's still some, you know, who has one actually, Chick-fil-A has a playground inside.

196
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,140
They have a ball pit.

197
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,140
Interesting.

198
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,140
It's super tiny.

199
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,660
That's actually what I was thinking about when I was thinking about the fake Discovery

200
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:44,260
Zone was that, that one Chick-fil-A that Becky used to take her son to.

201
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,260
Huh.

202
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,260
Interesting.

203
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,260
All right.

204
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,260
Anyway, we don't support Chick-fil-A do we?

205
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,980
We could talk about playing in the, uh, uh, the ball pit at the local fast food restaurant,

206
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,340
but we also play video games in our spare time.

207
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,500
Let's get into tonight's kickoff topic, uh, which is a bit of a downer surprise, I guess.

208
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
I don't know.

209
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Uh, Loki, this is, this is weird.

210
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
It's kind of came out of nowhere.

211
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,900
Loki, why don't you get into the kickoff topic for us tonight?

212
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,180
So yes, unfortunately, and I think that they were in the process of shutting these down.

213
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:17,500
It just wasn't shut down yet, but, uh, the servers for the little big planet content

214
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:24,540
for PlayStation three and Vita, um, have been shut down because apparently hackers have

215
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:31,700
gone in and, um, you know, they were, I guess, DDoSing the servers.

216
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:39,180
So they right now kept them down because they kept getting Melissa's, our, um, messages

217
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,860
left, um, by the hackers in the game as well.

218
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,700
And they weren't able to trace it back to, um, yeah, they trace it back to a single fan

219
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,460
who was unhappy with Sony's treatment of the franchise.

220
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,260
Yes, that's the perfect way.

221
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,380
So I'm unhappy with what you did with little big planet.

222
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,700
So I'm going to ruin it for everybody.

223
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,700
Ruined everything.

224
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,700
That's, that's, that's great.

225
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,460
Um, it has fucking kids today.

226
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,220
That kid was never locked inside of an iron McDonald's burger.

227
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,940
I guarantee it.

228
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:15,980
You haven't seen your life flash before your highs inside of a iron hamburger, but, um,

229
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:20,900
they have brought the little big planet three servers for PlayStation four back online after

230
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:26,180
a small update, but the PlayStation three, uh, trilogy and the Vita versions are now

231
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,820
permanently deactivated.

232
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:35,580
So all that user made content, um, all those Alanis more set, you know, uh, levels, they're

233
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,620
all lost to time now.

234
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,580
Um, the Parker Posey worship level, my favorite level that was ever in little big planet.

235
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,580
Yes.

236
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,580
Yeah.

237
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,580
The Parker Posey levels.

238
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,580
Yes.

239
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,580
That's sad.

240
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,460
Um, but I mean, also it's just the fact that it came out of nowhere and it's just, it's

241
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,060
just alarming that, you know, we, cause usually when these types of shutdowns happen, you

242
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,060
have warning, right?

243
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,140
Like, you know, or, or take that whole thing when Sony was like, we're going to close the

244
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,180
PlayStation three and the Vita stores.

245
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,180
Remember that?

246
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,860
And that got dialed back real quick after the feedback.

247
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,900
But, um, usually, I mean, you know, say, uh, foes, uh, on the Microsoft side of the fence,

248
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,220
but it's still the same thing.

249
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,740
Just this week, four is a motor sports seven was sunset it like just in the past few days.

250
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,580
Um, but there was a lot of warning that that was coming.

251
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,260
You know, they, they warn people, they gave the notice, they put the game on sale and

252
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,260
all this stuff.

253
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,660
Uh, but with little big planet, it's just kind of poof gone.

254
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,660
And especially considering what an iconic series that is on PlayStation, that's just

255
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,340
really a bummer.

256
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:40,020
Now granted, I'm almost certain little big planet three on PlayStation four was probably

257
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:45,900
a giveaway game, like multiple times, whether it was on PlayStation plus or that whole,

258
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,940
um, at home with PlayStation event during the pandemic, I'm almost positive that game

259
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,100
has come up at some point, but it's, it still sucks, especially on the Vita front.

260
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,840
I mean, the PS three is one thing, but that means no more portable little big planet outside

261
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
the single player levels.

262
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,740
Yeah, it's a bummer.

263
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:12,220
So, um, yeah, I mean, does it, do you think this, um, might discourage people from contributing

264
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,980
to these sorts of communities knowing and having that reminder that their work is in

265
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,980
somebody else's hands at the end of the day?

266
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,980
Really?

267
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,980
No, I don't think so.

268
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,980
No.

269
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,660
One of these days, all those Roblox creations people are making, they're just gonna poof

270
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,660
into the night

271
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,380
and my kids will be disappointed.

272
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,920
My kids won't be disappointed by that time, but, uh, they'll probably be in their thirties

273
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
by that time.

274
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,140
There's a lot of content like the little big planet stuff, you know, there's a lot of content

275
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:46,280
that was good and there's also a lot more content that wasn't so good.

276
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:52,640
And honestly, that's kind of where Roblox is that music licensing and, or the, uh, piracy

277
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,760
and all sorts of assets and IPs and whatnot, and it's just a wild west of craziness there

278
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,000
that is going to be smacked down at some point.

279
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,240
But yeah, well, little big planet had a lot of those problems as well.

280
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,680
I think they started to crack down on it a little bit, but I'm pretty sure it was a copyright

281
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,000
wild wild west in many ways now.

282
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,680
And it is, you know, we still have to emphasize if I really, really, really want to play the

283
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,580
Parker Posey level all the way back from little big planet one, or I want to play the Bobby

284
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,480
Black Wolf show advertisement level that he was showing off on his show tonight because

285
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,800
we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the

286
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,840
voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf

287
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
show.

288
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,960
I don't think I said that yet tonight, but he had his ad level that was in little big

289
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,120
planet one.

290
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,460
And I technically could still play that on my PS4 copy of a little big planet three,

291
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:47,140
but for how much long longer, you know, and it sounds like even then those servers were

292
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,360
down for a while while they tried to fix them.

293
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,480
And whatever they had to do to fix it, they couldn't even deploy to the old games because

294
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,960
there's no resources.

295
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
There's no money.

296
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
There's no time.

297
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,320
There's no all of the above.

298
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
Pretty much.

299
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,320
Yeah.

300
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,200
So some days it's a reminder someday, all of these things that we put into video games,

301
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,720
all of these cosmetics that we buy for video games will go away.

302
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,280
One of these days, all that money, dark soccer and I have spent on dead by daylight cosmetics

303
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
will be worth nothing.

304
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
They will go away.

305
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,020
You mean all the money I've spent on dead by daylight cosmetics, uh, for you or pillars

306
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,020
for you?

307
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:28,700
Well, I did buy all the steam stuff myself, but yes, my Xbox, my ground level support

308
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,700
was all you.

309
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,700
I bought you some steam.

310
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,060
Oh yeah, you did.

311
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,060
You did.

312
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,060
You did.

313
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,060
Did I buy you pig?

314
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,060
I think so.

315
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,620
Right when I was first getting on steam, but there was, there was a point where I bought

316
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,980
every single thing I was missing.

317
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,420
They were having like a 70% off.

318
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,720
I bought every single thing I was missing except for Ash from Evil Dead.

319
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,440
It's the one DLC I don't have cause I don't need it.

320
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,680
Well, his perks are shit and I don't really, I don't really, you really want to run metal

321
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,800
of man, Rob.

322
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
You really want it.

323
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,280
No, no, no I don't.

324
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
Anyway.

325
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:10,080
Um, I, I actually, uh, was in a match on someone doing adept Ash and when I realized it, I

326
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,040
felt so sorry for them.

327
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,740
I just let him go.

328
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,820
Mike Defton chat says, speaking of things not available now, four is the motorsport

329
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,820
seven.

330
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,820
I forgot to buy it.

331
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,820
Whoops.

332
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,300
Well, the good news is get it on disc because they can't take those away now.

333
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,820
I mean the online servers are down.

334
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,460
Uh, so you'll miss out on that part of it, but you can still play the base game if you

335
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,860
can find a disc somewhere.

336
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,580
Um, but yeah, as far as getting to play the version that comes with game pass, not, yeah,

337
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,460
that, that opportunity has gone on by and, and technically with little big plan and all

338
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:47,100
that stuff, you can still play the base games, um, because they're not online, but I mean

339
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,720
online was kind of the best part.

340
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,520
I mean, it's a, it's a decent platformer, especially the first one was pretty good.

341
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:58,020
Um, but you know, the best parts are online, uh, chewy two 40 and chat says, I like little

342
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,800
big planet, but now there's dreams, sack boy, et cetera.

343
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,500
You do make a good point with dreams.

344
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,220
Sack boy is kind of a different game with the same, like it's just a platformer.

345
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,560
There's not, not really the same user content, at least to my knowledge didn't really open

346
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,340
it up for user content the same way.

347
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,340
But dreams.

348
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,340
Yes.

349
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,880
That was very much like wide open.

350
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,120
And so yeah, dreams is definitely a thing still.

351
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,920
Um, but for how long wamp wamp, like it's just one of those things that we have to realize,

352
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,900
you know, one of these days, it's just, it's very possible.

353
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,200
It just disappears and that's it.

354
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,920
So wild stuff.

355
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,920
Yeah.

356
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
Indeed.

357
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,920
All right.

358
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,960
Well, let's talk about, Oh, go ahead.

359
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,120
I do want to give a shout out right now.

360
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,280
To, uh, another streamer puddings for happy birthday.

361
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,280
Oh yeah.

362
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,640
I caught a little bit of his birthday stream last night.

363
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
Happy birthday.

364
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:56,420
I, I made a pig card, but I figured a birthday shout out was, it was an order.

365
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,760
Let's move on to our gaming weeks and talk about the types of video games that we've

366
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,120
been playing this week.

367
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,080
And we'll go to our soccer first.

368
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:12,720
Dead by daylight, duh, and, uh, Fantasian, which, um, I, um, I got another boss battle

369
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,220
done one of the other quests and get more of my people back.

370
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,480
And I'm having a really good time with Fantasian.

371
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:27,040
This is, uh, uh, a really solid RPG with a really solid story and lots of room for me

372
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,300
to make fun of how stupid the characters can be sometimes.

373
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,760
Is part two, the last part, do we know?

374
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,760
Like honest question.

375
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
I don't know.

376
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:40,200
Part two, Rob is technically not a real part two.

377
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
It's an expansion of the first game.

378
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
Oh, interesting.

379
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
Okay.

380
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,580
So like when I load Fantasian, I am loading my current install.

381
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,580
It just updated.

382
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,580
Oh, okay.

383
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:58,920
And, uh, it was having some problems where like, um, it would like, I would be a boss

384
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:05,480
battle or some big battle and my game would freeze and that seems to have already been

385
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,480
patched out.

386
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,480
Um, there was another patch.

387
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,420
If anyone else is playing it, there's a patch that came out just the other day.

388
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:17,820
And also side note, if you have any, um, uh, Apple products update your operating system

389
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:24,840
now, if you haven't already, uh, uh, make sure your iPhones, iPads, whatever Mac all

390
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,840
up to date.

391
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,720
Uh, cause there was a, uh, a security breached from some Israeli spyware company.

392
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,000
And so that's been patched out.

393
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,380
Just, just putting the word out there, making sure people are in the know.

394
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,960
My sister texted me about that and I've never known her to be a tech person.

395
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,960
That was interesting.

396
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,680
She's like, did you update your phone?

397
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,520
It was pretty big.

398
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,520
It was pretty big deal.

399
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:53,080
Yeah, no, I, I then saw the, the stories on sites and things like that, but anyway, okay.

400
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,320
Well, and of course, if you have an Apple watch, once you update your phone, you have

401
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,320
to update your watch and everything.

402
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:05,680
So, um, but anyway, um, of course, uh, with those two, um, I've picked up, what was it

403
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,960
that I still don't remember that other game that I picked up, but, um, I want to sit down

404
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,720
and do slay the spire and I need to sit down with final fantasy 14 and actually, if I can

405
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,260
play the game, um, which I'm thinking about making that like a midweek stream, just like

406
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:27,340
an hour and a half of, uh, final fantasy, do something a little different, you know,

407
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:31,860
branch out, do the variety.

408
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,860
Who am I kidding?

409
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,860
I'm going to go back to dead by daylight.

410
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,860
Anyway.

411
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,860
All right.

412
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,860
Anything else for a game a week?

413
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,020
Um, Oh yeah.

414
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,020
Pinball.

415
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:49,780
Oh, we, we got our, um, our Metallica back.

416
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,820
And of course, uh, Dan's, uh, creature from the black lagoon is back and I played a little

417
00:19:53,820 --> 00:20:00,540
bit of it and, uh, so yeah, a little bit, a little bit pinball friend and for good measure.

418
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,540
All right.

419
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,340
A little bit of pinball is always good.

420
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,340
Uh, Loki, how about you?

421
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,780
How was your gaming week?

422
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,060
I didn't play a whole ton.

423
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:15,460
I played more Minecraft, put out new episode of, um, my series.

424
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,460
So that's out on YouTube.

425
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,460
Now.

426
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:24,420
Um, I did check out a little bit, uh, uh, cruise and blast on the switch, which it's,

427
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,500
it's all right.

428
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,900
It's not excite truck, but it's, you know, it's, it's, it's a cruise in game.

429
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,740
And the only complaint I would have with it, and I'm sure it's just intentional is that

430
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:41,740
it's, it's like someone took the game and bumped the saturation to like 20.

431
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:47,660
It's just like ridiculously garishly colorful, like to a point.

432
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:52,700
That's like actually irritating to look at, um, but aside from that though, my, my kids

433
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,700
like it.

434
00:20:53,700 --> 00:21:00,380
Uh, my son's already beat the game and unlocked everything, but, um, yeah, it's, it's, I was

435
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:06,860
hoping for like something that's kind of excite truck ish, but it's, it's, it's not, nothing

436
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,260
will ever capture my heart.

437
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,860
Like excite truck.

438
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:17,820
Oh, well maybe zero could, no, there's an F zero chance of that game ever happening

439
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,060
at this point, which is depressing, but reality.

440
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,060
Yeah.

441
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,360
So that, that's it.

442
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,220
That's all I really did this week.

443
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,220
Cool.

444
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,220
Um, my gaming week, uh, I didn't get around to buying the new warrior where I was kind

445
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,220
of surprised at myself, but still, uh, trucking along with some of the stuff that I've been

446
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,220
playing.

447
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:45,180
Uh, and then let's see, I also played some dead by daylight.

448
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:50,300
Oh, something I learned about that actually, that applies to lots of PC based games, uh,

449
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,180
or cause I'm playing on that platform.

450
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:57,500
Um, but worth explaining and, um, shout out to a streamer I watch a lot and I know he's

451
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:02,480
been here in chat before, uh, Tay from Tay plays games with the Y, um, he was talking

452
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,840
to me about the Nvidia settings, which I've never played with, but you have to have an

453
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,060
Nvidia graphics card.

454
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,880
I imagine there's gotta be a similar thing on the AMD side.

455
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,720
I'm not trying to be a graphics card fan boy.

456
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,720
Like Nvidia is just what I ended up with.

457
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,520
I do not have a particular brand loyalty in this whole thing.

458
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,360
I'm going to tell you, that was my last card.

459
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,060
I'm going to tell you what I learned for my device and I'm sure there's something similar

460
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,160
for the competition out there.

461
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,160
Okay.

462
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,680
But Nvidia has this thing called the G force experience, which I've, I've not really played

463
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,160
around with a lot because it has like an in-game thing and I've always kind of ignored

464
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,740
it because my assumption was I probably slows the game down.

465
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,360
I'm just going to not load it and sideload it or whatever.

466
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,060
But Tay was telling me that you can actually really apply some filters in that, that really

467
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,680
make your game look a lot better.

468
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,000
And I've always noticed when he's streaming, I'm always like, your game looks a little

469
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,640
bit sharper than most people I see streaming Dead by Daylight and it's this Nvidia thing.

470
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:01,400
So I just throwing it out there, if you are an Nvidia person and you've never played around

471
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:09,280
with the G force thing, take a look at it because there's some valuable sliders in there.

472
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,080
You go into, you load the experience and then you hit the alt Z to access it and there's

473
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,920
like a filter mode.

474
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,600
I think you can hit alt F3 to access it directly.

475
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,360
And you can actually, it's like, like on your TV, you adjust the brightness, contrast, sharpness,

476
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,800
but you can change some other things too.

477
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,760
And I actually got my Dead by Daylight game to look quite a bit better thanks to that

478
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,760
tip.

479
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
So shout out to Tay.

480
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:41,920
I did that on my PC before with, when I was playing, I mean, gosh, it was my card before

481
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,960
that, but it was also a G force.

482
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,000
And I had to do a little bit of tweaking like that for when I ran the high res mods for

483
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Mass Effect.

484
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yeah.

485
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah.

486
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Yeah.

487
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,560
And Tiger Claw also brings out, G force experience has a feature that will optimize the games

488
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,000
to run better based on the GPU that you have.

489
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,920
Also not every single game is supported on it.

490
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,920
Um, yes, that's true.

491
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:08,480
And I actually, that feature I have used before, but I've also found that it doesn't always

492
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,760
optimize performance versus frames.

493
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,520
You have to manually go in there when you're going to optimize, you hit the little wrench

494
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,280
and you kind of bring it down a little bit so that you do get a little, cause I prefer

495
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:25,520
frames actually over, uh, I am all for the extra frames, save the animals.

496
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,360
I want extra frames because it's a smooth, smooth experience.

497
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,200
Um, so, uh, yeah, so I prefer performance.

498
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,240
Um, but, and you, I have found in my experience that that thing prefers quality, which I mean,

499
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,240
I get it.

500
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,240
It's a video card.

501
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,240
They want to show off, but just kind of keep that in the back of your mind.

502
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,880
Fifth dream in our chat at twitch.tv slash vog network says I use the filters all the

503
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,880
time.

504
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,320
At minimum, it helps with gamma and color adjustments, but you really can get in there.

505
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:01,360
I've made fallout look like borderlands, lol, yeah, like, and honestly, um, go on places

506
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,840
like Reddit that have people that are posting their specs.

507
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,600
Tay just screenshotted all his settings and put it in his discord.

508
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,640
So I just copied everything he had, but I started cause I was like, Oh, if there's this,

509
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,920
I wonder what there is for final fantasy 14, another PC game I play a lot of.

510
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,640
And uh, I went to go look that up and there were some ideas and thoughts with how to make

511
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,640
that game look better.

512
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,760
So, um, the internet, it's a big resource.

513
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,760
Use it.

514
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,280
Uh, that being said, I also played a little bit of final fantasy 14 this week.

515
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,040
Um, just because with the big patch stream that happened this week, we'll talk about

516
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,320
that later in the show.

517
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,480
It made me go, Oh yeah, I gotta, I gotta get some shit done before end Walker.

518
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,680
Um, and I got my monk to 60, which means every class is at least 60.

519
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,680
Every class has beaten heaven's word in that regard.

520
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,920
Now I just need to get everything to 80, but I only have three classes left to go.

521
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,920
So I'll get there.

522
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,920
I'll get there before the expansion.

523
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,080
Uh, and then quickly on the dead by daylight front, since dark soccer, you brought up a

524
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,520
depths earlier.

525
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,240
I got adept tap, uh, of all characters.

526
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,240
I'm just ranting.

527
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,240
Interesting.

528
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,240
Well, there's survivors.

529
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,240
He's got good perks.

530
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,240
He does have good perks.

531
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,120
And I really want, so, you know, Chris is my main in dead by daylight, right?

532
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,340
And in dead by daylight, you get the, um, you have to play other survivors to a certain

533
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,380
level to get their perks, to show up in all the survivors, blood trees.

534
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,700
And that's how you level them.

535
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,900
So the one I just did was ACE.

536
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,180
I did ACE Visconti.

537
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:31,260
Um, I'll say it was for my husband, but it actually wasn't.

538
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:36,340
I wanted that perk open-handed that increases your aura readings because, uh, Kindred plus

539
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:41,960
open-handed and solo queue, beautiful, beautiful, uh, combo of perks for survivors.

540
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,960
For the record.

541
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,960
Hmm.

542
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
I did a thing.

543
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,100
Oh, did you play survivor of the first time finally?

544
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,460
No, but I put points in Meg.

545
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,500
Oh, you're preparing.

546
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,500
You're preparing.

547
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,620
I'm preparing.

548
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,660
So I have to take a little side route cause, uh, you know, Finara, right?

549
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,660
My friend.

550
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,660
Yeah.

551
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,940
Um, I'm planning on doing a little TikTok series.

552
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:09,620
That's basically just like a bunch of Mimi stuff with, uh, with pig and Meg and David.

553
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,200
Okay.

554
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,420
And so we've been talking about, uh, like getting everything together and doing it.

555
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:21,100
And I figured, well, if I'm going to have, you know, cause I might have to do survivor

556
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,700
in a custom.

557
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:30,220
So I figured I'm actually going to learn survivor on, on, as I call her, the Meglet.

558
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:37,820
And uh, rather than just use all of my survivors as a, as a, excuse me, as a fashion show.

559
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,820
Okay.

560
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,180
Serena's new outfits though.

561
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,180
Oh my God.

562
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,180
All right.

563
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,180
But, um, yes.

564
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,660
It's iconic.

565
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:50,820
So yes, I got, um, so after I was done with this, I went to tap because I want his, um,

566
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,540
the, the, the, the thing that shows you the auras of all the totems and the gens every

567
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,540
time a gen pops, it's great for comboing with a map.

568
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:01,100
Um, what about using that with Jill's totem perk?

569
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,240
Uh, honestly, yes.

570
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:09,400
And you, I think that his, uh, perk is better than Jill's perk, but if you have a map, either

571
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
are effective.

572
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
Gotcha.

573
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
I have a hard time.

574
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,860
I mean, usually when I see a tap in the game, I'm just like, oh, he's going to be up to

575
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,860
shit.

576
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:22,300
You know, if, if I'm in a game that I've got, uh, like ruin or something going live in,

577
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,380
I usually go after tap first.

578
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,500
Tap also has that great ability.

579
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,500
Sorry.

580
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,020
I won't go too far down the DVD, but Hey, we spend a lot of time on it, but this real

581
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,420
quick note, it's only a mass effect.

582
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:37,220
Has that great ability where he can crawl while he's charging his meter.

583
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,860
That's pretty odd, but it's, it's a little bit situational, but in a lot of games I've

584
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,420
played, that's a, that's a clutch ability if, uh, you're running it, which, you know,

585
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:49,380
that's the hardest part of Dead by Daylight is which four perks do you pick?

586
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,140
I get a little worried when I see a tap in a match.

587
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:57,380
Um, uh, well he, he is the, he is the pig's antithesis.

588
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:06,140
So it's, it's appropriate for you to not like tap on just on principle.

589
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,140
For the record.

590
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,380
I have been sharing the gospel of resident pig goo and the alternate version silent pig

591
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,380
goo.

592
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,380
Yes.

593
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,660
Your, your build that, uh, consumes people with the traps.

594
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,660
Very easy.

595
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,660
Yes.

596
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,660
I know.

597
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,660
Isn't it great?

598
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,660
Y'all.

599
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,660
Y'all.

600
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,660
Um, I know dark soccer talks a lot about dead by daylight on this show.

601
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:27,860
It is like she said, it's the new mass effect, but y'all don't understand.

602
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,860
It doesn't matter.

603
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,860
Like, and I don't know.

604
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,860
I don't know how she does it.

605
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,500
You guys, I will go into a random person.

606
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,500
I follow that.

607
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,660
I'm just watching play dead by daylight and I'm like, Hey, how's it going?

608
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,860
And it'll be immediately like before the streamer even sees it suddenly dark soccer.

609
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:48,540
OLR says, Rob, Rob, stop following me, Rob, you say the same thing to me.

610
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,540
I do.

611
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,540
I do.

612
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:55,740
It's, it's a love fest, but I think you name check Putin's earlier.

613
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,380
I think he finds it funny.

614
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,060
So yeah, put, put, put in things is really funny.

615
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,300
I mean, he's, he's just adorable anyway.

616
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,060
And I think we've done it in Nick's chat a couple of times too.

617
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,060
Yeah.

618
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,820
I've been in random people's chats and you're there somehow.

619
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,580
I'm like, does she have four windows open?

620
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,580
How does she do it?

621
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,700
Well, I'll sometimes make it into somebody's chat on a raid.

622
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:21,620
Like when I've been off doing something else and I'll be like, Oh, new person, follow Rob,

623
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,820
which for the record, I'm actually really jealous of Nick right now because he's in

624
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,820
Cabo.

625
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,820
Oh, is that where he went?

626
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,820
I knew it was on the case.

627
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,820
All right.

628
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,640
Anyway, look, I want to go jealous.

629
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,640
We need to go to it.

630
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,740
We need to take an LA trip less.

631
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,860
I am taking an LA trip actually.

632
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,860
I just take me.

633
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:40,180
In fact, I have to tell you guys, I'm not going to be here the last weekend of October

634
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:45,020
because here's the thing, look, I know, I know you're going to understand dark Sakura

635
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,100
and Loki, you'll be fine with it.

636
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,720
I haven't seen Victoria in like a long time and her birthday's at the end of October.

637
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,740
For those of you that listen to shaking and crying back in the day.

638
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:58,960
So I was like, Victoria, I'm coming down to Southern California and she's like, yes.

639
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,740
So that, that's the thing that's going to happen.

640
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,740
Absolutely.

641
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:07,360
So speaking of friends, before we get into some gaming news tonight, I wanted to give

642
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,300
a shout out to a dragon con friend of mine and a Kickstarter that they are doing.

643
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:18,380
And I said, you know, usually I'm a little with plugging Kickstarters, but I know the

644
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:23,120
person behind this one, so I know it will be something that's going to be a huge success

645
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,720
and it's not quite video games.

646
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,360
It's a little bit different, but I think it's still adjacent.

647
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,640
It's a gaming type.

648
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,840
So I want to give a plug.

649
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,880
This is one of the creators of botched, which is a D and D podcast who is doing a Kickstarter.

650
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,560
It's about the story of Solomon, a man from a time long forgotten, thrust into responsibility.

651
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,420
He must decide how far he's willing to go in order to protect those he cares about.

652
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:49,380
The consequences of desperate decisions leads to the world's first werewolf.

653
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:55,060
This is lichen Solomon's Odyssey, a fully illustrated 60 page graphic novel.

654
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,120
The first in an ongoing series.

655
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,360
If you're interested in supporting a project more than 10 years in the making, you can

656
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:08,520
search for lichen, L-Y-C-A-N, Solomon's Odyssey on Kickstarter or head over to www.hiveheadstudios.com

657
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:13,920
or even clockfox.net because Dennis has some really weird patrons.

658
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,760
The project is already over 50% funded in its first week.

659
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,200
I think it's on like week three now.

660
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,200
I haven't checked in.

661
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,320
It's probably already funded by this point, but I wanted to make sure I gave Dennis and

662
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,440
that Kickstarter again.

663
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,360
It's lichen Solomon's Odyssey, a shout out right here on OLR.

664
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,360
So let's move on.

665
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,080
We got some other gaming news to get into.

666
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,400
Let's start with Loki and gaming news.

667
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,480
Yeah.

668
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:44,860
So Gran Turismo 7 is confirmed to be always online.

669
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,560
So that was something that was kind of shown off a little bit earlier this week.

670
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:54,880
And then, yeah, so that that's a nice piece considering how stable all of our internets

671
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,180
are.

672
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,960
And eventually, you know, it just may not work at all.

673
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:05,300
But yeah, so it's going to be basically unplayable if you drop the Internet because of all the

674
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,720
online features and anti-cheat that they have going on with it.

675
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:18,240
But apparently, you know, they had some questions regarding this decision, obviously, and why

676
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,920
they went ahead and did that.

677
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:26,580
He said the online connection won't be necessary for arcade mode because it doesn't impact

678
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,420
your game save file.

679
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:32,800
But anything else like the online connection is required for the campaign mode.

680
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,240
The only part of the game that doesn't require online connection is the arcade mode because

681
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,540
it has no effect on your save data.

682
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,680
So that's possible.

683
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,960
But anything that has to do with save data requires a connection.

684
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:48,180
For example, delivery, like delivery data, as well as something that's downloaded from

685
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:53,420
an online server.

686
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:59,940
I hate these kind of like always online games, but you don't know that going in, I guess.

687
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,420
Well, here's Yeah, no, no, what you're getting into.

688
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,500
That's the most important thing.

689
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,960
But I've got to be honest, ever since Diablo three in 2006, and the beginning of this whole

690
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:13,200
debate with the always online thing, and I not to completely compare the two because

691
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,580
Diablo three had that whole trash real money store that they ended up getting rid of and

692
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,620
all that stuff anyway.

693
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:23,100
But it definitely was the catalyst for the really the first time I think the always online

694
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,640
debate was really starting.

695
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,620
And now here we are what like 15 years later, has it been 15 years since Diablo three's

696
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,620
been out?

697
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:35,780
I remember I remember was it SimCity it's impossible to run this without it being connected

698
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,780
online.

699
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:42,500
Oh, yeah, that was like, it's like no, no, that was a big lie.

700
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:51,540
Um, yeah, you know, right now, it's basically, you know, to ward off cheaters, I guess.

701
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:59,060
Because you know, as a person that plays video games, there is no cheating in it online games.

702
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:03,920
It is a place where cheaters just haven't been able to penetrate that game we never

703
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,900
shut up about dead by daylight.

704
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:11,020
There's cheaters in matches and what dark soccer surely never come across any of those.

705
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,420
There's no cheaters.

706
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:18,160
It's online online, it has to be online because otherwise cheating is possible.

707
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:24,300
I mean, that is obviously means that there's no cheating online.

708
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:29,900
I mean, clearly, this is the world we live in where it is impossible.

709
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:35,280
It is just a fact that this is stupid and I really wish they wouldn't do this.

710
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,740
But I don't care because I don't have a PlayStation five.

711
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,980
I wouldn't be buying this game anyways, because I don't really like simulation racing games.

712
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,940
Okay, okay, but you say you don't care because it's not my thing until it is your thing and

713
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,340
then you're gonna care.

714
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,340
Because this is the way the end.

715
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,500
And this is what I really want to talk about is I feel like this is the way the industry

716
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,740
is going.

717
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,180
As much as we do not like these always online things.

718
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,100
I don't know, I'm a little bit torn.

719
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,980
Like of course, there's things about it I don't like because I feel like internet connections

720
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,580
aren't and from my perspective, it's because internet connections aren't always stable

721
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,680
internet gets knocked offline.

722
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:13,600
Not a lot of games respond well to losing internet for even a couple seconds.

723
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,360
Like when the game can handle losing internet for five minutes or so I'm a little more open

724
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,360
to it.

725
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,880
But you know how some games like the second you lose internet, it's like kicked out to

726
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,340
the title screen, which is ridiculous.

727
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,600
But I feel like it's inevitable.

728
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,000
This is where the industry is going.

729
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,860
And it's in a way it's because of cheaters.

730
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:35,240
And I think it's because and yes, Loki, I know you say that tongue in cheek like what

731
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,520
there's no cheaters.

732
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,580
But it does seem like there's a lot less of them when the game is always online.

733
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:45,120
I feel like, like whether we like it or not, this is where the industry is going to end

734
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:51,240
up is always online, especially as more, especially when we start getting rid of the wires with

735
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
the internet.

736
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,420
And that's going to happen in 10 years.

737
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,240
I've said that before on this show.

738
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:01,560
By the time we're in our 50s doing this show, the internet is going to completely be wireless.

739
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,640
It's going to be 5g and all that stuff.

740
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,160
And there's not even going to be the wires anymore with it.

741
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:12,000
And when it's internet is literally like everywhere.

742
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,900
It's going to be that they're going to put the games online.

743
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,720
And I know everybody's going to have the what about scenario?

744
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,780
What about this rural part of the country?

745
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,760
What about this particular, you know, place in another country that doesn't have a stable

746
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,760
internet stretch?

747
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:30,000
I'm going to tell you as hard as it is to hear, there's going to come a time when PlayStation,

748
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,720
Microsoft, all these companies are going to run the numbers and they're going to say,

749
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:41,000
well, you know what, we can make this always online and we might be putting 2.78% of gamers

750
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,460
at risk.

751
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,760
We're just going to have to write them off.

752
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,820
They'll just get Jay Allard to come out there and he'll say, hey, have you considered living

753
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,660
in a place that has internet?

754
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,920
I mean, come on.

755
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,480
So yeah, I get that.

756
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,540
And I get where they want to go with that.

757
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,860
And a lot of people's internet is okay.

758
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,820
It's not our internet that I'm worried about.

759
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:07,840
It's their internet, their stupid servers that I'm, I would think is the most unreliable

760
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,680
part of the whole thing.

761
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,940
I mean, you know, when people were trying to connect to Diablo 3, it wasn't that our

762
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,160
internet sucked.

763
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,360
It was that their servers suck because they cheap out on servers or they do these scalable

764
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,320
server thing that can't keep up with the demand for the game.

765
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:31,900
So I just don't trust game industry, the game industry as a whole, I guess is really what

766
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,680
it is.

767
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,920
Yeah, I mean, I understand the, I guess pessimism.

768
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,040
I don't know what else to call it, but I get it.

769
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:46,740
Like the game industry has definitely shown that they will use these things for more like

770
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,080
selfish related purposes and so forth.

771
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,040
And they want it to be always online so they can push more loot boxes and that sort of

772
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,040
thing.

773
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,560
Let's get that roadmap for our service stability.

774
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,880
I can't wait.

775
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,880
Sorry.

776
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,820
We've heard your feedback and, and we're going to really try to make our service better.

777
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,940
Here's a roadmap of like where we're going to go with that.

778
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:14,260
And yeah, play your role, Sony.

779
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,900
You've heard your feedback and chosen to ignore it.

780
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,460
Here's, here's the thing though.

781
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,660
Like I've got to be honest though.

782
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:25,940
Oh, I don't know about you guys, but like most of the games I play right now are always

783
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,620
online and I've come to accept that.

784
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,360
Final Fantasy 14, MMO, of course is always online.

785
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,360
Dead by Daylight, Competitive Gaming, of course is always online and those are two of my biggest

786
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,360
time scenes.

787
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,740
Cookie Clicker has, no, okay, Cookie Clicker is offline now with us on Steam.

788
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:44,720
But there's, you know, more and more games I feel like I'm playing that kind of are always

789
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,360
online and I've just kind of come to accept it.

790
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:54,320
But I guess on the other hand, you have the Nintendo Switch and insert LOL Nintendo online

791
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,180
joke here.

792
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:00,240
But there's also the fact that that magical world I talked about where wireless internet

793
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,240
is everywhere.

794
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,400
We don't live in it yet.

795
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,320
And so the Switch being a portable system, the games on that system kind of can't be

796
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:14,480
always online unless it is, you know, a backbone of the game, ie Pokemon Unite, let's say.

797
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,140
You expect that's going to be always online because again, competitive game.

798
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:24,000
You're playing online with others, but that, that system kind of can't do this yet.

799
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,700
So Quest Buster in chat says hugs Switch.

800
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:35,140
Yes, it's interesting how sometimes the Switch lagging behind is actually a benefit to them.

801
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,140
It is never a benefit to them.

802
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,540
We just give them such a pass because we like their games.

803
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,540
It is not a benefit.

804
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:46,860
They're, they're, they're starting to go towards an evil company type of route.

805
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,860
Yeah.

806
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,860
They make good games.

807
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,860
Okay.

808
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,300
There's lots of people that like games from Activision and stuff like that.

809
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:56,760
And some of their games are okay, but we give them such a pass for all this stupid

810
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,820
bullshit that they do because of their stupid online service and stuff.

811
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,820
It sucks ass.

812
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,820
Okay.

813
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,820
There we go.

814
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,820
It sucks.

815
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,820
It is pathetic.

816
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:11,320
If it was anybody else with that online service, if Microsoft had their online service, we

817
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,920
would be bitching and moaning about their shit.

818
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,080
So give it up for Nintendo.

819
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,080
You fucking idiots.

820
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:22,040
They can't get your shit right for like decades now.

821
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:26,180
I feel like you would give me a new goddamn Mario Odyssey game.

822
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,180
Don't mince words.

823
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,180
Tell us how you, how you really feel.

824
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,420
I feel like you're upset.

825
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,420
Loki.

826
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,420
Do you need to know?

827
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,780
I'm just, I don't really care.

828
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,580
Like honestly, like it's just, they're not going to, they're going to do whatever they

829
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,580
want.

830
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,380
They're going to put out their switch, a letter, whatever.

831
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:42,740
They're not really going to address the issues for like their, their services.

832
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,100
There's going to be third party companies that do their games better than them.

833
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,700
Like we have with the Nickelodeon all star stuff where their net code is better.

834
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,700
Okay.

835
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,700
That game's not out yet though.

836
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,360
Hold up.

837
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,360
Hold up.

838
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,360
Do not put that game on a pedestal because we saw how PlayStation all stars was kind

839
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,360
of mad.

840
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:02,160
I will, you know what, we'll give it a few weeks to see, you know, that they've done

841
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,160
it better.

842
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,160
I hope it is good.

843
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,160
Like, don't get me wrong.

844
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
I am rooting for that game.

845
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,400
Uh, and let, I, except I don't think we're going to get moose from, you can't do that

846
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,600
on television as a playable character, so I'm a little upset about that, but I'll still

847
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,600
support the game.

848
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,740
Maybe there's DLC.

849
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,040
Whatever happened to Christine?

850
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:24,700
Um, is it weird that I think I know, I think I fell on down a Wikipedia black hole when

851
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,340
I, she's like a TV producer now.

852
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:30,540
It's like what a lot of like child actors end up being TV producers and I think she's

853
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,540
one of them.

854
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:39,900
So anyway, uh, going in chat because Loki's Christine McGlade founder, uh, Loki's little

855
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,140
uh, tirade, uh, ended up getting some chat comments.

856
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:48,820
Uh, Mike Defton chat says being honest, Nintendo has always been an evil company, uh, fifth

857
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:54,840
dream says, uh, Loki's had a past with Nintendo and feels jilted, uh, dark to try their games.

858
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,880
Like I don't, it's just like, let's be honest here.

859
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,880
Like, yeah.

860
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,880
Okay.

861
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,100
We like their games, but their online service is garbage.

862
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,100
It is garbage.

863
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,100
Yeah.

864
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:08,880
Like, like just now, like, Oh, Hey, we, we're bringing you brand new features to our console

865
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,200
that everybody has had for decades now.

866
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,600
It's like, come on.

867
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,600
Yeah.

868
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,500
I mean like, I, I agree.

869
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:20,440
I don't maybe agree as passionately as Loki does, but there's an extent where I go, yes,

870
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,400
Nintendo makes some of the greatest games in the industry.

871
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,240
Like period Mario Odyssey, uh, Zelda, breath of the wild, uh, you know, the list goes on

872
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,560
at a smash brothers.

873
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,640
Um, the, the list goes on and on.

874
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,440
Nintendo makes the greatest games in the industry.

875
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,720
And I think that's why we all sit here going.

876
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,920
These games that are a 10 could be an 11 or a 12 if they would just stop dropping the

877
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,040
ball on online.

878
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:49,540
But it's this weird thing where it's like, Nintendo does what they want to do with online

879
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,420
and it works for them.

880
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:56,740
As much as we get frustrated, seeing the potential, they, they see that potential and they say,

881
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,740
we don't want it.

882
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,740
And they did.

883
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,740
It's their minimum.

884
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:03,840
They did the, they're doing like the absolute bare minimum.

885
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,840
That's the price.

886
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,420
If the sales, you know what they're doing really well with online is they're harassing

887
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,480
their stupid community with all of the fan.

888
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,500
Like I want to show you that I love your series.

889
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,500
So now I'm going to get a cease and desist for it.

890
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,500
You know what?

891
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,900
Like treat your fans with some goddamn respect for one.

892
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,900
How about that?

893
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,900
Nintendo?

894
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:27,200
Like, I don't know, whatever they're going to do, whatever they want, we're just going

895
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,200
to buy their games.

896
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,860
So let's call it in, call it back.

897
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,960
Let's move on to our next topic, Loki.

898
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,200
What about all the good things Nintendo has done?

899
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,420
And here's one that Nintendo did.

900
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,580
And it's not like it was what, like three or four years late to the party or anything

901
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:42,580
like that.

902
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:45,680
However, now, Loki, are you going to, are you going to acknowledge this?

903
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,820
Are we going to get a woo-hoo, a thumbs up, a gold star?

904
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,820
Nintendo has-

905
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:53,480
So can I voice chat in games now without having to have a separate app on my phone?

906
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,520
That separate app is Discord, yes.

907
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:02,360
Nintendo has finally added Bluetooth audio to the Switch.

908
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,360
That's right.

909
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,920
You can now use, for example, I don't know if you've noticed, those that are watching

910
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,920
on Twitch.

911
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:11,420
I'm sorry to the podcast crowd, but those that watch on Twitch probably subtly notice

912
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:16,380
I have these little devices in my ear, and this allows me to hear Dark Sakura and Loki

913
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:21,300
in my ear, because the TV is not really the best audio sometimes during the show that

914
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,020
we had when we were in person.

915
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:28,380
So these little earbuds that I have allow me to hear, and it's a Bluetooth connection

916
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:33,920
to my phone, which also sits on Discord with all of us when we're doing the show.

917
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,860
My point is, I can finally use these little Bluetooth AirPod headphones on my Nintendo

918
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:39,860
Switch.

919
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,300
I'm surprised they didn't charge you for that feature.

920
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,100
Like seriously, it's just, it's stupid.

921
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:49,660
That would have been funny if it was a Nintendo online subscription thing, right in time for

922
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:50,660
the renewals to come up.

923
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,660
They probably wanted to.

924
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:55,420
All right, but it's not, just to be clear, it is not a pay thing.

925
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,680
It is part of the latest Switch update.

926
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,220
You can now use Bluetooth devices for audio output.

927
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,580
Nintendo does say there may be some latency.

928
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:07,880
So I wouldn't use this to play your music games, but hooray, this feature's finally

929
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,180
here.

930
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:15,560
To make it work, make sure that no more than two wireless controllers are currently connected.

931
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:19,220
It's too much for the system to handle if you have more than two.

932
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:23,760
By the way, a pair of Joy-Cons is two.

933
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,700
So you may use, Loki, that's one pair of Joy-Con controllers and wireless audio.

934
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:35,660
So if you want to play a game with two players, with four pairs, two pair, four Joy-Con, no

935
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,660
Bluetooth audio for you.

936
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,660
Number two.

937
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:44,820
No, no, Loki, I'm not finished.

938
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:48,440
Turn on your Bluetooth device and set it to searchable.

939
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:53,520
And then from the home menu, open system settings, scroll down to Bluetooth audio and select

940
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,780
pair.

941
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,900
Number five, select your Bluetooth audio device when it's found.

942
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:02,800
And six, once connected, any audio that is played will be output through your Bluetooth

943
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,100
device.

944
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:07,380
Be sure to adjust the system volume to a comfortable level.

945
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:14,540
So pairing additional controllers will require you to disconnect a Bluetooth audio device.

946
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:21,660
And you can pair one Bluetooth audio device at a time, but up to 10 can be saved on a

947
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:22,660
switch.

948
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:26,660
I don't know who has 10 pair of Bluetooth audio around their house, but there you go.

949
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,140
Loki, any thoughts?

950
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,220
It's so stupid.

951
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:32,220
It is.

952
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:36,500
It's just so stupid.

953
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,500
Let's see.

954
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:43,420
DJ Rama S says there's a reason why Sony and Microsoft don't support Bluetooth audio.

955
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:44,420
What is?

956
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:48,060
I'm actually curious what that reason is.

957
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:51,980
Tiger Claw says if you want to use four controllers but need Bluetooth audio, you can just buy

958
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:54,940
a portable Bluetooth transmitter.

959
00:47:54,940 --> 00:48:00,300
You want to get to the headphone jack of the switch and then play your Bluetooth device

960
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,540
to pair, I think is the word, pair your Bluetooth device to it.

961
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,740
I didn't even think of that as a workaround.

962
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:10,620
I bet that does have lag though, but that does work.

963
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:13,700
Tiger Claw's got an interesting solution there.

964
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:18,500
And I get it, where people want their, honestly, I think the best solution so far has been

965
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:22,340
what Microsoft and Sony have done with their controllers, where they have headphone jacks

966
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,340
in the controllers.

967
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:27,180
I mean, because that just works perfectly for me because the controller is wireless.

968
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:30,540
I just pop in, you know, my headphones and that's that.

969
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:36,460
If I have wireless headphones, then, you know, I use different headphones.

970
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:40,100
I don't know, whatever.

971
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,100
Good job, Nintendo.

972
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,100
At least you supported it, I guess, even though that's really crap.

973
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,900
Boy, oh boy.

974
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,020
All right.

975
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,300
So there you go.

976
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:55,020
Nintendo has finally caught up with the Bluetooth and now you can use AirPods, et cetera, but

977
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:58,420
not all Bluetooth audio as pointed out in our chat.

978
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:59,420
Can you do that?

979
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:03,020
It almost sounds like that they need a more powerful console to be able to do all these

980
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:08,020
features like that they should have, I don't know, put a little bit of oomph under the

981
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,900
engine there that that console has been running there because it sounds like it can't handle

982
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,780
half of the stuff they're trying to throw at it.

983
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:20,700
Jijirama S says lag and latency is the reason Sony and Microsoft use RF for wireless audio

984
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,420
or something along those lines.

985
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:26,020
I swear I have a PlayStation 4 headset.

986
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,700
I swore that was a Bluetooth headset.

987
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:34,220
It's Wi-Fi direct, I think, if I remember correctly, basically, if they connect via

988
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:38,700
Wi-Fi to your console as like your console is almost like a hotspot.

989
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:44,580
And so it does it that way, which is fine, you know, I guess I could do that.

990
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:50,220
But I don't know, like there are so many better options.

991
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,060
All right, let's move on.

992
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:59,540
We're going to go to our next story, Dark Sakura.

993
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:04,540
It would help if I would actually if it would unmute when I hit the button anyway.

994
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:07,780
It's just lagged like Nintendo's audio.

995
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,900
Speaking of audio.

996
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:19,420
So there was actually a report put out by Billboard that Twitch and the National Music

997
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:26,880
Publishers Association, the NMPA, are going to be signing a music agreement that would

998
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:33,420
basically end the DMCA nonsense going on with Twitch.

999
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:41,940
Basically, you know, Twitch was taking down streams, taking down channels for DMCA copyright,

1000
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:50,300
which also along the same lines is what led to me making my own music for my channel.

1001
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:55,780
You know, a lot of people, when they play music on there, they'll have the VOD excluded,

1002
00:50:55,780 --> 00:51:02,140
you know, which I can't do the way I have to route my sounds through my Mac.

1003
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:09,020
But basically, they're thinking that it could be announced by the end of this month, September.

1004
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,780
But we're going to wait and see.

1005
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:17,140
But basically, they've been trying to get this together for some time and we might finally

1006
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,140
see fruition.

1007
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:21,660
I just hope that it works out better.

1008
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:22,660
Yeah.

1009
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:26,460
And as far as I know, even if this were to go through, we here at VOG Network aren't

1010
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:31,700
really going to change our policy of relying on Dark Sakura custom creations, slash overclocked

1011
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:36,980
remix, you know, things where we know we have the blanket license to use them on the network.

1012
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:42,540
However, it might make us a little more open to, okay, we can play a video game trailer

1013
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:47,140
that has licensed music in it because we won't get sued to oblivion for playing the trailer.

1014
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,500
So that would be a nice welcome to that.

1015
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,500
Exactly.

1016
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:56,140
And I mean, it would be nice just to play, like, some ambient tunes in the background,

1017
00:51:56,140 --> 00:52:06,060
you know, like I would like I would like to do the ambient music ASMR fake match because

1018
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:09,020
I hate ASMR and my version would just be me.

1019
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:17,700
So I just hit this person and they're an asshole because everyone wants to hear me complain

1020
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,860
in a really smooth voice.

1021
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,180
I think that'd be hilarious.

1022
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:26,460
I am here to ruin your day and you're going to go up on the hook of shame.

1023
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:27,460
Death hook.

1024
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:30,220
Oh, oh, my gosh.

1025
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:33,660
You know, it's actually kind of funny hearing, like, just things that I've randomly come

1026
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:37,700
up with being spoken by other people.

1027
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:42,780
If people would actually buy my Death Hook for Cutie shirt, I would be happy.

1028
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:50,620
But I would think, like, it would be like, so we're here trying to get boobs and no one

1029
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,660
has yet booped my snoot.

1030
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:56,660
Therefore, you all die.

1031
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,660
Growl.

1032
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:01,980
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, O-L-R-N-P-R, no, I don't think I don't think we would change

1033
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:05,540
the hosting of our show, but maybe we could do a channel point reward or so.

1034
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:06,540
We haven't had one of those in a while.

1035
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:07,540
We need to get those back on track.

1036
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:11,660
We'll do a channel point reward where we do an NPR style news show or something.

1037
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:13,660
It might be fun.

1038
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:14,660
OPR.

1039
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:15,660
OPR.

1040
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,220
That's actually really funny.

1041
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,820
I kind of like that idea.

1042
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:19,820
All right.

1043
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:23,180
Sia Tabiri in chat says, I'm sorry, next paycheck comes this week.

1044
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,900
I just spent all my money at Dollywood.

1045
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,100
So jealous of your life, Sia Tabiri.

1046
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,100
So, so jealous of your life.

1047
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,100
I'm so upset.

1048
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,100
I'm so upset.

1049
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,580
Thank you for putting money in St. Dolly's pockets.

1050
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:33,900
No, I'm just kidding.

1051
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:37,020
I'm only saying that out of complete and utter jealousy.

1052
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,020
Dollywood is on my bucket list of places to go.

1053
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,020
That's for sure.

1054
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,020
Anyway.

1055
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:43,140
All right, let's move on.

1056
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,140
We have more stuff.

1057
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:47,180
I do hope the Twitch music licensing thing does happen.

1058
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:51,500
I think, you know, it'll be it'll just be it'll just be a good thing to like not have

1059
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:55,580
all these random DMCA things going around and especially like the false positives are

1060
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:56,580
super annoying.

1061
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:00,140
And we're always kind of like on edge, like I was kind of referencing, you know, Vogue

1062
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:01,140
Network.

1063
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:05,900
We don't really play licensed music, but we're really nervous sometimes about playing, you

1064
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:09,700
know, news related things because it might even have just a little bit of sound.

1065
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,980
And then, oh, false positive.

1066
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:12,980
We got a strike.

1067
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,980
This is very silly.

1068
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:17,060
All right.

1069
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:18,060
Let's move on.

1070
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,060
Loki.

1071
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,060
Oh, this.

1072
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:22,060
Oh, let's let's visit some old friends with this story.

1073
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,060
Yes.

1074
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,060
Yes.

1075
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,060
No, no.

1076
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,060
Wait.

1077
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:27,060
Okay.

1078
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,060
I know.

1079
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,060
Yes.

1080
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,060
You already said who they are.

1081
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:31,060
But yes, these are old friends.

1082
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:34,500
But these are old friends were like, you really lost touch over the last 15 years and your

1083
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,180
lives were in very different directions.

1084
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:43,620
And like this friend Konami in this place, like they found they fell into a pit of despair.

1085
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:47,860
Like they've been they're not holding down a job for very long.

1086
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:51,460
They allegedly may have gotten into some drugs.

1087
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:57,020
They have not had any stability in their life whatsoever.

1088
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,020
They're there.

1089
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,020
They have a rough life.

1090
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:04,560
And so when we're checking in on our friend, it's kind of like one of those the potential

1091
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:12,740
the potential this friend of ours could have had a last anyway, what are they up to?

1092
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:17,540
Yeah, they're killing off their Pro Evolution soccer franchise are winning 11 as it's still

1093
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:19,080
in Japan.

1094
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:26,100
And instead, out of its huss, comes the football I wrote now that that's been out there I remember

1095
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:32,140
talking about football and thinking, Whoa, I mean, I guess I get that maybe not everybody

1096
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,680
understands winning 11.

1097
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,380
But I thought the franchise sold pretty well.

1098
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:40,520
I don't understand why they needed Okay, well, now it's football.

1099
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,320
So E football is a free to play game.

1100
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:49,980
And with that available now on the PlayStation and Microsoft storefronts, you can now pre

1101
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:54,580
order the E football 2022 premium player pack.

1102
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:58,320
That's right, you can pre order loot boxes.

1103
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:03,840
So they're gonna have this player pack, which is $40.

1104
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,140
And it comes with the core game, which is free to play.

1105
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:10,260
So that doesn't really come with anything, a bunch of in game currency.

1106
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:16,860
And six chance deals, which are the loot boxes, or eight, if you pre order.

1107
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:22,380
So yeah, the chance deals allow players to randomly sign one athlete from a group of

1108
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:30,260
top tier ambassador and partner player, partner club players, like Lionel Messi and Neymar.

1109
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:36,380
So yeah, Konami pushing.

1110
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:37,740
I don't even know.

1111
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:43,620
But yeah, so apparently, though, me while the entire industry is trying to get away

1112
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:51,420
from loot boxes, because they fear the congressional legislation, he's like, run straight for it.

1113
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:55,140
It's fine, because it's free to play, right?

1114
00:56:55,140 --> 00:57:00,500
Bonds free for 29.99 Yeah, yeah, it's free to play, but you're

1115
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,840
paying $40.

1116
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,380
So is it really free to play at that point?

1117
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:10,140
SSG100 Matt says, Konami is that college friend that you haven't seen in a while and then

1118
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:14,900
suddenly see them on the highway exit ramp as a sign guy person for a local cell phone

1119
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:15,900
shop.

1120
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:19,660
No, no, no, look, I have respect for the dancing sign people, especially in that 105 degree

1121
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,980
heat here in Sacramento.

1122
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:22,980
Here's what it is.

1123
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:27,340
Konami is that friend that you stopped at the gas station, and you look over there and

1124
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:31,020
you see this guy who's not wearing a shirt and you're like, is that guy peeing in the

1125
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,020
ice machine?

1126
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:37,060
No, no, no, no, no, no, Konami is the person that you were friends with in high school

1127
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:41,860
that contacted you out of the blue on Facebook and tries to sign you up for an MLM.

1128
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:42,860
That's Konami.

1129
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:53,180
Konami is the one that comes out of the blue saying, Have you ever tried Herbalife?

1130
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:55,140
It's done wonders for me.

1131
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:01,460
No, I would think that Konami is just like that friend that you used to do all this stuff

1132
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:05,700
with, you know, like you play D&D with them, you go to the arcade with them and you hang

1133
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:09,140
out and then they just start ghosting you and getting new friends.

1134
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:14,140
They're casino friends.

1135
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:17,140
Am I wrong?

1136
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:19,140
Our chat's losing it right now.

1137
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:22,140
No, specifically casino friends, you were right on the money there.

1138
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:23,140
All right.

1139
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:28,140
Best of luck to Konami with E-Football.

1140
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:32,140
I guess there's those, it's not on the show world tonight, but there's those rumors about

1141
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:36,140
the Castlevania Advance collection that that's that's what it is now.

1142
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:37,140
Somebody had made this joke.

1143
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:42,140
It already scrolled off the screen for me, but licensing Silent Hill for beer money.

1144
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:47,140
That isn't too far from what seems to be happening is that they've licensed out these Castlevania

1145
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:53,140
games in order to buy whatever they're buying, because I think it's a great if that's true,

1146
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:54,140
it's great news.

1147
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:55,140
Those Castlevania events.

1148
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:58,140
I mean, how many times have we had Symphony of the Night released?

1149
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:59,140
I'm not saying it's a bad thing.

1150
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:01,140
That's one of the greatest games ever made, period.

1151
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:07,140
But I like the Advance games, too, and the other stuff that kind of came from that, you

1152
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:11,140
know, because Symphony of the Night and we haven't seen really rereleases of those in

1153
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,140
quite some time.

1154
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:20,140
So that's that's that's some good things, I guess, even if Konami has had to, you know,

1155
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,140
sell the rights away for these questionable things.

1156
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,140
They had to sell their nudes.

1157
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:26,140
All right.

1158
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:30,140
Anyway, let's move on.

1159
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:33,140
Let's get to our next story, which I think is Dark Sakura's or no, is mine.

1160
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:37,140
I just did.

1161
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,140
What did I do?

1162
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:39,140
It might be mine, sorry.

1163
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,140
Maybe it's yours.

1164
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,140
Maybe I'm the one that needs to.

1165
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:43,140
We just did Konami.

1166
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:44,140
All right.

1167
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:45,140
It's my turn.

1168
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,140
Sorry.

1169
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:51,140
Let's talk about Ubisoft, which if they don't make some changes there with the management,

1170
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:57,140
they might be destined for infamy and not some not so great ways as well.

1171
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:02,140
So some ex Ubisoft devs have opened a brand new studio.

1172
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:09,140
Nesting Games is a new studio that's up in Quebec in Canada, and it is officially co-owned

1173
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:12,140
by the Italian publisher Digital Bros.

1174
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:18,140
What's interesting, Nesting was created back in August by folks that used to be with Ubisoft,

1175
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:21,140
you know, because Ubisoft has a pretty excuse me, I'm about to sneeze.

1176
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,140
This is terrible.

1177
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:23,140
Bless you.

1178
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:25,140
And of course, it went away the minute I said that.

1179
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:28,140
The minute I called it out, it's like it went away.

1180
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:31,140
Typically for me, it happens when someone says bless you beforehand.

1181
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:32,140
All right.

1182
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:36,140
Anyway, if I just do that out of the blue, apologies in advance, because that's what

1183
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:37,140
will happen.

1184
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:39,140
Anyway, Nesting was formed back in August.

1185
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:41,140
It was former Ubisoft employees.

1186
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:45,140
And they've said this is an interesting kind of like quote in this whole like we're partnering

1187
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:46,140
with the Italian publisher.

1188
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:51,140
We want to go back to creating RPGs that are focused on immersion, great characters, powerful

1189
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:53,140
storytelling, and strong gameplay.

1190
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:59,140
We are moving away from the massive open world model, full of icons to clean up, and returning

1191
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:03,140
to experiences that are content driven and ultimately respect the player's time.

1192
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:08,140
Whether you play our games for 30 minutes or a two hour session, what you will get is

1193
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:12,140
always interesting content and a gratifying experience, which have led many people to

1194
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:14,140
go, is that shade?

1195
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:15,140
Is that shade?

1196
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:21,140
Because they're kind of saying in there, we're not going to do these messy things that basically

1197
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:23,140
they're saying they used to do.

1198
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:26,140
Kind of interesting there.

1199
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:30,140
Anyway, and then they go on to say, we felt from day one, we're part of the family of

1200
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,140
digital brothers and blah, blah, blah.

1201
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:34,140
Nice words there about that whole partnership.

1202
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:39,140
The first AAA project that Nesting Games is working on, a narrative focused single player

1203
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:42,140
RPG based on a brand new property.

1204
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:46,140
It's going to be Rassassin's Need.

1205
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,140
No, I'm just kidding.

1206
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:48,140
It's something else.

1207
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:54,140
Probably going to distance itself from that whole property completely.

1208
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:59,140
But yeah, that probably means you won't have to fill out all these parts on the map.

1209
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:01,140
That's kind of what they're saying with that.

1210
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:03,140
So looking forward to see what they make there.

1211
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:04,140
We'll see.

1212
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:07,140
Questbuster in chat says it's definitely shade.

1213
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:11,140
E3VL says the last Assassin's Creed game had way too much padding.

1214
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:15,140
Questbuster says, well, at least they won't have players.

1215
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:16,140
Too much junk in the trunk?

1216
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,140
Yeah.

1217
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,140
Potentially.

1218
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:19,140
For the ass creed?

1219
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:25,140
Anyway, that's not the only story we have about these studios that are in need of some

1220
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,140
makeovers, right?

1221
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:28,140
We have a continuing issue.

1222
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:35,140
A little reminder about the continuing issues with this company, Darsagra.

1223
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:47,140
So earlier in this week, some of the employees at Activision Blizzard with the Communications

1224
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:53,140
Workers of America, the CWA, which is a media labor union, filed an unfair labor practices

1225
01:02:53,140 --> 01:03:04,140
suit with the National Labor Relations Board, the NLRB, that accused the company of worker

1226
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:07,140
intimidation and union busting.

1227
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:14,140
It's just adding more and more and more to the other shit that's hitting the fan.

1228
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:19,140
This is like when the shit goes past the fan and then it hits some smaller fans and spreads

1229
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:22,140
out like a fine shitty mist.

1230
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:23,140
Just imagine.

1231
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:26,140
Don't actually live through it.

1232
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:38,140
Anyway, this is, of course, coming after the suit from the DFEH, the Department of Fair

1233
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:44,140
Employment and Housing for gender-based discrimination and harassment.

1234
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:47,140
There's been walkouts.

1235
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:55,140
They have banded with other employees from other companies, and we've seen these other

1236
01:03:55,140 --> 01:04:02,140
companies that have the same allegations rising try to do something about it.

1237
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:14,140
So they're really moving into very union-like territory using collective action for improvement

1238
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:16,140
of their working conditions.

1239
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:24,140
Now, the thing is that there's not really unions.

1240
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:28,140
We've talked about this before in the video game industry, and there really should be,

1241
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:35,140
but they're basically doing union behavior without actually unionizing.

1242
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:36,140
Make sense?

1243
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:39,140
Oh, yeah.

1244
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:46,140
But basically, the big thing that's standing in the way in part is American law favoring

1245
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:47,140
employers.

1246
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:51,140
Now, in California, it's a little bit different.

1247
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:55,140
You know, my mom likes to say, oh, you live in a bubble there in California, and it's

1248
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:56,140
true.

1249
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:57,140
We kind of do.

1250
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:04,140
We do have some pretty strong labor laws in California in particular.

1251
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:09,140
Like, this suit, I don't know that something like this would have flown somewhere else,

1252
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:22,140
But right now, while people are in favor of having unions, it's difficult because employers

1253
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:30,140
right now have different ways to intimidate their workers and to provide barriers for

1254
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:37,140
unionization, you know, especially with this really dangerous rhetoric.

1255
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:41,140
Like, oh, it's going to hurt the employees, or oh, it's going to hurt our profits, and

1256
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:45,140
then we can't pay our employees.

1257
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:55,140
So if people don't understand this, there are some ways to create a union or for a private

1258
01:05:55,140 --> 01:06:02,140
sector union to be recognized.

1259
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:08,140
So basically, either 30% of the workers can petition to hold a union election, and then

1260
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:16,140
the NLRB steps in for that, or an employer can voluntarily recognize a union.

1261
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:26,140
The first one is usually the big one, but sometimes it can be really manipulated, right?

1262
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:34,140
And then companies hire other companies that exist to do nothing but union busting.

1263
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:36,140
Which is allegedly what ABK kind of did.

1264
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:40,140
They had that company that came in that was kind of involved with some of that stuff.

1265
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:43,140
So it's just like, yeah, anyway, sorry.

1266
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:45,140
I'm going to be getting to it.

1267
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:47,140
Okay.

1268
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:54,140
But at any rate, well, and just to go on then, that actually happened in Alabama.

1269
01:06:54,140 --> 01:07:01,140
They were trying to unionize in Alabama for Amazon, and Amazon pulled in one of those

1270
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:02,140
companies.

1271
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:09,140
Basically, the way that they do this is they do propaganda, surveillance, mandatory anti-union

1272
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:15,140
meetings, delay tactics, intimidation, retaliation.

1273
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:24,140
But it was basically Amazon pulling this on them, where they put a mailbox.

1274
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:29,140
Well, number one, they were distributing anti-union materials, and they put a mailbox outside

1275
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:31,140
their warehouse.

1276
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:37,140
So the workers were thinking that Amazon was helping to tally the votes, and so it was

1277
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:39,140
stealing their votes.

1278
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:47,140
And the NLRB basically said Amazon was interfering and had a rerun of the election.

1279
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:51,140
And a lot of this, though, just an example, like that is the same stuff that's happening

1280
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:57,140
here with our video game companies, and we've seen it.

1281
01:07:57,140 --> 01:08:06,140
And now, even though the Activision Blizzard people haven't really pushed for unionization,

1282
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:12,140
they did bring in Wilmer Hale to do a third party investigation about those workplace

1283
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:16,140
issues from the lawsuit.

1284
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:18,140
Activision Blizzard did.

1285
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:28,140
But Winter Hale is, and I'm going to quote here, a known union busting law firm.

1286
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:31,140
So they're just doing their same tactics.

1287
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,140
They're not doing anything better.

1288
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:38,140
And by third party, it means third party that's going to go in their interest.

1289
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:42,140
Activision Blizzard had a statement that says, we care deeply about our employees' rights

1290
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:47,140
and have made great efforts to respect the rights of all employees under the NLRB, which

1291
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:52,140
is bullshit.

1292
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:56,140
But even with all of this going on, even with them pulling in their union busting, all of

1293
01:08:56,140 --> 01:09:04,140
that, there is a collection of employees called A Better ABK.

1294
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:12,140
They're saying that unionization is not their goal, but they are using very union-like tactics

1295
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:15,140
to improve the way things work in a company.

1296
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:20,140
Basically, if the company is going to bully them, they're going to bully right back.

1297
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:22,140
And there's power in numbers.

1298
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:23,140
Yeah.

1299
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:26,140
And the employee letter is still not been responded to.

1300
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:33,140
Well, and another employee, and this is an anonymous employee, said that they felt, I'm

1301
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:38,140
going to quote a little bit here, that in this moment, collective action and solidarity

1302
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:43,140
with each other without a union is the best solution and a place where a lot of people

1303
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:48,140
are scared of the concept of unionization because of the slow of anti-union propaganda

1304
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:51,140
that has pervaded our country.

1305
01:09:51,140 --> 01:10:01,140
We still have other employees at other companies like EA Dice, Paradox, Nexon, Ubisoft.

1306
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:09,140
They use some of the trade unions in their relative countries like in Sweden and France

1307
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:18,140
to help their employees out, but other ones have used the very similar non-union yet union

1308
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:27,140
tactics to bring about the real change in the company and protect the employees.

1309
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:32,140
So, I think it's a very interesting approach.

1310
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:34,140
You know what I mean?

1311
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:41,140
That they are putting together their own, I'm going to call it a task force.

1312
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:44,140
Does that sound like a good term, a task force, not a union?

1313
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:48,140
It sounds kind of like that even if they're not labeling it that.

1314
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:51,140
Sure, I'm with you there.

1315
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:57,140
But it is collective action for positive change.

1316
01:10:57,140 --> 01:11:02,140
Think of it like, okay, I hate to say it because I think that the whole last election here

1317
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:04,140
was a joke.

1318
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:06,140
The recall or the presidential?

1319
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:07,140
The recall.

1320
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:08,140
Okay.

1321
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:09,140
The recall.

1322
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:15,140
If you think of it kind of like how our recall elections go, enough people were pissed off

1323
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:21,140
about shit that they got together and got enough signatures on it that they put it to

1324
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:22,140
a vote, right?

1325
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:23,140
Right.

1326
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:32,140
In their eyes, recalling Newsom was a good idea and they wanted to get together and make

1327
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:36,140
this happen and so the vote happened.

1328
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:39,140
But it's kind of along the same lines.

1329
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:45,140
You get people together with a common goal and a common vision and they can move mountains.

1330
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:50,140
They don't necessarily have to be called a union to be a union of people.

1331
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:53,140
All right.

1332
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:58,140
We could do this in this country on a very big scale if people would get off their asses

1333
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:00,140
and actually do shit.

1334
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:05,140
If we elect people that actually represent those values, yes.

1335
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:06,140
All right.

1336
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:08,140
Before we get to our next story, Loki, I hope you won't mind.

1337
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:11,140
I'm going to do a little interrupt here because I want to get an update.

1338
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:13,140
I want to bring an old friend of OLR.

1339
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:15,140
Sorry to warn you guys, but you'll know what's happening.

1340
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:18,140
I want to bring an old friend of OLR onto the show here.

1341
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:24,140
So we're going to bring in our pal Shane into the room and talk a little bit about today's

1342
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:29,140
Pokemon Community Day because I know I have a very big question here in this whole experience

1343
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:38,140
and that is, I want to know how much shiny Pokemons Shane was able to get today.

1344
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:39,140
So I think Shane is there.

1345
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:40,140
Hi.

1346
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:41,140
Are you with us, Shane?

1347
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:42,140
Yeah, kind of.

1348
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:43,140
Hi.

1349
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:45,140
I'm super tired.

1350
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:46,140
You don't say.

1351
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:50,140
So today in Pokemon Go was a little bit of a holy holiday, right?

1352
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:51,140
Can you give us a little background?

1353
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:53,140
It really was.

1354
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:56,140
So today was Oshawa Community Day.

1355
01:12:56,140 --> 01:13:02,140
And if you have ever heard me talk like any sentence out of my mouth, you know that Oshawa

1356
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:05,140
is the Pokemon I would literally die for.

1357
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:08,140
So it was very important.

1358
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:09,140
But let me ask you this.

1359
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:13,140
I mean, aren't you, weren't you, aren't you kind of over Pokemon Go?

1360
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:17,140
Like why, if you don't really care about Pokemon Go, why do you, why do you care?

1361
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:18,140
Because I care about Oshawa.

1362
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:21,140
Oshawa trumps my hatred for this game.

1363
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:26,140
Like, they could put Oshawa in Fortnite and I'd probably start playing Fortnite.

1364
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:28,140
No, I would because Oshawa would be there.

1365
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:31,140
Not even I probably would.

1366
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,140
I see.

1367
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:39,140
So quickly, how did you plan to collect as many shiny and why shinies?

1368
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:41,140
Why does it have to be shiny Oshawats?

1369
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:43,140
Why not just a bunch of regular Oshawats?

1370
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:45,140
Well, I did both.

1371
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:49,140
But because shinies is like my thing in Pokemon.

1372
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:53,140
After I complete the decks in a game, it's like all I do is shiny hunt.

1373
01:13:53,140 --> 01:14:00,140
I just it's it's like I don't know if people get a thrill out of like actually hunting

1374
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:02,140
animals for whatever reason.

1375
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:04,140
That's the same thing I get.

1376
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:08,140
But without killing animals with weapons with tiny hunting.

1377
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:11,140
It's just like it's going to take a while sometimes.

1378
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:13,140
It's rare usually.

1379
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:15,140
And it's just fun.

1380
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:16,140
I just like it.

1381
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:19,140
So overall, quickly, I don't spend too much time.

1382
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:22,140
But how what was like your plan of attack today?

1383
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:27,140
How did you plan to maximize the shiny Oshawa hunting across six hours?

1384
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:33,140
So I, I my plan to start was to get there about 30 minutes early so I can make sure

1385
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:39,140
people didn't put up stupid lures on the stops, like because I wanted rainies on them

1386
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:43,140
instead of like, I don't know, something like a grass or mossy lure or whatever.

1387
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:51,140
And I had planned on basically just non stop checking and just catch the shiny's basically.

1388
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:55,140
But that did change because my husband came with me.

1389
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:57,140
And so I did kind of tone it down.

1390
01:14:57,140 --> 01:15:00,140
We got there only like 20 minutes early.

1391
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:07,140
And for probably about three and a half, four of the hours, the first four, three and a

1392
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:08,140
half.

1393
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:13,140
We kind of just leisurely walked around the area and caught basically everything.

1394
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:16,140
I ran out of balls like four times today.

1395
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:20,140
Oh, did you actually spend money for more or what did you do?

1396
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,140
Yes.

1397
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:23,140
Well, yes and no.

1398
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:27,140
I actually kind of thought that might be a problem.

1399
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:32,140
So I got like an Apple gift card a while back and I loaded it on my account and then I

1400
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:35,140
just used it because I wasn't going to spend it on anything else.

1401
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:38,140
So it wasn't like extra money.

1402
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:39,140
It was planned money.

1403
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:47,140
OK, so when all is said and done, Shane, how many shiny Ashwa did you walk away with today?

1404
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:49,140
Eighty seven.

1405
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:52,140
Good Lord.

1406
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:55,140
Are you what are you going to do with eighty seven shiny Pokemon?

1407
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:58,140
Keep them in the game.

1408
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:00,140
I don't know. They're just going to sit there and be adorable.

1409
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:02,140
Like, do they have to have a reason?

1410
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:04,140
It's not like they're taking up any space.

1411
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:08,140
Yeah, I mean, they're taking up Pokemon space, but that's fine.

1412
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:09,140
That's fine.

1413
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:10,140
It's not like real life space.

1414
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:12,140
You don't have to put it somewhere.

1415
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:13,140
No, no.

1416
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:14,140
It's all on my phone.

1417
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:16,140
Have you named all eighty seven?

1418
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:19,140
No, I haven't named any of them.

1419
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:23,140
I didn't make out too great today in terms of like four stars.

1420
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:27,140
I got zero four stars and only a few three stars.

1421
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:31,140
So I just I evolved some and yeah, they're just going to sit there.

1422
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:36,140
I probably got rid of or I say blended because it's just funnier

1423
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:38,140
when you think that you threw them in a blender.

1424
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:44,140
But I blended probably around four hundred regular

1425
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:48,140
Oshawa today during my late six hours.

1426
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:52,140
So it was a lot.

1427
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:58,140
Mike Defton Chat, who is a very Pokemon tuned person, says it's like crazy.

1428
01:16:58,140 --> 01:16:59,140
Shane got that many.

1429
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:03,140
I don't even think the top players get that many shinies in a community day.

1430
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:06,140
And yet you have to I knowing you as long as I have.

1431
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:09,140
You have to be upset you didn't get one hundred.

1432
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:14,140
OK, so I said I kept setting goals for myself throughout the day.

1433
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:24,140
My first goal was to at least get as many shinies as Gible Day,

1434
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,140
because that was my best one so far.

1435
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:29,140
I got like I don't remember, I think like sixty one.

1436
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:33,140
And so I was like, OK, I have to meet that goal.

1437
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:38,140
And then when I met that goal, I was like, OK, I would like to at least get 70.

1438
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:42,140
It was really early. I got I beat the first goal probably half.

1439
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:46,140
No, about four hours in.

1440
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:51,140
And then once I got 70, I was like, oh, come on, let's just do a hundred.

1441
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:54,140
But it didn't happen. So it's OK.

1442
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:59,140
Are you so usually and there's no guarantee it'll happen again this year,

1443
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:01,140
but I don't see why it wouldn't happen in December.

1444
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:05,140
They usually do an encore event where they bring. Yes, I'll get more.

1445
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:10,140
So is your goal to top one hundred once we get to December?

1446
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:15,140
Yeah, literally when that community a community day happens,

1447
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:21,140
I can't think of another Pokemon that's come out this year for community day that I'm even going to care about.

1448
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:25,140
So I'll only check Auschwitz. Everything else is just trash.

1449
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:32,140
So and for the record and for comparison's sake, I also did community day today and I did all Bluetooth catching.

1450
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:35,140
I actually was playing Ingress because there's an event going on in that game, too.

1451
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:39,140
And I said, you know, usually I do all right with Bluetooth catching. I'm not Shane.

1452
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:44,140
I'm happy if I get three shiny Auschwitz so I can have one of each evolution.

1453
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:50,140
It's a cute Pokemon. I just don't have the same personal thing that Shane's got with Auschwitz.

1454
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:54,140
So I was like, I'm happy if I get three. I had nine in 30 minutes.

1455
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:58,140
And I was like, honestly, I could quit right now and I'm satisfied.

1456
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:02,140
But oh, yeah, I started the day with six hundred balls.

1457
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:06,140
And so I was like, whatever, I'm still working on Ingress stuff, so I'll just keep going.

1458
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:10,140
So I probably played for about three hours. So I did Ingress stuff. I ended with twenty one.

1459
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:18,140
I had twenty one shiny Pokemon, shiny Auschwitz today, which for me, that's oddly I got a one hundred Caterpie today.

1460
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:24,140
It didn't even hatch. It was a wild Caterpie. A hundred. I don't know how the fuck that happened, but whatever.

1461
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:31,140
No, no hundo Auschwitz so sadly. But yeah, I got twenty one shinies without really trying.

1462
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:36,140
And I'm told Alan, who hasn't really played Pokemon go in quite some time,

1463
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:43,140
actually took out his phone today and just kind of poked at it between Dead by Daylight matches and said he got two shinies today.

1464
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:47,140
He was he said he got about one for every fifty.

1465
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:54,140
That he was looking at. It's not bad. Yeah, I I should have just kind of given up.

1466
01:19:54,140 --> 01:20:00,140
It was all because I wanted a four star because I have a four star shiny Serperior.

1467
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:07,140
I was like, oh, if I could get an oshawott and get, you know, all the way to samurai, it's a shiny hundred percent.

1468
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:12,140
I'd be so happy. So if I had given up on that chase a little earlier,

1469
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:18,140
I could have got one hundred shinies. No problem. Your your best chance for the hundo is to do lucky trades.

1470
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:26,140
Like next time I see you and we're lucky friends, like we just just trade zero star oshawott on a lucky trade and you might get one hundred.

1471
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:30,140
The last time I did a lucky trade, I got one hundred percent out of it. Dustin and I,

1472
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:35,140
we always do one shiny trade since that's all you can do. And, you know, it wasn't great.

1473
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:40,140
And then we're like, let's do a regular trade. So the second trade we did was a lucky trade.

1474
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:45,140
It wasn't one hundred, but it was still lucky. And I got so mad.

1475
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:49,140
And as Joe says, I was impressed with my thirty today. That's nothing compared to Shane.

1476
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:59,140
No, thirty is impressive, y'all. Shane is sick. Like, like, don't compare yourself to Shane in this because you're never going to be happy.

1477
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:04,140
Like Shane is sick. So let's see. Let's see what my total shiny count is.

1478
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:10,140
I've got my phone right now. So on my phone, I have twelve hundred eighty seven shinies from Pokemon Go.

1479
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:18,140
And that's not including ones I've transferred into the main games. So I think I have maybe four hundred shinies.

1480
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:23,140
I don't know. I'm bringing I'm bringing up Pokemon Go right now to check how many shinies I have.

1481
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:28,140
Let me ask you this question. I don't want to derail the whole show with Pokemon Go chat, but people want to actually know.

1482
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:34,140
So Mike Deft is asking, did you use any fast catching technique in particular?

1483
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:38,140
What what is your technique to catch eighty seven shinies?

1484
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:43,140
OK. Oh, so I I refuse to fast catch shinies.

1485
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:48,140
I will not do it. I fast catch the regulars.

1486
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:54,140
Like if I tap it and well until I ran out of balls, I was like, oh, just best catch everything.

1487
01:21:54,140 --> 01:22:00,140
So, you know, hold the pokeball down, slide over to the left and then throw and run away.

1488
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:04,140
And that's great. It's it's super good for catching regulars, but I don't trust it for shinies.

1489
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:11,140
Like I have to sit there and make sure it's actually in the ball or I'll get very upset.

1490
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:18,140
I have four hundred and forty six shinies and I thought I was cool. And Mike Deft says one thousand one hundred and seventeen.

1491
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:23,140
Oh, yeah. Wow. It's right behind me. Wow. Wow. Wow.

1492
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:28,140
All right. Shane, I know you have some homework and some other things to get to tonight, but do you have any other?

1493
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:32,140
Yeah, I decided to not do it. So whatever. Well, then I'll see you on Final Fantasy later.

1494
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:38,140
Do you have any do you have any other you and I need to I know Jamie does stuff Sunday nights after the show,

1495
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:44,140
but during the week, you and I need to do some more Final Fantasy 14 streaming and talking about that seven hour stream,

1496
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:49,140
which we'll get to later in the show. I haven't got to it yet, but for all of it, I did it.

1497
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:55,140
I know. Well, quickly, I haven't got it. What was your favorite part of that seven hour stream for Final Fantasy 14?

1498
01:22:55,140 --> 01:23:04,140
Oh, a couple quick favorite parts. One, the title screen reveal, because that was just beautiful to everything about Reaper.

1499
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:08,140
Three, everything about Sage for the Sumner rework.

1500
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:12,140
OK, sounds good. Shane, I'm going to let you go.

1501
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:18,140
Thank you for sharing your experience with Pokemon Go community today, because you're crazy when it comes to catching shinies,

1502
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:22,140
especially Oshawa. I'm glad you caught at least 87. That's pretty good.

1503
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:26,140
Like everybody sitting here going, nobody catches that many. So I know you're sad you didn't hit 100.

1504
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:31,140
But like you, you probably caught more than anyone else on the planet or close.

1505
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:37,140
Really close, I'm sure. Any other thoughts before we let you go? No.

1506
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:41,140
OK, then I'll talk to you later. All right. Bye. All right. Bye. All right.

1507
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:45,140
Thank you, Shane, for joining us here on the show. I appreciate that.

1508
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:52,140
And that was kind of that was kind of last minute notice, because I knew there were going to be some listeners that would want to know.

1509
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:58,140
What did his crazy ass do with Pokemon Day, especially today? Right.

1510
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:08,140
I know. I know. 80s. That is 87. That's how I kept waiting to say in a row, but that was supposed to be 37 over six hours.

1511
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:12,140
That's like 12 an hour. That's one every five minutes.

1512
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:18,140
And Alan said, like, one in 50 would be shiny. Impressive.

1513
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:26,140
All right, Loki, I'm sorry to make you wait, but you get it. What's what's next on the news for you?

1514
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:32,140
You're muted, by the way, Loki. I understand you had to contain all your excitement.

1515
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:41,140
I did. I did. You know, so there is the 10th anniversary of THQ Nordic.

1516
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:50,140
And they basically celebrated their 10th anniversary by having a little livestream where they announced some things.

1517
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:59,140
So first thing we've got is Destroy All Humans 2 Reprobed, which is the remake of Destroy All Humans or I guess remaster.

1518
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:04,140
And I know it is remake and it is being made in Unreal four.

1519
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:09,140
So that's going to be coming out on all modern consoles and PC.

1520
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:16,140
SpongeBob SquarePants, the Cosmic Shake. It's a new 3D platformer game with SpongeBob.

1521
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:24,140
Jagged Alliance 3. We have Outcast 2 A New Beginning and Superpower 3.

1522
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:31,140
And then MX versus ATV Legends were the games that were announced also to tie in with their 10th anniversary.

1523
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:34,140
There is a sale right now on Steam and also a couple of free games.

1524
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:39,140
You get Titan Quest Anniversary Edition and Jagged Alliance 1 Gold Edition for free.

1525
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:46,140
So neat. I don't know. I didn't play the new Destroy All Humans, but it looked pretty cool.

1526
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:50,140
I like the second game, too, so maybe I'll check it out.

1527
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:56,140
Was there anything in particular you were looking forward to during that stream?

1528
01:25:56,140 --> 01:26:01,140
No, I didn't even know the stream even happened. I didn't watch it live.

1529
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:05,140
I think I heard about it like an hour before, but it wasn't available.

1530
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:12,140
Yeah, there's not a lot from THQ that I'm excited about nowadays.

1531
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:17,140
I don't remember. They used to do the Saints Row stuff.

1532
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:21,140
So back in the day, I would be excited about that kind of thing.

1533
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:25,140
But now that's a whole separate company that handles that.

1534
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:27,140
Oh well.

1535
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:32,140
Alright, one more story before we get to our regular segment here.

1536
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:37,140
You know I love my AR gaming, GPS gaming, and all that stuff.

1537
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:41,140
Like I just mentioned, today I was playing Ingress and Pokémon GO.

1538
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:45,140
I was dual wielding, playing one on my phone while I'm bluetoothing with the other,

1539
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:47,140
using my real world location to play both.

1540
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:52,140
And because I like GPS gaming, I've tried them all.

1541
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:55,140
I've literally tried them all, if it's on iPhone anyway.

1542
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:58,140
There's been a couple Android only ones I haven't played, but for the most part I've tried them all.

1543
01:26:58,140 --> 01:27:03,140
And I was looking forward to trying this one, but this game got cancelled before it even came out.

1544
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:06,140
And that kind of surprised me. It was a Niantic game.

1545
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:09,140
Of course Niantic, being the makers of Pokémon GO,

1546
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:12,140
they're kind of at the forefront of a lot of these AR and GPS games.

1547
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:15,140
And that game is Catan World Explorers.

1548
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:19,140
The game never came out. It came out in certain countries for testing,

1549
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:21,140
but it didn't come out in the US, so as far as I'm concerned.

1550
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:22,140
Like the Settlers of Catan?

1551
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:27,140
Yeah, Settlers of Catan, the board game. They were turning into a real world AR game.

1552
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:31,140
And they have decided they will shut the game down on November 18th.

1553
01:27:31,140 --> 01:27:35,140
So if you were in one of the countries, I think it was in Australia, New Zealand,

1554
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:40,140
like Denmark maybe, and one country in Asia I think had it too.

1555
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:44,140
So it was in a few countries, but I never got to play it.

1556
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:48,140
And it's all about me. Or at least that's how I feel in the moment.

1557
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:51,140
So I never will get to play it. They are pulling the game.

1558
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:54,140
It's hard to tell what the hell happened.

1559
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:58,140
They left a really weird note and in the note it said,

1560
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:03,140
we had a vision for trading, harvesting, and building up the world in seasonal play

1561
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:07,140
and resetting the board each month just like you do for each game you play at home.

1562
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:12,140
But trying to adapt such a well-designed board game to a global,

1563
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:17,140
location-based, massively multiplayer online game was a tough challenge.

1564
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:22,140
Now, I don't know nothing about what's happening behind the scenes,

1565
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:25,140
but I got a good guess based on this statement.

1566
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:28,140
I think Catan pulled the license.

1567
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:32,140
I don't think they were happy with the product that Niantic came up with for whatever reason.

1568
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:39,140
And whether I agree with it or not, it's their artistic license to be able to do so.

1569
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:47,140
But when you say we had a vision, but trying to adapt this didn't work,

1570
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:52,140
it really is screaming to me that the Catan holders didn't like what you came up with,

1571
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:55,140
but you were sticking to your guns with the game you made.

1572
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:58,140
And what further kind of goes with that?

1573
01:28:58,140 --> 01:29:02,140
They talk about how the lessons that they learned while working on World Explorers

1574
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:05,140
will go to future projects.

1575
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:11,140
It's almost screaming to me that Niantic is going to reskin Catan and make it a different game.

1576
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:15,140
Pikmin? Wow, that sounds just like an Nintendo thing.

1577
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:17,140
No, not Pikmin. I'm going to stop you there.

1578
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:20,140
Because Pikmin, they've said, is going to be out by the end of the year.

1579
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:23,140
So Pikmin is happening and it's a different thing.

1580
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:25,140
And I don't know much about it.

1581
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:29,140
I hear it's AR gaming lite.

1582
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:32,140
It's not going to be a very involved game.

1583
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:34,140
I think it'll probably be even more aimed at kids than Pokémon is.

1584
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:36,140
But that is all speculation.

1585
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:39,140
I don't know until I play the game myself and give you my own impressions.

1586
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:44,140
But still, to hear that Niantic, the minds behind Pokémon GO,

1587
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:48,140
had to shut down a game before it even came out is shocking.

1588
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:52,140
So it's just crazy.

1589
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:56,140
Dark Tetsuya agrees with my logic, saying yes, that sounds like what probably happened.

1590
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:59,140
Tigerclaw says, maybe it was something that sounded good on paper,

1591
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:01,140
but trying to make it didn't pan out.

1592
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:04,140
Yeah, apparently when they met at the table the first time, they had an idea.

1593
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:08,140
Or the Catan people were like, you made Pokémon GO?

1594
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:10,140
Fuck yeah, we want to work with you.

1595
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:15,140
And then when Niantic said, here's the game we made, the Catan people went, yikes!

1596
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:18,140
This isn't Pokémon GO, this is Withers Unite.

1597
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:20,140
Yeah, this isn't Pokémon GO.

1598
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:22,140
Was it the Harry Potter game?

1599
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:24,140
Yeah, because the Harry Potter game is fucking Pokémon GO.

1600
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:30,140
Well, the Harry Potter game, and that has its own issues with it.

1601
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:32,140
Because I hate her, the one behind it.

1602
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:34,140
But obviously she has nothing to do with the game.

1603
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:36,140
But the game has good combat to it.

1604
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:40,140
Exactly, the game has that combat that's actually pretty rad.

1605
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:45,140
Like I actually way prefer fighting in Harry Potter.

1606
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:48,140
Keep in mind, I haven't played it in like a year and a half.

1607
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:55,140
But the fighting in that game is way better than any raid in Pokémon GO or PvP.

1608
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:58,140
And it's not that much more complicated.

1609
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:02,140
But it feels like there's more to it, you know?

1610
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:04,140
Anyway.

1611
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:08,140
D'Artitsia says Catan is all resource gathering and that sort of thing, right?

1612
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:11,140
And AR game based on that does sound kind of neat.

1613
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:14,140
Hey, if I have any friends at Niantic that are listening, I doubt it.

1614
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:16,140
But I'm always going to take the shot.

1615
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:21,140
You guys should give Sid Meier a call and say hey.

1616
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:23,140
I knew you were going to say that.

1617
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:27,140
Did you? Yeah, you should give Sid Meier a call and say hey.

1618
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:30,140
We really like civilization.

1619
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:35,140
Why not?

1620
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:37,140
Do Civ Nation.

1621
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:39,140
Yeah, Civ Planet or something.

1622
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:41,140
Civ World.

1623
01:31:41,140 --> 01:31:43,140
Civilization Explorer.

1624
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:44,140
Civilized World.

1625
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:45,140
Fuck it.

1626
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:47,140
If Catan doesn't want it, fuck it.

1627
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:50,140
Do Civilization Explorer. I'm all for it.

1628
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:54,140
Of course, that kind of sounds like something different than a game.

1629
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:55,140
But anyway.

1630
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:57,140
Alright.

1631
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:58,140
Let's go.

1632
01:31:58,140 --> 01:32:00,140
D'Artitsia in chat says, right?

1633
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:02,140
That was going to be my next sentence.

1634
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:04,140
Can they do something with civilization?

1635
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:06,140
You know what? I'm going to tweet them right now.

1636
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:10,140
Will you all please retweet and like my status?

1637
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:13,140
I like SSJ100 and Matt's comment there.

1638
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:17,140
Maybe Niantic was trying to work on it from 40 meters away.

1639
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:20,140
And it didn't work because they were 80 meters away.

1640
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:25,140
I missed that comment but it's gold.

1641
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:26,140
Alright.

1642
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:33,140
Let's go to our next segment and talk about times when we didn't even have phones that could play games.

1643
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:35,140
Our phones could play Snake.

1644
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:39,140
No, actually when this game came from, the phone was maybe in the car.

1645
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:41,140
It was in the limo because you had to be that rich.

1646
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:43,140
Let's get to our next segment.

1647
01:32:47,140 --> 01:33:03,140
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1648
01:33:03,140 --> 01:33:07,140
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1649
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:11,140
And what did you pick for the classic game this week, DarkSakura?

1650
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:13,140
I picked a lust.

1651
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:18,140
And I'm sorry, by the way, if I sound a little funny, I had to put my mouth brace in because my mouth hurts.

1652
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:19,140
So I'm fine.

1653
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:20,140
Sorry.

1654
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:21,140
Okay.

1655
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:23,140
So, Lust came out in 1988.

1656
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:25,140
It's a shooter game done by Compile.

1657
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:32,140
And it originally came out on the Sega Master System and then later on on the MSX2 by CP Communications.

1658
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:38,140
Outside of the US, the Master System version was released as a game called Power Strike.

1659
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:45,140
And then, of course, we had all kinds of sequels and derivatives from both versions of it.

1660
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:56,140
So basically the story of a lust in general is there's a man-made supercomputer called the DIA-51 that had been infected by a virus that was spreading.

1661
01:33:56,140 --> 01:34:02,140
And eventually the machine that's infected with it wants to eliminate people.

1662
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:15,140
And so when the computer attack hurts this dude's girlfriend, Yuri, then Rei, the guy, gets in a plane and goes shooting.

1663
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:17,140
Because that's what you do.

1664
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:22,140
Anyway, like I said, it came out for the Master System.

1665
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:24,140
That's February 1988.

1666
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:30,140
And it came out as Power Strike, which in the US it was male only limited edition.

1667
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:37,140
But it did get some retail love over from Toys R Us and a couple other chains in North America.

1668
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:39,140
And in Europe it was regular retail.

1669
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:47,140
The game actually has had many other releases.

1670
01:34:48,140 --> 01:35:01,140
The MSX2 version itself had extra stages, two new stages, lower difficulty, and a bunch of cutscenes, which is pretty cool.

1671
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:07,140
It has been ported by Squenix to phones.

1672
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:16,140
And then it was re-released, the MSX2 version was re-released on the Wii's virtual console in Japan.

1673
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:28,140
And then also with Aleste 2, it was released through the WOM service, W-O-O-M-B, for an MSX revival.

1674
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:33,140
In the US, like I said, the Sega Master System version was called Power Strike.

1675
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:36,140
And it was received very well.

1676
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:38,140
It got some really good reviews.

1677
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:47,140
So now for all of the sequels, of which there have been many, and even a cancelled one.

1678
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:54,140
And I've even spoken about one of the games here in this segment.

1679
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:56,140
I figure it's time to go back to the original.

1680
01:35:56,140 --> 01:36:01,140
So followed by this we had Aleste Gaiden, which was on MSX2.

1681
01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:04,140
We had Aleste 2, which is also MSX2.

1682
01:36:04,140 --> 01:36:10,140
We had Musha Aleste, which came out on the Mega Drive.

1683
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:12,140
And I think I have done Musha.

1684
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:15,140
We had GG Aleste, which was Game Gear Aleste.

1685
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:18,140
We had Super Aleste for the SNES.

1686
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:23,140
It came out in the US as Space Megaforce.

1687
01:36:23,140 --> 01:36:25,140
Sound familiar?

1688
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:31,140
On Sega CD, we had Denine Aleste, which was Robo Aleste over here.

1689
01:36:31,140 --> 01:36:35,140
Also Game Gear, we had GG Aleste 2.

1690
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:39,140
Also for Game Gear Micro, GG Aleste 3.

1691
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:41,140
That was in 2020.

1692
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:48,140
There is a to be announced release for Aleste Branch.

1693
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:52,140
And an arcade version called Senjin Aleste.

1694
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:55,140
Actually out this year.

1695
01:36:55,140 --> 01:37:02,140
For cancelled one, there was Denine Aleste 2, which would have been Robo Aleste 2 for Mega CD or Sega CD.

1696
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:04,140
And then there's the related games.

1697
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:14,140
So these games, some of the different Aleste versions are based on them and some in reverse.

1698
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:21,140
Some of them are other compile-ish shooters that have a lot to do with the Aleste series.

1699
01:37:22,140 --> 01:37:28,140
Including one of the best games in the universe to ever, ever come out.

1700
01:37:28,140 --> 01:37:30,140
So we have Zanac.

1701
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:34,140
It came out. MSX Famicom Disk NES.

1702
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:36,140
We have the Guardian Legend.

1703
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:38,140
As in Guardic.

1704
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:40,140
Guardic Gaiden, sorry.

1705
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:44,140
Guardic was kind of a different game to Guardic Gaiden.

1706
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:49,140
And the shooting in there is very reminiscent of Aleste.

1707
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:53,140
You have Gunhead for PC Engine.

1708
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:55,140
Gunac for NES.

1709
01:37:55,140 --> 01:38:01,140
Seirei Senshi Spriggan, which was for PC Engine, also anime.

1710
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:05,140
Spriggan Mark 2, Re-Terraform Project, also on PC Engine CD.

1711
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:09,140
Power Strike 2 for the Sega Master System.

1712
01:38:09,140 --> 01:38:12,140
Silphia, which is a fun little game, let me tell you.

1713
01:38:12,140 --> 01:38:14,140
I love Silphia.

1714
01:38:14,140 --> 01:38:16,140
It's on PC Engine CD.

1715
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:19,140
Spriggan Powers for Super Famicom.

1716
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:25,140
And then some of the compile employees left and joined Rising.

1717
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:27,140
Which I brought this company up before.

1718
01:38:27,140 --> 01:38:31,140
When we talked about Mahou Daisakusen.

1719
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:35,140
They did Mahou Daisakusen in Shippu Mahou Daisakusen.

1720
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:50,140
Aleste in and of itself has all kinds of little tendrils mixed in other games of similar genre.

1721
01:38:50,140 --> 01:38:53,140
Very much seen in other compile games.

1722
01:38:53,140 --> 01:38:56,140
Very much seen just in general.

1723
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:59,140
We still have it today.

1724
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:04,140
Like I said, there's a Senjin Aleste coming out in Arcade.

1725
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:07,140
Or may already be, I don't know, I have to check.

1726
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:09,140
This year.

1727
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:14,140
I'm actually looking.

1728
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:18,140
It came out in July.

1729
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:19,140
Oh, there you go.

1730
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:26,140
I was going to say, you referenced before the connection to the Guardian Legend and all that stuff.

1731
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:28,140
I really see it in this game.

1732
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:30,140
I'm not familiar with this game honestly.

1733
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:33,140
I wasn't before you brought it up today.

1734
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:37,140
But I really see the connection to the Guardian Legend at the end of the stage.

1735
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:40,140
When they beat the stage, the way the ship flies away.

1736
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:42,140
It plays the little tune.

1737
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:43,140
The ship flies away.

1738
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:46,140
It's very reminiscent of what happens in the Guardian Legend.

1739
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:47,140
It's very interesting.

1740
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:50,140
It's that little thing that just takes me back.

1741
01:39:50,140 --> 01:39:52,140
But it had some of the same developers.

1742
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:54,140
Both were compile games.

1743
01:39:54,140 --> 01:39:55,140
Oh yeah.

1744
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:56,140
I noticed that right off the bat.

1745
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:58,140
I was like, oh, I just picked compile game.

1746
01:39:58,140 --> 01:39:59,140
I know why.

1747
01:39:59,140 --> 01:40:08,140
Well, but the other thing too is that I believe that some of, there's like some Aleste.

1748
01:40:10,140 --> 01:40:11,140
What am I trying to think?

1749
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:18,140
There are some Aleste Easter eggs that I think show up in the Guardian Legend.

1750
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:24,140
Like, I want to say that the Landers might have been a part of it.

1751
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:26,140
But I'd have to go look that up again.

1752
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:36,140
But yeah, Aleste and Garden Gaiden were only like not even a year apart in release.

1753
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:39,140
So they had to have had some co-development.

1754
01:40:40,140 --> 01:40:50,140
But at any rate, get yourself an MSX2 or a Master System and look for Aleste or Power Strike.

1755
01:40:50,140 --> 01:40:55,140
And quite frankly, how dare you not have a Master System in an MSX2 already?

1756
01:40:55,140 --> 01:40:58,140
I don't have either one.

1757
01:40:58,140 --> 01:41:01,140
I do have several Master Systems.

1758
01:41:01,140 --> 01:41:02,140
Good memories though.

1759
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:03,140
Good memories.

1760
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:04,140
All right.

1761
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:05,140
You know what?

1762
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:06,140
You know what I have to say though?

1763
01:41:06,140 --> 01:41:14,140
If any of you have a Genesis, like I think the second edition of the Genesis, look for the FM Power Base Converter.

1764
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:19,140
Because then you can get the FM sound to play for most games.

1765
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:21,140
There's a few it doesn't work on.

1766
01:41:21,140 --> 01:41:22,140
All right.

1767
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:25,140
There it is, your classic game of the week, Aleste.

1768
01:41:25,140 --> 01:41:26,140
Great pick.

1769
01:41:26,140 --> 01:41:29,140
I love these ones where it's like, oh, I didn't know much about it going in,

1770
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:31,140
but it's got a great connection to something I do love.

1771
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:33,140
So, yeah.

1772
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:36,140
And well, Compile, we love Compile.

1773
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:38,140
We stand Compile in this house.

1774
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:40,140
We stand Compile in this house.

1775
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:41,140
Absolutely.

1776
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:42,140
All right.

1777
01:41:42,140 --> 01:41:45,140
Unlike Alestra, it won't make you poop your pants.

1778
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:47,140
Dude.

1779
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:49,140
I don't know.

1780
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:51,140
There's some of the stages are kind of hard.

1781
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:53,140
You might shit yourself.

1782
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:54,140
All right.

1783
01:41:54,140 --> 01:42:02,140
Let's go to some rapid fire news that hopefully won't give us that same problem in the ball pit at McDonald's.

1784
01:42:03,140 --> 01:42:06,140
Rapid fire news, Loki.

1785
01:42:06,140 --> 01:42:10,140
So we have delays, as is tradition.

1786
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:13,140
Dying Light 2 has been delayed to 2022.

1787
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:17,140
That is now coming out February 4th.

1788
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:23,140
Battlefield 2042 has been delayed a little bit to November 19th.

1789
01:42:23,140 --> 01:42:29,140
So that is going to be a little bit longer than October 22nd.

1790
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:31,140
Come on.

1791
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:32,140
And then we've got news.

1792
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:40,140
I completely forgot that this was even a thing, but apparently more details on the Twisted Metal TV show that's coming.

1793
01:42:40,140 --> 01:42:47,140
Anthony Mackie is going to be playing a character in the show that is a name.

1794
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:48,140
John Doe.

1795
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:53,140
He is a smart ass male milkman.

1796
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:54,140
All right.

1797
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:55,140
I don't know.

1798
01:42:55,140 --> 01:42:56,140
I don't.

1799
01:42:56,140 --> 01:42:58,140
Question mark Boggle.

1800
01:42:58,140 --> 01:42:59,140
Yep.

1801
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:00,140
Same.

1802
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:01,140
Yeah.

1803
01:43:01,140 --> 01:43:06,140
So I guess we will have to wait and see when this happens.

1804
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:08,140
They're saying that it's supposed to fill next year.

1805
01:43:08,140 --> 01:43:10,140
So.

1806
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:11,140
Cool.

1807
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:12,140
I'll watch it when it comes out.

1808
01:43:12,140 --> 01:43:13,140
Yep.

1809
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:14,140
Same.

1810
01:43:14,140 --> 01:43:15,140
Same reaction.

1811
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:16,140
This is Joe and Matt in chat.

1812
01:43:16,140 --> 01:43:17,140
What?

1813
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:21,140
I hope we get a new Twisted Metal game.

1814
01:43:21,140 --> 01:43:23,140
That would look pretty cool on PlayStation five.

1815
01:43:23,140 --> 01:43:24,140
All right.

1816
01:43:24,140 --> 01:43:25,140
Dark Soccer.

1817
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:26,140
Dark Soccer.

1818
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:28,140
What do you have for us?

1819
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:34,340
Well, some YouTubers, you know, there's those like YouTube channels where they like open

1820
01:43:34,340 --> 01:43:38,140
warehouses and go into places and stuff like that.

1821
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:39,140
Yeah.

1822
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:46,140
Well, this group that has a YouTube channel called Cheap Finds Gold Mines and they go

1823
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:52,140
through like goodwill yard sales, but they were allowed into a house.

1824
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:59,140
That was a hoarders house that had been closed for 20 years, something like that.

1825
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:00,140
And it was gross.

1826
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:02,140
It was super gross.

1827
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:10,140
But they found all kinds of stuff like they found Blockbuster VHS tapes and different

1828
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:14,140
collectibles and a bunch of video games.

1829
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:19,140
It's I tried to watch some of it was it was really kind of nasty.

1830
01:44:19,140 --> 01:44:28,140
But they pulled out something like a bunch of factory sealed games.

1831
01:44:28,140 --> 01:44:34,140
They passed on some already and already opened games, but they did make exceptions for certain

1832
01:44:34,140 --> 01:44:42,140
games like Toomba on PS1 and the terrible PS3 Bayonetta.

1833
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:48,140
And the quote is that they had to deal with a little bit of mouse poo to get some good

1834
01:44:48,140 --> 01:44:50,140
games.

1835
01:44:50,140 --> 01:44:53,140
And one of them was bitten by a brown recluse.

1836
01:44:53,140 --> 01:44:59,140
I'm trying to figure out how was it locked away for 20 years like that.

1837
01:44:59,140 --> 01:45:06,140
I mean, I realize that, you know, those situations can already sometimes be a little, you know,

1838
01:45:06,140 --> 01:45:10,140
messy, you know, depending on the severity of it.

1839
01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:15,140
How did it then sit for 20 years?

1840
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:17,140
Well, that's how all the animals showed up.

1841
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:18,140
Oh, yeah.

1842
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:22,140
But I mean, it was absolutely a hoarder home.

1843
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:27,140
And I mean, I've watched hoarders before.

1844
01:45:27,140 --> 01:45:31,140
Hoarders is usually what I watch to motivate myself to clean my house.

1845
01:45:31,140 --> 01:45:32,140
Big same.

1846
01:45:32,140 --> 01:45:33,140
Yeah.

1847
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:34,140
Yeah.

1848
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:39,140
But yeah, I wouldn't I'm surprised that like it wouldn't have just been broken into, you

1849
01:45:39,140 --> 01:45:43,140
know, that's apparently not sit there.

1850
01:45:43,140 --> 01:45:46,140
Yeah, that's weird part to me.

1851
01:45:46,140 --> 01:45:50,140
Well, I mean, it also depends on where in the country you are.

1852
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:54,140
And I don't believe I saw where this was.

1853
01:45:54,140 --> 01:46:00,140
But, you know, apparently the other person on here got scabies.

1854
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:01,140
Wow.

1855
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:02,140
All right.

1856
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:03,140
I don't know.

1857
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:08,140
Would you would you brave that for a shitload of games?

1858
01:46:08,140 --> 01:46:12,140
If people are still dumb enough to be buying these cartridges for like a million dollars,

1859
01:46:12,140 --> 01:46:17,140
which, by the way, I should at some point mention those like you to there's a great

1860
01:46:17,140 --> 01:46:20,140
and I'm sorry, I don't remember the creator in the moment, but about our voiceover guy

1861
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:22,140
Jason was telling me about it and all this stuff.

1862
01:46:22,140 --> 01:46:24,140
There's a great like documentary on YouTube.

1863
01:46:24,140 --> 01:46:28,140
Somebody in you in chat is going to know what I'm talking about instantly that went on for

1864
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:32,140
like it was like a 50 minute documentary that basically talks about why those price.

1865
01:46:32,140 --> 01:46:33,140
And we've talked about it on this show.

1866
01:46:33,140 --> 01:46:38,140
Those those limited auctions were like old cartridges going for a million dollars.

1867
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:43,140
They basically like how it's all B.S. like it's an artificial inflation of the industry

1868
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:46,140
and it's it's basically a crime what's going on.

1869
01:46:46,140 --> 01:46:47,140
So somebody.

1870
01:46:47,140 --> 01:46:50,140
Oh, it's Jason in China.

1871
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:52,140
Fuck, yeah. Hi, Jason.

1872
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:54,140
Says Carl Jobst is the name there.

1873
01:46:54,140 --> 01:46:58,140
Carl Jobst. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. That's exactly it.

1874
01:46:58,140 --> 01:47:03,140
So I want to shout that out because I know Jason brought that up and I have not,

1875
01:47:03,140 --> 01:47:06,140
unfortunately, taken the 50 minutes to watch it myself.

1876
01:47:06,140 --> 01:47:09,140
Oh, you did. What did you quit? Please tell us about it, because I'm sorry.

1877
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:14,140
I know it's rapid fire news and Jamie's story, but this is an important follow up, please.

1878
01:47:14,140 --> 01:47:19,140
Yeah. So basically, a lot of the SEAL games that are going for a lot of money right now,

1879
01:47:19,140 --> 01:47:25,140
they're being, I guess, graded by a certain company that's involved with this auction house.

1880
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:31,140
And so a lot of these games are also being sold like to themselves, basically.

1881
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:36,140
So like they will sell like one of those sealed Mario Brothers games for a million dollars,

1882
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:40,140
but they're selling it to another guy that works at the auction house type of thing.

1883
01:47:40,140 --> 01:47:43,140
So they're inflating the prices by this.

1884
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:48,140
These guys got in trouble a while back when they were inflating the prices of, oh, gosh,

1885
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:54,140
what was it? Was it baseball cards, comics, something that was like back in the 80s.

1886
01:47:54,140 --> 01:48:00,140
It wasn't maybe in comics. I don't know. Bobby says coins. Coins.

1887
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:04,140
OK. Yeah, yeah. So they were basically inflating the price.

1888
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:11,140
So it's really sketch to have like an auction house and a grading company kind of working together

1889
01:48:11,140 --> 01:48:15,140
because the grading company is supposed to be, you know, separate.

1890
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:19,140
So like the guy that owns the grading company is actually in like on the board

1891
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:23,140
for the auction house or they're just like involved financially somehow.

1892
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:32,140
And so it it basically allows them to grade something slightly better than they would have if, you know,

1893
01:48:32,140 --> 01:48:37,140
since it's going on the site, it it's just not you watch the video.

1894
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:44,140
There's a lot of details, but it basically they're trying to artificially inflate the market so they can make some money.

1895
01:48:44,140 --> 01:48:48,140
And it's going to crash. Thank you so much, Jason, for the live crowd.

1896
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:53,140
I was just about to ask, can somebody point the post the link to the video so y'all can hit save and watch later?

1897
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:58,140
So Jason posted the link there in chat for those of you there on the podcast. Of course, you don't see the live chat.

1898
01:48:58,140 --> 01:49:04,140
But if you search YouTube for that user, Carl Jobst, J-O-B-S-T and it's Carl with a K.

1899
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:09,140
Yeah. Same thing's happening with Pokemon cards right now, too, with the Paul's.

1900
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:12,140
Oh, yeah. And why like Target, Wal-Mart and shit are pulling back on that.

1901
01:49:12,140 --> 01:49:20,140
Yeah, it's because it's all speculative and people are really into speculative gambling, marketing.

1902
01:49:20,140 --> 01:49:26,140
It's, you know, buying stuff that they think is going to have some value, even though it doesn't really have that value.

1903
01:49:26,140 --> 01:49:32,140
Perfect example. NFTs, you know, it's like these are going to be worth anything in a little bit.

1904
01:49:32,140 --> 01:49:37,140
But because there's a big boom on it right now, people are trying to make all sorts of money.

1905
01:49:37,140 --> 01:49:42,140
It sucks, though, because like, yeah, I'm trying to get like some games just to make a small collection for like the NES and stuff.

1906
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:48,140
But I'm buying Contra for $70. Sorry, I'll wait for the crash. Thank you very much.

1907
01:49:48,140 --> 01:49:53,140
Anyway, sorry, I know we went on. You could buy our Contra and actually it's worth more than 70.

1908
01:49:53,140 --> 01:49:59,140
Sorry, I know we went on a hell of a tangent train there, but I think it's an important follow up because we have been talking about those stories here on OLR.

1909
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:04,140
And so I think that and I think we've even been sitting here when talking about it going, it ain't worth that much.

1910
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:11,140
I think it's important to talk about that, follow up a little bit and give kudos to the folks that did the work there to really dig deeper there.

1911
01:50:11,140 --> 01:50:17,140
Anyway, haha. Rapid fire news. Haha. Did you have one more, Jamie, or did we get both? I'm sorry.

1912
01:50:17,140 --> 01:50:25,140
I did. OK, go ahead. I did. Also, though, I am announcing that Dan and I are actually legit going to be starting to sell off some of the collection.

1913
01:50:25,140 --> 01:50:32,140
Oh, wow. That's a big room. I mean, I had to sell some stuff, too, because we've got a big change coming.

1914
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:37,140
I will. I will. Some of you have figured it out, but I will talk more openly about it very soon.

1915
01:50:37,140 --> 01:50:43,140
I promise. Well, just know that there might be a master system in your future.

1916
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:51,140
Yay. All right. I'm always saying it like that because I'm like, I'm literally in the mindset of less stuff, not more stuff.

1917
01:50:51,140 --> 01:50:55,140
But I will. You always need a master system. It's true. You always need a master system. All right.

1918
01:50:55,140 --> 01:51:05,140
Anyway, please see your others. Rapid fire. Haha. Nickelodeon has confirmed DLC for All Star Brawl with some voice acting to come.

1919
01:51:05,140 --> 01:51:10,140
It's going to be two more characters in addition to the 20 that have already been announced.

1920
01:51:10,140 --> 01:51:15,140
There. Now it was rapid. All right. That was rapid. Good. All right.

1921
01:51:15,140 --> 01:51:25,140
Let's travel around the world. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games that are coming out a little sooner than the Nickelodeon All Stars and what have you.

1922
01:51:25,140 --> 01:51:29,140
Those sorts of games. Loki will start in the US. What's out this week?

1923
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:34,140
We have Kenna Bridge of Spirits on PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

1924
01:51:34,140 --> 01:51:39,140
World War Z Aftermath on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1925
01:51:39,140 --> 01:51:43,140
Pokemon Unite on iOS and Android.

1926
01:51:43,140 --> 01:51:51,140
Diablo 2 Resurrected on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.

1927
01:51:51,140 --> 01:51:58,140
Sable on PC, Mac and Xbox Series X. That game actually looks pretty awesome.

1928
01:51:58,140 --> 01:52:05,140
Staxel on Nintendo Switch. Death Stranding Director's Cut on PlayStation 5.

1929
01:52:05,140 --> 01:52:10,140
Dragon Ball Z Kakarot on Nintendo Switch.

1930
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:17,140
And Lost Judgment on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X.

1931
01:52:17,140 --> 01:52:19,140
That's it.

1932
01:52:20,140 --> 01:52:30,140
I have to admit, guys, I'm torn on the Diablo 2 thing. Like, I love Diablo. I want to support the employees that made that game, but it's tough.

1933
01:52:30,140 --> 01:52:32,140
Is it one of the Gamefast games?

1934
01:52:32,140 --> 01:52:40,140
No. What I think I'm going to do right now is I'm going to buy it after the first week.

1935
01:52:40,140 --> 01:52:48,140
Because a lot of the corporate stuff and the corporate numbers really want to tout those, like, day one sales and kind of like how the make or break is in the first week.

1936
01:52:48,140 --> 01:52:56,140
And so I feel like since that's all the business perspective, maybe if I skip the first week, then they can't use me in that statistic.

1937
01:52:56,140 --> 01:52:59,140
But then I can ultimately support the team by buying it a little late.

1938
01:52:59,140 --> 01:53:04,140
That's where my head's at right now. But I don't know. It's a complicated issue. What?

1939
01:53:04,140 --> 01:53:06,140
Devious.

1940
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:08,140
Oh, my little plan?

1941
01:53:08,140 --> 01:53:10,140
Yeah, it's a bit devious.

1942
01:53:10,140 --> 01:53:11,140
A little bit.

1943
01:53:11,140 --> 01:53:12,140
It's hard to talk with this thing in my mouth.

1944
01:53:12,140 --> 01:53:19,140
No, no, you're fine. You're fine. I thought you said BS at first. I was like, how dare you? But I was like, what part?

1945
01:53:19,140 --> 01:53:28,140
But maybe a little. I had to really think about that, though. But yeah, I kind of feel like, okay, the corporate stuff is all about that first week.

1946
01:53:28,140 --> 01:53:32,140
But I could support the team at a later date. And that's kind of where my brain's at right now.

1947
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:38,140
I'm not saying anyone else has to do what I do. I'm just talking about how I'm trying to approach this tricky situation.

1948
01:53:38,140 --> 01:53:42,140
So anyway, let's go to Japan.

1949
01:53:42,140 --> 01:53:48,140
Some folks in chat are suggesting Mike Deff says, buy it a month after. Maybe.

1950
01:53:48,140 --> 01:53:54,140
Dr. Tsuya says, yeah, I don't know if I'll be able to get it at launch. It's on my radar only because it's the one Blizzard franchise I'm interested in.

1951
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:59,140
S2100 Matt says, I wanted to play Overwatch on Switch badly, but the Hong Kong thing happened. I didn't get it.

1952
01:53:59,140 --> 01:54:03,140
Eventually, I forgot all about it and moved on because I had too many games to play.

1953
01:54:03,140 --> 01:54:09,140
And that's also a very realistic approach is that, you know, whether I wait a week, two weeks, a month to finally get it,

1954
01:54:09,140 --> 01:54:14,140
my brain might be like, oh, shiny and end up getting something else. I still have to get that WarioWare game.

1955
01:54:14,140 --> 01:54:20,140
Speaking of games, I didn't end up buying in the first week, but that wasn't that was just Rob's Busy than anything else.

1956
01:54:20,140 --> 01:54:22,140
You can wait.

1957
01:54:22,140 --> 01:54:28,140
I liked the demo. I liked I don't know anyway. All right. All right.

1958
01:54:28,140 --> 01:54:37,140
Excuse me. Let's talk about release dates and Japan and coming out this week on September the 24th.

1959
01:54:37,140 --> 01:54:44,140
No, I'm sorry. The 20. Do we have games coming out this week in Japan? I'm looking at the Nintendo Switch.

1960
01:54:44,140 --> 01:54:49,140
And what's a week from today would be the 20.

1961
01:54:49,140 --> 01:54:55,140
I don't know if there is anything out on the switch anyway. There's one Dragon Ball Z game out this week.

1962
01:54:55,140 --> 01:55:02,140
Is that the Kakarot? Yep. That same Kakarot game that's coming out in other territories is out this week in Japan as well on the switch.

1963
01:55:02,140 --> 01:55:06,140
Let me see if we have a big PlayStation 5 release. Oh, yeah.

1964
01:55:06,140 --> 01:55:12,140
OK, so we have Lost Judgment from Sega on the PlayStation 5 this week. That's coming out everywhere as well.

1965
01:55:12,140 --> 01:55:17,140
Oh, there you go. There's your big release Death Stranding Director's Cut. Is this week really?

1966
01:55:17,140 --> 01:55:22,140
Wow, that came that's that was fast. I thought that games still had a while to go.

1967
01:55:22,140 --> 01:55:24,140
So that's out this week in Japan. OK, that makes a lot more sense.

1968
01:55:24,140 --> 01:55:29,140
So they're they're dodging some of those big releases that are out on PlayStation 5 this week.

1969
01:55:29,140 --> 01:55:35,140
OK, so how about the UK Dark Sakura on the 21st?

1970
01:55:35,140 --> 01:55:40,140
We have World War Z Aftermath also coming out now.

1971
01:55:40,140 --> 01:55:46,140
The rest of these are all on the 24th. Spacebase Startopia on Switch.

1972
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:52,140
Ember Uber Firefighters, a game called Just Die Already.

1973
01:55:52,140 --> 01:56:03,140
Dragon Ball Z Kakarot. I have to say it right. The Addams Family Mansion Mayhem and Lost Judgment.

1974
01:56:03,140 --> 01:56:08,140
At Last Judgment, it's coming out everywhere. Indeed it is.

1975
01:56:08,140 --> 01:56:16,140
All right. I want to mention this other comment in chat from Quest Buster because I think it's really good.

1976
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:19,140
Quest Buster says about the Diablo 2 predicament I'm talking about.

1977
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:31,140
As a side note, Vicarious Visions did the heavy lifting on the Diablo 2 remake and issued a statement to judge for yourself on whether or not to support it.

1978
01:56:31,140 --> 01:56:40,140
That's a very good point is that, yeah, Vicarious Visions and Vicarious Visions is where we got Jen O'Neill, who is now one of the co-heads of Blizzard.

1979
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:44,140
That's a good point. That's worth considering Quest Buster. Thank you for sharing that.

1980
01:56:44,140 --> 01:56:48,140
Oh, SSJ 100 Matt with some breaking news.

1981
01:56:48,140 --> 01:56:56,140
Apparently, a Pogo player in Norway caught 98 shiny oshawott today.

1982
01:56:56,140 --> 01:57:06,140
Shane is not the world leader today. Flop. No, I'm just kidding. He should still be very proud. 98 is a lot. That's crazy.

1983
01:57:06,140 --> 01:57:13,140
So but unfortunately, Shane is not the very best like no one ever was. He got beat by some person in Norway.

1984
01:57:13,140 --> 01:57:21,140
Oh, well, maybe there's no agents. Maybe he has the most in the US, though.

1985
01:57:21,140 --> 01:57:28,140
There are still records to be considered. All right, let's move on. This next story.

1986
01:57:28,140 --> 01:57:34,140
This is actually sad. This next story. Big, big legend in gaming, right, Loki?

1987
01:57:34,140 --> 01:57:49,140
Yes. So Clive Sinclair has passed away at the age of 81, and he, of course, was, you know, he invented the ZX Spectrum.

1988
01:57:49,140 --> 01:57:55,140
ZX. Whatever. You know what? The ZX Spectrum. Fine.

1989
01:57:55,140 --> 01:58:08,140
Of course, also, you know, there's several other things he's worked on as well. The ZX 80, which launched in 1980, the Commodore PET.

1990
01:58:08,140 --> 01:58:17,140
Yeah, the ZX 81 as well. So, yeah, that's unfortunate that he passed away.

1991
01:58:17,140 --> 01:58:23,140
That was actually pretty recent. Yeah. Yes.

1992
01:58:23,140 --> 01:58:28,140
Well, a big heart cancer to start that. Yeah.

1993
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:36,140
You know, what's interesting is that when you so I know we talk about the ZX Spectrum or because the way we read our Z's, we oftentimes say the ZX Spectrum on this shore.

1994
01:58:36,140 --> 01:58:40,140
But actually, that whole device, if I'm not mistaken, was released.

1995
01:58:40,140 --> 01:58:48,140
Well, somebody validated this during Bobby's show when this came up. But that system was called the Sinclair here in the US.

1996
01:58:48,140 --> 01:58:56,140
It was but it was put out by Timex, who you might know from watches, had the license because, you know, in the 80s, everybody was getting into the computer, home computing stuff.

1997
01:58:56,140 --> 01:59:03,140
So it was the Timex Sinclair. And I think it was kind of like the value model. I think those computers were only about 100 bucks.

1998
01:59:04,140 --> 01:59:13,140
Now, keep in mind, that's in 1980s dollars. But still, when you consider the Commodore 64 was, I thought it was like four or $500.

1999
01:59:13,140 --> 01:59:18,140
But somebody in Bobby's chat was saying it was closer to $700. It probably depends when you bought it.

2000
01:59:18,140 --> 01:59:27,140
The Timex Sinclair was definitely the value device. I kind of think it showed that in its capabilities weren't quite up to the same level as Commodore 64.

2001
01:59:27,140 --> 01:59:39,140
However, I'm not being shady. There were just so many different types of systems in the 80s. And there were a lot of great games that came out of the Spectrum or the Sinclair, whatever you're looking at there.

2002
01:59:39,140 --> 01:59:44,140
I'm sorry, I need to go AFK. Smoosh is having a meltdown. I'll be right back.

2003
01:59:44,140 --> 01:59:45,140
Hi, Smooshy.

2004
01:59:45,140 --> 01:59:49,140
All right, I'll be right back, guys. Sorry. You need to buy time.

2005
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:50,140
All right, well.

2006
01:59:50,140 --> 02:00:02,140
So then aside from that, you know, also, which is pretty fun is apparently there's a direct correlation between the ZX Spectrum and GTA.

2007
02:00:02,140 --> 02:00:09,140
So basically, DMA Designs was a group of amateur Spectrum developers.

2008
02:00:09,140 --> 02:00:19,140
And then of course, they eventually created Lemmines and then later Grand Theft Auto and then later Rockstar North and later became evil.

2009
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:33,140
Fortunately, same same story. It's like Activision, you know, six degrees of GTA and independent developers out of their garage, you know, doing it because they need to have the industries back and then became evil.

2010
02:00:33,140 --> 02:00:39,140
Then they sold their souls. Everybody becomes evil at some point when they get big enough.

2011
02:00:39,140 --> 02:00:43,140
Well, that must be why we're not very big. We never got evil to become big.

2012
02:00:43,140 --> 02:00:48,140
We're just not evil. I'm a little evil. That cat's evil. Let me tell you. No, I'm just kidding. I don't know why.

2013
02:00:48,140 --> 02:00:50,140
What does Smooshy do this time?

2014
02:00:50,140 --> 02:00:58,140
He's sitting right there just howling, screaming his head off. And I don't know, he's eaten. I don't know what it is. I don't know if he's having litter box drama or what. It's just wild.

2015
02:00:58,140 --> 02:00:59,140
Rob.

2016
02:00:59,140 --> 02:01:00,140
What?

2017
02:01:00,140 --> 02:01:04,140
I am going to talk to you later about the stuff I give Midna to calm the fuck down.

2018
02:01:04,140 --> 02:01:06,140
Kitty Prozac?

2019
02:01:06,140 --> 02:01:09,140
I've called them her calm the fuck down treats.

2020
02:01:09,140 --> 02:01:13,140
Do they make marijuana for cats?

2021
02:01:13,140 --> 02:01:15,140
They make CBD.

2022
02:01:15,140 --> 02:01:17,140
OK.

2023
02:01:17,140 --> 02:01:19,140
Yeah. Yeah. All right.

2024
02:01:19,140 --> 02:01:23,140
Hey, look, hey, look, you have to make sure we all had to get through this pandemic somehow.

2025
02:01:23,140 --> 02:01:36,140
That's right. Well, no, no, no. I was I was going to say they also make this sort of airborne hormonal like pheromone thing for cats that's supposed to help with like angry hissy cats.

2026
02:01:36,140 --> 02:01:40,140
Interesting. But something like that might help chill anxiety.

2027
02:01:40,140 --> 02:01:41,140
I think he's having anxiety.

2028
02:01:41,140 --> 02:01:44,140
I know. And I don't know why he's he's.

2029
02:01:44,140 --> 02:01:46,140
I think he might be a little lonely.

2030
02:01:46,140 --> 02:01:48,140
Rob, what?

2031
02:01:48,140 --> 02:01:53,140
Cats can have the same psychological problems that humans do.

2032
02:01:53,140 --> 02:01:56,140
He has a panic disorder.

2033
02:01:56,140 --> 02:02:06,140
It doesn't matter how good they have it. You know, I have a really happy life and I still have, you know, depression and stuff from time to time.

2034
02:02:06,140 --> 02:02:17,140
But they but they do make you know, you should I mean, I know it's probably not going to be cheap, but take Mr. Smoosh in for a hormone check.

2035
02:02:17,140 --> 02:02:23,140
I've spent all the money, but maybe in, you know, in time when we have some money again, sure.

2036
02:02:23,140 --> 02:02:30,140
Or I want to take him to the kitty spa and get him that whole kitty massage and that whole stuff.

2037
02:02:30,140 --> 02:02:31,140
You know, be fun.

2038
02:02:31,140 --> 02:02:33,140
Midna would freak the fuck out.

2039
02:02:33,140 --> 02:02:38,140
But but I'll I'll find you the stuff that my friend uses for her cat.

2040
02:02:38,140 --> 02:02:41,140
I think it's just OTC stuff. So good to know.

2041
02:02:41,140 --> 02:02:44,140
Did you guys jump ahead at all or were you just buying time? No.

2042
02:02:44,140 --> 02:02:48,140
OK. We're talking about the the six degrees of GTA.

2043
02:02:48,140 --> 02:02:51,140
Oh, OK. Haven't heard of it.

2044
02:02:51,140 --> 02:02:56,140
All right. But I have heard of Final Fantasy 14 because I play an awful lot of it.

2045
02:02:56,140 --> 02:03:03,140
And they announced this week in a very lengthy stream some of the details for the upcoming expansion and Walker.

2046
02:03:03,140 --> 02:03:10,140
I'm not going to bore all of you that listen with the details, because if you're a fan of Final Fantasy 14, you probably picked up on some of the big stuff.

2047
02:03:10,140 --> 02:03:15,140
And if you're not a fan of Final Fantasy 14, I think seven hours of patch notes.

2048
02:03:15,140 --> 02:03:23,140
And well, they're not actually passionate, but usually like changes and things that are going on with heaven's work, like they basically drill down in.

2049
02:03:23,140 --> 02:03:25,140
This is what's going to happen to the machinist class.

2050
02:03:25,140 --> 02:03:29,140
And you caught when Shane was talking on the call, I kind of said what were his highlights.

2051
02:03:29,140 --> 02:03:35,140
And he mentioned like changes to the summoner class. One of the big ones being like now you don't summon many.

2052
02:03:35,140 --> 02:03:40,140
Well, you still summon the mini versions of things, but you can summon the big Garuda and the big free.

2053
02:03:40,140 --> 02:03:45,140
And there's actually reasons to make the big summons, which is, you know, Final Fantasy is supposed to be all about.

2054
02:03:45,140 --> 02:03:50,140
So that's pretty cool. So that's like one of the changes they were outlining.

2055
02:03:50,140 --> 02:03:56,140
And as much as I love the Final Fantasy 14 and they're very dedicated to what they do,

2056
02:03:56,140 --> 02:04:04,140
they're sometimes a little too detailed and a little too thorough with some of the things that they do and a little too apologetic for some of the things that they change.

2057
02:04:04,140 --> 02:04:12,140
I wish they'd learn a little rudeness from some of the developers over here or even Nintendo.

2058
02:04:12,140 --> 02:04:17,140
Don't apologize. Just just say this is the way it is and move on.

2059
02:04:17,140 --> 02:04:23,140
And so they they they did a seven hour stream and it went from I think it was only supposed to be four.

2060
02:04:23,140 --> 02:04:31,140
I think they joked at one point they were done with part one after three and a half hours of their four hour stream and they ended up going seven hours.

2061
02:04:31,140 --> 02:04:35,140
They started at seven Pacific time and they were going until two a.m. in the morning.

2062
02:04:35,140 --> 02:04:39,140
It's just a lot. But there's a lot of good stuff that's going to come in that next expansion.

2063
02:04:39,140 --> 02:04:43,140
Heaven's word. If you want to look at all the details, I encourage you to look at the highlight reel.

2064
02:04:43,140 --> 02:04:47,140
There was an 18 minute job action trailer. I did watch that.

2065
02:04:47,140 --> 02:04:51,140
And the moves look pretty and some of them look really fancy. It's pretty good.

2066
02:04:51,140 --> 02:04:55,140
So I'm hyped for the expansion. It comes out in November.

2067
02:04:55,140 --> 02:05:03,140
Heaven's word. Sacred Jade says the Final Fantasy 14 Blu-ray soundtrack Death Unto Dawn was released this past week as well.

2068
02:05:03,140 --> 02:05:08,140
Yeah, Shane had preordered that and was talking to me about that, except I guess he didn't get his copy of the soundtrack yet.

2069
02:05:08,140 --> 02:05:16,140
But one of my other friends got the vinyl, some Final Fantasy 14 vinyl and sent a video of him playing it on his record player.

2070
02:05:16,140 --> 02:05:20,140
I'm like, people actually play the vinyl records? I thought they just collected them.

2071
02:05:20,140 --> 02:05:25,140
Anyway, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

2072
02:05:25,140 --> 02:05:32,140
Well, a company that I am very fond of, Quantic Dream, is working on a new game and it's a Star Wars game,

2073
02:05:32,140 --> 02:05:37,140
which means it's going to have needlessly complicated controls to do everything in the game.

2074
02:05:37,140 --> 02:05:45,140
But yeah, it's been confirmed.

2075
02:05:45,140 --> 02:05:56,140
There was a French YouTuber named Gautoz who claimed that the company had signed a deal with Disney since it was done with Sony.

2076
02:05:57,140 --> 02:06:17,140
And it actually was corroborated by a reliable source, someone named Tom Henderson, who put a very cryptic Star Wars and Detroit Become Human mashup on Twitter.

2077
02:06:18,140 --> 02:06:25,140
And honestly, I would be here for it.

2078
02:06:25,140 --> 02:06:29,140
I mean, I don't think that Quantic Dream has made a bad game.

2079
02:06:29,140 --> 02:06:32,140
I mean, they just have, I think, the two, right?

2080
02:06:32,140 --> 02:06:38,140
Well, you haven't seen Star Wars Become Gungan, so that's still a possibility.

2081
02:06:38,140 --> 02:06:42,140
At any rate, I really do hope that this comes to pass.

2082
02:06:42,140 --> 02:06:51,140
It would be really exciting to see the kind of direction they would take it in, especially with their very complicated story systems.

2083
02:06:51,140 --> 02:06:56,140
I mean, do you know how many branching paths there are in Detroit?

2084
02:06:56,140 --> 02:06:58,140
It's pretty crazy.

2085
02:06:58,140 --> 02:07:01,140
The way that Dark Sakura completely ignored Loki's comment.

2086
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:06,140
And I will not validate that comment with this feedback.

2087
02:07:06,140 --> 02:07:07,140
I won't.

2088
02:07:07,140 --> 02:07:08,140
It's true.

2089
02:07:09,140 --> 02:07:12,140
Questbuster in chat says, Beyond Two Sith.

2090
02:07:12,140 --> 02:07:13,140
No.

2091
02:07:13,140 --> 02:07:14,140
Pretty good. Pretty good.

2092
02:07:14,140 --> 02:07:16,140
Y'all are funny. Y'all are comedians.

2093
02:07:16,140 --> 02:07:30,140
However, just going to say that Quantic Dream also was reported in 2018 by two French publications, Le Monde et Media Part,

2094
02:07:30,140 --> 02:07:38,140
that said that they had a very toxic work culture and had financial malpractice, but Quantic Dream sued both of those for defamation.

2095
02:07:38,140 --> 02:07:39,140
Oh, wow.

2096
02:07:39,140 --> 02:07:42,140
So there we go.

2097
02:07:42,140 --> 02:07:43,140
All right.

2098
02:07:43,140 --> 02:07:45,140
All right. A few more stories.

2099
02:07:45,140 --> 02:07:46,140
Oh, yeah. I found the other games.

2100
02:07:46,140 --> 02:07:51,140
It was Nomad Soul, Fahrenheit, Heavy Rain, Beyond Two Souls, Detroit Become Human.

2101
02:07:51,140 --> 02:07:52,140
All right.

2102
02:07:52,140 --> 02:07:56,140
We have a few more stories, and then we're going to get to the listener roundtable.

2103
02:07:56,140 --> 02:08:01,140
If anyone wants to call in, you can join our green room over on our Discord server, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

2104
02:08:01,140 --> 02:08:04,140
But first, a story from Loki.

2105
02:08:04,140 --> 02:08:05,140
Yes.

2106
02:08:05,140 --> 02:08:10,140
So there is a fan game that's been made for Among Us called Among Us Arena.

2107
02:08:10,140 --> 02:08:23,140
It is a fighting game and like a fighting game, you play as the different characters in the game and you kill each other with basically all the different kills that they have in Among Us.

2108
02:08:23,140 --> 02:08:32,140
And in a take that is not Nintendo, the company or the developers behind Among Us thought it was pretty funny.

2109
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:37,140
In fact, have like said that basically they're going to check it out as well.

2110
02:08:37,140 --> 02:08:43,140
But yeah, they're totally cool with it, as they should be.

2111
02:08:43,140 --> 02:08:45,140
It is free to play as well.

2112
02:08:45,140 --> 02:08:51,140
It's also it's also different when your studio is only three people, you know, and it's not.

2113
02:08:51,140 --> 02:08:56,140
You probably don't have as many complicated legal. You don't have a legal department when there's only three people at your company.

2114
02:08:56,140 --> 02:09:00,140
Well, I don't know if they've grown since they did Among Us. I imagine they probably have a little bit.

2115
02:09:00,140 --> 02:09:03,140
But, you know, originally it was three people. We all know that.

2116
02:09:03,140 --> 02:09:06,140
So, yeah. All right. One more story for you guys tonight.

2117
02:09:06,140 --> 02:09:10,140
And it's about prototypes. And these can be a lot of fun.

2118
02:09:10,140 --> 02:09:16,140
And Dark Soccer, I feel like some of this might be up your alley because, you know, unfinished Dreamcast stuff.

2119
02:09:16,140 --> 02:09:18,140
That's always kind of fun, right?

2120
02:09:18,140 --> 02:09:25,140
So what happened is that and of course, this thing isn't loading on my particular page over here, so I'm going to go off memory.

2121
02:09:25,140 --> 02:09:28,140
I hate it. If somebody wants to help me fill in here.

2122
02:09:28,140 --> 02:09:35,140
So what happened here is that this site and I think it's Hidden Palace that found all this or they got ties to it or whatever,

2123
02:09:35,140 --> 02:09:41,140
basically found a lot of prototypes for either the original Xbox or Dreamcast as well.

2124
02:09:41,140 --> 02:09:47,140
And so these are most of them are playable in emulators if you want to check it out or they even have.

2125
02:09:47,140 --> 02:09:53,140
You know, it's all questionable legality, but we are talking about systems that are way past their prime.

2126
02:09:53,140 --> 02:09:56,140
And this is more of a video game preservation type of thing, I think.

2127
02:09:56,140 --> 02:10:07,140
But what was of particular interest to me when I was looking through the archive myself is that there was Xbox versions of DDR UltraMix 1, 2, and 3.

2128
02:10:07,140 --> 02:10:10,140
There were prototypes of them that were available.

2129
02:10:10,140 --> 02:10:14,140
And that's pretty cool. Although I got to be honest, I was reading through some of the changes.

2130
02:10:14,140 --> 02:10:20,140
It didn't seem like there were a lot of changes. It just seemed like the early version of DDR UltraMix 1 was missing three songs.

2131
02:10:20,140 --> 02:10:24,140
Like they got some late licenses and that, which makes sense. It's kind of what I expected.

2132
02:10:24,140 --> 02:10:29,140
And then in UltraMix 3, there was like some language changes in the world.

2133
02:10:29,140 --> 02:10:34,140
I even forgot about that mode where you travel around the world and stuff that was in there.

2134
02:10:34,140 --> 02:10:39,140
And then like UltraMix 2, I don't think there was a lot like they changed some title screens and some things like that.

2135
02:10:39,140 --> 02:10:44,140
So you're not going to see like, oh, they cut these songs or a completely different, nah, it wasn't that juicy.

2136
02:10:44,140 --> 02:10:50,140
But there was some neat stuff in there. So it's interesting that, and I don't, was anyone able to pull the story up?

2137
02:10:50,140 --> 02:10:55,140
And how did they find this trove of discs? I don't, that part I don't remember.

2138
02:10:58,140 --> 02:10:59,140
Let's see.

2139
02:11:02,140 --> 02:11:03,140
I can figure that out.

2140
02:11:03,140 --> 02:11:06,140
I don't know where they found those discs, but yeah.

2141
02:11:06,140 --> 02:11:09,140
Yeah. Well, and sometimes the people don't want to be found.

2142
02:11:09,140 --> 02:11:15,140
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, to be fair, the Dreamcast is still getting homebrew stuff.

2143
02:11:15,140 --> 02:11:19,140
That's true, but we also have a lot of prototypes here of things that did come out.

2144
02:11:19,140 --> 02:11:24,140
And yeah, I noticed the Xbox prototypes, the UltraMix games, and Dark Tetsuya said this was neat.

2145
02:11:24,140 --> 02:11:28,140
Questbuster points out, I still love the Dreamcast startup sound.

2146
02:11:28,140 --> 02:11:30,140
Yes, there is that too.

2147
02:11:30,140 --> 02:11:31,140
Yeah.

2148
02:11:31,140 --> 02:11:33,140
The Dreamcast's in the first PlayStation.

2149
02:11:34,140 --> 02:11:37,140
Oh yeah, the first PlayStation one was iconic.

2150
02:11:37,140 --> 02:11:41,140
So this is all tied to something called, I was able to pull it up on my phone.

2151
02:11:41,140 --> 02:11:49,140
This is all something tied to something called Project Deluge, which was just something I guess this site has been working on, this hidden palace.

2152
02:11:49,140 --> 02:11:51,140
So they don't really say, oh, okay.

2153
02:11:51,140 --> 02:11:59,140
It's an ongoing project to archive and assess all of the items featured in a lot of video game development material that has been gathered over the course of many years.

2154
02:11:59,140 --> 02:12:10,140
This has been made possible through the dedication of only one extremely kind individual who has taken the heruculent task of dumping every single thing in the lot by themselves.

2155
02:12:10,140 --> 02:12:19,140
Each item in the lot was assessed by a team of dedicated individuals for playability and integrity on both software via emulation and hardware when necessary.

2156
02:12:19,140 --> 02:12:24,140
Each item was then lightly documented and given a general overview of some of the main interesting facts about the item in question.

2157
02:12:24,140 --> 02:12:29,140
I'm reading directly from that website hidden palace dot org on where this all came from.

2158
02:12:29,140 --> 02:12:33,140
So they're not quite saying directly, but it just sounds like sources.

2159
02:12:33,140 --> 02:12:38,140
And they've had a very generous individual who's found a lot of this stuff.

2160
02:12:38,140 --> 02:12:45,140
So I imagine somebody was in the know in the industry and had some stuff in their office that they took with them.

2161
02:12:45,140 --> 02:12:47,140
I bet I'm going to just guess.

2162
02:12:47,140 --> 02:12:50,140
OK, I don't know nothing about nothing.

2163
02:12:50,140 --> 02:13:03,140
A lot of this stuff, like when I was reading about the DDR UltraMix thing, the prototype for number three was slower and it actually had text on there that said, please be patient.

2164
02:13:03,140 --> 02:13:06,140
The retail version will not have these loading times or something like that.

2165
02:13:06,140 --> 02:13:21,140
That tells me these are probably all prerelease review copies from a day when you needed to have prototypes out to the outlets for five months in advance of release, because you needed that lead time to get it in the magazine.

2166
02:13:21,140 --> 02:13:25,140
Because the outlets had dev systems to be able to play those on.

2167
02:13:25,140 --> 02:13:26,140
Yes.

2168
02:13:26,140 --> 02:13:27,140
So my guess.

2169
02:13:27,140 --> 02:13:33,140
Also some of these though, they reference like the DDR economics preview version.

2170
02:13:33,140 --> 02:13:36,140
Like, wasn't that an event that they did as well?

2171
02:13:36,140 --> 02:13:37,140
I don't know.

2172
02:13:37,140 --> 02:13:42,140
Some of these tie within events that we may have attended.

2173
02:13:42,140 --> 02:13:58,140
So my big guess is that somebody in the industry that worked for a magazine and it may not have been the US, could have been Canada, could have been overseas, could have been anything, had a big collection of these review discs from over the years that they never got rid of.

2174
02:13:58,140 --> 02:14:00,140
And now we're all benefiting from that.

2175
02:14:00,140 --> 02:14:16,140
That's my, if I were to bet money, place chips on the roulette board of where this came from, I'm going to say, press reviewer from a time long forgotten when there were four month lead times to get games in magazines.

2176
02:14:16,140 --> 02:14:17,140
All right.

2177
02:14:17,140 --> 02:14:19,140
That all being said, yeah.

2178
02:14:19,140 --> 02:14:22,140
Questbuster in chat says, yay, preservation efforts.

2179
02:14:22,140 --> 02:14:23,140
It does make sense.

2180
02:14:23,140 --> 02:14:25,140
It says it makes sense.

2181
02:14:25,140 --> 02:14:27,140
Well, thank you for validating my crazy thinking.

2182
02:14:27,140 --> 02:14:29,140
But yeah, that just has to be what it is.

2183
02:14:29,140 --> 02:14:33,140
And but I completely respect the fact that this Hidden Palace site, they can't name who it is.

2184
02:14:33,140 --> 02:14:38,140
They don't, you know, because it is it is still a, you know, sure, all these games are old.

2185
02:14:38,140 --> 02:14:41,140
They're not going to, you know, sell the way they use.

2186
02:14:41,140 --> 02:14:45,140
I mean, I guess there's always I think some of them also could have been donated by the developers.

2187
02:14:46,140 --> 02:15:00,140
And that's that's true. Some of them could have, you know, like there are some game developers that kind of released their stuff to Mame, the multi arcade machine emulator, saying that you may use this.

2188
02:15:00,140 --> 02:15:03,140
And there's some who released who sent out the unfinished ones.

2189
02:15:03,140 --> 02:15:10,140
The one of the biggest ones I can think of is like their Robotech Crystal Dreams.

2190
02:15:10,140 --> 02:15:12,140
I remember when we were waiting for that game to come out.

2191
02:15:12,140 --> 02:15:20,140
That could be the case. But the reason why I'm placing my chips where I am is because you have a variety of different systems happening here.

2192
02:15:20,140 --> 02:15:23,140
It's not all coming from like one system, one source, one publisher.

2193
02:15:23,140 --> 02:15:30,140
So that that's why. But it could be I mean, they do kind of say it's one person's efforts, but it could be that maybe the donations came from.

2194
02:15:30,140 --> 02:15:32,140
Here's another hint too.

2195
02:15:32,140 --> 02:15:38,140
So I just kind of browsing through some of these different different games that are on here.

2196
02:15:38,140 --> 02:15:44,140
And for Powerstone, this is watermarked to one thousand eighteen thousand, which is tips and tricks.

2197
02:15:44,140 --> 02:15:51,140
Maybe these were copies that were sent out to different publications for like, you know, tip guides and stuff like that as well.

2198
02:15:51,140 --> 02:15:58,140
Absolutely. Why not? Didn't didn't our friends at pre-made? Are they still going pre-made games out in?

2199
02:15:58,140 --> 02:16:03,140
Oh, are they still? I mean, I don't I don't know. I better I better watch my mouth.

2200
02:16:03,140 --> 02:16:07,140
All right. I don't I don't know where they came from.

2201
02:16:07,140 --> 02:16:11,140
It's just sometimes you draw lines where you see connections.

2202
02:16:11,140 --> 02:16:15,140
OK, let's get to the listener roundtable.

2203
02:16:15,140 --> 02:16:20,140
I want to check in on the mailbag. I'm pretty sure dark soccer told me before the show there were no emails,

2204
02:16:20,140 --> 02:16:23,140
but it's a good chance for me to check in and I'm going to refresh.

2205
02:16:23,140 --> 02:16:27,140
OK, there's nothing. Participate at Orange Lounge, radio dot com.

2206
02:16:27,140 --> 02:16:32,140
If you want to send us an email in a future week, of course, we'll take questions in our chat room.

2207
02:16:32,140 --> 02:16:35,140
And I don't see anybody in our green room at the moment, but you never know.

2208
02:16:35,140 --> 02:16:38,140
Thank you, Dr. C. Is this Prima? If I recall correctly, they shut down.

2209
02:16:38,140 --> 02:16:42,140
That's what I thought, too. Yeah, I had a friend who used to write for them.

2210
02:16:42,140 --> 02:16:46,140
Yeah. And we we met them at one of those early E3s.

2211
02:16:46,140 --> 02:16:51,140
And we kind of always talked about like we should get together and have lunch because we're all in Sacramento.

2212
02:16:51,140 --> 02:16:55,140
What can we do for each other? But that didn't I mean, I can say that happened.

2213
02:16:55,140 --> 02:16:59,140
I can say that now because they're gone right one time and that like didn't happen.

2214
02:16:59,140 --> 02:17:02,140
Like they weren't there or something. Yeah, I remember driving over there.

2215
02:17:02,140 --> 02:17:06,140
Yeah, I remember. It's been so long. I remember something about that.

2216
02:17:06,140 --> 02:17:13,140
Yeah. What do you all think? The OLR strategy guide collab that never was.

2217
02:17:13,140 --> 02:17:19,140
OK, amongst many other ones that we've many other flopped collaborations over the year.

2218
02:17:19,140 --> 02:17:23,140
Perhaps we'll detail in a book that you can buy in stores someday.

2219
02:17:23,140 --> 02:17:30,140
The shit that didn't happen. The untold story. Orange Lounge fucked OVO.

2220
02:17:30,140 --> 02:17:35,140
How your favorite podcast was prevented from getting any bigger. All right.

2221
02:17:35,140 --> 02:17:39,140
No one special. Seventy seven in chat says roundtable question.

2222
02:17:39,140 --> 02:17:45,140
Do any of you ever hang on to old demo discs that came with gaming mags from back in the day?

2223
02:17:45,140 --> 02:17:49,140
If so, which ones? That's a great question. I don't know what we're just talking about.

2224
02:17:49,140 --> 02:17:52,140
Hold on to all of them.

2225
02:17:52,140 --> 02:18:01,140
They're in a bin. Yeah, I had like I was used to get like Xbox magazine stuff and you several the Xbox 360 demo discs in there.

2226
02:18:01,140 --> 02:18:10,140
I think I threw those out there when I end up leaving my last company because they were all at my desk and I wasn't using them for anything.

2227
02:18:10,140 --> 02:18:18,140
Or they're in a box. One of the two things. Yeah, I did a big purge as well with that stuff.

2228
02:18:18,140 --> 02:18:23,140
So I no longer have a lot of those discs. I have some, but not a lot.

2229
02:18:23,140 --> 02:18:32,140
I think I still have a jumping flash one, at least in a couple of Dreamcast ones and like an Xbox one.

2230
02:18:32,140 --> 02:18:36,140
So I used to take the PlayStation ones, though,

2231
02:18:36,140 --> 02:18:42,140
and rip music off of them because sometimes it would actually have a whole game's worth of information on it.

2232
02:18:42,140 --> 02:18:49,140
I think the reality for me is, too, is that a lot of those discs kind of exist on the Internet now, much like these prototypes we just talked about.

2233
02:18:49,140 --> 02:18:55,140
So like if I ever like had to see what was all of this, I could just download it from the Internet and emulate it.

2234
02:18:55,140 --> 02:18:59,140
That's the reality. I know that's not the same for most people. I respect that.

2235
02:18:59,140 --> 02:19:03,140
I understand some people are going to see the value in hanging on to them. I couldn't justify it anymore.

2236
02:19:03,140 --> 02:19:10,140
That's the problem. And Jason even in chat points out the digital form will likely be archive dot org.

2237
02:19:10,140 --> 02:19:16,140
And I'm sure most of them already do. And that's a follow up to another comment he said, saying I have a ton of PC gamer demo discs.

2238
02:19:16,140 --> 02:19:20,140
I just recently decided to start on a disc preservation archival project.

2239
02:19:20,140 --> 02:19:25,140
So I looked in some many, many years old media bins. I need to see where I can donate them.

2240
02:19:25,140 --> 02:19:32,140
Well. The archive dot org is definitely going to be probably a place where you'll find a lot of that stuff, so.

2241
02:19:32,140 --> 02:19:37,140
Good call. All right.

2242
02:19:37,140 --> 02:19:41,140
I don't see anything in the chat. Any other last minute stories, Loki, that you want to talk about?

2243
02:19:41,140 --> 02:19:47,140
Yeah, unfortunately, we had a Sega and Capcom artist pass away.

2244
02:19:47,140 --> 02:19:51,140
Mick McGinty. Mick McGinty.

2245
02:19:51,140 --> 02:19:58,140
He was famous for a lot of different cover arts of games that you may remember, like Street Fighter two.

2246
02:19:58,140 --> 02:20:03,140
He also did the artwork for all of the zoo type Coon games.

2247
02:20:03,140 --> 02:20:12,140
Streets of Rage 2, Kid Chameleon, Shining Force and Leisure Suit Larry.

2248
02:20:12,140 --> 02:20:19,140
So, yeah, he passed away peacefully, they said.

2249
02:20:19,140 --> 02:20:26,140
I'm looking at our Discord for some stories because you guys post stories throughout the week in Discord, and sometimes we don't get to all of them on the show.

2250
02:20:26,140 --> 02:20:29,140
But this is a good time for me to address some of them.

2251
02:20:29,140 --> 02:20:32,140
Apparently, we didn't I don't know why we forgot to bring this up on the show.

2252
02:20:32,140 --> 02:20:41,140
But apparently this G force now, which I talked about earlier in the show, they had a big leak that happened.

2253
02:20:41,140 --> 02:20:47,140
Which is interesting because there was a lot of titles on it where they're like things we have never heard of.

2254
02:20:47,140 --> 02:20:53,140
And Nvidia actually confirmed the leak is real, but the games are speculative.

2255
02:20:53,140 --> 02:20:56,140
That's what they're saying. So they're not they're saying there's no.

2256
02:20:56,140 --> 02:21:00,140
But that's what somebody who's trying to cover up a big fuck up would say, right?

2257
02:21:00,140 --> 02:21:06,140
Because seriously, these are the games that were in the list.

2258
02:21:06,140 --> 02:21:13,140
Final Fantasy nine remake Bioshock RTX remaster Resident Evil four remake.

2259
02:21:13,140 --> 02:21:15,140
Well, we all know that one's going to happen.

2260
02:21:15,140 --> 02:21:22,140
Halo five PC. I think that would happen to Grand Theft Auto trilogy.

2261
02:21:22,140 --> 02:21:30,140
Oh, what? They're going to remaster the Grand Theft Auto trilogy after DMCA striking all those people making content for the original trilogy.

2262
02:21:31,140 --> 02:21:36,140
Crisis four Half Life two remastered Injustice three and so on.

2263
02:21:36,140 --> 02:21:42,140
Nvidia said it was only for internal testing and that the games listed don't necessarily exist.

2264
02:21:42,140 --> 02:21:45,140
Sounds like some of course they don't try to cover up. That's right.

2265
02:21:45,140 --> 02:21:48,140
You didn't see anything here. Nothing happened here.

2266
02:21:48,140 --> 02:21:59,140
No, I think I think it is very possible that they just came up with a list of dummy titles that somebody came up with to just kind of test the interface of the software and all that stuff.

2267
02:21:59,140 --> 02:22:08,140
So but I, I, I think somebody was probably writing a fan list, but probably was like, yeah, Grand Theft Auto trilogy.

2268
02:22:08,140 --> 02:22:17,140
That'll happen like kind of like Logie saying, you know, like I'm going to make some educated guesses and, you know, a broken clock is still right twice a day, right?

2269
02:22:17,140 --> 02:22:23,140
Yeah. Yeah. Let's see.

2270
02:22:23,140 --> 02:22:26,140
Funcom bought the Conan IP.

2271
02:22:26,140 --> 02:22:32,140
The Age of Conan and Conan Exiles developer is now owned by Tencent. What's that?

2272
02:22:32,140 --> 02:22:35,140
And Conan O'Brien. Not that Conan.

2273
02:22:35,140 --> 02:22:44,140
They bought Cabinet Group, which Conan the Librarian, Detective Conan, held dozens of the intellectual properties like Conan the Barbarian, Mutant Year Zero and Solomon Kane.

2274
02:22:44,140 --> 02:22:47,140
Interesting.

2275
02:22:48,140 --> 02:22:54,140
All right. Some of the comments there from our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

2276
02:22:54,140 --> 02:23:02,140
Ooh, burn. Orange right in chat says, at least the list was somewhat realistic. Konami was missing.

2277
02:23:02,140 --> 02:23:06,140
They don't make games anymore. It's fine.

2278
02:23:06,140 --> 02:23:11,140
That should be the new title in the Mario is Missing series. Konami is missing.

2279
02:23:11,140 --> 02:23:15,140
All right. I think that's going to do it. We know right where Konami is and it ain't making games.

2280
02:23:15,140 --> 02:23:20,140
Yeah, it's it's living in the dumpster because they set their last dumpster. It's in that hoarder's house.

2281
02:23:20,140 --> 02:23:25,140
All right. With the roaches. We're going to wrap up the show for tonight.

2282
02:23:25,140 --> 02:23:29,140
Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking us out tonight.

2283
02:23:29,140 --> 02:23:34,140
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend about the show, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2284
02:23:34,140 --> 02:23:38,140
But, you know, if the voices aren't here, then we can't put them out on air.

2285
02:23:38,140 --> 02:23:42,140
So tell a friend about the show. Leave us a five star review on iTunes.

2286
02:23:42,140 --> 02:23:52,140
I'm still going to say a host on Twitch goes some of the way, although it sounds like due to some recent changes, hosting isn't quite as great as it used to be.

2287
02:23:52,140 --> 02:23:56,140
So I have to think of a way to reword this typical shout out I do at the end.

2288
02:23:56,140 --> 02:24:04,140
So I will just simply say we always appreciate a follow here on Twitch and spreading the word of our Twitch channel here at VOG Network as well is very helpful.

2289
02:24:04,140 --> 02:24:08,140
Also, I would be remiss not to mention it is September.

2290
02:24:08,140 --> 02:24:16,140
So if you wanted to get a subscription to VOG Network and access the archive feed of a couple of years now of O.L.R. and Bobby Blackwell's show as well as some bonus streams.

2291
02:24:16,140 --> 02:24:23,140
If you want to see you want to see Shane and I recap the best Pokemon of all time definitively.

2292
02:24:23,140 --> 02:24:27,140
That's one of the bonus streams available to our subscribers.

2293
02:24:27,140 --> 02:24:32,140
So you can check that out over at Twitch.TV slash VOG Network.

2294
02:24:32,140 --> 02:24:40,140
What else do I want to say here? Nice review goes a long way. All that stuff. Oh, the shop. VOG Network dot com slash shop.

2295
02:24:40,140 --> 02:24:52,140
If you are wanting to buy some merchandise such as an Orange Lounge Radio shirt or a VOG Network shirt or a Bobby Blackwell mug, there's lots of options available to you over at VOG Network dot com slash shop.

2296
02:24:52,140 --> 02:24:56,140
Maybe we'll put some new shit up in the coming months. We'll see.

2297
02:24:56,140 --> 02:25:01,140
I think that now that's everything. So I think we're ready to get to our final thoughts and wrapping it up.

2298
02:25:01,140 --> 02:25:08,140
Dark soccer is going to continue the party tonight live on Twitch with some dead by daylight. I'm sure she's going to do some very sweaty pig games.

2299
02:25:08,140 --> 02:25:12,140
I was actually watching a little bit dark soccer stream last night.

2300
02:25:12,140 --> 02:25:18,140
She got very excited when she got an RPD badge so that she could use it tonight for you all to play a sweaty, sweaty pig build.

2301
02:25:18,140 --> 02:25:22,140
Are you holding me to do resident piggy tonight, Rob?

2302
02:25:22,140 --> 02:25:26,140
I'm not holding you to do anything. But you did say last night you were going to do it.

2303
02:25:26,140 --> 02:25:38,140
I'm probably gonna resident. I just want to do it when I've I've got myself in the right mindset because last night I was playing kind of like potato.

2304
02:25:38,140 --> 02:25:42,140
Well, it happens. MMR has made the game weird anyway we're all getting used to it.

2305
02:25:42,140 --> 02:25:54,140
MMR. I don't. OK, so I found somebody linked a video that where apparently they data mined the MMR settings.

2306
02:25:54,140 --> 02:26:01,140
And I'm going to go back and read it later and read it, watch it a little bit later and see if I can figure some stuff out about it.

2307
02:26:01,140 --> 02:26:05,140
All right. Well, let me get your final thought, because I know you probably want to head out and get that started.

2308
02:26:05,140 --> 02:26:07,140
MMR is balls.

2309
02:26:07,140 --> 02:26:11,140
All right. Thanks for being here, Dark soccer. We'll see you next week.

2310
02:26:11,140 --> 02:26:13,140
Loki, your final thought.

2311
02:26:13,140 --> 02:26:16,140
My final thought is the cat won't stop screaming at me.

2312
02:26:16,140 --> 02:26:22,140
Yeah, I was having that same problem, too. So I, I, I took him into Alan and said, deal with it.

2313
02:26:22,140 --> 02:26:26,140
All right. It worked. All right.

2314
02:26:26,140 --> 02:26:31,140
My final thought is WarioWare. It's got to happen this week and hopefully I'll do some streaming.

2315
02:26:31,140 --> 02:26:36,140
My dad's belated birth. So my dad's birthday is always during Dragon Con now.

2316
02:26:36,140 --> 02:26:40,140
So I always seem to miss his birthday, sadly, but that just means we go out to dinner when we get back.

2317
02:26:40,140 --> 02:26:43,140
So we went out on Tuesday, so I couldn't stream on Tuesday night.

2318
02:26:43,140 --> 02:26:46,140
And then I had other plans on Friday, so I've actually been kind of busy.

2319
02:26:46,140 --> 02:26:50,140
And then I'm trying to support Alan doing streaming, so I don't like to do streaming on top of him.

2320
02:26:50,140 --> 02:26:53,140
We don't have the Internet or the resources for that anyway.

2321
02:26:53,140 --> 02:26:57,140
But I will try to stream either Tuesday or Friday this week and probably do some WarioWare.

2322
02:26:57,140 --> 02:27:02,140
And then maybe, maybe just a random Dead by Daylight stream of my own, just because I have fun playing the game.

2323
02:27:02,140 --> 02:27:06,140
Final Fantasy, we talked about that with Shane. So there'll be some randomness as well. We'll do that.

2324
02:27:06,140 --> 02:27:09,140
So that'll be for me over at twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts.

2325
02:27:09,140 --> 02:27:15,140
Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show or participating live.

2326
02:27:15,140 --> 02:27:20,140
However you participated with Orange Lounge Radio tonight, we appreciate you and we hope you all have a wonderful week.

2327
02:27:20,140 --> 02:27:24,140
We'll see you in seven days to do it again here on Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.

2328
02:27:37,140 --> 02:27:42,140
Sunday nights at 6 p.m. Pacific, 9 p.m. Eastern.

2329

2331
02:27:55,140 --> 02:27:57,140
See you next week.

2332
02:28:06,140 --> 02:28:10,140
