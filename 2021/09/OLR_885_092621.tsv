0	12860	Nintendo's reputation in making you rebuy games you already have isn't wrong, but
12860	16740	for those of us who never owned a Nintendo 64, the announcement of N64 games being added
16740	19060	to the Nintendo Switch Online service is thrilling.
19060	22700	Yours truly purchased an N64 controller within the last decade to make a statement about
22700	24940	GoldenEye on the N64 and N64 controllers.
24940	28700	Sadly, there's no telling if others will be making the same one anytime soon.
28700	30680	This is just one story about the return of our youths.
30680	33700	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about
33700	36420	this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every
36420	37420	gamer has a voice.
37420	38420	Hello, my friends back there on the internet.
38420	47420	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47420	55880	Orange Lounge Radio is live once again tonight with episode number 885 of our show for this
55880	59260	September the 26th of 2021.
59260	64800	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me, although she's having some webcam problems on Twitch
64800	69080	tonight, we can still hear her and that's the important part for Orange Lounge Radio.
69080	71360	Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
71360	72360	Hello.
72360	73360	Hi, how are you?
73360	74360	Oh, hello.
74360	75360	Hi, how are you?
75360	76360	I'm all right.
76360	77360	Yeah.
77360	81000	I've had a decent day, although I'm a little sleepy.
81000	83060	I woke up too early this morning.
83620	90460	I tried to nap today and without giving away where I live, you all know I'm in the Sacramento
90460	95160	area because we all are, but they're doing a freaking air show not far from here.
95160	96160	And those planes-
96160	97160	How rude.
97160	99780	Those planes love to break the sound barrier during those air shows.
99780	102260	I still understand why they have to fly over the neighborhoods.
102260	103260	Why can't they-
103260	104320	Why didn't they consult you first?
104320	105320	There's nothing.
105320	106320	Yeah.
106320	107320	Why didn't they consult me first?
107320	108880	Why can't they fly over like Slough House?
108880	110960	There's nothing but dust out there in a cemetery.
110960	111960	Go fly over that.
111960	113180	Why do you have to fly over the neighborhoods?
113180	114180	I hate it.
114180	119180	Anyway, I hope you got a nap because I sure didn't.
119180	120180	No.
120180	123260	Oh, well, that makes two of us grumpy grumpy.
123260	124260	Yeah.
124260	127620	Tomorrow is going to be when I'll really need the nap and can't have one.
127620	128620	Oh, yes.
128620	131220	Why don't you plug your big event tomorrow?
131220	135180	We know we got to mention it at some point tonight, so let's do it at the top.
135180	136180	All right.
136180	142360	At seven o'clock Pacific time on my channel, which is DarkSakura underscore O-L-R on Twitch,
142360	149560	I am doing my very first subathon and I would love it if people can join in and hang out.
149560	153080	That's p.m., seven p.m. Pacific time.
153080	158280	I will be going 12 hours and depending on how many subs I get determines how long I'm
158280	160080	going to keep going.
160080	163160	So yes, your typical subathon start in the morning.
163160	164880	So this is very interesting.
164880	165880	You're going to do an all-nighter.
165880	170620	I'm going to do an all-nighter and I wanted to start something earlier in the day, but
170620	179660	I have a Cairo appointment, so I'm starting it in the afternoon so that I can get more
179660	184100	of my night owl people because there's some people, but the thing is, is that I'm going
184100	188860	to be with me stopping at seven in the morning.
188860	200140	It's still 10 o'clock East Coast and I'll probably still be going because I'm probably
200140	202080	just going to be stubborn and keep going.
202080	204260	Well, good luck.
204260	207160	That's going to be a lot of hours.
207160	211160	Just the overnight is very, but I guess you've done it before.
211160	214360	I'm a night owl anyway, so it'll be fine.
214360	216420	And there will be a couple of breaks here and there.
216420	225480	But also to point out, I have posted the goals and the prizes, the rewards.
225480	230780	I will be doing a giveaway of, at a certain number, I will be doing a giveaway of one
230780	237320	of my Death Hook for Cutie shirts and a sticker.
237320	242760	And if I hit 300 subs, I will play a survivor game.
242760	246180	Which is something you've never done outside of a bot match, right?
246180	247180	Pretty much.
247180	248180	All right.
248180	249180	All right.
249180	250180	Well, good luck.
250180	252860	Break a leg, or I should say, break some survivor legs tomorrow.
252860	256880	I'll get the link and post it in chat for right now.
256880	261600	I would love some support because this is like a big push for me.
261600	264060	It's kind of a me putting myself out there kind of thing.
264060	265060	All right.
265060	266060	Good luck.
266060	272540	It's a crazy timeframe in a way, but that's a great for our folks that are overseas a
272540	273540	great chance.
273540	274540	Oh yeah.
274540	275540	Yeah.
275540	276540	Yeah.
276540	280420	During the day and across the seas in the UK and Australia, it's a huge prime time for
280420	281420	Australia.
281420	282420	So.
282420	287220	Well, and if anyone wants to hop on a VPN and let me kill them when I do kill your friends,
287220	288740	then we'll know.
288740	289740	We'll see.
289740	290740	All right.
290740	294860	Also joining us, who I do not think will be staying up all night long this week, say hello
294860	295860	to Techmaster Loki.
295860	301540	If I will, it won't be to get subs.
301540	306420	It'll be because the kids and the cat are collectively screaming, right?
306420	307980	Uh, yeah.
307980	310420	Uh, how are you doing?
310420	311420	I'm doing fine.
311420	313820	Uh, is that excite truck behind you tonight?
313820	314820	No.
314820	315820	Oh, what is it?
315820	318420	I'm trying to tell motor storm apocalypse.
318420	320920	Oh, why that one?
320920	322220	Because that's my favorite one.
322220	323220	Oh, okay.
323220	324220	Okay.
324220	325220	Out of the motor storm series.
325220	326220	All right.
326220	327220	Fair enough.
327220	328220	Yeah.
328220	334100	Those earthquakes, meteors, uh, Paris, I guess is like an apocalypse thing.
334100	335100	All right.
335100	336100	It was a pretty cool game though.
336100	337100	All right.
337100	338100	Like buildings falling over.
338100	339100	All right.
339100	340660	I have to admit, I haven't played it.
340660	341780	It's one of those things.
341780	343660	Hopefully they release a collection at some point.
343660	344780	That would be nice.
344780	346620	They really need the remaster of that series.
346620	347620	It would be so good.
347620	348620	Yeah.
348620	350180	We've been getting a lot of weird remasters lately.
350180	352540	It'd be nice to get something for that for sure.
352540	353540	All right.
353540	354540	Uh, let's get it.
354540	357860	Speaking of remasters, I know we had some that were mentioned at the Nintendo direct
357900	362060	this week, and I want to get into the kickoff topic, which is, I mean, this has really dominated
362060	366220	the news this week is that Nintendo direct that they sprung on us, um, for Thursday,
366220	367220	right?
367220	368220	It was on Thursday.
368220	370420	The days just blend together at this point.
370420	375200	And um, I don't know about you guys, but I had kind of set the bar low for this because
375200	380100	I figured that Nintendo had pretty much already revealed, um, their holiday stuff.
380100	383820	And, you know, between, you know, WarioWare and Metroid, there really wasn't a lot more.
383820	386340	I kind of figured we were getting all of it at E3.
386340	387860	So my expectations were kind of low.
387860	395140	I thought it was going to be, uh, the Game Boy rumor for the back, for the, um, backwards
395140	399460	compatible stuff, which didn't, nope, that missed the mark, didn't it?
399460	404100	So, um, although, you know, those, those same rumor, people are like, oh no, it's still
404100	407660	coming, but I don't, whatever, we'll, we'll put that to rest for now.
407660	411140	I thought that was going to be like the big thing is that they were going to do a push
411140	416020	for the, um, Nintendo switch online because a lot of people's renewals are right around
416020	417020	now.
417020	418500	Mine just renewed like last week.
418500	422500	So I figured, I thought there might be another 99 thing or something, or, you know, some
422500	425700	more, uh, and, and sure Nintendo switch online did come up.
425700	426700	We'll get into that.
426700	432200	But, uh, as far as the other things that were announced, I, I was tickled.
432200	434540	Like this was a great direct for me.
434540	437660	There were two games in this direct that got announced.
437660	444180	One of them that was released that day, I never thought we'd see games in those series.
444180	447060	I just kind of wrote those serious office dead and gone.
447060	449580	Um, so for me, I was giddy.
449580	451660	I was giddy at Nintendo direct this week.
451660	453220	I don't know how you guys felt.
453220	454500	I had a great direct.
454500	457100	Loki, why don't you get into the recap?
457100	461420	What were some of the things that were discussed in the direct and we'll kind of, since, um,
461420	464340	we have extra time tonight for the kickoff thought that we can kind of break it down
464340	465740	and talk about each one.
465740	466740	Yeah.
466740	470840	So there was a lot of things that we saw just like kind of new trailers for, so they gave
470840	473880	us more in depth look at Metroid Dread.
473880	479640	So it's all set on, uh, basically one planet with lots of different like biomes and stuff
479640	480640	in there.
480640	484280	Definitely reminded me a lot of like super Metroid, that type of thing.
484280	488320	So, um, it looks good and that's weeks away at this point, right?
488320	492060	It's early October, October 8th, but like two weeks away, two weeks away.
492060	495600	So, um, yeah, not surprised to see that show up in the direct.
495600	500920	It's very common for Nintendo to push the games that are upcoming around that week and
500920	503720	even things that may have just released in the last two weeks.
503720	506440	They'll still kind of, excuse me, still kind of push those in the direct.
506440	511000	So I was not surprised to see that at all, but I mean, as if I wasn't going to get it
511000	512000	anyway, but sure.
512000	513560	Maybe some people were still on the fence.
513560	514560	Yeah.
514560	523080	Uh, we had a, uh, new, uh, trailer for Splatoon three, I guess, uh, return of the mammalian.
523080	524080	Yeah.
524080	525080	They actually showed a little gameplay.
525080	526080	Now.
526080	530080	It looks like we got a special title or anything seemed to be the big thing.
530080	531080	Looks interesting.
531080	535480	So, um, they, they showed off a bit more gameplay there and kind of explained a little bit of,
535480	536680	you know, what the game was like.
536680	537840	So that's pretty cool.
537840	540200	Um, that's coming next year.
540200	544800	That seems to be rushing along pretty quick, uh, compared to some other Nintendo reveals,
544800	546800	one of which was also in the direct.
546800	548040	You all know what I'm talking about.
548040	553240	Probably we'll get there, but, uh, but, uh, I was just surprised to see Splatoon three
553240	554800	gameplay that quickly.
554800	556380	Um, but great.
556380	557880	I think that's, that's awesome.
557880	561200	Um, Mike Deft is in our chat and I should of course say we do tape live every Sunday
561200	565160	night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv
565160	569260	slash vog network, VOG network, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
569260	573420	And Mike Deft is in our chat saying the return of the mammalian is the title for the single
573420	574420	player campaign.
574420	582040	And I'll go so far as to say the first non DLC single player campaign, cause we all know
582040	587120	there'll be another one, uh, bonds double six is asking, Rob, did you squeal?
587160	590160	I sure, you know, I couldn't watch it live.
590160	594600	I, uh, I have daily meetings at work at three o'clock every day and I can't miss them.
594600	599080	Um, so I actually had to wait until four to watch.
599080	603680	Um, but I was very good about not spoiling myself and I watched it and I started doing
603680	604680	notes and everything.
604680	606440	I was going to post my notes on Twitter.
606440	610440	And by the time certain things were announced, I, I threw it out the window because I was
610440	613840	like, I'm just filling up the screen with ease.
614840	623560	Oh, I've got, um, uh, we got another trailer for triangle strategy, uh, which is now out
623560	627600	March 4th, 2022 is still a terrible name for that game.
627600	628600	I'm sorry.
628600	633520	I know it project triangle is now triangle strategy, starring triangle man triangle.
633520	634520	You don't know.
634520	635520	It sounds like it was funny.
635520	639760	It's like project triangle strategy sounds like some someone trying to discuss like a
639760	640760	business plan.
640760	650000	It's not an MLM, but it is an MLM triangle strategy pyramid scheme.
650000	651360	Hey out there on Facebook.
651360	656640	I just need 10 people who want to be their own boss to message me to talk about the triangle
656640	657640	strategy.
657640	661600	What if that's actually what the game's about is trying to get like people signed up for
661600	663160	an MLM or something like that.
663160	664160	Yeah.
664160	665160	I think it's interesting.
665160	667040	Um, but yeah, that's, that's coming along.
667040	670600	Uh, we got the announcement of a Castlevania advanced collection.
670600	671600	Yay.
671600	672600	That was excellent.
672600	673760	I mean, not a surprise.
673760	674760	We knew that was coming.
674760	675760	Yeah.
675760	677660	Like we all kind of figured that was in the direct cause hello, we've had leaks and leaks
677660	683480	and leaks of that thing, but, uh, Dracula X being in it, that was a surprise.
683480	684480	That's what interests me.
684480	685480	Yeah.
685480	686480	Right.
686480	687480	I bought it.
687480	693960	I already bought it, but I bought it on Xbox because I wanted, uh, I wanted to, I wanted
693960	694960	it on my TV.
694960	695960	Run.
695960	696960	Well, yeah.
697320	701440	Let's let's I'll talk about later why I'm learning that I really need to think about
701440	702760	the systems I buy things on.
702760	703760	We'll get into that later.
703760	704760	Yeah.
704760	710520	So let's talk about that right now with, uh, the surprise announcement for act razor Renaissance.
710520	713640	That was a remaster of the original act razor game.
713640	718840	That's out on, uh, switch steam PlayStation four and mobile devices.
718840	720480	And that was a surprise.
720480	721840	Uh, yeah.
721840	727640	Like act razor is like a super Nintendo, like, I guess you could say cult favorite of mine,
727640	731920	like a game I really hold near and dear to my heart, a game that my friend and I stayed
731920	733580	up all night long.
733580	739000	We had a dark soccer subathon night over the weekend and stayed up all night and played
739000	740440	through the entirety of act razor.
740440	741440	Cause that game is amazing.
741440	745880	Um, and if you don't know act razor, it's, um, and it's kind of a theme.
745880	748840	I feel like with these retro games that I used to love, right.
748840	751280	I never shut up about the guardian legend.
751280	752280	Right.
752280	756160	Um, and that's, I think the reason why that game is so fucking good is it blends a shooter
756160	761480	with a like, um, adventure style game, kind of like Zelda ish.
761480	763840	It blends those two genres together very well.
763840	768760	And I think one reason I really liked act razor is that it blends the, um, uh, kind
768760	772960	of side scroller action game with a SIM game.
772960	776320	And it would, the music in that game is phenomenal.
776320	779760	Yuzo Koshiro did the soundtrack, which, you know, that's a, you know, that, know that
779760	784640	name from like streets of rage series and, you know, some other, um, uh, when, uh, midnight
784640	788000	Wangan maximum tune, I'm probably get those words all mixed up, but you know, one of those
788000	790520	racing games that Namco did, I think you got it right.
790520	791520	Did I?
791520	792520	Okay.
792520	793520	Yay.
793520	794520	Um, one gone midnight maximum.
794520	795520	That's it.
795520	796520	Um, so he did, he did all that.
796520	799960	Uh, he even did a DDR song for those that, you know, have been following.
799960	805580	That was a big deal deal when Yuzo Koshiro did a DDR song, just saying, um, anyway, my
805580	813300	point is there was an ActRaiser 2, and for whatever reason, they deleted the SIM part
813300	814300	of the game.
814300	816300	And so it was just the action part.
816300	818100	I don't know why they did that.
818100	823260	Um, but that game did not get the same love that the first game got.
823260	826180	Um, so that was the end of ActRaiser.
826180	830680	And as far as I could tell that series was never coming back.
830680	833140	When was the last time Quintet made a game?
833500	838780	I mean, I think they've had some smaller games in the early aughts, but that was about it.
838780	843300	So the fact that also, I want to point out when you launch, cause you know, I bought
843300	846100	this fucking game and then five minutes in the announcement, as soon as I could on the
846100	849720	store, when you launched the game, it said it's Square Enix.
849720	853660	So they put, and in the credit, it says Quintet slash Square Enix.
853660	858300	Do you mean to tell me, I don't know if that's just like a it's originally Quintet or whatever,
858300	861420	or if they actually reformed the old band.
861420	868760	Because if Quintet is back together, um, do you know that this increases the chances immensely
868760	871620	of a Soul Blazer trilogy remaster?
871620	876500	You want to talk about things that are gonna like really get me to type the letter E in
876500	877700	caps.
877700	880580	Let's talk about a remaster of the Soul Blazer trilogy.
880580	883780	Cause if you ever played those games on Super Nintendo, those games are fucking incredible.
883780	887780	Um, that Soul Blazer Illusion of Gaia was the most well known cause Nintendo published
887780	890860	that one, uh, here in the U S and that was the second game.
890860	894460	And then Terra Nigma never came out in the U S um, cause Nintendo wasn't interested in
894460	895460	publishing it.
895460	902100	Um, so like, if that is where we're going, Oh my God.
902100	905820	Like I know a lot of people out there were like, why couldn't they do Chrono Trigger
905820	907620	or Chrono Cross?
907620	908900	Why didn't Square Enix do that?
908900	914300	Look, I, and honestly it's a fair call out, why, why won't they revisit Chrono Trigger
914300	915300	or Chrono Cross?
915300	918300	I kind of think they're coming.
918300	922900	I think they're going to happen, but it's just not what's happening right now.
922900	923900	Anyway.
923900	924900	I'm sorry, Loki.
924900	925900	What else did you want to say?
925900	926900	I could talk a lot about this.
926900	927900	No.
927900	933620	Um, speaking of another surprise announcement also from Square Enix, a sequel or spiritual
933620	939620	successor to Chocobo racing with Chocobo GP that's coming to the switch as well.
939620	942140	So that's a surprise.
942140	944780	I never thought we'd get another one of those games.
944780	945780	Yes.
945780	949820	I never thought we'd like with, cause that was the first one, not the first one in the
949820	953820	direct, but that was the first one to come up to make me go, what?
953820	957660	Like I lit like, and you know, sometimes we type like LOL when we're not actually laughing
957660	961300	out loud, but like I literally gay gasped.
961300	962300	Okay.
962300	964900	And you all know the gay gasp, right?
964900	969900	Like I did that when I saw the Chocobo GP, which I just was like, Oh my God, I thought
969900	972340	originally it's just, Oh, they're doing Chocobo racing on the switch.
972340	975740	Like they rebastered Chocobo racing for the switch, like, but it turns out it's a whole
975740	976740	new game.
976740	981140	Um, and I'm thrilled cause I love that game on PlayStation.
981140	983060	Yeah.
983060	984580	So that was pretty surprising.
984580	989940	Uh, we got a brand new Kirby game called Kirby and the forgotten land, which also ended up
989940	994260	leaking before the direct, but, and that's when Mike Deft did the gas, but that I could
994260	995860	hear all the way over here.
995860	1001220	So that, that game looks pretty much like a Kirby done this, you know, uh, Mario Odyssey
1001220	1002220	style.
1002220	1007340	So that's pretty awesome looking actually, and that's coming out April, 2022.
1007340	1013660	It's like some weird, um, post-apocalyptic looking game, which is kind of interesting.
1013660	1015940	Bobby Blackwell and chat calls it the last of Kirby.
1015940	1018360	Uh, and then Mike Deft says it got leaked.
1018360	1019860	So he did the gasp in the morning.
1019860	1023260	So I didn't know, I didn't know the whole thing Ali work had me really busy that day.
1023260	1024260	So I guess that's a good thing.
1024260	1028380	I was able to kind of avoid all the leaks, but the Kirby thing struck me very much as
1028380	1032960	like a Mario, um, Mario three D all stars.
1032960	1034980	The one that's not like, you know what I mean?
1034980	1037220	Like the 2.5 D you know, it's like, you know what I mean?
1037220	1042540	The one that was on 3DS, that one, like it, it strikes me as like that, but Kirby.
1042540	1044580	And I, I thought it looked cool.
1044580	1046420	Yeah, it looks pretty cool.
1046420	1047420	I'll get it.
1047420	1048420	I probably will get it.
1048420	1055220	Uh, we got some new footage and, um, talk about Bayonetta three.
1055220	1059860	Which I'm sure everyone was very excited about since it's been so long, uh, it's still coming
1059860	1060860	out next year though.
1060860	1061860	At some point.
1061860	1065760	Yeah, that was a big, I mean, that was the last thing they showed basically.
1065760	1069100	That was a huge, well, I mean, it's kind of one of those things when they showed it, like,
1069100	1071660	I think I literally said out loud, it's about time.
1071660	1075300	Um, but I think most of us had figured they probably weren't going to show it, uh, for
1075300	1076300	a while.
1076380	1080700	And also it was that whole thing about, I don't think people were expecting this direct
1080700	1082420	to be that loaded.
1082420	1086060	Like our, you know, and that's probably a good thing for once we all approached to direct
1086060	1089580	with a pretty low bar and I think we got very rewarded for it.
1089580	1093420	So the Bayonetta three footage was a huge surprise, a nice surprise.
1093420	1094420	It looks great.
1094420	1099140	A lot of people speculating there's some crossover in that Bayonetta three, that this might be
1099140	1102020	a, uh, a universe kind of game.
1102020	1105660	So it could be interesting to see how that plays out because when the footage first showed
1105700	1109100	up, people were like, holy fuck, it's astral chain coming back.
1109100	1110780	And then, oh, it's okay.
1110780	1117580	Bayonetta is still cool, but boo, I wanted a new astral, well, maybe worlds are colliding.
1117580	1118580	We'll see.
1118580	1119580	We'll see.
1119580	1121500	Mike Deft calls it a platinum verse.
1121500	1122500	Yeah, absolutely.
1122500	1127500	Uh, DJ Rama S in chat says Bayonetta three featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry series.
1127500	1130700	Well, there was a gentleman that showed up at the end.
1130700	1131900	Some were saying it was Dante.
1131900	1138300	I don't know if I particularly see that, but, um, I think that's very interesting.
1138300	1139940	So, yeah.
1139940	1140940	Right.
1140940	1147820	Um, then we also got, um, the announcement that there's going to be an expansion pass
1147820	1152180	for an online service DLC for an online service.
1152180	1153180	Gotta love that.
1153180	1159720	Um, and so that's going to be in the form of the Nintendo 64 and Genesis games coming
1159720	1163960	to Switch Online for an additional fee that we haven't discussed yet what that fee is
1163960	1164960	necessarily.
1164960	1170060	Um, but we have the announcements coming late October.
1170060	1175920	They're going to launch with, uh, Super Mario 64, uh, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Mario
1175920	1183300	Kart 64, Winback, Star Fox 64, Mario Tennis, uh, Yoshi's Story, Dr. Mario 64, and Sin and
1183300	1184600	Punishment.
1184600	1187920	And then there's going to be additional games coming out later on.
1187920	1194200	Like I think they showed like, uh, or Pokemon Snap in there and, um, gosh, I'm trying to
1194200	1196760	think of some of the other games that were in there real quick.
1196760	1204160	Um, but yeah, oh, uh, Kirby 64, the Crystal Shards, Paper Mario, Banjo-Kazooie, uh, Majora's
1204160	1212740	Mask, F-Zero X, and, uh, Mario Golf were the other ones that were shown off as coming soon.
1212740	1216760	Then they also, uh, showed off the Genesis games in that collection.
1216760	1222960	So you've got Castlevania Bloodlines, Contra Hardcore, uh, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine,
1222960	1230160	Echo the Dolphin, Golden Axe, Gunstar Heroes, M.U.S.H.A., Fantasy Star 4, um, ReStar, uh,
1230160	1237280	Shining Force, Shinobi 3, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, 3 Star Rage 2, and Strider, uh, the...
1237280	1243080	Did anyone else have a very big, like, Keanu Reeves in the early Matrix movies, whoa, moment
1243080	1248540	when the Genesis stuff is appearing, like, and maybe we're all desensitized to it now
1248540	1255120	from Mario and Sonic the Olympics, but I mean, to see Sega Genesis is part of the enhanced
1255120	1260440	Nintendo package, it, it definitely gave me a, whoa, kind of moment, like, damn.
1260440	1263240	It would have given me a moment like that when I was 15.
1263240	1267600	Right, like, well, like, like, go back, go back and show that footage to my 15-year-old
1267600	1272600	self and see what happens, right, like, I come from the future, and guess what?
1273120	1277080	Sega's gonna basically be a part of Nintendo's Plus subscription, it's, it's pretty wild.
1277080	1281080	I would have had that reaction all up until about 2003.
1281080	1286600	Yeah, so, I, I still think it's weird, it's, I'm not, like, surprised or something, it's
1286600	1288600	just, it's like, oh, I wasn't expecting that.
1288600	1290600	It's unexpected to your sensibilities.
1290600	1292600	Yes, yes.
1292600	1297600	They're also gonna be selling probably Impossible to get, um, wireless controllers for the N64
1297600	1302600	and Sega Genesis, all for $50 each, but of course you have to be a member of.
1302600	1305600	Maybe, maybe, I'm sorry, Logi, that's the part that did it.
1305600	1308600	The Sega Genesis controller for my Nintendo system.
1308600	1310600	That's, that's what broke me.
1310600	1312600	That was the dot in Jeremy Bearimy.
1312600	1314600	That was the part that broke me.
1317600	1318600	Anyway.
1318600	1321600	I have a big problem with this, of course.
1321600	1326600	Um, I think I don't like the fact that this is gonna be an additional fee that I have
1326600	1332600	to pay on top of the Nintendo online service, because honestly, I don't think it's worth
1332600	1333600	it.
1333600	1335600	It's not worth it for me to constantly pay for these.
1335600	1338600	I'd rather just pay a flat fee for the collection.
1338600	1342600	Hell, you can probably pay a flat fee for that collection of at least the Genesis games.
1342600	1345600	Yeah, I was gonna say that Genesis, it's.
1345600	1346600	Honestly.
1346600	1347600	That collection exists.
1347600	1348600	Yeah.
1348600	1354600	Like, why don't they just create the Nintendo, those Nintendo classic collections, sell them
1354600	1359600	for $60 much like they would with hardware, but just don't sell it with the hardware.
1359600	1361600	Just have it as a collection.
1361600	1363600	You buy it and it has the menu interface done.
1363600	1364600	There you go.
1364600	1368600	Because when they piecemealed it before everybody said they should do Netflix and now they're
1368600	1370600	doing Netflix and everybody says go back to piecemeal.
1370600	1372600	So like on that side.
1372600	1376600	Because their Netflix service sucks because they don't have any titles on their Netflix
1376600	1377600	services.
1377600	1378600	The problem.
1378600	1381600	You can't have Netflix if you don't have, if you have like 10 videos on there.
1381600	1384600	Like you gotta have more content that's available on there.
1384600	1385600	That's why people are complaining.
1385600	1388600	It's like, hey, you haven't updated your service for a long time.
1388600	1390600	Now we're like, we want more money to update our service.
1390600	1391600	Well, what is.
1391600	1392600	Sorry.
1392600	1393600	What if.
1393600	1394600	Hold on.
1394600	1395600	I'm not.
1395600	1397600	I'm only going to play like devil's advocate here for a second because I Loki for the most
1397600	1398600	part.
1398600	1403600	I'm also just kind of like, I probably just won't get it like unless it's really low cost
1403600	1405600	like five bucks a month or less.
1405600	1408600	And even then I'm still like, maybe I'll get it for the first two months and then get rid
1408600	1410600	of it or not, not pay for it for a year.
1410600	1412600	So like, I do agree with you.
1412600	1417600	However, there's a part of this that makes me go, Hmm, because there is such an interesting
1417600	1420600	strong lineup, especially on the Genesis side of things.
1420600	1426600	What if the additional money is to try to lure more of those third party games they're
1426600	1431600	missing onto the service by being able to provide additional money to those third party
1431600	1433600	IP holders to fill in the gaps?
1433600	1437600	You know, I speculate all day long about that and then pay them money and then have them
1437600	1438600	do nothing.
1438600	1440600	That's pretty much what you can expect with Nintendo.
1440600	1443600	I mean, because I doubt that they're going to do any of that.
1443600	1446600	They're going to put the minimal amount of effort into this.
1446600	1448600	So cool.
1448600	1451600	Lisa's four player multiplayer on the Nintendo 64.
1451600	1456600	So that F zero four player F zero X four player multiplayer like fuck.
1456600	1458600	Yeah, I'm here for it.
1458600	1463600	It doesn't suck ass because, you know, their multiplayer, their online service needs help
1463600	1466600	as it is the Super Nintendo and Nintendo one runs.
1466600	1467600	All right.
1467600	1470600	I've played it a lot, but I've played I've used it before and it ran fine.
1470600	1476600	But yeah, I have I have problems with that, especially when we are not when they're not
1476600	1478600	confirming a price yet.
1478600	1481600	Yeah, I want to hear what the price is.
1481600	1484600	They're probably like, OK, what do you guys suggest the price should be?
1484600	1488600	You know, they're just trying to feel it out, which is.
1488600	1490600	It's stupid, but whatever.
1490600	1493600	OK, it is what it is.
1493600	1496600	So other interesting announcements.
1496600	1501600	So we knew that there was going to be the illumination Mario movie and we got announcements
1501600	1504600	of the voice actors that are coming to that.
1504600	1506600	Can we skip this part?
1506600	1507600	Go ahead.
1507600	1508600	I'm sorry.
1508600	1509600	I'm just I'm here.
1509600	1510600	I'm like.
1510600	1516600	So we've got, you know, of course, Chris Pratt as Mario and it's the same.
1516600	1517600	You know what?
1517600	1519600	I actually I like that, actually.
1519600	1523600	Chris Pratt was great in the other anime movies he's done, like the Lego movies and stuff.
1523600	1525600	I think he'll be a great for this.
1525600	1530600	I just don't want Chris Pratt to have any work, but I don't care for him as a person
1530600	1531600	anymore either.
1531600	1535600	If this was 10 years ago at the height of Park Heights of Parks and Rec, I might feel
1535600	1536600	differently.
1536600	1541600	But I also even if I were to put that aside, I kind of feel like he is everywhere right
1541600	1546600	now. And it's just a little bit like the lazy choice to me.
1546600	1550600	But I mean, the reality is like and I'm just going to say that I probably wasn't going
1550600	1554600	to see the movie anyway because I just don't go to movies.
1554600	1558600	I still haven't seen the Sonic movie and I like the Sonic voice cast.
1558600	1560600	So it was great.
1560600	1561600	Yeah, I just don't.
1561600	1563600	I haven't even seen it yet.
1563600	1567600	Yeah. And that's you know, so let me put it this way.
1567600	1571600	This announcement is just not making me go, oh, shit, I can't wait to see it.
1571600	1573600	I'm just like.
1573600	1576600	They have Charlie Day as Luigi, which would be hilarious.
1576600	1583600	Jack Black is Bowser, Seth Rogen doing Donkey Kong, Keegan Michael Key as Toad is going
1583600	1586600	to be interesting.
1586600	1590600	And then Charles Martinet is going to have other voice cameos in the movie as well.
1590600	1596600	And then they've got some other folks doing some of the other roles in there as well.
1596600	1598600	Can we talk about Charles Martinet for a minute?
1598600	1603600	Because there's a lot of people that are very mad that he wasn't cast as Mario.
1603600	1608600	Now, the one thing I did say a long time ago on this show was that he was he's not going
1608600	1609600	to get the part of Mario.
1609600	1610600	He was never going to.
1610600	1614600	That is no disrespect to Mr. Martinet, who I think is a wonderful person and is a real
1614600	1619600	delight at trade shows and has brought great personality to Mario.
1619600	1622600	That's just not the way Hollywood works, unfortunately.
1622600	1628600	Your faves that do things on TV or even on stage and Broadway rarely do the folks on
1628600	1632600	stage on Broadway get cast in the movies.
1632600	1634600	Look what's happening with Dear Evan Hansen right now.
1634600	1640600	Like it's backfiring big time because that guy is too old to be playing that part.
1640600	1644600	And it's kind of causing the movie to become a meme at this point.
1644600	1648600	So, you know, Charles Martinet was never going to get the part of Mario.
1648600	1654600	I think it's very nice that they're acknowledging and giving him a part in the movie after all.
1654600	1659600	And I bet dimes to dollars he's going to play Mario's dad because that's the type of thing.
1660600	1666600	Maybe Wario, but I'm going to guess they're going to stunt cast Wario for a sequel.
1666600	1672600	So my guess is Mario's dad because like Mario's family outside of Luigi is something you've
1672600	1673600	never seen.
1673600	1674600	He's Waluigi.
1674600	1681600	I just I think they save them for a sequel with with people I can't stand with Tom Cruise
1681600	1683600	in the role or people I hate even more.
1683600	1690600	So like it's just I think I think he'll play I think he'll play Mario's dad and it's going
1690600	1691600	to be one of those.
1691600	1693600	It'll be like Mario's dad is Dr. Mario.
1693600	1694600	How about that?
1694600	1698600	I'm going to spoil a 15 plus year old movie.
1698600	1703600	Do you remember at the end of the South Park movie when Kenny finally took his hat off
1703600	1705600	and got to say like one line?
1705600	1708600	And I think they had somebody kind of epic voice, Kenny.
1708600	1709600	Right.
1709600	1710600	I don't remember.
1710600	1712600	But anyway, it's going to be that.
1712600	1719600	It's going to be like Charles Martinet gives two lines and it's Mario's dad.
1719600	1723600	Bobby Black Wolf is bringing up something he brought up on his show tonight saying,
1723600	1727600	I wouldn't want to listen to Martinet's Mario for an hour and a half.
1727600	1730600	And I think that's a fair call out.
1730600	1733600	Charles Martinet as Mario is very high pitched.
1733600	1734600	It works for the games.
1734600	1736600	But let me ask this question.
1736600	1741600	Has Charles Martinet ever done a full voice Mario inside a game?
1741600	1743600	I'm fully aware.
1743600	1745600	Just phrases here and there.
1745600	1747600	Yeah, just like has there ever been a game?
1747600	1751600	Now, I know he has done full voices for Mario at trade shows, conventions.
1751600	1755600	We all know that infamous Bobby Black Wolf bumper where he talks in Mario.
1755600	1757600	And then I think in Wario on that show.
1757600	1760600	And that was all I was there at E32.
1760600	1762600	I just didn't think to get a bumper.
1762600	1763600	Oh, no, because we cut the line.
1763600	1765600	But that's another story.
1766600	1768600	But there's that whole thing.
1768600	1771600	And so, yes, I know he does the voice of those things.
1771600	1773600	I don't think he's ever officially done more than like,
1773600	1775600	wahoo, wahoo.
1775600	1778600	Like he does those incidentals in the games.
1778600	1781600	But I don't think he's ever done much more than that.
1781600	1784600	So we don't really know what Charles Martinet's Mario sound like.
1784600	1788600	And one other thing, he's not the first person to have the role.
1788600	1789600	Hello, Captain Lou Albano.
1789600	1792600	And Bobby actually also did an excellent job recapping.
1792600	1794600	There's been Peter Cullen did the voice of Mario at one point.
1794600	1796600	I'd forgot about that.
1796600	1800600	So Charles Martinet doesn't own Mario, unfortunately.
1800600	1802600	Love him, adore him.
1802600	1805600	Glad he's involved in the movie in some capacity.
1805600	1807600	He never was going to be Mario.
1807600	1811600	I certainly would take him over what we're getting, but it is what it is.
1811600	1814600	I would have rather seen Charlie Day get the Mario part, honestly.
1814600	1816600	I don't hate him as Luigi.
1817600	1818600	Anyway.
1818600	1819600	Yeah.
1819600	1822600	And then I was also going to mention that there's other announcements
1822600	1824600	for different directs as well.
1824600	1829600	So we have a tease of some content coming to Animal Crossing.
1829600	1833600	So we're going to be getting Brewster's back in the museum.
1833600	1839600	Finally, there's a direct coming as well towards the, I think, end of October.
1839600	1841600	I definitely thought of Jamie when I saw that.
1841600	1843600	And I thought of myself and a reason to go.
1843600	1845600	I mean, to have to play again, my town again.
1845600	1849600	I it looks it's sounding like it's going to be paid DLC, though.
1849600	1856600	But if it's if it's comprehensive, I'm willing to, you know, I outside of this N64 thing,
1856600	1861600	we've just been dragging Nintendo with when it comes to the DLC they put out for games
1861600	1864600	because they spent a long time on Hyrule Warriors DLC, too.
1864600	1867600	I think we just kind of were kind of played out on that, too.
1867600	1871600	But like the DLC that Nintendo does is very strong.
1871600	1873600	I don't think they ever let down with the DLC.
1873600	1878600	So like I'm willing to kick 20 bucks because I feel like my 20 bucks for Animal Cross is going to get a lot.
1878600	1884600	But anyway, I guess we'll find out when we get to that direct later on.
1884600	1891600	Yeah. And then along with that, the last Smash Ultimate Fighter is going to be announced on October 5th at 7 a.m.
1891600	1896600	Pacific Time is going to be the last Smash Direct that we have.
1896600	1900600	So I look forward to that.
1900600	1905600	I did like that they acknowledge that because I think there were a lot of people going.
1905600	1909600	That was the other big rumor for this direct is that people were like, oh, it's about that time.
1909600	1912600	This is going to be the last Smash reveal.
1912600	1916600	So they were very smart to say, not today, but here's the day.
1916600	1919600	So at least they kind of threw them a bone on that.
1919600	1923600	Yeah. So that'll be coming soon.
1923600	1925600	That's pretty much it.
1925600	1931600	SSJ100Matt in chat says the last Smash character is going to upset folks no matter who it is.
1931600	1933600	Guaranteed. Bet on it.
1933600	1936600	You can count on that 100 percent.
1936600	1939600	Especially if it's another.
1939600	1941600	Oh, gosh.
1941600	1943600	I remember the Fire Emblem.
1943600	1946600	Yeah, it's another Fire Emblem character.
1946600	1948600	I'm just crazy.
1948600	1955600	I'll ask because I have to like what realistically like I really want you to put on your we've been talking about video games for nearly 20 years.
1955600	1965600	Hat. What do you realistically think is the last Smash Brothers DLC character?
1965600	1971600	I don't even know.
1971600	1974600	It's the Guardian, the Guardian.
1974600	1978600	I don't that doesn't sound that sounds wishful, not that.
1978600	1982600	Yeah, that was just me saying what I wanted to say.
1982600	1985600	I'll go with my I'm really torn between two.
1985600	1988600	I think there is a serious chance it's Waluigi.
1988600	1991600	I do not think that's off the table.
1991600	1996600	I think that's there's there is a chance I'm going to give you that whole Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber.
1996600	1999600	Or was that the other guy? Anyway, there is a chance.
1999600	2005600	I also I also think there is a very real possibility.
2005600	2007600	It's a major Microsoft character.
2007600	2009600	I mean, Master Chief.
2009600	2012600	Master Chef. Master Chef.
2012600	2015600	Why not? We got Minecraft Steve.
2015600	2021600	We got Banjo Kazooie. Master Chief definitely seems like the way to where they can fire off characters.
2021600	2024600	And that's going to be the one that pisses off the Nintendo fans the most. Just wait.
2024600	2028600	So I and yes, I'm not this is not wishful.
2028600	2034600	You know, again, if I wanted if I was going to say who I wanted, I'd go along with Dark Soccer is saying I want the dude from Actraiser.
2034600	2036600	I want God.
2036600	2040600	No, I want God. And you know, well, because you play God in Actraiser.
2040600	2043600	So I want God to be the last DLC, but it's not going to happen.
2043600	2048600	It's more like you're playing as an avatar. But yeah.
2048600	2054600	All right. Loki, you're not going to put anything out there.
2054600	2061600	I don't know. Let's see.
2061600	2062600	I'm looking in chat.
2062600	2067600	Orange right says Rayman. I think that's a very well thought out answer.
2067600	2072600	Yes. Let's let's do Rayman. It's going to be a rabid.
2072600	2079600	I am terrible. I could see it. I mean.
2079600	2085600	Yeah, if it's a rabid, then everybody could say, how about, you know, let's support Ubisoft and all of their sexism.
2085600	2088600	Yay. The squid kids are in there, right?
2088600	2093600	Yeah. And the Pikmin, you have the doctor guy that has all the Pikmin. So it's just going to be Brewster.
2093600	2101600	OK, he's going to come out there and drink coffee. And anyone who tries to touch his coffee siphon gets kicked in the face.
2101600	2103600	That would be what I would be with my coffee.
2103600	2107600	Dark Tetsuya wanted to bring up from the direct and chat, saying one last thought on the direct.
2107600	2112600	I was legit shocked to see Shadowrun Trilogy in the sizzle reel.
2112600	2116600	My wife has been wanting a port of that for years. Oh, yeah. Good call. That was a good.
2116600	2121600	Yeah. We're kind of leaving out some stuff from sizzle reels and stuff. But yeah, that was a neat thing to see.
2121600	2127600	I was also very interested in that card tabletop looking RPG game that Square Enix is doing.
2127600	2133600	When they started showing the cards, I was like, oh, my God, are we getting cold set to like, is this really like the best?
2134600	2141600	I the Isle Dragon roars.
2141600	2145600	So anything else on the direct, Loki?
2145600	2149600	I mean, that was a lot of the the stuff that I want on the cover, basically.
2149600	2159600	I mean, there is other stuff like Disco Elysium, the final cut and stuff. I'm sure there's more ports of different games coming to the switch as well.
2159600	2163600	I don't know. I'm excited about the movie, even though it comes out next year, next holiday.
2163600	2170600	So I'm looking forward to a trailer. Hopefully get that pretty soon.
2170600	2179600	I'm I'm hopeful for it. Like Detective Pikachu was like something that sounded like it would be really like like really in live action with Pikachu.
2179600	2182600	And that was an excellent movie, like such an excellent movie.
2182600	2186600	So like, I'm hopeful. Illumination does good work.
2186600	2189600	I'm I'm very hopeful to see something.
2189600	2192600	Let me toss it to chat real quick. Is there anything else in the direct?
2192600	2196600	Kind of like what Dark Tetsuya said that we missed that you want to bring up in chat?
2196600	2198600	Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
2198600	2200600	Twitch dot TV slash vog network.
2200600	2204600	If there was anything else that caught your eye in the direct that you wanted to share with us.
2204600	2208600	Still some chat on that final smash character.
2208600	2211600	Tiger Claus saying, what about the dude from the recent Yakuza game?
2211600	2214600	I just don't see it because that series doesn't really exist on switch.
2214600	2221600	I know that didn't stop other things from showing up, but I just I just don't see that one appearing.
2221600	2226600	As much as we get Master Chief, I could see a major PlayStation icon showing up.
2226600	2229600	But we also kind of got that with guy.
2229600	2233600	Doom guy. I mean, maybe.
2233600	2236600	Crash Bandicoot says Bobby Black Wolf.
2236600	2238600	Oh, come on. You know, Tony.
2238600	2243600	Well, I mean, that is Activision, but I can say, you know, Tony doesn't play ball like that.
2243600	2246600	But for Spyro, I could Spyro.
2246600	2248600	No one knows who Spyro is anymore.
2248600	2251600	Skylanders Skylanders.
2251600	2256600	Skylanders. They know what Skylander is because they melt that to its dead.
2256600	2258600	It's like everything else.
2258600	2262600	Unfortunately, so far, though, the only teeth that hasn't dried up is the Call of Duty teeth.
2262600	2265600	So, you know, that'll be going on forever.
2265600	2268600	Some nice stale milk there. Yeah.
2268600	2276600	E3VL says Emmy MMI to promote to promote Metroid Dread, which comes out three days after.
2276600	2284600	I get that from the corporate synergy angle and your logic in getting to that conclusion makes absolute sense.
2284600	2288600	That being said, oh, the backlash to that would be massive.
2288600	2292600	I just don't I just feel like the expectations are higher.
2292600	2295600	It also mentioned that the OLED switch is coming out on the eighth as well.
2295600	2299600	That's only two weeks away. Oh, I'll never be able to get that. Good call.
2299600	2303600	What if we got, I guess, the last character, just a Ness?
2303600	2306600	And I don't mean the the boy from Earthbound.
2306600	2310600	Like, I mean something like Rob the robot, but it's a Ness.
2310600	2314600	I could see it'd be like fighting the car in Daytona in Fighters Megamix.
2314600	2317600	Why not? I could see it.
2317600	2322600	All right. Can someone port Salty Bet to the switch, please?
2322600	2325600	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I want it to be Sakurai himself.
2325600	2333600	I would love that, actually, but I see them more doing like an official me pack for that.
2333600	2336600	I think that we wanted Reggie at one time to be in Smash Brothers.
2336600	2340600	I would be well, and through the Mies, I think people have kind of done that.
2340600	2342600	So, yeah. All right. Let's move on.
2342600	2346600	Let's talk about the types of games that we have been playing this week, whether it's Smash or something else.
2346600	2349600	How was your gaming week? And we'll start with Loki.
2349600	2351600	How was your gaming week? I'm sorry.
2351600	2354600	Wait was all right. I did it out of order on accident.
2354600	2357600	Sorry, Loki. Go ahead. And then we'll go back to Jamie.
2357600	2361600	It's because the order of the cameras is off tonight.
2361600	2366600	Go ahead. So I actually did play something other than Minecraft this week.
2366600	2372600	I played I played several hours of power wash simulator.
2372600	2376600	I've been watching you on Discord. I see that you're playing that.
2376600	2379600	And I'm like, oh, I need to get that game. I really do.
2379600	2382600	It's pretty fun. It's just it's a good game.
2382600	2387600	Like after work, like when I'm just like brain dead from just the boredom of work.
2387600	2393600	It's a good kind of like buffer game between that and actually like having to think for like Minecraft.
2393600	2398600	It's just it's just mindless. I mean, it's really what it is.
2398600	2403600	But yeah, it's fun. I have been enjoying it quite a bit.
2403600	2406600	So, yeah, I've been playing that. And then, of course, Minecraft.
2406600	2410600	So working on stuff for that started designing the megabase stuff.
2410600	2414600	So I've been doing that and fighting with a custom design for a redstone elevator.
2414600	2417600	So those are a lot more complicated than I thought.
2417600	2424600	So I started filming parts of it this morning and then I'm going to be building stuff and filming the rest of it.
2424600	2428600	Hopefully, but not an episode middle of this week. So look for that.
2428600	2431600	Oh, I did put out a short earlier this week as well.
2431600	2436600	Really only pertains to anybody that watches like her spacecraft and like last life stuff.
2436600	2439600	Now, there's a like a meme that's kind of part of that.
2439600	2444600	And I made a data pack for Minecraft for, you know, trying to capitalize on those views and stuff.
2444600	2448600	But no one cares. So.
2448600	2454600	That's it. I'm with or I'm sorry, Tiger Claw in chat says you guys should try gas station simulator.
2454600	2458600	And I'm with the three. What what what are you simulating in that?
2458600	2464600	You run a gas station, but it's also like crime because like there's a story that goes along with that.
2464600	2467600	I watched there's a channel I watch called Let's Game It Out.
2467600	2470600	It's a guy that plays games like I do, where he tries to break them.
2470600	2477600	And he's hilarious. But so with that, though, there is like a storyline.
2477600	2483600	You start you get this like gas station. You buy it, I guess is your uncle's gas station or something like that.
2483600	2487600	And you kind of fix it up and then you kind of run it.
2487600	2490600	But then at the same time, you also can do like crime.
2490600	2495600	So I guess you're like gun running or like front for like drug running or something like that.
2495600	2501600	So it's a little bit crime sim, a little bit of like I don't know.
2501600	2505600	There's like mafia in it and stuff. It's weird, but it's a fun sim game.
2505600	2510600	You get to just run stuff, check people out, you know, fix cars.
2510600	2517600	You can pump gas design stuff. I don't know. People like those Sims.
2517600	2521600	Huh. All right. Yeah, it sounds interesting. I'll check it out.
2521600	2525600	All right. So that's it for your gaming week, Dark Sakura. How was your gaming week?
2525600	2530600	I played Fantasian and I played Dead by Daylight.
2530600	2539600	And I I've also decided, though, that for tomorrow, when I do my marathon, my break game is going to be Final Fantasy 14.
2539600	2548600	Oh, nice. OK. Yeah. You know, just like in between, you know, murdering people, survivors, you know.
2548600	2554600	I also did play a little bit of pinball. My World Cup soccer is home.
2555600	2560600	We got our Dan finally put the color DMD in it and she looks gorgeous.
2560600	2565600	I'm going to put a video up on TikTok later. Yeah, I want to see that color display.
2565600	2570600	I bet it's a beautiful thing for that table. Well, maybe I'll post it during the show.
2570600	2574600	Fun. All right. Well, that's it for your gaming week. Then I'll get to my gaming week.
2574600	2578600	I actually had a pretty busy gaming week, so I actually took some notes on what I played this week.
2578600	2583600	I did play some of my usual stuff, some of the stuff that Jamie just mentioned. Final Fantasy 14.
2583600	2588600	Still working my way up to all my jobs being 80 before and Walker.
2588600	2593600	And I've also been playing Dead by Daylight here and there just a little bit. Nothing too exciting going on in that game.
2593600	2597600	Just trying to build out more of my characters. I ran some killers pretty good today, though.
2597600	2603600	I'm getting better at it. And I played No Man's Sky. Of course, I could play that game a lot.
2603600	2610600	I started a new game because why not? I wanted to do one where I could redeem my twitch stuff and the.
2610600	2616600	Excuse me, the stuff I got from expeditions, I wanted to do that like early on in the my save.
2616600	2622600	So I was just randomly doing that earlier in the week, but then my play on that just kind of got derailed because,
2622600	2627600	of course, the Nintendo Direct happened. And so I've been playing all this other stuff, too.
2627600	2631600	One thing I should mention, actually, before the Nintendo Direct, I did get WarioWare.
2631600	2636600	So I mentioned I was going to I didn't get it last week. I did get it this week.
2636600	2640600	And so I actually did play through a little bit of it where, you know, I'm unlocking some of the characters.
2640600	2645600	I got to the Nintendo Classics level. That's always the one I want to see in a WarioWare game.
2645600	2651600	And yeah, I mean, I enjoy it. It's I think the twist that the new characters put on it is interesting.
2651600	2657600	I think it's a fair criticism to say some of them are pretty same Z like I think Mona,
2657600	2662600	who kind of just is like nonstop movement and is the eight bit is also nonstop move.
2662600	2665600	It's kind of the same gimmick. So some of them are a little same Z.
2665600	2670600	But otherwise, I kind of like how it changes the mini game a little bit when you have different characters.
2670600	2675600	And I like how not all of them necessarily make sense as well for the mini games.
2675600	2680600	So you really have to think and it makes you kind of think a little bit faster in that regard.
2680600	2685600	So, yeah, I I dig the new WarioWare. I've been having a good time checking that out.
2685600	2691600	I was making good progress on that. But then the Nintendo Direct happened and there were a couple of games I had to get from that.
2691600	2697600	So, of course, one of them was Actraiser Renaissance. I was on that within minutes.
2697600	2704600	And I started playing the game. And right as I'm starting to play the first level, I'm noticing there's performance issues in this.
2704600	2713600	And it instantly made me regret getting it on Switch when I realized it had also released on PlayStation 4 and PC.
2713600	2719600	And that's exactly why they make those deals to be in the Nintendo Direct and things like that,
2719600	2724600	because it's exactly what I fell for and I should know better at this point.
2724600	2730600	I, I saw the thing in the Nintendo Direct and I need to have that right now.
2730600	2735600	Oh, it's on the store today. I'm going to go get it. And I didn't even think, is it out on other stores, too?
2735600	2737600	Because a lot of things like this is is cross platform.
2737600	2744600	Now, the performance issues weren't a like game ruiner for me, but it was something I noticed.
2744600	2750600	And I was like, God damn it. You know, it's just something that was kind of like a little bit of a setback.
2750600	2757600	Otherwise, the music was apparently kind of remastered by Yuzo Koshiro himself. The music sounds great.
2757600	2765600	There's a lot of little touches that really feel like the old Actraiser game. That's really cool.
2765600	2770600	I like that they've decided to expand on the story a little bit.
2770600	2776600	I guess they don't feel as confined to some of those, you know, simple text boxes that the original had.
2776600	2783600	And they're they're kind of fleshing out like when another character kind of a special character starts wandering around the town.
2783600	2791600	They kind of flesh that out into its own thing. And I noticed the story is very it's a lot more.
2791600	2798600	It gets a lot more deeper on the whole, like, why are you helping people that can't help themselves?
2798600	2805600	And it gets these very deep sort of like topics, you know, theological things that, you know, I don't know if I want to get into on OLR,
2805600	2808600	but because that's a touchy subject for a lot of people.
2808600	2815600	But depending on what your perspective is on all that, you might see some different things in the story that I didn't really notice before.
2815600	2822600	Well, because they changed it. On the not so great side, well mixed.
2822600	2826600	They've done things to make the game longer, which is fine.
2826600	2830600	I mean, because the original game, you could be in one sitting if you were dedicated.
2830600	2834600	It only took a few hours to get through. So you decided to make the game longer.
2834600	2839600	For example, your townspeople no longer seal off monster layers by themselves.
2839600	2847600	You have to go into the monster layers and do a much shorter action segment to actually seal them off.
2847600	2850600	OK, I'm all right with that. It's it's interesting.
2850600	2852600	Kind of gives a little how dare the people not do something for themselves.
2852600	2855600	I know. Well, that's that's a big part of the story.
2855600	2861600	So it's very interesting, sort of like you're waiting for God to fix all your problems.
2861600	2864600	Why can't you fix your own problems when God gives you the tools to do it?
2864600	2867600	This is very how it should be. Well, yeah.
2867600	2872600	And that's that's and that's if you you know, not that anyone asked for my take on religion, but that's kind of what it is.
2872600	2875600	God isn't going to fix our problems. God gives you the tools to do it.
2875600	2882600	But anyway, I'm not going to get to do that. But I think it's interesting how the story kind of gets into that.
2882600	2887600	So that part I'm OK with. What I'm less OK with is that they decided to.
2887600	2896600	All right. If we're going to have an action genre and a sim genre, let's throw in a tower defense genre to to enhance the sim game.
2896600	2901600	I don't think that lands so well. It kind of artificially makes the game longer.
2901600	2907600	It's not something I signed up for as a part of Actraiser. Doesn't really have a lot of depth to it.
2907600	2912600	I was really disappointed to see them kind of futz with the game's formulas by putting in this tower defense game.
2912600	2917600	It's unavoidable. I really wish they had made that.
2917600	2922600	I mean, you could like take it all the way down to the easiest level and it probably is not going to be a problem or anything.
2922600	2929600	But I just wish that they would have made a version of the game that really is just a remaster of the original.
2930600	2935600	And not necessarily added in extra gameplay mechanics that weren't even a part of the original game.
2935600	2940600	That landed a little bit disappointing for me, unfortunately.
2940600	2946600	Otherwise, what else was I going to say with that?
2946600	2953600	I didn't I don't walk away from the game feeling negative. I do feel over. I do feel overall it's pretty positive.
2953600	2959600	But yeah, that was just a thing that made me go, I wish I wish they wouldn't kind of throw off the balance of the remaster like that.
2959600	2965600	You know, it's not the same thing. You know, I think back to like what were like some great remasters that have happened.
2965600	2971600	I think like Wonder Boy, the Dragon's Trap is one of the best ones. It's just the same game.
2971600	2975600	But now it's on the widescreen. You can hit a button to flip back and forth between old new graphics.
2975600	2980600	It looks it looks great and all that. I would have rather instead of them adding this whole tower defense thing into it,
2980600	2987600	that they would have added new areas, just expand the world instead of six stages, give us eight stages or whatever.
2987600	2995600	I would have rather seen the game go that direction instead of kind of a little more artificially making the game a little bit longer.
2995600	3000600	But at the end of the day, maybe they'll fix that. I don't know. I guess they could always patch it or something. Who knows?
3000600	3006600	But at the end of the day, I do think, you know, I love Actraiser. And so as a fan of the game, I was very happy to see it.
3006600	3016600	This game exists. And I don't regret spending money on it because I want to support this idea that Quinten is going to go back and remaster old games.
3016600	3027600	But if they do remaster the Soul Blazer trilogy, please, please don't do what you did here and add new things just for the sake of new game mechanics.
3027600	3035600	Like please keep the game what it was with maybe a bonus dungeon or something like that. That would be much better.
3035600	3040600	Dartusy in chat says, oh, yeah, Dragon's Trap was great. It also had FM remixes of the SMS music.
3040600	3049600	Yeah. Another, you know, another remaster that I think did the new stuff very well, Blaster Master Zero, I think is an incredible remaster.
3049600	3057600	And yeah, they went a slightly different direction from the base game, but I think all of it still stuck to what the game was.
3057600	3063600	And I think and it's exceeded so well. They've done a part two and a part three, which aren't even now.
3063600	3068600	It's like its own thing. It's like not even canon to the original game technically. But I think it's really rad with that.
3068600	3077600	I think that's also a benchmark for what remaster should be, is the Blaster Master Zero franchise. So, you know, that's all.
3077600	3085600	OK, one other game I checked out this week was the Castlevania collection. This time I didn't buy that right away.
3085600	3089600	I actually waited because I was so into the Actraiser thing. I think I waited till the next day.
3089600	3097600	And so I actually went to pot. And I think because of the performance thing that happened to me on the switch, that's why I got it on Xbox.
3097600	3104600	I would have got it on PS5 if I had a PS5, but I just since I have a Series X, I went for Xbox.
3104600	3111600	And I got to say that collection turned out very well. I played a little bit of Dracula X and I played a little bit of.
3111600	3120600	The first I can't remember all the names now, the first advance game, I played a little bit of that because I remember when those games were newer,
3120600	3126600	I keep wanting to say Castle of Illusion, but that's the Disney game. But thank you.
3126600	3132600	Circle of the Moon. Thank you, Jade. Sacred Jade in chat. I played a little bit of that one.
3132600	3137600	That is a hard fucking game. I got murdered by that first boss pretty quick. That was irritating.
3137600	3144600	But otherwise, I'm having a good time with it. And I played a little bit of a Dracula X. It plays great on the big screen.
3144600	3153600	I have to say, I like some of the things that Konami or I guess maybe M2 really did to kind of enhance the games with like the fact that you can save anywhere.
3153600	3159600	I mean, it basically is that earlier Castlevania collection with different games. It's that. But it worked out very well.
3159600	3167600	And I'm a fan. I think I think if you enjoy those Castlevania games, it's been a while since you visited the advance games like myself.
3167600	3175600	I hear Aria of Sorrow is a terrific game. And from what I remember, what little I played of it, it was. I can't wait to get there.
3175600	3183600	So there's a lot of value. And I think the collection was only $19.99, maybe $29.99. I don't think it was. I think it was $19.99.
3183600	3188600	Somebody in chat might correct me on the price, but I think it was only 20 bucks. And that's a pretty good value.
3189600	3192600	Thank you. Sacred Jade said it was 20 bucks. Thank you.
3192600	3197600	And like Dark Sakura said, it has Dracula X. That was a huge surprise and a nice thing to see in there.
3197600	3203600	And you can switch between region releases. They briefly mentioned that in the trailer, but I think that is a really cool addition.
3203600	3210600	So if you want to play the Japanese version of any of those games or the European version now of any of those games, you can easily switch on the main menu.
3210600	3216600	So I thought that was really great. So yeah, I recommend the Castlevania Advance Collection. It's great.
3216600	3225600	No performance issues on Xbox, except I absolutely have to use that D-pad on my Series X. Thank God they redid the Series X D-pad.
3225600	3232600	Works so much nicer when you have to do like a double tap to run. Works much better than using the nub.
3232600	3238600	So that was my gaming week. There was a lot. Sorry, but some new stuff and some things to get into.
3238600	3242600	So yeah, obviously I was very excited about the ActRaiser thing and all that.
3242600	3250600	And you know I'm going to be all over that ChocoboGP or whatever, the Chocobo Racing 2, whatever they ended up calling it in 2022, whenever that actually was.
3250600	3251600	It's ChocoboGP.
3251600	3258600	I know, it's Chocobo Racing 2 to me. All right, let's move on. We've got some more news for you guys.
3258600	3265600	Oh, actually, before we get into that, Pod Culture in Chat mentions my gaming week, Diablo 2.
3266600	3274600	I mentioned last week I was having a little bit of an ethical conundrum on I want to support certain people that made the game.
3274600	3278600	I want to support the frontline workers. I don't want to support Bobby Kotick.
3278600	3291600	What I decided to do is that I am going to buy the game, but I'm going to buy it next month because the higher ups love to tout the sales the first week, the first month sales and all that stuff.
3291600	3297600	That's the stuff that's important to them, so I will not be a figure in that, and I'm going to buy it in October.
3297600	3302600	And that's my choice, and whatever choice you landed on is your choice, and that is perfectly fine.
3302600	3305600	You know all the cards on the table.
3305600	3309600	And there are a few more cards as of this week, aren't there, Loki?
3310600	3325600	Yep. So, you know, because they still haven't agreed to or even considered the wants of their employees, the US government now is investigating Activision Blizzard.
3325600	3335600	The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched their investigation, and they've also subpoenaed Bobby Kotick to see what exactly he knew and when.
3335600	3347600	Apparently, the company is cooperating with the SEC according to Activision, or I'm sorry, Helene Klasky, who is the Activision spokesperson.
3347600	3370600	And yeah, this is just kind of escalating after basically hearing the news that I guess they're still at their union busting activities, and they're still not following the guidance that the SEC has told them to follow.
3371600	3377600	And so, you know, they'll get down to the bottom of it, one way or the other.
3377600	3380600	Along with that, though, the chief legal officer...
3380600	3384600	Sorry, quickly about the Bobby Kotick subpoena, all I have to say is good.
3384600	3394600	Like, I don't want to say I'm excited for this because it should have never gotten to this, but be that as it may, since we are in this scenario,
3394600	3405600	and the responses of the Blizzard employees have still not been responded to, then I think the government is finally doing something right.
3405600	3410600	And it's a rush to see, and I really hope it's televised, and I hope I get to see it.
3410600	3419600	And quite frankly, I feel like emailing my representatives and providing some questions that I would like to see answered.
3419600	3426600	I'm only kind of disappointed they're not bringing in Yves Guillemin, too. I don't know if you get into weird things because the French...
3426600	3432600	Yeah, I know, it's like a French... But I mean, it's probably a little more complicated, so I'm willing to kind of...
3432600	3441600	But I would have liked to have seen him come in, too, but I'm glad that one of the faces of the industry is going to finally have to respond to this.
3441600	3446600	Ubisoft still has, like, offices in the United States.
3446600	3456600	I know, that's why I feel like he should be... He should be subpoenable, or if not, then they should have somebody who's over the US division, and that person should be subpoenable.
3456600	3463600	I just want to see Katie Porter and her whiteboard show up. That is all I want from this.
3463600	3470600	And by the way, Katie Porter is from Southern California. I don't know if she represents Irvine's district, but she's really fucking close.
3470600	3480600	So I would be fucking thrilled if that makes an appearance, because I want her to ask Bobby Kotick a question that she's asked a lot of people that have been dragged up there.
3480600	3486600	What have you done to earn your bonuses that you're getting with all of this that's going on behind the scenes?
3486600	3491600	I just want this. What have you done?
3491600	3492600	Period.
3492600	3494600	Period.
3494600	3505600	What I want to email my representatives, and I encourage all of you to do this, go to that... Oh God, I'm so embarrassed because I don't remember the Twitter account in the moment.
3505600	3510600	I think it's abk is the account. Somebody can correct me on that if I'm wrong.
3510600	3514600	That's the employees and their questions and all that stuff.
3514600	3523600	Since Bobby Kotick will not respond to the employees this way, I want the folks on Capitol Hill to ask the questions.
3523600	3530600	Why won't you respond to your employees on these issues? So ask them in front of the entire public.
3530600	3533600	Thank you, Mike Deft. A better abk.
3533600	3539600	I hate that it's come to this, but I'm so happy it's happening.
3539600	3542600	I'm glad something's been being done.
3542600	3551600	So one company down, you know, hopefully there's actual... something actually comes of this.
3551600	3557600	One thing that did come of this so far is that their chief legal officer has quit amid the lawsuit.
3557600	3565600	So Claire Hart has resigned from the company as of Friday, September 17th via her LinkedIn post.
3565600	3573600	She announced that no plans on necessarily where she's going to move to, but taking a break from the craziness.
3573600	3578600	So does... Let me ask this question. Does anyone blame her?
3578600	3579600	No.
3579600	3580600	Crickets.
3580600	3587600	It's probably a really awkward place to be, especially if you're defending a company and what they've done.
3587600	3589600	It's like, eh.
3589600	3590600	Yeah.
3590600	3594600	Ethical conundrum there.
3594600	3604600	I don't want to see this end in like the fall of Blizzard because I know several people that work there who are wonderful and I don't want to see them impacted.
3605600	3609600	But what I do want this... I want it to be the fall of Bobby Kotick, to be quite frank.
3609600	3614600	And I do want to see more new folks that rise to the top.
3614600	3616600	I want to see accountability.
3616600	3617600	Yes.
3617600	3619600	Good way to put that succinctly.
3619600	3620600	That's what I want.
3620600	3621600	I want accountability.
3621600	3623600	I don't want to see the company close.
3623600	3624600	That would be horrible.
3624600	3629600	There's too many creative people and too many talented people for this to close.
3629600	3631600	I mean, sure, they'd probably all end up somewhere else in the industry.
3631600	3633600	I don't want them to have to go through that.
3633600	3634600	Isn't this enough?
3634600	3637600	We need integrity and accountability.
3637600	3638600	Yes.
3638600	3642600	And so I hope they bring some of that on the table with Bobby Kotick.
3642600	3645600	Now, some valid concerns in chat.
3645600	3654600	SSJ 100 Matt in chat says, I'm just worried that Kotick's lawyers are going to file countless injunctions so that he doesn't have to answer questions for a while.
3654600	3658600	You're going to answer for it eventually, Bobby.
3658600	3663600	So the longer that that they put it off, the worse it's going to be.
3663600	3664600	Bingo.
3664600	3667600	Bingo.
3667600	3672600	As my mama used to tell me when she'd ask me to tell the truth, if I did something wrong.
3672600	3683600	As as an old boss many years ago with another company, I worked at used to tell me either you're going to pay for it on the front end or you pay for it on the back end.
3683600	3684600	There it is.
3684600	3689600	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I just thought Rob was yelling at me that I was going to have to answer.
3689600	3690600	Yes, Bobby Black Wolf.
3690600	3691600	Get in front.
3691600	3694600	No, I think Bobby Black Wolf should ask the questions.
3694600	3696600	Quite frankly, Bobby versus Bobby.
3696600	3697600	Let's do it.
3697600	3698600	All right.
3698600	3701600	Bobby on Bobby.
3701600	3702600	All right.
3702600	3703600	Moving on.
3703600	3709600	Let's get to our next story, which has to do with other retro dealings on the switch.
3709600	3718600	This is outside of the Nintendo 64 and Genesis stuff we were earlier talking about, because some people are saying, well, this must be the end of NES and Super Nintendo, right?
3718600	3725600	Because, I mean, the well's been looking pretty dry over there with some of the recent releases have not been exactly thrilling.
3725600	3731600	But Nintendo did confirm there are still plans to release more NES and Super Nintendo games.
3731600	3734600	We don't know what they are, but just that there are plans.
3734600	3742600	To remind you, we got such recent great releases like Claymates, Bamboozle, and Jelly Boy.
3742600	3744600	I remember one of those games.
3744600	3750600	But there will be more stuff coming soon.
3750600	3753600	A lot of people are saying Earthbound?
3753600	3755600	And I agree.
3755600	3762600	Earthbound would be one I would have thought we would just see out of encouragement to renew for another year by now.
3762600	3767600	Super Mario RPG, of course, is like the Super Nintendo game everybody's...
3767600	3776600	I think that one gets a little more complicated, because, of course, it's really Square's game and some of their people.
3776600	3780600	That's why I kind of toyed with that idea earlier.
3780600	3791600	Maybe this is why they're jacking up the price, sort of, in this way that they're doing it to try to get more money in the pot so they can put a dump truck full of money on Square's porch to get them to hand over the game already.
3791600	3804600	Who knows? I, in my opinion, use the dump truck of money to make a Super Mario RPG 2, and I think fans will be 50 times happier, but I'm asking for a lot, I realize that.
3804600	3811600	No word if, at the end of October, the NES and SNES catalogs will be updated at all.
3811600	3816600	That is when we're going to get the N64 and Sega Genesis games, so there's that.
3816600	3824600	Dark Tetsuya brings up a good point. A lot of those have legal red tape, which is why I'm not sure GoldenEye is ever going to show up on the N64 side.
3824600	3833600	That's a great point, and Jason talked about that in our intro tonight, too, is that GoldenEye is kind of the Mario RPG of the Nintendo 64.
3833600	3837600	That makes no sense at all, and also perfect sense at the same time, if you think about it.
3838600	3852600	That is that game everybody's going to want on N64, that is just, that's going to be the hardest to get, because of all, it's not just the licenses to the 007 franchise, which, did you know Amazon owns that franchise now when it comes to the movies?
3852600	3854600	Why am I not surprised?
3854600	3856600	Because they bought MGM.
3856600	3871600	I'd like to remind you, though, about Mario 64. This is why they don't sell the Mario 3D All-Stars collection anymore, because if you want to play Mario 64, you gotta pay a monthly fee instead of paying a flat fee.
3871600	3873600	Thanks, Nintendo! You're awesome!
3873600	3878600	I didn't connect those dots. Good job. Good call-out on that.
3878600	3892600	Bobby Black Wolf is saying, reminder, GoldenEye didn't age well. In some ways, neither did Super Mario RPG. I know that's a controversial statement, but I think there's a lot of people that when you go back and play that again, you're going to be like,
3892600	3910600	Oh, this just kind of hit, this hit differently when I was a kid. So, but, not only do you get into the, the movie rights holders and all those issues, then you get into like Pierce Brosnan's likeness issue and all that.
3910600	3914600	And I don't know how easy that's going to be to get around.
3914600	3918600	Make up Daniel Craig like they did for the really crappy GoldenEye remake that they did.
3919600	3926600	And who knows if they could even do that. They would have to make, you know, just a very, put Mario's face in it and have Charles Martin voice it.
3926600	3928600	We'll put Chris Pratt in there.
3928600	3931600	Moving on.
3931600	3937600	I have one other kind of Nintendo, Super Nintendo sort of thing.
3937600	3949600	And that is that the Disney Classic Collection is getting revised. So there's going to be a new version of this. It's going to be out on the Nintendo Switch for $29.99 on November 9th.
3949600	3959600	There is, if you own the original edition, you can get a DLC pack that will upgrade you to this new Disney Classic Collection because there's more games.
3959600	3963600	It's the Jungle Book and more Aladdin for $10.
3963600	3968600	The original Classic Collection was Aladdin, The Lion King, and The Jungle Book.
3968600	3977600	The new one will have, I guess there's Aladdin The Final Cut, Aladdin demo version for the Mega Drive, Aladdin Japanese version for the Mega Drive.
3977600	3983600	So there's like some extra stuff there. But also, of course, The Jungle Book was missing before so that's coming out as well.
3984600	3992600	There's what some third party folks are choosing to do instead, is release their own collections.
3992600	3997600	Hence why we don't have Secret of Mana in the Super Nintendo Collection.
3997600	4003600	Hence, we didn't get a Castle of Illusion announcement on the Genesis pack, even though that's not part of this.
4003600	4008600	I'm sure, you know, Disney and all them have their plans for that, that's for sure.
4009600	4010600	Comments in chat.
4010600	4014600	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, this was neat, I might have to look for the new collection.
4014600	4020600	Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, 30 bucks. I mean, it's only a handful of games, but they are pretty solid.
4020600	4025600	And it is Disney IPs, so we know why it costs a little bit more, you're paying that premium.
4025600	4029600	But there's something available. So, I thought that was neat.
4029600	4032600	Let's move on to Dark Sakura.
4033600	4041600	So, going to the UK, and I think this is awesome and I would like to see more of this happen.
4041600	4051600	But the quote, micro transaction and in-game ads, they're basically being smacked down quite a bit more.
4051600	4058600	The UK's Advertising Standards Authority updated their guidance on how game developers and publishers
4058600	4063600	should and should not advertise in-game currencies and other purchases.
4063600	4070600	They're pushing back against labels such as best value and stuff like that.
4070600	4083600	And also, you know, with this rule, it's supposed to prevent misleading players into spending more money
4083600	4089600	than they would have otherwise by putting 30% off, 20% off, etc.
4089600	4097600	And the ASA is also a self-regulatory agency for advertising in the UK, for those who don't know.
4097600	4104600	For games that have premium currency that's only available via real-world money,
4104600	4114600	they want the advertisements and pop-ups to include a real currency value.
4114600	4124600	So, for example, if you were going to buy a weapon for 500 gems, you would be told how much it is in pounds.
4124600	4132600	I hate that this article keeps going back to dollars when this is about UK stuff and the dollar isn't used there.
4133600	4140600	So, anyway, if an ad appears in-game, it'll say, oh, it's X gems and X pounds.
4140600	4146600	So, I really think that that's a good idea.
4148600	4152600	Yeah, I'll be curious to see if that has any type of, like, ripple effects to over here.
4152600	4157600	But at the same time, usually it's kind of like when the UK passed that law about internet cookies and stuff.
4157600	4161600	Like, we all have to deal with it, too, because now all the websites have that pop-up.
4161600	4163600	This site may use cookies, you know, and all that stuff.
4163600	4165600	And I block everyone that I can.
4165600	4168600	Yeah, some of them are very deceitful in the way they do it, though.
4168600	4170600	But, you know, big surprise, right?
4170600	4171600	It is what it is.
4171600	4172600	Yeah.
4172600	4174600	Well, go ahead.
4174600	4180600	Well, I was just going to say the big thing about this is that, you know, they've made these requests, right?
4180600	4184600	They've requested devs give notifications about, like, loot boxes.
4184600	4189600	But they're still trying to get loot boxes made, like, gambling.
4189600	4197600	But the thing is, is that they aren't able to interpret or enforce the legislations or find companies that break their guidance.
4197600	4201600	But they can refer the serious offenders to other regulators.
4201600	4205600	So they're more like, this is your warning.
4205600	4207600	This is your warning.
4207600	4210600	Don't, no, don't, we're telling mom.
4213600	4214600	That's it.
4214600	4217600	We'll see what develops with this. Could be very interesting.
4217600	4218600	Let's move on.
4218600	4219600	Let's move on.
4219600	4220600	Loki.
4220600	4228600	So unfortunately, we Well, fortunately, we have news that the Twitch and the music industry have struck a deal.
4228600	4232600	Unfortunately, it's not a good deal for at least the users of which.
4232600	4247600	So the main changes that are going to happen now is instead of basically taking down your entire channel, if there's ever like a copyright strike, they are going to now remove any VODs or clips that contain the unauthorized music from the creator channel.
4247600	4264600	And if it's a live stream that's basically flagrantly, you know, violating copyright, like rebroadcasting the music concert or something like that, then they may also issue a warning or penalty depending on the creator's history of that kind of music use.
4264600	4274600	So this isn't necessarily like, I can now subscribe to something and be able to, you know, have licensed music on my channel.
4274600	4282600	No, it is not that and they haven't really given you any more tools necessarily to kind of work with this stuff.
4282600	4286600	So it's unfortunate, a little underwhelming.
4286600	4288600	This is very much a lie.
4288600	4299600	This is not this is not Oh, you can go ahead and just play music in the backgrounds of your streams like many of you used to do like have your Spotify playlist up while you're, you know, sitting there playing League of Legends or something.
4299600	4304600	You're just playing your Spotify, you know, trance favorites or whatever in the background. You can't you can't do that.
4304600	4306600	That's not what this is going to allow you to do.
4306600	4312600	This is basically kind of protecting Twitch's ass more than anything to get sued.
4312600	4319600	And I guess it's a bit of a courtesy that they will instead of giving you a strike, just delete the VOD.
4319600	4321600	That's about it. That's about all you get.
4322600	4325600	S2-100 Matt in chat says this is like the quote from the Godfather.
4325600	4331600	Here is my offer to you. Nothing.
4331600	4335600	On a related note, have you seen that latest thing going around Twitter today?
4335600	4341600	It came up kind of like later than our show roll kind of goes out, so I didn't have time to add it.
4341600	4345600	But apparently, Twitch is adding some things on the back end.
4345600	4347600	They haven't had an official announcement.
4347600	4354600	I don't know how people find these like Twitch leaks if there's like people that work at Twitch that are leaking information or what.
4354600	4361600	But there's like screenshots and stuff now that are showing that Twitch is about to enable where you can choose that your chatters,
4361600	4369600	in order to chat in the channel, you have to have like so many so much watch time or you have had to have been following for so long
4369600	4373600	or that you have to have like a two factor authenticator on your account or things like that.
4373600	4376600	Like there's all these different things that you can add to chat.
4376600	4381600	And I want to say, was it following as well? Something else.
4381600	4385600	There's another one that they had put in there. They were putting restrictions on.
4385600	4394600	Unfortunately, it still has nothing to do with follow botting where you get just these random bots that follow you.
4394600	4398600	And some of them have really gross avatars and usernames.
4398600	4403600	In fact, you may be experiencing some of that while this show is going on tonight.
4403600	4408600	You may have noticed and we're trying to, you know, just shoot it out of here.
4408600	4413600	Luckily, our stream labs does not work like 99 percent of streamers stream labs.
4413600	4423600	So it's probably confusing whatever little little child is trying to play that game right now is that it's not where it's not having the same effect on this channel that it has most places.
4423600	4426600	Thank you. Tiger class says one of them is verified email.
4426600	4442600	It also does not stop hate raids. So I'm meaning the actual rating of a channel from an account with very few followers, not affiliate or anything like that, who uses disgusting images as their profile picture.
4442600	4448600	So it doesn't stop that either. Hopefully that is coming.
4449600	4458600	But I guess it's a first start. I mean, it's a little late, but all right, let's try to acknowledge its movement in the right direction.
4458600	4466600	It's where we need to go. I will give it one clap. It's not even implemented, actually. It only gets a golf clap for now.
4466600	4470600	Then when we actually get the implementation, maybe there'll be more to say.
4470600	4474600	As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, Twitch is giving folks a cookie with this new feature they're adding.
4474600	4479600	We're all going to take a bite, but there's a chance there might be raisins there. Yep.
4479600	4484600	All right. Let's talk about more lawsuits. We have a lot of legal news tonight.
4484600	4490600	Let's talk about Quantic Dream, which, of course, is the developer behind Detroit Heavy Rain.
4490600	4499600	Recently, they went to a libel action against French newspapers who published allegations of misconduct that happened at the company in 2018.
4499600	4505600	The court has now ruled on kind of a split decision, which is interesting.
4505600	4517600	Quantic Dream did win the libel suit against Le Monde, the French newspaper, but it lost the other libel suit against Media Part, which was the other French newspaper.
4517600	4523600	Apparently, this is kind of weird because these pieces were like a collaboration between them all.
4523600	4528600	So this is one of those the court doesn't make any sense in this regard.
4528600	4537600	And many of us are sitting here like Nick Fury going, given this decision, I have chosen to ignore it or whatever that line is.
4537600	4545600	It's kind of kind of wild what's going on. Media Part won the suit by proving that there was good faith reporting practices.
4545600	4548600	They're saying that's kind of one of the key differences here.
4548600	4557600	But Le Monde failed to meet the burden of proof, which was the unwillingness to disclose the anonymous sources to the court.
4557600	4560600	Also, some folks that analyze what happens in French courts.
4560600	4567600	You can't put the same standards that you might be used to in the U.S. or from all the law and order that you watch.
4567600	4571600	And so you think you know about court. It doesn't work the same way in France.
4571600	4574600	French libel cases are known to be notoriously difficult.
4574600	4583600	You have to prove not only what you're saying is true, but that you had all the evidence at the time that the article in question or whatever it is is published.
4583600	4591600	And all of that burden falls on the defendant. So that might explain why Le Monde didn't didn't work out there.
4591600	4600600	But the fact that one of them won because media part one, it kind of does show that the allegations against Quantic Dream.
4600600	4603600	Were there was probably a spark of truth in there.
4603600	4609600	Allegedly, I have to choose my words carefully because apparently Quantic Dream will sue anybody that misstates it.
4609600	4616600	But if if it sure looks like from this court ruling, it wouldn't have gone their way if there wasn't some truth in it.
4616600	4620600	So that's what I see in that situation. So.
4620600	4625600	All right. Now, now the folks in Chad are arguing about oatmeal raisin cookies.
4626600	4638600	Here's the thing. I enjoy an oatmeal raisin cookie when you tell me it's an oatmeal raisin cookie and I have time for my taste buds to prepare for that oatmeal and raisin taste.
4638600	4643600	When you mix it in a plate that also has chocolate chip cookies.
4643600	4648600	That's not nice. I would say the exact same thing with carob chips.
4648600	4652600	I'm sorry. Carob chips are not chocolate. I understand why they exist.
4652600	4656600	I understand. You know, that's fine. Just you need to warn me.
4656600	4661600	You need to warn me. All right. Moving on.
4661600	4668600	Let's let's go back to a simpler time when we were gaming and had lots of cookies in our next segment.
4668600	4671600	For the record.
4671600	4674600	Oh.
4678600	4686600	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4686600	4690600	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4690600	4696600	All right. Dark soccer. What did you pick tonight? And anything else you might want to clarify?
4696600	4703600	Well, I was going to say cranberry oatmeal cookies with chocolate chips are divine.
4703600	4709600	I can go with that. I like cranberries or like Jason said, cranberry orange cookies are also divine.
4709600	4714600	Oh, they make a chip. That's really good. Anyway, we can all see the game on screen.
4714600	4724600	So the game in question is Super Fantasy Zone, which is a game actually that I would love to get my hands on.
4724600	4727600	I have been looking for a legit copy for a while.
4727600	4734600	And if someone could make sure that that lands in my hands, I would love you forever.
4734600	4743600	Anyway, the game came out in only in Europe and Japan.
4743600	4753600	It was released in Japan on January 14th, 1992 and Europe September 11th, 1992.
4753600	4760600	And we didn't get a US release on anything until July 21st, 2008.
4760600	4766600	It came out on Virtual Console. It was also included on the Sega Genesis Mini.
4766600	4771600	So it's a free-moving shoot-em-up. It's like all the other fantasy zones.
4771600	4778600	But it has the distinction of being on the Mega Drive or the Genesis as we had it over here.
4778600	4786600	It's got really good music. It really fits the feel of the original games.
4786600	4792600	It had a different composer. It was Kodaka Naoki.
4792600	4800600	But it had lots of the themes that kind of went along with the original Fantasy Zone music that was done by Kawaguchi Hiroshi.
4800600	4806600	So in this particular game, you are playing as the Oppa Oppa.
4806600	4813600	And he's fighting to avenge the death of his father, Oppa Oppa, who was killed defen-
4813600	4818600	Sorry, I don't know why Siri is talking to me because this is stupid.
4818600	4822600	Apparently, Siri thinks that she's the Oppa Oppa. I'm just saying.
4822600	4828600	Anyway, he was killed defending Fantasy Zone against Dark Menon.
4828600	4840600	And Oppa Oppa has to cleanse the Fantasy Zone of these evil creatures, evil beings, and restore peace.
4840600	4846600	So it's very Defender. I would say this is the logical spiritual-
4846600	4850600	The series is a spiritual successor to Defender.
4850600	4853600	You have to shoot down all the enemy generators.
4853600	4861600	And then once it's destroyed, all of them are destroyed in the level, you get a Menon Guardian that you have to fight, which is the boss of the level.
4862600	4864600	And you also collect gold.
4864600	4867600	And the gold is used in the store.
4867600	4872600	And you can buy certain things that do have a limited use.
4874600	4879600	I love getting the five-ton weight that you can just drop on people.
4879600	4883600	And the rocket jets and the bigger wings and all of that.
4884600	4890600	And you get a lot of gold when you beat the Guardians.
4890600	4893600	I mean, it's just Fantasy Zone. It's how all Fantasy Zones are.
4894600	4899600	The best thing about the Oppa Oppa is that he'll fly around with his cute little wings.
4899600	4904600	But when he's on the ground, he has little feet and walks around.
4907600	4913600	Anyway, this one was developed by Sunsoft and published by Sega.
4914600	4921600	And really, it was just the 16-bit entry into the Fantasy Zone series.
4923600	4926600	And Fantasy Zone is deceptively hard.
4926600	4932600	I mean, if you have good reaction time, it can be pretty easy.
4932600	4936600	But there's a lot of stuff going on on the screen at any given point in time.
4936600	4940600	And the bosses are pretty bullet hell style.
4940600	4943600	You know, before there was real bullet hell.
4944600	4947600	But they're fun games and have great music.
4947600	4952600	To this day, though, my favorite is still Fantasy Zone 2, Tears of an Oppa Oppa.
4954600	4955600	And that's it.
4956600	4957600	Alright.
4957600	4960600	As I'm finishing a cookie over here myself.
4960600	4961600	Can you guess what kind of cookie I'm having?
4961600	4962600	Girl!
4962600	4963600	What?
4963600	4965600	I'm having a JoJo.
4965600	4967600	So that's a Trader Joe's knockoff Oreo.
4967600	4969600	They have pumpkin.
4969600	4973600	Because Alan went to Trader Joe's last week during the show, actually.
4973600	4975600	During all the pumpkin things.
4975600	4976600	And he brought them all home.
4976600	4977600	So, there you go.
4977600	4978600	Anyway.
4978600	4979600	Rob.
4979600	4980600	Yes?
4980600	4982600	I did not, by the way, have a pumpkin spice latte.
4982600	4985600	Because this year I'm not going to have one at all.
4985600	4987600	Well, that's disappointing.
4987600	4992600	But I had a chai with the apple stuff in it.
4992600	4994600	Oh, I love the apple drink.
4994600	4996600	It was delightful.
4996600	4998600	But too sweet.
4998600	5001600	They definitely need a sugar-free version.
5001600	5006600	It is a very different kind of drink.
5006600	5007600	It's very sweet.
5007600	5008600	But I love it.
5008600	5009600	Well, no.
5009600	5013600	I didn't have their macchiato thing because I don't like caramel.
5013600	5014600	Oh.
5014600	5015600	But I had it.
5015600	5018600	You had the stuff in another drink, basically.
5018600	5019600	Yeah.
5019600	5021600	I had a chai with the apple stuff.
5021600	5023600	I think next time I do it.
5023600	5024600	Just get it without caramel.
5024600	5026600	It's just a drizzle they put on top.
5026600	5027600	It's easy to get it without it.
5027600	5029600	But I wanted it with the chai.
5029600	5030600	Oh, that works.
5030600	5032600	To get the spiciness out of the chai.
5032600	5033600	All right.
5033600	5036600	But next time I do it, I'm going to do half as much of the apple.
5036600	5043600	The thing is that I want pumpkin flavored things and not pumpkin spice flavored things.
5043600	5044600	Does that make sense?
5044600	5045600	Oh, yeah.
5045600	5046600	Yeah.
5046600	5047600	I want pumpkin soup.
5047600	5051600	I've been lectured on the difference many times by many people, as if I don't know,
5051600	5053600	anytime my pumpkin spice thing comes up.
5053600	5057600	The other thing is, is that a lot of places will go way too heavy on certain mixes of
5057600	5059600	the spice.
5059600	5065600	And that combined with just the overwhelming sugary-ness of their syrup.
5065600	5067600	I can't drink it anymore.
5067600	5068600	It's too much.
5068600	5071600	Now, speaking of drinks, and before we get back into some news.
5071600	5073600	I will make it at home, by the way.
5073600	5078600	I want to bring up the classic drink of the week because, Jamie, you will get a kick out
5078600	5079600	of this.
5079600	5081600	I am actually drinking, and this is not an endorsement.
5081600	5082600	They don't pay us for this.
5082600	5086600	However, those of you that listen to OLR, back in the day, there's going to be two or
5086600	5088600	three of you that are going to get this joke.
5088600	5090600	I apologize, but give us this joke.
5090600	5095600	We'll notice on camera that I am currently drinking a Propel.
5095600	5096600	Yeah.
5096600	5102600	And you might remember, back when we played DDR and we were quote unquote working out
5102600	5107600	a lot and really sweating to some of those nine footers that we would play in DDR, the
5108600	5114600	Propel kind of became that drink that everyone fucking had for like the hydration and all
5114600	5115600	that stuff.
5115600	5116600	Again, this is not an endorsement.
5116600	5118600	It is just, we all were really into it.
5118600	5121600	It was, you know, and it's, it tastes pretty good actually.
5121600	5126600	And yeah, so they, they have them at Costco and Alan got a bunch of these for his workouts
5126600	5128600	and I steal from them once in a remember.
5128600	5129600	I'm sorry.
5129600	5130600	I was reading chat.
5130600	5131600	I steal from them once in a while.
5131600	5135600	I like Propel for a while and then I think they changed their formula.
5135600	5139600	They may, they still taste similar to me, but they definitely changed the look.
5139600	5140600	Yeah.
5140600	5146600	We, um, we've actually been going for a Pocari sweat in our house, which actually tastes
5146600	5151600	very salty, like sweat and kind of looks like sweat, but Dan likes it.
5151600	5154600	I actually thought this was an apple flavored beverage at first, but actually it's Kiwi
5154600	5156600	strawberry, which apparently I can't tell the difference.
5156600	5157600	There you go.
5157600	5158600	I don't like Kiwi.
5158600	5160600	I don't like Kiwi anything.
5160600	5161600	Oh, I don't mind it.
5161600	5162600	I like it.
5162600	5164600	You can have all of it, Rob.
5164600	5167600	I just want like a regular strawberry flavor.
5167600	5170600	Um, for the record, I'm addicted to pink drinks.
5170600	5175600	The end fifth dream in chat says I drink a lot of Propel and Powerade power water because
5175600	5176600	zero sugar.
5176600	5179600	Yeah, that is another, it is zero sugar, which you know, is important.
5179600	5180600	Uh, orange.
5180600	5181600	Right.
5181600	5182600	Says I kind of remember that.
5182600	5185600	And dark Tetsuya says a Pepperidge farm remembers by which I mean, I remember.
5185600	5186600	So there you go.
5186600	5187600	Your classic drink of the week.
5187600	5188600	All right.
5189600	5191600	Or we could talk about what I had at the bar last night.
5191600	5194600	I also had some drinks last night, but I'll say that for another episode.
5194600	5195600	All right.
5195600	5199600	Let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some other news around the industry
5199600	5200600	pretty quickly.
5200600	5201600	Uh, low key.
5201600	5202600	We'll start with you.
5202600	5203600	Yeah.
5203600	5207600	Let's talk about some stuff that was announced during the to dumb.
5207600	5209600	I love that name of that event.
5209600	5215600	Uh, the Netflix event that they were talking about the brand new season of the Witcher
5215600	5216600	is going to be coming.
5216600	5219600	Um, that's on December 17th.
5219600	5226600	Also, they're going to be making a kid's show that's based off the Witcher, maybe a Witcher
5226600	5227600	babies.
5227600	5228600	No.
5228600	5229600	Yes.
5229600	5231600	Um, I guess we'll wait and see.
5231600	5236600	And then also the league of legends animated series that's supposed to be coming out as
5236600	5237600	well.
5237600	5240600	That is going to be debuting on November 6th.
5240600	5243600	So look forward to that as well.
5244600	5247600	And I not necessarily gaming related.
5247600	5252600	I know some people don't necessarily like it, but I think the new, uh, live action,
5252600	5255600	um, cowboy view up looks pretty awesome.
5255600	5258600	And they released that intro is perfect for that.
5258600	5264600	And I'm, I'm down for that, but that's, uh, that's that.
5264600	5271600	And then, um, not Netflix related the games for October is PlayStation plus have been
5271600	5274600	announced or leaked or however you want to call that.
5274600	5282600	And those include hell let loose mortal combat X and PGA tour two K 21.
5282600	5288600	So, um, yeah, look forward to those in a couple of weeks.
5290600	5294600	I'll finally be able to pick up mortal combat 10 or X or whatever it's called.
5294600	5296600	Nice X 10.
5296600	5297600	Yeah, it's good.
5297600	5299600	Cause it's, it's, it is mortal combat X.
5299600	5305600	They did say that at one point it's, it's meant, it's meant to be a pun, but it's final fantasy 10.
5305600	5307600	Do you remember? That was a good OLR moment.
5307600	5314600	Do you remember when we emailed them to get clarification and they actually responded like that?
5314600	5318600	That was back in the day when like podcasts were actually important.
5318600	5324600	We actually got a response from square Enix and they told us it is pronounced 10 or 10 is no, it was 10, two.
5324600	5326600	It is pronounced 10, two, not X two.
5326600	5327600	All right.
5327600	5328600	All right.
5328600	5330600	Anyway, and I could have told you that.
5330600	5336600	I did tell everybody that, but no one believed me, but I think we wanted to get it from, we, we wanted to get it from the horse's mouth.
5336600	5338600	We were like, well, can't we just ask them?
5338600	5341600	And it's, it's like the one time they actually cared what we thought.
5341600	5343600	It's great.
5343600	5344600	All right.
5344600	5347600	Anyway, uh, let's move on.
5347600	5350600	Uh, I think dark soccer, we have your stories.
5350600	5356600	Yes, there is another series of games that I absolutely love and it's the cotton games.
5356600	5375600	And something that I would have just murdered to have my, my hands on as the, uh, the, uh, cotton guardian for Saturn tribute and panorama cotton, which panorama cotton, I think they only made 600 copies of one of my friends has one.
5375600	5385600	Um, but, but this particular, um, release is going to have cotton, uh, guardian force, uh, Saturn tribute cotton, 100% and panorama cotton.
5385600	5392600	It is, uh, they haven't said what platforms it's gonna, um, actually hold on for a second.
5392600	5400600	Um, guardian for Saturn tribute is due on PS4 and switch on September 30th in Japan with English text.
5400600	5412600	Um, the other two ports, uh, do not have a release dates on them, just that they're going to come out by Indian games and strictly limited games, uh, in 2021.
5412600	5414600	And you know, I'm going to have them.
5414600	5415600	Yeah.
5415600	5419600	Um, and reminder, if you haven't picked it up already, the cotton reboot came out recently.
5419600	5422600	Um, dark Tetsuya says, I still need to get ahold of the cotton reboot.
5422600	5423600	Yeah, that came out on switch.
5423600	5425600	I'm being given a copy.
5425600	5429600	Oh, well, how nice, how nice that people give you things.
5429600	5434600	No, I believe I have, I have friends who order too many copies.
5434600	5441600	Um, I, uh, I know I've, I think I've done panorama cotton as a classic game.
5441600	5445600	And you've done like several games in the series is a classic game with it.
5445600	5449600	It's been like 600 episodes that segment, but yes, yes.
5450600	5459600	Well, the thing is that for those who don't know panorama cotton, apart from just its rarity was also pretty difficult to emulate.
5459600	5467600	It is a scrolling behind the character behind the shoulder, actually the full character shooter.
5467600	5474600	Um, and it actually had its own sequel on the dream cast called rainbow cotton.
5474600	5478600	That when rainbow cotton came out, you best believe I had it.
5478600	5483600	And it's, it's really fun and fucking hard.
5483600	5488600	Even I want to get the cotton reboot as one of those things where it's like, Oh, Jamie never shuts up about how great this game is.
5488600	5490600	And it does look really cute.
5490600	5491600	Oh yeah.
5491600	5493600	Games are great.
5493600	5498600	I mean the whole cotton series, and I'm going to tell you right now with this cutesy as it is, it's not easy.
5498600	5501600	Um, it is a challenging game.
5501600	5507600	Orange right in chat with our Wiki master, which I guess is actually now like what fandom or whatever they changed it into.
5507600	5509600	Anyway, there is a whole orange launch radio Wiki.
5509600	5516600	I've done two cotton games where certain things have been, um, uh, uh, tracked and yes, magical night dreams.
5516600	5522600	Cotton boomerang was episode 251, which was actually the second classic game of the week.
5522600	5526600	We changed that segment from your website of the week or whatever it was before that.
5527600	5529600	Uh, we changed that on episode 250.
5529600	5531600	So it wasn't the first, but it was the second.
5531600	5533600	I think the first was probably guardian legend.
5533600	5535600	I believe it was.
5535600	5540600	Or you may or may have been one of the fan, one of the other fantasy zone games, actually, if that's come to my head.
5540600	5541600	I don't remember.
5541600	5543600	It was long ago and I'm old.
5543600	5547600	Well, it's all right there on the Wiki and I'm sure, I'm sure it's about to get paced in the chat.
5547600	5554600	And orange right also says panorama cotton was 486 and 250 was fantasy zone.
5554600	5555600	So that was my first one.
5555600	5556600	It was your first one.
5556600	5557600	Wow. How interesting.
5557600	5559600	That's come full circle tonight on 885.
5559600	5561600	And I think I've done like two other fantasy zone games.
5561600	5562600	I'm pretty sure.
5562600	5565600	I'm like, I didn't even know these fantasy zone games existed.
5565600	5566600	It's pretty impressive.
5567600	5568600	Yeah.
5568600	5573600	Well, I know, like, I think I've even done like some super obscure shit like puzzle in this.
5573600	5574600	Oh, of course.
5574600	5581600	Let's I mean, after 600 episodes of the segment, do you think we'll ever retire this segment and move on to a new segment?
5581600	5584600	No, no, I don't think I get new access to games every year.
5584600	5585600	Exactly.
5585600	5586600	New new game show every year.
5586600	5591600	And also we've mixed it up with like the flag and that stuff.
5591600	5594600	I do think maybe I'm just gonna throw this out there.
5594600	5596600	Maybe for that.
5596600	5597600	And this is your call, Jamie.
5597600	5611600	But but for the 20th anniversary next year, maybe you should reopen the archives for like the ultimate classic games of the week and like revive 12 really good ones.
5612600	5617600	But that's not if you want to do it again, maybe you don't want to do them again.
5617600	5622600	But I'm like, I can't do the classic game master list.
5622600	5628600	The the classic game segment is now eligible to be a classic game.
5630600	5634600	So I think it's time to be a meta on that a little bit.
5635600	5636600	All right.
5637600	5638600	I'll think about it.
5639600	5643600	Orange right in chat says, I do like it when the reboot still have the original included.
5643600	5647600	I wish that Actraiser remaster included the Super Nintendo version.
5647600	5649600	Yes, I'm with you there, Orange, right?
5649600	5652600	But can't you play that anyway on the game store?
5652600	5658600	I do not believe it is part of the I think it was on Virtual Console back in the Wii U, Wii days.
5658600	5663600	But I do not believe it is in the Switch online library.
5664600	5665600	Why the fuck not?
5666600	5670600	Because of this game that we just got, I'm guessing in part, but that's a great question.
5670600	5671600	Why the fuck not?
5672600	5673600	All right. I'm sorry.
5673600	5677600	Yeah. So next year I'll count down my top 12 classic games.
5677600	5678600	Love it.
5678600	5679600	All right.
5679600	5681600	One other story here, right?
5682600	5685600	Oh, yeah, I guess I get to talk about other stuff.
5685600	5686600	Rapid fire.
5687600	5689600	I can't brain rob.
5689600	5690600	It's fine.
5690600	5701600	So there is a legend in Japan that is closing its doors after a 28 year run.
5701600	5707600	And it is the Sega, right now I'm having trouble pronouncing stuff.
5707600	5714600	Ikebukuro Gigo arcade is closing on, it's already closed on September 20th.
5715600	5720600	So alas, thank you for 28 years.
5721600	5726600	And the loudspeakers played Hotaru no Hikari, which is Light of the Firefly.
5726600	5733600	And it's usually played right before Japanese stores close or right at closing time.
5735600	5737600	And it's gone.
5738600	5739600	I had a big crowd.
5739600	5740600	Everyone was sad.
5740600	5741600	Yeah.
5741600	5742600	Yeah.
5742600	5744600	As Joe and Matt is echoing that folks crowded the Sega arcade.
5744600	5746600	It was wild seeing the video for it.
5746600	5748600	I didn't think there was video out there, but that's.
5748600	5750600	Oh, I'm sure there's video.
5750600	5751600	It has to exist.
5751600	5754600	I hope everybody was behaving and waving wearing their masks.
5754600	5755600	All right.
5755600	5756600	This is Japan.
5756600	5757600	Yeah, that's true.
5757600	5758600	All right.
5761600	5762600	All right.

5765600	5768600	Let's go to the U.S. Loki.
5769600	5770600	Yeah.
5770600	5773600	So we've got a few games coming out this week.
5773600	5779600	Way, the survival series that's on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and Xbox One.

5841600	5846600	Oh boy, I'm super excited for E-Football 2022.
5846600	5849600	That's coming out on pretty much everything.
5850600	5852600	Yep, super excited about that one.
5852600	5853600	Pass.
5853600	5863600	No, the one I'm actually excited about is Hot Wheels Unleashed on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X.
5863600	5865600	Actually looks really cool.
5865600	5869600	The Legend of Heroes, Kurano Kistake.

5872600	5879600	We've got Mary Skelter Finale on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

5886600	5893600	Toy Soldiers HD on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5893600	5901600	And the not quite better than E-Football 2022, but it is yet another football game, FIFA 22.
5901600	5913600	Your gambling loot box simulator that is coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Stadia, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
5913600	5916600	Actually, I would say probably most of those last gen systems.
5916600	5922600	Just make sure it's not the Legacy Edition because Legacy Edition means we just updated the roster and threw it back out again for 60 bucks.
5922600	5924600	Pay attention to those.
5924600	5926600	Also, it sucks. Just don't buy it.
5926600	5927600	The end.
5927600	5931600	Alright, moving over to Japan and checking out the releases there.
5931600	5933600	On the Nintendo Switch this week, this is interesting.
5933600	5937600	Hades gets its Japanese release this week on the 30th.
5937600	5939600	I don't know if that's been redubbed.
5939600	5945600	The voice acting is some of the neatest part of that game, so I'm curious if they've redone it in Japanese.
5945600	5949600	I assume so, but the screenshots aren't giving me any indication one way or the other.
5949600	5953600	But regardless, the official Japanese releases this week on the Switch.
5953600	5960600	Also in Japan this week, we talked a little bit about this earlier, but Cotton Guardian Force Saturn Tribute is out this week in Japan.
5960600	5967600	We also have B Project, Ryusei Fantasia is out this week in several different editions.
5967600	5970600	Hot Wheels Unleashed also makes its way to Japan this week.
5970600	5976600	And that Melty Blood type Lumina is also available in Japan in a regular and limited type of edition.
5976600	5981600	Miyamoto's Arithmetic Classroom, the complete puzzle collection to become smart.
5983600	5989600	I don't know why that name is so fucking funny to me.
5989600	5993600	But it is just like, hey, if you play this game, you will be smart. The end.
5993600	5996600	Only geniuses play this game.
5996600	6001600	Only a genius can pass level 7.
6001600	6003600	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
6003600	6005600	It's a mobile game, add the game.
6005600	6008600	Anyway, that is out of Japan this week.
6008600	6010600	I don't know of a US equivalent to that.
6010600	6015600	Miyamoto's Arithmetic Classroom, the complete puzzle collection to become smart.
6015600	6018600	Alright, there it is. The definitive smart people.
6018600	6021600	If it was to become dumb, it's just all wrong.
6021600	6025600	Orange Riot puts add, fail, simple puzzle.
6025600	6027600	That shit happens to me all the time.
6027600	6029600	And I hate when I actually play those stupid little ad games.
6029600	6035600	But you know the one where the fire is going through and it's about to set the guy on fire and you're supposed to turn a thing?
6035600	6037600	Well, sometimes I just want to kill the guy, okay?
6038600	6040600	Sometimes I just close the game.
6040600	6049600	I love to play the game on Twitter. It's called block the account that's advertising that. Block the sponsored account.
6049600	6057600	On the PlayStation 5 this week in Japan, Saints Row the third remastered gets its Japanese release this week.
6057600	6058600	So there's that.
6058600	6063600	And then Hot Wheels Unleashed and Hades also on the PlayStation 5 this week.
6063600	6067600	FIFA 22 also on its way by the time the weekend comes around.
6067600	6070600	Let's go to the UK.
6070600	6076600	So for the remainder of September, on the 28th we have Hercule Poirot.
6076600	6081600	I always mispronounce this guy's name, the writer. Poirot, the first cases.
6081600	6084600	We have Overcooked Special Edition.
6084600	6088600	We have The Escapists 2. Golf with your friends.
6088600	6091600	Friends don't let friends play golf, yo.
6091600	6095600	Poker Club. We have Crisis Remastered.
6095600	6099600	Ori The Collection. Ghostrunner.
6099600	6104600	In Sound Mind, on the 29th we have Insurgency Sandstorm.
6104600	6110600	30th we have V-Rally 4. Darksiders 3. Crazy Chicken Shooter bundle.
6110600	6112600	And Hot Wheels Unleashed.
6113600	6120600	And then in October we have Away the Survival series.
6120600	6123600	Gree is coming out on Switch.
6123600	6127600	Chernobylite, also on the first PlayStation.
6127600	6129600	Sonic Colors Ultimate.
6129600	6134600	We also have Blaze and the Monster Machines Axle City Racers.
6134600	6137600	Rico London.
6137600	6139600	Phoenix Point.
6139600	6141600	Bugsnax.
6141600	6143600	And FIFA 22.
6143600	6147600	What's Crazy Chicken Shooter bundle? Because you got my attention with that one.
6147600	6148600	I closed it.
6148600	6152600	It's shovelware. They're Crazy Chicken Shooter.
6152600	6157600	Let's go down the rabbit hole about the Crazy Chicken Shooter saga here.
6157600	6161600	That all started on the Wii. Yeah, it was on the Wii, actually.
6161600	6164600	Wait, shovelware? On the Wii?
6164600	6166600	I know, on my Wii.
6166600	6176600	So it was a bunch of just really cheap, I guess, arcade shooter games.
6176600	6181600	And they made a lot of them because they were shovelware and cheap to produce.
6181600	6186600	So now it's a collection of those because you'd want a collection of those for some reason.
6186600	6188600	Fantastic.
6188600	6194600	Alright, let's move on to some more stories.
6194600	6197600	Loki, why don't you start us off with this first story.
6197600	6199600	Yes.
6199600	6213600	So, apparently people are upset with Good Ol' Games because the Hitman Game of the Year edition, which launched on GOG recently, has DRM.
6213600	6220600	And because GOG prides itself on being DRM-free, people are not happy about that.
6220600	6226600	So they are review bombing the game because the game does have online DRM.
6226600	6235600	And that is kind of the reason why people purchase stuff on GOG in the first place is because they know it's going to be DRM-free.
6236600	6245600	Not sure what they're going to do to necessarily address that, if anything, but just keep that in mind if you're going to purchase the game, that it's going to have DRM on there.
6245600	6251600	But to be fair, it does say on the actual store page that it does have DRM, but people are still mad about it.
6251600	6253600	It's the principle of the thing, I guess.
6253600	6258600	Well, I think it's also kind of like, you know, it kind of goes against what GOG is so known for, you know?
6258600	6260600	Yes, definitely.
6261600	6270600	But they are saying, though, if you have purchased the game and you're not satisfied with that, you can use your right to refund the game.
6270600	6277600	At the same time, they said that they also want some feedback and they're not going to tolerate review bombing.
6283600	6286600	Let's talk about TwitchCon coming back.
6286600	6292600	Not this year. Some people saw the headline and thought it was this year. Isn't that a little soon? No, no.
6292600	6296600	But TwitchCon is planning to come back in 2022.
6296600	6302600	Now, of course, you know, we're all hoping the COVID situation is in a very different place come 2022.
6302600	6303600	I want to go.
6303600	6305600	I want to go, too.
6305600	6308600	So you know what's going to be interesting about this?
6308600	6316600	Let me just quickly say TwitchCon will be in Amsterdam in July 2022 and TwitchCon will be in San Diego in October 2022.
6316600	6323600	This is very similar to what they were trying to do in 2020 before all this happened.
6323600	6326600	So they're kind of going back to that schedule.
6326600	6329600	Yeah, Dark Soccer is saying I want to go. I absolutely want to go as well.
6329600	6334600	And I think what's going to be interesting about this, I don't know if it's because of the pandemic or what,
6334600	6340600	but because Twitch culture really feels like it's grown so much.
6340600	6342600	I feel like there's a lot of people that want to go.
6342600	6349600	I'm starting to wonder if this con is going to run into like ticket and availability issues like some other cons hit.
6349600	6352600	I worry that we're going to hit that with this con.
6352600	6356600	So if you're going to go, I would get your ticket as soon as they go on sale.
6356600	6363600	There is that even my Defton chat says I want to go to TwitchCon San Diego is like a three hour car drive.
6363600	6367600	I might finally meet Mike Deft. That would be fun. That'd be great.
6367600	6370600	We'll see. But yeah, I definitely have my sights on TwitchCon.
6370600	6375600	I want to go. Dark Soccer says she wants to go. Loki would probably go if he could.
6375600	6379600	So Alan will probably want to go. In fact, I know he wants to go.
6379600	6385600	He wants to meet all the Twitch streamers he hangs out with that are all going to be there, you know, which are pretty much all we all we all know.
6385600	6395600	If you watch any Dead by Daylight on Twitch, there is a running gag in multiple channels that Dark Soccer and I clearly watch the same people.
6395600	6400600	Clearly, it mostly happens in puddings.
6400600	6405600	And who was it? Was it bourbon the other day?
6405600	6409600	Maybe I'm actually not sure I follow him, but I watch him oddly and I need to just follow him.
6409600	6412600	I don't know. Yeah, bourbon actually today.
6412600	6418600	And, you know, I like I like to give, you know, some streamers a shout out, but bourbon was my champion today.
6418600	6423600	Plugging up my my marathon tomorrow and bourbon and homotron.
6423600	6426600	I know we've both been in homotrons. You got one from puddings.
6426600	6429600	I just got the push alert on my phone, too. Oh, really? Yeah.
6429600	6432600	Puddings is also like they're just fantastic people.
6432600	6437600	I love this community and I watch some of Hydro's tournament, by the way, him in Losing Color.
6437600	6443600	I saw a little bit of that. Yeah, it was hilarious. OK, Miss Barn, her whole thing.
6443600	6449600	Hilarious. The the meme age was up there.
6449600	6455600	I'll shout out Tay plays games because that's the person I watch the most, probably of Dead by Daylight.
6455600	6459600	She's our buddy. And then I'm trying to think who else? Who am I missing?
6459600	6462600	There's oh, oh, Nick and Isaac. Yeah, Nick.
6462600	6465600	Oh, seeing their channel. So anyway. All right.
6465600	6471600	And honestly, the both of them are two of the nicest people ever.
6471600	6474600	I'll just put that out there, although I liked Evil Co.
6474600	6479600	But with God, that was so funny with all these random ass twitch shout outs that we're doing.
6479600	6485600	It's relevant because all of these people, I'm positive, are making plans to go to TwitchCon.
6485600	6489600	And it's going to be a big meetup of that whole circle and other circles.
6489600	6493600	That's why I'm kind of like I almost worry it might be too big.
6493600	6497600	But I guess the San Diego Convention Center is pretty big, right? Because that's where they do Comic-Con.
6497600	6505600	So maybe it can handle it. We'll see. I'm going to have to order like a crate of Dark Sakura masks.
6505600	6510600	No one special 77 in chat says, as fun as TwitchCon sounds, I just can't go due to finances and health.
6510600	6514600	Well, for what it's worth, because it is TwitchCon, it'll be streaming on Twitch.
6514600	6517600	A lot of it. I know it. You don't get the people that way.
6517600	6524600	But as far as places to see me next year, the only thing I can like 100%, 1000% confirm for next year,
6524600	6530600	I will absolutely be a DragonCon 2022. So like I already know that that will happen.
6530600	6535600	So you can plan on that for Labor Day if you're in the southeast part of the country.
6535600	6539600	But I am trying to now that conventions seem likely again,
6539600	6544600	now that we know that conventions are possible with precautions and that whole thing,
6544600	6549600	and hopefully with COVID, hopefully starting to fade a little bit as we get into next year,
6549600	6553600	I think it opens up the opportunity to doing more conventions.
6553600	6557600	There's going to be a local video game convention, too, that I want to do.
6557600	6561600	So because the SAC horror people are going to put it on, it's going to be a horror and gaming convention.
6561600	6564600	So that is going to be next year.
6564600	6569600	Well, I've also got maybe DerpyCon next year, so I don't know what's going to happen.
6569600	6573600	That'll be fun. Yeah. All right. Let's move on.
6573600	6577600	Let's talk a few more stories. And Dark Soccer, I think you have one.
6577600	6583600	I do. Right. Right. Oh, yeah. Duh. I'm sorry.
6583600	6589600	I'm so like brain dead today after everything. I saw Transformers the movie again in the theater today.
6589600	6595600	Well, that's fun. I think I've seen it now in the theater something like seven or eight times.
6595600	6603600	And I have it on laserdisc, so go fig. It's, you know, movie actually does not make very much continuity sense, but it's fun.
6603600	6614600	Anyway, Microsoft is rolling out a new Xbox dashboard that has an updated version of Edge, which no one fucking uses.
6614600	6621600	So they have a Chromium version of Edge that's available to everyone on Xbox One, Series X, whatever,
6621600	6629600	that allows Xbox to stream Stadia games via with access to Discord on the Web and a lot more.
6629600	6635600	It looks basically the way it does on PC or Mac. It has the collections.
6635600	6643600	It has all the stuff. And as someone who plays on Stadia, this is a pretty, pretty good thing.
6643600	6647600	I have been super happy with Stadia a lot.
6647600	6657600	Now, Nvidia is blocking access to GeForce now, but that's their problem.
6657600	6665600	Why would they do that? They just say they're investigating edge browser support, but they've got the got it blocked.
6665600	6671600	Interesting. Yeah. Like for reasons, quote fingers.
6671600	6679600	Pod culture and chat says the Chrome based edge isn't bad, actually. And yeah, that's and even in my experience with edge, like it's it's different.
6679600	6684600	Like it's it there's a reason why they separated it hard from Internet Explorer.
6684600	6690600	They really are pushing to rebrand it. And I get it like they're really they're trying again.
6690600	6699600	Well, as someone who's on a Mac, I have zero need for edge and I've disabled it on my Windows 10 build.
6699600	6703600	Well, but there's still some good news here, the fact that it can do, you know, Stadia and stuff like that.
6703600	6710600	So all is not lost. You know what, though, is pissing me off is that slobs,
6710600	6717600	SteamLab OBS still after the updates does not read Stadia on my Mac.
6717600	6725600	So I can't use all of the neat widgets and stuff I have for it. I have to use all my my browser based ones.
6725600	6731600	Sorry, you guys are going to hear some weird and see some weird discord issues. I'm having problems with the way things are set up and we're live.
6731600	6734600	And so I just have to let it play out as we're live. Sorry about that.
6735600	6740600	It's misbehaving. Did what I say go? No, you're fine.
6740600	6745600	It's it's my monitor, my earbuds that is having the problem, not the broadcast.
6745600	6752600	Sorry about that. OK. Zen Monkey 11 in chat says Edge is great with Altspace VR.
6752600	6757600	It allows us to play movies for friends inside the app in VR.
6757600	6761600	So. All right. Let's move on. Just a couple more stories for you guys.
6761600	6766600	So we're going to get to the listener roundtable. I think we actually got an email tonight and we have some other fun stuff, too.
6766600	6774600	So, Loki, last story. Yes. So this is exciting because this is one of my favorite fighting games ever.
6774600	6783600	But there is apparently developers that are in talks for Marvel versus Capcom to a remaster remake or something.
6783600	6794600	I'm assuming a remaster at this point. But yeah, apparently, you know, digital clips is in talks with, you know,
6794600	6799600	Capcom and I guess Disney and Capcom are like in talks as well.
6799600	6808600	A possible new remaster in this. So that would be very exciting as we've begun some discussions on that right now.
6808600	6814600	And we're trying to see how far we can go, but ultimately, at the end of the day, it's not really up to us.
6814600	6821600	So all we can really do is just make the best case possible and make it easy for them and see if they're interested.
6821600	6830600	OK, but still, let's send all our positive energy if this happens, because, yeah, this this is a game I would very much like to see get updated and refresh.
6830600	6836600	Please, please, please. Yes. Although I would still like to see a Marvel versus Capcom four,
6836600	6843600	but just not like that last one. Let's go back to Marvel versus Capcom at three, please.
6843600	6853600	And oh, and Mike Deff says, FYI, digital clips is composed by many who worked at Backbone Entertainment, who worked on MVC2 HD on the 360 and PS3.
6853600	6857600	Yes, I just my only thing most of the time I see digital clips associated with stuff.
6857600	6860600	It's just kind of like a really good emulation of the prior game.
6860600	6871600	And if that's what we get, then OK. But I would be so, so happy if they really like HD-ified it and like really made it something new across my fears that they do.
6871600	6878600	You know, like I think some of the early, early Xbox 360 arcade releases, they did kind of go in and do new sprites and you could switch back and forth and stuff.
6878600	6885600	I just yeah, I really hope it takes full advantage of like 4K and all that stuff that the new consoles have to offer.
6885600	6889600	But I'll just be happy if the series comes back at all. Quite right.
6889600	6893600	If I if it's just downloading a legally emulated version of the game that runs.
6893600	6898600	Well, you know what? I'll be I'll be plenty satisfied with that, to be honest.
6898600	6903600	So that way. All right. Moving on.
6903600	6908600	One more story, and it has to do with old gamer pics on the Xbox.
6908600	6915600	I know. So the Xbox Series X is going to let you switch back to your ancient Xbox 360 game pic.
6915600	6918600	But here's the thing. I never switched away.
6918600	6925600	And I guess that's the thing, too, is that if you never switched away, you still have your gamer pic.
6925600	6933600	Here's why it's relevant, is because they're actually at one time was an official Orange Lounge Radio gamer pic.
6933600	6941600	You have to go way back. But back when Microsoft had this thing called the Gamerscore blog that was kind of like their fan thing that was online,
6941600	6949600	the Gamerscore blog got together with a couple podcast networks and did some official like podcast art packs.
6949600	6953600	One of the networks does actually now both the networks don't exist anymore.
6953600	6962600	But the the network that we used to be on had one of the all games network had the second pack that went up on the store.
6962600	6968600	And so there were icons for many of the shows that you could grab. Bobby Black Wolf had one, his little Wolfie icon.
6968600	6971600	We had a pixel thing that was done by Loki.
6971600	6979600	So Loki actually Loki has an Xbox gamer pic out there that he actually did. So that is available as well.
6979600	6983600	It's also available on a T-shirt and other memorabilia as well.
6983600	6986600	The MOG network store. Oh, look at that. Very nice.
6986600	6989600	And the Black Wolf stuff as well. I think that's also true.
6989600	6995600	Vog network dot com slash shop if you want to check that out, along with some newer dark soccer designs as well.
6995600	7000600	So you can go retro, you can go modern, whatever you want to do. You got all that available to you.
7000600	7007600	But unfortunately, and I have to make this clear, you can no longer get that gamer pic around the time that blog closed down,
7007600	7012600	which was a long time ago. I guess they removed all the associated content, unfortunately.
7012600	7018600	So you can't get that official gamer pic anymore. I'm going to throw this out there.
7018600	7023600	I would love nothing more than to get it back. However, that may happen.
7023600	7028600	Although I don't think Xbox or Microsoft is interested in loading more gamer pics now because they've kind of moved past that.
7028600	7033600	And it's all about those avatar items. But I'm just going to put it out there.
7033600	7039600	However, if you want to go back to an old gamer pic that you do, if you did download it, then you still have it in your library.
7039600	7043600	So if you got it eight years ago, it's still in your library. So there is that.
7043600	7051600	And you'll be able to switch back to it because if you switched from your icon to like an avatar thing or one of the newer ones,
7051600	7057600	you could never go back to your old one. And that's why I never switched, as I heard that was the case.
7057600	7065600	And so I still have that OLR gamer pic to this day. And I'm pretty sure Bobby did the same thing with his gamer pic and never changed.
7065600	7071600	So now the feature is rolling out to a group of testers in the alpha skip ahead group.
7071600	7076600	And yeah, you only can go back to the current Xbox 360 gamer pic.
7076600	7080600	So if you want to change that gamer pic, you have to change it on an Xbox 360.
7080600	7084600	So there is that. Oh, I didn't know that.
7084600	7088600	SJ100Matt says you can take an image of that pic and upload it to your console.
7088600	7093600	You can use it. Well, as far as I'm concerned, and Loki, maybe this call is really with you.
7093600	7098600	But if you can find a way to hack that thing on your console, by all means, do it.
7098600	7102600	Get yourself an OLR logo. You agree with me, Loki?
7102600	7105600	Yeah, that's fine. I have the original image somewhere.
7105600	7108600	Yeah, maybe I should just put it up on Twitter here.
7108600	7111600	I've got it. I can put it in Discord.
7111600	7114600	Oh, fantastic. Do that. All right.
7114600	7120600	That's pretty cool. By the way, this whole feature was done as part of Microsoft's exploration time.
7120600	7124600	Employees are given half a day each week to work on projects of their choosing.
7124600	7128600	And this is what somebody chose to do. Well, we love that. Thank you.
7128600	7132600	All right. Let's get to the Listener Roundtable.
7132600	7136600	If you'd like to call us, vognetwork.com slash Discord.
7136600	7139600	We'll get you in the Discord and we'll take your calls.
7139600	7141600	But I think we actually have an email tonight.
7141600	7145600	Participate at OrangeLaundry.com is the place where you can send an email.
7145600	7148600	But we'll go to Dark Sakura.
7148600	7152600	So our email, our one email says, Hello, LR.
7152600	7155600	Hi, YYR. Happy fall, everyone.
7155600	7159600	The pumpkin spice code has been added to Pixel Poops as of this evening.
7159600	7163600	You do remember what it is, don't you? If not, check the Discord.
7163600	7166600	That is all. Have a great week, Aaron YYR.
7166600	7171600	That is the world's shortest YYR email I think we've ever got.
7171600	7173600	But for now, I'll...
7173600	7175600	What have you done with YYR?
7175600	7178600	Thank you. Thank you, YYR, for the pumpkin spice code.
7178600	7181600	If I remember correctly, and I could be...
7181600	7183600	Because I shouted a bunch of things at him.
7183600	7186600	I said, do ABBA was one thing I joked.
7186600	7191600	But I believe he had said the blood code backwards was what he was going to go with.
7191600	7193600	So it was going to be the blood code backwards.
7193600	7196600	The classic Sega Genesis, but backwards.
7196600	7199600	And I actually didn't bring it up in my gaming week last week.
7199600	7204600	But I did go to Pixel Poops and I did try it with the strawberry ice cream thing.
7204600	7207600	And that whole thing we talked about a couple weeks ago on the show.
7207600	7209600	So that was cute to see.
7209600	7215600	So yeah, and just shout out for Pixel Poops on the Steam Marketplace.
7215600	7220600	And then of course, Loki's very own Pixel Poops number two is also available on Steam.
7220600	7224600	Or you can get number two specifically on itch.io.
7224600	7228600	Over there at Techmaster Games. Is that what it's called?
7228600	7229600	Yep.
7229600	7231600	Okay, good. My memory worked today. Hooray.
7231600	7234600	All right. Thank you for the email.
7234600	7238600	If you want to send more emails, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
7238600	7241600	is the place to send those emails for a future week.
7241600	7246600	Mike Defton Chat says, check the OLR channel on Discord for the codes and the new one.
7246600	7250600	Oh, did he post it in our Discord? He did say that in the email now, didn't he?
7250600	7255600	Oops. And of course, right now I'm trying to bring it up live for getting the cams on you guys.
7255600	7258600	Oops. I guess I shouldn't do that now.
7258600	7261600	But I'm just going to assume Mike Defton is...
7261600	7265600	Was I right that it's just the blood code backwards, though?
7265600	7267600	I have to look that up.
7267600	7272600	Meanwhile, if you guys have anything for the listener roundtable, you can put that in our chat room here.
7272600	7275600	And we'll get to that here shortly.
7275600	7280600	And yes, there it is. Yeah. Oh, okay.
7280600	7284600	So he did do ABBA, but it's ABBA twice.
7284600	7286600	So it's ABBA ABBA.
7286600	7290600	Fine by me. Twice the ABBA, even better.
7290600	7293600	Perfect. Thank you, YYR.
7293600	7295600	I think that's great.
7295600	7297600	All right.
7297600	7300600	How about any last minute stories? Do we have any other...
7300600	7303600	It seemed like it was a slower week in gaming news,
7303600	7308600	but maybe there was something up that popped up on Twitter today before the show happened that I missed.
7308600	7311600	There's a tweet about the Last of Us series,
7311600	7315600	and it's looking pretty good, and I'm going to get ready to sob ugly.
7315600	7318600	Oh, you playing it?
7318600	7321600	No, the TV show.
7321600	7323600	Oh, that series.
7323600	7325600	Okay, I thought when you said series, you meant like,
7325600	7327600	okay, yes, I forgot they're making a TV show.
7327600	7329600	Yes, yes, yes. Okay, got it.
7329600	7333600	And I uploaded the icon. It's in our Discord now.
7333600	7335600	Fantastic. How about that?
7335600	7337600	All this useful information in our Discord tonight.
7337600	7340600	And I saw somebody use the exclamation command earlier.
7340600	7344600	Sorry, for whatever reason, we're not modern like that.
7344600	7347600	It's just VOG Network, our website, vognetwork.com slash Discord.
7347600	7349600	I'll get you right in there.
7349600	7352600	We have to answer those exclamation things by hand.
7352600	7354600	I don't have chat tonight either.
7354600	7359600	This is done, so I'm, yeah, I don't know.
7359600	7361600	Also a reminder, in case you didn't figure it out,
7361600	7366600	and I think I've mentioned it before, that the Konami code works in my game.
7366600	7368600	Oh, that's right. That's right.
7368600	7373600	No, you hinted at that before, but I don't think we ever got confirmation on that, so that's fun.
7373600	7374600	Yep, it works.
7374600	7377600	And you just put out that plus addition of your game too, right?
7377600	7383600	I did, yeah. So then also with that too, you can hold the A button when you press start,
7383600	7385600	and you play as the female character.
7385600	7386600	Oh, great.
7386600	7392600	So there's no real change other than the image, but it's something.
7392600	7397600	I was going to make changes, but then I was like, eh, I'm not.
7397600	7402600	Well, because women don't poop, so there would just be flowers that you would lay on the ground, right?
7402600	7407600	Well, why did nobody tell me that? The women don't poop.
7407600	7408600	Oh.
7408600	7412600	I've been doing the bathroom wrong my whole life.
7412600	7413600	Anyway.
7413600	7416600	Have you tried not doing that?
7416600	7421600	Anyway, all right, bad joke gone worse. All right, all right.
7421600	7423600	You know I'll go there.
7423600	7428600	I guess that's it. We don't really have a lot of questions in chat, and I'll check the green room one more time.
7428600	7432600	No, I don't see anybody there, so I think we're towards the end of the show.
7432600	7435600	Unless, Loki, I don't know if you had any last minute stories.
7435600	7438600	Nope, nope. It's slow this week.
7438600	7440600	Yeah, it was a little slower this week. Understandable.
7440600	7442600	That Nintendo Direct stole all the thunder.
7442600	7445600	All right, let's get to final thoughts and all that good stuff.
7445600	7449600	Hey, I want to thank you guys for listening to our show this week,
7449600	7453600	whether it was on the podcast feed where nobody told me that last week's show was misnumbered.
7453600	7454600	That's all right.
7454600	7458600	Or whether it was live here on Twitch, appreciate that.
7458600	7462600	All those of you that listen live and listen to us on podcast feed, we appreciate it.
7462600	7467600	We don't ask for your money, but thank you for those that do the bits and the subscriptions and all that
7467600	7471600	and shop in the store and all that. You don't have to, but you do. Thank you very much.
7471600	7476600	The one thing we would ask for this content, if you wouldn't mind helping us spread the word,
7476600	7480600	just tell a friend or two, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice
7480600	7483600	and we want to bring more gamers here to hear their voices.
7483600	7487600	So tell a friend or two about the show, social media awareness goes a long way,
7487600	7489600	tweet about an episode or what have you.
7489600	7496600	Get people to the link that gets it on their devices, that link to Spotify, Apple Music slash iTunes,
7496600	7500600	wherever it is that you listen to this podcast, share those links. That really helps.
7500600	7504600	It used to be that a host on Twitch would go a long way.
7504600	7508600	Twitch changed some things and I don't understand why, but I'll still ask for them
7508600	7511600	because I don't see how auto hosts are a bad thing.
7511600	7513600	It just doesn't do as much as it used to do, unfortunately.
7513600	7517600	But that would be, of course, for our Twitch channel at VOG Network.
7517600	7521600	And we already shouted out the store, so I won't shout that out again.
7521600	7527600	I think that's really it. One more shout out for Dark Soccer Subathon tomorrow, which is...
7527600	7529600	7 o'clock p.m. Pacific time.
7529600	7533600	It's going to be a long night, but it could also be an early morning for you East Coasters.
7533600	7536600	It could be a long morning as well because I'm stubborn as fuck.
7536600	7540600	Alright, check that out. Are you still streaming tonight after the show?
7540600	7544600	Yeah, I am. I'm actually already trying to get my OBS ready.
7544600	7549600	Okay, awesome. Then I think that was it. We'll be back in seven days, of course,
7549600	7552600	to do more show and talk about everything that comes out.
7552600	7555600	It's going to be October next week. Can you believe that?
7555600	7557600	Where does the time go?
7557600	7560600	Alright, let's get to final thoughts.
7560600	7561600	In the toilet.
7561600	7564600	Dark Sakura, how about your final thought?
7564600	7569600	Support me tomorrow. Hang out with me. I'm doing a big thing.
7569600	7575600	I'm really nervous about it. And someone bring me pizza and coffee.
7575600	7578600	If pizza places are open at those hours, Jamie.
7578600	7579600	At seven?
7579600	7582600	Well, yeah, when it starts, sure.
7582600	7583600	Yeah.
7583600	7588600	Alright. But by seven in the morning when you're done, I guess that's when the coffee comes in.
7588600	7592600	I'm going to be buying cans of coffee after my Cairo appointment tomorrow.
7592600	7598600	And who knows? I mean, I wanted to start it at a decent time, you know,
7598600	7601600	that people could at least be there for the start of it.
7601600	7605600	Yeah. Alright. Well, good luck and have some good matches.
7605600	7609600	Alright. Bye.
7609600	7616600	Alright. If that's it for Dark Sakura's final thought, then I will go to Loki for your final thought.
7616600	7623600	My final thought is I've been looking to secure cases and stuff for my game as well.
7623600	7629600	So just trying to get closer to a physical release.
7629600	7632600	Soon, hopefully it's here.
7632600	7635600	And my final thought, I don't have a lot a lot.
7635600	7640600	Things are in a pretty good place right now. And I just thanks everybody for your support.
7640600	7644600	Thank you for being a friend. Just like the Golden Girls said, I'm going to leave it at that note.
7644600	7649600	Thank you for being a friend. But I'm not going to sing it because I'll get DMCA struck
7649600	7652600	and Twitch is not going to protect me. They're only going to protect themselves.
7652600	7657600	So on that note, thank you for being a friend, everybody. Have a wonderful seven days.
7657600	7662600	Happy gaming. And we'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.
7662600	7666600	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
