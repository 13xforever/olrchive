1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,720
Years after Big Picture, Steam Link, Steam Machines and in advance of the Steam Deck,

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,800
the Steam App gets a big update that updates the look and functionality of download status.

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,480
Big Picture started in Overhaul 9 years ago, 6 years ago Steam VR pushed out a little bit

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,240
further and we're finally getting closer to a full visual refresh of Steam by default.

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,120
And this is just one change in a sea of gaming news, now it's time to welcome back your

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,880
hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki as they bring you two weeks of gaming news

00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,880
starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:46,160
Best of all my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,880
every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:55,560
Orange Lounge Radio live once again back with you after having last week off with episode

11
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:01,480
number 883 of our show for this September the 12th of 2021.

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,400
We are back live to talk about video games, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,800
My name Rob Roberts and I'm joined as always say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

14
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,800
Hello.

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,480
Hi, how are you?

16
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,480
I'm alright.

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
How was your Labor Day?

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,920
How was a week off from OLR?

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:30,800
Well I actually, I did my usual stream just an hour early and by then a certain Cenobite

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,680
had been out in the Dead by Daylight universe.

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,360
Ah yes, Pinhead, yes.

22
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:42,280
Well the Hell Priest, as his official name is.

23
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:52,240
But other than that it was Rosh Hashanah started on Monday and so that is the Jewish New Year

24
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:03,240
so to all my fellow Jews out there, Happy New Year and Yom Kippur starts on Wednesday

25
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,920
evening through Thursday evening and so for anyone observing have an easy fast and may

26
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,680
you be inscribed in the Book of Life.

27
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,360
Alright, let's see I'm trying to think what else to ask you about the time away but I

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,920
guess holidays and things can keep a person busy that's for sure.

29
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,120
And I spent a stupid amount of money on Copic markers.

30
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,360
On what?

31
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
Copic markers.

32
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,640
What are those?

33
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,260
They are probably the best alcohol ink markers that you can buy.

34
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:38,300
They are very expensive and I went looking for deals anywhere that I could find them

35
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,500
so that I could build up my collection of markers and start drawing again.

36
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,500
Oh fun.

37
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,820
Which I've been doing some drawing.

38
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,260
I felt like I saw one of your art things like Dead by Daylight fan art basically.

39
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,180
I need, not really.

40
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,620
I did one piece of fan art.

41
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,340
I did Julie.

42
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,340
Okay yeah that's what I saw.

43
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,340
Like in one of those outfits.

44
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,340
That's what I saw.

45
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,400
But I also did my own little avatar for my channel which I'm really not, I like kind

46
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,820
of rushed it out because I finally redeemed the points to be on Hydro's raft.

47
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,820
Oh cute.

48
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,900
And it's on my own Twitch channel right now.

49
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,300
I have one just like a little piece on it but it's sort of like a combination of like

50
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,220
me I guess with my hair the way it is.

51
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,580
Wearing a pig, wearing the Meg pig mask and a combination outfit that's kind of like one

52
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,140
of the pig outfits and one of the Legion outfits.

53
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,540
Cool.

54
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,740
And that is what I have chosen as my Twitch avatar.

55
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:38,140
You've been having a very artistic year between that and as you know many folks know you've

56
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,940
done a lot of the music that's used here on OLR and on your own streams and such.

57
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,060
So the artiste has come out over this.

58
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,420
It's not like it's a new thing but you know I feel like we're seeing it more in this last

59
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,740
year or so.

60
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,660
And I also am working on the guidebook for DerpyCon right now.

61
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:01,500
So I have many irons in the fire and maybe not enough hammers.

62
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,380
Well speaking of fires and hammers that sounds a lot like Minecraft and I know that is the

63
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,860
jam of the one and only Techmaster Loki.

64
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,420
Yeah that's been the jam.

65
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,740
Don't sound too enthusiastic now.

66
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,740
Ari I skated for four hours today so I'm tired.

67
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:24,020
Oh my gosh well first off let me say happy belated birthday Loki.

68
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,060
Your birthday was yesterday for those that may not know.

69
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,980
So you got to go skating for your birthday or was that just a treat for the kids?

70
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,460
Oh my gosh it's it's everything's always a treat for the kids.

71
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,220
Did you at least get to have a good meal or something for your birthday?

72
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,740
We got Tahoe Joes to go and they were an hour late.

73
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,260
Oh my gosh.

74
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:53,420
There's only one person working the the register it's not really a register I guess but like

75
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:59,420
and then she didn't put the whole order in the system because apparently their web system

76
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,100
doesn't talk to their POS system and so they had to manually put stuff in there.

77
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,100
So it's a POS.

78
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:13,100
Exactly and so it was a mess they were they were slow and stuff and then it was then they're

79
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:20,100
the way they cook their steaks it's like medium or more well there's never like a medium rare

80
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,220
because of the way they I don't know they cook them in an oven or something and this

81
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,480
is certainly on the well side unfortunately so.

82
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,840
Sounds good to me I'm that freak that likes a well done steak.

83
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,960
What's wrong with you?

84
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,200
Where do you want me to start?

85
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,360
So yeah otherwise it was all right yeah that's fine.

86
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,120
All right well happy birthday and I was I was saying this on Twitter but if you want

87
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,920
to show Loki a little love for his birthday follow him on YouTube and while you're at

88
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,680
it follow Dark Soccer and I on Twitch we all it's not our birthdays but it will be at some

89
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,560
point so follow us.

90
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,280
I actually am planning on doing a sub-a-thon.

91
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,040
Oh that'll be fun.

92
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,860
Yeah I actually got a little bit inspired by a couple other friends doing their their

93
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:13,040
sub-a-thons and I especially like what Maru did with his.

94
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,240
I don't know who that is but I assume a good person yeah.

95
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,840
Yeah which honestly enough I'm actually friends on Dead by Daylight with Anjaina now.

96
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,880
Oh yeah because some of those drag queens from Drag Race do yeah I mean especially during

97
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,580
COVID when performances weren't as you know prevalent so well yeah but Anjaina is a total

98
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:40,880
sweetheart so actually it's because of them that I might play survivor oh good finally

99
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,640
yay I'm excited to see how that goes maybe I was like are you considering doing cosplay

100
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:53,720
because shout out to our mutual buddy Isaaco was doing a Resident Evil Village Lady Dimitrescu

101
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,900
cosplay it was so fabulous I don't know if he's still going he's no he's still going

102
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,260
he's only about halfway through the game oh gosh and he's been saying Isaaco is not streaming

103
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:07,420
today it's all Lady D not that I encourage people to switch the channel but you can open

104
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,400
up a new tab and take a look because I thought it was definitely definitely lurk in Isaaco's

105
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,020
channel Isaaco is a sweetheart I think we should give a shout out I mean honestly though

106
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:23,160
it's it's abs and Isaaco pops into my channel sometimes just another sweetheart and and

107
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:29,460
of course his roommate Nick and Prince yeah so lots of great people we've been finding

108
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,460
on Twitch through this silly little game that's for sure absolutely absolutely but um but

109
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:40,840
at any rate I kind of am getting a little bit inspired and I want to do something I

110
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:47,840
guess to give back to people who've been with me you know helping my my channel go

111
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,480
you know and so I kind of want to do something entertaining for people um it'll probably

112
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:59,160
be on a day that I can actually legit do a marathon so stay tuned all right uh meanwhile

113
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,640
um oh I should I should mention um uh since everybody asked uh I'm back from Dragon Con

114
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:12,720
I was no what I was at uh Dragon why are you still in Atlanta uh it was uh Dragon Con

115
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,080
was interesting this year you know um obviously it was COVID and you know a lot of people

116
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,920
had concerns about that people didn't want to go because they didn't feel safe which

117
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,000
is fine everybody has to make their own decisions um it was a little bit surreal um because

118
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,760
and this is a good thing everybody was masked and people were incorporating into their cosplays

119
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,240
and things like that which was super cute um but you know again you know for being in

120
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,540
the middle of Georgia which you know might have a reputation in the south one way or

121
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:42,220
the other about mask usage or mask compliance the good news is that Dragon Con was very

122
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:47,720
good in that department um I did test for COVID after I got back um a couple days after

123
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,480
the con to try to give it enough time I was negative so I was very thankful about that

124
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,600
um and um yeah it's uh even though it was a weird year like just for my own like mental

125
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,240
health getting to see people interact with people be extroverted and do the panels again

126
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,840
which were well received and thank you to anybody that showed up actually I will share

127
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,420
this with you guys and shout out and I'm so sorry I forgot your name in the moment but

128
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,240
somebody came to one of the panels on the digital media track that I was doing and he

129
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,680
actually came up after the panel and was like hey I just wanted to say hi I've been listening

130
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,640
to you guys I first found you guys in middle school and I'm thinking this guy's like gotta

131
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,280
be in his late 20s you know it was an age check he said I found you guys in middle school

132
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:35,200
and just I recently rediscovered you guys and I just wanted to say thank you so so passing

133
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,440
it he's and it was funny because we had talked about on this panel that there are a lot of

134
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,400
people who will lurk and they don't necessarily interact with the show and that's fine we

135
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,000
volume them them too and he kind of admitted I'm one of those people I'm I never have sent

136
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,580
an email or joined live or anything like that but I listen almost every week and I really

137
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,400
appreciate what you guys are doing and that you've kept the show going through COVID and

138
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:01,920
all that so I was that was a that was a big hug and and the the fuel I need to keep going

139
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,400
for another 20 years you know so it was good it's good so I thought I'd share that with

140
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,200
you guys that there is there's there's love for OLR out there for sure not just live here

141
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,400
on Sunday nights in our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at the

142
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,320
voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network vog network six o'clock pacific nine

143
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,520
o'clock eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show and Mike Deft is in chat poking

144
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,180
fun at something I put on twitch this week saying excuse me not twitch twitter saying

145
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:36,940
Rob isn't in Atlanta isn't he replacing Bobby okay so I went to Dragon Con but I stayed

146
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:42,680
an extra night after Dragon Con because the airport is less fucky on a Tuesday than it

147
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:48,860
is on Labor Day so I stayed at you know Manor Black Wolf for an extra night and of course

148
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,260
I had to go see his studio in his setup I'd seen it before but I guess the computer isn't

149
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,020
usually there anything so long story short I took a picture in Bobby Black Wolf setup

150
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,620
so it looked like I was now hosting the Bobby Black Wolf show and I made a very tongue-in-cheek

151
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,420
tweet that said Bobby has been replaced on the show you know something like that that

152
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,980
wasn't meant to be taken seriously but you guys want to hear a hilarious punchline his

153
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,780
mom texted him like three hours later going I just read on Twitter that you're leaving

154
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:24,620
your show what happened I felt so bad I wasn't I was trying to punk people like SSJ 100 Matt

155
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,620
and Mike Deft and Tiger Claw, Dark Tetsuya, all the loyals that have been here for so

156
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,520
long all of you I was trying to punk that crowd I wasn't trying to punk Bobby's mom

157
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:38,360
sorry sorry Mrs. Black Wolf sorry sorry anyway but uh yeah so Dragon Con was great thank

158
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,480
you if anybody has discovered the show because of some of my appearances there what have

159
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,520
you I had a great time and I'm I'm really hoping to be back next year let's let's hope

160
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:52,240
things go on a positive trend when it comes to COVID and we can welcome more people back

161
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,120
to Dragon Con next year fingers and toes crossed let's get into our kickoff topic though let's

162
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,120
get into some games and something a lot of people have been talking about from this week

163
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:08,240
some big news Loki if I feel like we kind of got the PlayStation E3 event this week

164
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,520
pretty much yeah it's a little bit late but that I mean COVID COVID fucked everything

165
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,960
up so what is time anymore so this was the PlayStation's showcase where they showed off

166
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:24,040
a bunch of new trailers for a bunch of brand new games lots and lots of stuff to go over

167
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:29,560
so starting off we have of course they announced the Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic

168
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:35,080
remake that is coming to PlayStation 5 isn't that ironic when the first one was an Xbox

169
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:41,000
exclusive on consoles it is but yeah I mean they gotta have something so you know yeah

170
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,300
so that's the thing that's coming we've got spider-man 2 announced which looks pretty

171
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,800
awesome because that kind of mixes Miles Morales in there as well and then they also hinted

172
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,020
that venom is gonna be in there I would like to commend Sony and insomniac for not making

173
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:06,060
the easy play on to spider-man's on spider-man to spider-man's you know spider-man I I'm

174
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:11,740
just I don't think yeah no I'm thankful they didn't along with insomniac working on that

175
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:17,140
game as well we have a brand new game that they announced which is for Wolverine so that

176
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:25,500
yeah as well that you want yep we got a video for God of War Ragnarok so that looked pretty

177
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:34,140
sweet as well this game called project Eve which is kind of like almost reminded me a

178
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:45,460
little bit of like Nier automata or diet Bayonetta was the vibe I got yeah yeah so that's the

179
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:51,060
thing that's coming to PlayStation 5 as well we had a new trailer for tiny tiny Tina's

180
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:56,460
wonderlands which now has guns so it's even more border lands ish but it's still different

181
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:01,420
that looks interesting as a show 100 Matt and chat says I'm really hyped for that tiny Tina

182
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:07,100
thing gonna be the hex and for Borderlands you know I gotta say same and I was interested in

183
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,580
it from the first little tease they did it was the game awards or something a while back they

184
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:16,220
did that first tease and I was like you know I don't super get into Borderlands I don't dislike

185
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:21,220
it I've played a little bit of one and two but I'm really curious about this one I think the

186
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:27,020
setting is so much more interesting to me so I got to check it out we haven't the announcement

187
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:33,820
that the uncharted legacy of these collection is coming to PC as well as PlayStation 5 which I

188
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:39,660
think was kind of hinted at before we got a trailer for game called four spoken which was

189
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:45,100
kind of that project it was like yeah it was the game that they were kind of shown like the tech

190
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:51,020
demo stuff for PlayStation 5 with so that was way different now though but like in a good way like

191
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:56,060
it really like you can see the progress made and I get that that is definitely something that's on

192
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,060
my radar that game looked incredible have you seen anything with that dark soccer that project

193
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:05,060
athea nope or I'm sorry now it's called four spoken I can't want to call its all name look

194
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,020
it up when you can it looks really awesome take a look at the trailer it's cool okay I have like

195
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:20,740
limited PlayStation 5 exclusive with that as well the Alan Wake remaster yeah I hope that the baby

196
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:27,620
thing is less annoying I sadly I think the baby thing is still there but they they do have the

197
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,300
licensed music is all coming back and that made me so happy the only thing that's not coming back

198
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:38,740
is the awkward sponsorships from like energizer and Verizon that stuff's not in there now do you

199
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:45,380
know when when Dan was playing through that the whole baby thing I would just leave the house yeah

200
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:52,220
I could not stand it sadly they're not gonna change the plot or anything like that well no I

201
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:58,460
just mean that they should do something different or have an option for something different because

202
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:06,260
that sound is just really really terrible well with it coming to PC that's gonna mean mods so

203
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:13,260
where the the remedy games may not deliver modders might so I cuz I bet you're not the only one

204
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,500
annoyed by that so something that's changed what if they want them mod it to be the Nelson laugh

205
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:24,620
let's change it to watch it to was it a Randy Macho Man Savage like they did in Skyrim that's

206
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:34,580
what he's a teen shouting Jason instead yes all these all these great ideas yes ghost wire Tokyo

207
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:40,060
looks crazy so they have a new trailer for that it's been delayed to next year but but it looked

208
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:49,500
good off the wall crazy rockstar games has done the unimaginable they the bold brand-new IP

209
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:57,460
Grand Theft Auto 5 is coming to PlayStation 5 will actually delayed to March 2022 I'm with so

210
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:08,420
many changes to it like so innovative it's so so innovative it's so risky exactly did you see my

211
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:13,420
sassy tweet on that is that I hope that there's a collaboration between Grand Theft Auto 5 and

212
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:21,700
Skyrim in the near future so that they can release those fucking games again you know the thing

213
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:26,420
though like with the five like all like even the stuff that was in the trailer like all they're

214
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,940
like kind of bullet points of like what's different or not they've been in the game

215
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,420
forever like when they're talking about you like instantly switch between characters that's been

216
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:42,660
there since like PlayStation 3 but it's it's instant because it's faster it's more instantly

217
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:48,820
but you can do that now on PC with an instant hot coffee oh wait it's a consider you know so they

218
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:54,500
have that or like explosive action there were explosions and all the other games I don't

219
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,220
don't try to tell me explosions are new to Grand Theft Auto they are new to Grand Theft Auto like

220
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:08,220
more explicit is it explosion error I mean I don't understand and oh and then of course Grand Theft

221
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,980
Auto online not to forget that I mean they certainly won't want to like shove that down

222
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:18,180
your throat or anything so that's coming we had a new trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy which

223
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:27,300
looked okay I'm a thing called a kid Amisgna or was a kid it and oh the Radiohead thing yeah that

224
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:32,660
was interesting that took me back Radiohead yeah there's like a Radiohead heck yeah the album like

225
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:40,300
Kid A they're turning into some digital experience it was very vague oh I'm down I don't even care

226
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:45,980
I'm down I'll check it out I like like Radiohead was a big thing in like college for me like that

227
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:52,180
album the Benz that got me through a lot in college but the Benz okay computer yeah okay

228
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:58,700
and Pablo like the Benz okay computer and Pablo honey were like my rotation yeah this this is

229
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:10,780
definitely made for 40-somethings I feel I'm sorry I feel like it's the Super Nintendo and they just

230
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:18,300
released a Led Zeppelin game like or a no a Pink Floyd game that's yeah that's what I feel actually

231
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:26,100
a little bit more accurate might be sort of like an ELO game it's Zanna do the game sorry Logie

232
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:32,740
all right Grand Theft Auto are not great though Gran Turismo 7 has a release date now coming March

233
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:42,420
4th 2022 yep it's Gran Turismo I mean I'm less excited about that than I am with like Forza

234
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:48,300
Horizon 5 so I'm Blood Hunt got a new trailer that's kind of PlayStation 5 as well there's

235
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:54,180
this game called Chichiya or yeah Chiya I don't know how you pronounce it they look pretty awesome

236
00:19:54,180 --> 00:20:02,860
it's like a kind of a cartoony adventure game and then I guess Rainbow Six is finally jumping

237
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:09,220
well not finally jumping the shark again with Rainbow Six extraction which is basically your

238
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:18,340
fire team going against aliens now so there's aliens in Rainbow Six that's coming out in January

239
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:31,180
all righty um yeah that's pretty much it lots of stuff I mean very packed yeah it was some it was

240
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:37,380
a lot of stuff um I you know nothing that made me go oh I gotta go get a PlayStation 5 today

241
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,940
which by the way I'm gonna do it quick and yeah well yeah I can't and I want to do a quick tangent

242
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,100
real quick because some very important news broke while we were out for two weeks and I need to

243
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,940
update you guys on the situation because it is gonna affect my gaming weeks for some time to

244
00:20:50,940 --> 00:21:01,500
come I don't know if y'all heard but my favorite band of all time is really a new album out after

245
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,700
these songs already yes the first two singles are out and it sounds like the 70s which is funny

246
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,780
because the B side and we're talking about ABBA the B side sounds more like old-school ABBA the

247
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,620
don't let me down sounds more like old-school ABBA than the other one because the other one

248
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:20,260
sounded like grandma singing me a bedtime song but I mean that no but I mean that in the best

249
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:25,140
possible way like I know fucking adorable like I just like I know what you mean so here's the

250
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:30,300
better like the B side better so yeah the B side was great so they're doing this whole thing with

251
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,780
the ABBA thing that they're gonna do like a Vegas style show but in London and they're doing

252
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:40,340
holograms and all this stuff right so it's gonna be hologram ABBA at this thing that's actually in

253
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:46,860
the Olympic Park Park in London what Jamie Loki you guys may not know yet while I was at Dragon

254
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:51,500
Con a friend oh no I posted on Facebook so you probably did see our friend melody bought me

255
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:59,100
tickets to go see the ABBA show on my 44th birthday in London what so Alan and I are gonna go and I

256
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:04,940
talked to Alan about it and we decided we will scale some even though we have some big finance

257
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,980
stuff on the horizon which I haven't really talked about on the show but I will soon I have the thing

258
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:15,700
we thought you know what between some raises at work the fact that we've been saving money

259
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:22,180
pretty well London's gonna happen next year so for any of our listeners overseas I need to hear

260
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:26,100
from people in London because I I'm like trying to look at like where should the hotel be what

261
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:31,060
should I don't fucking know what I'm doing so I would love to hear from our audience over there

262
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:38,340
on any tips but that is so late June next year is when my birthday is June 26th which is funny

263
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:44,260
because that means the 20th anniversary of this program but I'm gonna try to schedule it so it's

264
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:50,340
right before I leave so that way it doesn't interfere with things too much so yeah but anyway

265
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:55,860
I say that because and yes this relates to gaming one of the things I had to say was okay I'm not

266
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:01,820
gonna get a PlayStation 5 this year that'll help roll the money into you know those expensive plane

267
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:07,460
tickets to London so but I'm really excited you know and as much as I joke about it's for ABBA

268
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:13,220
and don't get me wrong it is for ABBA it's it's fucking time for us to go across the Atlantic like

269
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:19,380
neither neither of us have ever done it I'm we've never been on a big trip like that if you could

270
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:24,340
see our other friend Rob I I would love to see our other friend Rob I in fact that's one of the

271
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:29,660
people I hope to hear from but yeah and and folks over there but it's one of those things if COVID

272
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:35,460
has taught us anything it's like we need to just fucking do it so there you go it's gonna happen

273
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:41,460
all right um let's see yeah I'm looking at comments in chat thank you for the positive

274
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:47,140
affirmations there in chat so and SJ 100 Matt no this isn't Rob a baba that's a diff that's

275
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:52,660
an emailer is Rob a baba who I think lives in the Midwest I want to say Ohio but with a giant

276
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:59,020
question mark sorry Rob a baba but this is raw what's what's his online name I know his real

277
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:03,820
last name but I was shouted on it has to do with his last name okay then I'm not gonna say it but

278
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:12,820
there's there's overseas Rob is different yeah okay all right anyway um so I'm sorry where do

279
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,380
we leave off in the PlayStation Showcase before Rob went on an Abba tangent that was very important

280
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:24,820
we got everything oh oop so dark chakra do you see you said you saw some stuff in there that

281
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:29,300
looked cool like the Wolverine thing yeah pretty much the Wolverine thing in the radio head thing

282
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:36,740
yeah yeah there's a lot of good stuff in there I I you know I'll be sad to probably miss

283
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,940
fourspoken when it releases but I look forward to checking it out I'll probably finally get like

284
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,680
after London next year I'll finally get the PlayStation 5 I'd say by next holiday because

285
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,500
if there's any truth to this Final Fantasy thing also happening next summer although I don't really

286
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:58,980
believe it I obviously have to get a PlayStation 5 for next summer so by the way also one of the

287
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:05,300
things I've agreed to wave to make London happen is that the Tron machine I'm gonna forgo if it's

288
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:12,100
above a certain amount which I think it probably will be so we'll see anyway all right enough

289
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,700
about the PlayStation Showcase I hope you all saw some great games and some things to get excited

290
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,820
about let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games we've been playing this week

291
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:30,140
dark soccer we'll start with you how was your gaming week um it was dead by daylight lots of

292
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:40,140
dead by daylight um I also picked up a game hold on let me open my steam I picked up slay the spire

293
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:46,980
oh yeah I see that get one get streamed a lot yeah I was watching Isaac oh play it and it

294
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:53,540
actually looked like a lot of fun and I figured it's time for something new and I've also picked

295
00:25:53,540 --> 00:26:04,820
up a couple of other games on Steam just in the interim I I actually won a $10 steam card in in

296
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:11,340
another in another chat and so I redeemed like some a couple little games so I just I'm trying

297
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,420
to pull up my steam which is now like taking five years to connect so I can remember what

298
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,940
all that holds up I was gonna ask you quickly about your thoughts on pinhead and dead by

299
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:25,460
daylight like do you do you like so killer or you know help I haven't played him yet I haven't

300
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:30,940
played him yet or I guess they're referring to him as the cenobite yeah you know we all know

301
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:41,460
game yeah yeah so at any rate um I haven't played him yet I like him I I have seen him in the PTB

302
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:51,380
and which is the play test build for those who don't know I have also seen him since PTB and

303
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:59,860
here are my thoughts I believe that they've done a lot to balance him from the PTB and in the PTB

304
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:06,620
he was glitchy as fuck I'm just saying he was glitchy I have some fun clips saved from other

305
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:17,740
people's streams like having like like his Maury is great and very faithful to to the films and it

306
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:23,740
actually looks a lot better now and again for those who don't know a killer can get an item

307
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:30,260
and an offering called the memento Maury that they can basically just kill somebody with without

308
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:38,620
sacrificing them so but anyway it's very very faithful but the thing that I do not like is that

309
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:46,180
the the voices are gone because it used to be and there's something about that by the way this is

310
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:53,180
what I heard but in the PTB like it there's a mechanic in there where you solve the lament

311
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:59,260
configuration I don't know if anyone has seen the movie we can just leave it at that yeah yeah

312
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:08,620
but at any rate he goes you know when someone solves the box then he says you've opened the

313
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:16,180
box and I came you know line straight from the movie and there were some other other lines that

314
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:22,580
were there and those got removed because apparently the lines were causing some sort of glitching

315
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:31,100
like I'm wondering if it's maybe because of the code that runs everything that's audio in

316
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,420
Dead by Daylight is because of their spaghetti code that has been more and more postified over

317
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:43,780
the last five years of the game's existence it's it's absolutely yeah but in any rate there are

318
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:51,540
they released also the cosmetics for him with the live build and from what I understand by the way

319
00:28:51,540 --> 00:29:05,340
playing him is sort of like a combination of playing nurse and and hag kinda at least that

320
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:13,700
was my impression because you can use like a I know and twins nurse and twins which I suck at

321
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:24,060
and I hate twins because you can actually use the box to cast a chain that you follow like it's its

322
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:34,780
own its own player right so yeah at any rate so going back to it there's been a few a few little

323
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:45,500
glitchy things but the mechanics seem to be a lot better ironed out and then Gideon the game level

324
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:56,380
the Gideon's meat plant from saw and dead dog saloon and RuPaul's drag department or sorry

325
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:03,860
RuPaul's police station Raccoon Police Department have all been taken down but now Gideon's is back

326
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:09,420
up with I think they had a graphic overhaul on it I didn't really notice much at the time either

327
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:15,820
but they do have the new pallets the new graphics for the pallets and whatnot in in the game is

328
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:22,300
pretty good but dead dog is still down and I think dead dog is also going through a graphic overhaul

329
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:29,100
and actually no I know what was going on with dead dog okay and this is hilarious far down the dead

330
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,860
by daylight rabbit hole because not everybody plays it so quickly okay well I've only got two

331
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:38,260
things yeah so what would happen okay there's a move where a survivor can come out of a locker

332
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:46,980
and knock a killer back and it's called head-on what was happening is that when head-on hit a

333
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:56,780
killer in the dead dog level it would shoot them outside of the map like out of bounds hmm like

334
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:08,420
cartoon style it's hilarious so yeah so that went down well I mean not for the survivors I guess

335
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:17,580
but and then RPD had an exploit in it where there's a place that survivors could clip and

336
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:23,020
make it out of bounds and then run to a certain area and automatically escape the level oh yikes

337
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:30,460
um yeah and so RPD was taken down to have that fixed and so that is the state of dead by daylight

338
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:35,260
maybe I should just make that a report the state of definitely did you did you find those games on

339
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:41,820
steam you were referring to earlier no I didn't that's right but um but I do know that I did pick

340
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:48,580
up slay the spire and I'm gonna give it a go see I'm still playing through Oh Fantasian I'm still

341
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:54,660
playing through Fantasian oh and I finished my yeah I finished my grindy bit and I'm going to

342
00:31:54,660 --> 00:32:03,820
be moving on to doing the next quest so on Tuesdays 630 I will be playing Fantasian nice and I like to

343
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:09,420
say it in the mean girls way on Tuesday we play Fantasian all right let's go to Loki and your

344
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:17,620
gaming week it's been minecraft been playing lots of Minecraft did lots of big projects in the game

345
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:25,300
working on filming for that that content and then um yeah she'll be putting out something

346
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:33,140
soon for that because yeah I built a huge drowned farm which was a challenge and then

347
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:40,420
they have some other farms in a shop it's like I'm running tons of shops on the server now because

348
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:46,100
people keep abandoning their stores in fact we just added like a brand new discord channel

349
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:52,100
where it's all these shops that are being sold because people just not coming back

350
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:59,540
that's fun um and then of course uh yesterday I took a break from playing Minecraft to

351
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:07,620
do a little bit of game dev so I finally after progressing for months um finished my update to

352
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:14,580
pixel poops number two that I wanted to do so that's revision b which is out now um on uh itch

353
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:20,100
io and it should be out on steam pretty soon it adds 10 new levels there's two new playable

354
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:25,700
character models and a less punishing continue system so no longer will you have to restart the

355
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,020
whole world when you die in the level you'll actually be able to restart the level you died on

356
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:36,740
so um hopefully it'll make it a little bit easier but yeah so that that's out free hooray you already

357
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:41,940
bought it or it's you know available now and that's probably gonna be the version that gets

00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,900
put on the cartridges at some point all right shout out for pixel poop number two on itch io

359
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:52,580
uh and steam nice yep congrats all right uh my gaming week I had to take notes I've played so

360
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:57,380
much this week I'll try to keep it brief though I'll do my best yeah I played a crap ton of stuff

361
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:02,260
this week so I got to try a playstation 5 for the first time um while I was staying at manor

362
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:06,980
blackwolf uh he has that very nice setup in his basement um and so I finally got to try a

363
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:12,820
playstation 5 for the first time uh and I got to do the astro bot that as astro's playroom I'm

364
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,940
sorry I forgot the name of the game in the moment I'm sure somebody in chat will shout it out

365
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:20,580
um but um I got he wanted to like show me like the controller and how that whole thing kind of

366
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:25,940
worked and it is neat I was playing this one level where you kind of had to like like climb up uh

367
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:30,340
and those that have played the game like climb up a rock wall and it's got a neat little mechanic to

368
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:35,780
it um uh yeah and sj100 matt and chad says astro's playroom is a really cool tech demo yeah it is

369
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,700
that was a cute little fun game to play and it really showed off how that controller is great

370
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,660
and then of course the other game I wanted to play on his playstation 5 I was like show me

371
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:47,060
no man's sky because I played that game way too much and I wanted to see how the rumble

372
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,820
fit into that as well and it was it was neat I see why people are really into the controller

373
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:55,780
like I don't I don't think I'm like oh my god I'm missing everything by having an xbox instead

374
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:01,300
but I I get it it's cute tech uh and uh when I finally get around to getting a playstation 5

375
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:06,820
uh I'll I'll appreciate that tech as well um so that was that was time in black wolf theater

376
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:12,340
playing those games uh when I got home speaking of no man's sky expedition 3 and no man's sky

377
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:17,140
started so I've been streaming a little bit of that I streamed some on uh was it thursday and

378
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:21,540
friday yeah because I was a little bit sick yesterday uh so I didn't really stream yesterday

379
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:26,340
and then uh I didn't stream today because I've just I've run out of time um so uh but I will

380
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:30,740
stream again tomorrow I've been starting expedition 3 and by the way for those that were watching the

381
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,340
stream we were talking about does it end monday or tuesday and folks are telling me it goes

382
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:41,940
through tuesday it does but it's tuesday at 6 a.m pacific 9 a.m eastern so there monday tomorrow

383
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:48,580
night will be the last um chance to get twitch drops uh that are happening um as well so um

384
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:55,140
yeah the no man's sky expedition has been going very well it's weird because now you play it all

385
00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:02,580
on one planet um and you uh don't uh get to really leave that planet it's all part of uh

386
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:06,260
what the expedition is about and it's not a very kind planet either but you start with some

387
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:10,500
protection so it's interesting it's it shows some different elements of the game and refreshes

388
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:16,420
things it is also interesting that the expedition has nothing to do with the frontiers patch they

389
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:22,180
put out I was full on expecting there to be like the whole like uh you know society thing that they

390
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,660
started building in the towns and stuff that's not in it which i thought was interesting um so

391
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:32,660
i'll have to uh explore that elsewhere um bobby is uh mentioning in chat some additional things

392
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:38,660
that i checked out at his house yes there was the eufy dlc for final fantasy 7 i got to play maybe

393
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:45,780
the first i don't know hour or so that dlc um so that was cool to experience um it's it was done

394
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:50,180
very well it was it was hard for me to reacclimate to final fantasy 7 because i haven't i haven't

395
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:54,820
played the remake in a year um but it felt very good on playstation 5 and it looked very good

396
00:36:54,820 --> 00:37:01,540
um so um you know i'll pick that up as soon as i get a ps5 um for sure um but i didn't i didn't

397
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:05,300
you know we only did like maybe the first little section of it i didn't you know play too far to

398
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:09,620
get to any major story stuff or anything like that how's the voice acting for her it's good

399
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:13,940
yeah it's continuous the game's had a strong voice cast and i'd say that continues for her

400
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,100
uh and then bobby does mention this yes i guess i should i should mention that i didn't have it

401
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:24,580
written down but i should mention uh he has that mandalorian table i played it and i did beat one

402
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:30,980
of his high scores now so he's a little bit like he shows up to my house and beats my high score

403
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:38,020
but we need to clarify i didn't beat the high score i beat one of those categories of high

404
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:42,180
scores because it keeps different you beat a mode yeah i beat a mode or something like that i think

405
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:47,060
it was like one of the mini games i got the highest score in a particular mini game so um

406
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:52,580
yeah there was that but um his his arcade and stuff like you know i'll defer to his show for

407
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:57,460
him to tell you all about that stuff but i did get to see him his little arcade room is super cute

408
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,980
like it's all black light it's got the carpet it's got the arcade one-up cabinets and there's

409
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:06,260
definitely room for more in there um cool dark soccer if you ever get out to man or black wolf

410
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,580
i think you'd appreciate his setup and then you'd be like if this was mine i'd have this here this

411
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:17,860
here this here this here but it was nice setup yeah well things things may work out next year um

412
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:25,060
be awesome just saying all right um let's see continuing on my gaming week final fantasy 13

413
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:32,340
hit uh xbox game pass finally on uh xbox uh series x and all that stuff i think it's might be pc as

414
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:38,100
well but i'm i'm only really focused on the console i really wanted to check this out because if you

415
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:44,500
missed it when final fantasy 13 became backwards compatible they actually did some up rezzing from

416
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:50,340
like the masters of um the cutscenes in the game and what i kind of learned from playing through

417
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:57,220
it um the textures look great the characters look great i almost feel like i'm playing an hd

418
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:02,020
remaster of the game now i don't want to get expectations too high because there are some

419
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:07,460
things that still definitely show their age a little bit like the ui but i was really impressed

420
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:12,020
by how good final fantasy 13 looks now and i think that game is really underrated in the

421
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:20,340
final fantasy series and now that i'm playing it again i see so many clues about a big plot twist

422
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:25,620
that comes up way later in the story that really changes the context of one of the characters there

423
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:30,980
are so many hints in the beginning of the game that i that like spell it out and it's one of

424
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:34,980
those you don't know unless you're looking for it and i thought that was very clever uh so anyway

425
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:42,340
i'm having fun with fantasy 13 um i played the warrior where demo i liked it now i know the full

426
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,700
game came out i haven't picked it up yet just because i've been occupied with a bunch of other

427
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:50,260
stuff i will pick it up in this next week i like the demo you didn't like it right loki

428
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:57,220
no i thought it was okay okay i didn't care for it no i bought the game my son beat it already

429
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:01,380
oh wow yeah i remember you saying that your son beat it really quickly yeah like he beat

430
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:07,220
he beat the whole game and like i i bought it on like friday evening and he beat it saturday

431
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:13,060
morning so it's like it's short um bobby blackwolf in chat says i'm the one who didn't care for the

432
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:16,580
demo no i a lot of people didn't care for the demo i felt like i was the only one that like

433
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:23,940
was like oh i like okay i like i i i understand the twist in the game um there's some like neat

434
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,860
modes and stuff that they have where you can lock like a battle mode where you're basically fighting

435
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:33,140
all the different characters almost like smash brothers sort of uh which is kind of neat um

436
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:39,620
i don't know i kind of like the old mario or the warrior games where like it's just like one type

437
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:44,500
of game and you just play the different themes and stuff not necessarily like oh i'll play it

438
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,100
as this character or i'll play it as this character and it plays differently each time

439
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:54,980
it's the i don't know it just gets you have to get used to it i guess but it's fine it's still fun

440
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,900
i will check out the full game this week i've just been that no man's sky thing kind of

441
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:03,380
blindsided me and i've been focused on that uh pretty much a lot of my gaming all right two

442
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:09,140
games left on my list um one of them i'm gonna give a shout out super metroid oh yes i played

443
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:14,580
super Metroid this week because on the flight home fired up my switch went into the super

444
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,420
Nintendo and i'm like what game do i what game could take me about four hours to play

445
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,260
and i played super metro but i only played super Metroid for maybe about an hour and a half

446
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:27,860
and i can't i can't speed run it yet it's been a long time since i played it but um i was having

447
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:34,500
a good time with it memories good times all right oh rob here's the last game on my list and i'm i'm

448
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:41,300
so mad about this but i can't resist these games the last game i've spent way too much time playing

449
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:50,820
this week is cookie clicker because no girl yes cookies girl here's the thing they did this game

450
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:57,700
is like 10 years old right but they just released it on steam and there are there are seriously like

451
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:03,860
300 achievements in it uh and all this other stuff and it's just you know you pay it's in it it's

452
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:07,460
silly because you're paying five dollars for what is free but it's also nice to support the

453
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:12,420
developers and they put a soundtrack for the Minecraft guy so it is a little weird to hear

454
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:17,140
like a Minecraft song because it's it's straight up a song out of Minecraft it's weird to hear that

455
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:22,420
while you're playing cookie clicker but it's not it's certainly not bad um and uh yeah and i've

456
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:28,900
i've been obsessed it's like if you look at the vog network discord it's gonna show on the right

457
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:33,060
hand side rob roberts is playing cookie clicker right now because yes it's idling on the other

458
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:38,660
computer in the other room right now so i can have more cookies when i get back so i can cast

459
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:46,100
my spells to generate more cookies on my way to uh having an empire of uh grandmas and all the

460
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:51,060
things that go into cookie clicker um if you don't know this game um that's probably a good

461
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:56,180
thing i'm not going to tell you anything about it so you can stay the hell away no uh it's it's an

462
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:01,700
idle clicker game that y'all probably remember the idle clicker it is the well one of two i would say

463
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:07,380
the other one was the one i talked about like six or seven years ago when it was on playstation 4

464
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:12,100
clicker heroes was the other one i was obsessed with for a long time yeah so i would say those

465
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:18,020
two are like the idle clicker games and there's there i'm sure every discord will light up this

466
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:22,980
week with other people mentioning idle clicker games they like it's a genre of games the idle

467
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:29,780
clicker game um and uh yeah the cookie clicker is like the classic and it's available on steam now

468
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:36,340
so shout out to them getting it out on steam and uh a whole nother stupid game for me to get into

469
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:40,420
but i'm having fun all right sorry i know i took up way too much time but that was my list i had

470
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:45,380
a lot on my list all right let's get to some other gaming news quickly though quickly um

476
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:21,620
would be i would be remiss not to uh mention that subs are a little cheaper right now in those

477
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:26,500
circumstances uh if you do subscribe uh here at vog network which you're not required to do

478
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:31,140

but if you want to see the video on demand the vods that is something kind of new as of a couple

480
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:41,300
of years ago that is behind the paywall uh as well as some bonus videos uh for example if you

481
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:47,540
want to see us reacting to episode one we're on episode 883 tonight if you want to see dark soccer

485
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,540
enough of that let's get into gaming news loki we'll start with you tonight

486
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:16,260
ah yes um along with the whole announcement of all these wonderful games coming to the

487
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:21,460
playstation 5 and whatnot sony also announced that hey you know that free ride we've been

488
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:25,780
giving you with all those playstation 4 to playstation 5 upgrades well it ain't free

489
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:31,540
anymore we're gonna charge you ten dollars for it which is dumb it really is dumb like

490
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:37,300
especially when you consider that games on the xbox you know you can play them on xbox one you

491
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:44,580
can play them on the xbox series consoles you play them on pc for the same price it makes no sense

492
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:50,260
but that's they want to charge extra money just like was it madden and stuff like that charging

493
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:56,660
for their next gen versions like 79 they want to charge another 10 for those upgrades um

494
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:02,980
um yeah i don't know so basically saying you know i also want to confirm that moving forward today

495
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:08,900
uh playstation first party exclusive cross-gen titles including uh will both digital and physical

496
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:14,660
or offer a ten dollar um digital upgrade option from place digit for the playstation 5 this will

497
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:20,900
apply to the next god of war and grand tourism of 7 any other cross-gen exclusive games uh published

498
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:28,660
by and uh any other cross-gen ps4 playstation 5 titles published by sodi interactive entertainment

499
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:35,300
and it should be noted this came after this whole hubaloo about horizon um not horizon zero dawn

500
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:41,940
horizon god damn it what's the name of the sequel forbidden west took me a minute and that whole

501
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:47,780
hubaloo about uh it was like it didn't were they gonna charge were they not and so they kind of

502
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:51,940
got cornered into having to give away that upgrade and i think that's what made them

503
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:56,660
say this statement is that like horizon is the last free one and from now on it's gonna cost

504
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:01,860
ten dollars for the upgrade um i think you make a damn good point about the fact that microsoft

505
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:07,860
you know very obviously doesn't really have the same stance on things um i kind of think sony

506
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:13,380
can leverage their position here a little bit and they're resting on the strength of a game like god

507
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:18,180
of war and so on that people will pay that ten dollars here's the problem though like yeah and

508
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:23,860
i get that like that they're charging now i are these games also like seventy dollar retail games

509
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:30,580
are they charging 69.99 for these as well my assumption is on ps5 yes but on ps4 no it's like

510
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:37,220
that's where the difference is there's like games and it's their choice to do that i think it's a

511
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:42,580
poor choice but like there's games like for example madden nfl that just got released with

512
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:48,900
you know the next gen prices as well and you ain't getting a next gen game it's like it's very

513
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:53,060
corners cut and stuff like that but it's these people thinking that well it's our franchise and

514
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:57,540
we we feel that you should pay seventy dollars for this game even though it's basically the same game

515
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:02,660
as each year it seems it's funny it's it's always these like sports titles you know like the nba

516
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:08,420
series um madden you know all this stuff that they seem to feel like that they should be charging for

517
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:15,460
this extra fee up front um zen monkey you can take that in consideration when you're buying

518
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:20,340
picking your consoles i guess zen monkey 11 in chat says it makes sense to me current gen games

519
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:27,300
are like 70 something bucks i think they need to let ps5 bps5 and let ps4 bps4 um you know and

520
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:32,340
i don't know it's it's hard for me to say i agree with that but at the same time i think

521
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:36,820
the reality is people are gonna grumble grumble grumble about this but they're gonna pay it

522
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:41,140
like people are not gonna vote with their wallet if they if they do i'll be pleasantly surprised

523
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:46,020
but i think people are just gonna pony up the money because i think the reality is got a war

524
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:51,220
gonna cost 60 bucks on ps4 it's gonna cost 70 bucks on ps5 so they're not gonna give you a

525
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:55,940
free pass if you buy the cheaper ps4 version you gotta pony up the difference and on that level

526
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:02,420
it does make sense you know 4k graphics and textures they ain't free uh and so forth but

527
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:07,860
i do think they are giving microsoft something to needle them at at the end of the day i will

528
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:13,220
say that i think microsoft can needle them on we don't have that price difference however i

529
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:18,500
don't think it's gonna matter because playstation still has got a war playstation still has grand

530
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:23,300
turismo and all the games that are affected by this are only games you can play on playstation

531
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:28,340
they're the playstation studio games so that's it they gotta they gotta lock on it yeah well

532
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:33,460
i mean they can do what they want me if people are willing to pay that price then i guess they

533
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:39,380
can charge that but i think it's it's silly and it does like i said sure it's not really an issue

534
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:44,820
right now because no one can get any consoles um but when it does become more available and

535
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:50,180
stuff and you're comparing you know the cost of the games on those systems granted those

536
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:55,940
exclusives are few and far between that's fine but you know especially when we've got like

537
00:49:55,940 --> 00:50:00,020
microsoft purchasing all these studios there's gonna be a lot of exclusive games coming to their

538
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:06,020
console pretty soon sure it's a drought right now but like you know halo's nothing to really

539
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:12,500
you know balk at i mean you've got lots of big games coming granted yeah it's not got a war

540
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:17,780
but there's that there's their franchises over there as well i mean so and those i'm sure won't

541
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:24,180
be charging 70 per game plus you know you have games pass you could just get all that you know

542
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:29,860
with your subscription so i don't know and i was hearing them like talking about like was

543
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,300
it playstation now and stuff and how they're adding different games to that i'm just like

544
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:39,460
thinking yeah that's not appealing to me uh fifth dream in chat says i'm tired of sony trying to

545
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:44,260
cater to ps4 when ps5 is out too bad you haven't upgraded but that's how games have always worked

546
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:50,260
no one was demanding super nintendo games work on nes i to a point i agree with you there is a

547
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:55,620
point where sony has to leave the playstation 4 behind to really push the games on the ps5 and

548
00:50:55,620 --> 00:51:00,980
the cutting edge tech here's the big problem you still can't really buy a ps5 i know i know you're

549
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:04,980
gonna y'all are gonna needle me on that point because you're gonna say i have a ps5 you had

550
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:10,660
to work to get that playstation 5 i don't think they can truly leave the playstation 4 behind

551
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:16,260
because remember gamers are not just you and me and the audience and the fandoms that would listen

552
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:22,340
to a show like this gamers are the families and the living rooms you know that are more casual

553
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:27,940
and play that type of stuff uh that you know look for these things as holiday gifts until you can

554
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:34,020
walk into target and pull a playstation 5 off the shelf and put it in your cart i'm not sure i

555
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:39,300
totally agree with the you could just upgrade when you want i don't think you can we're still having

556
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:45,940
to fight scalpers and all that stuff will this work itself out in a year i think so but i also

557
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:52,580
thought it would have fixed itself by now like i think if you go back to last year's show we're

558
00:51:52,580 --> 00:52:01,860
sitting there going well by summer 2021 this won't be an issue anymore hmm so i think that's

559
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:07,220
something sony's still got to work out but at the end again i say all that and at the end of the day

560
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:10,740
i sort of go but this ten dollar none of it's gonna matter people are gonna pay it they're

561
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:15,380
gonna be fine and you know they're gonna rabble rabble and they're gonna pay it and that will

562
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:22,820
show sony that they did the right thing i guess so anyway uh just some thoughts on that okay

563
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:28,900
let me move on i want to talk about uh xbox i guess a little bit in the next story which has

564
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:35,140
to do with a controller update this is really funny because this is about the old xbox controller

565
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:40,980
and i instantly thought of when ronma called us i think it was the not the show before we but like

566
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:46,900
the show before that maybe 881 i think he called us and was talking about that he was trying to get

567
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:52,420
an xbox one controller and we were like just get the series x controller dude it's better and he's

568
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:58,900
like no i want a one controller it's what i want and one might say this news this week justifies

569
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:06,420
rama's position because a firmware update to the xbox one controller not the series x but the one

570
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:12,980
controller came out this week uh and it's out for insiders right now uh but it allows the uh

571
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:19,060
xbox one controllers to more easily paired at windows 10 ios 15 and android devices because

572
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:23,540
you know for the cloud stuff they want the um controllers to pair with the mobile devices as

573
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:30,420
well uh also um the xbox one controllers are going to get older controllers that will remember your

574
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:37,060
phone or pc so that you can switch over from a console uh and then there's also input latency

575
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:42,900
similar to what they have on the xbox series x and s is the dli is what they call that is also

576
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:48,260
coming to the xbox one controllers so if you have those controllers still sitting around you might

577
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:54,260
want to check for those upgrades uh as of the the article midweek it's only out for the insiders in

578
00:53:54,260 --> 00:54:00,180
that program um but uh i'm sure this is going to roll out to a wider audience very soon and you

579
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:05,380
might actually be in the insiders program i know i am um so i'll have to update my old controllers

580
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:10,420
because you know why not uh and did your own medicine chat says by the way i got my xbox one

581
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:15,220
controller well there you go now there's a brand new firmware to put on it if you're well will you

582
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:19,860
put the new firmware on it rama i'm curious about that anyway i thought that was that that just made

583
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:24,820
me laugh especially considering that show a couple weeks ago made me laugh uh all right

584
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:33,700
let's move on dark sakura so the the thing that has been the bane of uh many a streamer the hate

585
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:42,580
raids well twitch is finally doing something about it something at least um as as a lot of

586
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:50,500
people know we had a strike on sept on september first um to protest against twitch's lack of

587
00:54:50,500 --> 00:55:02,340
response um and so now uh twitch has filed a lawsuit against two of the people involved in

588
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:11,380
the hate raid um it uh it was uh their their names are only known as creatine overdose and cruise

589
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:18,180
control uh believed to be from uh austria and the netherlands respectively they have suspended and

590
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:25,220
permanently banned their accounts um and they've used alternate accounts to uh to keep going with

591
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:33,860
their hate raids and so now they um have uh been sued basically to prevent anything else from

592
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:39,780
happening and to seek some i guess some reparations about it but um the big thing that i think

593
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:49,940
a lot of us want to see is it's not just these two i mean maybe these two are the big ones behind it

594
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:58,340
but and it's a start it's a start but they need to do something to fix the potential abuse for

595
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:05,940
the system yeah um i i say this news is deserving of one clap thank you uh now let's tackle some of

596
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:11,540
the other issues that broadcasters are asking for um and you know meanwhile this news comes out and

597
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:16,340
you know you think it would shut things down i was followed by eight of those hoes while i was and i

598
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:23,620
call them hose hose the name starts hos so they're hoes so i was reading it as as hoss i know because

599
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:28,260
it's hoss but i yeah but and i realize that's probably not what they want you to call them

600
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:32,660
but you would only call somebody what they want to be called when you respect them because i don't

601
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:35,940
respect them i'm going to call them what i want to call them and they're hoes well it's okay because

602
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:40,180
everybody else has been calling them hoes anyway yeah they're hoes so eight of those hoes followed

603
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:45,460
me while i was broadcasting no man's sky and so i had to go blah blah so it's like the issue is

604
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:51,620
still going on i'm kind of surprised twitch allows you to create a name with hoes in it right now

605
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:56,340
um because they're all but i at the same time if they banned that name they just moved to

606
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:02,900
something else we all know that um well and now like i had one that was like hose something

607
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:09,860
underscore winner and then ha ha ha ha ha yeah and then the moment though that i went to because

608
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:16,660
you know i keep my channel open all the time so i get to see anyone who's followed me while i'm not

609
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:21,060
live just you know just there you know because i also go in and host a lot of other people

610
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:28,020
and i saw both of them there when i went to ban them they had already been deleted yeah so

611
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:34,660
something is happening as which you know again okay clap but it's still it's it's like not enough

612
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:40,340
you know yeah but i i you know what i will say i appreciate that they're taking the legal angle

613
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:45,700
with it and trying to sue the pants off of them and most most importantly out who they are because

614
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:53,460
these individuals when they are named they will get to own that imagery those words that hate

615
00:57:54,020 --> 00:58:00,340
will be tied to those individuals and the other thing even though even if we don't have public

616
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:05,460
spanking anymore these two are going to be publicly spanked by the internet sorry dark soccer

617
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:12,820
well the other thing though that makes me think on the other side um and

618
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:17,300
it's the same thing as i mean i don't want to compare the two but it's sort of like the

619
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:24,820
publicity that a mass shooter gets or a cult leader gets okay i can see that is that it also

620
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:36,260
does lead to copycats we shouldn't be making people famous for doing shitty things okay i

621
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:42,100
okay i i can respect that side of it i mean there is a part of me that thinks

622
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:48,180
that they need there needs to be accountability you know and these two need to own it but i

623
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:53,300
completely understand the whole sometimes these people get turned into martyrs because of that

624
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:57,700
and that yeah that's that that's a valid concern but i i just i feel like there needs to be that

625
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:02,420
accountability too so where do we find that balance between making these people accountable

626
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:07,940
but not making them famous and i think that is where we have to hold the media the reporting

627
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:12,740
and all of that accountable is that when these names are ultimately outed they are only used

628
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:19,860
in a negative context in the media you know and that we instead we say we uplift the marginalized

629
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:25,860
creators that have been so attacked by these raids you know as the good guys and the hoes are

630
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:38,180
the bad guys so it's gonna be a balance i think to do this right yeah i i i definitely don't

631
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:45,860
i would rather in this case that instead of their channel names be listed even though they

632
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:51,700
are perma band that they just straight up give their name if that's gonna happen

633
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:57,540
yeah all right well to be continued i think we'll be reporting on this nearly every week

634
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:02,900
until it's resolved so we'll see all right at least though it is something i i would say i

635
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:10,020
would put this as a two clap okay one clap for the lawsuit one clap for the other thing i already

636
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:15,780
forgot oh the banning the the banning that we're noticing is happening so one one one clap for

637
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:21,620
each all right twitch has earned two claps we should have a clap counter all right anyway

638
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:26,340
uh moving on unfortunately and i don't want to i don't want to laugh because we're about to go

639
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:34,420
into another story that um is here here we go another week of this but it this is a necessary

640
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:38,900
topic especially when we talked about everything that was going on with activision blizzard king

641
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:44,020
a couple weeks ago which by the way i just want to remind everybody the demands of the employees

642
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:51,140
at activision blizzard king have still gone unresponded to but i mentioned when we talked

643
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:59,460
about that that this is a symptom of the industry not just one company and loki i think you have

644
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:05,780
some follow-up to that right yeah it's more companies so uh wargaming the community manager

645
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:12,180
has quit alleging toxic corporate culture so there's been issues with wargaming for a while

646
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:21,540
especially like even how they um treat their kind of uh i don't know why their their partners i

647
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:27,220
guess and they have decided to leave with remember there's a whole thing about um there's one of the

648
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:32,180
ships that was being given away as part of a loot box or something like that instead of being given

649
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:36,180
there's like a direct way to purchase it or something like that and you may remember that

650
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:46,660
there was um a promo code that was sent out or a code that was available that um basically uh

651
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:54,580
translated to you know uh fucking turi which turi i guess is one of the um streamers who was also

652
01:01:55,300 --> 01:02:00,180
um kind of fed up with what was going on so there's like some abuse you know they were

653
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:07,540
basically targeting their partners and stuff um but basically yeah so you know these folks are

654
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:11,460
leaving since i've fortunately been given the opportunities to advance on my own career amazing

655
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:18,660
things um but they have to make the decision because of the recent termination of an employee

656
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:24,420
on my team they believe um to be a kind competent individual for a reason i personally perceive them

657
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:30,100
to be um to be an illegitimate incredibly persistent campaign to unfairly scapegoat him

658
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:39,300
by leadership so there's folks just like i guess dog piling on this employee and you know he blames

659
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:44,660
like toxic corporate culture perpetuating cycles of serious errors stretched back at least four

660
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:52,900
years well before the person's time on the team and as well as um you know his pay grade so

661
01:02:53,860 --> 01:03:01,220
yeah this was uh zachary cabmec doig and um he has like a whole letter here if you want to

662
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:05,940
you know check that out but basically saying yeah if there is just some campaign to target

663
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:12,740
different people um to try to like kind of push them out so that's unfortunate that that happens

664
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:21,540
so that's one company and then uh there's another one uh talking about uh paradox

665
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:28,500
so paradoxed uh which is a swedish publisher there was a survey conducted by the swedish

666
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:36,180
unions that spoke to 133 of the 400 about 400 employees and they alleged that 44 said that

667
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:43,300
they had experienced this form of mistreatment of those surveyed 26 were women where the um

668
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:49,220
statistics were much worse they said 69 of them have experienced abusive treatment as well

669
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:56,420
so this is an international industry problem as well you know this kind of yeah definitely um

670
01:03:56,420 --> 01:04:01,460
points the the finger on it would be understood like wondering if it's just like it's not even

671
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:06,100
like just the gaming industry i think in general like there could be a lot of toxic behavior out

672
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:12,020
there but it is it is the tech industry um yeah you know and gaming is is certainly a part of that

673
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:16,340
you know i i overheard a very interesting conversation alan and i went to dinner the other

674
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:21,300
night at a um a ramen place here that we really enjoy that recently opened up a huge outdoor

675
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:26,660
dining area and it felt great um but the people behind us um there were two girls that were um

676
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:30,580
students at at the local university i could tell they were talking very loud like i wasn't trying

677
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:34,500
to eavesdrop but they were i don't know a few drinks in or something they're talking very loud

678
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,860
and it was very interesting to hear them talk about the tech industry because i think they

679
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:42,580
were both in it or like studying to be in it and they were kind of talking about you know some of

680
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:48,660
the weird things that dudes do in the industry and you know i i you know there's that there's

681
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:53,140
that part of me that kind of wants to be like you know there's some good people too but you know you

682
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:56,820
don't want to not all men that type of conversation and it's just i think you know you get to be a fly

683
01:04:56,820 --> 01:05:05,860
on a wall for a very realistic and um a perspective on things and how creepy some people can be

684
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:14,180
yeah it's unfortunate um and then of course paradox has uh responded to these allegations

685
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:21,780
saying obviously the results of the survey are deeply concerning it's like bog standard uh pr

686
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:27,300
speak there the management team wants to ensure this data is acted upon but um taking immediate

687
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:31,860
direct um action is legally difficult thanks to the informal nature of the survey

688
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:42,180
and yeah fun all right well it's unfortunate that this is continuing but at the same time

689
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:49,380
it has to be kind of like it's been happening so this stuff has to come out it has to be identified

690
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:55,060
if companies are going to put out their canned pr speak okay but it has to be called out so it

691
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:59,940
can be fixed um so again i sadly don't think it's going to end here and they're going to have more

692
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:06,340
of this so we'll see uh meanwhile let's talk about some good news i think with the studio

693
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:13,060
let's talk about um the recent purchase by playstation studios of fire spite

694
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:19,860
excuse me not fire spite fire sprite uh fire sprite is the studio that made playroom uh the

695
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:26,820
playroom vr and the persistence and they are now a part of playstation studios and honestly i think

696
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:30,420
the most surprising part of the story to me was that they weren't already because everything

697
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:36,260
they've developing is pretty much exclusive for playstation but uh who who can forget how

698
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:42,260
important the playroom was to those early days of broadcasting on the playstation 4 that i remember

699
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:48,260
that was a thing yeah that's a thing so it makes it very i'm curious what uh what they're gonna

700
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:55,220
bring to the table uh for playstation in the next experience um but anyhow home hey i'd love that

701
01:06:55,220 --> 01:07:02,020
but we'll see um some developers will go back to sony with this deal but um quite a few develop

702
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:06,420
because quite a few members of fire sprite apparently came from the wipeout developer

703
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:11,460
studio liverpool and then uh sony bought that when they were like psychosis and then they shut

704
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:17,860
them down in 2012 anyway um so yeah sony and fire sprite have been kind of hand in hand uh ever

705
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:24,340
since then uh all of that said is the team is working on something new but we don't know what

706
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:30,980
it is uh we only know that they did the playroom and they had a vita and mobile title run sackboy

707
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:35,140
run i played that i think that's one of the endless runners they do the astro bots games as

708
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:39,620
well where the different studio they did not do the astro bot playstation 5 game which is

709
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:44,580
interesting because that all all that stuff came from the family yeah because playroom like one of

710
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:50,340
the things i liked playing on there the most with like my kids is they had an uh bot game it was

711
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:54,580
like throwing ninja stars as ninja bots or something like that it's like throwing ninja

712
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:59,540
stars on like a runner type of game and that was kind of fun to kind of show you like the motion

713
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:10,580
um controls for the playstation 4 it should be noted though with fire sprite the the playroom

714
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:17,220
and run sackboy run those are the only titles that haven't really been vr related so it's very likely

715
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:22,900
fire sprite is working on something to launch playstation 5's vr headset whenever that happens

716
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:27,540
that makes i would say that's probably what they're working on and so and we don't know if

717
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:33,860
that means another like astro bot playroom related thing hey i i always thought playstation home like

718
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:42,420
the shift to vr would make a lot of sense for that but um yeah so uh and then uh jumping in as well

719
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:49,940
to to save the day and chat bobby blackwolf is in chat saying um astro bot is a soap a soby studios

720
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:56,020
not to be confused with osobo who made flight simulator so there's a little bit of a correction

721
01:08:56,020 --> 01:09:02,500
there from our chat and by the way yes you just saw a new camera angle here on twitch so that when

722
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:08,980
there's chat stuff to shout out we have that available all right uh let's move on with our

723
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:12,340
next story which i think is dark sakras even though she's got delivered dinner i think

724
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:18,820
it is but there's no mayonnaise on it good hey it's my food and i like mayonnaise i get cubie

725
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:25,700
mayonnaise um so um you know a lot of people really enjoyed sonic colors i don't know why

726
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:32,740
but some people liked it and so sonic colors ultimate um uh came out on the switch but um

727
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:38,900
apparently the switch version has a lot of buggy bugs and glitchy glitchies

728
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:47,620
and so a twitch user sorry twitter user named vex contacted nintendo to try to get a refund

729
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:50,580
and they were all like yeah we know about it here's your money back

730
01:09:52,340 --> 01:10:00,820
and so apparently you can now call nintendo and get your refund unless you're enjoying the game

731
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:06,420
or have played a lot of it then don't do that because you got your money's worth right so right

732
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:10,500
but apparently there's a lot of issues with the nintendo version of the game that are not present

733
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:16,180
in the other versions of the game and i don't know if that's part of the tech specifications

734
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:20,340
of the switch or what have you but i guess it's just it's it's having problems i haven't played

735
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:25,300
colors ultimate myself sonic colors ultimate myself so i can't tell you what that's all about

736
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:32,900
but um that's interesting that uh nintendo is offering that it's it's it's the cyberpunk of

737
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:41,780
sonic games clearly i reckon all right uh let's move on loki so this is kind of exciting but

738
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:48,820
apparently there is a working playstation 4 emulator now um that's right playstation 4

739
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:55,540
now it doesn't play a lot of things obviously it's not a full-fledged um you know emulator for

740
01:10:55,540 --> 01:11:02,420
a lot of retail software but you can actually play some of these 2d games in fact i saw um some

741
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:07,780
examples of what was it shovel knight being played on it which it's still kind of got some graphical

742
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:11,700
issues and whatnot but right now what they've been kind of playing on there is a lot of these

743
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:19,460
different 2d games um but there's still you know a lot of different hitches with it like for

744
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:24,740
example there's stuff you have to dump from a playstation board and files that you need to run

745
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:29,700
um in order to be able to do that and then transferring the game as well um you have to do

746
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:35,540
that as to get that to run on pc but it is an exciting start at least to see them being able

747
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:40,980
to play like you know some games on there and it was actually running at like pretty good speeds

748
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:47,620
aside from the graphical glitches i mean it's pretty respectable for where it's at now when

749
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:54,260
we get into 3d and when some of those graphical things are enabled that may you know cause the

750
01:11:54,260 --> 01:12:01,060
games to run a little bit slower but it's still not a bad start so far um and bobby in chat uh

751
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:06,180
by like asked an appropriate question saying so if it doesn't play many things is it really a

752
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:12,260
working emulator um from well it has it plays a hundred it plays lots of indie games so they

753
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:17,780
said that right now the emulator has uh hundreds of indie games that are supported by it so it's

754
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:23,300
basically 2d games that are running on it right now and so uh when okay so i've i've mentioned

755
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:26,980
on the show before that back in the day i was a little more heavily involved with emulator scenes

756
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:31,380
especially when the nintendo emulators and super nintendo emulators really were starting to gain

757
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:36,100
a lot of ground um and usually it's kind of like a checkpoint along the way for a lot of the

758
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:40,740
emulator developers because it's one thing to like have the hardware going and have the hardware kind

759
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:48,580
of like run but it's another to actually then get the game working um for example um many a very

760
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:52,420
popular nes emulator back in the day and i'm going to date myself a little bit here because this

761
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:58,100
isn't the one people use anymore was nesticle was the the big one that uh a lot of folks used right

762
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:02,020
it was nesticle and there was genesis because the developer had a sense of those are the ones

763
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:06,020
although i think i used a different one than genesis because genesis wouldn't play panorama

764
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:12,660
cotton and that that you actually put what it is so nesticle was considered a working emulator

765
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:18,740
but it didn't play every nes game because there were nes games with custom mappers custom chipsets

766
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:24,180
um like and it had a lot one of the the big things back in the day i figured out how to get

767
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:30,740
castlevania 3 running on nesticle um by changing some things in the file specifications

768
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:36,900
and um that that got the vertical scrolling stuff to work that was considered working

769
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:41,620
even though it wasn't 100 perfect so there's kind of a difference between the emulator works

770
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:46,820
and the emulator is 100 now i would say the nes emulators you see nowadays like the things that

771
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:53,220
are playing pixel poops number two and stuff those are 100 emulators basically but i i also get you

772
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:57,780
know i i i don't know if bobby was saying that tongue in cheek or not but i also kind of get it

773
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:05,140
but just coming up from a long time ago a working emulator is basically like when it plays one game

774
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:12,580
it works it emulated a game now it's building it out from there to 100 emulation yeah so and

775
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:18,420
in the emulator because i didn't mention the name it's called spine and they did update some of the

776
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:24,900
game library on the first of september but there's you know still quite a bit that needs to be worked

777
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:30,420
on um there are some games though that are running i like persona 5r is running like i said though

778
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:35,380
lots of graphical issues right now but at least it is booting up to the game and it's able to run it

779
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:39,460
they have a whole like spreadsheet of all the different games and like where they are like

780
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:43,860
whether they'll boot at all where if it gets to like the title screen or in game that type of

781
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:51,140
stuff so it's not perfect obviously but it is progress just think that guy that wrote nesticle

782
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:57,540
probably got to be in his late 40s now probably a family and he's like i'm the guy that wrote

783
01:14:57,540 --> 01:15:05,300
nesticle anyway shout out to that guy hey that guy got us through our college years so shout out

784
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:10,100
and i i hope he's doing well even if nintendo probably wanted to sue the pants off of them

785
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:17,860
back in the day i hope i hope he's having a good day all right moving on let's talk about this

786
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:24,340
next story which has to do with a steam update so steam got an update this week uh which uh has to

787
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:29,380
do with managing downloads and storage uh makes it very easy to move games from one drive to another

788
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:34,340
which i appreciate because i sometimes need to get things off my solid state drive onto the non-solid

789
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:40,100
state drive to get a different game on the ssd uh these changes have been in beta for a while

790
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:45,940
but it just came out for all users uh as a stable release it will now show installation progress on

791
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:52,980
top of download status um and now there's instead of view news there's view news there's patch notes

792
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:58,420
um there's also a storage manager that will show you how much space you have left uh for moving

793
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:05,460
gate sorry guys for moving games around and things of that sort i still want to know why it

794
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:10,740
takes my computer so fucking long to patch a game do you know that dead by daylight pinhead thing

795
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:14,180
and this happens with every dead by daylight patch that comes out it takes my computer like

796
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:19,700
it takes an hour and a half to two hours to download and patch that it's crazy and i don't

797
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:24,100
know does that happen to anybody else when let's hear it for stadia i never have to deal with that

798
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:32,180
yeah but you know i i also don't have that weird frame rate thing that comes in when the cloud gets

799
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:38,580
skippy so i don't have weird frame rate things remember usually when i'm playing i am streaming

800
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:44,100
at the same time yeah um okay so bobby and chat says it happens for some of my games but not

801
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:53,540
others i guess that is that whole uh uh uh sorry i lost my train of thought uh it's that whole um

802
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:58,260
dang it sorry it happens for some of my games not for others is what bobby glacol said it

803
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:02,580
really depends on if the game is packed rather than just flat files is that spaghetti code

804
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:06,980
coming into play again when it comes to dead by daylight that's for sure how about that

805
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:13,860
dj rama s found the guy that did nest he works for ea as a senior software engineer now well good for

806
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:20,980
him congratulations that means he's making money good for him all right and steam update hooray

807
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:25,380
uh bobby says it really depends if the game is packed rather than just flat files well dead by

808
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:30,340
daylight's definitely a packed game all right let's let's go to a simpler time when we didn't

809
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:34,820
have to have a download manager why because everything was on a cartridge or i think in

810
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:41,940
tonight's game case a cd so let's get into no not even a cd something special all right let me uh

811
01:17:41,940 --> 01:18:00,180
let me play the official transition and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where i'll

812
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:06,180
dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game

813
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:13,700
of the week and what did you pick this week dark soccer i picked blue stinger a game i've talked

814
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:19,540
about a whole bunch and have never apparently done so um and happy belated birthday to the

815
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:28,740
dreamcast with this one right seriously yeah the ninth so basically um this particular game came

816
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:34,980
out in 1999 uh for the dreamcast it was developed by climax graphics originally published by sega

817
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:41,060
and then outside in japan and outside of japan it was published by excuse me hiccup activision

818
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:49,300
um the game is entirely 3d you heal yourselves real time with you know food and drinks and

819
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:57,060
in the game um and of course uh you have to buy them from vending machines so you can only get

820
01:18:57,060 --> 01:19:03,140
to heal when it's actually safe to heal um you can buy weapons and ammo the same way out of a

821
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:11,380
vending machine including uh you can get rocket launchers napalm uh triple barreled shotguns you

822
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:19,300
can get a freaking lightsaber that was my favorite weapon um you have two characters you have elliot

823
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:25,060
and you have another guy named dogs who has a crossbow and so there's also like the beat so

824
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:32,740
it sort of combines some shooter elements and some beat them ups so basically uh a long ass

825
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:41,700
time ago a meteorite hits and wiped out all the dinosaurs and then now um this biotech company is

826
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:47,940
uh trying to make things happen i don't want to just say too much because it's been a long time

827
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:56,180
since i've played this game i beat it when it came out um and then um this like creature arrives

828
01:19:56,740 --> 01:20:04,100
that is seals it in this dome of energy and so elliot's trying to solve this mystery

829
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:14,100
um so as far as the game goes there the big thing that's notable about it is that the

830
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:20,820
cinematography in the japanese version was

831
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:31,220
it it basically drew from cinema uh cinematic techniques um

832
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:38,420
and it really added i think to the drama in the game added some tension in certain scenes

833
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:48,740
um but um in the us version it had some pretty terrible dubbing um

834
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:54,420
and this fixed camera system it was a behind the player third-person view

835
01:20:55,380 --> 01:21:03,780
um kind of tomb raider-ish um or almost resident evil-ish but like there's this one scene because

836
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:07,540
i played through both the the us and the japanese version i had the japanese version first

837
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:18,180
um there's this like tower that you're on a spiral going up and the camera would zoom far out

838
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:26,260
and like almost like a drone looking around it you know it was really really cool it was hard

839
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:32,740
as fuck to play you kind of had to pay attention to where you were but then in the us one it's just

840
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:41,060
falling around and it's so fucking boring it's boring as balls but the game itself did not get

841
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:50,820
a lot of great great ratings okay like it maybe was middle of the line it had a 28 out of 40 from

842
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:58,500
famitsu um you know it didn't like the highest rating it got was an 8.4 out of 10 from ign

843
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:09,060
so it's it was pretty average um but it was novel and it was a fun actual little game i

844
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:13,300
i wasn't mad at it i played through the whole thing i thought it was fun i had a great time

845
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:22,340
with it and it is one of the early full 3d survival horror games you know i honestly

846
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:30,020
like to say that blue stinger paved the way for code veronica to come out um i just really

847
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:36,420
thought that the game was a neat little game i thought that it had unique elements to it i

848
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:39,460
laughed my ass off that you would have to buy all your shit through a vending machine

849
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:47,540
that you could buy a rocket launcher in a vending machine go fig so um

850
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:57,620
um yeah i would say that um if you can find the japanese copy of it however you find it

851
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:07,700
give that one a play you can play it in english um it it's not a difficult game by any means i

852
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:14,900
i had an easy time of it i played all the way through it in practically one sitting um actually

853
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:20,420
i take that back it was a couple of sittings but it was it was a nice fun little game and it had

854
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:26,900
a decent story i mean yeah the graphics now are going to be kind of dated it is very early dream

855
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:33,940
cast but it was absolutely a smash to play i had a great time with it so there you go it's blue

856
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:40,900
stinger i'm not sure it definitely kind of um set the stage for like cinematic type of games like

857
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:46,580
you know i see a lot even though yes it's a little bit clunky and old looking i still see

858
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:56,740
like a lot of modern games in this yeah and like even this one little scene here uh now this is

859
01:23:56,740 --> 01:24:04,500
i want to say this one is the japanese version yeah it is um because you can see how in some

860
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:14,500
cases it starts off with these like more cinematic elements um it was it was very

861
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:18,980
novel for what it did that's that's what my thought is it was very novel for what it did

862
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:24,820
it certainly set the stage again for this for this type of play and it was all 3d

863
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:31,620
very true yeah so some comments in chat bobby blackwell says i bought this on launch day at

864
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:36,420
the dreamcast just for the intro movie it really wasn't my kind of game so i never really played it

865
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:43,540
much further and then ssj100 matt in chat says yeah i got the game around uh launch uh as well

866
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:48,820
wasn't a fan at the time but appreciated it later uh i think i ended up trading it i can't believe

867
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:53,620
for nfl blitz so it kind of sounds like you know with uh you know kind of what you guys are saying

868
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:58,500
there it's kind of one of those things where it's like you you you it didn't maybe it wasn't the

869
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:04,900
greatest game but if you only played the us version you missed out but so many things that

870
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:10,820
it did kind of set the stage for later stuff too but there probably will not be any hurry to make

871
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:16,020
a remaster of this game or anything like that if they did that there's a lot of potential in it okay

872
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:21,860
all right your classic game of the week blue stinger all right let's travel around the world

873
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:28,340
quickly and check out some other rapid fire news so loki i'm gonna go to you all right

874
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:37,060
so uh you know me i am a big fan of legos and so there's a brand new set coming out now

875
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:45,700
for super mario 64 and it's actually a giant question block with a bunch of micro builds of

876
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:52,900
the different levels in super mario 64 as well and it all folds down into one neatly uh shaped

877
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:58,820
question block and they've got like peach's castle baba uh battlefield cool cool mountain

878
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:04,420
and lethal lava trouble are the levels that are kind of featured in there so that's pretty awesome

879
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:11,860
it's coming out october 1st for 169.99 at uh lego.com or the lego retail stores

880
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:16,900
not sure if i'll pick this up because i have no room for any more sets unfortunately but

881
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:24,180
i would if i did um and then this is kind of fun so we always hear like you know patches for

882
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:32,660
different games to block cheating but in this case um cookie clicker has been patched to help

883
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:39,380
with cheating so they have a patch now that it was to address some memory leak issues due to

884
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:47,380
some audio stuff uh when using auto clicking and so now they've uh fixed that so now you can use

885
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:53,940
auto clickers with less uh i do not use auto clickers for the record no but i do want to check

886
01:26:53,940 --> 01:26:58,100
out some of the mods that's i should have mentioned that when i was talking about my gaming week

887
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:02,820
is it cookie yeah cookie clicker now embraces mods and that's another big thing of the steam race

888
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:08,660
that's interesting yeah i'm just i'm waiting for titty clicker

889
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:19,380
nothing yet sorry podcast listeners but the look dark soccer just shot me while she's mid sandwich

890
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:29,220
uh bobby blackwolf in chat says ttp clicker yeah i don't yeah anything's possible thanks to mods

891
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:40,340
yeah so check that out i will uh let's move on uh dark sakura uh when you're able to uh

892
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:45,700
chew on that sandwich uh you i think you have a couple things that were i do shout it out in our

893
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:56,420
discord yeah so um one of those is that um platinum games wants to bring star fox zero to the switch

894
01:27:56,420 --> 01:28:04,980
and um starfox zero was on weu it came out in uh 2016 and it was one of platinum's games and they

895
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:12,260
want to bring it back it'd be cool if they did actually actually they're quoted as saying it's

896
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:17,300
not cool that people are aren't able to play older games because they're locked out on the platform

897
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:21,380
and so of course if anything was possible we'd like to bring over any of those older titles to

898
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:35,780
the newer platforms and in other news arcade one up has a uh a tabletop uh a mortal combat

899
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:44,340
and the marvel uh versus capcom table and everything they are now up for pre-order

900
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:50,820
and there was much rejoicing well it's so these games were never on tabletop that's what struck

901
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:55,300
me as interesting about it is that these games yeah cocktail cabinets they're fighting games

902
01:28:55,300 --> 01:29:01,060
somebody's yeah somebody's gonna be screwed on the wrong side i'm trying to look at this picture to

903
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:08,820
see oh look at it the sprit this the screen is split in half oh so one person gets they have a

904
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:15,220
they have a mirror of the screen okay okay i'm pretty sure that they had a street fighter 2

905
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:20,260
cocktail cabinet at one point not street not street fighter this is mortal combat 2 well

906
01:29:21,140 --> 01:29:25,620
and the other one is marvel versus capcom separately i think loki's talking about these

907
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:30,260
are new i think there has been a street fighter one but i think also like in in the real world

908
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:35,860
quote-unquote that game was so fucking popular you can't really understate like what that game

909
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:41,460
did for arcades in 1992 or whatever year it was uh i actually that one i wouldn't be surprised if

910
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:46,500
it had a legitimate cocktail cabinet at one point it was just that big of a game even if it didn't

911
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:56,180
make sense so um sort of on off topic you know those like little tiny arcade cabinets oh yeah

912
01:29:56,180 --> 01:30:01,540
the ones i collect these little arcade classics there's other different types too well you know

913
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:13,220
we were getting some of them um i found at tj maxx of all places a galaga cocktail table size

914
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:21,060
like a full arcade one up machine no no the teeny ones oh but but a cocktail

915
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:29,940
yeah but a cocktail huh it is tiny but of course you know i i had to buy it i mean

916
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:37,460
normally those things was uh uh well i think they were like 20 bucks and this was like of course

917
01:30:37,460 --> 01:30:42,420
because it was tj maxx it was like 10 yeah wow i know yeah i might have to go on a run

918
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:47,700
i didn't think to check stuff like good luck tj maxx but yeah don't go to big lots because they

919
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:53,940
um are uh hate paid oh shit i didn't know that all right but they're very i think of those types of

920
01:30:53,940 --> 01:31:00,420
stores you know they contributed to uh you know who oh all right what were you gonna say logie

921
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:06,100
oh i was gonna say uh we uh this a while back okay we had talked about another company that

922
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:14,020
was bringing arcade games to the you know home uh was ice um so that got me thinking like did

923
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:21,620
they ever put up their page to sell arcade games they have actually so you can the thing is though

924
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:28,660
is i don't see how these are like home versions of arcade games these just look like arcade games

925
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:35,300
so like for example they have jurassic park pro you know that you can bring that game home for

926
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:44,100
ten thousand dollars that's just the arcade game at that point that's not like that's not a that's

927
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:50,100
not a deal that's just arcade game or like you can get a skee ball that's like five thousand dollars

928
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:55,540
it's like that's a skee ball you know like i don't get it but they are selling them now so so

929
01:31:55,540 --> 01:32:02,100
that's a thing but all righty sadly it's a a ten a nine thousand two hundred ninety five dollar thing

930
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:07,780
and not a five hundred dollar thing which is what i was really hoping it was all right let's travel

931
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:13,460
around the world and check out some release dates and some games coming out um pretty soon so logie

932
01:32:13,460 --> 01:32:17,700
we'll start with you in the us thank god death loop is finally coming out so i don't see any

933
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:23,220
more stupid trailers for it but that's coming out on playstation uh five and pc and the speaking of

934
01:32:23,220 --> 01:32:27,380
a stupid trailer we did get another one of those during the playstation event because god forbid

935
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:32,420
they they have to you know shout that game out since it's the only Bethesda game they're getting

936
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:37,060
i i i'm actually gonna agree with Loki on this they're they're they're setting that up for

937
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:42,100
disaster by show it's like i get the no man's sky vibe from that sorry which is funny because i love

938
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:47,220
no man's sky now but we all know that when it released it did not like really buy into all

939
01:32:47,220 --> 01:32:53,780
that hype because they hyped it over and over and over again and i feel death loop isn't a death loop

940
01:32:53,780 --> 01:33:00,900
pun intended yeah it it was annoying so but it is coming out though so look for that this week

963
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:41,140
network dot com slash discord uh and uh in the green room is where we'll uh field for calls but

964
01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:44,340
we do have a little bit of time still it's probably gonna be a few minutes before we get there we have

965
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:49,540
some more stories uh including uh this one from loki about some international news right

966
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:56,820
yeah so there was some news while we were out about chinese the chinese government cracking down

967
01:35:56,820 --> 01:36:03,940
on uh basically gameplay relegating children to only allow them to play like i think it was like

968
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:12,420
two or three hours a week during specific times and or under the age of 18 yeah and so because

969
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:20,980
of that um locked or the kind of crackdown there is uh several lots of money being lost

970
01:36:20,980 --> 01:36:28,260
from uh chinese companies so uh 60 billion dollars in losses from net ease and ten cent

971
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:32,980
uh because of their stocks and the sell-offs that they had to do during that time because of this

972
01:36:32,980 --> 01:36:41,620
announcement um that's a lot of money that they lost but yeah so um along with that though of

973
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:48,980
course um there's new restrictions in place where basically because you know china is really um

974
01:36:48,980 --> 01:36:54,100
controlling for all of you know their gaming and everything so you have to put like in some id

975
01:36:54,100 --> 01:37:02,500
number or something into the system when you play and um but you know people are gonna circumvent it

976
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:07,700
so what are people doing well kids are taking their parents ids and putting them into the system

977
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:12,260
along with their names and playing games under their parents profile instead so they can get

978
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:18,340
around the two-hour limit that they have because like no one would have figured this out i guess

979
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:28,100
but yeah um it's interesting apparently though the ten cents also rolling out a time-sensitive

980
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:34,500
facial recognition system for some games uh they're calling it midnight patrol aims to

981
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:43,700
prevent um kids posing as grown-ups by scanning their face between i guess the hours of 10 p.m

982
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:50,340
and 8 a.m i mean they don't live in china i know i was gonna say i get how they probably get away

983
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:55,860
with that on smartphones but how do they do that on desktops i guess i guess there's a picture of

984
01:37:55,860 --> 01:38:00,580
maybe put a picture of their their parent like next to a webcam or something like that and then

985
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:06,820
just point the webcam somewhere else there's get away with everything it's just really unfortunate

986
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:10,980
like i understand that you know the gaming addiction problem is real and it's real here

987
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:15,460
it's not just real um overseas but sometimes some of the the culture with the the cafes and stuff

988
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:22,660
really exacerbate that whole thing um but i i just don't understand like why do they regulate how

989
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:27,700
many how long you can watch a movie do they regulate how long you can read a book do they

990
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:32,980
really what kind of movies tv shows i mean yeah they do they do really the kind of movies but

991
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:36,580
they don't really regulate the length they also they've been regulating the kind of games for a

992
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:42,020
long time you know uh most popular story that comes to my mind is world of warcraft had to

993
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:46,660
kind of get rid of the undead in order to release um because that is very frowned on and that

994
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:52,180
culture is like the the i guess animation of like bodies or things like that so they had to

995
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:56,100
really change it they're called the forsaken and they're just they're different they're not so um

996
01:38:56,180 --> 01:39:02,420
you know uh uh zombie like i guess so um but they're of the unliving yes

997
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:09,700
uh s2100 matt suggests as another way to get around the uh scanning print out your parents

998
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:16,660
face and wear it as a mask there you go or just say you know dad come here can you look at the

999
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:24,340
camera all right anyway gonna have a staring contest with this camera for a good i don't know

1000
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:32,020
eight hours well i play some world of warcraft all right uh let's talk further about legal uh

1001
01:39:32,020 --> 01:39:38,820
issues and uh this has to do with a kickstarter there was a hand-drawn nintendo entertainment

1002
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:42,740
system game i already know what happened here yeah yeah right i don't even need to finish

1003
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:51,620
well actually you know what's interesting they're not naming the company that sent the lawyer and i

1004
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:57,220
wonder if that's for legal reasons everybody is assuming um because it's interesting because

1005
01:39:57,220 --> 01:40:02,580
even um you know i'm i'm looking at a source here from kotaku that got corrected after the fact

1006
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:09,140
saying a previous version of this story jumped to conclusions regarding the parties involved in the

1007
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:14,260
shutdown i found that very interesting because that means somebody contacted kotaku telling him

1008
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:20,420
to change it out of possible legal concerns there so this is a very interesting legal game of chess

1009
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:27,940
that's going on anyway what happened uh it was a hand-drawn game guides kickstarter uh by creator

1010
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:34,420
phillips summers uh and he knew it was a risk to do um but uh the kickstarter happened the

1011
01:40:34,420 --> 01:40:39,780
kickstarter got uh well funded over three hundred thousand dollars but then had to be cancelled

1012
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:45,860
again they did not name outright what happened but in an update on kickstarter uh the creator

1013
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:51,140
phillips summer said i was basically he was contacted by a lawyer and so from there he made

1014
01:40:51,140 --> 01:40:56,580
that decision to pull the project and i i totally got his reasoning because if the kickstarter had

1015
01:40:56,580 --> 01:41:02,660
gone through and that money got pulled from everybody's bank account he'd be legally obligated

1016
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:06,580
through kickstarter to come through with the backer rewards and this is kind of what he went

1017
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:13,300
through in his is a message uh and so he didn't want to find himself in that position so he pulled

1018
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:19,460
the plug before the kickstarter finished basically um everybody is jumping to conclusions about who

1019
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:28,020
that lawyer was and who they were representing um but i also think um i think nintendo quite frankly

1020
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:34,980
whether it was or wasn't them um nintendo has earned that reputation of everyone jumping to

1021
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:41,860
conclusions that it is them for a very good reason and i think that speaks to something as well is

1022
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:47,140
like you know whether that lawyer was or wasn't from nintendo we all assume it was because

1023
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:51,940
nintendo has this reputation now in the industry that being said

1024
01:41:54,020 --> 01:42:00,500
i'm not surprised at all and this was a pretty bold move to try to do this guide using all of

1025
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:05,700
these different ip's from a class you know from classic nintendo era here's the interesting thing

1026
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:12,500
when people are selling their prints of samus and mario and things they draw at a convention or

1027
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:16,820
whatever there's kind of a wink and a nod and an under the table type of thing i think the

1028
01:42:16,820 --> 01:42:22,500
scale of this type of project definitely drew somebody's attention um and that's why it

1029
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:28,900
ultimately got shut down but because it's all legalese we'll never know exactly who it was

1030
01:42:28,900 --> 01:42:34,820
and exactly what was said but i think it was smart of him to preemptively pull the plug because he

1031
01:42:34,820 --> 01:42:38,820
made a damn good point if he had continued it he would have had to deliver on those backer

1032
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:44,260
awards and he may not have been able to do that legally so something wondering if like because

1033
01:42:44,260 --> 01:42:49,860
like i'm looking here and looking at the different guides that they have and they have like contra

1034
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:52,580
and there's like ninja guide in and stuff like that i'm wondering if like

1035
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:57,540
couldn't just take metroid and zelda out of there and just do like some of these other guides

1036
01:42:57,540 --> 01:43:02,260
perhaps but the reality is he needs to get permission from the developers in order to

1037
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:08,980
sell something like that on that scale so anyway all right moving on dark sakura

1038
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:22,020
uh the stupid mute button doesn't want to work anyway um uh we have uh uh ueda

1039
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:29,300
rita who was the uh jet set radio artist and the director of yakuza is back at sega

1040
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:39,380
yay and this was like a while it was like 10 years or so um he posted the news on facebook in may

1041
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:45,860
and he was thinking his uh co-workers at yahoo where he'd been working on some mobile titles

1042
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:52,900
that he was going to go back to making games at sega and um apart from being the art director

1043
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:58,020
for jet set radio and jet set radio future um like i said he was the director on the first two yakuza

1044
01:43:58,020 --> 01:44:09,540
games um and uh he is uh it's kind of coinciding with the departure of nagoshi toshiro um who was

1045
01:44:09,540 --> 01:44:16,500
the current yakuza creator that is exactly what came to mind yeah yeah and he's leaving uh for

1046
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:24,020
a chinese company called net ease so um other games that are under ueda's belt uh are rise of

1047
01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:32,180
nightmares uh panzer dragoon uh uh the panzer dragoon series uh including panzer dragoon as a

1048
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:39,780
uh panzer dragoon saga um which was in japan panzer dragoon rpg and panzer dragoon orta and

1049
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:45,780
some of the sonic and sega all-stars racing games so who knows what'll happen i'm looking forward

1050
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:52,740
to it all right welcome back that's going to be interesting that how much yakuza's changed and

1051
01:44:52,740 --> 01:44:57,300
now you know like a dragon is going to be the direction for the main series uh so it's

1052
01:44:57,300 --> 01:45:00,660
interesting the original director is kind of walking back into that where this big change

1053
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:05,380
has happened but uh it'll be interesting i'm very you know just because i enjoyed the last game and

1054
01:45:05,380 --> 01:45:08,660
yes i still need to finish it and you know i've just been distracted with all these other new

1055
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:16,660
shinies um but um i am really uh curious about that next game i'm i'm definitely on board uh for

1056
01:45:16,660 --> 01:45:20,660
the next yakuza game because i i enjoyed like a dragon so much and i still need to go back and

1057
01:45:20,660 --> 01:45:29,140
play the old ones too so anyway we'll see where that goes uh meanwhile loki so we just talked

1058
01:45:29,140 --> 01:45:34,340
about season this is from nintendo so i'm just gonna say one name and you'll already know what's

1059
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:40,820
gonna happen rockstar games so uh and actually take more of take two interactive so we've

1060
01:45:40,820 --> 01:45:45,700
mentioned so many times that take two has gone after modders for different things and so now

1061
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:51,620
here's yet another uh grand theft auto underground that was taking the maps from three and vice city

1062
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:59,700
and kind of bringing them together and so because of that you know they cease and desisted it again

1063
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:04,980
because they're probably going to re-release these games or i'm sorry they're going to um

1064
01:46:06,580 --> 01:46:11,300
not really yeah they're going to port them over to playstation 5 or something like that and it's

1065
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:15,780
gonna be just like the mobile port but did we already know like grand theft auto 3 vice city

1066
01:46:15,780 --> 01:46:20,180
and all that was getting some type of i think it's rumor i don't know if it's like we know that's

1067
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:25,940
coming back yet but like it's i don't know but it's annoying though that you know the modding

1068
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:30,420
scene with grand theft auto is what kind of keeps grand theft auto alive honestly because i think a

1069
01:46:30,420 --> 01:46:35,380
lot of like the roleplay stuff and all that that people play like in five and online is through

1070
01:46:35,380 --> 01:46:39,460
the modding scene and i know a lot of the attention game gets us through the modding scene as well

1071
01:46:41,380 --> 01:46:46,340
like they wouldn't i don't know it's it's really dumb i don't know what happened with take-two

1072
01:46:46,340 --> 01:46:50,260
interactive and okay well take-two interactive has always sucked but like i don't know what's

1073
01:46:50,260 --> 01:46:56,260
happened with rockstar games i they're not the company they used to be unfortunately

1074
01:46:57,300 --> 01:47:01,380
uh fifth dream in chat says i'd play grand theft auto 5 if they added all the other games into it

1075
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:07,780
lol a big grant grand theft super game yeah that was the thought before was like online was

1076
01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:12,660
supposed to kind of expand to like oh you can go liberty city now or you can go to vice city

1077
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:18,180
or something like that i think they're making so much money off of the the garbage that they're

1078
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:22,340
doing right now with it that they just feel that they don't need to make those kinds of updates

1079
01:47:22,340 --> 01:47:26,580
because that's a lot of a lot of updates and for what kind of return are they going to get

1080
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:32,500
not probably much more than what they have now so we'll wait and see i guess there'll be another

1081
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:39,220
10 years of grand theft auto 5 at least we'd make the joke about older scroll skyrim and being

1082
01:47:39,220 --> 01:47:43,620
re-released all the time at least we know there's a new game coming i mean that's been confirmed at

1083
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:50,420
least so you know they have kind of lead there at least on the bethesda side but like rockstar like

1084
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:57,380
we don't know anything yeah it's uh we had it's been a while since we had a really big update

1085
01:47:57,380 --> 01:48:01,700
from rockstar you know exactly i used to be a big champion of the grand theft auto series

1086
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:07,380
and now it's like i just can't play online anymore like i don't have any interest

1087
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:13,620
whatsoever it's such a grind fest and they have like such irritating things inside there like

1088
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:19,140
i mean you have to pay to you know you have to pay rent in your apartment you have to pay to

1089
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:24,340
keep your cars in the garage and you have to pay to have your maintenance guy you know fix your

1090
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:30,740
cars and also it's like it's such a grind just to make it a grind so that you have to buy those

1091
01:48:30,740 --> 01:48:39,700
shark cards is what it is and that's just i'm not interested in that no thanks all right let's get

1092
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:44,340
to one last story tonight and that's catching up a little bit with what's going on with epic games

1093
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:49,700
uh on one front we have the house party app um which i have i had never heard of until of this

1094
01:48:49,700 --> 01:48:54,020
but i guess some people were getting into house party uh during the pandemic um i guess it was

1095
01:48:54,020 --> 01:48:59,060
some type of video chat calling thing although i've pretty much i've heard zoom i've heard

1096
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:04,020
facetime i've heard skype i i never had heard a house party but i guess it was one of the others

1097
01:49:04,020 --> 01:49:08,260
involved with this and then epic actually bought house party uh and now they're going to be shutting

1098
01:49:08,260 --> 01:49:12,820
it down at some point in october in fact it's already gone from stores uh i had no idea that

1099
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:16,740
house party was integrated into fortnite but apparently that was the thing uh and that will

1100
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:22,500
be going away as well um what's also interesting is that um epic is kind of saying as part of the

1101
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:27,460
reason why it's going away they are crafting meaningful and authentic new socialization

1102
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:32,980
features that will be useful at a metaverse level across epic game titles that makes me wonder if

1103
01:49:32,980 --> 01:49:37,780
they're building something for the epic game store and if this isn't something that they want to

1104
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:43,140
build into that because you know epic wants to launch their game store on mobile devices

1105
01:49:44,020 --> 01:49:50,340
and they just like first put all the features in the store i feel like their store sucks compared

1106
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:57,220
to see i'm sorry heart yeah or like a wish list there's so much other ways to browse it

1107
01:49:57,860 --> 01:50:03,700
it really is maybe maybe we shouldn't try to reinvent the chatting in the games and like just

1108
01:50:04,580 --> 01:50:11,700
finish your stupid like they they had a roadmap for their store like come on that is so stupid

1109
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:17,220
but it has been noted that you know fortnite has gone through this interesting shift where now

1110
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:22,420
a lot of the recent reporting hasn't been about battle royale and that game but about things like

1111
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:29,060
the ariana grande concert and uh you know party royale and things like that so it's interesting

1112
01:50:29,060 --> 01:50:33,940
to see what might be uh coming through on that space um something that i referenced there that

1113
01:50:33,940 --> 01:50:37,700
obviously we'd have to mention on the show at some point there was an update this week on the epic

1114
01:50:37,700 --> 01:50:43,140
epic versus apple thing um and there's all sorts of reports out there some are saying apple lost

1115
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:48,740
some are saying well epic kind of lost it too here's the reality of that whole thing and why

1116
01:50:48,740 --> 01:50:54,820
i'm not making a bigger deal out of it um it's not over epics already filed an appeal which is

1117
01:50:54,820 --> 01:50:59,940
which when you consider a lot of the headlines have been apple lost uh the epic is appealing

1118
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:03,940
the decision because there were some things in there that were very unfavorable to epic

1119
01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:10,340
here's the reality this has got a long way to go uh it's gonna go through appeals court

1120
01:51:10,340 --> 01:51:14,100
it's gonna go through a state appeals court and it's gonna end up at the supreme court

1121
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:18,660
guarantee it i'll bet money this ends up at the supreme court now whether they hear it or not

1122
01:51:18,660 --> 01:51:23,460
is another i won't play place money on that but some this will get petitioned to the supreme court

1123
01:51:23,460 --> 01:51:28,500
i guarantee so i mean we're all drawing conclusions about what is going to happen what isn't going to

1124
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:36,180
happen it doesn't it's not going to stick so why why are we wasting time this is this is one hurdle

1125
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:43,780
in what's going to end up being a much longer legal process so get your popcorn anyway

1126
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:52,900
that's my thought on that um anyhow uh we're going to open up the uh discord uh vog network.com

1127
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:59,460
slash discord uh if you would like to uh give us a call in the green room uh while i peek at

1128
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:04,900
discord and see if anything's there i know we also do emails around this time uh let's get to

1129
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:09,380
okay wait a minute because i think we have one email tonight but i don't want this individual

1130
01:52:09,380 --> 01:52:15,380
is also sitting in the green room so you know what this is what we're gonna do let him read

1131
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:22,260
his own email yep hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this hey it's the one and only ron

1132
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:28,900

1133
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:34,260
camera is not working but you know it is what it is that's okay uh i'm trying to find the right

1134
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:39,140
shot here that has uh there we go there's the one that has me and discord there um now here's

1135
01:52:39,140 --> 01:52:43,700
the thing this is why i brought you into the room uh rama um you actually emailed the show tonight

1136
01:52:44,740 --> 01:52:50,820
say what now you you emailed the show tonight right yeah the funny thing is i've been meaning

1137
01:52:50,820 --> 01:52:57,460
to work send that email earlier this week but i have been working on my google certification

1138
01:52:57,460 --> 01:53:04,340
for the last couple of weeks so my brain has kind of sort of been mush you know here's here's what

1139
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:08,340
i did some folks are saying this is an orange entree go first i would like to give dark sakura

1140
01:53:08,340 --> 01:53:12,260
a break tonight and i would like to invite you to read your email on the show tonight rama

1141
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:22,180
do you have the email in your sent folder i haven't but at least she won't get mad at me

1142
01:53:22,180 --> 01:53:31,300
for how bad my email is i talk and she's not the first person to tell me you need to type your

1143
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:41,860
emails better okay no no no no no here's here's my problem here we go ellipsis you use ellipsis

1144
01:53:42,660 --> 01:53:46,420
when it doesn't need to be an ellipsis a period will suffice

1145
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:53,700
i blame it on the new york state uh educational school system i i blame it on typing the way i

1146
01:53:53,700 --> 01:53:58,580
think i do it too and it's because i'm literally typing my thoughts and that's the point of an

1147
01:53:58,580 --> 01:54:03,940
ellipsis is when you are actually fading out on something and leaving something unsaid

1148
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:14,260
maybe i am dot dot dot anyway like what i just told you a moment ago but and i left it that way

1149
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:19,780
all right so so rama do you have the email if you don't have the email i'll i'll ask dark sakura to

1150
01:54:19,780 --> 01:54:24,820
read it but i thought it would be funny i have like i can just give a complete summary on it

1151
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:31,940
all right works for me all right so from the last time we spoke i contacted amazon and told them

1152
01:54:31,940 --> 01:54:39,540
that i got sent the wrong controller so they apologized sent me another one got the package

1153
01:54:40,180 --> 01:54:48,100
opened it up it was not another xbox series controller put it back in the box with amazon

1154
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:54,500
looked around couldn't find i saw the same ad pop back up they said screw it decided to go to

1155
01:54:55,540 --> 01:55:02,180
game stop just take a shot in the dark they had one and it was cheaper so i went and i bought that

1156
01:55:02,820 --> 01:55:12,340
got the controller opened it up and it was a modded first party xbox one controller i mean

1157
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:18,820
they changed the buttons on it it didn't have the right battery case on the back and you can

1158
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:22,980
look at the label because someone basically popped that open just to open up the controller

1159
01:55:22,980 --> 01:55:31,060
to change the buttons how funny the thing is i wasn't really mad i just found it amusing because

1160
01:55:31,060 --> 01:55:38,340
i got it from game stop but i'm not surprised this happened can you imagine buying a modded

1161
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:43,140
system at game stop i'm sure it's happened where somebody bought like a system that was modded but

1162
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:48,980
anyway anyway well there was a time when there were banned consoles they were selling and didn't

1163
01:55:48,980 --> 01:55:54,100
realize it by the way some folks in chat are uh having a little bit of a discussion about um is

1164
01:55:54,100 --> 01:56:00,260
there even actually an xbox series controller at this point and uh here's the thing yes there there

1165
01:56:00,260 --> 01:56:04,020
is xbox controller and i don't think they differentiate between the different ones but i

1166
01:56:04,020 --> 01:56:08,340
think we are saying it to differentiate because we know there are different versions of the xbox

1167
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:13,540
controller for example the latest controller circa 2020 or whatever you want to call it

1168
01:56:13,540 --> 01:56:19,140
has the share button uh hey you're on cam now hey rama uh the one before at the xbox one era

1169
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:24,340
controller does not so there are subtle differences anyway i just wanted to clarify that uh sometimes

1170
01:56:24,340 --> 01:56:28,580
it's not necessarily about the official name but how we differentiate between them which is does

1171
01:56:28,580 --> 01:56:35,540
play into uh rama's uh situation is that you specifically wanted an xbox one controller and

1172
01:56:35,540 --> 01:56:39,460
despite the fact we're all sitting here going why what it doesn't matter it's what you want

1173
01:56:39,460 --> 01:56:47,540
it's your money get into the reason behind that okay um so i went back on i sent the controller

1174
01:56:47,540 --> 01:56:55,860
back i contacted i went to amazon i looked again found the controller same ad link that i bought

1175
01:56:55,860 --> 01:57:01,140
it from before but i looked again it was a different reseller this time so i went through

1176
01:57:01,140 --> 01:57:10,340
them two days later i have a perfectly working xbox one controller now you've got it yep i

1177
01:57:10,340 --> 01:57:16,260
thought you'd have to hit up garage sales to be honest but you got it if i was to hit up garage

1178
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:20,900
sales i would probably be dressed in a hazmat suit walking around to make sure because i don't

1179
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:25,700
trust some of these people around here you'd find much more than a modded controller you'd open up

1180
01:57:25,700 --> 01:57:32,260
the back and be like who put rocks in here i can tell you i've had some people hit up garages and

1181
01:57:32,260 --> 01:57:39,620
find some amazing things you know so i'm just like all righty then all right yes so how how is

1182
01:57:39,620 --> 01:57:43,060
it though to hear now that you got your xbox one controller there's a whole new firmware for it

1183
01:57:43,060 --> 01:57:47,300
because i do when i read that story i instantly thought of you and i was like wow if this doesn't

1184
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:58,580
scream justified to rama's situation so yeah so here's the thing i know there are new controllers

1185
01:57:58,580 --> 01:58:06,580
that are out but let's say for the sake of it i happen to sell my xbox back to game stop or

1186
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:14,820
amazon or whatever i have to have the original controller that it came with or else amazon will

1187
01:58:14,900 --> 01:58:21,700
send it all back saying we can't resell it or game stop will take off 40 bucks because they

1188
01:58:21,700 --> 01:58:26,260
have to put it in one of their controllers to resell the unit one of their unknowingly modded

1189
01:58:26,260 --> 01:58:33,620
controllers yes i okay when you say it when you put it that way i kind of have an aha moment okay

1190
01:58:34,660 --> 01:58:40,180
but the thing is i'm when i get my series x i'm giving my xbox to a couple of friends of mine

1191
01:58:40,180 --> 01:58:45,540
they're not gaming savvy so i want to make sure they have the right controllers and the right

1192
01:58:45,540 --> 01:58:52,100
everything so they'll be good to go you know so another long story short you're doing this

1193
01:58:52,100 --> 01:59:02,580
because you're a good friend yeah basically okay and that is that is not the reason why i even

1194
01:59:02,580 --> 01:59:08,500
called it all right why did you call in what's up all right i'm not sure any of y'all covered this

1195
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:13,380
or anything like that because i know from time to time y'all will take a good night off for various

1196
01:59:13,380 --> 01:59:20,020
reasons and for our show we've been taking a couple of weeks off here and there because we're

1197
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:26,820
just exhausted like mental health issues and it's something that we talk about on our show if we

1198
01:59:26,820 --> 01:59:33,060
miss a week or if a certain host hasn't been around we're basically open about this because

1199
01:59:33,060 --> 01:59:38,340
we all have issues one way or another so i'm wondering have you loki or jamie have

1200
01:59:38,340 --> 01:59:44,180
you just been like you know what i i just don't have the mental energy to do a show i'm just going

1201
01:59:44,180 --> 01:59:53,060
to go to bed or do something else you know um i'll start i i think for me like having that

1202
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:58,260
night off last week and doing the dragon con even though i know it was weird this year and

1203
01:59:58,260 --> 02:00:04,740
you know was a risk in some regard um that was so important for my mental health like just being

1204
02:00:04,740 --> 02:00:10,260
able to have that break and do that thing was so necessary for me that i feel like that was a way

1205
02:00:10,260 --> 02:00:16,500
to recharge my batteries um quite a bit um but um i'll let my co-host take the question if they

1206
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:27,300
want to add anything further to it i mean i'm always like that so it's fine well loki i know

1207
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:32,820
this show has oftentimes for you been a chance to kind of escape your normal monday through

1208
02:00:32,820 --> 02:00:38,020
friday type of life and like gives you something kind of different to do so yeah i think i get i

1209
02:00:38,020 --> 02:00:43,940
mean yeah but like i'm not really escaping anything because you know usually the kids

1210
02:00:43,940 --> 02:00:49,860
are behind me or like you know yeah not really leaving the house so it's not so much an escaping

1211
02:00:49,860 --> 02:00:55,460
or especially since i work right here in this very desk and computer and spot and all that stuff so

1212
02:00:55,460 --> 02:01:04,100
it's not really so much an escape anymore um plus it's it's important to note too that none of us

1213
02:01:04,100 --> 02:01:09,300
are required to be here none of us are paid to be here um so if anybody wanted to take a night off

1214
02:01:09,300 --> 02:01:15,540
for any reason um they're entitled to it uh that's that's what it is it's a little for my medical

1215
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:21,060
conditions it's a little harder when it's me because yes all the production stuff is still

1216
02:01:21,060 --> 02:01:26,580
being run out of my house even in the covet area and so forth um but hypothetically it could be

1217
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:32,420
done without me we just haven't really had to cross that bridge yet um so you know but dark

1218
02:01:32,420 --> 02:01:39,940
sacros up on and loki they both know how to stream so it wouldn't be that hard um so i am

1219
02:01:39,940 --> 02:01:46,900
i don't know uh i think in some ways this is kind of like a regular thing to kind of gravitate back

1220
02:01:46,900 --> 02:01:52,260
to too it's in a way it's a bit of an anchor um so it's kind of like you know that thing that

1221
02:01:52,260 --> 02:01:59,940
well there's still always olr on sunday night um yeah yeah i sometimes don't know what i would do

1222
02:01:59,940 --> 02:02:09,300
without having this on sunday yeah any thoughts on that rama totally get that it's for me as a

1223
02:02:10,260 --> 02:02:16,260
twitch viewer it's there are certain uh people i watch on certain days and it's like if they're

1224
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:22,340
not doing a show on that day it's like well what do i do with my time and it's like and i get a

1225
02:02:22,340 --> 02:02:28,420
tap on the shoulder and it's like the spirit of my 500 video games like pick one or something like

1226
02:02:28,420 --> 02:02:39,700
that but as uh as a content creator i have like this rule of two if it's only two people to do

1227
02:02:39,700 --> 02:02:47,620
the show with i just cancel for the week because i'm like you know itchigo is not feeling up to it

1228
02:02:47,620 --> 02:02:54,260
she's things have been happening she can't get into doing the show or taco chan's the same i'm

1229
02:02:54,260 --> 02:02:59,860
like you know what we'll just do no show we'll just enjoy the tuesday off we'll come back next

1230
02:02:59,860 --> 02:03:06,740
week refreshed and we'll explain you know we needed some time off and this is what we do and

1231
02:03:06,740 --> 02:03:13,220
so on and so forth you know we try to be as transparent as possible yeah um i appreciate

1232
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:17,300
a lot of the things you guys are saying in chat too like pod culture and chat says olr has been

1233
02:03:17,300 --> 02:03:21,620
my rock during some rough times uh fifth dream says i don't leave the house now so bobby blackwolf

1234
02:03:21,620 --> 02:03:26,100
and olr are kind of the marker that it's a new week um i deeply appreciate those comments and

1235
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:31,940
i'm so thankful um that being said i also need to prepare folks for the reality the show isn't

1236
02:03:31,940 --> 02:03:37,860
going to last forever there is going to be a day what there is going to be a day when we say

1237
02:03:39,620 --> 02:03:45,380
um you know thanks for playing but roll credits you know type of thing for whatever the reason

1238
02:03:45,380 --> 02:03:52,020
is um so i just the only reason i put that out there is i say i say thank you for that but also

1239
02:03:52,660 --> 02:03:57,860
um it sometimes can be a little bit of pressure um and i just you know there's a reason why we

1240
02:03:57,860 --> 02:04:04,260
also say you know please support independent podcasting um i hope one day when this show

1241
02:04:04,260 --> 02:04:09,860
does inevitably end you all will still continue to support other uh indie broadcasters and any

1242
02:04:09,860 --> 02:04:14,580
podcasters and so forth and show the love that you've shown to us to somebody else who also

1243
02:04:14,580 --> 02:04:20,100
deserves it so they okay pod culture says we know we know i i know but i just i i still feel some

1244
02:04:20,100 --> 02:04:25,780
sort of weird obligation to kind of say like please please understand please understand

1245
02:04:26,740 --> 02:04:33,060
you know i i'm happy that we have been able to be there for you but we may not be able to be next

1246
02:04:33,060 --> 02:04:40,340
time so you know i i totally get that um in regards to you know how everybody sets their

1247
02:04:40,340 --> 02:04:46,580
schedule to olr on sundays something that i've been talking about in therapy about trying to

1248
02:04:46,660 --> 02:04:53,620
have like some type of schedule a routine and stuff like that and i use outlook to kind of

1249
02:04:53,620 --> 02:05:00,020
put my week together even though i know what i'm doing every day i actually have like olr

1250
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:06,660
listed in outlook so when i open up my calendar it kind of helps me because you know still

1251
02:05:07,300 --> 02:05:12,260
job hunting and so forth you know at least when i get up it's like i have something to do

1252
02:05:12,260 --> 02:05:19,380
and i'm okay with it and it kind of puts my mind at ease and and as much as i love being a content

1253
02:05:19,380 --> 02:05:24,980
creator streaming and all that i've actually said to my group that day when i wake up and look

1254
02:05:24,980 --> 02:05:33,540
around my room and say this is not fun anymore i i'm done i don't want to do this anymore we will

1255
02:05:33,540 --> 02:05:41,700
just wrap it up and just go out on a high note and i think that's what we have to aspire to do too

1256
02:05:41,700 --> 02:05:48,100
you know when it inevitably is is done so yeah well hey i still have to wait to hear back from

1257
02:05:48,100 --> 02:05:56,500
guinness yeah i was gonna say anytime we have 20 years looming uh it would be a shame to miss that

1258
02:05:56,500 --> 02:06:02,420
but um if if i i think we'll get there but if we miss it one episode before 20 years there you go

1259
02:06:05,540 --> 02:06:10,980
so i'm i'm curious which gaming podcasts are chomping at the bit waiting for us to go off

1260
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:15,460
the air so they could take the crown of longest running game because i actually don't know who

1261
02:06:15,460 --> 02:06:20,100
it is i don't know who comes after us i have there's like a list of five that i think are

1262
02:06:20,100 --> 02:06:26,660
up there i don't know who it is you know longest doesn't really seem to i mean it's i'll take

1263
02:06:26,660 --> 02:06:35,060
longest but like longest running show that no one knows who yeah exactly yeah i i've actually used

1264
02:06:35,060 --> 02:06:39,940
to say on my show from time to time the number one anime podcast in the tri-state area and it's

1265
02:06:39,940 --> 02:06:44,180
like well at least it's something we go to convention we can't even say that anymore because

1266
02:06:44,180 --> 02:06:50,100
another podcast said they're the number one in sacramento so we can't take that oh no no no no

1267
02:06:50,100 --> 02:06:58,100
we are we are the one the one i but i don't i don't want to pick a fight so i just kind of

1268
02:06:58,100 --> 02:07:04,020
smile and nod and say that's that's cute so pick a pat on the head yeah not pick a fight and you

1269
02:07:04,020 --> 02:07:10,020
play uh mario party online you know team team play you know but why do we have to fight for

1270
02:07:10,020 --> 02:07:16,020
what we know is true yeah i think i think you actually put it best before with this topic came

1271
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:21,060
up years ago when that which i actually think they dropped that along i i don't know if our

1272
02:07:21,060 --> 02:07:25,060
shady shade came back around or what i actually think they dropped that a long time ago so to be

1273
02:07:25,060 --> 02:07:32,500
it's it's it's it's pretty bold to like call yourself the number one like like no is anyone

1274
02:07:32,500 --> 02:07:39,220
calling you that like was there a poll i mean like it it's just it's it's weird to call yourself

1275
02:07:39,220 --> 02:07:44,740
that but it's like it's almost like nominating like stuff for like hey this is the number one

1276
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:49,620
podcast in my house i don't i i gotta watch i don't want to go down a shady slope i wanna i

1277
02:07:49,620 --> 02:07:55,780
want everybody to prosper but um i would say uh you know um i forgot what i was gonna say

1278
02:07:55,780 --> 02:07:58,260
damn it all right whatever i've been having train derailments all night

1279
02:07:58,260 --> 02:08:05,460
so you do listen to our show on a regular basis i remembered quick the train got back on rails

1280
02:08:05,460 --> 02:08:10,020
i liked the angle that i think it was dark soccer somebody took when this issue first came up years

1281
02:08:10,020 --> 02:08:16,580
ago um was that well why aim for just our city when we can be number one in the world and i

1282
02:08:16,580 --> 02:08:21,620
think that's where that i think i did say that that's where that whole number one podcast in

1283
02:08:21,620 --> 02:08:27,460
the galaxy and that whole joke came up yeah i think it came out of that so i'm so clever

1284
02:08:28,340 --> 02:08:34,020
was it that one town that was able to say that they're like the the central hub of

1285
02:08:34,020 --> 02:08:38,660
video games or something like that it's like it was it like in nebraska or something like that

1286
02:08:38,660 --> 02:08:43,540
where the video game hall of fame is or something like that where like it's like the self-proclaimed

1287
02:08:43,540 --> 02:08:50,740
you know capital of video games like what um sho 100 matt in chat says may not have a ton of

1288
02:08:50,740 --> 02:08:55,620
listeners but we're all better than most of the people out there you don't want as fans honestly

1289
02:08:55,620 --> 02:09:00,340
i'm starting to discover that as more and more true as the years go on you will notice knock

1290
02:09:00,340 --> 02:09:06,660
on wood i don't want to um curse things you'll notice no hose have showed up to this channel

1291
02:09:06,660 --> 02:09:12,820
now i think the reality is i'm going to just say it's because we're not using the lgbtq or black

1292
02:09:12,820 --> 02:09:20,340
tags which is why the hose have not shown up um or other marginalized communities um but you know

1293
02:09:20,340 --> 02:09:28,340
that's that's the type of attention we don't want so anyway we distanced ourselves a little

1294
02:09:28,340 --> 02:09:31,140
bit from your original question rama is there anything else you want to talk about

1295
02:09:33,380 --> 02:09:38,580
you need to jump on your iphone and download bang dream girls band party and play it and have fun

1296
02:09:38,580 --> 02:09:43,380
with it i want to see this switch game i looked at the screenshots i'm like this this looks like

1297
02:09:43,700 --> 02:09:51,540
ddr but like amplitude to me it's more like um i would say more like beatmania meets guitar here

1298
02:09:51,540 --> 02:09:57,700
the way it comes down because i have there's a free game uh the love live game for playstation

1299
02:09:57,700 --> 02:10:03,780
4 it plays kind of similar but it's kind of it's like buttons around the screen and you just got

1300
02:10:03,780 --> 02:10:10,500
to tap it out it's a it's a fun time waster so no i i will check it out i didn't know it was

1301
02:10:10,500 --> 02:10:15,220
something on the phone so that's a very easy way to check it out yeah it's that's where it started

1302
02:10:15,220 --> 02:10:22,820
and i mean there's tons of like rhythm games on the mobile device especially anime based ones

1303
02:10:23,460 --> 02:10:29,460
um i'll say this if you play the love live one don't get too deep into it because it's a mix of a

1304
02:10:30,900 --> 02:10:36,740
rhythm game dating sim and then you have all these like mini games and stuff i have known people who

1305
02:10:36,740 --> 02:10:45,140
get very competitive in it and it's like yeah take my phone away please all right uh so rama

1306
02:10:45,140 --> 02:10:48,020
uh rama i'm gonna let you go because i see somebody else in the green room i want to get on

right bye all right let's go right into another call before the video looks all messed up for

1311
02:11:11,620 --> 02:11:15,540
a little while so let's bring in our next person and hi there you're on orange launch radio who's

1312
02:11:15,540 --> 02:11:24,580
this uh this is yyr hey yyr welcome to the discord call-in thing we're trying how's it going sweet

1313
02:11:24,580 --> 02:11:32,020
it's going okay and i can unabashedly say that i have the number one game about shitting all over

1314
02:11:32,020 --> 02:11:40,340
people i have the number two game about that you have the number one number two game and then loki

1315
02:11:40,340 --> 02:11:50,260
has the number two number one number two game my head is already spinning but yes that part

1316
02:11:50,260 --> 02:11:57,220
what's on your mind uh well actually uh unfortunately i missed the earlier parts of the show

1317
02:11:57,220 --> 02:12:00,820
but uh i did wanted to i did want to bring to some people's attention

1318
02:12:01,380 --> 02:12:08,020
um the wonderful audience of this show uh that there are some updates to pixel poops and pixel

1319
02:12:08,020 --> 02:12:13,140
poops number two this week uh did were they uh with some of those already mentioned loki talked

1320
02:12:13,140 --> 02:12:17,540
about the updates to number two but he didn't talk about the updates to the main game if you wanted

1321
02:12:17,540 --> 02:12:24,260
to get into that oh okay well actually the updates to the main game are very small really um but

1322
02:12:24,260 --> 02:12:29,940
actually all the updates are now live on steam so if you did purchase number two on steam the next

1323
02:12:29,940 --> 02:12:34,740
time you open up the steam client you will notice if you have things set to automatically update

1324
02:12:34,740 --> 02:12:43,220
that you already have the new version of number two so get on that um but yes i decided i would

1325
02:12:43,220 --> 02:12:53,380
go ahead and add something to uh the base game that actually you requested rob oh shit and

1326
02:12:53,380 --> 02:12:57,460
literally this okay okay which one which one is it though because i think i've requested multiple

1327
02:12:57,460 --> 02:13:04,580
things well usually i'm pretty quick on the draw with like an episode number and an audio clip

1328
02:13:04,580 --> 02:13:10,180
but unfortunately i don't have those this time uh i will mention though that probably a couple of

1329
02:13:10,180 --> 02:13:15,860
months ago you mentioned and this probably followed a discussion about mortal combat

1330
02:13:15,860 --> 02:13:22,340
and the blood code and things like that and you probably said well you know i think it'd be pretty

1331
02:13:22,340 --> 02:13:30,580
funny if pixel poops had something like a strawberry ice cream mode where uh yes i think

1332
02:13:30,580 --> 02:13:38,180
i was talking about making your game family safe yes exactly so it's so is it pixel scoops now

1333
02:13:38,180 --> 02:13:45,540
okay this is funny because you probably haven't caught up to the episode yet but um just two weeks

1334
02:13:45,540 --> 02:13:51,460
ago or the the show before we took a break the little parody bump to the intro show was pumpkin

1335
02:13:51,460 --> 02:13:58,340
spice pixel poops oh my god i should have i thought when you said that you were putting that

1336
02:13:58,340 --> 02:14:03,860
in i thought that's what i got was my pumpkin spice pixel poops but this is totally updating

1337
02:14:03,860 --> 02:14:12,340
it again i'm i'm totally gonna like do that tomorrow i don't know but um yes uh

1338
02:14:16,580 --> 02:14:24,580
you have power rob um so yes there there is a now there is now a strawberry ice cream mode in

1339
02:14:24,580 --> 02:14:31,860
pixel poops along with a second bonus mode that my wife suggested and it's terrible and horrible and

1340
02:14:32,260 --> 02:14:36,420
should not have gone in there but it only took two minutes to do after doing the first

1341
02:14:36,420 --> 02:14:43,540
one and someone will find it funny so that went in there also and uh they're accessible via secret

1342
02:14:43,540 --> 02:14:50,500
codes oh remember those yes of course are they are they codes we're gonna be able to figure out

1343
02:14:50,500 --> 02:14:57,140
or do we get a hint or what oh no i'll just straight up give it to you um okay okay cool

1344
02:14:57,140 --> 02:15:03,620
insider info for olr listeners yeah i put on the patch notes that if uh if you want the codes now

1345
02:15:03,620 --> 02:15:09,460
you should listen to the orange flounce radio podcast but i will publish them publicly uh in

1346
02:15:09,460 --> 02:15:15,940
the future i guess all right cool so these are type-in codes so you'll need a keyboard to do it

1347
02:15:15,940 --> 02:15:20,260
and the reason i say that is because you know some people they'll game on their tv they'll

1348
02:15:20,260 --> 02:15:25,620
only have a controller in their hands so yes you will need a keyboard uh to enter these codes but

1349
02:15:25,860 --> 02:15:30,420
you enter them on the game over screen which you know it's the first screen that comes up

1350
02:15:30,420 --> 02:15:36,020
when you start the game when you start the app really uh and also it obviously comes up when

1351
02:15:36,020 --> 02:15:41,620
the game is over uh but you know don't have any menu open just be on the game over screen

1352
02:15:41,620 --> 02:15:49,700
it can be cycling colors or whatever to enable strawberry ice cream mode type in a b a c a b b

1353
02:15:49,700 --> 02:15:58,100
b isn't that like the blood code just like in a different order no it's the same oh it's the same

1354
02:15:59,060 --> 02:16:04,820
it is exactly the same as the sega genesis mortal combat blood code yes great great so the the

1355
02:16:04,820 --> 02:16:11,300
family-friendly strawberry ice cream mode is uh the blood code perfect yes exactly okay and and

1356
02:16:11,300 --> 02:16:17,060
for the other terrible thing that my wife suggested just press the period key six times

1357
02:16:19,700 --> 02:16:26,580
okay it is exactly what you think it is okay and uh both of them all they do is change the

1358
02:16:26,580 --> 02:16:32,100
color of the poop and uh they take effect until the game is quit and then restarted

1359
02:16:32,100 --> 02:16:38,180
and then it goes back to normal okay i love that do any any insight what the pumpkin spice code

1360
02:16:38,180 --> 02:16:45,140
might be um well right now i just have it set to use the a b and c and the period keys so

1361
02:16:45,940 --> 02:16:53,780
um and it's ignoring everything else and so i might just make a variation of the abac abb code

1362
02:16:53,780 --> 02:16:58,580
just have it be about my favorite band i don't know just that's invincibility in

1363
02:16:58,580 --> 02:17:06,420
akari warriors it is invincibility in akari warriors well that just makes it even funnier

1364
02:17:06,420 --> 02:17:08,580
and i hear from the other room abba

1365
02:17:08,980 --> 02:17:19,620
so even no it's abba it's not abba it's abba you get to be a dancing queen on your way to

1366
02:17:19,620 --> 02:17:25,460
shooting people angrily i love it just to make sure it's not too easily guessable i might just

1367
02:17:25,460 --> 02:17:33,060
have you have to type it in twice abba abba okay the more the better exactly so uh yeah please look

1368
02:17:33,060 --> 02:17:39,540
forward to that i will pumpkin spice that's hilarious i have to send you i'll have to send

1369
02:17:39,540 --> 02:17:45,060
you the image because i i changed the little taco cabana into a starbucks um it's really horrible

1370
02:17:45,060 --> 02:17:53,060
for well i'm sorry uh a um square dollars um coffee store uh and uh i all i did i did a

1371
02:17:53,060 --> 02:17:57,780
horrible paint job with the color over so i was like when i saw it on the uh video preview i was

1372
02:17:57,780 --> 02:18:04,980
like god damn that turned out ugly that makes it plenty yeah it does i realize i agree part of the

1373
02:18:04,980 --> 02:18:10,500
charm of the opening segments of the show is how did rob destroy photoshop this week which

1374
02:18:11,140 --> 02:18:18,260
plot twist i don't use photoshop i use snag it okay i expected you to say microsoft paint but

1375
02:18:18,260 --> 02:18:24,020
uh don't i i i'll try but snag it's kind of that also i use snag it a lot at work because it's

1376
02:18:24,020 --> 02:18:30,260
actually very powerful software for for those types of screenshots yeah and i'm on a mac i

1377
02:18:30,260 --> 02:18:38,580
don't have that problem all right uh yyr i totally appreciate the update and i'm flattered as always

1378
02:18:38,580 --> 02:18:43,620
that you know again you not only come to us with all the latest and greatest with your games but

1379
02:18:43,620 --> 02:18:49,540
that you you fucking humor us in the first place we don't deserve it we truly don't you know what

1380
02:18:49,620 --> 02:18:57,300
though i and and i continue to insist that if i ever do get discovered and you know things

1381
02:18:57,300 --> 02:19:02,420
actually start to you know i i actually make enough money to pay for my daughter's college

1382
02:19:02,420 --> 02:19:09,380
out of this uh i will still come to olr with all the news and updates and and uh yeah appreciate

02:19:09,380 --> 02:19:15,060
that and appreciate you my friend gotta know your roots all right as long as you're still around

1384
02:19:16,020 --> 02:19:21,620
yeah yeah after that last last conversation i probably scared everybody huh uh i don't know

1385
02:19:21,620 --> 02:19:26,500
i think we should do something for 888 because it's triple infinity i know it's come it's it's

1386
02:19:26,500 --> 02:19:30,420
weird all these episode numbers i never thought we'd get to are coming up before we know it a

1387
02:19:30,420 --> 02:19:37,060
thousand i think i already figured out episode 1000 was going to be at disneyland no no no no

1388
02:19:37,060 --> 02:19:42,100
like the actual date was something like 2023 i think it was around 20 november i think if

1389
02:19:42,100 --> 02:19:47,540
we actually plotted the right days off it would actually be 20 november of uh 2023 but anyway

1390
02:19:50,420 --> 02:19:54,260
all right while we are my friends you take care we're gonna go wrap up the show and uh congrats

1391
02:19:54,260 --> 02:20:00,660
on uh pixel poops i hope everybody will buy it to play pumpkin spice uh strawberry ice cream and

1392
02:20:00,660 --> 02:20:06,100
other modes in the game ah well i'll just remind you that you don't even need to because the game

1393
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:09,620

1396
02:20:24,500 --> 02:20:31,220
because i paid for the commodore 64 version as well as pixel poops number two that i i

1397
02:20:31,220 --> 02:20:36,500
i would happily give yyr five dollars if he asked for it anytime maybe not every day because i do a

1398
02:20:36,500 --> 02:20:44,020
broke but you know i'll buy so i did a thing by the way what'd you do i i had my first pumpkin

1399
02:20:44,020 --> 02:20:51,220
product oh i did not i did not have a pumpkin spice i had a pumpkin product good enough i

1400
02:20:51,220 --> 02:20:59,540
had a pumpkin cream cheese muffin oh yummy and it was delightful one of the ones from the place with

1401
02:20:59,540 --> 02:21:07,460
the mermaid yes i only ate the top of it gave the rest of it to dan that's like i was looking

1402
02:21:07,460 --> 02:21:14,740
at the drinks and i was like a pink drink um that apple flavor is really good i know i'm so i want

1403
02:21:14,740 --> 02:21:20,820
to have it in a chai i don't like caramel that's fair yeah so i want to have it i hear it's uh

1404
02:21:21,620 --> 02:21:27,460
actually uh another probably mutual friend of ours out of other people's streams um uh

1405
02:21:28,340 --> 02:21:35,460
i never know exactly how to pronounce the name like gaga stirs not anyway not a name i recognize

1406
02:21:36,100 --> 02:21:40,980
yeah i never know how to pronounce it but i always remember seeing it um but that was a suggestion

1407
02:21:40,980 --> 02:21:45,300
that they made so i was like i have to try that i like chai and i like apple and the flavors would

1426
02:23:24,500 --> 02:23:30,100
like meanwhile i had mr smoosh dramatically laying on the floor in the kitchen like he was dying

1427
02:23:30,660 --> 02:23:37,300
because his feeder's time has been pushed back a half hour because one of his dads me accidentally

1428
02:23:37,300 --> 02:23:42,260
unplugged the uh long ass cord for the feeder when i was shoving my suitcase into the closet

1429
02:23:43,220 --> 02:23:53,700
no anyway um so uh nickelodeon ulcer brawl uh had a a box art kind of leak i guess on the e-shop

1430
02:23:53,700 --> 02:24:00,580
and so we kind of get a look of what you know ang korra uh ren and simpy look like now uh because

1431
02:24:00,580 --> 02:24:06,180
they've got you know the character art on there so uh that's the thing no new like actual like

1432
02:24:06,180 --> 02:24:12,980
leaks as far as like new characters or anything from that but um yeah it's neat to see like at

1433
02:24:12,980 --> 02:24:18,580
least what some of the characters look like so they have that um also i should mention that

1434
02:24:18,580 --> 02:24:29,460
steam's 18 years old now what today's i think the anniversary of that um so yeah that's a thing and

1435
02:24:29,460 --> 02:24:35,860
um hot wheels unleashed is gonna have lots of dlc including stuff uh ties in with uh

1436
02:24:36,420 --> 02:24:43,860
street fighter superman wonder woman masters of the universe and barbie and batman as well as

1437
02:24:43,860 --> 02:24:48,740
car companies that game looks kind of cool i'll have to check it out when that actually uh comes

1438
02:24:48,740 --> 02:24:56,900
out but yeah that's it uh dr c in chat uh says about the nickelodeon fighting game um that they

1439
02:24:56,900 --> 02:25:02,900
had videos of spongebob his moves are on brand and ridiculous i noticed the taunt wave gashing

1440
02:25:02,900 --> 02:25:08,900
the taunt was that meme you know with that that was really funny i thought that was perfect that

1441
02:25:08,900 --> 02:25:15,140
game looks fantastic so uh one other story i did see was that the animal crossing series one through

1442
02:25:15,140 --> 02:25:20,260
four amiibo cards are being reprinted and i do want to say that i was i i tend to hang out at

1443
02:25:20,340 --> 02:25:27,620
target on fridays when my son goes to his coding class and um they do have those cards in stock as

1444
02:25:27,620 --> 02:25:32,660
well as the hello kitty and san rio cards are in stock now okay you'll pick those up if you want

1445
02:25:32,660 --> 02:25:38,500
those cards i haven't seen them near me so if you would pick me up a san rio pack i would gladly

1446
02:25:38,500 --> 02:25:44,660
pay back yeah they have multiple san rio packs do you need all of them or just one um i guess i

1447
02:25:44,660 --> 02:25:50,660
would need all of them i mean what do you mean by multiple like like do like they're each one card

1448
02:25:51,380 --> 02:25:55,860
they're well it's packs of cards but they're different like steps i i have to look at it

1449
02:25:55,860 --> 02:26:00,420
again but like uh i did see those before and i was like why would people buy these because

1450
02:26:00,420 --> 02:26:06,020
it's just for the posters right so um but yeah i'll pick them up i can thank you

1451
02:26:08,900 --> 02:26:12,100

1457
02:26:41,300 --> 02:26:47,140
twitch for vog network also goes a long way in supporting the show and you certainly don't have

1462
02:27:09,860 --> 02:27:17,780
final thoughts and wrap ups here so we'll start with uh dark sakura um i will be doing um hope

1463
02:27:17,780 --> 02:27:23,460
i'm gonna try to do it this month i'm gonna do a subathon um or a followathon or a bitathon

1464
02:27:23,460 --> 02:27:30,180
whatever it is because uh i want to do something to give back for any help that i have received

1465
02:27:30,180 --> 02:27:37,300
so keep your eyes open um and i also have been making merch specifically for dead by daylight

1466
02:27:37,300 --> 02:27:43,220
fans so let me know there will be other things in coming to the vog store for other games that

1467
02:27:43,780 --> 02:27:50,740
we have been discussing that aren't dead by daylight great i may even be doing a variation

1468
02:27:50,740 --> 02:28:00,020
of my last release for mine specifically for vog okay fun yeah nice all right um let's see uh so

1469
02:28:00,020 --> 02:28:03,460
i think i think you're probably gonna head off because you're gonna start your stream i am

1470
02:28:03,540 --> 02:28:07,780
i gotta switch uh from cammo to obs cam so we'll see you next week

1471
02:28:07,780 --> 02:28:11,540
meanwhile while we say goodbye to dark sakura loki what's your final thought for tonight

1472
02:28:12,340 --> 02:28:17,460
my final thought is i did put up a new episode of my minecraft series last week and then i have

1473
02:28:17,460 --> 02:28:24,020
a new one coming soon i've like i said i did a ton of stuff this week so i just i i filmed

1474
02:28:24,020 --> 02:28:29,460
everything and i didn't like it so i'm gonna film it again it's just the way it works um

1475
02:28:30,260 --> 02:28:36,900
perfectionist but i get it that's not it's not it's just like it just didn't it my last few

1476
02:28:36,900 --> 02:28:41,700
videos have been kind of rambly and long and i've been trying to tighten that up a bit it's more

1477
02:28:41,700 --> 02:28:46,180
just because i'm like i'm like i just want to just get it out you know and so i just got to do this

1478
02:28:46,180 --> 02:28:52,420
like mental dump type thing and i don't know if that necessarily generates more views or not but

1479
02:28:52,420 --> 02:28:57,060
um it is what it is so yeah the last episode was pretty cool because we decorated the shopping

1480
02:28:57,060 --> 02:29:01,620
district and so now it looks all pretty and everything nice and then um yes so that's a

1481
02:29:01,620 --> 02:29:06,820
pretty cool in the watch um but yeah there should be some new stuff coming i do want to start

1482
02:29:06,820 --> 02:29:11,060
streaming because right now my channel is not growing at all i mean i know you're supposed to

1483
02:29:11,060 --> 02:29:16,980
let the algorithm do its thing but like that takes like a couple years does take to do its thing so

1484
02:29:16,980 --> 02:29:24,260
it's like i hear you so we'll see maybe maybe streaming will be better i don't know or not

1485
02:29:24,980 --> 02:29:28,580
um well speaking of streaming i will use my final thought to give my own channel

1486
02:29:28,580 --> 02:29:32,740
at rob roberts here on twitch a personal plug i'm gonna be streaming no man's sky again tomorrow

1487
02:29:32,740 --> 02:29:36,820
night i'm trying to get a little further in expedition three who knows maybe finishing it

1488
02:29:36,820 --> 02:29:40,580
probably not tomorrow but at least one more night of twitch drops and then probably later in the

1489
02:29:40,580 --> 02:29:45,060
week if i have the time i'm gonna try to do a stream of the new warrior wear game i'll start

1490
02:29:45,060 --> 02:29:50,420
that from the beginning and play a little bit of that so that's my plan for the week um and then

1491
02:29:50,420 --> 02:29:54,900
a shout out for my husband at allen alchemy as well because excuse me he's been doing a lot of

1492
02:29:54,900 --> 02:30:00,740
streaming and just finished his resident evil 2 uh play with leon uh last night and he was using a

1493
02:30:00,740 --> 02:30:08,980
mod so that leon was running around in nothing but uh tidy grays uh not whities but tidy grays

1494
02:30:08,980 --> 02:30:15,540
basically it's uh of course a big pervy mod um but it was really funny uh so he played the whole uh

1495
02:30:15,540 --> 02:30:20,260
leon campaign with that and it made for some very funny and awkward cut scenes so now he's doing

1496
02:30:20,260 --> 02:30:26,740
claire um he doesn't have a similar mod for claire well it is he has a tifa mod for claire

1497
02:30:26,740 --> 02:30:32,180
so claire is dressed like tifa from final fantasy 7 it's still claire but wearing like that you know

1498
02:30:32,180 --> 02:30:37,940
white top and the yeah so it's kind of funny so check that out on his channel all right that's
