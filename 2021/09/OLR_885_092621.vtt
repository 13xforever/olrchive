00:00.000 --> 00:12.860
Nintendo's reputation in making you rebuy games you already have isn't wrong, but

00:12.860 --> 00:16.740
for those of us who never owned a Nintendo 64, the announcement of N64 games being added

00:16.740 --> 00:19.060
to the Nintendo Switch Online service is thrilling.

00:19.060 --> 00:22.700
Yours truly purchased an N64 controller within the last decade to make a statement about

00:22.700 --> 00:24.940
GoldenEye on the N64 and N64 controllers.

00:24.940 --> 00:28.700
Sadly, there's no telling if others will be making the same one anytime soon.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.680
This is just one story about the return of our youths.

00:30.680 --> 00:33.700
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about

00:33.700 --> 00:36.420
this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every

00:36.420 --> 00:37.420
gamer has a voice.

00:37.420 --> 00:38.420
Hello, my friends back there on the internet.

00:38.420 --> 00:47.420
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:47.420 --> 00:55.880
Orange Lounge Radio is live once again tonight with episode number 885 of our show for this

00:55.880 --> 00:59.260
September the 26th of 2021.

00:59.260 --> 01:04.800
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me, although she's having some webcam problems on Twitch

01:04.800 --> 01:09.080
tonight, we can still hear her and that's the important part for Orange Lounge Radio.

01:09.080 --> 01:11.360
Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:11.360 --> 01:12.360
Hello.

01:12.360 --> 01:13.360
Hi, how are you?

01:13.360 --> 01:14.360
Oh, hello.

01:14.360 --> 01:15.360
Hi, how are you?

01:15.360 --> 01:16.360
I'm all right.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.360
Yeah.

01:17.360 --> 01:21.000
I've had a decent day, although I'm a little sleepy.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.060
I woke up too early this morning.

01:23.620 --> 01:30.460
I tried to nap today and without giving away where I live, you all know I'm in the Sacramento

01:30.460 --> 01:35.160
area because we all are, but they're doing a freaking air show not far from here.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.160
And those planes-

01:36.160 --> 01:37.160
How rude.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.780
Those planes love to break the sound barrier during those air shows.

01:39.780 --> 01:42.260
I still understand why they have to fly over the neighborhoods.

01:42.260 --> 01:43.260
Why can't they-

01:43.260 --> 01:44.320
Why didn't they consult you first?

01:44.320 --> 01:45.320
There's nothing.

01:45.320 --> 01:46.320
Yeah.

01:46.320 --> 01:47.320
Why didn't they consult me first?

01:47.320 --> 01:48.880
Why can't they fly over like Slough House?

01:48.880 --> 01:50.960
There's nothing but dust out there in a cemetery.

01:50.960 --> 01:51.960
Go fly over that.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.180
Why do you have to fly over the neighborhoods?

01:53.180 --> 01:54.180
I hate it.

01:54.180 --> 01:59.180
Anyway, I hope you got a nap because I sure didn't.

01:59.180 --> 02:00.180
No.

02:00.180 --> 02:03.260
Oh, well, that makes two of us grumpy grumpy.

02:03.260 --> 02:04.260
Yeah.

02:04.260 --> 02:07.620
Tomorrow is going to be when I'll really need the nap and can't have one.

02:07.620 --> 02:08.620
Oh, yes.

02:08.620 --> 02:11.220
Why don't you plug your big event tomorrow?

02:11.220 --> 02:15.180
We know we got to mention it at some point tonight, so let's do it at the top.

02:15.180 --> 02:16.180
All right.

02:16.180 --> 02:22.360
At seven o'clock Pacific time on my channel, which is DarkSakura underscore O-L-R on Twitch,

02:22.360 --> 02:29.560
I am doing my very first subathon and I would love it if people can join in and hang out.

02:29.560 --> 02:33.080
That's p.m., seven p.m. Pacific time.

02:33.080 --> 02:38.280
I will be going 12 hours and depending on how many subs I get determines how long I'm

02:38.280 --> 02:40.080
going to keep going.

02:40.080 --> 02:43.160
So yes, your typical subathon start in the morning.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.880
So this is very interesting.

02:44.880 --> 02:45.880
You're going to do an all-nighter.

02:45.880 --> 02:50.620
I'm going to do an all-nighter and I wanted to start something earlier in the day, but

02:50.620 --> 02:59.660
I have a Cairo appointment, so I'm starting it in the afternoon so that I can get more

02:59.660 --> 03:04.100
of my night owl people because there's some people, but the thing is, is that I'm going

03:04.100 --> 03:08.860
to be with me stopping at seven in the morning.

03:08.860 --> 03:20.140
It's still 10 o'clock East Coast and I'll probably still be going because I'm probably

03:20.140 --> 03:22.080
just going to be stubborn and keep going.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.260
Well, good luck.

03:24.260 --> 03:27.160
That's going to be a lot of hours.

03:27.160 --> 03:31.160
Just the overnight is very, but I guess you've done it before.

03:31.160 --> 03:34.360
I'm a night owl anyway, so it'll be fine.

03:34.360 --> 03:36.420
And there will be a couple of breaks here and there.

03:36.420 --> 03:45.480
But also to point out, I have posted the goals and the prizes, the rewards.

03:45.480 --> 03:50.780
I will be doing a giveaway of, at a certain number, I will be doing a giveaway of one

03:50.780 --> 03:57.320
of my Death Hook for Cutie shirts and a sticker.

03:57.320 --> 04:02.760
And if I hit 300 subs, I will play a survivor game.

04:02.760 --> 04:06.180
Which is something you've never done outside of a bot match, right?

04:06.180 --> 04:07.180
Pretty much.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.180
All right.

04:08.180 --> 04:09.180
All right.

04:09.180 --> 04:10.180
Well, good luck.

04:10.180 --> 04:12.860
Break a leg, or I should say, break some survivor legs tomorrow.

04:12.860 --> 04:16.880
I'll get the link and post it in chat for right now.

04:16.880 --> 04:21.600
I would love some support because this is like a big push for me.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.060
It's kind of a me putting myself out there kind of thing.

04:24.060 --> 04:25.060
All right.

04:25.060 --> 04:26.060
Good luck.

04:26.060 --> 04:32.540
It's a crazy timeframe in a way, but that's a great for our folks that are overseas a

04:32.540 --> 04:33.540
great chance.

04:33.540 --> 04:34.540
Oh yeah.

04:34.540 --> 04:35.540
Yeah.

04:35.540 --> 04:36.540
Yeah.

04:36.540 --> 04:40.420
During the day and across the seas in the UK and Australia, it's a huge prime time for

04:40.420 --> 04:41.420
Australia.

04:41.420 --> 04:42.420
So.

04:42.420 --> 04:47.220
Well, and if anyone wants to hop on a VPN and let me kill them when I do kill your friends,

04:47.220 --> 04:48.740
then we'll know.

04:48.740 --> 04:49.740
We'll see.

04:49.740 --> 04:50.740
All right.

04:50.740 --> 04:54.860
Also joining us, who I do not think will be staying up all night long this week, say hello

04:54.860 --> 04:55.860
to Techmaster Loki.

04:55.860 --> 05:01.540
If I will, it won't be to get subs.

05:01.540 --> 05:06.420
It'll be because the kids and the cat are collectively screaming, right?

05:06.420 --> 05:07.980
Uh, yeah.

05:07.980 --> 05:10.420
Uh, how are you doing?

05:10.420 --> 05:11.420
I'm doing fine.

05:11.420 --> 05:13.820
Uh, is that excite truck behind you tonight?

05:13.820 --> 05:14.820
No.

05:14.820 --> 05:15.820
Oh, what is it?

05:15.820 --> 05:18.420
I'm trying to tell motor storm apocalypse.

05:18.420 --> 05:20.920
Oh, why that one?

05:20.920 --> 05:22.220
Because that's my favorite one.

05:22.220 --> 05:23.220
Oh, okay.

05:23.220 --> 05:24.220
Okay.

05:24.220 --> 05:25.220
Out of the motor storm series.

05:25.220 --> 05:26.220
All right.

05:26.220 --> 05:27.220
Fair enough.

05:27.220 --> 05:28.220
Yeah.

05:28.220 --> 05:34.100
Those earthquakes, meteors, uh, Paris, I guess is like an apocalypse thing.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.100
All right.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.100
It was a pretty cool game though.

05:36.100 --> 05:37.100
All right.

05:37.100 --> 05:38.100
Like buildings falling over.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.100
All right.

05:39.100 --> 05:40.660
I have to admit, I haven't played it.

05:40.660 --> 05:41.780
It's one of those things.

05:41.780 --> 05:43.660
Hopefully they release a collection at some point.

05:43.660 --> 05:44.780
That would be nice.

05:44.780 --> 05:46.620
They really need the remaster of that series.

05:46.620 --> 05:47.620
It would be so good.

05:47.620 --> 05:48.620
Yeah.

05:48.620 --> 05:50.180
We've been getting a lot of weird remasters lately.

05:50.180 --> 05:52.540
It'd be nice to get something for that for sure.

05:52.540 --> 05:53.540
All right.

05:53.540 --> 05:54.540
Uh, let's get it.

05:54.540 --> 05:57.860
Speaking of remasters, I know we had some that were mentioned at the Nintendo direct

05:57.900 --> 06:02.060
this week, and I want to get into the kickoff topic, which is, I mean, this has really dominated

06:02.060 --> 06:06.220
the news this week is that Nintendo direct that they sprung on us, um, for Thursday,

06:06.220 --> 06:07.220
right?

06:07.220 --> 06:08.220
It was on Thursday.

06:08.220 --> 06:10.420
The days just blend together at this point.

06:10.420 --> 06:15.200
And um, I don't know about you guys, but I had kind of set the bar low for this because

06:15.200 --> 06:20.100
I figured that Nintendo had pretty much already revealed, um, their holiday stuff.

06:20.100 --> 06:23.820
And, you know, between, you know, WarioWare and Metroid, there really wasn't a lot more.

06:23.820 --> 06:26.340
I kind of figured we were getting all of it at E3.

06:26.340 --> 06:27.860
So my expectations were kind of low.

06:27.860 --> 06:35.140
I thought it was going to be, uh, the Game Boy rumor for the back, for the, um, backwards

06:35.140 --> 06:39.460
compatible stuff, which didn't, nope, that missed the mark, didn't it?

06:39.460 --> 06:44.100
So, um, although, you know, those, those same rumor, people are like, oh no, it's still

06:44.100 --> 06:47.660
coming, but I don't, whatever, we'll, we'll put that to rest for now.

06:47.660 --> 06:51.140
I thought that was going to be like the big thing is that they were going to do a push

06:51.140 --> 06:56.020
for the, um, Nintendo switch online because a lot of people's renewals are right around

06:56.020 --> 06:57.020
now.

06:57.020 --> 06:58.500
Mine just renewed like last week.

06:58.500 --> 07:02.500
So I figured, I thought there might be another 99 thing or something, or, you know, some

07:02.500 --> 07:05.700
more, uh, and, and sure Nintendo switch online did come up.

07:05.700 --> 07:06.700
We'll get into that.

07:06.700 --> 07:12.200
But, uh, as far as the other things that were announced, I, I was tickled.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.540
Like this was a great direct for me.

07:14.540 --> 07:17.660
There were two games in this direct that got announced.

07:17.660 --> 07:24.180
One of them that was released that day, I never thought we'd see games in those series.

07:24.180 --> 07:27.060
I just kind of wrote those serious office dead and gone.

07:27.060 --> 07:29.580
Um, so for me, I was giddy.

07:29.580 --> 07:31.660
I was giddy at Nintendo direct this week.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.220
I don't know how you guys felt.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.500
I had a great direct.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.100
Loki, why don't you get into the recap?

07:37.100 --> 07:41.420
What were some of the things that were discussed in the direct and we'll kind of, since, um,

07:41.420 --> 07:44.340
we have extra time tonight for the kickoff thought that we can kind of break it down

07:44.340 --> 07:45.740
and talk about each one.

07:45.740 --> 07:46.740
Yeah.

07:46.740 --> 07:50.840
So there was a lot of things that we saw just like kind of new trailers for, so they gave

07:50.840 --> 07:53.880
us more in depth look at Metroid Dread.

07:53.880 --> 07:59.640
So it's all set on, uh, basically one planet with lots of different like biomes and stuff

07:59.640 --> 08:00.640
in there.

08:00.640 --> 08:04.280
Definitely reminded me a lot of like super Metroid, that type of thing.

08:04.280 --> 08:08.320
So, um, it looks good and that's weeks away at this point, right?

08:08.320 --> 08:12.060
It's early October, October 8th, but like two weeks away, two weeks away.

08:12.060 --> 08:15.600
So, um, yeah, not surprised to see that show up in the direct.

08:15.600 --> 08:20.920
It's very common for Nintendo to push the games that are upcoming around that week and

08:20.920 --> 08:23.720
even things that may have just released in the last two weeks.

08:23.720 --> 08:26.440
They'll still kind of, excuse me, still kind of push those in the direct.

08:26.440 --> 08:31.000
So I was not surprised to see that at all, but I mean, as if I wasn't going to get it

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
anyway, but sure.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.560
Maybe some people were still on the fence.

08:33.560 --> 08:34.560
Yeah.

08:34.560 --> 08:43.080
Uh, we had a, uh, new, uh, trailer for Splatoon three, I guess, uh, return of the mammalian.

08:43.080 --> 08:44.080
Yeah.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.080
They actually showed a little gameplay.

08:45.080 --> 08:46.080
Now.

08:46.080 --> 08:50.080
It looks like we got a special title or anything seemed to be the big thing.

08:50.080 --> 08:51.080
Looks interesting.

08:51.080 --> 08:55.480
So, um, they, they showed off a bit more gameplay there and kind of explained a little bit of,

08:55.480 --> 08:56.680
you know, what the game was like.

08:56.680 --> 08:57.840
So that's pretty cool.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.200
Um, that's coming next year.

09:00.200 --> 09:04.800
That seems to be rushing along pretty quick, uh, compared to some other Nintendo reveals,

09:04.800 --> 09:06.800
one of which was also in the direct.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.040
You all know what I'm talking about.

09:08.040 --> 09:13.240
Probably we'll get there, but, uh, but, uh, I was just surprised to see Splatoon three

09:13.240 --> 09:14.800
gameplay that quickly.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.380
Um, but great.

09:16.380 --> 09:17.880
I think that's, that's awesome.

09:17.880 --> 09:21.200
Um, Mike Deft is in our chat and I should of course say we do tape live every Sunday

09:21.200 --> 09:25.160
night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the voice of geeks network, twitch.tv

09:25.160 --> 09:29.260
slash vog network, VOG network, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

09:29.260 --> 09:33.420
And Mike Deft is in our chat saying the return of the mammalian is the title for the single

09:33.420 --> 09:34.420
player campaign.

09:34.420 --> 09:42.040
And I'll go so far as to say the first non DLC single player campaign, cause we all know

09:42.040 --> 09:47.120
there'll be another one, uh, bonds double six is asking, Rob, did you squeal?

09:47.160 --> 09:50.160
I sure, you know, I couldn't watch it live.

09:50.160 --> 09:54.600
I, uh, I have daily meetings at work at three o'clock every day and I can't miss them.

09:54.600 --> 09:59.080
Um, so I actually had to wait until four to watch.

09:59.080 --> 10:03.680
Um, but I was very good about not spoiling myself and I watched it and I started doing

10:03.680 --> 10:04.680
notes and everything.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.440
I was going to post my notes on Twitter.

10:06.440 --> 10:10.440
And by the time certain things were announced, I, I threw it out the window because I was

10:10.440 --> 10:13.840
like, I'm just filling up the screen with ease.

10:14.840 --> 10:23.560
Oh, I've got, um, uh, we got another trailer for triangle strategy, uh, which is now out

10:23.560 --> 10:27.600
March 4th, 2022 is still a terrible name for that game.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.600
I'm sorry.

10:28.600 --> 10:33.520
I know it project triangle is now triangle strategy, starring triangle man triangle.

10:33.520 --> 10:34.520
You don't know.

10:34.520 --> 10:35.520
It sounds like it was funny.

10:35.520 --> 10:39.760
It's like project triangle strategy sounds like some someone trying to discuss like a

10:39.760 --> 10:40.760
business plan.

10:40.760 --> 10:50.000
It's not an MLM, but it is an MLM triangle strategy pyramid scheme.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.360
Hey out there on Facebook.

10:51.360 --> 10:56.640
I just need 10 people who want to be their own boss to message me to talk about the triangle

10:56.640 --> 10:57.640
strategy.

10:57.640 --> 11:01.600
What if that's actually what the game's about is trying to get like people signed up for

11:01.600 --> 11:03.160
an MLM or something like that.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.160
Yeah.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.160
I think it's interesting.

11:05.160 --> 11:07.040
Um, but yeah, that's, that's coming along.

11:07.040 --> 11:10.600
Uh, we got the announcement of a Castlevania advanced collection.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.600
Yay.

11:11.600 --> 11:12.600
That was excellent.

11:12.600 --> 11:13.760
I mean, not a surprise.

11:13.760 --> 11:14.760
We knew that was coming.

11:14.760 --> 11:15.760
Yeah.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.660
Like we all kind of figured that was in the direct cause hello, we've had leaks and leaks

11:17.660 --> 11:23.480
and leaks of that thing, but, uh, Dracula X being in it, that was a surprise.

11:23.480 --> 11:24.480
That's what interests me.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.480
Yeah.

11:25.480 --> 11:26.480
Right.

11:26.480 --> 11:27.480
I bought it.

11:27.480 --> 11:33.960
I already bought it, but I bought it on Xbox because I wanted, uh, I wanted to, I wanted

11:33.960 --> 11:34.960
it on my TV.

11:34.960 --> 11:35.960
Run.

11:35.960 --> 11:36.960
Well, yeah.

11:37.320 --> 11:41.440
Let's let's I'll talk about later why I'm learning that I really need to think about

11:41.440 --> 11:42.760
the systems I buy things on.

11:42.760 --> 11:43.760
We'll get into that later.

11:43.760 --> 11:44.760
Yeah.

11:44.760 --> 11:50.520
So let's talk about that right now with, uh, the surprise announcement for act razor Renaissance.

11:50.520 --> 11:53.640
That was a remaster of the original act razor game.

11:53.640 --> 11:58.840
That's out on, uh, switch steam PlayStation four and mobile devices.

11:58.840 --> 12:00.480
And that was a surprise.

12:00.480 --> 12:01.840
Uh, yeah.

12:01.840 --> 12:07.640
Like act razor is like a super Nintendo, like, I guess you could say cult favorite of mine,

12:07.640 --> 12:11.920
like a game I really hold near and dear to my heart, a game that my friend and I stayed

12:11.920 --> 12:13.580
up all night long.

12:13.580 --> 12:19.000
We had a dark soccer subathon night over the weekend and stayed up all night and played

12:19.000 --> 12:20.440
through the entirety of act razor.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.440
Cause that game is amazing.

12:21.440 --> 12:25.880
Um, and if you don't know act razor, it's, um, and it's kind of a theme.

12:25.880 --> 12:28.840
I feel like with these retro games that I used to love, right.

12:28.840 --> 12:31.280
I never shut up about the guardian legend.

12:31.280 --> 12:32.280
Right.

12:32.280 --> 12:36.160
Um, and that's, I think the reason why that game is so fucking good is it blends a shooter

12:36.160 --> 12:41.480
with a like, um, adventure style game, kind of like Zelda ish.

12:41.480 --> 12:43.840
It blends those two genres together very well.

12:43.840 --> 12:48.760
And I think one reason I really liked act razor is that it blends the, um, uh, kind

12:48.760 --> 12:52.960
of side scroller action game with a SIM game.

12:52.960 --> 12:56.320
And it would, the music in that game is phenomenal.

12:56.320 --> 12:59.760
Yuzo Koshiro did the soundtrack, which, you know, that's a, you know, that, know that

12:59.760 --> 13:04.640
name from like streets of rage series and, you know, some other, um, uh, when, uh, midnight

13:04.640 --> 13:08.000
Wangan maximum tune, I'm probably get those words all mixed up, but you know, one of those

13:08.000 --> 13:10.520
racing games that Namco did, I think you got it right.

13:10.520 --> 13:11.520
Did I?

13:11.520 --> 13:12.520
Okay.

13:12.520 --> 13:13.520
Yay.

13:13.520 --> 13:14.520
Um, one gone midnight maximum.

13:14.520 --> 13:15.520
That's it.

13:15.520 --> 13:16.520
Um, so he did, he did all that.

13:16.520 --> 13:19.960
Uh, he even did a DDR song for those that, you know, have been following.

13:19.960 --> 13:25.580
That was a big deal deal when Yuzo Koshiro did a DDR song, just saying, um, anyway, my

13:25.580 --> 13:33.300
point is there was an ActRaiser 2, and for whatever reason, they deleted the SIM part

13:33.300 --> 13:34.300
of the game.

13:34.300 --> 13:36.300
And so it was just the action part.

13:36.300 --> 13:38.100
I don't know why they did that.

13:38.100 --> 13:43.260
Um, but that game did not get the same love that the first game got.

13:43.260 --> 13:46.180
Um, so that was the end of ActRaiser.

13:46.180 --> 13:50.680
And as far as I could tell that series was never coming back.

13:50.680 --> 13:53.140
When was the last time Quintet made a game?

13:53.500 --> 13:58.780
I mean, I think they've had some smaller games in the early aughts, but that was about it.

13:58.780 --> 14:03.300
So the fact that also, I want to point out when you launch, cause you know, I bought

14:03.300 --> 14:06.100
this fucking game and then five minutes in the announcement, as soon as I could on the

14:06.100 --> 14:09.720
store, when you launched the game, it said it's Square Enix.

14:09.720 --> 14:13.660
So they put, and in the credit, it says Quintet slash Square Enix.

14:13.660 --> 14:18.300
Do you mean to tell me, I don't know if that's just like a it's originally Quintet or whatever,

14:18.300 --> 14:21.420
or if they actually reformed the old band.

14:21.420 --> 14:28.760
Because if Quintet is back together, um, do you know that this increases the chances immensely

14:28.760 --> 14:31.620
of a Soul Blazer trilogy remaster?

14:31.620 --> 14:36.500
You want to talk about things that are gonna like really get me to type the letter E in

14:36.500 --> 14:37.700
caps.

14:37.700 --> 14:40.580
Let's talk about a remaster of the Soul Blazer trilogy.

14:40.580 --> 14:43.780
Cause if you ever played those games on Super Nintendo, those games are fucking incredible.

14:43.780 --> 14:47.780
Um, that Soul Blazer Illusion of Gaia was the most well known cause Nintendo published

14:47.780 --> 14:50.860
that one, uh, here in the U S and that was the second game.

14:50.860 --> 14:54.460
And then Terra Nigma never came out in the U S um, cause Nintendo wasn't interested in

14:54.460 --> 14:55.460
publishing it.

14:55.460 --> 15:02.100
Um, so like, if that is where we're going, Oh my God.

15:02.100 --> 15:05.820
Like I know a lot of people out there were like, why couldn't they do Chrono Trigger

15:05.820 --> 15:07.620
or Chrono Cross?

15:07.620 --> 15:08.900
Why didn't Square Enix do that?

15:08.900 --> 15:14.300
Look, I, and honestly it's a fair call out, why, why won't they revisit Chrono Trigger

15:14.300 --> 15:15.300
or Chrono Cross?

15:15.300 --> 15:18.300
I kind of think they're coming.

15:18.300 --> 15:22.900
I think they're going to happen, but it's just not what's happening right now.

15:22.900 --> 15:23.900
Anyway.

15:23.900 --> 15:24.900
I'm sorry, Loki.

15:24.900 --> 15:25.900
What else did you want to say?

15:25.900 --> 15:26.900
I could talk a lot about this.

15:26.900 --> 15:27.900
No.

15:27.900 --> 15:33.620
Um, speaking of another surprise announcement also from Square Enix, a sequel or spiritual

15:33.620 --> 15:39.620
successor to Chocobo racing with Chocobo GP that's coming to the switch as well.

15:39.620 --> 15:42.140
So that's a surprise.

15:42.140 --> 15:44.780
I never thought we'd get another one of those games.

15:44.780 --> 15:45.780
Yes.

15:45.780 --> 15:49.820
I never thought we'd like with, cause that was the first one, not the first one in the

15:49.820 --> 15:53.820
direct, but that was the first one to come up to make me go, what?

15:53.820 --> 15:57.660
Like I lit like, and you know, sometimes we type like LOL when we're not actually laughing

15:57.660 --> 16:01.300
out loud, but like I literally gay gasped.

16:01.300 --> 16:02.300
Okay.

16:02.300 --> 16:04.900
And you all know the gay gasp, right?

16:04.900 --> 16:09.900
Like I did that when I saw the Chocobo GP, which I just was like, Oh my God, I thought

16:09.900 --> 16:12.340
originally it's just, Oh, they're doing Chocobo racing on the switch.

16:12.340 --> 16:15.740
Like they rebastered Chocobo racing for the switch, like, but it turns out it's a whole

16:15.740 --> 16:16.740
new game.

16:16.740 --> 16:21.140
Um, and I'm thrilled cause I love that game on PlayStation.

16:21.140 --> 16:23.060
Yeah.

16:23.060 --> 16:24.580
So that was pretty surprising.

16:24.580 --> 16:29.940
Uh, we got a brand new Kirby game called Kirby and the forgotten land, which also ended up

16:29.940 --> 16:34.260
leaking before the direct, but, and that's when Mike Deft did the gas, but that I could

16:34.260 --> 16:35.860
hear all the way over here.

16:35.860 --> 16:41.220
So that, that game looks pretty much like a Kirby done this, you know, uh, Mario Odyssey

16:41.220 --> 16:42.220
style.

16:42.220 --> 16:47.340
So that's pretty awesome looking actually, and that's coming out April, 2022.

16:47.340 --> 16:53.660
It's like some weird, um, post-apocalyptic looking game, which is kind of interesting.

16:53.660 --> 16:55.940
Bobby Blackwell and chat calls it the last of Kirby.

16:55.940 --> 16:58.360
Uh, and then Mike Deft says it got leaked.

16:58.360 --> 16:59.860
So he did the gasp in the morning.

16:59.860 --> 17:03.260
So I didn't know, I didn't know the whole thing Ali work had me really busy that day.

17:03.260 --> 17:04.260
So I guess that's a good thing.

17:04.260 --> 17:08.380
I was able to kind of avoid all the leaks, but the Kirby thing struck me very much as

17:08.380 --> 17:12.960
like a Mario, um, Mario three D all stars.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.980
The one that's not like, you know what I mean?

17:14.980 --> 17:17.220
Like the 2.5 D you know, it's like, you know what I mean?

17:17.220 --> 17:22.540
The one that was on 3DS, that one, like it, it strikes me as like that, but Kirby.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.580
And I, I thought it looked cool.

17:24.580 --> 17:26.420
Yeah, it looks pretty cool.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.420
I'll get it.

17:27.420 --> 17:28.420
I probably will get it.

17:28.420 --> 17:35.220
Uh, we got some new footage and, um, talk about Bayonetta three.

17:35.220 --> 17:39.860
Which I'm sure everyone was very excited about since it's been so long, uh, it's still coming

17:39.860 --> 17:40.860
out next year though.

17:40.860 --> 17:41.860
At some point.

17:41.860 --> 17:45.760
Yeah, that was a big, I mean, that was the last thing they showed basically.

17:45.760 --> 17:49.100
That was a huge, well, I mean, it's kind of one of those things when they showed it, like,

17:49.100 --> 17:51.660
I think I literally said out loud, it's about time.

17:51.660 --> 17:55.300
Um, but I think most of us had figured they probably weren't going to show it, uh, for

17:55.300 --> 17:56.300
a while.

17:56.380 --> 18:00.700
And also it was that whole thing about, I don't think people were expecting this direct

18:00.700 --> 18:02.420
to be that loaded.

18:02.420 --> 18:06.060
Like our, you know, and that's probably a good thing for once we all approached to direct

18:06.060 --> 18:09.580
with a pretty low bar and I think we got very rewarded for it.

18:09.580 --> 18:13.420
So the Bayonetta three footage was a huge surprise, a nice surprise.

18:13.420 --> 18:14.420
It looks great.

18:14.420 --> 18:19.140
A lot of people speculating there's some crossover in that Bayonetta three, that this might be

18:19.140 --> 18:22.020
a, uh, a universe kind of game.

18:22.020 --> 18:25.660
So it could be interesting to see how that plays out because when the footage first showed

18:25.700 --> 18:29.100
up, people were like, holy fuck, it's astral chain coming back.

18:29.100 --> 18:30.780
And then, oh, it's okay.

18:30.780 --> 18:37.580
Bayonetta is still cool, but boo, I wanted a new astral, well, maybe worlds are colliding.

18:37.580 --> 18:38.580
We'll see.

18:38.580 --> 18:39.580
We'll see.

18:39.580 --> 18:41.500
Mike Deft calls it a platinum verse.

18:41.500 --> 18:42.500
Yeah, absolutely.

18:42.500 --> 18:47.500
Uh, DJ Rama S in chat says Bayonetta three featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry series.

18:47.500 --> 18:50.700
Well, there was a gentleman that showed up at the end.

18:50.700 --> 18:51.900
Some were saying it was Dante.

18:51.900 --> 18:58.300
I don't know if I particularly see that, but, um, I think that's very interesting.

18:58.300 --> 18:59.940
So, yeah.

18:59.940 --> 19:00.940
Right.

19:00.940 --> 19:07.820
Um, then we also got, um, the announcement that there's going to be an expansion pass

19:07.820 --> 19:12.180
for an online service DLC for an online service.

19:12.180 --> 19:13.180
Gotta love that.

19:13.180 --> 19:19.720
Um, and so that's going to be in the form of the Nintendo 64 and Genesis games coming

19:19.720 --> 19:23.960
to Switch Online for an additional fee that we haven't discussed yet what that fee is

19:23.960 --> 19:24.960
necessarily.

19:24.960 --> 19:30.060
Um, but we have the announcements coming late October.

19:30.060 --> 19:35.920
They're going to launch with, uh, Super Mario 64, uh, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Mario

19:35.920 --> 19:43.300
Kart 64, Winback, Star Fox 64, Mario Tennis, uh, Yoshi's Story, Dr. Mario 64, and Sin and

19:43.300 --> 19:44.600
Punishment.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.920
And then there's going to be additional games coming out later on.

19:47.920 --> 19:54.200
Like I think they showed like, uh, or Pokemon Snap in there and, um, gosh, I'm trying to

19:54.200 --> 19:56.760
think of some of the other games that were in there real quick.

19:56.760 --> 20:04.160
Um, but yeah, oh, uh, Kirby 64, the Crystal Shards, Paper Mario, Banjo-Kazooie, uh, Majora's

20:04.160 --> 20:12.740
Mask, F-Zero X, and, uh, Mario Golf were the other ones that were shown off as coming soon.

20:12.740 --> 20:16.760
Then they also, uh, showed off the Genesis games in that collection.

20:16.760 --> 20:22.960
So you've got Castlevania Bloodlines, Contra Hardcore, uh, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine,

20:22.960 --> 20:30.160
Echo the Dolphin, Golden Axe, Gunstar Heroes, M.U.S.H.A., Fantasy Star 4, um, ReStar, uh,

20:30.160 --> 20:37.280
Shining Force, Shinobi 3, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, 3 Star Rage 2, and Strider, uh, the...

20:37.280 --> 20:43.080
Did anyone else have a very big, like, Keanu Reeves in the early Matrix movies, whoa, moment

20:43.080 --> 20:48.540
when the Genesis stuff is appearing, like, and maybe we're all desensitized to it now

20:48.540 --> 20:55.120
from Mario and Sonic the Olympics, but I mean, to see Sega Genesis is part of the enhanced

20:55.120 --> 21:00.440
Nintendo package, it, it definitely gave me a, whoa, kind of moment, like, damn.

21:00.440 --> 21:03.240
It would have given me a moment like that when I was 15.

21:03.240 --> 21:07.600
Right, like, well, like, like, go back, go back and show that footage to my 15-year-old

21:07.600 --> 21:12.600
self and see what happens, right, like, I come from the future, and guess what?

21:13.120 --> 21:17.080
Sega's gonna basically be a part of Nintendo's Plus subscription, it's, it's pretty wild.

21:17.080 --> 21:21.080
I would have had that reaction all up until about 2003.

21:21.080 --> 21:26.600
Yeah, so, I, I still think it's weird, it's, I'm not, like, surprised or something, it's

21:26.600 --> 21:28.600
just, it's like, oh, I wasn't expecting that.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.600
It's unexpected to your sensibilities.

21:30.600 --> 21:32.600
Yes, yes.

21:32.600 --> 21:37.600
They're also gonna be selling probably Impossible to get, um, wireless controllers for the N64

21:37.600 --> 21:42.600
and Sega Genesis, all for $50 each, but of course you have to be a member of.

21:42.600 --> 21:45.600
Maybe, maybe, I'm sorry, Logi, that's the part that did it.

21:45.600 --> 21:48.600
The Sega Genesis controller for my Nintendo system.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.600
That's, that's what broke me.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.600
That was the dot in Jeremy Bearimy.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.600
That was the part that broke me.

21:57.600 --> 21:58.600
Anyway.

21:58.600 --> 22:01.600
I have a big problem with this, of course.

22:01.600 --> 22:06.600
Um, I think I don't like the fact that this is gonna be an additional fee that I have

22:06.600 --> 22:12.600
to pay on top of the Nintendo online service, because honestly, I don't think it's worth

22:12.600 --> 22:13.600
it.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.600
It's not worth it for me to constantly pay for these.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.600
I'd rather just pay a flat fee for the collection.

22:18.600 --> 22:22.600
Hell, you can probably pay a flat fee for that collection of at least the Genesis games.

22:22.600 --> 22:25.600
Yeah, I was gonna say that Genesis, it's.

22:25.600 --> 22:26.600
Honestly.

22:26.600 --> 22:27.600
That collection exists.

22:27.600 --> 22:28.600
Yeah.

22:28.600 --> 22:34.600
Like, why don't they just create the Nintendo, those Nintendo classic collections, sell them

22:34.600 --> 22:39.600
for $60 much like they would with hardware, but just don't sell it with the hardware.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.600
Just have it as a collection.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.600
You buy it and it has the menu interface done.

22:43.600 --> 22:44.600
There you go.

22:44.600 --> 22:48.600
Because when they piecemealed it before everybody said they should do Netflix and now they're

22:48.600 --> 22:50.600
doing Netflix and everybody says go back to piecemeal.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.600
So like on that side.

22:52.600 --> 22:56.600
Because their Netflix service sucks because they don't have any titles on their Netflix

22:56.600 --> 22:57.600
services.

22:57.600 --> 22:58.600
The problem.

22:58.600 --> 23:01.600
You can't have Netflix if you don't have, if you have like 10 videos on there.

23:01.600 --> 23:04.600
Like you gotta have more content that's available on there.

23:04.600 --> 23:05.600
That's why people are complaining.

23:05.600 --> 23:08.600
It's like, hey, you haven't updated your service for a long time.

23:08.600 --> 23:10.600
Now we're like, we want more money to update our service.

23:10.600 --> 23:11.600
Well, what is.

23:11.600 --> 23:12.600
Sorry.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.600
What if.

23:13.600 --> 23:14.600
Hold on.

23:14.600 --> 23:15.600
I'm not.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.600
I'm only going to play like devil's advocate here for a second because I Loki for the most

23:17.600 --> 23:18.600
part.

23:18.600 --> 23:23.600
I'm also just kind of like, I probably just won't get it like unless it's really low cost

23:23.600 --> 23:25.600
like five bucks a month or less.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.600
And even then I'm still like, maybe I'll get it for the first two months and then get rid

23:28.600 --> 23:30.600
of it or not, not pay for it for a year.

23:30.600 --> 23:32.600
So like, I do agree with you.

23:32.600 --> 23:37.600
However, there's a part of this that makes me go, Hmm, because there is such an interesting

23:37.600 --> 23:40.600
strong lineup, especially on the Genesis side of things.

23:40.600 --> 23:46.600
What if the additional money is to try to lure more of those third party games they're

23:46.600 --> 23:51.600
missing onto the service by being able to provide additional money to those third party

23:51.600 --> 23:53.600
IP holders to fill in the gaps?

23:53.600 --> 23:57.600
You know, I speculate all day long about that and then pay them money and then have them

23:57.600 --> 23:58.600
do nothing.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.600
That's pretty much what you can expect with Nintendo.

24:00.600 --> 24:03.600
I mean, because I doubt that they're going to do any of that.

24:03.600 --> 24:06.600
They're going to put the minimal amount of effort into this.

24:06.600 --> 24:08.600
So cool.

24:08.600 --> 24:11.600
Lisa's four player multiplayer on the Nintendo 64.

24:11.600 --> 24:16.600
So that F zero four player F zero X four player multiplayer like fuck.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.600
Yeah, I'm here for it.

24:18.600 --> 24:23.600
It doesn't suck ass because, you know, their multiplayer, their online service needs help

24:23.600 --> 24:26.600
as it is the Super Nintendo and Nintendo one runs.

24:26.600 --> 24:27.600
All right.

24:27.600 --> 24:30.600
I've played it a lot, but I've played I've used it before and it ran fine.

24:30.600 --> 24:36.600
But yeah, I have I have problems with that, especially when we are not when they're not

24:36.600 --> 24:38.600
confirming a price yet.

24:38.600 --> 24:41.600
Yeah, I want to hear what the price is.

24:41.600 --> 24:44.600
They're probably like, OK, what do you guys suggest the price should be?

24:44.600 --> 24:48.600
You know, they're just trying to feel it out, which is.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.600
It's stupid, but whatever.

24:50.600 --> 24:53.600
OK, it is what it is.

24:53.600 --> 24:56.600
So other interesting announcements.

24:56.600 --> 25:01.600
So we knew that there was going to be the illumination Mario movie and we got announcements

25:01.600 --> 25:04.600
of the voice actors that are coming to that.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.600
Can we skip this part?

25:06.600 --> 25:07.600
Go ahead.

25:07.600 --> 25:08.600
I'm sorry.

25:08.600 --> 25:09.600
I'm just I'm here.

25:09.600 --> 25:10.600
I'm like.

25:10.600 --> 25:16.600
So we've got, you know, of course, Chris Pratt as Mario and it's the same.

25:16.600 --> 25:17.600
You know what?

25:17.600 --> 25:19.600
I actually I like that, actually.

25:19.600 --> 25:23.600
Chris Pratt was great in the other anime movies he's done, like the Lego movies and stuff.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.600
I think he'll be a great for this.

25:25.600 --> 25:30.600
I just don't want Chris Pratt to have any work, but I don't care for him as a person

25:30.600 --> 25:31.600
anymore either.

25:31.600 --> 25:35.600
If this was 10 years ago at the height of Park Heights of Parks and Rec, I might feel

25:35.600 --> 25:36.600
differently.

25:36.600 --> 25:41.600
But I also even if I were to put that aside, I kind of feel like he is everywhere right

25:41.600 --> 25:46.600
now. And it's just a little bit like the lazy choice to me.

25:46.600 --> 25:50.600
But I mean, the reality is like and I'm just going to say that I probably wasn't going

25:50.600 --> 25:54.600
to see the movie anyway because I just don't go to movies.

25:54.600 --> 25:58.600
I still haven't seen the Sonic movie and I like the Sonic voice cast.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.600
So it was great.

26:00.600 --> 26:01.600
Yeah, I just don't.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.600
I haven't even seen it yet.

26:03.600 --> 26:07.600
Yeah. And that's you know, so let me put it this way.

26:07.600 --> 26:11.600
This announcement is just not making me go, oh, shit, I can't wait to see it.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.600
I'm just like.

26:13.600 --> 26:16.600
They have Charlie Day as Luigi, which would be hilarious.

26:16.600 --> 26:23.600
Jack Black is Bowser, Seth Rogen doing Donkey Kong, Keegan Michael Key as Toad is going

26:23.600 --> 26:26.600
to be interesting.

26:26.600 --> 26:30.600
And then Charles Martinet is going to have other voice cameos in the movie as well.

26:30.600 --> 26:36.600
And then they've got some other folks doing some of the other roles in there as well.

26:36.600 --> 26:38.600
Can we talk about Charles Martinet for a minute?

26:38.600 --> 26:43.600
Because there's a lot of people that are very mad that he wasn't cast as Mario.

26:43.600 --> 26:48.600
Now, the one thing I did say a long time ago on this show was that he was he's not going

26:48.600 --> 26:49.600
to get the part of Mario.

26:49.600 --> 26:50.600
He was never going to.

26:50.600 --> 26:54.600
That is no disrespect to Mr. Martinet, who I think is a wonderful person and is a real

26:54.600 --> 26:59.600
delight at trade shows and has brought great personality to Mario.

26:59.600 --> 27:02.600
That's just not the way Hollywood works, unfortunately.

27:02.600 --> 27:08.600
Your faves that do things on TV or even on stage and Broadway rarely do the folks on

27:08.600 --> 27:12.600
stage on Broadway get cast in the movies.

27:12.600 --> 27:14.600
Look what's happening with Dear Evan Hansen right now.

27:14.600 --> 27:20.600
Like it's backfiring big time because that guy is too old to be playing that part.

27:20.600 --> 27:24.600
And it's kind of causing the movie to become a meme at this point.

27:24.600 --> 27:28.600
So, you know, Charles Martinet was never going to get the part of Mario.

27:28.600 --> 27:34.600
I think it's very nice that they're acknowledging and giving him a part in the movie after all.

27:34.600 --> 27:39.600
And I bet dimes to dollars he's going to play Mario's dad because that's the type of thing.

27:40.600 --> 27:46.600
Maybe Wario, but I'm going to guess they're going to stunt cast Wario for a sequel.

27:46.600 --> 27:52.600
So my guess is Mario's dad because like Mario's family outside of Luigi is something you've

27:52.600 --> 27:53.600
never seen.

27:53.600 --> 27:54.600
He's Waluigi.

27:54.600 --> 28:01.600
I just I think they save them for a sequel with with people I can't stand with Tom Cruise

28:01.600 --> 28:03.600
in the role or people I hate even more.

28:03.600 --> 28:10.600
So like it's just I think I think he'll play I think he'll play Mario's dad and it's going

28:10.600 --> 28:11.600
to be one of those.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.600
It'll be like Mario's dad is Dr. Mario.

28:13.600 --> 28:14.600
How about that?

28:14.600 --> 28:18.600
I'm going to spoil a 15 plus year old movie.

28:18.600 --> 28:23.600
Do you remember at the end of the South Park movie when Kenny finally took his hat off

28:23.600 --> 28:25.600
and got to say like one line?

28:25.600 --> 28:28.600
And I think they had somebody kind of epic voice, Kenny.

28:28.600 --> 28:29.600
Right.

28:29.600 --> 28:30.600
I don't remember.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.600
But anyway, it's going to be that.

28:32.600 --> 28:39.600
It's going to be like Charles Martinet gives two lines and it's Mario's dad.

28:39.600 --> 28:43.600
Bobby Black Wolf is bringing up something he brought up on his show tonight saying,

28:43.600 --> 28:47.600
I wouldn't want to listen to Martinet's Mario for an hour and a half.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.600
And I think that's a fair call out.

28:50.600 --> 28:53.600
Charles Martinet as Mario is very high pitched.

28:53.600 --> 28:54.600
It works for the games.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.600
But let me ask this question.

28:56.600 --> 29:01.600
Has Charles Martinet ever done a full voice Mario inside a game?

29:01.600 --> 29:03.600
I'm fully aware.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.600
Just phrases here and there.

29:05.600 --> 29:07.600
Yeah, just like has there ever been a game?

29:07.600 --> 29:11.600
Now, I know he has done full voices for Mario at trade shows, conventions.

29:11.600 --> 29:15.600
We all know that infamous Bobby Black Wolf bumper where he talks in Mario.

29:15.600 --> 29:17.600
And then I think in Wario on that show.

29:17.600 --> 29:20.600
And that was all I was there at E32.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.600
I just didn't think to get a bumper.

29:22.600 --> 29:23.600
Oh, no, because we cut the line.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.600
But that's another story.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.600
But there's that whole thing.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.600
And so, yes, I know he does the voice of those things.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.600
I don't think he's ever officially done more than like,

29:33.600 --> 29:35.600
wahoo, wahoo.

29:35.600 --> 29:38.600
Like he does those incidentals in the games.

29:38.600 --> 29:41.600
But I don't think he's ever done much more than that.

29:41.600 --> 29:44.600
So we don't really know what Charles Martinet's Mario sound like.

29:44.600 --> 29:48.600
And one other thing, he's not the first person to have the role.

29:48.600 --> 29:49.600
Hello, Captain Lou Albano.

29:49.600 --> 29:52.600
And Bobby actually also did an excellent job recapping.

29:52.600 --> 29:54.600
There's been Peter Cullen did the voice of Mario at one point.

29:54.600 --> 29:56.600
I'd forgot about that.

29:56.600 --> 30:00.600
So Charles Martinet doesn't own Mario, unfortunately.

30:00.600 --> 30:02.600
Love him, adore him.

30:02.600 --> 30:05.600
Glad he's involved in the movie in some capacity.

30:05.600 --> 30:07.600
He never was going to be Mario.

30:07.600 --> 30:11.600
I certainly would take him over what we're getting, but it is what it is.

30:11.600 --> 30:14.600
I would have rather seen Charlie Day get the Mario part, honestly.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.600
I don't hate him as Luigi.

30:17.600 --> 30:18.600
Anyway.

30:18.600 --> 30:19.600
Yeah.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.600
And then I was also going to mention that there's other announcements

30:22.600 --> 30:24.600
for different directs as well.

30:24.600 --> 30:29.600
So we have a tease of some content coming to Animal Crossing.

30:29.600 --> 30:33.600
So we're going to be getting Brewster's back in the museum.

30:33.600 --> 30:39.600
Finally, there's a direct coming as well towards the, I think, end of October.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.600
I definitely thought of Jamie when I saw that.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.600
And I thought of myself and a reason to go.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.600
I mean, to have to play again, my town again.

30:45.600 --> 30:49.600
I it looks it's sounding like it's going to be paid DLC, though.

30:49.600 --> 30:56.600
But if it's if it's comprehensive, I'm willing to, you know, I outside of this N64 thing,

30:56.600 --> 31:01.600
we've just been dragging Nintendo with when it comes to the DLC they put out for games

31:01.600 --> 31:04.600
because they spent a long time on Hyrule Warriors DLC, too.

31:04.600 --> 31:07.600
I think we just kind of were kind of played out on that, too.

31:07.600 --> 31:11.600
But like the DLC that Nintendo does is very strong.

31:11.600 --> 31:13.600
I don't think they ever let down with the DLC.

31:13.600 --> 31:18.600
So like I'm willing to kick 20 bucks because I feel like my 20 bucks for Animal Cross is going to get a lot.

31:18.600 --> 31:24.600
But anyway, I guess we'll find out when we get to that direct later on.

31:24.600 --> 31:31.600
Yeah. And then along with that, the last Smash Ultimate Fighter is going to be announced on October 5th at 7 a.m.

31:31.600 --> 31:36.600
Pacific Time is going to be the last Smash Direct that we have.

31:36.600 --> 31:40.600
So I look forward to that.

31:40.600 --> 31:45.600
I did like that they acknowledge that because I think there were a lot of people going.

31:45.600 --> 31:49.600
That was the other big rumor for this direct is that people were like, oh, it's about that time.

31:49.600 --> 31:52.600
This is going to be the last Smash reveal.

31:52.600 --> 31:56.600
So they were very smart to say, not today, but here's the day.

31:56.600 --> 31:59.600
So at least they kind of threw them a bone on that.

31:59.600 --> 32:03.600
Yeah. So that'll be coming soon.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.600
That's pretty much it.

32:05.600 --> 32:11.600
SSJ100Matt in chat says the last Smash character is going to upset folks no matter who it is.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.600
Guaranteed. Bet on it.

32:13.600 --> 32:16.600
You can count on that 100 percent.

32:16.600 --> 32:19.600
Especially if it's another.

32:19.600 --> 32:21.600
Oh, gosh.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.600
I remember the Fire Emblem.

32:23.600 --> 32:26.600
Yeah, it's another Fire Emblem character.

32:26.600 --> 32:28.600
I'm just crazy.

32:28.600 --> 32:35.600
I'll ask because I have to like what realistically like I really want you to put on your we've been talking about video games for nearly 20 years.

32:35.600 --> 32:45.600
Hat. What do you realistically think is the last Smash Brothers DLC character?

32:45.600 --> 32:51.600
I don't even know.

32:51.600 --> 32:54.600
It's the Guardian, the Guardian.

32:54.600 --> 32:58.600
I don't that doesn't sound that sounds wishful, not that.

32:58.600 --> 33:02.600
Yeah, that was just me saying what I wanted to say.

33:02.600 --> 33:05.600
I'll go with my I'm really torn between two.

33:05.600 --> 33:08.600
I think there is a serious chance it's Waluigi.

33:08.600 --> 33:11.600
I do not think that's off the table.

33:11.600 --> 33:16.600
I think that's there's there is a chance I'm going to give you that whole Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber.

33:16.600 --> 33:19.600
Or was that the other guy? Anyway, there is a chance.

33:19.600 --> 33:25.600
I also I also think there is a very real possibility.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.600
It's a major Microsoft character.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.600
I mean, Master Chief.

33:29.600 --> 33:32.600
Master Chef. Master Chef.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.600
Why not? We got Minecraft Steve.

33:35.600 --> 33:41.600
We got Banjo Kazooie. Master Chief definitely seems like the way to where they can fire off characters.

33:41.600 --> 33:44.600
And that's going to be the one that pisses off the Nintendo fans the most. Just wait.

33:44.600 --> 33:48.600
So I and yes, I'm not this is not wishful.

33:48.600 --> 33:54.600
You know, again, if I wanted if I was going to say who I wanted, I'd go along with Dark Soccer is saying I want the dude from Actraiser.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.600
I want God.

33:56.600 --> 34:00.600
No, I want God. And you know, well, because you play God in Actraiser.

34:00.600 --> 34:03.600
So I want God to be the last DLC, but it's not going to happen.

34:03.600 --> 34:08.600
It's more like you're playing as an avatar. But yeah.

34:08.600 --> 34:14.600
All right. Loki, you're not going to put anything out there.

34:14.600 --> 34:21.600
I don't know. Let's see.

34:21.600 --> 34:22.600
I'm looking in chat.

34:22.600 --> 34:27.600
Orange right says Rayman. I think that's a very well thought out answer.

34:27.600 --> 34:32.600
Yes. Let's let's do Rayman. It's going to be a rabid.

34:32.600 --> 34:39.600
I am terrible. I could see it. I mean.

34:39.600 --> 34:45.600
Yeah, if it's a rabid, then everybody could say, how about, you know, let's support Ubisoft and all of their sexism.

34:45.600 --> 34:48.600
Yay. The squid kids are in there, right?

34:48.600 --> 34:53.600
Yeah. And the Pikmin, you have the doctor guy that has all the Pikmin. So it's just going to be Brewster.

34:53.600 --> 35:01.600
OK, he's going to come out there and drink coffee. And anyone who tries to touch his coffee siphon gets kicked in the face.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.600
That would be what I would be with my coffee.

35:03.600 --> 35:07.600
Dark Tetsuya wanted to bring up from the direct and chat, saying one last thought on the direct.

35:07.600 --> 35:12.600
I was legit shocked to see Shadowrun Trilogy in the sizzle reel.

35:12.600 --> 35:16.600
My wife has been wanting a port of that for years. Oh, yeah. Good call. That was a good.

35:16.600 --> 35:21.600
Yeah. We're kind of leaving out some stuff from sizzle reels and stuff. But yeah, that was a neat thing to see.

35:21.600 --> 35:27.600
I was also very interested in that card tabletop looking RPG game that Square Enix is doing.

35:27.600 --> 35:33.600
When they started showing the cards, I was like, oh, my God, are we getting cold set to like, is this really like the best?

35:34.600 --> 35:41.600
I the Isle Dragon roars.

35:41.600 --> 35:45.600
So anything else on the direct, Loki?

35:45.600 --> 35:49.600
I mean, that was a lot of the the stuff that I want on the cover, basically.

35:49.600 --> 35:59.600
I mean, there is other stuff like Disco Elysium, the final cut and stuff. I'm sure there's more ports of different games coming to the switch as well.

35:59.600 --> 36:03.600
I don't know. I'm excited about the movie, even though it comes out next year, next holiday.

36:03.600 --> 36:10.600
So I'm looking forward to a trailer. Hopefully get that pretty soon.

36:10.600 --> 36:19.600
I'm I'm hopeful for it. Like Detective Pikachu was like something that sounded like it would be really like like really in live action with Pikachu.

36:19.600 --> 36:22.600
And that was an excellent movie, like such an excellent movie.

36:22.600 --> 36:26.600
So like, I'm hopeful. Illumination does good work.

36:26.600 --> 36:29.600
I'm I'm very hopeful to see something.

36:29.600 --> 36:32.600
Let me toss it to chat real quick. Is there anything else in the direct?

36:32.600 --> 36:36.600
Kind of like what Dark Tetsuya said that we missed that you want to bring up in chat?

36:36.600 --> 36:38.600
Because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.600
Twitch dot TV slash vog network.

36:40.600 --> 36:44.600
If there was anything else that caught your eye in the direct that you wanted to share with us.

36:44.600 --> 36:48.600
Still some chat on that final smash character.

36:48.600 --> 36:51.600
Tiger Claus saying, what about the dude from the recent Yakuza game?

36:51.600 --> 36:54.600
I just don't see it because that series doesn't really exist on switch.

36:54.600 --> 37:01.600
I know that didn't stop other things from showing up, but I just I just don't see that one appearing.

37:01.600 --> 37:06.600
As much as we get Master Chief, I could see a major PlayStation icon showing up.

37:06.600 --> 37:09.600
But we also kind of got that with guy.

37:09.600 --> 37:13.600
Doom guy. I mean, maybe.

37:13.600 --> 37:16.600
Crash Bandicoot says Bobby Black Wolf.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.600
Oh, come on. You know, Tony.

37:18.600 --> 37:23.600
Well, I mean, that is Activision, but I can say, you know, Tony doesn't play ball like that.

37:23.600 --> 37:26.600
But for Spyro, I could Spyro.

37:26.600 --> 37:28.600
No one knows who Spyro is anymore.

37:28.600 --> 37:31.600
Skylanders Skylanders.

37:31.600 --> 37:36.600
Skylanders. They know what Skylander is because they melt that to its dead.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.600
It's like everything else.

37:38.600 --> 37:42.600
Unfortunately, so far, though, the only teeth that hasn't dried up is the Call of Duty teeth.

37:42.600 --> 37:45.600
So, you know, that'll be going on forever.

37:45.600 --> 37:48.600
Some nice stale milk there. Yeah.

37:48.600 --> 37:56.600
E3VL says Emmy MMI to promote to promote Metroid Dread, which comes out three days after.

37:56.600 --> 38:04.600
I get that from the corporate synergy angle and your logic in getting to that conclusion makes absolute sense.

38:04.600 --> 38:08.600
That being said, oh, the backlash to that would be massive.

38:08.600 --> 38:12.600
I just don't I just feel like the expectations are higher.

38:12.600 --> 38:15.600
It also mentioned that the OLED switch is coming out on the eighth as well.

38:15.600 --> 38:19.600
That's only two weeks away. Oh, I'll never be able to get that. Good call.

38:19.600 --> 38:23.600
What if we got, I guess, the last character, just a Ness?

38:23.600 --> 38:26.600
And I don't mean the the boy from Earthbound.

38:26.600 --> 38:30.600
Like, I mean something like Rob the robot, but it's a Ness.

38:30.600 --> 38:34.600
I could see it'd be like fighting the car in Daytona in Fighters Megamix.

38:34.600 --> 38:37.600
Why not? I could see it.

38:37.600 --> 38:42.600
All right. Can someone port Salty Bet to the switch, please?

38:42.600 --> 38:45.600
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I want it to be Sakurai himself.

38:45.600 --> 38:53.600
I would love that, actually, but I see them more doing like an official me pack for that.

38:53.600 --> 38:56.600
I think that we wanted Reggie at one time to be in Smash Brothers.

38:56.600 --> 39:00.600
I would be well, and through the Mies, I think people have kind of done that.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.600
So, yeah. All right. Let's move on.

39:02.600 --> 39:06.600
Let's talk about the types of games that we have been playing this week, whether it's Smash or something else.

39:06.600 --> 39:09.600
How was your gaming week? And we'll start with Loki.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.600
How was your gaming week? I'm sorry.

39:11.600 --> 39:14.600
Wait was all right. I did it out of order on accident.

39:14.600 --> 39:17.600
Sorry, Loki. Go ahead. And then we'll go back to Jamie.

39:17.600 --> 39:21.600
It's because the order of the cameras is off tonight.

39:21.600 --> 39:26.600
Go ahead. So I actually did play something other than Minecraft this week.

39:26.600 --> 39:32.600
I played I played several hours of power wash simulator.

39:32.600 --> 39:36.600
I've been watching you on Discord. I see that you're playing that.

39:36.600 --> 39:39.600
And I'm like, oh, I need to get that game. I really do.

39:39.600 --> 39:42.600
It's pretty fun. It's just it's a good game.

39:42.600 --> 39:47.600
Like after work, like when I'm just like brain dead from just the boredom of work.

39:47.600 --> 39:53.600
It's a good kind of like buffer game between that and actually like having to think for like Minecraft.

39:53.600 --> 39:58.600
It's just it's just mindless. I mean, it's really what it is.

39:58.600 --> 40:03.600
But yeah, it's fun. I have been enjoying it quite a bit.

40:03.600 --> 40:06.600
So, yeah, I've been playing that. And then, of course, Minecraft.

40:06.600 --> 40:10.600
So working on stuff for that started designing the megabase stuff.

40:10.600 --> 40:14.600
So I've been doing that and fighting with a custom design for a redstone elevator.

40:14.600 --> 40:17.600
So those are a lot more complicated than I thought.

40:17.600 --> 40:24.600
So I started filming parts of it this morning and then I'm going to be building stuff and filming the rest of it.

40:24.600 --> 40:28.600
Hopefully, but not an episode middle of this week. So look for that.

40:28.600 --> 40:31.600
Oh, I did put out a short earlier this week as well.

40:31.600 --> 40:36.600
Really only pertains to anybody that watches like her spacecraft and like last life stuff.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.600
Now, there's a like a meme that's kind of part of that.

40:39.600 --> 40:44.600
And I made a data pack for Minecraft for, you know, trying to capitalize on those views and stuff.

40:44.600 --> 40:48.600
But no one cares. So.

40:48.600 --> 40:54.600
That's it. I'm with or I'm sorry, Tiger Claw in chat says you guys should try gas station simulator.

40:54.600 --> 40:58.600
And I'm with the three. What what what are you simulating in that?

40:58.600 --> 41:04.600
You run a gas station, but it's also like crime because like there's a story that goes along with that.

41:04.600 --> 41:07.600
I watched there's a channel I watch called Let's Game It Out.

41:07.600 --> 41:10.600
It's a guy that plays games like I do, where he tries to break them.

41:10.600 --> 41:17.600
And he's hilarious. But so with that, though, there is like a storyline.

41:17.600 --> 41:23.600
You start you get this like gas station. You buy it, I guess is your uncle's gas station or something like that.

41:23.600 --> 41:27.600
And you kind of fix it up and then you kind of run it.

41:27.600 --> 41:30.600
But then at the same time, you also can do like crime.

41:30.600 --> 41:35.600
So I guess you're like gun running or like front for like drug running or something like that.

41:35.600 --> 41:41.600
So it's a little bit crime sim, a little bit of like I don't know.

41:41.600 --> 41:45.600
There's like mafia in it and stuff. It's weird, but it's a fun sim game.

41:45.600 --> 41:50.600
You get to just run stuff, check people out, you know, fix cars.

41:50.600 --> 41:57.600
You can pump gas design stuff. I don't know. People like those Sims.

41:57.600 --> 42:01.600
Huh. All right. Yeah, it sounds interesting. I'll check it out.

42:01.600 --> 42:05.600
All right. So that's it for your gaming week, Dark Sakura. How was your gaming week?

42:05.600 --> 42:10.600
I played Fantasian and I played Dead by Daylight.

42:10.600 --> 42:19.600
And I I've also decided, though, that for tomorrow, when I do my marathon, my break game is going to be Final Fantasy 14.

42:19.600 --> 42:28.600
Oh, nice. OK. Yeah. You know, just like in between, you know, murdering people, survivors, you know.

42:28.600 --> 42:34.600
I also did play a little bit of pinball. My World Cup soccer is home.

42:35.600 --> 42:40.600
We got our Dan finally put the color DMD in it and she looks gorgeous.

42:40.600 --> 42:45.600
I'm going to put a video up on TikTok later. Yeah, I want to see that color display.

42:45.600 --> 42:50.600
I bet it's a beautiful thing for that table. Well, maybe I'll post it during the show.

42:50.600 --> 42:54.600
Fun. All right. Well, that's it for your gaming week. Then I'll get to my gaming week.

42:54.600 --> 42:58.600
I actually had a pretty busy gaming week, so I actually took some notes on what I played this week.

42:58.600 --> 43:03.600
I did play some of my usual stuff, some of the stuff that Jamie just mentioned. Final Fantasy 14.

43:03.600 --> 43:08.600
Still working my way up to all my jobs being 80 before and Walker.

43:08.600 --> 43:13.600
And I've also been playing Dead by Daylight here and there just a little bit. Nothing too exciting going on in that game.

43:13.600 --> 43:17.600
Just trying to build out more of my characters. I ran some killers pretty good today, though.

43:17.600 --> 43:23.600
I'm getting better at it. And I played No Man's Sky. Of course, I could play that game a lot.

43:23.600 --> 43:30.600
I started a new game because why not? I wanted to do one where I could redeem my twitch stuff and the.

43:30.600 --> 43:36.600
Excuse me, the stuff I got from expeditions, I wanted to do that like early on in the my save.

43:36.600 --> 43:42.600
So I was just randomly doing that earlier in the week, but then my play on that just kind of got derailed because,

43:42.600 --> 43:47.600
of course, the Nintendo Direct happened. And so I've been playing all this other stuff, too.

43:47.600 --> 43:51.600
One thing I should mention, actually, before the Nintendo Direct, I did get WarioWare.

43:51.600 --> 43:56.600
So I mentioned I was going to I didn't get it last week. I did get it this week.

43:56.600 --> 44:00.600
And so I actually did play through a little bit of it where, you know, I'm unlocking some of the characters.

44:00.600 --> 44:05.600
I got to the Nintendo Classics level. That's always the one I want to see in a WarioWare game.

44:05.600 --> 44:11.600
And yeah, I mean, I enjoy it. It's I think the twist that the new characters put on it is interesting.

44:11.600 --> 44:17.600
I think it's a fair criticism to say some of them are pretty same Z like I think Mona,

44:17.600 --> 44:22.600
who kind of just is like nonstop movement and is the eight bit is also nonstop move.

44:22.600 --> 44:25.600
It's kind of the same gimmick. So some of them are a little same Z.

44:25.600 --> 44:30.600
But otherwise, I kind of like how it changes the mini game a little bit when you have different characters.

44:30.600 --> 44:35.600
And I like how not all of them necessarily make sense as well for the mini games.

44:35.600 --> 44:40.600
So you really have to think and it makes you kind of think a little bit faster in that regard.

44:40.600 --> 44:45.600
So, yeah, I I dig the new WarioWare. I've been having a good time checking that out.

44:45.600 --> 44:51.600
I was making good progress on that. But then the Nintendo Direct happened and there were a couple of games I had to get from that.

44:51.600 --> 44:57.600
So, of course, one of them was Actraiser Renaissance. I was on that within minutes.

44:57.600 --> 45:04.600
And I started playing the game. And right as I'm starting to play the first level, I'm noticing there's performance issues in this.

45:04.600 --> 45:13.600
And it instantly made me regret getting it on Switch when I realized it had also released on PlayStation 4 and PC.

45:13.600 --> 45:19.600
And that's exactly why they make those deals to be in the Nintendo Direct and things like that,

45:19.600 --> 45:24.600
because it's exactly what I fell for and I should know better at this point.

45:24.600 --> 45:30.600
I, I saw the thing in the Nintendo Direct and I need to have that right now.

45:30.600 --> 45:35.600
Oh, it's on the store today. I'm going to go get it. And I didn't even think, is it out on other stores, too?

45:35.600 --> 45:37.600
Because a lot of things like this is is cross platform.

45:37.600 --> 45:44.600
Now, the performance issues weren't a like game ruiner for me, but it was something I noticed.

45:44.600 --> 45:50.600
And I was like, God damn it. You know, it's just something that was kind of like a little bit of a setback.

45:50.600 --> 45:57.600
Otherwise, the music was apparently kind of remastered by Yuzo Koshiro himself. The music sounds great.

45:57.600 --> 46:05.600
There's a lot of little touches that really feel like the old Actraiser game. That's really cool.

46:05.600 --> 46:10.600
I like that they've decided to expand on the story a little bit.

46:10.600 --> 46:16.600
I guess they don't feel as confined to some of those, you know, simple text boxes that the original had.

46:16.600 --> 46:23.600
And they're they're kind of fleshing out like when another character kind of a special character starts wandering around the town.

46:23.600 --> 46:31.600
They kind of flesh that out into its own thing. And I noticed the story is very it's a lot more.

46:31.600 --> 46:38.600
It gets a lot more deeper on the whole, like, why are you helping people that can't help themselves?

46:38.600 --> 46:45.600
And it gets these very deep sort of like topics, you know, theological things that, you know, I don't know if I want to get into on OLR,

46:45.600 --> 46:48.600
but because that's a touchy subject for a lot of people.

46:48.600 --> 46:55.600
But depending on what your perspective is on all that, you might see some different things in the story that I didn't really notice before.

46:55.600 --> 47:02.600
Well, because they changed it. On the not so great side, well mixed.

47:02.600 --> 47:06.600
They've done things to make the game longer, which is fine.

47:06.600 --> 47:10.600
I mean, because the original game, you could be in one sitting if you were dedicated.

47:10.600 --> 47:14.600
It only took a few hours to get through. So you decided to make the game longer.

47:14.600 --> 47:19.600
For example, your townspeople no longer seal off monster layers by themselves.

47:19.600 --> 47:27.600
You have to go into the monster layers and do a much shorter action segment to actually seal them off.

47:27.600 --> 47:30.600
OK, I'm all right with that. It's it's interesting.

47:30.600 --> 47:32.600
Kind of gives a little how dare the people not do something for themselves.

47:32.600 --> 47:35.600
I know. Well, that's that's a big part of the story.

47:35.600 --> 47:41.600
So it's very interesting, sort of like you're waiting for God to fix all your problems.

47:41.600 --> 47:44.600
Why can't you fix your own problems when God gives you the tools to do it?

47:44.600 --> 47:47.600
This is very how it should be. Well, yeah.

47:47.600 --> 47:52.600
And that's that's and that's if you you know, not that anyone asked for my take on religion, but that's kind of what it is.

47:52.600 --> 47:55.600
God isn't going to fix our problems. God gives you the tools to do it.

47:55.600 --> 48:02.600
But anyway, I'm not going to get to do that. But I think it's interesting how the story kind of gets into that.

48:02.600 --> 48:07.600
So that part I'm OK with. What I'm less OK with is that they decided to.

48:07.600 --> 48:16.600
All right. If we're going to have an action genre and a sim genre, let's throw in a tower defense genre to to enhance the sim game.

48:16.600 --> 48:21.600
I don't think that lands so well. It kind of artificially makes the game longer.

48:21.600 --> 48:27.600
It's not something I signed up for as a part of Actraiser. Doesn't really have a lot of depth to it.

48:27.600 --> 48:32.600
I was really disappointed to see them kind of futz with the game's formulas by putting in this tower defense game.

48:32.600 --> 48:37.600
It's unavoidable. I really wish they had made that.

48:37.600 --> 48:42.600
I mean, you could like take it all the way down to the easiest level and it probably is not going to be a problem or anything.

48:42.600 --> 48:49.600
But I just wish that they would have made a version of the game that really is just a remaster of the original.

48:50.600 --> 48:55.600
And not necessarily added in extra gameplay mechanics that weren't even a part of the original game.

48:55.600 --> 49:00.600
That landed a little bit disappointing for me, unfortunately.

49:00.600 --> 49:06.600
Otherwise, what else was I going to say with that?

49:06.600 --> 49:13.600
I didn't I don't walk away from the game feeling negative. I do feel over. I do feel overall it's pretty positive.

49:13.600 --> 49:19.600
But yeah, that was just a thing that made me go, I wish I wish they wouldn't kind of throw off the balance of the remaster like that.

49:19.600 --> 49:25.600
You know, it's not the same thing. You know, I think back to like what were like some great remasters that have happened.

49:25.600 --> 49:31.600
I think like Wonder Boy, the Dragon's Trap is one of the best ones. It's just the same game.

49:31.600 --> 49:35.600
But now it's on the widescreen. You can hit a button to flip back and forth between old new graphics.

49:35.600 --> 49:40.600
It looks it looks great and all that. I would have rather instead of them adding this whole tower defense thing into it,

49:40.600 --> 49:47.600
that they would have added new areas, just expand the world instead of six stages, give us eight stages or whatever.

49:47.600 --> 49:55.600
I would have rather seen the game go that direction instead of kind of a little more artificially making the game a little bit longer.

49:55.600 --> 50:00.600
But at the end of the day, maybe they'll fix that. I don't know. I guess they could always patch it or something. Who knows?

50:00.600 --> 50:06.600
But at the end of the day, I do think, you know, I love Actraiser. And so as a fan of the game, I was very happy to see it.

50:06.600 --> 50:16.600
This game exists. And I don't regret spending money on it because I want to support this idea that Quinten is going to go back and remaster old games.

50:16.600 --> 50:27.600
But if they do remaster the Soul Blazer trilogy, please, please don't do what you did here and add new things just for the sake of new game mechanics.

50:27.600 --> 50:35.600
Like please keep the game what it was with maybe a bonus dungeon or something like that. That would be much better.

50:35.600 --> 50:40.600
Dartusy in chat says, oh, yeah, Dragon's Trap was great. It also had FM remixes of the SMS music.

50:40.600 --> 50:49.600
Yeah. Another, you know, another remaster that I think did the new stuff very well, Blaster Master Zero, I think is an incredible remaster.

50:49.600 --> 50:57.600
And yeah, they went a slightly different direction from the base game, but I think all of it still stuck to what the game was.

50:57.600 --> 51:03.600
And I think and it's exceeded so well. They've done a part two and a part three, which aren't even now.

51:03.600 --> 51:08.600
It's like its own thing. It's like not even canon to the original game technically. But I think it's really rad with that.

51:08.600 --> 51:17.600
I think that's also a benchmark for what remaster should be, is the Blaster Master Zero franchise. So, you know, that's all.

51:17.600 --> 51:25.600
OK, one other game I checked out this week was the Castlevania collection. This time I didn't buy that right away.

51:25.600 --> 51:29.600
I actually waited because I was so into the Actraiser thing. I think I waited till the next day.

51:29.600 --> 51:37.600
And so I actually went to pot. And I think because of the performance thing that happened to me on the switch, that's why I got it on Xbox.

51:37.600 --> 51:44.600
I would have got it on PS5 if I had a PS5, but I just since I have a Series X, I went for Xbox.

51:44.600 --> 51:51.600
And I got to say that collection turned out very well. I played a little bit of Dracula X and I played a little bit of.

51:51.600 --> 52:00.600
The first I can't remember all the names now, the first advance game, I played a little bit of that because I remember when those games were newer,

52:00.600 --> 52:06.600
I keep wanting to say Castle of Illusion, but that's the Disney game. But thank you.

52:06.600 --> 52:12.600
Circle of the Moon. Thank you, Jade. Sacred Jade in chat. I played a little bit of that one.

52:12.600 --> 52:17.600
That is a hard fucking game. I got murdered by that first boss pretty quick. That was irritating.

52:17.600 --> 52:24.600
But otherwise, I'm having a good time with it. And I played a little bit of a Dracula X. It plays great on the big screen.

52:24.600 --> 52:33.600
I have to say, I like some of the things that Konami or I guess maybe M2 really did to kind of enhance the games with like the fact that you can save anywhere.

52:33.600 --> 52:39.600
I mean, it basically is that earlier Castlevania collection with different games. It's that. But it worked out very well.

52:39.600 --> 52:47.600
And I'm a fan. I think I think if you enjoy those Castlevania games, it's been a while since you visited the advance games like myself.

52:47.600 --> 52:55.600
I hear Aria of Sorrow is a terrific game. And from what I remember, what little I played of it, it was. I can't wait to get there.

52:55.600 --> 53:03.600
So there's a lot of value. And I think the collection was only $19.99, maybe $29.99. I don't think it was. I think it was $19.99.

53:03.600 --> 53:08.600
Somebody in chat might correct me on the price, but I think it was only 20 bucks. And that's a pretty good value.

53:09.600 --> 53:12.600
Thank you. Sacred Jade said it was 20 bucks. Thank you.

53:12.600 --> 53:17.600
And like Dark Sakura said, it has Dracula X. That was a huge surprise and a nice thing to see in there.

53:17.600 --> 53:23.600
And you can switch between region releases. They briefly mentioned that in the trailer, but I think that is a really cool addition.

53:23.600 --> 53:30.600
So if you want to play the Japanese version of any of those games or the European version now of any of those games, you can easily switch on the main menu.

53:30.600 --> 53:36.600
So I thought that was really great. So yeah, I recommend the Castlevania Advance Collection. It's great.

53:36.600 --> 53:45.600
No performance issues on Xbox, except I absolutely have to use that D-pad on my Series X. Thank God they redid the Series X D-pad.

53:45.600 --> 53:52.600
Works so much nicer when you have to do like a double tap to run. Works much better than using the nub.

53:52.600 --> 53:58.600
So that was my gaming week. There was a lot. Sorry, but some new stuff and some things to get into.

53:58.600 --> 54:02.600
So yeah, obviously I was very excited about the ActRaiser thing and all that.

54:02.600 --> 54:10.600
And you know I'm going to be all over that ChocoboGP or whatever, the Chocobo Racing 2, whatever they ended up calling it in 2022, whenever that actually was.

54:10.600 --> 54:11.600
It's ChocoboGP.

54:11.600 --> 54:18.600
I know, it's Chocobo Racing 2 to me. All right, let's move on. We've got some more news for you guys.

54:18.600 --> 54:25.600
Oh, actually, before we get into that, Pod Culture in Chat mentions my gaming week, Diablo 2.

54:26.600 --> 54:34.600
I mentioned last week I was having a little bit of an ethical conundrum on I want to support certain people that made the game.

54:34.600 --> 54:38.600
I want to support the frontline workers. I don't want to support Bobby Kotick.

54:38.600 --> 54:51.600
What I decided to do is that I am going to buy the game, but I'm going to buy it next month because the higher ups love to tout the sales the first week, the first month sales and all that stuff.

54:51.600 --> 54:57.600
That's the stuff that's important to them, so I will not be a figure in that, and I'm going to buy it in October.

54:57.600 --> 55:02.600
And that's my choice, and whatever choice you landed on is your choice, and that is perfectly fine.

55:02.600 --> 55:05.600
You know all the cards on the table.

55:05.600 --> 55:09.600
And there are a few more cards as of this week, aren't there, Loki?

55:10.600 --> 55:25.600
Yep. So, you know, because they still haven't agreed to or even considered the wants of their employees, the US government now is investigating Activision Blizzard.

55:25.600 --> 55:35.600
The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched their investigation, and they've also subpoenaed Bobby Kotick to see what exactly he knew and when.

55:35.600 --> 55:47.600
Apparently, the company is cooperating with the SEC according to Activision, or I'm sorry, Helene Klasky, who is the Activision spokesperson.

55:47.600 --> 56:10.600
And yeah, this is just kind of escalating after basically hearing the news that I guess they're still at their union busting activities, and they're still not following the guidance that the SEC has told them to follow.

56:11.600 --> 56:17.600
And so, you know, they'll get down to the bottom of it, one way or the other.

56:17.600 --> 56:20.600
Along with that, though, the chief legal officer...

56:20.600 --> 56:24.600
Sorry, quickly about the Bobby Kotick subpoena, all I have to say is good.

56:24.600 --> 56:34.600
Like, I don't want to say I'm excited for this because it should have never gotten to this, but be that as it may, since we are in this scenario,

56:34.600 --> 56:45.600
and the responses of the Blizzard employees have still not been responded to, then I think the government is finally doing something right.

56:45.600 --> 56:50.600
And it's a rush to see, and I really hope it's televised, and I hope I get to see it.

56:50.600 --> 56:59.600
And quite frankly, I feel like emailing my representatives and providing some questions that I would like to see answered.

56:59.600 --> 57:06.600
I'm only kind of disappointed they're not bringing in Yves Guillemin, too. I don't know if you get into weird things because the French...

57:06.600 --> 57:12.600
Yeah, I know, it's like a French... But I mean, it's probably a little more complicated, so I'm willing to kind of...

57:12.600 --> 57:21.600
But I would have liked to have seen him come in, too, but I'm glad that one of the faces of the industry is going to finally have to respond to this.

57:21.600 --> 57:26.600
Ubisoft still has, like, offices in the United States.

57:26.600 --> 57:36.600
I know, that's why I feel like he should be... He should be subpoenable, or if not, then they should have somebody who's over the US division, and that person should be subpoenable.

57:36.600 --> 57:43.600
I just want to see Katie Porter and her whiteboard show up. That is all I want from this.

57:43.600 --> 57:50.600
And by the way, Katie Porter is from Southern California. I don't know if she represents Irvine's district, but she's really fucking close.

57:50.600 --> 58:00.600
So I would be fucking thrilled if that makes an appearance, because I want her to ask Bobby Kotick a question that she's asked a lot of people that have been dragged up there.

58:00.600 --> 58:06.600
What have you done to earn your bonuses that you're getting with all of this that's going on behind the scenes?

58:06.600 --> 58:11.600
I just want this. What have you done?

58:11.600 --> 58:12.600
Period.

58:12.600 --> 58:14.600
Period.

58:14.600 --> 58:25.600
What I want to email my representatives, and I encourage all of you to do this, go to that... Oh God, I'm so embarrassed because I don't remember the Twitter account in the moment.

58:25.600 --> 58:30.600
I think it's abk is the account. Somebody can correct me on that if I'm wrong.

58:30.600 --> 58:34.600
That's the employees and their questions and all that stuff.

58:34.600 --> 58:43.600
Since Bobby Kotick will not respond to the employees this way, I want the folks on Capitol Hill to ask the questions.

58:43.600 --> 58:50.600
Why won't you respond to your employees on these issues? So ask them in front of the entire public.

58:50.600 --> 58:53.600
Thank you, Mike Deft. A better abk.

58:53.600 --> 58:59.600
I hate that it's come to this, but I'm so happy it's happening.

58:59.600 --> 59:02.600
I'm glad something's been being done.

59:02.600 --> 59:11.600
So one company down, you know, hopefully there's actual... something actually comes of this.

59:11.600 --> 59:17.600
One thing that did come of this so far is that their chief legal officer has quit amid the lawsuit.

59:17.600 --> 59:25.600
So Claire Hart has resigned from the company as of Friday, September 17th via her LinkedIn post.

59:25.600 --> 59:33.600
She announced that no plans on necessarily where she's going to move to, but taking a break from the craziness.

59:33.600 --> 59:38.600
So does... Let me ask this question. Does anyone blame her?

59:38.600 --> 59:39.600
No.

59:39.600 --> 59:40.600
Crickets.

59:40.600 --> 59:47.600
It's probably a really awkward place to be, especially if you're defending a company and what they've done.

59:47.600 --> 59:49.600
It's like, eh.

59:49.600 --> 59:50.600
Yeah.

59:50.600 --> 59:54.600
Ethical conundrum there.

59:54.600 --> 01:00:04.600
I don't want to see this end in like the fall of Blizzard because I know several people that work there who are wonderful and I don't want to see them impacted.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:09.600
But what I do want this... I want it to be the fall of Bobby Kotick, to be quite frank.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:14.600
And I do want to see more new folks that rise to the top.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.600
I want to see accountability.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:17.600
Yes.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.600
Good way to put that succinctly.

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.600
That's what I want.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:21.600
I want accountability.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.600
I don't want to see the company close.

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.600
That would be horrible.

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:29.600
There's too many creative people and too many talented people for this to close.

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.600
I mean, sure, they'd probably all end up somewhere else in the industry.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.600
I don't want them to have to go through that.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.600
Isn't this enough?

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:37.600
We need integrity and accountability.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.600
Yes.

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:42.600
And so I hope they bring some of that on the table with Bobby Kotick.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.600
Now, some valid concerns in chat.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:54.600
SSJ 100 Matt in chat says, I'm just worried that Kotick's lawyers are going to file countless injunctions so that he doesn't have to answer questions for a while.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.600
You're going to answer for it eventually, Bobby.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:03.600
So the longer that that they put it off, the worse it's going to be.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:04.600
Bingo.

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.600
Bingo.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:12.600
As my mama used to tell me when she'd ask me to tell the truth, if I did something wrong.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:23.600
As as an old boss many years ago with another company, I worked at used to tell me either you're going to pay for it on the front end or you pay for it on the back end.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.600
There it is.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:29.600
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I just thought Rob was yelling at me that I was going to have to answer.

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.600
Yes, Bobby Black Wolf.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:31.600
Get in front.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:34.600
No, I think Bobby Black Wolf should ask the questions.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.600
Quite frankly, Bobby versus Bobby.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:37.600
Let's do it.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.600
All right.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.600
Bobby on Bobby.

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.600
All right.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:43.600
Moving on.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:49.600
Let's get to our next story, which has to do with other retro dealings on the switch.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:58.600
This is outside of the Nintendo 64 and Genesis stuff we were earlier talking about, because some people are saying, well, this must be the end of NES and Super Nintendo, right?

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:05.600
Because, I mean, the well's been looking pretty dry over there with some of the recent releases have not been exactly thrilling.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:11.600
But Nintendo did confirm there are still plans to release more NES and Super Nintendo games.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.600
We don't know what they are, but just that there are plans.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:22.600
To remind you, we got such recent great releases like Claymates, Bamboozle, and Jelly Boy.

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:24.600
I remember one of those games.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:30.600
But there will be more stuff coming soon.

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:33.600
A lot of people are saying Earthbound?

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.600
And I agree.

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:42.600
Earthbound would be one I would have thought we would just see out of encouragement to renew for another year by now.

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:47.600
Super Mario RPG, of course, is like the Super Nintendo game everybody's...

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:56.600
I think that one gets a little more complicated, because, of course, it's really Square's game and some of their people.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:00.600
That's why I kind of toyed with that idea earlier.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:11.600
Maybe this is why they're jacking up the price, sort of, in this way that they're doing it to try to get more money in the pot so they can put a dump truck full of money on Square's porch to get them to hand over the game already.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:24.600
Who knows? I, in my opinion, use the dump truck of money to make a Super Mario RPG 2, and I think fans will be 50 times happier, but I'm asking for a lot, I realize that.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:31.600
No word if, at the end of October, the NES and SNES catalogs will be updated at all.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:36.600
That is when we're going to get the N64 and Sega Genesis games, so there's that.

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:44.600
Dark Tetsuya brings up a good point. A lot of those have legal red tape, which is why I'm not sure GoldenEye is ever going to show up on the N64 side.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:53.600
That's a great point, and Jason talked about that in our intro tonight, too, is that GoldenEye is kind of the Mario RPG of the Nintendo 64.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:57.600
That makes no sense at all, and also perfect sense at the same time, if you think about it.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:12.600
That is that game everybody's going to want on N64, that is just, that's going to be the hardest to get, because of all, it's not just the licenses to the 007 franchise, which, did you know Amazon owns that franchise now when it comes to the movies?

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.600
Why am I not surprised?

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.600
Because they bought MGM.

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:31.600
I'd like to remind you, though, about Mario 64. This is why they don't sell the Mario 3D All-Stars collection anymore, because if you want to play Mario 64, you gotta pay a monthly fee instead of paying a flat fee.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.600
Thanks, Nintendo! You're awesome!

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:38.600
I didn't connect those dots. Good job. Good call-out on that.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:52.600
Bobby Black Wolf is saying, reminder, GoldenEye didn't age well. In some ways, neither did Super Mario RPG. I know that's a controversial statement, but I think there's a lot of people that when you go back and play that again, you're going to be like,

01:04:52.600 --> 01:05:10.600
Oh, this just kind of hit, this hit differently when I was a kid. So, but, not only do you get into the, the movie rights holders and all those issues, then you get into like Pierce Brosnan's likeness issue and all that.

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:14.600
And I don't know how easy that's going to be to get around.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:18.600
Make up Daniel Craig like they did for the really crappy GoldenEye remake that they did.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:26.600
And who knows if they could even do that. They would have to make, you know, just a very, put Mario's face in it and have Charles Martin voice it.

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.600
We'll put Chris Pratt in there.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.600
Moving on.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:37.600
I have one other kind of Nintendo, Super Nintendo sort of thing.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:49.600
And that is that the Disney Classic Collection is getting revised. So there's going to be a new version of this. It's going to be out on the Nintendo Switch for $29.99 on November 9th.

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:59.600
There is, if you own the original edition, you can get a DLC pack that will upgrade you to this new Disney Classic Collection because there's more games.

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:03.600
It's the Jungle Book and more Aladdin for $10.

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:08.600
The original Classic Collection was Aladdin, The Lion King, and The Jungle Book.

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:17.600
The new one will have, I guess there's Aladdin The Final Cut, Aladdin demo version for the Mega Drive, Aladdin Japanese version for the Mega Drive.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:23.600
So there's like some extra stuff there. But also, of course, The Jungle Book was missing before so that's coming out as well.

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:32.600
There's what some third party folks are choosing to do instead, is release their own collections.

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:37.600
Hence why we don't have Secret of Mana in the Super Nintendo Collection.

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:43.600
Hence, we didn't get a Castle of Illusion announcement on the Genesis pack, even though that's not part of this.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:48.600
I'm sure, you know, Disney and all them have their plans for that, that's for sure.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:50.600
Comments in chat.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:54.600
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, this was neat, I might have to look for the new collection.

01:06:54.600 --> 01:07:00.600
Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, 30 bucks. I mean, it's only a handful of games, but they are pretty solid.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:05.600
And it is Disney IPs, so we know why it costs a little bit more, you're paying that premium.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:09.600
But there's something available. So, I thought that was neat.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:12.600
Let's move on to Dark Sakura.

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:21.600
So, going to the UK, and I think this is awesome and I would like to see more of this happen.

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:31.600
But the quote, micro transaction and in-game ads, they're basically being smacked down quite a bit more.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:38.600
The UK's Advertising Standards Authority updated their guidance on how game developers and publishers

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:43.600
should and should not advertise in-game currencies and other purchases.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:50.600
They're pushing back against labels such as best value and stuff like that.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:08:03.600
And also, you know, with this rule, it's supposed to prevent misleading players into spending more money

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:09.600
than they would have otherwise by putting 30% off, 20% off, etc.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:17.600
And the ASA is also a self-regulatory agency for advertising in the UK, for those who don't know.

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:24.600
For games that have premium currency that's only available via real-world money,

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:34.600
they want the advertisements and pop-ups to include a real currency value.

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:44.600
So, for example, if you were going to buy a weapon for 500 gems, you would be told how much it is in pounds.

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:52.600
I hate that this article keeps going back to dollars when this is about UK stuff and the dollar isn't used there.

01:08:53.600 --> 01:09:00.600
So, anyway, if an ad appears in-game, it'll say, oh, it's X gems and X pounds.

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:06.600
So, I really think that that's a good idea.

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:12.600
Yeah, I'll be curious to see if that has any type of, like, ripple effects to over here.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:17.600
But at the same time, usually it's kind of like when the UK passed that law about internet cookies and stuff.

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:21.600
Like, we all have to deal with it, too, because now all the websites have that pop-up.

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:23.600
This site may use cookies, you know, and all that stuff.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.600
And I block everyone that I can.

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:28.600
Yeah, some of them are very deceitful in the way they do it, though.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.600
But, you know, big surprise, right?

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.600
It is what it is.

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:32.600
Yeah.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.600
Well, go ahead.

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:40.600
Well, I was just going to say the big thing about this is that, you know, they've made these requests, right?

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:44.600
They've requested devs give notifications about, like, loot boxes.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:49.600
But they're still trying to get loot boxes made, like, gambling.

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:57.600
But the thing is, is that they aren't able to interpret or enforce the legislations or find companies that break their guidance.

01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:01.600
But they can refer the serious offenders to other regulators.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:05.600
So they're more like, this is your warning.

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.600
This is your warning.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:10.600
Don't, no, don't, we're telling mom.

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:14.600
That's it.

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:17.600
We'll see what develops with this. Could be very interesting.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:18.600
Let's move on.

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:19.600
Let's move on.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.600
Loki.

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:28.600
So unfortunately, we Well, fortunately, we have news that the Twitch and the music industry have struck a deal.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:32.600
Unfortunately, it's not a good deal for at least the users of which.

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:47.600
So the main changes that are going to happen now is instead of basically taking down your entire channel, if there's ever like a copyright strike, they are going to now remove any VODs or clips that contain the unauthorized music from the creator channel.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:11:04.600
And if it's a live stream that's basically flagrantly, you know, violating copyright, like rebroadcasting the music concert or something like that, then they may also issue a warning or penalty depending on the creator's history of that kind of music use.

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:14.600
So this isn't necessarily like, I can now subscribe to something and be able to, you know, have licensed music on my channel.

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:22.600
No, it is not that and they haven't really given you any more tools necessarily to kind of work with this stuff.

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:26.600
So it's unfortunate, a little underwhelming.

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:28.600
This is very much a lie.

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:39.600
This is not this is not Oh, you can go ahead and just play music in the backgrounds of your streams like many of you used to do like have your Spotify playlist up while you're, you know, sitting there playing League of Legends or something.

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:44.600
You're just playing your Spotify, you know, trance favorites or whatever in the background. You can't you can't do that.

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.600
That's not what this is going to allow you to do.

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:52.600
This is basically kind of protecting Twitch's ass more than anything to get sued.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:59.600
And I guess it's a bit of a courtesy that they will instead of giving you a strike, just delete the VOD.

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:01.600
That's about it. That's about all you get.

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:05.600
S2-100 Matt in chat says this is like the quote from the Godfather.

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:11.600
Here is my offer to you. Nothing.

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:15.600
On a related note, have you seen that latest thing going around Twitter today?

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:21.600
It came up kind of like later than our show roll kind of goes out, so I didn't have time to add it.

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:25.600
But apparently, Twitch is adding some things on the back end.

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.600
They haven't had an official announcement.

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:34.600
I don't know how people find these like Twitch leaks if there's like people that work at Twitch that are leaking information or what.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:41.600
But there's like screenshots and stuff now that are showing that Twitch is about to enable where you can choose that your chatters,

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:49.600
in order to chat in the channel, you have to have like so many so much watch time or you have had to have been following for so long

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:53.600
or that you have to have like a two factor authenticator on your account or things like that.

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:56.600
Like there's all these different things that you can add to chat.

01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:01.600
And I want to say, was it following as well? Something else.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:05.600
There's another one that they had put in there. They were putting restrictions on.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:14.600
Unfortunately, it still has nothing to do with follow botting where you get just these random bots that follow you.

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:18.600
And some of them have really gross avatars and usernames.

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:23.600
In fact, you may be experiencing some of that while this show is going on tonight.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:28.600
You may have noticed and we're trying to, you know, just shoot it out of here.

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:33.600
Luckily, our stream labs does not work like 99 percent of streamers stream labs.

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:43.600
So it's probably confusing whatever little little child is trying to play that game right now is that it's not where it's not having the same effect on this channel that it has most places.

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:46.600
Thank you. Tiger class says one of them is verified email.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:14:02.600
It also does not stop hate raids. So I'm meaning the actual rating of a channel from an account with very few followers, not affiliate or anything like that, who uses disgusting images as their profile picture.

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:08.600
So it doesn't stop that either. Hopefully that is coming.

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:18.600
But I guess it's a first start. I mean, it's a little late, but all right, let's try to acknowledge its movement in the right direction.

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:26.600
It's where we need to go. I will give it one clap. It's not even implemented, actually. It only gets a golf clap for now.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:30.600
Then when we actually get the implementation, maybe there'll be more to say.

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:34.600
As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, Twitch is giving folks a cookie with this new feature they're adding.

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:39.600
We're all going to take a bite, but there's a chance there might be raisins there. Yep.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:44.600
All right. Let's talk about more lawsuits. We have a lot of legal news tonight.

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:50.600
Let's talk about Quantic Dream, which, of course, is the developer behind Detroit Heavy Rain.

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:59.600
Recently, they went to a libel action against French newspapers who published allegations of misconduct that happened at the company in 2018.

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:05.600
The court has now ruled on kind of a split decision, which is interesting.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:17.600
Quantic Dream did win the libel suit against Le Monde, the French newspaper, but it lost the other libel suit against Media Part, which was the other French newspaper.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:23.600
Apparently, this is kind of weird because these pieces were like a collaboration between them all.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:28.600
So this is one of those the court doesn't make any sense in this regard.

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:37.600
And many of us are sitting here like Nick Fury going, given this decision, I have chosen to ignore it or whatever that line is.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:45.600
It's kind of kind of wild what's going on. Media Part won the suit by proving that there was good faith reporting practices.

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:48.600
They're saying that's kind of one of the key differences here.

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:57.600
But Le Monde failed to meet the burden of proof, which was the unwillingness to disclose the anonymous sources to the court.

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.600
Also, some folks that analyze what happens in French courts.

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:07.600
You can't put the same standards that you might be used to in the U.S. or from all the law and order that you watch.

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:11.600
And so you think you know about court. It doesn't work the same way in France.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:14.600
French libel cases are known to be notoriously difficult.

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:23.600
You have to prove not only what you're saying is true, but that you had all the evidence at the time that the article in question or whatever it is is published.

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:31.600
And all of that burden falls on the defendant. So that might explain why Le Monde didn't didn't work out there.

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:40.600
But the fact that one of them won because media part one, it kind of does show that the allegations against Quantic Dream.

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:43.600
Were there was probably a spark of truth in there.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:49.600
Allegedly, I have to choose my words carefully because apparently Quantic Dream will sue anybody that misstates it.

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:56.600
But if if it sure looks like from this court ruling, it wouldn't have gone their way if there wasn't some truth in it.

01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:00.600
So that's what I see in that situation. So.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:05.600
All right. Now, now the folks in Chad are arguing about oatmeal raisin cookies.

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:18.600
Here's the thing. I enjoy an oatmeal raisin cookie when you tell me it's an oatmeal raisin cookie and I have time for my taste buds to prepare for that oatmeal and raisin taste.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:23.600
When you mix it in a plate that also has chocolate chip cookies.

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:28.600
That's not nice. I would say the exact same thing with carob chips.

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:32.600
I'm sorry. Carob chips are not chocolate. I understand why they exist.

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:36.600
I understand. You know, that's fine. Just you need to warn me.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:41.600
You need to warn me. All right. Moving on.

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:48.600
Let's let's go back to a simpler time when we were gaming and had lots of cookies in our next segment.

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:51.600
For the record.

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:54.600
Oh.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:06.600
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:10.600
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:16.600
All right. Dark soccer. What did you pick tonight? And anything else you might want to clarify?

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:23.600
Well, I was going to say cranberry oatmeal cookies with chocolate chips are divine.

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:29.600
I can go with that. I like cranberries or like Jason said, cranberry orange cookies are also divine.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:34.600
Oh, they make a chip. That's really good. Anyway, we can all see the game on screen.

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:44.600
So the game in question is Super Fantasy Zone, which is a game actually that I would love to get my hands on.

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.600
I have been looking for a legit copy for a while.

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:54.600
And if someone could make sure that that lands in my hands, I would love you forever.

01:18:54.600 --> 01:19:03.600
Anyway, the game came out in only in Europe and Japan.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:13.600
It was released in Japan on January 14th, 1992 and Europe September 11th, 1992.

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:20.600
And we didn't get a US release on anything until July 21st, 2008.

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:26.600
It came out on Virtual Console. It was also included on the Sega Genesis Mini.

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:31.600
So it's a free-moving shoot-em-up. It's like all the other fantasy zones.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:38.600
But it has the distinction of being on the Mega Drive or the Genesis as we had it over here.

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:46.600
It's got really good music. It really fits the feel of the original games.

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:52.600
It had a different composer. It was Kodaka Naoki.

01:19:52.600 --> 01:20:00.600
But it had lots of the themes that kind of went along with the original Fantasy Zone music that was done by Kawaguchi Hiroshi.

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:06.600
So in this particular game, you are playing as the Oppa Oppa.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:13.600
And he's fighting to avenge the death of his father, Oppa Oppa, who was killed defen-

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:18.600
Sorry, I don't know why Siri is talking to me because this is stupid.

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:22.600
Apparently, Siri thinks that she's the Oppa Oppa. I'm just saying.

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:28.600
Anyway, he was killed defending Fantasy Zone against Dark Menon.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:40.600
And Oppa Oppa has to cleanse the Fantasy Zone of these evil creatures, evil beings, and restore peace.

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:46.600
So it's very Defender. I would say this is the logical spiritual-

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:50.600
The series is a spiritual successor to Defender.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:53.600
You have to shoot down all the enemy generators.

01:20:53.600 --> 01:21:01.600
And then once it's destroyed, all of them are destroyed in the level, you get a Menon Guardian that you have to fight, which is the boss of the level.

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:04.600
And you also collect gold.

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:07.600
And the gold is used in the store.

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:12.600
And you can buy certain things that do have a limited use.

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:19.600
I love getting the five-ton weight that you can just drop on people.

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:23.600
And the rocket jets and the bigger wings and all of that.

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:30.600
And you get a lot of gold when you beat the Guardians.

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:33.600
I mean, it's just Fantasy Zone. It's how all Fantasy Zones are.

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:39.600
The best thing about the Oppa Oppa is that he'll fly around with his cute little wings.

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:44.600
But when he's on the ground, he has little feet and walks around.

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:53.600
Anyway, this one was developed by Sunsoft and published by Sega.

01:21:54.600 --> 01:22:01.600
And really, it was just the 16-bit entry into the Fantasy Zone series.

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:06.600
And Fantasy Zone is deceptively hard.

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:12.600
I mean, if you have good reaction time, it can be pretty easy.

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:16.600
But there's a lot of stuff going on on the screen at any given point in time.

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:20.600
And the bosses are pretty bullet hell style.

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:23.600
You know, before there was real bullet hell.

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:27.600
But they're fun games and have great music.

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:32.600
To this day, though, my favorite is still Fantasy Zone 2, Tears of an Oppa Oppa.

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:35.600
And that's it.

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:37.600
Alright.

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:40.600
As I'm finishing a cookie over here myself.

01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:41.600
Can you guess what kind of cookie I'm having?

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:42.600
Girl!

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:43.600
What?

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.600
I'm having a JoJo.

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:47.600
So that's a Trader Joe's knockoff Oreo.

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.600
They have pumpkin.

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:53.600
Because Alan went to Trader Joe's last week during the show, actually.

01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:55.600
During all the pumpkin things.

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:56.600
And he brought them all home.

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:57.600
So, there you go.

01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:58.600
Anyway.

01:22:58.600 --> 01:22:59.600
Rob.

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:00.600
Yes?

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:02.600
I did not, by the way, have a pumpkin spice latte.

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:05.600
Because this year I'm not going to have one at all.

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:07.600
Well, that's disappointing.

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:12.600
But I had a chai with the apple stuff in it.

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:14.600
Oh, I love the apple drink.

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:16.600
It was delightful.

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.600
But too sweet.

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:21.600
They definitely need a sugar-free version.

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:26.600
It is a very different kind of drink.

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:27.600
It's very sweet.

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:28.600
But I love it.

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:29.600
Well, no.

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:33.600
I didn't have their macchiato thing because I don't like caramel.

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:34.600
Oh.

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:35.600
But I had it.

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:38.600
You had the stuff in another drink, basically.

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:39.600
Yeah.

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:41.600
I had a chai with the apple stuff.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.600
I think next time I do it.

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:44.600
Just get it without caramel.

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.600
It's just a drizzle they put on top.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:47.600
It's easy to get it without it.

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.600
But I wanted it with the chai.

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:50.600
Oh, that works.

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:52.600
To get the spiciness out of the chai.

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:53.600
All right.

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.600
But next time I do it, I'm going to do half as much of the apple.

01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:03.600
The thing is that I want pumpkin flavored things and not pumpkin spice flavored things.

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:04.600
Does that make sense?

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:05.600
Oh, yeah.

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:06.600
Yeah.

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:07.600
I want pumpkin soup.

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:11.600
I've been lectured on the difference many times by many people, as if I don't know,

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:13.600
anytime my pumpkin spice thing comes up.

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:17.600
The other thing is, is that a lot of places will go way too heavy on certain mixes of

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:19.600
the spice.

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:25.600
And that combined with just the overwhelming sugary-ness of their syrup.

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:27.600
I can't drink it anymore.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:28.600
It's too much.

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:31.600
Now, speaking of drinks, and before we get back into some news.

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:33.600
I will make it at home, by the way.

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:38.600
I want to bring up the classic drink of the week because, Jamie, you will get a kick out

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:39.600
of this.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:41.600
I am actually drinking, and this is not an endorsement.

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:42.600
They don't pay us for this.

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:46.600
However, those of you that listen to OLR, back in the day, there's going to be two or

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:48.600
three of you that are going to get this joke.

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:50.600
I apologize, but give us this joke.

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:55.600
We'll notice on camera that I am currently drinking a Propel.

01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:56.600
Yeah.

01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:02.600
And you might remember, back when we played DDR and we were quote unquote working out

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:07.600
a lot and really sweating to some of those nine footers that we would play in DDR, the

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:14.600
Propel kind of became that drink that everyone fucking had for like the hydration and all

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:15.600
that stuff.

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:16.600
Again, this is not an endorsement.

01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:18.600
It is just, we all were really into it.

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:21.600
It was, you know, and it's, it tastes pretty good actually.

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:26.600
And yeah, so they, they have them at Costco and Alan got a bunch of these for his workouts

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:28.600
and I steal from them once in a remember.

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:29.600
I'm sorry.

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:30.600
I was reading chat.

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:31.600
I steal from them once in a while.

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:35.600
I like Propel for a while and then I think they changed their formula.

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:39.600
They may, they still taste similar to me, but they definitely changed the look.

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:40.600
Yeah.

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:46.600
We, um, we've actually been going for a Pocari sweat in our house, which actually tastes

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:51.600
very salty, like sweat and kind of looks like sweat, but Dan likes it.

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:54.600
I actually thought this was an apple flavored beverage at first, but actually it's Kiwi

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:56.600
strawberry, which apparently I can't tell the difference.

01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:57.600
There you go.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:58.600
I don't like Kiwi.

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:00.600
I don't like Kiwi anything.

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:01.600
Oh, I don't mind it.

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:02.600
I like it.

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:04.600
You can have all of it, Rob.

01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:07.600
I just want like a regular strawberry flavor.

01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:10.600
Um, for the record, I'm addicted to pink drinks.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:15.600
The end fifth dream in chat says I drink a lot of Propel and Powerade power water because

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:16.600
zero sugar.

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:19.600
Yeah, that is another, it is zero sugar, which you know, is important.

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:20.600
Uh, orange.

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:21.600
Right.

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:22.600
Says I kind of remember that.

01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:25.600
And dark Tetsuya says a Pepperidge farm remembers by which I mean, I remember.

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:26.600
So there you go.

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:27.600
Your classic drink of the week.

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:28.600
All right.

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.600
Or we could talk about what I had at the bar last night.

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:34.600
I also had some drinks last night, but I'll say that for another episode.

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:35.600
All right.

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:39.600
Let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some other news around the industry

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:40.600
pretty quickly.

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:41.600
Uh, low key.

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:42.600
We'll start with you.

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:43.600
Yeah.

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:47.600
Let's talk about some stuff that was announced during the to dumb.

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:49.600
I love that name of that event.

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:55.600
Uh, the Netflix event that they were talking about the brand new season of the Witcher

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:56.600
is going to be coming.

01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:59.600
Um, that's on December 17th.

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:06.600
Also, they're going to be making a kid's show that's based off the Witcher, maybe a Witcher

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:07.600
babies.

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:08.600
No.

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:09.600
Yes.

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.600
Um, I guess we'll wait and see.

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:16.600
And then also the league of legends animated series that's supposed to be coming out as

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:17.600
well.

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:20.600
That is going to be debuting on November 6th.

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:23.600
So look forward to that as well.

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:27.600
And I not necessarily gaming related.

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:32.600
I know some people don't necessarily like it, but I think the new, uh, live action,

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.600
um, cowboy view up looks pretty awesome.

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:38.600
And they released that intro is perfect for that.

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:44.600
And I'm, I'm down for that, but that's, uh, that's that.

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:51.600
And then, um, not Netflix related the games for October is PlayStation plus have been

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:54.600
announced or leaked or however you want to call that.

01:27:54.600 --> 01:28:02.600
And those include hell let loose mortal combat X and PGA tour two K 21.

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:08.600
So, um, yeah, look forward to those in a couple of weeks.

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:14.600
I'll finally be able to pick up mortal combat 10 or X or whatever it's called.

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:16.600
Nice X 10.

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:17.600
Yeah, it's good.

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.600
Cause it's, it's, it is mortal combat X.

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:25.600
They did say that at one point it's, it's meant, it's meant to be a pun, but it's final fantasy 10.

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.600
Do you remember? That was a good OLR moment.

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:34.600
Do you remember when we emailed them to get clarification and they actually responded like that?

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:38.600
That was back in the day when like podcasts were actually important.

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:44.600
We actually got a response from square Enix and they told us it is pronounced 10 or 10 is no, it was 10, two.

01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:46.600
It is pronounced 10, two, not X two.

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:47.600
All right.

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:48.600
All right.

01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:50.600
Anyway, and I could have told you that.

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:56.600
I did tell everybody that, but no one believed me, but I think we wanted to get it from, we, we wanted to get it from the horse's mouth.

01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:58.600
We were like, well, can't we just ask them?

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:01.600
And it's, it's like the one time they actually cared what we thought.

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:03.600
It's great.

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:04.600
All right.

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:07.600
Anyway, uh, let's move on.

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:10.600
Uh, I think dark soccer, we have your stories.

01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:16.600
Yes, there is another series of games that I absolutely love and it's the cotton games.

01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:35.600
And something that I would have just murdered to have my, my hands on as the, uh, the, uh, cotton guardian for Saturn tribute and panorama cotton, which panorama cotton, I think they only made 600 copies of one of my friends has one.

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:45.600
Um, but, but this particular, um, release is going to have cotton, uh, guardian force, uh, Saturn tribute cotton, 100% and panorama cotton.

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:52.600
It is, uh, they haven't said what platforms it's gonna, um, actually hold on for a second.

01:29:52.600 --> 01:30:00.600
Um, guardian for Saturn tribute is due on PS4 and switch on September 30th in Japan with English text.

01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:12.600
Um, the other two ports, uh, do not have a release dates on them, just that they're going to come out by Indian games and strictly limited games, uh, in 2021.

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:14.600
And you know, I'm going to have them.

01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:15.600
Yeah.

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:19.600
Um, and reminder, if you haven't picked it up already, the cotton reboot came out recently.

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:22.600
Um, dark Tetsuya says, I still need to get ahold of the cotton reboot.

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:23.600
Yeah, that came out on switch.

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:25.600
I'm being given a copy.

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:29.600
Oh, well, how nice, how nice that people give you things.

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:34.600
No, I believe I have, I have friends who order too many copies.

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:41.600
Um, I, uh, I know I've, I think I've done panorama cotton as a classic game.

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:45.600
And you've done like several games in the series is a classic game with it.

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:49.600
It's been like 600 episodes that segment, but yes, yes.

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:59.600
Well, the thing is that for those who don't know panorama cotton, apart from just its rarity was also pretty difficult to emulate.

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:07.600
It is a scrolling behind the character behind the shoulder, actually the full character shooter.

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:14.600
Um, and it actually had its own sequel on the dream cast called rainbow cotton.

01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:18.600
That when rainbow cotton came out, you best believe I had it.

01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:23.600
And it's, it's really fun and fucking hard.

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:28.600
Even I want to get the cotton reboot as one of those things where it's like, Oh, Jamie never shuts up about how great this game is.

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:30.600
And it does look really cute.

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:31.600
Oh yeah.

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:33.600
Games are great.

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:38.600
I mean the whole cotton series, and I'm going to tell you right now with this cutesy as it is, it's not easy.

01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:41.600
Um, it is a challenging game.

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:47.600
Orange right in chat with our Wiki master, which I guess is actually now like what fandom or whatever they changed it into.

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:49.600
Anyway, there is a whole orange launch radio Wiki.

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:56.600
I've done two cotton games where certain things have been, um, uh, uh, tracked and yes, magical night dreams.

01:31:56.600 --> 01:32:02.600
Cotton boomerang was episode 251, which was actually the second classic game of the week.

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:06.600
We changed that segment from your website of the week or whatever it was before that.

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:09.600
Uh, we changed that on episode 250.

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:11.600
So it wasn't the first, but it was the second.

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:13.600
I think the first was probably guardian legend.

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:15.600
I believe it was.

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:20.600
Or you may or may have been one of the fan, one of the other fantasy zone games, actually, if that's come to my head.

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:21.600
I don't remember.

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:23.600
It was long ago and I'm old.

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:27.600
Well, it's all right there on the Wiki and I'm sure, I'm sure it's about to get paced in the chat.

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:34.600
And orange right also says panorama cotton was 486 and 250 was fantasy zone.

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:35.600
So that was my first one.

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:36.600
It was your first one.

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:37.600
Wow. How interesting.

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:39.600
That's come full circle tonight on 885.

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:41.600
And I think I've done like two other fantasy zone games.

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:42.600
I'm pretty sure.

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:45.600
I'm like, I didn't even know these fantasy zone games existed.

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:46.600
It's pretty impressive.

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:48.600
Yeah.

01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:53.600
Well, I know, like, I think I've even done like some super obscure shit like puzzle in this.

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:54.600
Oh, of course.

01:32:54.600 --> 01:33:01.600
Let's I mean, after 600 episodes of the segment, do you think we'll ever retire this segment and move on to a new segment?

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:04.600
No, no, I don't think I get new access to games every year.

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:05.600
Exactly.

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:06.600
New new game show every year.

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:11.600
And also we've mixed it up with like the flag and that stuff.

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:14.600
I do think maybe I'm just gonna throw this out there.

01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:16.600
Maybe for that.

01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:17.600
And this is your call, Jamie.

01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:31.600
But but for the 20th anniversary next year, maybe you should reopen the archives for like the ultimate classic games of the week and like revive 12 really good ones.

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:37.600
But that's not if you want to do it again, maybe you don't want to do them again.

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:42.600
But I'm like, I can't do the classic game master list.

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:48.600
The the classic game segment is now eligible to be a classic game.

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:54.600
So I think it's time to be a meta on that a little bit.

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:56.600
All right.

01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:58.600
I'll think about it.

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:03.600
Orange right in chat says, I do like it when the reboot still have the original included.

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:07.600
I wish that Actraiser remaster included the Super Nintendo version.

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.600
Yes, I'm with you there, Orange, right?

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:12.600
But can't you play that anyway on the game store?

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:18.600
I do not believe it is part of the I think it was on Virtual Console back in the Wii U, Wii days.

01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:23.600
But I do not believe it is in the Switch online library.

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:25.600
Why the fuck not?

01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:30.600
Because of this game that we just got, I'm guessing in part, but that's a great question.

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:31.600
Why the fuck not?

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:33.600
All right. I'm sorry.

01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:37.600
Yeah. So next year I'll count down my top 12 classic games.

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:38.600
Love it.

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:39.600
All right.

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:41.600
One other story here, right?

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:45.600
Oh, yeah, I guess I get to talk about other stuff.

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:46.600
Rapid fire.

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:49.600
I can't brain rob.

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:50.600
It's fine.

01:34:50.600 --> 01:35:01.600
So there is a legend in Japan that is closing its doors after a 28 year run.

01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:07.600
And it is the Sega, right now I'm having trouble pronouncing stuff.

01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:14.600
Ikebukuro Gigo arcade is closing on, it's already closed on September 20th.

01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:20.600
So alas, thank you for 28 years.

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:26.600
And the loudspeakers played Hotaru no Hikari, which is Light of the Firefly.

01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:33.600
And it's usually played right before Japanese stores close or right at closing time.

01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:37.600
And it's gone.

01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:39.600
I had a big crowd.

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:40.600
Everyone was sad.

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:41.600
Yeah.

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:42.600
Yeah.

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:44.600
As Joe and Matt is echoing that folks crowded the Sega arcade.

01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:46.600
It was wild seeing the video for it.

01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:48.600
I didn't think there was video out there, but that's.

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:50.600
Oh, I'm sure there's video.

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:51.600
It has to exist.

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:54.600
I hope everybody was behaving and waving wearing their masks.

01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:55.600
All right.

01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:56.600
This is Japan.

01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:57.600
Yeah, that's true.

01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:58.600
All right.

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:02.600
All right.

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:03.600
Let's move on.

01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:05.600
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:08.600
Let's go to the U.S. Loki.

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:10.600
Yeah.

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:13.600
So we've got a few games coming out this week.

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:19.600

We have A New World on PC.

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:55.600

Doctor Who, The Edge of Reality on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X.

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:26.600
Oh boy, I'm super excited for E-Football 2022.

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:29.600
That's coming out on pretty much everything.

01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:32.600
Yep, super excited about that one.

01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:33.600
Pass.

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:43.600
No, the one I'm actually excited about is Hot Wheels Unleashed on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X.

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:45.600
Actually looks really cool.

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:49.600
The Legend of Heroes, Kurano Kistake.

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:52.600
And that's on PlayStation 4.

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:59.600
We've got Mary Skelter Finale on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

Toy Soldiers HD on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:21.600
And the not quite better than E-Football 2022, but it is yet another football game, FIFA 22.

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:33.600
Your gambling loot box simulator that is coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Stadia, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:36.600
Actually, I would say probably most of those last gen systems.

01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:42.600
Just make sure it's not the Legacy Edition because Legacy Edition means we just updated the roster and threw it back out again for 60 bucks.

01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:44.600
Pay attention to those.

01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:46.600
Also, it sucks. Just don't buy it.

01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:47.600
The end.

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:51.600
Alright, moving over to Japan and checking out the releases there.

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:53.600
On the Nintendo Switch this week, this is interesting.

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:57.600
Hades gets its Japanese release this week on the 30th.

01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:59.600
I don't know if that's been redubbed.

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:05.600
The voice acting is some of the neatest part of that game, so I'm curious if they've redone it in Japanese.

01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:09.600
I assume so, but the screenshots aren't giving me any indication one way or the other.

01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:13.600
But regardless, the official Japanese releases this week on the Switch.

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:20.600
Also in Japan this week, we talked a little bit about this earlier, but Cotton Guardian Force Saturn Tribute is out this week in Japan.

01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:27.600
We also have B Project, Ryusei Fantasia is out this week in several different editions.

01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:30.600
Hot Wheels Unleashed also makes its way to Japan this week.

01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:36.600
And that Melty Blood type Lumina is also available in Japan in a regular and limited type of edition.

01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:41.600
Miyamoto's Arithmetic Classroom, the complete puzzle collection to become smart.

01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:49.600
I don't know why that name is so fucking funny to me.

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:53.600
But it is just like, hey, if you play this game, you will be smart. The end.

01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:56.600
Only geniuses play this game.

01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:01.600
Only a genius can pass level 7.

01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:03.600
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:05.600
It's a mobile game, add the game.

01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:08.600
Anyway, that is out of Japan this week.

01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:10.600
I don't know of a US equivalent to that.

01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:15.600
Miyamoto's Arithmetic Classroom, the complete puzzle collection to become smart.

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:18.600
Alright, there it is. The definitive smart people.

01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:21.600
If it was to become dumb, it's just all wrong.

01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:25.600
Orange Riot puts add, fail, simple puzzle.

01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.600
That shit happens to me all the time.

01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:29.600
And I hate when I actually play those stupid little ad games.

01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:35.600
But you know the one where the fire is going through and it's about to set the guy on fire and you're supposed to turn a thing?

01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:37.600
Well, sometimes I just want to kill the guy, okay?

01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:40.600
Sometimes I just close the game.

01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:49.600
I love to play the game on Twitter. It's called block the account that's advertising that. Block the sponsored account.

01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:57.600
On the PlayStation 5 this week in Japan, Saints Row the third remastered gets its Japanese release this week.

01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:58.600
So there's that.

01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:03.600
And then Hot Wheels Unleashed and Hades also on the PlayStation 5 this week.

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:07.600
FIFA 22 also on its way by the time the weekend comes around.

01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:10.600
Let's go to the UK.

01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:16.600
So for the remainder of September, on the 28th we have Hercule Poirot.

01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:21.600
I always mispronounce this guy's name, the writer. Poirot, the first cases.

01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:24.600
We have Overcooked Special Edition.

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:28.600
We have The Escapists 2. Golf with your friends.

01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:31.600

And then in October we have Away the Survival series.

01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:03.600

And FIFA 22.

01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:27.600
What's Crazy Chicken Shooter bundle? Because you got my attention with that one.

01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:28.600
I closed it.

01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:32.600
It's shovelware. They're Crazy Chicken Shooter.

01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:37.600
Let's go down the rabbit hole about the Crazy Chicken Shooter saga here.

01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:41.600
That all started on the Wii. Yeah, it was on the Wii, actually.

01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:44.600
Wait, shovelware? On the Wii?

01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:46.600
I know, on my Wii.

01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:56.600
So it was a bunch of just really cheap, I guess, arcade shooter games.

01:42:56.600 --> 01:43:01.600
And they made a lot of them because they were shovelware and cheap to produce.

01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:06.600
So now it's a collection of those because you'd want a collection of those for some reason.

01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:08.600
Fantastic.

01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:14.600
Alright, let's move on to some more stories.

01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:17.600
Loki, why don't you start us off with this first story.

01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:19.600
Yes.

01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:33.600
So, apparently people are upset with Good Ol' Games because the Hitman Game of the Year edition, which launched on GOG recently, has DRM.

01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:40.600
And because GOG prides itself on being DRM-free, people are not happy about that.

01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:46.600
So they are review bombing the game because the game does have online DRM.

01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:55.600
And that is kind of the reason why people purchase stuff on GOG in the first place is because they know it's going to be DRM-free.

01:43:56.600 --> 01:44:05.600
Not sure what they're going to do to necessarily address that, if anything, but just keep that in mind if you're going to purchase the game, that it's going to have DRM on there.

01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:11.600
But to be fair, it does say on the actual store page that it does have DRM, but people are still mad about it.

01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:13.600
It's the principle of the thing, I guess.

01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:18.600
Well, I think it's also kind of like, you know, it kind of goes against what GOG is so known for, you know?

01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:20.600
Yes, definitely.

01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:30.600
But they are saying, though, if you have purchased the game and you're not satisfied with that, you can use your right to refund the game.

01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:37.600
At the same time, they said that they also want some feedback and they're not going to tolerate review bombing.

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:46.600
Let's talk about TwitchCon coming back.

01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:52.600
Not this year. Some people saw the headline and thought it was this year. Isn't that a little soon? No, no.

01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:56.600
But TwitchCon is planning to come back in 2022.

01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:02.600
Now, of course, you know, we're all hoping the COVID situation is in a very different place come 2022.

01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:03.600
I want to go.

01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:05.600
I want to go, too.

01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:08.600
So you know what's going to be interesting about this?

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:16.600
Let me just quickly say TwitchCon will be in Amsterdam in July 2022 and TwitchCon will be in San Diego in October 2022.

01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:23.600
This is very similar to what they were trying to do in 2020 before all this happened.

01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:26.600
So they're kind of going back to that schedule.

01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:29.600
Yeah, Dark Soccer is saying I want to go. I absolutely want to go as well.

01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:34.600
And I think what's going to be interesting about this, I don't know if it's because of the pandemic or what,

01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:40.600
but because Twitch culture really feels like it's grown so much.

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:42.600
I feel like there's a lot of people that want to go.

01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:49.600
I'm starting to wonder if this con is going to run into like ticket and availability issues like some other cons hit.

01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:52.600
I worry that we're going to hit that with this con.

01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:56.600
So if you're going to go, I would get your ticket as soon as they go on sale.

01:45:56.600 --> 01:46:03.600
There is that even my Defton chat says I want to go to TwitchCon San Diego is like a three hour car drive.

01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:07.600
I might finally meet Mike Deft. That would be fun. That'd be great.

01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:10.600
We'll see. But yeah, I definitely have my sights on TwitchCon.

01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:15.600
I want to go. Dark Soccer says she wants to go. Loki would probably go if he could.

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:19.600
So Alan will probably want to go. In fact, I know he wants to go.

01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:25.600
He wants to meet all the Twitch streamers he hangs out with that are all going to be there, you know, which are pretty much all we all we all know.

01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:35.600
If you watch any Dead by Daylight on Twitch, there is a running gag in multiple channels that Dark Soccer and I clearly watch the same people.

01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:40.600
Clearly, it mostly happens in puddings.

01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:45.600
And who was it? Was it bourbon the other day?

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:49.600
Maybe I'm actually not sure I follow him, but I watch him oddly and I need to just follow him.

01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:52.600
I don't know. Yeah, bourbon actually today.

01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:58.600
And, you know, I like I like to give, you know, some streamers a shout out, but bourbon was my champion today.

01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:03.600
Plugging up my my marathon tomorrow and bourbon and homotron.

01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:06.600
I know we've both been in homotrons. You got one from puddings.

01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:09.600
I just got the push alert on my phone, too. Oh, really? Yeah.

01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:12.600
Puddings is also like they're just fantastic people.

01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:17.600
I love this community and I watch some of Hydro's tournament, by the way, him in Losing Color.

01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:23.600
I saw a little bit of that. Yeah, it was hilarious. OK, Miss Barn, her whole thing.

01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:29.600
Hilarious. The the meme age was up there.

01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:35.600
I'll shout out Tay plays games because that's the person I watch the most, probably of Dead by Daylight.

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:39.600
She's our buddy. And then I'm trying to think who else? Who am I missing?

01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:42.600
There's oh, oh, Nick and Isaac. Yeah, Nick.

01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:45.600
Oh, seeing their channel. So anyway. All right.

01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:51.600
And honestly, the both of them are two of the nicest people ever.

01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:54.600
I'll just put that out there, although I liked Evil Co.

01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:59.600
But with God, that was so funny with all these random ass twitch shout outs that we're doing.

01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:05.600
It's relevant because all of these people, I'm positive, are making plans to go to TwitchCon.

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:09.600
And it's going to be a big meetup of that whole circle and other circles.

01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:13.600
That's why I'm kind of like I almost worry it might be too big.

01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:17.600
But I guess the San Diego Convention Center is pretty big, right? Because that's where they do Comic-Con.

01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:25.600
So maybe it can handle it. We'll see. I'm going to have to order like a crate of Dark Sakura masks.

01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:30.600
No one special 77 in chat says, as fun as TwitchCon sounds, I just can't go due to finances and health.

01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:34.600
Well, for what it's worth, because it is TwitchCon, it'll be streaming on Twitch.

01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:37.600
A lot of it. I know it. You don't get the people that way.

01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:44.600
But as far as places to see me next year, the only thing I can like 100%, 1000% confirm for next year,

01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:50.600
I will absolutely be a DragonCon 2022. So like I already know that that will happen.

01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:55.600
So you can plan on that for Labor Day if you're in the southeast part of the country.

01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:59.600
But I am trying to now that conventions seem likely again,

01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:04.600
now that we know that conventions are possible with precautions and that whole thing,

01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:09.600
and hopefully with COVID, hopefully starting to fade a little bit as we get into next year,

01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:13.600
I think it opens up the opportunity to doing more conventions.

01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:17.600
There's going to be a local video game convention, too, that I want to do.

01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:21.600
So because the SAC horror people are going to put it on, it's going to be a horror and gaming convention.

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:24.600
So that is going to be next year.

01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:29.600
Well, I've also got maybe DerpyCon next year, so I don't know what's going to happen.

01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:33.600
That'll be fun. Yeah. All right. Let's move on.

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:37.600
Let's talk a few more stories. And Dark Soccer, I think you have one.

01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:43.600
I do. Right. Right. Oh, yeah. Duh. I'm sorry.

01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:49.600
I'm so like brain dead today after everything. I saw Transformers the movie again in the theater today.

01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:55.600
Well, that's fun. I think I've seen it now in the theater something like seven or eight times.

01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:03.600
And I have it on laserdisc, so go fig. It's, you know, movie actually does not make very much continuity sense, but it's fun.

01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:14.600
Anyway, Microsoft is rolling out a new Xbox dashboard that has an updated version of Edge, which no one fucking uses.

01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:21.600
So they have a Chromium version of Edge that's available to everyone on Xbox One, Series X, whatever,

01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:29.600
that allows Xbox to stream Stadia games via with access to Discord on the Web and a lot more.

01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:35.600
It looks basically the way it does on PC or Mac. It has the collections.

01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:43.600
It has all the stuff. And as someone who plays on Stadia, this is a pretty, pretty good thing.

01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:47.600
I have been super happy with Stadia a lot.

01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:57.600
Now, Nvidia is blocking access to GeForce now, but that's their problem.

01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:05.600
Why would they do that? They just say they're investigating edge browser support, but they've got the got it blocked.

01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:11.600
Interesting. Yeah. Like for reasons, quote fingers.

01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:19.600
Pod culture and chat says the Chrome based edge isn't bad, actually. And yeah, that's and even in my experience with edge, like it's it's different.

01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:24.600
Like it's it there's a reason why they separated it hard from Internet Explorer.

01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:30.600
They really are pushing to rebrand it. And I get it like they're really they're trying again.

01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:39.600
Well, as someone who's on a Mac, I have zero need for edge and I've disabled it on my Windows 10 build.

01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:43.600
Well, but there's still some good news here, the fact that it can do, you know, Stadia and stuff like that.

01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:50.600
So all is not lost. You know what, though, is pissing me off is that slobs,

01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:57.600
SteamLab OBS still after the updates does not read Stadia on my Mac.

01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:05.600
So I can't use all of the neat widgets and stuff I have for it. I have to use all my my browser based ones.

01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:11.600
Sorry, you guys are going to hear some weird and see some weird discord issues. I'm having problems with the way things are set up and we're live.

01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:14.600
And so I just have to let it play out as we're live. Sorry about that.

01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:20.600
It's misbehaving. Did what I say go? No, you're fine.

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:25.600
It's it's my monitor, my earbuds that is having the problem, not the broadcast.

01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:32.600
Sorry about that. OK. Zen Monkey 11 in chat says Edge is great with Altspace VR.

01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:37.600
It allows us to play movies for friends inside the app in VR.

01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:41.600
So. All right. Let's move on. Just a couple more stories for you guys.

01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:46.600
So we're going to get to the listener roundtable. I think we actually got an email tonight and we have some other fun stuff, too.

01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:54.600
So, Loki, last story. Yes. So this is exciting because this is one of my favorite fighting games ever.

01:52:54.600 --> 01:53:03.600
But there is apparently developers that are in talks for Marvel versus Capcom to a remaster remake or something.

01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:14.600
I'm assuming a remaster at this point. But yeah, apparently, you know, digital clips is in talks with, you know,

01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:19.600
Capcom and I guess Disney and Capcom are like in talks as well.

01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:28.600
A possible new remaster in this. So that would be very exciting as we've begun some discussions on that right now.

01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:34.600
And we're trying to see how far we can go, but ultimately, at the end of the day, it's not really up to us.

01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:41.600
So all we can really do is just make the best case possible and make it easy for them and see if they're interested.

01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:50.600
OK, but still, let's send all our positive energy if this happens, because, yeah, this this is a game I would very much like to see get updated and refresh.

01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:56.600
Please, please, please. Yes. Although I would still like to see a Marvel versus Capcom four,

01:53:56.600 --> 01:54:03.600
but just not like that last one. Let's go back to Marvel versus Capcom at three, please.

01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:13.600
And oh, and Mike Deff says, FYI, digital clips is composed by many who worked at Backbone Entertainment, who worked on MVC2 HD on the 360 and PS3.

01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:17.600
Yes, I just my only thing most of the time I see digital clips associated with stuff.

01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:20.600
It's just kind of like a really good emulation of the prior game.

01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:31.600
And if that's what we get, then OK. But I would be so, so happy if they really like HD-ified it and like really made it something new across my fears that they do.

01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:38.600
You know, like I think some of the early, early Xbox 360 arcade releases, they did kind of go in and do new sprites and you could switch back and forth and stuff.

01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:45.600
I just yeah, I really hope it takes full advantage of like 4K and all that stuff that the new consoles have to offer.

01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:49.600
But I'll just be happy if the series comes back at all. Quite right.

01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:53.600
If I if it's just downloading a legally emulated version of the game that runs.

01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:58.600
Well, you know what? I'll be I'll be plenty satisfied with that, to be honest.

01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:03.600
So that way. All right. Moving on.

01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:08.600
One more story, and it has to do with old gamer pics on the Xbox.

01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:15.600
I know. So the Xbox Series X is going to let you switch back to your ancient Xbox 360 game pic.

01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:18.600
But here's the thing. I never switched away.

01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:25.600
And I guess that's the thing, too, is that if you never switched away, you still have your gamer pic.

01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:33.600
Here's why it's relevant, is because they're actually at one time was an official Orange Lounge Radio gamer pic.

01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:41.600
You have to go way back. But back when Microsoft had this thing called the Gamerscore blog that was kind of like their fan thing that was online,

01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:49.600
the Gamerscore blog got together with a couple podcast networks and did some official like podcast art packs.

01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:53.600
One of the networks does actually now both the networks don't exist anymore.

01:55:53.600 --> 01:56:02.600
But the the network that we used to be on had one of the all games network had the second pack that went up on the store.

01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:08.600
And so there were icons for many of the shows that you could grab. Bobby Black Wolf had one, his little Wolfie icon.

01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:11.600
We had a pixel thing that was done by Loki.

01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:19.600
So Loki actually Loki has an Xbox gamer pic out there that he actually did. So that is available as well.

01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:23.600
It's also available on a T-shirt and other memorabilia as well.

01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:26.600
The MOG network store. Oh, look at that. Very nice.

01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:29.600
And the Black Wolf stuff as well. I think that's also true.

01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:35.600
Vog network dot com slash shop if you want to check that out, along with some newer dark soccer designs as well.

01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:40.600
So you can go retro, you can go modern, whatever you want to do. You got all that available to you.

01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:47.600
But unfortunately, and I have to make this clear, you can no longer get that gamer pic around the time that blog closed down,

01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:52.600
which was a long time ago. I guess they removed all the associated content, unfortunately.

01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:58.600
So you can't get that official gamer pic anymore. I'm going to throw this out there.

01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:03.600
I would love nothing more than to get it back. However, that may happen.

01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:08.600
Although I don't think Xbox or Microsoft is interested in loading more gamer pics now because they've kind of moved past that.

01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:13.600
And it's all about those avatar items. But I'm just going to put it out there.

01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:19.600
However, if you want to go back to an old gamer pic that you do, if you did download it, then you still have it in your library.

01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:23.600
So if you got it eight years ago, it's still in your library. So there is that.

01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:31.600
And you'll be able to switch back to it because if you switched from your icon to like an avatar thing or one of the newer ones,

01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:37.600
you could never go back to your old one. And that's why I never switched, as I heard that was the case.

01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:45.600
And so I still have that OLR gamer pic to this day. And I'm pretty sure Bobby did the same thing with his gamer pic and never changed.

01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:51.600
So now the feature is rolling out to a group of testers in the alpha skip ahead group.

01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:56.600
And yeah, you only can go back to the current Xbox 360 gamer pic.

01:57:56.600 --> 01:58:00.600
So if you want to change that gamer pic, you have to change it on an Xbox 360.

01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:04.600
So there is that. Oh, I didn't know that.

01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:08.600
SJ100Matt says you can take an image of that pic and upload it to your console.

01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:13.600
You can use it. Well, as far as I'm concerned, and Loki, maybe this call is really with you.

01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:18.600
But if you can find a way to hack that thing on your console, by all means, do it.

01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:22.600
Get yourself an OLR logo. You agree with me, Loki?

01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:25.600
Yeah, that's fine. I have the original image somewhere.

01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:28.600
Yeah, maybe I should just put it up on Twitter here.

01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:31.600
I've got it. I can put it in Discord.

01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:34.600
Oh, fantastic. Do that. All right.

01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:40.600
That's pretty cool. By the way, this whole feature was done as part of Microsoft's exploration time.

01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:44.600
Employees are given half a day each week to work on projects of their choosing.

01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:48.600
And this is what somebody chose to do. Well, we love that. Thank you.

01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:52.600
All right. Let's get to the Listener Roundtable.

01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:56.600
If you'd like to call us, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:59.600
We'll get you in the Discord and we'll take your calls.

01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:01.600
But I think we actually have an email tonight.

01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:05.600
Participate at OrangeLaundry.com is the place where you can send an email.

01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:08.600
But we'll go to Dark Sakura.

01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:12.600
So our email, our one email says, Hello, LR.

01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:15.600
Hi, YYR. Happy fall, everyone.

01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:19.600
The pumpkin spice code has been added to Pixel Poops as of this evening.

01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:23.600
You do remember what it is, don't you? If not, check the Discord.

01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:26.600
That is all. Have a great week, Aaron YYR.

01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:31.600
That is the world's shortest YYR email I think we've ever got.

01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:33.600
But for now, I'll...

01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:35.600
What have you done with YYR?

01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:38.600
Thank you. Thank you, YYR, for the pumpkin spice code.

01:59:38.600 --> 01:59:41.600
If I remember correctly, and I could be...

01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:43.600
Because I shouted a bunch of things at him.

01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:46.600
I said, do ABBA was one thing I joked.

01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:51.600
But I believe he had said the blood code backwards was what he was going to go with.

01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:53.600
So it was going to be the blood code backwards.

01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:56.600
The classic Sega Genesis, but backwards.

01:59:56.600 --> 01:59:59.600
And I actually didn't bring it up in my gaming week last week.

01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:04.600
But I did go to Pixel Poops and I did try it with the strawberry ice cream thing.

02:00:04.600 --> 02:00:07.600
And that whole thing we talked about a couple weeks ago on the show.

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:09.600
So that was cute to see.

02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:15.600
So yeah, and just shout out for Pixel Poops on the Steam Marketplace.

02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:20.600
And then of course, Loki's very own Pixel Poops number two is also available on Steam.

02:00:20.600 --> 02:00:24.600
Or you can get number two specifically on itch.io.

02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:28.600
Over there at Techmaster Games. Is that what it's called?

02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:29.600
Yep.

02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:31.600
Okay, good. My memory worked today. Hooray.

02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:34.600
All right. Thank you for the email.

02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:38.600
If you want to send more emails, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:41.600
is the place to send those emails for a future week.

02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:46.600
Mike Defton Chat says, check the OLR channel on Discord for the codes and the new one.

02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:50.600
Oh, did he post it in our Discord? He did say that in the email now, didn't he?

02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:55.600
Oops. And of course, right now I'm trying to bring it up live for getting the cams on you guys.

02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:58.600
Oops. I guess I shouldn't do that now.

02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:01.600
But I'm just going to assume Mike Defton is...

02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:05.600
Was I right that it's just the blood code backwards, though?

02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:07.600
I have to look that up.

02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:12.600
Meanwhile, if you guys have anything for the listener roundtable, you can put that in our chat room here.

02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:15.600
And we'll get to that here shortly.

02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:20.600
And yes, there it is. Yeah. Oh, okay.

02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:24.600
So he did do ABBA, but it's ABBA twice.

02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:26.600
So it's ABBA ABBA.

02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:30.600
Fine by me. Twice the ABBA, even better.

02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:33.600
Perfect. Thank you, YYR.

02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:35.600
I think that's great.

02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:37.600
All right.

02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:40.600
How about any last minute stories? Do we have any other...

02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:43.600
It seemed like it was a slower week in gaming news,

02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:48.600
but maybe there was something up that popped up on Twitter today before the show happened that I missed.

02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:51.600
There's a tweet about the Last of Us series,

02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:55.600
and it's looking pretty good, and I'm going to get ready to sob ugly.

02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:58.600
Oh, you playing it?

02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:01.600
No, the TV show.

02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:03.600
Oh, that series.

02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:05.600
Okay, I thought when you said series, you meant like,

02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:07.600
okay, yes, I forgot they're making a TV show.

02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:09.600
Yes, yes, yes. Okay, got it.

02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:13.600
And I uploaded the icon. It's in our Discord now.

02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:15.600
Fantastic. How about that?

02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:17.600
All this useful information in our Discord tonight.

02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:20.600
And I saw somebody use the exclamation command earlier.

02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:24.600
Sorry, for whatever reason, we're not modern like that.

02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:27.600
It's just VOG Network, our website, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:29.600
I'll get you right in there.

02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:32.600
We have to answer those exclamation things by hand.

02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:34.600
I don't have chat tonight either.

02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:39.600
This is done, so I'm, yeah, I don't know.

02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:41.600
Also a reminder, in case you didn't figure it out,

02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:46.600
and I think I've mentioned it before, that the Konami code works in my game.

02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:48.600
Oh, that's right. That's right.

02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:53.600
No, you hinted at that before, but I don't think we ever got confirmation on that, so that's fun.

02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:54.600
Yep, it works.

02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:57.600
And you just put out that plus addition of your game too, right?

02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:03.600
I did, yeah. So then also with that too, you can hold the A button when you press start,

02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:05.600
and you play as the female character.

02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:06.600
Oh, great.

02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:12.600
So there's no real change other than the image, but it's something.

02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:17.600
I was going to make changes, but then I was like, eh, I'm not.

02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:22.600
Well, because women don't poop, so there would just be flowers that you would lay on the ground, right?

02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:27.600
Well, why did nobody tell me that? The women don't poop.

02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:28.600
Oh.

02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:32.600
I've been doing the bathroom wrong my whole life.

02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:33.600
Anyway.

02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:36.600
Have you tried not doing that?

02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:41.600
Anyway, all right, bad joke gone worse. All right, all right.

02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:43.600
You know I'll go there.

02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:48.600
I guess that's it. We don't really have a lot of questions in chat, and I'll check the green room one more time.

02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:52.600
No, I don't see anybody there, so I think we're towards the end of the show.

02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:55.600
Unless, Loki, I don't know if you had any last minute stories.

02:03:55.600 --> 02:03:58.600
Nope, nope. It's slow this week.

02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:00.600
Yeah, it was a little slower this week. Understandable.

02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:02.600
That Nintendo Direct stole all the thunder.

02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:05.600
All right, let's get to final thoughts and all that good stuff.

02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:09.600
Hey, I want to thank you guys for listening to our show this week,

02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:13.600
whether it was on the podcast feed where nobody told me that last week's show was misnumbered.

02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:14.600
That's all right.

02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:18.600
Or whether it was live here on Twitch, appreciate that.

02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:22.600
All those of you that listen live and listen to us on podcast feed, we appreciate it.

02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:27.600
We don't ask for your money, but thank you for those that do the bits and the subscriptions and all that

02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:31.600
and shop in the store and all that. You don't have to, but you do. Thank you very much.

02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:36.600
The one thing we would ask for this content, if you wouldn't mind helping us spread the word,

02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:40.600
just tell a friend or two, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice

02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:43.600
and we want to bring more gamers here to hear their voices.

02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:47.600
So tell a friend or two about the show, social media awareness goes a long way,

02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:49.600
tweet about an episode or what have you.

02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:56.600
Get people to the link that gets it on their devices, that link to Spotify, Apple Music slash iTunes,

02:04:56.600 --> 02:05:00.600
wherever it is that you listen to this podcast, share those links. That really helps.

02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:04.600
It used to be that a host on Twitch would go a long way.

02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:08.600
Twitch changed some things and I don't understand why, but I'll still ask for them

02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:11.600
because I don't see how auto hosts are a bad thing.

02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:13.600
It just doesn't do as much as it used to do, unfortunately.

02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:17.600
But that would be, of course, for our Twitch channel at VOG Network.

02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:21.600
And we already shouted out the store, so I won't shout that out again.

02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:27.600
I think that's really it. One more shout out for Dark Soccer Subathon tomorrow, which is...

02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:29.600
7 o'clock p.m. Pacific time.

02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:33.600
It's going to be a long night, but it could also be an early morning for you East Coasters.

02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:36.600
It could be a long morning as well because I'm stubborn as fuck.

02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:40.600
Alright, check that out. Are you still streaming tonight after the show?

02:05:40.600 --> 02:05:44.600
Yeah, I am. I'm actually already trying to get my OBS ready.

02:05:44.600 --> 02:05:49.600
Okay, awesome. Then I think that was it. We'll be back in seven days, of course,

02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:52.600
to do more show and talk about everything that comes out.

02:05:52.600 --> 02:05:55.600
It's going to be October next week. Can you believe that?

02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:57.600
Where does the time go?

02:05:57.600 --> 02:06:00.600
Alright, let's get to final thoughts.

02:06:00.600 --> 02:06:01.600
In the toilet.

02:06:01.600 --> 02:06:04.600
Dark Sakura, how about your final thought?

02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:09.600
Support me tomorrow. Hang out with me. I'm doing a big thing.

02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:15.600
I'm really nervous about it. And someone bring me pizza and coffee.

02:06:15.600 --> 02:06:18.600
If pizza places are open at those hours, Jamie.

02:06:18.600 --> 02:06:19.600
At seven?

02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:22.600
Well, yeah, when it starts, sure.

02:06:22.600 --> 02:06:23.600
Yeah.

02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:28.600
Alright. But by seven in the morning when you're done, I guess that's when the coffee comes in.

02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:32.600
I'm going to be buying cans of coffee after my Cairo appointment tomorrow.

02:06:32.600 --> 02:06:38.600
And who knows? I mean, I wanted to start it at a decent time, you know,

02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:41.600
that people could at least be there for the start of it.

02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:45.600
Yeah. Alright. Well, good luck and have some good matches.

02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:49.600
Alright. Bye.

02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:56.600
Alright. If that's it for Dark Sakura's final thought, then I will go to Loki for your final thought.

02:06:56.600 --> 02:07:03.600
My final thought is I've been looking to secure cases and stuff for my game as well.

02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:09.600
So just trying to get closer to a physical release.

02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:12.600
Soon, hopefully it's here.

02:07:12.600 --> 02:07:15.600
And my final thought, I don't have a lot a lot.

02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:20.600
Things are in a pretty good place right now. And I just thanks everybody for your support.

02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:24.600
Thank you for being a friend. Just like the Golden Girls said, I'm going to leave it at that note.

02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:29.600
Thank you for being a friend. But I'm not going to sing it because I'll get DMCA struck

02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:32.600
and Twitch is not going to protect me. They're only going to protect themselves.

02:07:32.600 --> 02:07:37.600
So on that note, thank you for being a friend, everybody. Have a wonderful seven days.

02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:42.600
