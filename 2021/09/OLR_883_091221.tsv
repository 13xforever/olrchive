0	13720	Years after Big Picture, Steam Link, Steam Machines and in advance of the Steam Deck,
13720	18800	the Steam App gets a big update that updates the look and functionality of download status.
18800	22480	Big Picture started in Overhaul 9 years ago, 6 years ago Steam VR pushed out a little bit
22480	27240	further and we're finally getting closer to a full visual refresh of Steam by default.
27240	30120	And this is just one change in a sea of gaming news, now it's time to welcome back your
30120	33880	hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki as they bring you two weeks of gaming news
33880	35880	starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
35880	46160	Best of all my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where
46160	48880	every gamer has a voice.
48880	55560	Orange Lounge Radio live once again back with you after having last week off with episode
55560	61480	number 883 of our show for this September the 12th of 2021.
61480	66400	We are back live to talk about video games, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.
66400	71800	My name Rob Roberts and I'm joined as always say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
71800	72800	Hello.
72800	74480	Hi, how are you?
74480	75480	I'm alright.
75480	76480	How was your Labor Day?
76480	78920	How was a week off from OLR?
78920	90800	Well I actually, I did my usual stream just an hour early and by then a certain Cenobite
90800	92680	had been out in the Dead by Daylight universe.
92680	95360	Ah yes, Pinhead, yes.
95360	102280	Well the Hell Priest, as his official name is.
102280	112240	But other than that it was Rosh Hashanah started on Monday and so that is the Jewish New Year
112240	123240	so to all my fellow Jews out there, Happy New Year and Yom Kippur starts on Wednesday
123240	128920	evening through Thursday evening and so for anyone observing have an easy fast and may
128920	131680	you be inscribed in the Book of Life.
131680	137360	Alright, let's see I'm trying to think what else to ask you about the time away but I
137360	140920	guess holidays and things can keep a person busy that's for sure.
140920	144120	And I spent a stupid amount of money on Copic markers.
144120	145360	On what?
145360	146360	Copic markers.
146360	147640	What are those?
147640	152260	They are probably the best alcohol ink markers that you can buy.
152260	158300	They are very expensive and I went looking for deals anywhere that I could find them
158340	162500	so that I could build up my collection of markers and start drawing again.
162500	163500	Oh fun.
163500	164820	Which I've been doing some drawing.
164820	169260	I felt like I saw one of your art things like Dead by Daylight fan art basically.
169260	171180	I need, not really.
171180	172620	I did one piece of fan art.
172620	175340	I did Julie.
175340	176340	Okay yeah that's what I saw.
176340	177340	Like in one of those outfits.
177340	178340	That's what I saw.
178340	181400	But I also did my own little avatar for my channel which I'm really not, I like kind
181400	185820	of rushed it out because I finally redeemed the points to be on Hydro's raft.
185820	186820	Oh cute.
186820	191900	And it's on my own Twitch channel right now.
191900	196300	I have one just like a little piece on it but it's sort of like a combination of like
196300	199220	me I guess with my hair the way it is.
199220	204580	Wearing a pig, wearing the Meg pig mask and a combination outfit that's kind of like one
204580	208140	of the pig outfits and one of the Legion outfits.
208140	209540	Cool.
209540	212740	And that is what I have chosen as my Twitch avatar.
212740	218140	You've been having a very artistic year between that and as you know many folks know you've
218140	221940	done a lot of the music that's used here on OLR and on your own streams and such.
221940	226060	So the artiste has come out over this.
226060	229420	It's not like it's a new thing but you know I feel like we're seeing it more in this last
229420	230740	year or so.
230740	235660	And I also am working on the guidebook for DerpyCon right now.
235660	241500	So I have many irons in the fire and maybe not enough hammers.
241500	245380	Well speaking of fires and hammers that sounds a lot like Minecraft and I know that is the
245380	248860	jam of the one and only Techmaster Loki.
248860	252420	Yeah that's been the jam.
252420	254740	Don't sound too enthusiastic now.
254740	257740	Ari I skated for four hours today so I'm tired.
257740	264020	Oh my gosh well first off let me say happy belated birthday Loki.
264020	267060	Your birthday was yesterday for those that may not know.
267060	270980	So you got to go skating for your birthday or was that just a treat for the kids?
270980	275460	Oh my gosh it's it's everything's always a treat for the kids.
275460	280220	Did you at least get to have a good meal or something for your birthday?
280220	283740	We got Tahoe Joes to go and they were an hour late.
283740	288260	Oh my gosh.
288260	293420	There's only one person working the the register it's not really a register I guess but like
293420	299420	and then she didn't put the whole order in the system because apparently their web system
299460	303100	doesn't talk to their POS system and so they had to manually put stuff in there.
303100	305100	So it's a POS.
305100	313100	Exactly and so it was a mess they were they were slow and stuff and then it was then they're
313100	320100	the way they cook their steaks it's like medium or more well there's never like a medium rare
320100	325220	because of the way they I don't know they cook them in an oven or something and this
325220	328480	is certainly on the well side unfortunately so.
328480	331840	Sounds good to me I'm that freak that likes a well done steak.
331840	333960	What's wrong with you?
333960	338200	Where do you want me to start?
338200	341360	So yeah otherwise it was all right yeah that's fine.
341360	345120	All right well happy birthday and I was I was saying this on Twitter but if you want
345120	348920	to show Loki a little love for his birthday follow him on YouTube and while you're at
348920	352680	it follow Dark Soccer and I on Twitch we all it's not our birthdays but it will be at some
352680	355560	point so follow us.
355560	358280	I actually am planning on doing a sub-a-thon.
358280	361040	Oh that'll be fun.
361040	366860	Yeah I actually got a little bit inspired by a couple other friends doing their their
366860	373040	sub-a-thons and I especially like what Maru did with his.
373040	377240	I don't know who that is but I assume a good person yeah.
377240	382840	Yeah which honestly enough I'm actually friends on Dead by Daylight with Anjaina now.
382840	386880	Oh yeah because some of those drag queens from Drag Race do yeah I mean especially during
386880	392580	COVID when performances weren't as you know prevalent so well yeah but Anjaina is a total
392580	400880	sweetheart so actually it's because of them that I might play survivor oh good finally
400880	406640	yay I'm excited to see how that goes maybe I was like are you considering doing cosplay
406640	413720	because shout out to our mutual buddy Isaaco was doing a Resident Evil Village Lady Dimitrescu
413720	417900	cosplay it was so fabulous I don't know if he's still going he's no he's still going
417900	422260	he's only about halfway through the game oh gosh and he's been saying Isaaco is not streaming
422260	427420	today it's all Lady D not that I encourage people to switch the channel but you can open
427420	431400	up a new tab and take a look because I thought it was definitely definitely lurk in Isaaco's
431400	436020	channel Isaaco is a sweetheart I think we should give a shout out I mean honestly though
436020	443160	it's it's abs and Isaaco pops into my channel sometimes just another sweetheart and and
443160	449460	of course his roommate Nick and Prince yeah so lots of great people we've been finding
449460	454460	on Twitch through this silly little game that's for sure absolutely absolutely but um but
454460	460840	at any rate I kind of am getting a little bit inspired and I want to do something I
460840	467840	guess to give back to people who've been with me you know helping my my channel go
467840	472480	you know and so I kind of want to do something entertaining for people um it'll probably
472480	479160	be on a day that I can actually legit do a marathon so stay tuned all right uh meanwhile
479160	484640	um oh I should I should mention um uh since everybody asked uh I'm back from Dragon Con
484640	492720	I was no what I was at uh Dragon why are you still in Atlanta uh it was uh Dragon Con
492720	497080	was interesting this year you know um obviously it was COVID and you know a lot of people
497080	499920	had concerns about that people didn't want to go because they didn't feel safe which
499920	505000	is fine everybody has to make their own decisions um it was a little bit surreal um because
505000	509760	and this is a good thing everybody was masked and people were incorporating into their cosplays
509760	514240	and things like that which was super cute um but you know again you know for being in
514240	517540	the middle of Georgia which you know might have a reputation in the south one way or
517540	522220	the other about mask usage or mask compliance the good news is that Dragon Con was very
522220	527720	good in that department um I did test for COVID after I got back um a couple days after
527720	531480	the con to try to give it enough time I was negative so I was very thankful about that
531480	537600	um and um yeah it's uh even though it was a weird year like just for my own like mental
537600	543240	health getting to see people interact with people be extroverted and do the panels again
543240	546840	which were well received and thank you to anybody that showed up actually I will share
546840	551420	this with you guys and shout out and I'm so sorry I forgot your name in the moment but
551420	556240	somebody came to one of the panels on the digital media track that I was doing and he
556240	560680	actually came up after the panel and was like hey I just wanted to say hi I've been listening
560680	565640	to you guys I first found you guys in middle school and I'm thinking this guy's like gotta
565640	570280	be in his late 20s you know it was an age check he said I found you guys in middle school
570280	575200	and just I recently rediscovered you guys and I just wanted to say thank you so so passing
575200	579440	it he's and it was funny because we had talked about on this panel that there are a lot of
579440	584400	people who will lurk and they don't necessarily interact with the show and that's fine we
584400	589000	volume them them too and he kind of admitted I'm one of those people I'm I never have sent
589000	592580	an email or joined live or anything like that but I listen almost every week and I really
592580	595400	appreciate what you guys are doing and that you've kept the show going through COVID and
595400	601920	all that so I was that was a that was a big hug and and the the fuel I need to keep going
601920	607400	for another 20 years you know so it was good it's good so I thought I'd share that with
607400	612200	you guys that there is there's there's love for OLR out there for sure not just live here
612200	616400	on Sunday nights in our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at the
616400	621320	voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network vog network six o'clock pacific nine
621320	626520	o'clock eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show and Mike Deft is in chat poking
626520	631180	fun at something I put on twitch this week saying excuse me not twitch twitter saying
631180	636940	Rob isn't in Atlanta isn't he replacing Bobby okay so I went to Dragon Con but I stayed
636940	642680	an extra night after Dragon Con because the airport is less fucky on a Tuesday than it
642680	648860	is on Labor Day so I stayed at you know Manor Black Wolf for an extra night and of course
648860	653260	I had to go see his studio in his setup I'd seen it before but I guess the computer isn't
653260	658020	usually there anything so long story short I took a picture in Bobby Black Wolf setup
658020	662620	so it looked like I was now hosting the Bobby Black Wolf show and I made a very tongue-in-cheek
662620	667420	tweet that said Bobby has been replaced on the show you know something like that that
667420	671980	wasn't meant to be taken seriously but you guys want to hear a hilarious punchline his
671980	676780	mom texted him like three hours later going I just read on Twitter that you're leaving
676780	684620	your show what happened I felt so bad I wasn't I was trying to punk people like SSJ 100 Matt
684620	688620	and Mike Deft and Tiger Claw, Dark Tetsuya, all the loyals that have been here for so
688620	692520	long all of you I was trying to punk that crowd I wasn't trying to punk Bobby's mom
692520	698360	sorry sorry Mrs. Black Wolf sorry sorry anyway but uh yeah so Dragon Con was great thank
698360	701480	you if anybody has discovered the show because of some of my appearances there what have
701480	706520	you I had a great time and I'm I'm really hoping to be back next year let's let's hope
706520	712240	things go on a positive trend when it comes to COVID and we can welcome more people back
712240	718120	to Dragon Con next year fingers and toes crossed let's get into our kickoff topic though let's
718120	722120	get into some games and something a lot of people have been talking about from this week
722120	728240	some big news Loki if I feel like we kind of got the PlayStation E3 event this week
728240	732520	pretty much yeah it's a little bit late but that I mean COVID COVID fucked everything
732520	737960	up so what is time anymore so this was the PlayStation's showcase where they showed off
737960	744040	a bunch of new trailers for a bunch of brand new games lots and lots of stuff to go over
744040	749560	so starting off we have of course they announced the Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic
749560	755080	remake that is coming to PlayStation 5 isn't that ironic when the first one was an Xbox
755080	761000	exclusive on consoles it is but yeah I mean they gotta have something so you know yeah
761000	767300	so that's the thing that's coming we've got spider-man 2 announced which looks pretty
767300	772800	awesome because that kind of mixes Miles Morales in there as well and then they also hinted
772800	778020	that venom is gonna be in there I would like to commend Sony and insomniac for not making
778020	786060	the easy play on to spider-man's on spider-man to spider-man's you know spider-man I I'm
786060	791740	just I don't think yeah no I'm thankful they didn't along with insomniac working on that
791740	797140	game as well we have a brand new game that they announced which is for Wolverine so that
797140	805500	yeah as well that you want yep we got a video for God of War Ragnarok so that looked pretty
805500	814140	sweet as well this game called project Eve which is kind of like almost reminded me a
814140	825460	little bit of like Nier automata or diet Bayonetta was the vibe I got yeah yeah so that's the
825460	831060	thing that's coming to PlayStation 5 as well we had a new trailer for tiny tiny Tina's
831060	836460	wonderlands which now has guns so it's even more border lands ish but it's still different
836460	841420	that looks interesting as a show 100 Matt and chat says I'm really hyped for that tiny Tina
841420	847100	thing gonna be the hex and for Borderlands you know I gotta say same and I was interested in
847100	851580	it from the first little tease they did it was the game awards or something a while back they
851580	856220	did that first tease and I was like you know I don't super get into Borderlands I don't dislike
856220	861220	it I've played a little bit of one and two but I'm really curious about this one I think the
861220	867020	setting is so much more interesting to me so I got to check it out we haven't the announcement
867020	873820	that the uncharted legacy of these collection is coming to PC as well as PlayStation 5 which I
873820	879660	think was kind of hinted at before we got a trailer for game called four spoken which was
879660	885100	kind of that project it was like yeah it was the game that they were kind of shown like the tech
885140	891020	demo stuff for PlayStation 5 with so that was way different now though but like in a good way like
891020	896060	it really like you can see the progress made and I get that that is definitely something that's on
896060	900060	my radar that game looked incredible have you seen anything with that dark soccer that project
900060	905060	athea nope or I'm sorry now it's called four spoken I can't want to call its all name look
905060	910020	it up when you can it looks really awesome take a look at the trailer it's cool okay I have like
910180	920740	limited PlayStation 5 exclusive with that as well the Alan Wake remaster yeah I hope that the baby
920740	927620	thing is less annoying I sadly I think the baby thing is still there but they they do have the
927620	933300	licensed music is all coming back and that made me so happy the only thing that's not coming back
933300	938740	is the awkward sponsorships from like energizer and Verizon that stuff's not in there now do you
938740	945380	know when when Dan was playing through that the whole baby thing I would just leave the house yeah
945380	952220	I could not stand it sadly they're not gonna change the plot or anything like that well no I
952220	958460	just mean that they should do something different or have an option for something different because
958460	966260	that sound is just really really terrible well with it coming to PC that's gonna mean mods so
966260	973260	where the the remedy games may not deliver modders might so I cuz I bet you're not the only one
973260	977500	annoyed by that so something that's changed what if they want them mod it to be the Nelson laugh
977500	984620	let's change it to watch it to was it a Randy Macho Man Savage like they did in Skyrim that's
984620	994580	what he's a teen shouting Jason instead yes all these all these great ideas yes ghost wire Tokyo
994580	1000060	looks crazy so they have a new trailer for that it's been delayed to next year but but it looked
1000060	1009500	good off the wall crazy rockstar games has done the unimaginable they the bold brand-new IP
1009500	1017460	Grand Theft Auto 5 is coming to PlayStation 5 will actually delayed to March 2022 I'm with so
1017460	1028420	many changes to it like so innovative it's so so innovative it's so risky exactly did you see my
1028420	1033420	sassy tweet on that is that I hope that there's a collaboration between Grand Theft Auto 5 and
1033420	1041700	Skyrim in the near future so that they can release those fucking games again you know the thing
1041700	1046420	though like with the five like all like even the stuff that was in the trailer like all they're
1046420	1050940	like kind of bullet points of like what's different or not they've been in the game
1050940	1055420	forever like when they're talking about you like instantly switch between characters that's been
1055420	1062660	there since like PlayStation 3 but it's it's instant because it's faster it's more instantly
1062660	1068820	but you can do that now on PC with an instant hot coffee oh wait it's a consider you know so they
1068820	1074500	have that or like explosive action there were explosions and all the other games I don't
1075500	1081220	don't try to tell me explosions are new to Grand Theft Auto they are new to Grand Theft Auto like
1081220	1088220	more explicit is it explosion error I mean I don't understand and oh and then of course Grand Theft
1088220	1092980	Auto online not to forget that I mean they certainly won't want to like shove that down
1092980	1098180	your throat or anything so that's coming we had a new trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy which
1098180	1107300	looked okay I'm a thing called a kid Amisgna or was a kid it and oh the Radiohead thing yeah that
1107300	1112660	was interesting that took me back Radiohead yeah there's like a Radiohead heck yeah the album like
1112660	1120300	Kid A they're turning into some digital experience it was very vague oh I'm down I don't even care
1120300	1125980	I'm down I'll check it out I like like Radiohead was a big thing in like college for me like that
1125980	1132180	album the Benz that got me through a lot in college but the Benz okay computer yeah okay
1132180	1138700	and Pablo like the Benz okay computer and Pablo honey were like my rotation yeah this this is
1138700	1150780	definitely made for 40-somethings I feel I'm sorry I feel like it's the Super Nintendo and they just
1150780	1158300	released a Led Zeppelin game like or a no a Pink Floyd game that's yeah that's what I feel actually
1158300	1166100	a little bit more accurate might be sort of like an ELO game it's Zanna do the game sorry Logie
1166100	1172740	all right Grand Theft Auto are not great though Gran Turismo 7 has a release date now coming March
1172740	1182420	4th 2022 yep it's Gran Turismo I mean I'm less excited about that than I am with like Forza
1182420	1188300	Horizon 5 so I'm Blood Hunt got a new trailer that's kind of PlayStation 5 as well there's
1188300	1194180	this game called Chichiya or yeah Chiya I don't know how you pronounce it they look pretty awesome
1194180	1202860	it's like a kind of a cartoony adventure game and then I guess Rainbow Six is finally jumping
1202860	1209220	well not finally jumping the shark again with Rainbow Six extraction which is basically your
1209220	1218340	fire team going against aliens now so there's aliens in Rainbow Six that's coming out in January
1218340	1231180	all righty um yeah that's pretty much it lots of stuff I mean very packed yeah it was some it was
1231180	1237380	a lot of stuff um I you know nothing that made me go oh I gotta go get a PlayStation 5 today
1237380	1242940	which by the way I'm gonna do it quick and yeah well yeah I can't and I want to do a quick tangent
1242940	1247100	real quick because some very important news broke while we were out for two weeks and I need to
1247100	1250940	update you guys on the situation because it is gonna affect my gaming weeks for some time to
1250940	1261500	come I don't know if y'all heard but my favorite band of all time is really a new album out after
1261500	1266700	these songs already yes the first two singles are out and it sounds like the 70s which is funny
1266700	1271780	because the B side and we're talking about ABBA the B side sounds more like old-school ABBA the
1271780	1275620	don't let me down sounds more like old-school ABBA than the other one because the other one
1275620	1280260	sounded like grandma singing me a bedtime song but I mean that no but I mean that in the best
1280260	1285140	possible way like I know fucking adorable like I just like I know what you mean so here's the
1285140	1290300	better like the B side better so yeah the B side was great so they're doing this whole thing with
1290300	1294780	the ABBA thing that they're gonna do like a Vegas style show but in London and they're doing
1294780	1300340	holograms and all this stuff right so it's gonna be hologram ABBA at this thing that's actually in
1300340	1306860	the Olympic Park Park in London what Jamie Loki you guys may not know yet while I was at Dragon
1306860	1311500	Con a friend oh no I posted on Facebook so you probably did see our friend melody bought me
1311500	1319100	tickets to go see the ABBA show on my 44th birthday in London what so Alan and I are gonna go and I
1319100	1324940	talked to Alan about it and we decided we will scale some even though we have some big finance
1324940	1329980	stuff on the horizon which I haven't really talked about on the show but I will soon I have the thing
1330780	1335700	we thought you know what between some raises at work the fact that we've been saving money
1335700	1342180	pretty well London's gonna happen next year so for any of our listeners overseas I need to hear
1342180	1346100	from people in London because I I'm like trying to look at like where should the hotel be what
1346100	1351060	should I don't fucking know what I'm doing so I would love to hear from our audience over there
1351060	1358340	on any tips but that is so late June next year is when my birthday is June 26th which is funny
1358380	1364260	because that means the 20th anniversary of this program but I'm gonna try to schedule it so it's
1364260	1370340	right before I leave so that way it doesn't interfere with things too much so yeah but anyway
1370340	1375860	I say that because and yes this relates to gaming one of the things I had to say was okay I'm not
1375860	1381820	gonna get a PlayStation 5 this year that'll help roll the money into you know those expensive plane
1381820	1387460	tickets to London so but I'm really excited you know and as much as I joke about it's for ABBA
1387860	1393220	and don't get me wrong it is for ABBA it's it's fucking time for us to go across the Atlantic like
1393220	1399380	neither neither of us have ever done it I'm we've never been on a big trip like that if you could
1399380	1404340	see our other friend Rob I I would love to see our other friend Rob I in fact that's one of the
1404340	1409660	people I hope to hear from but yeah and and folks over there but it's one of those things if COVID
1409660	1415460	has taught us anything it's like we need to just fucking do it so there you go it's gonna happen
1415620	1421460	all right um let's see yeah I'm looking at comments in chat thank you for the positive
1421460	1427140	affirmations there in chat so and SJ 100 Matt no this isn't Rob a baba that's a diff that's
1427140	1432660	an emailer is Rob a baba who I think lives in the Midwest I want to say Ohio but with a giant
1432660	1439020	question mark sorry Rob a baba but this is raw what's what's his online name I know his real
1439020	1443820	last name but I was shouted on it has to do with his last name okay then I'm not gonna say it but
1443860	1452820	there's there's overseas Rob is different yeah okay all right anyway um so I'm sorry where do
1452820	1456380	we leave off in the PlayStation Showcase before Rob went on an Abba tangent that was very important
1456380	1464820	we got everything oh oop so dark chakra do you see you said you saw some stuff in there that
1464820	1469300	looked cool like the Wolverine thing yeah pretty much the Wolverine thing in the radio head thing
1469300	1476740	yeah yeah there's a lot of good stuff in there I I you know I'll be sad to probably miss
1476740	1481940	fourspoken when it releases but I look forward to checking it out I'll probably finally get like
1481940	1486680	after London next year I'll finally get the PlayStation 5 I'd say by next holiday because
1486680	1491500	if there's any truth to this Final Fantasy thing also happening next summer although I don't really
1491500	1498980	believe it I obviously have to get a PlayStation 5 for next summer so by the way also one of the
1498980	1505300	things I've agreed to wave to make London happen is that the Tron machine I'm gonna forgo if it's
1505300	1512100	above a certain amount which I think it probably will be so we'll see anyway all right enough
1512100	1515700	about the PlayStation Showcase I hope you all saw some great games and some things to get excited
1515700	1520820	about let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games we've been playing this week
1520820	1530140	dark soccer we'll start with you how was your gaming week um it was dead by daylight lots of
1530140	1540140	dead by daylight um I also picked up a game hold on let me open my steam I picked up slay the spire
1540140	1546980	oh yeah I see that get one get streamed a lot yeah I was watching Isaac oh play it and it
1546980	1553540	actually looked like a lot of fun and I figured it's time for something new and I've also picked
1553540	1564820	up a couple of other games on Steam just in the interim I I actually won a $10 steam card in in
1564820	1571340	another in another chat and so I redeemed like some a couple little games so I just I'm trying
1571340	1575420	to pull up my steam which is now like taking five years to connect so I can remember what
1575420	1579940	all that holds up I was gonna ask you quickly about your thoughts on pinhead and dead by
1579940	1585460	daylight like do you do you like so killer or you know help I haven't played him yet I haven't
1585460	1590940	played him yet or I guess they're referring to him as the cenobite yeah you know we all know
1590940	1601460	game yeah yeah so at any rate um I haven't played him yet I like him I I have seen him in the PTB
1601460	1611380	and which is the play test build for those who don't know I have also seen him since PTB and
1611380	1619860	here are my thoughts I believe that they've done a lot to balance him from the PTB and in the PTB
1619860	1626620	he was glitchy as fuck I'm just saying he was glitchy I have some fun clips saved from other
1626620	1637740	people's streams like having like like his Maury is great and very faithful to to the films and it
1637740	1643740	actually looks a lot better now and again for those who don't know a killer can get an item
1643740	1650260	and an offering called the memento Maury that they can basically just kill somebody with without
1650260	1658620	sacrificing them so but anyway it's very very faithful but the thing that I do not like is that
1658620	1666180	the the voices are gone because it used to be and there's something about that by the way this is
1666180	1673180	what I heard but in the PTB like it there's a mechanic in there where you solve the lament
1673180	1679260	configuration I don't know if anyone has seen the movie we can just leave it at that yeah yeah
1680140	1688620	but at any rate he goes you know when someone solves the box then he says you've opened the
1688620	1696180	box and I came you know line straight from the movie and there were some other other lines that
1696180	1702580	were there and those got removed because apparently the lines were causing some sort of glitching
1703140	1711100	like I'm wondering if it's maybe because of the code that runs everything that's audio in
1711100	1715420	Dead by Daylight is because of their spaghetti code that has been more and more postified over
1715420	1723780	the last five years of the game's existence it's it's absolutely yeah but in any rate there are
1723780	1731540	they released also the cosmetics for him with the live build and from what I understand by the way
1731540	1745340	playing him is sort of like a combination of playing nurse and and hag kinda at least that
1745340	1753700	was my impression because you can use like a I know and twins nurse and twins which I suck at
1753700	1764060	and I hate twins because you can actually use the box to cast a chain that you follow like it's its
1764060	1774780	own its own player right so yeah at any rate so going back to it there's been a few a few little
1774780	1785500	glitchy things but the mechanics seem to be a lot better ironed out and then Gideon the game level
1785500	1796380	the Gideon's meat plant from saw and dead dog saloon and RuPaul's drag department or sorry
1796380	1803860	RuPaul's police station Raccoon Police Department have all been taken down but now Gideon's is back
1803860	1809420	up with I think they had a graphic overhaul on it I didn't really notice much at the time either
1809420	1815820	but they do have the new pallets the new graphics for the pallets and whatnot in in the game is
1815820	1822300	pretty good but dead dog is still down and I think dead dog is also going through a graphic overhaul
1822300	1829100	and actually no I know what was going on with dead dog okay and this is hilarious far down the dead
1829100	1832860	by daylight rabbit hole because not everybody plays it so quickly okay well I've only got two
1832860	1838260	things yeah so what would happen okay there's a move where a survivor can come out of a locker
1838260	1846980	and knock a killer back and it's called head-on what was happening is that when head-on hit a
1846980	1856780	killer in the dead dog level it would shoot them outside of the map like out of bounds hmm like
1856820	1868420	cartoon style it's hilarious so yeah so that went down well I mean not for the survivors I guess
1868420	1877580	but and then RPD had an exploit in it where there's a place that survivors could clip and
1877580	1883020	make it out of bounds and then run to a certain area and automatically escape the level oh yikes
1883260	1890460	um yeah and so RPD was taken down to have that fixed and so that is the state of dead by daylight
1890460	1895260	maybe I should just make that a report the state of definitely did you did you find those games on
1895260	1901820	steam you were referring to earlier no I didn't that's right but um but I do know that I did pick
1901820	1908580	up slay the spire and I'm gonna give it a go see I'm still playing through Oh Fantasian I'm still
1908580	1914660	playing through Fantasian oh and I finished my yeah I finished my grindy bit and I'm going to
1914660	1923820	be moving on to doing the next quest so on Tuesdays 630 I will be playing Fantasian nice and I like to
1923820	1929420	say it in the mean girls way on Tuesday we play Fantasian all right let's go to Loki and your
1929420	1937620	gaming week it's been minecraft been playing lots of Minecraft did lots of big projects in the game
1938340	1945300	working on filming for that that content and then um yeah she'll be putting out something
1945300	1953140	soon for that because yeah I built a huge drowned farm which was a challenge and then
1955860	1960420	they have some other farms in a shop it's like I'm running tons of shops on the server now because
1960420	1966100	people keep abandoning their stores in fact we just added like a brand new discord channel
1966100	1972100	where it's all these shops that are being sold because people just not coming back
1973700	1979540	that's fun um and then of course uh yesterday I took a break from playing Minecraft to
1980180	1987620	do a little bit of game dev so I finally after progressing for months um finished my update to
1987620	1994580	pixel poops number two that I wanted to do so that's revision b which is out now um on uh itch
1994580	2000100	io and it should be out on steam pretty soon it adds 10 new levels there's two new playable
2000100	2005700	character models and a less punishing continue system so no longer will you have to restart the
2005700	2010020	whole world when you die in the level you'll actually be able to restart the level you died on
2010020	2016740	so um hopefully it'll make it a little bit easier but yeah so that that's out free hooray you already
2016740	2021940	bought it or it's you know available now and that's probably gonna be the version that gets
2021940	2026900	put on the cartridges at some point all right shout out for pixel poop number two on itch io
2026900	2032580	uh and steam nice yep congrats all right uh my gaming week I had to take notes I've played so
2032580	2037380	much this week I'll try to keep it brief though I'll do my best yeah I played a crap ton of stuff
2037380	2042260	this week so I got to try a playstation 5 for the first time um while I was staying at manor
2042260	2046980	blackwolf uh he has that very nice setup in his basement um and so I finally got to try a
2046980	2052820	playstation 5 for the first time uh and I got to do the astro bot that as astro's playroom I'm
2052820	2055940	sorry I forgot the name of the game in the moment I'm sure somebody in chat will shout it out
2055940	2060580	um but um I got he wanted to like show me like the controller and how that whole thing kind of
2060580	2065940	worked and it is neat I was playing this one level where you kind of had to like like climb up uh
2065940	2070340	and those that have played the game like climb up a rock wall and it's got a neat little mechanic to
2070340	2075780	it um uh yeah and sj100 matt and chad says astro's playroom is a really cool tech demo yeah it is
2075780	2079700	that was a cute little fun game to play and it really showed off how that controller is great
2079700	2082660	and then of course the other game I wanted to play on his playstation 5 I was like show me
2082660	2087060	no man's sky because I played that game way too much and I wanted to see how the rumble
2087060	2090820	fit into that as well and it was it was neat I see why people are really into the controller
2090820	2095780	like I don't I don't think I'm like oh my god I'm missing everything by having an xbox instead
2095780	2101300	but I I get it it's cute tech uh and uh when I finally get around to getting a playstation 5
2101300	2106820	uh I'll I'll appreciate that tech as well um so that was that was time in black wolf theater
2106820	2112340	playing those games uh when I got home speaking of no man's sky expedition 3 and no man's sky
2112340	2117140	started so I've been streaming a little bit of that I streamed some on uh was it thursday and
2117140	2121540	friday yeah because I was a little bit sick yesterday uh so I didn't really stream yesterday
2121540	2126340	and then uh I didn't stream today because I've just I've run out of time um so uh but I will
2126340	2130740	stream again tomorrow I've been starting expedition 3 and by the way for those that were watching the
2130740	2134340	stream we were talking about does it end monday or tuesday and folks are telling me it goes
2134340	2141940	through tuesday it does but it's tuesday at 6 a.m pacific 9 a.m eastern so there monday tomorrow
2141940	2148580	night will be the last um chance to get twitch drops uh that are happening um as well so um
2149540	2155140	yeah the no man's sky expedition has been going very well it's weird because now you play it all
2155140	2162580	on one planet um and you uh don't uh get to really leave that planet it's all part of uh
2162580	2166260	what the expedition is about and it's not a very kind planet either but you start with some
2166260	2170500	protection so it's interesting it's it shows some different elements of the game and refreshes
2170500	2176420	things it is also interesting that the expedition has nothing to do with the frontiers patch they
2176420	2182180	put out I was full on expecting there to be like the whole like uh you know society thing that they
2182180	2186660	started building in the towns and stuff that's not in it which i thought was interesting um so
2186660	2192660	i'll have to uh explore that elsewhere um bobby is uh mentioning in chat some additional things
2192660	2198660	that i checked out at his house yes there was the eufy dlc for final fantasy 7 i got to play maybe
2198660	2205780	the first i don't know hour or so that dlc um so that was cool to experience um it's it was done
2205780	2210180	very well it was it was hard for me to reacclimate to final fantasy 7 because i haven't i haven't
2210180	2214820	played the remake in a year um but it felt very good on playstation 5 and it looked very good
2214820	2221540	um so um you know i'll pick that up as soon as i get a ps5 um for sure um but i didn't i didn't
2221540	2225300	you know we only did like maybe the first little section of it i didn't you know play too far to
2225300	2229620	get to any major story stuff or anything like that how's the voice acting for her it's good
2229620	2233940	yeah it's continuous the game's had a strong voice cast and i'd say that continues for her
2234500	2238100	uh and then bobby does mention this yes i guess i should i should mention that i didn't have it
2238100	2244580	written down but i should mention uh he has that mandalorian table i played it and i did beat one
2244580	2250980	of his high scores now so he's a little bit like he shows up to my house and beats my high score
2250980	2258020	but we need to clarify i didn't beat the high score i beat one of those categories of high
2258020	2262180	scores because it keeps different you beat a mode yeah i beat a mode or something like that i think
2262180	2267060	it was like one of the mini games i got the highest score in a particular mini game so um
2267060	2272580	yeah there was that but um his his arcade and stuff like you know i'll defer to his show for
2272580	2277460	him to tell you all about that stuff but i did get to see him his little arcade room is super cute
2277460	2280980	like it's all black light it's got the carpet it's got the arcade one-up cabinets and there's
2280980	2286260	definitely room for more in there um cool dark soccer if you ever get out to man or black wolf
2286260	2290580	i think you'd appreciate his setup and then you'd be like if this was mine i'd have this here this
2290580	2297860	here this here this here but it was nice setup yeah well things things may work out next year um
2297860	2305060	be awesome just saying all right um let's see continuing on my gaming week final fantasy 13
2305060	2312340	hit uh xbox game pass finally on uh xbox uh series x and all that stuff i think it's might be pc as
2312340	2318100	well but i'm i'm only really focused on the console i really wanted to check this out because if you
2318100	2324500	missed it when final fantasy 13 became backwards compatible they actually did some up rezzing from
2324500	2330340	like the masters of um the cutscenes in the game and what i kind of learned from playing through
2330340	2337220	it um the textures look great the characters look great i almost feel like i'm playing an hd
2337220	2342020	remaster of the game now i don't want to get expectations too high because there are some
2342020	2347460	things that still definitely show their age a little bit like the ui but i was really impressed
2347460	2352020	by how good final fantasy 13 looks now and i think that game is really underrated in the
2352020	2360340	final fantasy series and now that i'm playing it again i see so many clues about a big plot twist
2360340	2365620	that comes up way later in the story that really changes the context of one of the characters there
2365620	2370980	are so many hints in the beginning of the game that i that like spell it out and it's one of
2370980	2374980	those you don't know unless you're looking for it and i thought that was very clever uh so anyway
2374980	2382340	i'm having fun with fantasy 13 um i played the warrior where demo i liked it now i know the full
2382340	2385700	game came out i haven't picked it up yet just because i've been occupied with a bunch of other
2385700	2390260	stuff i will pick it up in this next week i like the demo you didn't like it right loki
2391460	2397220	no i thought it was okay okay i didn't care for it no i bought the game my son beat it already
2397220	2401380	oh wow yeah i remember you saying that your son beat it really quickly yeah like he beat
2401380	2407220	he beat the whole game and like i i bought it on like friday evening and he beat it saturday
2407220	2413060	morning so it's like it's short um bobby blackwolf in chat says i'm the one who didn't care for the
2413060	2416580	demo no i a lot of people didn't care for the demo i felt like i was the only one that like
2416580	2423940	was like oh i like okay i like i i i understand the twist in the game um there's some like neat
2423940	2427860	modes and stuff that they have where you can lock like a battle mode where you're basically fighting
2427860	2433140	all the different characters almost like smash brothers sort of uh which is kind of neat um
2434500	2439620	i don't know i kind of like the old mario or the warrior games where like it's just like one type
2439620	2444500	of game and you just play the different themes and stuff not necessarily like oh i'll play it
2444500	2448100	as this character or i'll play it as this character and it plays differently each time
2448100	2454980	it's the i don't know it just gets you have to get used to it i guess but it's fine it's still fun
2454980	2458900	i will check out the full game this week i've just been that no man's sky thing kind of
2458900	2463380	blindsided me and i've been focused on that uh pretty much a lot of my gaming all right two
2463380	2469140	games left on my list um one of them i'm gonna give a shout out super metroid oh yes i played
2469140	2474580	super Metroid this week because on the flight home fired up my switch went into the super
2474580	2478420	Nintendo and i'm like what game do i what game could take me about four hours to play
2478420	2482260	and i played super metro but i only played super Metroid for maybe about an hour and a half
2482260	2487860	and i can't i can't speed run it yet it's been a long time since i played it but um i was having
2487860	2494500	a good time with it memories good times all right oh rob here's the last game on my list and i'm i'm
2494500	2501300	so mad about this but i can't resist these games the last game i've spent way too much time playing
2501300	2510820	this week is cookie clicker because no girl yes cookies girl here's the thing they did this game
2510820	2517700	is like 10 years old right but they just released it on steam and there are there are seriously like
2517700	2523860	300 achievements in it uh and all this other stuff and it's just you know you pay it's in it it's
2523860	2527460	silly because you're paying five dollars for what is free but it's also nice to support the
2527460	2532420	developers and they put a soundtrack for the Minecraft guy so it is a little weird to hear
2532420	2537140	like a Minecraft song because it's it's straight up a song out of Minecraft it's weird to hear that
2537140	2542420	while you're playing cookie clicker but it's not it's certainly not bad um and uh yeah and i've
2542420	2548900	i've been obsessed it's like if you look at the vog network discord it's gonna show on the right
2548900	2553060	hand side rob roberts is playing cookie clicker right now because yes it's idling on the other
2553060	2558660	computer in the other room right now so i can have more cookies when i get back so i can cast
2558660	2566100	my spells to generate more cookies on my way to uh having an empire of uh grandmas and all the
2566100	2571060	things that go into cookie clicker um if you don't know this game um that's probably a good
2571060	2576180	thing i'm not going to tell you anything about it so you can stay the hell away no uh it's it's an
2576180	2581700	idle clicker game that y'all probably remember the idle clicker it is the well one of two i would say
2581700	2587380	the other one was the one i talked about like six or seven years ago when it was on playstation 4
2587380	2592100	clicker heroes was the other one i was obsessed with for a long time yeah so i would say those
2592100	2598020	two are like the idle clicker games and there's there i'm sure every discord will light up this
2598020	2602980	week with other people mentioning idle clicker games they like it's a genre of games the idle
2602980	2609780	clicker game um and uh yeah the cookie clicker is like the classic and it's available on steam now
2609780	2616340	so shout out to them getting it out on steam and uh a whole nother stupid game for me to get into
2616340	2620420	but i'm having fun all right sorry i know i took up way too much time but that was my list i had
2620420	2625380	a lot on my list all right let's get to some other gaming news quickly though quickly um
2625380	2630340	before we get into more news i have to mention i'm like legally obligated and required to as somebody
2630340	2636260	who is an affiliate on twitch here uh with vog network it is sub timber here on twitch and that
2636260	2643860	means uh subs are a little bit cheaper i believe uh please click 20 yeah 20 off your first time sub
2643860	2649220	or gift subs are 20 off as well and i did see some folks donating subs earlier so thank you very much
2649220	2655060	for that super appreciated we'll shout those out after the recording as we usually do um but i
2655060	2661620	would be i would be remiss not to uh mention that subs are a little cheaper right now in those
2661620	2666500	circumstances uh if you do subscribe uh here at vog network which you're not required to do
2666500	2671140	obviously we don't paywall uh anything with our podcast that we've done for the last 20 years
2671140	2676340	but if you want to see the video on demand the vods that is something kind of new as of a couple
2676340	2681300	of years ago that is behind the paywall uh as well as some bonus videos uh for example if you
2681300	2687540	want to see us reacting to episode one we're on episode 883 tonight if you want to see dark soccer
2687540	2693540	loki and myself reacting to episode one a couple months ago uh you can actually check that out um
2695060	2700100	in the archives so and i just i just saw more subs go out there thank you thank you bobby
2700100	2704980	blackwell yeah i'll give out more uh shout outs later on so thank you thank you um all right
2705940	2709540	enough of that let's get into gaming news loki we'll start with you tonight
2710660	2716260	ah yes um along with the whole announcement of all these wonderful games coming to the
2716260	2721460	playstation 5 and whatnot sony also announced that hey you know that free ride we've been
2721460	2725780	giving you with all those playstation 4 to playstation 5 upgrades well it ain't free
2725780	2731540	anymore we're gonna charge you ten dollars for it which is dumb it really is dumb like
2731540	2737300	especially when you consider that games on the xbox you know you can play them on xbox one you
2737300	2744580	can play them on the xbox series consoles you play them on pc for the same price it makes no sense
2744580	2750260	but that's they want to charge extra money just like was it madden and stuff like that charging
2750260	2756660	for their next gen versions like 79 they want to charge another 10 for those upgrades um
2757220	2762980	um yeah i don't know so basically saying you know i also want to confirm that moving forward today
2762980	2768900	uh playstation first party exclusive cross-gen titles including uh will both digital and physical
2768900	2774660	or offer a ten dollar um digital upgrade option from place digit for the playstation 5 this will
2774660	2780900	apply to the next god of war and grand tourism of 7 any other cross-gen exclusive games uh published
2780900	2788660	by and uh any other cross-gen ps4 playstation 5 titles published by sodi interactive entertainment
2788660	2795300	and it should be noted this came after this whole hubaloo about horizon um not horizon zero dawn
2795300	2801940	horizon god damn it what's the name of the sequel forbidden west took me a minute and that whole
2801940	2807780	hubaloo about uh it was like it didn't were they gonna charge were they not and so they kind of
2807780	2811940	got cornered into having to give away that upgrade and i think that's what made them
2811940	2816660	say this statement is that like horizon is the last free one and from now on it's gonna cost
2816660	2821860	ten dollars for the upgrade um i think you make a damn good point about the fact that microsoft
2821860	2827860	you know very obviously doesn't really have the same stance on things um i kind of think sony
2827860	2833380	can leverage their position here a little bit and they're resting on the strength of a game like god
2833380	2838180	of war and so on that people will pay that ten dollars here's the problem though like yeah and
2838180	2843860	i get that like that they're charging now i are these games also like seventy dollar retail games
2843860	2850580	are they charging 69.99 for these as well my assumption is on ps5 yes but on ps4 no it's like
2850580	2857220	that's where the difference is there's like games and it's their choice to do that i think it's a
2857220	2862580	poor choice but like there's games like for example madden nfl that just got released with
2862580	2868900	you know the next gen prices as well and you ain't getting a next gen game it's like it's very
2868900	2873060	corners cut and stuff like that but it's these people thinking that well it's our franchise and
2873060	2877540	we we feel that you should pay seventy dollars for this game even though it's basically the same game
2877540	2882660	as each year it seems it's funny it's it's always these like sports titles you know like the nba
2882660	2888420	series um madden you know all this stuff that they seem to feel like that they should be charging for
2888420	2895460	this extra fee up front um zen monkey you can take that in consideration when you're buying
2895460	2900340	picking your consoles i guess zen monkey 11 in chat says it makes sense to me current gen games
2900340	2907300	are like 70 something bucks i think they need to let ps5 bps5 and let ps4 bps4 um you know and
2908020	2912340	i don't know it's it's hard for me to say i agree with that but at the same time i think
2912340	2916820	the reality is people are gonna grumble grumble grumble about this but they're gonna pay it
2916820	2921140	like people are not gonna vote with their wallet if they if they do i'll be pleasantly surprised
2921140	2926020	but i think people are just gonna pony up the money because i think the reality is got a war
2926020	2931220	gonna cost 60 bucks on ps4 it's gonna cost 70 bucks on ps5 so they're not gonna give you a
2931220	2935940	free pass if you buy the cheaper ps4 version you gotta pony up the difference and on that level
2936580	2942420	it does make sense you know 4k graphics and textures they ain't free uh and so forth but
2942420	2947860	i do think they are giving microsoft something to needle them at at the end of the day i will
2947860	2953220	say that i think microsoft can needle them on we don't have that price difference however i
2953220	2958500	don't think it's gonna matter because playstation still has got a war playstation still has grand
2958500	2963300	turismo and all the games that are affected by this are only games you can play on playstation
2963300	2968340	they're the playstation studio games so that's it they gotta they gotta lock on it yeah well
2969140	2973460	i mean they can do what they want me if people are willing to pay that price then i guess they
2973460	2979380	can charge that but i think it's it's silly and it does like i said sure it's not really an issue
2979380	2984820	right now because no one can get any consoles um but when it does become more available and
2984820	2990180	stuff and you're comparing you know the cost of the games on those systems granted those
2990180	2995940	exclusives are few and far between that's fine but you know especially when we've got like
2995940	3000020	microsoft purchasing all these studios there's gonna be a lot of exclusive games coming to their
3000020	3006020	console pretty soon sure it's a drought right now but like you know halo's nothing to really
3006020	3012500	you know balk at i mean you've got lots of big games coming granted yeah it's not got a war
3012500	3017780	but there's that there's their franchises over there as well i mean so and those i'm sure won't
3017780	3024180	be charging 70 per game plus you know you have games pass you could just get all that you know
3024180	3029860	with your subscription so i don't know and i was hearing them like talking about like was
3029860	3033300	it playstation now and stuff and how they're adding different games to that i'm just like
3033300	3039460	thinking yeah that's not appealing to me uh fifth dream in chat says i'm tired of sony trying to
3039460	3044260	cater to ps4 when ps5 is out too bad you haven't upgraded but that's how games have always worked
3044260	3050260	no one was demanding super nintendo games work on nes i to a point i agree with you there is a
3050260	3055620	point where sony has to leave the playstation 4 behind to really push the games on the ps5 and
3055620	3060980	the cutting edge tech here's the big problem you still can't really buy a ps5 i know i know you're
3060980	3064980	gonna y'all are gonna needle me on that point because you're gonna say i have a ps5 you had
3064980	3070660	to work to get that playstation 5 i don't think they can truly leave the playstation 4 behind
3070660	3076260	because remember gamers are not just you and me and the audience and the fandoms that would listen
3076260	3082340	to a show like this gamers are the families and the living rooms you know that are more casual
3082340	3087940	and play that type of stuff uh that you know look for these things as holiday gifts until you can
3087940	3094020	walk into target and pull a playstation 5 off the shelf and put it in your cart i'm not sure i
3094020	3099300	totally agree with the you could just upgrade when you want i don't think you can we're still having
3099300	3105940	to fight scalpers and all that stuff will this work itself out in a year i think so but i also
3105940	3112580	thought it would have fixed itself by now like i think if you go back to last year's show we're
3112580	3121860	sitting there going well by summer 2021 this won't be an issue anymore hmm so i think that's
3121860	3127220	something sony's still got to work out but at the end again i say all that and at the end of the day
3127220	3130740	i sort of go but this ten dollar none of it's gonna matter people are gonna pay it they're
3130740	3135380	gonna be fine and you know they're gonna rabble rabble and they're gonna pay it and that will
3135460	3142820	show sony that they did the right thing i guess so anyway uh just some thoughts on that okay
3143780	3148900	let me move on i want to talk about uh xbox i guess a little bit in the next story which has
3148900	3155140	to do with a controller update this is really funny because this is about the old xbox controller
3155140	3160980	and i instantly thought of when ronma called us i think it was the not the show before we but like
3160980	3166900	the show before that maybe 881 i think he called us and was talking about that he was trying to get
3166900	3172420	an xbox one controller and we were like just get the series x controller dude it's better and he's
3172420	3178900	like no i want a one controller it's what i want and one might say this news this week justifies
3178900	3186420	rama's position because a firmware update to the xbox one controller not the series x but the one
3186420	3192980	controller came out this week uh and it's out for insiders right now uh but it allows the uh
3192980	3199060	xbox one controllers to more easily paired at windows 10 ios 15 and android devices because
3199060	3203540	you know for the cloud stuff they want the um controllers to pair with the mobile devices as
3203540	3210420	well uh also um the xbox one controllers are going to get older controllers that will remember your
3210420	3217060	phone or pc so that you can switch over from a console uh and then there's also input latency
3217060	3222900	similar to what they have on the xbox series x and s is the dli is what they call that is also
3222900	3228260	coming to the xbox one controllers so if you have those controllers still sitting around you might
3228260	3234260	want to check for those upgrades uh as of the the article midweek it's only out for the insiders in
3234260	3240180	that program um but uh i'm sure this is going to roll out to a wider audience very soon and you
3240180	3245380	might actually be in the insiders program i know i am um so i'll have to update my old controllers
3245380	3250420	because you know why not uh and did your own medicine chat says by the way i got my xbox one
3250420	3255220	controller well there you go now there's a brand new firmware to put on it if you're well will you
3255220	3259860	put the new firmware on it rama i'm curious about that anyway i thought that was that that just made
3259860	3264820	me laugh especially considering that show a couple weeks ago made me laugh uh all right
3264820	3273700	let's move on dark sakura so the the thing that has been the bane of uh many a streamer the hate
3273700	3282580	raids well twitch is finally doing something about it something at least um as as a lot of
3282580	3290500	people know we had a strike on sept on september first um to protest against twitch's lack of
3290500	3302340	response um and so now uh twitch has filed a lawsuit against two of the people involved in
3302340	3311380	the hate raid um it uh it was uh their their names are only known as creatine overdose and cruise
3311380	3318180	control uh believed to be from uh austria and the netherlands respectively they have suspended and
3318180	3325220	permanently banned their accounts um and they've used alternate accounts to uh to keep going with
3325220	3333860	their hate raids and so now they um have uh been sued basically to prevent anything else from
3333860	3339780	happening and to seek some i guess some reparations about it but um the big thing that i think
3340740	3349940	a lot of us want to see is it's not just these two i mean maybe these two are the big ones behind it
3351220	3358340	but and it's a start it's a start but they need to do something to fix the potential abuse for
3358340	3365940	the system yeah um i i say this news is deserving of one clap thank you uh now let's tackle some of
3365940	3371540	the other issues that broadcasters are asking for um and you know meanwhile this news comes out and
3371540	3376340	you know you think it would shut things down i was followed by eight of those hoes while i was and i
3376340	3383620	call them hose hose the name starts hos so they're hoes so i was reading it as as hoss i know because
3383620	3388260	it's hoss but i yeah but and i realize that's probably not what they want you to call them
3388260	3392660	but you would only call somebody what they want to be called when you respect them because i don't
3392660	3395940	respect them i'm going to call them what i want to call them and they're hoes well it's okay because
3395940	3400180	everybody else has been calling them hoes anyway yeah they're hoes so eight of those hoes followed
3400180	3405460	me while i was broadcasting no man's sky and so i had to go blah blah so it's like the issue is
3405460	3411620	still going on i'm kind of surprised twitch allows you to create a name with hoes in it right now
3411620	3416340	um because they're all but i at the same time if they banned that name they just moved to
3416340	3422900	something else we all know that um well and now like i had one that was like hose something
3422900	3429860	underscore winner and then ha ha ha ha ha yeah and then the moment though that i went to because
3429860	3436660	you know i keep my channel open all the time so i get to see anyone who's followed me while i'm not
3436660	3441060	live just you know just there you know because i also go in and host a lot of other people
3441700	3448020	and i saw both of them there when i went to ban them they had already been deleted yeah so
3448020	3454660	something is happening as which you know again okay clap but it's still it's it's like not enough
3454660	3460340	you know yeah but i i you know what i will say i appreciate that they're taking the legal angle
3460340	3465700	with it and trying to sue the pants off of them and most most importantly out who they are because
3465700	3473460	these individuals when they are named they will get to own that imagery those words that hate
3474020	3480340	will be tied to those individuals and the other thing even though even if we don't have public
3480340	3485460	spanking anymore these two are going to be publicly spanked by the internet sorry dark soccer
3486100	3492820	well the other thing though that makes me think on the other side um and
3492980	3497300	it's the same thing as i mean i don't want to compare the two but it's sort of like the
3497300	3504820	publicity that a mass shooter gets or a cult leader gets okay i can see that is that it also
3504820	3516260	does lead to copycats we shouldn't be making people famous for doing shitty things okay i
3517060	3522100	okay i i can respect that side of it i mean there is a part of me that thinks
3523700	3528180	that they need there needs to be accountability you know and these two need to own it but i
3528180	3533300	completely understand the whole sometimes these people get turned into martyrs because of that
3533300	3537700	and that yeah that's that that's a valid concern but i i just i feel like there needs to be that
3537700	3542420	accountability too so where do we find that balance between making these people accountable
3542420	3547940	but not making them famous and i think that is where we have to hold the media the reporting
3547940	3552740	and all of that accountable is that when these names are ultimately outed they are only used
3552740	3559860	in a negative context in the media you know and that we instead we say we uplift the marginalized
3559860	3565860	creators that have been so attacked by these raids you know as the good guys and the hoes are
3565940	3578180	the bad guys so it's gonna be a balance i think to do this right yeah i i i definitely don't
3580020	3585860	i would rather in this case that instead of their channel names be listed even though they
3585860	3591700	are perma band that they just straight up give their name if that's gonna happen
3591700	3597540	yeah all right well to be continued i think we'll be reporting on this nearly every week
3597540	3602900	until it's resolved so we'll see all right at least though it is something i i would say i
3602900	3610020	would put this as a two clap okay one clap for the lawsuit one clap for the other thing i already
3610020	3615780	forgot oh the banning the the banning that we're noticing is happening so one one one clap for
3615780	3621620	each all right twitch has earned two claps we should have a clap counter all right anyway
3622180	3626340	uh moving on unfortunately and i don't want to i don't want to laugh because we're about to go
3626340	3634420	into another story that um is here here we go another week of this but it this is a necessary
3634420	3638900	topic especially when we talked about everything that was going on with activision blizzard king
3638900	3644020	a couple weeks ago which by the way i just want to remind everybody the demands of the employees
3644020	3651140	at activision blizzard king have still gone unresponded to but i mentioned when we talked
3651140	3659460	about that that this is a symptom of the industry not just one company and loki i think you have
3659460	3665780	some follow-up to that right yeah it's more companies so uh wargaming the community manager
3665780	3672180	has quit alleging toxic corporate culture so there's been issues with wargaming for a while
3672180	3681540	especially like even how they um treat their kind of uh i don't know why their their partners i
3681540	3687220	guess and they have decided to leave with remember there's a whole thing about um there's one of the
3687220	3692180	ships that was being given away as part of a loot box or something like that instead of being given
3692180	3696180	there's like a direct way to purchase it or something like that and you may remember that
3696180	3706660	there was um a promo code that was sent out or a code that was available that um basically uh
3707780	3714580	translated to you know uh fucking turi which turi i guess is one of the um streamers who was also
3715300	3720180	um kind of fed up with what was going on so there's like some abuse you know they were
3720180	3727540	basically targeting their partners and stuff um but basically yeah so you know these folks are
3727540	3731460	leaving since i've fortunately been given the opportunities to advance on my own career amazing
3731460	3738660	things um but they have to make the decision because of the recent termination of an employee
3738660	3744420	on my team they believe um to be a kind competent individual for a reason i personally perceive them
3744420	3750100	to be um to be an illegitimate incredibly persistent campaign to unfairly scapegoat him
3750660	3759300	by leadership so there's folks just like i guess dog piling on this employee and you know he blames
3759300	3764660	like toxic corporate culture perpetuating cycles of serious errors stretched back at least four
3764660	3772900	years well before the person's time on the team and as well as um you know his pay grade so
3773860	3781220	yeah this was uh zachary cabmec doig and um he has like a whole letter here if you want to
3781220	3785940	you know check that out but basically saying yeah if there is just some campaign to target
3785940	3792740	different people um to try to like kind of push them out so that's unfortunate that that happens
3794340	3801540	so that's one company and then uh there's another one uh talking about uh paradox
3801540	3808500	so paradoxed uh which is a swedish publisher there was a survey conducted by the swedish
3808500	3816180	unions that spoke to 133 of the 400 about 400 employees and they alleged that 44 said that
3816180	3823300	they had experienced this form of mistreatment of those surveyed 26 were women where the um
3824180	3829220	statistics were much worse they said 69 of them have experienced abusive treatment as well
3829220	3836420	so this is an international industry problem as well you know this kind of yeah definitely um
3836420	3841460	points the the finger on it would be understood like wondering if it's just like it's not even
3841460	3846100	like just the gaming industry i think in general like there could be a lot of toxic behavior out
3846100	3852020	there but it is it is the tech industry um yeah you know and gaming is is certainly a part of that
3852020	3856340	you know i i overheard a very interesting conversation alan and i went to dinner the other
3856340	3861300	night at a um a ramen place here that we really enjoy that recently opened up a huge outdoor
3861300	3866660	dining area and it felt great um but the people behind us um there were two girls that were um
3866660	3870580	students at at the local university i could tell they were talking very loud like i wasn't trying
3870580	3874500	to eavesdrop but they were i don't know a few drinks in or something they're talking very loud
3874500	3877860	and it was very interesting to hear them talk about the tech industry because i think they
3877860	3882580	were both in it or like studying to be in it and they were kind of talking about you know some of
3882660	3888660	the weird things that dudes do in the industry and you know i i you know there's that there's
3888660	3893140	that part of me that kind of wants to be like you know there's some good people too but you know you
3893140	3896820	don't want to not all men that type of conversation and it's just i think you know you get to be a fly
3896820	3905860	on a wall for a very realistic and um a perspective on things and how creepy some people can be
3905860	3914180	yeah it's unfortunate um and then of course paradox has uh responded to these allegations
3914180	3921780	saying obviously the results of the survey are deeply concerning it's like bog standard uh pr
3921780	3927300	speak there the management team wants to ensure this data is acted upon but um taking immediate
3927300	3931860	direct um action is legally difficult thanks to the informal nature of the survey
3931860	3942180	and yeah fun all right well it's unfortunate that this is continuing but at the same time
3942180	3949380	it has to be kind of like it's been happening so this stuff has to come out it has to be identified
3949380	3955060	if companies are going to put out their canned pr speak okay but it has to be called out so it
3955060	3959940	can be fixed um so again i sadly don't think it's going to end here and they're going to have more
3959940	3966340	of this so we'll see uh meanwhile let's talk about some good news i think with the studio
3966340	3973060	let's talk about um the recent purchase by playstation studios of fire spite
3973060	3979860	excuse me not fire spite fire sprite uh fire sprite is the studio that made playroom uh the
3979860	3986820	playroom vr and the persistence and they are now a part of playstation studios and honestly i think
3986820	3990420	the most surprising part of the story to me was that they weren't already because everything
3990420	3996260	they've developing is pretty much exclusive for playstation but uh who who can forget how
3996260	4002260	important the playroom was to those early days of broadcasting on the playstation 4 that i remember
4003220	4008260	that was a thing yeah that's a thing so it makes it very i'm curious what uh what they're gonna
4008260	4015220	bring to the table uh for playstation in the next experience um but anyhow home hey i'd love that
4015220	4022020	but we'll see um some developers will go back to sony with this deal but um quite a few develop
4022020	4026420	because quite a few members of fire sprite apparently came from the wipeout developer
4026420	4031460	studio liverpool and then uh sony bought that when they were like psychosis and then they shut
4031460	4037860	them down in 2012 anyway um so yeah sony and fire sprite have been kind of hand in hand uh ever
4037860	4044340	since then uh all of that said is the team is working on something new but we don't know what
4044340	4050980	it is uh we only know that they did the playroom and they had a vita and mobile title run sackboy
4050980	4055140	run i played that i think that's one of the endless runners they do the astro bots games as
4055140	4059620	well where the different studio they did not do the astro bot playstation 5 game which is
4059620	4064580	interesting because that all all that stuff came from the family yeah because playroom like one of
4064580	4070340	the things i liked playing on there the most with like my kids is they had an uh bot game it was
4070340	4074580	like throwing ninja stars as ninja bots or something like that it's like throwing ninja
4074580	4079540	stars on like a runner type of game and that was kind of fun to kind of show you like the motion
4080340	4090580	um controls for the playstation 4 it should be noted though with fire sprite the the playroom
4090580	4097220	and run sackboy run those are the only titles that haven't really been vr related so it's very likely
4097220	4102900	fire sprite is working on something to launch playstation 5's vr headset whenever that happens
4102900	4107540	that makes i would say that's probably what they're working on and so and we don't know if
4107540	4113860	that means another like astro bot playroom related thing hey i i always thought playstation home like
4113860	4122420	the shift to vr would make a lot of sense for that but um yeah so uh and then uh jumping in as well
4122980	4129940	to to save the day and chat bobby blackwolf is in chat saying um astro bot is a soap a soby studios
4129940	4136020	not to be confused with osobo who made flight simulator so there's a little bit of a correction
4136020	4142500	there from our chat and by the way yes you just saw a new camera angle here on twitch so that when
4142500	4148980	there's chat stuff to shout out we have that available all right uh let's move on with our
4149060	4152340	next story which i think is dark sakras even though she's got delivered dinner i think
4153140	4158820	it is but there's no mayonnaise on it good hey it's my food and i like mayonnaise i get cubie
4158820	4165700	mayonnaise um so um you know a lot of people really enjoyed sonic colors i don't know why
4165700	4172740	but some people liked it and so sonic colors ultimate um uh came out on the switch but um
4172740	4178900	apparently the switch version has a lot of buggy bugs and glitchy glitchies
4179700	4187620	and so a twitch user sorry twitter user named vex contacted nintendo to try to get a refund
4187620	4190580	and they were all like yeah we know about it here's your money back
4192340	4200820	and so apparently you can now call nintendo and get your refund unless you're enjoying the game
4200820	4206420	or have played a lot of it then don't do that because you got your money's worth right so right
4206420	4210500	but apparently there's a lot of issues with the nintendo version of the game that are not present
4210500	4216180	in the other versions of the game and i don't know if that's part of the tech specifications
4216180	4220340	of the switch or what have you but i guess it's just it's it's having problems i haven't played
4220340	4225300	colors ultimate myself sonic colors ultimate myself so i can't tell you what that's all about
4225300	4232900	but um that's interesting that uh nintendo is offering that it's it's it's the cyberpunk of
4232900	4241780	sonic games clearly i reckon all right uh let's move on loki so this is kind of exciting but
4241780	4248820	apparently there is a working playstation 4 emulator now um that's right playstation 4
4248820	4255540	now it doesn't play a lot of things obviously it's not a full-fledged um you know emulator for
4255540	4262420	a lot of retail software but you can actually play some of these 2d games in fact i saw um some
4262420	4267780	examples of what was it shovel knight being played on it which it's still kind of got some graphical
4267780	4271700	issues and whatnot but right now what they've been kind of playing on there is a lot of these
4271700	4279460	different 2d games um but there's still you know a lot of different hitches with it like for
4279460	4284740	example there's stuff you have to dump from a playstation board and files that you need to run
4284740	4289700	um in order to be able to do that and then transferring the game as well um you have to do
4289700	4295540	that as to get that to run on pc but it is an exciting start at least to see them being able
4295540	4300980	to play like you know some games on there and it was actually running at like pretty good speeds
4301940	4307620	aside from the graphical glitches i mean it's pretty respectable for where it's at now when
4307620	4314260	we get into 3d and when some of those graphical things are enabled that may you know cause the
4314260	4321060	games to run a little bit slower but it's still not a bad start so far um and bobby in chat uh
4321060	4326180	by like asked an appropriate question saying so if it doesn't play many things is it really a
4326260	4332260	working emulator um from well it has it plays a hundred it plays lots of indie games so they
4332260	4337780	said that right now the emulator has uh hundreds of indie games that are supported by it so it's
4337780	4343300	basically 2d games that are running on it right now and so uh when okay so i've i've mentioned
4343300	4346980	on the show before that back in the day i was a little more heavily involved with emulator scenes
4347540	4351380	especially when the nintendo emulators and super nintendo emulators really were starting to gain
4351380	4356100	a lot of ground um and usually it's kind of like a checkpoint along the way for a lot of the
4356100	4360740	emulator developers because it's one thing to like have the hardware going and have the hardware kind
4360740	4368580	of like run but it's another to actually then get the game working um for example um many a very
4368580	4372420	popular nes emulator back in the day and i'm going to date myself a little bit here because this
4372420	4378100	isn't the one people use anymore was nesticle was the the big one that uh a lot of folks used right
4378100	4382020	it was nesticle and there was genesis because the developer had a sense of those are the ones
4382020	4386020	although i think i used a different one than genesis because genesis wouldn't play panorama
4386020	4392660	cotton and that that you actually put what it is so nesticle was considered a working emulator
4393220	4398740	but it didn't play every nes game because there were nes games with custom mappers custom chipsets
4398740	4404180	um like and it had a lot one of the the big things back in the day i figured out how to get
4404500	4410740	castlevania 3 running on nesticle um by changing some things in the file specifications
4410740	4416900	and um that that got the vertical scrolling stuff to work that was considered working
4416900	4421620	even though it wasn't 100 perfect so there's kind of a difference between the emulator works
4421620	4426820	and the emulator is 100 now i would say the nes emulators you see nowadays like the things that
4426820	4433220	are playing pixel poops number two and stuff those are 100 emulators basically but i i also get you
4433220	4437780	know i i i don't know if bobby was saying that tongue in cheek or not but i also kind of get it
4437780	4445140	but just coming up from a long time ago a working emulator is basically like when it plays one game
4445140	4452580	it works it emulated a game now it's building it out from there to 100 emulation yeah so and
4452580	4458420	in the emulator because i didn't mention the name it's called spine and they did update some of the
4458420	4464900	game library on the first of september but there's you know still quite a bit that needs to be worked
4464900	4470420	on um there are some games though that are running i like persona 5r is running like i said though
4470420	4475380	lots of graphical issues right now but at least it is booting up to the game and it's able to run it
4475380	4479460	they have a whole like spreadsheet of all the different games and like where they are like
4479460	4483860	whether they'll boot at all where if it gets to like the title screen or in game that type of
4483860	4491140	stuff so it's not perfect obviously but it is progress just think that guy that wrote nesticle
4491140	4497540	probably got to be in his late 40s now probably a family and he's like i'm the guy that wrote
4497540	4505300	nesticle anyway shout out to that guy hey that guy got us through our college years so shout out
4505300	4510100	and i i hope he's doing well even if nintendo probably wanted to sue the pants off of them
4510100	4517860	back in the day i hope i hope he's having a good day all right moving on let's talk about this
4517860	4524340	next story which has to do with a steam update so steam got an update this week uh which uh has to
4524340	4529380	do with managing downloads and storage uh makes it very easy to move games from one drive to another
4529380	4534340	which i appreciate because i sometimes need to get things off my solid state drive onto the non-solid
4534340	4540100	state drive to get a different game on the ssd uh these changes have been in beta for a while
4540100	4545940	but it just came out for all users uh as a stable release it will now show installation progress on
4545940	4552980	top of download status um and now there's instead of view news there's view news there's patch notes
4552980	4558420	um there's also a storage manager that will show you how much space you have left uh for moving
4558420	4565460	gate sorry guys for moving games around and things of that sort i still want to know why it
4565460	4570740	takes my computer so fucking long to patch a game do you know that dead by daylight pinhead thing
4570740	4574180	and this happens with every dead by daylight patch that comes out it takes my computer like
4574180	4579700	it takes an hour and a half to two hours to download and patch that it's crazy and i don't
4579700	4584100	know does that happen to anybody else when let's hear it for stadia i never have to deal with that
4584660	4592180	yeah but you know i i also don't have that weird frame rate thing that comes in when the cloud gets
4592180	4598580	skippy so i don't have weird frame rate things remember usually when i'm playing i am streaming
4598580	4604100	at the same time yeah um okay so bobby and chat says it happens for some of my games but not
4604100	4613540	others i guess that is that whole uh uh uh sorry i lost my train of thought uh it's that whole um
4615060	4618260	dang it sorry it happens for some of my games not for others is what bobby glacol said it
4618260	4622580	really depends on if the game is packed rather than just flat files is that spaghetti code
4622580	4626980	coming into play again when it comes to dead by daylight that's for sure how about that
4627620	4633860	dj rama s found the guy that did nest he works for ea as a senior software engineer now well good for
4633860	4640980	him congratulations that means he's making money good for him all right and steam update hooray
4640980	4645380	uh bobby says it really depends if the game is packed rather than just flat files well dead by
4645380	4650340	daylight's definitely a packed game all right let's let's go to a simpler time when we didn't
4650340	4654820	have to have a download manager why because everything was on a cartridge or i think in
4654820	4661940	tonight's game case a cd so let's get into no not even a cd something special all right let me uh
4661940	4680180	let me play the official transition and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where i'll
4680180	4686180	dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game
4686180	4693700	of the week and what did you pick this week dark soccer i picked blue stinger a game i've talked
4693700	4699540	about a whole bunch and have never apparently done so um and happy belated birthday to the
4699540	4708740	dreamcast with this one right seriously yeah the ninth so basically um this particular game came
4708740	4714980	out in 1999 uh for the dreamcast it was developed by climax graphics originally published by sega
4714980	4721060	and then outside in japan and outside of japan it was published by excuse me hiccup activision
4721700	4729300	um the game is entirely 3d you heal yourselves real time with you know food and drinks and
4729300	4737060	in the game um and of course uh you have to buy them from vending machines so you can only get
4737060	4743140	to heal when it's actually safe to heal um you can buy weapons and ammo the same way out of a
4743140	4751380	vending machine including uh you can get rocket launchers napalm uh triple barreled shotguns you
4751380	4759300	can get a freaking lightsaber that was my favorite weapon um you have two characters you have elliot
4759300	4765060	and you have another guy named dogs who has a crossbow and so there's also like the beat so
4765060	4772740	it sort of combines some shooter elements and some beat them ups so basically uh a long ass
4772740	4781700	time ago a meteorite hits and wiped out all the dinosaurs and then now um this biotech company is
4781700	4787940	uh trying to make things happen i don't want to just say too much because it's been a long time
4787940	4796180	since i've played this game i beat it when it came out um and then um this like creature arrives
4796740	4804100	that is seals it in this dome of energy and so elliot's trying to solve this mystery
4804820	4814100	um so as far as the game goes there the big thing that's notable about it is that the
4814900	4820820	cinematography in the japanese version was
4823860	4831220	it it basically drew from cinema uh cinematic techniques um
4832340	4838420	and it really added i think to the drama in the game added some tension in certain scenes
4839220	4848740	um but um in the us version it had some pretty terrible dubbing um
4849300	4854420	and this fixed camera system it was a behind the player third-person view
4855380	4863780	um kind of tomb raider-ish um or almost resident evil-ish but like there's this one scene because
4863780	4867540	i played through both the the us and the japanese version i had the japanese version first
4868420	4878180	um there's this like tower that you're on a spiral going up and the camera would zoom far out
4878820	4886260	and like almost like a drone looking around it you know it was really really cool it was hard
4886260	4892740	as fuck to play you kind of had to pay attention to where you were but then in the us one it's just
4892740	4901060	falling around and it's so fucking boring it's boring as balls but the game itself did not get
4901620	4910820	a lot of great great ratings okay like it maybe was middle of the line it had a 28 out of 40 from
4910820	4918500	famitsu um you know it didn't like the highest rating it got was an 8.4 out of 10 from ign
4918500	4929060	so it's it was pretty average um but it was novel and it was a fun actual little game i
4929060	4933300	i wasn't mad at it i played through the whole thing i thought it was fun i had a great time
4933300	4942340	with it and it is one of the early full 3d survival horror games you know i honestly
4942340	4950020	like to say that blue stinger paved the way for code veronica to come out um i just really
4950020	4956420	thought that the game was a neat little game i thought that it had unique elements to it i
4956420	4959460	laughed my ass off that you would have to buy all your shit through a vending machine
4960420	4967540	that you could buy a rocket launcher in a vending machine go fig so um
4968180	4977620	um yeah i would say that um if you can find the japanese copy of it however you find it
4978900	4987700	give that one a play you can play it in english um it it's not a difficult game by any means i
4987700	4994900	i had an easy time of it i played all the way through it in practically one sitting um actually
4994900	5000420	i take that back it was a couple of sittings but it was it was a nice fun little game and it had
5000420	5006900	a decent story i mean yeah the graphics now are going to be kind of dated it is very early dream
5006900	5013940	cast but it was absolutely a smash to play i had a great time with it so there you go it's blue
5013940	5020900	stinger i'm not sure it definitely kind of um set the stage for like cinematic type of games like
5020900	5026580	you know i see a lot even though yes it's a little bit clunky and old looking i still see
5026580	5036740	like a lot of modern games in this yeah and like even this one little scene here uh now this is
5036740	5044500	i want to say this one is the japanese version yeah it is um because you can see how in some
5044500	5054500	cases it starts off with these like more cinematic elements um it was it was very
5054500	5058980	novel for what it did that's that's what my thought is it was very novel for what it did
5058980	5064820	it certainly set the stage again for this for this type of play and it was all 3d
5066100	5071620	very true yeah so some comments in chat bobby blackwell says i bought this on launch day at
5071620	5076420	the dreamcast just for the intro movie it really wasn't my kind of game so i never really played it
5076420	5083540	much further and then ssj100 matt in chat says yeah i got the game around uh launch uh as well
5083540	5088820	wasn't a fan at the time but appreciated it later uh i think i ended up trading it i can't believe
5088820	5093620	for nfl blitz so it kind of sounds like you know with uh you know kind of what you guys are saying
5093620	5098500	there it's kind of one of those things where it's like you you you it didn't maybe it wasn't the
5098500	5104900	greatest game but if you only played the us version you missed out but so many things that
5104900	5110820	it did kind of set the stage for later stuff too but there probably will not be any hurry to make
5110820	5116020	a remaster of this game or anything like that if they did that there's a lot of potential in it okay
5116820	5121860	all right your classic game of the week blue stinger all right let's travel around the world
5121860	5128340	quickly and check out some other rapid fire news so loki i'm gonna go to you all right
5128420	5137060	so uh you know me i am a big fan of legos and so there's a brand new set coming out now

5172900	5176900	not sure if i'll pick this up because i have no room for any more sets unfortunately but
5177460	5184180	i would if i did um and then this is kind of fun so we always hear like you know patches for
5184180	5192660	different games to block cheating but in this case um cookie clicker has been patched to help
5192660	5199380	with cheating so they have a patch now that it was to address some memory leak issues due to
5199380	5207380	some audio stuff uh when using auto clicking and so now they've uh fixed that so now you can use
5207380	5213940	auto clickers with less uh i do not use auto clickers for the record no but i do want to check
5213940	5218100	out some of the mods that's i should have mentioned that when i was talking about my gaming week
5218100	5222820	is it cookie yeah cookie clicker now embraces mods and that's another big thing of the steam race
5222820	5228660	that's interesting yeah i'm just i'm waiting for titty clicker
5231860	5239380	nothing yet sorry podcast listeners but the look dark soccer just shot me while she's mid sandwich
5242900	5249220	uh bobby blackwolf in chat says ttp clicker yeah i don't yeah anything's possible thanks to mods
5249220	5260340	yeah so check that out i will uh let's move on uh dark sakura uh when you're able to uh
5261060	5265700	chew on that sandwich uh you i think you have a couple things that were i do shout it out in our
5265700	5276420	discord yeah so um one of those is that um platinum games wants to bring star fox zero to the switch
5276420	5284980	and um starfox zero was on weu it came out in uh 2016 and it was one of platinum's games and they
5284980	5292260	want to bring it back it'd be cool if they did actually actually they're quoted as saying it's
5292260	5297300	not cool that people are aren't able to play older games because they're locked out on the platform
5297300	5301380	and so of course if anything was possible we'd like to bring over any of those older titles to
5301380	5315780	the newer platforms and in other news arcade one up has a uh a tabletop uh a mortal combat
5316900	5324340	and the marvel uh versus capcom table and everything they are now up for pre-order
5324340	5330820	and there was much rejoicing well it's so these games were never on tabletop that's what struck
5330820	5335300	me as interesting about it is that these games yeah cocktail cabinets they're fighting games
5335300	5341060	somebody's yeah somebody's gonna be screwed on the wrong side i'm trying to look at this picture to
5341060	5348820	see oh look at it the sprit this the screen is split in half oh so one person gets they have a
5349540	5355220	they have a mirror of the screen okay okay i'm pretty sure that they had a street fighter 2
5355220	5360260	cocktail cabinet at one point not street not street fighter this is mortal combat 2 well
5361140	5365620	and the other one is marvel versus capcom separately i think loki's talking about these
5365620	5370260	are new i think there has been a street fighter one but i think also like in in the real world
5370260	5375860	quote-unquote that game was so fucking popular you can't really understate like what that game
5375860	5381460	did for arcades in 1992 or whatever year it was uh i actually that one i wouldn't be surprised if
5381460	5386500	it had a legitimate cocktail cabinet at one point it was just that big of a game even if it didn't
5386500	5396180	make sense so um sort of on off topic you know those like little tiny arcade cabinets oh yeah
5396180	5401540	the ones i collect these little arcade classics there's other different types too well you know
5401700	5413220	we were getting some of them um i found at tj maxx of all places a galaga cocktail table size
5415220	5421060	like a full arcade one up machine no no the teeny ones oh but but a cocktail
5421780	5429940	yeah but a cocktail huh it is tiny but of course you know i i had to buy it i mean
5430500	5437460	normally those things was uh uh well i think they were like 20 bucks and this was like of course
5437460	5442420	because it was tj maxx it was like 10 yeah wow i know yeah i might have to go on a run
5442420	5447700	i didn't think to check stuff like good luck tj maxx but yeah don't go to big lots because they
5447700	5453940	um are uh hate paid oh shit i didn't know that all right but they're very i think of those types of
5453940	5460420	stores you know they contributed to uh you know who oh all right what were you gonna say logie
5460980	5466100	oh i was gonna say uh we uh this a while back okay we had talked about another company that
5466100	5474020	was bringing arcade games to the you know home uh was ice um so that got me thinking like did
5474020	5481620	they ever put up their page to sell arcade games they have actually so you can the thing is though
5481620	5488660	is i don't see how these are like home versions of arcade games these just look like arcade games
5488660	5495300	so like for example they have jurassic park pro you know that you can bring that game home for
5495300	5504100	ten thousand dollars that's just the arcade game at that point that's not like that's not a that's
5504100	5510100	not a deal that's just arcade game or like you can get a skee ball that's like five thousand dollars
5510100	5515540	it's like that's a skee ball you know like i don't get it but they are selling them now so so
5515540	5522100	that's a thing but all righty sadly it's a a ten a nine thousand two hundred ninety five dollar thing
5522100	5527780	and not a five hundred dollar thing which is what i was really hoping it was all right let's travel
5527780	5533460	around the world and check out some release dates and some games coming out um pretty soon so logie
5533460	5537700	we'll start with you in the us thank god death loop is finally coming out so i don't see any
5537700	5543220	more stupid trailers for it but that's coming out on playstation uh five and pc and the speaking of
5543220	5547380	a stupid trailer we did get another one of those during the playstation event because god forbid
5547380	5552420	they they have to you know shout that game out since it's the only Bethesda game they're getting
5552420	5557060	i i i'm actually gonna agree with Loki on this they're they're they're setting that up for
5557060	5562100	disaster by show it's like i get the no man's sky vibe from that sorry which is funny because i love
5562100	5567220	no man's sky now but we all know that when it released it did not like really buy into all
5567220	5573780	that hype because they hyped it over and over and over again and i feel death loop isn't a death loop
5573780	5580900	pun intended yeah it it was annoying so but it is coming out though so look for that this week

5731220	5736020	get some more news stories and then we'll open up uh for calls if you want to join our discord vog
5736020	5741140	network dot com slash discord uh and uh in the green room is where we'll uh field for calls but
5741140	5744340	we do have a little bit of time still it's probably gonna be a few minutes before we get there we have
5744340	5749540	some more stories uh including uh this one from loki about some international news right
5750900	5756820	yeah so there was some news while we were out about chinese the chinese government cracking down
5756820	5763940	on uh basically gameplay relegating children to only allow them to play like i think it was like
5764980	5772420	two or three hours a week during specific times and or under the age of 18 yeah and so because
5772420	5780980	of that um locked or the kind of crackdown there is uh several lots of money being lost
5780980	5788260	from uh chinese companies so uh 60 billion dollars in losses from net ease and ten cent
5788260	5792980	uh because of their stocks and the sell-offs that they had to do during that time because of this
5792980	5801620	announcement um that's a lot of money that they lost but yeah so um along with that though of
5801620	5808980	course um there's new restrictions in place where basically because you know china is really um
5808980	5814100	controlling for all of you know their gaming and everything so you have to put like in some id
5814100	5822500	number or something into the system when you play and um but you know people are gonna circumvent it
5822500	5827700	so what are people doing well kids are taking their parents ids and putting them into the system
5827700	5832260	along with their names and playing games under their parents profile instead so they can get
5832260	5838340	around the two-hour limit that they have because like no one would have figured this out i guess
5839780	5848100	but yeah um it's interesting apparently though the ten cents also rolling out a time-sensitive
5848100	5854500	facial recognition system for some games uh they're calling it midnight patrol aims to
5854500	5863700	prevent um kids posing as grown-ups by scanning their face between i guess the hours of 10 p.m
5863700	5870340	and 8 a.m i mean they don't live in china i know i was gonna say i get how they probably get away
5870340	5875860	with that on smartphones but how do they do that on desktops i guess i guess there's a picture of
5875860	5880580	maybe put a picture of their their parent like next to a webcam or something like that and then
5880580	5886820	just point the webcam somewhere else there's get away with everything it's just really unfortunate
5886820	5890980	like i understand that you know the gaming addiction problem is real and it's real here
5890980	5895460	it's not just real um overseas but sometimes some of the the culture with the the cafes and stuff
5895460	5902660	really exacerbate that whole thing um but i i just don't understand like why do they regulate how
5902660	5907700	many how long you can watch a movie do they regulate how long you can read a book do they
5907700	5912980	really what kind of movies tv shows i mean yeah they do they do really the kind of movies but
5912980	5916580	they don't really regulate the length they also they've been regulating the kind of games for a
5916580	5922020	long time you know uh most popular story that comes to my mind is world of warcraft had to
5922020	5926660	kind of get rid of the undead in order to release um because that is very frowned on and that
5926660	5932180	culture is like the the i guess animation of like bodies or things like that so they had to
5932180	5936100	really change it they're called the forsaken and they're just they're different they're not so um
5936180	5942420	you know uh uh zombie like i guess so um but they're of the unliving yes
5944260	5949700	uh s2100 matt suggests as another way to get around the uh scanning print out your parents
5949700	5956660	face and wear it as a mask there you go or just say you know dad come here can you look at the
5956660	5964340	camera all right anyway gonna have a staring contest with this camera for a good i don't know
5964340	5972020	eight hours well i play some world of warcraft all right uh let's talk further about legal uh
5972020	5978820	issues and uh this has to do with a kickstarter there was a hand-drawn nintendo entertainment
5978820	5982740	system game i already know what happened here yeah yeah right i don't even need to finish
5984740	5991620	well actually you know what's interesting they're not naming the company that sent the lawyer and i
5991620	5997220	wonder if that's for legal reasons everybody is assuming um because it's interesting because
5997220	6002580	even um you know i'm i'm looking at a source here from kotaku that got corrected after the fact
6002580	6009140	saying a previous version of this story jumped to conclusions regarding the parties involved in the
6009140	6014260	shutdown i found that very interesting because that means somebody contacted kotaku telling him
6014260	6020420	to change it out of possible legal concerns there so this is a very interesting legal game of chess
6020420	6027940	that's going on anyway what happened uh it was a hand-drawn game guides kickstarter uh by creator
6027940	6034420	phillips summers uh and he knew it was a risk to do um but uh the kickstarter happened the
6034420	6039780	kickstarter got uh well funded over three hundred thousand dollars but then had to be cancelled
6039780	6045860	again they did not name outright what happened but in an update on kickstarter uh the creator
6045860	6051140	phillips summer said i was basically he was contacted by a lawyer and so from there he made
6051140	6056580	that decision to pull the project and i i totally got his reasoning because if the kickstarter had
6056580	6062660	gone through and that money got pulled from everybody's bank account he'd be legally obligated
6062660	6066580	through kickstarter to come through with the backer rewards and this is kind of what he went
6066580	6073300	through in his is a message uh and so he didn't want to find himself in that position so he pulled
6073300	6079460	the plug before the kickstarter finished basically um everybody is jumping to conclusions about who
6079460	6088020	that lawyer was and who they were representing um but i also think um i think nintendo quite frankly
6088020	6094980	whether it was or wasn't them um nintendo has earned that reputation of everyone jumping to
6094980	6101860	conclusions that it is them for a very good reason and i think that speaks to something as well is
6101860	6107140	like you know whether that lawyer was or wasn't from nintendo we all assume it was because
6107140	6111940	nintendo has this reputation now in the industry that being said
6114020	6120500	i'm not surprised at all and this was a pretty bold move to try to do this guide using all of
6120500	6125700	these different ip's from a class you know from classic nintendo era here's the interesting thing
6126660	6132500	when people are selling their prints of samus and mario and things they draw at a convention or
6132500	6136820	whatever there's kind of a wink and a nod and an under the table type of thing i think the
6136820	6142500	scale of this type of project definitely drew somebody's attention um and that's why it
6142500	6148900	ultimately got shut down but because it's all legalese we'll never know exactly who it was
6148900	6154820	and exactly what was said but i think it was smart of him to preemptively pull the plug because he
6154820	6158820	made a damn good point if he had continued it he would have had to deliver on those backer
6158820	6164260	awards and he may not have been able to do that legally so something wondering if like because
6164260	6169860	like i'm looking here and looking at the different guides that they have and they have like contra
6169860	6172580	and there's like ninja guide in and stuff like that i'm wondering if like
6173380	6177540	couldn't just take metroid and zelda out of there and just do like some of these other guides
6177540	6182260	perhaps but the reality is he needs to get permission from the developers in order to
6182260	6188980	sell something like that on that scale so anyway all right moving on dark sakura
6193860	6202020	uh the stupid mute button doesn't want to work anyway um uh we have uh uh ueda
6202020	6209300	rita who was the uh jet set radio artist and the director of yakuza is back at sega
6210100	6219380	yay and this was like a while it was like 10 years or so um he posted the news on facebook in may
6220100	6225860	and he was thinking his uh co-workers at yahoo where he'd been working on some mobile titles
6225860	6232900	that he was going to go back to making games at sega and um apart from being the art director
6232900	6238020	for jet set radio and jet set radio future um like i said he was the director on the first two yakuza
6238020	6249540	games um and uh he is uh it's kind of coinciding with the departure of nagoshi toshiro um who was
6249540	6256500	the current yakuza creator that is exactly what came to mind yeah yeah and he's leaving uh for
6256500	6264020	a chinese company called net ease so um other games that are under ueda's belt uh are rise of
6264020	6272180	nightmares uh panzer dragoon uh uh the panzer dragoon series uh including panzer dragoon as a
6272820	6279780	uh panzer dragoon saga um which was in japan panzer dragoon rpg and panzer dragoon orta and
6279780	6285780	some of the sonic and sega all-stars racing games so who knows what'll happen i'm looking forward
6285780	6292740	to it all right welcome back that's going to be interesting that how much yakuza's changed and
6292740	6297300	now you know like a dragon is going to be the direction for the main series uh so it's
6297300	6300660	interesting the original director is kind of walking back into that where this big change
6300660	6305380	has happened but uh it'll be interesting i'm very you know just because i enjoyed the last game and
6305380	6308660	yes i still need to finish it and you know i've just been distracted with all these other new
6308660	6316660	shinies um but um i am really uh curious about that next game i'm i'm definitely on board uh for
6316660	6320660	the next yakuza game because i i enjoyed like a dragon so much and i still need to go back and
6320660	6329140	play the old ones too so anyway we'll see where that goes uh meanwhile loki so we just talked
6329140	6334340	about season this is from nintendo so i'm just gonna say one name and you'll already know what's
6334340	6340820	gonna happen rockstar games so uh and actually take more of take two interactive so we've
6340820	6345700	mentioned so many times that take two has gone after modders for different things and so now
6345700	6351620	here's yet another uh grand theft auto underground that was taking the maps from three and vice city
6351620	6359700	and kind of bringing them together and so because of that you know they cease and desisted it again
6359700	6364980	because they're probably going to re-release these games or i'm sorry they're going to um
6366580	6371300	not really yeah they're going to port them over to playstation 5 or something like that and it's
6371300	6375780	gonna be just like the mobile port but did we already know like grand theft auto 3 vice city
6375780	6380180	and all that was getting some type of i think it's rumor i don't know if it's like we know that's
6380180	6385940	coming back yet but like it's i don't know but it's annoying though that you know the modding
6385940	6390420	scene with grand theft auto is what kind of keeps grand theft auto alive honestly because i think a
6390420	6395380	lot of like the roleplay stuff and all that that people play like in five and online is through
6395380	6399460	the modding scene and i know a lot of the attention game gets us through the modding scene as well
6401380	6406340	like they wouldn't i don't know it's it's really dumb i don't know what happened with take-two
6406340	6410260	interactive and okay well take-two interactive has always sucked but like i don't know what's
6410260	6416260	happened with rockstar games i they're not the company they used to be unfortunately
6417300	6421380	uh fifth dream in chat says i'd play grand theft auto 5 if they added all the other games into it
6421380	6427780	lol a big grant grand theft super game yeah that was the thought before was like online was
6427780	6432660	supposed to kind of expand to like oh you can go liberty city now or you can go to vice city
6432660	6438180	or something like that i think they're making so much money off of the the garbage that they're
6438180	6442340	doing right now with it that they just feel that they don't need to make those kinds of updates
6442340	6446580	because that's a lot of a lot of updates and for what kind of return are they going to get
6446580	6452500	not probably much more than what they have now so we'll wait and see i guess there'll be another
6453300	6459220	10 years of grand theft auto 5 at least we'd make the joke about older scroll skyrim and being
6459220	6463620	re-released all the time at least we know there's a new game coming i mean that's been confirmed at
6463620	6470420	least so you know they have kind of lead there at least on the bethesda side but like rockstar like
6471300	6477380	we don't know anything yeah it's uh we had it's been a while since we had a really big update
6477380	6481700	from rockstar you know exactly i used to be a big champion of the grand theft auto series
6482580	6487380	and now it's like i just can't play online anymore like i don't have any interest
6487380	6493620	whatsoever it's such a grind fest and they have like such irritating things inside there like
6493620	6499140	i mean you have to pay to you know you have to pay rent in your apartment you have to pay to
6499140	6504340	keep your cars in the garage and you have to pay to have your maintenance guy you know fix your
6504340	6510740	cars and also it's like it's such a grind just to make it a grind so that you have to buy those
6510740	6519700	shark cards is what it is and that's just i'm not interested in that no thanks all right let's get
6519700	6524340	to one last story tonight and that's catching up a little bit with what's going on with epic games
6524340	6529700	uh on one front we have the house party app um which i have i had never heard of until of this
6529700	6534020	but i guess some people were getting into house party uh during the pandemic um i guess it was
6534020	6539060	some type of video chat calling thing although i've pretty much i've heard zoom i've heard
6539140	6544020	facetime i've heard skype i i never had heard a house party but i guess it was one of the others
6544020	6548260	involved with this and then epic actually bought house party uh and now they're going to be shutting
6548260	6552820	it down at some point in october in fact it's already gone from stores uh i had no idea that
6552820	6556740	house party was integrated into fortnite but apparently that was the thing uh and that will
6556740	6562500	be going away as well um what's also interesting is that um epic is kind of saying as part of the
6562500	6567460	reason why it's going away they are crafting meaningful and authentic new socialization
6567460	6572980	features that will be useful at a metaverse level across epic game titles that makes me wonder if
6572980	6577780	they're building something for the epic game store and if this isn't something that they want to
6577780	6583140	build into that because you know epic wants to launch their game store on mobile devices
6584020	6590340	and they just like first put all the features in the store i feel like their store sucks compared
6590340	6597220	to see i'm sorry heart yeah or like a wish list there's so much other ways to browse it
6597860	6603700	it really is maybe maybe we shouldn't try to reinvent the chatting in the games and like just
6604580	6611700	finish your stupid like they they had a roadmap for their store like come on that is so stupid
6612500	6617220	but it has been noted that you know fortnite has gone through this interesting shift where now
6617220	6622420	a lot of the recent reporting hasn't been about battle royale and that game but about things like
6622420	6629060	the ariana grande concert and uh you know party royale and things like that so it's interesting
6629060	6633940	to see what might be uh coming through on that space um something that i referenced there that
6633940	6637700	obviously we'd have to mention on the show at some point there was an update this week on the epic
6637700	6643140	epic versus apple thing um and there's all sorts of reports out there some are saying apple lost
6643140	6648740	some are saying well epic kind of lost it too here's the reality of that whole thing and why
6648740	6654820	i'm not making a bigger deal out of it um it's not over epics already filed an appeal which is
6654820	6659940	which when you consider a lot of the headlines have been apple lost uh the epic is appealing
6659940	6663940	the decision because there were some things in there that were very unfavorable to epic
6663940	6670340	here's the reality this has got a long way to go uh it's gonna go through appeals court
6670340	6674100	it's gonna go through a state appeals court and it's gonna end up at the supreme court
6674100	6678660	guarantee it i'll bet money this ends up at the supreme court now whether they hear it or not
6678660	6683460	is another i won't play place money on that but some this will get petitioned to the supreme court
6683460	6688500	i guarantee so i mean we're all drawing conclusions about what is going to happen what isn't going to
6688500	6696180	happen it doesn't it's not going to stick so why why are we wasting time this is this is one hurdle
6696820	6703780	in what's going to end up being a much longer legal process so get your popcorn anyway
6703780	6712900	that's my thought on that um anyhow uh we're going to open up the uh discord uh vog network.com
6712900	6719460	slash discord uh if you would like to uh give us a call in the green room uh while i peek at
6719460	6724900	discord and see if anything's there i know we also do emails around this time uh let's get to
6724900	6729380	okay wait a minute because i think we have one email tonight but i don't want this individual
6729380	6735380	is also sitting in the green room so you know what this is what we're gonna do let him read
6735380	6742260	his own email yep hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this hey it's the one and only ron
6742260	6748900	how's everybody doing tonight uh doing well how are you i can't complain um i for some reason my
6748900	6754260	camera is not working but you know it is what it is that's okay uh i'm trying to find the right
6754260	6759140	shot here that has uh there we go there's the one that has me and discord there um now here's
6759140	6763700	the thing this is why i brought you into the room uh rama um you actually emailed the show tonight
6764740	6770820	say what now you you emailed the show tonight right yeah the funny thing is i've been meaning
6770820	6777460	to work send that email earlier this week but i have been working on my google certification
6777460	6784340	for the last couple of weeks so my brain has kind of sort of been mush you know here's here's what
6784340	6788340	i did some folks are saying this is an orange entree go first i would like to give dark sakura
6788340	6792260	a break tonight and i would like to invite you to read your email on the show tonight rama
6795780	6802180	do you have the email in your sent folder i haven't but at least she won't get mad at me
6802180	6811300	for how bad my email is i talk and she's not the first person to tell me you need to type your
6811300	6821860	emails better okay no no no no no here's here's my problem here we go ellipsis you use ellipsis
6822660	6826420	when it doesn't need to be an ellipsis a period will suffice
6826420	6833700	i blame it on the new york state uh educational school system i i blame it on typing the way i
6833700	6838580	think i do it too and it's because i'm literally typing my thoughts and that's the point of an
6838580	6843940	ellipsis is when you are actually fading out on something and leaving something unsaid
6845460	6854260	maybe i am dot dot dot anyway like what i just told you a moment ago but and i left it that way
6854820	6859780	all right so so rama do you have the email if you don't have the email i'll i'll ask dark sakura to
6859780	6864820	read it but i thought it would be funny i have like i can just give a complete summary on it
6864820	6871940	all right works for me all right so from the last time we spoke i contacted amazon and told them
6871940	6879540	that i got sent the wrong controller so they apologized sent me another one got the package
6880180	6888100	opened it up it was not another xbox series controller put it back in the box with amazon
6888100	6894500	looked around couldn't find i saw the same ad pop back up they said screw it decided to go to
6895540	6902180	game stop just take a shot in the dark they had one and it was cheaper so i went and i bought that
6902820	6912340	got the controller opened it up and it was a modded first party xbox one controller i mean
6912340	6918820	they changed the buttons on it it didn't have the right battery case on the back and you can
6918820	6922980	look at the label because someone basically popped that open just to open up the controller
6922980	6931060	to change the buttons how funny the thing is i wasn't really mad i just found it amusing because
6931060	6938340	i got it from game stop but i'm not surprised this happened can you imagine buying a modded
6938340	6943140	system at game stop i'm sure it's happened where somebody bought like a system that was modded but
6943140	6948980	anyway anyway well there was a time when there were banned consoles they were selling and didn't
6948980	6954100	realize it by the way some folks in chat are uh having a little bit of a discussion about um is
6954100	6960260	there even actually an xbox series controller at this point and uh here's the thing yes there there
6960260	6964020	is xbox controller and i don't think they differentiate between the different ones but i
6964020	6968340	think we are saying it to differentiate because we know there are different versions of the xbox
6968340	6973540	controller for example the latest controller circa 2020 or whatever you want to call it
6973540	6979140	has the share button uh hey you're on cam now hey rama uh the one before at the xbox one era
6979140	6984340	controller does not so there are subtle differences anyway i just wanted to clarify that uh sometimes
6984340	6988580	it's not necessarily about the official name but how we differentiate between them which is does
6988580	6995540	play into uh rama's uh situation is that you specifically wanted an xbox one controller and
6995540	6999460	despite the fact we're all sitting here going why what it doesn't matter it's what you want
6999460	7007540	it's your money get into the reason behind that okay um so i went back on i sent the controller
7007540	7015860	back i contacted i went to amazon i looked again found the controller same ad link that i bought
7015860	7021140	it from before but i looked again it was a different reseller this time so i went through
7021140	7030340	them two days later i have a perfectly working xbox one controller now you've got it yep i
7030340	7036260	thought you'd have to hit up garage sales to be honest but you got it if i was to hit up garage
7036260	7040900	sales i would probably be dressed in a hazmat suit walking around to make sure because i don't
7040900	7045700	trust some of these people around here you'd find much more than a modded controller you'd open up
7045700	7052260	the back and be like who put rocks in here i can tell you i've had some people hit up garages and
7052260	7059620	find some amazing things you know so i'm just like all righty then all right yes so how how is
7059620	7063060	it though to hear now that you got your xbox one controller there's a whole new firmware for it
7063060	7067300	because i do when i read that story i instantly thought of you and i was like wow if this doesn't
7067300	7078580	scream justified to rama's situation so yeah so here's the thing i know there are new controllers
7078580	7086580	that are out but let's say for the sake of it i happen to sell my xbox back to game stop or
7087300	7094820	amazon or whatever i have to have the original controller that it came with or else amazon will
7094900	7101700	send it all back saying we can't resell it or game stop will take off 40 bucks because they
7101700	7106260	have to put it in one of their controllers to resell the unit one of their unknowingly modded
7106260	7113620	controllers yes i okay when you say it when you put it that way i kind of have an aha moment okay
7114660	7120180	but the thing is i'm when i get my series x i'm giving my xbox to a couple of friends of mine
7120180	7125540	they're not gaming savvy so i want to make sure they have the right controllers and the right
7125540	7132100	everything so they'll be good to go you know so another long story short you're doing this
7132100	7142580	because you're a good friend yeah basically okay and that is that is not the reason why i even
7142580	7148500	called it all right why did you call in what's up all right i'm not sure any of y'all covered this
7148500	7153380	or anything like that because i know from time to time y'all will take a good night off for various
7153380	7160020	reasons and for our show we've been taking a couple of weeks off here and there because we're
7160020	7166820	just exhausted like mental health issues and it's something that we talk about on our show if we
7166820	7173060	miss a week or if a certain host hasn't been around we're basically open about this because
7173060	7178340	we all have issues one way or another so i'm wondering have you loki or jamie have
7178340	7184180	you just been like you know what i i just don't have the mental energy to do a show i'm just going
7184180	7193060	to go to bed or do something else you know um i'll start i i think for me like having that
7193060	7198260	night off last week and doing the dragon con even though i know it was weird this year and
7198260	7204740	you know was a risk in some regard um that was so important for my mental health like just being
7204740	7210260	able to have that break and do that thing was so necessary for me that i feel like that was a way
7210260	7216500	to recharge my batteries um quite a bit um but um i'll let my co-host take the question if they
7216500	7227300	want to add anything further to it i mean i'm always like that so it's fine well loki i know
7227300	7232820	this show has oftentimes for you been a chance to kind of escape your normal monday through
7232820	7238020	friday type of life and like gives you something kind of different to do so yeah i think i get i
7238020	7243940	mean yeah but like i'm not really escaping anything because you know usually the kids
7243940	7249860	are behind me or like you know yeah not really leaving the house so it's not so much an escaping
7249860	7255460	or especially since i work right here in this very desk and computer and spot and all that stuff so
7255460	7264100	it's not really so much an escape anymore um plus it's it's important to note too that none of us
7264100	7269300	are required to be here none of us are paid to be here um so if anybody wanted to take a night off
7269300	7275540	for any reason um they're entitled to it uh that's that's what it is it's a little for my medical
7275540	7281060	conditions it's a little harder when it's me because yes all the production stuff is still
7281060	7286580	being run out of my house even in the covet area and so forth um but hypothetically it could be
7286580	7292420	done without me we just haven't really had to cross that bridge yet um so you know but dark
7292420	7299940	sacros up on and loki they both know how to stream so it wouldn't be that hard um so i am
7299940	7306900	i don't know uh i think in some ways this is kind of like a regular thing to kind of gravitate back
7306900	7312260	to too it's in a way it's a bit of an anchor um so it's kind of like you know that thing that
7312260	7319940	well there's still always olr on sunday night um yeah yeah i sometimes don't know what i would do
7319940	7329300	without having this on sunday yeah any thoughts on that rama totally get that it's for me as a
7330260	7336260	twitch viewer it's there are certain uh people i watch on certain days and it's like if they're
7336260	7342340	not doing a show on that day it's like well what do i do with my time and it's like and i get a
7342340	7348420	tap on the shoulder and it's like the spirit of my 500 video games like pick one or something like
7348420	7359700	that but as uh as a content creator i have like this rule of two if it's only two people to do
7359700	7367620	the show with i just cancel for the week because i'm like you know itchigo is not feeling up to it
7367620	7374260	she's things have been happening she can't get into doing the show or taco chan's the same i'm
7374260	7379860	like you know what we'll just do no show we'll just enjoy the tuesday off we'll come back next
7379860	7386740	week refreshed and we'll explain you know we needed some time off and this is what we do and
7386740	7393220	so on and so forth you know we try to be as transparent as possible yeah um i appreciate
7393220	7397300	a lot of the things you guys are saying in chat too like pod culture and chat says olr has been
7397300	7401620	my rock during some rough times uh fifth dream says i don't leave the house now so bobby blackwolf
7401620	7406100	and olr are kind of the marker that it's a new week um i deeply appreciate those comments and
7406100	7411940	i'm so thankful um that being said i also need to prepare folks for the reality the show isn't
7411940	7417860	going to last forever there is going to be a day what there is going to be a day when we say
7419620	7425380	um you know thanks for playing but roll credits you know type of thing for whatever the reason
7425380	7432020	is um so i just the only reason i put that out there is i say i say thank you for that but also
7432660	7437860	um it sometimes can be a little bit of pressure um and i just you know there's a reason why we
7437860	7444260	also say you know please support independent podcasting um i hope one day when this show
7444260	7449860	does inevitably end you all will still continue to support other uh indie broadcasters and any
7449860	7454580	podcasters and so forth and show the love that you've shown to us to somebody else who also
7454580	7460100	deserves it so they okay pod culture says we know we know i i know but i just i i still feel some
7460100	7465780	sort of weird obligation to kind of say like please please understand please understand
7466740	7473060	you know i i'm happy that we have been able to be there for you but we may not be able to be next
7473060	7480340	time so you know i i totally get that um in regards to you know how everybody sets their
7480340	7486580	schedule to olr on sundays something that i've been talking about in therapy about trying to
7486660	7493620	have like some type of schedule a routine and stuff like that and i use outlook to kind of
7493620	7500020	put my week together even though i know what i'm doing every day i actually have like olr
7500020	7506660	listed in outlook so when i open up my calendar it kind of helps me because you know still
7507300	7512260	job hunting and so forth you know at least when i get up it's like i have something to do
7512260	7519380	and i'm okay with it and it kind of puts my mind at ease and and as much as i love being a content
7519380	7524980	creator streaming and all that i've actually said to my group that day when i wake up and look
7524980	7533540	around my room and say this is not fun anymore i i'm done i don't want to do this anymore we will
7533540	7541700	just wrap it up and just go out on a high note and i think that's what we have to aspire to do too
7541700	7548100	you know when it inevitably is is done so yeah well hey i still have to wait to hear back from
7548100	7556500	guinness yeah i was gonna say anytime we have 20 years looming uh it would be a shame to miss that
7556500	7562420	but um if if i i think we'll get there but if we miss it one episode before 20 years there you go
7565540	7570980	so i'm i'm curious which gaming podcasts are chomping at the bit waiting for us to go off
7570980	7575460	the air so they could take the crown of longest running game because i actually don't know who
7575460	7580100	it is i don't know who comes after us i have there's like a list of five that i think are
7580100	7586660	up there i don't know who it is you know longest doesn't really seem to i mean it's i'll take
7586660	7595060	longest but like longest running show that no one knows who yeah exactly yeah i i've actually used
7595060	7599940	to say on my show from time to time the number one anime podcast in the tri-state area and it's
7599940	7604180	like well at least it's something we go to convention we can't even say that anymore because
7604180	7610100	another podcast said they're the number one in sacramento so we can't take that oh no no no no
7610100	7618100	we are we are the one the one i but i don't i don't want to pick a fight so i just kind of
7618100	7624020	smile and nod and say that's that's cute so pick a pat on the head yeah not pick a fight and you
7624020	7630020	play uh mario party online you know team team play you know but why do we have to fight for
7630020	7636020	what we know is true yeah i think i think you actually put it best before with this topic came
7636020	7641060	up years ago when that which i actually think they dropped that along i i don't know if our
7641060	7645060	shady shade came back around or what i actually think they dropped that a long time ago so to be
7645060	7652500	it's it's it's it's pretty bold to like call yourself the number one like like no is anyone
7652500	7659220	calling you that like was there a poll i mean like it it's just it's it's weird to call yourself
7659220	7664740	that but it's like it's almost like nominating like stuff for like hey this is the number one
7664740	7669620	podcast in my house i don't i i gotta watch i don't want to go down a shady slope i wanna i
7669620	7675780	want everybody to prosper but um i would say uh you know um i forgot what i was gonna say
7675780	7678260	damn it all right whatever i've been having train derailments all night
7678260	7685460	so you do listen to our show on a regular basis i remembered quick the train got back on rails
7685460	7690020	i liked the angle that i think it was dark soccer somebody took when this issue first came up years
7690020	7696580	ago um was that well why aim for just our city when we can be number one in the world and i
7696580	7701620	think that's where that i think i did say that that's where that whole number one podcast in
7701620	7707460	the galaxy and that whole joke came up yeah i think it came out of that so i'm so clever
7708340	7714020	was it that one town that was able to say that they're like the the central hub of
7714020	7718660	video games or something like that it's like it was it like in nebraska or something like that
7718660	7723540	where the video game hall of fame is or something like that where like it's like the self-proclaimed
7723540	7730740	you know capital of video games like what um sho 100 matt in chat says may not have a ton of
7730740	7735620	listeners but we're all better than most of the people out there you don't want as fans honestly
7735620	7740340	i'm starting to discover that as more and more true as the years go on you will notice knock
7740340	7746660	on wood i don't want to um curse things you'll notice no hose have showed up to this channel
7746660	7752820	now i think the reality is i'm going to just say it's because we're not using the lgbtq or black
7752820	7760340	tags which is why the hose have not shown up um or other marginalized communities um but you know
7760340	7768340	that's that's the type of attention we don't want so anyway we distanced ourselves a little
7768340	7771140	bit from your original question rama is there anything else you want to talk about
7773380	7778580	you need to jump on your iphone and download bang dream girls band party and play it and have fun
7778580	7783380	with it i want to see this switch game i looked at the screenshots i'm like this this looks like
7783700	7791540	ddr but like amplitude to me it's more like um i would say more like beatmania meets guitar here
7791540	7797700	the way it comes down because i have there's a free game uh the love live game for playstation
7797700	7803780	4 it plays kind of similar but it's kind of it's like buttons around the screen and you just got
7803780	7810500	to tap it out it's a it's a fun time waster so no i i will check it out i didn't know it was
7810500	7815220	something on the phone so that's a very easy way to check it out yeah it's that's where it started
7815220	7822820	and i mean there's tons of like rhythm games on the mobile device especially anime based ones
7823460	7829460	um i'll say this if you play the love live one don't get too deep into it because it's a mix of a
7830900	7836740	rhythm game dating sim and then you have all these like mini games and stuff i have known people who
7836740	7845140	get very competitive in it and it's like yeah take my phone away please all right uh so rama
7845140	7848020	uh rama i'm gonna let you go because i see somebody else in the green room i want to get on
7848020	7852660	the show but um thank you as always for your call everybody check out anime jam session on tuesday
7852660	7861540	nights and any other thoughts you have for us rama uh no i i think i am good okay take care
7861540	7865940	buddy thanks for the call appreciate it and congrats on your controller find be well all
7865940	7871620	right bye all right let's go right into another call before the video looks all messed up for
7871620	7875540	a little while so let's bring in our next person and hi there you're on orange launch radio who's
7875540	7884580	this uh this is yyr hey yyr welcome to the discord call-in thing we're trying how's it going sweet
7884580	7892020	it's going okay and i can unabashedly say that i have the number one game about shitting all over
7892020	7900340	people i have the number two game about that you have the number one number two game and then loki
7900340	7910260	has the number two number one number two game my head is already spinning but yes that part
7910260	7917220	what's on your mind uh well actually uh unfortunately i missed the earlier parts of the show
7917220	7920820	but uh i did wanted to i did want to bring to some people's attention
7921380	7928020	um the wonderful audience of this show uh that there are some updates to pixel poops and pixel
7928020	7933140	poops number two this week uh did were they uh with some of those already mentioned loki talked
7933140	7937540	about the updates to number two but he didn't talk about the updates to the main game if you wanted
7937540	7944260	to get into that oh okay well actually the updates to the main game are very small really um but
7944260	7949940	actually all the updates are now live on steam so if you did purchase number two on steam the next
7949940	7954740	time you open up the steam client you will notice if you have things set to automatically update
7954740	7963220	that you already have the new version of number two so get on that um but yes i decided i would
7963220	7973380	go ahead and add something to uh the base game that actually you requested rob oh shit and
7973380	7977460	literally this okay okay which one which one is it though because i think i've requested multiple
7977460	7984580	things well usually i'm pretty quick on the draw with like an episode number and an audio clip
7984580	7990180	but unfortunately i don't have those this time uh i will mention though that probably a couple of
7990180	7995860	months ago you mentioned and this probably followed a discussion about mortal combat
7995860	8002340	and the blood code and things like that and you probably said well you know i think it'd be pretty
8002340	8010580	funny if pixel poops had something like a strawberry ice cream mode where uh yes i think
8010580	8018180	i was talking about making your game family safe yes exactly so it's so is it pixel scoops now
8018180	8025540	okay this is funny because you probably haven't caught up to the episode yet but um just two weeks
8025540	8031460	ago or the the show before we took a break the little parody bump to the intro show was pumpkin
8031460	8038340	spice pixel poops oh my god i should have i thought when you said that you were putting that
8038340	8043860	in i thought that's what i got was my pumpkin spice pixel poops but this is totally updating
8043860	8052340	it again i'm i'm totally gonna like do that tomorrow i don't know but um yes uh
8056580	8064580	you have power rob um so yes there there is a now there is now a strawberry ice cream mode in
8064580	8071860	pixel poops along with a second bonus mode that my wife suggested and it's terrible and horrible and
8072260	8076420	should not have gone in there but it only took two minutes to do after doing the first
8076420	8083540	one and someone will find it funny so that went in there also and uh they're accessible via secret
8083540	8090500	codes oh remember those yes of course are they are they codes we're gonna be able to figure out
8090500	8097140	or do we get a hint or what oh no i'll just straight up give it to you um okay okay cool
8097140	8103620	insider info for olr listeners yeah i put on the patch notes that if uh if you want the codes now
8103620	8109460	you should listen to the orange flounce radio podcast but i will publish them publicly uh in
8109460	8115940	the future i guess all right cool so these are type-in codes so you'll need a keyboard to do it
8115940	8120260	and the reason i say that is because you know some people they'll game on their tv they'll
8120260	8125620	only have a controller in their hands so yes you will need a keyboard uh to enter these codes but
8125860	8130420	you enter them on the game over screen which you know it's the first screen that comes up
8130420	8136020	when you start the game when you start the app really uh and also it obviously comes up when
8136020	8141620	the game is over uh but you know don't have any menu open just be on the game over screen
8141620	8149700	it can be cycling colors or whatever to enable strawberry ice cream mode type in a b a c a b b
8149700	8158100	b isn't that like the blood code just like in a different order no it's the same oh it's the same
8159060	8164820	it is exactly the same as the sega genesis mortal combat blood code yes great great so the the
8164820	8171300	family-friendly strawberry ice cream mode is uh the blood code perfect yes exactly okay and and
8171300	8177060	for the other terrible thing that my wife suggested just press the period key six times
8179700	8186580	okay it is exactly what you think it is okay and uh both of them all they do is change the
8186580	8192100	color of the poop and uh they take effect until the game is quit and then restarted
8192100	8198180	and then it goes back to normal okay i love that do any any insight what the pumpkin spice code
8198180	8205140	might be um well right now i just have it set to use the a b and c and the period keys so
8205940	8213780	um and it's ignoring everything else and so i might just make a variation of the abac abb code
8213780	8218580	just have it be about my favorite band i don't know just that's invincibility in
8218580	8226420	akari warriors it is invincibility in akari warriors well that just makes it even funnier
8226420	8228580	and i hear from the other room abba
8228980	8239620	so even no it's abba it's not abba it's abba you get to be a dancing queen on your way to
8239620	8245460	shooting people angrily i love it just to make sure it's not too easily guessable i might just
8245460	8253060	have you have to type it in twice abba abba okay the more the better exactly so uh yeah please look
8253060	8259540	forward to that i will pumpkin spice that's hilarious i have to send you i'll have to send
8259540	8265060	you the image because i i changed the little taco cabana into a starbucks um it's really horrible
8265060	8273060	for well i'm sorry uh a um square dollars um coffee store uh and uh i all i did i did a
8273060	8277780	horrible paint job with the color over so i was like when i saw it on the uh video preview i was
8277780	8284980	like god damn that turned out ugly that makes it plenty yeah it does i realize i agree part of the
8284980	8290500	charm of the opening segments of the show is how did rob destroy photoshop this week which
8291140	8298260	plot twist i don't use photoshop i use snag it okay i expected you to say microsoft paint but
8298260	8304020	uh don't i i i'll try but snag it's kind of that also i use snag it a lot at work because it's
8304020	8310260	actually very powerful software for for those types of screenshots yeah and i'm on a mac i
8310260	8318580	don't have that problem all right uh yyr i totally appreciate the update and i'm flattered as always
8318580	8323620	that you know again you not only come to us with all the latest and greatest with your games but
8323620	8329540	that you you fucking humor us in the first place we don't deserve it we truly don't you know what
8329620	8337300	though i and and i continue to insist that if i ever do get discovered and you know things
8337300	8342420	actually start to you know i i actually make enough money to pay for my daughter's college
8342420	8349380	out of this uh i will still come to olr with all the news and updates and and uh yeah appreciate
8349380	8355060	that and appreciate you my friend gotta know your roots all right as long as you're still around
8356020	8361620	yeah yeah after that last last conversation i probably scared everybody huh uh i don't know
8361620	8366500	i think we should do something for 888 because it's triple infinity i know it's come it's it's
8366500	8370420	weird all these episode numbers i never thought we'd get to are coming up before we know it a
8370420	8377060	thousand i think i already figured out episode 1000 was going to be at disneyland no no no no
8377060	8382100	like the actual date was something like 2023 i think it was around 20 november i think if
8382100	8387540	we actually plotted the right days off it would actually be 20 november of uh 2023 but anyway
8390420	8394260	all right while we are my friends you take care we're gonna go wrap up the show and uh congrats
8394260	8400660	on uh pixel poops i hope everybody will buy it to play pumpkin spice uh strawberry ice cream and
8400660	8406100	other modes in the game ah well i'll just remind you that you don't even need to because the game
8406100	8409620	is free to play ah that's right that's what you should still you should still buy the extra stuff
8409620	8416100	anyway support the game do it all right awesome well enjoy and uh yeah have a great week take
8416100	8424500	care of my friend see you later bye-bye see you rob i did it i did a thing it wasn't free for me
8424500	8431220	because i paid for the commodore 64 version as well as pixel poops number two that i i
8431220	8436500	i would happily give yyr five dollars if he asked for it anytime maybe not every day because i do a
8436500	8444020	broke but you know i'll buy so i did a thing by the way what'd you do i i had my first pumpkin
8444020	8451220	product oh i did not i did not have a pumpkin spice i had a pumpkin product good enough i
8451220	8459540	had a pumpkin cream cheese muffin oh yummy and it was delightful one of the ones from the place with
8459540	8467460	the mermaid yes i only ate the top of it gave the rest of it to dan that's like i was looking
8467460	8474740	at the drinks and i was like a pink drink um that apple flavor is really good i know i'm so i want
8474740	8480820	to have it in a chai i don't like caramel that's fair yeah so i want to have it i hear it's uh
8481620	8487460	actually uh another probably mutual friend of ours out of other people's streams um uh
8488340	8495460	i never know exactly how to pronounce the name like gaga stirs not anyway not a name i recognize
8496100	8500980	yeah i never know how to pronounce it but i always remember seeing it um but that was a suggestion
8500980	8505300	that they made so i was like i have to try that i like chai and i like apple and the flavors would
8505300	8510420	be complementary yeah the apple stuff comes from like a brown sugar type of base see it's very easy
8510420	8515620	to dodge the caramel um and get just like that brown sugar apple stuff they use it's really good
8515940	8522580	so yeah now i did buy apple cider good call like a gallon of apple cider and i actually wondering
8522580	8528100	if i can make chai with it um since our green room is now oh by the way if you want to send

8604500	8610100	like meanwhile i had mr smoosh dramatically laying on the floor in the kitchen like he was dying
8610660	8617300	because his feeder's time has been pushed back a half hour because one of his dads me accidentally
8617300	8622260	unplugged the uh long ass cord for the feeder when i was shoving my suitcase into the closet
8623220	8633700	no anyway um so uh nickelodeon ulcer brawl uh had a a box art kind of leak i guess on the e-shop
8633700	8640580	and so we kind of get a look of what you know ang korra uh ren and simpy look like now uh because
8640580	8646180	they've got you know the character art on there so uh that's the thing no new like actual like
8646180	8652980	leaks as far as like new characters or anything from that but um yeah it's neat to see like at
8652980	8658580	least what some of the characters look like so they have that um also i should mention that
8658580	8669460	steam's 18 years old now what today's i think the anniversary of that um so yeah that's a thing and

8688740	8696900	out but yeah that's it uh dr c in chat uh says about the nickelodeon fighting game um that they
8696900	8702900	had videos of spongebob his moves are on brand and ridiculous i noticed the taunt wave gashing
8702900	8708900	the taunt was that meme you know with that that was really funny i thought that was perfect that
8708900	8715140	game looks fantastic so uh one other story i did see was that the animal crossing series one through
8715140	8720260	four amiibo cards are being reprinted and i do want to say that i was i i tend to hang out at
8720340	8727620	target on fridays when my son goes to his coding class and um they do have those cards in stock as
8727620	8732660	well as the hello kitty and san rio cards are in stock now okay you'll pick those up if you want
8732660	8738500	those cards i haven't seen them near me so if you would pick me up a san rio pack i would gladly
8738500	8744660	pay back yeah they have multiple san rio packs do you need all of them or just one um i guess i
8744660	8750660	would need all of them i mean what do you mean by multiple like like do like they're each one card
8751380	8755860	they're well it's packs of cards but they're different like steps i i have to look at it
8755860	8760420	again but like uh i did see those before and i was like why would people buy these because
8760420	8766020	it's just for the posters right so um but yeah i'll pick them up i can thank you
8768900	8772100	so that's it all right did you have anything else you want to talk about loki
8772100	8779540	or last minute stories nope all right then i guess we'll go to um wrapping up the show for
8779540	8785380	the night um let me uh go around and get everybody's final thoughts but before we do that
8786020	8790260	let me say thank you guys as always for listening to orange launch radio and supporting our show
8790260	8794500	we are the show where every gamer has a voice um so if you wouldn't mind helping us spread the
8794500	8800820	word uh tell a friend or two about the show um and that goes an awful long way an auto host here on
8801300	8807140	twitch for vog network also goes a long way in supporting the show and you certainly don't have
8807140	8811940	to but we do have a shop available over at vog network dot com slash shop if you want to buy some
8811940	8817460	merchandise some of the stuff i wore dragon con i wore the orange launch radio shirt to my friday

8823220	8829860	at vog network dot com slash shop um so uh anyway uh let's go around and get everybody's kind of like
8829860	8837780	final thoughts and wrap ups here so we'll start with uh dark sakura um i will be doing um hope
8837780	8843460	i'm gonna try to do it this month i'm gonna do a subathon um or a followathon or a bitathon
8843460	8850180	whatever it is because uh i want to do something to give back for any help that i have received
8850180	8857300	so keep your eyes open um and i also have been making merch specifically for dead by daylight
8857300	8863220	fans so let me know there will be other things in coming to the vog store for other games that
8863780	8870740	we have been discussing that aren't dead by daylight great i may even be doing a variation
8870740	8880020	of my last release for mine specifically for vog okay fun yeah nice all right um let's see uh so
8880020	8883460	i think i think you're probably gonna head off because you're gonna start your stream i am
8883540	8887780	i gotta switch uh from cammo to obs cam so we'll see you next week
8887780	8891540	meanwhile while we say goodbye to dark sakura loki what's your final thought for tonight
8892340	8897460	my final thought is i did put up a new episode of my minecraft series last week and then i have
8897460	8904020	a new one coming soon i've like i said i did a ton of stuff this week so i just i i filmed
8904020	8909460	everything and i didn't like it so i'm gonna film it again it's just the way it works um
8910260	8916900	perfectionist but i get it that's not it's not it's just like it just didn't it my last few
8916900	8921700	videos have been kind of rambly and long and i've been trying to tighten that up a bit it's more
8921700	8926180	just because i'm like i'm like i just want to just get it out you know and so i just got to do this
8926180	8932420	like mental dump type thing and i don't know if that necessarily generates more views or not but
8932420	8937060	um it is what it is so yeah the last episode was pretty cool because we decorated the shopping
8937060	8941620	district and so now it looks all pretty and everything nice and then um yes so that's a
8941620	8946820	pretty cool in the watch um but yeah there should be some new stuff coming i do want to start
8946820	8951060	streaming because right now my channel is not growing at all i mean i know you're supposed to
8951060	8956980	let the algorithm do its thing but like that takes like a couple years does take to do its thing so
8956980	8964260	it's like i hear you so we'll see maybe maybe streaming will be better i don't know or not
8964980	8968580	um well speaking of streaming i will use my final thought to give my own channel
8968580	8972740	at rob roberts here on twitch a personal plug i'm gonna be streaming no man's sky again tomorrow
8972740	8976820	night i'm trying to get a little further in expedition three who knows maybe finishing it
8976820	8980580	probably not tomorrow but at least one more night of twitch drops and then probably later in the
8980580	8985060	week if i have the time i'm gonna try to do a stream of the new warrior wear game i'll start
8985060	8990420	that from the beginning and play a little bit of that so that's my plan for the week um and then
8990420	8994900	a shout out for my husband at allen alchemy as well because excuse me he's been doing a lot of
8994900	9000740	streaming and just finished his resident evil 2 uh play with leon uh last night and he was using a
9000740	9008980	mod so that leon was running around in nothing but uh tidy grays uh not whities but tidy grays
9008980	9015540	basically it's uh of course a big pervy mod um but it was really funny uh so he played the whole uh
9015540	9020260	leon campaign with that and it made for some very funny and awkward cut scenes so now he's doing
9020260	9026740	claire um he doesn't have a similar mod for claire well it is he has a tifa mod for claire
9026740	9032180	so claire is dressed like tifa from final fantasy 7 it's still claire but wearing like that you know
9032180	9037940	white top and the yeah so it's kind of funny so check that out on his channel all right that's
9037940	9041060	going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio thank you guys so much for listening
