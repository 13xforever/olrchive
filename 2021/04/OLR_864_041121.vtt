00:00.000 --> 00:13.480
A $1 part is being blamed as the source of the holdup for new console production, along

00:13.480 --> 00:15.360
with all other electronic device production.

00:15.360 --> 00:18.180
But the outrage over a $1 part ignores the economies of scale.

00:18.180 --> 00:22.600
A general purpose, broadly applicable, inexpensive device means that millions, even billions,

00:22.600 --> 00:24.900
are created within an incredibly short timeframe.

00:24.900 --> 00:27.760
What happens when supply or demand swings dramatically for that part?

00:27.760 --> 00:29.100
A critical shortfall.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.980
This is the update for Mr. Not-An-Economist.

00:30.980 --> 00:34.340
It's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to explain more on this

00:34.340 --> 00:37.260
and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has

00:37.260 --> 00:38.260
a voice.

00:38.260 --> 00:44.820
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

00:44.820 --> 00:46.640
every gamer has a voice.

00:46.640 --> 00:53.940
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode number 864 of our

00:53.940 --> 00:57.700
show for this April the 11th of 2021.

00:57.700 --> 01:02.900
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello first off to DarkSakra or

01:02.900 --> 01:03.900
Jamie Summers.

01:03.900 --> 01:04.900
Yo.

01:04.900 --> 01:05.900
Hi, how are you?

01:05.900 --> 01:07.540
I'm all right.

01:07.540 --> 01:09.260
It's been a cool day.

01:09.260 --> 01:17.500
I got to hang out with Becky and Julian, and he's doing better, and it's been pretty good.

01:17.500 --> 01:23.220
And I'll ask you when it's your turn for how is your week?

01:23.220 --> 01:26.500
Let me introduce Loki, and then we'll come back to me.

01:26.500 --> 01:30.060
First off, the audience may not know, Julian's been dealing with some stuff.

01:30.060 --> 01:34.380
We'll just leave it at that, but it's looking hopeful, which is good.

01:34.380 --> 01:39.020
And if you don't know who we're talking about, we had him on the show, and he was probably

01:39.020 --> 01:42.100
about, you were thinking, nine years old when he was on the show talking about Minecraft,

01:42.100 --> 01:43.100
right?

01:43.100 --> 01:44.100
More like 10, yeah.

01:44.100 --> 01:48.420
He's 13 now, and tall in the last picture I saw.

01:48.420 --> 01:52.300
Yeah, he's taller than me and Becky and still growing.

01:52.300 --> 01:53.740
Oh boy, oh boy.

01:53.740 --> 01:56.060
So it'll be fun to have him back at some point.

01:56.060 --> 01:57.420
So we'll have to make that happen.

01:57.420 --> 01:58.420
He's interested in it.

01:58.420 --> 01:59.420
Awesome.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.420
All right.

02:00.420 --> 02:01.420
Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:01.420 --> 02:06.500
Yeah, because I'm 40 and I'm still talking about Minecraft, so it's fine.

02:06.500 --> 02:07.980
I love it.

02:07.980 --> 02:12.780
You have a great, you have a new microphone, which suddenly disappeared from your camera,

02:12.780 --> 02:13.780
but I like it.

02:13.780 --> 02:14.780
You have a new mic.

02:14.780 --> 02:15.780
It's because they moved it away from me.

02:15.780 --> 02:16.780
It's literally in front of my face, but yeah.

02:16.780 --> 02:19.660
Okay, well, it's great that you have a new mic.

02:19.660 --> 02:23.940
And of course, as we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geese Network, twitch.tv

02:23.940 --> 02:28.020
slash vog network, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black

02:28.020 --> 02:29.020
Wolf show.

02:29.020 --> 02:31.780
If the audio seems off to you guys, please let us know.

02:31.780 --> 02:37.340
I do try to watch it live, but like visually and what you guys really hear can often be

02:37.340 --> 02:38.900
a different thing.

02:38.900 --> 02:44.940
So I always am watching the chat to get that sort of feedback there.

02:44.940 --> 02:48.780
So all right, let's see.

02:48.780 --> 02:52.020
Tiger Claw in chat says, enter the matrix in the background.

02:52.020 --> 02:54.500
And some folks are saying, wow, it looks old.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.060
Yes, it is.

02:56.060 --> 02:57.060
It is an older game.

02:57.060 --> 02:58.060
Yeah.

02:58.060 --> 02:59.980
That was like a GameCube game, right?

02:59.980 --> 03:02.540
That was PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox.

03:02.540 --> 03:03.540
So yeah.

03:03.540 --> 03:04.540
Hmm.

03:04.540 --> 03:07.500
And now, of course, since you moved your mic from when we calibrated before the show, you're

03:07.500 --> 03:08.500
a little bit low, but that's okay.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.500
How about I move it again?

03:09.500 --> 03:10.500
Let me move it again.

03:10.500 --> 03:11.500
No, no, no, no.

03:11.500 --> 03:12.500
You're fine.

03:12.500 --> 03:13.500
You're fine.

03:13.500 --> 03:14.500
You're fine.

03:14.500 --> 03:15.500
I adjusted it on this side.

03:15.500 --> 03:16.500
You're good.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.500
All right.

03:17.500 --> 03:18.500
Let me go back to Dark Soccer because she had asked, how was my day?

03:18.500 --> 03:19.500
So, yes.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.100
And I've brought it up on the show a couple of times.

03:21.180 --> 03:23.780
I got my second COVID shot today.

03:23.780 --> 03:24.780
And I'm fine.

03:24.780 --> 03:25.780
I'm just tired.

03:25.780 --> 03:26.780
Like, but I don't know.

03:26.780 --> 03:29.780
I'm also asking the question, am I tired because the vaccine?

03:29.780 --> 03:32.020
Am I tired because I'm lazy?

03:32.020 --> 03:36.700
Or am I tired because I've actually been like super getting into walking lately, which sounds

03:36.700 --> 03:37.700
weird.

03:37.700 --> 03:43.740
But I've definitely hit this point where I'm like, wow, that COVID 19 pounds.

03:43.740 --> 03:44.900
That's very noticeable, Rob.

03:44.900 --> 03:46.220
I need to do something about this.

03:46.220 --> 03:49.940
I've been really trying to like get up and move and like use apps to do that.

03:49.940 --> 03:54.660
Not just things like Pokemon Go and gamification, but like, you know, tracking for my heart

03:54.660 --> 03:55.900
rate and things like that.

03:55.900 --> 03:59.660
So I might just be tired because I've been doing that like every day this week.

03:59.660 --> 04:02.140
Been walking at least two miles, if not more.

04:02.140 --> 04:04.500
Most days I was actually doing three or three and a half.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.780
So I might just be tired from that.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.260
But I took today off, obviously, because of getting the shot.

04:09.260 --> 04:11.660
I knew that I'd be a little bit tired.

04:11.660 --> 04:12.660
But yeah.

04:12.660 --> 04:17.820
And I also find my I'm just kind of like, ah, like, I don't know how to explain it.

04:17.820 --> 04:21.620
My brain is like I'm forgetting really weird things for OLR tonight.

04:21.620 --> 04:24.300
I remember to hit record before you ask that one.

04:24.300 --> 04:25.340
I remember.

04:25.340 --> 04:29.500
But I'm forgetting like other weird things like we weren't muted when we went live tonight.

04:29.500 --> 04:34.620
So they heard somebody cough like just weird things like that that usually aren't a problem.

04:34.620 --> 04:39.540
But trust me, whatever this is, it's way better than getting COVID itself.

04:39.540 --> 04:44.740
And I would hate for people to have these side effects that they're hearing about.

04:44.740 --> 04:49.340
Stop them from potentially getting the vaccine because everybody really should get vaccinated

04:49.340 --> 04:51.860
because that's what's going to help stop the spread of this thing.

04:51.860 --> 04:54.740
And unfortunately, you're starting to hear about there's another surge, right?

04:54.740 --> 04:55.740
Not so much in California.

04:55.740 --> 04:57.340
I think we're OK for now.

04:57.340 --> 05:02.540
But you're seeing a surge in other parts of the country because and it's it's a lot younger

05:02.540 --> 05:08.740
people are spreading it now because unfortunately, the narrative in the beginning became, oh,

05:08.740 --> 05:13.780
young people are immune to this and the survival rate is so high that nobody was talking about.

05:13.820 --> 05:15.420
But there are long term effects.

05:15.420 --> 05:19.020
And we've had somebody on this program talking about their long term effects, who is not

05:19.020 --> 05:21.380
you know, who is young, younger than 40.

05:21.380 --> 05:25.980
And, you know, people are just like tuning that kind of stuff out for whatever reason.

05:25.980 --> 05:28.020
And so now it's spreading with younger people.

05:28.020 --> 05:30.660
So just get the damn vaccine.

05:30.660 --> 05:32.580
It's not going to be that difficult.

05:32.580 --> 05:35.620
If you all get flu shots, it's like it's it's like the same thing.

05:35.620 --> 05:39.140
I don't always feel great the day I get the flu shot either, but then it's gone pretty

05:39.140 --> 05:40.140
quick.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.140
Right.

05:41.140 --> 05:42.140
And then I don't get the flu.

05:42.140 --> 05:43.140
Good stuff.

05:43.380 --> 05:44.900
So that's that's my day.

05:44.900 --> 05:47.780
I barely got to do the Pokemon Go community day today.

05:47.780 --> 05:53.140
And that was sad just because I came home and I wanted a nap.

05:53.140 --> 05:55.380
But I caught three shinies.

05:55.380 --> 05:56.540
And that's enough to have one.

05:56.540 --> 06:00.400
So the special Pokemon today is Snivy Snivy Snivy.

06:00.400 --> 06:01.400
So I caught three.

06:01.400 --> 06:04.300
So that's enough to have one of each.

06:04.300 --> 06:05.460
And that's fine by me.

06:05.460 --> 06:09.980
I don't know how many Shane got the I texted he texted me about 90 minutes into it for

06:09.980 --> 06:10.980
his.

06:10.980 --> 06:12.740
He said he was up to 23.

06:12.740 --> 06:15.260
So I'm like he probably had 100 by the time it was done.

06:15.260 --> 06:16.260
I don't know.

06:16.260 --> 06:17.260
I have to often message him.

06:17.260 --> 06:18.260
Who knows?

06:18.260 --> 06:19.260
That sounds like it.

06:19.260 --> 06:20.260
Yeah.

06:20.260 --> 06:21.260
Sounds like it.

06:21.260 --> 06:22.260
Let's see.

06:22.260 --> 06:24.540
Bobby says, I'm actually glad I got some side effects from the second shot.

06:24.540 --> 06:25.660
It told me it was working.

06:25.660 --> 06:26.660
Yes.

06:26.660 --> 06:27.660
That's very true.

06:27.660 --> 06:31.620
Act Def says Shane tweeted that he got 38 or 39.

06:31.620 --> 06:32.660
So it's so high.

06:32.660 --> 06:33.660
He lost count.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.140
How about that?

06:35.140 --> 06:36.540
That sounds accurate.

06:36.540 --> 06:37.900
That sounds very accurate.

06:37.900 --> 06:39.140
All right.

06:39.140 --> 06:42.180
Let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.

06:42.180 --> 06:45.660
Lots of talk about Sony this week in the news.

06:45.660 --> 06:47.100
Some decisions going on internally.

06:47.100 --> 06:49.500
Loki, you want to talk to us a little bit about this?

06:49.500 --> 06:53.720
Yeah, apparently, Dave decided, hey, you know what?

06:53.720 --> 06:56.940
We won a lot of awards for The Last of Us and The Last of Us 2.

06:56.940 --> 06:59.420
How about we do another The Last of Us?

06:59.420 --> 07:00.420
And so they are.

07:00.420 --> 07:07.700
They're planning right now on remaking the original Last of Us or PlayStation 5.

07:07.700 --> 07:10.200
The original Last of Us came out in 2013.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.140
It's not all that old.

07:12.140 --> 07:16.480
So I'm surprised that they're remaking it, but I'm not.

07:16.480 --> 07:24.500
They redid PS3 games for PS4, like Heavy Rain, I guess, but I'm not surprised they're doing

07:24.500 --> 07:25.500
it again.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.500
Those aren't remakes.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.500
Those are remasters.

07:28.500 --> 07:33.700
Well, somebody just to be quick, somebody came up with a good eye theory online, and

07:33.700 --> 07:34.700
I hope this is true.

07:34.700 --> 07:38.900
I think somebody replied to one of my tweets with this is that if they redo The Last of

07:38.900 --> 07:43.340
Us and put the accessibility settings the second game had, because that's what the first

07:43.340 --> 07:48.460
game is missing from 2013 is that huge range of accessibility from the second game.

07:48.460 --> 07:52.460
So if they redo the first game with that, that's going to make it playable for some

07:52.460 --> 07:53.460
people.

07:53.460 --> 07:54.460
So that's going to be a huge change.

07:54.460 --> 07:55.460
So there is that.

07:55.460 --> 07:56.460
Yeah.

07:56.460 --> 08:01.320
So right now they're sticking to making big blockbuster games.

08:01.320 --> 08:06.500
So I assume that'll be the same with The Last of Us remake, remaster, whatever you call

08:06.500 --> 08:09.700
it when it eventually comes out.

08:09.700 --> 08:14.660
But I don't know, I think it's too soon.

08:14.660 --> 08:20.940
I don't have a problem with them doing like a remake, but like a remaster, like, hey,

08:20.940 --> 08:25.620
you know what, we're bringing The Last of Us with those additional accessibility settings

08:25.620 --> 08:26.960
and we're bringing it to PlayStation 5.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.900
I don't consider that a remake.

08:28.900 --> 08:32.560
Like the Final Fantasy 7 remake is a remake.

08:32.560 --> 08:38.040
The Last of Us, if you were actually going to remake the game in its entirety for the

08:38.040 --> 08:41.060
PlayStation 5, it seems like that's way too soon.

08:41.060 --> 08:46.440
Now what about this whole talk about the Days Gone sequel that they had pitched is apparently

08:46.440 --> 08:48.560
not actually going to be happening.

08:48.560 --> 08:52.720
Like the studio that did that wanted to do like a sequel to Days Gone.

08:52.720 --> 08:55.040
And so they've decided for whatever reason, they're not going to do it.

08:55.040 --> 08:57.760
I don't know if the game just wasn't critically claimed enough.

08:57.760 --> 09:03.080
I guess some people, some people said the ending really set it up for a sequel that

09:03.080 --> 09:06.400
I guess wasn't quite ready yet.

09:06.400 --> 09:12.200
Well, I mean, it just probably wasn't as popular as The Last of Us, The Last of Us, you know,

09:12.200 --> 09:17.840
and probably, you know, even so much as like Uncharted and stuff, extremely popular franchises,

09:17.840 --> 09:18.920
Days Gone.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.520
I don't see a HBO Days Gone show.

09:21.520 --> 09:24.920
I don't see them, you know, winning tons of awards for that game.

09:24.920 --> 09:26.420
It was just kind of, it was good.

09:26.420 --> 09:31.740
And so, okay, sorry, excellent, but now, now you're really dropping the breadcrumbs into

09:31.740 --> 09:36.480
the larger piece of what is happening with all these moves for Sony this week, which

09:36.480 --> 09:42.620
is Sony seems to be infatuated with the big budget, the blockbuster games, and this is

09:42.620 --> 09:43.620
their approach.

09:43.620 --> 09:47.540
And that's the kind of just said what it is.

09:47.540 --> 09:50.320
Days Gone isn't about to become an HBO show.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.240
Days Gone doesn't have all these things going for it.

09:52.240 --> 09:57.880
But then again, Loki, Horizon Zero Dawn doesn't have a HBO show yet.

09:57.880 --> 10:00.840
But Sony definitely seems to still be sticking with that one.

10:00.840 --> 10:05.400
But Sony definitely seems to be trending towards this.

10:05.400 --> 10:11.120
They want to take, they want to put a lot of money into big, big games, big, big exclusives,

10:11.120 --> 10:18.560
and really take that that risk, which I guess is I didn't need to well, because I think,

10:18.560 --> 10:20.280
okay, go ahead.

10:20.280 --> 10:24.480
I think they kind of have to because they see the writing on the walls.

10:24.480 --> 10:31.280
I mean, Microsoft has purchased a lot of big studios like Bethesda, you know, which carries

10:31.280 --> 10:36.860
with it, you know, it and, of course, you know, the big, you know, like Elder Scrolls

10:36.860 --> 10:42.040
franchise Fallout and stuff, those are all going to be exclusive Xbox games coming soon.

10:42.040 --> 10:47.440
They have to go in on big exclusive titles, because that's what's drawing people to those

10:47.440 --> 10:48.900
platforms.

10:48.900 --> 10:54.500
I think if they're competing head to head, as far as like third party games go, I think

10:54.500 --> 10:58.220
Microsoft has a better offering there, especially with Games Pass, right?

10:58.220 --> 10:59.220
Sure.

10:59.220 --> 11:04.140
Some games, you know, with the hardware might be more polished on PlayStation five versus

11:04.140 --> 11:08.380
place, you know, Xbox Series X or something like that.

11:08.380 --> 11:11.140
But when it comes down to it, it doesn't really matter.

11:11.140 --> 11:16.540
It's like usually you'll get a console where all your all your friends are, I guess, or

11:16.540 --> 11:17.540
you're buying both.

11:17.700 --> 11:23.500
But if third party games don't really differ that greatly between two different platforms,

11:23.500 --> 11:27.940
so it's really coming down to the first party games and they really need to have something

11:27.940 --> 11:30.060
that draws people to that console.

11:30.060 --> 11:35.140
Loki, if I'm not mistaken, isn't there like it doesn't Sony seem to be moving in again?

11:35.140 --> 11:36.460
You know, here we go again.

11:36.460 --> 11:39.220
This is all about perception, not necessarily facts.

11:39.220 --> 11:45.500
But if I remember right, a smaller team was working on this Last of Us remaster, like

11:45.500 --> 11:51.180
a whole little studio that was kind of formed to do these sorts of artistic sorts of things.

11:51.180 --> 11:58.460
And then they shifted that to Naughty Dog and basically kind of this like little pet

11:58.460 --> 12:02.020
project team that wanted to do these audio visual sorts of things.

12:02.020 --> 12:06.460
They were kind of dismantled and sent throughout the company, which was kind of like a blow

12:06.460 --> 12:12.580
to, you know, their their morale and so forth, because, you know, they were very excited

12:12.580 --> 12:13.940
about what they were doing.

12:13.940 --> 12:19.660
But my point is, does Sony not see the value in what like a smaller team can do anymore?

12:19.660 --> 12:23.500
That's that's kind of a concern because, you know, yes, Microsoft is buying up all these

12:23.500 --> 12:25.100
big things like Bethesda.

12:25.100 --> 12:28.980
But what's really a strength of Game Pass right now?

12:28.980 --> 12:33.540
Game Pass has a lot of indie stuff that's on it and a lot of indies get discovered through

12:33.540 --> 12:34.540
that.

12:34.540 --> 12:35.540
Right.

12:35.540 --> 12:36.540
So.

12:36.540 --> 12:39.500
Yeah, you're muted, Loki, just, you know.

12:39.500 --> 12:42.340
I know there's so much chaos going in the background.

12:42.340 --> 12:43.340
Sorry.

12:43.340 --> 12:46.940
No, no, no, it's fine.

12:46.940 --> 12:47.940
It's fine.

12:47.940 --> 12:51.740
It's I already knew going into tonight's show, it was going to be one of those nights.

12:51.740 --> 12:53.820
Well, this brand new mic is so awesome.

12:53.820 --> 12:55.820
It picks up all of that.

12:55.820 --> 12:56.820
Right.

12:56.820 --> 12:58.860
Well, let me ask this.

12:58.860 --> 13:03.780
Let me ask Dark Sakura, what do you think about Sony's approach here where it seems

13:03.780 --> 13:09.680
like they're really shifting to we're going to be about the big triple A games and maybe

13:09.680 --> 13:13.600
not so much the smaller stuff?

13:13.600 --> 13:15.040
I think it's unsurprising.

13:15.040 --> 13:24.240
I think that they're really looking, I think, for the higher dollar items, things that are

13:24.240 --> 13:32.620
going to maybe not be able to go again for the entire, you know, for a wider spread group

13:32.620 --> 13:39.200
of players, but something that's going to be for a the majority of their players.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.200
Does that make sense?

13:40.200 --> 13:41.200
Yeah.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.200
Yeah.

13:42.200 --> 13:47.200
Something that's going to bring in more focused revenue, I reckon.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.200
Yeah.

13:48.200 --> 13:53.560
And it's really about not just having exclusives, but big exclusives.

13:53.560 --> 13:54.560
Exactly.

13:54.560 --> 13:55.560
Yeah.

13:55.560 --> 13:59.760
And I mean, maybe that's where they've discovered that that's really excuse me, their bread

13:59.760 --> 14:00.760
and butter.

14:00.760 --> 14:08.960
I mean, I am I'm really in the place where I kind of want to just wait and see, you know.

14:08.960 --> 14:09.960
Sure.

14:09.960 --> 14:18.960
But I mean, I think they're going to lose opportunity with less focus on the indie.

14:18.960 --> 14:26.440
So all I'm hoping for is that, you know, they they still have that support, at least a degree

14:26.440 --> 14:29.520
of support for for that particular group.

14:29.520 --> 14:30.520
Yeah.

14:30.520 --> 14:34.880
And, you know, if Sony is going to come up with some kind of answer to Microsoft Game

14:34.880 --> 14:40.040
Pass, it would really behoove them to, you know, if the strength of, you know, the smaller

14:40.040 --> 14:46.040
the the BNC games, for lack of a better description, if that's not going to be able to really come

14:46.040 --> 14:50.080
from Sony's first party, then they're really going to have to form those relationships,

14:50.080 --> 14:54.320
not necessarily buying in total acquisitions, but those relationships to really help with

14:54.320 --> 14:56.300
the BNC and the indie stuff.

14:56.300 --> 15:00.920
Because I, you know, and I don't think it is I wouldn't want to read into this that

15:00.920 --> 15:04.280
Sony's turning their back on indies, because not necessarily.

15:04.280 --> 15:07.620
I mean, that could be part of their larger, you know, publishing and distribution.

15:07.620 --> 15:10.680
This is about what they're doing in house.

15:10.680 --> 15:17.480
But I mean, if they don't try to get some exclusives in that area with the BNC, I worry

15:17.480 --> 15:21.300
that they're going to miss out on the next Minecraft, the next Among Us, the next Five

15:21.300 --> 15:24.580
Nights at Freddy's, which, well, to be fair, they do have a Five Nights at Freddy's game

15:24.580 --> 15:25.580
coming.

15:25.580 --> 15:27.840
But so maybe maybe that answers my question.

15:27.840 --> 15:32.200
But, you know, they might miss out on the next like huge Twitch phenomenon.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.200
You know what I mean?

15:33.200 --> 15:34.200
Yeah.

15:35.120 --> 15:38.640
But it's, you know, but the only ones that they're going to have to blame for that would

15:38.640 --> 15:39.640
be themselves.

15:39.640 --> 15:40.640
Yeah.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.520
Well, and then and they will survive whatever happens.

15:43.520 --> 15:46.360
So, you know, they'll just regroup and start over.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.760
And all those games you're talking about aren't first party games anyways.

15:48.760 --> 15:52.560
They're I mean, you may have some license by them, but they're all being developed by

15:52.560 --> 15:53.560
third parties.

15:53.560 --> 15:58.840
It just sometimes they may be console exclusives or something like that for a time period.

15:58.840 --> 16:01.260
But that's not Sony themselves, actually.

16:01.260 --> 16:02.880
But the partnerships, but the partnerships.

16:02.880 --> 16:05.760
That's what I yeah, they can kind of supplement with that.

16:05.760 --> 16:08.840
But I'm going back to kind of what dark soccer was saying is about, you know, that's a that's

16:08.840 --> 16:10.880
a that's going to be a problem with them.

16:10.880 --> 16:13.760
You know, I saw an interesting article this week and I see chat comments, too.

16:13.760 --> 16:14.760
I'm not ignoring you guys.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.240
I promise I'll get to your chat comments as well.

16:16.240 --> 16:19.400
There's a lot to devour with this.

16:19.400 --> 16:24.680
I saw an interesting story this week about how Sony needs to get an answer to Game Pass,

16:24.680 --> 16:25.680
basically.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.200
So where is Sony's answer to Game Pass?

16:27.200 --> 16:31.120
And I is in some Facebook community, I mean, I actually replied and I said, I'm starting

16:31.120 --> 16:34.000
to think Sony doesn't need an answer to Game Pass.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.480
Sony needs an answer to Phil Spencer.

16:36.480 --> 16:39.720
And I don't want to sound like a fanboy.

16:39.720 --> 16:45.600
And I would hope my, you know, 19 year resume of this show and so forth show that, you know,

16:45.600 --> 16:47.760
I do embrace all the gaming systems.

16:47.760 --> 16:48.760
I love them.

16:48.760 --> 16:51.720
And I also scold them when they need a little bit scolding.

16:51.720 --> 16:57.460
But I'm starting to get a little bit worried about the leadership.

16:57.460 --> 16:58.920
It's not we're not in a.

16:58.920 --> 17:00.920
And I will say we're not in a dire situation yet.

17:00.920 --> 17:05.160
We're not in a Don Mattrick is driving this into the ground situation yet.

17:05.160 --> 17:09.560
But we've got the tone deafness on backwards compatibility.

17:09.560 --> 17:15.480
We've got the fact that we didn't foresee Game Passes of success and we don't really

17:15.480 --> 17:17.600
have an answer to that.

17:17.600 --> 17:22.840
Or if you want to say, but PlayStation now, OK, PlayStation now is not positioned appropriately

17:22.840 --> 17:28.580
to compete with Game Pass because not cloud gaming is not being embraced by the masses

17:28.580 --> 17:32.220
yet the way I think people thought it would be at this point.

17:32.220 --> 17:37.820
And now we have this story, which sure sounds a lot like Sony just wants to do blockbusters

17:37.820 --> 17:39.660
and forget the little stuff.

17:39.660 --> 17:43.020
I don't think that's 100 percent the case again.

17:43.020 --> 17:45.440
There's a partnership, but it's that perception, right?

17:45.440 --> 17:48.220
And it is starting to make me think.

17:48.220 --> 17:54.500
Maybe it seems like a lot of this weird stuff with Sony sure happens in the past couple

17:54.500 --> 17:58.140
of years since we changed who's at the top.

17:58.140 --> 17:59.940
And that's very important and can trickle down.

17:59.940 --> 18:02.760
Meanwhile, you've got Microsoft and Phil Spencer.

18:02.760 --> 18:09.440
And I mean, he he he knows his shit and he's like he's they've been swinging and hitting

18:09.440 --> 18:11.340
it out of the oh, the MLB thing.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.540
That's just from last week.

18:12.540 --> 18:16.500
That's another one where it's like, how did Sony let that happen?

18:16.500 --> 18:17.500
Yes.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.800
I know it was the MLB that actually.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.500
But how did Sony let that happen?

18:22.500 --> 18:24.740
You know, I mean, because they didn't have a response.

18:24.740 --> 18:25.740
Sorry, Loki.

18:25.740 --> 18:27.020
Oh, I was going to say.

18:27.020 --> 18:32.120
And also, since we were talking about them being focused on blockbusters, I mean, look

18:32.120 --> 18:36.580
at some of the games that are coming out on from Microsoft or I guess some of their studios

18:36.580 --> 18:43.540
like Rare, like, for example, they developed and published Battletoads.

18:43.540 --> 18:44.820
Who would have thought that would happen?

18:44.820 --> 18:51.900
We're not going to see a jumping flash coming from Sony any time soon, because it's not

18:51.900 --> 18:56.220
popular and it's not making a ton of money or winning awards.

18:56.220 --> 18:58.100
And so that's something that they're not going to pursue.

18:58.100 --> 19:00.780
They're going to pursue more of these cinematic games.

19:00.780 --> 19:04.980
And honestly, I don't know, I'm just kind of bored of that stuff.

19:04.980 --> 19:05.980
Yeah.

19:05.980 --> 19:11.180
Let me get to some of the comments from chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, because

19:11.180 --> 19:15.260
I don't want to make it sound like I'm ignoring, sorry, Quest Buster saying that was sad.

19:15.260 --> 19:19.180
The studio that saw The Last of Us remake project as a way to break away from assisting

19:19.180 --> 19:24.500
with games to doing bigger projects aimed at eventually making their own down the line.

19:24.500 --> 19:29.500
And Quest Buster says to add to this, Days Gone Well did apparently did well commercially,

19:29.500 --> 19:32.700
but critically, it wasn't enough to justify a sequel.

19:32.700 --> 19:36.280
SSG100Matt, very interesting here.

19:36.280 --> 19:38.220
This feels very Disney.

19:38.220 --> 19:41.560
They're only interested in titles that will net massive returns.

19:41.560 --> 19:46.460
So if that game is great, but doesn't make that massive return, they'll kill any sequel

19:46.460 --> 19:47.460
plans.

19:47.460 --> 19:53.700
Just puts a lot of pressure on those titles to do massively well.

19:53.700 --> 19:58.540
And Bobby Blackwell is talking about the whole MLB thing, saying, well, Sony let that happen

19:58.540 --> 20:02.140
because if they didn't, they wouldn't be able to make the MLB game anymore.

20:02.140 --> 20:08.140
And we'd be seeing EA Sports triple play 21, MLB totally strong arm Sony on that one.

20:08.140 --> 20:11.220
Yes, but I get that part.

20:11.220 --> 20:14.540
I'm not questioning why did the game go to Xbox?

20:14.540 --> 20:17.500
Why did the game go to Xbox Game Pass?

20:17.500 --> 20:22.040
And okay, sure, you might say it's the MLB strong arm, but I would question why didn't

20:22.080 --> 20:28.440
Sony see that Game Pass was the competitor that it is because they've had the chance

20:28.440 --> 20:33.680
much earlier down the line and have something of their own to offer the Major League Baseball

20:33.680 --> 20:34.680
team.

20:34.680 --> 20:37.840
You should put the game on this service because, okay, we're going to be multi platform, but

20:37.840 --> 20:41.360
Sony is still the home of this game through this service.

20:41.360 --> 20:48.960
That is what I'm saying is the missed opportunity and that it went over to Game Pass as a result.

20:48.960 --> 20:53.320
And Bobby says, Sony came out this week and said they had no say in the Game Pass decision.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.320
Yes.

20:54.320 --> 21:00.960
And last week I said that would happen sort of, because I said, you're going to have all

21:00.960 --> 21:05.880
these YouTubes and all these podcasts that are only going to read it in the headline.

21:05.880 --> 21:10.680
Sony put a game on Game Pass, even though, you know, I know we all know that talked about

21:10.680 --> 21:11.680
this.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.280
That's not really what happened.

21:13.280 --> 21:17.280
But perception is that Sony let it happen.

21:17.280 --> 21:22.280
And so that's why Sony had to come out and say, we didn't do it.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.520
Because you have all these other tweets.

21:24.520 --> 21:27.760
You have these Facebook comments, you have everything else that's like, Sony's putting

21:27.760 --> 21:31.160
a game on Game Pass, lol.

21:31.160 --> 21:35.320
So anyway, yeah, let's see.

21:35.320 --> 21:38.960
Other comments here.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.360
DJ Rama S says, I think it's a Sony thing.

21:41.360 --> 21:45.260
A lot of games that come out on PlayStation first will end up coming out on Xbox sometime

21:45.260 --> 21:47.300
later as a digital release.

21:47.300 --> 21:48.300
Sure.

21:48.300 --> 21:52.740
You know, especially a lot of like the Final Fantasy stuff, although Final Fantasy 7 Remake,

21:52.740 --> 21:56.060
we you know, the year is up that it should have been an exclusive and we're not seeing

21:56.060 --> 21:57.060
that on Microsoft.

21:57.060 --> 21:59.140
So it's not happening everywhere.

21:59.140 --> 22:01.500
But yes, you know, we have seen some things.

22:01.500 --> 22:07.300
I want to I'm trying to think if it goes vice versa to have we seen something that came

22:07.300 --> 22:13.640
out on Xbox that then showed up on Sony later on drawing a blank.

22:13.640 --> 22:15.480
Was Tomb Raider exclusive or is that Sony?

22:15.480 --> 22:16.480
Bingo!

22:16.480 --> 22:17.480
No, it was the sequel.

22:17.480 --> 22:18.480
It was Rise of the Tomb Raider.

22:18.480 --> 22:21.480
It was that way.

22:21.480 --> 22:23.080
That was a while ago at this point.

22:23.080 --> 22:27.900
And I think that was Microsoft buying time for all the studio acquisitions they were

22:27.900 --> 22:28.900
doing.

22:28.900 --> 22:29.960
OK, Cuphead.

22:29.960 --> 22:30.960
That's a little bit better.

22:30.960 --> 22:33.240
Yeah, that's good.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.200
Anyway.

22:35.200 --> 22:38.320
Are the Ori games on PlayStation, asks Act F. No, they are not.

22:38.320 --> 22:39.600
They're on Switch.

22:39.600 --> 22:40.600
That's a whole other thing.

22:40.600 --> 22:41.600
All right.

22:42.480 --> 22:44.120
Sony making some interesting moves.

22:44.120 --> 22:49.720
You know, again, I don't necessarily see this particular headline as doom and gloom.

22:49.720 --> 22:54.760
But when you kind of put the whole thing together, it really does look like Sony's leadership

22:54.760 --> 22:58.500
is going in a very interesting new direction.

22:58.500 --> 23:03.560
And I'm not sure it's going to be a net positive.

23:03.560 --> 23:06.640
At the end of the day, we'll let the game speak for themselves and perhaps I will be

23:06.640 --> 23:07.640
wrong.

23:07.640 --> 23:08.640
And that's fine.

23:08.680 --> 23:14.800
I just worry all this stuff about no game pass competitor, no backwards compatibility

23:14.800 --> 23:16.080
and some of these other decisions there.

23:16.080 --> 23:19.320
And now, you know, now we don't have, you know, as many of the pet projects.

23:19.320 --> 23:21.920
I just worry some of these things are going to come back and bite them in the butt.

23:21.920 --> 23:26.520
And I again, I think the MLB thing, although, yes, there's other factors at play there,

23:26.520 --> 23:27.920
I think is an example of that.

23:27.920 --> 23:31.080
And I don't think that's the last time we're going to hear something like that.

23:31.080 --> 23:33.760
So anyway, let's move on.

23:33.760 --> 23:36.480
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing

23:36.480 --> 23:37.480
this week.

23:38.320 --> 23:40.080
How was your gaming week?

23:40.080 --> 23:41.560
It was different.

23:41.560 --> 23:48.160
I did, of course, play Animal Crossing and I'm playing Wordscape still, but I started

23:48.160 --> 23:51.680
playing around in Dead by Daylight and I've done the tutorials.

23:51.680 --> 23:57.640
And sadly, I need to rethink my streaming setup because I have to play it full screen

23:57.640 --> 24:00.660
to do it through Stadia so I wouldn't be able to watch chat.

24:00.660 --> 24:05.080
So I've had to uninstall like some extensions I did to play it windowed because it still

24:05.080 --> 24:06.080
won't work.

24:07.080 --> 24:10.600
Some people use their phones to monitor or like a tablet to monitor.

24:10.600 --> 24:11.600
Well, that's what I'm saying.

24:11.600 --> 24:15.120
I'm going to be using my iPad to monitor the chat.

24:15.120 --> 24:23.120
So I also have updated Dead by Daylight Mobile on my iPad and I'm going to give that one

24:23.120 --> 24:24.120
a go too.

24:24.120 --> 24:29.040
Actually, can we take a step back because you kind of said something very quickly there,

24:29.040 --> 24:32.440
but it's something we haven't really gone into a lot on this show.

24:32.440 --> 24:35.680
You mentioned that you were playing this on Stadia and I think that's kind of interesting

24:35.680 --> 24:40.640
because you know, I think I've talked about, I'm not a big fan of the bandwidth conception,

24:40.640 --> 24:43.480
all that and so forth, but you're actually in there.

24:43.480 --> 24:44.480
You bought the game.

24:44.480 --> 24:45.480
You're using Stadia.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.320
How is Stadia itself working for you?

24:47.320 --> 24:48.800
Are you enjoying that?

24:48.800 --> 24:55.280
Well, all I've done is play that game and it might be enough that I will be going back

24:55.280 --> 25:04.320
to paying for the full account for the, what do they call it, pro.

25:04.320 --> 25:05.960
But it's played really smoothly.

25:05.960 --> 25:09.200
It looks great on my Mac.

25:09.200 --> 25:12.680
So I haven't really had any problems with it.

25:12.680 --> 25:15.400
I haven't played an online game yet.

25:15.400 --> 25:21.960
I've just been trying to get the game worked out for me, but I haven't had any kind of

25:21.960 --> 25:25.800
latency playing on that or anything too crazy so far.

25:25.800 --> 25:26.800
It's been pretty good.

25:26.800 --> 25:27.800
Yeah.

25:27.800 --> 25:30.160
I'll be curious how that continues to work out for you.

25:30.160 --> 25:33.080
And Bobby in chat says, Stadia, the technology works great.

25:33.080 --> 25:34.080
That is true.

25:34.080 --> 25:37.860
A lot of these things with Stadia was never really about the technology, it was just kind

25:37.860 --> 25:39.720
of about how they're rolling it out.

25:39.720 --> 25:41.040
So there is that.

25:41.040 --> 25:47.080
But the nice thing about Dead by Daylight in particular is that it's cross-play.

25:47.080 --> 25:53.560
So you're going to be right in there with everybody else on Steam, Microsoft Store,

25:53.560 --> 25:55.580
Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, all of it.

25:55.580 --> 25:59.080
So you don't have to worry about anything like that.

25:59.080 --> 26:04.240
And you also make a very interesting use case for Stadia about the whole playing it

26:04.240 --> 26:09.920
on a Mac, which, of course, there's games on the Mac, but we know that there's been

26:09.920 --> 26:14.320
a disconnect for some time about how many games are on PC versus Mac.

26:14.320 --> 26:17.140
But this is a very interesting bridge.

26:17.140 --> 26:22.920
And it almost makes me think as more and more cloud gaming rolls out, as more and more fast

26:22.920 --> 26:29.480
internet becomes accessible, I think these days of, you know, whatever system is not

26:29.480 --> 26:32.480
going to matter as much as much as cloud gaming starts to get bigger.

26:32.480 --> 26:33.800
But I guess that's a ways off.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.880
But you do make a very interesting use case.

26:36.880 --> 26:43.600
And honestly, now, I mean, I would hate for this to go away and leave me with no way to

26:43.600 --> 26:44.600
play my game.

26:44.600 --> 26:45.600
Yeah.

26:45.600 --> 26:46.600
Yeah.

26:46.600 --> 26:47.600
That would be.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.600
Yeah.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.880
What would happen if Google Stadia were to suddenly close?

26:50.880 --> 26:51.880
I don't.

26:51.880 --> 26:52.880
I have one.

26:52.880 --> 26:55.920
I think you'd have a couple of years while a transition plays out.

26:55.920 --> 27:00.560
And I think Google would kind of owe you a redemption of the game on another platform

27:00.560 --> 27:04.560
or something like or a place you could download it on another platform.

27:04.560 --> 27:05.560
But who knows?

27:05.560 --> 27:06.560
Who knows?

27:06.560 --> 27:07.560
One would think.

27:07.560 --> 27:10.400
Yeah, I guess Google's not talking about it, because why would they?

27:10.400 --> 27:13.920
They don't want to talk about what happens when it goes under, because from their perspective,

27:13.920 --> 27:15.320
it's never going under.

27:15.320 --> 27:16.320
So yeah.

27:16.320 --> 27:17.320
So they hope.

27:17.320 --> 27:18.320
Yeah.

27:18.680 --> 27:23.760
Everybody frantically downloading their PlayStation 1 games on their PlayStation 3 and Vita and

27:23.760 --> 27:26.080
all that stuff would beg to differ.

27:26.080 --> 27:27.280
Right.

27:27.280 --> 27:28.280
So there is that.

27:28.280 --> 27:33.800
But I've been, for the most part, I mean, for the bits I've been able to do on it, I've

27:33.800 --> 27:36.080
been pretty darn happy with it.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.080
Mm hmm.

27:37.080 --> 27:38.080
Great.

27:38.080 --> 27:39.080
All right.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.080
Let's move on to Loki.

27:40.080 --> 27:41.080
How was your gaming week?

27:41.080 --> 27:47.000
It has been Minecraft, as I kind of mentioned, and I streamed a little bit on Friday.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
I rated you.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
It was good fun.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
Yes.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Yes.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
It was great.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.840
It's hard streaming when you're in a kitchen and there's a cat screaming at you and everybody's

27:55.840 --> 28:01.640
asleep and you have to be quiet because you don't have a sound isolated place to be.

28:01.640 --> 28:02.640
But yeah.

28:02.640 --> 28:03.840
So I've been playing on this.

28:03.840 --> 28:09.080
I got invited to this server that mimics.

28:09.080 --> 28:13.560
I want to say mimicking, but it's emulating, I guess, what HermaCraft does.

28:13.560 --> 28:16.340
They're a pretty popular group of Minecraft streamers.

28:16.340 --> 28:21.180
So it's a bunch of people that are kind of getting in the streaming, playing together

28:21.180 --> 28:23.060
about 30 people.

28:23.060 --> 28:26.900
And it's a survival multiplayer server.

28:26.900 --> 28:29.420
And I haven't played Java in forever.

28:29.420 --> 28:30.500
I'm used to Bedrock.

28:30.500 --> 28:37.700
So I've been playing with an expaterons to use my joystick to actually, or joystick.

28:37.700 --> 28:39.500
What am I in the 80s?

28:39.500 --> 28:43.920
My gamepad to actually be able to play that because normally it's keyboard and mouse and

28:43.920 --> 28:45.980
I don't play keyboard and mouse.

28:45.980 --> 28:46.900
It's too hard for me.

28:46.900 --> 28:49.900
So it's been working out pretty good.

28:49.900 --> 28:56.180
And with the shaders now, since I'm playing Java, oh my God is so gorgeous.

28:56.180 --> 28:58.020
It is incredibly.

28:58.020 --> 29:02.260
One thing I noticed right when I rated you, I was like, he got the 4K pack that never

29:02.260 --> 29:03.260
came out.

29:03.260 --> 29:05.260
I know it's the Nvidia thing.

29:05.260 --> 29:06.740
Yeah, that whole thing.

29:06.740 --> 29:08.260
It's not even Nvidia.

29:08.260 --> 29:12.580
It's just like, it's just the built-in Optifine shaders or it's BSD is I think is what it

29:12.580 --> 29:13.580
is.

29:13.580 --> 29:15.620
And it just looks so nice.

29:16.340 --> 29:21.740
This is how it should be on Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5.

29:21.740 --> 29:23.660
It should look that nice.

29:23.660 --> 29:29.900
And I don't understand, like Java's really the least optimized, I think as far as graphics

29:29.900 --> 29:30.900
goes.

29:30.900 --> 29:33.340
But man, it is so beautiful.

29:33.340 --> 29:34.980
It's such a beautiful game.

29:34.980 --> 29:39.860
The only issue I have is the mob sound is so loud and I don't know what it is if it's

29:39.860 --> 29:42.700
just I'm used to Bedrock or whatever.

29:42.700 --> 29:46.540
I've turned it down to 50% and actually lower, but it's just like screaming.

29:46.540 --> 29:50.500
I went into a dungeon the other day or close to a dungeon.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.900
It was just so loud.

29:52.900 --> 29:57.620
But what I'm hoping to do is I'm hoping to be able to turn this into like playing regularly,

29:57.620 --> 30:01.300
uploading to YouTube regularly, doing some streaming and stuff like that and actually

30:01.300 --> 30:07.140
get into the whole like streaming and content creation on a regular basis.

30:07.140 --> 30:11.820
That's my goal because I hate my corporate job so much.

30:11.820 --> 30:15.660
I will do anything to get out of it, anything at all.

30:15.660 --> 30:20.860
So I'll try this for a little bit, but it's going to be a labor of love for a long time.

30:20.860 --> 30:21.860
Look at that.

30:21.860 --> 30:22.860
Look at this show.

30:22.860 --> 30:24.300
It's just like, yeah.

30:24.300 --> 30:25.300
So it's fun.

30:25.300 --> 30:27.540
Eighteen years and we're breaking even.

30:27.540 --> 30:31.220
Yeah, I'm having a lot of fun with it.

30:31.220 --> 30:33.260
I haven't met anybody on the server yet.

30:33.260 --> 30:36.500
I've been playing for like three days, but like, I'm kind of far away from everybody

30:36.500 --> 30:38.620
and they had a month's head start.

30:38.620 --> 30:42.700
So everything's been kind of ransacked already, which kind of sucks.

30:42.700 --> 30:45.660
It puts me a little bit behind, but I'm slowly getting there.

30:45.660 --> 30:49.540
I've been just grinding, but it'll be fine eventually.

30:49.540 --> 30:53.860
If it's anything like Hermitcraft, it's going to be, you know, trying to build these giant

30:53.860 --> 30:58.980
builds throughout the course of the season, which I think they're planning on probably

30:58.980 --> 31:02.620
updating in when one seventeen comes out.

31:02.620 --> 31:05.700
So that's probably going to be in the summer sometime, probably at least like three or

31:05.700 --> 31:06.700
four months.

31:06.700 --> 31:08.220
But it's been fun.

31:08.820 --> 31:10.340
I mean, everyone seems nice so far.

31:10.340 --> 31:15.180
I just haven't actually played with anybody, but I'm enjoying it and I'm excited about

31:15.180 --> 31:16.180
it.

31:16.180 --> 31:17.180
Awesome.

31:17.180 --> 31:21.060
And just to the folks watching on Twitch know, Loghi's audio is coming through fine, but

31:21.060 --> 31:24.780
your video's like very choppy, like only a few frames a second.

31:24.780 --> 31:28.220
I don't know if that's the video you're running in the background or what, but yeah, it's

31:28.220 --> 31:29.820
probably other things.

31:29.820 --> 31:33.420
I think I still have, oh yeah, I still have Streamlabs OBS from earlier.

31:33.420 --> 31:36.220
It's not doing anything.

31:36.220 --> 31:37.220
I'll just close this thing.

31:37.220 --> 31:38.220
Yeah, it's still my...

31:38.220 --> 31:39.220
Let's see it.

31:39.220 --> 31:40.220
Oh, did it make a difference?

31:40.220 --> 31:41.220
How about that?

31:41.220 --> 31:42.220
It made a difference.

31:42.220 --> 31:43.220
No?

31:43.220 --> 31:44.220
Well, a little bit.

31:44.220 --> 31:45.220
I don't know.

31:45.220 --> 31:46.220
A little bit.

31:46.220 --> 31:47.220
I don't know.

31:47.220 --> 31:48.220
Yeah, it seems to be better now.

31:48.220 --> 31:49.220
Yeah, a little bit.

31:49.220 --> 31:50.220
You're a little lagged, but that's all right.

31:50.220 --> 31:51.220
It'll probably just take a minute to catch up.

31:51.220 --> 31:55.220
If you probably close your camera and restart it thing, it'll probably catch up.

31:55.220 --> 31:56.220
All right.

31:56.220 --> 31:57.980
Meanwhile, I'll talk about my gaming week.

31:57.980 --> 31:59.540
So I've played a few games this week.

31:59.540 --> 32:02.620
I've been continuing in No Man's Sky, which I talked about last week.

32:02.620 --> 32:09.220
You know, I'd really started that five nights of streaming the Expeditions mode, and I streamed

32:09.220 --> 32:10.740
one more night on Friday.

32:10.740 --> 32:12.660
That's the one I rated Loki after that.

32:12.660 --> 32:15.580
So I've been continuing on the Expeditions, and I've gotten to the point where I'm playing

32:15.580 --> 32:19.300
a little bit off stream because some of it was starting to feel a little bit grindy and

32:19.300 --> 32:21.420
I didn't think it would make for an interesting stream.

32:21.420 --> 32:24.300
And also just the fact that, you know what, sometimes I just want to be a fat vegetable

32:24.300 --> 32:28.520
on the couch and play the game and not have to worry about being on and interacting with

32:28.520 --> 32:29.660
folks and all that stuff.

32:29.700 --> 32:34.140
I love doing it when I'm in the mood for it, but sometimes I just want to, you know, chill

32:34.140 --> 32:36.380
and explore space.

32:36.380 --> 32:37.380
That's for sure.

32:37.380 --> 32:43.420
You know, sometimes just, you know, chill out and just enjoy space and not necessarily

32:43.420 --> 32:46.140
have to perform.

32:46.140 --> 32:48.260
So what else?

32:48.260 --> 32:52.700
I've been playing Dead by Daylight still.

32:52.700 --> 32:54.860
Thanks to my murder sister.

32:54.860 --> 32:58.100
We have new characters in the house.

32:58.100 --> 33:01.020
My murder sister, of course, is Dark Sakura because she keeps funny.

33:01.020 --> 33:03.180
I think I said I said my murder mom.

33:03.180 --> 33:04.180
That sounds a little creepy.

33:04.180 --> 33:07.660
So murder sisters a little better because she actually is a sister.

33:07.660 --> 33:13.620
And you bought me the obviously you bought me Freddy and you know how that went.

33:13.620 --> 33:16.340
That became like Freddy's my main killer now.

33:16.340 --> 33:21.900
And I had a hell of a game like yesterday morning where these little assholes, like

33:21.900 --> 33:26.280
three of them were together and they were just there to bully the killer by sabotaging

33:26.280 --> 33:27.280
the hook.

33:27.600 --> 33:31.440
And as soon as I picked someone up, the other two would run to the nearest hooks and sabotage

33:31.440 --> 33:32.440
them.

33:32.440 --> 33:33.920
And they kept doing this over and over.

33:33.920 --> 33:37.080
I four killed them and I was so happy about it.

33:37.080 --> 33:40.080
And I had to be I had to be a complete dick to do it.

33:40.080 --> 33:42.680
I had to tunnel one of them completely.

33:42.680 --> 33:43.680
But it was worth it.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.860
It was so worth it.

33:45.860 --> 33:48.640
Because when you're doing that, you can't really work on gens.

33:48.640 --> 33:51.380
So at some point they had to run out and work on gens.

33:51.380 --> 33:54.880
And I was able to kind of time it right so I could hook one of them and tunnel them and

33:54.880 --> 33:56.800
not let them get rescued anyway.

33:56.800 --> 34:02.120
So I was very naughty and kind of violated the code that you're not really supposed to

34:02.120 --> 34:03.120
tunnel survivors.

34:03.120 --> 34:04.120
But you know what?

34:04.120 --> 34:05.120
They were dicks.

34:05.120 --> 34:06.120
They deserved it.

34:06.120 --> 34:07.120
They were being dicks.

34:07.120 --> 34:08.120
Exactly.

34:08.120 --> 34:09.880
When you start trolling, then I'm going to troll.

34:09.880 --> 34:10.880
That's that.

34:10.880 --> 34:14.040
So question for you, Rob, do you play with a keyboard or do you play with a controller?

34:14.040 --> 34:15.540
I play with a controller.

34:15.540 --> 34:16.540
And it always...

34:16.540 --> 34:17.540
That's what I'm thinking about doing.

34:17.540 --> 34:19.000
It always impresses Alan.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.840
He's like, I don't know how the hell you play that game on controller.

34:22.880 --> 34:28.400
Well, it's just that I've been having some problems, especially when I have to run.

34:28.400 --> 34:32.280
This is only during the survivor one because I don't think the killers run, do they?

34:32.280 --> 34:33.280
No.

34:33.280 --> 34:37.880
Well, I mean, you might have somebody that gets a burst of speed, like the hillbilly

34:37.880 --> 34:42.160
uses the chainsaw and has a burst of speed, but not like running in the sense like survivors

34:42.160 --> 34:43.160
do.

34:43.160 --> 34:44.160
No.

34:44.160 --> 34:45.160
Yeah.

34:45.160 --> 34:49.460
But it's just sort of like the hard time I'm having is hitting, for example, to hold control

34:49.460 --> 34:53.420
to crouch or something where I think it would be better having shoulder buttons for something

34:53.420 --> 34:54.420
like that.

34:54.420 --> 34:55.420
Yeah.

34:55.420 --> 34:56.840
And actually, um, the default is it's a little on Xbox.

34:56.840 --> 35:00.420
The bumper left is a run and the bumper right is crouch.

35:00.420 --> 35:01.420
Okay.

35:01.420 --> 35:07.140
So, well, and I actually, I've got a stadia controller because I got stadia thing.

35:07.140 --> 35:08.140
Yeah.

35:08.140 --> 35:09.140
Check it out.

35:09.140 --> 35:14.440
The only thing, the only thing about controller, it's, you can't flip a 180 and sometimes survivors

35:14.440 --> 35:18.740
will loop you like they'll run around you type of thing to try to, cause, um, in dead

35:18.740 --> 35:21.680
by daylight, the killers have to play first person.

35:21.680 --> 35:23.880
The survivors play third person.

35:23.880 --> 35:28.760
And that actually is a very interesting dynamic because the survivors will use it to kind

35:28.760 --> 35:32.760
of like run a loop around the killer, literally a loop around the killer so that the killer

35:32.760 --> 35:34.280
kind of swings and misses.

35:34.280 --> 35:39.040
And now the killer's running the other way and on a controller that sucks because you

35:39.040 --> 35:42.480
have to hold the stick down while you turn around, right?

35:42.480 --> 35:44.320
It's fast, but it's enough.

35:44.320 --> 35:47.520
Whereas on keyboard and mouse, you'd just be like, you can just like fling around real

35:47.520 --> 35:48.520
fast.

35:48.520 --> 35:49.520
Right?

35:49.520 --> 35:51.020
So that's the one down there.

35:51.020 --> 35:56.540
I really wish they would make it so that if you click R3 or whatever it is, if you click

35:56.540 --> 35:58.020
that stick, then it flips.

35:58.020 --> 36:01.020
I would be very happy if they did that.

36:01.020 --> 36:05.780
So is it like an, uh, like something that you hit on the keyboard to flip or, or what?

36:05.780 --> 36:08.660
Um, no, it's just somebody would drag their mouse that fast.

36:08.660 --> 36:11.340
You know how, like with a mouse and keyboard, you can do a quick swipe of the mouse.

36:11.340 --> 36:12.620
You'd spin around real fast.

36:12.620 --> 36:17.500
Well, see, I use a track ball, so I don't know that I would have that ability anyway.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.360
Oh, um, yeah, I don't know.

36:19.360 --> 36:21.360
It might be a little different.

36:21.360 --> 36:23.360
So yeah, it might be moot.

36:23.360 --> 36:24.640
It doesn't ruin the game or anything.

36:24.640 --> 36:28.500
I still play it, but it is, it is one of those things where, you know, Alan is like, how

36:28.500 --> 36:29.500
do you do that?

36:29.500 --> 36:32.480
But at the same time, the controller, I think also has a lot of advantages as well.

36:32.480 --> 36:36.360
I think in the, in the way I move, um, but anyway, I digress.

36:36.360 --> 36:43.640
Well, and also the, remember, I used to play, um, Final Fantasy 11 with a controller for

36:43.640 --> 36:44.640
a long time.

36:44.640 --> 36:45.880
They did macros and everything.

36:45.880 --> 36:46.880
Sure.

36:47.260 --> 36:49.940
Technically that's what the game was built for on the PS2.

36:49.940 --> 36:50.940
Yeah.

36:50.940 --> 36:51.940
Yeah.

36:51.940 --> 36:55.860
So, um, I've also, uh, been playing in Dead by Daylight.

36:55.860 --> 36:57.040
You bought me the spirit.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.140
So I did do a match or two with her.

36:59.140 --> 37:00.140
Um, it was rough.

37:00.140 --> 37:01.140
I'm not going to lie.

37:01.140 --> 37:02.140
It was rough.

37:02.140 --> 37:05.220
I think I still need some talents to make her more useful.

37:05.220 --> 37:09.860
I like her in theory, but it's going to like, it's not like with Freddy where Freddy was

37:09.860 --> 37:10.860
great right away.

37:10.860 --> 37:11.860
Yeah.

37:11.860 --> 37:12.860
Yeah.

37:12.860 --> 37:15.060
So this would be a little different.

37:15.060 --> 37:19.720
And on top of that, I was reading that she does actually have quite the significant curve

37:19.720 --> 37:20.720
to learn.

37:20.720 --> 37:21.720
So yeah.

37:21.720 --> 37:22.720
Yeah.

37:22.720 --> 37:28.560
Um, and I think with the last bit of money, cause, uh, murder mom sent or murder sister

37:28.560 --> 37:33.520
sent 10 bucks, uh, to Alan for, uh, him to get the trickster, which happened.

37:33.520 --> 37:35.460
And then that was leftover money for me.

37:35.460 --> 37:39.240
So I haven't spent it yet, but I will also probably buy trickster just because I want

37:39.240 --> 37:42.800
his talents and what is it?

37:42.800 --> 37:43.800
Starstruck or something.

37:43.940 --> 37:47.120
Starstruck is pretty incredible and they're rebalancing him next week.

37:47.120 --> 37:50.040
So cause he has, he's perceived a little weak right now.

37:50.040 --> 37:52.140
So they're going to kind of buff him this week.

37:52.140 --> 37:57.340
Well, I just, I think he's absolutely entertaining to watch people play him.

37:57.340 --> 37:58.340
Yeah.

37:58.340 --> 38:03.680
So I did on top of that, his blades are actually kind of unfair because you can do so many

38:03.680 --> 38:04.680
of them.

38:04.680 --> 38:05.680
Yeah.

38:05.680 --> 38:06.680
Yeah.

38:06.680 --> 38:09.100
Um, I did one more survivor match.

38:09.100 --> 38:13.240
You know, I never play survivor, but I did play and I went up against trickster, uh,

38:13.240 --> 38:15.540
and we escaped the trick.

38:15.540 --> 38:16.820
The trickster just was bad.

38:16.820 --> 38:20.940
Like I had, there's no, it's not a nice way for me to say it, but yeah, new, a newer killer.

38:20.940 --> 38:23.760
They did not leave the center house at all.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.220
Like they only stuck in that until the exit gates were already open.

38:26.220 --> 38:27.940
It was pretty like, what are you doing anyway?

38:27.940 --> 38:28.940
All right.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.100
This isn't a dead by daylight podcast though.

38:30.100 --> 38:35.940
I mean it could be, but well, I actually dark soccer, I really think, um, you and I should

38:35.940 --> 38:39.420
do a stream and I think we'll do a surprise stream.

38:39.420 --> 38:40.620
We're not going to date it.

38:40.620 --> 38:45.400
We'll do it when we feel like it, but you and I should do like, um, OLR bonus stage

38:45.400 --> 38:50.860
or OLR extra stage where, uh, I play some dead by daylight and you can, uh, provide

38:50.860 --> 38:57.240
commentary and all that stuff because you already are more into the lore in this game

38:57.240 --> 38:58.240
than I am.

38:58.240 --> 39:01.600
Cause you were like, have you heard about this theory about how Nia is the entity?

39:01.600 --> 39:08.920
And I'm like, girl, girl, I maybe read two bios and then I jumped in and played the game.

39:09.460 --> 39:17.060
Honestly though, if you go in and write on all the bios and stuff are on the Wiki and

39:17.060 --> 39:23.940
it's honestly a very well concocted story on top of that, especially how they blended

39:23.940 --> 39:29.380
in like the DLC stuff, the licensed characters and whatnot.

39:29.380 --> 39:35.120
And I was just randomly just looking up stuff online and I found a fanfic and I read it

39:35.120 --> 39:41.180
from beginning to end all 30 chapters of it that was talking of, it was about like

39:41.180 --> 39:43.900
the, cause you know, the pig was Amanda from Saul.

39:43.900 --> 39:44.900
Right.

39:44.900 --> 39:45.900
Of course.

39:45.900 --> 39:46.900
Yeah.

39:46.900 --> 39:48.940
It was talking about her regaining her humanity and something and becoming a survivor and

39:48.940 --> 39:53.940
blah, blah, blah, different new things, but the way that they blended, uh, like as crossover

39:53.940 --> 39:56.400
fiction with the saw universe.

39:56.400 --> 40:01.240
And then of course there was Ashley, there was blended with evil dead, but it was the

40:01.240 --> 40:06.600
way that these lores can be combined and integrated.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.580
It was actually pretty cool.

40:08.580 --> 40:13.440
And it was really that story that had me really thinking a bit more about you're actually

40:13.440 --> 40:16.960
dealing with a multiverse in the form of the entities realm.

40:16.960 --> 40:17.960
Right.

40:17.960 --> 40:18.960
Yes.

40:18.960 --> 40:19.960
Yeah.

40:19.960 --> 40:24.180
And, and so I was, I I've been digging into the character lore and the history of them

40:24.180 --> 40:27.860
and the characters are actually pretty well flushed out.

40:27.860 --> 40:30.780
And I feel really sorry for some of the killers.

40:31.580 --> 40:34.880
It's interesting, you know, I'm sorry, I just said, we're not going to talk about this,

40:34.880 --> 40:36.820
but I have to say this.

40:36.820 --> 40:42.180
Dead by daylight is, is an interesting phenomenon because it's not the best looking game.

40:42.180 --> 40:46.880
It's not really even mechanically the best multiplayer game out there.

40:46.880 --> 40:51.980
It's not like it's, it's not really the best game out there, honestly, let's be real.

40:51.980 --> 40:53.920
It's not the best game on the market right now.

40:53.920 --> 40:56.400
It's the fun you have, but it's fun.

40:56.400 --> 40:58.480
And I don't, you all know how I feel about horror movies.

40:58.480 --> 41:02.440
I'm not even that into it, but it's, it's oddly fun.

41:02.440 --> 41:03.440
So and it's not gross.

41:03.440 --> 41:04.440
That's the other thing.

41:04.440 --> 41:05.440
I just don't like gross horror.

41:05.440 --> 41:06.920
And honestly, it's not, this game isn't gross.

41:06.920 --> 41:07.920
It's not that bad.

41:07.920 --> 41:08.920
Not really.

41:08.920 --> 41:12.020
I mean, there's no actual like wound when you're on the hook.

41:12.020 --> 41:15.760
Even when Pyramid Head like does the sword and goes flush and swipes someone.

41:15.760 --> 41:16.760
That's all.

41:16.760 --> 41:19.440
It's, it's like, it's like Mortal Kombat three level fatality.

41:19.440 --> 41:23.920
Like it's not like, like Mortal Kombat X when things are getting too real.

41:23.920 --> 41:24.920
It's still very cartoony.

41:24.920 --> 41:31.400
Like one of the memento mori, you know, which is the kill move, which by the way, it's a

41:31.400 --> 41:37.240
fatality in fiction is when people call, when people refer to terminology that a player

41:37.240 --> 41:41.600
knows as something that the characters know that annoys me.

41:41.600 --> 41:48.960
So anyway, going back to, going back to that, you know, even while like the, their mores

41:48.960 --> 41:52.300
are pretty, pretty brutal looking.

41:52.300 --> 41:53.300
They're not gory.

41:53.300 --> 41:54.300
Yeah, exactly.

41:54.300 --> 41:57.860
And by the way, I think that Ghostface has the best mori to sing.

41:57.860 --> 41:59.420
That's what a lot of people say.

41:59.420 --> 42:02.020
Bobby Block Wolfenchatz reminds us of a key point.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.420
Games are supposed to be fun.

42:03.420 --> 42:09.240
And DJ Rama S says this, and yeah, there's a certain X factor about Dead by Daylight

42:09.240 --> 42:11.160
that just, it's just fun to play.

42:11.160 --> 42:15.240
And I think, and the reason why I bring this up after what Dark Sakura said, I think some

42:15.240 --> 42:19.320
of that whole, like, I love that comparison of it's the multiverse.

42:19.320 --> 42:22.740
It's because this game came out in 2016.

42:22.740 --> 42:25.880
People were barely talking about it because everybody was playing that Friday the 13th

42:25.880 --> 42:32.480
game at first, but then they got Michael Myers, then they got Bubba from Texas Chainsaw Massacre,

42:32.480 --> 42:37.920
then they got Ghostface, then they got Pyramid Head, then they got Amanda from Saw.

42:37.920 --> 42:40.360
And I think you nailed it.

42:40.360 --> 42:45.320
This is now like 80s, 90s horror movie multiverse.

42:45.320 --> 42:48.000
The only thing they're missing is Jason.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
They're missing Jason.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
That's it.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.820
That's obviously a whole other complicated licensing thing.

42:52.820 --> 42:56.660
And I'm sure that is the end game for Dead by Daylight is they'd love to get Jason, but

42:56.660 --> 42:57.660
that's very complicated.

42:57.660 --> 42:58.660
But anyway, go ahead.

42:58.660 --> 42:59.660
You say the demogorgon.

42:59.660 --> 43:05.660
But I forgot what I was going to say, but I did actually, I linked you a while back

43:05.660 --> 43:11.380
some parody animation where Jason keeps showing up in the killer shack, which by the way,

43:11.380 --> 43:14.660
the killers group call themselves the hookers.

43:14.660 --> 43:15.660
That's what they do.

43:15.660 --> 43:16.660
They put people on hooks.

43:16.660 --> 43:19.000
The parody videos are hilarious too.

43:19.000 --> 43:23.520
And it's just, I like the fandom that's built up around it too, but I've been watching a

43:23.520 --> 43:31.640
lot of people playing and trying to get my, um, get a feel for how other people play before

43:31.640 --> 43:33.740
I jump in and do it myself.

43:33.740 --> 43:38.720
And I'm playing through the tutorial a couple of times, uh, to get my, my hang on the controller

43:38.720 --> 43:40.880
before, before I play through it.

43:40.880 --> 43:41.880
Yeah.

43:41.880 --> 43:45.680
It's, it's, it's a lot to learn at first, but if the matchmaking does you right, then

43:45.680 --> 43:49.340
you'll be matched with a killer that doesn't know what they're doing either or vice versa.

43:49.340 --> 43:51.100
So it'll, it'll be, uh, be good.

43:51.100 --> 43:52.100
Anyway.

43:52.100 --> 43:53.100
Sorry.

43:53.100 --> 43:56.940
I do want to move on another topic, but just the whole idea of, I think this game is, is

43:56.940 --> 44:00.920
hitting it right now because it has created that multiverse of like eighties and nineties

44:00.920 --> 44:03.460
horror movies, which a lot of people grew up on.

44:03.460 --> 44:05.200
And what's fascinating about dead by daylight.

44:05.200 --> 44:11.240
It has a huge queer following on Twitch, huge, but I was blown away.

44:11.240 --> 44:17.140
There are a lot of queer individuals that I, that really identify and grew up with that

44:17.140 --> 44:21.580
eighties and nineties, you know, horror movie, because a lot kind of identify with the final

44:21.580 --> 44:22.620
girl syndrome.

44:22.620 --> 44:25.700
We can do a whole other podcast on this and I'm sure other podcasts exists.

44:25.700 --> 44:31.180
Uh, and it's weird for me to talk about because I'm like that I'm gay, but I'm not as into

44:31.180 --> 44:34.660
horror movies as everybody else is, but I get it.

44:34.660 --> 44:37.180
Like I listen to other people and why they enjoy it once.

44:37.180 --> 44:38.180
Yeah.

44:38.180 --> 44:39.180
Yeah.

44:39.180 --> 44:40.300
I can't watch gratuitous gore, you know.

44:40.360 --> 44:45.160
I liked cube, even though that movie's probably one of the goriest I've ever seen.

44:45.160 --> 44:52.520
Hypercube to me is not a great movie, but I love it because I like the theory behind

44:52.520 --> 44:53.520
it.

44:53.520 --> 44:54.520
You know what I mean?

44:54.520 --> 44:55.520
Yeah.

44:55.520 --> 44:56.520
That's yeah.

44:56.520 --> 44:57.520
I don't like horror movies, but I love sci-fi.

44:57.520 --> 45:01.240
Cube was such a low budget movie.

45:01.240 --> 45:03.480
It basically used the same set over and over.

45:03.480 --> 45:04.480
Oh yeah.

45:04.480 --> 45:09.680
Have you watched the, um, didn't I saw the, they like, uh, the Japanese have remade cube.

45:10.060 --> 45:11.060
Oh, I heard about that.

45:11.060 --> 45:12.060
Yeah.

45:12.060 --> 45:13.060
Yeah.

45:13.060 --> 45:14.060
I heard about that.

45:14.060 --> 45:15.060
Yeah.

45:15.060 --> 45:16.060
I'm going to have to find that.

45:16.060 --> 45:17.060
Yeah.

45:17.060 --> 45:18.060
Anyway.

45:18.060 --> 45:19.060
Yeah.

45:19.060 --> 45:20.060
I'm with business lamp in our chat room over at a twitch.tv slash vog network who says

45:20.060 --> 45:21.060
horror movies.

45:21.060 --> 45:22.060
Scally.

45:22.060 --> 45:23.060
Yeah.

45:23.060 --> 45:24.060
That's me.

45:24.060 --> 45:28.260
When I saw the descent in the theater, let me tell you, I was clenched everywhere the

45:28.260 --> 45:33.500
entire time that movie that that is the first time I have cried.

45:33.500 --> 45:34.500
That is a movie.

45:34.500 --> 45:37.900
That's the first time I've ever cried from being so scared and scared in a movie that

45:37.900 --> 45:38.900
I'm telling you

45:39.120 --> 45:44.880
this is one movies ever giving me, given me, uh, nightmares and it was poltergeist three.

45:44.880 --> 45:47.040
I was afraid of mirrors for awhile.

45:47.040 --> 45:48.040
Yeah.

45:48.040 --> 45:50.960
Uh, as she went ahead and Matt and chat says, there's sleepaway camp.

45:50.960 --> 45:51.960
Okay.

45:51.960 --> 45:56.560
See some horror movie, some horror movies are so like, that's, that's the kind of horror

45:56.560 --> 46:01.480
movie I enjoy because that is more literal camp, not like just in the name, but that

46:01.480 --> 46:02.880
is a camp movie.

46:02.880 --> 46:08.160
And that's why I like that movie because it's like, it's like pink flamingos bad, you know,

46:08.160 --> 46:09.160
but it's fun.

46:09.160 --> 46:10.160
Anyway.

46:10.160 --> 46:11.160
All right.

46:11.160 --> 46:12.160
Fuck.

46:12.160 --> 46:13.160
We just went on like a 20 minute tirade on dead by daylight.

46:13.160 --> 46:15.380
Anyway, let me talk about other games in my game.

46:15.380 --> 46:17.340
Mass Effect in a way.

46:17.340 --> 46:18.340
Okay.

46:18.340 --> 46:21.220
Well, let's talk about the third game I played this week, which some are comparing to Mass

46:21.220 --> 46:26.680
Effect in some ways I've been playing Outriders, uh, which just came out on game pass on Xbox.

46:26.680 --> 46:31.420
And um, I don't think it's like Mass Effect for the record, but, um, it's, it's sci-fi

46:31.420 --> 46:36.700
it's in the future, but it's like even Mass Effect feels more hopeful and optimistic

46:36.700 --> 46:38.340
than Outriders does so far.

46:38.340 --> 46:41.080
Outriders is a very dreary setup and plot.

46:41.080 --> 46:46.160
Um, and it's, um, you know, not pleasant in that regard, but I do find this story very

46:46.160 --> 46:47.160
fascinating.

46:47.160 --> 46:49.240
I'm going to give Outriders a massive props.

46:49.240 --> 46:54.560
They are definitely creating a world, a universe that you're interested in and you're starting

46:54.560 --> 46:58.600
to kind of want to peel back the layers on why is this going on?

46:58.600 --> 46:59.600
What is that?

46:59.600 --> 47:02.100
I'm not going to spoil what's happening in the game too much, but there's a lot of setup

47:02.100 --> 47:04.080
for like, why is this happening?

47:04.080 --> 47:06.860
And you're kind of going through a lot of this, like with the main character in the

47:06.860 --> 47:07.860
game.

47:07.860 --> 47:11.580
Um, I'm not usually into the shooty shooty bang bang games.

47:11.580 --> 47:16.700
Um, even though this one is a third person and not first person, um, I guess you could

47:16.700 --> 47:18.940
say it's a little more Gears of War in that regard.

47:18.940 --> 47:19.940
Am I right?

47:19.940 --> 47:21.540
Was Gears of War a third person?

47:21.540 --> 47:22.540
Yeah.

47:22.540 --> 47:23.540
Okay.

47:23.540 --> 47:25.540
Well, it is both, but yeah, a lot of people did.

47:25.540 --> 47:27.220
A lot of people did it in third person.

47:27.220 --> 47:32.700
So, um, uh, it's interesting in that regard, but I will say my one little read on the game

47:32.760 --> 47:36.760
is that for me, the battles are starting to feel a little same-sy, like I'm kind of doing

47:36.760 --> 47:37.760
the same thing over and over.

47:37.760 --> 47:39.240
Oh, I'm going into a big room.

47:39.240 --> 47:40.240
There's a bunch of trenches there.

47:40.240 --> 47:43.240
Well, there's just going to be a gauntlet of enemies coming after me.

47:43.240 --> 47:45.240
Better call out my turret, my rockets and all that stuff.

47:45.240 --> 47:46.600
I do like the abilities though.

47:46.600 --> 47:47.600
They're fun.

47:47.600 --> 47:51.880
But the story is interesting enough that I want to keep peeling back and, uh, seeing

47:51.880 --> 47:53.160
more in what's in there.

47:53.160 --> 47:55.120
And I hear the multiplayer is a lot of fun too.

47:55.120 --> 47:58.480
I haven't really touched it yet, but maybe that's something I'll do in this next week.

47:58.500 --> 48:03.780
I know that a lot of people have been playing and enjoying Outriders, um, even though I

48:03.780 --> 48:07.220
guess they had some launch issues, but I didn't notice any of it because the day it launched,

48:07.220 --> 48:09.500
I was still busy doing the No Man Sky drops.

48:09.500 --> 48:11.920
So I didn't get into Outriders until like a week after everybody else.

48:11.920 --> 48:13.980
So I guess it was all fixed by the time I got in there.

48:13.980 --> 48:14.980
So there is that.

48:14.980 --> 48:19.220
Uh, Questbuster in chat says, as a loot shooter, I'm really enjoying Outriders, especially

48:19.220 --> 48:21.700
with the possibilities that the crafting opens up.

48:21.700 --> 48:22.700
Yeah.

48:22.700 --> 48:25.900
Um, Borderlands, as Joan heard Matt says, it's Gears of War beats Borderlands.

48:25.900 --> 48:27.520
That's a very good comparison.

48:27.520 --> 48:32.440
I was, yeah, I was thinking it's more like a, a third person Borderlands.

48:32.440 --> 48:34.500
So that's a very good comparison, I think.

48:34.500 --> 48:36.060
So, um, more to come on that.

48:36.060 --> 48:37.500
I haven't played a ton of ton of it.

48:37.500 --> 48:38.700
I've played a few of the quests.

48:38.700 --> 48:40.980
Um, I, I'm at the point where I can team up.

48:40.980 --> 48:42.660
I'm at the point where I've picked a class.

48:42.660 --> 48:45.460
Like you have to play a little bit of the game before you even get there.

48:45.460 --> 48:49.740
So, um, uh, yeah, I've played a little bit into it, so, uh, I'll try to play some more

48:49.740 --> 48:50.740
this week.

48:50.740 --> 48:53.460
There's one more game I've played, but we're going to be talking about it in a couple of

48:53.460 --> 48:54.460
stories anyway.

48:54.460 --> 48:55.660
So I'll talk about it then.

48:55.660 --> 49:00.120
So we need to move on and get into the rest of our show because I've talked a lot about

49:00.120 --> 49:03.800
my gaming week and, uh, uh, the kickoff topic and all that stuff.

49:03.800 --> 49:07.640
And here it was supposed to be a tired and slow night for me, but I guess I'm just running

49:07.640 --> 49:09.640
on pure adrenaline right now.

49:09.640 --> 49:12.440
Probably when the show is over, I'm going to pass the fuck out.

49:12.440 --> 49:16.680
All right, let's get into the news though, before we get to that point.

49:16.680 --> 49:18.860
So Loki, why don't you start us off?

49:18.860 --> 49:24.420
So after speculation for quite a while, we finally got confirmation from the ESA that

49:24.420 --> 49:28.520
yes, E3 2021 is still happening.

49:28.520 --> 49:32.320
It's going to be an all digital, all free event because there was that rumor that there

49:32.320 --> 49:37.480
was, it was going to be a paid event, um, and it's supposed to run between June 12th

49:37.480 --> 49:38.480
through the 15th.

49:38.480 --> 49:44.280
And it's going to feature Nintendo, Xbox, Capcom, Konami, Ubisoft, Take-Two Interactive,

49:44.280 --> 49:48.800
Warner Brothers and, uh, Kosh Media.

49:48.800 --> 49:54.120
And apparently though, uh, there's still the other events going on.

49:54.120 --> 49:56.100
We don't really know exactly what we'll see.

49:56.100 --> 49:59.340
I'm assuming just probably like some press conferences and stuff like that.

49:59.340 --> 50:02.940
Uh, surprised to see Nintendo in there as well.

50:02.940 --> 50:08.660
Um, but interesting, especially when Nintendo usually does their own tree house thing the

50:08.660 --> 50:09.660
whole time.

50:09.660 --> 50:13.180
So it sounds like money was involved with that one.

50:13.180 --> 50:15.180
Um, so we'll see.

50:15.180 --> 50:18.740
Um, but anyways, yeah, they're going to have that.

50:18.740 --> 50:23.820
Um, and then they're planning on doing like a lease right now they're planning on for

50:23.820 --> 50:29.300
an in-person event next year, hopefully assuming everything, uh, gets better by that time.

50:29.300 --> 50:34.800
So I'm curious to see, I always like hearing the, you know, the news and everything.

50:34.800 --> 50:38.360
Um, I'm curious to see what's going to be announced.

50:38.360 --> 50:40.960
Um, but at least now we have a date.

50:40.960 --> 50:46.380
I'm also, I'm not sure if we know the dates yet for like, uh, the, you know, um, Jeff

50:46.380 --> 50:48.180
Keeley thing and stuff like that.

50:48.180 --> 50:52.360
So we'll, we'll have to see what else is going to be out around that time as well.

50:52.400 --> 50:56.320
Do you think maybe like, uh, E3 is going to be the big budget stuff and the Jeff Keeley

50:56.320 --> 50:58.680
event ends up being indie and lower budget stuff.

50:58.680 --> 50:59.680
And that's not me being shady.

50:59.680 --> 51:05.180
That's, you know, among us is indie and you know, on that list.

51:05.180 --> 51:06.180
That's kind of surprising.

51:06.180 --> 51:07.180
Good point.

51:07.180 --> 51:08.180
No, it's not.

51:08.180 --> 51:09.880
They didn't do the last E3.

51:09.880 --> 51:10.880
They're over E3.

51:10.880 --> 51:11.880
Oh yeah.

51:11.880 --> 51:15.840
They're, they're building their, you know, big blockbuster games.

51:15.840 --> 51:17.400
So you're right.

51:17.400 --> 51:23.140
They could do, um, uh, Jeff Keeley's thing because I'm thinking of, uh, Hideo Kojima,

51:23.140 --> 51:26.000
but that's, that's not a Sony Jeff Keeley thing.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.540
That's a Kojima Jeff Keeley thing.

51:27.540 --> 51:30.700
But remember how like, you know, every Jeff Keeley event was, what's the latest update

51:30.700 --> 51:31.700
on Death Stranding?

51:31.700 --> 51:32.700
Yeah.

51:32.700 --> 51:33.700
The longest time.

51:33.700 --> 51:34.700
Yeah.

51:34.700 --> 51:35.700
Yeah.

51:35.700 --> 51:40.920
So, um, I don't know, interest to see what they announce because right now I don't have

51:40.920 --> 51:43.640
anything exciting that I'm looking forward to this year coming out.

51:43.640 --> 51:45.640
So I would like something.

51:46.080 --> 51:47.080
Yeah.

51:47.080 --> 51:53.520
Especially, especially with the Panini going on in the world still, you know, um, it'd

51:53.520 --> 51:58.000
be interesting to kind of hear, like, what are the game companies like, what has been

51:58.000 --> 52:02.440
kind of slowed down by that, that maybe we'll finally get to this year as hopefully, you

52:02.440 --> 52:06.200
know, more and more get vaccinated and hopefully we get to the other side of this thing.

52:06.200 --> 52:10.360
But, um, yeah, I'm hoping it'll be a better year this year than it was last year.

52:10.360 --> 52:16.080
But at the same time, you know, we have to be understanding that this whole world situation

52:16.080 --> 52:22.040
and working from home, it is, in game development, it is harder for working to work from home

52:22.040 --> 52:25.760
than it is to be in person, unless you're a one man studio.

52:25.760 --> 52:26.760
That's really it.

52:26.760 --> 52:27.760
That's true.

52:27.760 --> 52:28.760
Yeah.

52:28.760 --> 52:29.760
So, all right.

52:29.760 --> 52:33.960
Um, anyhow, we'll, uh, we'll, the interesting thing is we can, we can fully participate

52:33.960 --> 52:36.480
with E3 for the first time in years.

52:36.480 --> 52:37.480
Yeah.

52:37.480 --> 52:40.280
So that'll be fun.

52:40.280 --> 52:42.960
We'll see what we're going to do about that closer to the event.

52:42.960 --> 52:45.240
Maybe we'll do some nightly recaps or something.

52:45.240 --> 52:46.240
We'll see.

52:46.240 --> 52:47.240
I don't know.

52:47.240 --> 52:51.000
It just kind of depends again on what's going on with, with COVID and all that.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
All right.

52:52.000 --> 52:55.720
So I mentioned there was one other game I played this week and, uh, it's this, uh, surprise

52:55.720 --> 52:59.920
release that came out on the Nintendo switch Pac-Man 99.

52:59.920 --> 53:05.000
So obviously there is, there's a void in our hearts because Mario was killed by Nintendo

53:05.000 --> 53:07.220
on March 31st, as we know.

53:07.220 --> 53:09.920
And that switch, uh, yes.

53:09.960 --> 53:12.600
And became a ghost and is now in Pac-Man.

53:12.600 --> 53:13.600
Okay.

53:13.600 --> 53:19.320
Uh, but Mario 35, uh, went the way of, uh, you know, uh, being, being unplugged, uh,

53:19.320 --> 53:20.320
with that.

53:20.320 --> 53:25.080
Now Tetris 99 is still a thing, but it looks like the same developers that brought us both

53:25.080 --> 53:29.440
these games, cause this honestly looks like a cookie cutter template from both those games,

53:29.440 --> 53:30.440
but that's okay.

53:30.440 --> 53:31.440
It's a good game.

53:31.440 --> 53:33.760
Uh, has brought us Pac-Man 99.

53:33.760 --> 53:37.020
It's the new bonus for Nintendo switch online members.

53:37.060 --> 53:42.260
So I will give Nintendo one gold star, even though they killed Mario, I will give them

53:42.260 --> 53:46.200
one gold star because I said they should have had something ready to go when they killed

53:46.200 --> 53:47.200
Mario.

53:47.200 --> 53:49.020
Well, here they did have something ready to go when they killed Mario.

53:49.020 --> 53:50.680
So here you go.

53:50.680 --> 53:54.540
One gold star for Nintendo for having something ready to go.

53:54.540 --> 54:00.140
So Pac-Man 99 came out and it's, um, it's, it's like Tetris and Mario 99, but with Pac-Man.

54:00.140 --> 54:03.440
Uh, it's a 99 player battle royale, hence the name.

54:03.440 --> 54:07.960
And it combines a little bit of regular Pac-Man with Pac-Man championship edition.

54:07.960 --> 54:13.480
So it looks like regular Pac-Man and the maze is like Pac-Man, but the concept of ghosts

54:13.480 --> 54:20.200
with ghost trails and how the dots restock on the board as you eat fruit and finish certain

54:20.200 --> 54:23.200
parts of the board that comes from Pac-Man championship edition.

54:23.200 --> 54:26.080
So it is a very interesting blend of both games.

54:26.080 --> 54:32.520
Um, and as you, uh, eat ghosts, then you send jammer Pac-Man's to your opponents.

54:33.160 --> 54:36.080
They're ghost Pac-Man that if you run into them, they slow you down.

54:36.080 --> 54:39.120
And obviously when you're trying to escape ghosts, that's bad because it is a battle

54:39.120 --> 54:40.120
royale game.

54:40.120 --> 54:41.440
You hit a ghost, you're out.

54:41.440 --> 54:42.440
Period.

54:42.440 --> 54:43.640
So these games go by pretty quick.

54:43.640 --> 54:48.840
Uh, if you really want to fuck up your opponents though, you get the little ghosts and add

54:48.840 --> 54:52.640
them to a ghost train so that when you eat the power pellet, you eat like 20 ghosts at

54:52.640 --> 54:56.840
a time and just send those little jammer Pac-Man's flying to your opponents.

54:56.840 --> 54:58.880
And that is essentially the game.

54:59.800 --> 55:05.240
They have like a million different skins for this game, for like every Namco franchise.

55:05.240 --> 55:07.800
Like you could make your Pac-Man board look like Mappy.

55:07.800 --> 55:10.600
I know that's a game that Dark Soccer has enjoyed.

55:10.600 --> 55:13.400
You can, you can make it look like the Tower of Druaga.

55:13.400 --> 55:18.800
You can make it look like Dragon Spirit, uh, Rally-X, like it's like every Namco classic

55:18.800 --> 55:21.600
Dig Dug, uh, is, it has some type of skin.

55:21.600 --> 55:23.440
Of course you got to pay money for it.

55:23.480 --> 55:30.560
So, so the, the game is free asterisk, but just like Tetris 99, if you want the additional

55:30.560 --> 55:34.880
modes or you want the additional skins, then you got to pay a little bit of money for that.

55:34.880 --> 55:37.880
Or just pay 25, I think it is to unlock everything.

55:37.880 --> 55:40.440
So, um, but the game, the game's fine.

55:40.440 --> 55:41.440
It's fun.

55:41.440 --> 55:42.440
I enjoyed it.

55:42.440 --> 55:46.640
I don't know if it's something I'd play forever, but, um, it was, it's a cute little thing.

55:46.640 --> 55:49.080
So anyway, uh, and it was also brought to my attention.

55:49.080 --> 55:51.520
There's an interesting Bamani connection to this game.

55:51.520 --> 55:52.600
Did you know that?

55:52.600 --> 55:53.920
So, and this is on Twitter.

55:53.920 --> 55:54.920
Yeah.

55:54.920 --> 56:00.520
So sampling masters, mega, who you might remember did some of the old 2DX songs and then they've,

56:00.520 --> 56:02.640
they've done stuff for Namco in the past.

56:02.640 --> 56:05.960
Well, sampling masters, mega made the music in this game.

56:05.960 --> 56:06.960
So how about that?

56:06.960 --> 56:07.960
Yeah.

56:07.960 --> 56:08.960
So there's a little bit of a Bamani connection there.

56:08.960 --> 56:14.360
Uh, you can see more information about that over on, uh, uh, the, uh, composer for sampling

56:14.360 --> 56:15.360
master.

56:15.360 --> 56:20.360
Um, Ayako Sasso, A Y A K O underscore S A S O.

56:20.360 --> 56:21.360
Pretty cool stuff.

56:22.120 --> 56:26.160
All right, let's move on dark Sakura.

56:26.160 --> 56:32.800
So, um, switching gears to go into the world of plush things for money.

56:32.800 --> 56:36.600
Um, there was the animal crossing, build a bear thing.

56:36.600 --> 56:42.520
Um, they went on sale, um, on a Tuesday morning of this past week.

56:42.520 --> 56:44.960
And of course it was a clusterfuck.

56:45.040 --> 56:53.040
They had a virtual queue so that people could, you know, buy, uh, their, uh, their animals,

56:53.040 --> 56:57.000
which of course, um, there's going to be, I think, sold in stores later, but it was

56:57.000 --> 56:59.600
only, you know, Tom Nook and Isabelle.

56:59.600 --> 57:05.160
But basically the way that worked is that you start your queue at 10 30 AM on the website,

57:05.160 --> 57:07.520
and then you'll be randomly assigned a place in line.

57:07.520 --> 57:11.400
And when your turn comes up, you'll have a short amount of time to buy items from the

57:11.400 --> 57:13.880
animal crossing new horizons collection.

57:13.880 --> 57:20.640
And then what you, you know, so good after that, when, when it arrives, you decide what

57:20.640 --> 57:22.360
you want to do with it after that.

57:22.360 --> 57:30.120
Um, but the big thing is that they weren't even revealing the characters or items until

57:30.120 --> 57:32.760
10 30 AM Eastern.

57:32.760 --> 57:37.800
Um, it was really just kind of a big, a big mess.

57:37.840 --> 57:48.320
Um, now, uh, I looked on, uh, the website and, uh, they are going to be going into a

57:48.320 --> 57:52.360
re-release and they have an email out for like the next, the next chance.

57:52.360 --> 57:53.920
I don't think they look that great.

57:53.920 --> 57:55.640
Actually the Tom Nook one doesn't look that great.

57:55.640 --> 57:59.040
The Isabelle looks kind of good, but they just still have that kind of weird build a

57:59.040 --> 58:00.560
bear body.

58:00.560 --> 58:04.520
So it's cool.

58:04.560 --> 58:04.880
Yeah.

58:04.880 --> 58:08.680
I totally forgot that these were going on sale until somebody was tweeting about it.

58:08.680 --> 58:10.560
And I was like, Oh yeah, that was today.

58:10.560 --> 58:16.040
And I wanted to get one of those, but I'm, I'm, I guess if dark soccer is like, they're

58:16.040 --> 58:16.680
all right.

58:16.680 --> 58:19.200
I guess I don't feel like I missed that much.

58:19.200 --> 58:21.880
You know, I feel a little like, what?

58:21.880 --> 58:24.640
I still have your ketchup.

58:24.640 --> 58:25.480
Oh wow.

58:25.480 --> 58:27.320
Yeah, that's right.

58:27.320 --> 58:28.600
I've had that for a while.

58:28.600 --> 58:31.360
I know you sent me a picture finally.

58:31.360 --> 58:33.680
Well, it sent you a picture right after she arrived.

58:33.680 --> 58:35.000
Well, and guess what?

58:35.000 --> 58:37.160
In two weeks I can have people over.

58:37.160 --> 58:41.400
Well, that's not true because Alan's still not vaccinated, but I can go to your house.

58:41.400 --> 58:47.120
Hey Rob, if you want, if you want a Tom Nook, you can spend three and an Isabelle, you can

58:47.120 --> 58:50.120
spend 300 bucks on eBay.

58:50.120 --> 58:55.960
No, I'm trying to think of a polite way to say I could also tell those scalpers to suck

58:55.960 --> 58:57.960
my balls, but I can't think of a nice way to say it.

58:57.960 --> 59:00.160
So I just won't say anything.

59:00.160 --> 59:01.840
I think that's about as polite as one can get.

59:01.840 --> 59:02.520
Yeah.

59:02.520 --> 59:04.040
So, all right.

59:04.040 --> 59:06.440
Anyway, let's move on.

59:06.440 --> 59:10.640
Speaking of things that, let's get to the next story, Loki.

59:10.640 --> 59:15.720
Well, I mean, it's, I'm not surprised because there's been a parts shortage and even just

59:15.720 --> 59:19.000
like a Silicon shortage for a while now.

59:19.000 --> 59:26.320
And so right now, apparently the reason why we can't find PlayStation fives or Xbox series

59:26.320 --> 59:33.560
X's or new GPU's, not because people are using them for mining is because the parts

59:33.560 --> 59:38.800
that go into these are becoming more expensive.

59:38.800 --> 59:44.800
And based on this, that's why there's less supply around.

59:44.800 --> 59:51.600
There's a lot more demand, the demand's not being met except for scalpers and people that

59:51.600 --> 59:56.240
are using those cards to mine.

59:56.240 --> 01:00:01.040
And so, yeah, right now, apparently they're just trying to work through that supply chain

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.040
issue.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:07.320
And that, so really what that tells us is that this supply issue with the Xbox series

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:12.440
X and PlayStation 5, it's not getting any better for a long time, at least not this

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.440
year.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.440
Wow.

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:16.120
That sucks.

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:20.160
I was thinking about getting a new graphics card, but I guess not, I guess I better just

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:24.120
learn to work with what I have.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:28.600
Your best bet is hoping that cryptocurrency crashes again, and in which case all those

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.440
mining cards will be available.

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:38.360
Well, hold on, because I just on a whim, on a loo, on a tihi, I bought like 50 bucks,

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:42.920
so it can't crash yet until I cash that out.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.960
But I'll do that soon if that'll help.

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:50.040
Your 50 bucks isn't very much when you're considering the going price like 50,000 or

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:54.680
whatever for Bitcoin or something like that.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:01:02.760
And I'm talking not necessarily dropping to nothing, but basically going back down.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:08.320
I will say, I bought like 50 bucks of one of those things, like maybe it was in January,

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:12.680
and I'm up to 75 now, and that's faster than my 401k works.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:17.640
So not that I would ever advocate, don't ever take financial advice from this bozo.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:22.600
I made more money on that than I do at the casino.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.000
So you know what?

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
It was fun.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:34.040
But yeah, unfortunately, when it comes to get money quick, just the absolute worst people

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:37.040
will come out and just make it horrible for everybody.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:43.360
And buy up the graphics supplies and burn down a forest to make one more Bitcoin or

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:44.360
whatever.

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:53.160
Well, right, and GPU manufacturers have tried to dissuade people from buying them by basically

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:58.480
locking out in drivers the ability to mine at full speed.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:05.480
But you know, when they called it unhackable, that's their first mistake.

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:06.840
And so what happened?

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:08.640
It immediately got hacked.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.140
Very true.

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:16.980
Listen, free advice for any technology company out there, never say your product is unhackable.

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:17.980
It just is.

01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:20.260
It's basically like putting your right way down.

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:21.260
Yeah, exactly.

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:24.020
You're throwing down the gauntlet.

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:27.020
This is unhackable.

01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:30.540
Just shut up about it and just release it as is.

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:33.440
And just whatever, but it didn't really help.

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:36.100
So I don't know.

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.300
All right.

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:41.880
Let's move on and talk about, we were kind of talking at the top of the show about Sony

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:46.380
maybe trying to get partnering up and expanding franchises in different directions.

01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:49.620
And there was actually a great comment in chat, I can't remember if I read it or not,

01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:53.260
and I'm sorry, I forgot who said this, but somebody had said, why didn't they start creating

01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:56.300
a new Last of Us game instead of going back and remastering?

01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:59.860
Well, number one, you bet your ass they're working on the Last of Us 3.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:02.420
It's just that's going to take a long time to make.

01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:05.900
So a Last of Us remaster is something they could get done faster.

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:10.380
But I think the way I interpreted the comment was really like, well, why not a different

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:13.700
Last of Us game set in that universe type of thing?

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:15.460
Which is a fair question to ask.

01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:20.440
Why not try to use the engine to make something else or do something with it?

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:25.580
And I think this next story is a little bit about, well, maybe this is Sony's plan in

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:29.300
a way, and it has to do with mobile gaming.

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:31.540
There hasn't been a lot of Sony in mobile gaming.

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:35.340
There was Uncharted Fortune Hunter, but I don't think that is on.

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:36.820
Did anybody know that there was an Uncharted game?

01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:38.420
I don't think many of you knew about that.

01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:39.420
No.

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:40.420
Did anyone care?

01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:42.780
I'm sure there's one person out there in chat going, I love that game.

01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:43.780
That's fine.

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:44.780
That's great.

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:46.980
But most people don't know about the Uncharted Fortune Hunter game.

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:55.780
So Sony is going to be kind of making a push to get more of an online and mobile presence,

01:03:55.780 --> 01:04:00.480
kind of like Nintendo tried to do a few years ago, to mixed success.

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.880
Their Niantic stuff, very, very good.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:06.200
Their Super Mario Run stuff, very, very not good.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.300
Their Animal Crossing, somewhere in the middle.

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:12.720
So you know, Nintendo's had some very mixed luck with that.

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:14.600
People really like Pocket Camp, though.

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:15.600
I know.

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.600
I know.

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:17.600
That's why I'm not saying-

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:18.600
People who like it, really like it.

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:24.520
That's why I'm not saying Pocket Camp isn't a bad column, because here's, talk about needing

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.580
AAA Blockbuster.

01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:29.020
Those games weren't big enough for Nintendo.

01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:33.580
As much as y'all love Animal Crossing, and I'm sure Super Mario Run has its fans, and

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:39.340
the Dregalia Lost is apparently a very strong title as well, but Nintendo kind of has already

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:44.620
walked away from mobile because none of those games were big enough, except Niantic.

01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:46.980
So they walked away from all that, and instead they said, you know what, Niantic?

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:48.340
How about Pikmin?

01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:50.620
And that's apparently just going to be the start of it.

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.180
If you read that press release-

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:54.120
Stop making Pikmin games.

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:58.380
Make another Metroid game, or make another F-Zero game.

01:04:58.380 --> 01:04:59.380
How about that?

01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:02.900
And actually, to go ahead and point out, they have not completely walked away from Pocket

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:03.900
Camp.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.100
They're still releasing material for it.

01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:08.420
Well, and they haven't walked away from Dregalia Lost or any of that stuff either, but it's

01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:13.380
easier for them to maintain the games they have than to cook up another one from scratch.

01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:14.380
It's more that.

01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:15.380
Mm-hmm.

01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:16.380
So.

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:17.380
All right.

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.380
Anyhow, where else was I?

01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:19.380
Oh, yes.

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:24.980
So Sony did have that whole Xperia Play, the PlayStation phone.

01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:26.860
Yeah, that's all I need to say about that.

01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:30.240
That was a thing that existed at one point.

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:36.300
But it has been noticed that Sony is now hiring an executive at PlayStation Studios to focus

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:40.920
on bringing PlayStation's most popular franchises to mobile.

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:45.660
So this is very early on, but it does appear Sony may be trying to craft that in-house,

01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:51.180
how to get more of their content and their licenses on mobile, because it does create

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:54.740
that whole brand awareness and all that stuff.

01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:58.460
I'm sure there's a little big planet game to be made on mobile somewhere.

01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:01.220
I don't know why that one comes to mind, but it does.

01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:05.020
I think of that well before I think of like this article I'm looking at mentions Horizon

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:06.020
Zero Dawn.

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:10.420
And I'm like, I don't want that on mobile, but maybe like an Ayla side story type of

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:11.420
thing.

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:13.420
Or, you know, is that her name?

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:15.420
Yeah, I don't remember.

01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:16.420
I forget.

01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:21.840
A side story would be kind of cool, but I just don't try to create that same experience

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:22.840
on mobile.

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:25.040
That's going to be great.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.040
But we'll see.

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.220
We'll see what comes out.

01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:31.200
And I would be interested to see if maybe this ends up because, you know, it's within

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:35.800
PlayStation, maybe they create a mobile game that kind of interacts concurrently with a

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.400
game that's on the console.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:38.400
It'd be kind of interesting.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:41.360
Something you can play on console or on the go.

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.880
I don't know.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.060
Could be interesting.

01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:47.040
So obviously it's just a job listing, so we don't know much.

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:50.040
We just know the strategy.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:57.000
As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat suggests, Pocket Kratos, boy trainer.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.200
Sacred Jade in chat says, Sackboy Crossing.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:01.200
You never know.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:02.200
You never know.

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.200
All right.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.200
Sackboy Pocket Camp.

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:08.860
Hey, it wouldn't be the first time Sony heavily borrowed from a Nintendo idea.

01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:13.680
Remember PlayStation, Battle Royale, All Stars, or whatever the hell that thing was called?

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:17.160
Which many are still saying should get a sequel, and I don't disagree.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.160
I think you should.

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:19.160
Ooh.

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:20.320
Ooh.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:21.320
Ooh.

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:26.320
You know what series, what franchise would be great for mobile?

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.880
Parappa the Rappa.

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.680
No, you think?

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:32.480
I think so.

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:33.480
That's my guess.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.480
That's my guess.

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.480
I'm sticking to it.

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:36.480
All right.

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:38.600
The things, though, that I think make pretty good mobile games are ones that you don't

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:42.880
have to have any volume for if you're playing it like in a crowded area.

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.880
Fair.

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.320
It's fair.

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:46.860
All right.

01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:47.860
Let's move on.

01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:48.900
Darth sakura.

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:49.900
Speak.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:51.220
I brought up sci fi earlier.

01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:52.220
This isn't what I meant.

01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:57.540
Well, actually, the sounds that you were making that made me think of a monkey.

01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:58.540
Yes.

01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:00.180
And this this article has to do with monkey.

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.180
How about that?

01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:03.820
And not even the butt monkey from Toshinden?

01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:13.780
Anyway, supervillain Elon Musk has been doing experiments with chips and animals brains.

01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:15.780
He put a chip in a pig.

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:25.580
It's like Mura Muralink thing, but at any rate, he put one in a monkey's brain and had

01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:27.460
him play mind pong.

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:30.580
He was trained to use a joystick, but it was unplugged.

01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:35.700
And now he's using the paddle by thinking about moving his hands.

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:45.860
Now the statement that he said about it was that it would be it would help enable someone

01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:50.420
like say with paralysis to use their smartphone with their mind faster than someone was using

01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:54.220
their thumb.

01:08:54.220 --> 01:09:00.420
What it does is it takes recording it records and decodes digital signals from the brain

01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:07.860
using more than two thousand electrodes implanted in regions of the motor cortex where it coordinates

01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:10.780
hand and arm music movements.

01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:21.180
And then it can calibrate based on what the monkey how the monkey plays right.

01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:24.780
It's interesting.

01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:27.580
There's people in chat room already saying that this is how we get Skynet.

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:28.580
Yes, exactly.

01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:36.540
The comment I was looking at from D'Artitsuya Skynet was not cybernet cybernetic, really.

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:40.820
It was more I still think machine.

01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:42.700
I think the point applies.

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:49.580
Yes, I don't think I don't think this is what I think this is, is that I think this is yes,

01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:50.580
I've said it.

01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:51.580
This is the matrix.

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:53.300
I don't think this is the matrix.

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:54.820
We're not augmenting reality.

01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:56.100
This is something worse.

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:58.760
This is Planet of the Apes meets Terminator.

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:01.860
This is the matrix revolutions.

01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:06.060
This is Total Recall, the newer one.

01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:10.900
Oh, no, the dude had like the phone in his hand and shit.

01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:17.420
But like, wait, but are you saying are you saying D'Artitsuya that if I want the killer

01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:21.700
to turn around faster on Xbox and Dead by Daylight, all I need is a brain chip?

01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:22.700
Yes.

01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:23.700
Yes.

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:24.700
Hmm.

01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:25.700
Or a monkey.

01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:28.060
Or a forbidden donut.

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:33.180
But now I have to I do have to take a step back because this actually makes me think

01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:41.900
of something I was watching about cybernetics for amputees.

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:47.420
It was a lady who had like just freshly lost her arm or something and she was in this study

01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:55.260
and they remapped her her nerves to certain points to where her stump was.

01:10:55.820 --> 01:11:00.500
And then outfit the hand and she had like a little control chip.

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:09.900
And so this allowed her to work her hand as if it were a real hand, she could grip things,

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:14.740
she could move fingers, she could pinch, she could do all kinds of stuff.

01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:20.900
And it makes me think, what if and I'm not looking at the more control your electronics

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:22.900
with your brain, you know, kind of thing.

01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:31.220
I'm thinking of practical applications for situations like for an amputee or for maybe

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:37.660
even what about the good things that video games can do for medicine or brain chips?

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:38.660
It's medicine.

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:44.620
I'm also thinking in terms of like exoskeletons, because I've seen that they have them created

01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:51.940
now for for quadriplegics and paraplegics.

01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:57.980
But I'm looking now, though, this could really have, instead of just this little pipe dream

01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:03.100
about controlling electronics with your brain, I think it could have practical medical applications.

01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:06.980
Yeah, that is that is the interesting thing here.

01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:11.420
And that's that's the very tricky, I guess, philosophical question that's going to have

01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:15.220
to be answered about brain chips is that, you know, on one hand, we look at a monkey

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:18.260
playing video games and we're like, that's stupid.

01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:21.460
And then, you know, putting them in humans for video games.

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.140
That's also very stupid.

01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:27.180
But then the way the dark soccer kind of laid out there, oh, somebody who, you know, what

01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:33.380
had an amputation could actually get some type of feeling and usage back like it's like

01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:35.260
they have nerves and all that stuff.

01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:38.860
Oh, maybe this does have something that could be legitimate.

01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:41.940
But then then then that opens this whole can of worms of the ethical side.

01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:46.140
But that's and that's nothing that's nothing we're going to have to answer here.

01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:53.540
But you don't get to person being able to use their hand again until you get through

01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:55.500
monkey playing pong, I guess.

01:12:55.500 --> 01:13:00.780
Well, and the other thing, though, is that this also does bring in then the ethical question,

01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:05.100
because I'm sure, you know, PETA, fuck them.

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:10.260
And other animal advocacy groups now are in on, well, what about these animals that they're

01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:11.580
being experimented on?

01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:14.940
Are they being treated ethically as well?

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:16.620
And.

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:22.300
I don't know, for something like this, you have to have something very similar if it's

01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:25.780
going to be used on humans, you have to have something similar to, you know, a kind of

01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:26.580
primate brain.

01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:33.980
And it does this is the part of it that does strike me as, you know, supervillain time,

01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:35.500
but.

01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:44.220
I don't know, I'm I think if there's no actual harm being done to the creatures, like if

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:49.420
it's not going to, you know, fry their brain or short it out or anything, then I'm kind

01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:50.060
of OK with it.

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:56.420
I mean, I don't think putting a chip in a pig's head just to put the chip in the pig's

01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:58.540
head is that good of a thing.

01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:04.580
But in a case like this, it's showing the possibilities that can be done by uniting

01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:11.860
technology and organics, as the old saying goes for me, not my circus, not my monkeys,

01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:13.300
literally not my monkeys.

01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:14.780
I don't know.

01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:16.500
I think we're a step away from the Borg.

01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:19.260
It does seem that way some days, doesn't it?

01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:22.140
Hey, we just celebrated first contact day after all.

01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:25.900
And it was another first contact day that was not ruined by the Borg.

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:26.980
So let's celebrate that.

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:28.260
All right.

01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:28.780
That's true.

01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:33.020
Let's move on to our next story, which I think is Loki's.

01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:37.180
Yeah, so this is kind of cool.

01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:42.820
You know, we we hear about all these different prototype games and stuff that were canceled

01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:44.220
and now we see what it looks like.

01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:50.820
Well, one of them appeared on YouTube and it is a game that appears to be Castlevania

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:57.300
Resurrection, which was a game that was a do out or at least it was shown like in the

01:14:57.300 --> 01:15:02.380
September 1999 issue of the Dreamcast magazine.

01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:07.300
And I guess they had canceled or Konami had canceled it back in March of 2000.

01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:10.300
And they even had an E3 trailer, though, for it.

01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:13.300
But it's definitely an early build of the game.

01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:18.260
It looks like from November, November 5th, 1999.

01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:26.300
But they did, you know, show gameplay and stuff, obviously, very early and a little

01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:27.020
rough around the edges.

01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:28.220
So maybe that's why they canceled it.

01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:32.820
But still need to see this, even though it never did come out.

01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:39.100
Bummer, because I bet Dark Soccer would have been all over that game.

01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:48.180
Hmm. I don't know, she might have been over it, you know, all over it, like she would

01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:49.700
have been with Castlevania 64.

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:56.580
So but but but ask her, Dark Soccer, isn't the Symphony of the Night on the Dreamcast

01:15:56.580 --> 01:15:57.340
the best version?

01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:07.460
There. You know what, I'm not even going to comment on that one, just because.

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:15.940
I mean, I would play any Castlevania game at least once, so I would play this, you know.

01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:21.260
But. I probably would hate it after a moment.

01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:24.940
Yeah, I'd try it and I'd hate every minute of it.

01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:29.580
It was the only thing that I would like about it is that it would have Sonya Belmont in it.

01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:33.700
Yeah, I was going to say it has Sonya Belmont in the game, which is kind of cool.

01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:35.700
Yeah, and one more video.

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:37.940
I watched the video a little bit.

01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:39.580
It's interesting.

01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:42.780
I don't really know what the gameplay would look like, but it's kind of hard.

01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:50.220
I never really got into the 3D, you know, the three dimensional Castlevania games, more

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:52.860
of a traditional 2D Castlevania fan.

01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:58.940
But. I don't know, it's hard to say what it would have been since it got canceled, but it

01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:01.740
looked it looked different.

01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:07.340
It's the first person, I mean, not first one, but a third person 3D platformer is what it is.

01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:10.500
Yeah, and it looks neat.

01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:13.900
I'm actually watching just a little bit of it.

01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:15.660
I kind of like some of the music that's going on.

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:17.620
It had potential.

01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:20.620
I mean, an idea like that would definitely have potential.

01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:24.820
But it's all in the execution in the end.

01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:26.580
It doesn't matter how pretty it is.

01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:28.940
It matters if you're having fun.

01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:31.900
And in the end, it got canceled anyway.

01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:36.020
Yeah, and that's kind of speaking of execution, it did.

01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:37.660
That's kind of why it did get canceled.

01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:39.940
So they basically said that it was June from the start.

01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:45.060
The team itself had a lot of troubles when Jason Lee Elliott came on.

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:47.380
And this is from his, I guess, personal website.

01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:51.860
Most of the team had only ever worked on sports games, so they had no idea how to make a 3D

01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:52.900
action platformer.

01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:56.740
And the art team wasn't very cohesive and couldn't agree on a direction.

01:17:57.260 --> 01:18:00.900
So the game had been in development for almost two years and had little to show for it.

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:06.860
Yeah, I think if you're going to, like, if it were me having,

01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:14.980
you know, a 3D, you know, third person exploration, you know, platform game,

01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:18.540
I would have taken notes from Sonic Team.

01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:23.060
Or, you know, from the group that did Sonic Adventure.

01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:26.620
Yeah, yeah, look at the successful ones.

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:28.260
And hire people that worked in those groups.

01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:36.180
All right, I think I'm going to go ahead and jump to the next story unless you had a final

01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:38.020
thought. No, I don't.

01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:39.860
OK, all right.

01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:46.620
So it's funny, I was kind of making the jokes about why can't we be able to flip around

01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:48.020
the killer in Dead by Daylight?

01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:53.620
It actually ties into this next story a little bit because a first party Microsoft title,

01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:59.260
Halo The Master Chief Collection, now supports keyboard and mouse on Xbox.

01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:01.060
So that's kind of cool.

01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:05.540
Now, I mean, it's not it's not like, you know, heck, even I think the PlayStation 3, you

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:06.860
could hook up a keyboard to it.

01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:13.540
And I know the Xbox 360, you could use a keyboard and a mouse in Final Fantasy 11 was on

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:14.620
the Xbox 360.

01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:17.060
On the PlayStation 2, I think you could do that, too.

01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:17.860
You're right. You're right.

01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:23.660
So but that's the point is that the game has to have it built in to support it.

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:28.180
You can't just plug your keyboard and mouse in and assume, oh, I can play Overwatch with

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:29.780
keyboard and mouse like I do on PC.

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:33.660
No, not unless the developers actually build in that functionality.

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:38.780
So that's the news here is that Microsoft has built in that functionality to one of their

01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:41.540
biggest titles, Halo The Master Chief Collection.

01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:46.300
So they have a season six that just came out for Xbox and PC.

01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:50.780
And the new patch now enables mouse and keyboard support.

01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:56.660
Any action can now be bound to multiple inputs while using mouse and keyboard, and that

01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:57.580
is in the patch notes.

01:19:57.780 --> 01:20:02.540
And this means that console and PC will be on the same version of the game as well.

01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:07.220
Also, there's a new Halo 3 map called Waterfall that you can use in custom games.

01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:11.380
Well, that's fun. So this all, of course, on the heels of

01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:17.420
Halo, the new Halo Infinite, whatever the new one's called, that we still don't know

01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:18.540
really when that's coming out.

01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:22.220
But it will be interesting to see if that might support keyboard and mouse as well.

01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:26.060
And now this just makes me kind of want like, oh, this would be kind of neat if maybe

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:31.580
the Dead by Daylight developers would let me use keyboard on my Xbox version of the

01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:32.820
game, because why not?

01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:36.300
They are. It's not like they don't already have the programing built in there because it

01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:37.780
runs on Windows Store that way.

01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:41.460
So have they already done the accessibility update for that one?

01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:44.900
The colorblind one?

01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:47.300
I don't remember.

01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:49.300
I don't I know it's in planning.

01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:50.980
I don't remember if it's actually out or not.

01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:54.580
OK, you know what I would like for more things.

01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:57.700
Yeah, I was oh, God, I shouldn't bring up.

01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:03.060
OK, really quick on Dead by Daylight, I would like to see them be able to replace the

01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:06.340
heartbeat noise when you play as a survivor, because that messes with me so bad.

01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:10.100
Yeah, I would really like to see it be a visual cue instead.

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:14.100
I the heartbeat thing is one of the probably the number one thing I hate about playing

01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:19.140
survivor. Just a quick aside for and I honestly, I think it's an accessibility thing.

01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:24.420
I know it seems strange, but I just think that, like, the heartbeat creates this

01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:28.260
artificial tension for me to is I can't do what it's supposed to do.

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:29.540
I don't like that.

01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:32.020
If it was a visual cue, I think I'd be into it.

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:34.100
I don't know. I know it's weird.

01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:41.380
All right, let's let's move on to a day and age when maybe games didn't terrify us

01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:42.580
quite as much. Well, I don't know.

01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:45.460
Actually, there were some there were some real terrifying games back in the day.

01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:47.540
But actually, if I can rewind.

01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:48.980
Yeah, sure. You need a VMU.

01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:51.540
Why is that?

01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:53.540
To throb your heartbeat.

01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:55.460
Ah, I like that. I like that.

01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:57.300
Like like in Resident Evil.

01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:59.860
Yeah. Oh, and SSG100 Matt sums that perfectly.

01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:02.260
Anxiety inducing in a bad way is what it's doing.

01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:07.300
Yes. Anyway, but let's let's move on to a day when we didn't have VMUs or actually,

01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:14.020
I think, sadly, per the rules of the classic game of the week, I think we did have VMU

01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:18.100
well by the time this game came out, because a video game only has to be 10 years old to

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:19.860
qualify as the classic game of the week.

01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:23.940
So we're going to take a trip down memory lane and look at a game that's about at least

01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:24.580
10 years old.

01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:29.380
When Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you

01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:31.380
brats should be checking this game out.

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:36.500
And she picked a good one this week that made me go, I think this game is probably more

01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:38.260
like 15 years old at this point.

01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:40.980
And it just makes us all feel 11 years old.

01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:44.660
Oh, I guess that's good, although that still seems old.

01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:47.540
But anyway, what is the classic game of the week, Dark Soccer?

01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:49.540
Plants versus zombies.

01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:54.260
I love plants versus zombies.

01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:59.060
It is such a fun game, and I've beaten it all the way through.

01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:02.260
But at any rate, it came out in 2009.

01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:07.700
It was a tower defense game developed and published by PopCap Games that first had a

01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:10.180
release for Windows and Mac OS.

01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:15.700
And this has been ported to other devices, consoles, mobile devices, handhelds, you name

01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:16.200
it.

01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:24.180
So in the game, you play as a homeowner in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, and you

01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:28.340
have to basically fight the zombie hordes with your mutated plants.

01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:36.900
So my favorite is the corn that shoots pats of butter like a catapult.

01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:44.420
But at any rate, it was designed by someone named George Fenn.

01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:51.940
And he was looking at it as more like a defense sequel to a fish simulator game that he made

01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:53.780
called Unsan Aquarium.

01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:59.300
He said it also took some inspiration from Magic the Gathering, Warcraft 3, and Swiss

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:00.260
Family Robinson.

01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:08.260
The art was done by Rich Werner, and the music was done by Lara Shigehata.

01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:15.540
And it was really just completely loved when it came out.

01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:19.620
It was for the Golden Joystick Awards in 2010.

01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:22.980
It was listed as a strategy game of the year.

01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:25.700
And it also had earned a download game of the year.

01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:30.340
And it was the fastest selling video game developed by PopCap.

01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:35.940
By 2010, it had sold over a million copies worldwide.

01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:45.060
And then PopCap was bought by Electronic Arts, and they laid off the designer and 49

01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:48.500
employees to focus on mobile and social gaming.

01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:51.940
But there were sequels that came out after that.

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:57.780
So as far as playing the game, you have adventure mode where you go through the different levels

01:24:57.780 --> 01:24:59.540
and it gets progressively harder.

01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:09.140
And you get upgraded plants and different kinds of seeds that you can buy and different

01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:10.180
tools that you can buy.

01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:14.500
And then you have different plants that you can use morning and night.

01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:25.460
So at night, you have to use fungi that you won't be getting any sunlight during the day.

01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:28.900
But you use sunlight to buy new...

01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:35.780
Actually, to place the pieces on your board, basically what it is.

01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:40.740
To put the pea shooter is what they're called.

01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:42.740
Then you have the frozen pea shooter.

01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:43.940
They're pretty clever names.

01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:53.460
And then you have the roof level, which is like one of the last levels where you have

01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:58.340
to fight Dr. Zomboss, who's an evil scientist who animated the zombies.

01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:00.260
And he has like a big robot and everything.

01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:02.580
There's other game modes.

01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:04.420
There are mini games.

01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:07.140
There's a puzzle mode, survival.

01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:11.140
In many games, you switch from one of 20 mini games.

01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:14.340
And you get some stuff from it.

01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:18.820
I think you can feed this tree thing that you get at the end of the game, if I remember

01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:19.320
right.

01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:21.940
In puzzle mode, you have two types of levels.

01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:24.260
You have vase breaker and iZombie.

01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:28.180
So in vase breaker, you break open a bunch of vases, each getting part of a plant or

01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:29.060
a zombie.

01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:35.060
And it ends when you smashed all the vases and all the zombies are killed.

01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:42.420
In iZombie, you place zombies to get past these cardboard cutouts of the plants.

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:44.740
So that you can eat the brains on the other side of the lane.

01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:52.980
Survival mode basically lets you choose your plants and the zombies come wave after wave

01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:53.480
after wave.

01:26:58.340 --> 01:27:01.860
So George Fan, when he was developing the game, of course, it was directly influenced

01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:06.580
by the development of Instant Aquarium, his earlier game.

01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:15.300
So it has very similar pacing, the drip feedings that you get in this game.

01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:19.380
You get sunlight, but you'll get what powers you up in very small increments.

01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:26.420
And he said that the inspiration from Swiss Family Robinson came where you're a family

01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:27.620
defending against pirates.

01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:32.260
In this case, you're defending against the zombie hordes.

01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:45.860
And it was originally, though, an alien defense game that was under the name Weedlings, but

01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:47.940
they didn't like the name.

01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:51.460
And they were going to also consider Lawn of the Dead.

01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:54.180
I like that name.

01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:58.340
Yeah, but Romero didn't permit the use.

01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:04.100
And so he just wasn't down with it.

01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:11.780
And it was basically had a small team to help him with development of the game.

01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:13.460
He did the designs all himself.

01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:20.020
They were thinking of doing it in a flash with sort of a paper look, kind of the South

01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:20.820
Park kind of look.

01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:26.660
And then they kept going and it was intended, of course, to attract the casual gamer.

01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:31.620
But it went into that strategy era and started pulling all kinds of people into it.

01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:37.140
So you have 51 different kinds of zombies and 49 different kinds of plants.

01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:42.100
One of my favorite zombies is the disco zombie.

01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:50.660
And you also have another dancing zombie that's supposed to look like Michael Jackson.

01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:52.500
Actually, yeah, that's right.

01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:54.820
The disco zombie was the dancing zombie.

01:28:54.820 --> 01:29:00.260
The little Michael Jackson in Thriller and then he objected.

01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:04.260
Well, his estate objected to the use, so they replaced him with a disco zombie.

01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:11.940
And the music was a mix of different pop and chip tune kind of sounds.

01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:18.180
And Shigehara, who did the music, said she drew influence from Danny Elfman's soundtracks,

01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:26.500
but tried to spread out the themes into something a little bit more across the board.

01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:30.260
So there were mobile phone versions.

01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:37.220
iPad, iPhone, and then eventually it came to Android as well.

01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:46.900
There, of course, were the console versions, which was bundled in July 2010 for Xbox 360

01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:48.260
with Peggle and Zuma.

01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:52.820
There was PlayStation Network port.

01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:54.740
There's DS version of it.

01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:58.340
There's DSiWare port as well.

01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:01.860
PlayStation Vita port was announced and released.

01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:05.700
And you could use the touch screen or controller with that one.

01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:09.460
And you could shake the Vita to collect your sons and money,

01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:12.100
but it doesn't have the multiplayer setting.

01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:18.580
Um, it was considered one of the top grossing games on iOS.

01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:23.300
It has received amazing reviews over the board.

01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:33.300
The iOS versions, iPad and iOS, received 92 and 93 out of 100 for Metacritic.

01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:40.580
It's been, I mean, it really was just so popular and people are still

01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:42.660
loving the game, I mean.

01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:45.620
And it's won so many awards.

01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:52.340
It won, from the Golden Joystick Awards, like I said earlier,

01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:54.900
it won Download Game of the Year and Strategy Game of the Year.

01:30:57.220 --> 01:31:04.260
And then after George Brown was laid off, he kind of took some inspiration

01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:06.660
and worked on Octogeddon.

01:31:06.660 --> 01:31:08.580
So it's another game from him.

01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:17.380
And then there were, of course, like a bunch of sequels and spinoffs.

01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:20.980
So we had Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare,

01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:24.580
which is a multiplayer third-person shooter.

01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:27.460
We have Plants vs. Zombies 2.

01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:30.260
We have Plants vs. Zombies Hero on iOS.

01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:34.740
Plants vs. Zombies Battle for the Neighborhood for PS4 and Xbox One.

01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:37.780
They're working on another one for the portables.

01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:44.740
It's just everywhere.

01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:46.420
Plants vs. Zombies isn't going anywhere.

01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:51.700
There was, by the way, Zen Studios and PopCap did make a DLC

01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:57.140
for their interactive Zen Pinball 2 and Pinball FX 2.

01:31:58.100 --> 01:32:01.140
So there's Pants vs. Zombies Table in there.

01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:04.180
And then Dark Horse Comics did a six-book adaptation

01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:09.780
of the miniseries for iOS, and it was called Llamageddon.

01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:12.580
And so there you go.

01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:16.100
It's got all kinds of different cultural references in it.

01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:19.860
Just it really is.

01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:24.020
And don't forget, there was the Plants vs. Zombies level

01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:25.860
in World of Warcraft.

01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:27.620
Oh, that's right.

01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:28.820
They did like a tie-in thing.

01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:29.780
Yeah, yeah.

01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:30.820
The Sunflower.

01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:31.320
Yes.

01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:36.100
You know, I was looking up online to kind of see, like,

01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:37.860
what has PopCap kind of been doing?

01:32:37.860 --> 01:32:41.540
And, you know, there was, like, Plants vs. Zombies 3.

01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:44.180
But I feel like this Plants vs. Zombies kind of really came

01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:46.100
from, like, a heyday era of PopCap games.

01:32:46.100 --> 01:32:48.020
There were so many cute things they were making between,

01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:50.660
like, you know, Bejeweled, Astro Pop, Chuzzle,

01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:53.380
Hegel kind of all came from this era.

01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:54.500
I still love Hegel.

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:56.740
Yeah, and then I don't know, like, you know,

01:32:56.740 --> 01:32:58.660
they're still putting out some sequels and things like that.

01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:01.060
But I don't know if this is related to the fact that they

01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:03.620
laid off a bunch of people in 2012, which is really too bad.

01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:07.780
But there's definitely a heyday of PopCap games

01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:08.660
that I really miss.

01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:10.120
Yeah.

01:33:10.660 --> 01:33:14.340
This game is definitely, I think, pretty much at the top

01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:17.380
of the list for, oh, something fell off my desk,

01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:21.780
but for fun, you know, and for being something that's

01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:23.380
a little bit less casual.

01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:25.380
Like, you're not playing Bejeweled or Hegel.

01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:29.060
You've got to put some strategy and time into this one.

01:33:29.060 --> 01:33:30.020
So it was great.

01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:31.700
And there's a lot of people in chat kind of commenting,

01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:32.580
oh, yeah, this was great.

01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:34.900
I wasted a lot of time with this when I first got an iPad,

01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:36.100
like those types of things.

01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:41.140
So I remember my old flip phone and playing Bejeweled on that.

01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:43.860
That was back in the day.

01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:46.580
I played a lot of these games on Xbox 360, honestly.

01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:53.380
Yeah, but I played through this on PC when I beat it.

01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:54.580
So all with a mouse.

01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:56.740
There it is, your classic game of the week,

01:33:56.740 --> 01:33:58.180
Plants versus Zombies.

01:33:58.900 --> 01:34:00.660
I'm sure many of you have tried that at some point,

01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:03.300
but if not, this is a chance for you to experience

01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:04.980
some of the heyday of the PopCap games,

01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:07.300
the really fun cartoony stuff.

01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:11.540
So, all right, let's take a minute to travel around

01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:12.500
and do some rapid fire news.

01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:14.740
I should talk about this, too, at some point.

01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:16.180
I really should have said this at the beginning of the night,

01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:17.300
but I'm a little off tonight.

01:34:18.660 --> 01:34:22.260
You guys raised enough points for Shane and I to do

01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:25.860
our stream about the Shane's definitive Pokemon ranking.

01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:28.580
We are looking tentatively at doing that this week.

01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:31.620
I will confirm that on Twitter and on our VOG Network Discord,

01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:33.460
vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:35.620
We're looking at doing that on tax day.

01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:37.540
That's all contingent on how I'm feeling

01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:39.300
and if Shane gets his PowerPoint done.

01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:42.340
There's going to be PowerPoint?

01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:42.840
Yes.

01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:48.900
There wasn't going to be until he said something in like,

01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:50.580
how am I going to show off these Pokemon?

01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:51.860
Am I going to do a PowerPoint?

01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:54.660
And I'm like, now that you said it, I need that to happen.

01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:58.100
That's awesome.

01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:02.180
So we're looking at the 15th, but we may bump it back a week.

01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:04.900
I don't want you guys to be pissed off if we bump it back a week.

01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:08.340
So it all depends on Shane's availability as well,

01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:10.260
because he does have spring break this next week.

01:35:10.260 --> 01:35:13.380
So he's a lot more available than he will be after that.

01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:15.060
So anyway, stay tuned to the Discord and all that stuff.

01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:16.340
We'll get you the final date.

01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:21.140
And of course, if you are subscribed here at VOG Network on Twitch,

01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:23.540
you can use your Amazon Prime subscription.

01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:26.980
You get a free one every month and you can use it right here at VOG Network.

01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:30.260
And you get access to our back catalog of all the videos.

01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:33.620
So you can watch all your favorite episodes of Orange on its Radio and Bobby Black Wolf,

01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:36.660
at least the ones that were done on Twitch over the past two plus years.

01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:38.020
There's quite an archive there now.

01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:39.940
You can go back and watch those on demand whenever you want,

01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:42.660
as well as the special streams we're trying to cook up.

01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:47.700
So if Dark Soccer and I do end up doing an extra stage show with Dead by Daylight,

01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:49.780
that'll be something you can watch in the video archives

01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:53.380
and also the definitive Pokemon ranking and all that good stuff.

01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:56.260
Yeah, if it's going to be something after Orange Lounge,

01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:58.820
though, I will probably only be able to do commentary.

01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:00.500
Oh, not tonight.

01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:03.940
And I'm not saying tonight, but I'm saying like after the show sometime.

01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:04.500
Oh, no.

01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:08.020
Doing the show kind of drains me sometimes.

01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:09.380
No, me too.

01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:10.660
And especially today.

01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:14.340
But we'll find a day that works for both of us.

01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:19.220
As long as it's the only other day that's occupied at VOG Network right now is Tuesdays

01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:20.100
with Anime Jam Session.

01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:21.700
So as long as it's not that day.

01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:24.900
And even then, we could still do it before or after.

01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:26.020
So we'll work it out.

01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:28.820
Do you know what next Sunday is?

01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:31.700
Is that your birthday?

01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:32.420
No, next Sunday.

01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:33.700
The day before my birthday.

01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:34.340
The day before.

01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:36.500
I'm like, no, your birthday is not the 18th.

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:38.900
OK, yeah, it is getting close, though.

01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:42.100
All right, let's move on.

01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:43.300
Let's do some rapid fire news.

01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:43.800
Loki.

01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:48.980
Yeah, so this death loop that we keep hearing about

01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:51.700
that's coming to PlayStation 5.

01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:53.940
Well, it's been delayed.

01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:56.180
It's going to be coming now September 14th.

01:36:56.180 --> 01:36:58.980
It originally was set to release May 21st.

01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:03.780
But, you know, as with most of these games that are getting delayed, they just needed

01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:09.060
some additional time COVID-19 and, you know, just more polished.

01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:14.660
So we'll look forward to that in September and more trailers for the game again.

01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:20.820
And then, of course, we're also getting some Streets of Rage 4 DLC.

01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:26.500
So the Mr. X Nightmare is going to have a new mode, some new music, and also you'll be

01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:29.140
able to play as Estelle Aguer.

01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:32.260
So that's pretty cool.

01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:37.220
I still haven't played Streets of Rage 4 yet, but it looks really nice.

01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:39.700
I really like the art style that they have with that.

01:37:39.780 --> 01:37:46.020
And here it's pretty much, you know, same type of gameplay as the originals.

01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:48.100
So check it out.

01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:50.680
All right.

01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:53.700
If that's it, then we'll go to Dark Sakura.

01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:56.420
Sorry, I know you're focused on that hype train in chat right now.

01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:58.260
I actually was chewing.

01:37:58.260 --> 01:37:59.220
No. Oh, that's right.

01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:00.340
Thank you.

01:38:00.340 --> 01:38:01.460
I thank you.

01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:05.860
I know since we're recording the podcast, I don't often acknowledge all the every follow

01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:07.140
and every bitty donation, all that.

01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:09.860
But you guys really don't have to be so generous.

01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:11.780
We just did another.

01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:13.220
No, that's the tickers catching up.

01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:14.580
We did another anonymous cheer come in.

01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:17.620
Somebody just anonymously donated a thousand bitties.

01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:18.180
Thank you so much.

01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:19.060
You guys don't really.

01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:20.820
And there's many other cheers going on, too.

01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:22.340
I will acknowledge them all at the end of the show.

01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:23.460
We don't hate it.

01:38:23.460 --> 01:38:24.740
Yeah, thank you guys so much.

01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:27.700
Of course, we don't hate it, but you don't have to.

01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:29.540
And we just so deeply appreciate that.

01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:29.780
Thank you.

01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:30.340
Thank you.

01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:31.780
Anyway, Dark Sakura, rapid fire news.

01:38:32.420 --> 01:38:38.420
So someone unlocked, you know, when Disney's rave came out and I'm talking about the Japanese

01:38:38.420 --> 01:38:45.380
PlayStation one DDR Disney's rave, it didn't have a maniac mode in it.

01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:49.140
And we knew it was supposed to have one on the American version of it.

01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:50.020
It did have that.

01:38:52.420 --> 01:38:55.860
But what's interesting, though, is that they didn't have it.

01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:59.380
Maybe they wanted to keep it easy because it was intended, you know, for kids.

01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:01.060
I mean, the arcade version have it.

01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:07.300
And of course, they had done like all of this music through avex tracks and everything.

01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:08.260
So it was really great.

01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:14.580
But someone without the use of cheats or anything.

01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:23.380
Unlocked maniac steps, step charts in this game.

01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:24.180
So they were in the game.

01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:28.340
I mean, people were unlocking them with like pro action replays and stuff like that.

01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:30.100
But someone did it.

01:39:30.180 --> 01:39:37.060
And when you save your game, it will save those unlocked charts for you.

01:39:37.060 --> 01:39:44.340
So be looking for some Dex files out there, which, by the way, very recently I found all

01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:46.180
of my Dex drive saves.

01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:46.660
I thought it was.

01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:47.160
Oh, wow.

01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:56.660
The person who did this, by the way, has a video where they go through on how to unlock

01:39:56.660 --> 01:39:57.540
everything.

01:39:57.540 --> 01:40:08.820
And but there is a also a Twitter post that I will be posting in chat, but it's absolutely

01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:09.460
fascinating.

01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:14.740
It really is quite intricate and is based on time and visual cues and stuff like that.

01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:20.420
So I kind of I'm kind of thinking I might have to bust out my game.

01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:22.340
I still have all my stuff.

01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:24.980
I miss Disney's rave.

01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:28.260
It didn't have a ton of songs compared to what else was out at the time.

01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:32.340
But it had some really killer Disney remixes, like the electrical parade and that stuff.

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:34.020
Oh, gosh, yes.

01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:36.180
By the way, can I do a quick tangent?

01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:37.140
It's important.

01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:37.700
Okay.

01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:42.740
Since we're going to talk about this era of DDR and all this stuff, I was not alerted

01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:47.300
to the fact that Erotic, the band that was in DDR and all that stuff.

01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:50.180
I was not alerted that their back catalog went up on Spotify.

01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:54.820
And I'm assuming Apple Music and all the comparables in the past few months.

01:40:54.900 --> 01:41:00.660
Because Erotics, thank you for the music, their ABBA tribute album.

01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:02.820
So, like, ten ABBA songs on this album.

01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:04.260
Which is a great album.

01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:05.540
It's a fucking bop.

01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:09.940
Like, it has one of the most underrated ABBA songs they covered, Angel Eyes.

01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:10.740
I love that song.

01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:13.380
And they do a killer version of it.

01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:18.580
And yeah, so I just just as a side note, because I love the music in Disney's rave.

01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:21.940
And of course, I love the cheesy Eurodance shit.

01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:23.460
That's what made DDR so great.

01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:25.540
So, like, Erotic is a huge example of that.

01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:27.220
Yes, it's a band called Erotic.

01:41:27.220 --> 01:41:30.660
I think they were in Germany or something called E-rotic.

01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:34.660
And they did, like, Do It All Night, I think was probably one of the biggest songs they

01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:35.460
did for DDR.

01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:38.260
I think that's the one that everybody kind of knows.

01:41:38.980 --> 01:41:40.420
Oh, Nick, please not so quick.

01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:41.220
Well, that's my favorite.

01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:43.780
But I think Do It All Night is the one that people recognize.

01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:45.860
Because that song got played a lot in the arcade.

01:41:45.860 --> 01:41:46.360
So.

01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:48.520
Nice.

01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:50.600
All right.

01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:52.500
So, in other news.

01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:53.000
Yes, please.

01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:57.620
Um, we are getting an Alex Kidd.

01:41:57.620 --> 01:41:59.220
Oh, I want to mention something real fast.

01:41:59.940 --> 01:42:06.260
So you mentioned that the Disney's rave that they unlocked Maniac for the PlayStation version.

01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:08.020
They also did it for the arcade version.

01:42:09.300 --> 01:42:09.800
Oh, wow.

01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:11.620
So that was something else.

01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:15.780
They found a hidden maniac mode as well that was unlockable in the test menu.

01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:22.900
So you can actually do that and unlock that as well on the arcade version, which is pretty

01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:23.400
exciting.

01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:27.060
Too bad that Disney's rave machine at Roosevelt Golf lands in a dumpster somewhere.

01:42:27.780 --> 01:42:28.280
Yeah.

01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:35.460
I never did get the multi-disc to work with Disney's rave on my cabinet.

01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:37.380
I tried.

01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:37.880
All right.

01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:39.380
Let Jamie finish.

01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:41.620
But that is a good thing.

01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:48.020
Alice Kidd in Miracle World remake is coming out on June 24th for PC and consoles.

01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:54.980
Um, so Sega merge games and, uh, junk and team, um, have announced that they're going

01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:59.860
to be releasing it and it looks like it's going to be in that same sort of style as,

01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:01.780
uh, the wonder boy games.

01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:03.780
So cool.

01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:05.060
I love Alice Kidd.

01:43:05.060 --> 01:43:05.220
Yeah.

01:43:05.220 --> 01:43:06.180
I'm looking forward to this.

01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:08.900
I remember that trailer kind of surprised us some time ago.

01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:09.700
So I'm excited.

01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:11.540
It's finally coming out just in time for my birthday.

01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:13.540
So perfect.

01:43:14.180 --> 01:43:16.580
And OLR's birthday, which happened to be the same week.

01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:17.720
All right.

01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:20.420
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:24.100
Things that are coming out a little sooner than Alex Kidd's re-imagined.

01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:25.620
So Loki, we'll start with the U S.

01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:26.660
All right.

01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:32.900
So we have a poison control on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four, uh, Tasso Machi behind

01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:38.900
the Twilight on PC, uh, fighting the X layer, another dash on the Nintendo switch saga,

01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:43.220
frontier remastered on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation four iOS and Android.

01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:47.540
Uh, it looks like shadow man remastered on PC.

01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:51.620
Uh, Sichi and Tukey trouble on into the switch.

01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:56.260
And last but not least super meat boy forever on PlayStation four and X-Box one.

01:43:57.140 --> 01:43:57.620
That's it.

01:43:59.780 --> 01:44:02.180
I've not heard great things about the super meat boy sequel.

01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:04.980
Unfortunately, I'll be skipping that one.

01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:10.020
Um, moving on, uh, let's look at Japan coming out on the Nintendo switch winning post nine

01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:10.820
2021.

01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:12.420
I'm sure you're all excited about that.

01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:16.180
That is going to be coming out on the switch as well as gear club unlimited too.

01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:18.020
That is also out in Japan this week.

01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:22.500
Getting a price reduction this week, the liar princess and the blind prince gets a price

01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:23.700
reduction this week.

01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:25.540
Uh, this is, this is kind of neat.

01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:30.420
This is getting a release in Japan, a 2064 read only memories integral.

01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:34.100
Uh, that is the, uh, I forgot that this game kind of caught on in Japan.

01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:38.660
I think because people saw it as kind of like a snatcher, uh, kind of influenced game.

01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:38.980
Yeah.

01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:43.220
So, uh, it's, it's, that game came out forever ago too.

01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:44.500
Originally.

01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:48.740
It seems like that was, so that was like gamer X two or three when they were announcing that

01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:49.060
one.

01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:50.740
So that was a while ago.

01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:51.940
So, uh, that's cool though.

01:44:51.940 --> 01:44:53.860
Congrats to everybody behind that.

01:44:53.860 --> 01:44:56.980
Um, and, uh, let's see, did I hit everything for Japan?

01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:58.020
Yes, I did for the switch.

01:44:58.020 --> 01:44:58.340
I did.

01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:03.460
Let's take a look at the PS five and the PS four, nothing on PS five this week.

01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:10.420
But as we look at the PlayStation four, if I stop losing my place, I imagine we'll see

01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:12.740
a lot of the similar stuff that we saw on the Nintendo switch.

01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:13.700
Yes.

01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:18.180
Including winning post nine 2021 and the liar princess and the blind prince.

01:45:18.180 --> 01:45:19.380
But we have some other stuff too.

01:45:19.380 --> 01:45:24.900
The king of fighters, 2002 unlimited match comes out on PlayStation four this week.

01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:30.420
And I'll alt deuce beyond Kronos in regular and limited edition.

01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:31.780
How about that?

01:45:32.820 --> 01:45:33.220
All right.

01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:35.540
That's it for your releases in Japan.

01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:36.740
How about the UK dark Sakura?

01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:40.980
One thing for PS five doom three VR.

01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:42.660
All right.

01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:45.700
So, so it is all right.

01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:50.740
A few more stories and then we will get your comments in our chat over at twitch.tv slash

01:45:50.740 --> 01:45:52.980
vog network in the listener round table.

01:45:52.980 --> 01:45:55.700
Um, but for now let's get a few more stories.

01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:56.200
Loki.

01:45:57.140 --> 01:46:01.860
So, uh, six days in Fallujah is definitely a controversial game.

01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:09.540
And, uh, basically the, uh, there's a care, which is, uh, the council for American Islamic

01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:12.340
relations has called it an Arab murder simulator.

01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:18.660
And they're calling for Microsoft and Sony and valve to ban it on their platforms, um,

01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:23.380
from hosting the game, basically saying that it will only normalize violence against Muslims

01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:24.900
in America and around the world.

01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:28.980
And the game industry must stop the human D human.

01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:30.340
And that I can't talk today.

01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:35.700
Um, dehumanizing Muslims, uh, video games like six days of Fallujah only served to glorify

01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:41.460
violence that took the lives of hundreds of Iraqi civilians, uh, justify the Iraqi war

01:46:41.460 --> 01:46:46.740
and the reinforce the anti-Muslim sentiment at a time when anti-Muslim bigotry continues

01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:48.020
to threaten human lives.

01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:52.020
Um, yeah, I mean, I don't know.

01:46:52.020 --> 01:46:54.020
I thought this game had been canceled at one time.

01:46:54.020 --> 01:46:54.660
I mean, it was.

01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:58.420
So now it's coming back, but it seems controversial.

01:46:58.420 --> 01:47:03.140
I don't know if they're gonna, we'll see what happens with it, but yeah, I see their

01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:03.620
point.

01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:04.580
My only, yeah, no.

01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:09.780
And I, I watched, um, uh, a Muslim individual who is watching the trailer who is, you know,

01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:13.460
kind of just narrating along with it, pointing out everything that was really upsetting about

01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:13.860
it.

01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:15.940
Um, and so I, you know, and I get it.

01:47:15.940 --> 01:47:23.300
My only concern here is, is that I worry that this type of campaign is causing the game

01:47:23.300 --> 01:47:26.740
to get more visibility and more promotion because I'm gonna be on it.

01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:29.220
I don't think, I don't think people really gave a damn about this game.

01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:29.860
I really don't.

01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:33.940
I don't think there's people that were going to be interested in buying this at all.

01:47:33.940 --> 01:47:39.700
I'm worried that with this campaign going on, it's only bringing this type of attention

01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:39.940
to it.

01:47:39.940 --> 01:47:44.420
Look here, we are talking about it and I'm sure plenty of other gaming blogs, plenty

01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:46.900
of other podcasts, plenty of other YouTube's also talking about it.

01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:51.940
And there are going to be people out there who say, Oh, you don't want me to play this?

01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:53.060
Well, then I'm buying it.

01:47:53.380 --> 01:47:59.940
And so I'm just, I'm, I'm a little concerned in some ways it's going to have the opposite

01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:06.180
effect, but I don't want to, I mean, obviously the concerns, you know, I legit and all that.

01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:11.860
So, um, it seems like taking away the platform may end up being the only solution.

01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:14.420
I just don't see that happening with steam.

01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:19.620
I really don't, um, put a dick in it and it'll get removed from steam, put a vajay in it

01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:21.380
and it'll get removed from steam.

01:48:21.380 --> 01:48:26.420
But, um, unfortunately, um, murder simulators are fine on steam.

01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:26.980
We know that.

01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:33.380
So you may have better luck with the console space, but I just, I just worry there's,

01:48:33.380 --> 01:48:36.740
there's going to be probably more people that are going to buy this game just because they're

01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:40.180
not supposed to then probably would have bought this in the first place.

01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:44.580
There are the morbid, the morbidly curious.

01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:45.060
Yeah.

01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:48.180
Uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, buy it before it gets deplatformed.

01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:50.100
There's absolutely going to be that audience.

01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:56.580
So, um, yeah, so I don't know, maybe we shouldn't be talking about it, but it is, uh, it is

01:48:56.580 --> 01:48:58.260
a show about what gamers are talking about.

01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:01.380
And this is a headline that is going all the way around the industry right now.

01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:02.340
So anyway.

01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:03.220
All right.

01:49:03.220 --> 01:49:04.500
I shan't be buying it.

01:49:05.060 --> 01:49:11.060
Uh, it's just, it's just, it was not a game that was on my radar before and it's certainly

01:49:11.060 --> 01:49:11.700
not now.

01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:12.260
You know what I mean?

01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:17.380
There are those people who like those battle simulation games like that, you know, who

01:49:17.380 --> 01:49:19.060
are really into those war games.

01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:25.220
And I wouldn't doubt, I mean, I know people who would probably have been like, Oh yeah,

01:49:25.220 --> 01:49:26.580
that's going to be a great game.

01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:29.700
And, you know, but they also are very insensitive people.

01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:31.540
The people I can think of off the top of my head.

01:49:31.540 --> 01:49:34.340
One DJRMS in chat says I will be buying this game.

01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:40.580
And so, you know, I, but for me, I prefer my war simulators to be sci-fi.

01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:41.780
So Outriders is fine.

01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:43.300
Mass Effect's cool.

01:49:43.860 --> 01:49:48.100
But I don't, I don't like, I don't like the Call of Duty and that's the, the, I like it

01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:51.220
when it's fake, not when it's based on reality.

01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:51.460
What?

01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:56.420
I definitely understand how this could contribute to more Islamophobia.

01:49:56.980 --> 01:49:58.020
Yes, yes.

01:49:58.820 --> 01:49:59.540
All right.

01:49:59.540 --> 01:50:00.420
Well, let's move on.

01:50:00.420 --> 01:50:03.940
Let's talk about a game that, uh, boy, you want to really feel hopeless.

01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:05.940
Check out this game, Death Stranding.

01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:10.980
It's, uh, it's such an interestingly timed game this Death Stranding was.

01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:14.900
And Death Stranding, of course, came out on PC as well as on PlayStation.

01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:16.580
And that was a pretty huge deal.

01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:19.460
And some people were kind of wondering, well, how's it going to do on PC?

01:50:19.460 --> 01:50:21.860
And the answer is pretty damn well, it seems like.

01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:26.900
Death Stranding, 505 games, biggest hit, who is the publisher on PC?

01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:30.500
Their biggest hit during 2020.

01:50:32.260 --> 01:50:32.980
Very interesting.

01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:38.340
The game generated 27 million between July and the end of 2020.

01:50:39.060 --> 01:50:42.580
There was also Control, I think it was a game 505 games did.

01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:48.340
Comparably, that was about 19 million, but they also had some sales in 2019.

01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:50.740
So you can't really say it's apples to oranges there.

01:50:51.860 --> 01:50:57.300
But yeah, Death Stranding, their biggest title amongst some other games that they've published.

01:50:57.300 --> 01:51:00.660
And 27 million sounds like a pretty good chunk of change.

01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:03.460
Probably worth it for Sony to put.

01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:06.900
I mean, even though, you know, it's a publishing agreement with Kajima and all that.

01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:10.740
Probably explains a lot why the PlayStation games end up coming out on PC later,

01:51:10.740 --> 01:51:14.180
because it gets the game exposed to a much wider audience, that's for sure.

01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:20.180
Death Stranding, I really need to go back and finish that at some point.

01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:24.980
It was just such an interesting game, the ambience in that game, too.

01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:27.780
And you really got into the story, right, Dark Saga?

01:51:27.780 --> 01:51:28.660
Yeah, I did.

01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:29.540
Our lore queen.

01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:31.620
Well, yeah.

01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:36.260
But I mean, the thing is that it annoys me when there is a game

01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:38.900
that this much work has been done into it, done to it.

01:51:39.540 --> 01:51:42.340
And people don't look at the story.

01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:47.700
You know, I think that knowing the story behind something helps with the immersion.

01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:53.060
That when you are playing this game and you know these people in this game,

01:51:53.780 --> 01:51:58.580
it makes you care about what happens to them, which is like reading a book, right?

01:51:58.580 --> 01:52:00.500
But I'm not going to buy that game.

01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:01.460
It's a walking.

01:52:01.460 --> 01:52:02.900
All you do in that game is you walk.

01:52:02.900 --> 01:52:03.700
It's a walking.

01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:05.300
I could go walk in real life.

01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:07.780
You know what I tell those people?

01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:08.580
What?

01:52:08.580 --> 01:52:09.540
Green eggs and ham.

01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:14.420
Means you don't know the whole point of that story was you don't know you're

01:52:14.420 --> 01:52:15.780
going to like something until you try it.

01:52:18.100 --> 01:52:19.620
Well, yes, I am Sam, I am.

01:52:21.220 --> 01:52:23.620
I would eat it in a box and I would eat it with a fox.

01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:26.100
I would play it here or there.

01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:27.220
I would play it anywhere.

01:52:30.260 --> 01:52:32.260
I like Death Stranding, Sam, I am.

01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:33.940
I like it.

01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:35.380
Now get the fuck out of my face.

01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:40.100
SSG100Matt says walk off the comment section you're complaining on then.

01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:43.000
All right.

01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:44.660
Oh, my God.

01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:48.740
Brain just had one of those random brain thoughts that I tend to have.

01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:50.980
OK, you're welcome to it because I've had plenty tonight.

01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:58.340
The main character of Green Eggs and Ham could have gotten a restraining order.

01:53:01.860 --> 01:53:03.060
Against Sam, I am.

01:53:03.060 --> 01:53:05.620
That wouldn't make for a very fun book, though.

01:53:05.620 --> 01:53:06.260
No, it wouldn't.

01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:08.020
But I was just thinking.

01:53:08.020 --> 01:53:12.100
Unless they can do it with rhyming, in which case then I'm on board.

01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:14.100
And some on Fox News would say that's what

01:53:14.100 --> 01:53:16.500
liberal America has already done to Dr. Seuss's books.

01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:22.580
Well, granted, knowing those books and having used to own them when I was a kid.

01:53:24.420 --> 01:53:25.940
You're preaching to the choir here.

01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:29.620
They didn't ban Green Eggs and Ham, but they sure make it sound like it sometimes.

01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:31.000
Yeah.

01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:35.240
The books they banned, you probably weren't aware of and with good reason.

01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:35.880
You know what I mean?

01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:40.120
Although it happened on Mulberry Street was one of the more well-known of them.

01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:42.520
All right.

01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:44.600
Like I had a couple of copies of that as a kid.

01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:46.120
All right.

01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:46.840
Let's move on.

01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:48.600
Video games.

01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:49.080
Star Saga.

01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:49.800
What's your next story?

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:56.520
So the U.S. government is getting involved in the video games, actually.

01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:57.800
This is actually a pretty cool thing.

01:53:58.120 --> 01:54:03.480
The U.S. State Department is actually having running a video game development exchange program.

01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:08.360
And this is in conjunction with the United Nations.

01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:15.720
So basically, the U.N. member states set goals back in 2015

01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:26.680
to handle international topics that affect the world in general, like ending poverty,

01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:29.720
improving health and education, reducing inequality,

01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:32.760
and combating climate change to conserve oceans and forests.

01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:39.400
So basically, we have this thing now called Games for Change.

01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:44.200
The U.S. State Department has now joined in through its sponsorship of the Stevens Initiative.

01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:49.880
And it is a virtual student exchange program for students in the U.S.,

01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:53.400
Israel, United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain.

01:54:54.360 --> 01:55:01.720
So what they're going to be doing with these games, and they basically picked games because

01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:06.040
they're sort of a common ground amongst the students that they're involving in it,

01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:09.480
about 2,700 students between 6 and 12 years old.

01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:16.280
But they've got different teachers that are trained through this Games for Change

01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:19.720
to give guidance to the students as they work on their project.

01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:26.600
And they also will have mentors in academia and former participants.

01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:31.160
But the whole point of it would be to create a game that highlights something,

01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:40.200
one of those major points the United Nations is focusing on to improve the world.

01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:42.920
I mean, basically, just big challenges to humanity across the board.

01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:48.600
A few of the titles that have come out of Games for Change in the past are

01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:57.400
GREE, which is very, very good and melancholy, Sky Children of the Light and Dreams.

01:55:57.400 --> 01:55:59.560
They all talk about contemporary social issues.

01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:07.400
And the Stevens Initiative is, you know, along the lines, this is why they're working with

01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:13.400
Games for Change, but they also want to bring young people together in U.S., the Middle East,

01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:18.920
in North Africa to, and this is the quote from here, increase their career readiness

01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:22.840
and encourage sharing knowledge amongst different cultures and countries.

01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:31.320
So it's also one of the notes to sponsors that the initiative, while it was founded in,

01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:34.280
while it's sponsored in grants from the U.S. State Department,

01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:38.440
it's also sponsored by the governments of Morocco and the United Arab Emirates.

01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:43.560
So I think this is pretty awesome.

01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:45.080
World peace through video games.

01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:47.080
Pardon?

01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:48.760
I said world peace through video games.

01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:53.000
Well, it could happen. You start, you start young.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:58.040
Well, you know, I mean, if you subscribe to the idea that video games are an art form,

01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:04.840
which I do, this is really about bringing art and stories from other cultures into, you know,

01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:10.600
um, into the world through the experience of a video game. That's a great thing.

01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:16.200
The other thing that I'm thinking of is that first of all, hate is taught.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:17.400
True.

01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:23.320
Children are taught to hate. If you have children working with an international group,

01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:27.480
with people whose points and views could be vastly different than their own,

01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:33.560
it's a great way to teach about those differences while everyone is learning.

01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:36.920
Because it's also promotes, you know, STEM skills.

01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:42.920
And I would actually be really curious to see if they've got any sort of focus

01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:46.600
on, um, on girls participating in this.

01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:47.640
Sure.

01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:53.160
I think it'd be absolutely delightful, but I think that they're on the right path for that.

01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:57.080
Not only do games, you know, not only are they fun, not only are there something that

01:57:57.080 --> 01:58:01.720
kids are interested in, but you learn the programming, the design aspect,

01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:04.360
you learn all kinds of stuff with it.

01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:09.080
And I think it's just a great platform to try to make a positive change in the world.

01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:11.580
All right.

01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:16.760
Well, let's move on from the, to our next story. We just have a couple more stories left,

01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:20.360
and then we'll get to our listener round table via our chat room over Twitch.

01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:21.560
And our one email.

01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:24.200
Twitch.tv slash vog network and the one email that we got.

01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:29.400
Sweet Nika is in our chat tonight saying, as someone who works in education,

01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:33.320
this sounds like a really good platform to utilize and advertise for sure.

01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:33.820
Yeah.

01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:40.120
Actually Nika, you were actually one of the people I thought of, um, when I saw that article.

01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:41.260
Awesome.

01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:43.000
All right.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.040
Loki, what do you have for us?

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:52.440
So, um, being that last week was Easter Sunday, um, there was a post that went out from a

01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:58.760
fellow game dev, uh, Jan Willem Nijman, who said today's Easter game devs,

01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:02.120
please respond to the best Easter eggs you've ever hit in a game.

01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:04.280
And there was some responses with that.

01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:11.320
So we got one response from Patrick Wren, who was apparently in charge of some of the different

01:59:11.320 --> 01:59:13.720
campaigns in halo five.

01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:20.760
And he mentioned that there was a halo cart racing or a hidden, like a halo cart racing

01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:25.160
for four player co-op, um, in his mission evacuation.

01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:31.080
And then I guess at the end of it, um, the person that wins the race gets a heavy weapon.

01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:37.480
Um, and then of course, you know, it, it took, uh, you know, a lot of people just trying to figure

01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:42.280
it out over the course of the weekend and following the week to try to figure out how

01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:44.360
to actually unlock that in the game.

01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:51.320
So they finally figured it out by waiting by this one, uh, door for 117 seconds, the

01:59:51.320 --> 01:59:52.840
master chief's number.

01:59:52.840 --> 01:59:59.800
Um, of course, apparently opens the door and then it, it spawns you on these among goose

01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:01.480
and despawns the enemies in the game.

02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:04.520
So they get the actually race, but you have to have four players who do that too.

02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:06.200
So you don't have to wait by the door.

02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:07.000
So that's kind of cool.

02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:09.400
I think this one takes the cake though.

02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:13.800
Um, apparently, and I was completely unaware of this cause I'm a pretty big fan of times

02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:20.680
players, but, um, home front, the revolution, which was, um, brought to us by Dan buster

02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:21.240
studios.

02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:24.440
They had an Easter egg in the game.

02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:28.920
Um, that included, there was two levels from time splitters too.

02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:33.640
Well, apparently though, there was also a code that was hidden that actually unlocks

02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:41.240
the full game playable within home front, the revolution and this, uh, developer Matt

02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:47.560
Phillips, he actually hid the fully playable, um, or he was responsible for part of that.

02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:50.520
And, um, but he couldn't remember what the code was.

02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:58.120
And then, then of course, um, come to the internet, uh, there was apparently this individual

02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:00.520
Spencer, uh, pair route.

02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:06.680
Um, he figured out what the code was and posted it online to, for everyone to check out.

02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:13.080
So now you can actually play a, uh, time splitters too, that actually runs natively in 4k.

02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:17.400
Of course, you know, the graphics are from the PlayStation too, so it doesn't look all

02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:20.360
that great, but, but still it, it is still pretty cool.

02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:22.120
That exists out there.

02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:25.000
So, um, yeah.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.600
Um, wow.

02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:29.160
So people need to be that bold more often.

02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:31.720
Hey, game developers, tell us a secret.

02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:32.040
Okay.

02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:34.440
Well, I was curious though, like there's like,

02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:35.720
It's amazing that it worked.

02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:40.280
Uh, reading through that thread as well to see like what other responses, like folks

02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:43.080
that had some other smaller, like Easter eggs.

02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:49.640
So there was one, um, for, uh, roller coaster tycoon three, that one of the designers had

02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:52.680
made animal toys to look like Katamari's.

02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:54.760
They're a fan of the game.

02:01:55.320 --> 02:02:02.920
Um, this guy in this game, Lena's inception, it apparently pulls a server for custom dialogue

02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:07.400
sequences, meaning that they can mess with streamers live so they can change the dialogue

02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:09.640
in the game, which I thought was funny.

02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:09.960
Wow.

02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:13.880
Um, they had, uh, let's see here.

02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:21.720
There's, uh, someone that hid the Dino mini game from Chrome, um, in some other game.

02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:28.040
I don't know, lots of fun stuff, but yeah, I can't really tell what it was.

02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:30.920
Um, Oh, here's, here's a good one.

02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:37.800
So apparently in plants versus zombies, garden warfare, um, there was one of the artists,

02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:43.000
I guess, had made, uh, Outset Island, the silhouette for one of the vistas.

02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:46.760
So you see that from, uh, the legend of Zelda Wind Waker.

02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:48.840
That's cool.

02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:49.640
Yeah.

02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:52.680
Um, what an, what an appropriate one to bring up for this show.

02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:53.000
Yeah.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:53.560
Right.

02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:57.720
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf in chat is saying I hid Loki in a tingle costume in a game.

02:02:58.840 --> 02:02:59.480
That's right.

02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:02.680
He did that game might still be available.

02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:07.720
In fact, somewhere I hid a tingle in our logo, except I didn't hide him very well.

02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:08.680
He didn't hide him very well.

02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:09.560
He didn't hide him very well.

02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:11.640
All right.

02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:17.160
Um, let's move on one more story that's going around this week has to do with a new speedrun

02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:21.800
record, just as I'm sure you're all getting ready for the, uh, virtual summer game stunt

02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:25.080
quick that's still months off, but still much rejoicing.

02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:31.080
We, we love a speedrun news and the news this week is that the super Mario brothers speedrun

02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:36.680
that existed has been beaten the fastest anyone could get through the game used to be four

02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:38.440
minutes and 55 seconds.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
Uh, and that was back in 2018.

02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:48.520
But now there is a new, uh, record, uh, Twitch streamer who goes by Niftski.

02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:49.400
I hope I said that right.

02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:50.040
Sorry.

02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:55.240
Uh, has a new record that is four minutes and 54 seconds.

02:03:56.360 --> 02:04:01.480
And if you want to get specific four 54, nine, four, eight.

02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:08.200
So it is like, uh, five hundredths of a percent of a second faster.

02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:13.880
It's it's like, but by mere frames, basically, uh, that this is be beaten.

02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:21.560
Um, so apparently the, uh, there's a, a glitch in an eight one flag pole that allows you

02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:25.480
to save that all important 0.35 seconds.

02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:29.240
And that's what it is, is a new glitch that was exploited called the flag pole glitch.

02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:31.160
So pretty cool.

02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:31.960
Congrats.

02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:35.160
And who knows what they'll find next to do that.

02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:36.460
So.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:37.500
All right.

02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:41.240
Let's, uh, let's check out the mailbag every week.

02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:44.840
You guys email us, participate at orange lounge radio dot com.

02:04:44.840 --> 02:04:47.000
And we like to read your emails on the air.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:51.400
Usually we have thousands of emails to pick from, and we really can only pick two or three

02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:52.520
to read every week.

02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:54.920
Um, but this week, unfortunately, we just had one.

02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:58.120
Um, that's, that's the way it goes sometimes.

02:04:58.120 --> 02:05:00.120
Participate at orange lounge radio.com.

02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:02.680
If you want to send us an email for a future week, but dark soccer, please.

02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:04.680
Greetings.

02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:09.720
OLR last week, Rob mentioned that he was having trouble getting into monster hunter rise because

02:05:09.720 --> 02:05:14.280
the weapon he was using was moving at quite the glacial pace to this.

02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:16.600
I would like to make a couple of recommendations.

02:05:16.600 --> 02:05:18.520
Have you tried switching up your weapons?

02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:21.880
There are a few weapons that can move quite slow, but hit hard.

02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:26.280
These can be fun, but they aren't for everyone and can be hard to use at first.

02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:29.560
If you're wanting something fast, the dual blades might not be a bad start.

02:05:30.200 --> 02:05:34.360
You'll run circles around the monster you're after, all while slashing and building up

02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:35.640
your demon gauge.

02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:40.200
I also recommend the bow as you can keep your distance and maintain good mobility, all by

02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:41.800
chipping away at your prey.

02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:45.000
Personally, the bow and the gun lance are my weapons of choice.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:48.440
Each weapon is very different and has different controls.

02:05:48.440 --> 02:05:52.840
So it's not a bad idea to look over how you use them in your hunter's notes menu.

02:05:53.320 --> 02:05:57.880
You can also undertake training quests that will go over the basics of monster hunter

02:05:57.880 --> 02:05:59.400
with monster hunter with you.

02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:04.520
Honestly, I feel like rise is more friendly to beginners of the series.

02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:09.080
I've originally played monster hunter world and could not get into it simply because I

02:06:09.080 --> 02:06:13.160
felt very overwhelmed when that game threw everything at me at once.

02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:17.160
Knowing what I have learned from rise, I make a world another shot in the future.

02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:19.960
Have you tried playing together with Shane and hunting as a group?

02:06:19.960 --> 02:06:22.280
This is a fantastic and fun way to learn.

02:06:22.360 --> 02:06:23.960
Happy hunting, Garth Wolf.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:28.280
Well, it's not for a lack of trying from Shane, that's for sure.

02:06:28.280 --> 02:06:32.520
But no, because I haven't bought the game because I don't want to drop $60 on the game

02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:33.960
when I play the demo.

02:06:33.960 --> 02:06:35.720
And I'm like, I don't know if I'm really into this.

02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:36.680
I don't think I care for this.

02:06:36.680 --> 02:06:38.760
I think I'd rather just go play Pac-Man 99.

02:06:39.800 --> 02:06:44.040
I didn't delete the demo and I think it still has like 28 charges left on it.

02:06:44.040 --> 02:06:48.120
So I can probably go back in and try one of the dual blades things.

02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:51.320
But I just don't think I'm into it.

02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:57.640
And I think, you know what, and this is the kind of thing I've told Shane too, because

02:06:57.640 --> 02:06:59.560
he's really, really tried to pitch that game to me.

02:06:59.560 --> 02:07:01.960
And it's like, sometimes I'm just not going to be into it.

02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:05.560
And it's like, how many times have I tried to get you to be into like No Man's Sky?

02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:06.360
I love that game.

02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:07.160
It's so cool.

02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:09.720
You know, it's just, why don't you play that game?

02:07:10.280 --> 02:07:11.800
Because he's playing Monster Hunter.

02:07:11.800 --> 02:07:13.240
That's a game he does enjoy.

02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:17.800
So I think sometimes it's just, you know, people have different tastes and that's what

02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:18.300
it is.

02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:20.440
That doesn't mean Monster Hunter is a bad game.

02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:23.160
I'm just not feeling it.

02:07:23.160 --> 02:07:25.720
But I promised Shane I would give it another go.

02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:28.920
And so for the emailer, I will give the demo another go.

02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:35.160
But I really don't see myself buying this game until it goes on sale, which considering

02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:37.640
it's a Switch game, might be some time.

02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:39.000
That's all.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:42.440
Well, and as the saying goes, different strokes for different things.

02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:43.160
Exactly.

02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:47.160
Binary667 in our chat says Monster Hunter is divisive.

02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:49.000
That's for sure.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:53.560
I will say, and I meant this, the demo was light years beyond better than the one that

02:07:53.560 --> 02:07:55.960
was on the Wii U, whichever one that was.

02:07:55.960 --> 02:07:59.960
I can't tell them all apart, but it was light years better than that demo.

02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:00.600
That's for sure.

02:08:01.720 --> 02:08:04.600
Shane is also saying we'll also do the demo together next time.

02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:05.880
So you have someone to play with.

02:08:05.880 --> 02:08:09.720
Oh, then that means we'll do Expedition number two and No Man's Sky together as well.

02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:10.360
Won't we, Shane?

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:13.800
I love that.

02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:14.200
Wow.

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:15.320
Sorry.

02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:22.520
I have to acknowledge somebody just gifted 10 subs in our community and it is unlabeled.

02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:25.240
So I just want to say thank you to that.

02:08:25.960 --> 02:08:27.080
Thank you, anonymous gifter.

02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:27.240
Wow.

02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:27.800
Thank you so much.

02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:30.840
Thank you to everybody who's been very generous with that tonight.

02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:32.440
You really don't have to, and you do.

02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:33.160
All right.

02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:33.720
All right.

02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:35.000
Shane said, you know what?

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:35.720
Sure.

02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:36.200
All right.

02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:39.880
I'll give it a little if you are willing to.

02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:44.440
I don't know if I'm willing to drop 60 bucks on Monster Hunter.

02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:47.720
That's the problem, but I'll try the demo again.

02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:48.280
That's for sure.

02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:51.000
Okay, so there you go.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.600
Who knew that Shane would be in chat listening?

02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:53.160
How about that?

02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:54.760
All right.

02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:56.600
That is it for the mailbag.

02:08:56.600 --> 02:09:01.000
If you guys have anything you want us to talk about, you can bring that up in our chat room.

02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:05.000
Or I will turn it over to Loki and see if there's any last minute stories.

02:09:05.720 --> 02:09:08.200
No, it's a slow week.

02:09:08.200 --> 02:09:11.560
Yeah, I really feel like we kind of hit everything that was going on in the news, huh?

02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:13.320
Pretty much.

02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:13.800
Yeah.

02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:14.300
Yeah.

02:09:15.160 --> 02:09:16.200
All right.

02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:20.040
Well, I'll give it another second there to see if any other topics jump out in our chat

02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:21.080
or things to talk about.

02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:22.840
What could I ask?

02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:25.000
Any games you're looking forward to playing in this coming week?

02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:27.720
I don't think there's anything really new coming out,

02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:31.080
but I know I want to try to make some more progress in Outriders.

02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:36.280
I guess this Monster Hunter demo thing will happen in the next few days as well.

02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:41.080
I'm off work tomorrow, so I have plenty of time to vegetate and play games.

02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:47.320
I took off work because I was assuming that I'm going to have horrible side effects to the thing,

02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:48.760
but I'm feeling okay for now.

02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:51.720
But I'm worried after the show, I'm going to completely crash and burn.

02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:54.040
Hopefully not.

02:09:55.240 --> 02:09:58.600
Shane is giving us a reminder in chat saying tonight is the last night.

02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:05.320
In fact, you have 45 minutes left to pre-order the physical No More Heroes games one and two.

02:10:06.280 --> 02:10:07.320
That's good to know.

02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:10.200
Bobby in chat says hopefully you'll just sleep during the side effects.

02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:11.080
That's the plan.

02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:16.680
I think I'd love to just take a Tylenol PM and wake up at noon tomorrow.

02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:21.160
Dan did a lot of sleeping after he got his second shot.

02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:25.880
Of course, mine's going to be the day after my birthday on the 21st.

02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:32.120
So I went ahead and put in to have the next day off at work and see how I feel.

02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:37.480
Although I was sick for three days from the first shot.

02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:41.240
So I can only imagine what I'd be like after the second.

02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:42.120
I hope it's all right.

02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:43.400
All right.

02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:44.280
Well, it's worth it.

02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:45.080
It's worth it.

02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:45.720
Yeah, for sure.

02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:46.600
It's absolutely worth it.

02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:49.560
Because once you get your second shot, then we get to hang out indoors again.

02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:50.120
That'll be fun.

02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:51.160
At least for six months.

02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:52.120
Yeah.

02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:54.760
Well, well, and it may be longer.

02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:55.560
They just don't know yet.

02:10:56.360 --> 02:10:58.200
So at least six months.

02:10:58.200 --> 02:10:59.400
So fingers and toes crossed.

02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:02.360
All right, moving on.

02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:03.960
Let's wrap it up.

02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:06.600
Let's get to our final thoughts, I suppose.

02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:09.720
I want to thank you guys very much for tuning into Orange Launch Radio tonight

02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:11.960
and participating with our program.

02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:16.120
If you like what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.

02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:19.240
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:23.400
But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, then we can't do that.

02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:25.240
So we play for the crickets.

02:11:25.240 --> 02:11:26.280
Yes, we play for the crickets.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:31.720
So a nice five star review on a place like iTunes or wherever it is you found this show.

02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:32.920
That goes a very long way.

02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:34.920
So thank you for all of that.

02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:38.760
Thank you to everybody who sticks with us week in and week out.

02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:41.080
864 in a row and next.

02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:43.640
Well, not totally in a row, but, you know, mostly in a row.

02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:47.720
And that A65 will be coming at you next week as we make our way to 1000.

02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:50.760
And thanks for that hype train earlier, too.

02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:51.260
Yes.

02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:53.880
A big thanks to everybody who participates.

02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:56.920
Of course, I want to send love to the podcast listeners because I know some people can't

02:11:56.920 --> 02:12:00.360
be here Sunday night because like WrestleMania or whatever's going on.

02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:04.600
But for those of you that do tune in on Twitch, we really, really appreciate you guys.

02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:08.040
And especially that generosity you guys show throughout the week.

02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:12.120
I don't care about one person on WrestleMania and that's Oscar.

02:12:13.320 --> 02:12:14.280
She's awesome.

02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:16.840
I have no idea who's even a wrestler.

02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:17.880
She's adorable.

02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:19.880
You need to watch her channel sometime.

02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:22.680
I think I've seen her actually and probably because of you.

02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:26.920
If I'm right, I think she was like a video game programmer.

02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:27.800
I think so.

02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:29.400
I think I've heard of her.

02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:32.760
Yeah, she's the former Nintendo DS dev, says Bobby.

02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:33.880
OK.

02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:34.120
Yeah.

02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:36.760
But I love her so much.

02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:40.200
And I just like how Dan and I watch her channel and we're always like,

02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:41.720
welcome to Kana-chan TV.

02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:44.040
Yo, so every time it starts.

02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:44.920
All right.

02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:48.520
I'm only allowing wrestling talk because I talked for 30 minutes about Dead by Daylight tonight.

02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:49.720
So I'm only Kana.

02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:52.280
I only really care about her because she's great.

02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:52.760
That's it.

02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:53.320
The end.

02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:54.040
Kana is adorable.

02:12:56.200 --> 02:13:00.760
Thanks again to everybody who participates with the show, whether it's on the podcast or here live.

02:13:00.760 --> 02:13:02.280
Hey, did you know we have a store as well?

02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:05.320
If you want to get some merchandise, vognetwork.com slash shop.

02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:09.320
And of course, our Discord server, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:10.840
If you want to stay in touch throughout the week

02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:13.160
and find out when bonus streams are going to be happening.

02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:18.360
Did you know our subscribers have secret access to a special bonus channel?

02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:19.240
It doesn't get used much.

02:13:19.240 --> 02:13:22.200
I'll have to post more pictures of Mr. Smoosh in there or something.

02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:22.700
All right.

02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:26.920
That's all I can think of for the plugs there at the end of the show.

02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:29.720
So let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight.

02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:31.480
Loki, I'll start with you.

02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:34.440
Just more grinding at Minecraft.

02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:36.600
That's going to be this week.

02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:37.100
Yeah.

02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:45.000
My final thought is last night at Target, I found the I almost said the pop cap doll,

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:45.720
but that's not what they're called.

02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:46.680
The pop vinyls.

02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:50.040
I got my Richard Simmons pop vinyl.

02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:50.540
Finally.

02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:52.200
So hooray for me.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:54.760
Now you too can sweat to the oldies.

02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:55.480
That's right.

02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:56.680
I miss that guy.

02:13:56.680 --> 02:13:59.240
I understand, but I understand it's complicated.

02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:01.320
Last but not least, Dark Sakura.

02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:05.160
Stay tuned after the stream.

02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:08.520
Stay in chat for reasons.

02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:09.720
Good.

02:14:09.720 --> 02:14:10.600
Good orders.

02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:12.600
We will see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:14.520
We'll be back to do it all in seven days.

02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:15.560
Have a great week, everybody.

02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:16.060
Good night.

02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:19.720
