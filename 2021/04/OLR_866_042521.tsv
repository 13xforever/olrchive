0	14520	For all the flak that Microsoft caught for sidelining gaming for additional entertainment
14520	18400	options while launching the Xbox One, it's ironic given that Sony is an entertainment
18400	21000	empire that publishes in every notable medium.
21000	24960	Pair that with a recent drama over their desire for only blockbuster gaming titles and now
24960	29160	a rumored PlayStation Plus video pass and what were we complaining about before?
29160	30840	This is the association my brain has drawn.
30840	33960	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to delve more into
33960	36680	the rumors and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where
36680	38320	every gamer has a voice.
38320	45800	Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
45800	48040	where every gamer has a voice.
48040	54640	It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again on this Sunday evening, April the 25th of
54640	59200	the 2021 episode number 866 of our show.
59200	63120	My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined as always by my co-hosts.
63120	65720	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
65720	66720	Hi.
66720	67720	Hi.
67720	72040	And for our Twitch viewers tonight, not the podcast folks because that part gets kind
72040	75880	of like cropped out of the podcast, but we had a new like we have like a little bump
75880	80160	that plays because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock
80160	82760	Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
82760	86880	And there's a few minutes that takes transition from Bobby doing his show in Atlanta over
86880	88480	to us in Sacramento.
88480	92880	So we have a little like, if you've ever watched a Twitch stream, like a stream starting now
92880	96760	equivalent or stream starting soon type equivalent that a lot of your favorite streamers do.
96760	98840	And we had a new one of those tonight.
98840	104160	We've had one for a while that used like free music that I found on some website and a bunch
104160	108360	of collage pictures of Mr. Smoosh, but we've upgraded a little bit.
108360	112580	I always thought, I did always think it was a little unfair that it was just Mr. Smoosh.
112580	116980	Like I know Smoosh is a lovely cat, but we're all cat owners here at OLR.
116980	120540	And we even don't, don't get, we appreciate a good doggo too.
120540	122820	I just want to make sure the dog people don't get pissed.
122820	124100	We appreciate a good doggo too.
124100	125100	I love a corgi.
125100	126300	I have a special place in my heart for that.
126300	131260	There is a dog in the last picture that we didn't show because Midna was kissing her.
131260	132260	I see.
132260	133260	Okay.
133260	135640	So there, so there's that, but, but we have more OLR cat representation and that was all
135640	141900	done by dark soccer, including the new music was, was you, when's the album drop sis?
141900	142900	It doesn't.
142900	147780	Um, and that, and that music to explain people, um, were saying that they did hear it in some
147780	148780	of my streams.
148780	155780	Um, and there was, there was a little misunderstanding, there was a little misunderstanding.
155780	163100	Um, well, but the thing is, is that, um, I'm really glad to, to offer it up to the channel
163100	164100	instead.
164100	170920	I've made some, uh, some new music for myself and I was gonna do, um, I, my plan for today
170960	174440	was actually to work on my channel trailer cause I'm streaming, you know, I'm trying
174440	176160	to get at least once a weekend.
176160	181600	Um, and I made this like in a world, you know, type of serious music.
181600	185120	I'm like, you get to watch this person suck at dead by daylight.
185120	187240	Um, and I was getting everything ready to do that.
187240	188240	I'm like, no, I hate it.
188240	194720	And then Rob was like, we, we, uh, you know, we were talking about the, the intro, the
194720	196200	pre-intro, I guess for the show.
196200	197200	And I was like, I'll do it.
197200	198200	Yeah.
198360	199360	That still cracks me up.
199360	203360	How that happened is that you sent me that intro, that song and you, it intended to use
203360	205860	it for your channel, but somehow I didn't get that message.
205860	210280	So it was very much a, um, here, Rob, I made this and I went, you made this.
210280	211280	I made this.
211280	218600	Bog made this and so there it is now it's on bog, but, uh, I appreciate you giving us
218600	219600	the song.
219600	221480	You made a new one for your channel and it's just as good.
221480	227480	So it worked out, I guess you just had to, my intro one is actually a looped version
227520	236520	of my first completed song that I did, um, and I would like to do like just more music
236520	237520	like that.
237520	242800	I mean, really right now, I'm not the best like keyboardist, even though for people who
242800	250760	are in Twitch right now, I do have myself a nice MIDI keyboard and, uh, I'm still working
250760	251760	on stuff.
251760	256680	I actually paid for my first, uh, logic plugin and I got the, uh, the synthesizer they use
256680	258160	for the Sega Genesis.
258160	262480	Um, before I get to Loki, uh, there's a very well-timed question in chat that I think we
262480	263480	need to address.
263480	269200	Uh, so going to our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network, SSJ 100, Matt says, serious
269200	270200	question.
270200	273880	Could we say drop pet photos in the subscriber chat for it to be added to the photo roll
273880	278240	roll if it's somehow changeable, Jamie, I think we have an answer for that.
278240	279240	Yeah.
279240	282840	Um, I was actually, we were talking about this before the show, but I would love to
282840	291420	have, um, some submissions, um, in the chat is one thing you can private message me your
291420	295000	pictures instead, because I check chat kind of infrequently.
295000	300480	Um, so I'll set up a Twitter thread at OLR, Jamie, and I can just send you the pictures
300480	301480	that people post.
301480	302640	I think that's probably the easiest way to do it.
302640	306360	We'll do a Twitter thread at OLR and for people that are anti Twitter, then they can reach
306360	308360	out to you directly.
308360	311800	Uh, honestly, Twitter is going to be difficult for me.
311800	312800	No, no.
312840	315680	I can, I can pull it all down from Twitter and send to you one big file.
315680	316680	Yeah.
316680	317680	Yeah.
317680	318680	Then that works.
318680	319680	I just need to know.
319680	327320	Um, like if you have the picture in the picture title, put your name and your cat's name.
327320	330840	That's what I want the picture to be labeled so that I know who's is who's.
330840	331840	Awesome.
331840	335360	So, um, yeah, that, and what you guys saw tonight was the first version of that anyway,
335360	338600	because, um, there was a, there was a booboo we're not going to highlight, but Jamie has
338600	339600	to fix it anyway.
339600	342160	So we're going to add more, uh, add more pictures.
342160	345200	Yeah, it's not a big deal, but we were, the plan was to add more stuff anyway.
345200	346200	All right.
346200	348840	Anyway, uh, enough talk about something that podcast folks don't even see.
348840	353440	I'm sorry, but I hope you will check out the archive sometime at twitch.tv slash vog network.
353440	356720	Um, you do have to be a subscriber to see the video feed completely.
356720	360600	Um, but there's a lot of clips, like, uh, people have been clipping parts of the show.
360600	362960	There's, there's a lot that you can just kind of look at for free anyway.
362960	365360	Um, and then make it available somewhere.
365360	366360	Yeah.
366360	367360	Who knows?
367360	368360	Who knows?
368360	369360	Anyway.
369360	370360	Um, so say hello as well to tech master Loki.
370360	371360	Sorry, Loki.
371560	372680	How are you doing?
372680	373680	I'm doing good.
373680	376480	Um, now did I, what, what is running behind you?
376480	378360	Because I swear I saw your own name in that.
378360	379360	What is going on here?
379360	380360	Loki.
380360	381360	That is my own name.
381360	388600	This, this is, uh, the only historical evidence of the greatest gameplay ever, ever I've ever
388600	389600	experienced.
389600	393840	So this is actually on our, um, orange lounge radio, uh, YouTube page.
393840	395480	It's a short sighted.
395480	396480	Yeah.
396480	399840	So this is, um, we have an updated, I just want to point out.
399840	402880	I think that's the last thing that's gone on the orange on your YouTube page.
402880	404800	It hasn't been updated in like 10 years.
404800	405800	Okay.
405800	408520	Like the orange on your YouTube page is kind of a relic at this point.
408520	411640	You want to see how cute we were in our early thirties and late twenties.
411640	413960	Go to the OLR YouTube page.
413960	414960	It's all there.
414960	421360	But yeah, so it, it's a evidence of the modded grand theft auto games, uh, grand theft auto
421360	425480	four games we used to play on Xbox three 60 with my coworkers.
425480	432680	And I seriously have not experienced a more fun version of any game except for that.
432680	437760	And then they patched it out of course, and hadn't played a regular game, which is still
437760	443280	fun, but it's, it was, it's not as, not as fun, as crazy as just everything that you
443280	444280	see in the video.
444280	448080	So, um, that's, what's running behind and I'll probably switch it up to the other short
448080	451240	I have as well with the evil swing set.
451240	454800	How long until grand theft auto six Loki, how long do you think we're going to be waiting
454800	455800	there?
455800	456800	I don't even really play five.
456800	458760	You know, um, I really got out of that.
458760	462920	I finished the single player campaign and then it's all been grand theft auto online
462920	465560	updates and I just haven't gotten into it.
465560	466560	It's such a grind.
466560	468320	Um, it's just not really fun.
468320	470880	Um, some of the races though and stuff look pretty cool.
470880	476200	I used to watch this YouTuber Ali 43, he used to do a lot of the different races and things
476200	477200	that you can do online.
477200	482600	So there's some fun there, but I just, I don't know, I play Minecraft, so I haven't really
482600	487400	gone back to five, but when six comes out, yeah, I'll, I mean, I'll definitely pick it
487400	488400	up.
488400	489400	I'm going to our chat.
489400	491460	Dark Tetsuya says, I got five for free.
491460	493920	So grand theft auto five for free on Epic.
493920	495560	Wondering if I should install it.
495560	497160	Well, yeah, it's a great game.
497160	498160	Yeah, absolutely.
498160	502000	I mean, if you haven't played through it, you should, it's just, I don't know.
502000	503000	I liked four better.
503000	508380	I liked like the open world stuff's fine, but like the way they set up the online matches
508380	513300	and stuff, I liked it so much better because they kind of put you into a section of the
513300	515860	map and you fought it out there.
515860	521260	It's not like this big, I don't know, open world thing where you can do races and stuff
521260	522260	like that.
522260	524540	I just like it more structured kind of like Call of Duty or something like that.
524540	528660	Well, I guess Call of Duty now is a big, you know, battle arena stuff.
528660	533400	So, um, but like the more traditional like Call of Duty type of stuff where it's, it's
533400	538220	a, a level or an arena granted the whole map is open, but they only put weapons as small
538220	539860	portion of it.
539860	544600	And so I really liked that kind of setup where it's more structured like that, but now it's
544600	549340	just like, well, you know, you can have a death match over here or over here.
549340	552220	And then, I don't know, it just wasn't as fun.
552220	553500	I don't know what to say.
553500	560980	It's hard to go back when you have, you know, Uzis that shoot, um, grenades and it just
560980	562500	explosions everywhere.
562500	567900	And then there's planes flying down close to the, you know, road and just flying cop
567900	573380	cars with nuclear shotguns or suitcase bombs and stuff, all this modded stuff that we put
573380	574380	in there.
574380	576380	And it was just so amazing.
576380	580860	Bobby Blackwell also points out that Grand Theft Auto five just went back on game pass.
580860	582900	It was gone for a little bit, but it just came back.
582900	584620	That was some, a recent headline.
584620	587940	I do want to point out though with Dark Tetsuya's question, even though we're kind of sitting
587940	589380	here going, yeah, install it.
589380	590380	You know what?
590580	594580	There's a very real hesitation and a very real reason to ask that question.
594580	597740	And I'm going to give Dark Tetsuya the huge benefit of the doubt there because I've been
597740	602380	in this very similar situation and it is those fucking bandwidth caps.
602380	606060	And if you don't have to deal with those through your cable provider, congratulations.
606060	607060	Good for you.
607060	608060	You are lucky.
608060	609060	You are.
609060	612180	You're very lucky because I'm telling you those bandwidth caps are a pain in the ass
612180	616020	and a game like, um, Grand Theft Auto five is going to be something like, it's gotta
616020	618040	be like 40, 50, 60 gigs.
618040	619040	Like it's pretty big.
619040	620040	Yeah.
620040	621040	It's a big game.
621040	624240	So you really have to think about that kind of stuff before you just go download it.
624240	626960	Um, I think it's a really good game.
626960	630320	It really is like the single player campaign was, it was all right.
630320	631320	I liked it.
631320	633960	Um, but yeah, it's, it's got a good story.
633960	634960	It's fun.
634960	635960	The heists are fun.
635960	638280	Um, I don't know.
638280	639840	There's a lot to do in that game.
639840	641520	It's very like pack full stuff.
641520	645480	And if you really have the patience for Grand Theft Auto line and that could be fun, but
645480	646800	it's just, it's such a grind.
646800	651320	They make it so grindy with like, you have to pay rent for your apartment.
651320	656160	You have to pay rent to have people fix up your cars when they get destroyed by another
656160	657160	player.
657160	661000	Like that stuff is, that's stupid, but I understand why they're doing it because that's where
661000	662000	they're making their money.
662000	664100	They're trying to sell their shark shark cards.
664100	668760	So they make it an unnecessary grind and that kind of ruined it for me because I used to
668760	673560	like, you know, Grand Theft Auto four, for example, great game by itself.
673560	677080	And then they released the loss of the dam expansion, which was also great.
677080	679160	And then the ballad of gay Tony, which was also great.
679160	683340	Like all of the content grant, the thought of four was just amazing.
683340	688640	But then they found out they can make lots more money by having to persist to online
688640	689640	mode.
689640	690880	And so that's where it's going to go.
690880	694940	And that's where six is probably going to go, unfortunately, even though the campaign
694940	700980	is really good, but I'll buy it anyways, because I love those games.
700980	705420	So it is disappointing though, that it's not structured the way it was because I really
705420	706420	did like those.
706420	707420	All right.
707420	713220	Uh, so I, I'm looking and there's a, I usually read all the, uh, donators and stuff at the
713220	716340	end of the show after we go off air, just live only on Twitch.
716340	720140	But I have to acknowledge that there is a hype train going on right now.
720140	723860	And I, I just put in a hundred biddies myself to kick it up to the next level.
723860	725400	So people get more emotes.
725400	727420	So I'd own their pixel pockets, just did it too.
727420	731700	And many of you are donating bits and subs and thank you guys, you really don't have
731700	732700	to do that.
732700	733700	I know.
733700	734700	Thank you.
734700	735700	Thank you all.
735700	737940	And I'll read, I'll read that all at the end of the show as I usually do.
737940	743140	I, I, you know, it's, it's tricky cause we're walking that line between we're recording
743140	747340	our podcast yet we are live on Twitch and it is very custom for Twitch streamers to
747340	749900	thank people right as they donate.
749900	753420	But it is hard when you're trying to, you know, do these stories and all these other
753420	757140	things and try to keep the flow of your show going, which isn't as pleasant to listen to
757140	760580	when you're in your car on a commuting train, you know, it's like, Hey, you were talking
760580	761580	about this story.
761580	762580	You don't get sidetracked.
762580	765340	Uh, us at OLR get sidetracked.
765340	768460	I guess maybe it's something you've come to expect here at OLR.
768460	769460	I don't know.
769460	771620	Who do you think you're listening to?
771620	772620	Oh my gosh.
772620	774620	You guys are so kind.
774620	777700	VGRealness donated more and said, don't tell me what to do.
777700	778700	You're not my real dad.
778700	779700	I did it again.
779700	781780	What are you going to do about it?
781780	784300	Punish you.
784340	792820	All right, moving on, uh, let's get it before things get really awkward here at OLR.
792820	796500	Let's move on and talk about our kickoff topic tonight.
796500	801620	Uh, Loki, you want to tell us a little bit about this, the, the, I heard you like stores.
801620	802620	Yeah.
802620	804580	So Epic says, Hey, you know what?
804580	807140	We have a storefront, let's make more storefronts.
807140	808980	So, uh, that's what they're doing.
808980	815660	They're adding some different apps, um, into the Epic game storefront and, uh, some of
815660	818500	those, they had five non gaming apps included with it.
818500	823860	So they have a brave, which I guess is some open source web browser can shape, uh, which
823860	825060	is actually really cool.
825060	829980	So this is, um, if you're in game development, you'd probably know who Kenny is.
829980	837060	Kenny is this guy who develops a lot of these free, um, creative commons, zero free to use
837060	838360	assets.
838360	843240	And so he has this new thing called Ken shape that you can use to generate simple low poly
843240	847440	objects, just kind of drawing a picture and assigning like depth to it.
847440	848440	And so it's really cool.
848440	854000	So he's, um, they have that on there, uh, Krita, which is a painting and drawing app.
854000	858320	Um, and then of course I heart radio, you guys are probably aware of that.
858320	862800	Um, but then there's also, um, I guess like some itch IO stuff in there as well.
862800	864680	So that's kind of interesting.
864680	871040	Um, does that mean I can, uh, put pixel poops number two on there?
871040	874240	That was, that was a question I was going to ask you, does this mean that now pixel
874240	879640	poops, uh, number two is available on the, uh, on the, um, Epic game store?
879640	882680	I mean, I guess it does, doesn't it?
882680	888560	I mean, I, I guess, I guess you can, yeah, you can go within the store and then purchase
888560	891200	pixel poops number two, if you wanted to.
891200	892200	Huh?
892800	896960	So technically, yes, we're on the Epic game store now, I guess.
896960	898160	All right.
898160	899160	That's great.
899160	904440	Um, and, uh, Bobby is saying in chat, it's literally just the itch IO app that you can
904440	905440	download.
905440	910840	You can download it from their site or from Epic game store itch IO games are not listed
910840	916520	on Epic game store, which is how a lot of people are kind of reporting this is that,
916520	919320	Oh, it's embedded within, you know, the Epic game store.
919560	924280	They're, they're, they're, they're taking over, uh, itch IO and all this stuff, or I'm
924280	925960	sorry, they're Epic has taken over itch.
925960	927600	I it's, that's not the case.
927600	931160	So I think the app based thing is a way to think about it.
931160	935680	It's just basically that they're launching their own app store, which when you consider
935680	939600	what they've got going on in court and all this stuff right now, you know, again, I'm
939600	942560	not going to touch that right now, cause we've got a long way to go in the court proceedings
942560	943560	and all that stuff.
943560	948020	But to hear that Epic is launching their own app store itch being one of those apps.
948020	949740	That makes a lot of sense.
949740	950740	Right.
950740	951740	Yeah.
951740	953540	And, and it's still pretty cool though.
953540	958380	It's more exposure because there may be some people that are on, you know, get played stuff
958380	960780	from steam or Epic games that they even know what it is.
960780	964300	So, you know, more exposure is not a bad thing.
964300	965420	Yeah, for sure.
965420	967760	Um, and, uh, yeah, you're right.
967760	972940	People may not necessarily, um, go to the itch website or even think about that, but
972940	976980	maybe if they see within the Epic store and their Fortnite launcher that they're, Oh,
976980	981640	there's this whole other game space, it may be a place that they can get exposed to even
981640	982640	more stuff.
982640	984520	And there's a lot of great stuff on itch.io, obviously.
984520	989540	And I'm sure many of you own a truckload of games on itch.io already.
989540	994400	Cause I, there were a lot of people I knew that participated in that, um, black lives
994400	999100	matter or I was at a racial justice and inequity bundle.
999100	1004000	I'm sorry, I forget the actual name right now, but it was, it was, it was what they
1004020	1008760	did when, you know, uh, that was really in the focus, um, as, as it should continue to
1008760	1009760	be, let's be real.
1009760	1010760	But you know what I mean?
1010760	1015400	Really, really in the focus, uh, in June of last year, they did that bundle and many people
1015400	1019480	probably picked up like, there was like 2000 games in that bundle or something like that.
1019480	1020480	Right.
1020480	1021880	And how many did y'all play?
1021880	1026520	You know, so, um, there's, there's a lot, talk about a backlog, right?
1026520	1029160	So, uh, so many backlogs.
1029160	1030160	Yeah.
1030160	1031160	Uh, this is funny.
1031320	1035520	VG realness and chat is like, whoa, I mixed missed a few weeks.
1035520	1037360	Did Loki release his game?
1037360	1039720	Well, let it be, let us get you caught up.
1039720	1041600	Yes, he released his game.
1041600	1047640	Um, it is, um, so, uh, if you want to give Loki the most money for the game, you're going
1047640	1050600	to go to itch.io and buy it there basically.
1050600	1055840	But I have to kind of plug Aaron or YYR's pixel poops as well.
1055840	1060040	So I would really also want to point you over to the steam store where the game pixel poops
1060040	1061360	is free to play.
1061360	1063000	Um, and you can check that out.
1063000	1064080	That's our buddy YYR.
1064080	1068600	And then there are two other versions of the game that are basically DLC.
1068600	1073120	You have a cute little Commodore 64 version, which not enough people are talking about.
1073120	1077000	You can buy that for, um, a certain amount of money that I forget in the moment, but
1077000	1078480	it's under $5.
1078480	1082560	And then there's your version of the game Loki, which is an NES game.
1082560	1086720	And it's, you know, it's a little more, it's like $10, but you are getting like a really
1086720	1089240	full NES cartridge experience.
1089240	1093400	And there's still, yeah, and I'm still working on the special edition of it.
1093400	1095800	So the special edition has actually 10 more levels.
1095800	1097640	Um, it'll be a free update.
1097640	1103120	So if you do purchase it before then you'll get a free update soon because I only have
1103120	1104240	two more levels for it.
1104240	1109260	Although I just saw tutorials on how to do animated tiles, so I may have to tweak that,
1109260	1112000	but there's still like some updates I want to do to that.
1112000	1114280	And then yeah, eventually like a physical release.
1114280	1116320	I don't know how I'm going to do that yet.
1116320	1117840	Um, I have cartridges.
1117840	1123760	I can at least make 12, um, which based on the downloads so far and the purchases that
1123760	1129960	may be all the interest we have, so we can, we can do it, but, um, we can see what we
1129960	1134440	need to come up with there, but yeah, I've, I do want to have packed that cartridge as
1134440	1138800	full as possible, um, before I actually start burning those.
1138800	1142880	So that's why I made like, at least it's going to be at least 10 more levels.
1142880	1145760	Um, I want to do more, but we'll see.
1145760	1149880	Um, VG realness and chat says it's no longer the running joke of the podcast.
1149880	1150880	What's it going to be now?
1150880	1158040	Um, well, this is tough because maybe I was going to say Loki's, Loki's a game maker.
1158040	1160200	Dark soccer is a music musician.
1160200	1169560	Uh, I, um, well, um, maybe, maybe that's the joke and I don't even cook.
1169560	1178120	I, I like to talk, uh, I'll do a series of motivational speeches or something.
1178120	1179120	I don't know.
1179120	1180120	Yeah, exactly.
1180120	1181120	This is like crickets.
1181120	1182120	So that's the new joke.
1182120	1185120	My life.
1185120	1188200	Your life is great.
1188200	1189200	No I do.
1189200	1190200	I do have things pretty good.
1190200	1194320	I can't, but, but if you can't make fun of yourself and your friends, how are you going
1194320	1196280	to make fun of somebody else?
1196280	1197280	Yeah.
1197280	1198280	All right.
1198280	1199280	Oh, thank you.
1200000	1201000	Look at that.
1201000	1202000	I was fishing, fishing for compliments there.
1202000	1203000	S2 100 Matt.
1203000	1204440	Rob is a great MC of things.
1204440	1205440	That's right.
1205440	1206440	You know what?
1206440	1208960	I look forward for COVID to being over and I can get back into live hosting and doing
1208960	1210040	panels and stuff like that.
1210040	1211800	I, I, they, I, you're right.
1211800	1214160	I, I love, I missed that a lot.
1214160	1215160	So soon.
1215160	1222600	Anyway, back to, uh, the Epic games store, adding another store, um, what do you, so,
1222600	1227840	so Loki, do you think this is going to sell that 13th copy of the game or no, this isn't
1227840	1229120	going to have, this isn't going to change anything.
1229120	1230600	That's not going to change anything.
1230600	1231600	It's a nice app though.
1231600	1237040	I haven't had that downloaded yet, so, um, I get to see all the stuff that I own, which
1237040	1238040	is a lot.
1238040	1243000	I'll be curious kind of like how that works, if it's still kind of all embedded within
1243000	1247600	the Epic store kind of front, or if it goes, cause it sounds like, especially the way Bobby's
1247600	1251280	describing it, it's like, it's just a whole separate thing.
1251280	1254640	So you don't even really have to wait for the Epic store to have it.
1254640	1257680	You just go download it on itch.io's website and you check it out there.
1257680	1258680	So there is that.
1258680	1260680	So, all right.
1260680	1265260	Well, um, at the end of the day, do you think this is a good thing for indies or does this
1265260	1267800	feel like, Oh, it might be a cash in or something like that?
1267800	1269520	I think it's a cash in at all.
1269520	1271880	I think it's good to have that stuff out there.
1271880	1275640	It'd be even better if it was integrated into Epic game store, but I can understand why
1275640	1277440	they don't do that.
1277440	1278440	Yeah.
1278440	1282200	Um, yeah, we'll see, we'll see what ends up developing.
1282200	1285720	I'll be curious to hear if any developers on itch.io notice a little boost from this,
1285720	1290240	but yeah, I doubt at the end of the day, it's super kind of likely like either you
1290240	1293320	are looking into these things or you're not.
1293320	1294320	Right.
1294320	1295320	So, right.
1295320	1296320	Yeah.
1296320	1297320	All right.
1297320	1301720	Um, anyhow, moving on, um, gosh, you got to that level four hype train in chat.
1301720	1302720	Thank you guys so much.
1302720	1304800	There was a lot of anonymous donations and things like that.
1304800	1305800	Gosh, gosh, gosh.
1305800	1306800	I'm very, very thankful.
1306800	1307800	Okay.
1307800	1310800	Um, before we get into our gaming weeks, a little bit of other housekeeping here at the
1310800	1311800	voice geeks network.
1311800	1317560	I do want to give a shout out, um, to our pal, uh, Shane or, or shad stars, like, um,
1317560	1321360	because he was a huge and instrumental in making this bonus stream happen here at the
1321360	1322360	voice geeks network.
1322360	1328600	This past week, uh, we did Shane's definitive Pokemon rankings, uh, and he illustrated his
1328600	1334520	bottom 10 Pokemon and his top 50 Pokemon, and he even put together a PowerPoint.
1334520	1338200	And so I'm actually very thankful that he like, you know, he kind of said that as a
1338200	1340680	joke and then I was like, Oh no, now you got to do it.
1340680	1341880	And he actually did do it.
1341880	1345600	So I, you know, he's, he has better things he could be doing, um, like playing monster
1345600	1349200	Hunter, I'm sure, but he did take the time out to do that and do the stream.
1349200	1350200	And it was fun.
1350200	1354560	Uh, I thought it was, you know, we, we ruffled a lot of feathers, I'm sure with the rankings,
1354560	1356180	but, um, it was, it was a lot of fun.
1356180	1357260	So check that out.
1357260	1361820	If you are a subscriber here, uh, at twitch.tv, which a lot of you just became tonight, uh,
1361820	1363180	with gift subs and things like that.
1363180	1364220	So check that out.
1364220	1367480	You can check that out, um, in the archives right now that's available.
1368120	1373400	And we are looking to build more stuff out there in the archives so that, um, those of
1373400	1377200	you that are so generous in subscribing, um, you know, really have, have more to look forward
1377200	1379680	to as an extra special way to say thank you.
1379680	1386880	Um, by the way, yes, I heard about the podcast app getting subscriptions and stuff this week.
1386880	1388960	Uh, no comment on that at this time.
1388960	1391120	I, we don't know enough details.
1391120	1393760	I, right now the focus is on, on VOG.
1393760	1399680	Um, and I, I do not see us, um, well, let me put it this way.
1399680	1404120	It's been for the past 19 years, our MO has been, this show is free.
1404120	1407200	This three hour thing that we do on Sunday nights, because it's a way to hang out with
1407200	1408460	friends and all that stuff.
1408460	1409460	That's free.
1409460	1411880	That will not change period.
1411880	1415880	Anything we do is going to be something extra in addition to that.
1415880	1419900	Um, but I, I don't know if that is going to be, I, I'm kind of a little more focused on
1419900	1423420	what we're trying to do, uh, at Twitch right now, but I know that question is going to
1423420	1424420	get asked.
1424420	1427300	Um, so I'm just going to clear up that air right now.
1427300	1430980	Um, let's see, uh, what else I want to say with that?
1430980	1433180	Oh, so Shane did the Pokemon ranking stream.
1433180	1438580	It was a lot of fun and we're starting to raise the channel points for another stream.
1438580	1440300	Bobby's going to do the next one.
1440300	1443960	He's going to do something a little similar to what he did the first time with the tapes,
1443960	1450040	and he's going to be doing some more E3 footage, uh, unearthed from the early two thousands.
1450040	1456600	Um, and this is also neat because Bobby hasn't re-watched these tapes and he's going to go
1456600	1458500	and put them onto Twitch.
1458500	1464040	There may be more embarrassing shit like when he got Charles Martinet to be like, oh, it's
1464040	1469040	Robert's TV show and all these things, which if you haven't seen the clip, please see the
1469040	1470040	clip.
1470120	1475360	So we don't know what kinds of stuff will show up there, so please, uh, look forward
1475360	1476360	to that.
1476360	1480040	I'm almost confident we're going to raise the points, uh, and, uh, that'll happen in
1480040	1481040	the coming weeks.
1481040	1485160	And then the ball will be back in our court to do something, but there are ideas there.
1485160	1489160	I actually have ideas right now that I don't even necessarily want to do channel points
1489160	1490160	for.
1490160	1491160	I just want to do it.
1491160	1494200	And Dark Sakura, we've been talking about some stuff like that and, uh, I want to rope
1494200	1495860	Loki in on some ideas too.
1495860	1496860	So we'll see.
1496860	1497860	We'll see.
1497860	1498860	All right.
1498980	1502980	So anyway, uh, check that out all over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
1502980	1507100	Let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the types of games that we have been playing
1507100	1508100	this week.
1508100	1509100	Dark Sakura.
1509100	1512220	I know where this is going to go, but I think this is interesting.
1512220	1513220	So go for it.
1513220	1514220	It's more than animal crossing.
1514220	1515220	That's true.
1515220	1516220	It is more than animal crossing.
1516220	1521140	So, um, yes, of course I did play animal crossing and I'm still playing word scapes.
1521140	1524140	Um, but of course I'm playing dead by daylight.
1524140	1527060	Um, I am not great at it.
1527060	1532300	Actually, it takes more than five rounds of playing the game to, you know, actually
1532300	1533300	be good.
1533300	1535900	Although I finally got someone to sacrifice.
1535900	1543900	Um, but, uh, I've been enjoying, uh, trolling trolls in the game.
1543900	1547420	You know how people like try to do the teabag move and everything.
1547420	1552700	And there were these, uh, little jerks that were up on it, whatever the name of the, the
1552700	1555300	Myers level is where the houses hadn't filled.
1555300	1556300	Yeah.
1556540	1558900	Well, they were up on this like awning of a house.
1558900	1561460	So I just sat there throwing up on them the whole time.
1561460	1567460	Cause I played the Vami Mami and Legion is still number one in my heart nurse will be
1567460	1568980	my end game.
1568980	1573980	But right now I'm leveling the Vami Mami to get her stuff, to get a teachable.
1573980	1581620	Anyway, I also did, uh, download another game on Apple arcade that I plan on streaming when
1581620	1588060	I, uh, when I have a, a little bit more of a mood for it and that's Fantasian.
1588060	1589060	Oh yeah.
1589060	1590060	I want to see that.
1590060	1591060	Sign me up.
1591060	1592060	Yeah.
1592060	1597220	Um, so, uh, because I do have my subscription to Apple arcade and I am playing on a Mac.
1597220	1605940	Um, for the record, I get a lot of people now asking me about like how I'm playing,
1605940	1609100	um, dead by daylight on a Mac.
1609100	1615740	And they're like kind of floored that, that I am using Stadia and that I'm streaming from
1615740	1616740	Stadia.
1616740	1617740	Yeah.
1617740	1621180	I, even I'm impressed that you're streaming gameplay from Stadia.
1621180	1625380	The only time I've ever streamed Stadia footage was actually on this show.
1625380	1629220	I think the week it came out or the week I got it when Bobby gave me a code or whatever,
1629220	1633260	I recorded it in advance and then played it back on this show.
1633260	1636540	I think that my video quality has been pretty good.
1636540	1639980	Um, I've already downloaded a few, I've, I've clipped a few things.
1639980	1641820	You can see it on my channel later on.
1641820	1645100	Once you, once you fixed your proportions, you couldn't see the URL and that stuff anymore.
1645100	1646100	It looks great.
1646100	1647100	Yeah.
1647100	1648100	Yeah.
1648100	1653740	Um, it was, yeah, I really had to just tweak a lot of things in there, but, um, I'll be
1653740	1658620	playing, um, some other games I think through Stadia as well, depending on, uh, when they
1658620	1659620	come out.
1659620	1666060	Like I'm considering, I mean, I don't want to buy, um, mass effect through Stadia because
1666060	1671780	I want to eventually get my virtualization cleared up and, you know, have like a Parallels
1671780	1674140	desktop or something.
1674140	1681940	But um, I'm considering just trying to do a mass effect when it comes out through Parallels,
1681940	1685780	if I can get that, but yeah, Stadia has been a delight.
1685780	1689340	I take back every bad thing I've ever said about it.
1689340	1690340	Interesting.
1690340	1691340	Huh.
1691340	1699220	On top of that, they had a lot of the dead by daylight DLC, um, on sale cheaper than
1699220	1703140	how steam had it for a bit because they had it for half price.
1703140	1705700	Be sure to promote that in your streams too, that you're playing on state.
1705700	1710980	I think you do, but be sure to make sure Stadia is in there cause I, Stadia does have a small
1710980	1715100	but loyal following and I bet they would seek out just people that are streaming on Stadia.
1715100	1720480	Um, orange right in chat says I did play Stadia on my Twitch before it's definitely possible.
1720480	1721480	Pretty interesting.
1721480	1726200	The one problem I have, and I'm going to send this out as sort of a warning to other streamers
1726200	1727200	on Mac.
1727200	1731680	Um, so one thing about OBS that people don't realize is that you're going to have to have
1731680	1736080	a second sound input that your system sounds will route through.
1736080	1740920	I use this app called EQ Mac and that's what I used to capture my game audio.
1740920	1746960	That's why when I was streaming animal crossing before my game audio wasn't being picked up.
1746960	1750640	This very broadcast is coming to you from a Mac mini and we had to do a similar thing
1750640	1752360	here in studio for that.
1752360	1753360	Yeah.
1753360	1759240	Um, so to answer what Stadia is, it is a streaming game service owned by Amazon.
1759240	1760240	Google.
1760240	1761760	Um, Google or Google.
1761760	1763240	No, Amazon's was something different.
1763240	1764240	Amazon's was Luna.
1764240	1771280	Amazon is through Google and it's, uh, lots of really great games on there.
1771280	1776040	I wish they did had a bigger library, but you can actually, it is like the G force now
1776040	1777040	thing.
1777040	1778600	Um, and I was going to use the G force now.
1778600	1780920	I actually really prefer Stadia.
1780920	1785640	Um, but it's really just, it's been really great.
1785640	1786800	There's a lot of good games on it.
1786800	1791280	It's enough to make me think about, uh, subscribing again to, uh, Stadia pro.
1791280	1799200	Um, but back to the other thing, um, I've also found trouble with steam labs, OBS capturing
1799200	1802600	my stadia screen where standard OBS does it just fine.
1802600	1806200	So just wanted to throw that out there for other folks who might consider playing on
1806200	1807560	stadium streaming.
1807560	1811920	I do also to, uh, clarify what I'm amethyst Rose, which is saying in our chat with the
1811920	1814320	questions about Stadia and video G force.
1814320	1818480	Now, one thing you do, you do, especially cause I noticed amethyst Rose, which says,
1818480	1819920	okay, I love G force now.
1819920	1823160	Well, one thing you're going to want to be very aware of is, is that the pricing structure
1823160	1824840	is very different between the two.
1824840	1825840	That's the other big thing.
1825840	1829960	I mean, in functionality, they're both cloud based gaming services, but Nvidia kind of
1829960	1832600	taps into games you already own.
1832600	1836120	Like it looks at your steam library and you know, what's installed on your computer and
1836120	1838720	you kind of connect it to games that you already own.
1838720	1843960	And then you're paying Nvidia basically to rent their computer and their, their super
1843960	1846000	powerful computer and stream from that.
1846000	1849400	Uh, but of course they have that free version, but you might run into a queue.
1849400	1850720	You're limited to an hour.
1850720	1854280	So there's things with that, or you can pay the 10 bucks to have the, whenever you want
1854280	1857320	it and the highest quality and all that stuff.
1857320	1862280	But, uh, you're not paying to rent the computer or what have you, not paying to rent Google's
1862280	1868520	computer, but you are having to buy the games uniquely on Stadia's storefront.
1868520	1873320	So when you buy a game on state, unless it's cross play or cross purchase, which very few
1873320	1879600	are, unless you have Stadia pro, then you pay 10 bucks a month and you can get a bunch
1879600	1881520	of games for quote free.
1881520	1882520	Yeah, right.
1882520	1883600	There is that as well.
1883600	1888080	So, so just, I want to make sure that the pricing configurations are a little different
1888080	1890200	between the two and kind of like where the ownership is.
1890200	1893440	And I think that's important to weigh when you're deciding which one you want to go with.
1893440	1899120	But I really do think, especially when Microsoft, which they're getting closer and closer to
1899120	1904020	launching this whole thing with Xbox, when that gets closer and they launched that fully,
1904020	1908000	I think you're really going to see cloud gaming take off in a lot of different ways.
1908000	1912860	Um, which has me a little bit nervous again with the bandwidth cap thing, but I'm hoping
1912860	1917620	as that becomes more and more the norm, there's going to be more pressure on cable companies
1917620	1919980	to increase that cap to something reasonable.
1919980	1920980	But we'll see.
1920980	1921980	I don't know.
1921980	1924580	It's that this is a process that will take years, not months to be honest.
1924580	1925580	Data should be free.
1925580	1926620	It really should be.
1926620	1928820	But we all know, you know, yeah, anyway.
1928820	1929820	All right.
1929820	1932060	Uh, so that was a dark soccer's gaming week.
1932060	1935700	Oh, actually one of the things, and I don't mean to make this the dead by daylight cast,
1935700	1936700	which we've talked about.
1936700	1937700	We've talked about the game.
1937700	1939180	Maybe we should do that.
1939180	1940640	Well, let's talk later.
1940640	1946320	But um, I do want to ask about this because you were kind of saying I'm struggling with
1946320	1947680	the game a little bit.
1947680	1949560	It's hard, you know, to get in there.
1949560	1954680	And obviously practice is a big deal, but I have found this element of it fascinating
1954680	1959780	for me, quite frankly, Jamie, is that you like to play the killer, which is a first
1959780	1961480	person game.
1961480	1967580	You have been very adverse over the years to playing first person games because of what,
1967580	1972100	you know, it can make you sick if it's not, you know, the right thing and all this stuff.
1972100	1978460	So I'm, but I know the lore of this game and everything else is like, Halo's lore did not
1978460	1983980	pull you in dead by daylight's Lord pulled you in to make you go enough like, all right,
1983980	1986580	I got to just mentally give this a shot.
1986580	1988300	So I play windowed.
1988300	1990700	Oh, you play it in windowed.
1990700	1992900	So that way it's not your entire screen.
1992900	1993900	Ah, exactly.
1993900	1996460	So then it's just a smaller area.
1996460	1997460	Yeah.
1997460	2002820	I mean, I play with a pretty, pretty big screen, you know, I mean, keep in mind my I've got
2002820	2009420	a 32 inch ultra widescreen monitor with a really great refresh rate.
2009420	2013500	So it turns out that the other part of things had to do with the refresh.
2013500	2020140	When I'm using a 60 megahertz screen, I get more nauseous having a higher refresh rate
2020140	2021140	on my monitor.
2021140	2025460	So I have a 144 has actually made it a bit easier for me.
2025460	2026460	Okay.
2026460	2029580	So that was exactly what I needed to know is kind of like, how did you consolidate that
2029580	2033500	and kind of, I don't want to say, get over it because when we're talking about physical
2033500	2035740	things, I don't want to ever say, you know, Oh, get over it.
2035740	2037980	But how were you able to kind of make it work, I guess.
2037980	2040860	And that, that explains a lot because yeah, when you play in windowed mode, then your
2040860	2045940	eyes can kind of fixate if it needs to on the static background and that kind of helps,
2045940	2046940	right?
2046940	2047940	Yeah.
2047940	2048940	So it really does help.
2048940	2050660	And the fact that actually the color of my background.
2050660	2056380	So I have this a super Metroid background that's, you know, the, the dead people in
2056380	2062700	the lab and the purples and blues actually add a nice frame around it that I also get
2062700	2066420	less eye strain out of it.
2066420	2072420	And so, and to answer, I answered DJ Ron mass already, but I'll say if it's an LG monitor,
2072420	2075020	yes, my monitor is an LG.
2075020	2079340	I paid almost as much as my Mac for, for my monitor.
2079340	2080340	Yeah.
2081020	2091100	Well, I cash stocks, but yeah, I, and I make sure that I keep softer light in my room.
2091100	2097420	Like right now I have my lamp on cause I'm doing the show and I'll probably have it for
2097420	2101060	other streaming events later.
2101060	2104500	But it's, I've got to do a couple of things and I also make sure that I have something
2104500	2109180	a little carby to eat because it keeps my stomach from flip-flopping.
2109500	2112740	I just, I just think that that part, so it's not even really just about dead by daylight.
2112740	2115660	So, you know, don't, don't razz me too much for talking about this game in depth three
2115660	2116660	weeks in a row.
2116660	2123540	But I think it's more the dark soccer kind of over or kind of accommodated this you know,
2123540	2127300	thing that she's dealt with in first person games before to make it work because dead
2127300	2131580	by daylight and the story and the uniqueness of it has appealed to her that much.
2131580	2134860	I find that super fascinating, honestly, but absolutely.
2134860	2138380	But I also think that's part of why you're having an uphill climb Jamie, because I know
2138380	2140420	you were asking like, well, how did you do it so fast?
2140420	2143260	Well, I've played a crap ton of first person games.
2143260	2144300	I've played the halo.
2144300	2146100	I've played all this other stuff.
2146100	2150380	And I think inherently there's stuff with that, that you have to get used to on how
2150380	2152580	those games control and how they move.
2152580	2156940	And so you trying to navigate that and trying to make sure you don't get sick while playing
2156940	2157940	it.
2157940	2159900	I think you're going to have an even longer uphill climb.
2159900	2160900	You'll get there.
2160900	2161900	Practice makes perfect.
2161900	2162900	Right?
2162900	2167380	Yeah, well, and I, I mean, the thing is, is that I know that the game still for, for Killers
2167380	2169540	has a pretty decent curve on it anyway.
2169540	2174860	It does, especially since I'm starting with one of the harder characters when you have
2174860	2178820	to, you have to work your way up and level the characters that you can get more perks
2178820	2180700	and then the perks help you do better.
2180700	2181700	It does.
2181700	2182700	It has a steep climb.
2182700	2183700	She's tall.
2183700	2185180	I'm not used to tall.
2185180	2190300	Like I do better and now I and I'll get off the topic in a second.
2190300	2197140	I've done better with some of the faster characters like Legion and trickster.
2197140	2198140	They're fun.
2198140	2199220	I like the fast ones.
2199220	2205260	I mean, tricksters, even with his Buffy still not very good, but, um, I hate, I hate playing
2205260	2206260	Bubba.
2206260	2208540	I hate him and I'm going to have to level him for barbecue.
2208540	2213220	So yeah, it's just, I think that that's the thing is that I'm getting over characters.
2213220	2218660	I'm not having a lot of fun with to get to the stuff I'm going to have fun with.
2218660	2222460	Cause when I get to nurse, it's over, it's over for you host.
2223220	2229500	Oh, cause if someone can play nurse really well, just bend over and kiss your ass.
2229500	2230500	Goodbye.
2230500	2231500	All right.
2231500	2234220	Um, I do want to also mention, um, cause we've been talking about the, uh, you know, these
2234220	2236780	issues and pixel pocket says, thanks for the tips, Jamie.
2236780	2241380	Um, I try to get around, I try to get around motion sickness with windowed screen, large
2241380	2243660	F FOV field of vision.
2243660	2244660	Right.
2244660	2249800	Um, and recently got a 144 Hertz monitor and it's helped, but some games still cause it.
2250240	2251240	Yeah.
2251240	2252240	I I'll have the same problem.
2252240	2258480	Um, and the thing is the field of vision with, uh, in a dead by daylight is very, I guess,
2258480	2259480	human range.
2259480	2264040	Um, like when I'm playing a plague, Vami Mami, she's taller.
2264040	2269160	So her field of vision is different for me, but when I'm play somebody who's got a field
2269160	2273480	of vision, that's very similar to short little me, you know, it's easier.
2273480	2275840	I don't, I don't have as many problems with it.
2276360	2281000	Um, and there are, I think perks you can get that expand or add ons that expand your field
2281000	2282360	of view for your character.
2282360	2283360	Wraith has some.
2283360	2284360	Yeah.
2284360	2285360	Yeah.
2285360	2286360	Well, ding dong.
2286360	2295520	But anyway, um, I, I don't know, I I've, I've seen them in play and the standard FOV is,
2295520	2297580	is honestly better.
2297580	2300440	And then one other thing I want to point out is that, um, Bobby Black Wolf was kind of
2300440	2304660	speaking up to, to one other thing you've been kind of open about your aversions with
2304660	2305660	on the show.
2305660	2310300	And that is VR, which I, I don't think is anything against VR as it is, but that VR
2310300	2314140	kind of plays into a lot of the same things that have triggered sickness and first person
2314140	2320200	games if I'm not misstating these, but Bobby points out, and I think this is also interesting.
2320200	2324780	This is why VR devices are pushing for higher refresh rates.
2324780	2329360	The valve index now does 124 or excuse me, 120 Hertz.
2329360	2333660	So it's interesting to see that VR, that industry realizes this as well.
2333660	2337880	And they're trying to get to those higher refresh rates to maybe hopefully one day when,
2337880	2339960	when more people like you over, we'll see.
2339960	2340960	So we'll see.
2340960	2341960	We'll see.
2341960	2342960	Interesting.
2342960	2343960	All right.
2343960	2345860	Uh, anyway, thank you for indulging my, uh, questions there.
2345860	2349860	And, uh, I will say, um, live here at the voice of geeks network, um, tonight after
2349860	2355760	the show, I believe you're gonna show, show some of your chops on some of my not chops.
2355760	2359760	So I think it's basically just going to be a giant puke fest with vami mommy.
2359760	2361960	So you're going to be streaming a little bit after OLR tonight.
2361960	2362960	So it'd be fun to watch.
2362960	2363960	Yeah.
2363960	2368020	And keep in mind, I don't normally like to stream after we do or do much of anything
2368020	2374580	after OLR because, um, I, I'm usually really tired after this show, but I'll switch off
2374580	2380660	my headphones and put on the, the desktop audio and I'll, I'll suck it up for y'all.
2380660	2381660	All right.
2381660	2382660	Sounds good.
2382660	2383660	All right.
2383660	2385100	Uh, Loki, thanks for waiting.
2385100	2386500	And how was your gaming week?
2386500	2389940	Uh, it was pretty much all the same.
2389940	2395860	So been all Minecraft all week long playing on that multiplayer server that I'm on now.
2395860	2398160	Still also trying to edit my video together.
2398160	2400200	I'm almost done with the first episode.
2400200	2406620	It just, um, I need to do more voiceovers because a lot of the stuff that recorded before
2406620	2413120	I didn't do voiceovers during, um, just because it's hard to do that, you know, in the area
2413120	2419520	that I am, um, so it's just a lot of voiceover recording and editing together for that.
2419520	2421320	But I am enjoying it.
2421320	2426240	I'm, uh, built some farms and have to open up a shop.
2426240	2428540	So I've got a lot more farms to make.
2428540	2432420	And then I've taken the week off this week to play a lot of that.
2432420	2438360	So it'll be a lot of Minecraft this week and then Orna, a little bit of Orna as well.
2438360	2442500	Uh, I haven't, I haven't, I gotta admit, I've completely fallen off the Orna wagon.
2442500	2444400	I haven't played in a month.
2444400	2445400	Easy.
2445400	2448680	It's just, I can only fit in so many of those games, right?
2448680	2452640	When I'm out and about and Orna's kind of got, I think Pokemon go kind of got my interest
2452640	2457080	enough again, where it's like an Ingress to an extent where Orna's kind of in the backseat.
2457080	2459900	I don't know how much longer the Ingress thing is going to last, but they're really trying
2459900	2462200	to push new stuff in that game to keep it interesting.
2462200	2463560	I'll talk about that in a second.
2463560	2465640	Um, so Orna's just kind of in the backseat for now.
2465640	2466640	Yeah.
2466640	2469680	I've been just trying to grind at that cause I'm still like one 84.
2469680	2471360	Like I can't level up.
2471360	2472720	It doesn't, it's, I don't know.
2472720	2475040	I like fight boss after boss.
2475040	2478440	I guess I should do more of the raid bosses, but like, I don't know.
2478440	2480600	It doesn't seem like I'm earning XP very fast.
2480600	2481600	Yeah.
2481600	2482600	It's, it's a grind.
2482600	2483600	It really is.
2483600	2486440	I just take over areas as I go places.
2486440	2488960	World bosses, world bosses are the fastest way to do it.
2488960	2493760	Drop, drop the coin, drop the end and try to drive around safely, pull over in parking
2493760	2494760	lots.
2494760	2495760	Okay.
2495760	2498160	And you know, hit every world boss you can in the parking lot, drive to another parking
2498160	2499160	lot, do it again.
2499160	2500160	And same, same.
2500160	2503080	Oh, I, I fight bosses all the time, but it's just nothing.
2503080	2506280	I mean, it just doesn't seem to be making a dent.
2506280	2507280	Yeah.
2507280	2508280	It's tough stuff.
2508320	2509320	All right.
2509320	2513560	Do, liberally run those coins and XP boosts because if, especially because you probably
2513560	2516440	have hundreds of them in your inventory, there's no need to do every time.
2516440	2520920	Every time I play for like any given amount of time, I will do that and I'll do the raids
2520920	2522200	and or the gauntlets.
2522200	2528040	Um, a lot of times I've been doing like the, uh, endless gauntlets and stuff to, you know,
2528040	2530680	earn some more stuff or I'll do the boss only ones.
2530680	2531680	Yep.
2531680	2532680	Um, it's just nothing.
2532680	2534680	It doesn't make a grind.
2534680	2535680	It's a grind.
2535680	2536680	All right.
2536680	2540120	Uh, so, okay, then if that's it for your gaming week, I'll talk about my gaming week, which
2540120	2542840	has, um, um, not a lot of new stuff this week.
2542840	2547240	I've been continuing on in Final Fantasy 14 a little bit, except all of my buddies who
2547240	2551360	play Final Fantasy 14 have kind of fallen off the wagon a little bit as they're, they're
2551360	2552660	playing other games.
2552660	2557600	So I really only get on, pardon me, to do like an expert or something a couple of times
2557600	2560000	and there's not a lot else for me to do.
2560000	2565200	Although I do need to run that new near raid again, I'll probably do it tomorrow, uh, run
2565200	2567320	them all to get my coins, to get upgrades.
2567320	2571380	Um, there's a big, uh, Final Fantasy 14 fan event coming up in a couple of weeks and they
2571380	2573720	just released the schedule for the fan event.
2573720	2578420	And man, this is where worldwide events stink because like the keynote, I think it's from
2578420	2582940	like eight to 10, but no, maybe it was earlier, but it was like six to eight Pacific, which
2582940	2584080	is fine.
2584080	2586180	But then the programming goes all night long.
2586180	2590760	And if you want to see the concert, guess when the concert airs two AM to three 50 Pacific
2590760	2593240	time, I'm not gonna be awake for that.
2593280	2596040	Nobody on the East coast is going to be awake for that unless you're a diehard Final Fantasy
2596040	2598580	fanning, 14 fanning to stay up all night.
2598580	2603800	So hopefully they let us watch that stuff on demand and I can see it later, but the
2603800	2606440	keynote's the most important part because that's where all the news will be.
2606440	2610900	So, um, Ooh, if they let us co-stream that again, maybe there'll be another, uh, reaction
2610900	2611960	thing we'll do here at VOG.
2611960	2612960	We'll see.
2612960	2616760	Um, Bob coffee and chat says it must be running on JST.
2616760	2617760	Absolutely.
2617760	2626160	I think they were going to, at one point, uh, invite a few fans to act and not like
2626160	2631040	a ton, but just a few to feel like, uh, you know, to, to safely fill a small room and
2631040	2632820	do the presentation, do everything that way.
2632820	2634320	I think don't quote me on this.
2634320	2639240	I think they've had to, or they are calling that off because unfortunately Japan is, uh,
2639240	2640880	regressing a little bit on the COVID thing.
2640880	2643800	So I don't think, um, that is all happening in person after all.
2643800	2647060	I think it's going to be similar to their event, um, a few weeks ago where it's going
2647060	2650740	to be a very awkward, empty room, but that's just what it is right now.
2650740	2651740	So you're laughing.
2651740	2652740	Loki.
2652740	2653740	What's a damn funny.
2653740	2654740	Nothing.
2654740	2655740	Okay.
2655740	2656740	Read some stuff.
2656740	2657740	All right.
2657740	2658740	That's fine.
2658740	2659740	I was like, COVID is not funny.
2659740	2660740	Don't laugh at that.
2660740	2661740	All right.
2661740	2662740	Okay.
2662740	2663740	Moving on.
2663740	2668940	Um, other things in my gaming week, um, I've also been playing the mobile games, uh, ingress
2668940	2671860	and Pokemon go, um, not a lot notable.
2671860	2677380	I was really irritated with that Pokemon go event yesterday because, um, Alan and I
2677380	2678380	have been looking at houses.
2678380	2681740	I haven't really made that a secret on the show is that we're looking to buy finally
2681740	2686440	after all these years, as is everyone in this area, did you know, this is the hottest real
2686440	2688700	estate market in the entire nation right now.
2688700	2689700	It's disgusting.
2689700	2693420	Um, so yeah, we have a, we have a lot to deal with right now.
2693420	2697980	Um, so, uh, but anyway, um, we, we've been doing all that.
2697980	2704940	And so, um, I, uh, missed like the first hour and a half of that Pokemon event on Saturday.
2704940	2710780	Um, thank God the collection event was really easy, uh, because I was able to finish it
2710780	2714540	after all, or I would have broken my perfect streak and I would have been really upset
2714540	2715540	about that.
2715540	2717900	So, um, just something to state there.
2717900	2718900	So, uh, yeah.
2718900	2724860	As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, yeah, the 11 AM to 2 PM was too short for that event.
2724860	2727300	It really was community days are six hours long.
2727300	2728780	Why wasn't it at least that long?
2728780	2730540	That was a little ridiculous to me.
2730540	2731780	I still been playing Ingress.
2731780	2734900	They've been doing events and that one too, like they're running a event right now for
2734900	2739740	like the week where they, they have changed one of the core game mechanics, which is very
2739740	2744460	interesting to me currently now in the game for the next week, you can throw a field under
2744460	2748740	an existing field, which probably doesn't make sense to people who don't play the game.
2748740	2754340	But um, part of it is you, you link point, you link pokey stops their version of it together
2754340	2757060	to make fields for your team's color.
2757060	2761500	And a core thing in the game is that links can't cross and you can't field under an existing
2761500	2762500	field.
2762500	2763500	You have to take the field down to field.
2763500	2767140	Um, and that's the, so one of those rules, they're changing up this week, so that's kind
2767140	2768140	of interesting.
2768140	2771580	Um, but also there's a huge boost in AP or experience.
2771580	2776140	Um, and so I've been trying to get like 30 minutes of exercise every day.
2776140	2779700	So I'll just go out, play that, do some like, I walked downtown the other day and just did
2779700	2784100	what I call micro fielding where you just, just hack all the portals, link, just try
2784140	2788500	to, you know, field very small areas of downtown and get tons of stuff that way.
2788500	2792060	And I was at the college campus the other day and I'll probably go somewhere else tomorrow,
2792060	2794100	uh, and, and keep up with that throughout the event.
2794100	2795620	So there's been that.
2795620	2800820	Um, and then, uh, the other thing I've been playing this week of course is dead by daylight,
2800820	2805140	but here's, here's the part where I'm sure y'all are going to laugh.
2805140	2810980	I bought dead by daylight on steam, even after I'd invested all that time in my Xbox one
2810980	2811980	version.
2812020	2816220	Finally, those things that came up last week where I'm like, I need to be able to turn
2816220	2819380	around quickly and use keyboard and mouse and all this stuff.
2819380	2822140	I finally broke down and bought it on PC on steam.
2822140	2823220	I had to have it that way.
2823220	2830620	Now before you, oh yes, oh God, I, I've felt my gameplay improved tremendously with the
2830620	2833180	monitor right in front of my face as opposed to the TV.
2833180	2837580	I'm seeing more the headphones, which I don't have for my Xbox one.
2837660	2842940	Um, I'm able to, um, hear more and that game is very important on sound cues.
2842940	2845340	I didn't realize, especially if you play spirit.
2845340	2846020	Oh my God.
2846020	2846540	Well, yeah.
2846540	2850380	And even just playing the killer, you've got to be able to hear the coughing and the, you
2850380	2851900	know, crying and stuff.
2851900	2856300	And, uh, I think for survivor to some point to, um, uh, sound is very important.
2856300	2862220	I'm really tempted to try to, to see if I can find Strider, um, to, to have teachable
2862220	2867500	soon, but just for that reason, that's one thing, one good thing about, about plague
2867500	2870460	is that you can hear people retching when you vomited on them.
2871180	2871420	Yeah.
2871420	2874220	So there, yeah, there's a lot of important sound stuff in the game.
2874220	2879900	Now, before you all give me crap about buying a game multiple times, ha ha, guess what?
2879900	2886140	This is the first time I've bought dead by daylight because Xbox game pass allowed me
2886140	2888220	to play it on Xbox one.
2888220	2890460	And I had played a little bit on windows game store.
2890460	2894860	I opted for steam because I was told, uh, and, uh, found out around the internet windows
2894860	2897100	game store never has sales.
2897100	2897420	Never.
2897980	2899420	So, um, I bought it on steam.
2899980	2902780	So, um, this is actually the first time I bought the game.
2902780	2905340	Unfortunately, the DLC is the stuff.
2905340	2905660	Thank you.
2905660	2907580	I thank God I didn't buy a lot of it.
2907580	2911820	Uh, and that, um, my, uh, my, my murder sister, dark Sakura kind of hooked me up with a lot
2911820	2912380	of it.
2912380	2917580	Um, so, um, it doesn't, it doesn't feel like as big a loss and someday they will implement
2917580	2922300	the cross purchase and I'll be able to get all the stats back, but we'll, uh, we'll see.
2922860	2931580	So, yeah, I know, um, actually for, for, uh, behavior's website, um, you, um, I don't know
2931580	2937180	if they have any kind of link through Xbox, but they do have a stadia and a steam link.
2937180	2937500	They do.
2937500	2940300	And it does not include windows store or anything else yet.
2940300	2941660	Although they say it's kind of sucks.
2941660	2945660	And to clarify, I'm sorry, DJ Roma S says the Microsoft store does have a lot of sales,
2945660	2947260	but they don't advertise it as well.
2947260	2947820	I'm sorry.
2947820	2949420	I may have misstated what I said.
2949420	2950220	Yes, that is true.
2950220	2953900	And the Xbox, uh, market front does a lot as well.
2953900	2959180	Um, specifically dead by daylight is, uh, you go on the Reddit and thing like that.
2959180	2962700	And people will say they never have sales on dead by daylight or the characters in the
2962700	2963580	windows store.
2963580	2966540	So, um, I just opted to get it on steam, whatever.
2966540	2971660	Um, cause steam was having also steam was having a half off sale on the game itself
2971660	2972300	anyway.
2972300	2974460	So that made me kind of pull the trigger on that.
2974460	2979260	So stadia is I think also having a sale though on the gold version of the game.
2979260	2979740	Oh, nice.
2980300	2981580	Like 36 bucks.
2981580	2982080	Yeah.
2982780	2987580	I, I did, I re-bought pyramid head because of course I think I will be a pyramid head
2987580	2988940	main when all is said and done.
2988940	2993980	And, uh, I did buy Bubba or leather face, which I didn't even have on Xbox one just
2993980	2996940	because I'm like, I need to get that perk and why not?
2996940	2998700	I'll have this killer in my repertoire.
2998700	3001020	Um, and I've been playing mostly Bubba.
3001020	3005020	Um, I, I don't like his talent at all.
3005020	3006940	Like I think the chainsaw thing is kind of crap.
3007580	3009980	It's nice for getting through pallets quickly.
3010300	3013820	But he is what a lot of the streamers would call an M1 killer.
3013820	3017820	Meaning you use your mouse, you use your mouse button one and that's about it.
3017820	3018780	So anyway.
3018780	3020700	All right, enough about that.
3020700	3025980	Let's get into some other gaming news and talk about what else is going on in the industry.
3025980	3029740	Uh, bonds double 06 is also pointing out the store have sales.
3029740	3031100	They don't promote it.
3031100	3034780	Well, if a tree falls in the woods and no one's around to hear it, does it really make
3034780	3035280	a sound?
3035840	3039840	I guess to use a, to use a very old antiquated analogy.
3039840	3040340	All right.
3041200	3043760	Uh, let's get into some other news space.
3043760	3045280	Can no one actually hear you scream?
3046720	3047520	All right, Loki.
3048640	3055440	So we talked about how Sony was planning on getting rid of the PlayStation three and Vita
3055440	3059360	storefronts, and that was making people upset, of course.
3059360	3067680	So thankfully Sony has decided that it's going to, uh, hold off on shutting those down.
3067680	3071840	So basically upon further reflection is clear that we made the wrong decision here.
3071840	3076320	So I'm happy to say we'll be keeping the PlayStation store, uh, operational for PlayStation
3076320	3078800	three and PlayStation Vita devices.
3078800	3082400	PSP commerce functionality will retire on July 2nd.
3083360	3088880	So sorry, PSP, but you know, all your batteries are probably bloated anyways, and none of
3088880	3093040	those devices work anymore, but at least the Vita and the PlayStation three though,
3093040	3094720	those would be, uh, prolonged.
3094720	3097440	A lot of the PSP content is on the Vita store.
3097440	3098560	Am I correct in that?
3098560	3103120	Like, cause yeah, cause you can get those, you can get the PSP games for the Vita.
3103120	3107280	So I have a digital version of that final fantasy four PSP, which is the greatest version
3107280	3110960	of that game that I bought on the Vita marketplace because it went on sale at some point for
3110960	3112240	like 14 bucks or something.
3112240	3113920	So I bought it like years ago.
3113920	3116160	So the Vita still has a lot of the PSP content.
3116160	3120320	And I think that's why you're not hearing this little footnote as much.
3120320	3125360	Plus maybe people are just a little more willing to let the PSP go because how old is that
3125360	3125840	thing now?
3125840	3127120	Like 14 years old, probably.
3127760	3129040	It's pretty old.
3129040	3129520	Yeah.
3129520	3129920	Yeah.
3129920	3132560	So, um, too bad.
3132560	3134480	You know, I really wish they would do another handheld.
3135120	3136000	I know.
3136000	3136240	Right.
3136240	3137680	It wasn't so bad.
3137680	3142560	Like Vita was trying to do some things that it probably didn't need to do.
3142560	3143840	Like the back touch panel.
3143840	3144320	Really?
3144320	3145840	I don't think we really needed that.
3146320	3149280	But like it, it was solid.
3149280	3153600	I thought the Vita just had some weird shit.
3153600	3154560	The V that's what I did.
3154560	3155840	The Vita had some weird shit.
3155840	3160880	It was the, not just the back touch panel, but things like near like no one could, I
3160880	3164800	think to this day, you still can't explain how that actually worked.
3164800	3169520	Whereas Nintendo did a much better job explaining street pass and those types of things.
3169520	3174720	And especially with how big portable gaming is in Japan, which is only further approved
3174720	3177120	by how hot cakes the switches over there.
3177120	3181280	I am really surprised Sony's never tried to do another handheld and I'm surprised they
3181280	3184720	gave up on the Vita as fast as they did, at least here in the US.
3184720	3186880	That was just kind of, I don't know.
3187920	3191520	But I suppose, you know, this is, this is a topic that, you know, is five years old
3191520	3192400	at this point.
3192400	3195040	Um, it's, it's, it is what it is.
3196080	3198320	Are we surprised though that Sony reversed course?
3198320	3201680	I have to admit, I'm a little surprised they reverse course.
3202400	3204480	And I'm not, I know this sounds weird.
3204480	3206080	I'm not exactly sure why they did it.
3207280	3209920	Like, here's the crazy thing.
3209920	3215680	And I know you're probably, you, you are probably all going, Rob, didn't you just last week
3215680	3218800	talk about like the backwards compatibility and how, yes.
3218800	3220000	And that is all still true.
3220000	3224800	And I can still believe that and still sit here and say, I'm kind of surprised Sony backtracked
3224800	3229520	because I'm not sure there's a ton, a ton of people who are going to log into their
3229520	3234240	PlayStation three and Vita's and stuff and start going on a downloading binge and celebration.
3234480	3239120	They might, I don't know what I, and I want to make probably should, I've got like a 500
3239120	3240560	gigabyte hard drive in that.
3240560	3243840	So I should, I should probably fill it up.
3243840	3245680	And, and I want to make my stance clear.
3246240	3251600	I, it, I, I, I, I, and I'm sure it's great that the stores are staying open so that this
3251600	3256000	PlayStation one content and two content and all that stuff is accessible and playable.
3256000	3257040	That is all great.
3257040	3258240	What do I really want?
3258240	3260160	I want that to be playable on PlayStation five.
3260960	3262960	I want my library to go to PlayStation five.
3262960	3269920	That, that, and that is really, you know, and if maybe Sony can cross that bridge, then
3269920	3275680	they can safely probably close these old stores and, you know, they, they won't have quite
3275680	3277600	the same, you know, uh, pushback.
3278240	3282480	If I can play sweet code and one and two on my PlayStation five now, then I don't have
3282480	3284560	to worry about the PlayStation three version.
3284560	3285520	That makes sense.
3285520	3287680	That's where that really comes down to.
3287680	3290080	So, um, let's see.
3290080	3294560	SG100 Matt points out the Vita was just getting into doing some good remote play, which would
3294560	3295760	have been cool in this era.
3295760	3296720	Absolutely.
3296720	3303920	I, the, how quickly Sony abandoned the Vita TV thing blows my mind.
3304640	3308320	Absolutely blows my mind how fast they abandoned that PlayStation TV.
3308320	3309680	I wish I knew where mine was.
3310480	3311760	I have one somewhere.
3311760	3313040	I just don't know where it is.
3313520	3319840	I honestly, if they're going to keep these stores open, Sony should really consider putting
3319840	3320640	that back out.
3321200	3327120	I know that sounds ridiculous, but you know, with, with the Chrome cast, the Apple TVs,
3327120	3331600	the Roku's and all this stuff of the world, there is a place for, there's a place for
3331600	3332880	PlayStation TV in there.
3333920	3334560	I don't get it.
3335760	3339600	I don't, but that was the time to jailbreak those systems too.
3339600	3344080	I guess not that that's what Sony, not that that is going to be incentive for Sony to
3344080	3349920	put those back out, but you know, I, I, it just blows my mind.
3349920	3355440	They could have done a classic thing for PlayStation one on a Vita TV for it.
3356400	3359520	Anyway, it's just not going to make sense.
3359520	3364880	Well, let's talk about PlayStation decisions that I think do make a little more sense because
3364880	3367920	I feel like this one came up on the show previously.
3367920	3372560	And it's something being tested called the PlayStation plus video pass.
3373120	3378560	Apparently this was posted on Sony's website, but it was posted in another country.
3378560	3384080	I think it was, was it the, this particular story I'm looking at?
3384080	3385360	Doesn't say where.
3385360	3389760	So I really looked at the wrong story here, but I believe it was the Polish store.
3391760	3392480	Yes, thank you.
3392480	3392720	Okay.
3392720	3398320	It was the Polish store that said, um, a new benefit is available for a limited time on
3398320	3404400	PlayStation plus PlayStation plus video pass is a trial service that will be active.
3404400	3406640	Uh, and it was really quick, I think for, for a year.
3406640	3413280	So April 22nd, 2021 through 2022, this is a benefit available to PlayStation plus users
3413280	3414400	in Poland.
3414400	3417120	Now Sony interactive entertainment did confirm.
3417120	3418720	This is something they're testing in Poland.
3418720	3421520	So this is not a rumor at this point when this was first reported.
3421520	3423920	This was a rumor leaked website.
3423920	3425760	No, Sony has confirmed it.
3425760	3431040	Um, this will allow PlayStation four and PlayStation five users in Poland, which is their test
3431040	3437520	market to access over 20 movie and television shows from Sony pictures as part of PlayStation
3437520	3441840	plus subscriptions with more content that they're going to add every three months.
3441840	3446960	And if you actually look at a screenshot from the Polish website for PlayStation, you see
3446960	3452640	zombie land, double tap venom, you know, and other things that are related to Sony.
3452640	3459120	Uh, so a way to, um, I guess increase, uh, the, the value of being a PlayStation plus
3459120	3459840	member.
3459840	3463840	And to this, I say this makes an awful lot of sense.
3463840	3466080	In fact, I, I, so correct me if I'm wrong.
3467040	3471360	Didn't we bring this up on the show a few months ago about how could Sony compete more
3471360	3472480	with game pass?
3472480	3477360	And I swear I said, or one of us said, Sony is also a movie company.
3477360	3478560	Why aren't they leveraging that?
3479200	3479920	Well, guess what?
3480960	3485600	Here that plan apparently was in the works and here they are, they are leveraging that
3485600	3486240	side of things.
3486800	3488560	Now, let me ask this question.
3488560	3489760	Does it matter?
3489760	3493440	I asked that to our chatters over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
3493440	3494720	I asked that to my cohost.
3495360	3498800	How does free movies from Sony entertainment?
3498800	3501280	Does that sweeten the pot a little bit?
3501280	3505440	Loki, let's start with, you know, not really because, and it's just because I have so many
3505440	3507440	streaming services I subscribed to already.
3507440	3511840	Like for example, venom is supposed to be on a dizzy plus here pretty soon.
3511840	3516480	Um, it's nice to have something else in there though.
3516480	3517200	Like it would be cool.
3517200	3521280	Like if they just said, Hey, you get, you know, these two games for the month of like
3521280	3526160	may and you get this movie, you know, added to your library and you get an increasingly
3526160	3530880	large library of movies and games, then yes, that would seem like it's sweetening the pot,
3530880	3536640	but also at the same time, I don't really care because I, there's not anything that
3536640	3541840	like, I need to go back and see what they need to do is they just need to offer this
3541840	3546640	stuff so that it's more like, they need the, they need to drop the price of those movies
3546640	3552640	down, um, to the point where it's just kind of like a, you know, impulse buy.
3552640	3556880	And so people can build libraries like they have on steam where it's just like these large
3556880	3561040	libraries of things that no one plays, but then you can acquire all these movies as well.
3561600	3563200	Um, that might be cool.
3563920	3564240	Okay.
3564800	3567760	Uh, looking in chat as some responses there, and then I'll ask dark soccer.
3567760	3572640	Um, so, uh, bonds double six is talking about you're right with their music, film and games,
3572640	3575600	crunchy roll and funimation bundle it into the monthly sub.
3575600	3578960	You can go from playing a game to anime on the same system and so forth.
3578960	3581120	Pele Hanumea says could be cool.
3581120	3584480	Uh, DJ Rama S is also bringing up the anime streaming services.
3584480	3586640	It could sweeten the pot, but meh.
3586640	3588960	Uh, act deaf says more bang for your buck.
3588960	3593840	Uh, SJ100 Matt pointing out that Sony and Disney has that, have that new deal for Spider-Man
3593840	3596880	and other Marvel to be shared on their respective services.
3596880	3598960	That was a thing that just came up this week.
3598960	3602240	And you got to wonder, is there something with the timing there?
3602240	3603360	Hmm.
3603360	3607840	Uh, Quest Buster says, I guess we'll see if it matters in a year if they stick to it.
3607840	3610480	That's how long they will be testing this in Poland.
3610480	3614800	Um, I, I, I feel like the test is actually a lot shorter than that.
3615520	3617040	Yeah, I read the website.
3617040	3618400	I saw what it said.
3618400	3622880	I feel like if this is going to happen, we're going to hear about it at E3.
3622880	3625760	Well, Sony doesn't do E3, but you guys know what I mean.
3625760	3630960	That time frame, whatever Sony's E3 equivalent is, we're going to hear more about this if
3630960	3632800	they plan to expand it beyond Poland.
3632800	3633760	And I think they will.
3633760	3635040	Why wouldn't they?
3635040	3637520	It maybe it's a technical thing.
3637520	3639360	Maybe that's what they're kind of also testing in Poland.
3639360	3640080	I don't know.
3640080	3642240	Um, but I really feel like they will.
3642800	3649600	Um, Bonds 006 also elaborates saying Sony is sitting, Sony is sitting on film, TV shows,
3649600	3650800	music games, and anime.
3650800	3652560	Bundle it into the current sub they have.
3652560	3655760	PlayStation Plus price it less than Microsoft.
3655760	3658560	DJ Rama is suggesting they call it the Sony pass.
3658560	3662800	SSJ100 Matt says, I think the pandemic spread this process up.
3662800	3665840	Quest Buster says the E3 bombshell is prepping.
3665840	3667600	I don't know if I call this a bombshell.
3667600	3672880	It's a bombshell if there's more to it that makes it more competitive with game pass.
3672880	3675680	Like maybe there's another side of this we're not seeing yet.
3675680	3679600	And those rumors that Sony is cooking up something to really compete with game pass.
3679600	3683200	I'm not talking about PlayStation now, but to really compete with it on that same level.
3683200	3687280	If that all drops at once, then that's a bombshell in my opinion.
3687280	3691360	But the movies in PlayStation Plus is just kind of a, oh, neat.
3692240	3693680	I don't know if I call that a bombshell.
3693680	3695040	I'd call that a firework.
3695040	3699360	It's pretty dark soccer.
3699360	3700800	I wanted to get your opinion.
3700800	3705600	Do movies sweeten the pot of these game subscription services like PlayStation Plus?
3708560	3709600	You're muted, by the way.
3709600	3710240	Dark soccer.
3710240	3710960	I can't hear you.
3710960	3711460	Sorry.
3713040	3714960	And she's fixing that crap.
3714960	3715520	That's okay.
3715520	3715760	Hi.
3715760	3718240	I was like, yeah, it's neat.
3718800	3723840	I don't really feel one way or another about it.
3724320	3731200	It's still not a service I'm using, but it could attract some people.
3731200	3732000	There's always that.
3733280	3735600	And if it attracts them, then happy.
3735600	3740080	I would rather see a big package service come in, just like some of the others are saying.
3740640	3744080	So something that invokes the music and the anime and all that as well.
3744960	3745840	Exactly.
3745840	3751120	That would be a little more like, that makes me think of something like Apple's thing.
3751120	3752000	Is it Apple Plus?
3752400	3754240	Apple one.
3754240	3754800	That's it.
3754800	3759200	They bundle it like it's, it's the fitness and the music and the news and all that all
3759200	3761360	in one for like a pretty low price.
3761360	3763600	All things considered when you look at everything individually.
3763600	3768400	So like if Sony were to make a similar move with a Sony one or I don't know what, you
3768400	3768880	know what I mean?
3768880	3770000	Whatever they call it.
3770000	3771120	That would be very interesting.
3771120	3771620	I think.
3772880	3780400	Yeah, no, I, I honestly, I seem to really like having those combination bundles like
3780400	3784240	that, especially if you're giving it, especially something in there, something that people
3784240	3789600	are going to use, you can really, you know, people would get a lot of value out of it
3789600	3795200	if it's got those multiple services, but still, you know, I'm also a fan of having like an
3795200	3797120	individual thing you can subscribe to.
3797120	3801680	Like if you just want the movies, you just want this so that you're not roped into paying
3801680	3805680	for a big thing with only what, you know, that has one out of three services you're
3805680	3806240	going to use.
3806240	3806880	Right.
3806880	3807380	Yeah.
3807920	3808420	All right.
3809760	3810260	Great.
3810560	3814960	Looking one more comment here from Bonds006 in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.
3815600	3821440	Sony can leverage the US market by bringing over the content that was marketed to Asia,
3821440	3823760	India, China, Japan, et cetera.
3824400	3828320	It can go from games, anime, Bollywood, music, films, TV show.
3828320	3830640	The anime audience is very much tied to games.
3830640	3835680	That's a really good thought is that making maybe foreign content more accessible because
3835680	3840000	you're right, there's absolutely an audience that would love to have like a more robust
3840000	3846720	like Bollywood film library or, you know, movies from the like China and other countries
3846720	3848560	in Asia, those places you mentioned.
3848560	3852080	I think that would really appeal to some people.
3852080	3857360	Some people might see that as a niche thing, but I think that's great.
3857360	3863360	You know, there's probably a lot of crossover between like gamers, you know, and folks that
3863360	3866480	would be into some of that more independent and foreign film.
3866480	3867600	So we'll see.
3867600	3868100	Yeah.
3868560	3868880	All right.
3868880	3870320	We'll see what Sony really does.
3870320	3875360	I mean, we can sit here and go, wouldn't this be great with licensing cost?
3875360	3876560	How's it going to get paid for?
3876560	3876720	Right.
3876720	3878080	Movies don't make themselves.
3878080	3879040	So anyway.
3879040	3879680	All right.
3879680	3880160	Moving on.
3881200	3883920	You've got a really timely and interesting thing.
3883920	3885040	Science story, huh?
3886080	3886580	Yeah.
3886880	3889360	When I saw it, I thought it was very, very interesting.
3890400	3895920	There are clinical trial plans for clinical trials to go on to see a video game therapy
3895920	3900560	can help with adults who are suffering from COVID related brain fog.
3902160	3903600	And we know what this condition is.
3903600	3904800	It's the best way to describe it.
3904800	3909760	It's just this confusion and general malaise of the mind of attention, you know?
3911520	3917280	And it's very similar to the therapies that have been used for ADHD treatment in the past.
3917920	3921200	Um, but yeah, there are people who have, uh,
3922320	3929120	who've recovered from COVID who have this residual cognitive and functional, uh, difficulty.
3929840	3934160	So the trial is being conducted by, uh, Weill Cornell medicine.
3934800	3943120	Um, also with a Vanderbilt university medical center, um, to see how effective, uh, a game,
3943200	3951440	uh, called, uh, AKL T zero one, um, on will help patients recover from, uh, this brain fog.
3952000	3956480	Um, they're going to include a hundred patients over the age of 18 who have shown cognitive
3956480	3963680	impairment, um, in at least, uh, one measure of attention and executive function.
3964480	3967120	Um, half will receive treatment.
3967120	3968560	Half will, will be a control group.
3969120	3972640	Um, they are set, they're going to be completing five missions a day,
3972640	3979120	five days a week, and it's about 25 minutes of, uh, game, uh, of gameplay every day.
3979760	3984320	And it will go on for six weeks with four weeks of post-treatment followup.
3985120	3992720	Um, so I think it's pretty, pretty interesting, you know, and I have to say that this brain fog
3992720	4002480	that people are exhibiting after, uh, COVID, uh, infection is very, very similar to what people
4003280	4010560	like me who have ME, um, experience, you know, just with our everyday fatigue.
4010560	4013920	Um, it's just really fascinating.
4013920	4018640	I thought the, um, ADHD, uh, parallel was very interesting too, because I've,
4018640	4021200	I've heard a lot of that defined, defined as brain fog too.
4021680	4025760	I would still, honestly, I kind of would put it a little bit more just from the people I've
4025760	4030400	talked to you who are dealing with it more along the lines of what I have, um, myalgic
4030400	4036080	encephalomyelitis, myelitis, sorry, I always mispronounce that part, um, or chronic fatigue
4036080	4042240	syndrome, where it's not always necessarily a matter of being able to pay attention.
4042240	4048960	It's being fogged out of it, you know, like you're too tired to focus on anything.
4049120	4054080	Yeah. You know, um, these, uh, these long haul kinds of symptoms, this is really going to be
4054080	4059200	interesting to see how, you know, we, we've got the vaccines now and hopefully we're on our way
4059200	4065280	to vastly minimizing COVID. I think it would be, um, a little bit too silly to say something like
4065280	4070880	eradicating COVID. That's not something, yeah, unless you can somehow get the entire planet to
4070880	4073520	take a vaccine at the same time. I don't think it's going to go away.
4074240	4080000	So let's also be real. We've already had one mutation of it. Yeah. Sorry. Two mutations.
4080000	4084960	Oh, more than that. Yeah. Yeah. But anyway, there's two, there's two more active strains
4084960	4090800	out there right now. But my, my point is, is that, you know, even if we get COVID to a manageable
4090800	4095680	level where it really is like a seasonal flu, let's say, you know, and we're dealing with it
4095680	4099600	in similar capacities, we're not having to shut things down because we have a way to kind of get
4099600	4103360	it. I think it's going to be interesting to see kind of the shift turn to how we deal with some
4103360	4108480	of these long haul systems and really treating COVID. There's been a lot of talks about
4108480	4114000	preventing COVID, but we haven't talked a lot about treating COVID and surely scientists are
4114000	4117600	working on that. And they've been working on it since the very beginning. And that's where you
4117600	4122720	had the talks about, you know, that, that drug that, you know, who was saying was the miracle
4122720	4127680	drug and no, but that whole discussion came out of, you know, the, you know, the, you know,
4127840	4133040	but that whole discussion came from treating COVID and how do you do that? And there's going to be
4133040	4138320	more talk like that in the future too. So I just think that's interesting. And also, you know,
4138320	4144480	not just a miracle drug, but therapeutic, you know, a therapeutic kind of treatment like you
4144480	4150080	might have for somebody who has a physical accident or a stroke or something that involves,
4150080	4153280	you know, physical rehabilitation. I think that's very interesting that that is something that
4153280	4157520	they're kind of talking about with COVID. That's what this is. It's this video game therapy is
4157520	4162720	a type of physical rehabilitation. It really is. It's brain training. I mean,
4162720	4167360	really is what this is brain training. Yeah. So very interesting. Very, very interesting.
4167360	4171760	All right. DJ Rama S in chat says, and more people are going out because of the vaccines.
4171760	4177440	Slow down people. Yeah. You got to. Yeah. I mean, today I will, today you got to wear your masks.
4177440	4183680	You still have to minimize content. Today is my full 5g activation day. Yay. It's been two weeks
4183680	4189440	since the second shot, but, um, you're not going to see me running to a crowded bar anytime soon.
4189440	4195440	And when I'm not, I ain't ready for that yet. Um, but I've already, I will, I will like to
4195440	4201040	see my other vaccinated friends as their 5g fully activates and give them a big hug. And that I,
4201040	4206320	that I will be able to do, and that will feel good. Well, and I've just, you know, like for
4206320	4212640	my, my, uh, charity group for the sisters, I've been flat out two weeks. I'm not going to have
4212640	4216160	the meeting with you all for another two weeks. And that's if everybody at that meeting is
4216160	4223360	vaccinated. And I still, I know I mentioned on the last show, right? Allen got scheduled for
4223360	4229200	a shot. So Allen got his first shot this week. So he, he got to join team Pfizer with dark Sakura.
4229200	4233440	So I don't know how that worked out, but, uh, that we have different vaccines in the same household,
4233440	4239760	but whatever he took, he took what they gave him. So that's that. So the countdown is on for that.
4240400	4244000	All right. Anyway, um, let's move on. Let's talk about, uh, our next story,
4244000	4252400	which I believe is Loki's. So Microsoft is, um, went ahead and added that FPS boost
4252400	4259360	to a few more games now. So a lot of these are EA, well, it's actually as to say all EA titles. Um,
4260400	4266080	so now there's about, it looks like 12 new titles that are supporting 120 Hertz.
4266080	4271680	So battlefield for Titan fall, Titan fall to battlefront battlefront two plants versus
4271680	4278560	zombies, garden warfare and garden warfare two, as well as a battle for the neighbor Ville, um,
4278560	4285520	battlefield one battlefield five mirrors edge catalysts and unraveled two. And then for CS
4285520	4292000	solitude, they added 60 Hertz support as well. And that's on the series X and S. So, uh, that's
4292000	4299440	a pretty nice enhancement for those titles. Yeah. Uh, I wonder if that had kind of a priority
4299440	4303440	because they have that agreement with game pass and everything where EA play as a part of game
4303440	4308800	pass. Yeah, I bet. I bet that plays anyway. Yeah. So, and, and we just talked earlier in the show
4308800	4313520	about how increased frame rate, especially for a lot of the type of games that EA likes to make
4314240	4319120	can be very helpful for some people. I'm assuming that a lot of that all probably got, uh, upgraded
4319200	4324160	because it isn't like everything they have run on frostbite anyways. So like making enhancement
4324160	4328800	for one to run at 120 Hertz and you probably apply it to everything kind of like how they did
4328800	4332000	with like backwards compatibility. You get one game to work with that and you can get a bunch
4332000	4337920	of other ones to work. So maybe that was the, you know, maybe that's why, I don't know if everything
4337920	4345440	runs on prospect, but I know a lot of their games run on frostbite. Oh, so it's kind of like they,
4345440	4351040	they made the engine work better essentially. Yeah. I mean, that's why I would think, but
4351040	4356640	no, it makes a lot of sense for Andromeda. Yeah. Right. And I was thinking Mass Effect as well,
4356640	4359760	but they probably don't want to take Andromeda is one thing, but they probably don't want to
4359760	4363120	take away from that remaster coming out. They don't want to be like, Oh, we improved Mass Effect
4363120	4366320	one, two, and three. So don't worry about that remaster. No, no, no, no, no. They want your
4366320	4373840	money. They're doing it on, um, on unreal though. Yeah. Um, I think so. I think it's whatever the
4373840	4379680	old games used. It is. Yeah. So, um, yeah, you're right. They switched to frostbite with, uh,
4379680	4385120	Andromeda. So that's kind of a different thing, I think so. Yeah. But also a lot of those games that
4385120	4390800	Loki mentioned kind of date back to the three 60 era. And I think with, um, you know, Andromeda
4390800	4394560	being a little newer from the Xbox one era, it probably already runs pretty well. And there's
4394560	4400560	not a lot that they can do to it. So there's that. All right. Well, I'll have to check out some of
4400560	4404720	those games. I've been meaning to go back and play garden warfare again. That one's kind of fun.
4404720	4412320	All right. Moving on. Let's talk about, um, this, uh, interesting development in, uh, some former
4412320	4417520	folks that used to be with bungee studios. Uh, of course, you know, bungee is the team that made
4417520	4424480	halo back in the day. Uh, destiny is a big thing that they're working on. Well, uh, firewalk studios
4424480	4430080	is a company that's made up of, uh, or I should say the founders of firewalk studio worked on
4430080	4435520	destiny previously. And it was announced this week that Sony interactive entertainment has picked up
4435520	4440480	the rights to an upcoming game from this studio. Of course, we don't know what it is because this
4440480	4447200	studio hasn't announced anything yet, but this sure seems timed well for June, doesn't it.
4447200	4454080	And an announcement there. Hmm. Anyway, there was a PlayStation blog post and in the blog post,
4454080	4460240	Tony Sue, uh, from firewalk studio, the head of that says for our team, the opportunity to create
4460240	4465120	new worlds and inspire more amazing moments for players around the world is the fire and ambition
4465120	4469840	that keeps us going. The PlayStation team has a deep love and respect for the medium of games
4469840	4474800	and some of the best expertise and capabilities in the world to help make big ambitions a reality.
4474800	4481120	Obviously we have no idea what they're working on. You could assume it's a destiny like game,
4481120	4487760	but then again, you know, take a look at Halo and then take a look at destiny and kind of like how
4487760	4492800	those games like destiny kind of has some of the, like, yes, they're both first person shooters,
4492800	4497200	but they're very different and how they work. So it'd be very interesting to see kind of like
4497200	4502640	what that evolution continues to, uh, with firewalk studios. And of course we're even
4502640	4507440	assuming it will continue to be a first person shooter. I think it's a safe bet. I don't suddenly,
4507440	4513120	Oh, they're going to do an RPG. I, well, destiny has RPG ish elements. Who knows anything's
4513120	4518800	possible, I guess, but I would expect it's going to rely a bit on, uh, probably some of their past
4518800	4524640	expertise. Anyway, the studio was formed in 2018. So they've been working on something for a little
4524640	4531040	while. Um, let's see, uh, uh, Sue is the lead of this. Uh, he was the general manager and
4531040	4536800	senior vice president of destiny, uh, over at Activision, uh, Riley, Ryan, Eli, uh, if I'm
4536800	4540720	saying that right, maybe Eli, sorry for the butchering of the name. There is a game director
4540720	4545840	and was a former bungee creative director, executive producer, Elena Siegman, uh, was
4545840	4550880	a producer on guitar hero two and Bioshock infinite. And then destiny as well. That's
4550880	4556800	quite the diverse resume, isn't it? That's it. Yeah. The cast on that one's pretty impressive.
4556800	4560640	Yeah. So that's, uh, that's pretty cool. So anyway, other people at the studio have worked
4560640	4565280	on things like call of duty, apex legends, mass effect. Apparently they have some folks from there
4565280	4570320	and halo. So we'll see what they come up with. That could be very interesting. I'm hoping,
4570320	4574560	I'm hoping for, uh, the executive producer there to bring some of her guitar,
4574560	4580160	guitar hero to influence. How about a music based destiny game? I'd be into that.
4581520	4587840	Uh, I still never got into destiny. So it's, it's not bad. Like, uh, you know,
4588000	4594320	so I know that's a really whack, uh, recommendation. I don't play a lot of first person shooters. I do
4594320	4598400	get into halo once in a while. Um, there's obviously, you know, dead by daylight, but
4598400	4601920	that's not a shooter, you know, I don't get into a lot of the shooter. Yeah. Yeah. I don't get,
4601920	4607040	unless you play gunslinger. I don't get into a lot of those. I don't get into a harpoon,
4608720	4611920	but you know what I mean? I don't get into a lot of those first person shooter games,
4611920	4616640	but well, I liked overwatch. That's a first person sorta it's, but again, overwatch is
4616640	4620960	really different because there's so many, like you, not everybody actually shoots in that game.
4621680	4626480	If you're playing somebody with a sword or, you know, healing with a, like a Lucio or
4628640	4631440	was Mass Effect multiplayer third person or first person.
4632800	4635600	It was that same over the shoulder that the rest of the game was.
4635600	4639600	Okay. Okay. I couldn't remember for a moment, but I was like,
4640320	4642960	I was just trying to think yet. Didn't I play other first person? Yeah.
4643760	4647680	Yeah. So, Oh yeah, that's true. Sorry. Act says Lucio still shoots. That's right. There's the
4647680	4651920	little gun that, but I think of the healing bubbles and things, but anyway, you guys know
4651920	4657040	what I mean? I don't get into a lot of those games, but destiny for one, it's really pretty
4657040	4660640	now that it's on a series X and I'm sure the PlayStation five version is the same thing.
4660640	4666320	They're both very pretty. I'm sure. Um, and it's, I like it because it does have the light RPG
4666320	4670160	elements in it. It doesn't feel like you're just shooty, shooty, bang, bang, kill them all, kill
4670160	4675120	them all. There's quests to do. There's goals to work towards. There's, I like the idea, the
4675120	4680720	concept of raids in a first person shooter, where you're basically going in into an instance thing
4680720	4685520	with other people and they made it a very PVE experience. I think that's probably the best
4685520	4691280	accolade I could give destiny is that if you don't like first person shooters because of PVP
4691280	4698320	elements, destiny did a really good job making a PVE first person game. The PVP stuff is there too,
4698320	4703360	but the PVE is pretty, pretty top notch in that game. So that's what I would say about destiny.
4704160	4710800	All right. Anyhow, um, let's, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm loving active salty commentary on
4710800	4717280	Overwatch. Uh, Brigitte used to heal. Now she does nothing with all those nerves she got. I see.
4719440	4725440	All right. Uh, moving on, let's get to our next story. Um, oh, this one's an interesting, uh,
4726160	4730000	game thing, dark soccer, another kind of entry story that I think is interesting.
4730960	4741280	For sure. Um, so this actually goes a lot into, um, I would say intellectual property rights.
4741280	4748720	Um, and indeed I did find this on a report about intellectual property. Um, there is, uh,
4749600	4758320	argument now on the use of tattoos in video games. Um, there was a, uh, decision that was made
4758320	4764960	regarding a professional wrestlers tattoos in, um, a video game in one of the, the take to,
4764960	4773840	uh, WWE 2k, uh, games. So basically, um, the wrestler in question is Randy Orton and he's
4773840	4780960	got tattoos that were done by Catherine Alexander. Um, she had inked those, uh,
4780960	4790400	six different ones, um, on him, uh, between 2002 and 2008. Um, so he licensed his likeness,
4790400	4798640	uh, to be used in the game, but she was arguing that, uh, because her artwork wasn't licensed
4798640	4805920	to be used in the game, uh, that they had violated, uh, copyright that they had used her,
4805920	4814400	uh, basically copyright infringement, um, with using unauthorized, uh, uh, artwork with an implied
4814400	4822480	license. Um, well basically, and that is what take two is, is moved for summary judgment. Um,
4822480	4826560	again, that they were authorized to use it by an implied license and that they were using it under
4826560	4838320	fair use. Um, and that, uh, it constitutes a de minimus part of, uh, WWE 2k. Um, so yeah,
4838320	4848480	they had a big, uh, argument over it, um, in court. Um, so with, um, the implied license,
4848480	4856080	the court found that two parts of that were satisfied partially due to conflicting testimony
4856160	4863520	about agreement to forms, copywriting the tattoo. Um, they ruled that that should be heard by a
4863520	4868720	jury. Um, the second defense, the four factors that were necessary to establish fair use is that
4868720	4872400	the purpose and character of the use of the nature of the copyrighted work, the mountain
4872400	4878080	sustainability of the plaintiff's work and the effect of, uh, of the market of the copyrighted
4878080	4888160	work. Um, and so basically, uh, they found that take two did not meet the standard, uh,
4888160	4896800	necessary requirements. And then finally, um, they argued that the, the use of tattoos were,
4896800	4903200	uh, de de minimus, which, um, what de minimus means, uh, it's actually short for a de minimus
4903200	4908480	non current Lex, which is the law does not concern itself with trifles, meaning that it
4909360	4914320	serious. And it is legal term. No, I know it's funny. Yeah. Maybe I should just like,
4914320	4925600	have that tattooed on me. Um, anyway, um, so, um, the, uh, they were unsuccessful in arguing that
4925600	4931200	because it was an open question as to whether the seventh circuit recognized de minimus as a valid
4931200	4938560	defense. And even so, uh, they couldn't see that take two met the standard. So the court's decision
4938560	4943520	was to deny the defense's motion for summary judgment effectively, uh, which effectively
4943520	4954880	means that anyone with a tattoo does not control all use of their likeness. So this is going to be
4954880	4962800	going to jury. Interesting. You know, and I, I can kind of see it both ways. I really can because,
4962800	4967040	you know, I, I kind of get like, if it was her original artwork that she, you know,
4967040	4970880	did specifically for him and now he's out basically reselling it and, you know, having
4970880	4976480	any games and stuff, then I kind of get that. But at the same time, like the dude's on TV,
4976480	4981040	he's a wrestler. I'm sure, you know, a lot of wrestlers end up going to star in movies.
4981040	4985280	If he's in a movie and that tattoo is visible in the movie, does she get money? I don't think
4985280	4991280	that's how it works. Yeah. So it's, it's, but it's fascinating to me. I, and I, I feel like
4991280	4996960	this is something that needs to be established in the tattoo artist who they're tattooing
4996960	5005280	relationship from the get go. And I think because of this case, you may see like this have
5005280	5010320	repercussions for anyone who gets a tattoo. I think it could be very interesting. Brought
5010320	5015200	up a point that I was going to is that I look at it as it's technically commissioned to work.
5016640	5022720	When like me as a graphic designer, if someone commissioned my work or my services,
5023520	5030400	you know, Hey, I would like you to design this banner for my website. The moment I have
5030400	5036400	delivered the artwork, it becomes their property. It is no longer my, I can use my,
5036400	5041600	I can use it in my portfolio. You know, I can certainly use it, but I can't put my name on it.
5042880	5053120	You know, whereas if someone commissioned a painting from me and I painted it, then yeah,
5053120	5059840	I reckon that would be kind of a gray area. You know, that if they were gonna say film in their
5059840	5068320	house and my artwork was there, then I may ask for, you know, a little something because
5068320	5072320	my artwork was seen because as I like to say, artists die of exposure.
5074000	5084400	But at the same time, you know, I would put this right in the range of commissioned work.
5084960	5088720	When you make that commission and you part ways with that commission,
5089440	5095600	that commission is no longer yours. You can put it in your portfolio and tattoo it on other people
5096320	5103600	unless someone else designed that tattoo that you did. Like for example, if I designed a tattoo
5103600	5109680	and I went and had someone put it on, you know, put that on my body, they cannot go and put it
5109680	5116800	on somebody else without paying me for it. That's how it works.
5116800	5121680	What would you say would happen if this wrestler tried to sell the NFT of his tattoo?
5121680	5123360	I'm just kidding. Don't answer that. All right.
5124640	5131600	Oh, I mean, actually, I'll be honest in that case, if he had like a scan of it or something,
5131680	5134880	uh huh. He can't sell that.
5136400	5142560	Okay. Yeah. I think this whole thing is legit. Like jokes, cheap jokes about things that are
5142560	5147440	big in pop culture right now aside, I think it's interesting about the precedent this could
5147440	5153360	actually set again, like for, you know, um, because there's a lot of tattoo artists who
5153360	5156880	are going to be looking at this, I'm sure. And probably never thought about that question
5156880	5161120	because not everyone is necessarily a tattoo artist to the stars, so to speak.
5161120	5164640	But I'm sure there's a lot of tattoo artists going, what if I did tattoo someone famous,
5164640	5169120	like what would happen there where everybody's seeing, you know, what I did. So I think it's
5169120	5171600	going to be very interesting to see what the ramifications of that end up being.
5172240	5178080	What I see is going to happen actually, is that I think that there are going to be, um,
5178960	5185040	when you go to be professionally tattooed, that there's going to be, um, a license paperwork
5185040	5189840	drawn up. You know, and now that I'm sitting here thinking about it, you know, because I always kind
5189840	5193520	of go like, well, why are games being treated different than movies? And, and as I'm sitting
5193520	5196240	here thinking about it, as you're kind of explaining a lot of these things, I think
5196240	5200560	what it really comes down to is that in a movie or whatever you're filming it in a TV show, you're
5200560	5205840	filming it, you got a camera at it. And this is a recreation. Bingo. It's a recreation. It's tracing.
5206800	5211600	You are, you're, you're, you're tracing the tattoo. You know what I mean though? You're basically,
5212560	5219040	you're recreating it. You're making a copy of it. And that's where the very interesting dilemma lies.
5219040	5226640	But it could also be considered derivative work. Yeah. You know, there's also other things under,
5226640	5231440	I think another, they wouldn't have a creative common license on it, but there are like other
5231440	5241920	rules, like having something be more than 50% changed in artwork, for example. Um, but I,
5242880	5249520	I could imagine being a tattoo artist who wants their name out there better, who wants their
5249520	5255760	work protected. I understand it from the artist's point of view, certainly as an artist myself,
5256400	5264960	but I also understand that when the product has left my hand, it belongs to the body that
5264960	5270640	it's on. It doesn't belong off of that body. They can't recreate it themselves to sell it.
5270640	5276240	And so that's, I think, where that murky ground is. I think that I wouldn't be,
5278240	5281840	I don't know. Yeah. Um, let me get some other comments. That is a little bit murky.
5281840	5286720	See a Tiberian chat says, has a tattoo artist done other celebrities? Well, I'm sure there's
5286720	5291120	plenty of celebrities that have had tattoos. Um, has this person also run into other issues
5291120	5295760	before? I think what's happening here is that this is a case where the realism of video games
5295760	5298880	is starting to bring up these issues. You know, think about this is a relatively new
5299760	5304960	This is a relatively newer thing because when we were recreating wrestlers on the Nintendo,
5304960	5309600	on the Super Nintendo, hell, even the PlayStation and kind of the PlayStation 2,
5309600	5316640	the graphical fidelity to recreate the tattoos with such precision and such specificity or
5316640	5323040	whatever specificness didn't, didn't really exist. The tattoo was a pixel. Precision. That's
5323040	5327760	a good way to put it. Thank you. Now that we're talking about PlayStation 4 and 5 and lifelike
5327760	5333280	stuff, I think this, this is why this is coming up now for the first time. It's just interesting.
5335120	5340880	Act Defton chat says, let's say that if it were like all the fan made work you see at
5340880	5345920	artists alleys and conventions, we know it's not legal, but we just ignore it and support the
5345920	5351920	artist. That is very true. Um, that is, well, and here's the thing you have to keep in mind with all
5351920	5356400	that. If you, if that's your business, you know, cool. And yes, we want to support artists and all
5356400	5362320	that stuff. Um, but you have to realize if Blizzard wanted to shut down your Overwatch art,
5362320	5367280	if, or your Warcraft art, or if, um, you know, whatever it is, whatever your fandom is,
5367280	5373520	if they wanted to come in and shut that down, they can. So in a sense, you're living on borrowed time
5373520	5376880	whenever you're incorporating someone else's trademark or copyright, you're right. Most
5376880	5381520	companies let it slip under the radar because it's just, it's, it's too expensive to chase.
5381520	5386960	It doesn't make them look good. This is a case where for the bigger companies exposure, you know,
5386960	5392720	would Overwatch be able to do something like the Overwatch league without the huge fandom that it
5392720	5398800	has. And what's a part of that fandom fan art, right? So I think these companies very carefully
5398800	5403200	have to weigh something like that, but look at a company like Disney to Disney's incredibly,
5403200	5408400	incredibly litigious, but usually if it's something, you know, under the table, again,
5408400	5413600	they're not going to go after a lot of, uh, uh, personal creators and stuff, but they might,
5413600	5417920	and you kind of always have to live with that in the back of your mind, just like most of us that
5417920	5422400	stream on Twitch, you know, what we do here at VOG is a little different because it's pretty much,
5422400	5426960	you know, it's us on camera and all that stuff, but there may come a day for, for things like,
5426960	5431120	let's say dark soccer streaming dead by daylight. There may come a day where behavior comes in and
5431120	5436880	says, you know what? We want the money. And that's, that's a whole, and that thing's been bubbling
5436880	5441920	under for a long time, by the way, that specific example, I believe behavior has openly said,
5441920	5447120	we don't care if you stream it, you know, in that whole thing. But my example of we're living on
5447120	5455840	borrowed time and all that is I think still relevant. So anyway, um, Amethyst Rose, which
5455840	5463120	points out fan art is to a point free advertising. Yeah. Yes. But it is, we are kind of saying,
5463120	5468720	as I said, it's, it's exposure, but it's, it's the inverse because it's now you're trying to
5468720	5473360	support the indie artist, but the big company, they're not going to miss it type of thing.
5473360	5478880	So it's, it's, it's interesting. And I want to be clear. I've bought fan art at stuff. I,
5478880	5484720	I like it as gifts. Like when, um, when Alan was super into Overwatch, I bought him some posters.
5484720	5489600	I think I picked him up at magfest actually that I thought were really cute. Um, and so, you know,
5489600	5493120	I, I love fan art and stuff. I don't want to see that change, but I'm just saying
5493920	5497840	these sorts of legal questions. It kind of brings up all these questions about
5497840	5504880	we might be on borrowed time y'all. Anyway, let's move on to something a little more timeless and
5504880	5511120	talk about retro consoles. Loki. Yeah, this is pretty cool. So, uh, Evercade has been around
5511120	5516560	for a while. It's like this handheld device that plays these cartridges with collections of
5516560	5521040	different retro games. And some indie games, actually, they actually have one that has a
5521040	5526480	bunch of nest maker, any S games in there. So it's pretty cool to kind of, it covers everything.
5526480	5532720	Well, now they're actually doing this new system called the Evercade vs, which is going to be
5532720	5537440	basically taking this portable console and making it into like a home console.
5537440	5542320	So the difference here is that there's going to be two cartridge slots. So now you can have two
5542320	5547040	different cartridges loaded in at a time to select games from they're going to have support
5547040	5554640	up to four controllers and, um, also wifi and 10 AP support as well for your TV. And it's supposed
5554640	5560160	to be coming out later this year to around November for, I think a hundred dollars, not
5560160	5564160	certain about the price on that. Uh, yeah, a hundred dollars. So that's actually about the
5564160	5569040	same price as their handheld was with a few games thrown in, but it's pretty cool. They've got like
5569040	5576640	lots of collections from like Atari and Amco, Data East, all sorts of things. So, um, it's
5576640	5580720	interesting. I don't know if I'm picking it up, but it's definitely, you know, along the lines of
5580720	5587680	like, if you're, you know, looking at console, say kind of like the Amico or something like that,
5587680	5592160	that's playing, you know, more of this couch co-op stuff. You're going to get a lot of that
5592160	5598080	from the Evercade as well. Hmm. That's uh, it sounds like a lot of fun. I like the,
5598080	5602240	I like the homebrew stuff kind of built into it a little bit there. Loki, is that a way to get more
5602240	5606640	copies of a pixel poops out there? You got to get team up one of these consoles. Totally do that.
5606640	5612480	If they wanted to put it on one of those things. I know for example, there's a one cartridge that
5612480	5620560	has, it does have a few different, um, NES home brew stuff. So there's a flea. I know it's one of
5620560	5625440	the games that's made with nest maker. That's in there. There's also the, I'm trying to think of
5625440	5631120	the name now. I have it on itch too. Um, it's basically with a doodle world is another one
5631120	5635360	that they have on there. And I think there was a couple other NES maker games that were part of
5635360	5639120	that. And it was, uh, the, I'm trying to think of the actual collection. It's like something
5639120	5644000	Indies collection that they had, but, um, there's like four games on one cartridge. That's pretty
5644000	5650800	cool. So yeah, I mean, sure. I will put it on one of those collections in a heartbeat.
5651920	5655280	The question, I don't think anyone's going to ask for that. I was going to say there's
5655280	5659440	probably as many people listening to this podcast as bought your game. So, uh, don't
5659440	5663600	hold your breath that Evercade is listening. Yeah, I'm not holding any breath whatsoever,
5663600	5669200	but like, yeah, absolutely. We love all 12 of you who listen. We really do hugs and kisses.
5669200	5673920	All right. Um, pixel pocket is talking about Evercade and chat saying the Evercade portable
5673920	5679040	is pretty fun. I like that their carts always come with five games minimum. There's a mega cat
5679040	5684320	studios cart that has various home brew games. There's also like indie heroes collection.
5684320	5688960	I think that does sound pretty good. I think we reported on this one that they had. Yeah.
5688960	5691920	I think we reported this on this once and I kind of, it kind of fell off my radar,
5691920	5696800	but I think that I love that concept of we're still making cartridges in a new way with the
5696800	5701520	retro stuff. I think that's pretty rad actually. Yeah. And then they've got all sorts of like
5701520	5706400	things in there. There's, um, I'm trying to see the one that they had to actually had all those
5706400	5710800	cool, uh, home brew games. So I think it was, yeah, it was the indie heroes one. So that's
5710800	5717440	the one that has flea. Uh, I believe doodle world's in there. Um, I don't recognize the
5717440	5722400	other games, but I know there's like at least three or four, uh, nest maker games in there.
5722400	5728320	Plus they've got a collection from code masters. Uh, the Atari link stuff is in there. Um,
5729280	5736080	lots of cool stuff. So yeah, I, I, they have like, I think like 280 games on the system right now.
5736080	5742320	So it's, it's definitely, um, interesting. Okay, cool. All right. Uh, let's move on.
5742320	5746160	We've talked about blizzard a lot. Maybe they've been on my mind because I knew this story was
5746160	5751440	coming and this has to do with a pretty big personality over at blizzard leaving the company.
5751440	5755360	Uh, this is not the first time we've had a story like this in the past few months, uh,
5755360	5759440	when it comes to blizzard. However, uh, Jeff Kaplan, who is a very well known, if you,
5759440	5762880	if you've seen his face, you probably go, Oh, that's the guy that is always talking about
5762880	5767440	overwatch. Well, yes, it's because he is the director of overwatch. He's been with blizzard
5767440	5772400	for almost two decades. That's 19 years. Uh, and he announced this week he is leaving blizzard
5772400	5776480	saying, quote, it was truly the honor of a lifetime to have the opportunity to create
5776480	5780960	worlds and heroes for such a passionate audience. Uh, if you want to read his full goodbye note,
5780960	5787120	it is available at play over watch.com. Uh, Aaron Keller will be taking over for Jeff Kaplan.
5787120	5791440	He is also been with blizzard for quite a long time. Uh, they both worked on world of
5791520	5796000	warcraft prior. Uh, and in a statement, Aaron Keller said, Jeff's been a great leader, mentor,
5796000	5799920	and friend, and he knows how much we're going to miss him. I've been lucky to work alongside him
5799920	5803920	and the rest of the overwatch team for many years in building something that continues to inspire
5803920	5809040	people all around the world. And I'm honored to carry the torch for forward. Um, of course,
5809040	5814400	some folks in the overwatch community expressing some concern because you know, overwatch to
5815440	5819440	overwatch itself, hasn't had a lot of updates recently, um, because you know,
5819440	5823680	they're prepping for number two and they've already done a lot of, uh, uh, updates to the
5823680	5829600	base game. Uh, but overwatch two, we know is not coming out in 2021. And so obviously this timing
5829600	5834640	is a little bit, um, concerning to some people. I don't know so much about that because Diablo
5834640	5837760	three went through so many, I think they went through like three different directors and that
5837760	5842320	game still clunking along and doing fine. And Diablo four is, you know, in a good place too.
5842320	5847920	Um, I think the perception of what's happening with this news is just up there goes another
5847920	5852880	Blizzard exec abandoning ship. You know, what the fuck's going on? Activision Blizzard,
5852880	5859040	Activision's ruined the company. There's another one. And the reality is this could be a lot of
5859040	5863200	things. And Bobby went into some good detail on his show tonight. So I'll give him a shout out
5863200	5868000	and a plug, uh, for Bobby Black Wolf, our pal over there in his show. And he went into depth
5868000	5872160	kind of talking about, you know what, this whole COVID thing that a lot of us have been going
5872160	5877840	through have made us reevaluate a lot of things. And one of those big things is where I'm working
5878560	5884240	maybe I want to change that up a little bit. Maybe I'm taking up a new skill while I'm on furlough or
5884240	5888560	layoff from my job. And now I want to use that skill to get a better job. And, you know,
5888560	5892160	different types of companies are hiring and so on and so on. I'm not going to repeat what he said
5892160	5897360	too much, but the more the, the point of that is we don't know what this guy's plans are
5897360	5903600	professionally. And you know what, after you've been at a company for 19 years to want to change
5903600	5912640	it up a little bit is not that unusual, but again, that perception is there. All of these
5912640	5917840	people that have been leaving Blizzard recently were there a very long time. And you would imagine
5917840	5924000	we're very happy, but now here's another one that's gone. So I think a lot of the tea leaves
5924000	5932720	on that will come out in what does he do next? If he goes to another company and starts working on
5932720	5938400	an Overwatch-like game, that's probably a pretty telltale sign something was wrong at Blizzard.
5938400	5944880	But if the dude decides to take a year off to be with his family and go on a nice big vacation,
5944880	5950080	which he is absolutely fucking earned, I'm sure, and I don't even follow Overwatch that closely,
5950080	5955280	as much as many other people do, then I think that will maybe read a different way. Or if he's
5955280	5961280	decided, you know what, after 20 years in the video game industry, I want to paint. Go off,
5961280	5968880	do it, paint. Great. I want to make children's playgrounds. Actually, we say that tongue in
5968880	5976480	cheek, but brilliant example. Why not? Exactly. Yeah. Anyhow, let's see. ActDeft is saying,
5976480	5981120	many people are speculating he's going to Riot to work on one of their projects. Well,
5982480	5987200	that's a little bit fan wanky, but we have seen Blizzard people go to Riot. I remember
5987200	5992160	GhostCrawler, the big community person, had gone to Riot, and there's been others too. So
5992960	6002000	anything's possible, but I wouldn't put too much stock in those sorts of reports yet. Let's see,
6002000	6008320	VGRealness saying, probably gone to Dreamhaven, like the rest who left. Or was that the same
6008320	6014000	studio that Chris Metzen is doing his D&D thing with? Because that one is interesting,
6014000	6018400	because it's not a video game. It's a very, you know, a D&D campaign type thing is a very story
6018400	6022720	heavy type of thing. But that's kind of like what Chris Metzen kind of did at Blizzard. He was very
6022720	6032080	involved in the story of World of Warcraft. So it's interesting, I think. Anyway. Questbuster
6032080	6037120	in chat says, 20 years is a lot of life investment in a company and perhaps he's simply looking to do
6037120	6041760	something new on his own. Take a break, bake a cake, whatever else it might be. A lot of
6041760	6046560	veteran devs in the past few years have left AAA studios to either take sabbaticals or even found
6046560	6051520	smaller teams to find the spark they missed in working with large ones. I think a really good
6051520	6058000	parallel in that regard is Reggie Fils-Aime. He probably didn't need to leave Nintendo. Like,
6058000	6061840	you know what I mean? Like, like he probably, he was doing a great job there. People love him,
6061840	6069680	but he just decided, this is my time. And I want to go be with the family and stuff. And maybe I'll
6069680	6074640	take on a little advisory role that lasts for nine months over a year, or I'll do another little
6074640	6080080	thing over a year, you know, and that's, that's what he wants to do. And he's earned it. I think
6080080	6083760	it's, you know, it's, it's, it's a little tough for the Overwatch community because Jeff Kaplan
6083760	6090240	is such the face for Overwatch and so much so that he's participated in gags, you know, like the,
6090240	6095040	the Yule Log Christmas, whatever that old joke was. I think he sat in front of a fireplace for
6095040	6099600	like six hours on a Twitch stream or whatever the hell he was doing. We don't know this new
6099600	6104480	guy as much, you know, and there's always, there's always that, you know, what's the new,
6104480	6110400	is this new? What's, I don't like new. I liked old. I already dislike new. We don't know what
6110400	6114240	this new person's going to bring to the table. I'm sure we've seen him before at panels and,
6114240	6118400	you know, other things, but he's just not so much the face. So it'll be interesting to see,
6119040	6123040	you know, how, how that all works out, but I'm sure the guy will do fine. He's been with Blizzard
6123040	6132320	a very long time as well. So let's see. Amethyst Rose Witch says, hell, 10 years is a lot. I know
6132320	6137920	I'm reevaluating. I think they say something like it's, it's kind of average to want to change that
6137920	6141680	up every 10 years or so. I don't remember the exact number. Don't quote me on that.
6141680	6146560	But yeah, I know people that change. It seems, I know this one person I used to work with. I feel
6146560	6152160	like she changes every year, but you know what, if, if you could do it and you're successful at it,
6152160	6158320	one, and you're happy, it ain't my place to tell you what to do. Okay. VG realness says every seven
6158320	6162720	years is the average. Okay. I, I, and I thought I remember reading something like that somewhere.
6162720	6167040	And I think, don't they also say like in your life, you kind of go through big changes every
6167040	6175040	seven years. Yeah. And here I am by the way, sitting at 42, which is, which is seven times
6175040	6179760	six, by the way. And we're looking at finally buying a house after all these years, which is
6179760	6183840	a pretty big change of sorts. And I'm sure there'll be other stuff as well. So anyway,
6185200	6191680	maybe there's something to that. I don't know. All right. But the more things change, the more we
6191680	6196720	appreciate the classics. And that's why we have this segment called the classic game of the week,
6196720	6202000	where every week dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,
6202000	6208320	Hey, you guys should be checking out this classic or actually what really happens in this segment
6208320	6212160	sometimes. Cause I think that's, what's going to happen to us tonight is that sometimes it's like
6212160	6217520	that meme that you've seen online, what you thought final fantasy was 20 years ago, where
6217520	6223360	it shows the retro final fantasy. And then what final fantasy really was 20 years ago. And then
6223360	6228960	you see the picture of final fantasy 10 on the PlayStation two with, you know, all it's a great
6228960	6234720	graphics and everything. Um, because the criteria that dark soccer created, cause you know, she
6234720	6240320	writes the rules is that a game has to be 10 years old or more to be a classic game of the week.
6240320	6245120	And this is definitely one of those games when, when I was, you know, cause you know, I I'm,
6245120	6248960	I'm special. I get to see what she picked in advance. And when I saw it, I was like,
6248960	6253200	Oh my God, this is 10 years old. Really? And I had a final fantasy just for that reason.
6253200	6259120	I had a final fantasy meme moment. It's a good one, but y'all get ready to feel old.
6259120	6265600	I'm going to warn you. All right. Dark soccer. No, my pain. What are you going to, uh, what are
6265600	6274480	you going to make the audience cry with tonight? The classic game of the week came out in 2011
6275120	6285040	and it's called limbo. Yes. Limbo. Um, it is a very beautiful stylized puzzle platform
6285040	6290640	game that was developed by an independent studio called play dead. It was released actually in July
6290640	6297520	2010 on Xbox live arcade and has been ported around to other systems, including PS3, Linux
6297520	6303040	and windows. It is a 2d site, huh? I'm sorry. I hate to interrupt, but you need to, I felt you
6303040	6308240	could celebrate in some of the tears that you're causing in chat. You ready? We have, wow. I feel
6308240	6315760	old. Wow. I'm so old. When we was a weave log show. Good Lord. This is that old limbo is eligible.
6315760	6322960	Fuck. So there you go. There you go. Dark soccer. Enjoy your cup of chat room tears.
6324080	6334080	Ah, refreshing here. Mm. Delightful. And podcasts, uh, podcast listeners,
6334080	6339440	we don't want you to be left out. Please send those tears to our Twitter account at OLR,
6339440	6342880	uh, send them directly to dark soccer, water, my green onions.
6344480	6354160	All right. And anyhow, so yes, the game is, uh, limbo. And as I was saying, it's presented in
6354160	6361120	black and white tones, uh, kind of gray scale. And it uses, uh, lighting and film grain effects
6361120	6369760	and very minimal ambient sounds to create this atmosphere of, of almost hopelessness kind of,
6369760	6377600	kind of scary. Um, it's very dark. It's even been, uh, compared to old film noir in German
6377600	6387200	expressionism, which I totally get that vibe out of it. Um, it is, it's also been toted as one of,
6387200	6393840	as an example of video games as an art form, very positive reviews, um, minimalized story
6393840	6400160	that kind of split people, but otherwise it's been just considered one of the greatest games
6400160	6409360	of all time. Um, it was also the third highest selling game on Xbox live arcade in 2010. Um,
6409360	6416160	and as one, uh, several industry awards. So, um, to go forward into this. So basically you play
6416160	6424080	a little boy and you have to navigate him through his dark, eerie world. Um, sorry,
6424080	6432400	the cat was chatting about this in the background. Um, so you have to solve these puzzles
6433440	6438560	to kind of get through. So you have hazards like glowing worms that will attach themselves to your
6438560	6443360	head and force you to travel in one direction until they're killed. You also have the mechanical
6443360	6449200	puzzles where you deal with machinery, electromagnets and gravity. Um, you don't
6449200	6455760	notice the traps though until they kill you. And so you restart from your last checkpoint. Um,
6455760	6460400	and you just can keep starting over as far as you go. It's basically a trial and death game
6460400	6467680	and you can die with dismemberment or beheading or some gore. Um, you know, there are some,
6467680	6474800	there's an optional gore filter if you don't want to see it. Um, but yeah, there's carcasses
6474800	6481440	and bear traps and all kinds of stuff. Um, so basically the story of this is that you're this
6481440	6490400	boy who wakes up in a forest on the edge of hell. Um, and you encounter a giant spider who tries to
6490400	6497120	kill you. And then after you cut off the sharp points of, of his legs, then you continue through
6497120	6506720	the story. Um, and then, uh, I'm not going to spoil the ending. Get off of there.
6510160	6514240	You all right over there? My cat was on my art table.
6514240	6518880	Well, your cat was also feeling old. Thanks to this selection. Just letting you know.
6520000	6523040	And it's my fault for leaving the door open. You are a bad girl out.
6524000	6534080	Out. She's going to the closed door to leave like great cat. Anyway. Um, it was, uh, conceived as
6534080	6542400	a game around 2004 with some concept art, um, from, uh, the designer is at IO interactive.
6542960	6551040	Um, he had, as he said, a mood image of a secret place to get ideas. Um, and he expanded upon it.
6551120	6557280	He tried to make his own game and visual basic, but he needed a lot more, uh, assistance with it.
6557280	6564080	So he made an art style trailer in 2006 and tried to recruit people. Um, but he had just two people
6564080	6571360	to start with. So that led to the creation of play dead and they attracted more people and the game
6571360	6581760	has gone on to be beautiful. Um, the ESRB listed entries for, for PS3 and windows, but it was a
6581760	6588000	mistake on their part first. They didn't have any intention of bringing it out. Um, but then, uh,
6589040	6596400	eventually, you know, things happened. Um, they did, they actually didn't want to release on
6596400	6600640	windows because of software piracy. Something they were very worried about.
6601280	6605440	But then again, I guess once they've made their money, you know, limbo.
6607200	6611920	It also out on steam also something, one thing we have to remember about PC games. Um, and by the
6611920	6616560	way, if you don't like spiders, avert your eyes for a little bit because, um, the next part of
6616560	6621520	this game for people who don't like spiders is very, um, rough visually. So I'm going to let it
6621520	6626000	keep playing, but I'm going to warn you if you don't like spiders, don't watch just avert your
6626000	6632080	eyes for a little bit. I'll tell you when it's safe again. Um, and, uh, um, I, I got sidetracked.
6632080	6642560	I'm sorry. I was going to say, um, uh, spiders now before that PC. Oh yes. PC. Thank you.
6642560	6648640	It opens things up to a much larger audience because the PS3 is only officially available
6648640	6652480	in so many places in the world. And I think that's one thing we often forget with PC gaming
6652480	6658000	is that by putting out a game in P on PC, you can get to a lot of countries where console gaming is
6658000	6664640	not readily accessible. That makes sense. Yeah. So, but there are different versions of the game.
6664640	6675600	Of course, there is a Mac OS version, um, through the Mac app store. Um, there, uh, sorry. Um,
6676560	6683600	uh, as I said, there's a Mac OS version. There is a Linux version that plays in a wine, uh,
6683600	6692080	environment, which is a, uh, sort of a windows virtualization. Um, there was a Vita version,
6692080	6698880	um, but it doesn't use the touch pad. Um, there's an iOS version. Um, there's all kinds of versions
6699440	6712480	out there. Um, and it's just really, really just a, a good game. Um, I, I really,
6712480	6718560	really cannot stress, uh, enough about how beautiful the music, the minimalized music,
6718560	6725360	uh, audio and the visuals are in this one. I mean, as you can see, um, but the audio was created by,
6725680	6733520	Martin Stig Anderson, who was a graduate in Royal Academy of Music. Um, and so his specialty being,
6734160	6743280	um, uh, cosmetic music, which is sort of non traditional from created from generated sounds.
6743280	6748640	They don't seem to have any particular source, um, is it came in and it blends in quite beautifully
6748640	6756160	with this, uh, background. Um, but yeah, uh, it got great receptions, very, very highly rated
6756160	6764400	across the board. And, you know, it's just, it's really, I can't really say too much more good
6764400	6769440	about it. It really is excellent. And it's, it's really that, that artistic style and the look of
6769440	6775200	this game. Um, and she whole can chat says it's a great game and sound. Yeah. And I think that that
6775200	6781520	unique style, when this came out, we weren't seeing a lot of games that really looked like,
6781520	6785680	like such a unique style like this, you know what I mean? And I think that's what makes this game
6785680	6789840	very special, even though, like I just said, and I warned y'all that scene that just played out
6789840	6794400	with the spider. Um, that's literally my worst nightmare coming to life. Um, so anyway, I'm
6794400	6799760	going to turn the game footage. The spider is very scary. I did you see, he picked the guy up and
6799760	6804000	wrapped it. I think it's super, I mean, it's not, it's not violent or gory at least, but that, no,
6804000	6809440	I'm, I'm, that is like literally one of my worst nightmares playing out. Yeah, but, but he's free
6809440	6813600	of, of the stuff. He is now happy ending, I suppose. All right. Except for that little piece.
6813600	6817040	I just love that scene though, where like you see his eyes and he's lying on the ground,
6817040	6822240	staring at the camera, like what even is my life? Yeah. All right. I'm going to go back. That's,
6822240	6827600	that's me. I am that little boy right now. All right. There is your classic game of the week.
6827600	6833600	Limbo. Yes. It's 10 years old and you are 10 years older as a result. Congratulations.
6834320	6839840	All right. Great pick. Jamie really is. All right. Thank you. I mean, I'm if when you do a bad pick,
6839840	6845600	I'm just not going to tell you, no, I'm kidding. There's no such thing. No, you have done bad
6845600	6852000	picks, but you've said, I don't always pick a good one. I do it on purpose. Yeah. So they're
6852000	6857440	not always good, but even the bad ones are still classics and you should know about them so that
6857440	6862400	you avoid them. Like they're classic in their own way. You know, show are just classically bad.
6862480	6869520	Showgirls is classic cinema. Pink flamingos is classic cinema, but there, there are reasons for
6869520	6875360	the hell Rocky horror picture show, honestly is not that great of a movie, but the experience,
6875360	6880960	the music, the, the Tim Curry, the, and all of this stuff adds up to like this, you got to see
6880960	6886720	it type of thing, right? Honestly, it is a better stage play than it is a movie. Yes. But, Oh, by the
6886880	6893120	way, I have seen the stage play several times now. Was it rest in peace, um, just passed away this
6893120	6897760	week that was involved with all the meatloaf songs. And I believe played the character and
6897760	6905680	fan of the paradise, which is another huge, uh, is it Jim Steinman? Please don't. I know his face
6905680	6911840	is a very distinctive look, but I don't remember the name. Somebody I'm waiting for chat to shout
6911840	6916400	it out. Okay. See it to very things. I'm Jim Steinman. Was it? No, but no,
6916400	6921360	William Finley was 2012. It was, uh, it was Jim Steinman. Okay. That's what I thought. Okay.
6922000	6927120	Whew. I got that. Right. All right. Anyway. Um, so yeah, rest in peace because the paradise is
6927120	6932320	fucking weird. Oh, that movie just Jessica Harper is such, it's like one of those actresses where
6932320	6938960	if it's like, if you know her, it's like, you're in this secret society of people who know who she
6938960	6944080	is and why she's awesome. Like that whole thing. So anyway, I still need to, to this day, I still
6944080	6951920	need to see Suspiria, which is like one of her all time, like biggest roles. I actually have seen
6951920	6957280	the remake of Suspiria. Oh, okay. And I have the original of Suspiria. If you want to come
6957280	6963280	over and watch it with me, I really enjoyed the remake. Oh my God. That'll be a fun VAX thing.
6963280	6966400	Like now that we're both VAX, we're going to watch movies together. That'll be fun.
6967200	6971600	Yeah. I have to, I have to say though, I need, I want someone to watch Suspiria with me because the,
6971600	6978240	the remake of it was really good. It had Tilda Swanson in it too. Um, but I really,
6978880	6983840	yeah. And I know that Jessica Harper was in the remake very briefly, but, um, but I need,
6983840	6988240	She writes children's books now. And so she's been kind of like, she even has her own podcast.
6988240	6992880	Uh, I may be a limited edition or whatever, but she wrote a book recently and she was doing like
6992880	6997040	tours and she's, she didn't do conventions for a long time, but she's one of those people who's
6997040	7000720	really opened up over the years and does convention, or at least, you know, pre COVID
7000720	7004480	was starting to do more conventions and kind of open up about her past and all that stuff.
7004480	7009040	Pretty approachable. Yeah. I kept trying to get them like little, little inside baseball,
7009040	7013360	but you know, they do that convention here in Sacramento and I'm, I'm in the ear of the person
7013360	7017840	who runs it. And I've been, I've been saying for years, get Jessica Harper, get Jessica Harper,
7017840	7024720	get Jessica Harper. One of the, one of these years it'll work. So, all right. I mean, why not?
7024720	7028000	They got, they got Barry Boswith. They got Patricia Quinn. They got, they've gotten a
7028000	7031600	lot of good people and I'm like, please get Jessica Harper. That's like, who's on your
7031600	7038160	wishlist? Rob Jessica Harper. All right. Anyhow, uh, this is not the Jessica Harper podcast,
7038160	7042160	unfortunately, but, uh, and if you have no idea who we're talking about, you really should educate
7042160	7046560	yourself. Like honestly, like you get joint, join the secret society of fans. Uh, we're,
7046560	7051440	we're small and loyal. All right. Uh, let's move on to some rapid fire news where we talk about
7051440	7056560	the video game industry, not the movie industry really quick. Uh, let's do it. Uh, Loki, why don't
7056560	7064960	you start us off? All right. So, um, this is pretty cool. So on the 10th birthday of Portal 2,
7064960	7071520	yes, now it's eligible for classic game of the week. Um, there's been a fan release,
7071520	7078320	a mod called portal reloaded, which adds a third color portal to the gun. Uh, it's a green one.
7078320	7084160	It actually allows time travel. So that's even more of a mind bender now. So you can go check
7084160	7091360	that out. Um, looks pretty cool. I always like these portal fan games. Uh, speaking of fan
7092000	7097680	additions for games, um, mother three has had a brand new English translation by the fans as well
7097680	7104240	on its 15th anniversary. So that's also available if you're a fan of mother three.
7106080	7109760	Which, um, is a game I really still need to play. Start to finish. I've played a little
7109760	7113680	bit of that translation patch, but I can't believe that game is 15 years old and still nothing.
7114880	7121120	And even Reggie fees and may is joking about it now. Like how dare you? Although obviously
7121120	7125600	this was a decision above his head, I'm sure, you know, even though he's the face of Nintendo,
7125600	7129760	you know, in America to many of us, even still with Doug Bowser there, I mean, even still,
7129760	7134080	um, obviously we know that Japan calls a lot of the shots with that stuff. So, um,
7134080	7138960	one of these days, one of these days, all right. Uh, dark soccer, what do you have for us?
7140080	7145680	A couple of things. Um, there are, uh, there's rumors that, uh,
7145680	7151920	Sony and Konami are in discussions to do a new Castlevania game on the PlayStation five.
7152640	7159760	Um, it came from a leaker called catharsis T. Just saying that they've been talking about it
7159760	7165360	and that they also were having new projects related to metal gear, solid and silent Hill
7165360	7172080	in the works. Um, but of course, rumor speculation, we don't know. Um, but, uh,
7172080	7177040	apparently this person has been correct before. So yeah. And, and we're getting a new silent Hill
7177040	7181520	too. Remember those rumors? So I don't know. It's like, I want to see the receipts,
7181520	7186960	but I understand this is it's what gaming culture is talking about. So we, we do indulge the rumors
7186960	7193040	sometimes. And I think we'd all love to see it. I think we'd all be loved to play a new Castlevania
7193040	7198480	game, but in the meantime, we have bloodstain. It's not bad at all. Yeah. Well, for those of us
7198480	7204800	though, who have already been enjoying Capcom arcade stadium on our switches. Well, the rest
7204800	7214240	of you guys get it too. So, um, it will be available on PS4, Xbox one and PC on, on May 25th.
7214960	7222320	Um, and you can, uh, you get 1943, the battle of Midway for free. Um, you will also get some
7222320	7229520	add on packs. Um, there is Dawn of the arcade pack, um, which is 1984 to 1988 arcade revolution,
7229520	7238880	which is 1989 to 1982, and then arcade evolution, 1992 to 2001. So, uh, in that last pack,
7238880	7244480	that's where we have 1944, the loop master, uh, street fighter, two hyper fighting edition,
7244480	7249040	street fighter, two turbo. That second pack is where we get, um, street fighter to the world
7249040	7254880	warriors, captain commando, Strider and final fight, which is honestly, that's the best pack
7254880	7259200	to get in my opinion. Yeah. I bought them all on. So I'm actually kind of irritated too, cause I
7259200	7262480	would have probably bought it on a different system if I knew, but it's all right. Switch
7263680	7271920	of these games though on like the Sega Saturn Capcom packs. Yeah. So, but I don't know. It's
7271920	7277840	kind of, kind of fun to have them again. Giga wing is certainly, uh, a good one. Cause unless
7277840	7281600	you have a dream cast, I don't think Giga wing didn't really come out on anything else. I don't
7281600	7286240	think it did. They, they, they, the, the stadium is good because it does have deep cuts. I'd call
7286240	7290320	that like a deep cut and they do have some really good deep cuts in there. Um, and they do, you
7290320	7293600	know, they do stuff that the technology wasn't there for with those earlier packs. Like, you
7293600	7298400	know, a little bit of the online competition achievements, weekly things, you know, that you
7298400	7303840	get more skins and cosmetics for doing. I think, I think it's a well done pack and I hope they expand
7303840	7308400	on it with more games. Actually. I would love to see that if possible. Uh, I'd love to see things
7308400	7311680	like puzzle fighter in there, but I don't know if they'd actually do it when they could probably
7311680	7315600	release that as a standalone game, but you could say the same thing about street fighter. And
7315600	7319520	that's still in there. So, or street fighter two, excuse me, but you know what I meant.
7319520	7324560	So it'd be very interesting to see. All right. Uh, let's travel around the world and check out
7324560	7329120	some release dates, things that we'll be playing a little sooner than Capcom arcade on our PlayStation
7329120	7333280	four. Although I guess not too much of a wait. Uh, it's only about a month, but what do we get
7333280	7341040	to play next week? Loki? Uh, we've got death and requests on Nintendo switch, uh, Genshin impact on
7341120	7350800	PlayStation five to hell with it on PC, uh, final two, uh, that's on Nintendo switch,
7350800	7357200	PlayStation four X-Box one X-Box series X, uh, total war Rome remastered on PC, Mac, and Linux.
7357840	7364800	Um, this is exciting new Pokemon snap on Nintendo switch. Oh, that's right. That's the sweet,
7365440	7372720	yeah. Uh, returnal on PlayStation five. Oh, I wanted to see that. I hope my friends stream that
7373440	7379600	also apparently our type final two is coming out again on, um, PlayStation four X-Box one
7379600	7384720	X-Box series X and PC. I don't know why it's coming out twice in the week, but whatever,
7384720	7391520	uh, maybe, I don't know. Um, there's a footnote and I don't want to read it.
7391600	7397920	Uh, let's see. Oh, nobody does. I got it. So, so it's coming out slightly earlier in the week
7397920	7403680	for Japan, North America is getting it later in the week, whatever, uh, terminate resistance
7403680	7412400	enhanced on PlayStation five. And that's it. I need to, I need to recruit Shane for a Pokemon
7412400	7416800	snap stream of sort. Cause I believe I think, didn't he say he's never played the original?
7416800	7420960	Like I thought that was a thing that came up. I did not have played the original. I don't
7420960	7426720	remember if you're listening, Shane, will you correct me or whatever, but I'm almost positive.
7426720	7430160	That was the thing. Like he still hasn't played those games. And so we really need a reaction
7430160	7434560	stream from him. All right. Anyway, moving on, uh, let's go to Japan and check out the
7434560	7439360	releases over there. Uh, we also, we have some similar stuff. We had like the R-type final two
7439360	7444320	is out there as well. Uh, let's see, uh, that is on the switch. Uh, there's also some themed
7444320	7448880	controllers and some peripherals and things like that coming out this week as well. And of course,
7448880	7453040	new Pokemon snap is also getting its release in Japan. I mean, that would be pretty rude if they
7453040	7458080	didn't put that out in Japan at the same time. Uh, there's lots of Sanrio, uh, related, um,
7458080	7461920	like Nintendo switch peripherals and things of that sort as well. So it's pretty big week for
7461920	7467520	that type of stuff. Um, I think that's about it for the switch. Let me look at PlayStation
7467520	7471360	five and PlayStation four. Oh, Returnal has a Japanese release this week on PlayStation
7471360	7475840	five as well. So they're getting it about the same time. That's cool. Um, cause I think that
7475840	7480400	was developed over here. And so Japan sometimes has to wait for those that are developed over
7480400	7485200	here, but not that one. Uh, and then looking at PlayStation four, you have the star renegades and
7485200	7489600	R-type final two also getting their releases in Japan this week. So there you go. How about the
7489600	7499600	UK dark Sakura? A few things on the 29th, we have, uh, world war one, Verdun, um, and Tannenberg,
7499600	7502960	uh, but that's the Western front and Eastern front, both coming out on PS five.
7503520	7510880	Um, also taxi chaos for PS five and switch on the 30th, we have Terminator resistance enhanced
7510880	7518640	on PS five, um, Pokemon snap on a switch battle acts on PlayStation and switch
7518640	7526720	and Returnal on PlayStation. All right. Uh, let us get to some more news stories. And then of
7526720	7531840	course, we'll take your questions, uh, and comments in our chat room over twitch.tv slash
7531840	7536640	VOG network. As we get a little closer to the end of the show. Okay. Shane is saying I'm correct.
7536640	7540960	He has never played Pokemon snap. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna work on this and see what I can do
7540960	7544160	in the meantime. Loki, why don't you get to our next story?
7545040	7549360	Yeah. So we had a rumor a few weeks ago talking about Microsoft possibly,
7549360	7554720	uh, looking to buy discord. Well, that's not going to happen. So apparently all the talks
7554720	7560320	are now off the table and it's that, you know, possible that it could be rekindled in the future,
7560320	7568640	but not yet. So we can all take a nice, uh, relaxing side that, that, that nightmare isn't
7568640	7575040	going to happen. All right. Uh, yeah, that's good. That's good. I don't think a lot of us
7575040	7578240	really wanted to see that happen. I mean, some of us are probably reading into like,
7578240	7581600	Oh, there are some good things that could come out of that, but I think most of us
7581600	7585200	wanted discord to stay independent and it looks like that is, so it looks like all,
7585200	7589440	it's not just Microsoft, but like all the suitors are off the table. Right. If I read that right.
7589440	7592800	And it's just discord is going to go the independent right route. And I think that's
7592800	7598480	the direction most of us wanted to see them take. Yeah. Yeah. So I think that's, uh, that's good
7598480	7608160	news. Yay. All right. Uh, let's move on. Um, okay. This, this story is interesting. Um, and, uh,
7608160	7612000	this is, again, it's one of those things where it's like, it's, it's not the same as it was
7612000	7618560	10 years ago. And I'm talking about the humble bundle, uh, humble bundle, the company, which,
7618560	7624560	uh, is now an IGN company and has been for several years, by the way, um, humble bundle announced,
7624560	7629440	uh, that in may, uh, there are no more, there are no longer going to be sliders, uh, when you buy
7629440	7634000	a bundle. I think most of you have probably bought a humble bundle at some point, but let me remind
7634000	7638880	you. Um, in the early days of humble bundle, they used to do these big indie bundles, right? Where
7638880	7642240	it would be like, I don't know what seven, eight, nine games that they would give away for like a
7642240	7647600	pay what you want. And then they'd throw in an extra game or three, if you'd paid like a minimum,
7647600	7651040	or if you paid like above the average, you know, the little benchmarks would get you a
7651040	7655760	couple more games. And these were widely popular because you'd have a slider at the bottom where
7655760	7659680	you could give all this money to the charity that they were supporting at the time. If it's like
7659680	7663440	doctors that borders or whoever it is they're supporting at the moment, or you could give like
7663440	7669360	maybe 50% to the developers of the games and 50% to charity. And then there was a place where you
7669360	7674000	could leave a humble tip as well. Cause you know, um, bandwidth isn't free, um, and, and putting the
7674000	7676880	site together and all that. So you could leave them a little bit of a tip, but there were a lot
7676880	7680080	of people that would do those bundles and just give a hundred percent of the money to charity.
7680080	7683920	Um, you know, and that's, that's kind of what it was for, you know, you didn't really get a lot of
7683920	7688960	new games in there. You got a lot of indie stuff, but I would say humble bundle was really where
7688960	7695600	this started this whole concept of pay five bucks and get 10 awesome games. Right. And, and was,
7695600	7700080	was really probably one of the biggest things we can blame for our fucking backlogs. Right.
7700640	7705840	It's humble bundle. Am I right? Loki is humble bundle the source of a lot of your backlog?
7707440	7713600	Yeah. I already increased my backlog just today. Oh boy. Um, the VR one.
7713600	7720480	Okay. Um, so, uh, yeah, so, um, things are going to be changing now because, uh, they're no longer
7720480	7725840	going to have those sliders. Um, and, uh, what's going to happen is that you're going to be able
7725840	7732960	to choose preset options that decide how the money is divvied up, but the charity portion
7732960	7743120	is capped at 15%. Meaning the best options for charity donations is 15%. Whereas in the past,
7743120	7746240	most of, a lot of us were giving a hundred percent to charity. And I don't think there's
7746240	7750960	anything wrong with that. Cause that was the whole point of humble bundle. But unfortunately,
7750960	7756240	when we had that news, what four or five years ago at this point that IGN bought them.
7756960	7760960	Well, we all know humble bundles kind of been, they've been a little bit different ever since,
7760960	7765360	right? They're, they're more of a storefront. They, you know, they do these different,
7765360	7769360	they try to sell their humble subscription and all of this, you know, when was the last time
7769360	7773760	that they did an indie bundle that really caught fire the way the old ones did? Well,
7773760	7778560	that's been a while with the subscription though. Like it's not even really subscription per se,
7778560	7782400	cause you don't get automatically charged each month. And it's basically just,
7783600	7788640	it's basically a bundle cause you buy you, you pay the amount and you get like 12 games.
7789440	7793600	So it's, it's, it's kind of weird. You know what they are ahead of time. It's not like,
7793600	7798160	Oh, I'm going to repay this and have it recur every month. And then we'll be surprised with
7798160	7801520	what we get. It's like, cause there's been months I was like, yeah, I'm going to skip it,
7801520	7806720	but I do it and it's a pretty good deal, but okay. It's not, it's hardly a subscription anymore.
7808160	7811520	Now humble bundles said in their post announcing what's happening here,
7811520	7816400	why they're removing the sliders. They want to unify their various services saying since we
7816400	7821280	launched bundles a decade ago, sliders have not changed. Even as humble evolved by building
7821280	7825760	products like humble choice and the humble store that all support charity without sliders.
7826320	7833520	That's a, that's a weird flex to me. Like it's more that they need to keep the company running.
7833520	7837920	They need to keep the lights on. It's, it's, it's what it boils down to. But of course,
7837920	7841920	a lot of people are making jokes about how, well, they're not so humble anymore. Are they,
7841920	7846240	or what was the great one liner that I just saw in chat? Ice P in chat says,
7846240	7852640	might be taken a bit of a humble tumble. That's funny. I like the humble tumbles funny.
7853200	7857600	Blah, blah, blah, blah. So I think there's a lot of us that are taking issue with the fact that
7857600	7861600	they're calling themselves the humble bundle when the charity now seems to be taking a back seat to
7861600	7865840	the other stuff. And like, on one hand, I get it. Like maybe this is how they're going to be able
7865840	7870560	to attract more developers is by basically guaranteeing the developers are going to get
7870560	7875920	a certain minimum and all this, but it, it certainly does feel like, okay, then isn't
7875920	7881360	the humble bundle now just a steam key reseller at this point? Isn't that just what they do?
7882320	7887200	And not just steam key because they do Nintendo stuff too. They have like 3DS that was on there
7887200	7890480	for a little bit as well. And they still do. I still see ads for it where they're,
7890480	7894560	they're using like Mario brothers three in the ad, but that is something that you can,
7894560	7898800	you can buy on the store and redeem on like the 3DS shop and stuff. But essentially they're just
7898800	7905920	a key seller front where a small part goes to charity. Do we care that, I mean, would,
7905920	7911760	would a 15% charity donation change your mind and make you want to shop at humble bundle still?
7912480	7917120	Loki, it sounds like with you. Well, but you said you, well, you said you are on their subscription
7917120	7922880	thing. Yeah, right. I do that. And, um, I don't really change the sliders at all. I don't like
7922880	7929440	give more to the charity. I just, whatever the default is. Um, SSG100Matt says, I believe humble
7929440	7933520	was given the edict from Ziff Davis, the parent company to change the business model or they'll
7933520	7938240	close it down. I'm sure Ziff is suffering from the pandemic and looking at their fiscal stuff.
7938240	7943040	I'm sure humble is not really profitable and they push them to change this. Either they cap it or
7943040	7948400	humble goes away. Sad truth. And Tiger Claw follows that up with it's more like a humble
7948400	7958240	stumble. Stop. Oh, you, uh, Jamie, uh, what are your thoughts with the whole, like, you know,
7958240	7963120	is it, is, is a 15% charity donation enough to get you to pay attention still to the store or
7963680	7969200	is it, it's just kind of whatever at this point. I'm kind of whatever. You're all in on Stadia now
7969200	7975360	anyway, so it doesn't matter. Yeah, it's pretty much as like, uh, I, my, my heart has been taken
7975360	7980400	by the Stadia. All right. Well, at least my gaming experience has been taken by the Stadia.
7980400	7987920	All right. All right. Let's move on and, uh, talk about our next story, which is, um, something I
7987920	7993120	was not aware of, even though I've been interested in this game because everybody tells me I need to
7993120	8000240	play the other game. Anyway, Jamie, please take it away. So, um, there is definitely some trauma
8000240	8007200	going on with Nier Replicant, um, which is the newest game in the Nier series. And this is going
8007200	8010560	to be a little bit spoilery. So I'm going to go ahead and give the warning out there. And it's,
8010560	8014160	it's a reimagining of the first game is important to put out the Japanese version of first game.
8014160	8017840	It's not like a new thing in the story. It's a reimagining. I never played any of them. So,
8018560	8024240	um, anyways, so, um, with this game, uh, then since it's not a spoiler,
8024800	8033280	they have put in two achievements that could definitely be seen as sexist, but absolutely
8033280	8040400	as transphobic as well. Um, one of the characters in the game and I'm going to mispronounce, I think
8040400	8050880	it's a kinase is intersex. Um, meaning has both general sets of, uh, genitalia. Um, so there is
8050880	8057280	an achievement called daredevil. You risk life and limb 10 times to discover someone secret,
8058400	8068160	which is basically an upskirt cam. You look up kinase skirt 10 times. Um,
8068960	8073520	there was, uh, and it was the same thing as a near automata called, what are you doing?
8073520	8081360	Where you look up to be skirt. It's the upskirt thing. It's just encouraging bad behavior,
8081360	8087120	but in this case, since it's dealing with an intersex character, it really is just
8088400	8095040	disgusting. Very bad taste at the bare minimum. It comes off like, I don't know if the intent
8095040	8098800	was there to be transphobic, although that doesn't certainly matter at the end of the day,
8098800	8102000	this whole thing just comes out. Like it just comes off as immature. Like it's just,
8102000	8107360	it's just immature. Like, and I thought as gamers and wanting to be accepted as an art form,
8107360	8111600	which those near games are very artistic. And that's, that's the reason why I think this is
8111600	8115680	so frustrating is that you don't want to see the game get canceled all over all this or whatever,
8115680	8120880	because especially with your automata, there's a lot of beauty and brilliance in the story
8120880	8125680	to just see something so immature, be a big blemish on it is just fresh.
8125680	8131200	This isn't immaturity specifically, this is sexist immaturity.
8131200	8132560	I'll give you that. Absolutely.
8132560	8137920	The sexism is definitely there. And so there's already some major complaints about it,
8137920	8143600	but we cannot overlook the general sexism of everything. Yeah. You know,
8144400	8148400	by putting a blanket immaturity statement on it, it removes what this really is.
8148400	8152720	Yeah. And you got some folks in chat that are echoing this a little bit saying,
8152720	8158480	as Joe and Hunter Matt says, poor taste. Act Dev says, yeah, immature. It's bad nonetheless.
8158480	8162720	Bob Coffee says, even if the intent is to reference automata's achievement,
8162720	8166160	it's pretty tasteless. It shouldn't have been an automata in the first place.
8166160	8171280	I would also agree with that. Amethyst Rose Witch says immature is an understatement. And I will,
8171280	8175520	I will, I will grant, even though that's the first word that comes to my mind, I think
8175520	8179920	dark soccer makes a very clear statement. And I agree with her that, you know, there's,
8179920	8186320	it's, it's immaturity that, that has, that has very much sexism playing into it because we'd
8186320	8191760	upskirt on dudes is not a thing. Where's that achievement? That's not, you know,
8191760	8198320	that's not a thing. Where's that anime? There's no, I haven't seen too many dudes in kilts.
8198320	8203360	Yeah. And games. So anyway, and then so, but now you have this additional kind of like thing where,
8203360	8209680	where actually it's pretty cool that there's an intersex character in a game because there
8209680	8216480	are intersex people in this world, quite a few of them. And I'm sure that representation is awesome,
8216480	8221680	you know? So in, in that regard, you go near is doing an awesome thing by having an intersex
8221680	8228000	character be, and then it's like, and they do this really stupid thing with it and it sucks.
8228720	8235680	So that's, that's where we're left with, right? It's just, this is the kind of thing we really
8235680	8240560	shouldn't be encouraging. Yeah, no, I agree. I agree. I think they should probably, uh,
8240560	8245440	just take, take that achievement out and replace it with something that has to do with the game.
8245440	8249200	And it's not like she's wearing much of anything. She's basically wandering around and, you know,
8249200	8257440	negligee. Yeah. But I, I do, I do understand where folks are very upset. I don't want to make sure
8257440	8260800	this is clear too, especially when I'm using the word like immature. I want to make clear,
8260800	8266480	I do understand where folks are very upset about this focus on genitalia, right? Because
8266480	8272720	unfortunately in our culture, you know, my brain goes to that Katie Couric interview when she's
8272720	8278720	interviewing what Laverne Cox and Carmen Carrera, I think that's her name, right? That was on Drag
8278720	8284080	Race all those years ago and then transitioned. Right. Um, and Katie Couric, who you think is
8284080	8289600	this like respectable journalist wants to talk about genitalia. And it's like that,
8291280	8295600	why do we as a society have a fascinating fascination with that? That is a much deeper
8295600	8301360	question I expect us to tackle on this show. But my point is, is that like, that's just like
8301360	8306720	why this is so like, if you're having difficulty understanding, why does this get to the level of
8306720	8314720	transphobic? Because it, it makes it seem like gender is only genitalia and it's not that.
8315520	8318400	Would you agree with what I said, Jamie, or you want to course correct me a little bit?
8319440	8328080	Gender is not genitalia. Exactly. You know, your genitalia is basically what variety of
8328080	8334000	reproduction you can and cannot do. Yeah. End of story. Yep. And some people, I have
8334720	8343360	several friends who are intersex. One, um, who, uh, actually does have fairly working parts of
8343360	8346640	anatomy and I'm not going to name names or anything. And I only know this because I'm a
8346640	8359360	good friend. You know, it's, um, it's definitely, um, definitely something that these are mostly
8359360	8365360	children by the way, who are having sex change performed on them or an assignment physically
8365360	8375040	inflicted on them in the hospital. Um, gender is personal. It's not a preference. Stop using
8375040	8382240	preferred pronouns and just call them pronouns. Gender is a part of who you are and how you
8382240	8392480	identify. And so it's nobody's business, what genitalia that, that you have and parents should
8392480	8398000	stop announcing it to the world. They say, Oh look, I have a little human. Are you saying
8398000	8403520	we shouldn't create earthquakes with giant explosions? God's been dropping hints to knock
8403520	8410080	it off. God's been dropping a lot of hints to knock it off. And I'll actually even say in
8410080	8417600	Judaism there's seven genders. Oh, interesting. Yeah. Although there should be one for, for
8418240	8424000	female bodies in my position, but I won't, I won't go on that. So yeah, you, again,
8424000	8429600	a whole other podcast going on here. And, and honestly, if this is of interest to you and
8429600	8434480	you don't have to consider yourself intersex, transgender, whatever, to be interested in these
8434480	8438480	topics, that's, that's education listening to folks, right? Let's just, so if you want to
8438480	8442240	listen on this stuff, there's lots of podcasts out there, but just to, just to shift the
8442240	8446320	conversation back a little bit to this, I just, you know, I think it's just very frustrating to
8446320	8451040	see like, Oh, this company did a great thing in the story and then they shot it in the foot
8451040	8456720	with this, you know, dumb thing. Yeah. So, yeah. And I know what their goal was. Two steps forward,
8456720	8460480	two steps back, right? I know their goal was to harken back to the other achievement,
8460480	8465280	but like I said, the other achievement shouldn't have existed either. Yeah. No,
8465280	8469840	right. Absolutely right. It was, it was, and it may be in the instance of Nier Automata,
8469840	8474560	it's definitely, you know, that, that, um, sexist immaturity thing. I'm sorry. I forgot the exact
8474560	8478800	phrase you use, but it's, it's, it's definitely that. And it's just kind of one of those, again,
8478800	8485200	if gaming culture wants to be seen as grownups, then we kind of have to act grown up. That's what
8485200	8489920	it boils down to. If you, and if you're sitting there going, but my anime titties, but my it's
8489920	8496480	like, you have problems with yourself. Like there's a whole other art form for you
8498000	8502880	that needs to stay out of video games. And I need to, I need to correct myself. It's actually six,
8502880	8510400	uh, uh, six genders in Judaism. Thank you. All right. Let's, um, let's try to cleanse the
8510400	8515280	palette a little bit because, um, this there's some interesting similarities in this next story.
8515760	8522080	And I'll, I'll just turn it over to Loki. Yeah, this is kind of surprising. Um, so there
8522080	8530720	gearbox gearbox exec, uh, David Najib had testified against the Texas house bill 4042,
8530720	8535120	which would force a transgender athletes in public schools to compete in the sports.
8535120	8539840	According to the gender, they were assigned at birth. Uh, he basically said, I'm a Texan.
8539840	8545200	I was born here and I know it's a welcoming, friendly place. I want to push that and not
8545200	8552400	making up laws. We don't need, um, you know, our games company in competition or in competition
8552400	8557120	worldwide, we sell more to Asia than we do in the United States. We bring in a lot of money
8557120	8562000	into the state. We're headquartered here. We don't drive us to where we have to start expanding
8562000	8565840	outside of Texas and outside of the country. We want to keep doing business here.
8566560	8571920	Um, basically threatening that, you know, if something like this passes that they might
8571920	8577600	consider taking their business elsewhere. Um, it's kind of, it's kind of sickening that,
8577600	8582800	you know, we see this kind of stuff happening right now and it's not just in Texas either. So,
8583360	8589680	yeah, I don't know. Thank you for, um, being our token heterosexual saying that by the way,
8589680	8593760	cause we need more people like you to recognize that this is, this is wrong.
8593920	8597680	It's ridiculous. All the things in the world right now, why are we worried about like
8599120	8605600	childhood sports? Who cares? Yeah. I, I, you know, you're preaching to the choir with me
8605600	8609600	and, and our soccer and all that, but again, it's, it's very nice to hear you say that.
8609600	8615360	Um, and it's, it's, and, and it's nice to hear gearbox say that, which is a company that has,
8615360	8619760	again, it's, it's interesting cause now we have a two steps back, two steps forward situation,
8619840	8624160	you know, gearbox is, uh, if it's saying constellations, it's not Randy Pitchford that
8624160	8630960	said that. So, you know, maybe, maybe it's still terrible. It's a sign of, of change in the guard
8630960	8636400	at gearbox. Perhaps. I don't know. I don't know, but it is refreshing to see them really take a
8636400	8641040	stand with that. You know, saying, you know, we're a Texas company. We do this. This law is not what
8641040	8646720	we're about. And, and it's been nice that in some other States, there have been some surprising
8646720	8651600	people that you would expect might support this. Right. Cause it was, it was vetoed in one state.
8651600	8655760	I'm unfortunately, this is happening far too often frequently, or I can't remember what
8655760	8659680	States are doing what, but it's been vetoed by like two different governors in two different
8659680	8666800	States, if I'm not mistaken. So. Yeah. And, and, um, actually, you know, to give Randy some, uh,
8667520	8675120	prompts at least, um, he did echo the sentiment that was put forward by, um, the other guy saying,
8675120	8679680	you know, the kinds of people that are best in the world at creating technology, at creating
8679680	8685040	entertainment, these are people that do not want to live in places that are seen as discriminatory.
8685040	8689600	So at least he did kind of echo that sentiment as well, but still, you know,
8690400	8697040	he's got his own problems. Uh, going to chat, uh, Bobby Blackwolf says I'm in Georgia,
8697040	8700960	so I can help give Texas some pointers on companies leaving their state. And yeah, that's,
8700960	8705840	you know, another place where, uh, the companies have been voting with their wallets, so to speak.
8705840	8710160	So, um, yeah, you have to vote with your wallet cause they're making it impossible to do it
8710160	8718480	otherwise. It's I, I, my, my laugh is a laugh of shock at the accuracy of that statement.
8718480	8726880	Like drag them, expose them. Loki. Yes. All right. Oof. Um, as she, 100 mountain chat
8726880	8730640	says as someone who works in sports, this is such a vindictive, nasty thing to do. It's
8730640	8734160	just unnecessary. Yes. Again, we're going to have a whole another podcast on this topic,
8734160	8738720	but I'm very thankful to hear that a lot of people, you know, no matter, uh, I, we've got
8738720	8743040	a variety of backgrounds here, a variety of, you know, life steps, a variety of political leanings.
8743040	8746640	And I think most people are pretty much in agreement on this and maybe the folks that
8746640	8750640	aren't are being a little more quiet and listening to the reasons why we're saying it's such a bad
8750640	8754720	thing. And that's, that's a, that's a good thing too. Uh, hopefully maybe change a few minds here
8754720	8763760	as to why this is just, it's, it's gross thing to do. So, um, anyhow. Uh, uh, yeah. Pixel pocket
8763760	8767840	says, uh, the anti-trans bills occurring in a handful of states are so utterly fucked up
8767840	8772480	and hurting people who cannot defend themselves children and follows that up with think of the
8772480	8777360	children. Oh no, we don't mean all children. So, um, very well said there by pixel pockets.
8777360	8783040	I'll leave it on that note. Um, although they, thanks to gearbox for, uh, sticking up for that.
8783040	8788560	And, um, I th I think, um, do, do a good thing for the gaming industry. We kind of talked about
8788560	8792960	making the game industry sound like grownups. I think that was a very grownup thing for them
8792960	8800080	to do. So awesome. All right, moving on. Let's talk about, let's talk about something a little
8800080	8805600	silly. Um, but, but in the best possible way, and I think a good last story tonight to end on,
8805600	8812560	and that has to do with this up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right. Be a start,
8812560	8816720	select, start. They, they all have different endings to them, but I'm sure you all recognize
8816720	8823760	that as the infamous Konami code, right? Well, did you know the Konami code is now 35 years old?
8824320	8831760	Hello old and aging. Guess what? That's you. Uh, and I believe that code was first in the game.
8831760	8835280	Gradius, uh, was where that code showed up for the first time. And then of course,
8835280	8838880	I think a lot of people know it from Contra though, certainly. Uh, but all of those,
8838880	8843840	of course, the early Konami games where that sequence would unlock certain things or what
8843840	8850560	have you. Um, now. Konami in celebration of the 35th anniversary. Yes. Konami did something. It's
8850560	8856000	very exciting. Uh, they've teamed up with some musicians to do some remixes, uh, from Gradius
8856000	8861280	in what they're calling a lo-fi hip hop compilation. So it's remixes of what's that?
8861920	8866560	So that sounds nice. Oh yeah. It's cool. Uh, a remix of the, I would, I would play it here,
8866560	8870240	but that gets into weird copyright things. And so I just would encourage you to seek this out
8870240	8875840	on your own. Um, it's a remix of the theme by Tokyo machine is included on that as well. Uh,
8875840	8879360	and, uh, there's also some merchandise, of course, of course, cause you know,
8879360	8884000	Konami is getting into that right now, selling the merchandise like Gradius t-shirts and logos from
8884000	8889200	Gradius titles and so forth. Um, anyhow, there, the video, if you want to check that out is on
8889200	8894320	YouTube. So check Konami's YouTube channel, and there is a company illustration and motion graphic
8894320	8900240	to, uh, kind of, uh, uh, mimic what's going on there. And, uh, there's six tracks in the list
8900240	8904640	and, uh, you can check that out over on Konami's YouTube channel. So, uh, a fun way to kind of
8904640	8910880	celebrate something that a lot of us as gamers just have ingrained into our brains that up,
8910880	8916320	up, down, down, left, right, left, right BA start. Yeah. Uh, quick can, does anyone remember the
8916320	8925200	championship code from the Capcom code? Uh, down, right, up, left YB. If I remember right,
8925200	8927920	this is how you unlock championship mode. If I, somebody can fact check me on that,
8927920	8931680	see if my memory still works after all these years, but I say downright as in the button
8931680	8938080	down, right, up, left YB, I believe is it. So, uh, Bobby black Wolfen chat, uh, giving us the,
8938080	8948640	uh, infamous IDD, QD and those codes IDBFG. Uh, Oh, I was right. Dark Tetsuya says I'm right.
8948640	8953920	Yeah. Don right up left YB or it's XA at the Japanese version. Okay. Fair enough. Um,
8953920	8960080	orange, right. Says ABA CABB. That's the blood code, right? From world combat. If I remember
8960080	8965600	right. Um, ABA and Ikari warriors. That's right. Abba. My favorite code in any game.
8965600	8973040	Good. All right. Anyway. Excellent. So, uh, of good reminiscent on the codes and all that
8973040	8979200	good stuff. I still need to do the one in dead by daylight to get the Vic Viper. That would not work
8979200	8985280	for the life of me on the Xbox one, but I need to try it now. It doesn't work on console. It
8985280	8989840	only there's people that have YouTube's of it where they're doing it stopped working after
8989840	8997120	July, 2020. Why did they turn it off? They did hold on. I've actually got the thing to tell you
8997120	9006400	rude, but it still works on PC. Still works on PC. They ended this. I've got the article.
9006400	9009760	No wonder it didn't work. And I'm looking at these YouTube's where I'm like, the guy's doing
9009760	9018960	it slower than I, God. Um, yeah. June, June 16th, 2020. Um, it, it ended on, um, on the console
9018960	9025120	versions. Oh, that's irritating. All right. Well, thank you for letting me know I can stop. There's
9025120	9029600	another reason to buy it on steam so I can have my Vic Viper. All right. Yeah. Uh, this is the part
9029600	9033600	of the show where we would go to the mailbag, participate at orange launch radio.com. If you
9033600	9040320	want to send us an email, but I believe that is an empty mailbag this week, right? Yeah. All right.
9040320	9045920	So you know what that means? Drag race talk. Season 13 finally ended. I didn't watch it,
9045920	9050640	but of course Twitter filled me in on it. All right. Then I won't worry. All right. Don't
9050640	9057040	chat. Don't spoil please. Cause dark soccer for myself right now. Oh, all right. Just tell me
9057040	9063760	we get dark soccer's reaction live. Uh, I, um, I, I want to be very careful not to spoil it for
9063760	9069360	anyone out there. Although I guess it's been 48 hours. Oh yeah. It was the second person I would
9069360	9073680	have wanted. Yeah. I, I, and I would say it was the per I did watch the beginning of the season.
9073680	9078400	I would say it was extremely obvious to me that person was going to win from like episode three.
9079120	9083680	So I, I don't know why everyone, I get that. Um, one of the other contestants was really
9083680	9088000	showing a lot and I think had a lot of people rooting, um, for them, uh, uh, throughout the
9088000	9093360	season. But, um, but I think it was obvious from the third episode, this dress. Yeah. I'll have
9093360	9097280	to link you to pick the, the picture. I already know what it is. This is the one that looks like
9097280	9103760	the final fantasy boss meets pinhead. All right. You'll have to already send it to me. The one,
9103760	9108800	the white dress. Oh no, it's I'm thinking of something else. Nevermind. Okay. All right.
9108800	9113680	Anyway. Uh, hopefully all star six starts soon. That one's going to be on paramount plus. What
9113680	9120240	do you think about that? Drag race, uh, taken one of its biggest, uh, spinoffs to, uh, another,
9120240	9127680	uh, uh, service. It's kind of interesting. I wish they'd just stay somewhere. All right.
9129040	9133440	By the way, guys, I'm trying to talk Shane into the, um, Pokemon stream and I think,
9134160	9138800	um, uh, he's, he's into it. He's like, is this another point reward thing? And I'm going to be
9138800	9143760	like, no, just, just because, but he says, I don't see why this wouldn't be doable. So I think we're
9143760	9147920	onto something there. So we may, we may have a special stream here at VOG just because not
9147920	9151040	everything has to be a point reward thing, right? Bobby. I got to get clearance from Bobby. Not
9151040	9154960	everything has to be a point reward thing, right? Bobby. All right. I'm almost positive. Uh, he'll
9154960	9163040	be with me on the same. He's like content. Great. Do it. All right. Um, okay. Thank you. Bobby says
9163040	9167920	not everything has to be a point reward. Great. Excellent. All right. Uh, let's get into some
9167920	9175840	last minute stories then. Uh, Loki. All right. So, uh, it's happened. It's happened. We're
9175840	9182320	finally getting Lego, green Mario, and I'm very excited. I should, I forgot to slot that story.
9183520	9188960	It's it was coming out. It's coming out in August. So in my head, that was in the first
9188960	9195680	half of the show, Loki. It's all good. Yeah. So a brand new starter set coming, uh, with boom,
9195680	9200640	boom and a pink Yoshi. So I will have to pick that up, but that's, uh, yeah, coming out
9200640	9207520	August 1st, which is actually a year after the original, uh, Lego Mario set bid. Um,
9207520	9211040	so looking forward to that and what other sets are coming. Cause obviously now that they have
9211040	9216880	a new starter set, they're going to have some more, uh, stuff coming. So very interesting.
9218720	9223680	Uh, pixel, pixel pockets and chat says, what else happened on the show? And Rob's head,
9223680	9226960	um, we had the listenership we had in 2006.
9230320	9235200	I'm teasing. I love you guys that show up every week. I really do. All right. Sorry, Loki.
9236320	9242560	Um, yeah. So, uh, there was that. And then apparently some rumors that, um,
9243840	9249680	Sony is blocking, uh, resident evil eight from games past because of force parody.
9250320	9255360	Oh, I did see some of the rumors about that and that whole, the contract page that leaked
9255360	9261200	and all that stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I honestly though, should that surprise anyone? Like people are
9261200	9267600	acting like it's this big ass deal, but like if Sony is going to spend the, the free promotion,
9267600	9272720	when they put a resident evil trailer in their PlayStation showcase and all this stuff,
9272720	9276320	they're basically giving them free advertising, you know, and there's, you know, certain
9276320	9281760	concessions. So yes, they're going to be like, Hey, you can't go and then give away this game
9281760	9287120	on game pass. You know, when it's, we're trying to sell copies on PlayStation by having these ads
9287120	9292160	here. I'm not sure why this is shocking to some people. Um, I think it's just shocking to see it
9292160	9296720	in writing and people feel like they're in a secret club getting to read these leak contracts
9296720	9300160	and stuff. And I get that. Like, it's like, Ooh, I'm seeing something I'm not supposed to see.
9300160	9304320	And it's a little bit scandalous, you know, but I don't think it's, this should not be
9304400	9309440	surprising whatsoever. Um, and Bobby black woven chat says, yeah, I don't begrudge Sony for this.
9309440	9314640	They're doing a lot of marketing and free demos and stuff. Absolutely. I don't like,
9314640	9320960	this shouldn't be a surprise. Like, honestly, be happy you got MLB the show. And I say this
9320960	9326160	as some, and you guys know, I've been very pro Xbox the last couple of years on this show. Okay.
9326160	9330080	So like, but I'm going to say, I'm going to say to the Microsoft folks on this one,
9330960	9334960	just back off. Okay. Like this, this, this one makes sense.
9334960	9340400	Okay. Loki, uh, there was something else I saw too, about them renewing their trademark for
9340400	9347200	PlayStation home. So was that a thing that's happening? That is another route. Well,
9347200	9353440	we don't know. Uh, it's, it's in that rumor status since it's not, yeah. Um, curious.
9353440	9357840	I don't know. I don't, I don't know if we should jump to the conclusion it's happening.
9357840	9362800	It would be a very nice summertime announcement. Um, but I'm sure there's a lot of people going,
9362800	9368640	Ooh, PlayStation home makes a lot of sense for VR. Um, which I could definitely see it going that
9368640	9374400	way. Uh, uh, uh, uh, VR chat type of thing, I guess. Um, but I, I honestly would like to see
9374400	9380800	PlayStation home. I know we gave PlayStation home a lot of shit, but we had very ardent fans of
9380800	9386080	PlayStation home really open our eyes to the capability of, of what it could do over the years.
9386160	9391920	And I think the most frustrating part was that like, you really saw the limits of what they
9391920	9397360	were able to do in PlayStation home. Like, Oh man, it would have been awesome if like our clubhouse
9397360	9403200	could have played a YouTube or a trailer or have maybe custom items that we did, whatever happened
9403200	9407120	to the trophies for achievements and stuff that you could actually put on your wall. Like there
9407120	9412480	were, there were a lot of potential things that, that home never realized. And then it did other
9412480	9415840	things that were kind of neat, like the fake E3 booth, the virtually three booth. That was kind
9415840	9421520	of cool. So I would hope that maybe the technology of the PlayStation five can really let them
9421520	9426240	advance those capabilities of PlayStation home, but they need to be able to advance those
9426240	9430480	capabilities of PlayStation home for me to care. If they're just doing the same thing they did on
9430480	9437120	the PlayStation three, then, then it's going to be flop city. I don't think I I'm trying to believe
9437120	9443120	that wouldn't be the case that with an upgrade to PlayStation five comes more than better graphics
9443120	9450800	and better stuff that Sony really is looking at. How do we make a social thing to respond to Twitch
9450800	9455760	to respond to, you know, and then when they go and get rid of communities that really sends a
9455760	9463360	mixed signal, not the communities was really used at all. I like to think Sony did that in
9463440	9468720	preparation for this, but am I giving them too much credit? I'm worried I am.
9471280	9474880	Anyway, thank you for bringing that up. I forgot about that one. And that one's important.
9475440	9480160	No problem. Hi, Midna. I see Kitty on cam. Here we go. All right. Anything else?
9480160	9486080	Mama has some string cheese. No, that's it. All right. Then I think we're about ready to wrap up.
9486080	9490080	So I want to thank everybody for listening to Orange Lawns Radio tonight. Thank you so much
9490080	9494160	for participating with our show. If you enjoyed what you heard here on OLR, please tell a friend
9494160	9497760	or two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has
9497760	9503920	a voice. But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, what can we do? A nice five star review on
9503920	9508000	a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this podcast will go a very long way. Spotify,
9508000	9512320	we're on there too. So thank you very much to everybody that does that. An auto host here at
9512320	9519520	Twitch TV also does wonders. So thank you to those of you that go and do that as well. If you feel so
9519520	9525040	inclined, you can also support our store over at vognetwork.com slash shop if you want to be able
9525040	9533040	to shop for some merchandise there like an OLR sticker or things like that. So thank you. Again,
9533040	9537280	a lot of you were very generous tonight during the show here live on Twitch. A lot of you are
9537280	9541840	very generous in the things you say throughout the week online on Twitter and all that stuff.
9541840	9546320	So thank you very much for everybody that takes time out to say hello and they appreciate what
9546320	9550640	we're doing here. We appreciate you. Thank you so much. It was funny. There was actually somebody
9550640	9556240	I was having a disagreement with on Twitter. We were having a spirited disagreement, not an
9556240	9560640	F U U F and F and things like that. It was, you know, oh, we disagree on this. Here's my perspective.
9560640	9565040	Here's my perspective. But I thought it was very nice that he ended it with, hey, I'm a big fan of
9565040	9569760	OLR. And I was like, that does mean a lot. Even if we don't agree on this one particular issue,
9570080	9577120	I it still means a lot that people are. So inclined to engage and interact with the show
9577120	9582000	and and the people behind it after all these years coming up on 19 years in June.
9582880	9588160	All right. I think we should get final thoughts, shouldn't we? I will start with Dark Sakura.
9590080	9594400	Please stay tuned. Please stay tuned. Please, please, please. I need the attention.
9594480	9599840	All right. At least you're honest. All right. My channel, I want I want to do more things
9599840	9606480	for everybody. And the only way I can do them is if people join in. My final thought is, please
9606480	9612160	cross your fingers and toes. We put our first bid in on a house today. And I'm not thinking we're
9612160	9618640	going to get it, but I had this house is perfect. It has it like it has an upstairs loft area that
9618640	9624000	would be perfect for this show if we wanted to continue to do it in person. So and it's much
9624000	9630400	closer to you, Dark Sakura. So we'll see what happens anyway. Loki, last but not least, your
9630400	9636640	final thought. So during the show, I ordered labels for my cartridges, so hopefully they turn
9636640	9643040	out. All right. Getting closer. Appreciate that. All right. I can't wait to own a physical copy.
9643040	9647360	All right. That's it, everybody. We'll be back to do it in seven days. Thank you for tuning into our
9647360	9652560	show this week. And we'll see you next week when, oh, my gosh, it's actually going to be May, isn't
9652560	9658560	it? Please leave your Justin Timberlake memes out of this. That is overdone. That's it. Have
9658560	9665520	a great night, everybody. Good night. You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange
