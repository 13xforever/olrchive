0	14000	This week, a slate of cancellations arose that many, or at least, yours truly, hoped
14000	17660	wouldn't. It may be April 2021, but the world is only just rounding the corner and
17660	21480	we still have a ways to go. Cons are staying in their typical event timeframes, but sticking
21480	25220	to the online model for at least one more year. Part of me hopes that a certain portion
25220	29080	of this online geared content never goes away, even in the years to come.
29080	33000	Join your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki for conscious optimism on this and
33000	35860	the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has
35860	36860	a voice.
36860	45720	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back. It's another week of the show
45720	52080	where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio Live once again tonight on April the
52080	59160	4th of 2021, episode number 863 of our show. My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with
59160	64600	you every week when we record. Also joining me mostly every week, sadly not last week,
64600	67080	but she's back this week, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
67080	68080	Hi.
68080	69080	Hello.
69080	70080	Last week kicked my ass.
70080	73080	Welcome back. Yeah, we talked a little bit about it on air. I mentioned that you got
73080	76840	the Pfizer Vax. I figured you wouldn't care if I told people that. And you were dealing
76840	81080	with some of the side effects with that. And we were we were having a laugh. Like I said,
81080	87360	we would that I got Moderna, Loki got J&J and you got Pfizer. It's very, very funny
87360	89260	to me. I don't know why.
89260	96080	So it's the triumvirate of American vaccines, I guess. Yes. Yes. But I've been I've been
96080	101000	reading that people have stronger reactions to the Pfizer one, but it also is the most
101000	106120	effective interest. Well, there you would be careful downplaying the effectiveness because
106120	111500	they're all you need to take whatever one they give you active. Yeah, but it's I don't
111500	115840	know what it is, but I guess that it's sort of like your body has an immediate reaction
115840	127640	to it and then etc. Yeah. But, but I also do have other underlying issues. And so I
127640	133200	expected to be sick for at least a day, but I had a migraine for like three days.
133200	135200	Yikes. But you're better now.
135280	140200	Yeah, I'm better. But the other thing is funny is that they wanted me to come back on this
140200	146280	on the 17th. And I'm like, no, I'm going to come on the 20th because the 19th is my birthday
146280	152480	and I am not going to be sick on my birthday.
152480	157120	So since you're talking about shots next week is my second Moderna shot and it's actually
157120	162280	on Sunday morning. So we I am trying to make contingency plans for O.L.R. where I may just
162360	166640	be pushing buttons. We may have a guest host next week, actually. I may just push buttons
166640	170000	and there's somebody else in the third chair next week. I don't know who I have to ask
170000	174300	him. I have some people in mind. I have to see who's available. But yeah. So so plan
174300	177240	on that because vaccinations, they're important.
177240	185620	Yeah, yeah. But the other thing, though, is that since I'm going to be fully vaccinated,
185620	192200	if I can get my mother vaccinated and mobile, then I'm going to try to get her out here
192200	198240	for Thanksgiving. Oh, that would be lovely. If not, since Dan and I both will be vaccinated,
198240	202600	I'm going to see if we can go see her instead. Oh, if she does come out here, I'd love to
202600	207560	meet her. I've heard about her all these years. Never got to meet her. My mama and I'll be
207560	213680	vaccinated. So I'll be a lady. All right. Well, you missed a messy ass show last week.
213680	219720	Let me tell you, our saga happens when I'm not there. Well, you know, the show is fine.
219720	223920	Like Loki and I held down the fort with stories and everything, but just technically it was
223920	227400	a mess. We had some major streaming issues towards the end of the show, things that were
227400	230960	just like I couldn't control them. Twitch, one of the Twitch servers went down, the one
230960	234600	we were using, and that caused problems. And then come to find out I wasn't recording the
234600	242120	show last week. Now, I and of course, everybody in chat is like, are you recording tonight?
242120	248360	Yes. Yes. I hit the button. They were asking. Yes. So it's recording. Well, here's the good.
248360	252560	Here's the good news, Jamie. Ever since we moved to Twitch, because we've had this show
252560	257400	for coming up on 19 years, a long fucking time. Right. Exactly. We were doing it on
257400	263120	Shoutcast. If we didn't record, that's it. Show's gone. But thanks to the Twitch thing,
263120	267440	Twitch always has a backup. So it was just late. So those that listen to us on the podcast
267440	270640	feed and I know there's a lot of you, the show just went up really late. And that's
270640	274200	because of the tech issues. I had to stream multiple shows together and download them
274200	278280	from Twitch. So it took me a little while longer. So sorry about that. I'm sorry, podcasties.
278760	284760	We'll do better this week. Okay. Well, I came with more fun stuff to show people on on camera.
284760	288680	So yes. Oh, look, is that a sealed copy of Final Fantasy three you're holding up? Or six,
288680	294520	but you know, three in the US. It's it's in the box. It's not I put it in plastic to keep the
294520	300680	box. Oh, okay. I got you a real protector. And that's, that's a game celebrating an anniversary
300680	306600	as of like, I think, a couple days ago. Yep. I'll be showing off a different game every so often
306600	310280	as we go through the show today. Well, if you do want to watch us live on Twitch,
310280	315080	you can participate with us live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific Pacific,
315080	319960	six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwell show over at the Voice
319960	325800	of Geeks network twitch.tv slash VOG network. And if you do want to watch the video to see
325800	331720	the random objects Star Sacra holds in front of the camera, then you can subscribe to our channel
331720	337240	over at VOG network and you get access to all of the archives, you get the entire on demand stuff
337240	342440	included with your subscription. And that includes some bonus things that are up there including
342440	348680	Bobby Blackwell's VHS stream that he did a few days ago. And we have some award show things
348680	356920	that we did and get this just moments ago in our chat. The live participants have unlocked the next
356920	363320	bonus stream. So I will be talking to Shane shortly to set up Shane's definitive Pokemon
363320	368760	ranking that will be happening in the next couple weeks. I told him end of April because I didn't
368760	375240	think we'd raise the points that fast. Having the tech issues I think helped because people were
375240	380120	able to donate extra points. But so it may be a little bit because I did tell Shane it would be
380120	386680	a few weeks. But I also think Shane may be wanting to take the opportunity to spread his
386680	391720	Oshawa propaganda. I mean, who knows who might be number one on his list, but he'll take his
391720	396040	opportunity probably as soon as he possibly can. So we'll work that out in the coming days.
397000	402680	And yeah, Shane in chat saying you'll never guess who number one is. Well, even I may not be able to
402680	409000	guess who number two is, unless it's just evolutions of Oshawa, in which case I wouldn't
409000	414200	be able to guess who number four is. So we'll get down to this. This is what we're going to find out
414200	418440	on the next bonus stream. So that'll be coming at some point. We will announce the day on our
418440	425160	social media, twitter.com slash vog network. We'll announce it on our Discord, vognetwork.com slash
425160	429240	Discord. You will know when that's happening. And then of course, if you're a subscriber,
429240	432760	you can always watch it on demand, but it will not be podcast. That is the other thing about
432760	437480	these bonus feeds. They are things that are meant for Twitch. So they are not podcast anywhere.
437480	441960	So, all right. Anyway. Well, and by the way, if anyone wants to make an offer on any of
441960	447720	these games I'm holding up, talk to me. Okay. And Shane in chat is saying everything is fair game.
447720	452920	Megas, Gigantamaxes, forms, doesn't matter so long as it's been in the main game. All right. We'll
452920	457240	see. We'll see what happens. Okay. Loki, I hate to ignore you. I'm sorry. I had a lot of housekeeping
457240	463800	to get out, but hello. Techmaster Loki also here. Hi. Hello. How are you? I'm doing all right.
463800	471800	What's the game behind you tonight? It's just, it's very, um, much in theme with
471800	478520	recently released trailers. Oh, is it Space Jam? No, they never made a Space Jam game,
479320	485800	but you're close. They have that song, the title screen. Hold up, hold up. They never made a Space
485800	492520	Jam video game? No. Okay. What do they call, what do they call that phenomenon when like
492520	496680	you remember that the flute fruit of the loom logo has a quarter copia in it, even though it
496680	501960	doesn't and that like you think the Flintstone or the, yeah, that whole thing, what is that called?
501960	507720	Mandela, the Mandela effect, right? Yeah. Okay. Am I, am I having a Mandela effect right now?
507720	511480	Cause I swear to God, there was a Space Jam video game. There was no Space Jam video game,
511480	518360	no Space Jam video game. Oh my God. Oh my God. Yes, there is. I'm dis I'm like,
518520	525640	disassociating live on air game. Thank God. Where was it? It came out on Sega Saturn,
525640	531960	um, PlayStation and MS-DOS and it ran on the NBA Jam extreme engine. Okay. I was starting to
531960	540680	disassociate live on air. Oh my God. Loki. Don't do that to me. I'm old. I'm old. I've been in
540680	546840	quarantine. I've had it. Like, do not lie to me about things where I'm like, I swear.
547960	552120	He just wasn't familiar with it. No, I know. I know. I'm just giving him shit. Sorry, Loki.
553320	562760	So it's an RPG with basketball. It's it's Barkley shut up and jam get guidance.
562760	567640	Okay. All right. So it's, it's basketball adjacent. All right. I love that. And now,
567640	574040	wow. Chat is just flooding with receipts. Chat is just like, here's the Wiki. Here's the YouTube.
574040	579720	I owned it on Saturn. Uh, here's the gameplay on PS one. Like chat is just like pages and
579720	584600	pages of receipts. Loki. All right. That's fine. I forgot that there was a game.
584600	591880	Zen monkey says, I wish NBA Jam made an NBA, uh, made NBA Space Jam. Well, it was on the NBA Jam
591880	597080	engine. That's right. Yeah. I think, and I think that's why I played it. You guys know I don't play
597080	604920	a ton of sports games, but NBA Jam was my jam. And so that's probably why I played Space Jam
604920	609640	was because it was on a similar engine. There you go. So Bobby is suggesting that the Space
609640	613880	Jam should be classic. Well, not tonight. You've got a flag this week, but at some point
614680	619160	Space Jam will have to be a classic game of the week. Uh, just to make sure Loki is educated.
620680	626440	Maybe when the movie comes out, make it so, I mean, it's not really Space Jam though. The
626440	631640	new movie is basically ready player one again. So it's fine. Oh yeah. With all those cameos
631640	636040	showing up, it's kind of random, isn't it? It's got everything. It's it's got even the planets
636040	640600	with the different themes. I'm like, that's just ready player one. You basically took the script
640600	645400	for ready player one, two, and said, you know, that second ready player one book wasn't very
645400	650200	good. Let's just roll this in the Space Jam instead. So we had an idea of what we wanted
650200	655720	to do, but it's going to deviate too much from the book. So why not? Why not? All right. So,
655720	660200	uh, yeah, and, and chat, we, we can't just flip the classic game on a whim because, uh,
660200	664680	all the footage is grabbed, especially tonight. I had to stitch multiple YouTube's together for
664680	671720	tonight's pick. So we'll do it in July. All right. We'll mention though that Barkley shut up and jam
671720	678040	guidance is old enough for classic game of the week. So. All right. Next time, next time dark
678040	683080	soccer isn't here, it's your pick and we'll do it. All right. You just, last time I asked you
683080	686440	to pick it, you picked Halo. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm making a list.
687240	693080	Wait, we, well, we let Alan pick last week and some folks said that he did a very good job with
693080	696920	the segment. Um, and of course you were going to ask that question and I'm going to forget in the
696920	703000	moment. What did Alan pick last week? He picked, um, Oh my God, somebody in chat saved me. What
703000	708760	was the classic of the week last week? I don't remember what happened seven days ago.
708760	715400	Oh, Loki. You don't remember it either. Thank you. Super meat boy. He picks super meat boy.
716200	723080	Oh, that's right. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Jamie. This question was asked many times last week. Yes.
723080	729560	It's old enough. Exactly. So you had the same reaction. The rest of us did. And I think that's
729560	733880	why he picked it. I know he went on and he went, he looked at games that were released like 10
733880	738280	years ago. So that's like Alan's pulling off that other wig to do a wig reveal.
739560	746520	He sure did. Now that he's a streamer of his own accord, he's, he's, he's here to show us all up.
748360	753320	All right. I love it. All right. Uh, let's get into, uh, tonight's kickoff topic,
753320	759160	which ironically is about sports games. Um, this is crazy. We're talking about a lot of sports
759160	765720	games tonight. We've got Space Jam, NBA Jam, and now something new coming out, MLB The Show 21.
765720	769720	Why is everybody talking about this game? I think you guys know what's going on here.
769720	775560	Uh, this is a PlayStation Studios game and this has been, and I think many, I, I'm going to admit,
775560	779960	I don't play a lot of newer baseball games. I play a lot of retro stuff. Like I like baseball stars
779960	784440	and stuff, but, um, I don't play a lot of the newer stuff, but my understanding is this is kind
784440	789880	of a well-regarded baseball game. Uh, it's, it's kind of held in a better esteem than EA's series,
789880	793640	if I'm not mistaken, chat, feel free to correct me. Well, they don't even have a series anymore.
793640	798280	So it was, yes, that's it. Yes. That was it is that EA's was so bad. They stopped doing it. That
798280	805000	was it. Um, so, uh, MLB The Show is kind of the baseball game and, uh, people like this game, but
805640	812120	basically MLB came in and said, uh, in so many words, you could be selling more of this game
812120	815880	if you would put it out on other platforms. In fact, you know what, if you want to keep
815880	819800	this license, you're going to have to release this as a multi-platform game.
819800	826440	So we've already talked about in the past couple months, how it is a little weird that we have Xbox
826440	831800	game art with a PlayStation Studios logo on it. And many of us, you know, speaking of things that
831800	837080	we remember in our youth, many of us are having that same what that we had the first time there
837080	842520	was a Mario and Sonic at the Olympic games where it's like Mario and Sonic living together, mass
842520	847560	hysteria, right? All this. So now this is how we're feeling about the PlayStation logo showing
847560	855480	up on an Xbox box. But this week, the news went one step further. And that is, and I Loki, how
855480	861080	does this have, I don't even know how this happens, but apparently, and now the games are on it though.
861080	870120	So it makes sense. MLB the show 21 is going to be on game pass day one. So, and this is the part
870120	875800	that's making us all go. What is that? The game is going to be on game pass. A PlayStation game
875800	884040	is going to be day one on Microsoft game pass, not a PlayStation plus title, not a PS now title,
884040	891800	but a game pass title. Now my mind is, my mind was already blown. Now it's blended.
892920	900440	Loki, how does that happen? I don't know money. I'm assuming it's money that they've said,
900440	905080	Hey, you know, we're going to pay this much money to put in a game pass. And so he's like,
905080	911160	we like money, so we'll do it. All right. And so, so it happened, but like, that's really all I,
911640	919800	all I can imagine. So yeah, it's surprising. Chat coming to save the day because admittedly,
919800	924600	I don't know my shit when it comes to sports games. That's fine. Bobby Blackwolf in chat said,
924600	931560	MLB made the deal with Microsoft for game pass. Sony wasn't involved. Sony merely developed the
931560	937160	Xbox version. Sony is still publishing the PlayStation five version. The Xbox version
937160	942760	of this is not published by Sony. It's published by MLB. Aha, there's the aha moment. So the
942760	947160	PlayStation studios logo shows up because they're the ones that develop the game,
947160	953880	but they're not paying the money to get the boxes out there, push it to retail, do all that. MLB is
953880	961880	taking that cost on as part of their deal. So now MLB signed this deal with Microsoft. So first off,
961880	968440	whoever at Microsoft pick up the phone and called the MLB to put this offer out there is a shady
968440	973720	lady. And I mean that in the best possible way. These are the types of like business antics.
973720	981320	Whoever thought of that at Microsoft gets a raise. Called the MLB and said, here's an offer you can't
981320	987000	refuse. And the MLB accepted it. And so now as part of the publishing deal, this is on game pass.
987560	991640	So that makes a lot of sense as to how Sony probably had no say in this.
991640	995320	And they're probably pissed. So will they...
995320	997480	They're not happy about that. I'm imagining.
997480	1002520	Will they end up pushing it to PlayStation now or something else as a result? I don't know.
1002520	1003320	It's hard to say.
1006120	1007160	I don't know if they would.
1007160	1013560	GZDR4ev in chat says, didn't Cuphead go from Xbox to PlayStation Plus?
1014200	1018920	It is not a PlayStation Plus title. It is on PlayStation. So that is a thing.
1018920	1024200	Even though it gets into that weird thing where it's like a Microsoft subsidiary did it, if I
1024200	1029080	am not mistaken. And of course, we know that showed up on Switch. Ori showed up on Switch.
1029080	1034600	Microsoft and Switch in cahoots together is nothing new. But it is always a little
1034600	1039000	funky when you see the Sony and the Microsoft stuff kind of blend the lines a little bit.
1039800	1043000	And some other comments in chat.
1043000	1045800	Tiger Claw says, this is the first time in video game history
1045800	1048760	that a publisher is the company responsible for baseball.
1049960	1053880	And yeah, Bobby says MLB publishes some of the arcade games,
1053880	1057640	especially in the mobile phone space. So a little bit of a correction there.
1057640	1063640	So but still, you know, the optics of a Sony game being on game pass,
1063640	1067720	no matter how it happened, is certainly making a lot of people go,
1067720	1073480	well, I guess Sony gave up. Because I'll bet you what? I'll bet you there's hundreds of
1073480	1077560	YouTubes out there talking about this topic. And I'll bet you there's hundreds of podcasts
1077560	1081880	out there talking about this topic that didn't have that perspective that Bobby just gave us
1082600	1086280	about that the MLB is the ones actually publishing it. And I bet there's a lot
1086280	1091000	of people out there going, what is Sony doing? Sony's putting a game on game pass.
1092280	1097080	And everybody's losing their minds. And I've said this a million times on the show. And I
1097080	1101080	really believe this to be true. And I think this is one of those golden rules of gaming.
1101960	1105560	You know, obviously, we have the system is only as good as the games that are on it.
1105560	1110040	But here's the other one that I'm putting out there. It doesn't matter what the facts are,
1110040	1115960	it only matters what's perceived. And that I think is very true here is that the perception
1116680	1121240	is that Sony's putting a game on game pass. And that's what's causing people to lose their minds.
1121240	1124440	Yeah, that makes sense.
1125480	1129080	Certainly, there hasn't been a lot of bad news for game pass this year. I mean, shit,
1129080	1135240	Outriders was this week, that was a huge deal that landed day one on game pass. But there's the,
1135240	1139080	you know, Bethesda deal and all those games hitting and so on and so on. I feel like
1139080	1143640	at least a quarter a third of our shows this year have had the kickoff topic starting
1143640	1148920	something to do with game pass and how it's growing. Because this is just crazy.
1148920	1156760	Do you think the pressure is really going to be on Sony now to step up with some sort of response?
1156760	1162680	Or I guess, you know, some would argue PlayStation now is the response. So for Sony to really step up
1162680	1166920	their Netflix of games type of game, what do you think?
1168280	1173080	I think that they, I mean, eventually, it's gonna get to that point, if it's not there already,
1173080	1178040	especially when we start getting into some bigger exclusives. Right now, it's still really early in
1178040	1185960	the game, and not a lot of console exclusives have come out. So I would imagine that once those
1185960	1190520	big titles start coming out, especially when we start talking about like Elder Scrolls 6,
1190520	1197960	or the new Obsidian game, or Halo Infinite when it's good. And even so much, you know,
1197960	1204280	when we look at like what Sony has offering and stuff like that, it's a really interesting
1204280	1207800	proposition to say, hey, you know, all these really big games you've been looking forward to,
1207800	1213080	well, they're included in game pass, you don't have to pay additional money to play those. And
1213880	1219480	I mean, you still do, but like you don't buy each individual game, you could opt in to do game pass
1219480	1225240	instead, and you get access to all of these titles. So I have a feeling though, that once
1225240	1230440	Sony does respond to something that Microsoft's already planning with the next move to counter
1230440	1235080	that. So it'll be interesting to see what's going to happen. Maybe we hear something around,
1235080	1239640	you know, E3 time or something like that. Maybe we don't until someone does something.
1243000	1249560	In chat, the question from GZDR4ev says, will Microsoft strike a deal with Marvel and get Sony
1249560	1255160	to put Spider-Man on game pass Marvel or Disney now? Well, I think the way the contracts work
1255160	1258200	and all that, I'm not sure they could. And I think Bobby's right when he replies, it wouldn't
1258200	1263320	be retroactive. It certainly wouldn't. I mean, anything is possible going forward. Money talks,
1263320	1267880	and if Microsoft were to throw a lot of money, they might be able to get that. But I feel like
1267880	1277080	Sony's locked into a contract there. However, you know, there's that Avengers game. And I don't see
1277080	1281960	why Microsoft wouldn't be trying to lobby to get that on game pass at some point, because I don't
1281960	1286600	think that game has sold cuckoo bananas the way they were hoping it would. And I know they've had
1286680	1292360	to do some, you know, follow up content. They just reached the next gen stuff. So I would think that
1292360	1296360	event. Now, I realize the Avengers and Spider-Man are different, but we are talking, you know,
1296360	1301560	Marvel affiliated things, right? I would be shocked if the Avengers is not on game pass by
1301560	1310280	the end of the year. But we'll see. All right. So very interesting. You got a PlayStation Studios
1310280	1314600	game coming to game pass in a very roundabout way. But the optics of that I'm sure are going
1314600	1320760	to put a lot of pressure on Sony in the coming months. Let's move on to our gaming week and talk
1320760	1324200	about the types of video games we have been playing this week. Dark Soccer, I'll start with
1324200	1333560	you. How was your gaming week? Animal Crossing. And I was going to try Ring Fit finally, but I've
1333560	1341960	got a back injury. We don't know what it is yet. My x-ray was kind of inconclusive as to what
1341960	1349960	exactly is causing it. So that being said, I'm not in the best position to do a hardcore workout.
1349960	1356760	I've just been doing yoga. I have been playing word scapes pretty religiously. Like I said,
1356760	1365160	it's my morning wake up. And I have been trying to still get away to play Dead by Daylight.
1365800	1372280	And I think the GeForce experience will allow me to do it until I can get a proper visualizer on my
1372280	1379000	Mac, because my PC will. What kept happening to it is it kept shutting down just over and over.
1379000	1385080	It would shut down during the middle of the show. And I think I need a new lodge. I mean,
1385080	1391960	motherboard. It's a PC and not a Mac. I think I need a new motherboard. And I don't know.
1391960	1396200	I'm going to try to salvage the guts out of it for when Mass Effect comes out.
1396200	1399960	For what it's worth, I know that game's on Stadia. Dead by Daylight is on Stadia for sure,
1399960	1403640	which same concept as GeForce. I do have Stadia.
1403640	1409000	So something to think about. Well, I ended my subscription to the Stadia Prime or whatever
1409000	1411960	it was called. You don't need it. You would just need to buy the game. But then you're
1411960	1416520	buying a game that exists in the Stadia cloud. And, you know, there's a whole thing that comes
1416520	1423240	about that kind of last. Oh, Bobby's saying it was actually a Stadia pro game at one point,
1423240	1427720	so you may have claimed it and not even realized it. I may have if I've claimed it, then shit.
1427720	1433000	Yeah. Yeah. There you go. Take a look at that. But but at any rate,
1436120	1440040	I've been trying to get things together, but things haven't always worked out.
1440680	1446440	So but one thing is always a constant. Animal Crossing is always there. And today was bunny
1447240	1452120	day. How how are the Sanrio cards and all that? Well, you you'd already been kind of using them
1452120	1456040	for some time, but the contents there now. So how's that been going for you?
1456680	1461000	It's actually really cute. You know, it's all the same characters.
1463160	1467080	And like for Bunny Day today, I was actually running around in the little twin stars outfit
1467640	1472760	so you can get full outfits. I will not wear the koropi outfit because there's a snail on it and
1472760	1477960	snails are disgusting and I'm highly phobic. Yeah. Things you don't know about Jamie.
1480280	1483800	I actually have trauma related to snails, so don't get me started.
1485240	1493480	So at any rate, the content is really nice. I only have one of the characters at all
1495160	1500840	who I let Shevra go to get it all because the personality is the same, the normal character.
1502920	1509640	And the whole house is little twin stars, furniture and the bubble maker. It's actually
1509640	1515480	a lot of the same stuff if you're playing pocket camp. It's a lot of the same stuff for
1515480	1521640	a twelves, you know, tasks that you have to, you know, DIY some of the stuff together.
1522600	1535800	In other stuff, I've actually been working on, I guess, other projects semi-related to gaming.
1537640	1543880	I have been working on my Twitch graphics. Oh yeah. You showed me some of that. Yeah.
1544440	1553480	And I'm planning on streaming Hive Bent 2, episode 2.
1554280	1558040	Nice. So we'll see how that happens.
1559000	1563000	I'm going to chat for some comments. Continuing the Dead by Daylight conversation,
1563000	1566360	Act Def says Dead by Daylight was also PlayStation Plus one month. Yeah,
1566360	1570120	it's also an Xbox game pass, which means whenever X cloud is more available,
1570120	1574760	that's going to be an option as well. And yeah, they've been giving that game away,
1574760	1580680	so to speak, in many different places because they're still making money off all those cosmetics,
1580680	1584600	especially the DLC, right? We had that conversation a couple of weeks ago
1584600	1589080	where Dark Sakura Apple paid me five bucks. So I would play as Freddy in the game,
1589080	1593240	which I like him. I do. I'll follow up with that in a minute. I talked a little bit about it last
1593240	1596760	week, but I'll tell you more in a minute. But first, let's go to Loki. How was your gaming
1596760	1604280	week, Loki? I didn't play very much, so I have been working on my game. So I've got another eight
1604280	1609880	levels done, so I'm almost up to the 50 that I was going to try to do because I added two to every
1609880	1615960	single, well, two so far to four of the five worlds that are in Pixel Poops number two.
1617000	1620840	And then I did some research on the high score table, but then that looked really complicated,
1620840	1626840	so I took a break from that. Really this week, I've also been starting to get some stuff together.
1627400	1634280	I also want to start streaming on a regular basis. So like, for example, I've been getting stuff
1634280	1641960	together for doing Minecraft Let's Play stuff. So I normally play Bedrock, but I'm actually going to
1641960	1647160	go back into Java and do all that. And it's been a while since I've played Java, so I have to get
1647160	1653320	everything set up for that. I'm adding a bunch of vanilla tweets to cater my games similar to
1653320	1658520	what they have on Hermitcraft, some of the mods and stuff they have on there, so kind of modeling
1658520	1666200	it like that. And then I've been working on skins, so I've been trying to do those. So I'm actually
1666200	1673320	working on one right now. That looks pretty cool. So just doing all that, I have to get my workflow
1674040	1681800	set up for editing and cutting those together. And yeah, just have to get that all set up and ready
1681800	1687320	to go so I can actually start doing it. I already have a plan of what I'm going to, content-wise,
1687320	1695560	kind of like what the flow for that would be, but I just have to get to that point.
1696520	1702760	All right. Darsagra, have you ever used Game Pass or had Game Pass on Microsoft?
1702760	1703320	No.
1703320	1708200	Okay. Because I have here, this is a 14-day code, but you can't use it if you already have it or
1708200	1711800	have ever had it. So it's like an enabler code, basically. I think I got this.
1711800	1713240	You know I don't have the Xbox, right?
1713800	1718120	I do, but it works. It's ultimate, so it works on PC. And whenever they put out that cloud thing,
1718120	1722440	it would work with that too. So I was going to give this to a listener, but I'll give it to you
1722440	1726040	if you want it. I'd appreciate that. Thank you. Just message it to me.
1726040	1732520	I'll mark it for you. There you go. How about that? All right. Let's move on and talk about
1732520	1738120	my gaming week. So, okay. Let's talk about the Dead by Daylight thing. So yes, you bought Freddy,
1738120	1741480	essentially, for me. And I talked a little bit about this last week. I really enjoy him,
1741480	1745800	and I play him. And as of this week, he is my highest level character. He's out-leveled
1745800	1750600	Pyramid Head. That's how much I play with him. I also had my first experience early this week,
1750600	1758040	where I was playing the game as Freddy, and I noticed one of the other survivors had Twitch TV
1758040	1764840	in their name or TTV. And I wouldn't look during the match because that's unfair. But after the
1764840	1769800	match, I went to her channel and I said, hi from Freddy. And there was some nice little banter,
1769800	1776280	but I was able to go back and watch the match from her end. And it was really enlightening
1776280	1782280	because I did not do well that match, but in my defense that watching her Twitch stream made me,
1782280	1786680	three of them were partnered together. And that's a lot harder, especially when you're a newer killer.
1786680	1790360	But I thought it was really cool that I could see things from that perspective. And luckily,
1790360	1793160	they weren't shit talking because I was fully expecting they were going to go, God, this
1793160	1797800	Freddy's bad. What's he doing? But they were just, they were more kind of doing the like,
1797800	1801480	boy, this Freddy doesn't like to be looped. Because I noticed I started looping him and he
1801480	1805560	ran right away. And that's true. I don't like to be looped. And I was running into kick generators
1805560	1810200	because I feel like they loop me because they want to distract me from generators. But anyway,
1810200	1814760	it was very enlightening. So yeah, playing Freddy has been a really fun experience.
1814760	1819320	So on one hand, I say dark soccer, you did a great thing. But on the other hand,
1819320	1822280	I'm totally neglecting pyramid head, dark soccer, you did a bad thing.
1823960	1830360	Well, do you, do you have a, I don't know if it was a free one, but do you have the nurse?
1830360	1837080	I do have the nurse that I've played as the nurse. The nurse is hard because getting that blink down
1837080	1843560	is really hard. Look up a video that talks about toxic nurse build. And it's got like
1843560	1849960	something like five blinks on her. And it's pretty amazing. What about, what about the spirit?
1850760	1855560	I do not have the spirit, but I want to get the spirit because she has a similar mechanic
1855560	1861880	to the nurse. Well, Rob, I adore you. And I want to see you play the spirit as well. So
1861880	1864120	you're getting another five bucks. I won a prize.
1864920	1873960	Oh my gosh. This is me doing it right now. This is great. This is great. I love this. I love this.
1873960	1879320	Hey, Bobby black, open chat, free killers for Rob. That's right. Dark soccer buys me murderers.
1881080	1885000	Don't show my phone number on Twitch. I'm just kidding. Your phone number isn't on there. Just
1885000	1890600	says Rob. Okay. It's funny. For a moment. I was like, my phone doesn't recognize me.
1890600	1897880	I'm wearing makeup. All right. So awesome. I've actually, I've been actually watching, um,
1897880	1904600	killer gameplay. Um, and you know, I've watched, uh, my friend Nika play quite a bit now right now.
1904600	1909480	She's streaming, uh, phantasmophobia with a friend of hers. They wouldn't play together. Um,
1910280	1918200	but I have been really, uh, I got to see, um, the trickster. Oh, the new one, the K-pop guy. Yeah.
1918760	1923880	Yeah. His story's kind of cool with that little animation right at the beginning of his thing.
1923880	1928600	He's I like him conceptually. He's a great character, but everything I'm hearing is
1928600	1933880	that he's not a good killer in practice. So that's too bad. I've, I've actually seen people
1933880	1940520	do pretty effectively because he's, um, got this one. Uh, I've actually got to see his, uh, Maury,
1942120	1948120	which is pretty interesting, but he's got a really good long range attack as long as you remember to
1948840	1954360	your knives. Yeah. And it's, it's really good to get, uh, for hurting palette people. So like,
1954360	1958680	he must've been really fucked up when he got grabbed. Cause he looks normal.
1958680	1964120	You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. I spent like basically the last three days reading the Wiki.
1964120	1967960	Um, dark soccer. I I'll have to talk to Alan because I don't remember in the moment,
1967960	1973880	the streamer's name, but there is a streamer who almost exclusively streams nurse gameplay. And
1973960	1980360	Alan really likes this guy. Um, and, uh, he plays a lot of nurse gameplay and he's really good.
1980360	1983000	Uh, and he's a lot of fun to watch. Cause he's really funny.
1983000	1985400	Watching the nurse though, makes me really motion sick.
1986200	1989320	Oh yeah. Yeah. That's the other one with the blink.
1989320	1993160	Yeah. That's the other problem is that, um, I know you're not big on first person
1993160	1996600	and when you play killer, you have to do for it's part of it's actually,
1996600	2001000	it's part of the handicap that the killers get. They have to play first person so that their field
2001000	2005880	of view is limited. Whereas survivors, they have to play in third person so that they have more of
2005880	2011080	a view. It's very interesting. So I've been learning a lot about how the perks work and
2011080	2015000	I don't know. I still think I would have a more fun time with, with killer.
2016040	2018760	You just have to find one that works for you. There's probably one with motion that works
2018760	2024440	better for you. Uh, but I know that like, the one thing I know is that if I ever play a survivor,
2024440	2028920	then I'm going to need to have spine chill, I think. Oh yeah. So you know when they're coming?
2029480	2035960	Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I'm learning about it. I can't believe how my husband has really converted me
2035960	2039480	into a Dead by Daylight fan. I thought this would never happen. And I think some of you listeners
2039480	2044360	probably thought the same because I'm not big on scary movies, but I think the concept of Dead by
2044360	2050440	Daylight is great. I have a lot of fun with it, so I'll play more of it. But also in my gaming
2050440	2054840	week this week, I got super distracted by something I wasn't expecting to get distracted with. And that
2054840	2061240	was a, uh, surprise drop, uh, in No Man's Sky this week. They released their 15th patch called
2061240	2066920	Expeditions, uh, which adds this brand new mode to the game, which basically encourages you to
2066920	2072600	start over. Um, which it's like a mode that was made for me. It's, it's most similar to Diablo
2072600	2079720	3's Seasons mode, but this time the gag is that everybody starts on the same planet. Whereas
2079720	2083720	normally in No Man's Sky, it's very much the opposite. You're almost always alone because
2083720	2088040	the universe is big. You very rarely run into other people unless you want to run into them.
2088040	2092200	But this mode is very different. Everybody starts on the same planet and takes a very similar
2092200	2098600	journey. Um, they added to this a whole system where there are Twitch drops, uh, ever since,
2098600	2103960	so Thursday was the first day. So Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, there are
2103960	2108360	five unique days worth of Twitch drops. And the whole thing has been very motivating for me to,
2108920	2114680	I'm going to stream No Man's Sky. So sure enough, I streamed, I've streamed for the last four days
2114680	2118440	in a row on my personal channel over at Rob Roberts. And for those that know me and my
2118440	2122360	streaming habits, that's very unheard of, you know, the fact that I do this show once a week,
2122360	2127640	that's usually about all I can do for streaming. But this mode and this game has really motivated
2127640	2132840	me to do that for the last four days. And I will do one more tomorrow, uh, to cap off the Twitch
2132840	2139720	drops and that, and then I'll probably go back to, to sparingly playing the game on stream, uh,
2139720	2143240	to finish up the Expeditions mode. Cause I'm having a lot of fun. You have some different
2143240	2148520	goals, some different things to do, and I'm unlocking things slowly but surely and it's cool.
2148520	2155000	Um, yeah. Mr. Rhizos in chat says, I went back to No Man's Sky and wow, the new expansion is
2155000	2159160	really good. Yeah. The game, and you know, I'm sure this sounds like a broken record to what
2159160	2163720	a lot of people are saying online. The game is not what you remembered when it first came out.
2163720	2168680	It is completely like literally after they did that origins update and the next gen update,
2168680	2171880	it doesn't even look the same that it used to because they added so much stuff to different
2171880	2176200	planets. So, um, it is not the game you remember when it first came out. The team has done a great
2176200	2181160	job. Um, you know, uh, keeping that up and going. So, um, yeah, I've been having a lot of fun
2181160	2185160	streaming it. I've met some new streamers that way. A lot of people that are lurking for Twitch
2185160	2189400	drops and stuff. So it's fun. So, uh, tomorrow's the last day of that, but the expedition will
2189400	2193480	continue for the next two months. I'm just, I'm not going to stream it every day. I don't have
2193480	2199400	that much bandwidth. Um, especially as hopefully more and more of our real lives return with more
2199400	2204280	vaccines getting out there. I can actually go and see some people, um, that I haven't gotten to see
2204280	2209080	for over a year. Um, you know, as long as everybody's vaccinated and all that stuff. So,
2210040	2214680	I'm not expecting, I can keep the momentum of streaming No Man's Sky every day,
2214680	2218360	but it's been a fun, fun thing and a fun little diversion. So there is that. And of course,
2218360	2223800	Final Fantasy 14, cause I always play that game. So, uh, there is that. Speaking of vaccines real
2223800	2227640	quick, before we get into the rest of the news this week, I'm getting my second Moderna shot
2227640	2232440	next week. I don't know if I'm going to have side effects or not. Um, everybody's different. So I
2232440	2238200	may or may not be here for next week's show. Um, I may be here, but only pushing buttons. So next
2238200	2242680	week's show may be a little different. Uh, it all just depends on how my body takes to that second
2242680	2248840	Moderna shot. Um, but you know what? I'm happy to do it. Cause, uh, whatever side effects it brings
2248840	2253880	better than getting COVID and more importantly, uh, helps to stop the spread of COVID. So I'm
2253880	2260760	all about that. That's for sure. So, and you're doing a duty to society. Yes. And I'm happy.
2260760	2266840	I'm happy to, um, because duty then a duty. Yes. And, uh, you know, again, the nice thing is
2267400	2270760	I'm going to be fully vaccinated. Dark soccer is going to be fully vaccinated.
2270760	2275880	Loki's going to be fully vaccinated. So hypothetically, you know, in, in Mayesh,
2275880	2280520	we could come together again. Um, I would say, I think this is on last week's show when you
2280520	2284280	weren't here, dark soccer, I was saying that might be a really nice thing to do. And of course,
2284280	2287640	everything depends on what does the world look like? What are the numbers look like?
2287640	2292600	What does the County look like? But I was thinking for our anniversary in June, that would be a great
2292600	2298440	time to bring the show back together if, uh, if science allows for it. So cool.
2299720	2304440	We have to have a talk about certain things. All right. Sounds good. And Oh yeah. And Alan
2304440	2308680	still isn't vaccinated. So we have to make sure that is, uh, is taken care of too. So yeah. All
2308680	2314040	right. But I'm totally bringing my mic with me. Oh yeah. That yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We'll, uh, we'll
2314040	2318760	look at doing some of those changes. So, well, I'm sorry. Once I upgraded my mic, I'm like,
2318760	2325400	I can't go back. That's understandable. Uh, and I, Alan and I are still looking at possibly
2325400	2329560	getting a new space. Um, and those conversations are starting to escalate. Like we've talked to
2329560	2333160	some of the financial ends of things, not to spill all my business on the show, but it's,
2333160	2338440	it's moving. So, uh, stay tuned. We may not, I didn't say we'd come back to this space.
2339000	2344280	I just said we'd come back together. So we'll see what happens. All right. Moving on. Uh,
2344280	2348120	let's get into some gaming news. Loki, we will start with you. What else is going on in the
2348120	2355880	gaming world this week? So we had X-Box cloud now adding more games. So we just talked about
2355880	2361240	games past and there's always announcements with stuff being added to that. Well, now we're getting
2361240	2368760	some backwards compatible games being added to X cloud gaming as well. So, uh, some, you know,
2368760	2374520	not a whole lot initially, um, being added to it, but like some definitely good games. Uh,
2374520	2381160	so we have, for example, Banjo Kazooie, Banjo Tooie, Double Dragon Neon, Fable 2,
2381160	2387800	Fallout New Vegas, Gears of War 2, 3, and Judgment, uh, Cameo, Perfect Dark, Perfect Dark
2387800	2395240	Zero, The Elder Scrolls 3, Morrowind. Um, we have also Oblivion, Viva Piñata, Viva Piñata, um,
2395320	2404680	TIP, and also looks like Jetpack Refueled. So those are being added as well. Um, and I guess
2404680	2408360	more is going to be coming as soon as they get more backwards compatible games working with the
2408360	2413560	service, but that's still pretty cool that they're adding that to the initial offerings that they had
2413560	2420280	already. Um, I can't wait to see what else gets added to it. You know, this has started a whole
2420280	2425240	conversation about, um, Microsoft kind of embracing backwards compatibility. I think
2425240	2430280	the way many of us wish Sony and Nintendo would do more often, although you can't say they're not
2430280	2436440	doing anything because, you know, Sony does have PlayStation now, uh, Nintendo does have that for
2436440	2441000	better or for worse, their classics library that you get through switch online and all that. But
2441000	2445720	I think many people are kind of looking at what Microsoft's doing and going, they're really doing
2445720	2450600	it the best. Like this is, you know, what gamers want. That's, you know, what they're really able
2450600	2456920	to do over there. Although it's also important to point out, um, Microsoft, uh, their entire library
2456920	2460200	is not backwards compatible. I was just talking about this on the stream today. Somebody was
2460200	2466520	asking questions about it. Um, but, uh, like DDR, you know, a game that we all love, the, uh, Xbox
2466520	2472760	ultra mixes and universe games. So ultra mix from, uh, the OG Xbox and universe from the 360,
2472760	2476200	those games are not backwards compatible, uh, which is a bummer. They were great. In fact,
2476200	2481080	the ultra mix too, is my favorite DDR mix they ever did. Um, can't play it backwards compatible.
2481080	2485320	Um, so that's a bummer. I don't know if that's a music licensing thing. It shouldn't be.
2486040	2489640	I don't know if it's the music licensing thing, but I don't know how much of this,
2489640	2495320	you know, it's probably also up to like, say the publisher as well, whether these games get put on
2495320	2500600	there. Oh, so we need Konami to agree to something. I see. I'm wondering if that might be some of the
2500600	2504600	case with that. Cause if you think about it, if they're re-releasing it again, then I mean,
2504600	2509080	it wouldn't necessarily be re-released, but like you'd have these games being able to work again.
2509080	2512840	And also maybe it might be a problem with, you know, not having support for these older
2513480	2517480	dance paths and stuff. Although I think that the Xbox is pretty good about,
2517480	2522040	you know, supporting, especially a lot of those physical USB devices. Um,
2522040	2526840	Bobby is pointing out no games with specialized controllers are backwards compatible, but
2526840	2533400	DDR didn't require the dance pad play button, button revolution. Um, you know, obviously it
2533400	2537320	kind of defeats the purpose of the game, but there were many people that were quite satisfied just
2537320	2542040	playing button, button revolution. So there's also people that were, you know, if, if they really
2542040	2548040	wanted to play those games on there, I mean, they would find a way to modify something to get it to
2548040	2552920	work with the Xbox. Yeah. They would modify a controller, hook it up that way. So I don't
2552920	2557640	think that would necessarily stop people. Yeah. And the game, the game would actually like,
2557640	2562120	I remember when you play the Xbox one online, it would actually show if you were on a controller
2562120	2567160	or a dance pad and some people would hack it to make the controller show up like dance pads and
2567160	2571880	all that silly stuff. But they knew that controller was a way you could play it. And so they did kind
2571880	2578600	of embrace that, I suppose. So did any of those games support connect? Because I know that's
2578600	2584360	a thing that wouldn't be supported, obviously. Well, itoy was a thing. I remember that.
2584360	2590600	I remember that. Yeah. I don't remember if connect was a thing in one of the later universe games or
2590600	2596600	not. Um, I, I don't know if you, uh, Bahmani nerds in chat remember that clearly. Um,
2599480	2605400	maybe not. I don't remember, uh, orange ride and chat points out licensing issues with the licenses
2605400	2610520	and some Konami originals, Konami, Hawaii, no longer existing DDR pads, not compatible.
2610520	2615400	That's a good point about Konami. Hawaii isn't even around anymore. Unfortunately. Uh,
2615400	2622600	they were a great, uh, division and we miss them. Um, so yeah, I thought one of the later universe
2622600	2628600	is supported connect, but I could be wrong because I think instead Konami did that spinoff series.
2628600	2634520	Remember that had the two pair of songs in it. Um, dance, dance evolution. That was, yeah,
2634520	2639240	dance evolution. Yeah. Orange right says beaten groovy is backwards compatible.
2639800	2644200	Gross. They should un-backwards compatible it do us all a favor and say, you know,
2644200	2649640	we've decided to remove this from backwards compatibility. So there is that is rock
2649640	2656200	revolution. Good backwards compatible. Oh, the rhythm, the rhythm party. There was another,
2656200	2664760	there was a D download game that was also, um, connect and that's all I remember. Hmm. Yeah.
2665720	2671000	All right. Anyway, enough about that. I don't know how we got onto DDR from Xbox cloud gaming,
2671000	2675160	but you know, eh, it's a, it's a series we we've loved for a long time here at OLR. What can we
2675160	2682200	say? Uh, act deaf. I'm so with you. You know what I miss rock band blitz 100%. Probably. I almost
2682200	2686040	want that game to be backwards compatible more so than anything else we've just talked about.
2686600	2691400	Um, especially with the large rock band library I've accumulated over the years.
2691400	2698360	It's unfortunate. All right. Uh, anyway, let's move on. And, uh, some confirmation came in on
2698360	2704120	something we had talked about being a rumor just last week. Uh, but it is true. Sony is going to
2704120	2709080	be closing the PlayStation three and the Vita stores. Um, and that is all going to be, uh,
2709080	2715160	starting in July. Um, and so, uh, the PlayStation three online store will be closing on July 2nd.
2715160	2719800	The Vita store will be closing on August 27th. Um, you are not going to be able to
2719800	2725960	purchase digital media from those stores. However important you can re download anything you've
2725960	2731080	already purchased. My excuse me, my assumption is that would include PlayStation plus titles
2731080	2736920	for what it's worth because you kind of bought those. So, um, there is a FAQ that gets into some
2736920	2743000	detail. The first one says you will still be able to re download and play previous purchase games,
2743000	2749160	as well as video and media content. You can still redeem game and PlayStation plus vouchers.
2749160	2754040	You can still re download and play game claimed game titles through PlayStation plus,
2754040	2757080	like I was mentioning there, as long as you remain a member of the service,
2757080	2762200	but you will no longer be able to purchase content, including games and video content.
2762200	2769080	You can no longer make in-game purchases. So any DLC you want, you better get it. And you will no
2769080	2773560	longer be able to redeem PlayStation network, wallet fund vouchers on PlayStation three,
2773560	2778520	Vita or PSP devices, but you can do that in a PlayStation four or PlayStation five.
2779800	2785800	So that's it it's going away. And to kind of follow up with that conversation on who's doing
2785800	2791720	backwards compatibility better. I think some of the sad news there is that the rich library of
2791720	2797400	PlayStation one games that you could download on the PlayStation three is going away. And I think
2797400	2803800	of things like Suikoden one and two, right? Those games were known as PlayStation collectors items.
2803800	2808840	It was a big fucking deal when those showed up on PlayStation three. And now people are no longer
2808840	2814760	going to be able to buy them anywhere. They can re download it. But if you don't claim that to
2814760	2819960	your cart, you know, in the next few months, you you're not you'll have to try to find it's
2819960	2824360	going to make the physical copies go up again in price, I'm sure. But, you know,
2824360	2832680	that's just some of many examples. So. Unfortunate that that is closing, but at the same time,
2832680	2836840	it's a reality of the digital storefront, right? Like we knew this was going to happen eventually.
2837640	2844600	Someday, the PlayStation four shop will close the Xbox one. It's we're all kind of surprised.
2844600	2849320	Wii U hasn't closed yet, although it's probably I think it did in other countries. So I think this
2849400	2855320	came up on another show and hasn't as not quite happened in America yet. S.J. 100 Mountain Chat
2855320	2860040	says it's like who is doing game preservation better? Microsoft gets it. I wish Sony did.
2860040	2863480	You know, there was a very interesting comment or might have been a headline on one of the big game
2863480	2872280	blogs that said something like Microsoft should be doing their own version of Sony's video on
2872280	2877640	this is how easy it is to trade games. You remember that E3? You remember that E3 when Sony
2877640	2881880	pretty much punched Microsoft in the face on stage with all their videos and their very
2881880	2886760	tongue in cheek thing. And it was like, here's how to trade a game on PlayStation four. And they go
2886760	2891160	and they hand the game because it was when that whole conversation about digital only was
2891160	2896760	happening and Microsoft was losing that battle. That's for sure. Some are arguing that Microsoft
2896760	2901240	should put out a response video now about backwards compatibility. Like here's how you
2901240	2906840	play an old title on your Xbox and just drop the disk in. So, yeah, maybe they will. I mean,
2906840	2911160	it also, I don't really know how that necessarily helps them aside of
2911800	2915000	getting it spread around through social media. I mean,
2917080	2922280	I don't know. Yeah, it'd be fun to see that happen. But now's all the time to do that.
2923000	2927400	Bobby is reminding us to that whole video got the crowd going because it was five minutes
2927400	2932200	before they announced they were charging for online play. That was brilliant. Nobody noticed.
2932200	2938920	I think, too, people were well, people were expecting Sony to go that direction, too.
2938920	2944040	I think everybody was kind of surprised Sony wasn't, but Sony definitely softened the blow
2944040	2948600	with that. You know what I mean? And I think also the other big deal they came in and announced
2948600	2952440	their console was one hundred bucks cheaper. That was the other huge deal that they were talking
2952440	2958920	about right before that whole thing. So there's that. So. All right. Anyway, let's move on. Other
2958920	2968040	gaming news. Dark Sakura. Well, you know, hackers going to hack, right? Well, as it looks as it
2968040	2975320	turns out, it looks like hackers are going to get caught, too. So authorities in China seized about
2975320	2984760	seventy six million dollars worth of assets, along with cars and other goods from a. From a company
2984840	2989880	selling cheating software for some best selling games, including Call of Duty and Overwatch.
2992040	2998440	Basically, because e-sports has become such a source of revenue for the country,
2999720	3005800	they're finally starting to crack down on the impact it's having on competitive gaming.
3006520	3014440	So. There I mean, these are companies that like have websites with shopping carts and price lists
3014440	3022920	and customer service. I mean, they're like, you know, Amazon for hackers. So they're bringing in,
3022920	3032360	I mean, some of these people make seven digits. A year. So, I mean, think about that.
3032360	3035480	It just goes to show how many people want to cheat in these games, too.
3036440	3045640	Yeah, for sure. It's just. I you know, the thing is, is that with this whole situation.
3047640	3058520	I really I mean. I understand why it's attractive to people, because, you know, it's
3059960	3063640	not everyone is going to have the same reflexes that a pro gamer is going to have,
3063640	3071800	just, you know, facts or facts. Right. I think the the big thing that people need to remember
3072600	3081160	is that it's like doping. Right. Or taking steroids. This is the virtual equivalent of it.
3082920	3090840	And now, while Japan isn't as close to, say, China and South Korea for their e-sports
3090840	3101240	presence, they've had a hotel open called Hotel Ezone. It was open in Osaka and they
3101800	3108360	had people check in, play all the time, but they've already caught three cheaters like
3108360	3115160	right when they opened the hotel. So they're really just cracking down on it everywhere.
3116280	3120440	You know, especially with a lot of things moving online in this whole situation,
3120600	3126120	I think some people might be cheating to try to get forward in some of the stuff because
3126120	3129640	some of the cash prizes and things like that. And you don't necessarily have to show up to
3129640	3136120	do it in person right now. So I think that's the comparison to doping is very interesting.
3136120	3141160	That's kind of what it is. It is. I mean, it's basically doing something to give yourself an
3141160	3148840	unfair advantage over the other competitors. And that is all it is. So it's exactly like that,
3148840	3157560	you know. Yeah, but with that, though, I would expect them to handle that within whatever bracket
3157560	3163560	or tournament circuit that they're in and not necessarily... I don't think people should be
3163560	3169000	arrested for cheating. That's kind of weird. But the ones that are being arrested are the
3169000	3173160	enablers, the ones selling the illegal tools. Yeah.
3173160	3177000	So basically... Who's saying they're illegal? The game companies?
3177080	3180280	China. I mean, the laws are different. China? Fine.
3181160	3187000	But keep in mind, esports is managed, I would reckon, very similarly to how professional
3187000	3194040	sports is managed. And so there are certain things that are going to be... And keep in mind,
3194040	3200680	their laws are maybe more stringent than they might be here. But I would think that because
3200680	3205000	it is such a major source of revenue for the country that they do have laws around it.
3205000	3207560	I would kind of... Well, that's fair. Yeah.
3207560	3211640	Yeah, because I would compare it to like, why did Martha Stewart go to jail?
3211640	3213240	You know, there was that whole... Because she's a woman.
3216280	3219720	I don't mean to laugh, but... She's a woman and she got caught.
3219720	3225640	I get it. But on paper, the reason was it was the insider trading and all that stuff,
3225640	3231160	right? Things to do with the stock market. And like here, you guys know that if you do insider
3231160	3236120	trading and that seedy stuff for the stock market, you can absolutely go to jail for that stuff.
3236120	3242120	Well, the stock market is our big money thing. In China, esports... Not to make a direct
3242120	3246760	comparison, but it is a money generating... And what is happening here with this cheat stuff,
3246760	3251720	it's a version, I guess, of insider trading. So I think that's why I'm kind of trying to explain
3251720	3256520	to Loki, I think kind of like what it is and why these folks are getting targeted and going to
3256520	3261080	jail. They aren't arresting the cheaters, as far as I know, anyway. They're arresting the people
3261080	3267320	that are selling these things to enable cheating so that the whole system can be messed with,
3267320	3272280	I guess. Yeah, but that's the equivalent though of like, once again, arresting the gun manufacturers
3272280	3278120	when somebody kills somebody with a gun. Like, I think that they should... Fine. If you're gonna
3278120	3283720	have laws in your country to arrest people developing these tools, then arrest the people
3283720	3287880	using these tools. I think that they should be arrested then, if that's what we're gonna do.
3287880	3291000	But if this were to happen, say, in the United States or something like that,
3291960	3296360	I think we have some serious problems, because really, we're having game companies dictate
3296360	3303240	that cheating in an online game is illegal. That's stupid. I get it. That's against terms of service
3303240	3307800	or something like that. But we're gonna arrest you and seize millions of dollars of assets?
3307960	3309080	That seems a little weird.
3309080	3315560	I don't think anyone would be arrested, but I wanna say we've had stories about civil lawsuits.
3315560	3320920	Didn't we have something where Blizzard sued some people that were making a Warcraft gold farmer?
3320920	3326520	And we have civil lawsuits. So there is a punishment to pay. It's just different, I guess.
3326520	3330120	Right. And there has to be civil lawsuits because they don't have laws on the books to actually
3330120	3335720	dictate them not to do that. But I guess you could get with reverse engineering copyright theft or
3335720	3341560	something like that. But I think... I guess it being in China, that makes sense because
3341560	3344840	their laws may be different. But I can't see that happening over here.
3345560	3347800	No, but I could see the civil thing happening.
3347800	3350280	Yeah. That's totally different though.
3350280	3355480	Yeah. So, all right. Well, let's move on. Loki, you have the next story.
3356280	3362920	Yeah. So we have Nexon actually investing in some of these Japanese companies.
3363240	3368120	Some of which I don't know if they're... Not necessarily stating that they're planning on
3368120	3376120	acquiring them or something like that, but they've invested $1.5 billion within Konami, Bandai Namco,
3376120	3382280	Sega Sammy, and Hasbro. Apparently, they said that they believe in these companies because they have
3382280	3387000	well-managed global IPs. So it sounds like they're talking about their IPs because I know Konami sure
3387000	3391720	as hell isn't making any games. At least none recently.
3391800	3395080	Bomberman. Super duper Bomberman.
3395080	3398200	Bomberman and the shitty Contra sequel that they made.
3401640	3409240	Or Pacheesh slots. I guess there's that too. But anyways, so right now they've invested quite a
3409240	3413640	bit of money into those companies. Like I said, I don't know if they're necessarily hoping to
3414920	3420600	acquire one of these at some point, but you never know. I guess we'll see. I could see
3420600	3426200	Konami being sold to somebody at some point soon. I feel like we write that fanfic every
3426200	3434280	month on this show about who's going to buy Konami. Because we all want to see those great IPs
3434280	3439960	like DDR, sweet code and Castlevania, Silent Hill, those things they've built up over the
3439960	3444440	years. We want to see somebody do something with them that's not a slot machine. Now,
3445080	3448680	as much as we joke about Pacheesh slots and slot machines, I think we have to realize that is
3448680	3452520	Konami's business now, whether you like it or not, that's where they're making money.
3453160	3456920	And that's always going to be the thing. But I think there's also like that can be separated,
3456920	3460600	I think, from the other types of home entertainment, hence why there used to be a
3460600	3467080	case set. And I would think that some of that could get sold off or something. I don't know
3467080	3471240	if Nexon's the company that gets me excited about because that makes me think mobile phone.
3471880	3474920	Silent Hill sent to be a mobile phone game.
3475960	3480040	Well, Konami's interested in mobile games. They had a lot of them. I mean,
3480040	3484280	I it seems like now they're taking a lot of their like, especially their music games
3484280	3488360	and trying to develop like some sort of subscription service model for like PC.
3488360	3492840	And here's the thing. I'm not knocking mobile games like one thing that somehow didn't make
3492840	3496440	our show world tonight. I don't know how, but I'll bring it up here. We have this whole thing
3496440	3500760	about Niantic put out another demo for AR gaming, right, where people were all fighting in the park.
3500760	3503960	And, you know, there was it wasn't Pokemon related or anything was like an original thing.
3503960	3508680	And then they showed that they showed that picture of their like the glasses. They were
3508680	3513320	teasing the Niantic glasses and all that. Right. So that's a whole like, you know,
3514760	3519800	are we getting another Ingress? I don't. Well, who knows? Could Ingress be something that is
3519800	3524440	played with the glasses? It's the original concept videos for the game sure made it look like that.
3524440	3529240	But I'm not I'm not even concerned with that right now. My point is, is that mobile gaming,
3529240	3535080	when things are specifically made for mobile is fine, you know, and Niantic is a great company at
3535080	3539960	doing that. You know, that's why Pokemon Go is successful. When mobile, in my opinion, isn't or
3539960	3545000	that game that Dark Soccer always talks about that word scapes that was made for mobile, it was mobile
3545000	3551640	in mind. But when you shoehorn Silent Hill into a mobile phone, it doesn't work. None of those like
3551640	3556840	things that get shoot Sonic the Hedgehog playing it on mobile. It's cute for a minute, but it
3556840	3561800	doesn't it doesn't work. Like so that's that's why I'm kind of like, there needs to be a division
3561800	3567560	there. You know, is the game for mobile or is it not? Anyway. Now Quest Buster is saying in
3567560	3573640	perspective over at twitch.tv slash vog network. Nexon is the third largest gaming company in Asia.
3573640	3579080	Only Tencent and Netease are larger. So that's true. They are a very large company. I guess I
3579080	3584680	can't help but think of that story last week about Final Fantasy 11 going bye bye. But anyway,
3585400	3590920	as she says, when you port, say, Chrono Trigger on mobile, you ruin it. Yes, it's just it's not
3590920	3596440	the same. But anyway, I'm digressing a little bit. So if they're investing in game companies
3596440	3601960	to maybe try to do something, they're investing in a lot of companies. So it's it's interesting.
3601960	3605640	I don't know if that is to try to push more of that. So I'm just kind of curious what their
3605640	3609960	long term strategy is here. Is it a lot of money? One point five billion. They probably could have
3609960	3615800	flat out bought one of these companies for that much money, honestly. But they didn't. So we'll
3615800	3622920	see. All right, moving on. So last week we had the stories about Discord and Microsoft. Could
3622920	3627960	Microsoft be buying Discord? Well, we don't know the answer to that yet. But this is a very
3627960	3635800	interesting time to update is that Discord will work on your Xbox Series X. OK, there's there's
3635800	3643240	some catches here. It's not official. What it is, is that the Edge browser that is used on the
3643240	3649480	Xbox Series X, if you may or may not know, the Microsoft Edge browser now adapts some of the
3649480	3655240	chromium technology into it, as in Chrome. Right. Because all that's open source. So a lot of that
3655240	3662120	is built into Edge now. So the Edge browser on Xbox Series X, if you actually go to Discord
3662760	3667080	with the new tech, you have to get the test build of Edge that has the chromium built into it.
3667080	3674520	If you go to Discord, you can actually use the web based Discord. You can use text chat,
3674520	3680200	you can even join calls, but the mic input won't work yet. So you can't fully participate with
3680200	3687560	Discord. So that is kind of an interesting little thing people are noticing just after we have this
3687560	3692520	conversation about Discord and Microsoft. I'm sure if that were to happen, we would see an
3692520	3697640	official Discord app that runs in the background and does allow you to talk, show up on Microsoft
3697640	3704360	pretty quickly. And I think this just shows how fast that could happen. So if Microsoft does
3704360	3710600	buy Discord, I would expect the week that it's cleared, meaning, you know, the regulators all
3710600	3716600	clear and all that stuff. We have a full on Discord app on Xbox. But again, we don't even
3716600	3720520	know if that's the direction Discord's going. Discord may go with one of their other suitors.
3720520	3725800	I believe we heard Amazon was in the mix. Discord may still go public. This is just one of those
3725800	3731960	isn't that funny slash cute that came up right after the whole talk last week.
3732920	3737640	Dejirom S says it's still on test build on Xbox Series X. I think the browser is.
3738360	3743800	I'm not sure if that actually rolled out to everybody yet. So we'll see. All right,
3743800	3748040	let's move on. Dark Sakura, some interesting E3 rumors, yeah?
3748760	3754280	Yeah, it was floating around that E3 was going to put some of their content behind a paywall,
3754280	3766200	like to have a premium package for $35. But of course, after the statement was issued,
3767080	3773720	ESA actually went back and said, oh, no, the quote says I can confirm on behalf of the ESA
3773720	3779320	that there will be no elements of E3 2021 that will be behind a paid for pass or paywall.
3781000	3788680	That didn't say anything about next year. But they are still pushing toward a digital event
3789640	3797320	this year in light of everything going on. So we're going to wait and see. I mean,
3799560	3802440	I really do hope that it stays virtual for like ever.
3804360	3807320	But I understand what the attraction was to have it in person.
3808120	3812200	It would be nice to have a little column A, a little column B. I would argue that E3 was
3812200	3817160	already virtual for a lot of people. You know, like, you know, I stopped going to the show years
3817160	3823080	ago and there was I distinctly remember there was a year I took the few days off work and just
3823080	3828840	I was I think it might have been actually. I think it was the year it was Bobby's last
3828840	3833560	year at E3, because I don't think we actually went or got in, but I seem to remember I was
3833560	3839240	watching it on TV and then I think you were with me, Jamie. We drove down the last day
3840920	3845080	or I don't know if it was separately or together or what happened, and we like picked Bobby up and
3845080	3847880	we went to Disneyland. We did.
3847880	3853240	Because I feel like that was the night that we were talking about Vogue and all that stuff.
3853240	3856040	Or maybe that I might be blurring my years together a little bit.
3856680	3861560	I kind of have a memory of that, though. Yeah. But my point is, I remember there was
3861560	3865800	a year where I was home watching it for two days and then I went down there and I was there in
3865800	3871240	person the last day, although I wasn't really in E3. Like I sat in the lobby the whole time and
3871240	3873960	waited for Bobby or you or something. I don't know.
3876120	3880280	Now, Bobby points out being in person is great for networking. That is true,
3881080	3885480	although I would say a society over the past year has also learned how to adapt some of that
3885480	3891720	to virtual. But not to dismiss the point, because I think there is certainly a lot about in-person
3891720	3896040	gatherings as well. I think the best solution is going to be a mix of both.
3896040	3901400	But I would argue E3 was already virtual for many people. Most people are consuming E3,
3901400	3904600	the press conferences and everything, media briefings, whatever they're called,
3905480	3908680	Nintendo Directs. We're watching them in the comfort of their own home on their computer
3908680	3912280	and all that stuff. The way people were getting the news out of that was virtual.
3912280	3916440	But the people who needed a network, the people who needed to talk to the retail people to help
3916440	3920440	get the games on the shelves, they were all down there in person doing what they needed to do.
3920440	3927400	But I think it's funny. You kind of made that little joke that they didn't say anything about
3927400	3934280	next year. Maybe there will be a more official half and half thing in upcoming years. Who knows?
3934280	3934920	We can hope.
3935640	3944120	Yeah. I agree that June is a little soon. I still feel like so much is to be determined
3944120	3948360	where this is really going to go and how the variants mess things up and how the vaccines
3948360	3952680	take to it. And I feel like June is when we're going to get the answers to that.
3952680	3956040	And then the rest of the year will play out one way or the other. You know what I mean?
3956600	3961160	Yeah. I think that it's really going to be just a matter of
3964200	3969160	I think vaccination rates and whatnot, if it's going to be safe. Because right now, I mean,
3969800	3975960	we don't have the vaccination rates right now, but it's still going to be free for this year,
3975960	3980360	at least. Yeah. And they're going fast. They hit a new record with vaccinations yesterday.
3980360	3984360	And originally they were talking about a million vaccines a day, and now they're up to 3 million
3984360	3989400	a day. So that's great news. So fingers and toes crossed, because it would be very lovely if
3990440	3996680	come back to school season, we're able to get some sense of normalcy, but we'll see. We'll see.
3996680	4002760	I'm not going to put the cart before the horse. We'll see what happens. All right. So let's move
4002760	4012840	on. Loki, what do you have for us? All right. So Apple Arcade is getting expanded quite a bit.
4012840	4018600	And there is actually some pretty cool games on the list here that are coming out with it. So
4019240	4023240	they have 30 new games. I'm just going to cut you off and talk about Fantasian,
4023240	4027480	because that is the only one that matters, in my opinion. That is a huge deal.
4028280	4034680	Okay. No, there are others. But that Fantasian is like, that's the one that's tempting me. But
4035640	4041800	I did not realize that it was limited. I always thought it was just for the mobile phone. I did
4041800	4050120	not realize that Apple Arcade was something that worked with the Macs and Apple TV. So honestly,
4050120	4057160	if I hadn't just upgraded my watch two weeks ago, I should have bought an Apple TV so I could play
4057160	4061720	Fantasia. I guess I could always do it on this Mac we do the show from. But this is the show's
4061720	4068840	Mac. It's not my Mac. It'll run it with no problem. I'm tempted. I'm tempted. I want to
4068840	4073240	play that Fantasian. But anyway, sorry, Loki. You had something more? I'm sorry.
4073880	4080840	No. So yeah, they had Fantasian was added in there as well. They have Hotshots. They have a,
4080840	4087640	was it Monument Valley threes? Looks like a Hotshots golf game, or it's a game like
4087640	4094040	Hotshots golf called Clap Hands Golf. But I mean, basically Hotshots golf. As I mentioned,
4094040	4103320	the Oregon Trail, they have NBA 2K21 Arcade, which ironically is probably the best version of NBA 2K21
4103320	4108600	considering that there are no loot boxes in it. So already improved over the console version.
4109080	4116760	And then some other classics of Fruit Ninja, Monument Valley, Don't Starve, stuff like that.
4116760	4123320	So lots of big games coming. And yeah, that's pretty cool. Interesting timing. I would have
4123320	4127800	expected something like this closer to like that holiday season. Not that I'm complaining. I just,
4127800	4133800	it's interesting that this is happening now out of all times in the year. So well, financial years
4133800	4139080	are usually up at the end of March. So okay. I mean, fair, fair. Could be a fiscal year thing.
4139080	4146120	You're right. You're right. Yeah. Okay. Cool. All right. Moving on. Let's talk about the Xbox Series
4146120	4153880	X and the mini fridges that they're making. That is, that is what it really is. So there was some
4153880	4158440	big refrigerators, I think that went out just a couple of them. Yeah. Yeah. It's like a promotional
4158440	4163320	thing some time ago. I remember that was being a thing. Yeah. It's like, I know Snoop Dogg got one.
4163960	4169080	I can't remember who the other two were, though. So here's the thing here. So yeah, this, this
4169080	4175400	caught fire online, the concept of an Xbox fridge. And then it just took the weirdest turn. So Aaron
4175400	4183640	Greenberg with Microsoft promised official Xbox Series X mini fridges if Microsoft won a Twitter
4183640	4189080	brand competition. And sure enough, the gamers came through, they won that, you know, you guys
4189080	4196040	know, like Wendy's, right? And all these brands that, you know, talk like people online. I don't
4196040	4201000	know. All I know is that Steakums was not in the running. And that seems like a glaring omission to
4201000	4204600	me. I don't know. Or maybe I read the chart wrong. Maybe they were in the running. They just didn't
4204600	4210440	make the finals. I was just very surprised Steakums wasn't there. But anyway, Microsoft was there and
4210440	4215720	they won the whole thing. So Aaron Greenberg is living up to his promise and they will be making
4215720	4220840	Xbox Series X fridges. We don't know when. We don't know how much. We don't know what they
4220840	4225640	look like because we've only seen the big ones that Snoop Dogg got. But we do know the very
4225640	4232360	first one will be going to Skittles, who is the runner up in the competition. And now we know what
4232360	4239720	green Skittles tastes like. Ground up Xboxes. They had some weird like, like, commercial, like,
4239720	4247320	April Fool's jokes. Like the one I saw was it was it 311 and 711 switched Twitter handles for
4247320	4253160	a while. That was kind of interesting. But yeah, lots of lots of weird stuff like that.
4253800	4258040	Well, that was all April Fool's stuff, right? Because, yeah, that happened. I forgot as much
4258040	4263640	as I thought April Fool's Day was canceled during the pandemic because we do not have the bandwidth
4263640	4268200	for April Fool's right now. And it actually seems like for the most part, most companies kind of
4268200	4272760	behave themselves like there was no, you know, like you might have the cute switching of the
4272760	4279480	Twitter accounts. What's his name that's famous for his gap teeth look, lied and said he was
4279480	4285560	fixing it and then it was April Fool's. OK, whatever. Favorite one. Well, aside from the
4285560	4289560	other one I posted, there's a favorite video I had that I posted on Twitter. But my favorite
4289960	4296280	joke, which is actually a product you can download, is micro or it's Microsoft's
4296280	4304600	Minecraft plus and Minecraft plus is a series of screen savers that resemble the Microsoft
4304600	4309800	Windows 95 screensavers. But it's all Minecraft themed. Love it. It's fantastic.
4311720	4317240	Microsoft is saying and Aaron Greenberg, this is not an April Fool's joke. The series X fridges
4317960	4324680	will be happening. So joy, oh, joy. So now you have the place. We're not famous enough to get
4324680	4329320	one. You have the place. Well, we could we could buy one if we wanted. I just you know,
4329320	4335960	there's a lot of things that money could buy. I know. All right. Like I have an actual fridge
4335960	4341480	that has room for stuff in it and it's new. Well, but you could get a mini fridge to put your
4341480	4346760	alcohol in and your weed and whatever else you want to put in a mini fridge. You want to know
4346840	4353080	what's funny? What is it? Midna's cat food is refrigerated because she has the semi semi raw.
4353080	4358120	So is His Highness Smoosh. Yes. Yeah. The fresh pet. I'll go ahead and just say.
4359000	4362600	And I was joking to Dan because I keep forgetting to put the food back in the fridge
4363160	4367720	that we should just have a mini fridge in the bathroom where where I feed the cat.
4368520	4377720	Brilliant. Yeah, I smart her. DJ Rama says, so you saw what's in Snoop Dogg's Xbox fridge? I
4378680	4381000	Rama, nobody has to look to know what's in the fridge.
4382360	4386600	You don't store that in the fridge. It's Snoop Dogg's brand of wine. Yeah, you don't.
4387720	4396120	And his own wacky weed. Right. Moving on. Speaking of wacky, I love this segment. Every week on the
4396120	4401400	show, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you guys
4401400	4406280	should be checking this game out. But you guys see it on Twitch. And I told you earlier in the podcast
4406280	4414040	it's not a classic game this week. In a 2021 twist, Dark Sakura's making it weird. And she's
4414040	4420600	picking a fucking weird arcade game or a flag. So that is a fucking weird arcade game every month.
4420600	4427160	And this month she's picked the game where I'm like, you you cannot do this segment Dark Sakura
4427160	4432120	and not do this arcade game. This is when everybody thinks of a flag. This is the one
4432120	4437640	they're thinking of for sure. So let's get it out of the way here in April. So that way we get
4439960	4442360	we won't be asking the rest of the year. Where is this?
4443320	4446760	I'm doing the most the most accessible one on my birthday month.
4447400	4451320	A good call. So what is this month's flag for those that may not know?
4452280	4457880	Cho Chabudai Gaishi or Super Dinner Table Flipping.
4460520	4468040	So it's an arcade game developed and published by Taito where you pound your hands on the table and
4468040	4478600	flip it when you're pissed. So now I have to do a little bit of rewinding on this one.
4478600	4486600	It is actually based off of a Japanese idiom that's like the dad flipping the table angrily.
4486600	4494600	And this was even referenced one time by Aonuma Eiji, you know,
4496760	4502680	the Legend of Zelda producer. He said that Miyamoto would sometimes come into the game
4502680	4508040	design teams and disrupt the whole production if he didn't think the game was going well to start
4508040	4515720	over. And Aonuma likened this to the dad flipping the tea table over, you know, putting everything
4515720	4522600	in disarray. But at any rate, the way that this game works is that you start a scenario,
4522600	4530040	you have like a little plastic table in front of you. And you can pound on the table with your
4530040	4539080	hands to get the family's attention and knock things over. But as you get things to fall on
4539080	4547080	the floor, you get more points. And then when this game's timer, 60 second timer, hits the end,
4547880	4554280	then you grab the table and flip it. It has hinges that keeps it attached to the machine.
4554840	4560520	So you have four different scenarios. You have the dad with his kids. You have a bride at the
4560520	4572840	wedding, a guest at a host club, and a frustrated office worker. But the thing is, is that
4574040	4579560	it really I think would have a challenge as to how such a simple mechanic that you're going to do
4580360	4590360	every time can make it unique for each scenario. And so they did do different things to kind of
4590360	4599880	build up the moment to make it more dynamic as it happened. You know, you have a karaoke while
4599880	4605560	you're table flipping, you know, kind of interesting stuff. And the game itself was
4605560	4614760	actually popular enough to have a sequel, of course, Chō Chabudai Gaeshi 2, where they've
4614840	4620200	added three more scenarios, including a ghost from a dead man at his own funeral who will turn
4620200	4629800	over his own coffin. Of course, that one was only out in Japan. So the game was released in Japan,
4629800	4642680	fall 2009. It came out worldwide in 2010, published by IGS. And it's funny, it's got
4642680	4650760	some different reviews. But Jim Sterling from Destructoid basically called said,
4650760	4658600	it's basically the best game ever. That is a quote. It was also in 2017, Gerald Lynch from
4658600	4665960	Tech Radar put it on his list of top 50 best arcade games. That it was basically an absolutely
4665960	4673640	crazy concept, didn't deserve to be on the list, even if it wasn't the best game. And so there you
4673640	4684760	go. It is Chō Chabudai Gaeshi, which translates to super dinner table flipping. All right. Wow,
4684760	4689400	I wasn't prepared for you to be done so fast. I'm trying to do my own snack over here before
4689400	4696040	there's not really too much more to say that. And I'm sorry, the only video that I could find was
4696040	4701080	live video of it. So no, it's fine. I just killed the sound on the one that's playing it. We're
4701080	4704360	looking at the second. So we saw the trailer and now we're looking at the guy who's actually
4704360	4710200	playing it in the arcade. Oh, it just looped back to the trailer video. But yeah, I killed the sound
4710200	4714280	on the trailer because there's too much like a loud arcade. But I think a lot of you guys
4714280	4718120	have probably seen this somewhere because I know a lot of conventions will bring this game in.
4718120	4723800	I know MagFest for sure did the fundraiser where they would set up a real table. But one would say
4723800	4728520	it's inspired by this game where they set up like a real table that you could put plastic
4728520	4736920	wear on and flip for a small fee. So if you were in Northern California, there is one in San
4736920	4744280	Francisco in Japantown Center. Well, if that place made it through the pandemic, I hope.
4745160	4755000	Well, yeah, but if so, there was one there. Of course, I played it a couple of times. It's
4755000	4765320	cute. And then I would just go back and play bishi bashi or popin music. But it definitely deserves
4765320	4770520	to be on the list. You know, I think it's kind of the one that everyone first thinks of this and,
4770520	4775480	you know, Booga Booga. Yeah. All right. Well, there it is. By the way, fucking weird arcade
4775480	4780920	game of the month. Say the name one more time. Our soccer. I'm sorry. Chochabadaigashi or super
4780920	4788360	dinner table flipping. And you said, by the way. By the way, I blame you. Blame me? What did I do?
4789320	4795320	Or maybe Bobby, I should blame. I don't I'm not willing to do Stadia Pro again,
4796280	4802760	but I did by dead by daylight on it. Oh, wow. And I did get the pyramid head pack
4804600	4811000	and I got the spirit. We're going to we're going to roll that up and blame Alan.
4812280	4817560	This is all Alan's fault. Is Alan still here? Alan, I've I bought in the other room quite
4817560	4825320	a few packs because right now, actually, if you buy the game on on Stadia, like all of the packs,
4825320	4831800	except for the trickster are on sale, like some of them are half price. I don't know if you've
4831800	4836520	been hearing all this, Alan, but you've got me sucked into dead by daylight and now dark
4836520	4841480	Sakura. She doesn't really have a PC for dead by daylight, but she just bought it on stadia
4841480	4846120	so she can play dead by daylight as well. How do you feel about suckering all these people
4846120	4852600	as of recent into playing dead by daylight? I'm an influencer. What can I say? Oh, she got
4852600	4857560	an ego now that she's a big time streamer, huh? I have to say, though, I have to say
4858680	4865480	the one who cinched it for me was Nika. Ah, because I haven't been able to watch
4865480	4873080	either of you play it. And I watched Nika play as a survivor. OK. And when I just saw like the
4873080	4879560	different strategies and whatever, I was like, you know what? I think this I think I will enjoy
4879560	4885000	this, but I definitely after watching some killer playthroughs, even though I would get super
4885000	4890120	motion sick, I already know the characters I think I would like the best. Wait, sorry,
4890120	4894040	before Alan's about to leave you in an errand, I have that. Who is the who is the nurse streamer
4894040	4900920	you love losing color? That's it. OK, losing color. OK, he's on right now. Well, don't I don't
4900920	4904200	care that he's on right now. You're not going to go watch that. You're going to watch this.
4904200	4908520	But and I would say after the show, but no, you're gonna watch Bobby play No Man's Sky after the
4908520	4914680	show. So tomorrow, go. He streams every day. I feel like he's on all the time. He's really good,
4914680	4919400	though. I recommend that guy. He's funny. So, OK. Sorry, Jamie. I wanted to make sure
4919400	4923880	Alan got that out before he left. Well, hey, it's a good thing that I
4925080	4929720	paid for. Well, I didn't pay. I got the free stadium system so I can play it on the TV, too.
4929720	4935000	Yeah. Hey, oh, there you go. Nice. Yeah. All right. Hey, you know what? I appreciate, too,
4935560	4939400	that now you'll be able to you know, we've talked a lot about stadia and there's been a lot of like
4939400	4944360	down talking on stadia. I appreciate that you've kind of taken this plunge. And now I'm hoping on
4944360	4949000	next week's show. You can tell us how your stadia experience has been if you appreciated that you
4949000	4957240	bought the game there or wish you hadn't. Well, I'm really only. Twenty twenty seven dollars in
4958200	4967880	after buying five packs and the game for nine ninety nine. Yeah. So there's that. I also own
4967880	4975400	it on steam. And I have the Geforce thing, too, so I got it there as well. Oh, plenty, plenty of
4975400	4980760	places to enjoy trying to find a way to get this sucker to work on my Mac without using a visualizer.
4980760	4986200	Make sure you connect your steam and your stadia stuff on the Debbie Daylight site,
4986200	4991560	because that way the cross by works. And so you'll unlock daylight. That's my joke,
4991560	4995400	dead by day. Well, it's not my joke. It's Twitch's joke. Dead by Daylight, Debbie Daylight,
4996120	5001800	because it's DBD. So it sounds like Debbie. Yeah. Oh, I get it. Yeah. So Debbie Daylight,
5001800	5006680	you want to get the connect your two. So that way, those things you just bought on stadia
5006680	5011320	will unlock on steam as well. I already. OK, so I'll have to figure out how to link that.
5011320	5017320	Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, anyway, let's move on. We have some rapid fire news. Let's travel around
5017320	5022760	and check out some other headlines going on in the world. Loki, I think you're first. Yeah.
5023480	5028600	So like we do every month, let's talk about the free stuff you get when you pay for subscriptions.
5029160	5037080	So games of gold this month, we're getting looks like Vikings, Wolves of Midgar. We have
5037640	5046120	Truck Racing Championship and on the Xbox 360 compatible games, Dark Void and Hardcore
5046120	5051480	Uprising. That's that, you know, Contra Contra game. Yeah, that's the better one, though,
5051480	5057800	is better. It's good. It's not like the the last one they release. Otherwise, the rest of those
5057800	5065720	picks. Now, this is where Microsoft is slipping. It's it's really time for Microsoft. I mean,
5065720	5070360	the Contra picks. All right. But the rest are a little they're not exciting. We'll say I'm sorry
5070360	5075080	to those developers. They're not that level of exciting. So this is where Microsoft Microsoft
5075080	5079240	might want to think about sunsetting this. Well, they've been doing this for a while and,
5079240	5084680	you know, it's not always exciting. But hey, you know, it's free game. At least they're giving out
5084680	5090360	four free games a month. You know, is that you can't say the same about Sony, who they're giving
5090360	5096600	away, though Oddworld Soulstorm, which is a pretty awesome game. Days Gone on PlayStation
5096600	5103000	four and Zombie Army for Dead War. And those are your free PlayStation plus games as well.
5104440	5112600	And then we've got this is kind of funny. There is a stonk skin that is going to be available
5112600	5119480	for Fortnite and the skin's name, of course, is Diamond Hands, which is a reference to Wall Street
5119480	5125720	Betts. But it's the stonks mean character that you can now get as a skin. I really get irritated
5125720	5132440	at all this awesome shit Fortnite gets like the Tron stuff is like, you know, it is Fortnite is
5132440	5139800	like this pop culture blender right now. It's it's pretty stunning. Yeah, so that's it's pretty
5139800	5149160	funny. And then they also have a wearable rising orange arrow to that you can get. So. Oh, my God.
5149800	5154840	That was their April Fool's thing. Tiger Claw on chat says the stonks skin to me looks like
5154840	5159800	a crash test dummy for some reason. It kind of does. Yeah. But I mean, that's kind of what the
5159800	5166760	meme looks like anyway. So I mean, it could double as both true. You know, you know which meme I need
5166760	5171080	for when I play Fortnite are the is Epic Games listening. Some of you for Fortnite listening.
5171080	5177000	The meme I need. I need the old guy in the red sweater that is going like this. I don't know.
5177000	5185000	It says guess I'll die because that's me playing Fortnite. So I need the guess I'll die guy in
5185000	5190520	Fortnite. Can somebody make that happen, please? Thank you. Love Rob Roberts. Dark Sakura,
5190520	5196440	what do you have for us in rapid fire news? So Summer Games Done Quick is definitely
5196440	5202520	returning in July and it is going to be online like the the previous ones have been within the
5202520	5209400	last year. And it certainly hasn't, you know, being online hasn't prevented the the contributions.
5209400	5216520	And to be honest, I actually kind of like that a lot of things are going online. Yeah. For it,
5216520	5223320	because it gives more participants a chance to to play in it when they maybe can't fly out or
5223320	5228120	Worldwide. Yeah. And it's kind of lended itself to its own memes, right? Like didn't Lamp come
5228120	5234920	out of this whole virtual thing and that stuff. So, yeah. But at any rate, it will be starting
5234920	5247560	Sunday, July 4th on the GDQ Twitch channel. Nice. Next up, the Dead or Alive series director
5247560	5257640	Shinbori Youhei has left Koei Tecmo. His quote is, as of today, I have left Koei Tecmo Games.
5257720	5262360	I worked on Dead or Alive for 16 years. And while there were times I was pleased, there were also
5262360	5267080	times I was unable to live up to expectations. I would like to take this opportunity to express
5267080	5271720	my utmost gratitude to the many people who have supported and taken care of me. Thank you very
5271720	5279000	much. All right. Tiger Claw in chat talking about the Summer Games Done Quick says the only thing I
5279000	5283560	miss about this is the audience reaction when they pull up a trick and then the audience reacting and
5283560	5288920	clapping. I can see that. And I think this is another place where I think we hope that the
5288920	5294520	pandemic lessons learned and the new technologies can maybe offer a blended approach moving forward
5294520	5298680	where that might be a great way to fill in some downtime. And I know Summer Games Done Quick does
5298680	5302520	its own thing for downtime right now, like their recaps and things like that. But it might be cool
5302520	5306840	to mix in a little bit of this, especially when you have a complicated tech maneuver going on in
5306840	5313560	person. Maybe, okay, let's go now to our friend in Russia, who's a great speed runner at this
5313560	5317800	game but wasn't able to make the trip out here. Let's do this for the next hour or two while we
5317800	5324360	do a complicated tech setup in person. It would be cool if maybe a blended approach works in the
5324360	5329560	future. I think it would be very, very cool. And of course, our fingers and toes crossed that our
5329560	5333480	pal Bobby Black Wolf will be involved with the Games Done Quick stuff again, although we know
5333480	5337240	nothing at this point. I don't think they've done any of the auditioning or anything like that.
5337240	5341320	But it's always fun to know some people who are involved with the whole thing.
5341320	5345240	I don't know if we know any speed runners that might be submitting. I don't think Flaco submits
5345240	5349800	anymore for PT. But I don't know if we know anybody that submits for anything else. So best
5349800	5355400	of luck to anybody that's going to be participating in that. And more different things can be showcased
5355400	5359480	that can't be shown at the show like Pump or DDR. Yeah, that's true. You can get that in there as
5359480	5367880	well. Yeah, that's true. That's Super Mario Brothers World 2 that Bobby did had a huge
5367880	5374520	crowd pop. Yeah, they hosted that whole stage where he had to float through the whole damn
5374520	5378040	stage. That would have been a huge crowd reaction. That's for sure. That's for sure.
5378040	5382360	Act Def says Flaco is done with PT speed running as far as I know. I think that is the case too.
5382360	5388040	I think he's got family commitments and stuff as far as I know. And they didn't accept him
5388040	5393160	when he was really pushing for that. But, you know, we'll hope somebody out there listening
5393160	5396920	to OLR is going to be able to participate with the show in one way or another because it's always
5396920	5400840	fun to know somebody involved. All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release
5400840	5408760	dates. Loki, we'll start with you in the US. Let's see, we have lost words beyond the page
5408760	5416040	on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. As we mentioned, as part of the PlayStation
5416040	5423880	Plus titles, Oddworld Soulstorm is coming out on PlayStation 5 as well as PlayStation 4 and PC.
5425000	5431880	We have Star Wars Republic Commando on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. Then we've also got
5431880	5440680	Island on Nintendo Switch. The Legend of Heroes Trails of Cold Steel 4 on PC and Nintendo Switch.
5441640	5449720	And last but not least, Poison Control on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. I think that's it.
5452440	5457800	All right, let's move on to Japan and let's talk about some of the releases on the Switch in Japan,
5457800	5466680	including WRC 9, Muse Dash, Island, Silver Star Japan Table Games is out on the Switch this week.
5466680	5471800	Is that something like clubhouse games or like a different set of games? Oh, it's like casino
5471800	5475960	games. I get it. Those types of table games. Although I think I see chess. Yeah, I see chess.
5475960	5480280	So it looks like chess kind of mixed with card games, maybe mixed with some casino games there.
5480280	5485240	And I think I see Mahjong as well. So I guess their own little version of clubhouse games of
5485240	5490680	sorts. Although not by Nintendo, that is by Silver Star Japan. So that is all coming out on the
5490680	5496760	Switch this week. Checking out the PlayStation 5, we have nothing this week on the PlayStation
5496760	5505240	5. Womp, womp. But on the PlayStation 4, we don't have anything this week either. It's slowing down.
5505240	5510760	We have Winning Post 9 next week, but we don't have anything this week. So that's it for releases.
5510760	5518440	How about Europe, Dark Sakura? Just a few things. We have on the seventh, we have Destruction
5518440	5526120	All-Stars for PlayStation. On the eighth, we have WRC 9 for Switch. PlayStation and Xbox
5526120	5532120	Mortal Shell Enhanced Edition Deluxe Set. Also in the ninth, Crypt of the Necrodancer.
5533560	5537560	Bladed Fury for PlayStation. And that is it for the week.
5538280	5543640	All right. We're going to do a few more stories, and then we are going to get to your emails,
5543640	5550520	as well as your questions in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network. Meanwhile, Loki,
5551160	5555000	continuing this summer looking very like last summer, right?
5555880	5564280	Yep. So we've got lots of events being canceled and going online. So we've got Tokyo Game Show
5564280	5571960	being canceled for in-person events, but they're doing their online event again this year. That's
5571960	5577080	going to run between September 30th to October 3rd. And then also...
5577080	5578600	That's out there. That's...
5578600	5579320	Yeah.
5579320	5585480	But Japan may be... I don't know how fast... I just don't know how fast Japan is vaccinating
5585480	5590600	the public. So the COVID situation may just be different there too. So something to keep in mind.
5591320	5596440	Yeah. And then PAX East is also canceled, but they're planning for an online event in July.
5597160	5605080	So that's something that's going to happen. No word though exactly when in July, but
5605080	5609640	it's unfortunate that we're... Maybe next year.
5609640	5613880	Yeah. Fingers crossed. I'm still trying to be hopeful about things like DragonCon,
5613880	5617560	but it's just one of those... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. That's
5617560	5623160	where my mind is right now. I trust that a convention that big, especially located in
5623240	5627960	the town where the CDC is at and has people that are involved there for their day job,
5628840	5631960	they'll make the right call. And if it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't.
5631960	5636360	So I'm not expecting a SacAnime situation with DragonCon.
5636360	5641720	That's gross. But honestly, the county is, I think, more to blame for that one, but still,
5642280	5645880	they had to have the event to have the county do the thing.
5645880	5649960	It's one of those things where I think a lot of us are just shocked that that sort of event was
5649960	5656520	even legal. But that's the problem. It's legal. And that could lend itself to a whole conversation
5656520	5663320	about, should Spencer gifts be open at the mall? Because it's not that different, but it's whatever.
5664520	5669000	None of us went because I don't think they had stellar attendance. I'm sure they didn't,
5669000	5675640	but here's what it is. Anyway, but hopefully the situation is much different in what, five months,
5676200	5682680	and we can look at this through different lenses as to how these events can happen. And if that
5682680	5687480	requires people to be vaccinated before they go to events, then maybe. But we'll see. We'll see.
5687480	5690440	I know there's a lot of controversy when it comes to vaccine passports and all that stuff.
5691000	5695320	Moving on, let's talk about something less controversial, a game that gets everybody excited
5696680	5703240	among us. Although I think that the fever over this game seems to have died down a little bit
5703240	5708200	on Twitch. I don't see as many people streaming it as I used to, but maybe that's why they're
5708200	5712600	putting in some new modes. I mean, obviously this game has done above and beyond, I think what the
5712600	5719080	team ever imagined that it would do. So even if the sun starts setting on this game, I don't think
5719080	5724280	you could ever call it a failure. Absolutely not. Quite the opposite. It's been one of the craziest,
5724280	5729560	hugest indie successes in many years. And there's some things to maybe keep that going and bring
5729560	5733560	this game back up and get more people to play it. There is a big update happening that is
5733560	5740200	bringing out the Airship map. The Airship map is now available in the game. There are also going
5740200	5745800	to be some updates that InnerSloth is working on to kind of bring the game up to date with that.
5745800	5751400	A persistent account system launched with the Airship map and of course new hats, gotta have
5751400	5757560	new hats, launched with the map as well. Some other changes coming up in the future, 15 player lobbies.
5758200	5763720	So if you thought the game with 10 players was crazy, just wait, we're going to have 15. And
5763720	5768840	they're talking about a revamped art style. Marcus B, who is a artist over at InnerSloth,
5768840	5774520	completely updated the visual assets, cleaning up lines, having animations cleaned up a little bit.
5774520	5780520	So they're promising that that will be out soon. InnerSloth also talking about a roadmap for the
5780520	5785720	future and kind of keeping the community up and up on what's going on with the game. So that's that.
5786280	5792520	ActDeftInChat says, I like Among Us, but nobody I know wants to play it. So all right, I get the
5792520	5797880	hint. We still need to do that Among Us stream at some point. We always talk about it, but we just
5797880	5802600	haven't done it yet. So soon, trademark. All right, moving on, DarkSagra.
5804120	5813560	So I thought this had already been done, but apparently it's more money. So there was a
5813640	5822520	nearly perfect copy of Super Mario Brothers for the NES and it is since sold for $660,000 at an
5822520	5840760	auction. It was a 13 bidder event. And out of all of this, the original owner got $550,000
5840760	5851720	for that auction. This one apparently had 11 different box variants for the original
5851720	5857080	Super Mario Brothers. And this was one of the earliest shrink-wrapped versions of the game
5857080	5867640	that you could buy in the US. So it was done by Heritage Auctions. So I guess they got whatever
5867640	5879560	their cut was. But it sold for more than the Nintendo PlayStation. There was that pristine
5879560	5887480	Super Mario Brothers 3 that went for $156,000. So goodness, the money.
5887480	5890840	And it's funny because I've seen a lot of people kind of replying to this story going,
5890840	5896040	I still have a copy of Super Mario Brothers somewhere, but it's a little bit more than
5896040	5900920	just a copy of the game. It is the particular pressing of the game. And like Darsagra was
5900920	5904280	kind of talking about, there was all these different variants of Super Mario Brothers.
5904280	5910760	And these early, early ones are the way that they were, I think it's something to do with the
5911800	5916520	back of the box when you're a particular way or the way the box is put together kind of makes
5916520	5920920	it special and a little more rare. It's like a trading card with a misprint sort of thing.
5921880	5926920	Yeah, yeah. So just because this sold for what, two thirds of a million dollars,
5926920	5931480	something like that, doesn't mean that your copy of Mario Brothers and Duck Hunt is suddenly worth
5931480	5935720	a lot of money because the Mario Brothers Duck Hunt cartridge really isn't worth a lot
5935720	5941320	because everybody got that with their NES. It's this particular version when not everybody got
5941320	5945720	Mario Brothers with the console. Remember, they sold the Nintendo by itself in the beginning,
5945720	5951080	and then they also had a pack with Rob the Robot. That did not come with Mario Brothers.
5951080	5956120	The Rob the Robot pack came with Stack Up and Gyromite, right? Or something like that.
5956120	5963080	Yeah. So there was a reason to sell Mario Brothers separately. But a lot of people,
5963080	5966920	I think, reading the wrong thing out of this headline where my copy of Super Mario Brothers
5966920	5971720	must be worth a lot of money. Probably not, unless you happen to still have it in a box,
5972360	5976920	just the way you bought it. All right. Exactly. Let's move on. Loki.
5978280	5988280	All right. So this is pretty cool. We've got. Well, I'm looking forward to the analog pocket.
5988280	5992840	Unfortunately, I'm going to have to wait for a little bit longer because it's been delayed.
5993640	5998040	So it was delayed. I don't remember the original release date. I think it was in the spring,
5998040	6005480	though, but it's been delayed now to October 2021. And basically saying that there's sudden
6005480	6011960	and severe electrical component shortages, which is definitely a thing. And logistical issues have
6012760	6018280	led to a domino effect that challenges everyone in the industry. And they're sorry that it happened.
6018280	6023560	But apparently it's a component shortage issue, which I know just hearing from other stories,
6023560	6027080	especially with like, you know, I mean, everything, I mean.
6027080	6029240	Yeah. And television was supposed to release yesterday.
6029960	6039320	Yeah. Yeah. So it's it's to be expected, I guess. But hopefully there will be enough
6039320	6043560	product available when it does come out, because I know that the NES one you cannot get anymore.
6044840	6047720	Unless you're willing to spend like eight hundred dollars, which no one is.
6047720	6053240	No. Why would you do that? Yeah. And obviously those same tech shortages
6053240	6058120	are affecting things like PlayStation fives. Video cards are the other like huge. It's all
6058120	6065480	the things the scalpers are buying up like crazy. Yeah. Yeah. S.J. one her mat in chat says analog
6065480	6072440	pulls off its mask and it was really Nintendo all along. But it's a joke about being unable to make
6072440	6079000	anyway. But yeah, component shortages actually having a short like a real shortage based on
6079000	6084280	like facts and shorting something that there's literally infinite copies available for it.
6084280	6091000	You know that there's a difference there, you know. Yeah. But but Nintendo wanted to kill Mario.
6091000	6096840	So, you know, they waited until March 31st to do that. How sad for Mario having died this week.
6096840	6102360	It's tragic that we lost an icon. All right. Anyway, one more story for you guys. And this
6102360	6107000	is about an April Fool's joke coming true. But this is the good kind of April Fool's joke coming
6107000	6115400	true. So I think it was last year Platinum Games announced as a joke Soul Cresta. It was a classic
6115400	6121080	shoot them up spiritual successor of sorts to Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta. Those are games that
6121080	6127960	have been out previously. Guess what? Soul Cresta has now been confirmed as real. So it's gone from
6127960	6133880	April Fool's joke to it's going to be the first entry in the neoclassic arcade series. It will
6133880	6140040	be out on PlayStation 4, Switch and PC. There was a new announcement trailer that came out this week
6140040	6145240	with Now in Development at the end. And just so you wouldn't think it was an April Fool's joke,
6145240	6151960	again, Platinum Games themselves tweeted out on April 2nd. Soul Cresta, the first title in
6151960	6158520	Platinum Games neoclassic arcade series is coming in 2021 to Nintendo Switch, PS4 and Steam. It's
6158520	6164040	not an April Fool's joke anymore. It's really happening to, of course, where everybody on
6164040	6172040	Twitter instantly replied, where is Bayonetta 3? Right. That's why don't read replies on Twitter.
6173800	6179960	Sometimes I don't read replies to my own tweets. No, I'm kidding. I do read them. Whether you get
6179960	6187800	blocked for them is another thing. No, not anybody here at OLR. But yeah, don't read replies to
6187800	6194280	corporate accounts because they're always crazy. So going back to the last story a little bit about
6194280	6200280	shortages. Shane is in our chat, Shad Starzik, saying shortages in something or other pushed my
6200280	6205800	Hades vinyl from this month to December. Yeah, that's right. That was another delay. I remember
6205800	6211560	hearing him complain about that last night on Discord. So he's got that. So I didn't think
6211560	6216120	there was a shortage of vinyl. But whatever it is they used to make records, they've got that as
6216120	6221960	well. Probably all the factories making other stuff right now. So. All right. Well, that is all
6221960	6226600	the news we had scheduled for tonight. We'll get to some last minute stories here in a moment. But
6226600	6231560	I also want to check if we got any email. I don't remember if we have any or not. We do. Yay. Let's
6231560	6235880	get to it. Mail. Excuse me. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us
6235880	6241320	an email. So Dark Soccer is going to. Actually, no, wait a second. When was the 26th? Yeah,
6241320	6245880	never mind. You guys would have already read this and someone doesn't clean the email box out.
6245880	6251320	And that. Okay. So we don't have emails tonight. No email. All right. So guess what that means?
6252360	6255880	We would usually talk about Drag Race, except I haven't been staying current. I've kind of
6255880	6261160	fallen out of the habit. I know it's so much of it and I'm just I'm kind of over it. This is the
6261240	6268760	first season, though, that I've actually been excited about. Yeah. It's really good.
6268760	6275880	Is it over next week? Because we're down to the top four, right? I mean, I may not watch it,
6275880	6282840	but Twitter watches it for me. You got to catch up. It's gotten so good. Is next week the last
6282840	6290280	episode or is before the top before the top three? Well, but are they doing that with the whole
6290280	6296040	pandemic and everything? I don't know. I honestly, I don't like the whole top three thing.
6296920	6301640	I like when they do the lip sync, right? And they have the winner of each lip sync,
6301640	6306200	and then the two winners sink against each other and actually earn that last crown.
6308040	6311560	That's what I like. I wish that would stay that way.
6311560	6314600	Obviously, they're not going to do it in front of an audience, but are they going to maybe bring
6314600	6321560	them back? Because technically, LA County is in orange tier as of Monday. So their restrictions
6321560	6326600	are really so they could bring they could actually technically, they could probably get away with
6326600	6332280	bringing in an audience for it. They probably won't. And if they do, it'll be made up of,
6333400	6340920	you know, friends of like guests of the contestants only. But I'm curious if they'll
6340920	6344360	even do it or if they'll just do an empty studio and do a finale that way. I don't know.
6345160	6351640	I honestly think that they should just have like a very, very small venue type thing or, you know,
6351640	6357640	like a little tiny studio thing and just record it like maybe back at, you know, like clear out
6357640	6364280	the workroom, right? Have them, you know, make sure that they're either vaccinated or have been
6364280	6372280	quarantined and bring them to do their lip sync in or maybe they could just do it on the main stage.
6372280	6377960	Yeah, I don't know. Well, they've probably torn down that studio because they actually
6377960	6382600	rebuild that whole set every time they film. And that's why you've been seeing more like All Stars
6382600	6387640	and the regular show back to back is because they just recycle the set. But they tear it,
6387640	6393160	they shoot other things in that space when Drag Race isn't filming. So they will probably run a
6393160	6397160	theater like they've done. It's just the question is, will they sell the seats? Will they recruit
6397160	6401480	people for the seats or will it just be guests of the queens? Or are they just gonna do a virtual
6401480	6404440	again like they did with last season? Rent another studio is what I'm saying. Rent another
6404440	6409720	studio. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Because then, I mean, number one, it's less than probably
6409720	6413720	renting a full theater. You don't have to deal with crowds and you only have to light a certain
6413720	6419160	small area. Well, or is it? Because the theaters aren't doing anything right now. So they'd probably
6419160	6423880	welcome the shoot. Who knows? Who knows? I don't know. We'll see. Yeah, we'll see. Anyway, okay,
6423880	6427800	so Drag Race talk when we don't get emails. Participate at orangelandtrader.com is the
6427800	6433560	place to send us emails for a future show. One last thing. Yes. I no longer hate Candy,
6433560	6438840	and in fact, I love her. The saddest thing about, maybe that's why I'm not watching as much.
6438840	6444600	You're not gonna be able to see these girls tour for another year. So it's kind of sad. Also,
6445240	6451640	the one I really liked, Utica. Uh-huh. I liked her too. Don't like her at all after the roast,
6451720	6457400	but I'm still team Gottmik. But you know producers told her to do what she did.
6457400	6465720	It's reality TV, darling. Yes. But anyway, I'm still team Gottmik. If anybody who has been
6465720	6472600	consistently at the top of their game, it's been Gottmik and Rosé. Just saying. I'm still team
6473400	6478120	Tamisha Iman, and that is the person I'm most looking forward to seeing when she tours.
6479080	6483240	Well, I mean, like for winter. Oh, winter in my heart.
6486520	6495560	Hey, I think I can like who I like. All right. All right. I still I'm pretty sure that Olivia
6495560	6500680	is going to be Miss Congeniality. I haven't been paying attention enough to know who's nice or
6500680	6505800	whatever. Anyway, let's get to I don't know if we have any. I feel like we got all the news out,
6505800	6508760	but maybe Loki found some last minute stories he wants to address with us tonight.
6509400	6513160	There's nothing really major. I mean, it was just a couple April Fool's things. So
6515240	6518520	Pokemon Sword and Shield, they had an impossible to catch Magikarp.
6519640	6521800	Oh, I heard about that. That was rude.
6526360	6533240	And then Remedy did a demake of control. So that was cool. Interesting. Yeah.
6533240	6539480	Have you heard that rumor? It is a huge rumor. But like, we're not even two hours of show yet. So
6539480	6544040	this is where I start bringing out the rumors. By the way, if you guys have questions for us
6544920	6548680	in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, please, by all means.
6550280	6555400	Epic Games apparently is financing Alan Wake 2. That's that's the latest rumor.
6557000	6562840	I'm not the biggest epic fan in the world. I used to be back in the ZZT days. I'm not anymore.
6562840	6567640	I think the stuff they're pulling with Apple is really shitty. But at the end of the day,
6567640	6573320	I would love to see an Alan Wake 2. So I have no idea if there's any truth to that as well.
6573320	6580040	But it's certainly interesting to think about. So act deaf talking about the Magikarp event
6580040	6584840	saying they've done Magikarp events in the past. I have like four shiny Magikarp that I caught in
6584840	6588440	Shield already. Yeah, I know they did a shiny Magikarp event because I feel like it was early
6588440	6594280	on. I think even I have a shiny Magikarp and that's saying something. So I need to do the
6594280	6598840	Pokemon Go event. I didn't play enough today. And they I didn't even know they were doing another
6598840	6604440	collection quest. I haven't seen one of those since a dupe. No, it's not a dupe. It's it's
6604440	6612840	like bunny stuff for Easter. So it's it's a bunny re has the mega evolution. Bunnelby I think his
6612840	6620360	name is is kind of like the new shiny. And then also the pink stuff that are the eggs, the happy
6620360	6625080	knee chancy. They're like the egg Pokemon. They're, they're big in this as well to
6627080	6632200	act. Defton chat says I finished my shiny mew quest you did I saw the tweets about that
6632200	6639160	congratulation. I still need like 20 dragon types among other things. So you must have rated a shit
6639160	6646200	ton of Rayquaza's to finish that or you did some other trick I'm not aware of. So but I know there
6646200	6650040	were some people that were really pushing the pedal to the metal on the Rayquaza thing to get
6650040	6656200	their dragon types. I also saw one of my friends here locally Pokemon Go Raider hit level 50.
6656920	6662760	And I'm like, dang, that takes dedication. That takes dedication. I just about have the experience
6662840	6671160	for 44. But I really don't want to play the the PvP stuff. I've kind of been trying to go in.
6671160	6674600	I like half ass do two of them. And then I'm like, I'm already over it.
6677080	6679640	So. All right. Anything else? Loki?
6680840	6682120	No, that's pretty much it.
6682680	6688280	All right. I guess it was a slower week. What can you say? Not as much going on is,
6688920	6693720	is Bobby out there? I hope Bobby's ready. I don't know if he was expecting the show
6693720	6699240	to be done this early, but we'll see. Okay. He says yes. Okay, good. So that's it, y'all.
6699240	6704200	Thanks for downloading our show, checking us out or watching us live on Twitch. If you like what

6740040	6744600	We will be back next week. I may or may not be here. I have a feeling I will be here,
6744600	6749400	but I'll only be pushing buttons and then taking a nap. But we'll see what happens. So
6749400	6752200	next week's show is going to be interesting one way or the other. Tune in for that.
6753400	6757720	Meanwhile, let's go. Oh, go ahead. For the record, Dead by Daylight works.
6758440	6760840	Oh, good. Oh, did you get the connection thing going?
6762680	6766920	Well, I did. I tried to do the connection, but it makes me have to log into the game to do it. So I
6766920	6772200	actually just opened itself up. Nice. And it looks actually like I'm even going to be able to stream,
6772200	6776760	but I just have to do a little bit of change to my graphic interface. Nice. Well, then,
6777400	6781800	oh, my God. So I think we're looking at our next bonus. Oh, wait, but you want to play killer as
6781800	6785800	well. Well, maybe we'll figure something out, because I was thinking a nice bonus stream would
6785800	6791080	be Rob murders his husband on air, but it's all through Dead by Daylight. But he'll need other
6791080	6795720	survivors to play with. But maybe we can do something where you get to murder him as well
6795720	6802600	at some point. So we'll talk about that off air. So. All right. Because our chat met the reward
6802600	6807240	for the second thing. So we're going to have to start thinking of a third reward pretty soon,
6807240	6811720	although Bobby's also talking about another VHS stream because he has more tapes, lots and lots
6811720	6818600	of tapes to run. So we'll see. So many tapes. But I really hope. And if you haven't seen the clip,
6818600	6824440	please look for it. I really hope there's more moments like that Mario statue that was being
6824440	6829640	voiced live by Charles Martinet, where Bobby was just like turned beet red on his stream when he's
6829640	6834280	like, oh, my God, I can't believe this is in here, where he's interacting with Mario and Charles
6834280	6838920	Martinet is going, it's the TV station, because he thought Bobby was with the TV station. He
6838920	6844280	couldn't hear what station it was. He's like, it's a my TV station. It's really funny. Please
6844280	6850440	try to look for that clip to which Bobby's protesting in chat. Thank you. As you have
6850440	6857160	found the clip and posted the link for reference. It's so good, Bobby. Embrace it.
6858120	6862360	All right. Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night. I'll start with
6862360	6868360	my final thought. I don't have a lot a lot, but I will just say, I'm looking forward to getting
6868360	6874600	my second shot next week. And hopefully in May, getting to hug some people I know IRL again.
6875480	6880600	And that includes my co-host. That includes some of you out there listening. I just,
6881320	6886040	man, it's been over a year and I'm ready for some actual human interaction again.
6886040	6894920	All right, Rob. To be technical, we're safe. I know. I know. But I can I can push through
6894920	6901480	like one or two more weeks. And I'll bring you pie. I do love pie. I've been making mini pies.
6901640	6904840	All right. Let's get Loki's final thought. Loki.
6906280	6910360	My final thought is that I like I said, I'm going to try to get into
6910360	6915720	streaming again. So look forward to that. Awesome. Awesome. And last but not least, dark soccer.
6917880	6924360	I'm excited to kill people. I mean, virtually. Nice. And can you shout out your friend who's
6924360	6932840	streaming? Is she streaming now? It's Sweet Nika. So N-I-K-K-A. I think she's streaming.
6932840	6939320	Let me just double check real quick. Well, streaming or not, give them a follow.
6940840	6947400	Yeah. That way you can follow in future week. Yeah. Sweet Nika and Sweet N-I-K-K-A. And she's
6947400	6952280	still streaming. Nice. Drop that in chat. Okay. That's it. That does it for another week here
