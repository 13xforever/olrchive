00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Homemark is making video game themed ornaments this year and I think that's awesome. I remember having ornaments of things I liked as a kid and they were cute but not relevant like this will be. I also learned that this is not the first time they've done this, that the NES and massively popular franchises had designs last year. Joining this year includes Sonic, Minecraft, and Sub-Zero! Wow.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Before we get that far, it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring us this and much more timely news starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight, April the 18th of 2021 with episode number 865 of our podcast.

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hi.

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hi, and allow me to be the first to say happy birthday because I know I'm doing it a little early, but it's tomorrow, but when most of the podcasty people hear this it'll be your birthday.

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh yeah, I will be older.

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes.

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
By a day.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Because you're not an instant year older, you're just a nuts member.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's right. It's so funny because I always hear people make such a big deal about oh my god I'm turning 30 or oh my god I'm turning 40, and then it's like well 40 doesn't really feel any different. No, it doesn't.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Because, first of all, those children need to shut up.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm just saying.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
First of all, get off my lawn. Second of all,

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Second of all, get off my neighbor's lawn too kids.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But yeah, thank you, everybody.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I appreciate it.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
All right, well, are you doing anything to celebrate?

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Um, I might have another Animal Crossing birthday party. Oh fun.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Um, I was supposed to have my second Pfizer shot today. And I went to when they were scheduled me like, no, she like, why, because my birthday is on the 19th.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Please. She's like, Oh, I totally get that. Because I did actually I, you know, I felt it after the fact I did have. I was pretty sick for a couple of days and I'm only thinking I'll be even sicker, you know, with the second shot so Oh, oh girl, let me tell you.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So last week so LR, I got through the show just fine right. Oh, after about probably about two hours after the show wrapped up like 10 o'clock 11 o'clock.

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Boom, boom, clap those side effects hit me like a truck. I was out of work for two days. I had fever and chill for about a day, and then I had a really bad headache that lasted two days, but I, again, I don't want to scare people off from getting the vaccine,

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
not everybody gets it that bad like like low temporary, hold on, I gotta say hi to Techmaster Loki.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Hello, hi, you didn't really have any vaccine issues at all right.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No, I didn't. Yeah, so some people do some people don't that's just the way it works out sometimes.

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And even, even the two days that I went through that were not pleasant. It just, it was, it's not like being normal sick it was just suddenly done like a light switch, like I woke up Wednesday morning and I'm like, I feel fine.

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And that was that.

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But it's also it's much better than having coded, I assure you, from everybody I've talked to that had coded the side effects are better.

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So there's that.

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah, and I'm, I went ahead and scheduled myself off on Wednesday because normally my workweek starts on Wednesday.

33
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But I've been telling like for you know my, the people that I've been working with, like, I had one thing scheduled on Thursday and I'm like, if I'm not going to make it I'm going to sign in long enough to email you and say, I am sick, and that's it.

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah.

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
At least my office is right over, you know, my left yonder. Yeah.

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And I will say, just a bit of personal news as well, Alan.

37
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:22,000
My husband is getting his first shot on the same day as Jamie second shot the 20th. So that is nice because that is kind of the key barrier to when do we get to do the whole show in person again, because that means all of us will be fully vaccinated at that point

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and that is very very pleasant and then we can start actually having those talks, I will say I got to see my dad this weekend, and we hung out and we didn't use, you know, I know, I know it's supposed to be two weeks but I'm like once once good enough, and

39
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:47,000
he's fully vaxxed, so it was nice to just hang out and see my dad again. So, it was very nice. So we're getting closer guys and I hope those of you out there that will be eligible for your shots well pretty much everybody's eligible now.

40
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's just about getting the appointments so I hope y'all are able to get them still tiered actually.

41
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Oh, are some states still tearing them. I thought everybody was open. Okay, well May 1 was the day everybody supposed to be open. I think there's only very few states left, I think Hawaii might be one of them that still tiered I remember hearing that somewhere,

42
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
but in general most states are open at this point but y'all y'all know the rules.

43
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Looking at chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network.

44
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Six Pacific nine Eastern right after Bobby Black Wolf I think he said that already, but I'll say it twice, because Bobby Black Wolf has our first comment tonight who says I slept through most of my side effects, but I took the next day off from work,

45
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I got it on Thursday and took Friday off, and I was fine by Saturday, and there's many people sharing stories about second shots it sounds like they're coming up soon for a lot of people, and of course a lot of birthday wishes for dark soccer as well,

46
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:50,000
who you know it's a bummer that you're still having another birthday during coven lockdowns but I do feel like there's more options this time, if you want to do it, I don't know, I don't know, there are.

47
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah, and I'll be, I'll be perfectly honest, the thing that I'm looking forward to is just being able to be outside and not be afraid that due to my other condition.

48
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm not gonna get that second end up hospitalized I had, I had pneumonia twice last last year. Yeah.

49
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I also want to point out in chat Tiger Claw says unfortunately I have to work on the day of the second shot.

50
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Check the rules and regulations us in your state now Tiger Claw I know you live in Florida so sorry, Florida is going to Florida, but in a lot of states like COVID leave to get the shots and stuff is actually mandatory for our employees

51
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:43,000
to work a certain number of hours so check that out in your state, where you're at but again, I do not think the outlook is good for Florida because Florida gonna Florida sorry guys.

52
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:55,000
My job started offering that up well before there was any national mandate. Well yeah and and of course yeah some some employers have done that well before and my mind was always very good about it as well but then we also found out it's going to be regulated

53
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:06,000
anyway in California so, you know, all right. Anyway, I haven't talked a lot to Loki I said hello, just to ask about the shot, and then I noticed in the background on Loki's screen tonight.

54
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Is that the Roadrunner game that was on like Super Nintendo or the. There was like an attack. Okay, okay why why that game tonight, because this is my first Super Nintendo game.

55
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh, I got this game instead of like Mario World I think I couldn't buy Mario World at the time. So I got this one, and it's sort of Sonic. Mm hmm. I don't know, but I played the heck out of it.

56
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I, why not. I vaguely remember that game but you know there was also a Roadrunner.

57
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It was an Atari arcade game and it ran on the same hardware it's like 720, and a lot of the big Atari games that age to try to get other games around on that hardware.

58
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't think gauntlet, but they had a very distinct look like they all had the same font and the scores are on big numbers. The Indiana Jones game that was out around that time I think also ran on the hardware, but there was a Roadrunner game it was really

59
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:13,000
fun that was on that. Yeah, this is Roadrunners Death Valley rally so. Mm hmm. I don't know, it was okay. It was frustrating but I did end up beating it. Good job. Yeah, I see the arcade one that does look interesting.

60
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah, that was a lot of fun I don't remember the arcade near me that had it. If it was like the roller rink, or what was speaking of which I saw those photos on your Facebook.

61
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You hit the roller rink, how was that was that fun. Yeah, it's, we've been doing it for, they've opened it up last week so we started going every Sunday. Now, this week is Saturday but do roller rink still have a pretty decent assortment of video games like they used to back in the day or is it all ticket spitters again.

62
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:58,000
No, they don't have ticket spitters at all it's, it's your usual like arcade stuff so they've got a terminators. I think it's Terminator salvation game that is broken, they have the Jurassic Park shooter game there.

63
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
They've got like a motorcycle racing game and Guitar Hero.

64
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So, it's a mix that Guitar Hero arcade games pretty popular I see a lot of places.

65
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:24,000
A lot of the stuff isn't working there right now like I know that terminators been broken for at least the two weeks that we've gone broken arcade games in a independently run, it's, it's funny because it's got like you know it's like a bias screen error things so you know

66
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:40,000
because it's running a computer so yeah, it's just kind of funny, but yeah the Jurassic Park arcade that's like everywhere. Speaking of which, you know, I thought that there was that one company was bringing those games home or whatever, and I know Jurassic Park the arcade was one of them I'm kind of curious

67
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
whatever happened to that but hopefully hear about soon because that'd be pretty exciting. Hopefully.

68
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah, they've got, you know, the assortment, not, not as much like I haven't been to some of the other ranks around here but like there's other ranks that are nearby that have much older looking games so like late, you know, like 90s 80s stuff.

69
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So obviously, you know, if I ever get over there since they still got that stuff. Alright.

70
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Alright, well, we're going to get into the news and then maybe we'll talk about some more arcade games during our gaming week we'll see but I want to get into tonight's kickoff topic, this one's a little weird this week I got to admit, because we're going to talk

71
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:31,000
a little bit about a rumor that's already kind of been shot down but I want to talk about it a little bit and get your guys's thoughts on this, well of course when I say you guys I mean our chat and the live folks as well and hey, those of you listening on the podcast

72
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:45,000
feed you can always tweet us at OLR or email us at participate at orange launch radio.com because, of course, we want to know your thoughts as well. And this has to do with a rumor about the potential acquisition of Square Enix.

73
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What happened is that there was a report out there it was a subscription news site, which I think was deferring to Bloomberg Japan I know Bloomberg was kind of being finger pointed as the original folks that started the rumor, and that basically was

74
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:16,000
that there's attempts out there for Square Enix to kind of boost their profile a little bit because Marvel Avengers did not perform to the level of expectations people had hoped with this, and that the company was basically being groomed for an acquisition.

75
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And, you know, there's been a lot of acquisitions going on lately. Microsoft buying Bethesda, that was kind of one of the big ones, but of course we had EA had picked up a Codemaster, and actually, Microsoft to get ZeniMax and it's an important

76
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:43,000
which owns Bethesda in turn. And then Epic Games picked up Tonic Games Group which are the folks that are made Fall Guys. So there's been a lot of these things going on.

77
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And of course Twitter went crazy right social media went crazy like oh my god Square Enix is for sale. And then in comes the Microsoft fanboys. I don't blame them in a way I mean I do blame them for being such suckers but I think there is a, you know, there's

78
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:11,000
there's always been that hope, Microsoft's gonna buy a Japanese company, and then we're, Japan's gonna have to take Xbox seriously again, and we all know Microsoft loves to buy buy companies up.

79
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So, it was, it was almost like the rumor was kind of self writing itself there that Microsoft were the ones that were looking to get Square Enix although that really wasn't ever named, and I think some people out there were theorizing Sony could be buying

80
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Square Enix as a response to Microsoft, getting ZeniMax slash Bethesda, but at the end of the day, we can talk about the coulda woulda shoulda is all we want. However, the end this doesn't always seem to happen which is what's interesting to me.

81
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Usually, a lot of companies will respond to these sorts of things with, we don't comment on rumors and speculation and that whole thing right. That didn't happen here. And maybe that's because we've got stock price those sorts of things involved, because the stock

82
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:11,000
went up. Thanks to these rumors that they were going to get bought Square Enix came out and said, No, that is not the case. Square Enix denied that it's mulling a sale, or even that it has been approached by interested parties, saying quote, We do not consider selling off the

83
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:28,000
company or any part of its business, nor have we received any offer from any third party to acquire the company, or any parts of its business. So that got shot down pretty quick. And yeah, I'm looking at a press release dated April 16 2021, straight from Square

84
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Enix Holdings, and they also kind of named Bloomberg by name, which is interesting. Let me actually I could read the whole press release here because it's, it's very short. It's titled today's media coverage, and it says, Bloomberg has reported today that there is interest from several buyers to acquire Square Enix. However, this report is not based off any announcement by Square Enix Holdings Limited. We do not consider selling off the company or any part of its business, nor have we received any offer from any third party to acquire the company or any part of his business that little segment that I do.

85
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Just read a moment ago. So I think it's very interesting how Square kind of came in here and and put a very hard no on this. What are your thoughts?

86
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Your words are interesting, but they are not based in fact, please go away.

87
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Kind of, kind of. Loki, I see you grinning over there. What are your thoughts on all this?

88
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You know, maybe they would have been more valuable as a company if they decided to, you know, port Final Fantasy 11 to mobile.

89
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But I mean, I don't drive the decisions of that company.

90
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Cheap shot, cheap shot.

91
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Bobby Blackwolf says Bloomberg, hey, Company X, would you be interested in buying Square Enix? Company X, I mean, if they're for sale, sure. Bloomberg, Company X, seeking to buy Square Enix.

92
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And maybe maybe it is a big commentary on some of these news outlets and how they do some of their reporting.

93
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Fifth Dream is pointing out, isn't Bloomberg the one also fanning flames of Switch Pro rumors?

94
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Well, those flames are everywhere. That's that's the Full House theme song.

95
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Everywhere you look, everywhere there's a heart. That that is the Switch Pro rumors.

96
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Go ahead. There's a thing that I have noticed with some of these companies that are.

97
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,000
This is what I'm trying to think of, like the business financial oriented, the ones that are usually for.

98
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I would reckon an audience that's different than, say, all of us.

99
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
We care about financing. Right. But we're not watching the stock market or the big business stuff.

100
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But I think that they're looking to try to gain that relevancy with a different demographic.

101
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And you know what the news what it says is that that even bad publicity is publicity.

102
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I think if they're touching on things that a different.

103
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:06,000
A demographic is interested in, then it's for them, it's going to generate interest from that new demographic, whether or not it's accurate.

104
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You know, they can always go back and say, oh, correction posted, blah, blah, blah, in tiny print.

105
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yeah. But their name is there now with people who would not have otherwise looked at their journalistic media.

106
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:31,000
S.H.A. 100 Matt in chat over Twitch TV slash Vogue Network says, I don't blame Bloomberg too much since I'm sure they vetted it with sources that fed this info.

107
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
This was all nonsense in the end. It's stockholders, bankers feeding information to boost interest in the market, et cetera.

108
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Yeah. And Bobby kind of piggybacks on this a little bit as well, talking about that's why there's so much Tesla FUD out there.

109
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
People are shorting the stock. And so they want bad news to come out. So they make up bad news in the hope that the stock falls.

110
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
This is the other direction. The stockbrokers want the stock price to go up.

111
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So they put out FUD to raise the stock price and they can profit. And I think we all know the punch line here.

112
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The stock price did go up 14 percent. So whoever sent anonymously that source to Bloomberg, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, right?

113
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:25,000
They got what they wanted. Also, just to point out, it very clearly shows how rigged the stock market is and how the rise and fall of the stock market itself is not a true gauge on how well the economy is doing.

114
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Well, and this is all echoed by the Game Stonk thing that, you know, was huge.

115
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Which is still going on.

116
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yeah, it's still going on, really.

117
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And now Doge.

118
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Well, yeah. And now cryptocurrency is the other huge one, too, is that, you know, you're absolutely right about the whole wanting to spread the word about something because I will see it all over my timeline by crypto enthusiasts.

119
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Whenever someone like Elon Musk or whoever it is will say something positive about Dogecoin, then it's like we need to amplify that as much as possible.

120
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So more people buy Dogecoin. So the price goes to the moon.

121
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And it does.

122
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And it kind of did this week.

123
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Loki, I hope you have been well, I know you were interested in that.

124
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:20,000
This is how it works. So I have something to tell you, I directly directly control what happens to Doge, but just in the opposite.

125
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,000
So like any time I buy, it goes down. Any time I sell, it goes up. So, yeah, I see.

126
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So you so you unloaded last week.

127
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Well, no, I sold it. I sold I sold at 30. And I'm waiting for I was hoping it would drop because it was going up and down.

128
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So I was trying to get it when it went back down a little bit.

129
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And now it's sitting at 32. So that's typically what happened was I was originally in it for and I was at 30 something.

130
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But like I had sold like a while back, too, because it was just dropping all over the place.

131
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And that's like I said, I was trying to buy low, sell high. But, you know, that's not what that's all.

132
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So I put it like a buck 50 in Bitcoin cash.

133
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And I now have two dollars and ninety five cents after two weeks.

134
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yeah, I put 50 bucks into Ethereum a few weeks ago, just as a one percent drop right now.

135
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Well, right now it does. But I put 50 bucks in like when all this Game Stonk stuff was going on.

136
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And it was up to at one point it peaked at 92 last week. And I checked I checked the stuff at some point.

137
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And it was like in the 80s today. But I mean, in my head, that 50 bucks to me was my legalized gambling budget, gambling budget.

138
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You know, like I haven't been to Reno to gamble in well over a year or to play.

139
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You know, I'm a grandma who loves to sit there in front of slot machines, Konami branded slot machines.

140
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And, you know, play them and try to win money.

141
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And I've probably won more on this whole digital currency thing than I have on any of the Konami slot machines.

142
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Well, the the thing I guess the reason why I put in Bitcoin cash is because it was I mean, it was like.

143
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Looked like it had a modest rise and it was I could do it through PayPal because I have a little bit of cash left in PayPal.

144
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So it's like, why not? Yeah, why not? And actually it's gone up three cents while I was watching it.

145
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It'll change up and down, like just in the seconds that you're there. That's how volatile the cryptocurrency stuff is.

146
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
But anyway, this isn't this isn't a crypto podcast. There's plenty of them out there if you want to check technology.

147
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:45,000
But I think a lot of us are kind of like, you know, well, to kind of bring it back to the home point about, you know, these this is the manipulation of the stock market.

148
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And this really only interests the people that are into the stock market.

149
00:20:48,000 --> 00:21:03,000
This whole conversation on the side that we're having does kind of bring back to the point of I think a lot more people now in 2021 feel empowered right now that the stock market is they're fucking right to.

150
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And, you know, especially after what happened with the whole GameStop stuff, I think I think if there's anything you can take away from that, it's that there's a lot of people who have spoken up and said we're sick of the stock market being controlled by.

151
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
We don't really understand it. It's and we the people are going to take it back and do what we want with it.

152
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And that essentially is what the GameStop stuff boils down to to me was that, you know, you're not going to kill off these brands in my childhood because then it was it was GameStop.

153
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It was AMC. It was Blockbuster at one point. Wasn't it Blockbuster too? And like all these like weird companies.

154
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It was Blackberry, AMC, maybe Nokia for a little bit.

155
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Yes.

156
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah, but GameStop took babbages from me.

157
00:21:48,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But anyway, my point is, is that, you know, I think now it's interesting to see how now that there's more people that are interested in stock markets because it's so easy to do it through apps and stuff and that have had the time to play with this stuff during COVID.

158
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:17,000
How these sorts of news may be diluted or whatever by social media and people out there who do have a passing interest, maybe not in Square Enix directly, but in the stock market and so forth.

159
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I think it's interesting.

160
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yeah. All right.

161
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Well, it's the big thing that a lot of a lot of people, I would say gaming enthusiasts of a certain age, don't consider.

162
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Yeah, true. You know, is that you're the content that you get is almost directly related to mostly related to how well that company is performing for the big names.

163
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,000
If the company is not performing well, they're not going to want to allocate budget to those titles.

164
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
They're going to want to try to save their money and build their current revenue.

165
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So it's all related.

166
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
This is all going to come up again later, by the way. We'll get into that when we get into it.

167
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's always going to come up. It's like the Hydra.

168
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah, true.

169
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Let me ask a stupid question, and I'm fully going to admit this is a stupid question and I'm just asking it for the sake of discussion.

170
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And this is a stupid question that a lot of YouTubers are going to be getting into on their channel this week.

171
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And that is the question.

172
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
What do you think? What do you think Square Enix should do? What would you like to see happen to Square Enix?

173
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
What do you want Square Enix to sell to Microsoft? Do you think that's a good idea?

174
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
What do you want to see happen Square Enix?

175
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And I'm saying this is a stupid question because as much as this may surprise you, it doesn't really matter what you think.

176
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
But that's not going to stop a lot of people from answering it anyway.

177
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
So what the hell? Let's indulge. We don't have that much news to talk about tonight.

178
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Let's indulge a stupid question.

179
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Rob, opinions are like assholes.

180
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
That's right.

181
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Everyone has one.

182
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So give us the fart on Square Enix. What do you want to see happen?

183
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I just want to see them keep performing well and to release, I'd actually really like more of the older Enix titles.

184
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You know, I want to see a return of some of the games that were, I'd say, big in the aughts, you know?

185
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Like, I mean, I'll throw out Busta Move.

186
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Like if you weren't going to say it, I'm like busta busta busta busta.

187
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Yeah. But I would also like to see them do more, I would say, just interactive things.

188
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:40,000
You know, I would even say have some sort of better relationship with their targeted demographic.

189
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You know, like maybe AR events.

190
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You know, that's just an example.

191
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Do more, you know, I was really pleased they released almost every earlier Final Fantasy game on iOS, you know, for iPhone and iPad.

192
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I would like for them to have more interactive polling with their demographic and not just in Japan, but in the US as well or in their other markets.

193
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Because I think that they'll find that they'll get a lot of good ideas for direction from their main fan base.

194
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Loki, what about you?

195
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I don't care what they do. I don't know.

196
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
They can sell to whoever they want, as far as like what games I want them to make.

197
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm more talk about racing.

198
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I think we all appreciate Square Enix as an independent company who does things with Nintendo sometimes, who does things with Sony sometimes.

199
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Doesn't really seem to do a lot with Microsoft very often, but maybe that's going to change in the future.

200
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You know, I shouldn't say that. I just feel like Microsoft doesn't really get exclusive stuff out of Square Enix.

201
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It's usually kind of like the catching up stuff.

202
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
But we do see Square Enix playing along with Game Pass, and that's kind of exciting. So there is that.

203
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So I like Square Enix kind of functioning as somebody a little bit more independent in this world and somebody that's very rooted in Japan and that sort of culture and getting the games out of Japan.

204
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I realize I'm saying all that and you're probably typing this in chat right now.

205
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:29,000
There is a whole and what about the stuff that's rooted in Eidos and the stuff like Avengers and Tomb Raider and all that stuff is Square Enix stuff too.

206
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Sure. And you know, Avengers, unfortunately, probably did not live up to the hype that was behind it.

207
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I still feel like that game maybe can still be turned around, especially I talk about Game Pass.

208
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I've said this before. I would think Avengers is going to be on Game Pass by the end of the year.

209
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
As I understand it, it's already a PlayStation Now title.

210
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So for Sony's thing over there, and I feel like they might be able to make some money off of, you know, DLC and expansions and so forth by maybe they may have to give away the base game a little bit, but they might make money back.

211
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:16,000
But I think Square has a lot of good news going for it. Like, you know, Final Fantasy 14 continues to be a very, very good money maker and a very good news all around.

212
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I know I'm freaking excited about Final Fantasy 16 at some point. I do wish, and this may surprise some of you that I'm going to say this, I do wish they would show a little love to Chrono Trigger already.

213
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It's kind of ridiculous that we've had Secret of Mana, Trials of Mana, although that was very exciting to get second distance to three finally after all these years.

214
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And now the Saga games, we didn't need to go back to the Saga games. Some are going to strongly disagree with me. I don't care.

215
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Technically two games in the Chrono Trigger series.

216
00:27:47,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So it is time to dust those off and give them some of the same lovin' they're given. I saw a great meme that was a SpongeBob meme where Squidward is like trapped inside and he's looking out the window where SpongeBob and Patrick are running down going,

217
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And the SpongeBob and Patrick are labeled Mana Series, Saga Series, and the Squidward that's like looking at them says Chrono Trigger.

218
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So it's like, you know, Square's not showing Chrono a little bit of love and that's kind of sad. Oh God, and who asked for Legend of Mana? Who did that?

219
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Like, why are we getting these games redone and not Chrono Trigger?

220
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
The same people that are asking for all these Pikmin sequels.

221
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I guess, or a Pikmin Niantic game, I guess.

222
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Oh God.

223
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
ActDeft in chat says, I did, shut up. And to you I say, no you.

224
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Enjoy, well you won ActDeft, you get your game, the rest of us are still waiting for Chrono Trigger. Alright.

225
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Alright, now we're just delving it. Now we've gone past Stupid Question into Fanboy Wars.

226
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So it is definitely time to change the topic and get into our gaming weeks. Let's talk about the types of games we've been playing this week.

227
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

228
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It was pretty good. I've been kind of sucking up on Animal Crossing actually so I'm back into playing.

229
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And I have been doing a lot of studying for Dead by Daylight because I realized that as much as I love playing Legion one cannot live by Legion alone.

230
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Even though there's four of them, but I only play Julie.

231
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
So I've been watching survivors.

232
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I gotta say, sorry, it's just so interesting that I am watching random Twitch channels and I'll see you in chat all of a sudden and I'm like, oh shit, Jamie fell down this hole hard too.

233
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
It's not just me.

234
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
The lore is so interesting to me.

235
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Yeah, no it is.

236
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I mean, well, you know what, how I get with with a game if I'm going to be invested in it, then I'm going to be really invested in it. I am going to just watch so much and try to learn so much and read the character bios and everything that that's just how I function.

237
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:24,000
You know, I don't know if I'm going to love something I will love it completely.

238
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Does that make sense?

239
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yes, of course it does.

240
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So at any rate, I've been watching a lot of survivors streaming.

241
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And I've made some some decent friends on the way I ran into.

242
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I have funny enough I ran into another OLR fan.

243
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
By, it's Flea, F-L-E-E.

244
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Oh yeah, I see Flea around sometimes yeah.

245
00:30:48,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Yeah, and I've run into him a few times and actually we met up in, was it in, I'm trying to remember his chat it was in, I know that I followed him to LeppinNA's channel.

246
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So A, Dead by DLI streamers chat of some sort.

247
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Yeah.

248
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So at any rate, I've been watching a lot of survivors because I want to know what the survivors tactics are so I can know what to look out for because I'm only going to ever play a killer.

249
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You have to keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

250
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Exactly, I'm doing surveillance.

251
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:34,000
But I have to go back and play certain characters to get certain perks, even though I'm going to hate it.

252
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I have to play Bubba.

253
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I know for the ever elusive barbecue and chili, or you just you take a gamble and you wait for it to show up in the store.

254
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Which it does every what five years.

255
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Oh, yeah, people tell me it like the last time they had seen it in, in the archive was like two years ago. Oh geez.

256
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
So yeah, I have to play Bubba.

257
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
After Bubba I have to play Vomie Mommy.

258
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
The plague.

259
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Um, because I need her was infectious fear or something is your, I gotta watch how much we delve into the dead by daylight chat tonight, especially after last week but let me ask this real quick.

260
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Because I think you know the OLR people that have been kind of listening to this whole saga as we're falling further and further down this rabbit hole. Remember that you were like the first to like push me to try to play as Freddy, and all this.

261
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:35,000
So my kind of question is as your favorite killer changed is your favorite killer legion at this point or now that you've jumped into the lore is your favorite killer kind of somebody else or is it still Freddie.

262
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Okay, character story wise.

263
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
My favorite is Rin, the spirit. Okay, sure.

264
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Because I feel so sorry for her. Okay, as a character, just really sad story.

265
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Um, I think for fun though I'm really like I want to eventually main nurse.

266
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And I know she's hard. But I also really like Legion because I kind of just think that their character concept is interesting. And, and you know how my play style is is I like to kind of, if I'm gonna, if I'm gonna melee I'm gonna fucking melee.

267
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:24,000
So I like using feral frenzy, you know, and I've actually even in one game I kind of learned how to control feral frenzy a little bit better.

268
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:40,000
But I, I like playing as Julie, I mean, I like the character skin she looks great. I like the masks and they're just a cool series of characters. But my goal with going to Legion was to learn how to deal with the motion sickness for speeding up so fast,

269
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
so that I can move on to playing nurse.

270
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Okay. All right. All I can say, sorry, before we kind of move away from the dead by daylight chat I was saying all I can say is that I like, I'm more excited to do a twitch con than I have been in a very long time, because I feel like because of this game

271
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I am actively more participating with more streamers and that than I used to before. And I didn't watch twitch I watched plenty of it, but I feel like I'm more actively involved with a lot of that than I was before.

272
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So there is that. So, I think it's excellent. I mean, and it really, I'm noticing a lot of female streamers. Yes, queer streamers, and a lot of queer streamers, and sometimes both.

273
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Yep. And the thing that I think is also fun is that sometimes I'm running into streamers like, especially the play survivors who have other people on their, their audio with them.

274
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So you can hear how they plan.

275
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Yeah, and for me that just expands the, the whole aspect of it to me I think it's great.

276
00:34:50,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It was fascinating the first time I did a Freddie game and one of the survivors had TTV in their name so I was able to go and watch after because I'm not going to do it during the match that's not cool.

277
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:14,000
But after I went and watched from her perspective, and it was fascinating. So, oh yeah, I kind of want to do that when. Well, it's almost like when our band director used to record our performances and then play them for us the next day at school.

278
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Yeah, I would love to watch my own performance from that third person view. I want to quickly I don't usually do these during the show I usually acknowledge all of these things after the show but it's hard for me not to say the anonymous

279
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
gift or just gifted 10 subs in our chat and that's not cheap to do.

280
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:45,000
So I just yeah I really want to express my appreciation to whoever you are out there. You did it anonymously for a reason so I probably should have stopped the show to acknowledge that, but it still is just one of those things where I'm I'm always blown

281
00:35:45,000 --> 00:36:00,000
away. Even if it's 10 bits, or it's you know 28 months straight or whatever it is worth the subs. I am always really blown away by the generosity and so forth of the listeners we have this program, and fog network in general so thank you thank you thank you to all of you

282
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:08,000
and I will I will read all of that after the show as I usually do. Anyway, dark soccer anything else besides Dead by Daylight?

283
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Well just my other point is that I'm going to be streaming quite a bit more often myself I've been getting my stream put together I sent you music for my stream.

284
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I totally thought that was music for this stream. I got excited.

285
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Rob. What? I will graciously also donate it to Orange Island Radio. Oh, I was gonna say just maybe take it as a hint that you need to write more music because there's a lot of places to use it. For the record, I did an expanded version of it.

286
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Oh, okay good. For the roughly three minutes, and it will, it can loop just fine. So you didn't get the, when I texted you saying this is great, can it be three minutes, you didn't know where I was going.

287
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I thought you were saying you prefer that three minutes for your stream.

288
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And I was like well I only need a couple of minutes.

289
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:08,000
So funny. No, I do. I have absolutely no problem I'm pretty proud of it. It's great. That's why that's why I just assumed it was for this.

290
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I was using my city pop music that I made that I mean, I wouldn't mind playing it, you know, at the end of an episode sometime, but I, it was too long.

291
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I mean, I wanted something that was a little bit more loopy sounding and not necessarily a full song like my city pop song that I did. Jamie you are the musician and you have full creative control if you want to write a song and use it on vogue, and your personal

292
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
stream quite frankly you have that right, so go off sis.

293
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,000
But the whole point was that I wanted something that sounded a little bit more loop and less full song. So, yeah, I gotcha.

294
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:52,000
All right, well, y'all will hear it next week. Maybe, if I can get the video updated because there's changes I want to make to that too but anyway, moving on.

295
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

296
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I played Minecraft, more on that server that I've been on so that collusion MC thing so been filming stuff just building some basic farms tearing down those same farms again after I get tired of the not working quite right.

297
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Had a pretty exciting night, a few nights ago some now trying to put together my first episode, and edit that down.

298
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:35,000
But, which is being stupid well OBS started being stupid at first and didn't record locally my stream day did last Saturday. So I don't know why that is, because it went out in the Twitch is fine so I downloaded off Twitch but it's a variable bit rate or variable

299
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:50,000
frame rate or whatever. And so premieres like I don't know what to do with this. So, now I had to export from Twitch to YouTube, and then I'm going to rip it from YouTube, to put in from here it's, it's a pain in the butt.

300
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I've been fighting with this for like hours today.

301
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Do you have access to Adobe Media Encoder as part of Creative Cloud, because you can fix it there. I, I do but it's not it's just because it's it's variable frame rate, there's another app I had to fix it as well and it ran, it was processing for an hour

302
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:18,000
to happen it failed at the last second, send it, send it to me and I'll use compressor to fix it. Now I'll just download it. I've already uploaded it to YouTube, I'm just going to download it with I have a 4k video downloader, you know work just fine.

303
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:30,000
It's just it's, it's just annoying. So I was recording voiceovers and stuff for that today. I've been working on building like an anime logo or whatever for YouTube, I have something cheap. And then that's it.

304
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
So, but yeah, a lot, lots of exciting stuff.

305
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Alright, sounds good. My Gaming Week, a lot of the same stuff I also play Dead by Daylight, which we've talked enough about. I've also been playing.

306
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I played Geometry Wars 2 isn't that random but I just went into my Xbox list and I was like what do I want to play and I was like I'm gonna play that. And I did and it was fun.

307
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I love that it looks it. It's so different looking now than it was when I was on 360 because now you know there's that little like HDR in it and it just looks even better on my TV it's it's wonderful.

308
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I also played some more No Man's Sky, big surprise I'm sure but there was actually a bug that was stopping me from playing that game for about a week, because I had a quest and I could not finish the quest because it was bugged.

309
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Thankfully they did a build that they just pushed on like Thursday or Friday that fixed said bug. So I was able to progress again so that was very nice I'm still working on the third part of the expedition, which is a very grindy part.

310
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I just finished my 15th fleet mission and now I need to do like two more space anomalies and like, I think three or four more raid the alien sculptures and get the stuff there.

311
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:58,000
The only bummer is that not every time you get a planetary chart does it send you to the thing you need. So it's just a lot of grinding but I'm still having a good time with it, I wouldn't play it if it wasn't fun.

312
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
So there is that.

313
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Let's see. And other things I played this week Oh Final Fantasy 14 and now Rob talks about that every week so I'm sure that's not a surprise but there was a brand new content patch that hit on Tuesdays that's important.

314
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:30,000
The 5.5 content patch hit which expanded the main story a little bit. There's a brand new dungeon there's a new raid. So here's the interesting thing. There are three raids right now in Final Fantasy shadow bringers that are based off of Nier, automata.

315
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I had done the first one the copied factory back in five one which, if nothing else you guys listen to the soundtrack. Oh my god, because I mean, near has a great soundtrack to begin with, but like the boss fight in the copied factory mixes a near song with

316
00:41:49,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Final Fantasy song, and it like it's so good. It's so good. And the nice thing is the end. So I actually did the second part the puppets bunker I think it's called, I was a little behind on that one I hadn't done it yet.

317
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I finally did it this last week, and I did the brand brand new one this week as well. I got to see all that for the first time and I completely already forgot what the new ones called, but I did that as well.

318
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Every end boss has a near song mixed with a Final Fantasy song. I think the first one is the best, but they're all pretty good. And the last boss of the last raid is pretty great. She's like a train boss. So is Misty out there trains.

319
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Because like there's a part where there's like rails that go through the arena, and you got to find the ones with the red light, and you hear little ding ding ding and then the trains go zooming by, and if you're on a track.

320
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Like a Doom train? Yeah, well not really because it's near so it's a little bit different. But if you're on the green light ones and you get flacked by a train and fall out the platform so that's not very fun.

321
00:42:49,000 --> 00:43:02,000
And then it does some other really cool stuff to where like a building will form underneath the platform, and then it'll go ding ding ding and the building will go whoosh, and like it'll fly up through the platform and if you're standing where the building goes you go flying too.

322
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:15,000
So it's kind of interesting. It's a very cool raid of some cool mechanics. I could not explain there's that third boss in there for those that are playing the game. I still don't know what the hell was happening in that fight that was crazy, but I had a good time.

323
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:29,000
It was good to be able to run that with friends. Both those later raids. So I've done all the Nier raids in Final Fantasy and I will say, I will admit, because I swear to God we get an email on this once a month.

324
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Rob, have you finished Nier Automata yet? Nothing has made me want to play Nier Automata more than doing those raids this past week where I was like, God this game is so good.

325
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And the music is so good. I really need to go finish that up. So there you go. That's my gaming week. A little more Final Fantasy and so forth.

326
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:02,000
We will get into the news. Let me quickly mention a little programming note. So I talked about this a little bit last week, the bonus stream for Shane's definitive Pokemon ranking.

327
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I had said maybe we'll do it last Thursday. Well, we didn't do it because I, as I mentioned at the top of the show, I was really sick from those sites. So like I basically lost two days of my week and I needed Wednesday and Thursday to catch up on stuff myself.

328
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:25,000
So Shane and I are going to do that stream this Thursday. So on the 22nd, we're going to do the Shane's definitive Pokemon ranking stream.

329
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:38,000
So that'll be Thursday night, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern. So same time as OLR. And we'll be going over Shane's top Pokemon. We are not going to be able to rank all 850 because I don't have all fucking night.

330
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:46,000
But we will at least get into around, we're thinking maybe the top 50. We'll talk about a little bit there. So we'll get into that. It's enough to try. It is.

331
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And I was hoping maybe Shane might do his top 50 and maybe like his bottom 10. I do want to hear the ones he really doesn't like as well. So there we go.

332
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Bobby in chat says, Shane can go all night. Don't hold him back. That is true. But Alan and I have to share streaming on Thursdays a little bit because Thursday is his all killer, no filler night. So I have to share with him a little bit there.

333
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:18,000
All right. So we'll have you guys look forward to that on Thursday. All right. Now we can get into some news. Loki, why don't you start us off?

334
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Yeah, so the PlayStation 5 has gotten some updates regarding the different improvements, including like some console storage or USB storage, because I know that was missing for a while.

335
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So it was really hard to expand your storage, especially since I don't know how many of the SSDs out there of any are fully compatible with the PlayStation 5 right now.

336
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And then, of course, you're not going to be able to directly download to them, but you can move the games on to them once they are downloaded to your SSD.

337
00:45:51,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And then some other stuff. They have cross generational share play, which is pretty cool. So you'll be able to play with PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 players together.

338
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And then also there's going to be the ability to mute people in voice within the groups as well as organize your library better and stuff like that and some PlayStation app improvements.

339
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And then the other thing I saw, too, was some HDMI link that they had where you can actually power on your console and TV together if you have a TV that supports that.

340
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
So neat stuff. I'm glad they have the storage, though. That's pretty nice.

341
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Yeah, I think a lot of people were looking forward to that. And I don't own a PlayStation 5 yet, but I still appreciate these releases because the system is going to be that much better by the time I finally get my hands on one.

342
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:48,000
So, yeah, the only other the other caveat to you about the storage is because it's not the SSD, you can actually play games off of that.

343
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:55,000
So you can basically just download and archive them there, but you actually want to play them. You have to move them to your local storage.

344
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:04,000
So it's OK. It's just, you know, any better if we had those SSDs.

345
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Yeah, it's well, it's also very nice for bandwidth purposes. I think that's the best thing about it.

346
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Yeah, because, like, honestly, I'm looking at a month this month where I might finally go over the bandwidth cap and I don't know what the hell I did to do it, but we are way high on the bandwidth right now.

347
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Oh, that's streaming.

348
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I don't. It might be, but actually I looked and the Xbox is using a crap ton of bandwidth.

349
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I don't know if that was just I think it's I think I turned off automatic updates again because I think it's I think some some fucking games are doing like 40 gig patches and I don't need them.

350
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
So I feel I shut that off again.

351
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I haven't checked, but I'm curious to see how much steam is using to keep probably keeps downloading the updates for cyberpunk, which are like 50 gigabytes.

352
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Interesting. Yeah. So I and a word to those of you that might have metered Internet as well, like check that stuff because it's not it's not great.

353
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,000
So it's a big reason why I actually tell steam not to launch a startup.

354
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Yeah. And turned all that crap off so that it's not even running in the background.

355
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,000
It sucks that I can't do that, but it is what it is because there's no competitor to the service I have out here.

356
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
So it's a bummer anyway. But you can turn off steam.

357
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,000
No, no, no. I mean, like the bandwidth issues. Yeah. So but yeah, no, I do turn off steam.

358
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I don't have steam launch when the system launches for a very similar reason.

359
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I don't need it updating everything for games that are in my backlog that I barely touch.

360
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
You know what I mean? That is annoying. Yeah, it is. All right.

361
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Let's talk about another PlayStation issue. This one is not as great news.

362
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:56,000
This information that's coming out, it has to do with something called CMOS and what it's doing to older PlayStations,

363
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
as well as confirmed PlayStation five, apparently this past week.

364
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
So what is going on here? There's something called the CMOS battery.

365
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
You have one of these inside every PlayStation three and PlayStation four.

366
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,000
These are used to keep track of the time that is on the system, even if the system is unplugged.

367
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:23,000
That's why it's a battery. OK, so any time this battery is bad, then basically the system goes,

368
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
oh, you need to check the time on the server because it may be out of sync with reality.

369
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:35,000
OK, on PlayStation three, this always happens when you go into a game on PlayStation Store.

370
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
And you might remember when you I don't know how many of you played PlayStation three games recently,

371
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,000
but you could install games and they would have a countdown clock on them until the game is basically unlocked.

372
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
So that's part of the reason why this timing was important.

373
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:58,000
This also exists on the PlayStation four because it does a check when you install a game from a disk and so forth to just confirm the consistency.

374
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:05,000
And I believe trophy data is an issue on the PlayStation four as well, because if it didn't do that,

375
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
then you would be able to kind of time skip and exploit certain trophies that way.

376
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:19,000
So most people have no idea that this could be a thing later on because these batteries have an average life of about 10 to 20 years.

377
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
So especially in a PlayStation four, nobody's really starting to run out yet.

378
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Some folks may start to notice it on the PlayStation three as well,

379
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:37,000
but it's not like it's that easy just to replace the battery and resync PSN, especially if they're going to shut down PSN on the PlayStation three.

380
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
In fact, if you think about it and go years and years into the future, there's not going to be time servers anymore.

381
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,000
So eventually these systems will try to run checks on games. It's not going to be able to do them.

382
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:55,000
It's not going to play games. And this is freaking a lot of people out, potentially prematurely.

383
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:08,000
But it's freaking people out because they're worried about game preservation and the discs that they buy suddenly having a system that will no longer be able to run those discs.

384
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And you have some people that are like, well, what if I want to give this console to my kids someday and let them play the games?

385
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Because this battery issue, I'm not going to be able to do it. By the way, this issue also exists in PlayStation five.

386
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:30,000
They actually had a volunteer basically sacrifice a PS five to be looked at inside and see, is this an issue in the PlayStation five as well?

387
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And it turns out the answer is yes. And that was all discovered by a Twitter account called Does It Play?

388
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:45,000
So obviously, this shouldn't be an issue for any PlayStation five owner right now, because, again, those batteries will last a long time.

389
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:53,000
But it certainly has a lot of people going, but what if? And a lot of people are instantly jumping to the worst case scenario.

390
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Like they do. As people tend to do. Again, back to the good old line of it doesn't matter what the facts are.

391
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:10,000
It only matters what perception is. And now the perception is out there that your PlayStation is a ticking time bomb.

392
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:16,000
And what's going to explode? Your ability to play any game that you've ever owned for the system.

393
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:23,000
That is the perception that's out there. The headlines and the hundred, I'm sorry, two hundred and eighty character tweets are putting out there right now.

394
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:33,000
And so this is more and more creating a problem from Sony for Sony, who already does not have the best reputation when it comes to the preservation of digital games.

395
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:42,000
On to, of course, the PlayStation three issue we were talking about last week and the Vita and the PSP with the stores are going to be closing soon.

396
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,000
By the way, just an aside, because I thought this was interesting because it came up on our Discord.

397
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
So we like to check up on our Discord every now and then over at VOG Network dot com.

398
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
That's VOG Network dot com slash Discord.

399
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:12,000
And there was some very interesting insight there from one of our listeners, 13X Forever, who is a regular listener of the show, I believe, on the podcast feed and was kind of giving some feedback there about, oh, did you hear the one about how people suddenly couldn't download DLC anymore?

400
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,000
And all of that broke. And oh, my gosh. Well, guess what? It was fixed.

401
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Somebody was able to and he kind of laid out all the technical. How did it happen?

402
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
And he's like, I bet nobody's going to report on the fact that it was fixed.

403
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Well, here we are. You're welcome. But I get I but I think I don't think he cares about us specifically.

404
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I think it's more of the greater gaming media because, yes, the doom and gloom about PlayStation.

405
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Oh, yeah. Oh, here we go already. You can't fit. You can't patch your games. We're all fucked.

406
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:49,000
We're not going to be able to play these games anymore. I think he has a point. How many of those same outlets are going to run the headline?

407
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Never mind.

408
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Again. Bad news. Bad publicity is good publicity.

409
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I suppose so, isn't it? Anyway, Zen Monkey 11 in chat says people just noticed now.

410
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I've been saying that since the PlayStation three Zen Monkey.

411
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I think this is resurfacing because of the PlayStation Network news from a couple of weeks ago.

412
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,000
And the fact that it is still going now confirmed this week on PlayStation five.

413
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,000
That's kind of the headline of why it's rearing its head again this week.

414
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Has anyone ever actually had a problem with a cartridge and the battery failing on a cartridge from back in the day?

415
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,000
You remember how those Zelda cartridges came with a warning? The battery won't last forever.

416
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:41,000
When did that finally happen? Dark soccer. I don't I I don't play games in any more so.

417
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I don't remember. It was like what like I want to say it was like some other game.

418
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:56,000
It wasn't one of our it might have been one of our Zelda's. But I mean, you just go buy any battery and re solder solder it, you know.

419
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Yeah. And I know our Saturn batteries have worn out like a bunch of times.

420
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
And I suppose that's what people are saying.

421
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
You're going to have to do these PlayStation three and PlayStation four issues someday is, you know, basically fix the battery.

422
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:17,000
But I would think, couldn't Sony just put out a firmware patch that changes this, especially especially for PlayStation three?

423
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
We'd like to think that. Not gonna because.

424
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Do you think that you think this is going to put pressure on them to do so, especially in light of the fact that they are closing the store?

425
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Do you think there's going to be pressure? Well, if you're not going to sell the software anymore, then get rid of this fucking check.

426
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,000
That's ruining our disk based games. Do you think they're going to have that pressure?

427
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:47,000
No, I think the pressure is there, but I'm not sure what will what will actually hold them accountable.

428
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
What are people going to do? Not buy a PS five?

429
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Well, some of us don't have one. Yeah. Well, yeah, it's like most of us are not buying a PS five, but it's not for lack of trying.

430
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:05,000
You know what I mean? So it's just it's it's it's just interesting because I do think there's probably going to be that pressure on social media.

431
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:15,000
And I absolutely believe Sony will be asked about it when they start doing some of these summer, you know, appearances for whatever they're going to promote this summer and so forth.

432
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:21,000
But what is actually going to hold them accountable? There's money there.

433
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Well, there's there's actually talk this whole thing. Some people are saying we need laws on the book.

434
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:37,000
We need laws that essentially a computing device must play the software that was made for it.

435
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Even after basically after the online is not supported or forever, basically, that computing thing must play the software made for said computing thing and that perhaps this might be something that's legislated.

436
00:56:50,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Nobody wants that. Now, I know I'm jumping I'm jumping to a little far out there, but that that could be the thing that holds Sony accountable.

437
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:09,000
There's going to be, though, there has to be some special wording about that to avoid pirate pirated and non.

438
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Approved games. I don't know another word to say for it, you know.

439
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Like what's to say that someone like like like the tango Nintendo thing, you know.

440
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Yeah. Or, well, this burn of this game is intended to be played on it. We only use that.

441
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Well, yeah, yeah, you're right. There would have to be something written in there that it would be, you know, the pirated stuff doesn't count, of course.

442
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
We know that. Yeah. So, yeah.

443
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Or I would say unlicensed unlicensed material. Yeah.

444
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Unlicensed software. Sure.

445
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,000
S.H.O. 100 Matt in chat says the pressure is there, but the folks who should care don't.

446
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:50,000
And that goes to what Rob was saying last week. They need a counterpunch to Phil Spencer.

447
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
They as in Sony.

448
00:57:52,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says I found my Sega Genesis X band modem and the battery in there obviously died because it lost all my settings and it doesn't keep settings and I make new ones.

449
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Also continues with another comment. The right to repair is a big deal.

450
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,000
So people won't be beholden to the Apple Genius bar to fix their iPhone or MacBook.

451
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
They're not. All they have to do is call.

452
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
So but but but.

453
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I but not just with the sense of Apple or whatever computing device, but the right to ask somebody to change the battery in my Sony device should be a thing I'm able to do, which I believe it is.

454
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I don't think that I think it used to be like if you don't go to a Sony approved thing, you're in violation of your warranty.

455
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Not that warranties matter at the point that you're talking about changing the battery in your frickin console.

456
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
But I get it. I get it.

457
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:52,000
If it were me, I would have done it to where you can change the battery out like you can with the Saturn.

458
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I mean, it's really easy to change the battery on the Saturn.

459
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
You know, you should have a little slot that you can change out your your battery.

460
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

461
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Absolutely. Whosever cat that is.

462
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:16,000
All right. That is that is Smush screaming because it's dinnertime and other daddy has just shown up in the kitchen who and dared to pick up the food bowl.

463
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
So now Smush knows what's about to happen. So he's losing.

464
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
It's also my cat in the background.

465
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Oh, we have dueling cats. Lovely.

466
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
And Midna is sitting out there.

467
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Midna is sitting quietly in the other chair in the room.

468
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Well, just sitting there like a little lady.

469
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
We can't all have a well-behaved cat.

470
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Well behaved.

471
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
All right. Let's move on.

472
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Dark soccer. What else can't we have?

473
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
We can't have Lord of the Rings games.

474
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Well, at least from Amazon.

475
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:50,000
So Amazon's video game division canceled an online role playing game.

476
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
It was based on Lord of the Rings. It was announced in twenty nineteen.

477
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:01,000
It had been in developed by a dad that the words it had been in development by Amazon Game Studios,

478
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:13,000
along with a China based Leo Technologies holding that actually it was acquired by Tencent.

479
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Also another Chinese company.

480
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:25,000
So this led to contract negotiations and a huge ass dispute between Amazon and Tencent that basically had the game canceled.

481
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:34,000
So they've been unable to secure their their terms so that they can proceed with developing the game.

482
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,000
They said that the development team is going to be moved on to other projects.

483
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
And this is just another thing, because I haven't really released anything successful.

484
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:49,000
You know, Amazon's track record on game publication leaves a lot to be desired.

485
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Yes. And we're now five years down the line.

486
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
They've canceled Breakaway and Crucible. They canceled.

487
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Well, they've delayed New World. We're not going to get anything out of them.

488
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,000
And I think all that money that was going to go to the Lord of the Rings game is now going to go to that TV show.

489
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I'm sure you saw that headline about how one season of the Lord of the Rings TV show is something like it's it's damn near half a billion dollars.

490
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Damn close, like 460 million or something like that.

491
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Yeah, it's a lot of that's a lot of fucking money.

492
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I'm pretty sure that New World is going to be so indefinitely delayed that by the by the time if it did come out, no one's going to care.

493
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
It'll be slightly used world at that point.

494
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Or it will it will need like a major graphical overhaul before they could release it.

495
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Yeah, that's that's sadly true, is that if a game's in development too long, then oops.

496
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Now we missed the bar for the graphical fidelity we were going for the first time.

497
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Exactly. All right. Let's talk about that big expo that happens every June where we're going to find out what games will be coming out.

498
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Hopefully, actually, some things that get announced to E3 do end up getting canceled.

499
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I'm sorry, Loki, this is actually your piece. I'm still stepping on top of you here. Loki, tell us about this.

500
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:14,000
All right. So E3 slots of different announcements as far as what we can expect.

501
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,000
It's not necessarily E3, some of the most of the stuff that they've announced is just stuff we had last year.

502
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,000
So we have the Wholesome Direct, which is coming in May, Summer Games Fest, June.

503
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:30,000
And of course, E3 is going to be between June 12th through the 15th.

504
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,000
So far, they've got Ubisoft Forward coming June 12th at 3 p.m. Eastern.

505
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:42,000
And then, of course, the ever exciting PC Gaming Show plus Future Games Show that's on June 13th.

506
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:51,000
And then we have PAX Online July 15th through the 18th with Game Developers Conference following that in July 19th through the 23rd.

507
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,000
And then at some point, Gamescom opening night live on August 24th.

508
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:04,000
So that's what your summer of game announcements is looking like so far.

509
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Yeah, not a lot of details with who's actually presenting each thing.

510
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:16,000
But I'm hoping that we'll get some more announcements, especially Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, I guess Activision.

511
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:22,000
You know, there's other companies out there, obviously, that have things that they haven't announced yet when they're going to have their press conferences.

512
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Microsoft especially, they always do something around that time.

513
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
So we need to see when those announcements are going to be.

514
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
But it's still way early. I mean, we're in April still. It's two months away at least.

515
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I was going to say, under two months at this point. We're in April 18th.

516
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Yeah, true. Yeah, it's also the end of the month.

517
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Less than 60 days, y'all.

518
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:48,000
So, yeah, I actually say we should be hearing a little more specifics about who's going to kind of present what when pretty soon, I would think.

519
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:56,000
And I understand that we're not going to have a thing in person, but I'm kind of surprised they aren't trying to do something kind of smaller in person, even if not.

520
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I don't know. But I guess I guess, you know, we don't want to get too ahead of ourselves when it comes to COVID and declaring victory on that too early.

521
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:12,000
So I'm just a little surprised they're not trying to do something small, especially for the people that really, really are in the industry who kind of need to do it.

522
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Because they are doing conventions in some places.

523
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:20,000
It's just, you know, looks looks a little different than what you might think and probably not the E3 that you're used to.

524
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
But anyway. All right.

525
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Well, let's move on and talk about an awards ceremony that doesn't usually involve video games.

526
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
It's the Hugo Awards. So Hugo Awards is it's science.

527
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:40,000
It's for science fiction and fantasy writing. The Hugo Awards are usually done at the World Science Fiction Convention.

528
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,000
And this is there's going to be the seventy ninth is coming up in August.

529
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,000
This is going to be the first year that they're actually going to honor a video game.

530
01:04:50,000 --> 01:05:01,000
And they have announced the finalists for what is going to be declared as the Wendy Hugo Award, I guess the first Hugo Award for best video game.

531
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:08,000
And the finalists include Hades and Animal Crossing.

532
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
And a lot of people are kind of raising their eyebrows to Animal Crossing.

533
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:17,000
It's certainly not a bad game. I'm not here to say that. But it just you don't usually think science fiction.

534
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:23,000
When you think of animal. Well, maybe it is for some folks. I don't know. But anyway, other games that are nominated.

535
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:30,000
The Last of Us, part two, Spiritfarer, Blaseball and the Final Fantasy seven remake.

536
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
So kind of an interesting lineup of games there. Nominated.

537
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
As much as I love Animal Crossing, it doesn't tell a story. Yeah, it is.

538
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Unless you're writing fanfiction based about, you know, your rivalry with Phil the Bird.

539
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Maybe that's what it is, is the the head canon, so to speak, that people are writing for themselves since it is.

540
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Oh, my God. Who hit Ed with the bug net?

541
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:05,000
I suppose they're just just the stories of island life and adventure that people are creating, because it is a pretty powerful tool for that stuff.

542
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:11,000
So. The day Marshall left me.

543
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Anyway, not nominated, which surprises a lot of people, Half Life, Alex.

544
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Now, that's a game you think of science fiction and all that, and it got pretty good accolades last year.

545
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:28,000
So it's a little bit surprising that that one is not there, but it is what it is.

546
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I don't know where the nominees came from.

547
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I'm sure they have a process that's outlined somewhere that I just don't have in front of me right now.

548
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
But that's that's the list.

549
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I'm looking in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

550
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
And Bobby says, Is Blaseball even a video game?

551
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I thought it was just a Web site to which Pixel Pacas replies.

552
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,000
It's a Web game of sorts. Quest Buster says it's a bizarre lineup, to say the least.

553
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Yeah, it is. I'd be very interested, like kind of like how they came up with this list.

554
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Not that I'm questioning it. I mean, it's, you know, their award ceremony, whatever.

555
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
But I'm just kind of curious, like, how did how did something like Blaseball get in there?

556
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Which I I think I've maybe heard about that once or twice ever.

557
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
But but interestingly enough, I say that.

558
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Yet I look at the replies to this tweet and like the first two are all like, go Blaseball, like the first two.

559
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
So it definitely has its fans that are thrilled about that.

560
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
So. All right.

561
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Anyway, let's move on. Dark Sakura. Oh, something something we were talking about kind of earlier in the show a little bit, right?

562
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Indeed. We are getting back to GameStop and stonks.

563
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
The stonks. Oh, anyway, I'm sorry.

564
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I have to say so. Bobby is saying this is the third year of the award.

565
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Apparently, it was won by Bandersnatch in twenty nineteen and in twenty twenty.

566
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
The outer worlds won it. Well, I swear what I was looking at said it was the first.

567
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Is there are they changing?

568
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
They're honoring a video game for the first time.

569
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Says pretty clearly, clearly here. I'm trying to see if like it's a different than what they posted something about the Nebula Award.

570
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
OK, so maybe it was. Oh, OK.

571
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:19,000
So there was an award for game writing, but not necessarily just for the video game period.

572
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
That I think is the difference there. Interesting. All right.

573
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Sorry. Back to Game Stonk. Game stink.

574
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Anyway, their CEO, George Sherman,

575
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:49,000
by the way, is under some speculation about leaving the company, got rid of about 12 million dollars in shares of stock.

576
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:57,000
And basically, those proceeds are earmarked by the company to pay compensation related taxes.

577
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:10,000
That's seventy six thousand ninety seven shares were withheld by Game Stonk upon vesting to cover taxes from the twenty nineteen inducement award.

578
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
And that's according actually to a regulatory filing from Friday.

579
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:22,000
The shares were valued at one hundred and fifty six dollars and forty four cents each or about eleven point nine million.

580
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Game Stonk hasn't hasn't commented on it, but.

581
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Ryan Cohen, who is their incoming chairman.

582
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Is is basically he forfeited ninety eight million in compensation after failing to help them meet their performance targets.

583
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
So we'll see.

584
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Well, that's nice to see someone not get an award because they didn't do what they said they were going to do.

585
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Too many times we hear about these executives getting huge ass bonuses when it's like you didn't do anything.

586
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
You made you made the situation worse, in fact. So I guess there's that.

587
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:10,000
But I'm still always kind of raises eyebrows when you see an executive sell off a big amount of stock like that, even though it sounds like they're kind of trying to explain it.

588
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
But where's that money come from? It still means that ship is sinking.

589
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Yeah. Where's that money come from? All the people that was trying to send Game Stop to the moon and held out.

590
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Right. That's where that money is going to come from. Right. So anyway, we'll see how that goes.

591
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Moving on. Loki kind of wrapping up some big announcements from this week, right?

592
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Yep. So we had another Nintendo indie world, I guess, direct, if you will.

593
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:43,000
And lots of different games were kind of announced, different things coming to the switch.

594
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:53,000
So, of course, some of the highlights there. We had looks like Cris Tales, which looks like a pretty cool looking JRPG.

595
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Road 96, which is a procedural road trip adventure game.

596
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:03,000
They showed some more gameplay of Ninja Turtles Shredder's Revenge, which looks awesome.

597
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I can't wait to play that. It looks good. They had Olli Olli World is going to be coming to the switch as well.

598
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:16,000
The House of the Dead remake. I'm curious to see how that works out.

599
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I wonder if the actual Joy-Cons can work as like kind of like gun type things.

600
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Otherwise, it'll be kind of weird with the analog sticks. But yeah, excited about that.

601
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Looks pretty cool. What else? Oxen Free 2 lost signals.

602
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:40,000
So that's pretty sweet. And that's coming later this year. What else?

603
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Skull the Hero Slayer. The Aztec Forgotten Gods.

604
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,000
And a game called... what was it?

605
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Aerial Knights Never Yield. So lots of cool looking stuff.

606
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:07,000
And, of course, Fez also was something that, you know, it's been out on every platform, but now it's also coming.

607
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Oh, who cares? Sorry, but that game is long past its prime.

608
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:20,000
What about there was that Konami game that showed up in the indie showcase that kind of raised a lot of eyebrows, right?

609
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:28,000
So it's a remake of an old Konami game. And they were saying it's a game. It never came out here.

610
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
So it's not one that most people here would know.

611
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:40,000
That's it. But they say that kind of had a huge influence on the Ninja Turtles game, the Konami one.

612
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Not the arcade game, but the original Konami Ninja Turtles game that some people loved and some people thought was difficult garbage.

613
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Do they have an underwater dam level in that game as well?

614
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I don't think so, but I'm assuming they have something just as frustrating in it.

615
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:02,000
But a lot of people are kind of raising their eyebrows because it's like, what is it? What is Konami doing at the indie expo?

616
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Is that what we've kind of reduced ourselves to? But my understanding is that it's still kind of being indie developed.

617
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
It's Konami publishing it, right?

618
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Yeah, that makes more sense. Yeah.

619
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:23,000
So but, you know, now, of course, then that has everybody running crazy, like, oh, Konami is back and they're going to do Silent Hill next.

620
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Look out. It's kind of like one of those, hold on, put the car in park. We're not ready for that yet.

621
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
You know, let's let's see what happens with this still.

622
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says supposedly it's a roguelike. And yeah, the NES original was apparently inspired by GFD's engine, from what I heard.

623
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Yeah, like it was kind of like a similar engine or something like that. So interesting that we're getting that.

624
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Yeah, it's very unexpected.

625
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Yeah. All right. Moving on, let's talk about this. So Nintendo has taken the leader of Team Executor to court.

626
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,000
But you're not going to see that headline anywhere.

627
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Nope, the headline you're going to see is Nintendo suing Bowser, LOL, because yes, Team Executor is led by a guy named Gary Bowser.

628
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:20,000
And isn't that ironic that it also happens to be the name of the current American, you know, head, American president of Nintendo is Doug Bowser.

629
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
So LOL, all these Bowser's all over Nintendo.

630
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:29,000
But I guess it doesn't make us exciting of a headline when we say Nintendo is going after the leader of Team Executor.

631
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:34,000
It's nope. Nintendo is going after Bowser. Anyhow, so what's going on here?

632
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
So Nintendo did file a lawsuit against Gary Bowser.

633
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
He is the head of the Switch hacking group Team Executor.

634
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:47,000
And why are they suing him? Because of allegedly violating copyright by making and selling hacks.

635
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
This is not the first time this guy has been in the news.

636
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
And you might be thinking this as well, like, didn't this already happen?

637
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Yeah, he was arrested in the fall and they thought, you know, this, this would be it.

638
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:05,000
But no, the company wants to punish the leader for the copyright violation and two counts of trafficking.

639
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Basically, they are alleging that this guy runs an international pirate ring, distributes the SX Core, the SX Lite, and the SX Pro, these Switch-oriented hacking tools.

640
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
And Team Executor is alleged to be selling this for profit.

641
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,000
And if successful, Nintendo gets to shut down the operations.

642
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:33,000
They get $2,500 for each traffic device and $150,000 per copyright violation.

643
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,000
So the financial penalties are going to be very, very large.

644
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:47,000
And that means this Team Executor will be done for, assuming Nintendo wins this, which these types of cases are going to be very hard on the defendant.

645
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I mean, we'll see, but I bet it's a settlement before it ever goes there, but we'll see.

646
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Anyway, is it any surprise to anyone?

647
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Nintendo has really been cracking down on this type of stuff lately, especially, I mean, they do it for the old stuff, too.

648
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:07,000
But especially now that we're talking about the current gen stuff, the Switch, Nintendo does not like to see that.

649
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network is saying such great comments as Bowser on Bowser action, Bowser v. Bowser, two Bowsers, one Switch, a tale of two Bowsers.

650
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
A Bowser will win this case, but who?

651
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Thank you, chat, for providing all of that lovely commentary.

652
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
All those headlines.

653
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Gold.

654
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Yeah, all those things I can name my YouTube on this later on, so.

655
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
So much gold.

656
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Dark Tetsuya says, you think this guy would try to stay off Nintendo's radar with a name like that?

657
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Yeah, yeah.

658
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
So the Bowser jokes, they just don't stop.

659
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
But there you go.

660
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Black Compat-

661
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Ain't no party like a Bowser party.

662
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Black Compat in chat says two Bowsers, one Switch is so wrong.

663
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Lol.

664
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
It kind of is, though.

665
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
It kind of is.

666
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
All right, we need to, we need to cleanse ourselves a little bit.

667
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
We need to cleanse the palette.

668
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
We need it.

669
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
We need something.

670
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,000
We need something nice and family friendly to come in here and fix everything.

671
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
So what-

672
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Family friendly us.

673
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I just spoiled that one.

674
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I hit the wrong button.

675
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Maybe people are already going to be able to tell what is the classic game of the week that Rob just pushed the button for a little early.

676
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Every-

677
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Girl.

678
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Every week, Dark Soccer, it only showed the screen of the publisher.

679
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
That might not totally give it away.

680
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
We'll see.

681
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
It's the classic game of the week.

682
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

683
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Hey, you guys should be checking this game out this week.

684
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
So Dark Soccer, what game?

685
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
It's a game that brought up a bunch.

686
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
You, you have, we've all talked about this game.

687
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
And in fact, very recently did we talk about this game.

688
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
And I think some of you out there-

689
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Yes we did, which was my inspiration.

690
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,000
I think some of you out there were waiting for when we would talk about this game.

691
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,000
And so let's get to it so I can hit the button the correct way this time.

692
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

693
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
The classic game is The Lost Vikings.

694
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:58,000
So The Lost Vikings, it is a puzzle platforming game.

695
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,000
And for the record, when I see Interplay, the first thing I actually think of is Clayfighter,

696
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
just saying.

697
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Yeah.

698
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
So I didn't, I maybe didn't give the whole thing away, but yeah, I accidentally showed

699
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
that Interplay logo there for a hot second.

700
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
And I don't, have I done Clayfighter?

701
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
I don't remember.

702
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Who doesn't?

703
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Who cares?

704
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Anyway, The Lost Vikings, it is a puzzle platforming game that was developed by Silicon and Synapse,

705
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:24,000
which is now Blizzard Entertainment, published by Interplay, as we could see on the logo

706
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
that Rob teased us with.

707
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:33,000
It was originally released on the Super Nintendo, Super Famicom in 1993, and has since been

708
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:41,000
released to the Amiga, Amiga CD32, MS-DOS, Mega Drive, Genesis.

709
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:48,000
And the Mega Drive has a distinction of containing five stages that were not present in any other

710
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:54,000
version of the game and can be played with three players simultaneously, where the SNES

711
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
one was, you have three characters, but two people can play.

712
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,000
That actually kind of struck me funny as why there wasn't a third person play, like using

713
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
a multi-tap or something.

714
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:14,000
But anyway, the game, I'll go into other rereleases and whatnot about it and other versions, but

715
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:19,000
it was released on April 29th, 1993.

716
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:25,000
So we're coming up on the anniversary of the game soon.

717
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:33,000
But in this, you have three Vikings, Erik the Swift, Bylog the Fierce, and Olaf the Stout.

718
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:42,000
They get kidnapped by Tomater, the emperor of the alien, Crutonian empire for a zoo.

719
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
They're going to be in a zoo.

720
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
But they escape and then they get lost in time and they have to go through different

721
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:54,000
places to try to fight Tomater and get home.

722
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:05,000
So at any rate, it is a side schooling platform adventure, but it's also very puzzle oriented.

723
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:12,000
You have to have all three characters alive to beat the puzzles because every puzzle is

724
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,000
going to rely on a strength of one of the three Vikings.

725
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:21,000
So for example, Erik can run faster than the other two.

726
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:27,000
He can jump and bash through walls and enemies with his helmet.

727
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Bylog can kill enemies with his sword or shoot them with a bow.

728
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
He has a lifetime supply of arrows.

729
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
The bow can also hit switches from a distance.

730
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Olaf can block enemies and projectiles with his shield and he can also use a shield as

731
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
a hang glider.

732
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
That doesn't make any sense to me, but oh well.

733
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Olaf's shield can be used as a platform for Bylog to walk over and allow Erik to reach

734
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
higher areas.

735
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:01,000
So if any of the Vikings each have three health points and they can lose it if they get hurt,

736
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
they can lose it if they get hurt or fall from a great height.

737
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,000
And if any one of them loses their health points, he dies and you really can't finish

738
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
the game.

739
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:15,000
You will have to restart the level and try again, but you get unlimited continues.

740
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:21,000
As far as other versions, as I was saying before, it was re-released for the Game Boy

741
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Advance in 2003.

742
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:32,000
In 2014, the game was added to Battle.net as a free download emulated through DOSBox.

743
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:38,000
And for their 30th anniversary, Lost Vikings was re-released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo

744
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One as part of the Blizzard Arcade collection in February

745
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,000
of this year.

746
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:52,000
There also was a sequel called The Lost Vikings 2 that came out in 1997, but who knows?

747
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
It may be its own classic in its own time.

748
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:01,000
So let's get into the many, many appearances of these Vikings.

749
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:06,000
So now there's a game that Dan is super fond of and he's been playing a lot of the new

750
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
rock and roll racing.

751
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:14,000
But in that game, Olaf and Bylog have an appearance in the game.

752
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Olaf can be unlocked as a hidden character and Bylog appears on billboards advertising

753
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Viking Cola on the planet Bogmire.

754
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:29,000
For the 32X version of Blackthorn, all three Vikings are in a secret area in the second

755
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
snow level.

756
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
They've also appeared in Clay Fighter.

757
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Olaf is in Helga's ending with Helga being his girlfriend, but she dumped him for Tiny.

758
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Aww.

759
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Eric and Bylog's faces appear animated in sculptures in the Sage Clay Keep for Clay

760
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Fighter 2 Judgment Clay.

761
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And they were supposed to be appearing in Clay Fighter 3, but that game, well, it didn't

762
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
happen.

763
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Anyway, they've appeared as NPCs in World of Warcraft in the dungeon Uldaman, which

764
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,000
is probably just one of my favorite places because I used to go there to farm stuff before

765
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
they, you know, had it scale up to your level.

766
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
And you can kill them.

767
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Yes, you can kill them.

768
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,000
But at any rate, if you're hoarded, yeah.

769
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:31,000
One of the quests in Uldaman requires you to collect the Shaft of Sol, the Amulet of

770
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Genikiviv, which spells out lost and Viking when read backwards.

771
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:44,000
The Shaft and Amulet are combined to form the Staff of Prehistoria, which is the theme

772
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:51,000
of Uldaman, you know, basically being little dinosaurs and shit and going in with lost

773
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Vikings.

774
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:59,000
In World of Warcraft Cataclysm, they were prominently in an alliance faction quest in

775
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
the Badlands and Eastern Kingdoms.

776
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:09,000
In Warlords of Draenor, Olaf can appear as a random daily quest NPC if you have the Frost

777
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Wolf Tavern or Lunar Fall in as a building in your garrison.

778
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:22,000
In Warcraft 3, the Frozen Thorns monolith scenario, the Dark Troll commando heroes are

779
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:27,000
named for the lost Vikings, Eric Swift by Lug the Fierce and Olaf the Stout.

780
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:35,000
And a unit in Starcraft 2 is called the Viking and a picture of their unit on the website

781
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
is subtitled The Lost Vikings.

782
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:43,000
You can also select Viking outfit that makes the Viking pilot.

783
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
This is in Starcraft 2 again.

784
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Merrick mentioned the three lost Vikings getting lost and he tried to contact them.

785
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:58,000
And the coordinates are set for Norse by Norse West.

786
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:03,000
There's also an arcade console in the Cantina Battleship Hyperion in Starcraft 2 called

787
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:07,000
The Lost Viking, which is a playable minigame.

788
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:14,000
They returned as playable characters in Heroes of the Storm and they are unique in that you

789
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:20,000
can either play them as a single unit or you can control them individually by giving them

790
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
commands separately.

791
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
So I remember that.

792
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Yeah.

793
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Yeah.

794
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:32,000
But going back to the lost Vikings, it got some pretty favorable ratings for SNES and

795
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Genesis from all game.

796
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Well, actually, the Genesis version got slightly lower ratings than the SNES version at four

797
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:43,000
stars and Genesis got three and a half from all game.

798
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
EGM gave it a six point eight out of ten.

799
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
But what do they know?

800
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:52,000
And video games and computer entertainment gave them a nine out of ten.

801
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,000
But I think the big thing that they got scored down for from EGM was the fact that they were

802
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:01,000
looking at the Genesis version and that it doesn't have as good music as the SNES version.

803
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
All right.

804
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:07,000
And I'm sorry, just an observation from our chatter or a rumor, if you want to believe

805
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,000
it, dark to see in chat says, I just saw a story apparently that the Blizzard arcade

806
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,000
collection is getting additional games, which includes Lost Vikings two.

807
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
So that's great.

808
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,000
If true, we love to see those collections that get games added to them after the fact,

809
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:25,000
especially especially if it's not an additional cost, if it's additional costs, then well,

810
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
maybe it'll still be worth it because this was a fun game.

811
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Well, there's also another theory out there that the game may have been influenced by

812
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:44,000
an Amiga game that was released by Cocktail Vision and later Sierra Online called Goblins

813
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
with lots of eyes.

814
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,000
That was a kind of a similar game in theory.

815
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
And but that's it.

816
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
All right.

817
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,000
It's it's a pretty interactive, fun game.

818
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Supergamer gave it a ninety two percent rating when it was released.

819
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
So there you go.

820
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
All right.

821
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Vikings.

822
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,000
There it is, your classic game of the week.

823
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
The Lost Vikings.

824
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:19,000
May they drink and definitely one that has continued to have influence over Blizzard

825
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:24,000
games to this day, which our soccer is kind of naming all those subsequent appearances,

826
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:29,000
even if for whatever reason, Blizzard never really did a Lost Vikings follow up, probably

827
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
because they just lost Vikings, too.

828
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Well, I mean, sorry, I should say like all these years later, like a modern Vikings,

829
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
if you will.

830
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:41,000
But but maybe they just can really figure out where does that fit in today's game plays

831
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
like you look at the types of games Blizzard makes.

832
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:48,000
They like to make ongoing games that are, you know, trying.

833
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
I guess that's true.

834
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
So I don't have room for the puzzle games out there.

835
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe so.

836
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
So it's just interesting.

837
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Blizzard hasn't revisited that, but maybe that's part of you know, they have that 30th

838
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,000
anniversary collection was a way for them to celebrate that again.

839
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
And then by throwing Lost Vikings two potentially into that as well is pretty, pretty big as

840
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
well.

841
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
So.

842
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
All right.

843
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,000
But I remember playing that on PC back when it first came out.

844
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:18,000
So I do I do recommend checking that one out because it's nothing like Warcraft or Diablo

845
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
or anything else that Blizzard did.

846
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
And again, they weren't even called Blizzard back at the time.

847
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:26,000
There was Silicon and Synapse or whatever they were.

848
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
But it was a very different type of game for them.

849
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
But it's still neat.

850
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:34,000
And yeah, you kind of see see these characters that showed up in like you said, Heroes of

851
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
the Storm was a big, big deal for that and so forth.

852
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
So absolutely.

853
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
All right.

854
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Well, let's I just I just remember when I when I was playing Wow and went into Cataclysm

855
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
and I was doing all of my farming.

856
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:51,000
And I think I messaged you, Rob, there's Vikings here.

857
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
And I don't even remember making the connection at first.

858
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:59,000
And then I was like, oh, yeah, because that was their game way back in the day.

859
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Yeah, that was that was fun.

860
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Yep.

861
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
All right.

862
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Let's let's check out some other news going on in the gaming industry, but let's do it

863
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,000
kind of quick in a segment called Rapid Fire News.

864
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Loki.

865
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Yeah.

866
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Yeah, so we've got some pretty cool announcements, including that now your smart device owned

867
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,000
by Amazon, like I said, the name is not to trigger that stuff.

868
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:27,000
You can now control your Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S.

869
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,000
You have to spell it like when you're doing A L E X A.

870
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,000
You have to do it like like when you're talking about things in front of the kids, you don't

871
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
want them to know about.

872
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
You have to spell it.

873
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Although that is Alex.

874
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
That is Google's device, though.

875
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
That's my Google's device.

876
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
OK, it's it's Amazon, Alex.

877
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:51,000
And it can now control games, but you can actually tell it to download certain games

878
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:56,000
from Game Pass and it will allow the app to do that for you.

879
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Of course, you have to link your Microsoft account to it.

880
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
But if you do that, then you can do it.

881
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:06,000
So that's a neat little thing that you can do that I will probably never use.

882
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:14,000
And then to continue on with the the myriad of cameos that we've had for the season of

883
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Fortnite, now we have Aloy from Horizon Zero Dawn making an appearance.

884
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Aloy.

885
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Fortnite.

886
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
That's fine.

887
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Aloy, whatever.

888
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,000
And that's actually that started this week.

889
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,000
So interesting to see who else they're going to add to this.

890
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:38,000
It's becoming quite the Smash Brothers of of, you know, arena fighting games.

891
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,000
I love the 2020s, the game.

892
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Yes, exactly.

893
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
And then some really.

894
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
I mean, things like Tron and stuff in there.

895
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,000
It's I love the 2020s and then some.

896
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
It's it's a pop culture orgy is what it is.

897
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Let's just call Fortnite what it is.

898
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
All right.

899
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:57,000
It's like we'll take money from whomever you want your character in here.

900
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
You got the money.

901
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Yeah, we'll throw it in there.

902
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
It's pop culture.

903
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Gun orgy.

904
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
The game.

905
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Yeah.

906
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
All right.

907
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Mr. Peanut.

908
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Yeah.

909
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
We're going to bring Mr. Peanut in here.

910
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
All right.

911
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
I like to do that.

912
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
I'd like to see Steakhams.

913
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Steakhams.

914
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Steakhams versus Mr. Peanut.

915
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Dropping woke knowledge on the various matches.

916
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
All right.

917
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Dark Soccer.

918
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
What do you have for us?

919
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Oh, I still hope that I'll be able to play this through Stadia.

920
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
But Mass Effect Legendary Edition is going to have something beautiful.

921
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:38,000
It's going to have photo mode so I can take pictures of my space bird husband.

922
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Garris.

923
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,000
What kind of what kind of pictures of Garris?

924
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Tasteful ones.

925
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Get your mind out of the gutter.

926
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,000
I was thinking black and white photography.

927
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Well, OK, I'll take sexy poses anyway.

928
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
So, yeah.

929
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Garris photo mode in Mass Effect Legendary Edition also.

930
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:05,000
And there's been a lot of talk of this in some of the chats I've been in, but Resident

931
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Evil is joining Dead by Daylight in June for their next big release.

932
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
We don't know who it is.

933
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

934
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:19,000
This means Silent Hill and Dead by Daylight.

935
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
I'm sorry, Silent Hill and Resident Evil in the same game.

936
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Yeah.

937
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Well, I mean, the game is just this huge multiversal crossover anyway.

938
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
I love that analogy you gave last week.

939
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,000
It's it's the multiverse of 80s and 90s horror movies.

940
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
It really is.

941
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Well, at any rate, all that you see in the teaser is just, you know, someone on the hook.

942
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:45,000
You see feet and you see an umbrella badge falling.

943
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Now, we have had all kinds of speculation about this in our various chats, and I still

944
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:55,000
think it would be absolutely hilarious if the killer is Albert Wesker.

945
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:02,000
And that you have to play Barry and Rebecca.

946
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:10,000
I mean, we got to we got to survivors from the Stranger Things.

947
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
So why not?

948
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
So, so quickly, who do you want it to be?

949
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Who will it be?

950
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Because I mean, for me, the the who will it be?

951
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,000
I actually think it will be Wesker.

952
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,000
It would be cool if it was Wesker.

953
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,000
My, my, my want I want Lady Demi.

954
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
I want her domestic.

955
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I'm sorry, I can't say it, but I want her because honestly, you know, and I know, yes,

956
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,000
I want the whole fanboy explosion that would happen with that.

957
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
But I think she would be a great killer.

958
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
I really do.

959
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000
And we need a fucking vampire in that game.

960
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,000
I think it but but of course, you think of Resident Evil, you think more of zombies.

961
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,000
And so I kind of think that's why it's going to be or it's an act Efton Chad is saying

962
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Nemesis and it makes a lot of sense to but I think Wesker Wesker.

963
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
I feel like it's going to be a human of some sort human.

964
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:07,000
We've already got the big lumbering hulking, you know, characters true.

965
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
We have.

966
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:16,000
I mean, I would put a trapper in that category a little bit and

967
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
the huntress definitely isn't that huge lumbering category so quickly.

968
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Who do you who do you want it to be?

969
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Who do you think it will be?

970
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:30,000
I would love to have a Code Veronica pack where the killer is like Alexia Ashford and

971
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,000
you have Steve and Claire.

972
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:40,000
But I would really like, of course, Chris, Jill and and the Mr.

973
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
X or Tyrant or whichever one it was.

974
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Yeah, it might be that.

975
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I think likely because I think the next Resident Evil game is supposed to be centered around

976
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Chris and Jill again.

977
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:58,000
It might be unlikely that we're going to get the bigger names as characters in Dead by Daylight.

978
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Then again, it could happen.

979
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if we end up with something like like Barry and Rebecca

980
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:14,000
and maybe some other, you know, big hulking lumbering beast.

981
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:20,000
I would love, though, for the like my wet dream would be to have Wesker be the killer.

982
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
All right.

983
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
All right.

984
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Rapid fire news.

985
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,000
We should probably move on.

986
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Thank you for indulging a little bit there.

987
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
But the news of that pack is pretty exciting.

988
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
I have to go retrieve a cat.

989
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Give me.

990
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Yeah, we can see Miss Midna walking around there on the floor.

991
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
It's kind of cracking me up.

992
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
All right.

993
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Anyhow, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates, starting with Loki.

994
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
I love it.

995
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I love what Jamie thinks.

996
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
She's turned off her camera and she has.

997
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Oh, wait.

998
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Maybe she actually meant to leave it on because she she's picking up a minute.

999
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Anyway, let's check out release dates.

1000
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Loki.

1001
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:56,000
So we have MLB The Show 21 coming on PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox Series X.

1002
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:02,000

01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:10,000
We have MotoGP 21 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox Series X and Stadia.

1004
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:20,000

1005
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:28,000

1009
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
The near remake Loki.

1010
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Hey, that's the title. I'm going to say the title.

1011
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
OK, fine, fine.

1012
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
That's how we're going to refer to it every time.

1013
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Death end request.

1014
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Just no, just no.

1015
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:09,000
The day this show inevitably ends, the final episode number will be pie and you have to read it in full.

1016
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
All right.

1017
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
That'll be the show.

1018
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
OK.

1019
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
And that's it for the week.

1020
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
All right.

1021
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Let's look at Japan and check out the releases over there.

1022
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:24,000
So on the switch this week, coming out on the 22nd.

1023
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:28,000

1028
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,000
I think we're as retro fans are really looking forward to that.

1029
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
That is also out in Japan this week.

1030
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:52,000
And we get an Atelier mysterious trilogy deluxe pack coming out this week in all sorts of different configurations there.

1031
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:57,000
And I believe the games are also releasing individually if you want to buy them that way.

1032
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Japan also gets Fight of Animals comes out this week.

1033
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Wait.

1034
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
So is this a game where, like, animals fight?

1035
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Like, what?

1036
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Oh, my God, I think it is what it would imply.

1037
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
We already have brutal this.

1038
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
No, y'all.

1039
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Oh, my God.

1040
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,000
You have to see this game.

1041
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
The screenshots are cracking me up.

1042
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,000
It's like a fighting game.

1043
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:26,000
It looks like Street Fighter and it's like Power Hook Dog versus Mighty Fox.

1044
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
And this is crazy.

1045
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Hold on.

1046
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Hold on.

1047
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,000
I got to I don't know if I have a scene set up for Twitch to show this.

1048
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Do I?

1049
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Hold on.

1050
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
I'm sorry, guys.

1051
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
We'll do it live.

1052
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
We will.

1053
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
What's this game called again?

1054
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Fight of Animals, Nintendo Switch.

1055
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Oh, it is in the US as well.

1056
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Yeah, it's already out.

1057
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Oh, wow.

1058
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,000
So it's getting its own release over in Japan.

1059
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Let me see if this works.

1060
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Does this work?

1061
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Oh, I have no idea what I just did there.

1062
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Well, I don't.

1063
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
OK, yeah, that's not going to work.

1064
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Sorry, guys.

1065
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
So you'll just have to know I want this to work.

1066
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Hold on.

1067
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Well, then let me let Midna out of the room.

1068
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
OK, there we go.

1069
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
I got it.

1070
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:17,000
OK, so I got it to show on the screen there so you can actually see how ridiculous this

1071
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:21,000
game looks with like the Hulk up dogs and all this stuff.

1072
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Like what is going on there?

1073
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
That looks ridiculous.

1074
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,000
I don't see the horn version in the bottom.

1075
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,000
They have slender cat long man.

1076
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I bet I better get that off the screen then if there's like Rule 37 showing up in there.

1077
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Sorry.

1078
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Unintentional.

1079
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Anyway, so that's that's this game.

1080
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
And it looks insane.

1081
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
I love it.

1082
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,000
So that is coming out of Japan this week, which apparently already existed in the US

1083
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
and I didn't even know.

1084
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
So the more you know.

1085
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Also coming out this week in Japan, Yo-kai Watch one and Yo-kai Watch four go into the

1086
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:56,000
best hits because I think they're really trying to unload those and then typing quest.

1087
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:00,000
No word if Mavis Beacon is a ancient sage in that game.

1088
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
But that game is out on the switch this week as well.

1089
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:08,000
PlayStation 5 gets Werewolf the Apocalypse Earthblood is out this week in Japan.

1090
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:12,000
And the PlayStation 4 I imagine has a lot of those same titles as the switch.

1091
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Oh, NieR Replicant is also getting its Japanese release this week as well as that Atleur trilogy.

1092
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Werewolf the Apocalypse.

1093
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:25,000
There's an Assassin's Creed double pack this week with Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag and Rogue.

1094
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:31,000
That is out this week and Overcooked all you can eat Japanese edition is out this week.

1095
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
All right, that's a lot of releases.

1096
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
How about Europe?

1097
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:39,000
In Europe, we have a few things going on.

1098
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,000
We have Judgment on the 21st.

1099
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:47,000
On the 22nd, we have World War One Verdun Western Front.

1100
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,000
We have World War One Tannenberg Eastern Front as well.

1101
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
We have Taxi Chaos on the 22nd.

1102
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Also, MotoGP 21.

1103
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Pure Pool on the 23rd.

1104
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Chess Ultra on the 23rd.

1105
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Actually, the rest of these I have are on the 23rd.

1106
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
We also have Zombieland Double Tap Road Trip.

1107
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Urban Flow, NieR Replicant.

1108
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
And that's it.

1109
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Oh my god, the trailer for this game is fucking hilarious.

1110
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
I know, I just saw Tigerclaw link that.

1111
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
So now I'm like, way to stop the show, Tigerclaw.

1112
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Because now I'm not going to be able to sit here and not look at this trailer.

1113
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
It's been out for a year already.

1114
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Fight of Animals.

1115
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Well, you know what, Jamie? We don't have time to play every single game.

1116
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:33,000
So sometimes they fly under the radar, don't they?

1117
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
All right, let me see how this goes.

1118
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I'm going to just pray this works and doing it live.

1119
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Okay, it's very loud. Sorry, I'm going to turn it down the audio just a bit.

1120
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Sorry, I don't know who puts static in the beginning of their trailer, but they do.

1121
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
All right.

1122
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
So we can see there.

1123
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
This is...

1124
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:05,000
I feel like I'm looking at, like, the next step before furry porn.

1125
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Is what I'm really looking at.

1126
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
No insults.

1127
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
This is so out there.

1128
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
No insult intended to any furries.

1129
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
I'm just saying, I've seen this before on dark parts of the internet.

1130
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Oh my god, they really do have Longcat as a character, except they called it something else.

1131
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Slendercat.

1132
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Yeah.

1133
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
You know what?

1134
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,000
I don't mind that something like this stops our show.

1135
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
It's great. All right.

1136
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,000
All right, everybody say thank you, Tiger Claw, for stopping the show.

1137
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Thank you, Tiger Claw.

1138
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
All right.

1139
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Moving on.

1140
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Let's see, we did all the Europe releases as well, right?

1141
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Yeah.

1142
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
And then we can get back into some news.

1143
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
And I think we start with some news on Loki's favorite game.

1144
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Yes.

1145
01:42:54,000 --> 01:43:00,000
So unfortunately this week they did announce a delay for the newest update for Minecraft Java Edition.

1146
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Actually, all editions, I guess.

1147
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Caves and Cliffs.

1148
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
So some of the changes that are going to happen now.

1149
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Originally it was supposed to come out this summer, but now they're splitting it into two parts.

1150
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:16,000
So they have the initial update, which is still scheduled for this summer,

1151
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:21,000
which is going to add some new building blocks and I believe the new mobs that are in the game.

1152
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,000
So the axolotl, the glow squid, the goats.

1153
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:31,000
And I'm not sure if they're adding the new mobs in there as well,

1154
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:36,000
but at least the passive stuff that they've had in the betas right now.

1155
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
So that's all supposed to come out this summer.

1156
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Then the brand new cave generation that's been happening,

1157
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:46,000
the massive update that's completely redesigning that.

1158
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
That's going to be a holiday release.

1159
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
They're going to do an update for that as well.

1160
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Tell me more about that.

1161
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
How do you redesign the way caves are generated?

1162
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,000
It's completely nuts.

1163
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:01,000
So right now everything's kind of spaghetti that's just all over the place.

1164
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
These kind of spaghetti things.

1165
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:06,000
So the brand new caves are very varied.

1166
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
So they have different biomes in there.

1167
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,000
For example, they have lush caves with like tons of greenery and moss and stuff.

1168
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:17,000
They've got dripstone caves with stalactites and stalagmites in there.

1169
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Giant caves filled with water.

1170
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,000
And then all of these different cave types are also having different generations.

1171
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:27,000
So there's some that are these massive caverns that are just absolutely enormous.

1172
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Some with different varying water levels that are in there.

1173
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
So you can have different underwater caves.

1174
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,000
There's some caves there they call like Swiss cheese caves and stuff.

1175
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
So it's all this different cave generation.

1176
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:44,000
And then on top of that, this is probably why they're delaying everything.

1177
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,000
They're increasing the build height in the game.

1178
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
So they're increasing, I think, by 64 blocks.

1179
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:55,000
And they're also decreasing the bottom down to negative 64 instead of zero.

1180
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:00,000
So below that, you've got like the well, they were calling it the deep dark at one point.

1181
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:05,000
I can't remember. That's what they're still calling now, but they've got different stone types in there.

1182
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:11,000
And then they're supposed to have, gosh, I'm trying to remember what the big new monster is.

1183
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:15,000
I think it's like a it's not a guardian, but I don't remember.

1184
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,000
But it's some monster that's basically blind.

1185
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:23,000
You can only hear sound, but it's supposed to be like this big OP thing.

1186
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Interesting.

1187
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,000
So that's that's coming later, the different build height stuff.

1188
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
So right now it's going to be new block types.

1189
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,000
They may still have like the geodes and stuff that are in there right now.

1190
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:37,000
So basically what we have in the betas, so the axolotls, which are pretty cool.

1191
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:45,000
The glow squid, which is kind of useless, but it's the item you can make stuff glow and the goats, which are pretty neat.

1192
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
And they ram stuff.

1193
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Those are all going to be coming initially in the summer.

1194
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,000
And then the new cave generation, which is going to require them to be able to.

1195
01:45:55,000 --> 01:46:02,000
They really have to get the game performance to run with the extra chunks, basically, that has to load.

1196
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,000
And so that's going to be coming the holidays, they say.

1197
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
And they just needed more time.

1198
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,000
They didn't want to push crunch and all that stuff.

1199
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
So I appreciate them doing that.

1200
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
I can wait.

1201
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:18,000
But yeah, it's still pretty exciting.

1202
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
All the changes they have coming.

1203
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:26,000
And there's still a lot of stuff that's not in the betas yet, like archaeology and stuff that they haven't really shown us yet.

1204
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,000
But copper and everything is going to be coming.

1205
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:33,000
That all sounds like a reason to really visit Minecraft again, if you haven't in a while, like me.

1206
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Because, yeah, you're right, the cave layout, it's kind of like it gets old because it all looks the same.

1207
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
You know, basically interesting.

1208
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Yeah, basically, like they've said, it's like you've seen one Minecraft cave, you've seen them all.

1209
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Well, not anymore.

1210
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
So with this, it's going to be very, very.

1211
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Now, however, though, like, say, for example, you can't wait for a holiday, they will have a data pack that's available.

1212
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
So data packs are kind of like mods for Java edition.

1213
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,000
It tweaks different things in the game.

1214
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:10,000
So they have a data pack available that you'll be able to download in the meantime to add that cave generation in there.

1215
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Now, granted, it may not be as smooth.

1216
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
It may still be a little bit beta.

1217
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:21,000
But it is something you can check out, even though it's not fully operational yet.

1218
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:27,000
So that's something that they're adding in the meantime that you'll be able to check out if you want to start with that.

1219
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,000
OK.

1220
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,000
But, yeah, it's really cool.

1221
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
You got to check out all the videos for it and stuff.

1222
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,000
All right.

1223
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Well, another thing I think some of us have our eye on and want to check out is Phantasy Star Online 2 New Genesis.

1224
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:47,000
So after many, many years, you know, Phantasy Star Online 2 finally came out in the US, thanks to a relationship between Sega and Microsoft or Xbox.

1225
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
And we finally got that.

1226
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:56,000
In fact, I was very happy to see it, but it was almost overwhelming because, like, all the content there was to catch up on was, like, all there.

1227
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,000
And it was like, I have no idea, like, what I'm doing.

1228
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
I just feel like over overwhelmed.

1229
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:09,000
But the cool thing is, is that it's done successful enough, not just here, but in Japan, that they're going to launch this whole new Genesis.

1230
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,000
So it's a way to in a way to start over.

1231
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:16,000
And my understanding is that this is something that's going to run concurrently with Phantasy Star Online 2.

1232
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:22,000
And this is like like I don't want to make it sound like, oh, they're erasing all PSO2 and starting with this.

1233
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,000
It's not really the way it's working, from what I understand.

1234
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:31,000
This is something that kind of exists as like a separate thing, but you can use like some of the stuff you've earned in Phantasy Star Online 2 with it.

1235
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Well, if you want to check out really what it's all about, some early beta stuff is out there.

1236
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:44,000
I know some people have been playing it from like a closed alpha, but more people are going to be able to get into a global beta on May 15th.

1237
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:50,000
And if you want to sign up for this beta, you can get in on that with the Xbox Insider Hub app.

1238
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:57,000
So if you have an Xbox One or an Xbox Series XS, whatever, you can get an app called the Xbox Insider Hub.

1239
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:04,000
And you'll be able to apply for the beta starting on April 22nd, starting at 2 a.m. JST.

1240
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
So 2 a.m. in Japan.

1241
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:10,000
But I imagine you'll have a little bit you'll have a little bit of time to get in on this.

1242
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:14,000
And you can see just how gorgeous this game really looks in its newer form.

1243
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
So that's going to be pretty cool.

1244
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:20,000
And I'm sure a lot of people will be streaming around that May 15th date.

1245
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,000
I know if I can get in, I will to see if I can hopefully make sense of it all again.

1246
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,000
I really should have spent more time with Phantasy Star Online 2.

1247
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:32,000
But like I said, I was almost overwhelmed. I would sign in and I'm like, I feel like there's so many things to do.

1248
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
I don't know how to do them all.

1249
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:38,000
So hopefully the New Genesis does a pretty good job of handholding and making suggestions and things like that.

1250
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:49,000
So and the best part of all, when New Genesis actually releases in 2021, the U.S. and Japan will get it at the same time.

1251
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:54,000
We don't have to wait for, what, 10 years or however long it took this last time.

1252
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
So that's great. All right.

1253
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Pod Culture making a sci fi joke saying, when you bring Genesis to a new world, that never ends well.

1254
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:08,000
I've watched Star Trek. Pod Culture also says, I kind of want a version of the Dreamcast PSO to play.

1255
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,000
So that does exist, actually. You can't.

1256
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Well, I'm sure there's a way to play it on a Dreamcast, but I only know how to do Blue Burst on the PC,

1257
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:21,000
which was essentially the Dreamcast PSO or GameCube, Xbox, wherever you played it.

1258
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
And there are private servers.

1259
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:28,000
And of course, in the moment, I can't remember the name of the big one, but if you Google it, you'll find it.

1260
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:33,000
I realize me talking about private servers is a questionable thing.

1261
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:38,000
But my understanding is Sega was pretty like, you know, they understood.

1262
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,000
They're not going to run this anymore.

1263
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,000
They let you have your old character.

1264
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Yeah, they let you copy your old character to basically use on private servers.

1265
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:52,000
So I think it was like, E.P. I remember the name of it, but I just remember Delvin and I streamed it like a year or two ago.

1266
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,000
We were playing this and I was talking about it on the show a little bit.

1267
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:03,000
So the original PSO does still exist out there if you're willing to do private servers, which I'm really stupid when it comes to that stuff.

1268
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:06,000
And I figured it out. So I'm sure you can as well.

1269
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,000
I believe in you. All right, moving on.

1270
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,000
I just found something out, by the way.

1271
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,000
What's that?

1272
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Taiko no Tatsujin is on the App Store and Apple Arcade.

1273
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Oh, yeah, I thought I heard that it was an Apple Arcade thing.

1274
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Yeah, yeah.

1275
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Some version of it.

1276
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,000
I'm going to play it.

1277
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Anyway.

1278
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Anyway, yes.

1279
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:27,000
So Christmas presents already.

1280
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,000
It's April, Jamie.

1281
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,000
It's April.

1282
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:36,000
I know. Well, that doesn't start stop Hallmark from opening up their their preorders.

1283
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
You can start on July 10th to order.

1284
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Some others are going to come out on October 2nd.

1285
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
But what am I talking about?

1286
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:45,000
But ornaments, however, these are special ornaments.

1287
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
They are video game ornaments.

1288
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:50,000
They had some last year as well.

1289
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,000
I picked up a couple of them.

1290
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
There is going to be a SNES.

1291
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,000
There was a NES last year.

1292
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,000
I think I picked up the NES.

1293
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:01,000
So this year there's going to be a SNES with Super Mario World.

1294
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:05,000
And other ornaments are going to include a caped Mario.

1295
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
There's a personalized Super Mario.

1296
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
There's an Enderman from Minecraft.

1297
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Pixel Link.

1298
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Pixel Zelda.

1299
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Both the Legend of Zelda.

1300
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Sonic and Tails from Sonic the Hedgehog.

1301
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Knuckles, which I need the Knuckles.

1302
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
King Mickey from Kingdom Hearts.

1303
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Sub-Zero from Mortal Kombat.

1304
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Charizard from Pokemon.

1305
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Donkey Kong Mario Kart version.

1306
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
And Crackshot from Fortnite.

1307
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Wow.

1308
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:30,000
I kind of need the Enderman.

1309
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:33,000
That's quite the video game smorgasbord of characters too.

1310
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,000
You have some real classics there.

1311
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,000
He's got a present.

1312
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Mixed in with some contemporaries.

1313
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,000
He's got a present.

1314
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Amethyst Rose Witch in chat says,

1315
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Ooh, I need ornaments.

1316
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,000
It's April.

1317
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
No, I know.

1318
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Everybody has to start planning.

1319
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Hi.

1320
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Everybody has to start planning now.

1321
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:51,000
It's one of my bestest buddies.

1322
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Oh, yay.

1323
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Thank you for joining us.

1324
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Sj100Matt says,

1325
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,000
True story.

1326
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Hallmark starts shooting their Christmas movies mid-spring.

1327
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Well, that I get because it takes a while for them to edit and do all that stuff.

1328
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:06,000
But yeah, isn't it weird to already be thinking about the holidays in some context?

1329
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
It's like this year has barely started.

1330
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:14,000
This was supposed to be the year we celebrate that COVID is over and we haven't gotten there yet.

1331
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,000
All right.

1332
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says,

1333
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,000
We did have our first Christmas last December.

1334
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:24,000
I got us a tree and a Triforce star topper, so I might have to pick up one of these.

1335
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Yeah, we have some video game ornaments too, but they're kind of like unofficial, unlicensed.

1336
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:35,000
So they just they're very generic game controllers that look like Super Nintendo controllers,

1337
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
although they're not really like that type of thing.

1338
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,000
So it's enough to get the message across.

1339
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,000
That's for sure.

1340
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
All right, let's move on.

1341
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Loki.

1342
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Yeah, so lots of exciting stuff happening with the Oculus Quest 2,

1343
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:59,000
so there's yet another update for it now that they're going to be pushing out a new feature called Air Link,

1344
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:05,000
which allows you to stream content from your gaming PC to the Oculus Quest 2.

1345
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:15,000
And apparently it's powerful enough to run lots of games, but I'm not sure if that applies to everything.

1346
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:21,000
The other thing that they're also doing as well is adding 120 hertz support,

1347
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:25,000
which is going to make games look even better with higher frame rates.

1348
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Oh, yeah.

1349
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
But it's still exciting.

1350
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:32,000
But I've got a rough desk, so I guess that doesn't really apply to me, though.

1351
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,000
I can already play PC games.

1352
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:39,000
And correct me if I'm wrong, but Quest 2, it's big kind of like selling point is that it's not really wired.

1353
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Like it's just a headset you put on.

1354
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:46,000
And so, OK, I think I used one of these at an expo for my day job.

1355
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:50,000
They were showing off like a training in virtual reality type of thing.

1356
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
And I was I was like, OK, wow, cool.

1357
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,000
There's no cords.

1358
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:58,000
And previously, though, they did have a link that I think you get a cable that you could actually hook it up to a PC,

1359
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,000
the actual run like different PC VR games.

1360
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:04,000
But this is now actually a little bit different because it's doing it wirelessly.

1361
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,000
So that's pretty, pretty impressive.

1362
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Bummer, it's tied to my Facebook account.

1363
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
So I'm like, that's strike one.

1364
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Yeah, it says. But it says in order to do that, you have to have a really says you can play high end PC titles using the feature over Wi-Fi.

1365
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:24,000
It's available in their experimental mode, which is before the offer.

1366
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:28,000
You know, while they're polishing it up, obviously, they're kind of beta test mode.

1367
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:32,000
But. Yeah, interesting.

1368
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Well, that kind of ties in a little bit to this last story I have to talk about tonight,

1369
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:41,000
because I'm sure this is the VR game everyone would like to play on it if they could.

1370
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:46,000
And that would be Half-Life, Alex, although I'm not sure because the custom the controls,

1371
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,000
I don't know enough about the nuances of the different VR headsets.

1372
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:55,000
I imagine it may not be that easy because like it doesn't Half-Life, Alex, like you actually do things with your fingers and all that.

1373
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:58,000
And I don't know if the controls on the quest have that.

1374
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,000
But anyway, I digress.

1375
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Yeah, because they have I play with the rift and the controllers are the same.

1376
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:12,000
OK, OK. Well, then, well, actually, what the story is about, it's not even about playing Half-Life, Alex and VR at all.

1377
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:20,000
This is kind of what we knew was coming with that when this was announced that it was going to be a VR exclusive type of title.

1378
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,000
It's just kind of one of those. Well, how long until modders fix that?

1379
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Here we are here. That is the story I'm bringing to us tonight.

1380
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Modders are making progress on fixing that.

1381
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:34,000
But is it fixing it or is it breaking it?

1382
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:44,000
That is the question you have to answer, because certainly a lot of folks feel that VR is kind of integral to how this game performs and how it plays.

1383
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:49,000
But it's also still going to continue to be a hurdle for some people to be able to play.

1384
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:54,000
So that is a decision you all have to make for your own.

1385
01:56:54,000 --> 01:57:02,000
But the modding community has made it so that Half-Life, Alex, is something that is now on its way to being playable off of VR.

1386
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:10,000
A modder from Argentina has made a lot of progress posting a video on YouTube this week highlighting the progress of the NoVR mod.

1387
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:19,000
And apparently this one works a little different than some other mods in progress because the camera doesn't shift around with every little movement.

1388
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Alex's hands are controlled with a mouse and keyboard.

1389
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:31,000
In fact, the goal of this mod are named Somnist, if I'm saying that right, trying to make the mod as close to Half-Life 2 as possible.

1390
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:36,000
And so the way this looks now in this mod, this basically just looks like a source first person shooter.

1391
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Which is exactly what the developers did not want, I'm sure.

1392
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:48,000
But again, hackers gonna hack, modders gonna mod, and they're gonna do it the way they wanted it to do.

1393
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Whether developers wanted that to happen or not is just what it is.

1394
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Let's see, so Somnist in a statement said,

1395
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:03,000
I played the game in VR and I think the game is a masterpiece. Valve did an awesome job.

1396
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:11,000
But then continuing along saying, in the current situation of my country, Argentina, it's almost impossible to get a VR headset.

1397
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Even if you try to get the cheapest one.

1398
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:21,000
So I'm developing this mod because of that and because I think that it's a nice challenge to get working Half-Life, Alex, without VR.

1399
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:26,000
So in this mod, only two of the eleven chapters in the game can be played with the mod.

1400
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:34,000
But Somnist has some other modders working together to try to get the rest of this game playable in non-VR ASAP.

1401
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
So, kind of interesting.

1402
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:48,000
But you know, I'd like to play the game at some point, but I just don't know when I'm gonna pick up finally a PC-based headset.

1403
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:52,000
I'm kind of more just waiting for the PlayStation 5's VR headset at this point.

1404
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:55,000
But I suppose it'll just depend on what the games look like.

1405
01:58:55,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Because again, the systems are only as good as the games that are on it and that whole good stuff, right?

1406
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Alright.

1407
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:08,000
SSJ100Matt in chat says, you tell them you can't play it without VR.

1408
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Hackers and modders will laugh at you and prove you wrong.

1409
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:14,000
That's exactly what's happening here. Exactly it.

1410
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Alright, let's get into the listener round table.

1411
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:21,000
So you guys can ask us some questions if you like in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

1412
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:25,000
If you have any questions or stories you'd like to bring to our attention that we haven't addressed yet on the show.

1413
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:28,000
This is the part of the show where we also visit the mailbag.

1414
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,000
I'm not sure I remember seeing anything in there, but I'll check in with Jamie.

1415
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:32,000
It is empty.

1416
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Alright.

1417
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,000
It is crickets and nothing.

1418
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:38,000
So send us emails. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1419
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:42,000
When we don't have emails, we usually like to do a quick drag race update.

1420
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
DarkSakura, who should win?

1421
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,000
I'm behind.

1422
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Oh, nevermind then.

1423
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Well, no, I know who the final four are.

1424
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Or the final three.

1425
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
There isn't three, it's four.

1426
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:55,000
It is four? Okay, I know who the final four are.

1427
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Who should win, who will win?

1428
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
I want Gottmik.

1429
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:02,000
I think it's either going to be between Gottmik or Simone.

1430
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Yeah, that's kind of where my head is at either.

1431
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Either can win, either will win, and either way it's okay.

1432
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
It's exactly where my head is at.

1433
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:15,000
I think it's really become a two person race at this point between those two.

1434
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,000
But we'll see.

1435
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Rosé's been gaining a lot in the past couple weeks.

1436
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:22,000
A lot of people's favor and so forth and all that stuff.

1437
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,000
And even Candy Muse.

1438
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:27,000
There's a lot of people that really disliked her in the beginning that are kind of warming up to her a lot now.

1439
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
So, who knows? Who knows?

1440
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:34,000
Candy is actually not the terrible person I thought she was at the beginning of this series.

1441
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Well, they usually aren't.

1442
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
It's editing and all that stuff, you know.

1443
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
So, it's good.

1444
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Anyway, we have some stuff from chat.

1445
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
So, let me go to PixelPakas in chat.

1446
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Hello, who says, did you folks hear the news that there is a new PlayStation 2 exploit that enables PlayStation 2s to become region free without needing to use mod chips or swap discs and tricks anymore?

1447
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:04,000
So, you can play any region PlayStation 2 game or PlayStation 1 game on a system just like discs of your system's region.

1448
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:11,000
I did not hear that, but that is great news because I still have a library of Japanese PS2 games sitting over there.

1449
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:15,000
I have several of the older BeatMania 2DX titles.

1450
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
I think I had fourth, fifth, and sixth.

1451
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Maybe I bought eighth. I don't know if I bought any after that.

1452
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,000
And then I think I had DDR Extreme Japan as well.

1453
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:28,000
So, I have a small little collection of Japanese games, but I actually had a Japanese PlayStation 2 to play them on.

1454
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:33,000
I was, you guys, I was really into BeatMania 2DX for a while, like really.

1455
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:38,000
So, you know, hence this show's roots and all that stuff.

1456
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:45,000
So, I haven't kept up with it so great over the years, but I'd love to go back and play some of those old songs, man.

1457
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Those older styles had such great music in them.

1458
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Thank you, PixelPakas is going to post a story in our Discord on how to do it if you want to do this.

1459
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:59,000
I'm trying to quickly look at the story here and how this works.

1460
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:06,000
You use a memory card entry point, like Free McBoot and Fortuna.

1461
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:11,000
So, you download this onto a USB stick and then launch on the console itself.

1462
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:16,000
And then it creates a console-specific BIOS on the root of the USB stick.

1463
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:20,000
And then you completely power down the console. That's very interesting.

1464
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Alright, I'll have to look into this in more detail later on, so check that out.

1465
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:29,000
PixelPakas is going to share that on our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1466
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:34,000
And PixelPakas says you do need something initially, but after that you don't need special tools anymore.

1467
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:38,000
I wonder, God, if I still have my BeatMania controller, it's over for you hoes.

1468
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:43,000
I don't know if I still have that though. It's got to be somewhere. It's probably in a box somewhere.

1469
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:48,000
The good old, it's in a box somewhere.

1470
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Alan and I are starting to look at houses.

1471
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:56,000
And so, now we're starting to think about that whole, oh, we're going to have to box this place up. Oh boy.

1472
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:02,000
So, I think we're going to throw half of it away and then box the rest up. That's what I really want to do.

1473
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:11,000
So, but I'll tell you what, y'all are lucky having houses now because the real estate market here is a dumpster fire.

1474
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Yeah, it's pretty crazy.

1475
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:18,000
And it's very frustrating for people who don't own yet like me who really want to get into that.

1476
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:28,000
It's like our options are so limited. It's like a house goes on the market Friday and by Monday they have 50 bids and 30 of them are over the asking price.

1477
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:36,000
It's disgusting. So, Pod Culture in Chat says, oh boy, new OLR studio time. That's the hope.

1478
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:43,000
We were looking at a new house today and trying to kind of imagine what a setup for OLR might look like in there.

1479
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:53,000
I have a feeling that OLR may go back to being in a bedroom sort of thing or a spare room, if you will, than a very large open living space.

1480
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:58,000
This current place that we're in now has like two, it has like a family room and a living room.

1481
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:05,000
So, OLR is set up in the space that would be the family room, basically. A lot of houses we're looking at don't have two rooms like that.

1482
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:14,000
So, we'll see. I don't know. We'll make it work. If worse comes to worse, we keep doing it distance.

1483
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:21,000
But it's not my favorite option, but it would work. We've been able to get away with doing the show as long as we have this way. So, we'll see.

1484
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Let's see. PixelPockets continues. I just posted that article in Discord.

1485
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:35,000
I'm going to write a how-to article as well because it's a bit tricky for those who don't have experience with the PS2 modding scene.

1486
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Yes, thank you, thank you. I would appreciate that for sure. So, yeah.

1487
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:44,000
SG100Matt says, prices have jumped up to 30% from last year. Sure, interest rates are low, but the market stinks.

1488
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:49,000
It sure does. It's very frustrating. But what can you do? It is what it is.

1489
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:54,000
All right. Do we have any last-minute stories? Checking in with Loki. Have any last-minute stories tonight?

1490
02:04:54,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Yeah, I was going to mention that Mario Maker 2 is having its last NINJY speedrun event ever.

1491
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:11,000
That's going to happen on the 27th of April. It's going to run through the 27th of April at 7 p.m. Pacific time.

1492
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:16,000
And then that's it. That's done. The Nintendo said, done with Mario Maker 2.

1493
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:25,000
Yeah, in fact, we kept this game going longer than we intended. It was also supposed to die on March 31st, but, you know, the COVID.

1494
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:28,000
The COVID. We have to kill Mario. Yeah.

1495
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:33,000
I will say, somebody posted, again, talking about our Discord a lot tonight, but hey, come join us.

1496
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Somebody had posted a YouTube of somebody remade World 1-1 from Mario 2 in Mario Maker.

1497
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:56,000
And it's really interesting. Obviously, it's not totally correct because the mechanics between Mario Maker and Mario 2 are very different, but a lot of it looks very good.

1498
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:03,000
It's pretty well done. I thought it was an interesting kind of video. So check that out if you haven't seen that yet.

1499
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Also in our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord. Any other last-minute stories?

1500
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,000
That's it.

1501
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:19,000
All right, then I guess we wrap things up for the night. There's been a lot of shorter news weeks lately, but as June gets closer and closer, it's going to ramp up again.

1502
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Especially, you know, hopefully as things, more and more people get vaccinated and more and more things open up, knock on wood, and a lot of these developers are returning to an office situation when it's safe.

1503
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:33,000
We're going to really start to get a lot more gaming news. It's going to be very interesting.

1504
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:40,000
But that's the point where we start to say good night. So I want to thank everybody for tuning into Orange Lounge Radio tonight and listening to our show.

1505
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Really appreciate that. Whether you were here live on Twitch or if you were listening on the podcast feed via Spotify, iTunes, wherever it is that you check out the show.

1506
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Thank you. Thank you so much. Help us spread the word. Tell a friend or two about the show because word of mouth goes a long way in spreading the news about the show.

1507
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:07,000
We try to be the show where every gamer has a voice and we want more voices here to share opinions and, you know, a polite debate on games and things like that.

1508
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:17,000
So another thing that goes a very, very long way, an auto host on, I almost said VOG Network, on Twitch of VOG Network goes a very, very long way.

1509
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:23,000
So thank you to all of you that have auto hosting for VOG Network set up on your Twitch channel. Really, really appreciate that.

1510
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:31,000
If you feel so inclined and you want to buy some merchandise, vognetwork.com slash shop is the place to do it.

1511
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:36,000
Or on our Twitch page, just scroll down below and you'll see a link there to the store if you're on the web.

1512
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:42,000
If you're on console or something, you can't scroll down and see that. So you have to check on a browser, vognetwork.com slash shop.

1513
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Big thanks again to those of you that do the bits and the subs and all that stuff. Really, really appreciate it.

1514
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Trying to create more content for you to make those subs really worthwhile and we have more to come on that hopefully in the future.

1515
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:02,000
That's all on my mind for now. I think we can go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1516
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:05,000
So Dark Soccer, I'll start with you tonight. What's your final thought?

1517
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:16,000
I am trying to find something other than Parallels to try to run Windows just in case I can't get Mass Effect on Stadia. So we'll see.

1518
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:29,000
My final thought is happy birthday, Jamie. Enjoy it tomorrow. Have the best birthday in light of the world situation and I can't wait to hang out with you soon.

1519
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:37,000
So maybe a couple weeks after you get that second Vax, maybe you and I can go out somewhere and have a nice dinner or something. Celebrate a little bit.

1520
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,000
That sounds like fun.

1521
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:49,000
And what was I going to say? Oh, my other final thought. With all the house stuff, please send some good vibes your way because Alan and I are hoping to find a winner.

1522
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:56,000
We're trying to set up a day where we're going to binge a bunch of them next weekend. So I'm hoping to find a winner with that. So please send happy thoughts our way. Would appreciate it.

1523
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
That'd be good.

1524
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Loki, last but not least, your final thought?

1525
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:16,000
My final thought is I'm hoping to get my first episode of my videos or Minecraft stuff out this week. And then also hoping to stream some more, if not next weekend, probably the following week.

1526
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Awesome. All right. We'll look forward to that. Streaming is a good thing. Hopefully we all have a chance to do some this week. I will see you on Thursday with a bonus stream here at VOG Network.

1527
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Other than that, that is going to do it for us tonight. Thank you guys as always for checking out Orange Lounge Radio. Happy gaming this week. Have fun. There's a lot of releases this week. Hope you guys enjoy something out there.

1528
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:44,000
We will be back in seven days to talk all about it. Stay safe. We'll see you next time. Bye.

1529
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:12,000
At six p.m. Pacific, nine p.m. Eastern. The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.

1530
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,000
See you next week.

1531
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Thanks for watching.
