1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,520
For all the flak that Microsoft caught for sidelining gaming for additional entertainment

2
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,400
options while launching the Xbox One, it's ironic given that Sony is an entertainment

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,000
empire that publishes in every notable medium.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,960
Pair that with a recent drama over their desire for only blockbuster gaming titles and now

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,160
a rumored PlayStation Plus video pass and what were we complaining about before?

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,840
This is the association my brain has drawn.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,960
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to delve more into

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,680
the rumors and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,320
every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,800
Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,040
where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:54,640
It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again on this Sunday evening, April the 25th of

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,200
the 2021 episode number 866 of our show.

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,120
My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined as always by my co-hosts.

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,720
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

16
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,720
Hi.

17
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,720
Hi.

18
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,040
And for our Twitch viewers tonight, not the podcast folks because that part gets kind

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,880
of like cropped out of the podcast, but we had a new like we have like a little bump

20
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,160
that plays because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock

21
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,760
Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

22
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,880
And there's a few minutes that takes transition from Bobby doing his show in Atlanta over

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,480
to us in Sacramento.

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,880
So we have a little like, if you've ever watched a Twitch stream, like a stream starting now

25
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,760
equivalent or stream starting soon type equivalent that a lot of your favorite streamers do.

26
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,840
And we had a new one of those tonight.

27
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,160
We've had one for a while that used like free music that I found on some website and a bunch

28
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,360
of collage pictures of Mr. Smoosh, but we've upgraded a little bit.

29
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,580
I always thought, I did always think it was a little unfair that it was just Mr. Smoosh.

30
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,980
Like I know Smoosh is a lovely cat, but we're all cat owners here at OLR.

31
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,540
And we even don't, don't get, we appreciate a good doggo too.

32
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,820
I just want to make sure the dog people don't get pissed.

33
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,100
We appreciate a good doggo too.

34
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,100
I love a corgi.

35
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,300
I have a special place in my heart for that.

36
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,260
There is a dog in the last picture that we didn't show because Midna was kissing her.

37
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,260
I see.

38
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,260
Okay.

39
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,640
So there, so there's that, but, but we have more OLR cat representation and that was all

40
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,900
done by dark soccer, including the new music was, was you, when's the album drop sis?

41
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,900
It doesn't.

42
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,780
Um, and that, and that music to explain people, um, were saying that they did hear it in some

43
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,780
of my streams.

44
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:35,780
Um, and there was, there was a little misunderstanding, there was a little misunderstanding.

45
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:43,100
Um, well, but the thing is, is that, um, I'm really glad to, to offer it up to the channel

46
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,100
instead.

47
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:50,920
I've made some, uh, some new music for myself and I was gonna do, um, I, my plan for today

48
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,440
was actually to work on my channel trailer cause I'm streaming, you know, I'm trying

49
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,160
to get at least once a weekend.

50
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,600
Um, and I made this like in a world, you know, type of serious music.

51
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,120
I'm like, you get to watch this person suck at dead by daylight.

52
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,240
Um, and I was getting everything ready to do that.

53
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,240
I'm like, no, I hate it.

54
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:14,720
And then Rob was like, we, we, uh, you know, we were talking about the, the intro, the

55
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,200
pre-intro, I guess for the show.

56
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,200
And I was like, I'll do it.

57
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Yeah.

58
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
That still cracks me up.

59
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,360
How that happened is that you sent me that intro, that song and you, it intended to use

60
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,860
it for your channel, but somehow I didn't get that message.

61
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,280
So it was very much a, um, here, Rob, I made this and I went, you made this.

62
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,280
I made this.

63
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:38,600
Bog made this and so there it is now it's on bog, but, uh, I appreciate you giving us

64
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
the song.

65
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,480
You made a new one for your channel and it's just as good.

66
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,480
So it worked out, I guess you just had to, my intro one is actually a looped version

67
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:56,520
of my first completed song that I did, um, and I would like to do like just more music

68
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
like that.

69
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,800
I mean, really right now, I'm not the best like keyboardist, even though for people who

70
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:10,760
are in Twitch right now, I do have myself a nice MIDI keyboard and, uh, I'm still working

71
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
on stuff.

72
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,680
I actually paid for my first, uh, logic plugin and I got the, uh, the synthesizer they use

73
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,160
for the Sega Genesis.

74
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,480
Um, before I get to Loki, uh, there's a very well-timed question in chat that I think we

75
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,480
need to address.

76
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:29,200
Uh, so going to our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network, SSJ 100, Matt says, serious

77
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
question.

78
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,880
Could we say drop pet photos in the subscriber chat for it to be added to the photo roll

79
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,240
roll if it's somehow changeable, Jamie, I think we have an answer for that.

80
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,240
Yeah.

81
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,840
Um, I was actually, we were talking about this before the show, but I would love to

82
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:51,420
have, um, some submissions, um, in the chat is one thing you can private message me your

83
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,000
pictures instead, because I check chat kind of infrequently.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,480
Um, so I'll set up a Twitter thread at OLR, Jamie, and I can just send you the pictures

85
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
that people post.

86
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,640
I think that's probably the easiest way to do it.

87
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,360
We'll do a Twitter thread at OLR and for people that are anti Twitter, then they can reach

88
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,360
out to you directly.

89
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,800
Uh, honestly, Twitter is going to be difficult for me.

90
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
No, no.

91
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,680
I can, I can pull it all down from Twitter and send to you one big file.

92
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
Yeah.

93
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,680
Yeah.

94
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,680
Then that works.

95
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,680
I just need to know.

96
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:27,320
Um, like if you have the picture in the picture title, put your name and your cat's name.

97
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,840
That's what I want the picture to be labeled so that I know who's is who's.

98
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
Awesome.

99
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,360
So, um, yeah, that, and what you guys saw tonight was the first version of that anyway,

100
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,600
because, um, there was a, there was a booboo we're not going to highlight, but Jamie has

101
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
to fix it anyway.

102
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,160
So we're going to add more, uh, add more pictures.

103
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,200
Yeah, it's not a big deal, but we were, the plan was to add more stuff anyway.

104
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
All right.

105
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,840
Anyway, uh, enough talk about something that podcast folks don't even see.

106
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,440
I'm sorry, but I hope you will check out the archive sometime at twitch.tv slash vog network.

107
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,720
Um, you do have to be a subscriber to see the video feed completely.

108
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,600
Um, but there's a lot of clips, like, uh, people have been clipping parts of the show.

109
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,960
There's, there's a lot that you can just kind of look at for free anyway.

110
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,360
Um, and then make it available somewhere.

111
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
Yeah.

112
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Who knows?

113
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
Who knows?

114
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,360
Anyway.

115
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,360
Um, so say hello as well to tech master Loki.

116
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,360
Sorry, Loki.

117
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,680
How are you doing?

118
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
I'm doing good.

119
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,480
Um, now did I, what, what is running behind you?

120
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,360
Because I swear I saw your own name in that.

121
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,360
What is going on here?

122
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
Loki.

123
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
That is my own name.

124
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,600
This, this is, uh, the only historical evidence of the greatest gameplay ever, ever I've ever

125
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
experienced.

126
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,840
So this is actually on our, um, orange lounge radio, uh, YouTube page.

127
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,480
It's a short sighted.

128
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
Yeah.

129
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,840
So this is, um, we have an updated, I just want to point out.

130
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,880
I think that's the last thing that's gone on the orange on your YouTube page.

131
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,800
It hasn't been updated in like 10 years.

132
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Okay.

133
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,520
Like the orange on your YouTube page is kind of a relic at this point.

134
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,640
You want to see how cute we were in our early thirties and late twenties.

135
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,960
Go to the OLR YouTube page.

136
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
It's all there.

137
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,360
But yeah, so it, it's a evidence of the modded grand theft auto games, uh, grand theft auto

138
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,480
four games we used to play on Xbox three 60 with my coworkers.

139
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:12,680
And I seriously have not experienced a more fun version of any game except for that.

140
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,760
And then they patched it out of course, and hadn't played a regular game, which is still

141
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,280
fun, but it's, it was, it's not as, not as fun, as crazy as just everything that you

142
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,280
see in the video.

143
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,080
So, um, that's, what's running behind and I'll probably switch it up to the other short

144
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,240
I have as well with the evil swing set.

145
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,800
How long until grand theft auto six Loki, how long do you think we're going to be waiting

146
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
there?

147
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
I don't even really play five.

148
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,760
You know, um, I really got out of that.

149
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,920
I finished the single player campaign and then it's all been grand theft auto online

150
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,560
updates and I just haven't gotten into it.

151
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
It's such a grind.

152
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,320
Um, it's just not really fun.

153
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,880
Um, some of the races though and stuff look pretty cool.

154
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,200
I used to watch this YouTuber Ali 43, he used to do a lot of the different races and things

155
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
that you can do online.

156
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,600
So there's some fun there, but I just, I don't know, I play Minecraft, so I haven't really

157
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,400
gone back to five, but when six comes out, yeah, I'll, I mean, I'll definitely pick it

158
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
up.

159
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
I'm going to our chat.

160
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,460
Dark Tetsuya says, I got five for free.

161
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,920
So grand theft auto five for free on Epic.

162
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,560
Wondering if I should install it.

163
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,160
Well, yeah, it's a great game.

164
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
Yeah, absolutely.

165
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,000
I mean, if you haven't played through it, you should, it's just, I don't know.

166
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I liked four better.

167
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,380
I liked like the open world stuff's fine, but like the way they set up the online matches

168
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,300
and stuff, I liked it so much better because they kind of put you into a section of the

169
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,860
map and you fought it out there.

170
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:41,260
It's not like this big, I don't know, open world thing where you can do races and stuff

171
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,260
like that.

172
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,540
I just like it more structured kind of like Call of Duty or something like that.

173
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,660
Well, I guess Call of Duty now is a big, you know, battle arena stuff.

174
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:53,400
So, um, but like the more traditional like Call of Duty type of stuff where it's, it's

175
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,220
a, a level or an arena granted the whole map is open, but they only put weapons as small

176
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,860
portion of it.

177
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,600
And so I really liked that kind of setup where it's more structured like that, but now it's

178
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,340
just like, well, you know, you can have a death match over here or over here.

179
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,220
And then, I don't know, it just wasn't as fun.

180
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,500
I don't know what to say.

181
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:20,980
It's hard to go back when you have, you know, Uzis that shoot, um, grenades and it just

182
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,500
explosions everywhere.

183
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,900
And then there's planes flying down close to the, you know, road and just flying cop

184
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:33,380
cars with nuclear shotguns or suitcase bombs and stuff, all this modded stuff that we put

185
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,380
in there.

186
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,380
And it was just so amazing.

187
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,860
Bobby Blackwell also points out that Grand Theft Auto five just went back on game pass.

188
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,900
It was gone for a little bit, but it just came back.

189
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,620
That was some, a recent headline.

190
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,940
I do want to point out though with Dark Tetsuya's question, even though we're kind of sitting

191
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,380
here going, yeah, install it.

192
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,380
You know what?

193
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,580
There's a very real hesitation and a very real reason to ask that question.

194
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,740
And I'm going to give Dark Tetsuya the huge benefit of the doubt there because I've been

195
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,380
in this very similar situation and it is those fucking bandwidth caps.

196
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,060
And if you don't have to deal with those through your cable provider, congratulations.

197
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,060
Good for you.

198
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,060
You are lucky.

199
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,060
You are.

200
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,180
You're very lucky because I'm telling you those bandwidth caps are a pain in the ass

201
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,020
and a game like, um, Grand Theft Auto five is going to be something like, it's gotta

202
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,040
be like 40, 50, 60 gigs.

203
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
Like it's pretty big.

204
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
Yeah.

205
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
It's a big game.

206
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,240
So you really have to think about that kind of stuff before you just go download it.

207
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,960
Um, I think it's a really good game.

208
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,320
It really is like the single player campaign was, it was all right.

209
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
I liked it.

210
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,960
Um, but yeah, it's, it's got a good story.

211
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,960
It's fun.

212
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
The heists are fun.

213
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,280
Um, I don't know.

214
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,840
There's a lot to do in that game.

215
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,520
It's very like pack full stuff.

216
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,480
And if you really have the patience for Grand Theft Auto line and that could be fun, but

217
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,800
it's just, it's such a grind.

218
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,320
They make it so grindy with like, you have to pay rent for your apartment.

219
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,160
You have to pay rent to have people fix up your cars when they get destroyed by another

220
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
player.

221
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,000
Like that stuff is, that's stupid, but I understand why they're doing it because that's where

222
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
they're making their money.

223
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,100
They're trying to sell their shark shark cards.

224
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,760
So they make it an unnecessary grind and that kind of ruined it for me because I used to

225
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,560
like, you know, Grand Theft Auto four, for example, great game by itself.

226
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,080
And then they released the loss of the dam expansion, which was also great.

227
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,160
And then the ballad of gay Tony, which was also great.

228
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,340
Like all of the content grant, the thought of four was just amazing.

229
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:28,640
But then they found out they can make lots more money by having to persist to online

230
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,640
mode.

231
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,880
And so that's where it's going to go.

232
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,940
And that's where six is probably going to go, unfortunately, even though the campaign

233
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:40,980
is really good, but I'll buy it anyways, because I love those games.

234
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,420
So it is disappointing though, that it's not structured the way it was because I really

235
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,420
did like those.

236
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,420
All right.

237
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:53,220
Uh, so I, I'm looking and there's a, I usually read all the, uh, donators and stuff at the

238
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,340
end of the show after we go off air, just live only on Twitch.

239
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,140
But I have to acknowledge that there is a hype train going on right now.

240
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,860
And I, I just put in a hundred biddies myself to kick it up to the next level.

241
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,400
So people get more emotes.

242
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,420
So I'd own their pixel pockets, just did it too.

243
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,700
And many of you are donating bits and subs and thank you guys, you really don't have

244
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,700
to do that.

245
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,700
I know.

246
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,700
Thank you.

247
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,700
Thank you all.

248
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,940
And I'll read, I'll read that all at the end of the show as I usually do.

249
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,140
I, I, you know, it's, it's tricky cause we're walking that line between we're recording

250
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,340
our podcast yet we are live on Twitch and it is very custom for Twitch streamers to

251
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,900
thank people right as they donate.

252
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,420
But it is hard when you're trying to, you know, do these stories and all these other

253
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,140
things and try to keep the flow of your show going, which isn't as pleasant to listen to

254
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,580
when you're in your car on a commuting train, you know, it's like, Hey, you were talking

255
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,580
about this story.

256
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,580
You don't get sidetracked.

257
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,340
Uh, us at OLR get sidetracked.

258
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,460
I guess maybe it's something you've come to expect here at OLR.

259
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,460
I don't know.

260
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,620
Who do you think you're listening to?

261
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,620
Oh my gosh.

262
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,620
You guys are so kind.

263
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,700
VGRealness donated more and said, don't tell me what to do.

264
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,700
You're not my real dad.

265
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,700
I did it again.

266
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,780
What are you going to do about it?

267
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,300
Punish you.

268
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:12,820
All right, moving on, uh, let's get it before things get really awkward here at OLR.

269
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,500
Let's move on and talk about our kickoff topic tonight.

270
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,620
Uh, Loki, you want to tell us a little bit about this, the, the, I heard you like stores.

271
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,620
Yeah.

272
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,580
So Epic says, Hey, you know what?

273
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,140
We have a storefront, let's make more storefronts.

274
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,980
So, uh, that's what they're doing.

275
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:35,660
They're adding some different apps, um, into the Epic game storefront and, uh, some of

276
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,500
those, they had five non gaming apps included with it.

277
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,860
So they have a brave, which I guess is some open source web browser can shape, uh, which

278
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,060
is actually really cool.

279
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,980
So this is, um, if you're in game development, you'd probably know who Kenny is.

280
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:57,060
Kenny is this guy who develops a lot of these free, um, creative commons, zero free to use

281
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,360
assets.

282
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,240
And so he has this new thing called Ken shape that you can use to generate simple low poly

283
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,440
objects, just kind of drawing a picture and assigning like depth to it.

284
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,440
And so it's really cool.

285
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:14,000
So he's, um, they have that on there, uh, Krita, which is a painting and drawing app.

286
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,320
Um, and then of course I heart radio, you guys are probably aware of that.

287
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,800
Um, but then there's also, um, I guess like some itch IO stuff in there as well.

288
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,680
So that's kind of interesting.

289
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:31,040
Um, does that mean I can, uh, put pixel poops number two on there?

290
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,240
That was, that was a question I was going to ask you, does this mean that now pixel

291
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,640
poops, uh, number two is available on the, uh, on the, um, Epic game store?

292
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,680
I mean, I guess it does, doesn't it?

293
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:48,560
I mean, I, I guess, I guess you can, yeah, you can go within the store and then purchase

294
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,200
pixel poops number two, if you wanted to.

295
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Huh?

296
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,960
So technically, yes, we're on the Epic game store now, I guess.

297
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,160
All right.

298
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
That's great.

299
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,440
Um, and, uh, Bobby is saying in chat, it's literally just the itch IO app that you can

300
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
download.

301
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,840
You can download it from their site or from Epic game store itch IO games are not listed

302
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:16,520
on Epic game store, which is how a lot of people are kind of reporting this is that,

303
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,320
Oh, it's embedded within, you know, the Epic game store.

304
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,280
They're, they're, they're, they're taking over, uh, itch IO and all this stuff, or I'm

305
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,960
sorry, they're Epic has taken over itch.

306
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,600
I it's, that's not the case.

307
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,160
So I think the app based thing is a way to think about it.

308
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,680
It's just basically that they're launching their own app store, which when you consider

309
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,600
what they've got going on in court and all this stuff right now, you know, again, I'm

310
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,560
not going to touch that right now, cause we've got a long way to go in the court proceedings

311
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
and all that stuff.

312
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,020
But to hear that Epic is launching their own app store itch being one of those apps.

313
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,740
That makes a lot of sense.

314
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,740
Right.

315
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,740
Yeah.

316
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,540
And, and it's still pretty cool though.

317
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,380
It's more exposure because there may be some people that are on, you know, get played stuff

318
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,780
from steam or Epic games that they even know what it is.

319
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,300
So, you know, more exposure is not a bad thing.

320
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,420
Yeah, for sure.

321
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,760
Um, and, uh, yeah, you're right.

322
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,940
People may not necessarily, um, go to the itch website or even think about that, but

323
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,980
maybe if they see within the Epic store and their Fortnite launcher that they're, Oh,

324
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,640
there's this whole other game space, it may be a place that they can get exposed to even

325
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
more stuff.

326
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,520
And there's a lot of great stuff on itch.io, obviously.

327
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,540
And I'm sure many of you own a truckload of games on itch.io already.

328
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:34,400
Cause I, there were a lot of people I knew that participated in that, um, black lives

329
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,100
matter or I was at a racial justice and inequity bundle.

330
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm sorry, I forget the actual name right now, but it was, it was, it was what they

331
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,760
did when, you know, uh, that was really in the focus, um, as, as it should continue to

332
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,760
be, let's be real.

333
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,760
But you know what I mean?

334
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,400
Really, really in the focus, uh, in June of last year, they did that bundle and many people

335
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,480
probably picked up like, there was like 2000 games in that bundle or something like that.

336
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Right.

337
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,880
And how many did y'all play?

338
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,520
You know, so, um, there's, there's a lot, talk about a backlog, right?

339
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,160
So, uh, so many backlogs.

340
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
Yeah.

341
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
Uh, this is funny.

342
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,520
VG realness and chat is like, whoa, I mixed missed a few weeks.

343
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,360
Did Loki release his game?

344
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,720
Well, let it be, let us get you caught up.

345
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,600
Yes, he released his game.

346
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,640
Um, it is, um, so, uh, if you want to give Loki the most money for the game, you're going

347
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,600
to go to itch.io and buy it there basically.

348
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,840
But I have to kind of plug Aaron or YYR's pixel poops as well.

349
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,040
So I would really also want to point you over to the steam store where the game pixel poops

350
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,360
is free to play.

351
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,000
Um, and you can check that out.

352
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,080
That's our buddy YYR.

353
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,600
And then there are two other versions of the game that are basically DLC.

354
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,120
You have a cute little Commodore 64 version, which not enough people are talking about.

355
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,000
You can buy that for, um, a certain amount of money that I forget in the moment, but

356
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,480
it's under $5.

357
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,560
And then there's your version of the game Loki, which is an NES game.

358
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,720
And it's, you know, it's a little more, it's like $10, but you are getting like a really

359
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,240
full NES cartridge experience.

360
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,400
And there's still, yeah, and I'm still working on the special edition of it.

361
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,800
So the special edition has actually 10 more levels.

362
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,640
Um, it'll be a free update.

363
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:23,120
So if you do purchase it before then you'll get a free update soon because I only have

364
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,240
two more levels for it.

365
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,260
Although I just saw tutorials on how to do animated tiles, so I may have to tweak that,

366
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,000
but there's still like some updates I want to do to that.

367
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,280
And then yeah, eventually like a physical release.

368
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,320
I don't know how I'm going to do that yet.

369
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,840
Um, I have cartridges.

370
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,760
I can at least make 12, um, which based on the downloads so far and the purchases that

371
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,960
may be all the interest we have, so we can, we can do it, but, um, we can see what we

372
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,440
need to come up with there, but yeah, I've, I do want to have packed that cartridge as

373
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,800
full as possible, um, before I actually start burning those.

374
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,880
So that's why I made like, at least it's going to be at least 10 more levels.

375
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,760
Um, I want to do more, but we'll see.

376
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,880
Um, VG realness and chat says it's no longer the running joke of the podcast.

377
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,880
What's it going to be now?

378
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:18,040
Um, well, this is tough because maybe I was going to say Loki's, Loki's a game maker.

379
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,200
Dark soccer is a music musician.

380
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:29,560
Uh, I, um, well, um, maybe, maybe that's the joke and I don't even cook.

381
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:38,120
I, I like to talk, uh, I'll do a series of motivational speeches or something.

382
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,120
I don't know.

383
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,120
Yeah, exactly.

384
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,120
This is like crickets.

385
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
So that's the new joke.

386
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,120
My life.

387
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,200
Your life is great.

388
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
No I do.

389
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
I do have things pretty good.

390
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,320
I can't, but, but if you can't make fun of yourself and your friends, how are you going

391
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,280
to make fun of somebody else?

392
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
Yeah.

393
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,280
All right.

394
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,280
Oh, thank you.

395
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Look at that.

396
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I was fishing, fishing for compliments there.

397
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
S2 100 Matt.

398
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,440
Rob is a great MC of things.

399
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,440
That's right.

400
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
You know what?

401
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,960
I look forward for COVID to being over and I can get back into live hosting and doing

402
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,040
panels and stuff like that.

403
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,800
I, I, they, I, you're right.

404
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,160
I, I love, I missed that a lot.

405
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,160
So soon.

406
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:22,600
Anyway, back to, uh, the Epic games store, adding another store, um, what do you, so,

407
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,840
so Loki, do you think this is going to sell that 13th copy of the game or no, this isn't

408
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,120
going to have, this isn't going to change anything.

409
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,600
That's not going to change anything.

410
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
It's a nice app though.

411
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:37,040
I haven't had that downloaded yet, so, um, I get to see all the stuff that I own, which

412
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
is a lot.

413
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:43,000
I'll be curious kind of like how that works, if it's still kind of all embedded within

414
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,600
the Epic store kind of front, or if it goes, cause it sounds like, especially the way Bobby's

415
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,280
describing it, it's like, it's just a whole separate thing.

416
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,640
So you don't even really have to wait for the Epic store to have it.

417
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,680
You just go download it on itch.io's website and you check it out there.

418
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,680
So there is that.

419
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,680
So, all right.

420
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,260
Well, um, at the end of the day, do you think this is a good thing for indies or does this

421
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,800
feel like, Oh, it might be a cash in or something like that?

422
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,520
I think it's a cash in at all.

423
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,880
I think it's good to have that stuff out there.

424
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,640
It'd be even better if it was integrated into Epic game store, but I can understand why

425
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,440
they don't do that.

426
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,440
Yeah.

427
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,200
Um, yeah, we'll see, we'll see what ends up developing.

428
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,720
I'll be curious to hear if any developers on itch.io notice a little boost from this,

429
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,240
but yeah, I doubt at the end of the day, it's super kind of likely like either you

430
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,320
are looking into these things or you're not.

431
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,320
Right.

432
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
So, right.

433
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,320
Yeah.

434
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,320
All right.

435
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,720
Um, anyhow, moving on, um, gosh, you got to that level four hype train in chat.

436
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,720
Thank you guys so much.

437
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,800
There was a lot of anonymous donations and things like that.

438
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Gosh, gosh, gosh.

439
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
I'm very, very thankful.

440
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,800
Okay.

441
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,800
Um, before we get into our gaming weeks, a little bit of other housekeeping here at the

442
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
voice geeks network.

443
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:57,560
I do want to give a shout out, um, to our pal, uh, Shane or, or shad stars, like, um,

444
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,360
because he was a huge and instrumental in making this bonus stream happen here at the

445
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,360
voice geeks network.

446
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:08,600
This past week, uh, we did Shane's definitive Pokemon rankings, uh, and he illustrated his

447
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:14,520
bottom 10 Pokemon and his top 50 Pokemon, and he even put together a PowerPoint.

448
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,200
And so I'm actually very thankful that he like, you know, he kind of said that as a

449
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,680
joke and then I was like, Oh no, now you got to do it.

450
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,880
And he actually did do it.

451
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,600
So I, you know, he's, he has better things he could be doing, um, like playing monster

452
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,200
Hunter, I'm sure, but he did take the time out to do that and do the stream.

453
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
And it was fun.

454
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,560
Uh, I thought it was, you know, we, we ruffled a lot of feathers, I'm sure with the rankings,

455
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,180
but, um, it was, it was a lot of fun.

456
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,260
So check that out.

457
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,820
If you are a subscriber here, uh, at twitch.tv, which a lot of you just became tonight, uh,

458
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,180
with gift subs and things like that.

459
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,220
So check that out.

460
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,480
You can check that out, um, in the archives right now that's available.

461
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,400
And we are looking to build more stuff out there in the archives so that, um, those of

462
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,200
you that are so generous in subscribing, um, you know, really have, have more to look forward

463
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,680
to as an extra special way to say thank you.

464
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:06,880
Um, by the way, yes, I heard about the podcast app getting subscriptions and stuff this week.

465
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,960
Uh, no comment on that at this time.

466
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,120
I, we don't know enough details.

467
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,760
I, right now the focus is on, on VOG.

468
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,680
Um, and I, I do not see us, um, well, let me put it this way.

469
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,120
It's been for the past 19 years, our MO has been, this show is free.

470
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,200
This three hour thing that we do on Sunday nights, because it's a way to hang out with

471
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,460
friends and all that stuff.

472
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,460
That's free.

473
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,880
That will not change period.

474
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,880
Anything we do is going to be something extra in addition to that.

475
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,900
Um, but I, I don't know if that is going to be, I, I'm kind of a little more focused on

476
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,420
what we're trying to do, uh, at Twitch right now, but I know that question is going to

477
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,420
get asked.

478
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,300
Um, so I'm just going to clear up that air right now.

479
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,980
Um, let's see, uh, what else I want to say with that?

480
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,180
Oh, so Shane did the Pokemon ranking stream.

481
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:58,580
It was a lot of fun and we're starting to raise the channel points for another stream.

482
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,300
Bobby's going to do the next one.

483
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,960
He's going to do something a little similar to what he did the first time with the tapes,

484
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:10,040
and he's going to be doing some more E3 footage, uh, unearthed from the early two thousands.

485
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:16,600
Um, and this is also neat because Bobby hasn't re-watched these tapes and he's going to go

486
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,500
and put them onto Twitch.

487
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:24,040
There may be more embarrassing shit like when he got Charles Martinet to be like, oh, it's

488
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,040
Robert's TV show and all these things, which if you haven't seen the clip, please see the

489
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
clip.

490
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,360
So we don't know what kinds of stuff will show up there, so please, uh, look forward

491
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,360
to that.

492
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,040
I'm almost confident we're going to raise the points, uh, and, uh, that'll happen in

493
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,040
the coming weeks.

494
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,160
And then the ball will be back in our court to do something, but there are ideas there.

495
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,160
I actually have ideas right now that I don't even necessarily want to do channel points

496
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
for.

497
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,160
I just want to do it.

498
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,200
And Dark Sakura, we've been talking about some stuff like that and, uh, I want to rope

499
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,860
Loki in on some ideas too.

500
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,860
So we'll see.

501
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,860
We'll see.

502
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,860
All right.

503
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,980
So anyway, uh, check that out all over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

504
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,100
Let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the types of games that we have been playing

505
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,100
this week.

506
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,100
Dark Sakura.

507
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,220
I know where this is going to go, but I think this is interesting.

508
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,220
So go for it.

509
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,220
It's more than animal crossing.

510
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,220
That's true.

511
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,220
It is more than animal crossing.

512
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:21,140
So, um, yes, of course I did play animal crossing and I'm still playing word scapes.

513
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,140
Um, but of course I'm playing dead by daylight.

514
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,060
Um, I am not great at it.

515
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:32,300
Actually, it takes more than five rounds of playing the game to, you know, actually

516
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,300
be good.

517
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,900
Although I finally got someone to sacrifice.

518
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:43,900
Um, but, uh, I've been enjoying, uh, trolling trolls in the game.

519
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,420
You know how people like try to do the teabag move and everything.

520
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:52,700
And there were these, uh, little jerks that were up on it, whatever the name of the, the

521
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,300
Myers level is where the houses hadn't filled.

522
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,300
Yeah.

523
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,900
Well, they were up on this like awning of a house.

524
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,460
So I just sat there throwing up on them the whole time.

525
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:07,460
Cause I played the Vami Mami and Legion is still number one in my heart nurse will be

526
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,980
my end game.

527
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,980
But right now I'm leveling the Vami Mami to get her stuff, to get a teachable.

528
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:21,620
Anyway, I also did, uh, download another game on Apple arcade that I plan on streaming when

529
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:28,060
I, uh, when I have a, a little bit more of a mood for it and that's Fantasian.

530
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,060
Oh yeah.

531
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,060
I want to see that.

532
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,060
Sign me up.

533
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,060
Yeah.

534
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:37,220
Um, so, uh, because I do have my subscription to Apple arcade and I am playing on a Mac.

535
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:45,940
Um, for the record, I get a lot of people now asking me about like how I'm playing,

536
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,100
um, dead by daylight on a Mac.

537
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:55,740
And they're like kind of floored that, that I am using Stadia and that I'm streaming from

538
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,740
Stadia.

539
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,740
Yeah.

540
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,180
I, even I'm impressed that you're streaming gameplay from Stadia.

541
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,380
The only time I've ever streamed Stadia footage was actually on this show.

542
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,220
I think the week it came out or the week I got it when Bobby gave me a code or whatever,

543
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:13,260
I recorded it in advance and then played it back on this show.

544
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,540
I think that my video quality has been pretty good.

545
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,980
Um, I've already downloaded a few, I've, I've clipped a few things.

546
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,820
You can see it on my channel later on.

547
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,100
Once you, once you fixed your proportions, you couldn't see the URL and that stuff anymore.

548
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,100
It looks great.

549
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,100
Yeah.

550
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,100
Yeah.

551
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:33,740
Um, it was, yeah, I really had to just tweak a lot of things in there, but, um, I'll be

552
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:38,620
playing, um, some other games I think through Stadia as well, depending on, uh, when they

553
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,620
come out.

554
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:46,060
Like I'm considering, I mean, I don't want to buy, um, mass effect through Stadia because

555
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:51,780
I want to eventually get my virtualization cleared up and, you know, have like a Parallels

556
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,140
desktop or something.

557
00:27:54,140 --> 00:28:01,940
But um, I'm considering just trying to do a mass effect when it comes out through Parallels,

558
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,780
if I can get that, but yeah, Stadia has been a delight.

559
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,340
I take back every bad thing I've ever said about it.

560
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,340
Interesting.

561
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,340
Huh.

562
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:19,220
On top of that, they had a lot of the dead by daylight DLC, um, on sale cheaper than

563
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,140
how steam had it for a bit because they had it for half price.

564
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,700
Be sure to promote that in your streams too, that you're playing on state.

565
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,980
I think you do, but be sure to make sure Stadia is in there cause I, Stadia does have a small

566
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:35,100
but loyal following and I bet they would seek out just people that are streaming on Stadia.

567
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:40,480
Um, orange right in chat says I did play Stadia on my Twitch before it's definitely possible.

568
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
Pretty interesting.

569
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,200
The one problem I have, and I'm going to send this out as sort of a warning to other streamers

570
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
on Mac.

571
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,680
Um, so one thing about OBS that people don't realize is that you're going to have to have

572
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,080
a second sound input that your system sounds will route through.

573
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,920
I use this app called EQ Mac and that's what I used to capture my game audio.

574
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:06,960
That's why when I was streaming animal crossing before my game audio wasn't being picked up.

575
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,640
This very broadcast is coming to you from a Mac mini and we had to do a similar thing

576
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,360
here in studio for that.

577
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,360
Yeah.

578
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:19,240
Um, so to answer what Stadia is, it is a streaming game service owned by Amazon.

579
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
Google.

580
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,760
Um, Google or Google.

581
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,240
No, Amazon's was something different.

582
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,240
Amazon's was Luna.

583
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:31,280
Amazon is through Google and it's, uh, lots of really great games on there.

584
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:36,040
I wish they did had a bigger library, but you can actually, it is like the G force now

585
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,040
thing.

586
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,600
Um, and I was going to use the G force now.

587
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,920
I actually really prefer Stadia.

588
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:45,640
Um, but it's really just, it's been really great.

589
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,800
There's a lot of good games on it.

590
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:51,280
It's enough to make me think about, uh, subscribing again to, uh, Stadia pro.

591
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:59,200
Um, but back to the other thing, um, I've also found trouble with steam labs, OBS capturing

592
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,600
my stadia screen where standard OBS does it just fine.

593
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,200
So just wanted to throw that out there for other folks who might consider playing on

594
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,560
stadium streaming.

595
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:11,920
I do also to, uh, clarify what I'm amethyst Rose, which is saying in our chat with the

596
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,320
questions about Stadia and video G force.

597
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,480
Now, one thing you do, you do, especially cause I noticed amethyst Rose, which says,

598
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,920
okay, I love G force now.

599
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,160
Well, one thing you're going to want to be very aware of is, is that the pricing structure

600
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,840
is very different between the two.

601
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
That's the other big thing.

602
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,960
I mean, in functionality, they're both cloud based gaming services, but Nvidia kind of

603
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,600
taps into games you already own.

604
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,120
Like it looks at your steam library and you know, what's installed on your computer and

605
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,720
you kind of connect it to games that you already own.

606
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,960
And then you're paying Nvidia basically to rent their computer and their, their super

607
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,000
powerful computer and stream from that.

608
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,400
Uh, but of course they have that free version, but you might run into a queue.

609
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,720
You're limited to an hour.

610
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,280
So there's things with that, or you can pay the 10 bucks to have the, whenever you want

611
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,320
it and the highest quality and all that stuff.

612
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:02,280
But, uh, you're not paying to rent the computer or what have you, not paying to rent Google's

613
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:08,520
computer, but you are having to buy the games uniquely on Stadia's storefront.

614
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:13,320
So when you buy a game on state, unless it's cross play or cross purchase, which very few

615
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:19,600
are, unless you have Stadia pro, then you pay 10 bucks a month and you can get a bunch

616
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,520
of games for quote free.

617
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,520
Yeah, right.

618
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,600
There is that as well.

619
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,080
So, so just, I want to make sure that the pricing configurations are a little different

620
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,200
between the two and kind of like where the ownership is.

621
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,440
And I think that's important to weigh when you're deciding which one you want to go with.

622
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,120
But I really do think, especially when Microsoft, which they're getting closer and closer to

623
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,020
launching this whole thing with Xbox, when that gets closer and they launched that fully,

624
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,000
I think you're really going to see cloud gaming take off in a lot of different ways.

625
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,860
Um, which has me a little bit nervous again with the bandwidth cap thing, but I'm hoping

626
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:57,620
as that becomes more and more the norm, there's going to be more pressure on cable companies

627
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,980
to increase that cap to something reasonable.

628
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,980
But we'll see.

629
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,980
I don't know.

630
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,580
It's that this is a process that will take years, not months to be honest.

631
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,580
Data should be free.

632
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,620
It really should be.

633
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,820
But we all know, you know, yeah, anyway.

634
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,820
All right.

635
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,060
Uh, so that was a dark soccer's gaming week.

636
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,700
Oh, actually one of the things, and I don't mean to make this the dead by daylight cast,

637
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,700
which we've talked about.

638
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,700
We've talked about the game.

639
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,180
Maybe we should do that.

640
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,640
Well, let's talk later.

641
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,320
But um, I do want to ask about this because you were kind of saying I'm struggling with

642
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,680
the game a little bit.

643
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,560
It's hard, you know, to get in there.

644
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:34,680
And obviously practice is a big deal, but I have found this element of it fascinating

645
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:39,780
for me, quite frankly, Jamie, is that you like to play the killer, which is a first

646
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,480
person game.

647
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:47,580
You have been very adverse over the years to playing first person games because of what,

648
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:52,100
you know, it can make you sick if it's not, you know, the right thing and all this stuff.

649
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:58,460
So I'm, but I know the lore of this game and everything else is like, Halo's lore did not

650
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:03,980
pull you in dead by daylight's Lord pulled you in to make you go enough like, all right,

651
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,580
I got to just mentally give this a shot.

652
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,300
So I play windowed.

653
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,700
Oh, you play it in windowed.

654
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,900
So that way it's not your entire screen.

655
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,900
Ah, exactly.

656
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,460
So then it's just a smaller area.

657
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,460
Yeah.

658
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:22,820
I mean, I play with a pretty, pretty big screen, you know, I mean, keep in mind my I've got

659
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:29,420
a 32 inch ultra widescreen monitor with a really great refresh rate.

660
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:33,500
So it turns out that the other part of things had to do with the refresh.

661
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:40,140
When I'm using a 60 megahertz screen, I get more nauseous having a higher refresh rate

662
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,140
on my monitor.

663
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:45,460
So I have a 144 has actually made it a bit easier for me.

664
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,460
Okay.

665
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,580
So that was exactly what I needed to know is kind of like, how did you consolidate that

666
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:53,500
and kind of, I don't want to say, get over it because when we're talking about physical

667
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,740
things, I don't want to ever say, you know, Oh, get over it.

668
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,980
But how were you able to kind of make it work, I guess.

669
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,860
And that, that explains a lot because yeah, when you play in windowed mode, then your

670
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:05,940
eyes can kind of fixate if it needs to on the static background and that kind of helps,

671
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,940
right?

672
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,940
Yeah.

673
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,940
So it really does help.

674
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,660
And the fact that actually the color of my background.

675
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:16,380
So I have this a super Metroid background that's, you know, the, the dead people in

676
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:22,700
the lab and the purples and blues actually add a nice frame around it that I also get

677
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,420
less eye strain out of it.

678
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:32,420
And so, and to answer, I answered DJ Ron mass already, but I'll say if it's an LG monitor,

679
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,020
yes, my monitor is an LG.

680
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:39,340
I paid almost as much as my Mac for, for my monitor.

681
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,340
Yeah.

682
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:51,100
Well, I cash stocks, but yeah, I, and I make sure that I keep softer light in my room.

683
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:57,420
Like right now I have my lamp on cause I'm doing the show and I'll probably have it for

684
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,060
other streaming events later.

685
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,500
But it's, I've got to do a couple of things and I also make sure that I have something

686
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:09,180
a little carby to eat because it keeps my stomach from flip-flopping.

687
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,740
I just, I just think that that part, so it's not even really just about dead by daylight.

688
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,660
So, you know, don't, don't razz me too much for talking about this game in depth three

689
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,660
weeks in a row.

690
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:23,540
But I think it's more the dark soccer kind of over or kind of accommodated this you know,

691
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:27,300
thing that she's dealt with in first person games before to make it work because dead

692
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,580
by daylight and the story and the uniqueness of it has appealed to her that much.

693
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,860
I find that super fascinating, honestly, but absolutely.

694
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:38,380
But I also think that's part of why you're having an uphill climb Jamie, because I know

695
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,420
you were asking like, well, how did you do it so fast?

696
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,260
Well, I've played a crap ton of first person games.

697
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,300
I've played the halo.

698
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,100
I've played all this other stuff.

699
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:50,380
And I think inherently there's stuff with that, that you have to get used to on how

700
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,580
those games control and how they move.

701
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:56,940
And so you trying to navigate that and trying to make sure you don't get sick while playing

702
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,940
it.

703
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,900
I think you're going to have an even longer uphill climb.

704
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,900
You'll get there.

705
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,900
Practice makes perfect.

706
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,900
Right?

707
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:07,380
Yeah, well, and I, I mean, the thing is, is that I know that the game still for, for Killers

708
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,540
has a pretty decent curve on it anyway.

709
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:14,860
It does, especially since I'm starting with one of the harder characters when you have

710
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:18,820
to, you have to work your way up and level the characters that you can get more perks

711
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,700
and then the perks help you do better.

712
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,700
It does.

713
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,700
It has a steep climb.

714
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,700
She's tall.

715
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,180
I'm not used to tall.

716
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:30,300
Like I do better and now I and I'll get off the topic in a second.

717
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:37,140
I've done better with some of the faster characters like Legion and trickster.

718
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,140
They're fun.

719
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,220
I like the fast ones.

720
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:45,260
I mean, tricksters, even with his Buffy still not very good, but, um, I hate, I hate playing

721
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,260
Bubba.

722
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,540
I hate him and I'm going to have to level him for barbecue.

723
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:53,220
So yeah, it's just, I think that that's the thing is that I'm getting over characters.

724
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:58,660
I'm not having a lot of fun with to get to the stuff I'm going to have fun with.

725
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:02,460
Cause when I get to nurse, it's over, it's over for you host.

726
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:09,500
Oh, cause if someone can play nurse really well, just bend over and kiss your ass.

727
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,500
Goodbye.

728
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,500
All right.

729
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,220
Um, I do want to also mention, um, cause we've been talking about the, uh, you know, these

730
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,780
issues and pixel pocket says, thanks for the tips, Jamie.

731
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:21,380
Um, I try to get around, I try to get around motion sickness with windowed screen, large

732
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,660
F FOV field of vision.

733
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,660
Right.

734
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,800
Um, and recently got a 144 Hertz monitor and it's helped, but some games still cause it.

735
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
Yeah.

736
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,240
I I'll have the same problem.

737
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:38,480
Um, and the thing is the field of vision with, uh, in a dead by daylight is very, I guess,

738
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,480
human range.

739
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,040
Um, like when I'm playing a plague, Vami Mami, she's taller.

740
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:49,160
So her field of vision is different for me, but when I'm play somebody who's got a field

741
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,480
of vision, that's very similar to short little me, you know, it's easier.

742
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,840
I don't, I don't have as many problems with it.

743
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:01,000
Um, and there are, I think perks you can get that expand or add ons that expand your field

744
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,360
of view for your character.

745
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,360
Wraith has some.

746
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
Yeah.

747
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,360
Yeah.

748
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,360
Well, ding dong.

749
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:15,520
But anyway, um, I, I don't know, I I've, I've seen them in play and the standard FOV is,

750
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,580
is honestly better.

751
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,440
And then one other thing I want to point out is that, um, Bobby Black Wolf was kind of

752
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,660
speaking up to, to one other thing you've been kind of open about your aversions with

753
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,660
on the show.

754
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:30,300
And that is VR, which I, I don't think is anything against VR as it is, but that VR

755
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,140
kind of plays into a lot of the same things that have triggered sickness and first person

756
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:40,200
games if I'm not misstating these, but Bobby points out, and I think this is also interesting.

757
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,780
This is why VR devices are pushing for higher refresh rates.

758
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:49,360
The valve index now does 124 or excuse me, 120 Hertz.

759
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,660
So it's interesting to see that VR, that industry realizes this as well.

760
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:57,880
And they're trying to get to those higher refresh rates to maybe hopefully one day when,

761
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,960
when more people like you over, we'll see.

762
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,960
So we'll see.

763
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
We'll see.

764
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,960
Interesting.

765
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,960
All right.

766
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,860
Uh, anyway, thank you for indulging my, uh, questions there.

767
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:09,860
And, uh, I will say, um, live here at the voice of geeks network, um, tonight after

768
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:15,760
the show, I believe you're gonna show, show some of your chops on some of my not chops.

769
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,760
So I think it's basically just going to be a giant puke fest with vami mommy.

770
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,960
So you're going to be streaming a little bit after OLR tonight.

771
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,960
So it'd be fun to watch.

772
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,960
Yeah.

773
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,020
And keep in mind, I don't normally like to stream after we do or do much of anything

774
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:34,580
after OLR because, um, I, I'm usually really tired after this show, but I'll switch off

775
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:40,660
my headphones and put on the, the desktop audio and I'll, I'll suck it up for y'all.

776
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,660
All right.

777
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,660
Sounds good.

778
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,660
All right.

779
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,100
Uh, Loki, thanks for waiting.

780
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,500
And how was your gaming week?

781
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,940
Uh, it was pretty much all the same.

782
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:55,860
So been all Minecraft all week long playing on that multiplayer server that I'm on now.

783
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,160
Still also trying to edit my video together.

784
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,200
I'm almost done with the first episode.

785
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:06,620
It just, um, I need to do more voiceovers because a lot of the stuff that recorded before

786
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:13,120
I didn't do voiceovers during, um, just because it's hard to do that, you know, in the area

787
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:19,520
that I am, um, so it's just a lot of voiceover recording and editing together for that.

788
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,320
But I am enjoying it.

789
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:26,240
I'm, uh, built some farms and have to open up a shop.

790
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,540
So I've got a lot more farms to make.

791
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:32,420
And then I've taken the week off this week to play a lot of that.

792
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:38,360
So it'll be a lot of Minecraft this week and then Orna, a little bit of Orna as well.

793
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,500
Uh, I haven't, I haven't, I gotta admit, I've completely fallen off the Orna wagon.

794
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,400
I haven't played in a month.

795
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,400
Easy.

796
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,680
It's just, I can only fit in so many of those games, right?

797
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,640
When I'm out and about and Orna's kind of got, I think Pokemon go kind of got my interest

798
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,080
enough again, where it's like an Ingress to an extent where Orna's kind of in the backseat.

799
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,900
I don't know how much longer the Ingress thing is going to last, but they're really trying

800
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,200
to push new stuff in that game to keep it interesting.

801
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,560
I'll talk about that in a second.

802
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,640
Um, so Orna's just kind of in the backseat for now.

803
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,640
Yeah.

804
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,680
I've been just trying to grind at that cause I'm still like one 84.

805
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,360
Like I can't level up.

806
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,720
It doesn't, it's, I don't know.

807
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,040
I like fight boss after boss.

808
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,440
I guess I should do more of the raid bosses, but like, I don't know.

809
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,600
It doesn't seem like I'm earning XP very fast.

810
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,600
Yeah.

811
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,600
It's, it's a grind.

812
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,600
It really is.

813
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,440
I just take over areas as I go places.

814
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,960
World bosses, world bosses are the fastest way to do it.

815
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,760
Drop, drop the coin, drop the end and try to drive around safely, pull over in parking

816
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,760
lots.

817
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,760
Okay.

818
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,160
And you know, hit every world boss you can in the parking lot, drive to another parking

819
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,160
lot, do it again.

820
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,160
And same, same.

821
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,080
Oh, I, I fight bosses all the time, but it's just nothing.

822
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,280
I mean, it just doesn't seem to be making a dent.

823
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,280
Yeah.

824
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,280
It's tough stuff.

825
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,320
All right.

826
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:53,560
Do, liberally run those coins and XP boosts because if, especially because you probably

827
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,440
have hundreds of them in your inventory, there's no need to do every time.

828
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,920
Every time I play for like any given amount of time, I will do that and I'll do the raids

829
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,200
and or the gauntlets.

830
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:08,040
Um, a lot of times I've been doing like the, uh, endless gauntlets and stuff to, you know,

831
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,680
earn some more stuff or I'll do the boss only ones.

832
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,680
Yep.

833
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,680
Um, it's just nothing.

834
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,680
It doesn't make a grind.

835
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,680
It's a grind.

836
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,680
All right.

837
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,120
Uh, so, okay, then if that's it for your gaming week, I'll talk about my gaming week, which

838
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,840
has, um, um, not a lot of new stuff this week.

839
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:27,240
I've been continuing on in Final Fantasy 14 a little bit, except all of my buddies who

840
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,360
play Final Fantasy 14 have kind of fallen off the wagon a little bit as they're, they're

841
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,660
playing other games.

842
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:37,600
So I really only get on, pardon me, to do like an expert or something a couple of times

843
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,000
and there's not a lot else for me to do.

844
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,200
Although I do need to run that new near raid again, I'll probably do it tomorrow, uh, run

845
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,320
them all to get my coins, to get upgrades.

846
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:51,380
Um, there's a big, uh, Final Fantasy 14 fan event coming up in a couple of weeks and they

847
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,720
just released the schedule for the fan event.

848
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,420
And man, this is where worldwide events stink because like the keynote, I think it's from

849
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:02,940
like eight to 10, but no, maybe it was earlier, but it was like six to eight Pacific, which

850
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,080
is fine.

851
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,180
But then the programming goes all night long.

852
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:10,760
And if you want to see the concert, guess when the concert airs two AM to three 50 Pacific

853
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,240
time, I'm not gonna be awake for that.

854
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,040
Nobody on the East coast is going to be awake for that unless you're a diehard Final Fantasy

855
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,580
fanning, 14 fanning to stay up all night.

856
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:23,800
So hopefully they let us watch that stuff on demand and I can see it later, but the

857
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,440
keynote's the most important part because that's where all the news will be.

858
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:30,900
So, um, Ooh, if they let us co-stream that again, maybe there'll be another, uh, reaction

859
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,960
thing we'll do here at VOG.

860
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,960
We'll see.

861
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,760
Um, Bob coffee and chat says it must be running on JST.

862
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,760
Absolutely.

863
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:46,160
I think they were going to, at one point, uh, invite a few fans to act and not like

864
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:51,040
a ton, but just a few to feel like, uh, you know, to, to safely fill a small room and

865
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,820
do the presentation, do everything that way.

866
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,320
I think don't quote me on this.

867
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:59,240
I think they've had to, or they are calling that off because unfortunately Japan is, uh,

868
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,880
regressing a little bit on the COVID thing.

869
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,800
So I don't think, um, that is all happening in person after all.

870
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,060
I think it's going to be similar to their event, um, a few weeks ago where it's going

871
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,740
to be a very awkward, empty room, but that's just what it is right now.

872
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,740
So you're laughing.

873
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,740
Loki.

874
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,740
What's a damn funny.

875
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,740
Nothing.

876
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:15,740
Okay.

877
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:16,740
Read some stuff.

878
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,740
All right.

879
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:18,740
That's fine.

880
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:19,740
I was like, COVID is not funny.

881
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,740
Don't laugh at that.

882
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:21,740
All right.

883
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:22,740
Okay.

884
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,740
Moving on.

885
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:28,940
Um, other things in my gaming week, um, I've also been playing the mobile games, uh, ingress

886
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,860
and Pokemon go, um, not a lot notable.

887
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:37,380
I was really irritated with that Pokemon go event yesterday because, um, Alan and I

888
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,380
have been looking at houses.

889
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:41,740
I haven't really made that a secret on the show is that we're looking to buy finally

890
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:46,440
after all these years, as is everyone in this area, did you know, this is the hottest real

891
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,700
estate market in the entire nation right now.

892
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,700
It's disgusting.

893
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:53,420
Um, so yeah, we have a, we have a lot to deal with right now.

894
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:57,980
Um, so, uh, but anyway, um, we, we've been doing all that.

895
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:04,940
And so, um, I, uh, missed like the first hour and a half of that Pokemon event on Saturday.

896
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:10,780
Um, thank God the collection event was really easy, uh, because I was able to finish it

897
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:14,540
after all, or I would have broken my perfect streak and I would have been really upset

898
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,540
about that.

899
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,900
So, um, just something to state there.

900
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:18,900
So, uh, yeah.

901
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:24,860
As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, yeah, the 11 AM to 2 PM was too short for that event.

902
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,300
It really was community days are six hours long.

903
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,780
Why wasn't it at least that long?

904
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,540
That was a little ridiculous to me.

905
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,780
I still been playing Ingress.

906
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:34,900
They've been doing events and that one too, like they're running a event right now for

907
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:39,740
like the week where they, they have changed one of the core game mechanics, which is very

908
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:44,460
interesting to me currently now in the game for the next week, you can throw a field under

909
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:48,740
an existing field, which probably doesn't make sense to people who don't play the game.

910
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:54,340
But um, part of it is you, you link point, you link pokey stops their version of it together

911
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:57,060
to make fields for your team's color.

912
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:01,500
And a core thing in the game is that links can't cross and you can't field under an existing

913
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,500
field.

914
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,500
You have to take the field down to field.

915
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,140
Um, and that's the, so one of those rules, they're changing up this week, so that's kind

916
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,140
of interesting.

917
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,580
Um, but also there's a huge boost in AP or experience.

918
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:16,140
Um, and so I've been trying to get like 30 minutes of exercise every day.

919
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,700
So I'll just go out, play that, do some like, I walked downtown the other day and just did

920
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:24,100
what I call micro fielding where you just, just hack all the portals, link, just try

921
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:28,500
to, you know, field very small areas of downtown and get tons of stuff that way.

922
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,060
And I was at the college campus the other day and I'll probably go somewhere else tomorrow,

923
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,100
uh, and, and keep up with that throughout the event.

924
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,620
So there's been that.

925
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:40,820
Um, and then, uh, the other thing I've been playing this week of course is dead by daylight,

926
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:45,140
but here's, here's the part where I'm sure y'all are going to laugh.

927
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:50,980
I bought dead by daylight on steam, even after I'd invested all that time in my Xbox one

928
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:51,980
version.

929
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:56,220
Finally, those things that came up last week where I'm like, I need to be able to turn

930
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:59,380
around quickly and use keyboard and mouse and all this stuff.

931
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:02,140
I finally broke down and bought it on PC on steam.

932
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,220
I had to have it that way.

933
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:10,620
Now before you, oh yes, oh God, I, I've felt my gameplay improved tremendously with the

934
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,180
monitor right in front of my face as opposed to the TV.

935
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:17,580
I'm seeing more the headphones, which I don't have for my Xbox one.

936
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:22,940
Um, I'm able to, um, hear more and that game is very important on sound cues.

937
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,340
I didn't realize, especially if you play spirit.

938
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,020
Oh my God.

939
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:26,540
Well, yeah.

940
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:30,380
And even just playing the killer, you've got to be able to hear the coughing and the, you

941
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,900
know, crying and stuff.

942
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:36,300
And, uh, I think for survivor to some point to, um, uh, sound is very important.

943
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:42,220
I'm really tempted to try to, to see if I can find Strider, um, to, to have teachable

944
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:47,500
soon, but just for that reason, that's one thing, one good thing about, about plague

945
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,460
is that you can hear people retching when you vomited on them.

946
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:51,420
Yeah.

947
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:54,220
So there, yeah, there's a lot of important sound stuff in the game.

948
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:59,900
Now, before you all give me crap about buying a game multiple times, ha ha, guess what?

949
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:06,140
This is the first time I've bought dead by daylight because Xbox game pass allowed me

950
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,220
to play it on Xbox one.

951
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,460
And I had played a little bit on windows game store.

952
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:14,860
I opted for steam because I was told, uh, and, uh, found out around the internet windows

953
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,100
game store never has sales.

954
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:17,420
Never.

955
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,420
So, um, I bought it on steam.

956
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,780
So, um, this is actually the first time I bought the game.

957
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:25,340
Unfortunately, the DLC is the stuff.

958
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:25,660
Thank you.

959
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,580
I thank God I didn't buy a lot of it.

960
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:31,820
Uh, and that, um, my, uh, my, my murder sister, dark Sakura kind of hooked me up with a lot

961
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:32,380
of it.

962
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:37,580
Um, so, um, it doesn't, it doesn't feel like as big a loss and someday they will implement

963
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:42,300
the cross purchase and I'll be able to get all the stats back, but we'll, uh, we'll see.

964
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:51,580
So, yeah, I know, um, actually for, for, uh, behavior's website, um, you, um, I don't know

965
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:57,180
if they have any kind of link through Xbox, but they do have a stadia and a steam link.

966
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:57,500
They do.

967
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,300
And it does not include windows store or anything else yet.

968
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,660
Although they say it's kind of sucks.

969
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:05,660
And to clarify, I'm sorry, DJ Roma S says the Microsoft store does have a lot of sales,

970
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:07,260
but they don't advertise it as well.

971
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:07,820
I'm sorry.

972
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,420
I may have misstated what I said.

973
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,220
Yes, that is true.

974
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:13,900
And the Xbox, uh, market front does a lot as well.

975
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:19,180
Um, specifically dead by daylight is, uh, you go on the Reddit and thing like that.

976
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:22,700
And people will say they never have sales on dead by daylight or the characters in the

977
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,580
windows store.

978
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:26,540
So, um, I just opted to get it on steam, whatever.

979
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:31,660
Um, cause steam was having also steam was having a half off sale on the game itself

980
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,300
anyway.

981
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,460
So that made me kind of pull the trigger on that.

982
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:39,260
So stadia is I think also having a sale though on the gold version of the game.

983
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:39,740
Oh, nice.

984
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,580
Like 36 bucks.

985
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,080
Yeah.

986
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:47,580
I, I did, I re-bought pyramid head because of course I think I will be a pyramid head

987
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:48,940
main when all is said and done.

988
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:53,980
And, uh, I did buy Bubba or leather face, which I didn't even have on Xbox one just

989
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:56,940
because I'm like, I need to get that perk and why not?

990
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,700
I'll have this killer in my repertoire.

991
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:01,020
Um, and I've been playing mostly Bubba.

992
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:05,020
Um, I, I don't like his talent at all.

993
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,940
Like I think the chainsaw thing is kind of crap.

994
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,980
It's nice for getting through pallets quickly.

995
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,820
But he is what a lot of the streamers would call an M1 killer.

996
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:17,820
Meaning you use your mouse, you use your mouse button one and that's about it.

997
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:18,780
So anyway.

998
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,700
All right, enough about that.

999
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:25,980
Let's get into some other gaming news and talk about what else is going on in the industry.

1000
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:29,740
Uh, bonds double 06 is also pointing out the store have sales.

1001
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,100
They don't promote it.

1002
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,780
Well, if a tree falls in the woods and no one's around to hear it, does it really make

1003
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,280
a sound?

1004
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,840
I guess to use a, to use a very old antiquated analogy.

1005
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,340
All right.

1006
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,760
Uh, let's get into some other news space.

1007
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,280
Can no one actually hear you scream?

1008
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,520
All right, Loki.

1009
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:55,440
So we talked about how Sony was planning on getting rid of the PlayStation three and Vita

1010
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,360
storefronts, and that was making people upset, of course.

1011
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:07,680
So thankfully Sony has decided that it's going to, uh, hold off on shutting those down.

1012
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,840
So basically upon further reflection is clear that we made the wrong decision here.

1013
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:16,320
So I'm happy to say we'll be keeping the PlayStation store, uh, operational for PlayStation

1014
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,800
three and PlayStation Vita devices.

1015
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,400
PSP commerce functionality will retire on July 2nd.

1016
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:28,880
So sorry, PSP, but you know, all your batteries are probably bloated anyways, and none of

1017
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,040
those devices work anymore, but at least the Vita and the PlayStation three though,

1018
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,720
those would be, uh, prolonged.

1019
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,440
A lot of the PSP content is on the Vita store.

1020
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,560
Am I correct in that?

1021
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:43,120
Like, cause yeah, cause you can get those, you can get the PSP games for the Vita.

1022
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:47,280
So I have a digital version of that final fantasy four PSP, which is the greatest version

1023
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,960
of that game that I bought on the Vita marketplace because it went on sale at some point for

1024
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,240
like 14 bucks or something.

1025
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,920
So I bought it like years ago.

1026
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,160
So the Vita still has a lot of the PSP content.

1027
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,320
And I think that's why you're not hearing this little footnote as much.

1028
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:05,360
Plus maybe people are just a little more willing to let the PSP go because how old is that

1029
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:05,840
thing now?

1030
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,120
Like 14 years old, probably.

1031
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,040
It's pretty old.

1032
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:09,520
Yeah.

1033
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:09,920
Yeah.

1034
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,560
So, um, too bad.

1035
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,480
You know, I really wish they would do another handheld.

1036
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,000
I know.

1037
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:16,240
Right.

1038
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,680
It wasn't so bad.

1039
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:22,560
Like Vita was trying to do some things that it probably didn't need to do.

1040
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,840
Like the back touch panel.

1041
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,320
Really?

1042
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,840
I don't think we really needed that.

1043
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:29,280
But like it, it was solid.

1044
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,600
I thought the Vita just had some weird shit.

1045
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,560
The V that's what I did.

1046
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,840
The Vita had some weird shit.

1047
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:40,880
It was the, not just the back touch panel, but things like near like no one could, I

1048
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,800
think to this day, you still can't explain how that actually worked.

1049
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:49,520
Whereas Nintendo did a much better job explaining street pass and those types of things.

1050
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:54,720
And especially with how big portable gaming is in Japan, which is only further approved

1051
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,120
by how hot cakes the switches over there.

1052
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:01,280
I am really surprised Sony's never tried to do another handheld and I'm surprised they

1053
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,720
gave up on the Vita as fast as they did, at least here in the US.

1054
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,880
That was just kind of, I don't know.

1055
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,520
But I suppose, you know, this is, this is a topic that, you know, is five years old

1056
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,400
at this point.

1057
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,040
Um, it's, it's, it is what it is.

1058
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,320
Are we surprised though that Sony reversed course?

1059
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,680
I have to admit, I'm a little surprised they reverse course.

1060
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,480
And I'm not, I know this sounds weird.

1061
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,080
I'm not exactly sure why they did it.

1062
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,920
Like, here's the crazy thing.

1063
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:35,680
And I know you're probably, you, you are probably all going, Rob, didn't you just last week

1064
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,800
talk about like the backwards compatibility and how, yes.

1065
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,000
And that is all still true.

1066
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,800
And I can still believe that and still sit here and say, I'm kind of surprised Sony backtracked

1067
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:49,520
because I'm not sure there's a ton, a ton of people who are going to log into their

1068
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:54,240
PlayStation three and Vita's and stuff and start going on a downloading binge and celebration.

1069
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,120
They might, I don't know what I, and I want to make probably should, I've got like a 500

1070
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,560
gigabyte hard drive in that.

1071
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,840
So I should, I should probably fill it up.

1072
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,680
And, and I want to make my stance clear.

1073
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:11,600
I, it, I, I, I, I, and I'm sure it's great that the stores are staying open so that this

1074
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:16,000
PlayStation one content and two content and all that stuff is accessible and playable.

1075
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,040
That is all great.

1076
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,240
What do I really want?

1077
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,160
I want that to be playable on PlayStation five.

1078
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,960
I want my library to go to PlayStation five.

1079
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:29,920
That, that, and that is really, you know, and if maybe Sony can cross that bridge, then

1080
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:35,680
they can safely probably close these old stores and, you know, they, they won't have quite

1081
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,600
the same, you know, uh, pushback.

1082
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,480
If I can play sweet code and one and two on my PlayStation five now, then I don't have

1083
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,560
to worry about the PlayStation three version.

1084
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,520
That makes sense.

1085
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,680
That's where that really comes down to.

1086
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,080
So, um, let's see.

1087
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:54,560
SG100 Matt points out the Vita was just getting into doing some good remote play, which would

1088
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,760
have been cool in this era.

1089
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,720
Absolutely.

1090
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:03,920
I, the, how quickly Sony abandoned the Vita TV thing blows my mind.

1091
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,320
Absolutely blows my mind how fast they abandoned that PlayStation TV.

1092
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,680
I wish I knew where mine was.

1093
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,760
I have one somewhere.

1094
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,040
I just don't know where it is.

1095
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:19,840
I honestly, if they're going to keep these stores open, Sony should really consider putting

1096
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:20,640
that back out.

1097
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:27,120
I know that sounds ridiculous, but you know, with, with the Chrome cast, the Apple TVs,

1098
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:31,600
the Roku's and all this stuff of the world, there is a place for, there's a place for

1099
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,880
PlayStation TV in there.

1100
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:34,560
I don't get it.

1101
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,600
I don't, but that was the time to jailbreak those systems too.

1102
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:44,080
I guess not that that's what Sony, not that that is going to be incentive for Sony to

1103
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:49,920
put those back out, but you know, I, I, it just blows my mind.

1104
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:55,440
They could have done a classic thing for PlayStation one on a Vita TV for it.

1105
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,520
Anyway, it's just not going to make sense.

1106
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:04,880
Well, let's talk about PlayStation decisions that I think do make a little more sense because

1107
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,920
I feel like this one came up on the show previously.

1108
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,560
And it's something being tested called the PlayStation plus video pass.

1109
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:18,560
Apparently this was posted on Sony's website, but it was posted in another country.

1110
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:24,080
I think it was, was it the, this particular story I'm looking at?

1111
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,360
Doesn't say where.

1112
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:29,760
So I really looked at the wrong story here, but I believe it was the Polish store.

1113
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,480
Yes, thank you.

1114
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:32,720
Okay.

1115
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:38,320
It was the Polish store that said, um, a new benefit is available for a limited time on

1116
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:44,400
PlayStation plus PlayStation plus video pass is a trial service that will be active.

1117
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,640
Uh, and it was really quick, I think for, for a year.

1118
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:53,280
So April 22nd, 2021 through 2022, this is a benefit available to PlayStation plus users

1119
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,400
in Poland.

1120
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,120
Now Sony interactive entertainment did confirm.

1121
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,720
This is something they're testing in Poland.

1122
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,520
So this is not a rumor at this point when this was first reported.

1123
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,920
This was a rumor leaked website.

1124
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,760
No, Sony has confirmed it.

1125
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:11,040
Um, this will allow PlayStation four and PlayStation five users in Poland, which is their test

1126
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:17,520
market to access over 20 movie and television shows from Sony pictures as part of PlayStation

1127
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,840
plus subscriptions with more content that they're going to add every three months.

1128
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:26,960
And if you actually look at a screenshot from the Polish website for PlayStation, you see

1129
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:32,640
zombie land, double tap venom, you know, and other things that are related to Sony.

1130
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:39,120
Uh, so a way to, um, I guess increase, uh, the, the value of being a PlayStation plus

1131
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:39,840
member.

1132
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,840
And to this, I say this makes an awful lot of sense.

1133
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,080
In fact, I, I, so correct me if I'm wrong.

1134
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:51,360
Didn't we bring this up on the show a few months ago about how could Sony compete more

1135
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,480
with game pass?

1136
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:57,360
And I swear I said, or one of us said, Sony is also a movie company.

1137
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,560
Why aren't they leveraging that?

1138
00:57:59,200 --> 00:57:59,920
Well, guess what?

1139
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:05,600
Here that plan apparently was in the works and here they are, they are leveraging that

1140
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,240
side of things.

1141
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,560
Now, let me ask this question.

1142
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,760
Does it matter?

1143
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:13,440
I asked that to our chatters over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

1144
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,720
I asked that to my cohost.

1145
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,800
How does free movies from Sony entertainment?

1146
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,280
Does that sweeten the pot a little bit?

1147
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,440
Loki, let's start with, you know, not really because, and it's just because I have so many

1148
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,440
streaming services I subscribed to already.

1149
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,840
Like for example, venom is supposed to be on a dizzy plus here pretty soon.

1150
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:36,480
Um, it's nice to have something else in there though.

1151
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,200
Like it would be cool.

1152
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,280
Like if they just said, Hey, you get, you know, these two games for the month of like

1153
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:46,160
may and you get this movie, you know, added to your library and you get an increasingly

1154
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:50,880
large library of movies and games, then yes, that would seem like it's sweetening the pot,

1155
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:56,640
but also at the same time, I don't really care because I, there's not anything that

1156
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:01,840
like, I need to go back and see what they need to do is they just need to offer this

1157
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:06,640
stuff so that it's more like, they need the, they need to drop the price of those movies

1158
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:12,640
down, um, to the point where it's just kind of like a, you know, impulse buy.

1159
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:16,880
And so people can build libraries like they have on steam where it's just like these large

1160
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:21,040
libraries of things that no one plays, but then you can acquire all these movies as well.

1161
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,200
Um, that might be cool.

1162
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:24,240
Okay.

1163
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,760
Uh, looking in chat as some responses there, and then I'll ask dark soccer.

1164
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,640
Um, so, uh, bonds double six is talking about you're right with their music, film and games,

1165
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,600
crunchy roll and funimation bundle it into the monthly sub.

1166
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,960
You can go from playing a game to anime on the same system and so forth.

1167
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,120
Pele Hanumea says could be cool.

1168
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:44,480
Uh, DJ Rama S is also bringing up the anime streaming services.

1169
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,640
It could sweeten the pot, but meh.

1170
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,960
Uh, act deaf says more bang for your buck.

1171
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,840
Uh, SJ100 Matt pointing out that Sony and Disney has that, have that new deal for Spider-Man

1172
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,880
and other Marvel to be shared on their respective services.

1173
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,960
That was a thing that just came up this week.

1174
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,240
And you got to wonder, is there something with the timing there?

1175
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,360
Hmm.

1176
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:07,840
Uh, Quest Buster says, I guess we'll see if it matters in a year if they stick to it.

1177
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,480
That's how long they will be testing this in Poland.

1178
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,800
Um, I, I, I feel like the test is actually a lot shorter than that.

1179
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,040
Yeah, I read the website.

1180
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,400
I saw what it said.

1181
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:22,880
I feel like if this is going to happen, we're going to hear about it at E3.

1182
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,760
Well, Sony doesn't do E3, but you guys know what I mean.

1183
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,960
That time frame, whatever Sony's E3 equivalent is, we're going to hear more about this if

1184
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,800
they plan to expand it beyond Poland.

1185
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:33,760
And I think they will.

1186
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,040
Why wouldn't they?

1187
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,520
It maybe it's a technical thing.

1188
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,360
Maybe that's what they're kind of also testing in Poland.

1189
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,080
I don't know.

1190
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,240
Um, but I really feel like they will.

1191
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:49,600
Um, Bonds 006 also elaborates saying Sony is sitting, Sony is sitting on film, TV shows,

1192
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,800
music games, and anime.

1193
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,560
Bundle it into the current sub they have.

1194
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,760
PlayStation Plus price it less than Microsoft.

1195
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,560
DJ Rama is suggesting they call it the Sony pass.

1196
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:02,800
SSJ100 Matt says, I think the pandemic spread this process up.

1197
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,840
Quest Buster says the E3 bombshell is prepping.

1198
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,600
I don't know if I call this a bombshell.

1199
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:12,880
It's a bombshell if there's more to it that makes it more competitive with game pass.

1200
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,680
Like maybe there's another side of this we're not seeing yet.

1201
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,600
And those rumors that Sony is cooking up something to really compete with game pass.

1202
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:23,200
I'm not talking about PlayStation now, but to really compete with it on that same level.

1203
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:27,280
If that all drops at once, then that's a bombshell in my opinion.

1204
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,360
But the movies in PlayStation Plus is just kind of a, oh, neat.

1205
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,680
I don't know if I call that a bombshell.

1206
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,040
I'd call that a firework.

1207
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:39,360
It's pretty dark soccer.

1208
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,800
I wanted to get your opinion.

1209
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:45,600
Do movies sweeten the pot of these game subscription services like PlayStation Plus?

1210
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:49,600
You're muted, by the way.

1211
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,240
Dark soccer.

1212
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:50,960
I can't hear you.

1213
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:51,460
Sorry.

1214
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,960
And she's fixing that crap.

1215
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:55,520
That's okay.

1216
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:55,760
Hi.

1217
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,240
I was like, yeah, it's neat.

1218
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:03,840
I don't really feel one way or another about it.

1219
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:11,200
It's still not a service I'm using, but it could attract some people.

1220
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,000
There's always that.

1221
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,600
And if it attracts them, then happy.

1222
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:20,080
I would rather see a big package service come in, just like some of the others are saying.

1223
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,080
So something that invokes the music and the anime and all that as well.

1224
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:25,840
Exactly.

1225
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:31,120
That would be a little more like, that makes me think of something like Apple's thing.

1226
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,000
Is it Apple Plus?

1227
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,240
Apple one.

1228
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:34,800
That's it.

1229
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:39,200
They bundle it like it's, it's the fitness and the music and the news and all that all

1230
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,360
in one for like a pretty low price.

1231
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,600
All things considered when you look at everything individually.

1232
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:48,400
So like if Sony were to make a similar move with a Sony one or I don't know what, you

1233
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:48,880
know what I mean?

1234
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,000
Whatever they call it.

1235
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,120
That would be very interesting.

1236
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:51,620
I think.

1237
01:02:52,880 --> 01:03:00,400
Yeah, no, I, I honestly, I seem to really like having those combination bundles like

1238
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,240
that, especially if you're giving it, especially something in there, something that people

1239
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:09,600
are going to use, you can really, you know, people would get a lot of value out of it

1240
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:15,200
if it's got those multiple services, but still, you know, I'm also a fan of having like an

1241
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,120
individual thing you can subscribe to.

1242
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:21,680
Like if you just want the movies, you just want this so that you're not roped into paying

1243
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:25,680
for a big thing with only what, you know, that has one out of three services you're

1244
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,240
going to use.

1245
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:26,880
Right.

1246
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:27,380
Yeah.

1247
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:28,420
All right.

1248
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:30,260
Great.

1249
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:34,960
Looking one more comment here from Bonds006 in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

1250
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:41,440
Sony can leverage the US market by bringing over the content that was marketed to Asia,

1251
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,760
India, China, Japan, et cetera.

1252
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,320
It can go from games, anime, Bollywood, music, films, TV show.

1253
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,640
The anime audience is very much tied to games.

1254
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:55,680
That's a really good thought is that making maybe foreign content more accessible because

1255
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:00,000
you're right, there's absolutely an audience that would love to have like a more robust

1256
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:06,720
like Bollywood film library or, you know, movies from the like China and other countries

1257
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,560
in Asia, those places you mentioned.

1258
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:12,080
I think that would really appeal to some people.

1259
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:17,360
Some people might see that as a niche thing, but I think that's great.

1260
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:23,360
You know, there's probably a lot of crossover between like gamers, you know, and folks that

1261
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,480
would be into some of that more independent and foreign film.

1262
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:27,600
So we'll see.

1263
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,100
Yeah.

1264
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:28,880
All right.

1265
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,320
We'll see what Sony really does.

1266
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:35,360
I mean, we can sit here and go, wouldn't this be great with licensing cost?

1267
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,560
How's it going to get paid for?

1268
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:36,720
Right.

1269
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,080
Movies don't make themselves.

1270
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,040
So anyway.

1271
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:39,680
All right.

1272
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:40,160
Moving on.

1273
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,920
You've got a really timely and interesting thing.

1274
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,040
Science story, huh?

1275
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:46,580
Yeah.

1276
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,360
When I saw it, I thought it was very, very interesting.

1277
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:55,920
There are clinical trial plans for clinical trials to go on to see a video game therapy

1278
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,560
can help with adults who are suffering from COVID related brain fog.

1279
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,600
And we know what this condition is.

1280
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,800
It's the best way to describe it.

1281
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:09,760
It's just this confusion and general malaise of the mind of attention, you know?

1282
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:17,280
And it's very similar to the therapies that have been used for ADHD treatment in the past.

1283
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,200
Um, but yeah, there are people who have, uh,

1284
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:29,120
who've recovered from COVID who have this residual cognitive and functional, uh, difficulty.

1285
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:34,160
So the trial is being conducted by, uh, Weill Cornell medicine.

1286
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:43,120
Um, also with a Vanderbilt university medical center, um, to see how effective, uh, a game,

1287
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:51,440
uh, called, uh, AKL T zero one, um, on will help patients recover from, uh, this brain fog.

1288
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,480
Um, they're going to include a hundred patients over the age of 18 who have shown cognitive

1289
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:03,680
impairment, um, in at least, uh, one measure of attention and executive function.

1290
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,120
Um, half will receive treatment.

1291
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,560
Half will, will be a control group.

1292
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:12,640
Um, they are set, they're going to be completing five missions a day,

1293
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:19,120
five days a week, and it's about 25 minutes of, uh, game, uh, of gameplay every day.

1294
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:24,320
And it will go on for six weeks with four weeks of post-treatment followup.

1295
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:32,720
Um, so I think it's pretty, pretty interesting, you know, and I have to say that this brain fog

1296
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:42,480
that people are exhibiting after, uh, COVID, uh, infection is very, very similar to what people

1297
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:50,560
like me who have ME, um, experience, you know, just with our everyday fatigue.

1298
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:53,920
Um, it's just really fascinating.

1299
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:58,640
I thought the, um, ADHD, uh, parallel was very interesting too, because I've,

1300
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,200
I've heard a lot of that defined, defined as brain fog too.

1301
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:05,760
I would still, honestly, I kind of would put it a little bit more just from the people I've

1302
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:10,400
talked to you who are dealing with it more along the lines of what I have, um, myalgic

1303
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:16,080
encephalomyelitis, myelitis, sorry, I always mispronounce that part, um, or chronic fatigue

1304
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:22,240
syndrome, where it's not always necessarily a matter of being able to pay attention.

1305
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:28,960
It's being fogged out of it, you know, like you're too tired to focus on anything.

1306
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:34,080
Yeah. You know, um, these, uh, these long haul kinds of symptoms, this is really going to be

1307
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:39,200
interesting to see how, you know, we, we've got the vaccines now and hopefully we're on our way

1308
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:45,280
to vastly minimizing COVID. I think it would be, um, a little bit too silly to say something like

1309
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:50,880
eradicating COVID. That's not something, yeah, unless you can somehow get the entire planet to

1310
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,520
take a vaccine at the same time. I don't think it's going to go away.

1311
01:07:54,240 --> 01:08:00,000
So let's also be real. We've already had one mutation of it. Yeah. Sorry. Two mutations.

1312
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,960
Oh, more than that. Yeah. Yeah. But anyway, there's two, there's two more active strains

1313
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:10,800
out there right now. But my, my point is, is that, you know, even if we get COVID to a manageable

1314
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:15,680
level where it really is like a seasonal flu, let's say, you know, and we're dealing with it

1315
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:19,600
in similar capacities, we're not having to shut things down because we have a way to kind of get

1316
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,360
it. I think it's going to be interesting to see kind of the shift turn to how we deal with some

1317
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:28,480
of these long haul systems and really treating COVID. There's been a lot of talks about

1318
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:34,000
preventing COVID, but we haven't talked a lot about treating COVID and surely scientists are

1319
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,600
working on that. And they've been working on it since the very beginning. And that's where you

1320
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:42,720
had the talks about, you know, that, that drug that, you know, who was saying was the miracle

1321
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:47,680
drug and no, but that whole discussion came out of, you know, the, you know, the, you know,

1322
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:53,040
but that whole discussion came from treating COVID and how do you do that? And there's going to be

1323
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:58,320
more talk like that in the future too. So I just think that's interesting. And also, you know,

1324
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:04,480
not just a miracle drug, but therapeutic, you know, a therapeutic kind of treatment like you

1325
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:10,080
might have for somebody who has a physical accident or a stroke or something that involves,

1326
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,280
you know, physical rehabilitation. I think that's very interesting that that is something that

1327
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:17,520
they're kind of talking about with COVID. That's what this is. It's this video game therapy is

1328
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:22,720
a type of physical rehabilitation. It really is. It's brain training. I mean,

1329
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:27,360
really is what this is brain training. Yeah. So very interesting. Very, very interesting.

1330
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:31,760
All right. DJ Rama S in chat says, and more people are going out because of the vaccines.

1331
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:37,440
Slow down people. Yeah. You got to. Yeah. I mean, today I will, today you got to wear your masks.

1332
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:43,680
You still have to minimize content. Today is my full 5g activation day. Yay. It's been two weeks

1333
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:49,440
since the second shot, but, um, you're not going to see me running to a crowded bar anytime soon.

1334
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:55,440
And when I'm not, I ain't ready for that yet. Um, but I've already, I will, I will like to

1335
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:01,040
see my other vaccinated friends as their 5g fully activates and give them a big hug. And that I,

1336
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:06,320
that I will be able to do, and that will feel good. Well, and I've just, you know, like for

1337
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:12,640
my, my, uh, charity group for the sisters, I've been flat out two weeks. I'm not going to have

1338
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:16,160
the meeting with you all for another two weeks. And that's if everybody at that meeting is

1339
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:23,360
vaccinated. And I still, I know I mentioned on the last show, right? Allen got scheduled for

1340
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:29,200
a shot. So Allen got his first shot this week. So he, he got to join team Pfizer with dark Sakura.

1341
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:33,440
So I don't know how that worked out, but, uh, that we have different vaccines in the same household,

1342
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:39,760
but whatever he took, he took what they gave him. So that's that. So the countdown is on for that.

1343
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:44,000
All right. Anyway, um, let's move on. Let's talk about, uh, our next story,

1344
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:52,400
which I believe is Loki's. So Microsoft is, um, went ahead and added that FPS boost

1345
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:59,360
to a few more games now. So a lot of these are EA, well, it's actually as to say all EA titles. Um,

1346
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:06,080
so now there's about, it looks like 12 new titles that are supporting 120 Hertz.

1347
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:11,680
So battlefield for Titan fall, Titan fall to battlefront battlefront two plants versus

1348
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:18,560
zombies, garden warfare and garden warfare two, as well as a battle for the neighbor Ville, um,

1349
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:25,520
battlefield one battlefield five mirrors edge catalysts and unraveled two. And then for CS

1350
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:32,000
solitude, they added 60 Hertz support as well. And that's on the series X and S. So, uh, that's

1351
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:39,440
a pretty nice enhancement for those titles. Yeah. Uh, I wonder if that had kind of a priority

1352
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:43,440
because they have that agreement with game pass and everything where EA play as a part of game

1353
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:48,800
pass. Yeah, I bet. I bet that plays anyway. Yeah. So, and, and we just talked earlier in the show

1354
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:53,520
about how increased frame rate, especially for a lot of the type of games that EA likes to make

1355
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:59,120
can be very helpful for some people. I'm assuming that a lot of that all probably got, uh, upgraded

1356
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:04,160
because it isn't like everything they have run on frostbite anyways. So like making enhancement

1357
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:08,800
for one to run at 120 Hertz and you probably apply it to everything kind of like how they did

1358
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,000
with like backwards compatibility. You get one game to work with that and you can get a bunch

1359
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:17,920
of other ones to work. So maybe that was the, you know, maybe that's why, I don't know if everything

1360
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:25,440
runs on prospect, but I know a lot of their games run on frostbite. Oh, so it's kind of like they,

1361
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:31,040
they made the engine work better essentially. Yeah. I mean, that's why I would think, but

1362
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:36,640
no, it makes a lot of sense for Andromeda. Yeah. Right. And I was thinking Mass Effect as well,

1363
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:39,760
but they probably don't want to take Andromeda is one thing, but they probably don't want to

1364
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:43,120
take away from that remaster coming out. They don't want to be like, Oh, we improved Mass Effect

1365
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:46,320
one, two, and three. So don't worry about that remaster. No, no, no, no, no. They want your

1366
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:53,840
money. They're doing it on, um, on unreal though. Yeah. Um, I think so. I think it's whatever the

1367
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:59,680
old games used. It is. Yeah. So, um, yeah, you're right. They switched to frostbite with, uh,

1368
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:05,120
Andromeda. So that's kind of a different thing, I think so. Yeah. But also a lot of those games that

1369
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:10,800
Loki mentioned kind of date back to the three 60 era. And I think with, um, you know, Andromeda

1370
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,560
being a little newer from the Xbox one era, it probably already runs pretty well. And there's

1371
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:20,560
not a lot that they can do to it. So there's that. All right. Well, I'll have to check out some of

1372
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:24,720
those games. I've been meaning to go back and play garden warfare again. That one's kind of fun.

1373
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:32,320
All right. Moving on. Let's talk about, um, this, uh, interesting development in, uh, some former

1374
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:37,520
folks that used to be with bungee studios. Uh, of course, you know, bungee is the team that made

1375
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:44,480
halo back in the day. Uh, destiny is a big thing that they're working on. Well, uh, firewalk studios

1376
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:50,080
is a company that's made up of, uh, or I should say the founders of firewalk studio worked on

1377
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:55,520
destiny previously. And it was announced this week that Sony interactive entertainment has picked up

1378
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:00,480
the rights to an upcoming game from this studio. Of course, we don't know what it is because this

1379
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:07,200
studio hasn't announced anything yet, but this sure seems timed well for June, doesn't it.

1380
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:14,080
And an announcement there. Hmm. Anyway, there was a PlayStation blog post and in the blog post,

1381
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:20,240
Tony Sue, uh, from firewalk studio, the head of that says for our team, the opportunity to create

1382
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:25,120
new worlds and inspire more amazing moments for players around the world is the fire and ambition

1383
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:29,840
that keeps us going. The PlayStation team has a deep love and respect for the medium of games

1384
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:34,800
and some of the best expertise and capabilities in the world to help make big ambitions a reality.

1385
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:41,120
Obviously we have no idea what they're working on. You could assume it's a destiny like game,

1386
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:47,760
but then again, you know, take a look at Halo and then take a look at destiny and kind of like how

1387
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:52,800
those games like destiny kind of has some of the, like, yes, they're both first person shooters,

1388
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:57,200
but they're very different and how they work. So it'd be very interesting to see kind of like

1389
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:02,640
what that evolution continues to, uh, with firewalk studios. And of course we're even

1390
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:07,440
assuming it will continue to be a first person shooter. I think it's a safe bet. I don't suddenly,

1391
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:13,120
Oh, they're going to do an RPG. I, well, destiny has RPG ish elements. Who knows anything's

1392
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:18,800
possible, I guess, but I would expect it's going to rely a bit on, uh, probably some of their past

1393
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:24,640
expertise. Anyway, the studio was formed in 2018. So they've been working on something for a little

1394
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:31,040
while. Um, let's see, uh, uh, Sue is the lead of this. Uh, he was the general manager and

1395
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:36,800
senior vice president of destiny, uh, over at Activision, uh, Riley, Ryan, Eli, uh, if I'm

1396
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,720
saying that right, maybe Eli, sorry for the butchering of the name. There is a game director

1397
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:45,840
and was a former bungee creative director, executive producer, Elena Siegman, uh, was

1398
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:50,880
a producer on guitar hero two and Bioshock infinite. And then destiny as well. That's

1399
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:56,800
quite the diverse resume, isn't it? That's it. Yeah. The cast on that one's pretty impressive.

1400
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,640
Yeah. So that's, uh, that's pretty cool. So anyway, other people at the studio have worked

1401
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:05,280
on things like call of duty, apex legends, mass effect. Apparently they have some folks from there

1402
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:10,320
and halo. So we'll see what they come up with. That could be very interesting. I'm hoping,

1403
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:14,560
I'm hoping for, uh, the executive producer there to bring some of her guitar,

1404
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:20,160
guitar hero to influence. How about a music based destiny game? I'd be into that.

1405
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:27,840
Uh, I still never got into destiny. So it's, it's not bad. Like, uh, you know,

1406
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:34,320
so I know that's a really whack, uh, recommendation. I don't play a lot of first person shooters. I do

1407
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:38,400
get into halo once in a while. Um, there's obviously, you know, dead by daylight, but

1408
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,920
that's not a shooter, you know, I don't get into a lot of the shooter. Yeah. Yeah. I don't get,

1409
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:47,040
unless you play gunslinger. I don't get into a lot of those. I don't get into a harpoon,

1410
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:51,920
but you know what I mean? I don't get into a lot of those first person shooter games,

1411
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:56,640
but well, I liked overwatch. That's a first person sorta it's, but again, overwatch is

1412
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,960
really different because there's so many, like you, not everybody actually shoots in that game.

1413
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:06,480
If you're playing somebody with a sword or, you know, healing with a, like a Lucio or

1414
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:11,440
was Mass Effect multiplayer third person or first person.

1415
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,600
It was that same over the shoulder that the rest of the game was.

1416
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,600
Okay. Okay. I couldn't remember for a moment, but I was like,

1417
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,960
I was just trying to think yet. Didn't I play other first person? Yeah.

1418
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,680
Yeah. So, Oh yeah, that's true. Sorry. Act says Lucio still shoots. That's right. There's the

1419
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:31,920
little gun that, but I think of the healing bubbles and things, but anyway, you guys know

1420
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:37,040
what I mean? I don't get into a lot of those games, but destiny for one, it's really pretty

1421
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:40,640
now that it's on a series X and I'm sure the PlayStation five version is the same thing.

1422
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:46,320
They're both very pretty. I'm sure. Um, and it's, I like it because it does have the light RPG

1423
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:50,160
elements in it. It doesn't feel like you're just shooty, shooty, bang, bang, kill them all, kill

1424
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:55,120
them all. There's quests to do. There's goals to work towards. There's, I like the idea, the

1425
01:17:55,120 --> 01:18:00,720
concept of raids in a first person shooter, where you're basically going in into an instance thing

1426
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:05,520
with other people and they made it a very PVE experience. I think that's probably the best

1427
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:11,280
accolade I could give destiny is that if you don't like first person shooters because of PVP

1428
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:18,320
elements, destiny did a really good job making a PVE first person game. The PVP stuff is there too,

1429
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:23,360
but the PVE is pretty, pretty top notch in that game. So that's what I would say about destiny.

1430
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:30,800
All right. Anyhow, um, let's, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm loving active salty commentary on

1431
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:37,280
Overwatch. Uh, Brigitte used to heal. Now she does nothing with all those nerves she got. I see.

1432
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:45,440
All right. Uh, moving on, let's get to our next story. Um, oh, this one's an interesting, uh,

1433
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:50,000
game thing, dark soccer, another kind of entry story that I think is interesting.

1434
01:18:50,960 --> 01:19:01,280
For sure. Um, so this actually goes a lot into, um, I would say intellectual property rights.

1435
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:08,720
Um, and indeed I did find this on a report about intellectual property. Um, there is, uh,

1436
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:18,320
argument now on the use of tattoos in video games. Um, there was a, uh, decision that was made

1437
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:24,960
regarding a professional wrestlers tattoos in, um, a video game in one of the, the take to,

1438
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:33,840
uh, WWE 2k, uh, games. So basically, um, the wrestler in question is Randy Orton and he's

1439
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:40,960
got tattoos that were done by Catherine Alexander. Um, she had inked those, uh,

1440
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:50,400
six different ones, um, on him, uh, between 2002 and 2008. Um, so he licensed his likeness,

1441
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:58,640
uh, to be used in the game, but she was arguing that, uh, because her artwork wasn't licensed

1442
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:05,920
to be used in the game, uh, that they had violated, uh, copyright that they had used her,

1443
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:14,400
uh, basically copyright infringement, um, with using unauthorized, uh, uh, artwork with an implied

1444
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:22,480
license. Um, well basically, and that is what take two is, is moved for summary judgment. Um,

1445
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:26,560
again, that they were authorized to use it by an implied license and that they were using it under

1446
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:38,320
fair use. Um, and that, uh, it constitutes a de minimus part of, uh, WWE 2k. Um, so yeah,

1447
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:48,480
they had a big, uh, argument over it, um, in court. Um, so with, um, the implied license,

1448
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:56,080
the court found that two parts of that were satisfied partially due to conflicting testimony

1449
01:20:56,160 --> 01:21:03,520
about agreement to forms, copywriting the tattoo. Um, they ruled that that should be heard by a

1450
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:08,720
jury. Um, the second defense, the four factors that were necessary to establish fair use is that

1451
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:12,400
the purpose and character of the use of the nature of the copyrighted work, the mountain

1452
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:18,080
sustainability of the plaintiff's work and the effect of, uh, of the market of the copyrighted

1453
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:28,160
work. Um, and so basically, uh, they found that take two did not meet the standard, uh,

1454
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:36,800
necessary requirements. And then finally, um, they argued that the, the use of tattoos were,

1455
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:43,200
uh, de de minimus, which, um, what de minimus means, uh, it's actually short for a de minimus

1456
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:48,480
non current Lex, which is the law does not concern itself with trifles, meaning that it

1457
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:54,320
serious. And it is legal term. No, I know it's funny. Yeah. Maybe I should just like,

1458
01:21:54,320 --> 01:22:05,600
have that tattooed on me. Um, anyway, um, so, um, the, uh, they were unsuccessful in arguing that

1459
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:11,200
because it was an open question as to whether the seventh circuit recognized de minimus as a valid

1460
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:18,560
defense. And even so, uh, they couldn't see that take two met the standard. So the court's decision

1461
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:23,520
was to deny the defense's motion for summary judgment effectively, uh, which effectively

1462
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:34,880
means that anyone with a tattoo does not control all use of their likeness. So this is going to be

1463
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:42,800
going to jury. Interesting. You know, and I, I can kind of see it both ways. I really can because,

1464
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:47,040
you know, I, I kind of get like, if it was her original artwork that she, you know,

1465
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:50,880
did specifically for him and now he's out basically reselling it and, you know, having

1466
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:56,480
any games and stuff, then I kind of get that. But at the same time, like the dude's on TV,

1467
01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:01,040
he's a wrestler. I'm sure, you know, a lot of wrestlers end up going to star in movies.

1468
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:05,280
If he's in a movie and that tattoo is visible in the movie, does she get money? I don't think

1469
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:11,280
that's how it works. Yeah. So it's, it's, but it's fascinating to me. I, and I, I feel like

1470
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:16,960
this is something that needs to be established in the tattoo artist who they're tattooing

1471
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:25,280
relationship from the get go. And I think because of this case, you may see like this have

1472
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:30,320
repercussions for anyone who gets a tattoo. I think it could be very interesting. Brought

1473
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:35,200
up a point that I was going to is that I look at it as it's technically commissioned to work.

1474
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:42,720
When like me as a graphic designer, if someone commissioned my work or my services,

1475
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:50,400
you know, Hey, I would like you to design this banner for my website. The moment I have

1476
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:56,400
delivered the artwork, it becomes their property. It is no longer my, I can use my,

1477
01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:01,600
I can use it in my portfolio. You know, I can certainly use it, but I can't put my name on it.

1478
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:13,120
You know, whereas if someone commissioned a painting from me and I painted it, then yeah,

1479
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:19,840
I reckon that would be kind of a gray area. You know, that if they were gonna say film in their

1480
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:28,320
house and my artwork was there, then I may ask for, you know, a little something because

1481
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:32,320
my artwork was seen because as I like to say, artists die of exposure.

1482
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:44,400
But at the same time, you know, I would put this right in the range of commissioned work.

1483
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:48,720
When you make that commission and you part ways with that commission,

1484
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:55,600
that commission is no longer yours. You can put it in your portfolio and tattoo it on other people

1485
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:03,600
unless someone else designed that tattoo that you did. Like for example, if I designed a tattoo

1486
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:09,680
and I went and had someone put it on, you know, put that on my body, they cannot go and put it

1487
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:16,800
on somebody else without paying me for it. That's how it works.

1488
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:21,680
What would you say would happen if this wrestler tried to sell the NFT of his tattoo?

1489
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:23,360
I'm just kidding. Don't answer that. All right.

1490
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:31,600
Oh, I mean, actually, I'll be honest in that case, if he had like a scan of it or something,

1491
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:34,880
uh huh. He can't sell that.

1492
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:42,560
Okay. Yeah. I think this whole thing is legit. Like jokes, cheap jokes about things that are

1493
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:47,440
big in pop culture right now aside, I think it's interesting about the precedent this could

1494
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:53,360
actually set again, like for, you know, um, because there's a lot of tattoo artists who

1495
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:56,880
are going to be looking at this, I'm sure. And probably never thought about that question

1496
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:01,120
because not everyone is necessarily a tattoo artist to the stars, so to speak.

1497
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:04,640
But I'm sure there's a lot of tattoo artists going, what if I did tattoo someone famous,

1498
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:09,120
like what would happen there where everybody's seeing, you know, what I did. So I think it's

1499
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:11,600
going to be very interesting to see what the ramifications of that end up being.

1500
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:18,080
What I see is going to happen actually, is that I think that there are going to be, um,

1501
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:25,040
when you go to be professionally tattooed, that there's going to be, um, a license paperwork

1502
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:29,840
drawn up. You know, and now that I'm sitting here thinking about it, you know, because I always kind

1503
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:33,520
of go like, well, why are games being treated different than movies? And, and as I'm sitting

1504
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,240
here thinking about it, as you're kind of explaining a lot of these things, I think

1505
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:40,560
what it really comes down to is that in a movie or whatever you're filming it in a TV show, you're

1506
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:45,840
filming it, you got a camera at it. And this is a recreation. Bingo. It's a recreation. It's tracing.

1507
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:51,600
You are, you're, you're, you're tracing the tattoo. You know what I mean though? You're basically,

1508
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:59,040
you're recreating it. You're making a copy of it. And that's where the very interesting dilemma lies.

1509
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:06,640
But it could also be considered derivative work. Yeah. You know, there's also other things under,

1510
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:11,440
I think another, they wouldn't have a creative common license on it, but there are like other

1511
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:21,920
rules, like having something be more than 50% changed in artwork, for example. Um, but I,

1512
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:29,520
I could imagine being a tattoo artist who wants their name out there better, who wants their

1513
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:35,760
work protected. I understand it from the artist's point of view, certainly as an artist myself,

1514
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:44,960
but I also understand that when the product has left my hand, it belongs to the body that

1515
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:50,640
it's on. It doesn't belong off of that body. They can't recreate it themselves to sell it.

1516
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:56,240
And so that's, I think, where that murky ground is. I think that I wouldn't be,

1517
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:01,840
I don't know. Yeah. Um, let me get some other comments. That is a little bit murky.

1518
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:06,720
See a Tiberian chat says, has a tattoo artist done other celebrities? Well, I'm sure there's

1519
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:11,120
plenty of celebrities that have had tattoos. Um, has this person also run into other issues

1520
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:15,760
before? I think what's happening here is that this is a case where the realism of video games

1521
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:18,880
is starting to bring up these issues. You know, think about this is a relatively new

1522
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:24,960
This is a relatively newer thing because when we were recreating wrestlers on the Nintendo,

1523
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:29,600
on the Super Nintendo, hell, even the PlayStation and kind of the PlayStation 2,

1524
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:36,640
the graphical fidelity to recreate the tattoos with such precision and such specificity or

1525
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:43,040
whatever specificness didn't, didn't really exist. The tattoo was a pixel. Precision. That's

1526
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:47,760
a good way to put it. Thank you. Now that we're talking about PlayStation 4 and 5 and lifelike

1527
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:53,280
stuff, I think this, this is why this is coming up now for the first time. It's just interesting.

1528
01:28:55,120 --> 01:29:00,880
Act Defton chat says, let's say that if it were like all the fan made work you see at

1529
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:05,920
artists alleys and conventions, we know it's not legal, but we just ignore it and support the

1530
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:11,920
artist. That is very true. Um, that is, well, and here's the thing you have to keep in mind with all

1531
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:16,400
that. If you, if that's your business, you know, cool. And yes, we want to support artists and all

1532
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:22,320
that stuff. Um, but you have to realize if Blizzard wanted to shut down your Overwatch art,

1533
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:27,280
if, or your Warcraft art, or if, um, you know, whatever it is, whatever your fandom is,

1534
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:33,520
if they wanted to come in and shut that down, they can. So in a sense, you're living on borrowed time

1535
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:36,880
whenever you're incorporating someone else's trademark or copyright, you're right. Most

1536
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:41,520
companies let it slip under the radar because it's just, it's, it's too expensive to chase.

1537
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:46,960
It doesn't make them look good. This is a case where for the bigger companies exposure, you know,

1538
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:52,720
would Overwatch be able to do something like the Overwatch league without the huge fandom that it

1539
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:58,800
has. And what's a part of that fandom fan art, right? So I think these companies very carefully

1540
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:03,200
have to weigh something like that, but look at a company like Disney to Disney's incredibly,

1541
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:08,400
incredibly litigious, but usually if it's something, you know, under the table, again,

1542
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:13,600
they're not going to go after a lot of, uh, uh, personal creators and stuff, but they might,

1543
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:17,920
and you kind of always have to live with that in the back of your mind, just like most of us that

1544
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:22,400
stream on Twitch, you know, what we do here at VOG is a little different because it's pretty much,

1545
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:26,960
you know, it's us on camera and all that stuff, but there may come a day for, for things like,

1546
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:31,120
let's say dark soccer streaming dead by daylight. There may come a day where behavior comes in and

1547
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:36,880
says, you know what? We want the money. And that's, that's a whole, and that thing's been bubbling

1548
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:41,920
under for a long time, by the way, that specific example, I believe behavior has openly said,

1549
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:47,120
we don't care if you stream it, you know, in that whole thing. But my example of we're living on

1550
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:55,840
borrowed time and all that is I think still relevant. So anyway, um, Amethyst Rose, which

1551
01:30:55,840 --> 01:31:03,120
points out fan art is to a point free advertising. Yeah. Yes. But it is, we are kind of saying,

1552
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:08,720
as I said, it's, it's exposure, but it's, it's the inverse because it's now you're trying to

1553
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:13,360
support the indie artist, but the big company, they're not going to miss it type of thing.

1554
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:18,880
So it's, it's, it's interesting. And I want to be clear. I've bought fan art at stuff. I,

1555
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:24,720
I like it as gifts. Like when, um, when Alan was super into Overwatch, I bought him some posters.

1556
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:29,600
I think I picked him up at magfest actually that I thought were really cute. Um, and so, you know,

1557
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:33,120
I, I love fan art and stuff. I don't want to see that change, but I'm just saying

1558
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:37,840
these sorts of legal questions. It kind of brings up all these questions about

1559
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:44,880
we might be on borrowed time y'all. Anyway, let's move on to something a little more timeless and

1560
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:51,120
talk about retro consoles. Loki. Yeah, this is pretty cool. So, uh, Evercade has been around

1561
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:56,560
for a while. It's like this handheld device that plays these cartridges with collections of

1562
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:01,040
different retro games. And some indie games, actually, they actually have one that has a

1563
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:06,480
bunch of nest maker, any S games in there. So it's pretty cool to kind of, it covers everything.

1564
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:12,720
Well, now they're actually doing this new system called the Evercade vs, which is going to be

1565
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:17,440
basically taking this portable console and making it into like a home console.

1566
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:22,320
So the difference here is that there's going to be two cartridge slots. So now you can have two

1567
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:27,040
different cartridges loaded in at a time to select games from they're going to have support

1568
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:34,640
up to four controllers and, um, also wifi and 10 AP support as well for your TV. And it's supposed

1569
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:40,160
to be coming out later this year to around November for, I think a hundred dollars, not

1570
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:44,160
certain about the price on that. Uh, yeah, a hundred dollars. So that's actually about the

1571
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:49,040
same price as their handheld was with a few games thrown in, but it's pretty cool. They've got like

1572
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:56,640
lots of collections from like Atari and Amco, Data East, all sorts of things. So, um, it's

1573
01:32:56,640 --> 01:33:00,720
interesting. I don't know if I'm picking it up, but it's definitely, you know, along the lines of

1574
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:07,680
like, if you're, you know, looking at console, say kind of like the Amico or something like that,

1575
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:12,160
that's playing, you know, more of this couch co-op stuff. You're going to get a lot of that

1576
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:18,080
from the Evercade as well. Hmm. That's uh, it sounds like a lot of fun. I like the,

1577
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:22,240
I like the homebrew stuff kind of built into it a little bit there. Loki, is that a way to get more

1578
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:26,640
copies of a pixel poops out there? You got to get team up one of these consoles. Totally do that.

1579
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:32,480
If they wanted to put it on one of those things. I know for example, there's a one cartridge that

1580
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:40,560
has, it does have a few different, um, NES home brew stuff. So there's a flea. I know it's one of

1581
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:45,440
the games that's made with nest maker. That's in there. There's also the, I'm trying to think of

1582
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:51,120
the name now. I have it on itch too. Um, it's basically with a doodle world is another one

1583
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:55,360
that they have on there. And I think there was a couple other NES maker games that were part of

1584
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:59,120
that. And it was, uh, the, I'm trying to think of the actual collection. It's like something

1585
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:04,000
Indies collection that they had, but, um, there's like four games on one cartridge. That's pretty

1586
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:10,800
cool. So yeah, I mean, sure. I will put it on one of those collections in a heartbeat.

1587
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:15,280
The question, I don't think anyone's going to ask for that. I was going to say there's

1588
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:19,440
probably as many people listening to this podcast as bought your game. So, uh, don't

1589
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:23,600
hold your breath that Evercade is listening. Yeah, I'm not holding any breath whatsoever,

1590
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:29,200
but like, yeah, absolutely. We love all 12 of you who listen. We really do hugs and kisses.

1591
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:33,920
All right. Um, pixel pocket is talking about Evercade and chat saying the Evercade portable

1592
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:39,040
is pretty fun. I like that their carts always come with five games minimum. There's a mega cat

1593
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:44,320
studios cart that has various home brew games. There's also like indie heroes collection.

1594
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:48,960
I think that does sound pretty good. I think we reported on this one that they had. Yeah.

1595
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:51,920
I think we reported this on this once and I kind of, it kind of fell off my radar,

1596
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:56,800
but I think that I love that concept of we're still making cartridges in a new way with the

1597
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:01,520
retro stuff. I think that's pretty rad actually. Yeah. And then they've got all sorts of like

1598
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:06,400
things in there. There's, um, I'm trying to see the one that they had to actually had all those

1599
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:10,800
cool, uh, home brew games. So I think it was, yeah, it was the indie heroes one. So that's

1600
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:17,440
the one that has flea. Uh, I believe doodle world's in there. Um, I don't recognize the

1601
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:22,400
other games, but I know there's like at least three or four, uh, nest maker games in there.

1602
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:28,320
Plus they've got a collection from code masters. Uh, the Atari link stuff is in there. Um,

1603
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:36,080
lots of cool stuff. So yeah, I, I, they have like, I think like 280 games on the system right now.

1604
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:42,320
So it's, it's definitely, um, interesting. Okay, cool. All right. Uh, let's move on.

1605
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:46,160
We've talked about blizzard a lot. Maybe they've been on my mind because I knew this story was

1606
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:51,440
coming and this has to do with a pretty big personality over at blizzard leaving the company.

1607
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:55,360
Uh, this is not the first time we've had a story like this in the past few months, uh,

1608
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:59,440
when it comes to blizzard. However, uh, Jeff Kaplan, who is a very well known, if you,

1609
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:02,880
if you've seen his face, you probably go, Oh, that's the guy that is always talking about

1610
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:07,440
overwatch. Well, yes, it's because he is the director of overwatch. He's been with blizzard

1611
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:12,400
for almost two decades. That's 19 years. Uh, and he announced this week he is leaving blizzard

1612
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:16,480
saying, quote, it was truly the honor of a lifetime to have the opportunity to create

1613
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:20,960
worlds and heroes for such a passionate audience. Uh, if you want to read his full goodbye note,

1614
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:27,120
it is available at play over watch.com. Uh, Aaron Keller will be taking over for Jeff Kaplan.

1615
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:31,440
He is also been with blizzard for quite a long time. Uh, they both worked on world of

1616
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:36,000
warcraft prior. Uh, and in a statement, Aaron Keller said, Jeff's been a great leader, mentor,

1617
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,920
and friend, and he knows how much we're going to miss him. I've been lucky to work alongside him

1618
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:43,920
and the rest of the overwatch team for many years in building something that continues to inspire

1619
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:49,040
people all around the world. And I'm honored to carry the torch for forward. Um, of course,

1620
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:54,400
some folks in the overwatch community expressing some concern because you know, overwatch to

1621
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:59,440
overwatch itself, hasn't had a lot of updates recently, um, because you know,

1622
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:03,680
they're prepping for number two and they've already done a lot of, uh, uh, updates to the

1623
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:09,600
base game. Uh, but overwatch two, we know is not coming out in 2021. And so obviously this timing

1624
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:14,640
is a little bit, um, concerning to some people. I don't know so much about that because Diablo

1625
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:17,760
three went through so many, I think they went through like three different directors and that

1626
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:22,320
game still clunking along and doing fine. And Diablo four is, you know, in a good place too.

1627
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:27,920
Um, I think the perception of what's happening with this news is just up there goes another

1628
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:32,880
Blizzard exec abandoning ship. You know, what the fuck's going on? Activision Blizzard,

1629
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:39,040
Activision's ruined the company. There's another one. And the reality is this could be a lot of

1630
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:43,200
things. And Bobby went into some good detail on his show tonight. So I'll give him a shout out

1631
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:48,000
and a plug, uh, for Bobby Black Wolf, our pal over there in his show. And he went into depth

1632
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,160
kind of talking about, you know what, this whole COVID thing that a lot of us have been going

1633
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:57,840
through have made us reevaluate a lot of things. And one of those big things is where I'm working

1634
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:04,240
maybe I want to change that up a little bit. Maybe I'm taking up a new skill while I'm on furlough or

1635
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:08,560
layoff from my job. And now I want to use that skill to get a better job. And, you know,

1636
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:12,160
different types of companies are hiring and so on and so on. I'm not going to repeat what he said

1637
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:17,360
too much, but the more the, the point of that is we don't know what this guy's plans are

1638
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:23,600
professionally. And you know what, after you've been at a company for 19 years to want to change

1639
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:32,640
it up a little bit is not that unusual, but again, that perception is there. All of these

1640
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:37,840
people that have been leaving Blizzard recently were there a very long time. And you would imagine

1641
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:44,000
we're very happy, but now here's another one that's gone. So I think a lot of the tea leaves

1642
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:52,720
on that will come out in what does he do next? If he goes to another company and starts working on

1643
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:58,400
an Overwatch-like game, that's probably a pretty telltale sign something was wrong at Blizzard.

1644
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:04,880
But if the dude decides to take a year off to be with his family and go on a nice big vacation,

1645
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:10,080
which he is absolutely fucking earned, I'm sure, and I don't even follow Overwatch that closely,

1646
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:15,280
as much as many other people do, then I think that will maybe read a different way. Or if he's

1647
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:21,280
decided, you know what, after 20 years in the video game industry, I want to paint. Go off,

1648
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:28,880
do it, paint. Great. I want to make children's playgrounds. Actually, we say that tongue in

1649
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:36,480
cheek, but brilliant example. Why not? Exactly. Yeah. Anyhow, let's see. ActDeft is saying,

1650
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:41,120
many people are speculating he's going to Riot to work on one of their projects. Well,

1651
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:47,200
that's a little bit fan wanky, but we have seen Blizzard people go to Riot. I remember

1652
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:52,160
GhostCrawler, the big community person, had gone to Riot, and there's been others too. So

1653
01:39:52,960 --> 01:40:02,000
anything's possible, but I wouldn't put too much stock in those sorts of reports yet. Let's see,

1654
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:08,320
VGRealness saying, probably gone to Dreamhaven, like the rest who left. Or was that the same

1655
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:14,000
studio that Chris Metzen is doing his D&D thing with? Because that one is interesting,

1656
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,400
because it's not a video game. It's a very, you know, a D&D campaign type thing is a very story

1657
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:22,720
heavy type of thing. But that's kind of like what Chris Metzen kind of did at Blizzard. He was very

1658
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:32,080
involved in the story of World of Warcraft. So it's interesting, I think. Anyway. Questbuster

1659
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:37,120
in chat says, 20 years is a lot of life investment in a company and perhaps he's simply looking to do

1660
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:41,760
something new on his own. Take a break, bake a cake, whatever else it might be. A lot of

1661
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:46,560
veteran devs in the past few years have left AAA studios to either take sabbaticals or even found

1662
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:51,520
smaller teams to find the spark they missed in working with large ones. I think a really good

1663
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:58,000
parallel in that regard is Reggie Fils-Aime. He probably didn't need to leave Nintendo. Like,

1664
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,840
you know what I mean? Like, like he probably, he was doing a great job there. People love him,

1665
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:09,680
but he just decided, this is my time. And I want to go be with the family and stuff. And maybe I'll

1666
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:14,640
take on a little advisory role that lasts for nine months over a year, or I'll do another little

1667
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:20,080
thing over a year, you know, and that's, that's what he wants to do. And he's earned it. I think

1668
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:23,760
it's, you know, it's, it's, it's a little tough for the Overwatch community because Jeff Kaplan

1669
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:30,240
is such the face for Overwatch and so much so that he's participated in gags, you know, like the,

1670
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:35,040
the Yule Log Christmas, whatever that old joke was. I think he sat in front of a fireplace for

1671
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:39,600
like six hours on a Twitch stream or whatever the hell he was doing. We don't know this new

1672
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:44,480
guy as much, you know, and there's always, there's always that, you know, what's the new,

1673
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:50,400
is this new? What's, I don't like new. I liked old. I already dislike new. We don't know what

1674
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:54,240
this new person's going to bring to the table. I'm sure we've seen him before at panels and,

1675
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:58,400
you know, other things, but he's just not so much the face. So it'll be interesting to see,

1676
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:03,040
you know, how, how that all works out, but I'm sure the guy will do fine. He's been with Blizzard

1677
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:12,320
a very long time as well. So let's see. Amethyst Rose Witch says, hell, 10 years is a lot. I know

1678
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:17,920
I'm reevaluating. I think they say something like it's, it's kind of average to want to change that

1679
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:21,680
up every 10 years or so. I don't remember the exact number. Don't quote me on that.

1680
01:42:21,680 --> 01:42:26,560
But yeah, I know people that change. It seems, I know this one person I used to work with. I feel

1681
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:32,160
like she changes every year, but you know what, if, if you could do it and you're successful at it,

1682
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:38,320
one, and you're happy, it ain't my place to tell you what to do. Okay. VG realness says every seven

1683
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:42,720
years is the average. Okay. I, I, and I thought I remember reading something like that somewhere.

1684
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:47,040
And I think, don't they also say like in your life, you kind of go through big changes every

1685
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:55,040
seven years. Yeah. And here I am by the way, sitting at 42, which is, which is seven times

1686
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:59,760
six, by the way. And we're looking at finally buying a house after all these years, which is

1687
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:03,840
a pretty big change of sorts. And I'm sure there'll be other stuff as well. So anyway,

1688
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:11,680
maybe there's something to that. I don't know. All right. But the more things change, the more we

1689
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:16,720
appreciate the classics. And that's why we have this segment called the classic game of the week,

1690
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:22,000
where every week dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,

1691
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:28,320
Hey, you guys should be checking out this classic or actually what really happens in this segment

1692
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:32,160
sometimes. Cause I think that's, what's going to happen to us tonight is that sometimes it's like

1693
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:37,520
that meme that you've seen online, what you thought final fantasy was 20 years ago, where

1694
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:43,360
it shows the retro final fantasy. And then what final fantasy really was 20 years ago. And then

1695
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:48,960
you see the picture of final fantasy 10 on the PlayStation two with, you know, all it's a great

1696
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:54,720
graphics and everything. Um, because the criteria that dark soccer created, cause you know, she

1697
01:43:54,720 --> 01:44:00,320
writes the rules is that a game has to be 10 years old or more to be a classic game of the week.

1698
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:05,120
And this is definitely one of those games when, when I was, you know, cause you know, I I'm,

1699
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:08,960
I'm special. I get to see what she picked in advance. And when I saw it, I was like,

1700
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:13,200
Oh my God, this is 10 years old. Really? And I had a final fantasy just for that reason.

1701
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:19,120
I had a final fantasy meme moment. It's a good one, but y'all get ready to feel old.

1702
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:25,600
I'm going to warn you. All right. Dark soccer. No, my pain. What are you going to, uh, what are

1703
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:34,480
you going to make the audience cry with tonight? The classic game of the week came out in 2011

1704
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:45,040
and it's called limbo. Yes. Limbo. Um, it is a very beautiful stylized puzzle platform

1705
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:50,640
game that was developed by an independent studio called play dead. It was released actually in July

1706
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:57,520
2010 on Xbox live arcade and has been ported around to other systems, including PS3, Linux

1707
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:03,040
and windows. It is a 2d site, huh? I'm sorry. I hate to interrupt, but you need to, I felt you

1708
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:08,240
could celebrate in some of the tears that you're causing in chat. You ready? We have, wow. I feel

1709
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:15,760
old. Wow. I'm so old. When we was a weave log show. Good Lord. This is that old limbo is eligible.

1710
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:22,960
Fuck. So there you go. There you go. Dark soccer. Enjoy your cup of chat room tears.

1711
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:34,080
Ah, refreshing here. Mm. Delightful. And podcasts, uh, podcast listeners,

1712
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:39,440
we don't want you to be left out. Please send those tears to our Twitter account at OLR,

1713
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:42,880
uh, send them directly to dark soccer, water, my green onions.

1714
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:54,160
All right. And anyhow, so yes, the game is, uh, limbo. And as I was saying, it's presented in

1715
01:45:54,160 --> 01:46:01,120
black and white tones, uh, kind of gray scale. And it uses, uh, lighting and film grain effects

1716
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:09,760
and very minimal ambient sounds to create this atmosphere of, of almost hopelessness kind of,

1717
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:17,600
kind of scary. Um, it's very dark. It's even been, uh, compared to old film noir in German

1718
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:27,200
expressionism, which I totally get that vibe out of it. Um, it is, it's also been toted as one of,

1719
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:33,840
as an example of video games as an art form, very positive reviews, um, minimalized story

1720
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:40,160
that kind of split people, but otherwise it's been just considered one of the greatest games

1721
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:49,360
of all time. Um, it was also the third highest selling game on Xbox live arcade in 2010. Um,

1722
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:56,160
and as one, uh, several industry awards. So, um, to go forward into this. So basically you play

1723
01:46:56,160 --> 01:47:04,080
a little boy and you have to navigate him through his dark, eerie world. Um, sorry,

1724
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:12,400
the cat was chatting about this in the background. Um, so you have to solve these puzzles

1725
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:18,560
to kind of get through. So you have hazards like glowing worms that will attach themselves to your

1726
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:23,360
head and force you to travel in one direction until they're killed. You also have the mechanical

1727
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:29,200
puzzles where you deal with machinery, electromagnets and gravity. Um, you don't

1728
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:35,760
notice the traps though until they kill you. And so you restart from your last checkpoint. Um,

1729
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:40,400
and you just can keep starting over as far as you go. It's basically a trial and death game

1730
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:47,680
and you can die with dismemberment or beheading or some gore. Um, you know, there are some,

1731
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:54,800
there's an optional gore filter if you don't want to see it. Um, but yeah, there's carcasses

1732
01:47:54,800 --> 01:48:01,440
and bear traps and all kinds of stuff. Um, so basically the story of this is that you're this

1733
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:10,400
boy who wakes up in a forest on the edge of hell. Um, and you encounter a giant spider who tries to

1734
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:17,120
kill you. And then after you cut off the sharp points of, of his legs, then you continue through

1735
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:26,720
the story. Um, and then, uh, I'm not going to spoil the ending. Get off of there.

1736
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:34,240
You all right over there? My cat was on my art table.

1737
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:38,880
Well, your cat was also feeling old. Thanks to this selection. Just letting you know.

1738
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,040
And it's my fault for leaving the door open. You are a bad girl out.

1739
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:54,080
Out. She's going to the closed door to leave like great cat. Anyway. Um, it was, uh, conceived as

1740
01:48:54,080 --> 01:49:02,400
a game around 2004 with some concept art, um, from, uh, the designer is at IO interactive.

1741
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:11,040
Um, he had, as he said, a mood image of a secret place to get ideas. Um, and he expanded upon it.

1742
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:17,280
He tried to make his own game and visual basic, but he needed a lot more, uh, assistance with it.

1743
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:24,080
So he made an art style trailer in 2006 and tried to recruit people. Um, but he had just two people

1744
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:31,360
to start with. So that led to the creation of play dead and they attracted more people and the game

1745
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:41,760
has gone on to be beautiful. Um, the ESRB listed entries for, for PS3 and windows, but it was a

1746
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:48,000
mistake on their part first. They didn't have any intention of bringing it out. Um, but then, uh,

1747
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:56,400
eventually, you know, things happened. Um, they did, they actually didn't want to release on

1748
01:49:56,400 --> 01:50:00,640
windows because of software piracy. Something they were very worried about.

1749
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:05,440
But then again, I guess once they've made their money, you know, limbo.

1750
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:11,920
It also out on steam also something, one thing we have to remember about PC games. Um, and by the

1751
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:16,560
way, if you don't like spiders, avert your eyes for a little bit because, um, the next part of

1752
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:21,520
this game for people who don't like spiders is very, um, rough visually. So I'm going to let it

1753
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:26,000
keep playing, but I'm going to warn you if you don't like spiders, don't watch just avert your

1754
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:32,080
eyes for a little bit. I'll tell you when it's safe again. Um, and, uh, um, I, I got sidetracked.

1755
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:42,560
I'm sorry. I was going to say, um, uh, spiders now before that PC. Oh yes. PC. Thank you.

1756
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:48,640
It opens things up to a much larger audience because the PS3 is only officially available

1757
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:52,480
in so many places in the world. And I think that's one thing we often forget with PC gaming

1758
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:58,000
is that by putting out a game in P on PC, you can get to a lot of countries where console gaming is

1759
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:04,640
not readily accessible. That makes sense. Yeah. So, but there are different versions of the game.

1760
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:15,600
Of course, there is a Mac OS version, um, through the Mac app store. Um, there, uh, sorry. Um,

1761
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:23,600
uh, as I said, there's a Mac OS version. There is a Linux version that plays in a wine, uh,

1762
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:32,080
environment, which is a, uh, sort of a windows virtualization. Um, there was a Vita version,

1763
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:38,880
um, but it doesn't use the touch pad. Um, there's an iOS version. Um, there's all kinds of versions

1764
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:52,480
out there. Um, and it's just really, really just a, a good game. Um, I, I really,

1765
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:58,560
really cannot stress, uh, enough about how beautiful the music, the minimalized music,

1766
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:05,360
uh, audio and the visuals are in this one. I mean, as you can see, um, but the audio was created by,

1767
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:13,520
Martin Stig Anderson, who was a graduate in Royal Academy of Music. Um, and so his specialty being,

1768
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:23,280
um, uh, cosmetic music, which is sort of non traditional from created from generated sounds.

1769
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:28,640
They don't seem to have any particular source, um, is it came in and it blends in quite beautifully

1770
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:36,160
with this, uh, background. Um, but yeah, uh, it got great receptions, very, very highly rated

1771
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:44,400
across the board. And, you know, it's just, it's really, I can't really say too much more good

1772
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:49,440
about it. It really is excellent. And it's, it's really that, that artistic style and the look of

1773
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:55,200
this game. Um, and she whole can chat says it's a great game and sound. Yeah. And I think that that

1774
01:52:55,200 --> 01:53:01,520
unique style, when this came out, we weren't seeing a lot of games that really looked like,

1775
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:05,680
like such a unique style like this, you know what I mean? And I think that's what makes this game

1776
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:09,840
very special, even though, like I just said, and I warned y'all that scene that just played out

1777
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:14,400
with the spider. Um, that's literally my worst nightmare coming to life. Um, so anyway, I'm

1778
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:19,760
going to turn the game footage. The spider is very scary. I did you see, he picked the guy up and

1779
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:24,000
wrapped it. I think it's super, I mean, it's not, it's not violent or gory at least, but that, no,

1780
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:29,440
I'm, I'm, that is like literally one of my worst nightmares playing out. Yeah, but, but he's free

1781
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:33,600
of, of the stuff. He is now happy ending, I suppose. All right. Except for that little piece.

1782
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:37,040
I just love that scene though, where like you see his eyes and he's lying on the ground,

1783
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:42,240
staring at the camera, like what even is my life? Yeah. All right. I'm going to go back. That's,

1784
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:47,600
that's me. I am that little boy right now. All right. There is your classic game of the week.

1785
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:53,600
Limbo. Yes. It's 10 years old and you are 10 years older as a result. Congratulations.

1786
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:59,840
All right. Great pick. Jamie really is. All right. Thank you. I mean, I'm if when you do a bad pick,

1787
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:05,600
I'm just not going to tell you, no, I'm kidding. There's no such thing. No, you have done bad

1788
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:12,000
picks, but you've said, I don't always pick a good one. I do it on purpose. Yeah. So they're

1789
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:17,440
not always good, but even the bad ones are still classics and you should know about them so that

1790
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:22,400
you avoid them. Like they're classic in their own way. You know, show are just classically bad.

1791
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:29,520
Showgirls is classic cinema. Pink flamingos is classic cinema, but there, there are reasons for

1792
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:35,360
the hell Rocky horror picture show, honestly is not that great of a movie, but the experience,

1793
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:40,960
the music, the, the Tim Curry, the, and all of this stuff adds up to like this, you got to see

1794
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:46,720
it type of thing, right? Honestly, it is a better stage play than it is a movie. Yes. But, Oh, by the

1795
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:53,120
way, I have seen the stage play several times now. Was it rest in peace, um, just passed away this

1796
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:57,760
week that was involved with all the meatloaf songs. And I believe played the character and

1797
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:05,680
fan of the paradise, which is another huge, uh, is it Jim Steinman? Please don't. I know his face

1798
01:55:05,680 --> 01:55:11,840
is a very distinctive look, but I don't remember the name. Somebody I'm waiting for chat to shout

1799
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:16,400
it out. Okay. See it to very things. I'm Jim Steinman. Was it? No, but no,

1800
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:21,360
William Finley was 2012. It was, uh, it was Jim Steinman. Okay. That's what I thought. Okay.

1801
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:27,120
Whew. I got that. Right. All right. Anyway. Um, so yeah, rest in peace because the paradise is

1802
01:55:27,120 --> 01:55:32,320
fucking weird. Oh, that movie just Jessica Harper is such, it's like one of those actresses where

1803
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:38,960
if it's like, if you know her, it's like, you're in this secret society of people who know who she

1804
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:44,080
is and why she's awesome. Like that whole thing. So anyway, I still need to, to this day, I still

1805
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:51,920
need to see Suspiria, which is like one of her all time, like biggest roles. I actually have seen

1806
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:57,280
the remake of Suspiria. Oh, okay. And I have the original of Suspiria. If you want to come

1807
01:55:57,280 --> 01:56:03,280
over and watch it with me, I really enjoyed the remake. Oh my God. That'll be a fun VAX thing.

1808
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:06,400
Like now that we're both VAX, we're going to watch movies together. That'll be fun.

1809
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:11,600
Yeah. I have to, I have to say though, I need, I want someone to watch Suspiria with me because the,

1810
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:18,240
the remake of it was really good. It had Tilda Swanson in it too. Um, but I really,

1811
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:23,840
yeah. And I know that Jessica Harper was in the remake very briefly, but, um, but I need,

1812
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:28,240
She writes children's books now. And so she's been kind of like, she even has her own podcast.

1813
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:32,880
Uh, I may be a limited edition or whatever, but she wrote a book recently and she was doing like

1814
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:37,040
tours and she's, she didn't do conventions for a long time, but she's one of those people who's

1815
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:40,720
really opened up over the years and does convention, or at least, you know, pre COVID

1816
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:44,480
was starting to do more conventions and kind of open up about her past and all that stuff.

1817
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:49,040
Pretty approachable. Yeah. I kept trying to get them like little, little inside baseball,

1818
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:53,360
but you know, they do that convention here in Sacramento and I'm, I'm in the ear of the person

1819
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:57,840
who runs it. And I've been, I've been saying for years, get Jessica Harper, get Jessica Harper,

1820
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:04,720
get Jessica Harper. One of the, one of these years it'll work. So, all right. I mean, why not?

1821
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:08,000
They got, they got Barry Boswith. They got Patricia Quinn. They got, they've gotten a

1822
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,600
lot of good people and I'm like, please get Jessica Harper. That's like, who's on your

1823
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:18,160
wishlist? Rob Jessica Harper. All right. Anyhow, uh, this is not the Jessica Harper podcast,

1824
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:22,160
unfortunately, but, uh, and if you have no idea who we're talking about, you really should educate

1825
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:26,560
yourself. Like honestly, like you get joint, join the secret society of fans. Uh, we're,

1826
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:31,440
we're small and loyal. All right. Uh, let's move on to some rapid fire news where we talk about

1827
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:36,560
the video game industry, not the movie industry really quick. Uh, let's do it. Uh, Loki, why don't

1828
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:44,960
you start us off? All right. So, um, this is pretty cool. So on the 10th birthday of Portal 2,

1829
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:51,520
yes, now it's eligible for classic game of the week. Um, there's been a fan release,

1830
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:58,320
a mod called portal reloaded, which adds a third color portal to the gun. Uh, it's a green one.

1831
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:04,160
It actually allows time travel. So that's even more of a mind bender now. So you can go check

1832
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:11,360
that out. Um, looks pretty cool. I always like these portal fan games. Uh, speaking of fan

1833
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:17,680
additions for games, um, mother three has had a brand new English translation by the fans as well

1834
01:58:17,680 --> 01:58:24,240
on its 15th anniversary. So that's also available if you're a fan of mother three.

1835
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:29,760
Which, um, is a game I really still need to play. Start to finish. I've played a little

1836
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:33,680
bit of that translation patch, but I can't believe that game is 15 years old and still nothing.

1837
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:41,120
And even Reggie fees and may is joking about it now. Like how dare you? Although obviously

1838
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:45,600
this was a decision above his head, I'm sure, you know, even though he's the face of Nintendo,

1839
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:49,760
you know, in America to many of us, even still with Doug Bowser there, I mean, even still,

1840
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:54,080
um, obviously we know that Japan calls a lot of the shots with that stuff. So, um,

1841
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:58,960
one of these days, one of these days, all right. Uh, dark soccer, what do you have for us?

1842
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:05,680
A couple of things. Um, there are, uh, there's rumors that, uh,

1843
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:11,920
Sony and Konami are in discussions to do a new Castlevania game on the PlayStation five.

1844
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:19,760
Um, it came from a leaker called catharsis T. Just saying that they've been talking about it

1845
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:25,360
and that they also were having new projects related to metal gear, solid and silent Hill

1846
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:32,080
in the works. Um, but of course, rumor speculation, we don't know. Um, but, uh,

1847
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:37,040
apparently this person has been correct before. So yeah. And, and we're getting a new silent Hill

1848
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:41,520
too. Remember those rumors? So I don't know. It's like, I want to see the receipts,

1849
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:46,960
but I understand this is it's what gaming culture is talking about. So we, we do indulge the rumors

1850
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:53,040
sometimes. And I think we'd all love to see it. I think we'd all be loved to play a new Castlevania

1851
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:58,480
game, but in the meantime, we have bloodstain. It's not bad at all. Yeah. Well, for those of us

1852
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:04,800
though, who have already been enjoying Capcom arcade stadium on our switches. Well, the rest

1853
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:14,240
of you guys get it too. So, um, it will be available on PS4, Xbox one and PC on, on May 25th.

1854
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:22,320
Um, and you can, uh, you get 1943, the battle of Midway for free. Um, you will also get some

1855
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:29,520
add on packs. Um, there is Dawn of the arcade pack, um, which is 1984 to 1988 arcade revolution,

1856
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:38,880
which is 1989 to 1982, and then arcade evolution, 1992 to 2001. So, uh, in that last pack,

1857
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:44,480
that's where we have 1944, the loop master, uh, street fighter, two hyper fighting edition,

1858
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:49,040
street fighter, two turbo. That second pack is where we get, um, street fighter to the world

1859
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:54,880
warriors, captain commando, Strider and final fight, which is honestly, that's the best pack

1860
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:59,200
to get in my opinion. Yeah. I bought them all on. So I'm actually kind of irritated too, cause I

1861
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:02,480
would have probably bought it on a different system if I knew, but it's all right. Switch

1862
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:11,920
of these games though on like the Sega Saturn Capcom packs. Yeah. So, but I don't know. It's

1863
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:17,840
kind of, kind of fun to have them again. Giga wing is certainly, uh, a good one. Cause unless

1864
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:21,600
you have a dream cast, I don't think Giga wing didn't really come out on anything else. I don't

1865
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:26,240
think it did. They, they, they, the, the stadium is good because it does have deep cuts. I'd call

1866
02:01:26,240 --> 02:01:30,320
that like a deep cut and they do have some really good deep cuts in there. Um, and they do, you

1867
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:33,600
know, they do stuff that the technology wasn't there for with those earlier packs. Like, you

1868
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:38,400
know, a little bit of the online competition achievements, weekly things, you know, that you

1869
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:43,840
get more skins and cosmetics for doing. I think, I think it's a well done pack and I hope they expand

1870
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:48,400
on it with more games. Actually. I would love to see that if possible. Uh, I'd love to see things

1871
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:51,680
like puzzle fighter in there, but I don't know if they'd actually do it when they could probably

1872
02:01:51,680 --> 02:01:55,600
release that as a standalone game, but you could say the same thing about street fighter. And

1873
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:59,520
that's still in there. So, or street fighter two, excuse me, but you know what I meant.

1874
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:04,560
So it'd be very interesting to see. All right. Uh, let's travel around the world and check out

1875
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:09,120
some release dates, things that we'll be playing a little sooner than Capcom arcade on our PlayStation

1876
02:02:09,120 --> 02:02:13,280
four. Although I guess not too much of a wait. Uh, it's only about a month, but what do we get

1877
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:21,040
to play next week? Loki? Uh, we've got death and requests on Nintendo switch, uh, Genshin impact on

1878
02:02:21,120 --> 02:02:30,800
PlayStation five to hell with it on PC, uh, final two, uh, that's on Nintendo switch,

1879
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:37,200
PlayStation four X-Box one X-Box series X, uh, total war Rome remastered on PC, Mac, and Linux.

1880
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:44,800
Um, this is exciting new Pokemon snap on Nintendo switch. Oh, that's right. That's the sweet,

1881
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:52,720
yeah. Uh, returnal on PlayStation five. Oh, I wanted to see that. I hope my friends stream that

1882
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:59,600
also apparently our type final two is coming out again on, um, PlayStation four X-Box one

1883
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:04,720
X-Box series X and PC. I don't know why it's coming out twice in the week, but whatever,

1884
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:11,520
uh, maybe, I don't know. Um, there's a footnote and I don't want to read it.

1885
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:17,920
Uh, let's see. Oh, nobody does. I got it. So, so it's coming out slightly earlier in the week

1886
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:23,680
for Japan, North America is getting it later in the week, whatever, uh, terminate resistance

1887
02:03:23,680 --> 02:03:32,400
enhanced on PlayStation five. And that's it. I need to, I need to recruit Shane for a Pokemon

1888
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:36,800
snap stream of sort. Cause I believe I think, didn't he say he's never played the original?

1889
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:40,960
Like I thought that was a thing that came up. I did not have played the original. I don't

1890
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:46,720
remember if you're listening, Shane, will you correct me or whatever, but I'm almost positive.

1891
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:50,160
That was the thing. Like he still hasn't played those games. And so we really need a reaction

1892
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:54,560
stream from him. All right. Anyway, moving on, uh, let's go to Japan and check out the

1893
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:59,360
releases over there. Uh, we also, we have some similar stuff. We had like the R-type final two

1894
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:04,320
is out there as well. Uh, let's see, uh, that is on the switch. Uh, there's also some themed

1895
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:08,880
controllers and some peripherals and things like that coming out this week as well. And of course,

1896
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:13,040
new Pokemon snap is also getting its release in Japan. I mean, that would be pretty rude if they

1897
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:18,080
didn't put that out in Japan at the same time. Uh, there's lots of Sanrio, uh, related, um,

1898
02:04:18,080 --> 02:04:21,920
like Nintendo switch peripherals and things of that sort as well. So it's pretty big week for

1899
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:27,520
that type of stuff. Um, I think that's about it for the switch. Let me look at PlayStation

1900
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:31,360
five and PlayStation four. Oh, Returnal has a Japanese release this week on PlayStation

1901
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:35,840
five as well. So they're getting it about the same time. That's cool. Um, cause I think that

1902
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:40,400
was developed over here. And so Japan sometimes has to wait for those that are developed over

1903
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:45,200
here, but not that one. Uh, and then looking at PlayStation four, you have the star renegades and

1904
02:04:45,200 --> 02:04:49,600
R-type final two also getting their releases in Japan this week. So there you go. How about the

1905
02:04:49,600 --> 02:04:59,600
UK dark Sakura? A few things on the 29th, we have, uh, world war one, Verdun, um, and Tannenberg,

1906
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:02,960
uh, but that's the Western front and Eastern front, both coming out on PS five.

1907
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:10,880
Um, also taxi chaos for PS five and switch on the 30th, we have Terminator resistance enhanced

1908
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:18,640
on PS five, um, Pokemon snap on a switch battle acts on PlayStation and switch

1909
02:05:18,640 --> 02:05:26,720
and Returnal on PlayStation. All right. Uh, let us get to some more news stories. And then of

1910
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:31,840
course, we'll take your questions, uh, and comments in our chat room over twitch.tv slash

1911
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:36,640
VOG network. As we get a little closer to the end of the show. Okay. Shane is saying I'm correct.

1912
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:40,960
He has never played Pokemon snap. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna work on this and see what I can do

1913
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:44,160
in the meantime. Loki, why don't you get to our next story?

1914
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:49,360
Yeah. So we had a rumor a few weeks ago talking about Microsoft possibly,

1915
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:54,720
uh, looking to buy discord. Well, that's not going to happen. So apparently all the talks

1916
02:05:54,720 --> 02:06:00,320
are now off the table and it's that, you know, possible that it could be rekindled in the future,

1917
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:08,640
but not yet. So we can all take a nice, uh, relaxing side that, that, that nightmare isn't

1918
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:15,040
going to happen. All right. Uh, yeah, that's good. That's good. I don't think a lot of us

1919
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:18,240
really wanted to see that happen. I mean, some of us are probably reading into like,

1920
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:21,600
Oh, there are some good things that could come out of that, but I think most of us

1921
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:25,200
wanted discord to stay independent and it looks like that is, so it looks like all,

1922
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:29,440
it's not just Microsoft, but like all the suitors are off the table. Right. If I read that right.

1923
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:32,800
And it's just discord is going to go the independent right route. And I think that's

1924
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:38,480
the direction most of us wanted to see them take. Yeah. Yeah. So I think that's, uh, that's good

1925
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:48,160
news. Yay. All right. Uh, let's move on. Um, okay. This, this story is interesting. Um, and, uh,

1926
02:06:48,160 --> 02:06:52,000
this is, again, it's one of those things where it's like, it's, it's not the same as it was

1927
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:58,560
10 years ago. And I'm talking about the humble bundle, uh, humble bundle, the company, which,

1928
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:04,560
uh, is now an IGN company and has been for several years, by the way, um, humble bundle announced,

1929
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:09,440
uh, that in may, uh, there are no more, there are no longer going to be sliders, uh, when you buy

1930
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:14,000
a bundle. I think most of you have probably bought a humble bundle at some point, but let me remind

1931
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:18,880
you. Um, in the early days of humble bundle, they used to do these big indie bundles, right? Where

1932
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:22,240
it would be like, I don't know what seven, eight, nine games that they would give away for like a

1933
02:07:22,240 --> 02:07:27,600
pay what you want. And then they'd throw in an extra game or three, if you'd paid like a minimum,

1934
02:07:27,600 --> 02:07:31,040
or if you paid like above the average, you know, the little benchmarks would get you a

1935
02:07:31,040 --> 02:07:35,760
couple more games. And these were widely popular because you'd have a slider at the bottom where

1936
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:39,680
you could give all this money to the charity that they were supporting at the time. If it's like

1937
02:07:39,680 --> 02:07:43,440
doctors that borders or whoever it is they're supporting at the moment, or you could give like

1938
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:49,360
maybe 50% to the developers of the games and 50% to charity. And then there was a place where you

1939
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:54,000
could leave a humble tip as well. Cause you know, um, bandwidth isn't free, um, and, and putting the

1940
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,880
site together and all that. So you could leave them a little bit of a tip, but there were a lot

1941
02:07:56,880 --> 02:08:00,080
of people that would do those bundles and just give a hundred percent of the money to charity.

1942
02:08:00,080 --> 02:08:03,920
Um, you know, and that's, that's kind of what it was for, you know, you didn't really get a lot of

1943
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:08,960
new games in there. You got a lot of indie stuff, but I would say humble bundle was really where

1944
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:15,600
this started this whole concept of pay five bucks and get 10 awesome games. Right. And, and was,

1945
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:20,080
was really probably one of the biggest things we can blame for our fucking backlogs. Right.

1946
02:08:20,640 --> 02:08:25,840
It's humble bundle. Am I right? Loki is humble bundle the source of a lot of your backlog?

1947
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:33,600
Yeah. I already increased my backlog just today. Oh boy. Um, the VR one.

1948
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:40,480
Okay. Um, so, uh, yeah, so, um, things are going to be changing now because, uh, they're no longer

1949
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:45,840
going to have those sliders. Um, and, uh, what's going to happen is that you're going to be able

1950
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:52,960
to choose preset options that decide how the money is divvied up, but the charity portion

1951
02:08:52,960 --> 02:09:03,120
is capped at 15%. Meaning the best options for charity donations is 15%. Whereas in the past,

1952
02:09:03,120 --> 02:09:06,240
most of, a lot of us were giving a hundred percent to charity. And I don't think there's

1953
02:09:06,240 --> 02:09:10,960
anything wrong with that. Cause that was the whole point of humble bundle. But unfortunately,

1954
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:16,240
when we had that news, what four or five years ago at this point that IGN bought them.

1955
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:20,960
Well, we all know humble bundles kind of been, they've been a little bit different ever since,

1956
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:25,360
right? They're, they're more of a storefront. They, you know, they do these different,

1957
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:29,360
they try to sell their humble subscription and all of this, you know, when was the last time

1958
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:33,760
that they did an indie bundle that really caught fire the way the old ones did? Well,

1959
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:38,560
that's been a while with the subscription though. Like it's not even really subscription per se,

1960
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:42,400
cause you don't get automatically charged each month. And it's basically just,

1961
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:48,640
it's basically a bundle cause you buy you, you pay the amount and you get like 12 games.

1962
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:53,600
So it's, it's, it's kind of weird. You know what they are ahead of time. It's not like,

1963
02:09:53,600 --> 02:09:58,160
Oh, I'm going to repay this and have it recur every month. And then we'll be surprised with

1964
02:09:58,160 --> 02:10:01,520
what we get. It's like, cause there's been months I was like, yeah, I'm going to skip it,

1965
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:06,720
but I do it and it's a pretty good deal, but okay. It's not, it's hardly a subscription anymore.

1966
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:11,520
Now humble bundles said in their post announcing what's happening here,

1967
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:16,400
why they're removing the sliders. They want to unify their various services saying since we

1968
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:21,280
launched bundles a decade ago, sliders have not changed. Even as humble evolved by building

1969
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:25,760
products like humble choice and the humble store that all support charity without sliders.

1970
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:33,520
That's a, that's a weird flex to me. Like it's more that they need to keep the company running.

1971
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:37,920
They need to keep the lights on. It's, it's, it's what it boils down to. But of course,

1972
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:41,920
a lot of people are making jokes about how, well, they're not so humble anymore. Are they,

1973
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:46,240
or what was the great one liner that I just saw in chat? Ice P in chat says,

1974
02:10:46,240 --> 02:10:52,640
might be taken a bit of a humble tumble. That's funny. I like the humble tumbles funny.

1975
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:57,600
Blah, blah, blah, blah. So I think there's a lot of us that are taking issue with the fact that

1976
02:10:57,600 --> 02:11:01,600
they're calling themselves the humble bundle when the charity now seems to be taking a back seat to

1977
02:11:01,600 --> 02:11:05,840
the other stuff. And like, on one hand, I get it. Like maybe this is how they're going to be able

1978
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:10,560
to attract more developers is by basically guaranteeing the developers are going to get

1979
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:15,920
a certain minimum and all this, but it, it certainly does feel like, okay, then isn't

1980
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:21,360
the humble bundle now just a steam key reseller at this point? Isn't that just what they do?

1981
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:27,200
And not just steam key because they do Nintendo stuff too. They have like 3DS that was on there

1982
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:30,480
for a little bit as well. And they still do. I still see ads for it where they're,

1983
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:34,560
they're using like Mario brothers three in the ad, but that is something that you can,

1984
02:11:34,560 --> 02:11:38,800
you can buy on the store and redeem on like the 3DS shop and stuff. But essentially they're just

1985
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:45,920
a key seller front where a small part goes to charity. Do we care that, I mean, would,

1986
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:51,760
would a 15% charity donation change your mind and make you want to shop at humble bundle still?

1987
02:11:52,480 --> 02:11:57,120
Loki, it sounds like with you. Well, but you said you, well, you said you are on their subscription

1988
02:11:57,120 --> 02:12:02,880
thing. Yeah, right. I do that. And, um, I don't really change the sliders at all. I don't like

1989
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:09,440
give more to the charity. I just, whatever the default is. Um, SSG100Matt says, I believe humble

1990
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:13,520
was given the edict from Ziff Davis, the parent company to change the business model or they'll

1991
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:18,240
close it down. I'm sure Ziff is suffering from the pandemic and looking at their fiscal stuff.

1992
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:23,040
I'm sure humble is not really profitable and they push them to change this. Either they cap it or

1993
02:12:23,040 --> 02:12:28,400
humble goes away. Sad truth. And Tiger Claw follows that up with it's more like a humble

1994
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:38,240
stumble. Stop. Oh, you, uh, Jamie, uh, what are your thoughts with the whole, like, you know,

1995
02:12:38,240 --> 02:12:43,120
is it, is, is a 15% charity donation enough to get you to pay attention still to the store or

1996
02:12:43,680 --> 02:12:49,200
is it, it's just kind of whatever at this point. I'm kind of whatever. You're all in on Stadia now

1997
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:55,360
anyway, so it doesn't matter. Yeah, it's pretty much as like, uh, I, my, my heart has been taken

1998
02:12:55,360 --> 02:13:00,400
by the Stadia. All right. Well, at least my gaming experience has been taken by the Stadia.

1999
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:07,920
All right. All right. Let's move on and, uh, talk about our next story, which is, um, something I

2000
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:13,120
was not aware of, even though I've been interested in this game because everybody tells me I need to

2001
02:13:13,120 --> 02:13:20,240
play the other game. Anyway, Jamie, please take it away. So, um, there is definitely some trauma

2002
02:13:20,240 --> 02:13:27,200
going on with Nier Replicant, um, which is the newest game in the Nier series. And this is going

2003
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:30,560
to be a little bit spoilery. So I'm going to go ahead and give the warning out there. And it's,

2004
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:34,160
it's a reimagining of the first game is important to put out the Japanese version of first game.

2005
02:13:34,160 --> 02:13:37,840
It's not like a new thing in the story. It's a reimagining. I never played any of them. So,

2006
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:44,240
um, anyways, so, um, with this game, uh, then since it's not a spoiler,

2007
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:53,280
they have put in two achievements that could definitely be seen as sexist, but absolutely

2008
02:13:53,280 --> 02:14:00,400
as transphobic as well. Um, one of the characters in the game and I'm going to mispronounce, I think

2009
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:10,880
it's a kinase is intersex. Um, meaning has both general sets of, uh, genitalia. Um, so there is

2010
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:17,280
an achievement called daredevil. You risk life and limb 10 times to discover someone secret,

2011
02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:28,160
which is basically an upskirt cam. You look up kinase skirt 10 times. Um,

2012
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:33,520
there was, uh, and it was the same thing as a near automata called, what are you doing?

2013
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:41,360
Where you look up to be skirt. It's the upskirt thing. It's just encouraging bad behavior,

2014
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:47,120
but in this case, since it's dealing with an intersex character, it really is just

2015
02:14:48,400 --> 02:14:55,040
disgusting. Very bad taste at the bare minimum. It comes off like, I don't know if the intent

2016
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:58,800
was there to be transphobic, although that doesn't certainly matter at the end of the day,

2017
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:02,000
this whole thing just comes out. Like it just comes off as immature. Like it's just,

2018
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:07,360
it's just immature. Like, and I thought as gamers and wanting to be accepted as an art form,

2019
02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:11,600
which those near games are very artistic. And that's, that's the reason why I think this is

2020
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:15,680
so frustrating is that you don't want to see the game get canceled all over all this or whatever,

2021
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:20,880
because especially with your automata, there's a lot of beauty and brilliance in the story

2022
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:25,680
to just see something so immature, be a big blemish on it is just fresh.

2023
02:15:25,680 --> 02:15:31,200
This isn't immaturity specifically, this is sexist immaturity.

2024
02:15:31,200 --> 02:15:32,560
I'll give you that. Absolutely.

2025
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:37,920
The sexism is definitely there. And so there's already some major complaints about it,

2026
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:43,600
but we cannot overlook the general sexism of everything. Yeah. You know,

2027
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:48,400
by putting a blanket immaturity statement on it, it removes what this really is.

2028
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:52,720
Yeah. And you got some folks in chat that are echoing this a little bit saying,

2029
02:15:52,720 --> 02:15:58,480
as Joe and Hunter Matt says, poor taste. Act Dev says, yeah, immature. It's bad nonetheless.

2030
02:15:58,480 --> 02:16:02,720
Bob Coffee says, even if the intent is to reference automata's achievement,

2031
02:16:02,720 --> 02:16:06,160
it's pretty tasteless. It shouldn't have been an automata in the first place.

2032
02:16:06,160 --> 02:16:11,280
I would also agree with that. Amethyst Rose Witch says immature is an understatement. And I will,

2033
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:15,520
I will, I will grant, even though that's the first word that comes to my mind, I think

2034
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:19,920
dark soccer makes a very clear statement. And I agree with her that, you know, there's,

2035
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:26,320
it's, it's immaturity that, that has, that has very much sexism playing into it because we'd

2036
02:16:26,320 --> 02:16:31,760
upskirt on dudes is not a thing. Where's that achievement? That's not, you know,

2037
02:16:31,760 --> 02:16:38,320
that's not a thing. Where's that anime? There's no, I haven't seen too many dudes in kilts.

2038
02:16:38,320 --> 02:16:43,360
Yeah. And games. So anyway, and then so, but now you have this additional kind of like thing where,

2039
02:16:43,360 --> 02:16:49,680
where actually it's pretty cool that there's an intersex character in a game because there

2040
02:16:49,680 --> 02:16:56,480
are intersex people in this world, quite a few of them. And I'm sure that representation is awesome,

2041
02:16:56,480 --> 02:17:01,680
you know? So in, in that regard, you go near is doing an awesome thing by having an intersex

2042
02:17:01,680 --> 02:17:08,000
character be, and then it's like, and they do this really stupid thing with it and it sucks.

2043
02:17:08,720 --> 02:17:15,680
So that's, that's where we're left with, right? It's just, this is the kind of thing we really

2044
02:17:15,680 --> 02:17:20,560
shouldn't be encouraging. Yeah, no, I agree. I agree. I think they should probably, uh,

2045
02:17:20,560 --> 02:17:25,440
just take, take that achievement out and replace it with something that has to do with the game.

2046
02:17:25,440 --> 02:17:29,200
And it's not like she's wearing much of anything. She's basically wandering around and, you know,

2047
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:37,440
negligee. Yeah. But I, I do, I do understand where folks are very upset. I don't want to make sure

2048
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:40,800
this is clear too, especially when I'm using the word like immature. I want to make clear,

2049
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:46,480
I do understand where folks are very upset about this focus on genitalia, right? Because

2050
02:17:46,480 --> 02:17:52,720
unfortunately in our culture, you know, my brain goes to that Katie Couric interview when she's

2051
02:17:52,720 --> 02:17:58,720
interviewing what Laverne Cox and Carmen Carrera, I think that's her name, right? That was on Drag

2052
02:17:58,720 --> 02:18:04,080
Race all those years ago and then transitioned. Right. Um, and Katie Couric, who you think is

2053
02:18:04,080 --> 02:18:09,600
this like respectable journalist wants to talk about genitalia. And it's like that,

2054
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:15,600
why do we as a society have a fascinating fascination with that? That is a much deeper

2055
02:18:15,600 --> 02:18:21,360
question I expect us to tackle on this show. But my point is, is that like, that's just like

2056
02:18:21,360 --> 02:18:26,720
why this is so like, if you're having difficulty understanding, why does this get to the level of

2057
02:18:26,720 --> 02:18:34,720
transphobic? Because it, it makes it seem like gender is only genitalia and it's not that.

2058
02:18:35,520 --> 02:18:38,400
Would you agree with what I said, Jamie, or you want to course correct me a little bit?

2059
02:18:39,440 --> 02:18:48,080
Gender is not genitalia. Exactly. You know, your genitalia is basically what variety of

2060
02:18:48,080 --> 02:18:54,000
reproduction you can and cannot do. Yeah. End of story. Yep. And some people, I have

2061
02:18:54,720 --> 02:19:03,360
several friends who are intersex. One, um, who, uh, actually does have fairly working parts of

2062
02:19:03,360 --> 02:19:06,640
anatomy and I'm not going to name names or anything. And I only know this because I'm a

2063
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:19,360
good friend. You know, it's, um, it's definitely, um, definitely something that these are mostly

2064
02:19:19,360 --> 02:19:25,360
children by the way, who are having sex change performed on them or an assignment physically

2065
02:19:25,360 --> 02:19:35,040
inflicted on them in the hospital. Um, gender is personal. It's not a preference. Stop using

2066
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:42,240
preferred pronouns and just call them pronouns. Gender is a part of who you are and how you

2067
02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:52,480
identify. And so it's nobody's business, what genitalia that, that you have and parents should

2068
02:19:52,480 --> 02:19:58,000
stop announcing it to the world. They say, Oh look, I have a little human. Are you saying

2069
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:03,520
we shouldn't create earthquakes with giant explosions? God's been dropping hints to knock

2070
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:10,080
it off. God's been dropping a lot of hints to knock it off. And I'll actually even say in

2071
02:20:10,080 --> 02:20:17,600
Judaism there's seven genders. Oh, interesting. Yeah. Although there should be one for, for

2072
02:20:18,240 --> 02:20:24,000
female bodies in my position, but I won't, I won't go on that. So yeah, you, again,

2073
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:29,600
a whole other podcast going on here. And, and honestly, if this is of interest to you and

2074
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:34,480
you don't have to consider yourself intersex, transgender, whatever, to be interested in these

2075
02:20:34,480 --> 02:20:38,480
topics, that's, that's education listening to folks, right? Let's just, so if you want to

2076
02:20:38,480 --> 02:20:42,240
listen on this stuff, there's lots of podcasts out there, but just to, just to shift the

2077
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:46,320
conversation back a little bit to this, I just, you know, I think it's just very frustrating to

2078
02:20:46,320 --> 02:20:51,040
see like, Oh, this company did a great thing in the story and then they shot it in the foot

2079
02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:56,720
with this, you know, dumb thing. Yeah. So, yeah. And I know what their goal was. Two steps forward,

2080
02:20:56,720 --> 02:21:00,480
two steps back, right? I know their goal was to harken back to the other achievement,

2081
02:21:00,480 --> 02:21:05,280
but like I said, the other achievement shouldn't have existed either. Yeah. No,

2082
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:09,840
right. Absolutely right. It was, it was, and it may be in the instance of Nier Automata,

2083
02:21:09,840 --> 02:21:14,560
it's definitely, you know, that, that, um, sexist immaturity thing. I'm sorry. I forgot the exact

2084
02:21:14,560 --> 02:21:18,800
phrase you use, but it's, it's, it's definitely that. And it's just kind of one of those, again,

2085
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:25,200
if gaming culture wants to be seen as grownups, then we kind of have to act grown up. That's what

2086
02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:29,920
it boils down to. If you, and if you're sitting there going, but my anime titties, but my it's

2087
02:21:29,920 --> 02:21:36,480
like, you have problems with yourself. Like there's a whole other art form for you

2088
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:42,880
that needs to stay out of video games. And I need to, I need to correct myself. It's actually six,

2089
02:21:42,880 --> 02:21:50,400
uh, uh, six genders in Judaism. Thank you. All right. Let's, um, let's try to cleanse the

2090
02:21:50,400 --> 02:21:55,280
palette a little bit because, um, this there's some interesting similarities in this next story.

2091
02:21:55,760 --> 02:22:02,080
And I'll, I'll just turn it over to Loki. Yeah, this is kind of surprising. Um, so there

2092
02:22:02,080 --> 02:22:10,720
gearbox gearbox exec, uh, David Najib had testified against the Texas house bill 4042,

2093
02:22:10,720 --> 02:22:15,120
which would force a transgender athletes in public schools to compete in the sports.

2094
02:22:15,120 --> 02:22:19,840
According to the gender, they were assigned at birth. Uh, he basically said, I'm a Texan.

2095
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:25,200
I was born here and I know it's a welcoming, friendly place. I want to push that and not

2096
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:32,400
making up laws. We don't need, um, you know, our games company in competition or in competition

2097
02:22:32,400 --> 02:22:37,120
worldwide, we sell more to Asia than we do in the United States. We bring in a lot of money

2098
02:22:37,120 --> 02:22:42,000
into the state. We're headquartered here. We don't drive us to where we have to start expanding

2099
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:45,840
outside of Texas and outside of the country. We want to keep doing business here.

2100
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:51,920
Um, basically threatening that, you know, if something like this passes that they might

2101
02:22:51,920 --> 02:22:57,600
consider taking their business elsewhere. Um, it's kind of, it's kind of sickening that,

2102
02:22:57,600 --> 02:23:02,800
you know, we see this kind of stuff happening right now and it's not just in Texas either. So,

2103
02:23:03,360 --> 02:23:09,680
yeah, I don't know. Thank you for, um, being our token heterosexual saying that by the way,

2104
02:23:09,680 --> 02:23:13,760
cause we need more people like you to recognize that this is, this is wrong.

2105
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:17,680
It's ridiculous. All the things in the world right now, why are we worried about like

2106
02:23:19,120 --> 02:23:25,600
childhood sports? Who cares? Yeah. I, I, you know, you're preaching to the choir with me

2107
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:29,600
and, and our soccer and all that, but again, it's, it's very nice to hear you say that.

2108
02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:35,360
Um, and it's, it's, and, and it's nice to hear gearbox say that, which is a company that has,

2109
02:23:35,360 --> 02:23:39,760
again, it's, it's interesting cause now we have a two steps back, two steps forward situation,

2110
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:44,160
you know, gearbox is, uh, if it's saying constellations, it's not Randy Pitchford that

2111
02:23:44,160 --> 02:23:50,960
said that. So, you know, maybe, maybe it's still terrible. It's a sign of, of change in the guard

2112
02:23:50,960 --> 02:23:56,400
at gearbox. Perhaps. I don't know. I don't know, but it is refreshing to see them really take a

2113
02:23:56,400 --> 02:24:01,040
stand with that. You know, saying, you know, we're a Texas company. We do this. This law is not what

2114
02:24:01,040 --> 02:24:06,720
we're about. And, and it's been nice that in some other States, there have been some surprising

2115
02:24:06,720 --> 02:24:11,600
people that you would expect might support this. Right. Cause it was, it was vetoed in one state.

2116
02:24:11,600 --> 02:24:15,760
I'm unfortunately, this is happening far too often frequently, or I can't remember what

2117
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:19,680
States are doing what, but it's been vetoed by like two different governors in two different

2118
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:26,800
States, if I'm not mistaken. So. Yeah. And, and, um, actually, you know, to give Randy some, uh,

2119
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:35,120
prompts at least, um, he did echo the sentiment that was put forward by, um, the other guy saying,

2120
02:24:35,120 --> 02:24:39,680
you know, the kinds of people that are best in the world at creating technology, at creating

2121
02:24:39,680 --> 02:24:45,040
entertainment, these are people that do not want to live in places that are seen as discriminatory.

2122
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:49,600
So at least he did kind of echo that sentiment as well, but still, you know,

2123
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:57,040
he's got his own problems. Uh, going to chat, uh, Bobby Blackwolf says I'm in Georgia,

2124
02:24:57,040 --> 02:25:00,960
so I can help give Texas some pointers on companies leaving their state. And yeah, that's,

2125
02:25:00,960 --> 02:25:05,840
you know, another place where, uh, the companies have been voting with their wallets, so to speak.

2126
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:10,160
So, um, yeah, you have to vote with your wallet cause they're making it impossible to do it

2127
02:25:10,160 --> 02:25:18,480
otherwise. It's I, I, my, my laugh is a laugh of shock at the accuracy of that statement.

2128
02:25:18,480 --> 02:25:26,880
Like drag them, expose them. Loki. Yes. All right. Oof. Um, as she, 100 mountain chat

2129
02:25:26,880 --> 02:25:30,640
says as someone who works in sports, this is such a vindictive, nasty thing to do. It's

2130
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:34,160
just unnecessary. Yes. Again, we're going to have a whole another podcast on this topic,

2131
02:25:34,160 --> 02:25:38,720
but I'm very thankful to hear that a lot of people, you know, no matter, uh, I, we've got

2132
02:25:38,720 --> 02:25:43,040
a variety of backgrounds here, a variety of, you know, life steps, a variety of political leanings.

2133
02:25:43,040 --> 02:25:46,640
And I think most people are pretty much in agreement on this and maybe the folks that

2134
02:25:46,640 --> 02:25:50,640
aren't are being a little more quiet and listening to the reasons why we're saying it's such a bad

2135
02:25:50,640 --> 02:25:54,720
thing. And that's, that's a, that's a good thing too. Uh, hopefully maybe change a few minds here

2136
02:25:54,720 --> 02:26:03,760
as to why this is just, it's, it's gross thing to do. So, um, anyhow. Uh, uh, yeah. Pixel pocket

2137
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:07,840
says, uh, the anti-trans bills occurring in a handful of states are so utterly fucked up

2138
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:12,480
and hurting people who cannot defend themselves children and follows that up with think of the

2139
02:26:12,480 --> 02:26:17,360
children. Oh no, we don't mean all children. So, um, very well said there by pixel pockets.

2140
02:26:17,360 --> 02:26:23,040
I'll leave it on that note. Um, although they, thanks to gearbox for, uh, sticking up for that.

2141
02:26:23,040 --> 02:26:28,560
And, um, I th I think, um, do, do a good thing for the gaming industry. We kind of talked about

2142
02:26:28,560 --> 02:26:32,960
making the game industry sound like grownups. I think that was a very grownup thing for them

2143
02:26:32,960 --> 02:26:40,080
to do. So awesome. All right, moving on. Let's talk about, let's talk about something a little

2144
02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:45,600
silly. Um, but, but in the best possible way, and I think a good last story tonight to end on,

2145
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:52,560
and that has to do with this up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right. Be a start,

2146
02:26:52,560 --> 02:26:56,720
select, start. They, they all have different endings to them, but I'm sure you all recognize

2147
02:26:56,720 --> 02:27:03,760
that as the infamous Konami code, right? Well, did you know the Konami code is now 35 years old?

2148
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:11,760
Hello old and aging. Guess what? That's you. Uh, and I believe that code was first in the game.

2149
02:27:11,760 --> 02:27:15,280
Gradius, uh, was where that code showed up for the first time. And then of course,

2150
02:27:15,280 --> 02:27:18,880
I think a lot of people know it from Contra though, certainly. Uh, but all of those,

2151
02:27:18,880 --> 02:27:23,840
of course, the early Konami games where that sequence would unlock certain things or what

2152
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:30,560
have you. Um, now. Konami in celebration of the 35th anniversary. Yes. Konami did something. It's

2153
02:27:30,560 --> 02:27:36,000
very exciting. Uh, they've teamed up with some musicians to do some remixes, uh, from Gradius

2154
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:41,280
in what they're calling a lo-fi hip hop compilation. So it's remixes of what's that?

2155
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:46,560
So that sounds nice. Oh yeah. It's cool. Uh, a remix of the, I would, I would play it here,

2156
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:50,240
but that gets into weird copyright things. And so I just would encourage you to seek this out

2157
02:27:50,240 --> 02:27:55,840
on your own. Um, it's a remix of the theme by Tokyo machine is included on that as well. Uh,

2158
02:27:55,840 --> 02:27:59,360
and, uh, there's also some merchandise, of course, of course, cause you know,

2159
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:04,000
Konami is getting into that right now, selling the merchandise like Gradius t-shirts and logos from

2160
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:09,200
Gradius titles and so forth. Um, anyhow, there, the video, if you want to check that out is on

2161
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:14,320
YouTube. So check Konami's YouTube channel, and there is a company illustration and motion graphic

2162
02:28:14,320 --> 02:28:20,240
to, uh, kind of, uh, uh, mimic what's going on there. And, uh, there's six tracks in the list

2163
02:28:20,240 --> 02:28:24,640
and, uh, you can check that out over on Konami's YouTube channel. So, uh, a fun way to kind of

2164
02:28:24,640 --> 02:28:30,880
celebrate something that a lot of us as gamers just have ingrained into our brains that up,

2165
02:28:30,880 --> 02:28:36,320
up, down, down, left, right, left, right BA start. Yeah. Uh, quick can, does anyone remember the

2166
02:28:36,320 --> 02:28:45,200
championship code from the Capcom code? Uh, down, right, up, left YB. If I remember right,

2167
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:47,920
this is how you unlock championship mode. If I, somebody can fact check me on that,

2168
02:28:47,920 --> 02:28:51,680
see if my memory still works after all these years, but I say downright as in the button

2169
02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:58,080
down, right, up, left YB, I believe is it. So, uh, Bobby black Wolfen chat, uh, giving us the,

2170
02:28:58,080 --> 02:29:08,640
uh, infamous IDD, QD and those codes IDBFG. Uh, Oh, I was right. Dark Tetsuya says I'm right.

2171
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:13,920
Yeah. Don right up left YB or it's XA at the Japanese version. Okay. Fair enough. Um,

2172
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:20,080
orange, right. Says ABA CABB. That's the blood code, right? From world combat. If I remember

2173
02:29:20,080 --> 02:29:25,600
right. Um, ABA and Ikari warriors. That's right. Abba. My favorite code in any game.

2174
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:33,040
Good. All right. Anyway. Excellent. So, uh, of good reminiscent on the codes and all that

2175
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:39,200
good stuff. I still need to do the one in dead by daylight to get the Vic Viper. That would not work

2176
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:45,280
for the life of me on the Xbox one, but I need to try it now. It doesn't work on console. It

2177
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:49,840
only there's people that have YouTube's of it where they're doing it stopped working after

2178
02:29:49,840 --> 02:29:57,120
July, 2020. Why did they turn it off? They did hold on. I've actually got the thing to tell you

2179
02:29:57,120 --> 02:30:06,400
rude, but it still works on PC. Still works on PC. They ended this. I've got the article.

2180
02:30:06,400 --> 02:30:09,760
No wonder it didn't work. And I'm looking at these YouTube's where I'm like, the guy's doing

2181
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:18,960
it slower than I, God. Um, yeah. June, June 16th, 2020. Um, it, it ended on, um, on the console

2182
02:30:18,960 --> 02:30:25,120
versions. Oh, that's irritating. All right. Well, thank you for letting me know I can stop. There's

2183
02:30:25,120 --> 02:30:29,600
another reason to buy it on steam so I can have my Vic Viper. All right. Yeah. Uh, this is the part

2184
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:33,600
of the show where we would go to the mailbag, participate at orange launch radio.com. If you

2185
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:40,320
want to send us an email, but I believe that is an empty mailbag this week, right? Yeah. All right.

2186
02:30:40,320 --> 02:30:45,920
So you know what that means? Drag race talk. Season 13 finally ended. I didn't watch it,

2187
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:50,640
but of course Twitter filled me in on it. All right. Then I won't worry. All right. Don't

2188
02:30:50,640 --> 02:30:57,040
chat. Don't spoil please. Cause dark soccer for myself right now. Oh, all right. Just tell me

2189
02:30:57,040 --> 02:31:03,760
we get dark soccer's reaction live. Uh, I, um, I, I want to be very careful not to spoil it for

2190
02:31:03,760 --> 02:31:09,360
anyone out there. Although I guess it's been 48 hours. Oh yeah. It was the second person I would

2191
02:31:09,360 --> 02:31:13,680
have wanted. Yeah. I, I, and I would say it was the per I did watch the beginning of the season.

2192
02:31:13,680 --> 02:31:18,400
I would say it was extremely obvious to me that person was going to win from like episode three.

2193
02:31:19,120 --> 02:31:23,680
So I, I don't know why everyone, I get that. Um, one of the other contestants was really

2194
02:31:23,680 --> 02:31:28,000
showing a lot and I think had a lot of people rooting, um, for them, uh, uh, throughout the

2195
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:33,360
season. But, um, but I think it was obvious from the third episode, this dress. Yeah. I'll have

2196
02:31:33,360 --> 02:31:37,280
to link you to pick the, the picture. I already know what it is. This is the one that looks like

2197
02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:43,760
the final fantasy boss meets pinhead. All right. You'll have to already send it to me. The one,

2198
02:31:43,760 --> 02:31:48,800
the white dress. Oh no, it's I'm thinking of something else. Nevermind. Okay. All right.

2199
02:31:48,800 --> 02:31:53,680
Anyway. Uh, hopefully all star six starts soon. That one's going to be on paramount plus. What

2200
02:31:53,680 --> 02:32:00,240
do you think about that? Drag race, uh, taken one of its biggest, uh, spinoffs to, uh, another,

2201
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:07,680
uh, uh, service. It's kind of interesting. I wish they'd just stay somewhere. All right.

2202
02:32:09,040 --> 02:32:13,440
By the way, guys, I'm trying to talk Shane into the, um, Pokemon stream and I think,

2203
02:32:14,160 --> 02:32:18,800
um, uh, he's, he's into it. He's like, is this another point reward thing? And I'm going to be

2204
02:32:18,800 --> 02:32:23,760
like, no, just, just because, but he says, I don't see why this wouldn't be doable. So I think we're

2205
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:27,920
onto something there. So we may, we may have a special stream here at VOG just because not

2206
02:32:27,920 --> 02:32:31,040
everything has to be a point reward thing, right? Bobby. I got to get clearance from Bobby. Not

2207
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:34,960
everything has to be a point reward thing, right? Bobby. All right. I'm almost positive. Uh, he'll

2208
02:32:34,960 --> 02:32:43,040
be with me on the same. He's like content. Great. Do it. All right. Um, okay. Thank you. Bobby says

2209
02:32:43,040 --> 02:32:47,920
not everything has to be a point reward. Great. Excellent. All right. Uh, let's get into some

2210
02:32:47,920 --> 02:32:55,840
last minute stories then. Uh, Loki. All right. So, uh, it's happened. It's happened. We're

2211
02:32:55,840 --> 02:33:02,320
finally getting Lego, green Mario, and I'm very excited. I should, I forgot to slot that story.

2212
02:33:03,520 --> 02:33:08,960
It's it was coming out. It's coming out in August. So in my head, that was in the first

2213
02:33:08,960 --> 02:33:15,680
half of the show, Loki. It's all good. Yeah. So a brand new starter set coming, uh, with boom,

2214
02:33:15,680 --> 02:33:20,640
boom and a pink Yoshi. So I will have to pick that up, but that's, uh, yeah, coming out

2215
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:27,520
August 1st, which is actually a year after the original, uh, Lego Mario set bid. Um,

2216
02:33:27,520 --> 02:33:31,040
so looking forward to that and what other sets are coming. Cause obviously now that they have

2217
02:33:31,040 --> 02:33:36,880
a new starter set, they're going to have some more, uh, stuff coming. So very interesting.

2218
02:33:38,720 --> 02:33:43,680
Uh, pixel, pixel pockets and chat says, what else happened on the show? And Rob's head,

2219
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:46,960
um, we had the listenership we had in 2006.

2220
02:33:50,320 --> 02:33:55,200
I'm teasing. I love you guys that show up every week. I really do. All right. Sorry, Loki.

2221
02:33:56,320 --> 02:34:02,560
Um, yeah. So, uh, there was that. And then apparently some rumors that, um,

2222
02:34:03,840 --> 02:34:09,680
Sony is blocking, uh, resident evil eight from games past because of force parody.

2223
02:34:10,320 --> 02:34:15,360
Oh, I did see some of the rumors about that and that whole, the contract page that leaked

2224
02:34:15,360 --> 02:34:21,200
and all that stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I honestly though, should that surprise anyone? Like people are

2225
02:34:21,200 --> 02:34:27,600
acting like it's this big ass deal, but like if Sony is going to spend the, the free promotion,

2226
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:32,720
when they put a resident evil trailer in their PlayStation showcase and all this stuff,

2227
02:34:32,720 --> 02:34:36,320
they're basically giving them free advertising, you know, and there's, you know, certain

2228
02:34:36,320 --> 02:34:41,760
concessions. So yes, they're going to be like, Hey, you can't go and then give away this game

2229
02:34:41,760 --> 02:34:47,120
on game pass. You know, when it's, we're trying to sell copies on PlayStation by having these ads

2230
02:34:47,120 --> 02:34:52,160
here. I'm not sure why this is shocking to some people. Um, I think it's just shocking to see it

2231
02:34:52,160 --> 02:34:56,720
in writing and people feel like they're in a secret club getting to read these leak contracts

2232
02:34:56,720 --> 02:35:00,160
and stuff. And I get that. Like, it's like, Ooh, I'm seeing something I'm not supposed to see.

2233
02:35:00,160 --> 02:35:04,320
And it's a little bit scandalous, you know, but I don't think it's, this should not be

2234
02:35:04,400 --> 02:35:09,440
surprising whatsoever. Um, and Bobby black woven chat says, yeah, I don't begrudge Sony for this.

2235
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:14,640
They're doing a lot of marketing and free demos and stuff. Absolutely. I don't like,

2236
02:35:14,640 --> 02:35:20,960
this shouldn't be a surprise. Like, honestly, be happy you got MLB the show. And I say this

2237
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:26,160
as some, and you guys know, I've been very pro Xbox the last couple of years on this show. Okay.

2238
02:35:26,160 --> 02:35:30,080
So like, but I'm going to say, I'm going to say to the Microsoft folks on this one,

2239
02:35:30,960 --> 02:35:34,960
just back off. Okay. Like this, this, this one makes sense.

2240
02:35:34,960 --> 02:35:40,400
Okay. Loki, uh, there was something else I saw too, about them renewing their trademark for

2241
02:35:40,400 --> 02:35:47,200
PlayStation home. So was that a thing that's happening? That is another route. Well,

2242
02:35:47,200 --> 02:35:53,440
we don't know. Uh, it's, it's in that rumor status since it's not, yeah. Um, curious.

2243
02:35:53,440 --> 02:35:57,840
I don't know. I don't, I don't know if we should jump to the conclusion it's happening.

2244
02:35:57,840 --> 02:36:02,800
It would be a very nice summertime announcement. Um, but I'm sure there's a lot of people going,

2245
02:36:02,800 --> 02:36:08,640
Ooh, PlayStation home makes a lot of sense for VR. Um, which I could definitely see it going that

2246
02:36:08,640 --> 02:36:14,400
way. Uh, uh, uh, uh, VR chat type of thing, I guess. Um, but I, I honestly would like to see

2247
02:36:14,400 --> 02:36:20,800
PlayStation home. I know we gave PlayStation home a lot of shit, but we had very ardent fans of

2248
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:26,080
PlayStation home really open our eyes to the capability of, of what it could do over the years.

2249
02:36:26,160 --> 02:36:31,920
And I think the most frustrating part was that like, you really saw the limits of what they

2250
02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:37,360
were able to do in PlayStation home. Like, Oh man, it would have been awesome if like our clubhouse

2251
02:36:37,360 --> 02:36:43,200
could have played a YouTube or a trailer or have maybe custom items that we did, whatever happened

2252
02:36:43,200 --> 02:36:47,120
to the trophies for achievements and stuff that you could actually put on your wall. Like there

2253
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:52,480
were, there were a lot of potential things that, that home never realized. And then it did other

2254
02:36:52,480 --> 02:36:55,840
things that were kind of neat, like the fake E3 booth, the virtually three booth. That was kind

2255
02:36:55,840 --> 02:37:01,520
of cool. So I would hope that maybe the technology of the PlayStation five can really let them

2256
02:37:01,520 --> 02:37:06,240
advance those capabilities of PlayStation home, but they need to be able to advance those

2257
02:37:06,240 --> 02:37:10,480
capabilities of PlayStation home for me to care. If they're just doing the same thing they did on

2258
02:37:10,480 --> 02:37:17,120
the PlayStation three, then, then it's going to be flop city. I don't think I I'm trying to believe

2259
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:23,120
that wouldn't be the case that with an upgrade to PlayStation five comes more than better graphics

2260
02:37:23,120 --> 02:37:30,800
and better stuff that Sony really is looking at. How do we make a social thing to respond to Twitch

2261
02:37:30,800 --> 02:37:35,760
to respond to, you know, and then when they go and get rid of communities that really sends a

2262
02:37:35,760 --> 02:37:43,360
mixed signal, not the communities was really used at all. I like to think Sony did that in

2263
02:37:43,440 --> 02:37:48,720
preparation for this, but am I giving them too much credit? I'm worried I am.

2264
02:37:51,280 --> 02:37:54,880
Anyway, thank you for bringing that up. I forgot about that one. And that one's important.

2265
02:37:55,440 --> 02:38:00,160
No problem. Hi, Midna. I see Kitty on cam. Here we go. All right. Anything else?

2266
02:38:00,160 --> 02:38:06,080
Mama has some string cheese. No, that's it. All right. Then I think we're about ready to wrap up.

2267
02:38:06,080 --> 02:38:10,080
So I want to thank everybody for listening to Orange Lawns Radio tonight. Thank you so much

2268
02:38:10,080 --> 02:38:14,160
for participating with our show. If you enjoyed what you heard here on OLR, please tell a friend

2269
02:38:14,160 --> 02:38:17,760
or two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has

2270
02:38:17,760 --> 02:38:23,920
a voice. But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, what can we do? A nice five star review on

2271
02:38:23,920 --> 02:38:28,000
a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this podcast will go a very long way. Spotify,

2272
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:32,320
we're on there too. So thank you very much to everybody that does that. An auto host here at

2273
02:38:32,320 --> 02:38:39,520
Twitch TV also does wonders. So thank you to those of you that go and do that as well. If you feel so

2274
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:45,040
inclined, you can also support our store over at vognetwork.com slash shop if you want to be able

2275
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:53,040
to shop for some merchandise there like an OLR sticker or things like that. So thank you. Again,

2276
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:57,280
a lot of you were very generous tonight during the show here live on Twitch. A lot of you are

2277
02:38:57,280 --> 02:39:01,840
very generous in the things you say throughout the week online on Twitter and all that stuff.

2278
02:39:01,840 --> 02:39:06,320
So thank you very much for everybody that takes time out to say hello and they appreciate what

2279
02:39:06,320 --> 02:39:10,640
we're doing here. We appreciate you. Thank you so much. It was funny. There was actually somebody

2280
02:39:10,640 --> 02:39:16,240
I was having a disagreement with on Twitter. We were having a spirited disagreement, not an

2281
02:39:16,240 --> 02:39:20,640
F U U F and F and things like that. It was, you know, oh, we disagree on this. Here's my perspective.

2282
02:39:20,640 --> 02:39:25,040
Here's my perspective. But I thought it was very nice that he ended it with, hey, I'm a big fan of

2283
02:39:25,040 --> 02:39:29,760
OLR. And I was like, that does mean a lot. Even if we don't agree on this one particular issue,

2284
02:39:30,080 --> 02:39:37,120
I it still means a lot that people are. So inclined to engage and interact with the show

2285
02:39:37,120 --> 02:39:42,000
and and the people behind it after all these years coming up on 19 years in June.

2286
02:39:42,880 --> 02:39:48,160
All right. I think we should get final thoughts, shouldn't we? I will start with Dark Sakura.

2287
02:39:50,080 --> 02:39:54,400
Please stay tuned. Please stay tuned. Please, please, please. I need the attention.

2288
02:39:54,480 --> 02:39:59,840
All right. At least you're honest. All right. My channel, I want I want to do more things

2289
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:06,480
for everybody. And the only way I can do them is if people join in. My final thought is, please

2290
02:40:06,480 --> 02:40:12,160
cross your fingers and toes. We put our first bid in on a house today. And I'm not thinking we're

2291
02:40:12,160 --> 02:40:18,640
going to get it, but I had this house is perfect. It has it like it has an upstairs loft area that

2292
02:40:18,640 --> 02:40:24,000
would be perfect for this show if we wanted to continue to do it in person. So and it's much

2293
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:30,400
closer to you, Dark Sakura. So we'll see what happens anyway. Loki, last but not least, your

2294
02:40:30,400 --> 02:40:36,640
final thought. So during the show, I ordered labels for my cartridges, so hopefully they turn

2295
02:40:36,640 --> 02:40:43,040
out. All right. Getting closer. Appreciate that. All right. I can't wait to own a physical copy.

2296
02:40:43,040 --> 02:40:47,360
All right. That's it, everybody. We'll be back to do it in seven days. Thank you for tuning into our

2297
02:40:47,360 --> 02:40:52,560
show this week. And we'll see you next week when, oh, my gosh, it's actually going to be May, isn't

2298
02:40:52,560 --> 02:40:58,560
it? Please leave your Justin Timberlake memes out of this. That is overdone. That's it. Have
