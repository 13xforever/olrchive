0	13480	A $1 part is being blamed as the source of the holdup for new console production, along
13480	15360	with all other electronic device production.
15360	18180	But the outrage over a $1 part ignores the economies of scale.
18180	22600	A general purpose, broadly applicable, inexpensive device means that millions, even billions,
22600	24900	are created within an incredibly short timeframe.
24900	27760	What happens when supply or demand swings dramatically for that part?
27760	29100	A critical shortfall.
29100	30980	This is the update for Mr. Not-An-Economist.
30980	34340	It's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to explain more on this
34340	37260	and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has
37260	38260	a voice.
38260	44820	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where
44820	46640	every gamer has a voice.
46640	53940	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again with episode number 864 of our
53940	57700	show for this April the 11th of 2021.
57700	62900	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello first off to DarkSakra or
62900	63900	Jamie Summers.
63900	64900	Yo.
64900	65900	Hi, how are you?
65900	67540	I'm all right.
67540	69260	It's been a cool day.
69260	77500	I got to hang out with Becky and Julian, and he's doing better, and it's been pretty good.
77500	83220	And I'll ask you when it's your turn for how is your week?
83220	86500	Let me introduce Loki, and then we'll come back to me.
86500	90060	First off, the audience may not know, Julian's been dealing with some stuff.
90060	94380	We'll just leave it at that, but it's looking hopeful, which is good.
94380	99020	And if you don't know who we're talking about, we had him on the show, and he was probably
99020	102100	about, you were thinking, nine years old when he was on the show talking about Minecraft,
102100	103100	right?
103100	104100	More like 10, yeah.
104100	108420	He's 13 now, and tall in the last picture I saw.
108420	112300	Yeah, he's taller than me and Becky and still growing.
112300	113740	Oh boy, oh boy.
113740	116060	So it'll be fun to have him back at some point.
116060	117420	So we'll have to make that happen.
117420	118420	He's interested in it.
118420	119420	Awesome.
119420	120420	All right.
120420	121420	Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
121420	126500	Yeah, because I'm 40 and I'm still talking about Minecraft, so it's fine.
126500	127980	I love it.
127980	132780	You have a great, you have a new microphone, which suddenly disappeared from your camera,
132780	133780	but I like it.
133780	134780	You have a new mic.
134780	135780	It's because they moved it away from me.
135780	136780	It's literally in front of my face, but yeah.
136780	139660	Okay, well, it's great that you have a new mic.
139660	143940	And of course, as we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geese Network, twitch.tv
143940	148020	slash vog network, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black
148020	149020	Wolf show.
149020	151780	If the audio seems off to you guys, please let us know.
151780	157340	I do try to watch it live, but like visually and what you guys really hear can often be
157340	158900	a different thing.
158900	164940	So I always am watching the chat to get that sort of feedback there.
164940	168780	So all right, let's see.
168780	172020	Tiger Claw in chat says, enter the matrix in the background.
172020	174500	And some folks are saying, wow, it looks old.
174500	176060	Yes, it is.
176060	177060	It is an older game.
177060	178060	Yeah.
178060	179980	That was like a GameCube game, right?
179980	182540	That was PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox.
182540	183540	So yeah.
183540	184540	Hmm.
184540	187500	And now, of course, since you moved your mic from when we calibrated before the show, you're
187500	188500	a little bit low, but that's okay.
188500	189500	How about I move it again?
189500	190500	Let me move it again.
190500	191500	No, no, no, no.
191500	192500	You're fine.
192500	193500	You're fine.
193500	194500	You're fine.
194500	195500	I adjusted it on this side.
195500	196500	You're good.
196500	197500	All right.
197500	198500	Let me go back to Dark Soccer because she had asked, how was my day?
198500	199500	So, yes.
199500	201100	And I've brought it up on the show a couple of times.
201180	203780	I got my second COVID shot today.
203780	204780	And I'm fine.
204780	205780	I'm just tired.
205780	206780	Like, but I don't know.
206780	209780	I'm also asking the question, am I tired because the vaccine?
209780	212020	Am I tired because I'm lazy?
212020	216700	Or am I tired because I've actually been like super getting into walking lately, which sounds
216700	217700	weird.
217700	223740	But I've definitely hit this point where I'm like, wow, that COVID 19 pounds.
223740	224900	That's very noticeable, Rob.
224900	226220	I need to do something about this.
226220	229940	I've been really trying to like get up and move and like use apps to do that.
229940	234660	Not just things like Pokemon Go and gamification, but like, you know, tracking for my heart
234660	235900	rate and things like that.
235900	239660	So I might just be tired because I've been doing that like every day this week.
239660	242140	Been walking at least two miles, if not more.
242140	244500	Most days I was actually doing three or three and a half.
244500	246780	So I might just be tired from that.
246780	249260	But I took today off, obviously, because of getting the shot.
249260	251660	I knew that I'd be a little bit tired.
251660	252660	But yeah.
252660	257820	And I also find my I'm just kind of like, ah, like, I don't know how to explain it.
257820	261620	My brain is like I'm forgetting really weird things for OLR tonight.
261620	264300	I remember to hit record before you ask that one.
264300	265340	I remember.
265340	269500	But I'm forgetting like other weird things like we weren't muted when we went live tonight.
269500	274620	So they heard somebody cough like just weird things like that that usually aren't a problem.
274620	279540	But trust me, whatever this is, it's way better than getting COVID itself.
279540	284740	And I would hate for people to have these side effects that they're hearing about.
284740	289340	Stop them from potentially getting the vaccine because everybody really should get vaccinated
289340	291860	because that's what's going to help stop the spread of this thing.
291860	294740	And unfortunately, you're starting to hear about there's another surge, right?
294740	295740	Not so much in California.
295740	297340	I think we're OK for now.
297340	302540	But you're seeing a surge in other parts of the country because and it's it's a lot younger
302540	308740	people are spreading it now because unfortunately, the narrative in the beginning became, oh,
308740	313780	young people are immune to this and the survival rate is so high that nobody was talking about.
313820	315420	But there are long term effects.
315420	319020	And we've had somebody on this program talking about their long term effects, who is not
319020	321380	you know, who is young, younger than 40.
321380	325980	And, you know, people are just like tuning that kind of stuff out for whatever reason.
325980	328020	And so now it's spreading with younger people.
328020	330660	So just get the damn vaccine.
330660	332580	It's not going to be that difficult.
332580	335620	If you all get flu shots, it's like it's it's like the same thing.
335620	339140	I don't always feel great the day I get the flu shot either, but then it's gone pretty
339140	340140	quick.
340140	341140	Right.
341140	342140	And then I don't get the flu.
342140	343140	Good stuff.
343380	344900	So that's that's my day.
344900	347780	I barely got to do the Pokemon Go community day today.
347780	353140	And that was sad just because I came home and I wanted a nap.
353140	355380	But I caught three shinies.
355380	356540	And that's enough to have one.
356540	360400	So the special Pokemon today is Snivy Snivy Snivy.
360400	361400	So I caught three.
361400	364300	So that's enough to have one of each.
364300	365460	And that's fine by me.
365460	369980	I don't know how many Shane got the I texted he texted me about 90 minutes into it for
369980	370980	his.
370980	372740	He said he was up to 23.
372740	375260	So I'm like he probably had 100 by the time it was done.
375260	376260	I don't know.
376260	377260	I have to often message him.
377260	378260	Who knows?
378260	379260	That sounds like it.
379260	380260	Yeah.
380260	381260	Sounds like it.
381260	382260	Let's see.
382260	384540	Bobby says, I'm actually glad I got some side effects from the second shot.
384540	385660	It told me it was working.
385660	386660	Yes.
386660	387660	That's very true.
387660	391620	Act Def says Shane tweeted that he got 38 or 39.
391620	392660	So it's so high.
392660	393660	He lost count.
393660	395140	How about that?
395140	396540	That sounds accurate.
396540	397900	That sounds very accurate.
397900	399140	All right.
399140	402180	Let's get into tonight's kickoff topic.
402180	405660	Lots of talk about Sony this week in the news.
405660	407100	Some decisions going on internally.
407100	409500	Loki, you want to talk to us a little bit about this?
409500	413720	Yeah, apparently, Dave decided, hey, you know what?
413720	416940	We won a lot of awards for The Last of Us and The Last of Us 2.
416940	419420	How about we do another The Last of Us?
419420	420420	And so they are.
420420	427700	They're planning right now on remaking the original Last of Us or PlayStation 5.
427700	430200	The original Last of Us came out in 2013.
430200	432140	It's not all that old.
432140	436480	So I'm surprised that they're remaking it, but I'm not.
436480	444500	They redid PS3 games for PS4, like Heavy Rain, I guess, but I'm not surprised they're doing
444500	445500	it again.
445500	446500	Those aren't remakes.
446500	448500	Those are remasters.
448500	453700	Well, somebody just to be quick, somebody came up with a good eye theory online, and
453700	454700	I hope this is true.
454700	458900	I think somebody replied to one of my tweets with this is that if they redo The Last of
458900	463340	Us and put the accessibility settings the second game had, because that's what the first
463340	468460	game is missing from 2013 is that huge range of accessibility from the second game.
468460	472460	So if they redo the first game with that, that's going to make it playable for some
472460	473460	people.
473460	474460	So that's going to be a huge change.
474460	475460	So there is that.
475460	476460	Yeah.
476460	481320	So right now they're sticking to making big blockbuster games.
481320	486500	So I assume that'll be the same with The Last of Us remake, remaster, whatever you call
486500	489700	it when it eventually comes out.
489700	494660	But I don't know, I think it's too soon.
494660	500940	I don't have a problem with them doing like a remake, but like a remaster, like, hey,
500940	505620	you know what, we're bringing The Last of Us with those additional accessibility settings
505620	506960	and we're bringing it to PlayStation 5.
506960	508900	I don't consider that a remake.
508900	512560	Like the Final Fantasy 7 remake is a remake.
512560	518040	The Last of Us, if you were actually going to remake the game in its entirety for the
518040	521060	PlayStation 5, it seems like that's way too soon.
521060	526440	Now what about this whole talk about the Days Gone sequel that they had pitched is apparently
526440	528560	not actually going to be happening.
528560	532720	Like the studio that did that wanted to do like a sequel to Days Gone.
532720	535040	And so they've decided for whatever reason, they're not going to do it.
535040	537760	I don't know if the game just wasn't critically claimed enough.
537760	543080	I guess some people, some people said the ending really set it up for a sequel that
543080	546400	I guess wasn't quite ready yet.
546400	552200	Well, I mean, it just probably wasn't as popular as The Last of Us, The Last of Us, you know,
552200	557840	and probably, you know, even so much as like Uncharted and stuff, extremely popular franchises,
557840	558920	Days Gone.
558920	561520	I don't see a HBO Days Gone show.
561520	564920	I don't see them, you know, winning tons of awards for that game.
564920	566420	It was just kind of, it was good.
566420	571740	And so, okay, sorry, excellent, but now, now you're really dropping the breadcrumbs into
571740	576480	the larger piece of what is happening with all these moves for Sony this week, which
576480	582620	is Sony seems to be infatuated with the big budget, the blockbuster games, and this is
582620	583620	their approach.
583620	587540	And that's the kind of just said what it is.
587540	590320	Days Gone isn't about to become an HBO show.
590320	592240	Days Gone doesn't have all these things going for it.
592240	597880	But then again, Loki, Horizon Zero Dawn doesn't have a HBO show yet.
597880	600840	But Sony definitely seems to still be sticking with that one.
600840	605400	But Sony definitely seems to be trending towards this.
605400	611120	They want to take, they want to put a lot of money into big, big games, big, big exclusives,
611120	618560	and really take that that risk, which I guess is I didn't need to well, because I think,
618560	620280	okay, go ahead.
620280	624480	I think they kind of have to because they see the writing on the walls.
624480	631280	I mean, Microsoft has purchased a lot of big studios like Bethesda, you know, which carries
631280	636860	with it, you know, it and, of course, you know, the big, you know, like Elder Scrolls
636860	642040	franchise Fallout and stuff, those are all going to be exclusive Xbox games coming soon.
642040	647440	They have to go in on big exclusive titles, because that's what's drawing people to those
647440	648900	platforms.
648900	654500	I think if they're competing head to head, as far as like third party games go, I think
654500	658220	Microsoft has a better offering there, especially with Games Pass, right?
658220	659220	Sure.
659220	664140	Some games, you know, with the hardware might be more polished on PlayStation five versus
664140	668380	place, you know, Xbox Series X or something like that.
668380	671140	But when it comes down to it, it doesn't really matter.
671140	676540	It's like usually you'll get a console where all your all your friends are, I guess, or
676540	677540	you're buying both.
677700	683500	But if third party games don't really differ that greatly between two different platforms,
683500	687940	so it's really coming down to the first party games and they really need to have something
687940	690060	that draws people to that console.
690060	695140	Loki, if I'm not mistaken, isn't there like it doesn't Sony seem to be moving in again?
695140	696460	You know, here we go again.
696460	699220	This is all about perception, not necessarily facts.
699220	705500	But if I remember right, a smaller team was working on this Last of Us remaster, like
705500	711180	a whole little studio that was kind of formed to do these sorts of artistic sorts of things.
711180	718460	And then they shifted that to Naughty Dog and basically kind of this like little pet
718460	722020	project team that wanted to do these audio visual sorts of things.
722020	726460	They were kind of dismantled and sent throughout the company, which was kind of like a blow
726460	732580	to, you know, their their morale and so forth, because, you know, they were very excited
732580	733940	about what they were doing.
733940	739660	But my point is, does Sony not see the value in what like a smaller team can do anymore?
739660	743500	That's that's kind of a concern because, you know, yes, Microsoft is buying up all these
743500	745100	big things like Bethesda.
745100	748980	But what's really a strength of Game Pass right now?
748980	753540	Game Pass has a lot of indie stuff that's on it and a lot of indies get discovered through
753540	754540	that.
754540	755540	Right.
755540	756540	So.
756540	759500	Yeah, you're muted, Loki, just, you know.
759500	762340	I know there's so much chaos going in the background.
762340	763340	Sorry.
763340	766940	No, no, no, it's fine.
766940	767940	It's fine.
767940	771740	It's I already knew going into tonight's show, it was going to be one of those nights.
771740	773820	Well, this brand new mic is so awesome.
773820	775820	It picks up all of that.
775820	776820	Right.
776820	778860	Well, let me ask this.
778860	783780	Let me ask Dark Sakura, what do you think about Sony's approach here where it seems
783780	789680	like they're really shifting to we're going to be about the big triple A games and maybe
789680	793600	not so much the smaller stuff?
793600	795040	I think it's unsurprising.
795040	804240	I think that they're really looking, I think, for the higher dollar items, things that are
804240	812620	going to maybe not be able to go again for the entire, you know, for a wider spread group
812620	819200	of players, but something that's going to be for a the majority of their players.
819200	820200	Does that make sense?
820200	821200	Yeah.
821200	822200	Yeah.
822200	827200	Something that's going to bring in more focused revenue, I reckon.
827200	828200	Yeah.
828200	833560	And it's really about not just having exclusives, but big exclusives.
833560	834560	Exactly.
834560	835560	Yeah.
835560	839760	And I mean, maybe that's where they've discovered that that's really excuse me, their bread
839760	840760	and butter.
840760	848960	I mean, I am I'm really in the place where I kind of want to just wait and see, you know.
848960	849960	Sure.
849960	858960	But I mean, I think they're going to lose opportunity with less focus on the indie.
858960	866440	So all I'm hoping for is that, you know, they they still have that support, at least a degree
866440	869520	of support for for that particular group.
869520	870520	Yeah.
870520	874880	And, you know, if Sony is going to come up with some kind of answer to Microsoft Game
874880	880040	Pass, it would really behoove them to, you know, if the strength of, you know, the smaller
880040	886040	the the BNC games, for lack of a better description, if that's not going to be able to really come
886040	890080	from Sony's first party, then they're really going to have to form those relationships,
890080	894320	not necessarily buying in total acquisitions, but those relationships to really help with
894320	896300	the BNC and the indie stuff.
896300	900920	Because I, you know, and I don't think it is I wouldn't want to read into this that
900920	904280	Sony's turning their back on indies, because not necessarily.
904280	907620	I mean, that could be part of their larger, you know, publishing and distribution.
907620	910680	This is about what they're doing in house.
910680	917480	But I mean, if they don't try to get some exclusives in that area with the BNC, I worry
917480	921300	that they're going to miss out on the next Minecraft, the next Among Us, the next Five
921300	924580	Nights at Freddy's, which, well, to be fair, they do have a Five Nights at Freddy's game
924580	925580	coming.
925580	927840	But so maybe maybe that answers my question.
927840	932200	But, you know, they might miss out on the next like huge Twitch phenomenon.
932200	933200	You know what I mean?
933200	934200	Yeah.
935120	938640	But it's, you know, but the only ones that they're going to have to blame for that would
938640	939640	be themselves.
939640	940640	Yeah.
940640	943520	Well, and then and they will survive whatever happens.
943520	946360	So, you know, they'll just regroup and start over.
946360	948760	And all those games you're talking about aren't first party games anyways.
948760	952560	They're I mean, you may have some license by them, but they're all being developed by
952560	953560	third parties.
953560	958840	It just sometimes they may be console exclusives or something like that for a time period.
958840	961260	But that's not Sony themselves, actually.
961260	962880	But the partnerships, but the partnerships.
962880	965760	That's what I yeah, they can kind of supplement with that.
965760	968840	But I'm going back to kind of what dark soccer was saying is about, you know, that's a that's
968840	970880	a that's going to be a problem with them.
970880	973760	You know, I saw an interesting article this week and I see chat comments, too.
973760	974760	I'm not ignoring you guys.
974760	976240	I promise I'll get to your chat comments as well.
976240	979400	There's a lot to devour with this.
979400	984680	I saw an interesting story this week about how Sony needs to get an answer to Game Pass,
984680	985680	basically.
985680	987200	So where is Sony's answer to Game Pass?
987200	991120	And I is in some Facebook community, I mean, I actually replied and I said, I'm starting
991120	994000	to think Sony doesn't need an answer to Game Pass.
994000	996480	Sony needs an answer to Phil Spencer.
996480	999720	And I don't want to sound like a fanboy.
999720	1005600	And I would hope my, you know, 19 year resume of this show and so forth show that, you know,
1005600	1007760	I do embrace all the gaming systems.
1007760	1008760	I love them.
1008760	1011720	And I also scold them when they need a little bit scolding.
1011720	1017460	But I'm starting to get a little bit worried about the leadership.
1017460	1018920	It's not we're not in a.
1018920	1020920	And I will say we're not in a dire situation yet.
1020920	1025160	We're not in a Don Mattrick is driving this into the ground situation yet.
1025160	1029560	But we've got the tone deafness on backwards compatibility.
1029560	1035480	We've got the fact that we didn't foresee Game Passes of success and we don't really
1035480	1037600	have an answer to that.
1037600	1042840	Or if you want to say, but PlayStation now, OK, PlayStation now is not positioned appropriately
1042840	1048580	to compete with Game Pass because not cloud gaming is not being embraced by the masses
1048580	1052220	yet the way I think people thought it would be at this point.
1052220	1057820	And now we have this story, which sure sounds a lot like Sony just wants to do blockbusters
1057820	1059660	and forget the little stuff.
1059660	1063020	I don't think that's 100 percent the case again.
1063020	1065440	There's a partnership, but it's that perception, right?
1065440	1068220	And it is starting to make me think.
1068220	1074500	Maybe it seems like a lot of this weird stuff with Sony sure happens in the past couple
1074500	1078140	of years since we changed who's at the top.
1078140	1079940	And that's very important and can trickle down.
1079940	1082760	Meanwhile, you've got Microsoft and Phil Spencer.
1082760	1089440	And I mean, he he he knows his shit and he's like he's they've been swinging and hitting
1089440	1091340	it out of the oh, the MLB thing.
1091340	1092540	That's just from last week.
1092540	1096500	That's another one where it's like, how did Sony let that happen?
1096500	1097500	Yes.
1097500	1099800	I know it was the MLB that actually.
1099800	1102500	But how did Sony let that happen?
1102500	1104740	You know, I mean, because they didn't have a response.
1104740	1105740	Sorry, Loki.
1105740	1107020	Oh, I was going to say.
1107020	1112120	And also, since we were talking about them being focused on blockbusters, I mean, look
1112120	1116580	at some of the games that are coming out on from Microsoft or I guess some of their studios
1116580	1123540	like Rare, like, for example, they developed and published Battletoads.
1123540	1124820	Who would have thought that would happen?
1124820	1131900	We're not going to see a jumping flash coming from Sony any time soon, because it's not
1131900	1136220	popular and it's not making a ton of money or winning awards.
1136220	1138100	And so that's something that they're not going to pursue.
1138100	1140780	They're going to pursue more of these cinematic games.
1140780	1144980	And honestly, I don't know, I'm just kind of bored of that stuff.
1144980	1145980	Yeah.
1145980	1151180	Let me get to some of the comments from chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, because
1151180	1155260	I don't want to make it sound like I'm ignoring, sorry, Quest Buster saying that was sad.
1155260	1159180	The studio that saw The Last of Us remake project as a way to break away from assisting
1159180	1164500	with games to doing bigger projects aimed at eventually making their own down the line.
1164500	1169500	And Quest Buster says to add to this, Days Gone Well did apparently did well commercially,
1169500	1172700	but critically, it wasn't enough to justify a sequel.
1172700	1176280	SSG100Matt, very interesting here.
1176280	1178220	This feels very Disney.
1178220	1181560	They're only interested in titles that will net massive returns.
1181560	1186460	So if that game is great, but doesn't make that massive return, they'll kill any sequel
1186460	1187460	plans.
1187460	1193700	Just puts a lot of pressure on those titles to do massively well.
1193700	1198540	And Bobby Blackwell is talking about the whole MLB thing, saying, well, Sony let that happen
1198540	1202140	because if they didn't, they wouldn't be able to make the MLB game anymore.
1202140	1208140	And we'd be seeing EA Sports triple play 21, MLB totally strong arm Sony on that one.
1208140	1211220	Yes, but I get that part.
1211220	1214540	I'm not questioning why did the game go to Xbox?
1214540	1217500	Why did the game go to Xbox Game Pass?
1217500	1222040	And okay, sure, you might say it's the MLB strong arm, but I would question why didn't
1222080	1228440	Sony see that Game Pass was the competitor that it is because they've had the chance
1228440	1233680	much earlier down the line and have something of their own to offer the Major League Baseball
1233680	1234680	team.
1234680	1237840	You should put the game on this service because, okay, we're going to be multi platform, but
1237840	1241360	Sony is still the home of this game through this service.
1241360	1248960	That is what I'm saying is the missed opportunity and that it went over to Game Pass as a result.
1248960	1253320	And Bobby says, Sony came out this week and said they had no say in the Game Pass decision.
1253320	1254320	Yes.
1254320	1260960	And last week I said that would happen sort of, because I said, you're going to have all
1260960	1265880	these YouTubes and all these podcasts that are only going to read it in the headline.
1265880	1270680	Sony put a game on Game Pass, even though, you know, I know we all know that talked about
1270680	1271680	this.
1271680	1273280	That's not really what happened.
1273280	1277280	But perception is that Sony let it happen.
1277280	1282280	And so that's why Sony had to come out and say, we didn't do it.
1282280	1284520	Because you have all these other tweets.
1284520	1287760	You have these Facebook comments, you have everything else that's like, Sony's putting
1287760	1291160	a game on Game Pass, lol.
1291160	1295320	So anyway, yeah, let's see.
1295320	1298960	Other comments here.
1298960	1301360	DJ Rama S says, I think it's a Sony thing.
1301360	1305260	A lot of games that come out on PlayStation first will end up coming out on Xbox sometime
1305260	1307300	later as a digital release.
1307300	1308300	Sure.
1308300	1312740	You know, especially a lot of like the Final Fantasy stuff, although Final Fantasy 7 Remake,
1312740	1316060	we you know, the year is up that it should have been an exclusive and we're not seeing
1316060	1317060	that on Microsoft.
1317060	1319140	So it's not happening everywhere.
1319140	1321500	But yes, you know, we have seen some things.
1321500	1327300	I want to I'm trying to think if it goes vice versa to have we seen something that came
1327300	1333640	out on Xbox that then showed up on Sony later on drawing a blank.
1333640	1335480	Was Tomb Raider exclusive or is that Sony?
1335480	1336480	Bingo!
1336480	1337480	No, it was the sequel.
1337480	1338480	It was Rise of the Tomb Raider.
1338480	1341480	It was that way.
1341480	1343080	That was a while ago at this point.
1343080	1347900	And I think that was Microsoft buying time for all the studio acquisitions they were
1347900	1348900	doing.
1348900	1349960	OK, Cuphead.
1349960	1350960	That's a little bit better.
1350960	1353240	Yeah, that's good.
1353240	1355200	Anyway.
1355200	1358320	Are the Ori games on PlayStation, asks Act F. No, they are not.
1358320	1359600	They're on Switch.
1359600	1360600	That's a whole other thing.
1360600	1361600	All right.
1362480	1364120	Sony making some interesting moves.
1364120	1369720	You know, again, I don't necessarily see this particular headline as doom and gloom.
1369720	1374760	But when you kind of put the whole thing together, it really does look like Sony's leadership
1374760	1378500	is going in a very interesting new direction.
1378500	1383560	And I'm not sure it's going to be a net positive.
1383560	1386640	At the end of the day, we'll let the game speak for themselves and perhaps I will be
1386640	1387640	wrong.
1387640	1388640	And that's fine.
1388680	1394800	I just worry all this stuff about no game pass competitor, no backwards compatibility
1394800	1396080	and some of these other decisions there.
1396080	1399320	And now, you know, now we don't have, you know, as many of the pet projects.
1399320	1401920	I just worry some of these things are going to come back and bite them in the butt.
1401920	1406520	And I again, I think the MLB thing, although, yes, there's other factors at play there,
1406520	1407920	I think is an example of that.
1407920	1411080	And I don't think that's the last time we're going to hear something like that.
1411080	1413760	So anyway, let's move on.
1413760	1416480	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing
1416480	1417480	this week.
1418320	1420080	How was your gaming week?
1420080	1421560	It was different.
1421560	1428160	I did, of course, play Animal Crossing and I'm playing Wordscape still, but I started
1428160	1431680	playing around in Dead by Daylight and I've done the tutorials.
1431680	1437640	And sadly, I need to rethink my streaming setup because I have to play it full screen
1437640	1440660	to do it through Stadia so I wouldn't be able to watch chat.
1440660	1445080	So I've had to uninstall like some extensions I did to play it windowed because it still
1445080	1446080	won't work.
1447080	1450600	Some people use their phones to monitor or like a tablet to monitor.
1450600	1451600	Well, that's what I'm saying.
1451600	1455120	I'm going to be using my iPad to monitor the chat.
1455120	1463120	So I also have updated Dead by Daylight Mobile on my iPad and I'm going to give that one
1463120	1464120	a go too.
1464120	1469040	Actually, can we take a step back because you kind of said something very quickly there,
1469040	1472440	but it's something we haven't really gone into a lot on this show.
1472440	1475680	You mentioned that you were playing this on Stadia and I think that's kind of interesting
1475680	1480640	because you know, I think I've talked about, I'm not a big fan of the bandwidth conception,
1480640	1483480	all that and so forth, but you're actually in there.
1483480	1484480	You bought the game.
1484480	1485480	You're using Stadia.
1485480	1487320	How is Stadia itself working for you?
1487320	1488800	Are you enjoying that?
1488800	1495280	Well, all I've done is play that game and it might be enough that I will be going back
1495280	1504320	to paying for the full account for the, what do they call it, pro.
1504320	1505960	But it's played really smoothly.
1505960	1509200	It looks great on my Mac.
1509200	1512680	So I haven't really had any problems with it.
1512680	1515400	I haven't played an online game yet.
1515400	1521960	I've just been trying to get the game worked out for me, but I haven't had any kind of
1521960	1525800	latency playing on that or anything too crazy so far.
1525800	1526800	It's been pretty good.
1526800	1527800	Yeah.
1527800	1530160	I'll be curious how that continues to work out for you.
1530160	1533080	And Bobby in chat says, Stadia, the technology works great.
1533080	1534080	That is true.
1534080	1537860	A lot of these things with Stadia was never really about the technology, it was just kind
1537860	1539720	of about how they're rolling it out.
1539720	1541040	So there is that.
1541040	1547080	But the nice thing about Dead by Daylight in particular is that it's cross-play.
1547080	1553560	So you're going to be right in there with everybody else on Steam, Microsoft Store,
1553560	1555580	Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, all of it.
1555580	1559080	So you don't have to worry about anything like that.
1559080	1564240	And you also make a very interesting use case for Stadia about the whole playing it
1564240	1569920	on a Mac, which, of course, there's games on the Mac, but we know that there's been
1569920	1574320	a disconnect for some time about how many games are on PC versus Mac.
1574320	1577140	But this is a very interesting bridge.
1577140	1582920	And it almost makes me think as more and more cloud gaming rolls out, as more and more fast
1582920	1589480	internet becomes accessible, I think these days of, you know, whatever system is not
1589480	1592480	going to matter as much as much as cloud gaming starts to get bigger.
1592480	1593800	But I guess that's a ways off.
1593800	1596880	But you do make a very interesting use case.
1596880	1603600	And honestly, now, I mean, I would hate for this to go away and leave me with no way to
1603600	1604600	play my game.
1604600	1605600	Yeah.
1605600	1606600	Yeah.
1606600	1607600	That would be.
1607600	1608600	Yeah.
1608600	1610880	What would happen if Google Stadia were to suddenly close?
1610880	1611880	I don't.
1611880	1612880	I have one.
1612880	1615920	I think you'd have a couple of years while a transition plays out.
1615920	1620560	And I think Google would kind of owe you a redemption of the game on another platform
1620560	1624560	or something like or a place you could download it on another platform.
1624560	1625560	But who knows?
1625560	1626560	Who knows?
1626560	1627560	One would think.
1627560	1630400	Yeah, I guess Google's not talking about it, because why would they?
1630400	1633920	They don't want to talk about what happens when it goes under, because from their perspective,
1633920	1635320	it's never going under.
1635320	1636320	So yeah.
1636320	1637320	So they hope.
1637320	1638320	Yeah.
1638680	1643760	Everybody frantically downloading their PlayStation 1 games on their PlayStation 3 and Vita and
1643760	1646080	all that stuff would beg to differ.
1646080	1647280	Right.
1647280	1648280	So there is that.
1648280	1653800	But I've been, for the most part, I mean, for the bits I've been able to do on it, I've
1653800	1656080	been pretty darn happy with it.
1656080	1657080	Mm hmm.
1657080	1658080	Great.
1658080	1659080	All right.
1659080	1660080	Let's move on to Loki.
1660080	1661080	How was your gaming week?
1661080	1667000	It has been Minecraft, as I kind of mentioned, and I streamed a little bit on Friday.
1667000	1668000	I rated you.
1668000	1669000	It was good fun.
1669000	1670000	Yes.
1670000	1671000	Yes.
1671000	1672000	It was great.
1672000	1675840	It's hard streaming when you're in a kitchen and there's a cat screaming at you and everybody's
1675840	1681640	asleep and you have to be quiet because you don't have a sound isolated place to be.
1681640	1682640	But yeah.
1682640	1683840	So I've been playing on this.
1683840	1689080	I got invited to this server that mimics.
1689080	1693560	I want to say mimicking, but it's emulating, I guess, what HermaCraft does.
1693560	1696340	They're a pretty popular group of Minecraft streamers.
1696340	1701180	So it's a bunch of people that are kind of getting in the streaming, playing together
1701180	1703060	about 30 people.
1703060	1706900	And it's a survival multiplayer server.
1706900	1709420	And I haven't played Java in forever.
1709420	1710500	I'm used to Bedrock.
1710500	1717700	So I've been playing with an expaterons to use my joystick to actually, or joystick.
1717700	1719500	What am I in the 80s?
1719500	1723920	My gamepad to actually be able to play that because normally it's keyboard and mouse and
1723920	1725980	I don't play keyboard and mouse.
1725980	1726900	It's too hard for me.
1726900	1729900	So it's been working out pretty good.
1729900	1736180	And with the shaders now, since I'm playing Java, oh my God is so gorgeous.
1736180	1738020	It is incredibly.
1738020	1742260	One thing I noticed right when I rated you, I was like, he got the 4K pack that never
1742260	1743260	came out.
1743260	1745260	I know it's the Nvidia thing.
1745260	1746740	Yeah, that whole thing.
1746740	1748260	It's not even Nvidia.
1748260	1752580	It's just like, it's just the built-in Optifine shaders or it's BSD is I think is what it
1752580	1753580	is.
1753580	1755620	And it just looks so nice.
1756340	1761740	This is how it should be on Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5.
1761740	1763660	It should look that nice.
1763660	1769900	And I don't understand, like Java's really the least optimized, I think as far as graphics
1769900	1770900	goes.
1770900	1773340	But man, it is so beautiful.
1773340	1774980	It's such a beautiful game.
1774980	1779860	The only issue I have is the mob sound is so loud and I don't know what it is if it's
1779860	1782700	just I'm used to Bedrock or whatever.
1782700	1786540	I've turned it down to 50% and actually lower, but it's just like screaming.
1786540	1790500	I went into a dungeon the other day or close to a dungeon.
1790500	1792900	It was just so loud.
1792900	1797620	But what I'm hoping to do is I'm hoping to be able to turn this into like playing regularly,
1797620	1801300	uploading to YouTube regularly, doing some streaming and stuff like that and actually
1801300	1807140	get into the whole like streaming and content creation on a regular basis.
1807140	1811820	That's my goal because I hate my corporate job so much.
1811820	1815660	I will do anything to get out of it, anything at all.
1815660	1820860	So I'll try this for a little bit, but it's going to be a labor of love for a long time.
1820860	1821860	Look at that.
1821860	1822860	Look at this show.
1822860	1824300	It's just like, yeah.
1824300	1825300	So it's fun.
1825300	1827540	Eighteen years and we're breaking even.
1827540	1831220	Yeah, I'm having a lot of fun with it.
1831220	1833260	I haven't met anybody on the server yet.
1833260	1836500	I've been playing for like three days, but like, I'm kind of far away from everybody
1836500	1838620	and they had a month's head start.
1838620	1842700	So everything's been kind of ransacked already, which kind of sucks.
1842700	1845660	It puts me a little bit behind, but I'm slowly getting there.
1845660	1849540	I've been just grinding, but it'll be fine eventually.
1849540	1853860	If it's anything like Hermitcraft, it's going to be, you know, trying to build these giant
1853860	1858980	builds throughout the course of the season, which I think they're planning on probably
1858980	1862620	updating in when one seventeen comes out.
1862620	1865700	So that's probably going to be in the summer sometime, probably at least like three or
1865700	1866700	four months.
1866700	1868220	But it's been fun.
1868820	1870340	I mean, everyone seems nice so far.
1870340	1875180	I just haven't actually played with anybody, but I'm enjoying it and I'm excited about
1875180	1876180	it.
1876180	1877180	Awesome.
1877180	1881060	And just to the folks watching on Twitch know, Loghi's audio is coming through fine, but
1881060	1884780	your video's like very choppy, like only a few frames a second.
1884780	1888220	I don't know if that's the video you're running in the background or what, but yeah, it's
1888220	1889820	probably other things.
1889820	1893420	I think I still have, oh yeah, I still have Streamlabs OBS from earlier.
1893420	1896220	It's not doing anything.
1896220	1897220	I'll just close this thing.
1897220	1898220	Yeah, it's still my...
1898220	1899220	Let's see it.
1899220	1900220	Oh, did it make a difference?
1900220	1901220	How about that?
1901220	1902220	It made a difference.
1902220	1903220	No?
1903220	1904220	Well, a little bit.
1904220	1905220	I don't know.
1905220	1906220	A little bit.
1906220	1907220	I don't know.
1907220	1908220	Yeah, it seems to be better now.
1908220	1909220	Yeah, a little bit.
1909220	1910220	You're a little lagged, but that's all right.
1910220	1911220	It'll probably just take a minute to catch up.
1911220	1915220	If you probably close your camera and restart it thing, it'll probably catch up.
1915220	1916220	All right.
1916220	1917980	Meanwhile, I'll talk about my gaming week.
1917980	1919540	So I've played a few games this week.
1919540	1922620	I've been continuing in No Man's Sky, which I talked about last week.
1922620	1929220	You know, I'd really started that five nights of streaming the Expeditions mode, and I streamed
1929220	1930740	one more night on Friday.
1930740	1932660	That's the one I rated Loki after that.
1932660	1935580	So I've been continuing on the Expeditions, and I've gotten to the point where I'm playing
1935580	1939300	a little bit off stream because some of it was starting to feel a little bit grindy and
1939300	1941420	I didn't think it would make for an interesting stream.
1941420	1944300	And also just the fact that, you know what, sometimes I just want to be a fat vegetable
1944300	1948520	on the couch and play the game and not have to worry about being on and interacting with
1948520	1949660	folks and all that stuff.
1949700	1954140	I love doing it when I'm in the mood for it, but sometimes I just want to, you know, chill
1954140	1956380	and explore space.
1956380	1957380	That's for sure.
1957380	1963420	You know, sometimes just, you know, chill out and just enjoy space and not necessarily
1963420	1966140	have to perform.
1966140	1968260	So what else?
1968260	1972700	I've been playing Dead by Daylight still.
1972700	1974860	Thanks to my murder sister.
1974860	1978100	We have new characters in the house.
1978100	1981020	My murder sister, of course, is Dark Sakura because she keeps funny.
1981020	1983180	I think I said I said my murder mom.
1983180	1984180	That sounds a little creepy.
1984180	1987660	So murder sisters a little better because she actually is a sister.
1987660	1993620	And you bought me the obviously you bought me Freddy and you know how that went.
1993620	1996340	That became like Freddy's my main killer now.
1996340	2001900	And I had a hell of a game like yesterday morning where these little assholes, like
2001900	2006280	three of them were together and they were just there to bully the killer by sabotaging
2006280	2007280	the hook.
2007600	2011440	And as soon as I picked someone up, the other two would run to the nearest hooks and sabotage
2011440	2012440	them.
2012440	2013920	And they kept doing this over and over.
2013920	2017080	I four killed them and I was so happy about it.
2017080	2020080	And I had to be I had to be a complete dick to do it.
2020080	2022680	I had to tunnel one of them completely.
2022680	2023680	But it was worth it.
2023680	2025860	It was so worth it.
2025860	2028640	Because when you're doing that, you can't really work on gens.
2028640	2031380	So at some point they had to run out and work on gens.
2031380	2034880	And I was able to kind of time it right so I could hook one of them and tunnel them and
2034880	2036800	not let them get rescued anyway.
2036800	2042120	So I was very naughty and kind of violated the code that you're not really supposed to
2042120	2043120	tunnel survivors.
2043120	2044120	But you know what?
2044120	2045120	They were dicks.
2045120	2046120	They deserved it.
2046120	2047120	They were being dicks.
2047120	2048120	Exactly.
2048120	2049880	When you start trolling, then I'm going to troll.
2049880	2050880	That's that.
2050880	2054040	So question for you, Rob, do you play with a keyboard or do you play with a controller?
2054040	2055540	I play with a controller.
2055540	2056540	And it always...
2056540	2057540	That's what I'm thinking about doing.
2057540	2059000	It always impresses Alan.
2059000	2062840	He's like, I don't know how the hell you play that game on controller.
2062880	2068400	Well, it's just that I've been having some problems, especially when I have to run.
2068400	2072280	This is only during the survivor one because I don't think the killers run, do they?
2072280	2073280	No.
2073280	2077880	Well, I mean, you might have somebody that gets a burst of speed, like the hillbilly
2077880	2082160	uses the chainsaw and has a burst of speed, but not like running in the sense like survivors
2082160	2083160	do.
2083160	2084160	No.
2084160	2085160	Yeah.
2085160	2089460	But it's just sort of like the hard time I'm having is hitting, for example, to hold control
2089460	2093420	to crouch or something where I think it would be better having shoulder buttons for something
2093420	2094420	like that.
2094420	2095420	Yeah.
2095420	2096840	And actually, um, the default is it's a little on Xbox.
2096840	2100420	The bumper left is a run and the bumper right is crouch.
2100420	2101420	Okay.
2101420	2107140	So, well, and I actually, I've got a stadia controller because I got stadia thing.
2107140	2108140	Yeah.
2108140	2109140	Check it out.
2109140	2114440	The only thing, the only thing about controller, it's, you can't flip a 180 and sometimes survivors
2114440	2118740	will loop you like they'll run around you type of thing to try to, cause, um, in dead
2118740	2121680	by daylight, the killers have to play first person.
2121680	2123880	The survivors play third person.
2123880	2128760	And that actually is a very interesting dynamic because the survivors will use it to kind
2128760	2132760	of like run a loop around the killer, literally a loop around the killer so that the killer
2132760	2134280	kind of swings and misses.
2134280	2139040	And now the killer's running the other way and on a controller that sucks because you
2139040	2142480	have to hold the stick down while you turn around, right?
2142480	2144320	It's fast, but it's enough.
2144320	2147520	Whereas on keyboard and mouse, you'd just be like, you can just like fling around real
2147520	2148520	fast.
2148520	2149520	Right?
2149520	2151020	So that's the one down there.
2151020	2156540	I really wish they would make it so that if you click R3 or whatever it is, if you click
2156540	2158020	that stick, then it flips.
2158020	2161020	I would be very happy if they did that.
2161020	2165780	So is it like an, uh, like something that you hit on the keyboard to flip or, or what?
2165780	2168660	Um, no, it's just somebody would drag their mouse that fast.
2168660	2171340	You know how, like with a mouse and keyboard, you can do a quick swipe of the mouse.
2171340	2172620	You'd spin around real fast.
2172620	2177500	Well, see, I use a track ball, so I don't know that I would have that ability anyway.
2177500	2179360	Oh, um, yeah, I don't know.
2179360	2181360	It might be a little different.
2181360	2183360	So yeah, it might be moot.
2183360	2184640	It doesn't ruin the game or anything.
2184640	2188500	I still play it, but it is, it is one of those things where, you know, Alan is like, how
2188500	2189500	do you do that?
2189500	2192480	But at the same time, the controller, I think also has a lot of advantages as well.
2192480	2196360	I think in the, in the way I move, um, but anyway, I digress.
2196360	2203640	Well, and also the, remember, I used to play, um, Final Fantasy 11 with a controller for
2203640	2204640	a long time.
2204640	2205880	They did macros and everything.
2205880	2206880	Sure.
2207260	2209940	Technically that's what the game was built for on the PS2.
2209940	2210940	Yeah.
2210940	2211940	Yeah.
2211940	2215860	So, um, I've also, uh, been playing in Dead by Daylight.
2215860	2217040	You bought me the spirit.
2217040	2219140	So I did do a match or two with her.
2219140	2220140	Um, it was rough.
2220140	2221140	I'm not going to lie.
2221140	2222140	It was rough.
2222140	2225220	I think I still need some talents to make her more useful.
2225220	2229860	I like her in theory, but it's going to like, it's not like with Freddy where Freddy was
2229860	2230860	great right away.
2230860	2231860	Yeah.
2231860	2232860	Yeah.
2232860	2235060	So this would be a little different.
2235060	2239720	And on top of that, I was reading that she does actually have quite the significant curve
2239720	2240720	to learn.
2240720	2241720	So yeah.
2241720	2242720	Yeah.
2242720	2248560	Um, and I think with the last bit of money, cause, uh, murder mom sent or murder sister
2248560	2253520	sent 10 bucks, uh, to Alan for, uh, him to get the trickster, which happened.
2253520	2255460	And then that was leftover money for me.
2255460	2259240	So I haven't spent it yet, but I will also probably buy trickster just because I want
2259240	2262800	his talents and what is it?
2262800	2263800	Starstruck or something.
2263940	2267120	Starstruck is pretty incredible and they're rebalancing him next week.
2267120	2270040	So cause he has, he's perceived a little weak right now.
2270040	2272140	So they're going to kind of buff him this week.
2272140	2277340	Well, I just, I think he's absolutely entertaining to watch people play him.
2277340	2278340	Yeah.
2278340	2283680	So I did on top of that, his blades are actually kind of unfair because you can do so many
2283680	2284680	of them.
2284680	2285680	Yeah.
2285680	2286680	Yeah.
2286680	2289100	Um, I did one more survivor match.
2289100	2293240	You know, I never play survivor, but I did play and I went up against trickster, uh,
2293240	2295540	and we escaped the trick.
2295540	2296820	The trickster just was bad.
2296820	2300940	Like I had, there's no, it's not a nice way for me to say it, but yeah, new, a newer killer.
2300940	2303760	They did not leave the center house at all.
2303760	2306220	Like they only stuck in that until the exit gates were already open.
2306220	2307940	It was pretty like, what are you doing anyway?
2307940	2308940	All right.
2308940	2310100	This isn't a dead by daylight podcast though.
2310100	2315940	I mean it could be, but well, I actually dark soccer, I really think, um, you and I should
2315940	2319420	do a stream and I think we'll do a surprise stream.
2319420	2320620	We're not going to date it.
2320620	2325400	We'll do it when we feel like it, but you and I should do like, um, OLR bonus stage
2325400	2330860	or OLR extra stage where, uh, I play some dead by daylight and you can, uh, provide
2330860	2337240	commentary and all that stuff because you already are more into the lore in this game
2337240	2338240	than I am.
2338240	2341600	Cause you were like, have you heard about this theory about how Nia is the entity?
2341600	2348920	And I'm like, girl, girl, I maybe read two bios and then I jumped in and played the game.
2349460	2357060	Honestly though, if you go in and write on all the bios and stuff are on the Wiki and
2357060	2363940	it's honestly a very well concocted story on top of that, especially how they blended
2363940	2369380	in like the DLC stuff, the licensed characters and whatnot.
2369380	2375120	And I was just randomly just looking up stuff online and I found a fanfic and I read it
2375120	2381180	from beginning to end all 30 chapters of it that was talking of, it was about like
2381180	2383900	the, cause you know, the pig was Amanda from Saul.
2383900	2384900	Right.
2384900	2385900	Of course.
2385900	2386900	Yeah.
2386900	2388940	It was talking about her regaining her humanity and something and becoming a survivor and
2388940	2393940	blah, blah, blah, different new things, but the way that they blended, uh, like as crossover
2393940	2396400	fiction with the saw universe.
2396400	2401240	And then of course there was Ashley, there was blended with evil dead, but it was the
2401240	2406600	way that these lores can be combined and integrated.
2406600	2408580	It was actually pretty cool.
2408580	2413440	And it was really that story that had me really thinking a bit more about you're actually
2413440	2416960	dealing with a multiverse in the form of the entities realm.
2416960	2417960	Right.
2417960	2418960	Yes.
2418960	2419960	Yeah.
2419960	2424180	And, and so I was, I I've been digging into the character lore and the history of them
2424180	2427860	and the characters are actually pretty well flushed out.
2427860	2430780	And I feel really sorry for some of the killers.
2431580	2434880	It's interesting, you know, I'm sorry, I just said, we're not going to talk about this,
2434880	2436820	but I have to say this.
2436820	2442180	Dead by daylight is, is an interesting phenomenon because it's not the best looking game.
2442180	2446880	It's not really even mechanically the best multiplayer game out there.
2446880	2451980	It's not like it's, it's not really the best game out there, honestly, let's be real.
2451980	2453920	It's not the best game on the market right now.
2453920	2456400	It's the fun you have, but it's fun.
2456400	2458480	And I don't, you all know how I feel about horror movies.
2458480	2462440	I'm not even that into it, but it's, it's oddly fun.
2462440	2463440	So and it's not gross.
2463440	2464440	That's the other thing.
2464440	2465440	I just don't like gross horror.
2465440	2466920	And honestly, it's not, this game isn't gross.
2466920	2467920	It's not that bad.
2467920	2468920	Not really.
2468920	2472020	I mean, there's no actual like wound when you're on the hook.
2472020	2475760	Even when Pyramid Head like does the sword and goes flush and swipes someone.
2475760	2476760	That's all.
2476760	2479440	It's, it's like, it's like Mortal Kombat three level fatality.
2479440	2483920	Like it's not like, like Mortal Kombat X when things are getting too real.
2483920	2484920	It's still very cartoony.
2484920	2491400	Like one of the memento mori, you know, which is the kill move, which by the way, it's a
2491400	2497240	fatality in fiction is when people call, when people refer to terminology that a player
2497240	2501600	knows as something that the characters know that annoys me.
2501600	2508960	So anyway, going back to, going back to that, you know, even while like the, their mores
2508960	2512300	are pretty, pretty brutal looking.
2512300	2513300	They're not gory.
2513300	2514300	Yeah, exactly.
2514300	2517860	And by the way, I think that Ghostface has the best mori to sing.
2517860	2519420	That's what a lot of people say.
2519420	2522020	Bobby Block Wolfenchatz reminds us of a key point.
2522020	2523420	Games are supposed to be fun.
2523420	2529240	And DJ Rama S says this, and yeah, there's a certain X factor about Dead by Daylight
2529240	2531160	that just, it's just fun to play.
2531160	2535240	And I think, and the reason why I bring this up after what Dark Sakura said, I think some
2535240	2539320	of that whole, like, I love that comparison of it's the multiverse.
2539320	2542740	It's because this game came out in 2016.
2542740	2545880	People were barely talking about it because everybody was playing that Friday the 13th
2545880	2552480	game at first, but then they got Michael Myers, then they got Bubba from Texas Chainsaw Massacre,
2552480	2557920	then they got Ghostface, then they got Pyramid Head, then they got Amanda from Saw.
2557920	2560360	And I think you nailed it.
2560360	2565320	This is now like 80s, 90s horror movie multiverse.
2565320	2568000	The only thing they're missing is Jason.
2568000	2569000	They're missing Jason.
2569000	2570000	That's it.
2570000	2572820	That's obviously a whole other complicated licensing thing.
2572820	2576660	And I'm sure that is the end game for Dead by Daylight is they'd love to get Jason, but
2576660	2577660	that's very complicated.
2577660	2578660	But anyway, go ahead.
2578660	2579660	You say the demogorgon.
2579660	2585660	But I forgot what I was going to say, but I did actually, I linked you a while back
2585660	2591380	some parody animation where Jason keeps showing up in the killer shack, which by the way,
2591380	2594660	the killers group call themselves the hookers.
2594660	2595660	That's what they do.
2595660	2596660	They put people on hooks.
2596660	2599000	The parody videos are hilarious too.
2599000	2603520	And it's just, I like the fandom that's built up around it too, but I've been watching a
2603520	2611640	lot of people playing and trying to get my, um, get a feel for how other people play before
2611640	2613740	I jump in and do it myself.
2613740	2618720	And I'm playing through the tutorial a couple of times, uh, to get my, my hang on the controller
2618720	2620880	before, before I play through it.
2620880	2621880	Yeah.
2621880	2625680	It's, it's, it's a lot to learn at first, but if the matchmaking does you right, then
2625680	2629340	you'll be matched with a killer that doesn't know what they're doing either or vice versa.
2629340	2631100	So it'll, it'll be, uh, be good.
2631100	2632100	Anyway.
2632100	2633100	Sorry.
2633100	2636940	I do want to move on another topic, but just the whole idea of, I think this game is, is
2636940	2640920	hitting it right now because it has created that multiverse of like eighties and nineties
2640920	2643460	horror movies, which a lot of people grew up on.
2643460	2645200	And what's fascinating about dead by daylight.
2645200	2651240	It has a huge queer following on Twitch, huge, but I was blown away.
2651240	2657140	There are a lot of queer individuals that I, that really identify and grew up with that
2657140	2661580	eighties and nineties, you know, horror movie, because a lot kind of identify with the final
2661580	2662620	girl syndrome.
2662620	2665700	We can do a whole other podcast on this and I'm sure other podcasts exists.
2665700	2671180	Uh, and it's weird for me to talk about because I'm like that I'm gay, but I'm not as into
2671180	2674660	horror movies as everybody else is, but I get it.
2674660	2677180	Like I listen to other people and why they enjoy it once.
2677180	2678180	Yeah.
2678180	2679180	Yeah.
2679180	2680300	I can't watch gratuitous gore, you know.
2680360	2685160	I liked cube, even though that movie's probably one of the goriest I've ever seen.
2685160	2692520	Hypercube to me is not a great movie, but I love it because I like the theory behind
2692520	2693520	it.
2693520	2694520	You know what I mean?
2694520	2695520	Yeah.
2695520	2696520	That's yeah.
2696520	2697520	I don't like horror movies, but I love sci-fi.
2697520	2701240	Cube was such a low budget movie.
2701240	2703480	It basically used the same set over and over.
2703480	2704480	Oh yeah.
2704480	2709680	Have you watched the, um, didn't I saw the, they like, uh, the Japanese have remade cube.
2710060	2711060	Oh, I heard about that.
2711060	2712060	Yeah.
2712060	2713060	Yeah.
2713060	2714060	I heard about that.
2714060	2715060	Yeah.
2715060	2716060	I'm going to have to find that.
2716060	2717060	Yeah.
2717060	2718060	Anyway.
2718060	2719060	Yeah.
2719060	2720060	I'm with business lamp in our chat room over at a twitch.tv slash vog network who says
2720060	2721060	horror movies.
2721060	2722060	Scally.
2722060	2723060	Yeah.
2723060	2724060	That's me.
2724060	2728260	When I saw the descent in the theater, let me tell you, I was clenched everywhere the
2728260	2733500	entire time that movie that that is the first time I have cried.
2733500	2734500	That is a movie.
2734500	2737900	That's the first time I've ever cried from being so scared and scared in a movie that
2737900	2738900	I'm telling you
2739120	2744880	this is one movies ever giving me, given me, uh, nightmares and it was poltergeist three.
2744880	2747040	I was afraid of mirrors for awhile.
2747040	2748040	Yeah.
2748040	2750960	Uh, as she went ahead and Matt and chat says, there's sleepaway camp.
2750960	2751960	Okay.
2751960	2756560	See some horror movie, some horror movies are so like, that's, that's the kind of horror
2756560	2761480	movie I enjoy because that is more literal camp, not like just in the name, but that
2761480	2762880	is a camp movie.
2762880	2768160	And that's why I like that movie because it's like, it's like pink flamingos bad, you know,
2768160	2769160	but it's fun.
2769160	2770160	Anyway.
2770160	2771160	All right.
2771160	2772160	Fuck.
2772160	2773160	We just went on like a 20 minute tirade on dead by daylight.
2773160	2775380	Anyway, let me talk about other games in my game.
2775380	2777340	Mass Effect in a way.
2777340	2778340	Okay.
2778340	2781220	Well, let's talk about the third game I played this week, which some are comparing to Mass
2781220	2786680	Effect in some ways I've been playing Outriders, uh, which just came out on game pass on Xbox.
2786680	2791420	And um, I don't think it's like Mass Effect for the record, but, um, it's, it's sci-fi
2791420	2796700	it's in the future, but it's like even Mass Effect feels more hopeful and optimistic
2796700	2798340	than Outriders does so far.
2798340	2801080	Outriders is a very dreary setup and plot.
2801080	2806160	Um, and it's, um, you know, not pleasant in that regard, but I do find this story very
2806160	2807160	fascinating.
2807160	2809240	I'm going to give Outriders a massive props.
2809240	2814560	They are definitely creating a world, a universe that you're interested in and you're starting
2814560	2818600	to kind of want to peel back the layers on why is this going on?
2818600	2819600	What is that?
2819600	2822100	I'm not going to spoil what's happening in the game too much, but there's a lot of setup
2822100	2824080	for like, why is this happening?
2824080	2826860	And you're kind of going through a lot of this, like with the main character in the
2826860	2827860	game.
2827860	2831580	Um, I'm not usually into the shooty shooty bang bang games.
2831580	2836700	Um, even though this one is a third person and not first person, um, I guess you could
2836700	2838940	say it's a little more Gears of War in that regard.
2838940	2839940	Am I right?
2839940	2841540	Was Gears of War a third person?
2841540	2842540	Yeah.
2842540	2843540	Okay.
2843540	2845540	Well, it is both, but yeah, a lot of people did.
2845540	2847220	A lot of people did it in third person.
2847220	2852700	So, um, uh, it's interesting in that regard, but I will say my one little read on the game
2852760	2856760	is that for me, the battles are starting to feel a little same-sy, like I'm kind of doing
2856760	2857760	the same thing over and over.
2857760	2859240	Oh, I'm going into a big room.
2859240	2860240	There's a bunch of trenches there.
2860240	2863240	Well, there's just going to be a gauntlet of enemies coming after me.
2863240	2865240	Better call out my turret, my rockets and all that stuff.
2865240	2866600	I do like the abilities though.
2866600	2867600	They're fun.
2867600	2871880	But the story is interesting enough that I want to keep peeling back and, uh, seeing
2871880	2873160	more in what's in there.
2873160	2875120	And I hear the multiplayer is a lot of fun too.
2875120	2878480	I haven't really touched it yet, but maybe that's something I'll do in this next week.
2878500	2883780	I know that a lot of people have been playing and enjoying Outriders, um, even though I
2883780	2887220	guess they had some launch issues, but I didn't notice any of it because the day it launched,
2887220	2889500	I was still busy doing the No Man Sky drops.
2889500	2891920	So I didn't get into Outriders until like a week after everybody else.
2891920	2893980	So I guess it was all fixed by the time I got in there.
2893980	2894980	So there is that.
2894980	2899220	Uh, Questbuster in chat says, as a loot shooter, I'm really enjoying Outriders, especially
2899220	2901700	with the possibilities that the crafting opens up.
2901700	2902700	Yeah.
2902700	2905900	Um, Borderlands, as Joan heard Matt says, it's Gears of War beats Borderlands.
2905900	2907520	That's a very good comparison.
2907520	2912440	I was, yeah, I was thinking it's more like a, a third person Borderlands.
2912440	2914500	So that's a very good comparison, I think.
2914500	2916060	So, um, more to come on that.
2916060	2917500	I haven't played a ton of ton of it.
2917500	2918700	I've played a few of the quests.
2918700	2920980	Um, I, I'm at the point where I can team up.
2920980	2922660	I'm at the point where I've picked a class.
2922660	2925460	Like you have to play a little bit of the game before you even get there.
2925460	2929740	So, um, uh, yeah, I've played a little bit into it, so, uh, I'll try to play some more
2929740	2930740	this week.
2930740	2933460	There's one more game I've played, but we're going to be talking about it in a couple of
2933460	2934460	stories anyway.
2934460	2935660	So I'll talk about it then.
2935660	2940120	So we need to move on and get into the rest of our show because I've talked a lot about
2940120	2943800	my gaming week and, uh, uh, the kickoff topic and all that stuff.
2943800	2947640	And here it was supposed to be a tired and slow night for me, but I guess I'm just running
2947640	2949640	on pure adrenaline right now.
2949640	2952440	Probably when the show is over, I'm going to pass the fuck out.
2952440	2956680	All right, let's get into the news though, before we get to that point.
2956680	2958860	So Loki, why don't you start us off?
2958860	2964420	So after speculation for quite a while, we finally got confirmation from the ESA that
2964420	2968520	yes, E3 2021 is still happening.
2968520	2972320	It's going to be an all digital, all free event because there was that rumor that there
2972320	2977480	was, it was going to be a paid event, um, and it's supposed to run between June 12th
2977480	2978480	through the 15th.
2978480	2984280	And it's going to feature Nintendo, Xbox, Capcom, Konami, Ubisoft, Take-Two Interactive,
2984280	2988800	Warner Brothers and, uh, Kosh Media.
2988800	2994120	And apparently though, uh, there's still the other events going on.
2994120	2996100	We don't really know exactly what we'll see.
2996100	2999340	I'm assuming just probably like some press conferences and stuff like that.
2999340	3002940	Uh, surprised to see Nintendo in there as well.
3002940	3008660	Um, but interesting, especially when Nintendo usually does their own tree house thing the
3008660	3009660	whole time.
3009660	3013180	So it sounds like money was involved with that one.
3013180	3015180	Um, so we'll see.
3015180	3018740	Um, but anyways, yeah, they're going to have that.
3018740	3023820	Um, and then they're planning on doing like a lease right now they're planning on for
3023820	3029300	an in-person event next year, hopefully assuming everything, uh, gets better by that time.
3029300	3034800	So I'm curious to see, I always like hearing the, you know, the news and everything.
3034800	3038360	Um, I'm curious to see what's going to be announced.
3038360	3040960	Um, but at least now we have a date.
3040960	3046380	I'm also, I'm not sure if we know the dates yet for like, uh, the, you know, um, Jeff
3046380	3048180	Keeley thing and stuff like that.
3048180	3052360	So we'll, we'll have to see what else is going to be out around that time as well.
3052400	3056320	Do you think maybe like, uh, E3 is going to be the big budget stuff and the Jeff Keeley
3056320	3058680	event ends up being indie and lower budget stuff.
3058680	3059680	And that's not me being shady.
3059680	3065180	That's, you know, among us is indie and you know, on that list.
3065180	3066180	That's kind of surprising.
3066180	3067180	Good point.
3067180	3068180	No, it's not.
3068180	3069880	They didn't do the last E3.
3069880	3070880	They're over E3.
3070880	3071880	Oh yeah.
3071880	3075840	They're, they're building their, you know, big blockbuster games.
3075840	3077400	So you're right.
3077400	3083140	They could do, um, uh, Jeff Keeley's thing because I'm thinking of, uh, Hideo Kojima,
3083140	3086000	but that's, that's not a Sony Jeff Keeley thing.
3086000	3087540	That's a Kojima Jeff Keeley thing.
3087540	3090700	But remember how like, you know, every Jeff Keeley event was, what's the latest update
3090700	3091700	on Death Stranding?
3091700	3092700	Yeah.
3092700	3093700	The longest time.
3093700	3094700	Yeah.
3094700	3095700	Yeah.
3095700	3100920	So, um, I don't know, interest to see what they announce because right now I don't have
3100920	3103640	anything exciting that I'm looking forward to this year coming out.
3103640	3105640	So I would like something.
3106080	3107080	Yeah.
3107080	3113520	Especially, especially with the Panini going on in the world still, you know, um, it'd
3113520	3118000	be interesting to kind of hear, like, what are the game companies like, what has been
3118000	3122440	kind of slowed down by that, that maybe we'll finally get to this year as hopefully, you
3122440	3126200	know, more and more get vaccinated and hopefully we get to the other side of this thing.
3126200	3130360	But, um, yeah, I'm hoping it'll be a better year this year than it was last year.
3130360	3136080	But at the same time, you know, we have to be understanding that this whole world situation
3136080	3142040	and working from home, it is, in game development, it is harder for working to work from home
3142040	3145760	than it is to be in person, unless you're a one man studio.
3145760	3146760	That's really it.
3146760	3147760	That's true.
3147760	3148760	Yeah.
3148760	3149760	So, all right.
3149760	3153960	Um, anyhow, we'll, uh, we'll, the interesting thing is we can, we can fully participate
3153960	3156480	with E3 for the first time in years.
3156480	3157480	Yeah.
3157480	3160280	So that'll be fun.
3160280	3162960	We'll see what we're going to do about that closer to the event.
3162960	3165240	Maybe we'll do some nightly recaps or something.
3165240	3166240	We'll see.
3166240	3167240	I don't know.
3167240	3171000	It just kind of depends again on what's going on with, with COVID and all that.
3171000	3172000	All right.
3172000	3175720	So I mentioned there was one other game I played this week and, uh, it's this, uh, surprise
3175720	3179920	release that came out on the Nintendo switch Pac-Man 99.
3179920	3185000	So obviously there is, there's a void in our hearts because Mario was killed by Nintendo
3185000	3187220	on March 31st, as we know.
3187220	3189920	And that switch, uh, yes.
3189960	3192600	And became a ghost and is now in Pac-Man.
3192600	3193600	Okay.
3193600	3199320	Uh, but Mario 35, uh, went the way of, uh, you know, uh, being, being unplugged, uh,
3199320	3200320	with that.
3200320	3205080	Now Tetris 99 is still a thing, but it looks like the same developers that brought us both
3205080	3209440	these games, cause this honestly looks like a cookie cutter template from both those games,
3209440	3210440	but that's okay.
3210440	3211440	It's a good game.
3211440	3213760	Uh, has brought us Pac-Man 99.
3213760	3217020	It's the new bonus for Nintendo switch online members.
3217060	3222260	So I will give Nintendo one gold star, even though they killed Mario, I will give them
3222260	3226200	one gold star because I said they should have had something ready to go when they killed
3226200	3227200	Mario.
3227200	3229020	Well, here they did have something ready to go when they killed Mario.
3229020	3230680	So here you go.
3230680	3234540	One gold star for Nintendo for having something ready to go.
3234540	3240140	So Pac-Man 99 came out and it's, um, it's, it's like Tetris and Mario 99, but with Pac-Man.
3240140	3243440	Uh, it's a 99 player battle royale, hence the name.
3243440	3247960	And it combines a little bit of regular Pac-Man with Pac-Man championship edition.
3247960	3253480	So it looks like regular Pac-Man and the maze is like Pac-Man, but the concept of ghosts
3253480	3260200	with ghost trails and how the dots restock on the board as you eat fruit and finish certain
3260200	3263200	parts of the board that comes from Pac-Man championship edition.
3263200	3266080	So it is a very interesting blend of both games.
3266080	3272520	Um, and as you, uh, eat ghosts, then you send jammer Pac-Man's to your opponents.
3273160	3276080	They're ghost Pac-Man that if you run into them, they slow you down.
3276080	3279120	And obviously when you're trying to escape ghosts, that's bad because it is a battle
3279120	3280120	royale game.
3280120	3281440	You hit a ghost, you're out.
3281440	3282440	Period.
3282440	3283640	So these games go by pretty quick.
3283640	3288840	Uh, if you really want to fuck up your opponents though, you get the little ghosts and add
3288840	3292640	them to a ghost train so that when you eat the power pellet, you eat like 20 ghosts at
3292640	3296840	a time and just send those little jammer Pac-Man's flying to your opponents.
3296840	3298880	And that is essentially the game.
3299800	3305240	They have like a million different skins for this game, for like every Namco franchise.
3305240	3307800	Like you could make your Pac-Man board look like Mappy.
3307800	3310600	I know that's a game that Dark Soccer has enjoyed.
3310600	3313400	You can, you can make it look like the Tower of Druaga.
3313400	3318800	You can make it look like Dragon Spirit, uh, Rally-X, like it's like every Namco classic
3318800	3321600	Dig Dug, uh, is, it has some type of skin.
3321600	3323440	Of course you got to pay money for it.
3323480	3330560	So, so the, the game is free asterisk, but just like Tetris 99, if you want the additional
3330560	3334880	modes or you want the additional skins, then you got to pay a little bit of money for that.
3334880	3337880	Or just pay 25, I think it is to unlock everything.
3337880	3340440	So, um, but the game, the game's fine.
3340440	3341440	It's fun.
3341440	3342440	I enjoyed it.
3342440	3346640	I don't know if it's something I'd play forever, but, um, it was, it's a cute little thing.
3346640	3349080	So anyway, uh, and it was also brought to my attention.
3349080	3351520	There's an interesting Bamani connection to this game.
3351520	3352600	Did you know that?
3352600	3353920	So, and this is on Twitter.
3353920	3354920	Yeah.
3354920	3360520	So sampling masters, mega, who you might remember did some of the old 2DX songs and then they've,
3360520	3362640	they've done stuff for Namco in the past.
3362640	3365960	Well, sampling masters, mega made the music in this game.
3365960	3366960	So how about that?
3366960	3367960	Yeah.
3367960	3368960	So there's a little bit of a Bamani connection there.
3368960	3374360	Uh, you can see more information about that over on, uh, uh, the, uh, composer for sampling
3374360	3375360	master.
3375360	3380360	Um, Ayako Sasso, A Y A K O underscore S A S O.
3380360	3381360	Pretty cool stuff.
3382120	3386160	All right, let's move on dark Sakura.
3386160	3392800	So, um, switching gears to go into the world of plush things for money.
3392800	3396600	Um, there was the animal crossing, build a bear thing.
3396600	3402520	Um, they went on sale, um, on a Tuesday morning of this past week.
3402520	3404960	And of course it was a clusterfuck.
3405040	3413040	They had a virtual queue so that people could, you know, buy, uh, their, uh, their animals,
3413040	3417000	which of course, um, there's going to be, I think, sold in stores later, but it was
3417000	3419600	only, you know, Tom Nook and Isabelle.
3419600	3425160	But basically the way that worked is that you start your queue at 10 30 AM on the website,
3425160	3427520	and then you'll be randomly assigned a place in line.
3427520	3431400	And when your turn comes up, you'll have a short amount of time to buy items from the
3431400	3433880	animal crossing new horizons collection.
3433880	3440640	And then what you, you know, so good after that, when, when it arrives, you decide what
3440640	3442360	you want to do with it after that.
3442360	3450120	Um, but the big thing is that they weren't even revealing the characters or items until
3450120	3452760	10 30 AM Eastern.
3452760	3457800	Um, it was really just kind of a big, a big mess.
3457840	3468320	Um, now, uh, I looked on, uh, the website and, uh, they are going to be going into a
3468320	3472360	re-release and they have an email out for like the next, the next chance.
3472360	3473920	I don't think they look that great.
3473920	3475640	Actually the Tom Nook one doesn't look that great.
3475640	3479040	The Isabelle looks kind of good, but they just still have that kind of weird build a
3479040	3480560	bear body.
3480560	3484520	So it's cool.
3484560	3484880	Yeah.
3484880	3488680	I totally forgot that these were going on sale until somebody was tweeting about it.
3488680	3490560	And I was like, Oh yeah, that was today.
3490560	3496040	And I wanted to get one of those, but I'm, I'm, I guess if dark soccer is like, they're
3496040	3496680	all right.
3496680	3499200	I guess I don't feel like I missed that much.
3499200	3501880	You know, I feel a little like, what?
3501880	3504640	I still have your ketchup.
3504640	3505480	Oh wow.
3505480	3507320	Yeah, that's right.
3507320	3508600	I've had that for a while.
3508600	3511360	I know you sent me a picture finally.
3511360	3513680	Well, it sent you a picture right after she arrived.
3513680	3515000	Well, and guess what?
3515000	3517160	In two weeks I can have people over.
3517160	3521400	Well, that's not true because Alan's still not vaccinated, but I can go to your house.
3521400	3527120	Hey Rob, if you want, if you want a Tom Nook, you can spend three and an Isabelle, you can
3527120	3530120	spend 300 bucks on eBay.
3530120	3535960	No, I'm trying to think of a polite way to say I could also tell those scalpers to suck
3535960	3537960	my balls, but I can't think of a nice way to say it.
3537960	3540160	So I just won't say anything.
3540160	3541840	I think that's about as polite as one can get.
3541840	3542520	Yeah.
3542520	3544040	So, all right.
3544040	3546440	Anyway, let's move on.
3546440	3550640	Speaking of things that, let's get to the next story, Loki.
3550640	3555720	Well, I mean, it's, I'm not surprised because there's been a parts shortage and even just
3555720	3559000	like a Silicon shortage for a while now.
3559000	3566320	And so right now, apparently the reason why we can't find PlayStation fives or Xbox series
3566320	3573560	X's or new GPU's, not because people are using them for mining is because the parts
3573560	3578800	that go into these are becoming more expensive.
3578800	3584800	And based on this, that's why there's less supply around.
3584800	3591600	There's a lot more demand, the demand's not being met except for scalpers and people that
3591600	3596240	are using those cards to mine.
3596240	3601040	And so, yeah, right now, apparently they're just trying to work through that supply chain
3601040	3602040	issue.
3602040	3607320	And that, so really what that tells us is that this supply issue with the Xbox series
3607320	3612440	X and PlayStation 5, it's not getting any better for a long time, at least not this
3612440	3613440	year.
3613440	3614440	Wow.
3614440	3616120	That sucks.
3616120	3620160	I was thinking about getting a new graphics card, but I guess not, I guess I better just
3620160	3624120	learn to work with what I have.
3624120	3628600	Your best bet is hoping that cryptocurrency crashes again, and in which case all those
3628600	3630440	mining cards will be available.
3630440	3638360	Well, hold on, because I just on a whim, on a loo, on a tihi, I bought like 50 bucks,
3638360	3642920	so it can't crash yet until I cash that out.
3642920	3644960	But I'll do that soon if that'll help.
3644960	3650040	Your 50 bucks isn't very much when you're considering the going price like 50,000 or
3650040	3654680	whatever for Bitcoin or something like that.
3654680	3662760	And I'm talking not necessarily dropping to nothing, but basically going back down.
3662760	3668320	I will say, I bought like 50 bucks of one of those things, like maybe it was in January,
3668320	3672680	and I'm up to 75 now, and that's faster than my 401k works.
3672680	3677640	So not that I would ever advocate, don't ever take financial advice from this bozo.
3677640	3682600	I made more money on that than I do at the casino.
3682600	3684000	So you know what?
3684000	3685000	It was fun.
3685000	3694040	But yeah, unfortunately, when it comes to get money quick, just the absolute worst people
3694040	3697040	will come out and just make it horrible for everybody.
3697040	3703360	And buy up the graphics supplies and burn down a forest to make one more Bitcoin or
3703360	3704360	whatever.
3704360	3713160	Well, right, and GPU manufacturers have tried to dissuade people from buying them by basically
3713160	3718480	locking out in drivers the ability to mine at full speed.
3718480	3725480	But you know, when they called it unhackable, that's their first mistake.
3725480	3726840	And so what happened?
3726840	3728640	It immediately got hacked.
3728640	3730140	Very true.
3730140	3736980	Listen, free advice for any technology company out there, never say your product is unhackable.
3736980	3737980	It just is.
3737980	3740260	It's basically like putting your right way down.
3740260	3741260	Yeah, exactly.
3741260	3744020	You're throwing down the gauntlet.
3744020	3747020	This is unhackable.
3747020	3750540	Just shut up about it and just release it as is.
3750540	3753440	And just whatever, but it didn't really help.
3753440	3756100	So I don't know.
3756100	3757300	All right.
3757300	3761880	Let's move on and talk about, we were kind of talking at the top of the show about Sony
3761880	3766380	maybe trying to get partnering up and expanding franchises in different directions.
3766380	3769620	And there was actually a great comment in chat, I can't remember if I read it or not,
3769620	3773260	and I'm sorry, I forgot who said this, but somebody had said, why didn't they start creating
3773260	3776300	a new Last of Us game instead of going back and remastering?
3776300	3779860	Well, number one, you bet your ass they're working on the Last of Us 3.
3779860	3782420	It's just that's going to take a long time to make.
3782420	3785900	So a Last of Us remaster is something they could get done faster.
3785900	3790380	But I think the way I interpreted the comment was really like, well, why not a different
3790380	3793700	Last of Us game set in that universe type of thing?
3793700	3795460	Which is a fair question to ask.
3795460	3800440	Why not try to use the engine to make something else or do something with it?
3800440	3805580	And I think this next story is a little bit about, well, maybe this is Sony's plan in
3805580	3809300	a way, and it has to do with mobile gaming.
3809300	3811540	There hasn't been a lot of Sony in mobile gaming.
3811580	3815340	There was Uncharted Fortune Hunter, but I don't think that is on.
3815340	3816820	Did anybody know that there was an Uncharted game?
3816820	3818420	I don't think many of you knew about that.
3818420	3819420	No.
3819420	3820420	Did anyone care?
3820420	3822780	I'm sure there's one person out there in chat going, I love that game.
3822780	3823780	That's fine.
3823780	3824780	That's great.
3824780	3826980	But most people don't know about the Uncharted Fortune Hunter game.
3826980	3835780	So Sony is going to be kind of making a push to get more of an online and mobile presence,
3835780	3840480	kind of like Nintendo tried to do a few years ago, to mixed success.
3840480	3842880	Their Niantic stuff, very, very good.
3842880	3846200	Their Super Mario Run stuff, very, very not good.
3846200	3848300	Their Animal Crossing, somewhere in the middle.
3848300	3852720	So you know, Nintendo's had some very mixed luck with that.
3852720	3854600	People really like Pocket Camp, though.
3854600	3855600	I know.
3855600	3856600	I know.
3856600	3857600	That's why I'm not saying-
3857600	3858600	People who like it, really like it.
3858600	3864520	That's why I'm not saying Pocket Camp isn't a bad column, because here's, talk about needing
3864520	3866580	AAA Blockbuster.
3866580	3869020	Those games weren't big enough for Nintendo.
3869020	3873580	As much as y'all love Animal Crossing, and I'm sure Super Mario Run has its fans, and
3873580	3879340	the Dregalia Lost is apparently a very strong title as well, but Nintendo kind of has already
3879340	3884620	walked away from mobile because none of those games were big enough, except Niantic.
3884620	3886980	So they walked away from all that, and instead they said, you know what, Niantic?
3886980	3888340	How about Pikmin?
3888340	3890620	And that's apparently just going to be the start of it.
3890620	3892180	If you read that press release-
3892180	3894120	Stop making Pikmin games.
3894120	3898380	Make another Metroid game, or make another F-Zero game.
3898380	3899380	How about that?
3899380	3902900	And actually, to go ahead and point out, they have not completely walked away from Pocket
3902900	3903900	Camp.
3903900	3905100	They're still releasing material for it.
3905100	3908420	Well, and they haven't walked away from Dregalia Lost or any of that stuff either, but it's
3908420	3913380	easier for them to maintain the games they have than to cook up another one from scratch.
3913380	3914380	It's more that.
3914380	3915380	Mm-hmm.
3915380	3916380	So.
3916380	3917380	All right.
3917380	3918380	Anyhow, where else was I?
3918380	3919380	Oh, yes.
3919380	3924980	So Sony did have that whole Xperia Play, the PlayStation phone.
3924980	3926860	Yeah, that's all I need to say about that.
3926860	3930240	That was a thing that existed at one point.
3930240	3936300	But it has been noticed that Sony is now hiring an executive at PlayStation Studios to focus
3936300	3940920	on bringing PlayStation's most popular franchises to mobile.
3940920	3945660	So this is very early on, but it does appear Sony may be trying to craft that in-house,
3945660	3951180	how to get more of their content and their licenses on mobile, because it does create
3951180	3954740	that whole brand awareness and all that stuff.
3954740	3958460	I'm sure there's a little big planet game to be made on mobile somewhere.
3958460	3961220	I don't know why that one comes to mind, but it does.
3961220	3965020	I think of that well before I think of like this article I'm looking at mentions Horizon
3965020	3966020	Zero Dawn.
3966020	3970420	And I'm like, I don't want that on mobile, but maybe like an Ayla side story type of
3970420	3971420	thing.
3971420	3973420	Or, you know, is that her name?
3973420	3975420	Yeah, I don't remember.
3975420	3976420	I forget.
3976420	3981840	A side story would be kind of cool, but I just don't try to create that same experience
3981840	3982840	on mobile.
3982840	3985040	That's going to be great.
3985040	3986040	But we'll see.
3986040	3987220	We'll see what comes out.
3987220	3991200	And I would be interested to see if maybe this ends up because, you know, it's within
3991200	3995800	PlayStation, maybe they create a mobile game that kind of interacts concurrently with a
3995800	3997400	game that's on the console.
3997400	3998400	It'd be kind of interesting.
3998400	4001360	Something you can play on console or on the go.
4001360	4002880	I don't know.
4002880	4004060	Could be interesting.
4004060	4007040	So obviously it's just a job listing, so we don't know much.
4007040	4010040	We just know the strategy.
4010040	4017000	As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat suggests, Pocket Kratos, boy trainer.
4017000	4020200	Sacred Jade in chat says, Sackboy Crossing.
4020200	4021200	You never know.
4021200	4022200	You never know.
4022200	4023200	All right.
4023200	4024200	Sackboy Pocket Camp.
4024200	4028860	Hey, it wouldn't be the first time Sony heavily borrowed from a Nintendo idea.
4028860	4033680	Remember PlayStation, Battle Royale, All Stars, or whatever the hell that thing was called?
4033680	4037160	Which many are still saying should get a sequel, and I don't disagree.
4037160	4038160	I think you should.
4038160	4039160	Ooh.
4039320	4040320	Ooh.
4040320	4041320	Ooh.
4041320	4046320	You know what series, what franchise would be great for mobile?
4046320	4047880	Parappa the Rappa.
4047880	4049680	No, you think?
4049680	4052480	I think so.
4052480	4053480	That's my guess.
4053480	4054480	That's my guess.
4054480	4055480	I'm sticking to it.
4055480	4056480	All right.
4056480	4058600	The things, though, that I think make pretty good mobile games are ones that you don't
4058600	4062880	have to have any volume for if you're playing it like in a crowded area.
4062880	4063880	Fair.
4063880	4065320	It's fair.
4065320	4066860	All right.
4066860	4067860	Let's move on.
4067900	4068900	Darth sakura.
4068900	4069900	Speak.
4069900	4071220	I brought up sci fi earlier.
4071220	4072220	This isn't what I meant.
4072220	4077540	Well, actually, the sounds that you were making that made me think of a monkey.
4077540	4078540	Yes.
4078540	4080180	And this this article has to do with monkey.
4080180	4081180	How about that?
4081180	4083820	And not even the butt monkey from Toshinden?
4083820	4093780	Anyway, supervillain Elon Musk has been doing experiments with chips and animals brains.
4093780	4095780	He put a chip in a pig.
4095780	4105580	It's like Mura Muralink thing, but at any rate, he put one in a monkey's brain and had
4105580	4107460	him play mind pong.
4107460	4110580	He was trained to use a joystick, but it was unplugged.
4110580	4115700	And now he's using the paddle by thinking about moving his hands.
4115700	4125860	Now the statement that he said about it was that it would be it would help enable someone
4125860	4130420	like say with paralysis to use their smartphone with their mind faster than someone was using
4130420	4134220	their thumb.
4134220	4140420	What it does is it takes recording it records and decodes digital signals from the brain
4140420	4147860	using more than two thousand electrodes implanted in regions of the motor cortex where it coordinates
4147860	4150780	hand and arm music movements.
4150780	4161180	And then it can calibrate based on what the monkey how the monkey plays right.
4161180	4164780	It's interesting.
4164780	4167580	There's people in chat room already saying that this is how we get Skynet.
4167580	4168580	Yes, exactly.
4168580	4176540	The comment I was looking at from D'Artitsuya Skynet was not cybernet cybernetic, really.
4176540	4180820	It was more I still think machine.
4180820	4182700	I think the point applies.
4182700	4189580	Yes, I don't think I don't think this is what I think this is, is that I think this is yes,
4189580	4190580	I've said it.
4190580	4191580	This is the matrix.
4191580	4193300	I don't think this is the matrix.
4193300	4194820	We're not augmenting reality.
4194820	4196100	This is something worse.
4196100	4198760	This is Planet of the Apes meets Terminator.
4198760	4201860	This is the matrix revolutions.
4201860	4206060	This is Total Recall, the newer one.
4206060	4210900	Oh, no, the dude had like the phone in his hand and shit.
4210900	4217420	But like, wait, but are you saying are you saying D'Artitsuya that if I want the killer
4217420	4221700	to turn around faster on Xbox and Dead by Daylight, all I need is a brain chip?
4221700	4222700	Yes.
4222700	4223700	Yes.
4223700	4224700	Hmm.
4224700	4225700	Or a monkey.
4226300	4228060	Or a forbidden donut.
4228060	4233180	But now I have to I do have to take a step back because this actually makes me think
4233180	4241900	of something I was watching about cybernetics for amputees.
4241900	4247420	It was a lady who had like just freshly lost her arm or something and she was in this study
4247420	4255260	and they remapped her her nerves to certain points to where her stump was.
4255820	4260500	And then outfit the hand and she had like a little control chip.
4260500	4269900	And so this allowed her to work her hand as if it were a real hand, she could grip things,
4269900	4274740	she could move fingers, she could pinch, she could do all kinds of stuff.
4274740	4280900	And it makes me think, what if and I'm not looking at the more control your electronics
4280900	4282900	with your brain, you know, kind of thing.
4283060	4291220	I'm thinking of practical applications for situations like for an amputee or for maybe
4291220	4297660	even what about the good things that video games can do for medicine or brain chips?
4297660	4298660	It's medicine.
4298660	4304620	I'm also thinking in terms of like exoskeletons, because I've seen that they have them created
4304620	4311940	now for for quadriplegics and paraplegics.
4311980	4317980	But I'm looking now, though, this could really have, instead of just this little pipe dream
4317980	4323100	about controlling electronics with your brain, I think it could have practical medical applications.
4323100	4326980	Yeah, that is that is the interesting thing here.
4326980	4331420	And that's that's the very tricky, I guess, philosophical question that's going to have
4331420	4335220	to be answered about brain chips is that, you know, on one hand, we look at a monkey
4335220	4338260	playing video games and we're like, that's stupid.
4338260	4341460	And then, you know, putting them in humans for video games.
4341500	4343140	That's also very stupid.
4343140	4347180	But then the way the dark soccer kind of laid out there, oh, somebody who, you know, what
4347180	4353380	had an amputation could actually get some type of feeling and usage back like it's like
4353380	4355260	they have nerves and all that stuff.
4355260	4358860	Oh, maybe this does have something that could be legitimate.
4358860	4361940	But then then then that opens this whole can of worms of the ethical side.
4361940	4366140	But that's and that's nothing that's nothing we're going to have to answer here.
4366140	4373540	But you don't get to person being able to use their hand again until you get through
4373540	4375500	monkey playing pong, I guess.
4375500	4380780	Well, and the other thing, though, is that this also does bring in then the ethical question,
4380780	4385100	because I'm sure, you know, PETA, fuck them.
4385100	4390260	And other animal advocacy groups now are in on, well, what about these animals that they're
4390260	4391580	being experimented on?
4391580	4394940	Are they being treated ethically as well?
4395780	4396620	And.
4398660	4402300	I don't know, for something like this, you have to have something very similar if it's
4402300	4405780	going to be used on humans, you have to have something similar to, you know, a kind of
4405780	4406580	primate brain.
4409540	4413980	And it does this is the part of it that does strike me as, you know, supervillain time,
4414900	4415500	but.
4417220	4424220	I don't know, I'm I think if there's no actual harm being done to the creatures, like if
4424220	4429420	it's not going to, you know, fry their brain or short it out or anything, then I'm kind
4429420	4430060	of OK with it.
4432060	4436420	I mean, I don't think putting a chip in a pig's head just to put the chip in the pig's
4436420	4438540	head is that good of a thing.
4439620	4444580	But in a case like this, it's showing the possibilities that can be done by uniting
4444580	4451860	technology and organics, as the old saying goes for me, not my circus, not my monkeys,
4451860	4453300	literally not my monkeys.
4454060	4454780	I don't know.
4454780	4456500	I think we're a step away from the Borg.
4457340	4459260	It does seem that way some days, doesn't it?
4459380	4462140	Hey, we just celebrated first contact day after all.
4462140	4465900	And it was another first contact day that was not ruined by the Borg.
4465900	4466980	So let's celebrate that.
4467900	4468260	All right.
4468260	4468780	That's true.
4469460	4473020	Let's move on to our next story, which I think is Loki's.
4474460	4477180	Yeah, so this is kind of cool.
4477820	4482820	You know, we we hear about all these different prototype games and stuff that were canceled
4482820	4484220	and now we see what it looks like.
4484220	4490820	Well, one of them appeared on YouTube and it is a game that appears to be Castlevania
4490820	4497300	Resurrection, which was a game that was a do out or at least it was shown like in the
4497300	4502380	September 1999 issue of the Dreamcast magazine.
4502940	4507300	And I guess they had canceled or Konami had canceled it back in March of 2000.
4507820	4510300	And they even had an E3 trailer, though, for it.
4510780	4513300	But it's definitely an early build of the game.
4513420	4518260	It looks like from November, November 5th, 1999.
4519380	4526300	But they did, you know, show gameplay and stuff, obviously, very early and a little
4526300	4527020	rough around the edges.
4527020	4528220	So maybe that's why they canceled it.
4528220	4532820	But still need to see this, even though it never did come out.
4536780	4539100	Bummer, because I bet Dark Soccer would have been all over that game.
4540300	4548180	Hmm. I don't know, she might have been over it, you know, all over it, like she would
4548180	4549700	have been with Castlevania 64.
4552180	4556580	So but but but ask her, Dark Soccer, isn't the Symphony of the Night on the Dreamcast
4556580	4557340	the best version?
4560060	4567460	There. You know what, I'm not even going to comment on that one, just because.
4568460	4575940	I mean, I would play any Castlevania game at least once, so I would play this, you know.
4577300	4581260	But. I probably would hate it after a moment.
4582380	4584940	Yeah, I'd try it and I'd hate every minute of it.
4585860	4589580	It was the only thing that I would like about it is that it would have Sonya Belmont in it.
4589820	4593700	Yeah, I was going to say it has Sonya Belmont in the game, which is kind of cool.
4594540	4595700	Yeah, and one more video.
4596300	4597940	I watched the video a little bit.
4597940	4599580	It's interesting.
4599580	4602780	I don't really know what the gameplay would look like, but it's kind of hard.
4602780	4610220	I never really got into the 3D, you know, the three dimensional Castlevania games, more
4610220	4612860	of a traditional 2D Castlevania fan.
4612860	4618940	But. I don't know, it's hard to say what it would have been since it got canceled, but it
4618940	4621740	looked it looked different.
4622460	4627340	It's the first person, I mean, not first one, but a third person 3D platformer is what it is.
4627340	4630500	Yeah, and it looks neat.
4632180	4633900	I'm actually watching just a little bit of it.
4633900	4635660	I kind of like some of the music that's going on.
4636500	4637620	It had potential.
4637620	4640620	I mean, an idea like that would definitely have potential.
4641660	4644820	But it's all in the execution in the end.
4644820	4646580	It doesn't matter how pretty it is.
4647260	4648940	It matters if you're having fun.
4649100	4651900	And in the end, it got canceled anyway.
4652540	4656020	Yeah, and that's kind of speaking of execution, it did.
4656020	4657660	That's kind of why it did get canceled.
4657660	4659940	So they basically said that it was June from the start.
4660940	4665060	The team itself had a lot of troubles when Jason Lee Elliott came on.
4665500	4667380	And this is from his, I guess, personal website.
4667380	4671860	Most of the team had only ever worked on sports games, so they had no idea how to make a 3D
4671860	4672900	action platformer.
4673340	4676740	And the art team wasn't very cohesive and couldn't agree on a direction.
4677260	4680900	So the game had been in development for almost two years and had little to show for it.
4681380	4686860	Yeah, I think if you're going to, like, if it were me having,
4687660	4694980	you know, a 3D, you know, third person exploration, you know, platform game,
4695580	4698540	I would have taken notes from Sonic Team.
4700620	4703060	Or, you know, from the group that did Sonic Adventure.
4703660	4706620	Yeah, yeah, look at the successful ones.
4706660	4708260	And hire people that worked in those groups.
4710460	4716180	All right, I think I'm going to go ahead and jump to the next story unless you had a final
4716180	4718020	thought. No, I don't.
4718500	4719860	OK, all right.
4720820	4726620	So it's funny, I was kind of making the jokes about why can't we be able to flip around
4726620	4728020	the killer in Dead by Daylight?
4728180	4733620	It actually ties into this next story a little bit because a first party Microsoft title,
4733620	4739260	Halo The Master Chief Collection, now supports keyboard and mouse on Xbox.
4739740	4741060	So that's kind of cool.
4741060	4745540	Now, I mean, it's not it's not like, you know, heck, even I think the PlayStation 3, you
4745540	4746860	could hook up a keyboard to it.
4746860	4753540	And I know the Xbox 360, you could use a keyboard and a mouse in Final Fantasy 11 was on
4753540	4754620	the Xbox 360.
4754700	4757060	On the PlayStation 2, I think you could do that, too.
4757060	4757860	You're right. You're right.
4758860	4763660	So but that's the point is that the game has to have it built in to support it.
4763860	4768180	You can't just plug your keyboard and mouse in and assume, oh, I can play Overwatch with
4768180	4769780	keyboard and mouse like I do on PC.
4770020	4773660	No, not unless the developers actually build in that functionality.
4773700	4778780	So that's the news here is that Microsoft has built in that functionality to one of their
4778780	4781540	biggest titles, Halo The Master Chief Collection.
4782340	4786300	So they have a season six that just came out for Xbox and PC.
4787420	4790780	And the new patch now enables mouse and keyboard support.
4791940	4796660	Any action can now be bound to multiple inputs while using mouse and keyboard, and that
4796660	4797580	is in the patch notes.
4797780	4802540	And this means that console and PC will be on the same version of the game as well.
4803140	4807220	Also, there's a new Halo 3 map called Waterfall that you can use in custom games.
4807220	4811380	Well, that's fun. So this all, of course, on the heels of
4811860	4817420	Halo, the new Halo Infinite, whatever the new one's called, that we still don't know
4817420	4818540	really when that's coming out.
4818900	4822220	But it will be interesting to see if that might support keyboard and mouse as well.
4822380	4826060	And now this just makes me kind of want like, oh, this would be kind of neat if maybe
4827780	4831580	the Dead by Daylight developers would let me use keyboard on my Xbox version of the
4831580	4832820	game, because why not?
4832860	4836300	They are. It's not like they don't already have the programing built in there because it
4836300	4837780	runs on Windows Store that way.
4837780	4841460	So have they already done the accessibility update for that one?
4843700	4844900	The colorblind one?
4845620	4847300	I don't remember.
4847300	4849300	I don't I know it's in planning.
4849300	4850980	I don't remember if it's actually out or not.
4852260	4854580	OK, you know what I would like for more things.
4855940	4857700	Yeah, I was oh, God, I shouldn't bring up.
4857860	4863060	OK, really quick on Dead by Daylight, I would like to see them be able to replace the
4863060	4866340	heartbeat noise when you play as a survivor, because that messes with me so bad.
4867060	4870100	Yeah, I would really like to see it be a visual cue instead.
4870740	4874100	I the heartbeat thing is one of the probably the number one thing I hate about playing
4874100	4879140	survivor. Just a quick aside for and I honestly, I think it's an accessibility thing.
4879780	4884420	I know it seems strange, but I just think that, like, the heartbeat creates this
4884420	4888260	artificial tension for me to is I can't do what it's supposed to do.
4888500	4889540	I don't like that.
4890180	4892020	If it was a visual cue, I think I'd be into it.
4892020	4894100	I don't know. I know it's weird.
4895060	4901380	All right, let's let's move on to a day and age when maybe games didn't terrify us
4901380	4902580	quite as much. Well, I don't know.
4902580	4905460	Actually, there were some there were some real terrifying games back in the day.
4905460	4907540	But actually, if I can rewind.
4907540	4908980	Yeah, sure. You need a VMU.
4910980	4911540	Why is that?
4912100	4913540	To throb your heartbeat.
4913540	4915460	Ah, I like that. I like that.
4915460	4917300	Like like in Resident Evil.
4917300	4919860	Yeah. Oh, and SSG100 Matt sums that perfectly.
4919860	4922260	Anxiety inducing in a bad way is what it's doing.
4922260	4927300	Yes. Anyway, but let's let's move on to a day when we didn't have VMUs or actually,
4927300	4934020	I think, sadly, per the rules of the classic game of the week, I think we did have VMU
4934020	4938100	well by the time this game came out, because a video game only has to be 10 years old to
4938100	4939860	qualify as the classic game of the week.
4939860	4943940	So we're going to take a trip down memory lane and look at a game that's about at least
4943940	4944580	10 years old.
4945220	4949380	When Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you
4949380	4951380	brats should be checking this game out.
4951380	4956500	And she picked a good one this week that made me go, I think this game is probably more
4956500	4958260	like 15 years old at this point.
4958260	4960980	And it just makes us all feel 11 years old.
4960980	4964660	Oh, I guess that's good, although that still seems old.
4964660	4967540	But anyway, what is the classic game of the week, Dark Soccer?
4968420	4969540	Plants versus zombies.
4971540	4974260	I love plants versus zombies.
4974260	4979060	It is such a fun game, and I've beaten it all the way through.
4979540	4982260	But at any rate, it came out in 2009.
4982260	4987700	It was a tower defense game developed and published by PopCap Games that first had a
4987700	4990180	release for Windows and Mac OS.
4990180	4995700	And this has been ported to other devices, consoles, mobile devices, handhelds, you name
4995700	4996200	it.
4996900	5004180	So in the game, you play as a homeowner in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, and you
5004180	5008340	have to basically fight the zombie hordes with your mutated plants.
5009060	5016900	So my favorite is the corn that shoots pats of butter like a catapult.
5017700	5024420	But at any rate, it was designed by someone named George Fenn.
5025140	5031940	And he was looking at it as more like a defense sequel to a fish simulator game that he made
5031940	5033780	called Unsan Aquarium.
5034420	5039300	He said it also took some inspiration from Magic the Gathering, Warcraft 3, and Swiss
5039300	5040260	Family Robinson.
5042100	5048260	The art was done by Rich Werner, and the music was done by Lara Shigehata.
5049220	5055540	And it was really just completely loved when it came out.
5055540	5059620	It was for the Golden Joystick Awards in 2010.
5059620	5062980	It was listed as a strategy game of the year.
5062980	5065700	And it also had earned a download game of the year.
5066260	5070340	And it was the fastest selling video game developed by PopCap.
5071540	5075940	By 2010, it had sold over a million copies worldwide.
5076500	5085060	And then PopCap was bought by Electronic Arts, and they laid off the designer and 49
5085060	5088500	employees to focus on mobile and social gaming.
5089460	5091940	But there were sequels that came out after that.
5092500	5097780	So as far as playing the game, you have adventure mode where you go through the different levels
5097780	5099540	and it gets progressively harder.
5101460	5109140	And you get upgraded plants and different kinds of seeds that you can buy and different
5109140	5110180	tools that you can buy.
5110900	5114500	And then you have different plants that you can use morning and night.
5114500	5125460	So at night, you have to use fungi that you won't be getting any sunlight during the day.
5126340	5128900	But you use sunlight to buy new...
5130420	5135780	Actually, to place the pieces on your board, basically what it is.
5135780	5140740	To put the pea shooter is what they're called.
5140740	5142740	Then you have the frozen pea shooter.
5142740	5143940	They're pretty clever names.
5146340	5153460	And then you have the roof level, which is like one of the last levels where you have
5153460	5158340	to fight Dr. Zomboss, who's an evil scientist who animated the zombies.
5158340	5160260	And he has like a big robot and everything.
5161540	5162580	There's other game modes.
5162580	5164420	There are mini games.
5164420	5167140	There's a puzzle mode, survival.
5167140	5171140	In many games, you switch from one of 20 mini games.
5172820	5174340	And you get some stuff from it.
5174340	5178820	I think you can feed this tree thing that you get at the end of the game, if I remember
5178820	5179320	right.
5180180	5181940	In puzzle mode, you have two types of levels.
5181940	5184260	You have vase breaker and iZombie.
5184260	5188180	So in vase breaker, you break open a bunch of vases, each getting part of a plant or
5188180	5189060	a zombie.
5189060	5195060	And it ends when you smashed all the vases and all the zombies are killed.
5195060	5202420	In iZombie, you place zombies to get past these cardboard cutouts of the plants.
5202500	5204740	So that you can eat the brains on the other side of the lane.
5206580	5212980	Survival mode basically lets you choose your plants and the zombies come wave after wave
5212980	5213480	after wave.
5218340	5221860	So George Fan, when he was developing the game, of course, it was directly influenced
5221860	5226580	by the development of Instant Aquarium, his earlier game.
5226660	5235300	So it has very similar pacing, the drip feedings that you get in this game.
5235300	5239380	You get sunlight, but you'll get what powers you up in very small increments.
5240260	5246420	And he said that the inspiration from Swiss Family Robinson came where you're a family
5246420	5247620	defending against pirates.
5247620	5252260	In this case, you're defending against the zombie hordes.
5252260	5265860	And it was originally, though, an alien defense game that was under the name Weedlings, but
5266580	5267940	they didn't like the name.
5267940	5271460	And they were going to also consider Lawn of the Dead.
5273220	5274180	I like that name.
5274900	5278340	Yeah, but Romero didn't permit the use.
5278580	5284100	And so he just wasn't down with it.
5284980	5291780	And it was basically had a small team to help him with development of the game.
5291780	5293460	He did the designs all himself.
5294420	5300020	They were thinking of doing it in a flash with sort of a paper look, kind of the South
5300020	5300820	Park kind of look.
5302260	5306660	And then they kept going and it was intended, of course, to attract the casual gamer.
5306660	5311620	But it went into that strategy era and started pulling all kinds of people into it.
5312420	5317140	So you have 51 different kinds of zombies and 49 different kinds of plants.
5319380	5322100	One of my favorite zombies is the disco zombie.
5323780	5330660	And you also have another dancing zombie that's supposed to look like Michael Jackson.
5331620	5332500	Actually, yeah, that's right.
5332500	5334820	The disco zombie was the dancing zombie.
5334820	5340260	The little Michael Jackson in Thriller and then he objected.
5340260	5344260	Well, his estate objected to the use, so they replaced him with a disco zombie.
5346260	5351940	And the music was a mix of different pop and chip tune kind of sounds.
5351940	5358180	And Shigehara, who did the music, said she drew influence from Danny Elfman's soundtracks,
5359140	5366500	but tried to spread out the themes into something a little bit more across the board.
5368420	5370260	So there were mobile phone versions.
5372420	5377220	iPad, iPhone, and then eventually it came to Android as well.
5380420	5386900	There, of course, were the console versions, which was bundled in July 2010 for Xbox 360
5386900	5388260	with Peggle and Zuma.
5390980	5392820	There was PlayStation Network port.
5392820	5394740	There's DS version of it.
5396100	5398340	There's DSiWare port as well.
5398900	5401860	PlayStation Vita port was announced and released.
5403300	5405700	And you could use the touch screen or controller with that one.
5406900	5409460	And you could shake the Vita to collect your sons and money,
5410260	5412100	but it doesn't have the multiplayer setting.
5412900	5418580	Um, it was considered one of the top grossing games on iOS.
5419620	5423300	It has received amazing reviews over the board.
5425940	5433300	The iOS versions, iPad and iOS, received 92 and 93 out of 100 for Metacritic.
5435540	5440580	It's been, I mean, it really was just so popular and people are still
5441300	5442660	loving the game, I mean.
5443300	5445620	And it's won so many awards.
5446980	5452340	It won, from the Golden Joystick Awards, like I said earlier,
5452340	5454900	it won Download Game of the Year and Strategy Game of the Year.
5457220	5464260	And then after George Brown was laid off, he kind of took some inspiration
5464260	5466660	and worked on Octogeddon.
5466660	5468580	So it's another game from him.
5471380	5477380	And then there were, of course, like a bunch of sequels and spinoffs.
5478100	5480980	So we had Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare,
5480980	5484580	which is a multiplayer third-person shooter.
5485140	5487460	We have Plants vs. Zombies 2.
5487460	5490260	We have Plants vs. Zombies Hero on iOS.
5490900	5494740	Plants vs. Zombies Battle for the Neighborhood for PS4 and Xbox One.
5495700	5497780	They're working on another one for the portables.
5500820	5504740	It's just everywhere.
5504740	5506420	Plants vs. Zombies isn't going anywhere.
5507540	5511700	There was, by the way, Zen Studios and PopCap did make a DLC
5511700	5517140	for their interactive Zen Pinball 2 and Pinball FX 2.
5518100	5521140	So there's Pants vs. Zombies Table in there.
5521140	5524180	And then Dark Horse Comics did a six-book adaptation
5524820	5529780	of the miniseries for iOS, and it was called Llamageddon.
5531140	5532580	And so there you go.
5533460	5536100	It's got all kinds of different cultural references in it.
5538100	5539860	Just it really is.
5540740	5544020	And don't forget, there was the Plants vs. Zombies level
5544020	5545860	in World of Warcraft.
5546660	5547620	Oh, that's right.
5547620	5548820	They did like a tie-in thing.
5548820	5549780	Yeah, yeah.
5549780	5550820	The Sunflower.
5550820	5551320	Yes.
5552020	5556100	You know, I was looking up online to kind of see, like,
5556100	5557860	what has PopCap kind of been doing?
5557860	5561540	And, you know, there was, like, Plants vs. Zombies 3.
5561540	5564180	But I feel like this Plants vs. Zombies kind of really came
5564180	5566100	from, like, a heyday era of PopCap games.
5566100	5568020	There were so many cute things they were making between,
5568020	5570660	like, you know, Bejeweled, Astro Pop, Chuzzle,
5571700	5573380	Hegel kind of all came from this era.
5573380	5574500	I still love Hegel.
5574500	5576740	Yeah, and then I don't know, like, you know,
5576740	5578660	they're still putting out some sequels and things like that.
5578660	5581060	But I don't know if this is related to the fact that they
5581060	5583620	laid off a bunch of people in 2012, which is really too bad.
5584420	5587780	But there's definitely a heyday of PopCap games
5587780	5588660	that I really miss.
5589620	5590120	Yeah.
5590660	5594340	This game is definitely, I think, pretty much at the top
5594340	5597380	of the list for, oh, something fell off my desk,
5597380	5601780	but for fun, you know, and for being something that's
5601780	5603380	a little bit less casual.
5603380	5605380	Like, you're not playing Bejeweled or Hegel.
5605940	5609060	You've got to put some strategy and time into this one.
5609060	5610020	So it was great.
5610020	5611700	And there's a lot of people in chat kind of commenting,
5611700	5612580	oh, yeah, this was great.
5612660	5614900	I wasted a lot of time with this when I first got an iPad,
5614900	5616100	like those types of things.
5616100	5621140	So I remember my old flip phone and playing Bejeweled on that.
5622580	5623860	That was back in the day.
5623860	5626580	I played a lot of these games on Xbox 360, honestly.
5628500	5633380	Yeah, but I played through this on PC when I beat it.
5633380	5634580	So all with a mouse.
5635300	5636740	There it is, your classic game of the week,
5636740	5638180	Plants versus Zombies.
5638900	5640660	I'm sure many of you have tried that at some point,
5640660	5643300	but if not, this is a chance for you to experience
5643300	5644980	some of the heyday of the PopCap games,
5645620	5647300	the really fun cartoony stuff.
5647300	5651540	So, all right, let's take a minute to travel around
5651540	5652500	and do some rapid fire news.
5653060	5654740	I should talk about this, too, at some point.
5654740	5656180	I really should have said this at the beginning of the night,
5656180	5657300	but I'm a little off tonight.
5658660	5662260	You guys raised enough points for Shane and I to do
5662260	5665860	our stream about the Shane's definitive Pokemon ranking.
5666420	5668580	We are looking tentatively at doing that this week.
5668660	5671620	I will confirm that on Twitter and on our VOG Network Discord,
5671620	5673460	vognetwork.com slash Discord.
5673460	5675620	We're looking at doing that on tax day.
5675620	5677540	That's all contingent on how I'm feeling
5677540	5679300	and if Shane gets his PowerPoint done.
5681140	5682340	There's going to be PowerPoint?
5682340	5682840	Yes.
5684740	5688900	There wasn't going to be until he said something in like,
5688900	5690580	how am I going to show off these Pokemon?
5690580	5691860	Am I going to do a PowerPoint?
5691860	5694660	And I'm like, now that you said it, I need that to happen.
5694660	5698100	That's awesome.
5699220	5702180	So we're looking at the 15th, but we may bump it back a week.
5702180	5704900	I don't want you guys to be pissed off if we bump it back a week.
5704900	5708340	So it all depends on Shane's availability as well,
5708340	5710260	because he does have spring break this next week.
5710260	5713380	So he's a lot more available than he will be after that.
5713380	5715060	So anyway, stay tuned to the Discord and all that stuff.
5715060	5716340	We'll get you the final date.
5716340	5721140	And of course, if you are subscribed here at VOG Network on Twitch,
5721140	5723540	you can use your Amazon Prime subscription.
5723540	5726980	You get a free one every month and you can use it right here at VOG Network.
5726980	5730260	And you get access to our back catalog of all the videos.
5730260	5733620	So you can watch all your favorite episodes of Orange on its Radio and Bobby Black Wolf,
5733620	5736660	at least the ones that were done on Twitch over the past two plus years.
5736660	5738020	There's quite an archive there now.
5738020	5739940	You can go back and watch those on demand whenever you want,
5739940	5742660	as well as the special streams we're trying to cook up.
5742660	5747700	So if Dark Soccer and I do end up doing an extra stage show with Dead by Daylight,
5747700	5749780	that'll be something you can watch in the video archives
5749780	5753380	and also the definitive Pokemon ranking and all that good stuff.
5753860	5756260	Yeah, if it's going to be something after Orange Lounge,
5756260	5758820	though, I will probably only be able to do commentary.
5759780	5760500	Oh, not tonight.
5760500	5763940	And I'm not saying tonight, but I'm saying like after the show sometime.
5763940	5764500	Oh, no.
5766100	5768020	Doing the show kind of drains me sometimes.
5768740	5769380	No, me too.
5769380	5770660	And especially today.
5771380	5774340	But we'll find a day that works for both of us.
5775300	5779220	As long as it's the only other day that's occupied at VOG Network right now is Tuesdays
5779220	5780100	with Anime Jam Session.
5780100	5781700	So as long as it's not that day.
5781700	5784900	And even then, we could still do it before or after.
5784900	5786020	So we'll work it out.
5786020	5788820	Do you know what next Sunday is?
5790820	5791700	Is that your birthday?
5791700	5792420	No, next Sunday.
5792420	5793700	The day before my birthday.
5793700	5794340	The day before.
5794340	5796500	I'm like, no, your birthday is not the 18th.
5796500	5798900	OK, yeah, it is getting close, though.
5799700	5802100	All right, let's move on.
5802100	5803300	Let's do some rapid fire news.
5803300	5803800	Loki.
5804900	5808980	Yeah, so this death loop that we keep hearing about
5808980	5811700	that's coming to PlayStation 5.
5812420	5813940	Well, it's been delayed.
5813940	5816180	It's going to be coming now September 14th.
5816180	5818980	It originally was set to release May 21st.
5819620	5823780	But, you know, as with most of these games that are getting delayed, they just needed
5823780	5829060	some additional time COVID-19 and, you know, just more polished.
5829060	5834660	So we'll look forward to that in September and more trailers for the game again.
5835620	5840820	And then, of course, we're also getting some Streets of Rage 4 DLC.
5840820	5846500	So the Mr. X Nightmare is going to have a new mode, some new music, and also you'll be
5846500	5849140	able to play as Estelle Aguer.
5851300	5852260	So that's pretty cool.
5852260	5857220	I still haven't played Streets of Rage 4 yet, but it looks really nice.
5857220	5859700	I really like the art style that they have with that.
5859780	5866020	And here it's pretty much, you know, same type of gameplay as the originals.
5866020	5868100	So check it out.
5870180	5870680	All right.
5871860	5873700	If that's it, then we'll go to Dark Sakura.
5873700	5876420	Sorry, I know you're focused on that hype train in chat right now.
5876420	5878260	I actually was chewing.
5878260	5879220	No. Oh, that's right.
5879860	5880340	Thank you.
5880340	5881460	I thank you.
5881460	5885860	I know since we're recording the podcast, I don't often acknowledge all the every follow
5885860	5887140	and every bitty donation, all that.
5887140	5889860	But you guys really don't have to be so generous.
5889860	5891780	We just did another.
5891780	5893220	No, that's the tickers catching up.
5893220	5894580	We did another anonymous cheer come in.
5894580	5897620	Somebody just anonymously donated a thousand bitties.
5897620	5898180	Thank you so much.
5898180	5899060	You guys don't really.
5899060	5900820	And there's many other cheers going on, too.
5900820	5902340	I will acknowledge them all at the end of the show.
5902340	5903460	We don't hate it.
5903460	5904740	Yeah, thank you guys so much.
5905620	5907700	Of course, we don't hate it, but you don't have to.
5907700	5909540	And we just so deeply appreciate that.
5909540	5909780	Thank you.
5909780	5910340	Thank you.
5910340	5911780	Anyway, Dark Sakura, rapid fire news.
5912420	5918420	So someone unlocked, you know, when Disney's rave came out and I'm talking about the Japanese
5918420	5925380	PlayStation one DDR Disney's rave, it didn't have a maniac mode in it.
5925380	5929140	And we knew it was supposed to have one on the American version of it.
5929140	5930020	It did have that.
5932420	5935860	But what's interesting, though, is that they didn't have it.
5935860	5939380	Maybe they wanted to keep it easy because it was intended, you know, for kids.
5939380	5941060	I mean, the arcade version have it.
5942660	5947300	And of course, they had done like all of this music through avex tracks and everything.
5947300	5948260	So it was really great.
5949700	5954580	But someone without the use of cheats or anything.
5956180	5963380	Unlocked maniac steps, step charts in this game.
5963380	5964180	So they were in the game.
5964180	5968340	I mean, people were unlocking them with like pro action replays and stuff like that.
5968900	5970100	But someone did it.
5970180	5977060	And when you save your game, it will save those unlocked charts for you.
5977060	5984340	So be looking for some Dex files out there, which, by the way, very recently I found all
5984340	5986180	of my Dex drive saves.
5986180	5986660	I thought it was.
5986660	5987160	Oh, wow.
5988180	5996660	The person who did this, by the way, has a video where they go through on how to unlock
5996660	5997540	everything.
5997540	6008820	And but there is a also a Twitter post that I will be posting in chat, but it's absolutely
6008820	6009460	fascinating.
6009460	6014740	It really is quite intricate and is based on time and visual cues and stuff like that.
6015460	6020420	So I kind of I'm kind of thinking I might have to bust out my game.
6021060	6022340	I still have all my stuff.
6023860	6024980	I miss Disney's rave.
6024980	6028260	It didn't have a ton of songs compared to what else was out at the time.
6028260	6032340	But it had some really killer Disney remixes, like the electrical parade and that stuff.
6033060	6034020	Oh, gosh, yes.
6034020	6036180	By the way, can I do a quick tangent?
6036180	6037140	It's important.
6037140	6037700	Okay.
6037700	6042740	Since we're going to talk about this era of DDR and all this stuff, I was not alerted
6042740	6047300	to the fact that Erotic, the band that was in DDR and all that stuff.
6047300	6050180	I was not alerted that their back catalog went up on Spotify.
6050180	6054820	And I'm assuming Apple Music and all the comparables in the past few months.
6054900	6060660	Because Erotics, thank you for the music, their ABBA tribute album.
6060660	6062820	So, like, ten ABBA songs on this album.
6062820	6064260	Which is a great album.
6064260	6065540	It's a fucking bop.
6065540	6069940	Like, it has one of the most underrated ABBA songs they covered, Angel Eyes.
6069940	6070740	I love that song.
6071380	6073380	And they do a killer version of it.
6073380	6078580	And yeah, so I just just as a side note, because I love the music in Disney's rave.
6078580	6081940	And of course, I love the cheesy Eurodance shit.
6081940	6083460	That's what made DDR so great.
6083460	6085540	So, like, Erotic is a huge example of that.
6085540	6087220	Yes, it's a band called Erotic.
6087220	6090660	I think they were in Germany or something called E-rotic.
6090660	6094660	And they did, like, Do It All Night, I think was probably one of the biggest songs they
6094660	6095460	did for DDR.
6096580	6098260	I think that's the one that everybody kind of knows.
6098980	6100420	Oh, Nick, please not so quick.
6100420	6101220	Well, that's my favorite.
6101220	6103780	But I think Do It All Night is the one that people recognize.
6103780	6105860	Because that song got played a lot in the arcade.
6105860	6106360	So.
6108020	6108520	Nice.
6110100	6110600	All right.
6111540	6112500	So, in other news.
6112500	6113000	Yes, please.
6113620	6117620	Um, we are getting an Alex Kidd.
6117620	6119220	Oh, I want to mention something real fast.
6119940	6126260	So you mentioned that the Disney's rave that they unlocked Maniac for the PlayStation version.
6126260	6128020	They also did it for the arcade version.
6129300	6129800	Oh, wow.
6130580	6131620	So that was something else.
6131620	6135780	They found a hidden maniac mode as well that was unlockable in the test menu.
6136740	6142900	So you can actually do that and unlock that as well on the arcade version, which is pretty
6142900	6143400	exciting.
6143540	6147060	Too bad that Disney's rave machine at Roosevelt Golf lands in a dumpster somewhere.
6147780	6148280	Yeah.
6148900	6155460	I never did get the multi-disc to work with Disney's rave on my cabinet.
6156100	6157380	I tried.
6157380	6157880	All right.
6158260	6159380	Let Jamie finish.
6159380	6161620	But that is a good thing.
6161620	6168020	Alice Kidd in Miracle World remake is coming out on June 24th for PC and consoles.
6168580	6174980	Um, so Sega merge games and, uh, junk and team, um, have announced that they're going
6174980	6179860	to be releasing it and it looks like it's going to be in that same sort of style as,
6179860	6181780	uh, the wonder boy games.
6182340	6183780	So cool.
6183780	6185060	I love Alice Kidd.
6185060	6185220	Yeah.
6185220	6186180	I'm looking forward to this.
6186180	6188900	I remember that trailer kind of surprised us some time ago.
6188900	6189700	So I'm excited.
6189700	6191540	It's finally coming out just in time for my birthday.
6192420	6193540	So perfect.
6194180	6196580	And OLR's birthday, which happened to be the same week.
6197220	6197720	All right.
6198180	6200420	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
6200420	6204100	Things that are coming out a little sooner than Alex Kidd's re-imagined.
6204100	6205620	So Loki, we'll start with the U S.
6206420	6206660	All right.
6206660	6212900	So we have a poison control on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four, uh, Tasso Machi behind
6212900	6218900	the Twilight on PC, uh, fighting the X layer, another dash on the Nintendo switch saga,
6218900	6223220	frontier remastered on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation four iOS and Android.
6223780	6227540	Uh, it looks like shadow man remastered on PC.
6228420	6231620	Uh, Sichi and Tukey trouble on into the switch.
6232180	6236260	And last but not least super meat boy forever on PlayStation four and X-Box one.
6237140	6237620	That's it.
6239780	6242180	I've not heard great things about the super meat boy sequel.
6242180	6244980	Unfortunately, I'll be skipping that one.
6244980	6250020	Um, moving on, uh, let's look at Japan coming out on the Nintendo switch winning post nine
6250020	6250820	2021.
6250820	6252420	I'm sure you're all excited about that.
6252420	6256180	That is going to be coming out on the switch as well as gear club unlimited too.
6256180	6258020	That is also out in Japan this week.
6258020	6262500	Getting a price reduction this week, the liar princess and the blind prince gets a price
6262500	6263700	reduction this week.
6263700	6265540	Uh, this is, this is kind of neat.
6265540	6270420	This is getting a release in Japan, a 2064 read only memories integral.
6270420	6274100	Uh, that is the, uh, I forgot that this game kind of caught on in Japan.
6274100	6278660	I think because people saw it as kind of like a snatcher, uh, kind of influenced game.
6278660	6278980	Yeah.
6279540	6283220	So, uh, it's, it's, that game came out forever ago too.
6283860	6284500	Originally.
6284500	6288740	It seems like that was, so that was like gamer X two or three when they were announcing that
6288740	6289060	one.
6289060	6290740	So that was a while ago.
6290740	6291940	So, uh, that's cool though.
6291940	6293860	Congrats to everybody behind that.
6293860	6296980	Um, and, uh, let's see, did I hit everything for Japan?
6296980	6298020	Yes, I did for the switch.
6298020	6298340	I did.
6298340	6303460	Let's take a look at the PS five and the PS four, nothing on PS five this week.
6303460	6310420	But as we look at the PlayStation four, if I stop losing my place, I imagine we'll see
6310420	6312740	a lot of the similar stuff that we saw on the Nintendo switch.
6313380	6313700	Yes.
6313700	6318180	Including winning post nine 2021 and the liar princess and the blind prince.
6318180	6319380	But we have some other stuff too.
6319380	6324900	The king of fighters, 2002 unlimited match comes out on PlayStation four this week.
6324900	6330420	And I'll alt deuce beyond Kronos in regular and limited edition.
6331140	6331780	How about that?
6332820	6333220	All right.
6333220	6335540	That's it for your releases in Japan.
6335540	6336740	How about the UK dark Sakura?
6337380	6340980	One thing for PS five doom three VR.
6342180	6342660	All right.
6343860	6345700	So, so it is all right.
6345700	6350740	A few more stories and then we will get your comments in our chat over at twitch.tv slash
6350740	6352980	vog network in the listener round table.
6352980	6355700	Um, but for now let's get a few more stories.
6355700	6356200	Loki.
6357140	6361860	So, uh, six days in Fallujah is definitely a controversial game.
6361860	6369540	And, uh, basically the, uh, there's a care, which is, uh, the council for American Islamic
6369540	6372340	relations has called it an Arab murder simulator.
6372980	6378660	And they're calling for Microsoft and Sony and valve to ban it on their platforms, um,
6378660	6383380	from hosting the game, basically saying that it will only normalize violence against Muslims
6383380	6384900	in America and around the world.
6385540	6388980	And the game industry must stop the human D human.
6389060	6390340	And that I can't talk today.
6390340	6395700	Um, dehumanizing Muslims, uh, video games like six days of Fallujah only served to glorify
6395700	6401460	violence that took the lives of hundreds of Iraqi civilians, uh, justify the Iraqi war
6401460	6406740	and the reinforce the anti-Muslim sentiment at a time when anti-Muslim bigotry continues
6406740	6408020	to threaten human lives.
6408740	6412020	Um, yeah, I mean, I don't know.
6412020	6414020	I thought this game had been canceled at one time.
6414020	6414660	I mean, it was.
6415700	6418420	So now it's coming back, but it seems controversial.
6418420	6423140	I don't know if they're gonna, we'll see what happens with it, but yeah, I see their
6423140	6423620	point.
6423620	6424580	My only, yeah, no.
6424580	6429780	And I, I watched, um, uh, a Muslim individual who is watching the trailer who is, you know,
6429780	6433460	kind of just narrating along with it, pointing out everything that was really upsetting about
6433460	6433860	it.
6433860	6435940	Um, and so I, you know, and I get it.
6435940	6443300	My only concern here is, is that I worry that this type of campaign is causing the game
6443300	6446740	to get more visibility and more promotion because I'm gonna be on it.
6446740	6449220	I don't think, I don't think people really gave a damn about this game.
6449220	6449860	I really don't.
6449860	6453940	I don't think there's people that were going to be interested in buying this at all.
6453940	6459700	I'm worried that with this campaign going on, it's only bringing this type of attention
6459700	6459940	to it.
6459940	6464420	Look here, we are talking about it and I'm sure plenty of other gaming blogs, plenty
6464420	6466900	of other podcasts, plenty of other YouTube's also talking about it.
6466900	6471940	And there are going to be people out there who say, Oh, you don't want me to play this?
6471940	6473060	Well, then I'm buying it.
6473380	6479940	And so I'm just, I'm, I'm a little concerned in some ways it's going to have the opposite
6479940	6486180	effect, but I don't want to, I mean, obviously the concerns, you know, I legit and all that.
6486180	6491860	So, um, it seems like taking away the platform may end up being the only solution.
6491860	6494420	I just don't see that happening with steam.
6494420	6499620	I really don't, um, put a dick in it and it'll get removed from steam, put a vajay in it
6499620	6501380	and it'll get removed from steam.
6501380	6506420	But, um, unfortunately, um, murder simulators are fine on steam.
6506420	6506980	We know that.
6507860	6513380	So you may have better luck with the console space, but I just, I just worry there's,
6513380	6516740	there's going to be probably more people that are going to buy this game just because they're
6516740	6520180	not supposed to then probably would have bought this in the first place.
6522020	6524580	There are the morbid, the morbidly curious.
6524580	6525060	Yeah.
6525060	6528180	Uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, buy it before it gets deplatformed.
6528180	6530100	There's absolutely going to be that audience.
6530100	6536580	So, um, yeah, so I don't know, maybe we shouldn't be talking about it, but it is, uh, it is
6536580	6538260	a show about what gamers are talking about.
6538260	6541380	And this is a headline that is going all the way around the industry right now.
6541380	6542340	So anyway.
6542900	6543220	All right.
6543220	6544500	I shan't be buying it.
6545060	6551060	Uh, it's just, it's just, it was not a game that was on my radar before and it's certainly
6551060	6551700	not now.
6551700	6552260	You know what I mean?
6553140	6557380	There are those people who like those battle simulation games like that, you know, who
6557380	6559060	are really into those war games.
6560100	6565220	And I wouldn't doubt, I mean, I know people who would probably have been like, Oh yeah,
6565220	6566580	that's going to be a great game.
6566580	6569700	And, you know, but they also are very insensitive people.
6569700	6571540	The people I can think of off the top of my head.
6571540	6574340	One DJRMS in chat says I will be buying this game.
6574340	6580580	And so, you know, I, but for me, I prefer my war simulators to be sci-fi.
6580580	6581780	So Outriders is fine.
6582500	6583300	Mass Effect's cool.
6583860	6588100	But I don't, I don't like, I don't like the Call of Duty and that's the, the, I like it
6588100	6591220	when it's fake, not when it's based on reality.
6591220	6591460	What?
6591460	6596420	I definitely understand how this could contribute to more Islamophobia.
6596980	6598020	Yes, yes.
6598820	6599540	All right.
6599540	6600420	Well, let's move on.
6600420	6603940	Let's talk about a game that, uh, boy, you want to really feel hopeless.
6603940	6605940	Check out this game, Death Stranding.
6605940	6610980	It's, uh, it's such an interestingly timed game this Death Stranding was.
6610980	6614900	And Death Stranding, of course, came out on PC as well as on PlayStation.
6614900	6616580	And that was a pretty huge deal.
6616580	6619460	And some people were kind of wondering, well, how's it going to do on PC?
6619460	6621860	And the answer is pretty damn well, it seems like.
6622420	6626900	Death Stranding, 505 games, biggest hit, who is the publisher on PC?
6627780	6630500	Their biggest hit during 2020.
6632260	6632980	Very interesting.
6632980	6638340	The game generated 27 million between July and the end of 2020.
6639060	6642580	There was also Control, I think it was a game 505 games did.
6642580	6648340	Comparably, that was about 19 million, but they also had some sales in 2019.
6648340	6650740	So you can't really say it's apples to oranges there.
6651860	6657300	But yeah, Death Stranding, their biggest title amongst some other games that they've published.
6657300	6660660	And 27 million sounds like a pretty good chunk of change.
6661620	6663460	Probably worth it for Sony to put.
6663460	6666900	I mean, even though, you know, it's a publishing agreement with Kajima and all that.
6666900	6670740	Probably explains a lot why the PlayStation games end up coming out on PC later,
6670740	6674180	because it gets the game exposed to a much wider audience, that's for sure.
6677700	6680180	Death Stranding, I really need to go back and finish that at some point.
6680740	6684980	It was just such an interesting game, the ambience in that game, too.
6684980	6687780	And you really got into the story, right, Dark Saga?
6687780	6688660	Yeah, I did.
6688660	6689540	Our lore queen.
6690660	6691620	Well, yeah.
6691620	6696260	But I mean, the thing is that it annoys me when there is a game
6696260	6698900	that this much work has been done into it, done to it.
6699540	6702340	And people don't look at the story.
6702340	6707700	You know, I think that knowing the story behind something helps with the immersion.
6709060	6713060	That when you are playing this game and you know these people in this game,
6713780	6718580	it makes you care about what happens to them, which is like reading a book, right?
6718580	6720500	But I'm not going to buy that game.
6720500	6721460	It's a walking.
6721460	6722900	All you do in that game is you walk.
6722900	6723700	It's a walking.
6723700	6725300	I could go walk in real life.
6726340	6727780	You know what I tell those people?
6727780	6728580	What?
6728580	6729540	Green eggs and ham.
6731380	6734420	Means you don't know the whole point of that story was you don't know you're
6734420	6735780	going to like something until you try it.
6738100	6739620	Well, yes, I am Sam, I am.
6741220	6743620	I would eat it in a box and I would eat it with a fox.
6744660	6746100	I would play it here or there.
6746100	6747220	I would play it anywhere.
6750260	6752260	I like Death Stranding, Sam, I am.
6752820	6753940	I like it.
6753940	6755380	Now get the fuck out of my face.
6755380	6760100	SSG100Matt says walk off the comment section you're complaining on then.
6762500	6763000	All right.
6764100	6764660	Oh, my God.
6765620	6768740	Brain just had one of those random brain thoughts that I tend to have.
6768740	6770980	OK, you're welcome to it because I've had plenty tonight.
6772740	6778340	The main character of Green Eggs and Ham could have gotten a restraining order.
6781860	6783060	Against Sam, I am.
6783060	6785620	That wouldn't make for a very fun book, though.
6785620	6786260	No, it wouldn't.
6786820	6788020	But I was just thinking.
6788020	6792100	Unless they can do it with rhyming, in which case then I'm on board.
6792100	6794100	And some on Fox News would say that's what
6794100	6796500	liberal America has already done to Dr. Seuss's books.
6797780	6802580	Well, granted, knowing those books and having used to own them when I was a kid.
6804420	6805940	You're preaching to the choir here.
6805940	6809620	They didn't ban Green Eggs and Ham, but they sure make it sound like it sometimes.
6810500	6811000	Yeah.
6811320	6815240	The books they banned, you probably weren't aware of and with good reason.
6815240	6815880	You know what I mean?
6815880	6820120	Although it happened on Mulberry Street was one of the more well-known of them.
6821800	6822520	All right.
6822520	6824600	Like I had a couple of copies of that as a kid.
6825640	6826120	All right.
6826120	6826840	Let's move on.
6828040	6828600	Video games.
6828600	6829080	Star Saga.
6829080	6829800	What's your next story?
6831000	6836520	So the U.S. government is getting involved in the video games, actually.
6836520	6837800	This is actually a pretty cool thing.
6838120	6843480	The U.S. State Department is actually having running a video game development exchange program.
6844200	6848360	And this is in conjunction with the United Nations.
6849400	6855720	So basically, the U.N. member states set goals back in 2015
6859160	6866680	to handle international topics that affect the world in general, like ending poverty,
6867320	6869720	improving health and education, reducing inequality,
6869720	6872760	and combating climate change to conserve oceans and forests.
6873560	6879400	So basically, we have this thing now called Games for Change.
6879400	6884200	The U.S. State Department has now joined in through its sponsorship of the Stevens Initiative.
6885800	6889880	And it is a virtual student exchange program for students in the U.S.,
6889880	6893400	Israel, United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain.
6894360	6901720	So what they're going to be doing with these games, and they basically picked games because
6901720	6906040	they're sort of a common ground amongst the students that they're involving in it,
6906040	6909480	about 2,700 students between 6 and 12 years old.
6911560	6916280	But they've got different teachers that are trained through this Games for Change
6916280	6919720	to give guidance to the students as they work on their project.
6920360	6926600	And they also will have mentors in academia and former participants.
6927160	6931160	But the whole point of it would be to create a game that highlights something,
6932760	6940200	one of those major points the United Nations is focusing on to improve the world.
6940200	6942920	I mean, basically, just big challenges to humanity across the board.
6944680	6948600	A few of the titles that have come out of Games for Change in the past are
6948600	6957400	GREE, which is very, very good and melancholy, Sky Children of the Light and Dreams.
6957400	6959560	They all talk about contemporary social issues.
6962120	6967400	And the Stevens Initiative is, you know, along the lines, this is why they're working with
6967400	6973400	Games for Change, but they also want to bring young people together in U.S., the Middle East,
6973400	6978920	in North Africa to, and this is the quote from here, increase their career readiness
6978920	6982840	and encourage sharing knowledge amongst different cultures and countries.
6983800	6991320	So it's also one of the notes to sponsors that the initiative, while it was founded in,
6992040	6994280	while it's sponsored in grants from the U.S. State Department,
6994280	6998440	it's also sponsored by the governments of Morocco and the United Arab Emirates.
6999240	7003560	So I think this is pretty awesome.
7003560	7005080	World peace through video games.
7006440	7007080	Pardon?
7007080	7008760	I said world peace through video games.
7009480	7013000	Well, it could happen. You start, you start young.
7013000	7018040	Well, you know, I mean, if you subscribe to the idea that video games are an art form,
7018040	7024840	which I do, this is really about bringing art and stories from other cultures into, you know,
7025160	7030600	um, into the world through the experience of a video game. That's a great thing.
7031320	7036200	The other thing that I'm thinking of is that first of all, hate is taught.
7037000	7037400	True.
7037400	7043320	Children are taught to hate. If you have children working with an international group,
7043320	7047480	with people whose points and views could be vastly different than their own,
7048360	7053560	it's a great way to teach about those differences while everyone is learning.
7053560	7056920	Because it's also promotes, you know, STEM skills.
7058920	7062920	And I would actually be really curious to see if they've got any sort of focus
7062920	7066600	on, um, on girls participating in this.
7067320	7067640	Sure.
7067640	7073160	I think it'd be absolutely delightful, but I think that they're on the right path for that.
7073160	7077080	Not only do games, you know, not only are they fun, not only are there something that
7077080	7081720	kids are interested in, but you learn the programming, the design aspect,
7081720	7084360	you learn all kinds of stuff with it.
7084360	7089080	And I think it's just a great platform to try to make a positive change in the world.
7091080	7091580	All right.
7092680	7096760	Well, let's move on from the, to our next story. We just have a couple more stories left,
7096760	7100360	and then we'll get to our listener round table via our chat room over Twitch.
7100360	7101560	And our one email.
7101560	7104200	Twitch.tv slash vog network and the one email that we got.
7105560	7109400	Sweet Nika is in our chat tonight saying, as someone who works in education,
7109400	7113320	this sounds like a really good platform to utilize and advertise for sure.
7113320	7113820	Yeah.
7114200	7120120	Actually Nika, you were actually one of the people I thought of, um, when I saw that article.
7120760	7121260	Awesome.
7122200	7123000	All right.
7123000	7124040	Loki, what do you have for us?
7125000	7132440	So, um, being that last week was Easter Sunday, um, there was a post that went out from a
7132440	7138760	fellow game dev, uh, Jan Willem Nijman, who said today's Easter game devs,
7138840	7142120	please respond to the best Easter eggs you've ever hit in a game.
7142120	7144280	And there was some responses with that.
7144840	7151320	So we got one response from Patrick Wren, who was apparently in charge of some of the different
7151320	7153720	campaigns in halo five.
7154280	7160760	And he mentioned that there was a halo cart racing or a hidden, like a halo cart racing
7160760	7165160	for four player co-op, um, in his mission evacuation.
7165160	7171080	And then I guess at the end of it, um, the person that wins the race gets a heavy weapon.
7171720	7177480	Um, and then of course, you know, it, it took, uh, you know, a lot of people just trying to figure
7177480	7182280	it out over the course of the weekend and following the week to try to figure out how
7182280	7184360	to actually unlock that in the game.
7184360	7191320	So they finally figured it out by waiting by this one, uh, door for 117 seconds, the
7191320	7192840	master chief's number.
7192840	7199800	Um, of course, apparently opens the door and then it, it spawns you on these among goose
7199800	7201480	and despawns the enemies in the game.
7201480	7204520	So they get the actually race, but you have to have four players who do that too.
7204520	7206200	So you don't have to wait by the door.
7206200	7207000	So that's kind of cool.
7207640	7209400	I think this one takes the cake though.
7209400	7213800	Um, apparently, and I was completely unaware of this cause I'm a pretty big fan of times
7213800	7220680	players, but, um, home front, the revolution, which was, um, brought to us by Dan buster
7220680	7221240	studios.
7221880	7224440	They had an Easter egg in the game.
7224440	7228920	Um, that included, there was two levels from time splitters too.
7228920	7233640	Well, apparently though, there was also a code that was hidden that actually unlocks
7233640	7241240	the full game playable within home front, the revolution and this, uh, developer Matt
7241240	7247560	Phillips, he actually hid the fully playable, um, or he was responsible for part of that.
7247560	7250520	And, um, but he couldn't remember what the code was.
7251240	7258120	And then, then of course, um, come to the internet, uh, there was apparently this individual
7258120	7260520	Spencer, uh, pair route.
7260520	7266680	Um, he figured out what the code was and posted it online to, for everyone to check out.
7266680	7273080	So now you can actually play a, uh, time splitters too, that actually runs natively in 4k.
7273800	7277400	Of course, you know, the graphics are from the PlayStation too, so it doesn't look all
7277400	7280360	that great, but, but still it, it is still pretty cool.
7280440	7282120	That exists out there.
7282120	7285000	So, um, yeah.
7285000	7286600	Um, wow.
7286600	7289160	So people need to be that bold more often.
7289160	7291720	Hey, game developers, tell us a secret.
7291720	7292040	Okay.
7292760	7294440	Well, I was curious though, like there's like,
7294440	7295720	It's amazing that it worked.
7296280	7300280	Uh, reading through that thread as well to see like what other responses, like folks
7300280	7303080	that had some other smaller, like Easter eggs.
7303080	7309640	So there was one, um, for, uh, roller coaster tycoon three, that one of the designers had
7310280	7312680	made animal toys to look like Katamari's.
7313880	7314760	They're a fan of the game.
7315320	7322920	Um, this guy in this game, Lena's inception, it apparently pulls a server for custom dialogue
7322920	7327400	sequences, meaning that they can mess with streamers live so they can change the dialogue
7327400	7329640	in the game, which I thought was funny.
7329640	7329960	Wow.
7329960	7333880	Um, they had, uh, let's see here.
7334200	7341720	There's, uh, someone that hid the Dino mini game from Chrome, um, in some other game.
7342520	7348040	I don't know, lots of fun stuff, but yeah, I can't really tell what it was.
7348040	7350920	Um, Oh, here's, here's a good one.
7350920	7357800	So apparently in plants versus zombies, garden warfare, um, there was one of the artists,
7357800	7363000	I guess, had made, uh, Outset Island, the silhouette for one of the vistas.
7363240	7366760	So you see that from, uh, the legend of Zelda Wind Waker.
7368040	7368840	That's cool.
7369160	7369640	Yeah.
7369640	7372680	Um, what an, what an appropriate one to bring up for this show.
7372680	7373000	Yeah.
7373000	7373560	Right.
7373560	7377720	Uh, Bobby Black Wolf in chat is saying I hid Loki in a tingle costume in a game.
7378840	7379480	That's right.
7379480	7382680	He did that game might still be available.
7382680	7387720	In fact, somewhere I hid a tingle in our logo, except I didn't hide him very well.
7387720	7388680	He didn't hide him very well.
7388680	7389560	He didn't hide him very well.
7391240	7391640	All right.
7392280	7397160	Um, let's move on one more story that's going around this week has to do with a new speedrun
7397160	7401800	record, just as I'm sure you're all getting ready for the, uh, virtual summer game stunt
7401800	7405080	quick that's still months off, but still much rejoicing.
7405080	7411080	We, we love a speedrun news and the news this week is that the super Mario brothers speedrun
7411080	7416680	that existed has been beaten the fastest anyone could get through the game used to be four
7416680	7418440	minutes and 55 seconds.
7419000	7421000	Uh, and that was back in 2018.
7422200	7428520	But now there is a new, uh, record, uh, Twitch streamer who goes by Niftski.
7428520	7429400	I hope I said that right.
7429400	7430040	Sorry.
7430040	7435240	Uh, has a new record that is four minutes and 54 seconds.
7436360	7441480	And if you want to get specific four 54, nine, four, eight.
7441480	7448200	So it is like, uh, five hundredths of a percent of a second faster.
7448200	7453880	It's it's like, but by mere frames, basically, uh, that this is be beaten.
7453880	7461560	Um, so apparently the, uh, there's a, a glitch in an eight one flag pole that allows you
7461560	7465480	to save that all important 0.35 seconds.
7465480	7469240	And that's what it is, is a new glitch that was exploited called the flag pole glitch.
7469800	7471160	So pretty cool.
7471160	7471960	Congrats.
7471960	7475160	And who knows what they'll find next to do that.
7475960	7476460	So.
7477000	7477500	All right.
7478120	7481240	Let's, uh, let's check out the mailbag every week.
7481240	7484840	You guys email us, participate at orange lounge radio dot com.
7484840	7487000	And we like to read your emails on the air.
7487000	7491400	Usually we have thousands of emails to pick from, and we really can only pick two or three
7491400	7492520	to read every week.
7492520	7494920	Um, but this week, unfortunately, we just had one.
7494920	7498120	Um, that's, that's the way it goes sometimes.
7498120	7500120	Participate at orange lounge radio.com.
7500120	7502680	If you want to send us an email for a future week, but dark soccer, please.
7504120	7504680	Greetings.
7504680	7509720	OLR last week, Rob mentioned that he was having trouble getting into monster hunter rise because
7509720	7514280	the weapon he was using was moving at quite the glacial pace to this.
7514280	7516600	I would like to make a couple of recommendations.
7516600	7518520	Have you tried switching up your weapons?
7518520	7521880	There are a few weapons that can move quite slow, but hit hard.
7521880	7526280	These can be fun, but they aren't for everyone and can be hard to use at first.
7526280	7529560	If you're wanting something fast, the dual blades might not be a bad start.
7530200	7534360	You'll run circles around the monster you're after, all while slashing and building up
7534360	7535640	your demon gauge.
7535640	7540200	I also recommend the bow as you can keep your distance and maintain good mobility, all by
7540200	7541800	chipping away at your prey.
7541800	7545000	Personally, the bow and the gun lance are my weapons of choice.
7545000	7548440	Each weapon is very different and has different controls.
7548440	7552840	So it's not a bad idea to look over how you use them in your hunter's notes menu.
7553320	7557880	You can also undertake training quests that will go over the basics of monster hunter
7557880	7559400	with monster hunter with you.
7560520	7564520	Honestly, I feel like rise is more friendly to beginners of the series.
7564520	7569080	I've originally played monster hunter world and could not get into it simply because I
7569080	7573160	felt very overwhelmed when that game threw everything at me at once.
7573160	7577160	Knowing what I have learned from rise, I make a world another shot in the future.
7577160	7579960	Have you tried playing together with Shane and hunting as a group?
7579960	7582280	This is a fantastic and fun way to learn.
7582360	7583960	Happy hunting, Garth Wolf.
7585000	7588280	Well, it's not for a lack of trying from Shane, that's for sure.
7588280	7592520	But no, because I haven't bought the game because I don't want to drop $60 on the game
7592520	7593960	when I play the demo.
7593960	7595720	And I'm like, I don't know if I'm really into this.
7595720	7596680	I don't think I care for this.
7596680	7598760	I think I'd rather just go play Pac-Man 99.
7599800	7604040	I didn't delete the demo and I think it still has like 28 charges left on it.
7604040	7608120	So I can probably go back in and try one of the dual blades things.
7608120	7611320	But I just don't think I'm into it.
7611400	7617640	And I think, you know what, and this is the kind of thing I've told Shane too, because
7617640	7619560	he's really, really tried to pitch that game to me.
7619560	7621960	And it's like, sometimes I'm just not going to be into it.
7621960	7625560	And it's like, how many times have I tried to get you to be into like No Man's Sky?
7625560	7626360	I love that game.
7626360	7627160	It's so cool.
7627160	7629720	You know, it's just, why don't you play that game?
7630280	7631800	Because he's playing Monster Hunter.
7631800	7633240	That's a game he does enjoy.
7633240	7637800	So I think sometimes it's just, you know, people have different tastes and that's what
7637800	7638300	it is.
7638840	7640440	That doesn't mean Monster Hunter is a bad game.
7641080	7643160	I'm just not feeling it.
7643160	7645720	But I promised Shane I would give it another go.
7645720	7648920	And so for the emailer, I will give the demo another go.
7648920	7655160	But I really don't see myself buying this game until it goes on sale, which considering
7655160	7657640	it's a Switch game, might be some time.
7658440	7659000	That's all.
7659000	7662440	Well, and as the saying goes, different strokes for different things.
7662440	7663160	Exactly.
7663880	7667160	Binary667 in our chat says Monster Hunter is divisive.
7667960	7669000	That's for sure.
7669000	7673560	I will say, and I meant this, the demo was light years beyond better than the one that
7673560	7675960	was on the Wii U, whichever one that was.
7675960	7679960	I can't tell them all apart, but it was light years better than that demo.
7679960	7680600	That's for sure.
7681720	7684600	Shane is also saying we'll also do the demo together next time.
7684600	7685880	So you have someone to play with.
7685880	7689720	Oh, then that means we'll do Expedition number two and No Man's Sky together as well.
7689720	7690360	Won't we, Shane?
7693000	7693800	I love that.
7693800	7694200	Wow.
7695000	7695320	Sorry.
7695400	7702520	I have to acknowledge somebody just gifted 10 subs in our community and it is unlabeled.
7703080	7705240	So I just want to say thank you to that.
7705960	7707080	Thank you, anonymous gifter.
7707080	7707240	Wow.
7707240	7707800	Thank you so much.
7707800	7710840	Thank you to everybody who's been very generous with that tonight.
7710840	7712440	You really don't have to, and you do.
7712440	7713160	All right.
7713160	7713720	All right.
7713720	7715000	Shane said, you know what?
7715000	7715720	Sure.
7715720	7716200	All right.
7717480	7719880	I'll give it a little if you are willing to.
7719880	7724440	I don't know if I'm willing to drop 60 bucks on Monster Hunter.
7724440	7727720	That's the problem, but I'll try the demo again.
7727720	7728280	That's for sure.
7729240	7731000	Okay, so there you go.
7731000	7732600	Who knew that Shane would be in chat listening?
7732600	7733160	How about that?
7734360	7734760	All right.
7735400	7736600	That is it for the mailbag.
7736600	7741000	If you guys have anything you want us to talk about, you can bring that up in our chat room.
7741640	7745000	Or I will turn it over to Loki and see if there's any last minute stories.
7745720	7748200	No, it's a slow week.
7748200	7751560	Yeah, I really feel like we kind of hit everything that was going on in the news, huh?
7752680	7753320	Pretty much.
7753320	7753800	Yeah.
7753800	7754300	Yeah.
7755160	7756200	All right.
7756200	7760040	Well, I'll give it another second there to see if any other topics jump out in our chat
7760040	7761080	or things to talk about.
7762040	7762840	What could I ask?
7762840	7765000	Any games you're looking forward to playing in this coming week?
7765720	7767720	I don't think there's anything really new coming out,
7767720	7771080	but I know I want to try to make some more progress in Outriders.
7772200	7776280	I guess this Monster Hunter demo thing will happen in the next few days as well.
7777720	7781080	I'm off work tomorrow, so I have plenty of time to vegetate and play games.
7781960	7787320	I took off work because I was assuming that I'm going to have horrible side effects to the thing,
7787320	7788760	but I'm feeling okay for now.
7788760	7791720	But I'm worried after the show, I'm going to completely crash and burn.
7793400	7794040	Hopefully not.
7795240	7798600	Shane is giving us a reminder in chat saying tonight is the last night.
7798600	7805320	In fact, you have 45 minutes left to pre-order the physical No More Heroes games one and two.
7806280	7807320	That's good to know.
7807320	7810200	Bobby in chat says hopefully you'll just sleep during the side effects.
7810200	7811080	That's the plan.
7812200	7816680	I think I'd love to just take a Tylenol PM and wake up at noon tomorrow.
7817480	7821160	Dan did a lot of sleeping after he got his second shot.
7821880	7825880	Of course, mine's going to be the day after my birthday on the 21st.
7825880	7832120	So I went ahead and put in to have the next day off at work and see how I feel.
7832120	7837480	Although I was sick for three days from the first shot.
7837480	7841240	So I can only imagine what I'd be like after the second.
7841240	7842120	I hope it's all right.
7843080	7843400	All right.
7843400	7844280	Well, it's worth it.
7844280	7845080	It's worth it.
7845080	7845720	Yeah, for sure.
7845720	7846600	It's absolutely worth it.
7846600	7849560	Because once you get your second shot, then we get to hang out indoors again.
7849560	7850120	That'll be fun.
7850120	7851160	At least for six months.
7851720	7852120	Yeah.
7852120	7854760	Well, well, and it may be longer.
7854760	7855560	They just don't know yet.
7856360	7858200	So at least six months.
7858200	7859400	So fingers and toes crossed.
7860040	7862360	All right, moving on.
7862360	7863960	Let's wrap it up.
7863960	7866600	Let's get to our final thoughts, I suppose.
7866600	7869720	I want to thank you guys very much for tuning into Orange Launch Radio tonight
7869720	7871960	and participating with our program.
7871960	7876120	If you like what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.
7876120	7879240	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
7879240	7883400	But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, then we can't do that.
7883400	7885240	So we play for the crickets.
7885240	7886280	Yes, we play for the crickets.
7887000	7891720	So a nice five star review on a place like iTunes or wherever it is you found this show.
7891720	7892920	That goes a very long way.
7893640	7894920	So thank you for all of that.
7895800	7898760	Thank you to everybody who sticks with us week in and week out.
7898760	7901080	864 in a row and next.
7901080	7903640	Well, not totally in a row, but, you know, mostly in a row.
7903640	7907720	And that A65 will be coming at you next week as we make our way to 1000.
7908440	7910760	And thanks for that hype train earlier, too.
7910760	7911260	Yes.
7911960	7913880	A big thanks to everybody who participates.
7913880	7916920	Of course, I want to send love to the podcast listeners because I know some people can't
7916920	7920360	be here Sunday night because like WrestleMania or whatever's going on.
7920360	7924600	But for those of you that do tune in on Twitch, we really, really appreciate you guys.
7924600	7928040	And especially that generosity you guys show throughout the week.
7928040	7932120	I don't care about one person on WrestleMania and that's Oscar.
7933320	7934280	She's awesome.
7934280	7936840	I have no idea who's even a wrestler.
7936840	7937880	She's adorable.
7937880	7939880	You need to watch her channel sometime.
7939880	7942680	I think I've seen her actually and probably because of you.
7943880	7946920	If I'm right, I think she was like a video game programmer.
7946920	7947800	I think so.
7947800	7949400	I think I've heard of her.
7949400	7952760	Yeah, she's the former Nintendo DS dev, says Bobby.
7953400	7953880	OK.
7953880	7954120	Yeah.
7954120	7956760	But I love her so much.
7956760	7960200	And I just like how Dan and I watch her channel and we're always like,
7960200	7961720	welcome to Kana-chan TV.
7961720	7964040	Yo, so every time it starts.
7964600	7964920	All right.
7964920	7968520	I'm only allowing wrestling talk because I talked for 30 minutes about Dead by Daylight tonight.
7968520	7969720	So I'm only Kana.
7970440	7972280	I only really care about her because she's great.
7972280	7972760	That's it.
7972760	7973320	The end.
7973320	7974040	Kana is adorable.
7976200	7980760	Thanks again to everybody who participates with the show, whether it's on the podcast or here live.
7980760	7982280	Hey, did you know we have a store as well?
7982280	7985320	If you want to get some merchandise, vognetwork.com slash shop.
7985320	7989320	And of course, our Discord server, vognetwork.com slash Discord.
7989320	7990840	If you want to stay in touch throughout the week
7990840	7993160	and find out when bonus streams are going to be happening.
7993160	7998360	Did you know our subscribers have secret access to a special bonus channel?
7998360	7999240	It doesn't get used much.
7999240	8002200	I'll have to post more pictures of Mr. Smoosh in there or something.
8002200	8002700	All right.
8004360	8006920	That's all I can think of for the plugs there at the end of the show.
8006920	8009720	So let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight.
8010440	8011480	Loki, I'll start with you.
8012760	8014440	Just more grinding at Minecraft.
8015160	8016600	That's going to be this week.
8016600	8017100	Yeah.
8018760	8025000	My final thought is last night at Target, I found the I almost said the pop cap doll,
8025000	8025720	but that's not what they're called.
8025720	8026680	The pop vinyls.
8027320	8030040	I got my Richard Simmons pop vinyl.
8030040	8030540	Finally.
8031240	8032200	So hooray for me.
8033000	8034760	Now you too can sweat to the oldies.
8034760	8035480	That's right.
8035480	8036680	I miss that guy.
8036680	8039240	I understand, but I understand it's complicated.
8039560	8041320	Last but not least, Dark Sakura.
8042600	8045160	Stay tuned after the stream.
8046280	8048520	Stay in chat for reasons.
8049400	8049720	Good.
8049720	8050600	Good orders.
8050600	8052600	We will see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio.
8052600	8054520	We'll be back to do it all in seven days.
