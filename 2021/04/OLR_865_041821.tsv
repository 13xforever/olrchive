0	29000	Homemark is making video game themed ornaments this year and I think that's awesome. I remember having ornaments of things I liked as a kid and they were cute but not relevant like this will be. I also learned that this is not the first time they've done this, that the NES and massively popular franchises had designs last year. Joining this year includes Sonic, Minecraft, and Sub-Zero! Wow.
30000	37000	Before we get that far, it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring us this and much more timely news starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.
40000	57000	Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight, April the 18th of 2021 with episode number 865 of our podcast.
57000	63000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
63000	64000	Hi.
64000	76000	Hi, and allow me to be the first to say happy birthday because I know I'm doing it a little early, but it's tomorrow, but when most of the podcasty people hear this it'll be your birthday.
76000	78000	Oh yeah, I will be older.
78000	79000	Yes.
79000	80000	By a day.
80000	81000	Yes.
81000	85000	Because you're not an instant year older, you're just a nuts member.
85000	94000	That's right. It's so funny because I always hear people make such a big deal about oh my god I'm turning 30 or oh my god I'm turning 40, and then it's like well 40 doesn't really feel any different. No, it doesn't.
94000	97000	Because, first of all, those children need to shut up.
97000	99000	I'm just saying.
99000	102000	First of all, get off my lawn. Second of all,
102000	107000	Second of all, get off my neighbor's lawn too kids.
107000	109000	But yeah, thank you, everybody.
109000	110000	I appreciate it.
110000	114000	All right, well, are you doing anything to celebrate?
114000	119000	Um, I might have another Animal Crossing birthday party. Oh fun.
119000	132000	Um, I was supposed to have my second Pfizer shot today. And I went to when they were scheduled me like, no, she like, why, because my birthday is on the 19th.
133000	148000	Please. She's like, Oh, I totally get that. Because I did actually I, you know, I felt it after the fact I did have. I was pretty sick for a couple of days and I'm only thinking I'll be even sicker, you know, with the second shot so Oh, oh girl, let me tell you.
148000	157000	So last week so LR, I got through the show just fine right. Oh, after about probably about two hours after the show wrapped up like 10 o'clock 11 o'clock.
157000	173000	Boom, boom, clap those side effects hit me like a truck. I was out of work for two days. I had fever and chill for about a day, and then I had a really bad headache that lasted two days, but I, again, I don't want to scare people off from getting the vaccine,
173000	179000	not everybody gets it that bad like like low temporary, hold on, I gotta say hi to Techmaster Loki.
179000	184000	Hello, hi, you didn't really have any vaccine issues at all right.
184000	190000	No, I didn't. Yeah, so some people do some people don't that's just the way it works out sometimes.
190000	202000	And even, even the two days that I went through that were not pleasant. It just, it was, it's not like being normal sick it was just suddenly done like a light switch, like I woke up Wednesday morning and I'm like, I feel fine.
202000	204000	And that was that.
204000	211000	But it's also it's much better than having coded, I assure you, from everybody I've talked to that had coded the side effects are better.
211000	213000	So there's that.
213000	221000	Yeah, and I'm, I went ahead and scheduled myself off on Wednesday because normally my workweek starts on Wednesday.
221000	236000	But I've been telling like for you know my, the people that I've been working with, like, I had one thing scheduled on Thursday and I'm like, if I'm not going to make it I'm going to sign in long enough to email you and say, I am sick, and that's it.
237000	238000	Yeah.
238000	243000	At least my office is right over, you know, my left yonder. Yeah.
243000	247000	And I will say, just a bit of personal news as well, Alan.
247000	262000	My husband is getting his first shot on the same day as Jamie second shot the 20th. So that is nice because that is kind of the key barrier to when do we get to do the whole show in person again, because that means all of us will be fully vaccinated at that point
262000	274000	and that is very very pleasant and then we can start actually having those talks, I will say I got to see my dad this weekend, and we hung out and we didn't use, you know, I know, I know it's supposed to be two weeks but I'm like once once good enough, and
274000	287000	he's fully vaxxed, so it was nice to just hang out and see my dad again. So, it was very nice. So we're getting closer guys and I hope those of you out there that will be eligible for your shots well pretty much everybody's eligible now.
287000	292000	It's just about getting the appointments so I hope y'all are able to get them still tiered actually.
292000	304000	Oh, are some states still tearing them. I thought everybody was open. Okay, well May 1 was the day everybody supposed to be open. I think there's only very few states left, I think Hawaii might be one of them that still tiered I remember hearing that somewhere,
304000	309000	but in general most states are open at this point but y'all y'all know the rules.
309000	317000	Looking at chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network.
317000	327000	Six Pacific nine Eastern right after Bobby Black Wolf I think he said that already, but I'll say it twice, because Bobby Black Wolf has our first comment tonight who says I slept through most of my side effects, but I took the next day off from work,
327000	340000	I got it on Thursday and took Friday off, and I was fine by Saturday, and there's many people sharing stories about second shots it sounds like they're coming up soon for a lot of people, and of course a lot of birthday wishes for dark soccer as well,
340000	350000	who you know it's a bummer that you're still having another birthday during coven lockdowns but I do feel like there's more options this time, if you want to do it, I don't know, I don't know, there are.
350000	366000	Yeah, and I'll be, I'll be perfectly honest, the thing that I'm looking forward to is just being able to be outside and not be afraid that due to my other condition.
366000	374000	I'm not gonna get that second end up hospitalized I had, I had pneumonia twice last last year. Yeah.
375000	381000	I also want to point out in chat Tiger Claw says unfortunately I have to work on the day of the second shot.
381000	394000	Check the rules and regulations us in your state now Tiger Claw I know you live in Florida so sorry, Florida is going to Florida, but in a lot of states like COVID leave to get the shots and stuff is actually mandatory for our employees
394000	403000	to work a certain number of hours so check that out in your state, where you're at but again, I do not think the outlook is good for Florida because Florida gonna Florida sorry guys.
403000	415000	My job started offering that up well before there was any national mandate. Well yeah and and of course yeah some some employers have done that well before and my mind was always very good about it as well but then we also found out it's going to be regulated
415000	426000	anyway in California so, you know, all right. Anyway, I haven't talked a lot to Loki I said hello, just to ask about the shot, and then I noticed in the background on Loki's screen tonight.
426000	438000	Is that the Roadrunner game that was on like Super Nintendo or the. There was like an attack. Okay, okay why why that game tonight, because this is my first Super Nintendo game.
438000	453000	Oh, I got this game instead of like Mario World I think I couldn't buy Mario World at the time. So I got this one, and it's sort of Sonic. Mm hmm. I don't know, but I played the heck out of it.
453000	459000	I, why not. I vaguely remember that game but you know there was also a Roadrunner.
459000	468000	It was an Atari arcade game and it ran on the same hardware it's like 720, and a lot of the big Atari games that age to try to get other games around on that hardware.
468000	479000	I don't think gauntlet, but they had a very distinct look like they all had the same font and the scores are on big numbers. The Indiana Jones game that was out around that time I think also ran on the hardware, but there was a Roadrunner game it was really
479000	493000	fun that was on that. Yeah, this is Roadrunners Death Valley rally so. Mm hmm. I don't know, it was okay. It was frustrating but I did end up beating it. Good job. Yeah, I see the arcade one that does look interesting.
493000	502000	Yeah, that was a lot of fun I don't remember the arcade near me that had it. If it was like the roller rink, or what was speaking of which I saw those photos on your Facebook.
502000	521000	You hit the roller rink, how was that was that fun. Yeah, it's, we've been doing it for, they've opened it up last week so we started going every Sunday. Now, this week is Saturday but do roller rink still have a pretty decent assortment of video games like they used to back in the day or is it all ticket spitters again.
521000	538000	No, they don't have ticket spitters at all it's, it's your usual like arcade stuff so they've got a terminators. I think it's Terminator salvation game that is broken, they have the Jurassic Park shooter game there.
538000	544000	They've got like a motorcycle racing game and Guitar Hero.
544000	550000	So, it's a mix that Guitar Hero arcade games pretty popular I see a lot of places.
550000	564000	A lot of the stuff isn't working there right now like I know that terminators been broken for at least the two weeks that we've gone broken arcade games in a independently run, it's, it's funny because it's got like you know it's like a bias screen error things so you know
564000	580000	because it's running a computer so yeah, it's just kind of funny, but yeah the Jurassic Park arcade that's like everywhere. Speaking of which, you know, I thought that there was that one company was bringing those games home or whatever, and I know Jurassic Park the arcade was one of them I'm kind of curious
580000	587000	whatever happened to that but hopefully hear about soon because that'd be pretty exciting. Hopefully.
587000	602000	Yeah, they've got, you know, the assortment, not, not as much like I haven't been to some of the other ranks around here but like there's other ranks that are nearby that have much older looking games so like late, you know, like 90s 80s stuff.
602000	608000	So obviously, you know, if I ever get over there since they still got that stuff. Alright.
608000	620000	Alright, well, we're going to get into the news and then maybe we'll talk about some more arcade games during our gaming week we'll see but I want to get into tonight's kickoff topic, this one's a little weird this week I got to admit, because we're going to talk
620000	631000	a little bit about a rumor that's already kind of been shot down but I want to talk about it a little bit and get your guys's thoughts on this, well of course when I say you guys I mean our chat and the live folks as well and hey, those of you listening on the podcast
631000	645000	feed you can always tweet us at OLR or email us at participate at orange launch radio.com because, of course, we want to know your thoughts as well. And this has to do with a rumor about the potential acquisition of Square Enix.
645000	659000	What happened is that there was a report out there it was a subscription news site, which I think was deferring to Bloomberg Japan I know Bloomberg was kind of being finger pointed as the original folks that started the rumor, and that basically was
659000	676000	that there's attempts out there for Square Enix to kind of boost their profile a little bit because Marvel Avengers did not perform to the level of expectations people had hoped with this, and that the company was basically being groomed for an acquisition.
676000	691000	And, you know, there's been a lot of acquisitions going on lately. Microsoft buying Bethesda, that was kind of one of the big ones, but of course we had EA had picked up a Codemaster, and actually, Microsoft to get ZeniMax and it's an important
692000	703000	which owns Bethesda in turn. And then Epic Games picked up Tonic Games Group which are the folks that are made Fall Guys. So there's been a lot of these things going on.
703000	719000	And of course Twitter went crazy right social media went crazy like oh my god Square Enix is for sale. And then in comes the Microsoft fanboys. I don't blame them in a way I mean I do blame them for being such suckers but I think there is a, you know, there's
719000	731000	there's always been that hope, Microsoft's gonna buy a Japanese company, and then we're, Japan's gonna have to take Xbox seriously again, and we all know Microsoft loves to buy buy companies up.
731000	744000	So, it was, it was almost like the rumor was kind of self writing itself there that Microsoft were the ones that were looking to get Square Enix although that really wasn't ever named, and I think some people out there were theorizing Sony could be buying
744000	760000	Square Enix as a response to Microsoft, getting ZeniMax slash Bethesda, but at the end of the day, we can talk about the coulda woulda shoulda is all we want. However, the end this doesn't always seem to happen which is what's interesting to me.
760000	774000	Usually, a lot of companies will respond to these sorts of things with, we don't comment on rumors and speculation and that whole thing right. That didn't happen here. And maybe that's because we've got stock price those sorts of things involved, because the stock
774000	791000	went up. Thanks to these rumors that they were going to get bought Square Enix came out and said, No, that is not the case. Square Enix denied that it's mulling a sale, or even that it has been approached by interested parties, saying quote, We do not consider selling off the
791000	808000	company or any part of its business, nor have we received any offer from any third party to acquire the company, or any parts of its business. So that got shot down pretty quick. And yeah, I'm looking at a press release dated April 16 2021, straight from Square
808000	837000	Enix Holdings, and they also kind of named Bloomberg by name, which is interesting. Let me actually I could read the whole press release here because it's, it's very short. It's titled today's media coverage, and it says, Bloomberg has reported today that there is interest from several buyers to acquire Square Enix. However, this report is not based off any announcement by Square Enix Holdings Limited. We do not consider selling off the company or any part of its business, nor have we received any offer from any third party to acquire the company or any part of his business that little segment that I do.
838000	848000	Just read a moment ago. So I think it's very interesting how Square kind of came in here and and put a very hard no on this. What are your thoughts?
848000	852000	Your words are interesting, but they are not based in fact, please go away.
852000	857000	Kind of, kind of. Loki, I see you grinning over there. What are your thoughts on all this?
857000	864000	You know, maybe they would have been more valuable as a company if they decided to, you know, port Final Fantasy 11 to mobile.
864000	868000	But I mean, I don't drive the decisions of that company.
868000	871000	Cheap shot, cheap shot.
871000	881000	Bobby Blackwolf says Bloomberg, hey, Company X, would you be interested in buying Square Enix? Company X, I mean, if they're for sale, sure. Bloomberg, Company X, seeking to buy Square Enix.
881000	891000	And maybe maybe it is a big commentary on some of these news outlets and how they do some of their reporting.
891000	896000	Fifth Dream is pointing out, isn't Bloomberg the one also fanning flames of Switch Pro rumors?
896000	902000	Well, those flames are everywhere. That's that's the Full House theme song.
902000	907000	Everywhere you look, everywhere there's a heart. That that is the Switch Pro rumors.
907000	914000	Go ahead. There's a thing that I have noticed with some of these companies that are.
914000	922000	This is what I'm trying to think of, like the business financial oriented, the ones that are usually for.
922000	927000	I would reckon an audience that's different than, say, all of us.
927000	932000	We care about financing. Right. But we're not watching the stock market or the big business stuff.
932000	940000	But I think that they're looking to try to gain that relevancy with a different demographic.
940000	948000	And you know what the news what it says is that that even bad publicity is publicity.
948000	955000	I think if they're touching on things that a different.
955000	966000	A demographic is interested in, then it's for them, it's going to generate interest from that new demographic, whether or not it's accurate.
966000	972000	You know, they can always go back and say, oh, correction posted, blah, blah, blah, in tiny print.
972000	983000	Yeah. But their name is there now with people who would not have otherwise looked at their journalistic media.
983000	991000	S.H.A. 100 Matt in chat over Twitch TV slash Vogue Network says, I don't blame Bloomberg too much since I'm sure they vetted it with sources that fed this info.
991000	998000	This was all nonsense in the end. It's stockholders, bankers feeding information to boost interest in the market, et cetera.
999000	1005000	Yeah. And Bobby kind of piggybacks on this a little bit as well, talking about that's why there's so much Tesla FUD out there.
1005000	1011000	People are shorting the stock. And so they want bad news to come out. So they make up bad news in the hope that the stock falls.
1011000	1015000	This is the other direction. The stockbrokers want the stock price to go up.
1015000	1022000	So they put out FUD to raise the stock price and they can profit. And I think we all know the punch line here.
1022000	1032000	The stock price did go up 14 percent. So whoever sent anonymously that source to Bloomberg, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, right?
1032000	1045000	They got what they wanted. Also, just to point out, it very clearly shows how rigged the stock market is and how the rise and fall of the stock market itself is not a true gauge on how well the economy is doing.
1045000	1051000	Well, and this is all echoed by the Game Stonk thing that, you know, was huge.
1051000	1052000	Which is still going on.
1052000	1054000	Yeah, it's still going on, really.
1054000	1055000	And now Doge.
1055000	1068000	Well, yeah. And now cryptocurrency is the other huge one, too, is that, you know, you're absolutely right about the whole wanting to spread the word about something because I will see it all over my timeline by crypto enthusiasts.
1068000	1078000	Whenever someone like Elon Musk or whoever it is will say something positive about Dogecoin, then it's like we need to amplify that as much as possible.
1078000	1082000	So more people buy Dogecoin. So the price goes to the moon.
1082000	1083000	And it does.
1083000	1085000	And it kind of did this week.
1085000	1091000	Loki, I hope you have been well, I know you were interested in that.
1091000	1100000	This is how it works. So I have something to tell you, I directly directly control what happens to Doge, but just in the opposite.
1100000	1107000	So like any time I buy, it goes down. Any time I sell, it goes up. So, yeah, I see.
1107000	1110000	So you so you unloaded last week.
1111000	1118000	Well, no, I sold it. I sold I sold at 30. And I'm waiting for I was hoping it would drop because it was going up and down.
1118000	1121000	So I was trying to get it when it went back down a little bit.
1121000	1129000	And now it's sitting at 32. So that's typically what happened was I was originally in it for and I was at 30 something.
1129000	1134000	But like I had sold like a while back, too, because it was just dropping all over the place.
1134000	1139000	And that's like I said, I was trying to buy low, sell high. But, you know, that's not what that's all.
1139000	1143000	So I put it like a buck 50 in Bitcoin cash.
1143000	1148000	And I now have two dollars and ninety five cents after two weeks.
1148000	1154000	Yeah, I put 50 bucks into Ethereum a few weeks ago, just as a one percent drop right now.
1154000	1160000	Well, right now it does. But I put 50 bucks in like when all this Game Stonk stuff was going on.
1160000	1167000	And it was up to at one point it peaked at 92 last week. And I checked I checked the stuff at some point.
1167000	1176000	And it was like in the 80s today. But I mean, in my head, that 50 bucks to me was my legalized gambling budget, gambling budget.
1176000	1181000	You know, like I haven't been to Reno to gamble in well over a year or to play.
1181000	1186000	You know, I'm a grandma who loves to sit there in front of slot machines, Konami branded slot machines.
1186000	1190000	And, you know, play them and try to win money.
1190000	1199000	And I've probably won more on this whole digital currency thing than I have on any of the Konami slot machines.
1199000	1209000	Well, the the thing I guess the reason why I put in Bitcoin cash is because it was I mean, it was like.
1209000	1216000	Looked like it had a modest rise and it was I could do it through PayPal because I have a little bit of cash left in PayPal.
1216000	1223000	So it's like, why not? Yeah, why not? And actually it's gone up three cents while I was watching it.
1223000	1228000	It'll change up and down, like just in the seconds that you're there. That's how volatile the cryptocurrency stuff is.
1228000	1235000	But anyway, this isn't this isn't a crypto podcast. There's plenty of them out there if you want to check technology.
1235000	1245000	But I think a lot of us are kind of like, you know, well, to kind of bring it back to the home point about, you know, these this is the manipulation of the stock market.
1245000	1248000	And this really only interests the people that are into the stock market.
1248000	1263000	This whole conversation on the side that we're having does kind of bring back to the point of I think a lot more people now in 2021 feel empowered right now that the stock market is they're fucking right to.
1263000	1277000	And, you know, especially after what happened with the whole GameStop stuff, I think I think if there's anything you can take away from that, it's that there's a lot of people who have spoken up and said we're sick of the stock market being controlled by.
1277000	1282000	We don't really understand it. It's and we the people are going to take it back and do what we want with it.
1282000	1292000	And that essentially is what the GameStop stuff boils down to to me was that, you know, you're not going to kill off these brands in my childhood because then it was it was GameStop.
1292000	1299000	It was AMC. It was Blockbuster at one point. Wasn't it Blockbuster too? And like all these like weird companies.
1299000	1304000	It was Blackberry, AMC, maybe Nokia for a little bit.
1304000	1305000	Yes.
1305000	1308000	Yeah, but GameStop took babbages from me.
1308000	1324000	But anyway, my point is, is that, you know, I think now it's interesting to see how now that there's more people that are interested in stock markets because it's so easy to do it through apps and stuff and that have had the time to play with this stuff during COVID.
1324000	1337000	How these sorts of news may be diluted or whatever by social media and people out there who do have a passing interest, maybe not in Square Enix directly, but in the stock market and so forth.
1337000	1339000	I think it's interesting.
1339000	1340000	Yeah. All right.
1340000	1348000	Well, it's the big thing that a lot of a lot of people, I would say gaming enthusiasts of a certain age, don't consider.
1348000	1364000	Yeah, true. You know, is that you're the content that you get is almost directly related to mostly related to how well that company is performing for the big names.
1364000	1371000	If the company is not performing well, they're not going to want to allocate budget to those titles.
1371000	1376000	They're going to want to try to save their money and build their current revenue.
1376000	1378000	So it's all related.
1378000	1382000	This is all going to come up again later, by the way. We'll get into that when we get into it.
1382000	1385000	It's always going to come up. It's like the Hydra.
1385000	1387000	Yeah, true.
1387000	1394000	Let me ask a stupid question, and I'm fully going to admit this is a stupid question and I'm just asking it for the sake of discussion.
1394000	1400000	And this is a stupid question that a lot of YouTubers are going to be getting into on their channel this week.
1400000	1402000	And that is the question.
1402000	1406000	What do you think? What do you think Square Enix should do? What would you like to see happen to Square Enix?
1406000	1409000	What do you want Square Enix to sell to Microsoft? Do you think that's a good idea?
1409000	1411000	What do you want to see happen Square Enix?
1411000	1418000	And I'm saying this is a stupid question because as much as this may surprise you, it doesn't really matter what you think.
1418000	1422000	But that's not going to stop a lot of people from answering it anyway.
1422000	1427000	So what the hell? Let's indulge. We don't have that much news to talk about tonight.
1427000	1429000	Let's indulge a stupid question.
1429000	1431000	Rob, opinions are like assholes.
1431000	1432000	That's right.
1432000	1433000	Everyone has one.
1433000	1440000	So give us the fart on Square Enix. What do you want to see happen?
1440000	1449000	I just want to see them keep performing well and to release, I'd actually really like more of the older Enix titles.
1449000	1456000	You know, I want to see a return of some of the games that were, I'd say, big in the aughts, you know?
1456000	1458000	Like, I mean, I'll throw out Busta Move.
1458000	1462000	Like if you weren't going to say it, I'm like busta busta busta busta.
1462000	1470000	Yeah. But I would also like to see them do more, I would say, just interactive things.
1470000	1480000	You know, I would even say have some sort of better relationship with their targeted demographic.
1480000	1485000	You know, like maybe AR events.
1485000	1488000	You know, that's just an example.
1488000	1499000	Do more, you know, I was really pleased they released almost every earlier Final Fantasy game on iOS, you know, for iPhone and iPad.
1499000	1510000	I would like for them to have more interactive polling with their demographic and not just in Japan, but in the US as well or in their other markets.
1510000	1522000	Because I think that they'll find that they'll get a lot of good ideas for direction from their main fan base.
1522000	1525000	Loki, what about you?
1525000	1529000	I don't care what they do. I don't know.
1529000	1535000	They can sell to whoever they want, as far as like what games I want them to make.
1535000	1538000	I'm more talk about racing.
1538000	1547000	I think we all appreciate Square Enix as an independent company who does things with Nintendo sometimes, who does things with Sony sometimes.
1547000	1552000	Doesn't really seem to do a lot with Microsoft very often, but maybe that's going to change in the future.
1552000	1557000	You know, I shouldn't say that. I just feel like Microsoft doesn't really get exclusive stuff out of Square Enix.
1557000	1559000	It's usually kind of like the catching up stuff.
1559000	1564000	But we do see Square Enix playing along with Game Pass, and that's kind of exciting. So there is that.
1564000	1575000	So I like Square Enix kind of functioning as somebody a little bit more independent in this world and somebody that's very rooted in Japan and that sort of culture and getting the games out of Japan.
1575000	1579000	I realize I'm saying all that and you're probably typing this in chat right now.
1579000	1589000	There is a whole and what about the stuff that's rooted in Eidos and the stuff like Avengers and Tomb Raider and all that stuff is Square Enix stuff too.
1589000	1595000	Sure. And you know, Avengers, unfortunately, probably did not live up to the hype that was behind it.
1595000	1603000	I still feel like that game maybe can still be turned around, especially I talk about Game Pass.
1603000	1609000	I've said this before. I would think Avengers is going to be on Game Pass by the end of the year.
1609000	1614000	As I understand it, it's already a PlayStation Now title.
1614000	1626000	So for Sony's thing over there, and I feel like they might be able to make some money off of, you know, DLC and expansions and so forth by maybe they may have to give away the base game a little bit, but they might make money back.
1626000	1636000	But I think Square has a lot of good news going for it. Like, you know, Final Fantasy 14 continues to be a very, very good money maker and a very good news all around.
1637000	1648000	I know I'm freaking excited about Final Fantasy 16 at some point. I do wish, and this may surprise some of you that I'm going to say this, I do wish they would show a little love to Chrono Trigger already.
1648000	1658000	It's kind of ridiculous that we've had Secret of Mana, Trials of Mana, although that was very exciting to get second distance to three finally after all these years.
1658000	1665000	And now the Saga games, we didn't need to go back to the Saga games. Some are going to strongly disagree with me. I don't care.
1665000	1667000	Technically two games in the Chrono Trigger series.
1667000	1683000	So it is time to dust those off and give them some of the same lovin' they're given. I saw a great meme that was a SpongeBob meme where Squidward is like trapped inside and he's looking out the window where SpongeBob and Patrick are running down going,
1684000	1692000	And the SpongeBob and Patrick are labeled Mana Series, Saga Series, and the Squidward that's like looking at them says Chrono Trigger.
1692000	1703000	So it's like, you know, Square's not showing Chrono a little bit of love and that's kind of sad. Oh God, and who asked for Legend of Mana? Who did that?
1703000	1708000	Like, why are we getting these games redone and not Chrono Trigger?
1708000	1711000	The same people that are asking for all these Pikmin sequels.
1711000	1715000	I guess, or a Pikmin Niantic game, I guess.
1715000	1717000	Oh God.
1717000	1723000	ActDeft in chat says, I did, shut up. And to you I say, no you.
1723000	1731000	Enjoy, well you won ActDeft, you get your game, the rest of us are still waiting for Chrono Trigger. Alright.
1731000	1740000	Alright, now we're just delving it. Now we've gone past Stupid Question into Fanboy Wars.
1740000	1746000	So it is definitely time to change the topic and get into our gaming weeks. Let's talk about the types of games we've been playing this week.
1746000	1748000	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1748000	1757000	It was pretty good. I've been kind of sucking up on Animal Crossing actually so I'm back into playing.
1757000	1768000	And I have been doing a lot of studying for Dead by Daylight because I realized that as much as I love playing Legion one cannot live by Legion alone.
1768000	1772000	Even though there's four of them, but I only play Julie.
1772000	1776000	So I've been watching survivors.
1776000	1789000	I gotta say, sorry, it's just so interesting that I am watching random Twitch channels and I'll see you in chat all of a sudden and I'm like, oh shit, Jamie fell down this hole hard too.
1789000	1791000	It's not just me.
1791000	1794000	The lore is so interesting to me.
1794000	1795000	Yeah, no it is.
1795000	1816000	I mean, well, you know what, how I get with with a game if I'm going to be invested in it, then I'm going to be really invested in it. I am going to just watch so much and try to learn so much and read the character bios and everything that that's just how I function.
1816000	1824000	You know, I don't know if I'm going to love something I will love it completely.
1825000	1826000	Does that make sense?
1826000	1828000	Yes, of course it does.
1828000	1833000	So at any rate, I've been watching a lot of survivors streaming.
1833000	1837000	And I've made some some decent friends on the way I ran into.
1837000	1842000	I have funny enough I ran into another OLR fan.
1842000	1846000	By, it's Flea, F-L-E-E.
1846000	1848000	Oh yeah, I see Flea around sometimes yeah.
1848000	1867000	Yeah, and I've run into him a few times and actually we met up in, was it in, I'm trying to remember his chat it was in, I know that I followed him to LeppinNA's channel.
1867000	1870000	So A, Dead by DLI streamers chat of some sort.
1870000	1871000	Yeah.
1871000	1880000	So at any rate, I've been watching a lot of survivors because I want to know what the survivors tactics are so I can know what to look out for because I'm only going to ever play a killer.
1880000	1882000	You have to keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
1882000	1885000	Exactly, I'm doing surveillance.
1885000	1894000	But I have to go back and play certain characters to get certain perks, even though I'm going to hate it.
1894000	1896000	I have to play Bubba.
1896000	1903000	I know for the ever elusive barbecue and chili, or you just you take a gamble and you wait for it to show up in the store.
1903000	1905000	Which it does every what five years.
1905000	1914000	Oh, yeah, people tell me it like the last time they had seen it in, in the archive was like two years ago. Oh geez.
1914000	1917000	So yeah, I have to play Bubba.
1917000	1920000	After Bubba I have to play Vomie Mommy.
1920000	1922000	The plague.
1922000	1934000	Um, because I need her was infectious fear or something is your, I gotta watch how much we delve into the dead by daylight chat tonight, especially after last week but let me ask this real quick.
1934000	1945000	Because I think you know the OLR people that have been kind of listening to this whole saga as we're falling further and further down this rabbit hole. Remember that you were like the first to like push me to try to play as Freddy, and all this.
1945000	1955000	So my kind of question is as your favorite killer changed is your favorite killer legion at this point or now that you've jumped into the lore is your favorite killer kind of somebody else or is it still Freddie.
1955000	1958000	Okay, character story wise.
1958000	1963000	My favorite is Rin, the spirit. Okay, sure.
1963000	1971000	Because I feel so sorry for her. Okay, as a character, just really sad story.
1971000	1979000	Um, I think for fun though I'm really like I want to eventually main nurse.
1979000	1995000	And I know she's hard. But I also really like Legion because I kind of just think that their character concept is interesting. And, and you know how my play style is is I like to kind of, if I'm gonna, if I'm gonna melee I'm gonna fucking melee.
1995000	2004000	So I like using feral frenzy, you know, and I've actually even in one game I kind of learned how to control feral frenzy a little bit better.
2004000	2020000	But I, I like playing as Julie, I mean, I like the character skin she looks great. I like the masks and they're just a cool series of characters. But my goal with going to Legion was to learn how to deal with the motion sickness for speeding up so fast,
2020000	2023000	so that I can move on to playing nurse.
2023000	2036000	Okay. All right. All I can say, sorry, before we kind of move away from the dead by daylight chat I was saying all I can say is that I like, I'm more excited to do a twitch con than I have been in a very long time, because I feel like because of this game
2036000	2048000	I am actively more participating with more streamers and that than I used to before. And I didn't watch twitch I watched plenty of it, but I feel like I'm more actively involved with a lot of that than I was before.
2048000	2063000	So there is that. So, I think it's excellent. I mean, and it really, I'm noticing a lot of female streamers. Yes, queer streamers, and a lot of queer streamers, and sometimes both.
2063000	2078000	Yep. And the thing that I think is also fun is that sometimes I'm running into streamers like, especially the play survivors who have other people on their, their audio with them.
2078000	2082000	So you can hear how they plan.
2082000	2090000	Yeah, and for me that just expands the, the whole aspect of it to me I think it's great.
2090000	2100000	It was fascinating the first time I did a Freddie game and one of the survivors had TTV in their name so I was able to go and watch after because I'm not going to do it during the match that's not cool.
2100000	2114000	But after I went and watched from her perspective, and it was fascinating. So, oh yeah, I kind of want to do that when. Well, it's almost like when our band director used to record our performances and then play them for us the next day at school.
2114000	2128000	Yeah, I would love to watch my own performance from that third person view. I want to quickly I don't usually do these during the show I usually acknowledge all of these things after the show but it's hard for me not to say the anonymous
2128000	2133000	gift or just gifted 10 subs in our chat and that's not cheap to do.
2133000	2145000	So I just yeah I really want to express my appreciation to whoever you are out there. You did it anonymously for a reason so I probably should have stopped the show to acknowledge that, but it still is just one of those things where I'm I'm always blown
2145000	2160000	away. Even if it's 10 bits, or it's you know 28 months straight or whatever it is worth the subs. I am always really blown away by the generosity and so forth of the listeners we have this program, and fog network in general so thank you thank you thank you to all of you
2160000	2168000	and I will I will read all of that after the show as I usually do. Anyway, dark soccer anything else besides Dead by Daylight?
2168000	2177000	Well just my other point is that I'm going to be streaming quite a bit more often myself I've been getting my stream put together I sent you music for my stream.
2177000	2181000	I totally thought that was music for this stream. I got excited.
2181000	2197000	Rob. What? I will graciously also donate it to Orange Island Radio. Oh, I was gonna say just maybe take it as a hint that you need to write more music because there's a lot of places to use it. For the record, I did an expanded version of it.
2197000	2208000	Oh, okay good. For the roughly three minutes, and it will, it can loop just fine. So you didn't get the, when I texted you saying this is great, can it be three minutes, you didn't know where I was going.
2208000	2214000	I thought you were saying you prefer that three minutes for your stream.
2214000	2218000	And I was like well I only need a couple of minutes.
2218000	2228000	So funny. No, I do. I have absolutely no problem I'm pretty proud of it. It's great. That's why that's why I just assumed it was for this.
2229000	2240000	I was using my city pop music that I made that I mean, I wouldn't mind playing it, you know, at the end of an episode sometime, but I, it was too long.
2240000	2252000	I mean, I wanted something that was a little bit more loopy sounding and not necessarily a full song like my city pop song that I did. Jamie you are the musician and you have full creative control if you want to write a song and use it on vogue, and your personal
2252000	2256000	stream quite frankly you have that right, so go off sis.
2256000	2263000	But the whole point was that I wanted something that sounded a little bit more loop and less full song. So, yeah, I gotcha.
2263000	2272000	All right, well, y'all will hear it next week. Maybe, if I can get the video updated because there's changes I want to make to that too but anyway, moving on.
2272000	2275000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2275000	2290000	I played Minecraft, more on that server that I've been on so that collusion MC thing so been filming stuff just building some basic farms tearing down those same farms again after I get tired of the not working quite right.
2290000	2297000	Had a pretty exciting night, a few nights ago some now trying to put together my first episode, and edit that down.
2297000	2315000	But, which is being stupid well OBS started being stupid at first and didn't record locally my stream day did last Saturday. So I don't know why that is, because it went out in the Twitch is fine so I downloaded off Twitch but it's a variable bit rate or variable
2315000	2330000	frame rate or whatever. And so premieres like I don't know what to do with this. So, now I had to export from Twitch to YouTube, and then I'm going to rip it from YouTube, to put in from here it's, it's a pain in the butt.
2330000	2333000	I've been fighting with this for like hours today.
2333000	2347000	Do you have access to Adobe Media Encoder as part of Creative Cloud, because you can fix it there. I, I do but it's not it's just because it's it's variable frame rate, there's another app I had to fix it as well and it ran, it was processing for an hour
2347000	2358000	to happen it failed at the last second, send it, send it to me and I'll use compressor to fix it. Now I'll just download it. I've already uploaded it to YouTube, I'm just going to download it with I have a 4k video downloader, you know work just fine.
2358000	2370000	It's just it's, it's just annoying. So I was recording voiceovers and stuff for that today. I've been working on building like an anime logo or whatever for YouTube, I have something cheap. And then that's it.
2370000	2376000	So, but yeah, a lot, lots of exciting stuff.
2376000	2386000	Alright, sounds good. My Gaming Week, a lot of the same stuff I also play Dead by Daylight, which we've talked enough about. I've also been playing.
2386000	2395000	I played Geometry Wars 2 isn't that random but I just went into my Xbox list and I was like what do I want to play and I was like I'm gonna play that. And I did and it was fun.
2395000	2407000	I love that it looks it. It's so different looking now than it was when I was on 360 because now you know there's that little like HDR in it and it just looks even better on my TV it's it's wonderful.
2407000	2420000	I also played some more No Man's Sky, big surprise I'm sure but there was actually a bug that was stopping me from playing that game for about a week, because I had a quest and I could not finish the quest because it was bugged.
2420000	2433000	Thankfully they did a build that they just pushed on like Thursday or Friday that fixed said bug. So I was able to progress again so that was very nice I'm still working on the third part of the expedition, which is a very grindy part.
2433000	2447000	I just finished my 15th fleet mission and now I need to do like two more space anomalies and like, I think three or four more raid the alien sculptures and get the stuff there.
2447000	2458000	The only bummer is that not every time you get a planetary chart does it send you to the thing you need. So it's just a lot of grinding but I'm still having a good time with it, I wouldn't play it if it wasn't fun.
2458000	2461000	So there is that.
2461000	2474000	Let's see. And other things I played this week Oh Final Fantasy 14 and now Rob talks about that every week so I'm sure that's not a surprise but there was a brand new content patch that hit on Tuesdays that's important.
2474000	2490000	The 5.5 content patch hit which expanded the main story a little bit. There's a brand new dungeon there's a new raid. So here's the interesting thing. There are three raids right now in Final Fantasy shadow bringers that are based off of Nier, automata.
2490000	2509000	I had done the first one the copied factory back in five one which, if nothing else you guys listen to the soundtrack. Oh my god, because I mean, near has a great soundtrack to begin with, but like the boss fight in the copied factory mixes a near song with
2509000	2522000	Final Fantasy song, and it like it's so good. It's so good. And the nice thing is the end. So I actually did the second part the puppets bunker I think it's called, I was a little behind on that one I hadn't done it yet.
2522000	2532000	I finally did it this last week, and I did the brand brand new one this week as well. I got to see all that for the first time and I completely already forgot what the new ones called, but I did that as well.
2532000	2548000	Every end boss has a near song mixed with a Final Fantasy song. I think the first one is the best, but they're all pretty good. And the last boss of the last raid is pretty great. She's like a train boss. So is Misty out there trains.
2548000	2558000	Because like there's a part where there's like rails that go through the arena, and you got to find the ones with the red light, and you hear little ding ding ding and then the trains go zooming by, and if you're on a track.
2558000	2569000	Like a Doom train? Yeah, well not really because it's near so it's a little bit different. But if you're on the green light ones and you get flacked by a train and fall out the platform so that's not very fun.
2569000	2582000	And then it does some other really cool stuff to where like a building will form underneath the platform, and then it'll go ding ding ding and the building will go whoosh, and like it'll fly up through the platform and if you're standing where the building goes you go flying too.
2582000	2595000	So it's kind of interesting. It's a very cool raid of some cool mechanics. I could not explain there's that third boss in there for those that are playing the game. I still don't know what the hell was happening in that fight that was crazy, but I had a good time.
2595000	2609000	It was good to be able to run that with friends. Both those later raids. So I've done all the Nier raids in Final Fantasy and I will say, I will admit, because I swear to God we get an email on this once a month.
2609000	2619000	Rob, have you finished Nier Automata yet? Nothing has made me want to play Nier Automata more than doing those raids this past week where I was like, God this game is so good.
2619000	2630000	And the music is so good. I really need to go finish that up. So there you go. That's my gaming week. A little more Final Fantasy and so forth.
2630000	2642000	We will get into the news. Let me quickly mention a little programming note. So I talked about this a little bit last week, the bonus stream for Shane's definitive Pokemon ranking.
2642000	2656000	I had said maybe we'll do it last Thursday. Well, we didn't do it because I, as I mentioned at the top of the show, I was really sick from those sites. So like I basically lost two days of my week and I needed Wednesday and Thursday to catch up on stuff myself.
2656000	2665000	So Shane and I are going to do that stream this Thursday. So on the 22nd, we're going to do the Shane's definitive Pokemon ranking stream.
2665000	2678000	So that'll be Thursday night, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern. So same time as OLR. And we'll be going over Shane's top Pokemon. We are not going to be able to rank all 850 because I don't have all fucking night.
2678000	2686000	But we will at least get into around, we're thinking maybe the top 50. We'll talk about a little bit there. So we'll get into that. It's enough to try. It is.
2686000	2696000	And I was hoping maybe Shane might do his top 50 and maybe like his bottom 10. I do want to hear the ones he really doesn't like as well. So there we go.
2696000	2710000	Bobby in chat says, Shane can go all night. Don't hold him back. That is true. But Alan and I have to share streaming on Thursdays a little bit because Thursday is his all killer, no filler night. So I have to share with him a little bit there.
2710000	2718000	All right. So we'll have you guys look forward to that on Thursday. All right. Now we can get into some news. Loki, why don't you start us off?
2718000	2730000	Yeah, so the PlayStation 5 has gotten some updates regarding the different improvements, including like some console storage or USB storage, because I know that was missing for a while.
2730000	2741000	So it was really hard to expand your storage, especially since I don't know how many of the SSDs out there of any are fully compatible with the PlayStation 5 right now.
2742000	2751000	And then, of course, you're not going to be able to directly download to them, but you can move the games on to them once they are downloaded to your SSD.
2751000	2761000	And then some other stuff. They have cross generational share play, which is pretty cool. So you'll be able to play with PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 players together.
2761000	2774000	And then also there's going to be the ability to mute people in voice within the groups as well as organize your library better and stuff like that and some PlayStation app improvements.
2774000	2786000	And then the other thing I saw, too, was some HDMI link that they had where you can actually power on your console and TV together if you have a TV that supports that.
2786000	2791000	So neat stuff. I'm glad they have the storage, though. That's pretty nice.
2791000	2801000	Yeah, I think a lot of people were looking forward to that. And I don't own a PlayStation 5 yet, but I still appreciate these releases because the system is going to be that much better by the time I finally get my hands on one.
2801000	2808000	So, yeah, the only other the other caveat to you about the storage is because it's not the SSD, you can actually play games off of that.
2808000	2815000	So you can basically just download and archive them there, but you actually want to play them. You have to move them to your local storage.
2815000	2824000	So it's OK. It's just, you know, any better if we had those SSDs.
2824000	2832000	Yeah, it's well, it's also very nice for bandwidth purposes. I think that's the best thing about it.
2832000	2843000	Yeah, because, like, honestly, I'm looking at a month this month where I might finally go over the bandwidth cap and I don't know what the hell I did to do it, but we are way high on the bandwidth right now.
2843000	2844000	Oh, that's streaming.
2844000	2850000	I don't. It might be, but actually I looked and the Xbox is using a crap ton of bandwidth.
2850000	2861000	I don't know if that was just I think it's I think I turned off automatic updates again because I think it's I think some some fucking games are doing like 40 gig patches and I don't need them.
2861000	2864000	So I feel I shut that off again.
2864000	2874000	I haven't checked, but I'm curious to see how much steam is using to keep probably keeps downloading the updates for cyberpunk, which are like 50 gigabytes.
2874000	2883000	Interesting. Yeah. So I and a word to those of you that might have metered Internet as well, like check that stuff because it's not it's not great.
2883000	2889000	So it's a big reason why I actually tell steam not to launch a startup.
2889000	2895000	Yeah. And turned all that crap off so that it's not even running in the background.
2895000	2901000	It sucks that I can't do that, but it is what it is because there's no competitor to the service I have out here.
2901000	2906000	So it's a bummer anyway. But you can turn off steam.
2906000	2912000	No, no, no. I mean, like the bandwidth issues. Yeah. So but yeah, no, I do turn off steam.
2912000	2915000	I don't have steam launch when the system launches for a very similar reason.
2915000	2919000	I don't need it updating everything for games that are in my backlog that I barely touch.
2919000	2923000	You know what I mean? That is annoying. Yeah, it is. All right.
2923000	2928000	Let's talk about another PlayStation issue. This one is not as great news.
2928000	2936000	This information that's coming out, it has to do with something called CMOS and what it's doing to older PlayStations,
2936000	2940000	as well as confirmed PlayStation five, apparently this past week.
2940000	2944000	So what is going on here? There's something called the CMOS battery.
2944000	2948000	You have one of these inside every PlayStation three and PlayStation four.
2948000	2953000	These are used to keep track of the time that is on the system, even if the system is unplugged.
2953000	2963000	That's why it's a battery. OK, so any time this battery is bad, then basically the system goes,
2963000	2968000	oh, you need to check the time on the server because it may be out of sync with reality.
2968000	2975000	OK, on PlayStation three, this always happens when you go into a game on PlayStation Store.
2975000	2980000	And you might remember when you I don't know how many of you played PlayStation three games recently,
2980000	2986000	but you could install games and they would have a countdown clock on them until the game is basically unlocked.
2986000	2989000	So that's part of the reason why this timing was important.
2989000	2998000	This also exists on the PlayStation four because it does a check when you install a game from a disk and so forth to just confirm the consistency.
2998000	3005000	And I believe trophy data is an issue on the PlayStation four as well, because if it didn't do that,
3005000	3010000	then you would be able to kind of time skip and exploit certain trophies that way.
3010000	3019000	So most people have no idea that this could be a thing later on because these batteries have an average life of about 10 to 20 years.
3019000	3023000	So especially in a PlayStation four, nobody's really starting to run out yet.
3023000	3028000	Some folks may start to notice it on the PlayStation three as well,
3028000	3037000	but it's not like it's that easy just to replace the battery and resync PSN, especially if they're going to shut down PSN on the PlayStation three.
3037000	3042000	In fact, if you think about it and go years and years into the future, there's not going to be time servers anymore.
3042000	3048000	So eventually these systems will try to run checks on games. It's not going to be able to do them.
3048000	3055000	It's not going to play games. And this is freaking a lot of people out, potentially prematurely.
3055000	3068000	But it's freaking people out because they're worried about game preservation and the discs that they buy suddenly having a system that will no longer be able to run those discs.
3068000	3074000	And you have some people that are like, well, what if I want to give this console to my kids someday and let them play the games?
3074000	3081000	Because this battery issue, I'm not going to be able to do it. By the way, this issue also exists in PlayStation five.
3081000	3090000	They actually had a volunteer basically sacrifice a PS five to be looked at inside and see, is this an issue in the PlayStation five as well?
3090000	3097000	And it turns out the answer is yes. And that was all discovered by a Twitter account called Does It Play?
3097000	3105000	So obviously, this shouldn't be an issue for any PlayStation five owner right now, because, again, those batteries will last a long time.
3105000	3113000	But it certainly has a lot of people going, but what if? And a lot of people are instantly jumping to the worst case scenario.
3113000	3121000	Like they do. As people tend to do. Again, back to the good old line of it doesn't matter what the facts are.
3121000	3130000	It only matters what perception is. And now the perception is out there that your PlayStation is a ticking time bomb.
3130000	3136000	And what's going to explode? Your ability to play any game that you've ever owned for the system.
3136000	3143000	That is the perception that's out there. The headlines and the hundred, I'm sorry, two hundred and eighty character tweets are putting out there right now.
3143000	3153000	And so this is more and more creating a problem from Sony for Sony, who already does not have the best reputation when it comes to the preservation of digital games.
3153000	3162000	On to, of course, the PlayStation three issue we were talking about last week and the Vita and the PSP with the stores are going to be closing soon.
3162000	3167000	By the way, just an aside, because I thought this was interesting because it came up on our Discord.
3167000	3171000	So we like to check up on our Discord every now and then over at VOG Network dot com.
3171000	3174000	That's VOG Network dot com slash Discord.
3174000	3192000	And there was some very interesting insight there from one of our listeners, 13X Forever, who is a regular listener of the show, I believe, on the podcast feed and was kind of giving some feedback there about, oh, did you hear the one about how people suddenly couldn't download DLC anymore?
3192000	3197000	And all of that broke. And oh, my gosh. Well, guess what? It was fixed.
3197000	3202000	Somebody was able to and he kind of laid out all the technical. How did it happen?
3202000	3205000	And he's like, I bet nobody's going to report on the fact that it was fixed.
3205000	3212000	Well, here we are. You're welcome. But I get I but I think I don't think he cares about us specifically.
3212000	3217000	I think it's more of the greater gaming media because, yes, the doom and gloom about PlayStation.
3217000	3223000	Oh, yeah. Oh, here we go already. You can't fit. You can't patch your games. We're all fucked.
3223000	3229000	We're not going to be able to play these games anymore. I think he has a point. How many of those same outlets are going to run the headline?
3229000	3231000	Never mind.
3231000	3236000	Again. Bad news. Bad publicity is good publicity.
3236000	3243000	I suppose so, isn't it? Anyway, Zen Monkey 11 in chat says people just noticed now.
3243000	3246000	I've been saying that since the PlayStation three Zen Monkey.
3246000	3252000	I think this is resurfacing because of the PlayStation Network news from a couple of weeks ago.
3252000	3257000	And the fact that it is still going now confirmed this week on PlayStation five.
3257000	3262000	That's kind of the headline of why it's rearing its head again this week.
3262000	3268000	Has anyone ever actually had a problem with a cartridge and the battery failing on a cartridge from back in the day?
3268000	3273000	You remember how those Zelda cartridges came with a warning? The battery won't last forever.
3273000	3281000	When did that finally happen? Dark soccer. I don't I I don't play games in any more so.
3281000	3288000	I don't remember. It was like what like I want to say it was like some other game.
3288000	3296000	It wasn't one of our it might have been one of our Zelda's. But I mean, you just go buy any battery and re solder solder it, you know.
3296000	3300000	Yeah. And I know our Saturn batteries have worn out like a bunch of times.
3300000	3303000	And I suppose that's what people are saying.
3303000	3308000	You're going to have to do these PlayStation three and PlayStation four issues someday is, you know, basically fix the battery.
3308000	3317000	But I would think, couldn't Sony just put out a firmware patch that changes this, especially especially for PlayStation three?
3317000	3321000	We'd like to think that. Not gonna because.
3321000	3327000	Do you think that you think this is going to put pressure on them to do so, especially in light of the fact that they are closing the store?
3327000	3333000	Do you think there's going to be pressure? Well, if you're not going to sell the software anymore, then get rid of this fucking check.
3333000	3339000	That's ruining our disk based games. Do you think they're going to have that pressure?
3339000	3347000	No, I think the pressure is there, but I'm not sure what will what will actually hold them accountable.
3347000	3351000	What are people going to do? Not buy a PS five?
3351000	3359000	Well, some of us don't have one. Yeah. Well, yeah, it's like most of us are not buying a PS five, but it's not for lack of trying.
3359000	3365000	You know what I mean? So it's just it's it's it's just interesting because I do think there's probably going to be that pressure on social media.
3365000	3375000	And I absolutely believe Sony will be asked about it when they start doing some of these summer, you know, appearances for whatever they're going to promote this summer and so forth.
3375000	3381000	But what is actually going to hold them accountable? There's money there.
3381000	3388000	Well, there's there's actually talk this whole thing. Some people are saying we need laws on the book.
3388000	3397000	We need laws that essentially a computing device must play the software that was made for it.
3397000	3410000	Even after basically after the online is not supported or forever, basically, that computing thing must play the software made for said computing thing and that perhaps this might be something that's legislated.
3410000	3420000	Nobody wants that. Now, I know I'm jumping I'm jumping to a little far out there, but that that could be the thing that holds Sony accountable.
3420000	3429000	There's going to be, though, there has to be some special wording about that to avoid pirate pirated and non.
3429000	3433000	Approved games. I don't know another word to say for it, you know.
3433000	3439000	Like what's to say that someone like like like the tango Nintendo thing, you know.
3439000	3446000	Yeah. Or, well, this burn of this game is intended to be played on it. We only use that.
3446000	3453000	Well, yeah, yeah, you're right. There would have to be something written in there that it would be, you know, the pirated stuff doesn't count, of course.
3453000	3456000	We know that. Yeah. So, yeah.
3456000	3459000	Or I would say unlicensed unlicensed material. Yeah.
3459000	3461000	Unlicensed software. Sure.
3461000	3465000	S.H.O. 100 Matt in chat says the pressure is there, but the folks who should care don't.
3465000	3470000	And that goes to what Rob was saying last week. They need a counterpunch to Phil Spencer.
3470000	3472000	They as in Sony.
3472000	3482000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says I found my Sega Genesis X band modem and the battery in there obviously died because it lost all my settings and it doesn't keep settings and I make new ones.
3482000	3486000	Also continues with another comment. The right to repair is a big deal.
3486000	3491000	So people won't be beholden to the Apple Genius bar to fix their iPhone or MacBook.
3491000	3494000	They're not. All they have to do is call.
3494000	3497000	So but but but.
3497000	3509000	I but not just with the sense of Apple or whatever computing device, but the right to ask somebody to change the battery in my Sony device should be a thing I'm able to do, which I believe it is.
3509000	3516000	I don't think that I think it used to be like if you don't go to a Sony approved thing, you're in violation of your warranty.
3516000	3522000	Not that warranties matter at the point that you're talking about changing the battery in your frickin console.
3522000	3524000	But I get it. I get it.
3524000	3532000	If it were me, I would have done it to where you can change the battery out like you can with the Saturn.
3532000	3535000	I mean, it's really easy to change the battery on the Saturn.
3535000	3540000	You know, you should have a little slot that you can change out your your battery.
3540000	3543000	Yeah, that makes sense.
3543000	3545000	Absolutely. Whosever cat that is.
3545000	3556000	All right. That is that is Smush screaming because it's dinnertime and other daddy has just shown up in the kitchen who and dared to pick up the food bowl.
3556000	3558000	So now Smush knows what's about to happen. So he's losing.
3558000	3560000	It's also my cat in the background.
3560000	3562000	Oh, we have dueling cats. Lovely.
3562000	3564000	And Midna is sitting out there.
3564000	3567000	Midna is sitting quietly in the other chair in the room.
3567000	3569000	Well, just sitting there like a little lady.
3569000	3572000	We can't all have a well-behaved cat.
3572000	3574000	Well behaved.
3574000	3576000	All right. Let's move on.
3576000	3579000	Dark soccer. What else can't we have?
3579000	3582000	We can't have Lord of the Rings games.
3582000	3584000	Well, at least from Amazon.
3584000	3590000	So Amazon's video game division canceled an online role playing game.
3590000	3594000	It was based on Lord of the Rings. It was announced in twenty nineteen.
3594000	3601000	It had been in developed by a dad that the words it had been in development by Amazon Game Studios,
3601000	3613000	along with a China based Leo Technologies holding that actually it was acquired by Tencent.
3613000	3616000	Also another Chinese company.
3616000	3625000	So this led to contract negotiations and a huge ass dispute between Amazon and Tencent that basically had the game canceled.
3625000	3634000	So they've been unable to secure their their terms so that they can proceed with developing the game.
3634000	3639000	They said that the development team is going to be moved on to other projects.
3639000	3643000	And this is just another thing, because I haven't really released anything successful.
3643000	3649000	You know, Amazon's track record on game publication leaves a lot to be desired.
3649000	3653000	Yes. And we're now five years down the line.
3653000	3656000	They've canceled Breakaway and Crucible. They canceled.
3656000	3662000	Well, they've delayed New World. We're not going to get anything out of them.
3662000	3667000	And I think all that money that was going to go to the Lord of the Rings game is now going to go to that TV show.
3667000	3675000	I'm sure you saw that headline about how one season of the Lord of the Rings TV show is something like it's it's damn near half a billion dollars.
3675000	3679000	Damn close, like 460 million or something like that.
3679000	3683000	Yeah, it's a lot of that's a lot of fucking money.
3683000	3690000	I'm pretty sure that New World is going to be so indefinitely delayed that by the by the time if it did come out, no one's going to care.
3690000	3692000	It'll be slightly used world at that point.
3692000	3697000	Or it will it will need like a major graphical overhaul before they could release it.
3697000	3704000	Yeah, that's that's sadly true, is that if a game's in development too long, then oops.
3704000	3708000	Now we missed the bar for the graphical fidelity we were going for the first time.
3708000	3716000	Exactly. All right. Let's talk about that big expo that happens every June where we're going to find out what games will be coming out.
3716000	3720000	Hopefully, actually, some things that get announced to E3 do end up getting canceled.
3720000	3726000	I'm sorry, Loki, this is actually your piece. I'm still stepping on top of you here. Loki, tell us about this.
3726000	3734000	All right. So E3 slots of different announcements as far as what we can expect.
3734000	3739000	It's not necessarily E3, some of the most of the stuff that they've announced is just stuff we had last year.
3739000	3744000	So we have the Wholesome Direct, which is coming in May, Summer Games Fest, June.
3744000	3750000	And of course, E3 is going to be between June 12th through the 15th.
3750000	3755000	So far, they've got Ubisoft Forward coming June 12th at 3 p.m. Eastern.
3755000	3762000	And then, of course, the ever exciting PC Gaming Show plus Future Games Show that's on June 13th.
3762000	3771000	And then we have PAX Online July 15th through the 18th with Game Developers Conference following that in July 19th through the 23rd.
3771000	3776000	And then at some point, Gamescom opening night live on August 24th.
3779000	3784000	So that's what your summer of game announcements is looking like so far.
3784000	3788000	Yeah, not a lot of details with who's actually presenting each thing.
3788000	3796000	But I'm hoping that we'll get some more announcements, especially Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, I guess Activision.
3796000	3802000	You know, there's other companies out there, obviously, that have things that they haven't announced yet when they're going to have their press conferences.
3802000	3805000	Microsoft especially, they always do something around that time.
3805000	3808000	So we need to see when those announcements are going to be.
3808000	3811000	But it's still way early. I mean, we're in April still. It's two months away at least.
3811000	3815000	I was going to say, under two months at this point. We're in April 18th.
3815000	3817000	Yeah, true. Yeah, it's also the end of the month.
3817000	3818000	Less than 60 days, y'all.
3818000	3828000	So, yeah, I actually say we should be hearing a little more specifics about who's going to kind of present what when pretty soon, I would think.
3828000	3836000	And I understand that we're not going to have a thing in person, but I'm kind of surprised they aren't trying to do something kind of smaller in person, even if not.
3836000	3843000	I don't know. But I guess I guess, you know, we don't want to get too ahead of ourselves when it comes to COVID and declaring victory on that too early.
3843000	3852000	So I'm just a little surprised they're not trying to do something small, especially for the people that really, really are in the industry who kind of need to do it.
3852000	3855000	Because they are doing conventions in some places.
3855000	3860000	It's just, you know, looks looks a little different than what you might think and probably not the E3 that you're used to.
3860000	3863000	But anyway. All right.
3863000	3869000	Well, let's move on and talk about an awards ceremony that doesn't usually involve video games.
3869000	3873000	It's the Hugo Awards. So Hugo Awards is it's science.
3873000	3880000	It's for science fiction and fantasy writing. The Hugo Awards are usually done at the World Science Fiction Convention.
3880000	3885000	And this is there's going to be the seventy ninth is coming up in August.
3885000	3890000	This is going to be the first year that they're actually going to honor a video game.
3890000	3901000	And they have announced the finalists for what is going to be declared as the Wendy Hugo Award, I guess the first Hugo Award for best video game.
3901000	3908000	And the finalists include Hades and Animal Crossing.
3908000	3911000	And a lot of people are kind of raising their eyebrows to Animal Crossing.
3911000	3917000	It's certainly not a bad game. I'm not here to say that. But it just you don't usually think science fiction.
3917000	3923000	When you think of animal. Well, maybe it is for some folks. I don't know. But anyway, other games that are nominated.
3923000	3930000	The Last of Us, part two, Spiritfarer, Blaseball and the Final Fantasy seven remake.
3930000	3934000	So kind of an interesting lineup of games there. Nominated.
3934000	3938000	As much as I love Animal Crossing, it doesn't tell a story. Yeah, it is.
3939000	3946000	Unless you're writing fanfiction based about, you know, your rivalry with Phil the Bird.
3946000	3954000	Maybe that's what it is, is the the head canon, so to speak, that people are writing for themselves since it is.
3954000	3957000	Oh, my God. Who hit Ed with the bug net?
3957000	3965000	I suppose they're just just the stories of island life and adventure that people are creating, because it is a pretty powerful tool for that stuff.
3965000	3971000	So. The day Marshall left me.
3971000	3976000	Anyway, not nominated, which surprises a lot of people, Half Life, Alex.
3976000	3982000	Now, that's a game you think of science fiction and all that, and it got pretty good accolades last year.
3982000	3988000	So it's a little bit surprising that that one is not there, but it is what it is.
3988000	3990000	I don't know where the nominees came from.
3990000	3995000	I'm sure they have a process that's outlined somewhere that I just don't have in front of me right now.
3995000	3998000	But that's that's the list.
3998000	4002000	I'm looking in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.
4002000	4005000	And Bobby says, Is Blaseball even a video game?
4005000	4009000	I thought it was just a Web site to which Pixel Pacas replies.
4009000	4014000	It's a Web game of sorts. Quest Buster says it's a bizarre lineup, to say the least.
4014000	4018000	Yeah, it is. I'd be very interested, like kind of like how they came up with this list.
4018000	4021000	Not that I'm questioning it. I mean, it's, you know, their award ceremony, whatever.
4021000	4025000	But I'm just kind of curious, like, how did how did something like Blaseball get in there?
4025000	4029000	Which I I think I've maybe heard about that once or twice ever.
4029000	4032000	But but interestingly enough, I say that.
4032000	4040000	Yet I look at the replies to this tweet and like the first two are all like, go Blaseball, like the first two.
4040000	4043000	So it definitely has its fans that are thrilled about that.
4043000	4046000	So. All right.
4046000	4051000	Anyway, let's move on. Dark Sakura. Oh, something something we were talking about kind of earlier in the show a little bit, right?
4051000	4056000	Indeed. We are getting back to GameStop and stonks.
4056000	4059000	The stonks. Oh, anyway, I'm sorry.
4059000	4063000	I have to say so. Bobby is saying this is the third year of the award.
4063000	4068000	Apparently, it was won by Bandersnatch in twenty nineteen and in twenty twenty.
4068000	4072000	The outer worlds won it. Well, I swear what I was looking at said it was the first.
4072000	4076000	Is there are they changing?
4076000	4080000	They're honoring a video game for the first time.
4080000	4088000	Says pretty clearly, clearly here. I'm trying to see if like it's a different than what they posted something about the Nebula Award.
4088000	4092000	OK, so maybe it was. Oh, OK.
4092000	4099000	So there was an award for game writing, but not necessarily just for the video game period.
4099000	4103000	That I think is the difference there. Interesting. All right.
4103000	4108000	Sorry. Back to Game Stonk. Game stink.
4108000	4116000	Anyway, their CEO, George Sherman,
4116000	4129000	by the way, is under some speculation about leaving the company, got rid of about 12 million dollars in shares of stock.
4129000	4137000	And basically, those proceeds are earmarked by the company to pay compensation related taxes.
4137000	4150000	That's seventy six thousand ninety seven shares were withheld by Game Stonk upon vesting to cover taxes from the twenty nineteen inducement award.
4150000	4154000	And that's according actually to a regulatory filing from Friday.
4154000	4162000	The shares were valued at one hundred and fifty six dollars and forty four cents each or about eleven point nine million.
4162000	4168000	Game Stonk hasn't hasn't commented on it, but.
4168000	4174000	Ryan Cohen, who is their incoming chairman.
4174000	4183000	Is is basically he forfeited ninety eight million in compensation after failing to help them meet their performance targets.
4183000	4186000	So we'll see.
4186000	4192000	Well, that's nice to see someone not get an award because they didn't do what they said they were going to do.
4192000	4198000	Too many times we hear about these executives getting huge ass bonuses when it's like you didn't do anything.
4198000	4202000	You made you made the situation worse, in fact. So I guess there's that.
4202000	4210000	But I'm still always kind of raises eyebrows when you see an executive sell off a big amount of stock like that, even though it sounds like they're kind of trying to explain it.
4210000	4214000	But where's that money come from? It still means that ship is sinking.
4214000	4219000	Yeah. Where's that money come from? All the people that was trying to send Game Stop to the moon and held out.
4219000	4225000	Right. That's where that money is going to come from. Right. So anyway, we'll see how that goes.
4225000	4230000	Moving on. Loki kind of wrapping up some big announcements from this week, right?
4230000	4236000	Yep. So we had another Nintendo indie world, I guess, direct, if you will.
4236000	4243000	And lots of different games were kind of announced, different things coming to the switch.
4243000	4253000	So, of course, some of the highlights there. We had looks like Cris Tales, which looks like a pretty cool looking JRPG.
4253000	4258000	Road 96, which is a procedural road trip adventure game.
4258000	4263000	They showed some more gameplay of Ninja Turtles Shredder's Revenge, which looks awesome.
4263000	4271000	I can't wait to play that. It looks good. They had Olli Olli World is going to be coming to the switch as well.
4271000	4276000	The House of the Dead remake. I'm curious to see how that works out.
4276000	4281000	I wonder if the actual Joy-Cons can work as like kind of like gun type things.
4281000	4288000	Otherwise, it'll be kind of weird with the analog sticks. But yeah, excited about that.
4288000	4294000	Looks pretty cool. What else? Oxen Free 2 lost signals.
4294000	4300000	So that's pretty sweet. And that's coming later this year. What else?
4301000	4308000	Skull the Hero Slayer. The Aztec Forgotten Gods.
4308000	4313000	And a game called... what was it?
4313000	4318000	Aerial Knights Never Yield. So lots of cool looking stuff.
4318000	4327000	And, of course, Fez also was something that, you know, it's been out on every platform, but now it's also coming.
4327000	4333000	Oh, who cares? Sorry, but that game is long past its prime.
4333000	4340000	What about there was that Konami game that showed up in the indie showcase that kind of raised a lot of eyebrows, right?
4340000	4348000	So it's a remake of an old Konami game. And they were saying it's a game. It never came out here.
4348000	4351000	So it's not one that most people here would know.
4352000	4360000	That's it. But they say that kind of had a huge influence on the Ninja Turtles game, the Konami one.
4360000	4368000	Not the arcade game, but the original Konami Ninja Turtles game that some people loved and some people thought was difficult garbage.
4368000	4371000	Do they have an underwater dam level in that game as well?
4371000	4375000	I don't think so, but I'm assuming they have something just as frustrating in it.
4375000	4382000	But a lot of people are kind of raising their eyebrows because it's like, what is it? What is Konami doing at the indie expo?
4382000	4389000	Is that what we've kind of reduced ourselves to? But my understanding is that it's still kind of being indie developed.
4389000	4391000	It's Konami publishing it, right?
4392000	4394000	Yeah, that makes more sense. Yeah.
4395000	4403000	So but, you know, now, of course, then that has everybody running crazy, like, oh, Konami is back and they're going to do Silent Hill next.
4403000	4408000	Look out. It's kind of like one of those, hold on, put the car in park. We're not ready for that yet.
4408000	4411000	You know, let's let's see what happens with this still.
4413000	4420000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says supposedly it's a roguelike. And yeah, the NES original was apparently inspired by GFD's engine, from what I heard.
4420000	4426000	Yeah, like it was kind of like a similar engine or something like that. So interesting that we're getting that.
4427000	4429000	Yeah, it's very unexpected.
4429000	4438000	Yeah. All right. Moving on, let's talk about this. So Nintendo has taken the leader of Team Executor to court.
4438000	4441000	But you're not going to see that headline anywhere.
4441000	4452000	Nope, the headline you're going to see is Nintendo suing Bowser, LOL, because yes, Team Executor is led by a guy named Gary Bowser.
4452000	4460000	And isn't that ironic that it also happens to be the name of the current American, you know, head, American president of Nintendo is Doug Bowser.
4460000	4463000	So LOL, all these Bowser's all over Nintendo.
4463000	4469000	But I guess it doesn't make us exciting of a headline when we say Nintendo is going after the leader of Team Executor.
4469000	4474000	It's nope. Nintendo is going after Bowser. Anyhow, so what's going on here?
4474000	4477000	So Nintendo did file a lawsuit against Gary Bowser.
4477000	4480000	He is the head of the Switch hacking group Team Executor.
4480000	4487000	And why are they suing him? Because of allegedly violating copyright by making and selling hacks.
4487000	4490000	This is not the first time this guy has been in the news.
4490000	4493000	And you might be thinking this as well, like, didn't this already happen?
4493000	4499000	Yeah, he was arrested in the fall and they thought, you know, this, this would be it.
4499000	4505000	But no, the company wants to punish the leader for the copyright violation and two counts of trafficking.
4505000	4516000	Basically, they are alleging that this guy runs an international pirate ring, distributes the SX Core, the SX Lite, and the SX Pro, these Switch-oriented hacking tools.
4516000	4520000	And Team Executor is alleged to be selling this for profit.
4520000	4525000	And if successful, Nintendo gets to shut down the operations.
4525000	4533000	They get $2,500 for each traffic device and $150,000 per copyright violation.
4533000	4536000	So the financial penalties are going to be very, very large.
4536000	4547000	And that means this Team Executor will be done for, assuming Nintendo wins this, which these types of cases are going to be very hard on the defendant.
4547000	4553000	I mean, we'll see, but I bet it's a settlement before it ever goes there, but we'll see.
4553000	4555000	Anyway, is it any surprise to anyone?
4555000	4561000	Nintendo has really been cracking down on this type of stuff lately, especially, I mean, they do it for the old stuff, too.
4561000	4567000	But especially now that we're talking about the current gen stuff, the Switch, Nintendo does not like to see that.
4567000	4581000	Our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network is saying such great comments as Bowser on Bowser action, Bowser v. Bowser, two Bowsers, one Switch, a tale of two Bowsers.
4581000	4584000	A Bowser will win this case, but who?
4584000	4588000	Thank you, chat, for providing all of that lovely commentary.
4588000	4589000	All those headlines.
4589000	4590000	Gold.
4590000	4594000	Yeah, all those things I can name my YouTube on this later on, so.
4594000	4595000	So much gold.
4595000	4599000	Dark Tetsuya says, you think this guy would try to stay off Nintendo's radar with a name like that?
4599000	4600000	Yeah, yeah.
4600000	4603000	So the Bowser jokes, they just don't stop.
4603000	4605000	But there you go.
4605000	4606000	Black Compat-
4606000	4608000	Ain't no party like a Bowser party.
4608000	4612000	Black Compat in chat says two Bowsers, one Switch is so wrong.
4612000	4613000	Lol.
4613000	4614000	It kind of is, though.
4614000	4615000	It kind of is.
4615000	4618000	All right, we need to, we need to cleanse ourselves a little bit.
4618000	4619000	We need to cleanse the palette.
4619000	4620000	We need it.
4620000	4621000	We need something.
4621000	4624000	We need something nice and family friendly to come in here and fix everything.
4624000	4625000	So what-
4625000	4626000	Family friendly us.
4626000	4627000	I just spoiled that one.
4627000	4628000	I hit the wrong button.
4628000	4634000	Maybe people are already going to be able to tell what is the classic game of the week that Rob just pushed the button for a little early.
4634000	4635000	Every-
4635000	4636000	Girl.
4636000	4639000	Every week, Dark Soccer, it only showed the screen of the publisher.
4639000	4641000	That might not totally give it away.
4641000	4642000	We'll see.
4642000	4643000	It's the classic game of the week.
4643000	4647000	Every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,
4647000	4650000	Hey, you guys should be checking this game out this week.
4650000	4652000	So Dark Soccer, what game?
4652000	4653000	It's a game that brought up a bunch.
4653000	4655000	You, you have, we've all talked about this game.
4655000	4658000	And in fact, very recently did we talk about this game.
4658000	4659000	And I think some of you out there-
4659000	4660000	Yes we did, which was my inspiration.
4660000	4664000	I think some of you out there were waiting for when we would talk about this game.
4664000	4668000	And so let's get to it so I can hit the button the correct way this time.
4668000	4670000	Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
4670000	4673000	The classic game is The Lost Vikings.
4673000	4678000	So The Lost Vikings, it is a puzzle platforming game.
4678000	4682000	And for the record, when I see Interplay, the first thing I actually think of is Clayfighter,
4682000	4683000	just saying.
4683000	4684000	Yeah.
4684000	4686000	So I didn't, I maybe didn't give the whole thing away, but yeah, I accidentally showed
4686000	4689000	that Interplay logo there for a hot second.
4689000	4691000	And I don't, have I done Clayfighter?
4691000	4692000	I don't remember.
4692000	4693000	Who doesn't?
4693000	4694000	Who cares?
4694000	4699000	Anyway, The Lost Vikings, it is a puzzle platforming game that was developed by Silicon and Synapse,
4699000	4704000	which is now Blizzard Entertainment, published by Interplay, as we could see on the logo
4704000	4706000	that Rob teased us with.
4706000	4713000	It was originally released on the Super Nintendo, Super Famicom in 1993, and has since been
4713000	4721000	released to the Amiga, Amiga CD32, MS-DOS, Mega Drive, Genesis.
4721000	4728000	And the Mega Drive has a distinction of containing five stages that were not present in any other
4728000	4734000	version of the game and can be played with three players simultaneously, where the SNES
4734000	4738000	one was, you have three characters, but two people can play.
4738000	4743000	That actually kind of struck me funny as why there wasn't a third person play, like using
4743000	4745000	a multi-tap or something.
4745000	4754000	But anyway, the game, I'll go into other rereleases and whatnot about it and other versions, but
4754000	4759000	it was released on April 29th, 1993.
4759000	4765000	So we're coming up on the anniversary of the game soon.
4765000	4773000	But in this, you have three Vikings, Erik the Swift, Bylog the Fierce, and Olaf the Stout.
4773000	4782000	They get kidnapped by Tomater, the emperor of the alien, Crutonian empire for a zoo.
4782000	4784000	They're going to be in a zoo.
4784000	4788000	But they escape and then they get lost in time and they have to go through different
4788000	4794000	places to try to fight Tomater and get home.
4794000	4805000	So at any rate, it is a side schooling platform adventure, but it's also very puzzle oriented.
4805000	4812000	You have to have all three characters alive to beat the puzzles because every puzzle is
4812000	4816000	going to rely on a strength of one of the three Vikings.
4816000	4821000	So for example, Erik can run faster than the other two.
4821000	4827000	He can jump and bash through walls and enemies with his helmet.
4827000	4832000	Bylog can kill enemies with his sword or shoot them with a bow.
4832000	4835000	He has a lifetime supply of arrows.
4835000	4838000	The bow can also hit switches from a distance.
4838000	4843000	Olaf can block enemies and projectiles with his shield and he can also use a shield as
4843000	4844000	a hang glider.
4844000	4847000	That doesn't make any sense to me, but oh well.
4847000	4853000	Olaf's shield can be used as a platform for Bylog to walk over and allow Erik to reach
4853000	4855000	higher areas.
4855000	4861000	So if any of the Vikings each have three health points and they can lose it if they get hurt,
4861000	4864000	they can lose it if they get hurt or fall from a great height.
4864000	4868000	And if any one of them loses their health points, he dies and you really can't finish
4868000	4869000	the game.
4869000	4875000	You will have to restart the level and try again, but you get unlimited continues.
4875000	4881000	As far as other versions, as I was saying before, it was re-released for the Game Boy
4881000	4884000	Advance in 2003.
4884000	4892000	In 2014, the game was added to Battle.net as a free download emulated through DOSBox.
4892000	4898000	And for their 30th anniversary, Lost Vikings was re-released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo
4898000	4903000	Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One as part of the Blizzard Arcade collection in February
4903000	4906000	of this year.
4906000	4912000	There also was a sequel called The Lost Vikings 2 that came out in 1997, but who knows?
4912000	4915000	It may be its own classic in its own time.
4915000	4921000	So let's get into the many, many appearances of these Vikings.
4921000	4926000	So now there's a game that Dan is super fond of and he's been playing a lot of the new
4926000	4929000	rock and roll racing.
4929000	4934000	But in that game, Olaf and Bylog have an appearance in the game.
4934000	4940000	Olaf can be unlocked as a hidden character and Bylog appears on billboards advertising
4940000	4943000	Viking Cola on the planet Bogmire.
4943000	4949000	For the 32X version of Blackthorn, all three Vikings are in a secret area in the second
4949000	4951000	snow level.
4951000	4954000	They've also appeared in Clay Fighter.
4954000	4960000	Olaf is in Helga's ending with Helga being his girlfriend, but she dumped him for Tiny.
4960000	4962000	Aww.
4962000	4968000	Eric and Bylog's faces appear animated in sculptures in the Sage Clay Keep for Clay
4968000	4971000	Fighter 2 Judgment Clay.
4971000	4979000	And they were supposed to be appearing in Clay Fighter 3, but that game, well, it didn't
4979000	4980000	happen.
4980000	4988000	Anyway, they've appeared as NPCs in World of Warcraft in the dungeon Uldaman, which
4988000	4992000	is probably just one of my favorite places because I used to go there to farm stuff before
4992000	4995000	they, you know, had it scale up to your level.
4995000	4997000	And you can kill them.
4997000	4999000	Yes, you can kill them.
4999000	5003000	But at any rate, if you're hoarded, yeah.
5003000	5011000	One of the quests in Uldaman requires you to collect the Shaft of Sol, the Amulet of
5011000	5017000	Genikiviv, which spells out lost and Viking when read backwards.
5017000	5024000	The Shaft and Amulet are combined to form the Staff of Prehistoria, which is the theme
5024000	5031000	of Uldaman, you know, basically being little dinosaurs and shit and going in with lost
5031000	5032000	Vikings.
5032000	5039000	In World of Warcraft Cataclysm, they were prominently in an alliance faction quest in
5039000	5041000	the Badlands and Eastern Kingdoms.
5041000	5049000	In Warlords of Draenor, Olaf can appear as a random daily quest NPC if you have the Frost
5049000	5053000	Wolf Tavern or Lunar Fall in as a building in your garrison.
5053000	5062000	In Warcraft 3, the Frozen Thorns monolith scenario, the Dark Troll commando heroes are
5062000	5067000	named for the lost Vikings, Eric Swift by Lug the Fierce and Olaf the Stout.
5067000	5075000	And a unit in Starcraft 2 is called the Viking and a picture of their unit on the website
5075000	5078000	is subtitled The Lost Vikings.
5078000	5083000	You can also select Viking outfit that makes the Viking pilot.
5083000	5085000	This is in Starcraft 2 again.
5085000	5092000	Merrick mentioned the three lost Vikings getting lost and he tried to contact them.
5092000	5098000	And the coordinates are set for Norse by Norse West.
5098000	5103000	There's also an arcade console in the Cantina Battleship Hyperion in Starcraft 2 called
5103000	5107000	The Lost Viking, which is a playable minigame.
5107000	5114000	They returned as playable characters in Heroes of the Storm and they are unique in that you
5114000	5120000	can either play them as a single unit or you can control them individually by giving them
5120000	5122000	commands separately.
5122000	5124000	So I remember that.
5124000	5125000	Yeah.
5125000	5126000	Yeah.
5126000	5132000	But going back to the lost Vikings, it got some pretty favorable ratings for SNES and
5132000	5134000	Genesis from all game.
5134000	5139000	Well, actually, the Genesis version got slightly lower ratings than the SNES version at four
5139000	5143000	stars and Genesis got three and a half from all game.
5143000	5145000	EGM gave it a six point eight out of ten.
5145000	5146000	But what do they know?
5146000	5152000	And video games and computer entertainment gave them a nine out of ten.
5152000	5156000	But I think the big thing that they got scored down for from EGM was the fact that they were
5156000	5161000	looking at the Genesis version and that it doesn't have as good music as the SNES version.
5161000	5162000	All right.
5162000	5167000	And I'm sorry, just an observation from our chatter or a rumor, if you want to believe
5167000	5171000	it, dark to see in chat says, I just saw a story apparently that the Blizzard arcade
5171000	5175000	collection is getting additional games, which includes Lost Vikings two.
5175000	5177000	So that's great.
5177000	5181000	If true, we love to see those collections that get games added to them after the fact,
5181000	5185000	especially especially if it's not an additional cost, if it's additional costs, then well,
5185000	5187000	maybe it'll still be worth it because this was a fun game.
5188000	5194000	Well, there's also another theory out there that the game may have been influenced by
5194000	5204000	an Amiga game that was released by Cocktail Vision and later Sierra Online called Goblins
5204000	5206000	with lots of eyes.
5206000	5209000	That was a kind of a similar game in theory.
5213000	5216000	And but that's it.
5216000	5217000	All right.
5217000	5221000	It's it's a pretty interactive, fun game.
5221000	5224000	Supergamer gave it a ninety two percent rating when it was released.
5224000	5226000	So there you go.
5226000	5227000	All right.
5227000	5228000	Vikings.
5228000	5229000	There it is, your classic game of the week.
5229000	5231000	The Lost Vikings.
5231000	5239000	May they drink and definitely one that has continued to have influence over Blizzard
5239000	5244000	games to this day, which our soccer is kind of naming all those subsequent appearances,
5244000	5249000	even if for whatever reason, Blizzard never really did a Lost Vikings follow up, probably
5249000	5251000	because they just lost Vikings, too.
5251000	5255000	Well, I mean, sorry, I should say like all these years later, like a modern Vikings,
5255000	5256000	if you will.
5256000	5261000	But but maybe they just can really figure out where does that fit in today's game plays
5261000	5263000	like you look at the types of games Blizzard makes.
5263000	5268000	They like to make ongoing games that are, you know, trying.
5268000	5270000	I guess that's true.
5270000	5272000	So I don't have room for the puzzle games out there.
5272000	5274000	Yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe so.
5274000	5275000	So it's just interesting.
5275000	5279000	Blizzard hasn't revisited that, but maybe that's part of you know, they have that 30th
5279000	5282000	anniversary collection was a way for them to celebrate that again.
5282000	5286000	And then by throwing Lost Vikings two potentially into that as well is pretty, pretty big as
5286000	5287000	well.
5287000	5288000	So.
5288000	5289000	All right.
5289000	5292000	But I remember playing that on PC back when it first came out.
5292000	5298000	So I do I do recommend checking that one out because it's nothing like Warcraft or Diablo
5298000	5300000	or anything else that Blizzard did.
5300000	5302000	And again, they weren't even called Blizzard back at the time.
5302000	5306000	There was Silicon and Synapse or whatever they were.
5306000	5308000	But it was a very different type of game for them.
5308000	5309000	But it's still neat.
5309000	5314000	And yeah, you kind of see see these characters that showed up in like you said, Heroes of
5314000	5316000	the Storm was a big, big deal for that and so forth.
5316000	5317000	So absolutely.
5317000	5318000	All right.
5318000	5325000	Well, let's I just I just remember when I when I was playing Wow and went into Cataclysm
5325000	5327000	and I was doing all of my farming.
5327000	5331000	And I think I messaged you, Rob, there's Vikings here.
5331000	5334000	And I don't even remember making the connection at first.
5334000	5339000	And then I was like, oh, yeah, because that was their game way back in the day.
5339000	5341000	Yeah, that was that was fun.
5341000	5342000	Yep.
5342000	5343000	All right.
5343000	5346000	Let's let's check out some other news going on in the gaming industry, but let's do it
5346000	5349000	kind of quick in a segment called Rapid Fire News.
5349000	5350000	Loki.
5350000	5351000	Yeah.
5351000	5358000	Yeah, so we've got some pretty cool announcements, including that now your smart device owned
5358000	5361000	by Amazon, like I said, the name is not to trigger that stuff.
5361000	5367000	You can now control your Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S.
5367000	5370000	You have to spell it like when you're doing A L E X A.
5370000	5375000	You have to do it like like when you're talking about things in front of the kids, you don't
5375000	5376000	want them to know about.
5376000	5377000	You have to spell it.
5377000	5378000	Although that is Alex.
5378000	5380000	That is Google's device, though.
5380000	5382000	That's my Google's device.
5382000	5384000	OK, it's it's Amazon, Alex.
5384000	5391000	And it can now control games, but you can actually tell it to download certain games
5391000	5396000	from Game Pass and it will allow the app to do that for you.
5396000	5398000	Of course, you have to link your Microsoft account to it.
5398000	5401000	But if you do that, then you can do it.
5401000	5406000	So that's a neat little thing that you can do that I will probably never use.
5406000	5414000	And then to continue on with the the myriad of cameos that we've had for the season of
5414000	5420000	Fortnite, now we have Aloy from Horizon Zero Dawn making an appearance.
5420000	5421000	Aloy.
5421000	5422000	Fortnite.
5422000	5423000	That's fine.
5423000	5424000	Aloy, whatever.
5424000	5428000	And that's actually that started this week.
5428000	5432000	So interesting to see who else they're going to add to this.
5432000	5438000	It's becoming quite the Smash Brothers of of, you know, arena fighting games.
5438000	5441000	I love the 2020s, the game.
5441000	5442000	Yes, exactly.
5442000	5443000	And then some really.
5443000	5445000	I mean, things like Tron and stuff in there.
5445000	5448000	It's I love the 2020s and then some.
5448000	5450000	It's it's a pop culture orgy is what it is.
5450000	5452000	Let's just call Fortnite what it is.
5452000	5453000	All right.
5453000	5457000	It's like we'll take money from whomever you want your character in here.
5457000	5458000	You got the money.
5458000	5459000	Yeah, we'll throw it in there.
5459000	5460000	It's pop culture.
5460000	5461000	Gun orgy.
5461000	5462000	The game.
5462000	5463000	Yeah.
5463000	5464000	All right.
5464000	5465000	Mr. Peanut.
5465000	5466000	Yeah.
5466000	5467000	We're going to bring Mr. Peanut in here.
5467000	5468000	All right.
5468000	5469000	I like to do that.
5469000	5471000	I'd like to see Steakhams.
5471000	5472000	Steakhams.
5472000	5474000	Steakhams versus Mr. Peanut.
5474000	5478000	Dropping woke knowledge on the various matches.
5478000	5479000	All right.
5479000	5480000	Dark Soccer.
5480000	5482000	What do you have for us?
5482000	5488000	Oh, I still hope that I'll be able to play this through Stadia.
5488000	5492000	But Mass Effect Legendary Edition is going to have something beautiful.
5492000	5498000	It's going to have photo mode so I can take pictures of my space bird husband.
5498000	5500000	Garris.
5500000	5504000	What kind of what kind of pictures of Garris?
5504000	5505000	Tasteful ones.
5505000	5506000	Get your mind out of the gutter.
5506000	5509000	I was thinking black and white photography.
5509000	5513000	Well, OK, I'll take sexy poses anyway.
5513000	5514000	So, yeah.
5514000	5520000	Garris photo mode in Mass Effect Legendary Edition also.
5520000	5525000	And there's been a lot of talk of this in some of the chats I've been in, but Resident
5525000	5530000	Evil is joining Dead by Daylight in June for their next big release.
5530000	5532000	We don't know who it is.
5532000	5535000	Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.
5535000	5539000	This means Silent Hill and Dead by Daylight.
5539000	5542000	I'm sorry, Silent Hill and Resident Evil in the same game.
5542000	5543000	Yeah.
5543000	5548000	Well, I mean, the game is just this huge multiversal crossover anyway.
5548000	5550000	I love that analogy you gave last week.
5550000	5553000	It's it's the multiverse of 80s and 90s horror movies.
5553000	5555000	It really is.
5555000	5561000	Well, at any rate, all that you see in the teaser is just, you know, someone on the hook.
5561000	5565000	You see feet and you see an umbrella badge falling.
5565000	5570000	Now, we have had all kinds of speculation about this in our various chats, and I still
5570000	5575000	think it would be absolutely hilarious if the killer is Albert Wesker.
5575000	5582000	And that you have to play Barry and Rebecca.
5582000	5590000	I mean, we got to we got to survivors from the Stranger Things.
5590000	5591000	So why not?
5592000	5594000	So, so quickly, who do you want it to be?
5594000	5595000	Who will it be?
5595000	5599000	Because I mean, for me, the the who will it be?
5599000	5602000	I actually think it will be Wesker.
5602000	5605000	It would be cool if it was Wesker.
5605000	5609000	My, my, my want I want Lady Demi.
5609000	5611000	I want her domestic.
5611000	5616000	I'm sorry, I can't say it, but I want her because honestly, you know, and I know, yes,
5616000	5620000	I want the whole fanboy explosion that would happen with that.
5620000	5622000	But I think she would be a great killer.
5622000	5624000	I really do.
5624000	5627000	And we need a fucking vampire in that game.
5627000	5631000	I think it but but of course, you think of Resident Evil, you think more of zombies.
5631000	5634000	And so I kind of think that's why it's going to be or it's an act Efton Chad is saying
5634000	5639000	Nemesis and it makes a lot of sense to but I think Wesker Wesker.
5639000	5642000	I feel like it's going to be a human of some sort human.
5642000	5647000	We've already got the big lumbering hulking, you know, characters true.
5647000	5648000	We have.
5648000	5656000	I mean, I would put a trapper in that category a little bit and
5656000	5659000	the huntress definitely isn't that huge lumbering category so quickly.
5659000	5661000	Who do you who do you want it to be?
5661000	5663000	Who do you think it will be?
5663000	5670000	I would love to have a Code Veronica pack where the killer is like Alexia Ashford and
5670000	5673000	you have Steve and Claire.
5673000	5680000	But I would really like, of course, Chris, Jill and and the Mr.
5680000	5682000	X or Tyrant or whichever one it was.
5682000	5685000	Yeah, it might be that.
5685000	5690000	I think likely because I think the next Resident Evil game is supposed to be centered around
5690000	5692000	Chris and Jill again.
5692000	5698000	It might be unlikely that we're going to get the bigger names as characters in Dead by Daylight.
5698000	5699000	Then again, it could happen.
5699000	5708000	I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if we end up with something like like Barry and Rebecca
5708000	5714000	and maybe some other, you know, big hulking lumbering beast.
5714000	5720000	I would love, though, for the like my wet dream would be to have Wesker be the killer.
5720000	5721000	All right.
5721000	5722000	All right.
5722000	5723000	Rapid fire news.
5723000	5724000	We should probably move on.
5724000	5725000	Thank you for indulging a little bit there.
5725000	5727000	But the news of that pack is pretty exciting.
5727000	5729000	I have to go retrieve a cat.
5729000	5730000	Give me.
5730000	5732000	Yeah, we can see Miss Midna walking around there on the floor.
5732000	5734000	It's kind of cracking me up.
5734000	5735000	All right.
5735000	5740000	Anyhow, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates, starting with Loki.
5740000	5741000	I love it.
5741000	5742000	I love what Jamie thinks.
5742000	5743000	She's turned off her camera and she has.
5743000	5744000	Oh, wait.
5744000	5746000	Maybe she actually meant to leave it on because she she's picking up a minute.
5746000	5749000	Anyway, let's check out release dates.
5749000	5750000	Loki.

5811000	5814000	Hey, that's the title. I'm going to say the title.
5814000	5815000	OK, fine, fine.
5815000	5817000	That's how we're going to refer to it every time.
5817000	5820000	Death end request.
5820000	5821000	Just no, just no.
5821000	5829000	The day this show inevitably ends, the final episode number will be pie and you have to read it in full.
5829000	5831000	All right.
5831000	5832000	That'll be the show.
5832000	5834000	OK.
5834000	5836000	And that's it for the week.
5836000	5837000	All right.
5837000	5840000	Let's look at Japan and check out the releases over there.
5840000	5844000	So on the switch this week, coming out on the 22nd.

5858000	5860000	That same Wonder Boy Asha in Monster World.
5860000	5863000	I think we're as retro fans are really looking forward to that.
5863000	5865000	That is also out in Japan this week.
5865000	5872000	And we get an Atelier mysterious trilogy deluxe pack coming out this week in all sorts of different configurations there.
5872000	5877000	And I believe the games are also releasing individually if you want to buy them that way.
5877000	5881000	Japan also gets Fight of Animals comes out this week.
5881000	5882000	Wait.
5882000	5884000	So is this a game where, like, animals fight?
5884000	5885000	Like, what?
5885000	5888000	Oh, my God, I think it is what it would imply.
5888000	5890000	We already have brutal this.
5890000	5891000	No, y'all.
5891000	5892000	Oh, my God.
5892000	5896000	You have to see this game.
5896000	5898000	The screenshots are cracking me up.
5898000	5901000	It's like a fighting game.
5901000	5906000	It looks like Street Fighter and it's like Power Hook Dog versus Mighty Fox.
5906000	5909000	And this is crazy.
5909000	5910000	Hold on.
5910000	5911000	Hold on.
5911000	5914000	I got to I don't know if I have a scene set up for Twitch to show this.
5914000	5915000	Do I?
5915000	5916000	Hold on.
5916000	5917000	I'm sorry, guys.
5917000	5918000	We'll do it live.
5918000	5919000	We will.
5919000	5921000	What's this game called again?
5921000	5927000	Fight of Animals, Nintendo Switch.
5927000	5929000	Oh, it is in the US as well.
5929000	5930000	Yeah, it's already out.
5930000	5931000	Oh, wow.
5931000	5934000	So it's getting its own release over in Japan.
5934000	5936000	Let me see if this works.
5936000	5937000	Does this work?
5937000	5940000	Oh, I have no idea what I just did there.
5940000	5942000	Well, I don't.
5942000	5944000	OK, yeah, that's not going to work.
5944000	5945000	Sorry, guys.
5945000	5947000	So you'll just have to know I want this to work.
5947000	5949000	Hold on.
5949000	5951000	Well, then let me let Midna out of the room.
5951000	5952000	OK, there we go.
5952000	5953000	I got it.
5953000	5957000	OK, so I got it to show on the screen there so you can actually see how ridiculous this
5957000	5961000	game looks with like the Hulk up dogs and all this stuff.
5961000	5963000	Like what is going on there?
5963000	5964000	That looks ridiculous.
5964000	5967000	I don't see the horn version in the bottom.
5967000	5970000	They have slender cat long man.
5970000	5975000	I bet I better get that off the screen then if there's like Rule 37 showing up in there.
5975000	5976000	Sorry.
5976000	5977000	Unintentional.
5977000	5978000	Anyway, so that's that's this game.
5978000	5979000	And it looks insane.
5979000	5980000	I love it.
5980000	5983000	So that is coming out of Japan this week, which apparently already existed in the US
5983000	5984000	and I didn't even know.
5984000	5986000	So the more you know.
5986000	5991000	Also coming out this week in Japan, Yo-kai Watch one and Yo-kai Watch four go into the
5991000	5996000	best hits because I think they're really trying to unload those and then typing quest.
5996000	6000000	No word if Mavis Beacon is a ancient sage in that game.
6000000	6002000	But that game is out on the switch this week as well.
6003000	6008000	PlayStation 5 gets Werewolf the Apocalypse Earthblood is out this week in Japan.
6008000	6012000	And the PlayStation 4 I imagine has a lot of those same titles as the switch.
6012000	6018000	Oh, NieR Replicant is also getting its Japanese release this week as well as that Atleur trilogy.
6018000	6020000	Werewolf the Apocalypse.
6020000	6025000	There's an Assassin's Creed double pack this week with Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag and Rogue.
6025000	6031000	That is out this week and Overcooked all you can eat Japanese edition is out this week.
6031000	6033000	All right, that's a lot of releases.
6033000	6035000	How about Europe?
6035000	6039000	In Europe, we have a few things going on.
6039000	6042000	We have Judgment on the 21st.
6042000	6047000	On the 22nd, we have World War One Verdun Western Front.
6047000	6051000	We have World War One Tannenberg Eastern Front as well.
6051000	6054000	We have Taxi Chaos on the 22nd.
6054000	6057000	Also, MotoGP 21.
6057000	6059000	Pure Pool on the 23rd.
6059000	6063000	Chess Ultra on the 23rd.
6063000	6065000	Actually, the rest of these I have are on the 23rd.
6065000	6067000	We also have Zombieland Double Tap Road Trip.
6067000	6070000	Urban Flow, NieR Replicant.
6070000	6072000	And that's it.
6072000	6074000	Oh my god, the trailer for this game is fucking hilarious.
6074000	6076000	I know, I just saw Tigerclaw link that.
6076000	6079000	So now I'm like, way to stop the show, Tigerclaw.
6079000	6083000	Because now I'm not going to be able to sit here and not look at this trailer.
6083000	6085000	It's been out for a year already.
6085000	6087000	Fight of Animals.
6087000	6089000	Well, you know what, Jamie? We don't have time to play every single game.
6089000	6093000	So sometimes they fly under the radar, don't they?
6093000	6096000	All right, let me see how this goes.
6096000	6099000	I'm going to just pray this works and doing it live.
6103000	6106000	Okay, it's very loud. Sorry, I'm going to turn it down the audio just a bit.
6106000	6111000	Sorry, I don't know who puts static in the beginning of their trailer, but they do.
6111000	6113000	All right.
6113000	6115000	So we can see there.
6118000	6120000	This is...
6120000	6125000	I feel like I'm looking at, like, the next step before furry porn.
6125000	6127000	Is what I'm really looking at.
6127000	6129000	No insults.
6129000	6131000	This is so out there.
6131000	6133000	No insult intended to any furries.
6133000	6136000	I'm just saying, I've seen this before on dark parts of the internet.
6136000	6140000	Oh my god, they really do have Longcat as a character, except they called it something else.
6140000	6142000	Slendercat.
6142000	6143000	Yeah.
6143000	6145000	You know what?
6145000	6148000	I don't mind that something like this stops our show.
6148000	6150000	It's great. All right.
6150000	6154000	All right, everybody say thank you, Tiger Claw, for stopping the show.
6154000	6157000	Thank you, Tiger Claw.
6157000	6160000	All right.
6160000	6162000	Moving on.
6162000	6166000	Let's see, we did all the Europe releases as well, right?
6166000	6168000	Yeah.
6168000	6170000	And then we can get back into some news.
6170000	6172000	And I think we start with some news on Loki's favorite game.
6172000	6174000	Yes.
6174000	6180000	So unfortunately this week they did announce a delay for the newest update for Minecraft Java Edition.
6180000	6182000	Actually, all editions, I guess.
6182000	6184000	Caves and Cliffs.
6184000	6186000	So some of the changes that are going to happen now.
6186000	6191000	Originally it was supposed to come out this summer, but now they're splitting it into two parts.
6191000	6196000	So they have the initial update, which is still scheduled for this summer,
6196000	6201000	which is going to add some new building blocks and I believe the new mobs that are in the game.
6201000	6205000	So the axolotl, the glow squid, the goats.
6205000	6211000	And I'm not sure if they're adding the new mobs in there as well,
6211000	6216000	but at least the passive stuff that they've had in the betas right now.
6216000	6218000	So that's all supposed to come out this summer.
6218000	6222000	Then the brand new cave generation that's been happening,
6222000	6226000	the massive update that's completely redesigning that.
6226000	6228000	That's going to be a holiday release.
6228000	6230000	They're going to do an update for that as well.
6230000	6232000	Tell me more about that.
6232000	6234000	How do you redesign the way caves are generated?
6234000	6237000	It's completely nuts.
6237000	6241000	So right now everything's kind of spaghetti that's just all over the place.
6241000	6243000	These kind of spaghetti things.
6243000	6246000	So the brand new caves are very varied.
6246000	6248000	So they have different biomes in there.
6248000	6252000	For example, they have lush caves with like tons of greenery and moss and stuff.
6252000	6257000	They've got dripstone caves with stalactites and stalagmites in there.
6257000	6260000	Giant caves filled with water.
6260000	6263000	And then all of these different cave types are also having different generations.
6263000	6267000	So there's some that are these massive caverns that are just absolutely enormous.
6267000	6271000	Some with different varying water levels that are in there.
6271000	6273000	So you can have different underwater caves.
6273000	6277000	There's some caves there they call like Swiss cheese caves and stuff.
6277000	6279000	So it's all this different cave generation.
6279000	6284000	And then on top of that, this is probably why they're delaying everything.
6284000	6287000	They're increasing the build height in the game.
6287000	6289000	So they're increasing, I think, by 64 blocks.
6289000	6295000	And they're also decreasing the bottom down to negative 64 instead of zero.
6295000	6300000	So below that, you've got like the well, they were calling it the deep dark at one point.
6300000	6305000	I can't remember. That's what they're still calling now, but they've got different stone types in there.
6305000	6311000	And then they're supposed to have, gosh, I'm trying to remember what the big new monster is.
6311000	6315000	I think it's like a it's not a guardian, but I don't remember.
6315000	6318000	But it's some monster that's basically blind.
6318000	6323000	You can only hear sound, but it's supposed to be like this big OP thing.
6323000	6324000	Interesting.
6324000	6327000	So that's that's coming later, the different build height stuff.
6327000	6329000	So right now it's going to be new block types.
6329000	6332000	They may still have like the geodes and stuff that are in there right now.
6332000	6337000	So basically what we have in the betas, so the axolotls, which are pretty cool.
6337000	6345000	The glow squid, which is kind of useless, but it's the item you can make stuff glow and the goats, which are pretty neat.
6345000	6347000	And they ram stuff.
6347000	6350000	Those are all going to be coming initially in the summer.
6350000	6354000	And then the new cave generation, which is going to require them to be able to.
6355000	6362000	They really have to get the game performance to run with the extra chunks, basically, that has to load.
6362000	6366000	And so that's going to be coming the holidays, they say.
6366000	6368000	And they just needed more time.
6368000	6371000	They didn't want to push crunch and all that stuff.
6371000	6373000	So I appreciate them doing that.
6373000	6375000	I can wait.
6375000	6378000	But yeah, it's still pretty exciting.
6378000	6379000	All the changes they have coming.
6379000	6386000	And there's still a lot of stuff that's not in the betas yet, like archaeology and stuff that they haven't really shown us yet.
6386000	6389000	But copper and everything is going to be coming.
6389000	6393000	That all sounds like a reason to really visit Minecraft again, if you haven't in a while, like me.
6393000	6399000	Because, yeah, you're right, the cave layout, it's kind of like it gets old because it all looks the same.
6399000	6401000	You know, basically interesting.
6401000	6405000	Yeah, basically, like they've said, it's like you've seen one Minecraft cave, you've seen them all.
6405000	6406000	Well, not anymore.
6406000	6408000	So with this, it's going to be very, very.
6408000	6417000	Now, however, though, like, say, for example, you can't wait for a holiday, they will have a data pack that's available.
6417000	6420000	So data packs are kind of like mods for Java edition.
6420000	6423000	It tweaks different things in the game.
6423000	6430000	So they have a data pack available that you'll be able to download in the meantime to add that cave generation in there.
6430000	6433000	Now, granted, it may not be as smooth.
6433000	6435000	It may still be a little bit beta.
6435000	6441000	But it is something you can check out, even though it's not fully operational yet.
6441000	6447000	So that's something that they're adding in the meantime that you'll be able to check out if you want to start with that.
6447000	6448000	OK.
6448000	6449000	But, yeah, it's really cool.
6449000	6451000	You got to check out all the videos for it and stuff.
6451000	6452000	All right.
6452000	6458000	Well, another thing I think some of us have our eye on and want to check out is Phantasy Star Online 2 New Genesis.
6458000	6467000	So after many, many years, you know, Phantasy Star Online 2 finally came out in the US, thanks to a relationship between Sega and Microsoft or Xbox.
6467000	6469000	And we finally got that.
6469000	6476000	In fact, I was very happy to see it, but it was almost overwhelming because, like, all the content there was to catch up on was, like, all there.
6476000	6479000	And it was like, I have no idea, like, what I'm doing.
6479000	6481000	I just feel like over overwhelmed.
6482000	6489000	But the cool thing is, is that it's done successful enough, not just here, but in Japan, that they're going to launch this whole new Genesis.
6489000	6492000	So it's a way to in a way to start over.
6492000	6496000	And my understanding is that this is something that's going to run concurrently with Phantasy Star Online 2.
6496000	6502000	And this is like like I don't want to make it sound like, oh, they're erasing all PSO2 and starting with this.
6502000	6505000	It's not really the way it's working, from what I understand.
6505000	6511000	This is something that kind of exists as like a separate thing, but you can use like some of the stuff you've earned in Phantasy Star Online 2 with it.
6511000	6516000	Well, if you want to check out really what it's all about, some early beta stuff is out there.
6516000	6524000	I know some people have been playing it from like a closed alpha, but more people are going to be able to get into a global beta on May 15th.
6524000	6530000	And if you want to sign up for this beta, you can get in on that with the Xbox Insider Hub app.
6530000	6537000	So if you have an Xbox One or an Xbox Series XS, whatever, you can get an app called the Xbox Insider Hub.
6537000	6544000	And you'll be able to apply for the beta starting on April 22nd, starting at 2 a.m. JST.
6544000	6546000	So 2 a.m. in Japan.
6546000	6550000	But I imagine you'll have a little bit you'll have a little bit of time to get in on this.
6550000	6554000	And you can see just how gorgeous this game really looks in its newer form.
6554000	6556000	So that's going to be pretty cool.
6556000	6560000	And I'm sure a lot of people will be streaming around that May 15th date.
6560000	6564000	I know if I can get in, I will to see if I can hopefully make sense of it all again.
6564000	6567000	I really should have spent more time with Phantasy Star Online 2.
6567000	6572000	But like I said, I was almost overwhelmed. I would sign in and I'm like, I feel like there's so many things to do.
6572000	6573000	I don't know how to do them all.
6573000	6578000	So hopefully the New Genesis does a pretty good job of handholding and making suggestions and things like that.
6578000	6589000	So and the best part of all, when New Genesis actually releases in 2021, the U.S. and Japan will get it at the same time.
6589000	6594000	We don't have to wait for, what, 10 years or however long it took this last time.
6594000	6596000	So that's great. All right.
6596000	6601000	Pod Culture making a sci fi joke saying, when you bring Genesis to a new world, that never ends well.
6601000	6608000	I've watched Star Trek. Pod Culture also says, I kind of want a version of the Dreamcast PSO to play.
6608000	6611000	So that does exist, actually. You can't.
6611000	6616000	Well, I'm sure there's a way to play it on a Dreamcast, but I only know how to do Blue Burst on the PC,
6616000	6621000	which was essentially the Dreamcast PSO or GameCube, Xbox, wherever you played it.
6621000	6623000	And there are private servers.
6623000	6628000	And of course, in the moment, I can't remember the name of the big one, but if you Google it, you'll find it.
6628000	6633000	I realize me talking about private servers is a questionable thing.
6633000	6638000	But my understanding is Sega was pretty like, you know, they understood.
6638000	6639000	They're not going to run this anymore.
6639000	6640000	They let you have your old character.
6640000	6644000	Yeah, they let you copy your old character to basically use on private servers.
6644000	6652000	So I think it was like, E.P. I remember the name of it, but I just remember Delvin and I streamed it like a year or two ago.
6652000	6655000	We were playing this and I was talking about it on the show a little bit.
6655000	6663000	So the original PSO does still exist out there if you're willing to do private servers, which I'm really stupid when it comes to that stuff.
6663000	6666000	And I figured it out. So I'm sure you can as well.
6666000	6669000	I believe in you. All right, moving on.
6669000	6670000	I just found something out, by the way.
6670000	6671000	What's that?
6671000	6675000	Taiko no Tatsujin is on the App Store and Apple Arcade.
6675000	6678000	Oh, yeah, I thought I heard that it was an Apple Arcade thing.
6678000	6679000	Yeah, yeah.
6679000	6680000	Some version of it.
6680000	6681000	I'm going to play it.
6681000	6682000	Anyway.
6682000	6683000	Anyway, yes.
6683000	6687000	So Christmas presents already.
6687000	6688000	It's April, Jamie.
6688000	6689000	It's April.
6689000	6696000	I know. Well, that doesn't start stop Hallmark from opening up their their preorders.
6696000	6698000	You can start on July 10th to order.
6698000	6700000	Some others are going to come out on October 2nd.
6700000	6701000	But what am I talking about?
6701000	6705000	But ornaments, however, these are special ornaments.
6705000	6707000	They are video game ornaments.
6707000	6710000	They had some last year as well.
6710000	6713000	I picked up a couple of them.
6713000	6715000	There is going to be a SNES.
6715000	6716000	There was a NES last year.
6716000	6717000	I think I picked up the NES.
6717000	6721000	So this year there's going to be a SNES with Super Mario World.
6721000	6725000	And other ornaments are going to include a caped Mario.
6725000	6727000	There's a personalized Super Mario.
6727000	6729000	There's an Enderman from Minecraft.
6729000	6730000	Pixel Link.
6730000	6731000	Pixel Zelda.
6731000	6732000	Both the Legend of Zelda.
6732000	6734000	Sonic and Tails from Sonic the Hedgehog.
6734000	6736000	Knuckles, which I need the Knuckles.
6736000	6738000	King Mickey from Kingdom Hearts.
6738000	6739000	Sub-Zero from Mortal Kombat.
6739000	6741000	Charizard from Pokemon.
6741000	6743000	Donkey Kong Mario Kart version.
6743000	6745000	And Crackshot from Fortnite.
6745000	6746000	Wow.
6746000	6750000	I kind of need the Enderman.
6750000	6753000	That's quite the video game smorgasbord of characters too.
6753000	6754000	You have some real classics there.
6754000	6755000	He's got a present.
6755000	6756000	Mixed in with some contemporaries.
6756000	6757000	He's got a present.
6757000	6760000	Amethyst Rose Witch in chat says,
6760000	6761000	Ooh, I need ornaments.
6761000	6762000	It's April.
6762000	6763000	No, I know.
6763000	6764000	Everybody has to start planning.
6764000	6765000	Hi.
6765000	6766000	Everybody has to start planning now.
6767000	6771000	It's one of my bestest buddies.
6771000	6772000	Oh, yay.
6772000	6773000	Thank you for joining us.
6773000	6774000	Sj100Matt says,
6774000	6775000	True story.
6775000	6778000	Hallmark starts shooting their Christmas movies mid-spring.
6778000	6782000	Well, that I get because it takes a while for them to edit and do all that stuff.
6782000	6786000	But yeah, isn't it weird to already be thinking about the holidays in some context?
6786000	6788000	It's like this year has barely started.
6788000	6794000	This was supposed to be the year we celebrate that COVID is over and we haven't gotten there yet.
6797000	6798000	All right.
6798000	6799000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says,
6799000	6800000	We did have our first Christmas last December.
6800000	6804000	I got us a tree and a Triforce star topper, so I might have to pick up one of these.
6804000	6809000	Yeah, we have some video game ornaments too, but they're kind of like unofficial, unlicensed.
6809000	6815000	So they just they're very generic game controllers that look like Super Nintendo controllers,
6815000	6817000	although they're not really like that type of thing.
6817000	6821000	So it's enough to get the message across.
6821000	6822000	That's for sure.
6822000	6825000	All right, let's move on.
6827000	6828000	Loki.
6828000	6835000	Yeah, so lots of exciting stuff happening with the Oculus Quest 2,
6835000	6839000	so there's yet another update for it now that they're going to be pushing out a new feature called Air Link,
6839000	6845000	which allows you to stream content from your gaming PC to the Oculus Quest 2.
6845000	6855000	And apparently it's powerful enough to run lots of games, but I'm not sure if that applies to everything.
6855000	6861000	The other thing that they're also doing as well is adding 120 hertz support,
6861000	6865000	which is going to make games look even better with higher frame rates.
6865000	6866000	Oh, yeah.
6866000	6868000	But it's still exciting.
6868000	6872000	But I've got a rough desk, so I guess that doesn't really apply to me, though.
6872000	6873000	I can already play PC games.
6873000	6879000	And correct me if I'm wrong, but Quest 2, it's big kind of like selling point is that it's not really wired.
6879000	6881000	Like it's just a headset you put on.
6881000	6886000	And so, OK, I think I used one of these at an expo for my day job.
6886000	6890000	They were showing off like a training in virtual reality type of thing.
6890000	6892000	And I was I was like, OK, wow, cool.
6892000	6893000	There's no cords.
6893000	6898000	And previously, though, they did have a link that I think you get a cable that you could actually hook it up to a PC,
6898000	6901000	the actual run like different PC VR games.
6901000	6904000	But this is now actually a little bit different because it's doing it wirelessly.
6904000	6907000	So that's pretty, pretty impressive.
6907000	6909000	Bummer, it's tied to my Facebook account.
6909000	6911000	So I'm like, that's strike one.
6911000	6919000	Yeah, it says. But it says in order to do that, you have to have a really says you can play high end PC titles using the feature over Wi-Fi.
6919000	6924000	It's available in their experimental mode, which is before the offer.
6924000	6928000	You know, while they're polishing it up, obviously, they're kind of beta test mode.
6928000	6932000	But. Yeah, interesting.
6932000	6936000	Well, that kind of ties in a little bit to this last story I have to talk about tonight,
6936000	6941000	because I'm sure this is the VR game everyone would like to play on it if they could.
6941000	6946000	And that would be Half-Life, Alex, although I'm not sure because the custom the controls,
6946000	6949000	I don't know enough about the nuances of the different VR headsets.
6949000	6955000	I imagine it may not be that easy because like it doesn't Half-Life, Alex, like you actually do things with your fingers and all that.
6955000	6958000	And I don't know if the controls on the quest have that.
6958000	6961000	But anyway, I digress.
6961000	6965000	Yeah, because they have I play with the rift and the controllers are the same.
6965000	6972000	OK, OK. Well, then, well, actually, what the story is about, it's not even about playing Half-Life, Alex and VR at all.
6972000	6980000	This is kind of what we knew was coming with that when this was announced that it was going to be a VR exclusive type of title.
6980000	6984000	It's just kind of one of those. Well, how long until modders fix that?
6984000	6988000	Here we are here. That is the story I'm bringing to us tonight.
6988000	6990000	Modders are making progress on fixing that.
6990000	6994000	But is it fixing it or is it breaking it?
6994000	7004000	That is the question you have to answer, because certainly a lot of folks feel that VR is kind of integral to how this game performs and how it plays.
7004000	7009000	But it's also still going to continue to be a hurdle for some people to be able to play.
7009000	7014000	So that is a decision you all have to make for your own.
7014000	7022000	But the modding community has made it so that Half-Life, Alex, is something that is now on its way to being playable off of VR.
7022000	7030000	A modder from Argentina has made a lot of progress posting a video on YouTube this week highlighting the progress of the NoVR mod.
7030000	7039000	And apparently this one works a little different than some other mods in progress because the camera doesn't shift around with every little movement.
7039000	7042000	Alex's hands are controlled with a mouse and keyboard.
7042000	7051000	In fact, the goal of this mod are named Somnist, if I'm saying that right, trying to make the mod as close to Half-Life 2 as possible.
7051000	7056000	And so the way this looks now in this mod, this basically just looks like a source first person shooter.
7056000	7060000	Which is exactly what the developers did not want, I'm sure.
7060000	7068000	But again, hackers gonna hack, modders gonna mod, and they're gonna do it the way they wanted it to do.
7068000	7072000	Whether developers wanted that to happen or not is just what it is.
7073000	7078000	Let's see, so Somnist in a statement said,
7078000	7083000	I played the game in VR and I think the game is a masterpiece. Valve did an awesome job.
7083000	7091000	But then continuing along saying, in the current situation of my country, Argentina, it's almost impossible to get a VR headset.
7091000	7093000	Even if you try to get the cheapest one.
7093000	7101000	So I'm developing this mod because of that and because I think that it's a nice challenge to get working Half-Life, Alex, without VR.
7101000	7106000	So in this mod, only two of the eleven chapters in the game can be played with the mod.
7106000	7114000	But Somnist has some other modders working together to try to get the rest of this game playable in non-VR ASAP.
7114000	7116000	So, kind of interesting.
7118000	7128000	But you know, I'd like to play the game at some point, but I just don't know when I'm gonna pick up finally a PC-based headset.
7128000	7132000	I'm kind of more just waiting for the PlayStation 5's VR headset at this point.
7132000	7135000	But I suppose it'll just depend on what the games look like.
7135000	7140000	Because again, the systems are only as good as the games that are on it and that whole good stuff, right?
7140000	7141000	Alright.
7143000	7148000	SSJ100Matt in chat says, you tell them you can't play it without VR.
7148000	7151000	Hackers and modders will laugh at you and prove you wrong.
7151000	7154000	That's exactly what's happening here. Exactly it.
7154000	7156000	Alright, let's get into the listener round table.
7156000	7161000	So you guys can ask us some questions if you like in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
7161000	7165000	If you have any questions or stories you'd like to bring to our attention that we haven't addressed yet on the show.
7165000	7168000	This is the part of the show where we also visit the mailbag.
7168000	7171000	I'm not sure I remember seeing anything in there, but I'll check in with Jamie.
7171000	7172000	It is empty.
7172000	7173000	Alright.
7173000	7174000	It is crickets and nothing.
7174000	7178000	So send us emails. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7178000	7182000	When we don't have emails, we usually like to do a quick drag race update.
7182000	7184000	DarkSakura, who should win?
7184000	7185000	I'm behind.
7185000	7186000	Oh, nevermind then.
7186000	7189000	Well, no, I know who the final four are.
7189000	7190000	Or the final three.
7190000	7192000	There isn't three, it's four.
7192000	7195000	It is four? Okay, I know who the final four are.
7195000	7197000	Who should win, who will win?
7197000	7199000	I want Gottmik.
7199000	7202000	I think it's either going to be between Gottmik or Simone.
7202000	7205000	Yeah, that's kind of where my head is at either.
7205000	7209000	Either can win, either will win, and either way it's okay.
7209000	7211000	It's exactly where my head is at.
7211000	7215000	I think it's really become a two person race at this point between those two.
7215000	7216000	But we'll see.
7216000	7219000	Rosé's been gaining a lot in the past couple weeks.
7219000	7222000	A lot of people's favor and so forth and all that stuff.
7222000	7223000	And even Candy Muse.
7223000	7227000	There's a lot of people that really disliked her in the beginning that are kind of warming up to her a lot now.
7227000	7229000	So, who knows? Who knows?
7229000	7234000	Candy is actually not the terrible person I thought she was at the beginning of this series.
7234000	7236000	Well, they usually aren't.
7236000	7238000	It's editing and all that stuff, you know.
7238000	7240000	So, it's good.
7240000	7242000	Anyway, we have some stuff from chat.
7242000	7244000	So, let me go to PixelPakas in chat.
7244000	7257000	Hello, who says, did you folks hear the news that there is a new PlayStation 2 exploit that enables PlayStation 2s to become region free without needing to use mod chips or swap discs and tricks anymore?
7257000	7264000	So, you can play any region PlayStation 2 game or PlayStation 1 game on a system just like discs of your system's region.
7264000	7271000	I did not hear that, but that is great news because I still have a library of Japanese PS2 games sitting over there.
7271000	7275000	I have several of the older BeatMania 2DX titles.
7275000	7277000	I think I had fourth, fifth, and sixth.
7277000	7280000	Maybe I bought eighth. I don't know if I bought any after that.
7280000	7283000	And then I think I had DDR Extreme Japan as well.
7283000	7288000	So, I have a small little collection of Japanese games, but I actually had a Japanese PlayStation 2 to play them on.
7288000	7293000	I was, you guys, I was really into BeatMania 2DX for a while, like really.
7293000	7298000	So, you know, hence this show's roots and all that stuff.
7298000	7305000	So, I haven't kept up with it so great over the years, but I'd love to go back and play some of those old songs, man.
7305000	7309000	Those older styles had such great music in them.
7309000	7316000	Thank you, PixelPakas is going to post a story in our Discord on how to do it if you want to do this.
7316000	7319000	I'm trying to quickly look at the story here and how this works.
7319000	7326000	You use a memory card entry point, like Free McBoot and Fortuna.
7326000	7331000	So, you download this onto a USB stick and then launch on the console itself.
7331000	7336000	And then it creates a console-specific BIOS on the root of the USB stick.
7336000	7340000	And then you completely power down the console. That's very interesting.
7340000	7344000	Alright, I'll have to look into this in more detail later on, so check that out.
7344000	7349000	PixelPakas is going to share that on our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
7349000	7354000	And PixelPakas says you do need something initially, but after that you don't need special tools anymore.
7354000	7358000	I wonder, God, if I still have my BeatMania controller, it's over for you hoes.
7358000	7363000	I don't know if I still have that though. It's got to be somewhere. It's probably in a box somewhere.
7363000	7368000	The good old, it's in a box somewhere.
7368000	7370000	Alan and I are starting to look at houses.
7370000	7376000	And so, now we're starting to think about that whole, oh, we're going to have to box this place up. Oh boy.
7376000	7382000	So, I think we're going to throw half of it away and then box the rest up. That's what I really want to do.
7382000	7391000	So, but I'll tell you what, y'all are lucky having houses now because the real estate market here is a dumpster fire.
7391000	7393000	Yeah, it's pretty crazy.
7393000	7398000	And it's very frustrating for people who don't own yet like me who really want to get into that.
7398000	7408000	It's like our options are so limited. It's like a house goes on the market Friday and by Monday they have 50 bids and 30 of them are over the asking price.
7408000	7416000	It's disgusting. So, Pod Culture in Chat says, oh boy, new OLR studio time. That's the hope.
7416000	7423000	We were looking at a new house today and trying to kind of imagine what a setup for OLR might look like in there.
7423000	7433000	I have a feeling that OLR may go back to being in a bedroom sort of thing or a spare room, if you will, than a very large open living space.
7433000	7438000	This current place that we're in now has like two, it has like a family room and a living room.
7438000	7445000	So, OLR is set up in the space that would be the family room, basically. A lot of houses we're looking at don't have two rooms like that.
7445000	7454000	So, we'll see. I don't know. We'll make it work. If worse comes to worse, we keep doing it distance.
7454000	7461000	But it's not my favorite option, but it would work. We've been able to get away with doing the show as long as we have this way. So, we'll see.
7461000	7470000	Let's see. PixelPockets continues. I just posted that article in Discord.
7470000	7475000	I'm going to write a how-to article as well because it's a bit tricky for those who don't have experience with the PS2 modding scene.
7475000	7478000	Yes, thank you, thank you. I would appreciate that for sure. So, yeah.
7478000	7484000	SG100Matt says, prices have jumped up to 30% from last year. Sure, interest rates are low, but the market stinks.
7484000	7489000	It sure does. It's very frustrating. But what can you do? It is what it is.
7489000	7494000	All right. Do we have any last-minute stories? Checking in with Loki. Have any last-minute stories tonight?
7494000	7501000	Yeah, I was going to mention that Mario Maker 2 is having its last NINJY speedrun event ever.
7501000	7511000	That's going to happen on the 27th of April. It's going to run through the 27th of April at 7 p.m. Pacific time.
7511000	7516000	And then that's it. That's done. The Nintendo said, done with Mario Maker 2.
7516000	7525000	Yeah, in fact, we kept this game going longer than we intended. It was also supposed to die on March 31st, but, you know, the COVID.
7525000	7528000	The COVID. We have to kill Mario. Yeah.
7528000	7533000	I will say, somebody posted, again, talking about our Discord a lot tonight, but hey, come join us.
7533000	7544000	Somebody had posted a YouTube of somebody remade World 1-1 from Mario 2 in Mario Maker.
7544000	7556000	And it's really interesting. Obviously, it's not totally correct because the mechanics between Mario Maker and Mario 2 are very different, but a lot of it looks very good.
7556000	7563000	It's pretty well done. I thought it was an interesting kind of video. So check that out if you haven't seen that yet.
7563000	7568000	Also in our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord. Any other last-minute stories?
7568000	7569000	That's it.
7569000	7579000	All right, then I guess we wrap things up for the night. There's been a lot of shorter news weeks lately, but as June gets closer and closer, it's going to ramp up again.
7579000	7588000	Especially, you know, hopefully as things, more and more people get vaccinated and more and more things open up, knock on wood, and a lot of these developers are returning to an office situation when it's safe.
7588000	7593000	We're going to really start to get a lot more gaming news. It's going to be very interesting.
7593000	7600000	But that's the point where we start to say good night. So I want to thank everybody for tuning into Orange Lounge Radio tonight and listening to our show.
7600000	7609000	Really appreciate that. Whether you were here live on Twitch or if you were listening on the podcast feed via Spotify, iTunes, wherever it is that you check out the show.
7609000	7616000	Thank you. Thank you so much. Help us spread the word. Tell a friend or two about the show because word of mouth goes a long way in spreading the news about the show.
7616000	7627000	We try to be the show where every gamer has a voice and we want more voices here to share opinions and, you know, a polite debate on games and things like that.
7627000	7637000	So another thing that goes a very, very long way, an auto host on, I almost said VOG Network, on Twitch of VOG Network goes a very, very long way.
7637000	7643000	So thank you to all of you that have auto hosting for VOG Network set up on your Twitch channel. Really, really appreciate that.
7643000	7651000	If you feel so inclined and you want to buy some merchandise, vognetwork.com slash shop is the place to do it.
7651000	7656000	Or on our Twitch page, just scroll down below and you'll see a link there to the store if you're on the web.
7656000	7662000	If you're on console or something, you can't scroll down and see that. So you have to check on a browser, vognetwork.com slash shop.
7662000	7669000	Big thanks again to those of you that do the bits and the subs and all that stuff. Really, really appreciate it.
7669000	7676000	Trying to create more content for you to make those subs really worthwhile and we have more to come on that hopefully in the future.
7676000	7682000	That's all on my mind for now. I think we can go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
7682000	7685000	So Dark Soccer, I'll start with you tonight. What's your final thought?
7685000	7696000	I am trying to find something other than Parallels to try to run Windows just in case I can't get Mass Effect on Stadia. So we'll see.
7697000	7709000	My final thought is happy birthday, Jamie. Enjoy it tomorrow. Have the best birthday in light of the world situation and I can't wait to hang out with you soon.
7709000	7717000	So maybe a couple weeks after you get that second Vax, maybe you and I can go out somewhere and have a nice dinner or something. Celebrate a little bit.
7717000	7718000	That sounds like fun.
7719000	7729000	And what was I going to say? Oh, my other final thought. With all the house stuff, please send some good vibes your way because Alan and I are hoping to find a winner.
7729000	7736000	We're trying to set up a day where we're going to binge a bunch of them next weekend. So I'm hoping to find a winner with that. So please send happy thoughts our way. Would appreciate it.
7736000	7738000	That'd be good.
7738000	7740000	Loki, last but not least, your final thought?
7741000	7756000	My final thought is I'm hoping to get my first episode of my videos or Minecraft stuff out this week. And then also hoping to stream some more, if not next weekend, probably the following week.
7758000	7768000	Awesome. All right. We'll look forward to that. Streaming is a good thing. Hopefully we all have a chance to do some this week. I will see you on Thursday with a bonus stream here at VOG Network.
7768000	7778000	Other than that, that is going to do it for us tonight. Thank you guys as always for checking out Orange Lounge Radio. Happy gaming this week. Have fun. There's a lot of releases this week. Hope you guys enjoy something out there.
7778000	7784000	We will be back in seven days to talk all about it. Stay safe. We'll see you next time. Bye.
7798000	7812000	At six p.m. Pacific, nine p.m. Eastern. The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.
7815000	7816000	See you next week.
7828000	7838000	Thanks for watching.
