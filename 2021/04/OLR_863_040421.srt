00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This week, a slate of cancellations arose that many, or at least, yours truly, hoped

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,660
wouldn't. It may be April 2021, but the world is only just rounding the corner and

3
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,480
we still have a ways to go. Cons are staying in their typical event timeframes, but sticking

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,220
to the online model for at least one more year. Part of me hopes that a certain portion

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,080
of this online geared content never goes away, even in the years to come.

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,000
Join your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki for conscious optimism on this and

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,860
the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,860
a voice.

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:45,720
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back. It's another week of the show

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:52,080
where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio Live once again tonight on April the

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:59,160
4th of 2021, episode number 863 of our show. My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with

12
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,600
you every week when we record. Also joining me mostly every week, sadly not last week,

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,080
but she's back this week, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

14
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,080
Hi.

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,080
Hello.

16
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,080
Last week kicked my ass.

17
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,080
Welcome back. Yeah, we talked a little bit about it on air. I mentioned that you got

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,840
the Pfizer Vax. I figured you wouldn't care if I told people that. And you were dealing

19
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,080
with some of the side effects with that. And we were we were having a laugh. Like I said,

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:27,360
we would that I got Moderna, Loki got J&J and you got Pfizer. It's very, very funny

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,260
to me. I don't know why.

22
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:36,080
So it's the triumvirate of American vaccines, I guess. Yes. Yes. But I've been I've been

23
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,000
reading that people have stronger reactions to the Pfizer one, but it also is the most

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,120
effective interest. Well, there you would be careful downplaying the effectiveness because

25
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,500
they're all you need to take whatever one they give you active. Yeah, but it's I don't

26
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,840
know what it is, but I guess that it's sort of like your body has an immediate reaction

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:07,640
to it and then etc. Yeah. But, but I also do have other underlying issues. And so I

28
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,200
expected to be sick for at least a day, but I had a migraine for like three days.

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
Yikes. But you're better now.

30
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,200
Yeah, I'm better. But the other thing is funny is that they wanted me to come back on this

31
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,280
on the 17th. And I'm like, no, I'm going to come on the 20th because the 19th is my birthday

32
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,480
and I am not going to be sick on my birthday.

33
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,120
So since you're talking about shots next week is my second Moderna shot and it's actually

34
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,280
on Sunday morning. So we I am trying to make contingency plans for O.L.R. where I may just

35
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,640
be pushing buttons. We may have a guest host next week, actually. I may just push buttons

36
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,000
and there's somebody else in the third chair next week. I don't know who I have to ask

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,300
him. I have some people in mind. I have to see who's available. But yeah. So so plan

38
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,240
on that because vaccinations, they're important.

39
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:05,620
Yeah, yeah. But the other thing, though, is that since I'm going to be fully vaccinated,

40
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:12,200
if I can get my mother vaccinated and mobile, then I'm going to try to get her out here

41
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:18,240
for Thanksgiving. Oh, that would be lovely. If not, since Dan and I both will be vaccinated,

42
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,600
I'm going to see if we can go see her instead. Oh, if she does come out here, I'd love to

43
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,560
meet her. I've heard about her all these years. Never got to meet her. My mama and I'll be

44
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,680
vaccinated. So I'll be a lady. All right. Well, you missed a messy ass show last week.

45
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,720
Let me tell you, our saga happens when I'm not there. Well, you know, the show is fine.

46
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,920
Like Loki and I held down the fort with stories and everything, but just technically it was

47
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,400
a mess. We had some major streaming issues towards the end of the show, things that were

48
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,960
just like I couldn't control them. Twitch, one of the Twitch servers went down, the one

49
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,600
we were using, and that caused problems. And then come to find out I wasn't recording the

50
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:02,120
show last week. Now, I and of course, everybody in chat is like, are you recording tonight?

51
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:08,360
Yes. Yes. I hit the button. They were asking. Yes. So it's recording. Well, here's the good.

52
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,560
Here's the good news, Jamie. Ever since we moved to Twitch, because we've had this show

53
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,400
for coming up on 19 years, a long fucking time. Right. Exactly. We were doing it on

54
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,120
Shoutcast. If we didn't record, that's it. Show's gone. But thanks to the Twitch thing,

55
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,440
Twitch always has a backup. So it was just late. So those that listen to us on the podcast

56
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,640
feed and I know there's a lot of you, the show just went up really late. And that's

57
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,200
because of the tech issues. I had to stream multiple shows together and download them

58
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,280
from Twitch. So it took me a little while longer. So sorry about that. I'm sorry, podcasties.

59
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,760
We'll do better this week. Okay. Well, I came with more fun stuff to show people on on camera.

60
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,680
So yes. Oh, look, is that a sealed copy of Final Fantasy three you're holding up? Or six,

61
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,520
but you know, three in the US. It's it's in the box. It's not I put it in plastic to keep the

62
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,680
box. Oh, okay. I got you a real protector. And that's, that's a game celebrating an anniversary

63
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,600
as of like, I think, a couple days ago. Yep. I'll be showing off a different game every so often

64
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,280
as we go through the show today. Well, if you do want to watch us live on Twitch,

65
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,080
you can participate with us live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific Pacific,

66
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,960
six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwell show over at the Voice

67
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,800
of Geeks network twitch.tv slash VOG network. And if you do want to watch the video to see

68
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,720
the random objects Star Sacra holds in front of the camera, then you can subscribe to our channel

69
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,240
over at VOG network and you get access to all of the archives, you get the entire on demand stuff

70
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,440
included with your subscription. And that includes some bonus things that are up there including

71
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,680
Bobby Blackwell's VHS stream that he did a few days ago. And we have some award show things

72
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:56,920
that we did and get this just moments ago in our chat. The live participants have unlocked the next

73
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:03,320
bonus stream. So I will be talking to Shane shortly to set up Shane's definitive Pokemon

74
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,760
ranking that will be happening in the next couple weeks. I told him end of April because I didn't

75
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:15,240
think we'd raise the points that fast. Having the tech issues I think helped because people were

76
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,120
able to donate extra points. But so it may be a little bit because I did tell Shane it would be

77
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:26,680
a few weeks. But I also think Shane may be wanting to take the opportunity to spread his

78
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,720
Oshawa propaganda. I mean, who knows who might be number one on his list, but he'll take his

79
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,040
opportunity probably as soon as he possibly can. So we'll work that out in the coming days.

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,680
And yeah, Shane in chat saying you'll never guess who number one is. Well, even I may not be able to

81
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:49,000
guess who number two is, unless it's just evolutions of Oshawa, in which case I wouldn't

82
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,200
be able to guess who number four is. So we'll get down to this. This is what we're going to find out

83
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,440
on the next bonus stream. So that'll be coming at some point. We will announce the day on our

84
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:05,160
social media, twitter.com slash vog network. We'll announce it on our Discord, vognetwork.com slash

85
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,240
Discord. You will know when that's happening. And then of course, if you're a subscriber,

86
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,760
you can always watch it on demand, but it will not be podcast. That is the other thing about

87
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,480
these bonus feeds. They are things that are meant for Twitch. So they are not podcast anywhere.

88
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,960
So, all right. Anyway. Well, and by the way, if anyone wants to make an offer on any of

89
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,720
these games I'm holding up, talk to me. Okay. And Shane in chat is saying everything is fair game.

90
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,920
Megas, Gigantamaxes, forms, doesn't matter so long as it's been in the main game. All right. We'll

91
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:37,240
see. We'll see what happens. Okay. Loki, I hate to ignore you. I'm sorry. I had a lot of housekeeping

92
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,800
to get out, but hello. Techmaster Loki also here. Hi. Hello. How are you? I'm doing all right.

93
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:51,800
What's the game behind you tonight? It's just, it's very, um, much in theme with

94
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:58,520
recently released trailers. Oh, is it Space Jam? No, they never made a Space Jam game,

95
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,800
but you're close. They have that song, the title screen. Hold up, hold up. They never made a Space

96
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:12,520
Jam video game? No. Okay. What do they call, what do they call that phenomenon when like

97
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,680
you remember that the flute fruit of the loom logo has a quarter copia in it, even though it

98
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,960
doesn't and that like you think the Flintstone or the, yeah, that whole thing, what is that called?

99
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,720
Mandela, the Mandela effect, right? Yeah. Okay. Am I, am I having a Mandela effect right now?

100
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,480
Cause I swear to God, there was a Space Jam video game. There was no Space Jam video game,

101
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:38,360
no Space Jam video game. Oh my God. Oh my God. Yes, there is. I'm dis I'm like,

102
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:45,640
disassociating live on air game. Thank God. Where was it? It came out on Sega Saturn,

103
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:51,960
um, PlayStation and MS-DOS and it ran on the NBA Jam extreme engine. Okay. I was starting to

104
00:08:51,960 --> 00:09:00,680
disassociate live on air. Oh my God. Loki. Don't do that to me. I'm old. I'm old. I've been in

105
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,840
quarantine. I've had it. Like, do not lie to me about things where I'm like, I swear.

106
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,120
He just wasn't familiar with it. No, I know. I know. I'm just giving him shit. Sorry, Loki.

107
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:22,760
So it's an RPG with basketball. It's it's Barkley shut up and jam get guidance.

108
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,640
Okay. All right. So it's, it's basketball adjacent. All right. I love that. And now,

109
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:34,040
wow. Chat is just flooding with receipts. Chat is just like, here's the Wiki. Here's the YouTube.

110
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:39,720
I owned it on Saturn. Uh, here's the gameplay on PS one. Like chat is just like pages and

111
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,600
pages of receipts. Loki. All right. That's fine. I forgot that there was a game.

112
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:51,880
Zen monkey says, I wish NBA Jam made an NBA, uh, made NBA Space Jam. Well, it was on the NBA Jam

113
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,080
engine. That's right. Yeah. I think, and I think that's why I played it. You guys know I don't play

114
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:04,920
a ton of sports games, but NBA Jam was my jam. And so that's probably why I played Space Jam

115
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,640
was because it was on a similar engine. There you go. So Bobby is suggesting that the Space

116
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,880
Jam should be classic. Well, not tonight. You've got a flag this week, but at some point

117
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,160
Space Jam will have to be a classic game of the week. Uh, just to make sure Loki is educated.

118
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:26,440
Maybe when the movie comes out, make it so, I mean, it's not really Space Jam though. The

119
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,640
new movie is basically ready player one again. So it's fine. Oh yeah. With all those cameos

120
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,040
showing up, it's kind of random, isn't it? It's got everything. It's it's got even the planets

121
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,600
with the different themes. I'm like, that's just ready player one. You basically took the script

122
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,400
for ready player one, two, and said, you know, that second ready player one book wasn't very

123
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,200
good. Let's just roll this in the Space Jam instead. So we had an idea of what we wanted

124
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,720
to do, but it's going to deviate too much from the book. So why not? Why not? All right. So,

125
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,200
uh, yeah, and, and chat, we, we can't just flip the classic game on a whim because, uh,

126
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,680
all the footage is grabbed, especially tonight. I had to stitch multiple YouTube's together for

127
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:11,720
tonight's pick. So we'll do it in July. All right. We'll mention though that Barkley shut up and jam

128
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:18,040
guidance is old enough for classic game of the week. So. All right. Next time, next time dark

129
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,080
soccer isn't here, it's your pick and we'll do it. All right. You just, last time I asked you

130
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,440
to pick it, you picked Halo. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm making a list.

131
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:33,080
Wait, we, well, we let Alan pick last week and some folks said that he did a very good job with

132
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,920
the segment. Um, and of course you were going to ask that question and I'm going to forget in the

133
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:43,000
moment. What did Alan pick last week? He picked, um, Oh my God, somebody in chat saved me. What

134
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,760
was the classic of the week last week? I don't remember what happened seven days ago.

135
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:55,400
Oh, Loki. You don't remember it either. Thank you. Super meat boy. He picks super meat boy.

136
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:03,080
Oh, that's right. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Jamie. This question was asked many times last week. Yes.

137
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:09,560
It's old enough. Exactly. So you had the same reaction. The rest of us did. And I think that's

138
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,880
why he picked it. I know he went on and he went, he looked at games that were released like 10

139
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,280
years ago. So that's like Alan's pulling off that other wig to do a wig reveal.

140
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:26,520
He sure did. Now that he's a streamer of his own accord, he's, he's, he's here to show us all up.

141
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,320
All right. I love it. All right. Uh, let's get into, uh, tonight's kickoff topic,

142
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:39,160
which ironically is about sports games. Um, this is crazy. We're talking about a lot of sports

143
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:45,720
games tonight. We've got Space Jam, NBA Jam, and now something new coming out, MLB The Show 21.

144
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,720
Why is everybody talking about this game? I think you guys know what's going on here.

145
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,560
Uh, this is a PlayStation Studios game and this has been, and I think many, I, I'm going to admit,

146
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,960
I don't play a lot of newer baseball games. I play a lot of retro stuff. Like I like baseball stars

147
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,440
and stuff, but, um, I don't play a lot of the newer stuff, but my understanding is this is kind

148
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,880
of a well-regarded baseball game. Uh, it's, it's kind of held in a better esteem than EA's series,

149
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,640
if I'm not mistaken, chat, feel free to correct me. Well, they don't even have a series anymore.

150
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,280
So it was, yes, that's it. Yes. That was it is that EA's was so bad. They stopped doing it. That

151
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:25,000
was it. Um, so, uh, MLB The Show is kind of the baseball game and, uh, people like this game, but

152
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:32,120
basically MLB came in and said, uh, in so many words, you could be selling more of this game

153
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,880
if you would put it out on other platforms. In fact, you know what, if you want to keep

154
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,800
this license, you're going to have to release this as a multi-platform game.

155
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:46,440
So we've already talked about in the past couple months, how it is a little weird that we have Xbox

156
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,800
game art with a PlayStation Studios logo on it. And many of us, you know, speaking of things that

157
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,080
we remember in our youth, many of us are having that same what that we had the first time there

158
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:02,520
was a Mario and Sonic at the Olympic games where it's like Mario and Sonic living together, mass

159
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:07,560
hysteria, right? All this. So now this is how we're feeling about the PlayStation logo showing

160
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:15,480
up on an Xbox box. But this week, the news went one step further. And that is, and I Loki, how

161
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:21,080
does this have, I don't even know how this happens, but apparently, and now the games are on it though.

162
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:30,120
So it makes sense. MLB the show 21 is going to be on game pass day one. So, and this is the part

163
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,800
that's making us all go. What is that? The game is going to be on game pass. A PlayStation game

164
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:44,040
is going to be day one on Microsoft game pass, not a PlayStation plus title, not a PS now title,

165
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:51,800
but a game pass title. Now my mind is, my mind was already blown. Now it's blended.

166
00:14:52,920 --> 00:15:00,440
Loki, how does that happen? I don't know money. I'm assuming it's money that they've said,

167
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,080
Hey, you know, we're going to pay this much money to put in a game pass. And so he's like,

168
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:11,160
we like money, so we'll do it. All right. And so, so it happened, but like, that's really all I,

169
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:19,800
all I can imagine. So yeah, it's surprising. Chat coming to save the day because admittedly,

170
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,600
I don't know my shit when it comes to sports games. That's fine. Bobby Blackwolf in chat said,

171
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:31,560
MLB made the deal with Microsoft for game pass. Sony wasn't involved. Sony merely developed the

172
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,160
Xbox version. Sony is still publishing the PlayStation five version. The Xbox version

173
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,760
of this is not published by Sony. It's published by MLB. Aha, there's the aha moment. So the

174
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,160
PlayStation studios logo shows up because they're the ones that develop the game,

175
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:53,880
but they're not paying the money to get the boxes out there, push it to retail, do all that. MLB is

176
00:15:53,880 --> 00:16:01,880
taking that cost on as part of their deal. So now MLB signed this deal with Microsoft. So first off,

177
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:08,440
whoever at Microsoft pick up the phone and called the MLB to put this offer out there is a shady

178
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,720
lady. And I mean that in the best possible way. These are the types of like business antics.

179
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:21,320
Whoever thought of that at Microsoft gets a raise. Called the MLB and said, here's an offer you can't

180
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:27,000
refuse. And the MLB accepted it. And so now as part of the publishing deal, this is on game pass.

181
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,640
So that makes a lot of sense as to how Sony probably had no say in this.

182
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,320
And they're probably pissed. So will they...

183
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,480
They're not happy about that. I'm imagining.

184
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,520
Will they end up pushing it to PlayStation now or something else as a result? I don't know.

185
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,320
It's hard to say.

186
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,160
I don't know if they would.

187
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:53,560
GZDR4ev in chat says, didn't Cuphead go from Xbox to PlayStation Plus?

188
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,920
It is not a PlayStation Plus title. It is on PlayStation. So that is a thing.

189
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,200
Even though it gets into that weird thing where it's like a Microsoft subsidiary did it, if I

190
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:09,080
am not mistaken. And of course, we know that showed up on Switch. Ori showed up on Switch.

191
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:14,600
Microsoft and Switch in cahoots together is nothing new. But it is always a little

192
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,000
funky when you see the Sony and the Microsoft stuff kind of blend the lines a little bit.

193
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,000
And some other comments in chat.

194
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,800
Tiger Claw says, this is the first time in video game history

195
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,760
that a publisher is the company responsible for baseball.

196
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,880
And yeah, Bobby says MLB publishes some of the arcade games,

197
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,640
especially in the mobile phone space. So a little bit of a correction there.

198
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,640
So but still, you know, the optics of a Sony game being on game pass,

199
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,720
no matter how it happened, is certainly making a lot of people go,

200
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,480
well, I guess Sony gave up. Because I'll bet you what? I'll bet you there's hundreds of

201
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,560
YouTubes out there talking about this topic. And I'll bet you there's hundreds of podcasts

202
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,880
out there talking about this topic that didn't have that perspective that Bobby just gave us

203
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,280
about that the MLB is the ones actually publishing it. And I bet there's a lot

204
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,000
of people out there going, what is Sony doing? Sony's putting a game on game pass.

205
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,080
And everybody's losing their minds. And I've said this a million times on the show. And I

206
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,080
really believe this to be true. And I think this is one of those golden rules of gaming.

207
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,560
You know, obviously, we have the system is only as good as the games that are on it.

208
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,040
But here's the other one that I'm putting out there. It doesn't matter what the facts are,

209
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:35,960
it only matters what's perceived. And that I think is very true here is that the perception

210
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,240
is that Sony's putting a game on game pass. And that's what's causing people to lose their minds.

211
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,440
Yeah, that makes sense.

212
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,080
Certainly, there hasn't been a lot of bad news for game pass this year. I mean, shit,

213
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:55,240
Outriders was this week, that was a huge deal that landed day one on game pass. But there's the,

214
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,080
you know, Bethesda deal and all those games hitting and so on and so on. I feel like

215
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,640
at least a quarter a third of our shows this year have had the kickoff topic starting

216
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,920
something to do with game pass and how it's growing. Because this is just crazy.

217
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:16,760
Do you think the pressure is really going to be on Sony now to step up with some sort of response?

218
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:22,680
Or I guess, you know, some would argue PlayStation now is the response. So for Sony to really step up

219
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,920
their Netflix of games type of game, what do you think?

220
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,080
I think that they, I mean, eventually, it's gonna get to that point, if it's not there already,

221
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:38,040
especially when we start getting into some bigger exclusives. Right now, it's still really early in

222
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:45,960
the game, and not a lot of console exclusives have come out. So I would imagine that once those

223
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,520
big titles start coming out, especially when we start talking about like Elder Scrolls 6,

224
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:57,960
or the new Obsidian game, or Halo Infinite when it's good. And even so much, you know,

225
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:04,280
when we look at like what Sony has offering and stuff like that, it's a really interesting

226
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,800
proposition to say, hey, you know, all these really big games you've been looking forward to,

227
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:13,080
well, they're included in game pass, you don't have to pay additional money to play those. And

228
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:19,480
I mean, you still do, but like you don't buy each individual game, you could opt in to do game pass

229
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:25,240
instead, and you get access to all of these titles. So I have a feeling though, that once

230
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,440
Sony does respond to something that Microsoft's already planning with the next move to counter

231
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,080
that. So it'll be interesting to see what's going to happen. Maybe we hear something around,

232
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,640
you know, E3 time or something like that. Maybe we don't until someone does something.

233
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,560
In chat, the question from GZDR4ev says, will Microsoft strike a deal with Marvel and get Sony

234
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:55,160
to put Spider-Man on game pass Marvel or Disney now? Well, I think the way the contracts work

235
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,200
and all that, I'm not sure they could. And I think Bobby's right when he replies, it wouldn't

236
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,320
be retroactive. It certainly wouldn't. I mean, anything is possible going forward. Money talks,

237
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,880
and if Microsoft were to throw a lot of money, they might be able to get that. But I feel like

238
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:17,080
Sony's locked into a contract there. However, you know, there's that Avengers game. And I don't see

239
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,960
why Microsoft wouldn't be trying to lobby to get that on game pass at some point, because I don't

240
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,600
think that game has sold cuckoo bananas the way they were hoping it would. And I know they've had

241
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:32,360
to do some, you know, follow up content. They just reached the next gen stuff. So I would think that

242
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,360
event. Now, I realize the Avengers and Spider-Man are different, but we are talking, you know,

243
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,560
Marvel affiliated things, right? I would be shocked if the Avengers is not on game pass by

244
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:50,280
the end of the year. But we'll see. All right. So very interesting. You got a PlayStation Studios

245
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,600
game coming to game pass in a very roundabout way. But the optics of that I'm sure are going

246
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:00,760
to put a lot of pressure on Sony in the coming months. Let's move on to our gaming week and talk

247
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,200
about the types of video games we have been playing this week. Dark Soccer, I'll start with

248
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:13,560
you. How was your gaming week? Animal Crossing. And I was going to try Ring Fit finally, but I've

249
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:21,960
got a back injury. We don't know what it is yet. My x-ray was kind of inconclusive as to what

250
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:29,960
exactly is causing it. So that being said, I'm not in the best position to do a hardcore workout.

251
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:36,760
I've just been doing yoga. I have been playing word scapes pretty religiously. Like I said,

252
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:45,160
it's my morning wake up. And I have been trying to still get away to play Dead by Daylight.

253
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:52,280
And I think the GeForce experience will allow me to do it until I can get a proper visualizer on my

254
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:59,000
Mac, because my PC will. What kept happening to it is it kept shutting down just over and over.

255
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,080
It would shut down during the middle of the show. And I think I need a new lodge. I mean,

256
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:11,960
motherboard. It's a PC and not a Mac. I think I need a new motherboard. And I don't know.

257
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,200
I'm going to try to salvage the guts out of it for when Mass Effect comes out.

258
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,960
For what it's worth, I know that game's on Stadia. Dead by Daylight is on Stadia for sure,

259
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,640
which same concept as GeForce. I do have Stadia.

260
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:29,000
So something to think about. Well, I ended my subscription to the Stadia Prime or whatever

261
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,960
it was called. You don't need it. You would just need to buy the game. But then you're

262
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,520
buying a game that exists in the Stadia cloud. And, you know, there's a whole thing that comes

263
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:43,240
about that kind of last. Oh, Bobby's saying it was actually a Stadia pro game at one point,

264
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,720
so you may have claimed it and not even realized it. I may have if I've claimed it, then shit.

265
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:53,000
Yeah. Yeah. There you go. Take a look at that. But but at any rate,

266
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,040
I've been trying to get things together, but things haven't always worked out.

267
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:06,440
So but one thing is always a constant. Animal Crossing is always there. And today was bunny

268
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,120
day. How how are the Sanrio cards and all that? Well, you you'd already been kind of using them

269
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,040
for some time, but the contents there now. So how's that been going for you?

270
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,000
It's actually really cute. You know, it's all the same characters.

271
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,080
And like for Bunny Day today, I was actually running around in the little twin stars outfit

272
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,760
so you can get full outfits. I will not wear the koropi outfit because there's a snail on it and

273
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,960
snails are disgusting and I'm highly phobic. Yeah. Things you don't know about Jamie.

274
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,800
I actually have trauma related to snails, so don't get me started.

275
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:53,480
So at any rate, the content is really nice. I only have one of the characters at all

276
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:00,840
who I let Shevra go to get it all because the personality is the same, the normal character.

277
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:09,640
And the whole house is little twin stars, furniture and the bubble maker. It's actually

278
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:15,480
a lot of the same stuff if you're playing pocket camp. It's a lot of the same stuff for

279
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:21,640
a twelves, you know, tasks that you have to, you know, DIY some of the stuff together.

280
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:35,800
In other stuff, I've actually been working on, I guess, other projects semi-related to gaming.

281
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,880
I have been working on my Twitch graphics. Oh yeah. You showed me some of that. Yeah.

282
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:53,480
And I'm planning on streaming Hive Bent 2, episode 2.

283
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,040
Nice. So we'll see how that happens.

284
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I'm going to chat for some comments. Continuing the Dead by Daylight conversation,

285
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,360
Act Def says Dead by Daylight was also PlayStation Plus one month. Yeah,

286
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,120
it's also an Xbox game pass, which means whenever X cloud is more available,

287
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,760
that's going to be an option as well. And yeah, they've been giving that game away,

288
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:20,680
so to speak, in many different places because they're still making money off all those cosmetics,

289
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,600
especially the DLC, right? We had that conversation a couple of weeks ago

290
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,080
where Dark Sakura Apple paid me five bucks. So I would play as Freddy in the game,

291
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,240
which I like him. I do. I'll follow up with that in a minute. I talked a little bit about it last

292
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,760
week, but I'll tell you more in a minute. But first, let's go to Loki. How was your gaming

293
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:44,280
week, Loki? I didn't play very much, so I have been working on my game. So I've got another eight

294
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,880
levels done, so I'm almost up to the 50 that I was going to try to do because I added two to every

295
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,960
single, well, two so far to four of the five worlds that are in Pixel Poops number two.

296
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,840
And then I did some research on the high score table, but then that looked really complicated,

297
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:06,840
so I took a break from that. Really this week, I've also been starting to get some stuff together.

298
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:14,280
I also want to start streaming on a regular basis. So like, for example, I've been getting stuff

299
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:21,960
together for doing Minecraft Let's Play stuff. So I normally play Bedrock, but I'm actually going to

300
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,160
go back into Java and do all that. And it's been a while since I've played Java, so I have to get

301
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:33,320
everything set up for that. I'm adding a bunch of vanilla tweets to cater my games similar to

302
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:38,520
what they have on Hermitcraft, some of the mods and stuff they have on there, so kind of modeling

303
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:46,200
it like that. And then I've been working on skins, so I've been trying to do those. So I'm actually

304
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:53,320
working on one right now. That looks pretty cool. So just doing all that, I have to get my workflow

305
00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:01,800
set up for editing and cutting those together. And yeah, just have to get that all set up and ready

306
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:07,320
to go so I can actually start doing it. I already have a plan of what I'm going to, content-wise,

307
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:15,560
kind of like what the flow for that would be, but I just have to get to that point.

308
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:22,760
All right. Darsagra, have you ever used Game Pass or had Game Pass on Microsoft?

309
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,320
No.

310
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:28,200
Okay. Because I have here, this is a 14-day code, but you can't use it if you already have it or

311
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,800
have ever had it. So it's like an enabler code, basically. I think I got this.

312
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,240
You know I don't have the Xbox, right?

313
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:38,120
I do, but it works. It's ultimate, so it works on PC. And whenever they put out that cloud thing,

314
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,440
it would work with that too. So I was going to give this to a listener, but I'll give it to you

315
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,040
if you want it. I'd appreciate that. Thank you. Just message it to me.

316
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:52,520
I'll mark it for you. There you go. How about that? All right. Let's move on and talk about

317
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:58,120
my gaming week. So, okay. Let's talk about the Dead by Daylight thing. So yes, you bought Freddy,

318
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,480
essentially, for me. And I talked a little bit about this last week. I really enjoy him,

319
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,800
and I play him. And as of this week, he is my highest level character. He's out-leveled

320
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,600
Pyramid Head. That's how much I play with him. I also had my first experience early this week,

321
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:18,040
where I was playing the game as Freddy, and I noticed one of the other survivors had Twitch TV

322
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:24,840
in their name or TTV. And I wouldn't look during the match because that's unfair. But after the

323
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,800
match, I went to her channel and I said, hi from Freddy. And there was some nice little banter,

324
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:36,280
but I was able to go back and watch the match from her end. And it was really enlightening

325
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:42,280
because I did not do well that match, but in my defense that watching her Twitch stream made me,

326
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,680
three of them were partnered together. And that's a lot harder, especially when you're a newer killer.

327
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,360
But I thought it was really cool that I could see things from that perspective. And luckily,

328
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,160
they weren't shit talking because I was fully expecting they were going to go, God, this

329
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,800
Freddy's bad. What's he doing? But they were just, they were more kind of doing the like,

330
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,480
boy, this Freddy doesn't like to be looped. Because I noticed I started looping him and he

331
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,560
ran right away. And that's true. I don't like to be looped. And I was running into kick generators

332
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:10,200
because I feel like they loop me because they want to distract me from generators. But anyway,

333
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,760
it was very enlightening. So yeah, playing Freddy has been a really fun experience.

334
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:19,320
So on one hand, I say dark soccer, you did a great thing. But on the other hand,

335
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,280
I'm totally neglecting pyramid head, dark soccer, you did a bad thing.

336
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:30,360
Well, do you, do you have a, I don't know if it was a free one, but do you have the nurse?

337
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:37,080
I do have the nurse that I've played as the nurse. The nurse is hard because getting that blink down

338
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:43,560
is really hard. Look up a video that talks about toxic nurse build. And it's got like

339
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:49,960
something like five blinks on her. And it's pretty amazing. What about, what about the spirit?

340
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,560
I do not have the spirit, but I want to get the spirit because she has a similar mechanic

341
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:01,880
to the nurse. Well, Rob, I adore you. And I want to see you play the spirit as well. So

342
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,120
you're getting another five bucks. I won a prize.

343
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:13,960
Oh my gosh. This is me doing it right now. This is great. This is great. I love this. I love this.

344
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:19,320
Hey, Bobby black, open chat, free killers for Rob. That's right. Dark soccer buys me murderers.

345
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,000
Don't show my phone number on Twitch. I'm just kidding. Your phone number isn't on there. Just

346
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,600
says Rob. Okay. It's funny. For a moment. I was like, my phone doesn't recognize me.

347
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:37,880
I'm wearing makeup. All right. So awesome. I've actually, I've been actually watching, um,

348
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:44,600
killer gameplay. Um, and you know, I've watched, uh, my friend Nika play quite a bit now right now.

349
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,480
She's streaming, uh, phantasmophobia with a friend of hers. They wouldn't play together. Um,

350
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:58,200
but I have been really, uh, I got to see, um, the trickster. Oh, the new one, the K-pop guy. Yeah.

351
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:03,880
Yeah. His story's kind of cool with that little animation right at the beginning of his thing.

352
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,600
He's I like him conceptually. He's a great character, but everything I'm hearing is

353
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,880
that he's not a good killer in practice. So that's too bad. I've, I've actually seen people

354
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:20,520
do pretty effectively because he's, um, got this one. Uh, I've actually got to see his, uh, Maury,

355
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:28,120
which is pretty interesting, but he's got a really good long range attack as long as you remember to

356
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:34,360
your knives. Yeah. And it's, it's really good to get, uh, for hurting palette people. So like,

357
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,680
he must've been really fucked up when he got grabbed. Cause he looks normal.

358
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:44,120
You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. I spent like basically the last three days reading the Wiki.

359
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,960
Um, dark soccer. I I'll have to talk to Alan because I don't remember in the moment,

360
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,880
the streamer's name, but there is a streamer who almost exclusively streams nurse gameplay. And

361
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:00,360
Alan really likes this guy. Um, and, uh, he plays a lot of nurse gameplay and he's really good.

362
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,000
Uh, and he's a lot of fun to watch. Cause he's really funny.

363
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,400
Watching the nurse though, makes me really motion sick.

364
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,320
Oh yeah. Yeah. That's the other one with the blink.

365
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,160
Yeah. That's the other problem is that, um, I know you're not big on first person

366
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,600
and when you play killer, you have to do for it's part of it's actually,

367
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,000
it's part of the handicap that the killers get. They have to play first person so that their field

368
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,880
of view is limited. Whereas survivors, they have to play in third person so that they have more of

369
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:31,080
a view. It's very interesting. So I've been learning a lot about how the perks work and

370
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,000
I don't know. I still think I would have a more fun time with, with killer.

371
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,760
You just have to find one that works for you. There's probably one with motion that works

372
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:44,440
better for you. Uh, but I know that like, the one thing I know is that if I ever play a survivor,

373
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,920
then I'm going to need to have spine chill, I think. Oh yeah. So you know when they're coming?

374
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:55,960
Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I'm learning about it. I can't believe how my husband has really converted me

375
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,480
into a Dead by Daylight fan. I thought this would never happen. And I think some of you listeners

376
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,360
probably thought the same because I'm not big on scary movies, but I think the concept of Dead by

377
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:10,440
Daylight is great. I have a lot of fun with it, so I'll play more of it. But also in my gaming

378
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,840
week this week, I got super distracted by something I wasn't expecting to get distracted with. And that

379
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:21,240
was a, uh, surprise drop, uh, in No Man's Sky this week. They released their 15th patch called

380
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:26,920
Expeditions, uh, which adds this brand new mode to the game, which basically encourages you to

381
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:32,600
start over. Um, which it's like a mode that was made for me. It's, it's most similar to Diablo

382
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:39,720
3's Seasons mode, but this time the gag is that everybody starts on the same planet. Whereas

383
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,720
normally in No Man's Sky, it's very much the opposite. You're almost always alone because

384
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,040
the universe is big. You very rarely run into other people unless you want to run into them.

385
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,200
But this mode is very different. Everybody starts on the same planet and takes a very similar

386
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:58,600
journey. Um, they added to this a whole system where there are Twitch drops, uh, ever since,

387
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:03,960
so Thursday was the first day. So Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, there are

388
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,360
five unique days worth of Twitch drops. And the whole thing has been very motivating for me to,

389
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:14,680
I'm going to stream No Man's Sky. So sure enough, I streamed, I've streamed for the last four days

390
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,440
in a row on my personal channel over at Rob Roberts. And for those that know me and my

391
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,360
streaming habits, that's very unheard of, you know, the fact that I do this show once a week,

392
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:27,640
that's usually about all I can do for streaming. But this mode and this game has really motivated

393
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:32,840
me to do that for the last four days. And I will do one more tomorrow, uh, to cap off the Twitch

394
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:39,720
drops and that, and then I'll probably go back to, to sparingly playing the game on stream, uh,

395
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,240
to finish up the Expeditions mode. Cause I'm having a lot of fun. You have some different

396
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,520
goals, some different things to do, and I'm unlocking things slowly but surely and it's cool.

397
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:55,000
Um, yeah. Mr. Rhizos in chat says, I went back to No Man's Sky and wow, the new expansion is

398
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,160
really good. Yeah. The game, and you know, I'm sure this sounds like a broken record to what

399
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,720
a lot of people are saying online. The game is not what you remembered when it first came out.

400
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,680
It is completely like literally after they did that origins update and the next gen update,

401
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,880
it doesn't even look the same that it used to because they added so much stuff to different

402
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,200
planets. So, um, it is not the game you remember when it first came out. The team has done a great

403
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:21,160
job. Um, you know, uh, keeping that up and going. So, um, yeah, I've been having a lot of fun

404
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,160
streaming it. I've met some new streamers that way. A lot of people that are lurking for Twitch

405
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:29,400
drops and stuff. So it's fun. So, uh, tomorrow's the last day of that, but the expedition will

406
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,480
continue for the next two months. I'm just, I'm not going to stream it every day. I don't have

407
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:39,400
that much bandwidth. Um, especially as hopefully more and more of our real lives return with more

408
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,280
vaccines getting out there. I can actually go and see some people, um, that I haven't gotten to see

409
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,080
for over a year. Um, you know, as long as everybody's vaccinated and all that stuff. So,

410
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,680
I'm not expecting, I can keep the momentum of streaming No Man's Sky every day,

411
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,360
but it's been a fun, fun thing and a fun little diversion. So there is that. And of course,

412
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:03,800
Final Fantasy 14, cause I always play that game. So, uh, there is that. Speaking of vaccines real

413
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,640
quick, before we get into the rest of the news this week, I'm getting my second Moderna shot

414
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:12,440
next week. I don't know if I'm going to have side effects or not. Um, everybody's different. So I

415
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:18,200
may or may not be here for next week's show. Um, I may be here, but only pushing buttons. So next

416
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:22,680
week's show may be a little different. Uh, it all just depends on how my body takes to that second

417
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:28,840
Moderna shot. Um, but you know what? I'm happy to do it. Cause, uh, whatever side effects it brings

418
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,880
better than getting COVID and more importantly, uh, helps to stop the spread of COVID. So I'm

419
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:40,760
all about that. That's for sure. So, and you're doing a duty to society. Yes. And I'm happy.

420
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,840
I'm happy to, um, because duty then a duty. Yes. And, uh, you know, again, the nice thing is

421
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,760
I'm going to be fully vaccinated. Dark soccer is going to be fully vaccinated.

422
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,880
Loki's going to be fully vaccinated. So hypothetically, you know, in, in Mayesh,

423
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,520
we could come together again. Um, I would say, I think this is on last week's show when you

424
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,280
weren't here, dark soccer, I was saying that might be a really nice thing to do. And of course,

425
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,640
everything depends on what does the world look like? What are the numbers look like?

426
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:12,600
What does the County look like? But I was thinking for our anniversary in June, that would be a great

427
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:18,440
time to bring the show back together if, uh, if science allows for it. So cool.

428
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,440
We have to have a talk about certain things. All right. Sounds good. And Oh yeah. And Alan

429
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,680
still isn't vaccinated. So we have to make sure that is, uh, is taken care of too. So yeah. All

430
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:34,040
right. But I'm totally bringing my mic with me. Oh yeah. That yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We'll, uh, we'll

431
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:38,760
look at doing some of those changes. So, well, I'm sorry. Once I upgraded my mic, I'm like,

432
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:45,400
I can't go back. That's understandable. Uh, and I, Alan and I are still looking at possibly

433
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,560
getting a new space. Um, and those conversations are starting to escalate. Like we've talked to

434
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,160
some of the financial ends of things, not to spill all my business on the show, but it's,

435
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:58,440
it's moving. So, uh, stay tuned. We may not, I didn't say we'd come back to this space.

436
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,280
I just said we'd come back together. So we'll see what happens. All right. Moving on. Uh,

437
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:08,120
let's get into some gaming news. Loki, we will start with you. What else is going on in the

438
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:15,880
gaming world this week? So we had X-Box cloud now adding more games. So we just talked about

439
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,240
games past and there's always announcements with stuff being added to that. Well, now we're getting

440
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:28,760
some backwards compatible games being added to X cloud gaming as well. So, uh, some, you know,

441
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:34,520
not a whole lot initially, um, being added to it, but like some definitely good games. Uh,

442
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:41,160
so we have, for example, Banjo Kazooie, Banjo Tooie, Double Dragon Neon, Fable 2,

443
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:47,800
Fallout New Vegas, Gears of War 2, 3, and Judgment, uh, Cameo, Perfect Dark, Perfect Dark

444
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:55,240
Zero, The Elder Scrolls 3, Morrowind. Um, we have also Oblivion, Viva Piñata, Viva Piñata, um,

445
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:04,680
TIP, and also looks like Jetpack Refueled. So those are being added as well. Um, and I guess

446
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,360
more is going to be coming as soon as they get more backwards compatible games working with the

447
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:13,560
service, but that's still pretty cool that they're adding that to the initial offerings that they had

448
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:20,280
already. Um, I can't wait to see what else gets added to it. You know, this has started a whole

449
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,240
conversation about, um, Microsoft kind of embracing backwards compatibility. I think

450
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:30,280
the way many of us wish Sony and Nintendo would do more often, although you can't say they're not

451
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:36,440
doing anything because, you know, Sony does have PlayStation now, uh, Nintendo does have that for

452
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,000
better or for worse, their classics library that you get through switch online and all that. But

453
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,720
I think many people are kind of looking at what Microsoft's doing and going, they're really doing

454
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:50,600
it the best. Like this is, you know, what gamers want. That's, you know, what they're really able

455
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:56,920
to do over there. Although it's also important to point out, um, Microsoft, uh, their entire library

456
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,200
is not backwards compatible. I was just talking about this on the stream today. Somebody was

457
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:06,520
asking questions about it. Um, but, uh, like DDR, you know, a game that we all love, the, uh, Xbox

458
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:12,760
ultra mixes and universe games. So ultra mix from, uh, the OG Xbox and universe from the 360,

459
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,200
those games are not backwards compatible, uh, which is a bummer. They were great. In fact,

460
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:21,080
the ultra mix too, is my favorite DDR mix they ever did. Um, can't play it backwards compatible.

461
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:25,320
Um, so that's a bummer. I don't know if that's a music licensing thing. It shouldn't be.

462
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,640
I don't know if it's the music licensing thing, but I don't know how much of this,

463
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:35,320
you know, it's probably also up to like, say the publisher as well, whether these games get put on

464
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:40,600
there. Oh, so we need Konami to agree to something. I see. I'm wondering if that might be some of the

465
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,600
case with that. Cause if you think about it, if they're re-releasing it again, then I mean,

466
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:49,080
it wouldn't necessarily be re-released, but like you'd have these games being able to work again.

467
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,840
And also maybe it might be a problem with, you know, not having support for these older

468
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,480
dance paths and stuff. Although I think that the Xbox is pretty good about,

469
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:02,040
you know, supporting, especially a lot of those physical USB devices. Um,

470
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:06,840
Bobby is pointing out no games with specialized controllers are backwards compatible, but

471
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:13,400
DDR didn't require the dance pad play button, button revolution. Um, you know, obviously it

472
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,320
kind of defeats the purpose of the game, but there were many people that were quite satisfied just

473
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:22,040
playing button, button revolution. So there's also people that were, you know, if, if they really

474
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:28,040
wanted to play those games on there, I mean, they would find a way to modify something to get it to

475
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,920
work with the Xbox. Yeah. They would modify a controller, hook it up that way. So I don't

476
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:37,640
think that would necessarily stop people. Yeah. And the game, the game would actually like,

477
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:42,120
I remember when you play the Xbox one online, it would actually show if you were on a controller

478
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:47,160
or a dance pad and some people would hack it to make the controller show up like dance pads and

479
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,880
all that silly stuff. But they knew that controller was a way you could play it. And so they did kind

480
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:58,600
of embrace that, I suppose. So did any of those games support connect? Because I know that's

481
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:04,360
a thing that wouldn't be supported, obviously. Well, itoy was a thing. I remember that.

482
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:10,600
I remember that. Yeah. I don't remember if connect was a thing in one of the later universe games or

483
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:16,600
not. Um, I, I don't know if you, uh, Bahmani nerds in chat remember that clearly. Um,

484
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:25,400
maybe not. I don't remember, uh, orange ride and chat points out licensing issues with the licenses

485
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:30,520
and some Konami originals, Konami, Hawaii, no longer existing DDR pads, not compatible.

486
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,400
That's a good point about Konami. Hawaii isn't even around anymore. Unfortunately. Uh,

487
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:42,600
they were a great, uh, division and we miss them. Um, so yeah, I thought one of the later universe

488
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:48,600
is supported connect, but I could be wrong because I think instead Konami did that spinoff series.

489
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:54,520
Remember that had the two pair of songs in it. Um, dance, dance evolution. That was, yeah,

490
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:59,240
dance evolution. Yeah. Orange right says beaten groovy is backwards compatible.

491
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,200
Gross. They should un-backwards compatible it do us all a favor and say, you know,

492
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:09,640
we've decided to remove this from backwards compatibility. So there is that is rock

493
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:16,200
revolution. Good backwards compatible. Oh, the rhythm, the rhythm party. There was another,

494
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:24,760
there was a D download game that was also, um, connect and that's all I remember. Hmm. Yeah.

495
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:31,000
All right. Anyway, enough about that. I don't know how we got onto DDR from Xbox cloud gaming,

496
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,160
but you know, eh, it's a, it's a series we we've loved for a long time here at OLR. What can we

497
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:42,200
say? Uh, act deaf. I'm so with you. You know what I miss rock band blitz 100%. Probably. I almost

498
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,040
want that game to be backwards compatible more so than anything else we've just talked about.

499
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:51,400
Um, especially with the large rock band library I've accumulated over the years.

500
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:58,360
It's unfortunate. All right. Uh, anyway, let's move on. And, uh, some confirmation came in on

501
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:04,120
something we had talked about being a rumor just last week. Uh, but it is true. Sony is going to

502
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:09,080
be closing the PlayStation three and the Vita stores. Um, and that is all going to be, uh,

503
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:15,160
starting in July. Um, and so, uh, the PlayStation three online store will be closing on July 2nd.

504
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,800
The Vita store will be closing on August 27th. Um, you are not going to be able to

505
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:25,960
purchase digital media from those stores. However important you can re download anything you've

506
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:31,080
already purchased. My excuse me, my assumption is that would include PlayStation plus titles

507
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:36,920
for what it's worth because you kind of bought those. So, um, there is a FAQ that gets into some

508
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:43,000
detail. The first one says you will still be able to re download and play previous purchase games,

509
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,160
as well as video and media content. You can still redeem game and PlayStation plus vouchers.

510
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:54,040
You can still re download and play game claimed game titles through PlayStation plus,

511
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,080
like I was mentioning there, as long as you remain a member of the service,

512
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:02,200
but you will no longer be able to purchase content, including games and video content.

513
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:09,080
You can no longer make in-game purchases. So any DLC you want, you better get it. And you will no

514
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:13,560
longer be able to redeem PlayStation network, wallet fund vouchers on PlayStation three,

515
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:18,520
Vita or PSP devices, but you can do that in a PlayStation four or PlayStation five.

516
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:25,800
So that's it it's going away. And to kind of follow up with that conversation on who's doing

517
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:31,720
backwards compatibility better. I think some of the sad news there is that the rich library of

518
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:37,400
PlayStation one games that you could download on the PlayStation three is going away. And I think

519
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:43,800
of things like Suikoden one and two, right? Those games were known as PlayStation collectors items.

520
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,840
It was a big fucking deal when those showed up on PlayStation three. And now people are no longer

521
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:54,760
going to be able to buy them anywhere. They can re download it. But if you don't claim that to

522
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,960
your cart, you know, in the next few months, you you're not you'll have to try to find it's

523
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,360
going to make the physical copies go up again in price, I'm sure. But, you know,

524
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:12,680
that's just some of many examples. So. Unfortunate that that is closing, but at the same time,

525
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,840
it's a reality of the digital storefront, right? Like we knew this was going to happen eventually.

526
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:24,600
Someday, the PlayStation four shop will close the Xbox one. It's we're all kind of surprised.

527
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,320
Wii U hasn't closed yet, although it's probably I think it did in other countries. So I think this

528
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:35,320
came up on another show and hasn't as not quite happened in America yet. S.J. 100 Mountain Chat

529
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:40,040
says it's like who is doing game preservation better? Microsoft gets it. I wish Sony did.

530
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,480
You know, there was a very interesting comment or might have been a headline on one of the big game

531
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:52,280
blogs that said something like Microsoft should be doing their own version of Sony's video on

532
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:57,640
this is how easy it is to trade games. You remember that E3? You remember that E3 when Sony

533
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:01,880
pretty much punched Microsoft in the face on stage with all their videos and their very

534
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,760
tongue in cheek thing. And it was like, here's how to trade a game on PlayStation four. And they go

535
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:11,160
and they hand the game because it was when that whole conversation about digital only was

536
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:16,760
happening and Microsoft was losing that battle. That's for sure. Some are arguing that Microsoft

537
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:21,240
should put out a response video now about backwards compatibility. Like here's how you

538
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:26,840
play an old title on your Xbox and just drop the disk in. So, yeah, maybe they will. I mean,

539
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:31,160
it also, I don't really know how that necessarily helps them aside of

540
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,000
getting it spread around through social media. I mean,

541
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:42,280
I don't know. Yeah, it'd be fun to see that happen. But now's all the time to do that.

542
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,400
Bobby is reminding us to that whole video got the crowd going because it was five minutes

543
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:52,200
before they announced they were charging for online play. That was brilliant. Nobody noticed.

544
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:58,920
I think, too, people were well, people were expecting Sony to go that direction, too.

545
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:04,040
I think everybody was kind of surprised Sony wasn't, but Sony definitely softened the blow

546
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:08,600
with that. You know what I mean? And I think also the other big deal they came in and announced

547
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,440
their console was one hundred bucks cheaper. That was the other huge deal that they were talking

548
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:18,920
about right before that whole thing. So there's that. So. All right. Anyway, let's move on. Other

549
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:28,040
gaming news. Dark Sakura. Well, you know, hackers going to hack, right? Well, as it looks as it

550
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:35,320
turns out, it looks like hackers are going to get caught, too. So authorities in China seized about

551
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:44,760
seventy six million dollars worth of assets, along with cars and other goods from a. From a company

552
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:49,880
selling cheating software for some best selling games, including Call of Duty and Overwatch.

553
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:58,440
Basically, because e-sports has become such a source of revenue for the country,

554
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:05,800
they're finally starting to crack down on the impact it's having on competitive gaming.

555
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:14,440
So. There I mean, these are companies that like have websites with shopping carts and price lists

556
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:22,920
and customer service. I mean, they're like, you know, Amazon for hackers. So they're bringing in,

557
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:32,360
I mean, some of these people make seven digits. A year. So, I mean, think about that.

558
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,480
It just goes to show how many people want to cheat in these games, too.

559
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:45,640
Yeah, for sure. It's just. I you know, the thing is, is that with this whole situation.

560
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:58,520
I really I mean. I understand why it's attractive to people, because, you know, it's

561
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,640
not everyone is going to have the same reflexes that a pro gamer is going to have,

562
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:11,800
just, you know, facts or facts. Right. I think the the big thing that people need to remember

563
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:21,160
is that it's like doping. Right. Or taking steroids. This is the virtual equivalent of it.

564
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:30,840
And now, while Japan isn't as close to, say, China and South Korea for their e-sports

565
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:41,240
presence, they've had a hotel open called Hotel Ezone. It was open in Osaka and they

566
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:48,360
had people check in, play all the time, but they've already caught three cheaters like

567
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:55,160
right when they opened the hotel. So they're really just cracking down on it everywhere.

568
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,440
You know, especially with a lot of things moving online in this whole situation,

569
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:06,120
I think some people might be cheating to try to get forward in some of the stuff because

570
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,640
some of the cash prizes and things like that. And you don't necessarily have to show up to

571
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:16,120
do it in person right now. So I think that's the comparison to doping is very interesting.

572
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:21,160
That's kind of what it is. It is. I mean, it's basically doing something to give yourself an

573
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:28,840
unfair advantage over the other competitors. And that is all it is. So it's exactly like that,

574
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:37,560
you know. Yeah, but with that, though, I would expect them to handle that within whatever bracket

575
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:43,560
or tournament circuit that they're in and not necessarily... I don't think people should be

576
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:49,000
arrested for cheating. That's kind of weird. But the ones that are being arrested are the

577
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,160
enablers, the ones selling the illegal tools. Yeah.

578
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,000
So basically... Who's saying they're illegal? The game companies?

579
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,280
China. I mean, the laws are different. China? Fine.

580
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:07,000
But keep in mind, esports is managed, I would reckon, very similarly to how professional

581
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:14,040
sports is managed. And so there are certain things that are going to be... And keep in mind,

582
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:20,680
their laws are maybe more stringent than they might be here. But I would think that because

583
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:25,000
it is such a major source of revenue for the country that they do have laws around it.

584
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,560
I would kind of... Well, that's fair. Yeah.

585
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:31,640
Yeah, because I would compare it to like, why did Martha Stewart go to jail?

586
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,240
You know, there was that whole... Because she's a woman.

587
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,720
I don't mean to laugh, but... She's a woman and she got caught.

588
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:45,640
I get it. But on paper, the reason was it was the insider trading and all that stuff,

589
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:51,160
right? Things to do with the stock market. And like here, you guys know that if you do insider

590
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:56,120
trading and that seedy stuff for the stock market, you can absolutely go to jail for that stuff.

591
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:02,120
Well, the stock market is our big money thing. In China, esports... Not to make a direct

592
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:06,760
comparison, but it is a money generating... And what is happening here with this cheat stuff,

593
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:11,720
it's a version, I guess, of insider trading. So I think that's why I'm kind of trying to explain

594
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:16,520
to Loki, I think kind of like what it is and why these folks are getting targeted and going to

595
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:21,080
jail. They aren't arresting the cheaters, as far as I know, anyway. They're arresting the people

596
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:27,320
that are selling these things to enable cheating so that the whole system can be messed with,

597
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:32,280
I guess. Yeah, but that's the equivalent though of like, once again, arresting the gun manufacturers

598
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:38,120
when somebody kills somebody with a gun. Like, I think that they should... Fine. If you're gonna

599
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:43,720
have laws in your country to arrest people developing these tools, then arrest the people

600
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,880
using these tools. I think that they should be arrested then, if that's what we're gonna do.

601
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,000
But if this were to happen, say, in the United States or something like that,

602
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:56,360
I think we have some serious problems, because really, we're having game companies dictate

603
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:03,240
that cheating in an online game is illegal. That's stupid. I get it. That's against terms of service

604
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:07,800
or something like that. But we're gonna arrest you and seize millions of dollars of assets?

605
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,080
That seems a little weird.

606
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:15,560
I don't think anyone would be arrested, but I wanna say we've had stories about civil lawsuits.

607
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:20,920
Didn't we have something where Blizzard sued some people that were making a Warcraft gold farmer?

608
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:26,520
And we have civil lawsuits. So there is a punishment to pay. It's just different, I guess.

609
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,120
Right. And there has to be civil lawsuits because they don't have laws on the books to actually

610
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:35,720
dictate them not to do that. But I guess you could get with reverse engineering copyright theft or

611
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:41,560
something like that. But I think... I guess it being in China, that makes sense because

612
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,840
their laws may be different. But I can't see that happening over here.

613
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,800
No, but I could see the civil thing happening.

614
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,280
Yeah. That's totally different though.

615
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:55,480
Yeah. So, all right. Well, let's move on. Loki, you have the next story.

616
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:02,920
Yeah. So we have Nexon actually investing in some of these Japanese companies.

617
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:08,120
Some of which I don't know if they're... Not necessarily stating that they're planning on

618
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:16,120
acquiring them or something like that, but they've invested $1.5 billion within Konami, Bandai Namco,

619
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:22,280
Sega Sammy, and Hasbro. Apparently, they said that they believe in these companies because they have

620
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:27,000
well-managed global IPs. So it sounds like they're talking about their IPs because I know Konami sure

621
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,720
as hell isn't making any games. At least none recently.

622
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,080
Bomberman. Super duper Bomberman.

623
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:38,200
Bomberman and the shitty Contra sequel that they made.

624
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:49,240
Or Pacheesh slots. I guess there's that too. But anyways, so right now they've invested quite a

625
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:53,640
bit of money into those companies. Like I said, I don't know if they're necessarily hoping to

626
00:56:54,920 --> 00:57:00,600
acquire one of these at some point, but you never know. I guess we'll see. I could see

627
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:06,200
Konami being sold to somebody at some point soon. I feel like we write that fanfic every

628
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:14,280
month on this show about who's going to buy Konami. Because we all want to see those great IPs

629
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:19,960
like DDR, sweet code and Castlevania, Silent Hill, those things they've built up over the

630
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:24,440
years. We want to see somebody do something with them that's not a slot machine. Now,

631
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,680
as much as we joke about Pacheesh slots and slot machines, I think we have to realize that is

632
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:32,520
Konami's business now, whether you like it or not, that's where they're making money.

633
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:36,920
And that's always going to be the thing. But I think there's also like that can be separated,

634
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,600
I think, from the other types of home entertainment, hence why there used to be a

635
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:47,080
case set. And I would think that some of that could get sold off or something. I don't know

636
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:51,240
if Nexon's the company that gets me excited about because that makes me think mobile phone.

637
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,920
Silent Hill sent to be a mobile phone game.

638
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:00,040
Well, Konami's interested in mobile games. They had a lot of them. I mean,

639
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:04,280
I it seems like now they're taking a lot of their like, especially their music games

640
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:08,360
and trying to develop like some sort of subscription service model for like PC.

641
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:12,840
And here's the thing. I'm not knocking mobile games like one thing that somehow didn't make

642
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:16,440
our show world tonight. I don't know how, but I'll bring it up here. We have this whole thing

643
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:20,760
about Niantic put out another demo for AR gaming, right, where people were all fighting in the park.

644
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,960
And, you know, there was it wasn't Pokemon related or anything was like an original thing.

645
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:28,680
And then they showed that they showed that picture of their like the glasses. They were

646
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:33,320
teasing the Niantic glasses and all that. Right. So that's a whole like, you know,

647
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:39,800
are we getting another Ingress? I don't. Well, who knows? Could Ingress be something that is

648
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:44,440
played with the glasses? It's the original concept videos for the game sure made it look like that.

649
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:49,240
But I'm not I'm not even concerned with that right now. My point is, is that mobile gaming,

650
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:55,080
when things are specifically made for mobile is fine, you know, and Niantic is a great company at

651
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:59,960
doing that. You know, that's why Pokemon Go is successful. When mobile, in my opinion, isn't or

652
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:05,000
that game that Dark Soccer always talks about that word scapes that was made for mobile, it was mobile

653
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:11,640
in mind. But when you shoehorn Silent Hill into a mobile phone, it doesn't work. None of those like

654
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:16,840
things that get shoot Sonic the Hedgehog playing it on mobile. It's cute for a minute, but it

655
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:21,800
doesn't it doesn't work. Like so that's that's why I'm kind of like, there needs to be a division

656
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:27,560
there. You know, is the game for mobile or is it not? Anyway. Now Quest Buster is saying in

657
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:33,640
perspective over at twitch.tv slash vog network. Nexon is the third largest gaming company in Asia.

658
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:39,080
Only Tencent and Netease are larger. So that's true. They are a very large company. I guess I

659
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:44,680
can't help but think of that story last week about Final Fantasy 11 going bye bye. But anyway,

660
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:50,920
as she says, when you port, say, Chrono Trigger on mobile, you ruin it. Yes, it's just it's not

661
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:56,440
the same. But anyway, I'm digressing a little bit. So if they're investing in game companies

662
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:01,960
to maybe try to do something, they're investing in a lot of companies. So it's it's interesting.

663
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,640
I don't know if that is to try to push more of that. So I'm just kind of curious what their

664
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,960
long term strategy is here. Is it a lot of money? One point five billion. They probably could have

665
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:15,800
flat out bought one of these companies for that much money, honestly. But they didn't. So we'll

666
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:22,920
see. All right, moving on. So last week we had the stories about Discord and Microsoft. Could

667
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:27,960
Microsoft be buying Discord? Well, we don't know the answer to that yet. But this is a very

668
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:35,800
interesting time to update is that Discord will work on your Xbox Series X. OK, there's there's

669
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:43,240
some catches here. It's not official. What it is, is that the Edge browser that is used on the

670
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:49,480
Xbox Series X, if you may or may not know, the Microsoft Edge browser now adapts some of the

671
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:55,240
chromium technology into it, as in Chrome. Right. Because all that's open source. So a lot of that

672
01:00:55,240 --> 01:01:02,120
is built into Edge now. So the Edge browser on Xbox Series X, if you actually go to Discord

673
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:07,080
with the new tech, you have to get the test build of Edge that has the chromium built into it.

674
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:14,520
If you go to Discord, you can actually use the web based Discord. You can use text chat,

675
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:20,200
you can even join calls, but the mic input won't work yet. So you can't fully participate with

676
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:27,560
Discord. So that is kind of an interesting little thing people are noticing just after we have this

677
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:32,520
conversation about Discord and Microsoft. I'm sure if that were to happen, we would see an

678
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:37,640
official Discord app that runs in the background and does allow you to talk, show up on Microsoft

679
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:44,360
pretty quickly. And I think this just shows how fast that could happen. So if Microsoft does

680
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:50,600
buy Discord, I would expect the week that it's cleared, meaning, you know, the regulators all

681
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:56,600
clear and all that stuff. We have a full on Discord app on Xbox. But again, we don't even

682
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:00,520
know if that's the direction Discord's going. Discord may go with one of their other suitors.

683
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:05,800
I believe we heard Amazon was in the mix. Discord may still go public. This is just one of those

684
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:11,960
isn't that funny slash cute that came up right after the whole talk last week.

685
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:17,640
Dejirom S says it's still on test build on Xbox Series X. I think the browser is.

686
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:23,800
I'm not sure if that actually rolled out to everybody yet. So we'll see. All right,

687
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:28,040
let's move on. Dark Sakura, some interesting E3 rumors, yeah?

688
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:34,280
Yeah, it was floating around that E3 was going to put some of their content behind a paywall,

689
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:46,200
like to have a premium package for $35. But of course, after the statement was issued,

690
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:53,720
ESA actually went back and said, oh, no, the quote says I can confirm on behalf of the ESA

691
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:59,320
that there will be no elements of E3 2021 that will be behind a paid for pass or paywall.

692
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:08,680
That didn't say anything about next year. But they are still pushing toward a digital event

693
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:17,320
this year in light of everything going on. So we're going to wait and see. I mean,

694
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:22,440
I really do hope that it stays virtual for like ever.

695
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:27,320
But I understand what the attraction was to have it in person.

696
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:32,200
It would be nice to have a little column A, a little column B. I would argue that E3 was

697
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:37,160
already virtual for a lot of people. You know, like, you know, I stopped going to the show years

698
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:43,080
ago and there was I distinctly remember there was a year I took the few days off work and just

699
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:48,840
I was I think it might have been actually. I think it was the year it was Bobby's last

700
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:53,560
year at E3, because I don't think we actually went or got in, but I seem to remember I was

701
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:59,240
watching it on TV and then I think you were with me, Jamie. We drove down the last day

702
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:05,080
or I don't know if it was separately or together or what happened, and we like picked Bobby up and

703
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,880
we went to Disneyland. We did.

704
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:13,240
Because I feel like that was the night that we were talking about Vogue and all that stuff.

705
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:16,040
Or maybe that I might be blurring my years together a little bit.

706
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:21,560
I kind of have a memory of that, though. Yeah. But my point is, I remember there was

707
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:25,800
a year where I was home watching it for two days and then I went down there and I was there in

708
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:31,240
person the last day, although I wasn't really in E3. Like I sat in the lobby the whole time and

709
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,960
waited for Bobby or you or something. I don't know.

710
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:40,280
Now, Bobby points out being in person is great for networking. That is true,

711
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:45,480
although I would say a society over the past year has also learned how to adapt some of that

712
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:51,720
to virtual. But not to dismiss the point, because I think there is certainly a lot about in-person

713
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:56,040
gatherings as well. I think the best solution is going to be a mix of both.

714
01:04:56,040 --> 01:05:01,400
But I would argue E3 was already virtual for many people. Most people are consuming E3,

715
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:04,600
the press conferences and everything, media briefings, whatever they're called,

716
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:08,680
Nintendo Directs. We're watching them in the comfort of their own home on their computer

717
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:12,280
and all that stuff. The way people were getting the news out of that was virtual.

718
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:16,440
But the people who needed a network, the people who needed to talk to the retail people to help

719
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:20,440
get the games on the shelves, they were all down there in person doing what they needed to do.

720
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:27,400
But I think it's funny. You kind of made that little joke that they didn't say anything about

721
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:34,280
next year. Maybe there will be a more official half and half thing in upcoming years. Who knows?

722
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:34,920
We can hope.

723
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:44,120
Yeah. I agree that June is a little soon. I still feel like so much is to be determined

724
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:48,360
where this is really going to go and how the variants mess things up and how the vaccines

725
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:52,680
take to it. And I feel like June is when we're going to get the answers to that.

726
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:56,040
And then the rest of the year will play out one way or the other. You know what I mean?

727
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:01,160
Yeah. I think that it's really going to be just a matter of

728
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:09,160
I think vaccination rates and whatnot, if it's going to be safe. Because right now, I mean,

729
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:15,960
we don't have the vaccination rates right now, but it's still going to be free for this year,

730
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:20,360
at least. Yeah. And they're going fast. They hit a new record with vaccinations yesterday.

731
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:24,360
And originally they were talking about a million vaccines a day, and now they're up to 3 million

732
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:29,400
a day. So that's great news. So fingers and toes crossed, because it would be very lovely if

733
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:36,680
come back to school season, we're able to get some sense of normalcy, but we'll see. We'll see.

734
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:42,760
I'm not going to put the cart before the horse. We'll see what happens. All right. So let's move

735
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:52,840
on. Loki, what do you have for us? All right. So Apple Arcade is getting expanded quite a bit.

736
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:58,600
And there is actually some pretty cool games on the list here that are coming out with it. So

737
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:03,240
they have 30 new games. I'm just going to cut you off and talk about Fantasian,

738
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:07,480
because that is the only one that matters, in my opinion. That is a huge deal.

739
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:14,680
Okay. No, there are others. But that Fantasian is like, that's the one that's tempting me. But

740
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:21,800
I did not realize that it was limited. I always thought it was just for the mobile phone. I did

741
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:30,120
not realize that Apple Arcade was something that worked with the Macs and Apple TV. So honestly,

742
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:37,160
if I hadn't just upgraded my watch two weeks ago, I should have bought an Apple TV so I could play

743
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:41,720
Fantasia. I guess I could always do it on this Mac we do the show from. But this is the show's

744
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:48,840
Mac. It's not my Mac. It'll run it with no problem. I'm tempted. I'm tempted. I want to

745
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:53,240
play that Fantasian. But anyway, sorry, Loki. You had something more? I'm sorry.

746
01:07:53,880 --> 01:08:00,840
No. So yeah, they had Fantasian was added in there as well. They have Hotshots. They have a,

747
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:07,640
was it Monument Valley threes? Looks like a Hotshots golf game, or it's a game like

748
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:14,040
Hotshots golf called Clap Hands Golf. But I mean, basically Hotshots golf. As I mentioned,

749
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:23,320
the Oregon Trail, they have NBA 2K21 Arcade, which ironically is probably the best version of NBA 2K21

750
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:28,600
considering that there are no loot boxes in it. So already improved over the console version.

751
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:36,760
And then some other classics of Fruit Ninja, Monument Valley, Don't Starve, stuff like that.

752
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:43,320
So lots of big games coming. And yeah, that's pretty cool. Interesting timing. I would have

753
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:47,800
expected something like this closer to like that holiday season. Not that I'm complaining. I just,

754
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:53,800
it's interesting that this is happening now out of all times in the year. So well, financial years

755
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:59,080
are usually up at the end of March. So okay. I mean, fair, fair. Could be a fiscal year thing.

756
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:06,120
You're right. You're right. Yeah. Okay. Cool. All right. Moving on. Let's talk about the Xbox Series

757
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:13,880
X and the mini fridges that they're making. That is, that is what it really is. So there was some

758
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:18,440
big refrigerators, I think that went out just a couple of them. Yeah. Yeah. It's like a promotional

759
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:23,320
thing some time ago. I remember that was being a thing. Yeah. It's like, I know Snoop Dogg got one.

760
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:29,080
I can't remember who the other two were, though. So here's the thing here. So yeah, this, this

761
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:35,400
caught fire online, the concept of an Xbox fridge. And then it just took the weirdest turn. So Aaron

762
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:43,640
Greenberg with Microsoft promised official Xbox Series X mini fridges if Microsoft won a Twitter

763
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:49,080
brand competition. And sure enough, the gamers came through, they won that, you know, you guys

764
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:56,040
know, like Wendy's, right? And all these brands that, you know, talk like people online. I don't

765
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:01,000
know. All I know is that Steakums was not in the running. And that seems like a glaring omission to

766
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,600
me. I don't know. Or maybe I read the chart wrong. Maybe they were in the running. They just didn't

767
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:10,440
make the finals. I was just very surprised Steakums wasn't there. But anyway, Microsoft was there and

768
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:15,720
they won the whole thing. So Aaron Greenberg is living up to his promise and they will be making

769
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:20,840
Xbox Series X fridges. We don't know when. We don't know how much. We don't know what they

770
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:25,640
look like because we've only seen the big ones that Snoop Dogg got. But we do know the very

771
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:32,360
first one will be going to Skittles, who is the runner up in the competition. And now we know what

772
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:39,720
green Skittles tastes like. Ground up Xboxes. They had some weird like, like, commercial, like,

773
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:47,320
April Fool's jokes. Like the one I saw was it was it 311 and 711 switched Twitter handles for

774
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:53,160
a while. That was kind of interesting. But yeah, lots of lots of weird stuff like that.

775
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:58,040
Well, that was all April Fool's stuff, right? Because, yeah, that happened. I forgot as much

776
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:03,640
as I thought April Fool's Day was canceled during the pandemic because we do not have the bandwidth

777
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:08,200
for April Fool's right now. And it actually seems like for the most part, most companies kind of

778
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:12,760
behave themselves like there was no, you know, like you might have the cute switching of the

779
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:19,480
Twitter accounts. What's his name that's famous for his gap teeth look, lied and said he was

780
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:25,560
fixing it and then it was April Fool's. OK, whatever. Favorite one. Well, aside from the

781
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:29,560
other one I posted, there's a favorite video I had that I posted on Twitter. But my favorite

782
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:36,280
joke, which is actually a product you can download, is micro or it's Microsoft's

783
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:44,600
Minecraft plus and Minecraft plus is a series of screen savers that resemble the Microsoft

784
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:49,800
Windows 95 screensavers. But it's all Minecraft themed. Love it. It's fantastic.

785
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:57,240
Microsoft is saying and Aaron Greenberg, this is not an April Fool's joke. The series X fridges

786
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:04,680
will be happening. So joy, oh, joy. So now you have the place. We're not famous enough to get

787
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:09,320
one. You have the place. Well, we could we could buy one if we wanted. I just you know,

788
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:15,960
there's a lot of things that money could buy. I know. All right. Like I have an actual fridge

789
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:21,480
that has room for stuff in it and it's new. Well, but you could get a mini fridge to put your

790
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:26,760
alcohol in and your weed and whatever else you want to put in a mini fridge. You want to know

791
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:33,080
what's funny? What is it? Midna's cat food is refrigerated because she has the semi semi raw.

792
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:38,120
So is His Highness Smoosh. Yes. Yeah. The fresh pet. I'll go ahead and just say.

793
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,600
And I was joking to Dan because I keep forgetting to put the food back in the fridge

794
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:47,720
that we should just have a mini fridge in the bathroom where where I feed the cat.

795
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:57,720
Brilliant. Yeah, I smart her. DJ Rama says, so you saw what's in Snoop Dogg's Xbox fridge? I

796
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:01,000
Rama, nobody has to look to know what's in the fridge.

797
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:06,600
You don't store that in the fridge. It's Snoop Dogg's brand of wine. Yeah, you don't.

798
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:16,120
And his own wacky weed. Right. Moving on. Speaking of wacky, I love this segment. Every week on the

799
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:21,400
show, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you guys

800
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:26,280
should be checking this game out. But you guys see it on Twitch. And I told you earlier in the podcast

801
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:34,040
it's not a classic game this week. In a 2021 twist, Dark Sakura's making it weird. And she's

802
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:40,600
picking a fucking weird arcade game or a flag. So that is a fucking weird arcade game every month.

803
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:47,160
And this month she's picked the game where I'm like, you you cannot do this segment Dark Sakura

804
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:52,120
and not do this arcade game. This is when everybody thinks of a flag. This is the one

805
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:57,640
they're thinking of for sure. So let's get it out of the way here in April. So that way we get

806
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:02,360
we won't be asking the rest of the year. Where is this?

807
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:06,760
I'm doing the most the most accessible one on my birthday month.

808
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:11,320
A good call. So what is this month's flag for those that may not know?

809
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:17,880
Cho Chabudai Gaishi or Super Dinner Table Flipping.

810
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:28,040
So it's an arcade game developed and published by Taito where you pound your hands on the table and

811
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:38,600
flip it when you're pissed. So now I have to do a little bit of rewinding on this one.

812
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:46,600
It is actually based off of a Japanese idiom that's like the dad flipping the table angrily.

813
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:54,600
And this was even referenced one time by Aonuma Eiji, you know,

814
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:02,680
the Legend of Zelda producer. He said that Miyamoto would sometimes come into the game

815
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:08,040
design teams and disrupt the whole production if he didn't think the game was going well to start

816
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:15,720
over. And Aonuma likened this to the dad flipping the tea table over, you know, putting everything

817
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:22,600
in disarray. But at any rate, the way that this game works is that you start a scenario,

818
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:30,040
you have like a little plastic table in front of you. And you can pound on the table with your

819
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:39,080
hands to get the family's attention and knock things over. But as you get things to fall on

820
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:47,080
the floor, you get more points. And then when this game's timer, 60 second timer, hits the end,

821
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:54,280
then you grab the table and flip it. It has hinges that keeps it attached to the machine.

822
01:15:54,840 --> 01:16:00,520
So you have four different scenarios. You have the dad with his kids. You have a bride at the

823
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:12,840
wedding, a guest at a host club, and a frustrated office worker. But the thing is, is that

824
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:19,560
it really I think would have a challenge as to how such a simple mechanic that you're going to do

825
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:30,360
every time can make it unique for each scenario. And so they did do different things to kind of

826
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:39,880
build up the moment to make it more dynamic as it happened. You know, you have a karaoke while

827
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:45,560
you're table flipping, you know, kind of interesting stuff. And the game itself was

828
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:54,760
actually popular enough to have a sequel, of course, Chō Chabudai Gaeshi 2, where they've

829
01:16:54,840 --> 01:17:00,200
added three more scenarios, including a ghost from a dead man at his own funeral who will turn

830
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:09,800
over his own coffin. Of course, that one was only out in Japan. So the game was released in Japan,

831
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:22,680
fall 2009. It came out worldwide in 2010, published by IGS. And it's funny, it's got

832
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:30,760
some different reviews. But Jim Sterling from Destructoid basically called said,

833
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:38,600
it's basically the best game ever. That is a quote. It was also in 2017, Gerald Lynch from

834
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:45,960
Tech Radar put it on his list of top 50 best arcade games. That it was basically an absolutely

835
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:53,640
crazy concept, didn't deserve to be on the list, even if it wasn't the best game. And so there you

836
01:17:53,640 --> 01:18:04,760
go. It is Chō Chabudai Gaeshi, which translates to super dinner table flipping. All right. Wow,

837
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:09,400
I wasn't prepared for you to be done so fast. I'm trying to do my own snack over here before

838
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:16,040
there's not really too much more to say that. And I'm sorry, the only video that I could find was

839
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:21,080
live video of it. So no, it's fine. I just killed the sound on the one that's playing it. We're

840
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:24,360
looking at the second. So we saw the trailer and now we're looking at the guy who's actually

841
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:30,200
playing it in the arcade. Oh, it just looped back to the trailer video. But yeah, I killed the sound

842
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:34,280
on the trailer because there's too much like a loud arcade. But I think a lot of you guys

843
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:38,120
have probably seen this somewhere because I know a lot of conventions will bring this game in.

844
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:43,800
I know MagFest for sure did the fundraiser where they would set up a real table. But one would say

845
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:48,520
it's inspired by this game where they set up like a real table that you could put plastic

846
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:56,920
wear on and flip for a small fee. So if you were in Northern California, there is one in San

847
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:04,280
Francisco in Japantown Center. Well, if that place made it through the pandemic, I hope.

848
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:15,000
Well, yeah, but if so, there was one there. Of course, I played it a couple of times. It's

849
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:25,320
cute. And then I would just go back and play bishi bashi or popin music. But it definitely deserves

850
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:30,520
to be on the list. You know, I think it's kind of the one that everyone first thinks of this and,

851
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:35,480
you know, Booga Booga. Yeah. All right. Well, there it is. By the way, fucking weird arcade

852
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:40,920
game of the month. Say the name one more time. Our soccer. I'm sorry. Chochabadaigashi or super

853
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:48,360
dinner table flipping. And you said, by the way. By the way, I blame you. Blame me? What did I do?

854
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:55,320
Or maybe Bobby, I should blame. I don't I'm not willing to do Stadia Pro again,

855
01:19:56,280 --> 01:20:02,760
but I did by dead by daylight on it. Oh, wow. And I did get the pyramid head pack

856
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:11,000
and I got the spirit. We're going to we're going to roll that up and blame Alan.

857
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:17,560
This is all Alan's fault. Is Alan still here? Alan, I've I bought in the other room quite

858
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:25,320
a few packs because right now, actually, if you buy the game on on Stadia, like all of the packs,

859
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:31,800
except for the trickster are on sale, like some of them are half price. I don't know if you've

860
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:36,520
been hearing all this, Alan, but you've got me sucked into dead by daylight and now dark

861
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:41,480
Sakura. She doesn't really have a PC for dead by daylight, but she just bought it on stadia

862
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:46,120
so she can play dead by daylight as well. How do you feel about suckering all these people

863
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:52,600
as of recent into playing dead by daylight? I'm an influencer. What can I say? Oh, she got

864
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:57,560
an ego now that she's a big time streamer, huh? I have to say, though, I have to say

865
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:05,480
the one who cinched it for me was Nika. Ah, because I haven't been able to watch

866
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:13,080
either of you play it. And I watched Nika play as a survivor. OK. And when I just saw like the

867
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:19,560
different strategies and whatever, I was like, you know what? I think this I think I will enjoy

868
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:25,000
this, but I definitely after watching some killer playthroughs, even though I would get super

869
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:30,120
motion sick, I already know the characters I think I would like the best. Wait, sorry,

870
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:34,040
before Alan's about to leave you in an errand, I have that. Who is the who is the nurse streamer

871
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:40,920
you love losing color? That's it. OK, losing color. OK, he's on right now. Well, don't I don't

872
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:44,200
care that he's on right now. You're not going to go watch that. You're going to watch this.

873
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:48,520
But and I would say after the show, but no, you're gonna watch Bobby play No Man's Sky after the

874
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:54,680
show. So tomorrow, go. He streams every day. I feel like he's on all the time. He's really good,

875
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:59,400
though. I recommend that guy. He's funny. So, OK. Sorry, Jamie. I wanted to make sure

876
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:03,880
Alan got that out before he left. Well, hey, it's a good thing that I

877
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:09,720
paid for. Well, I didn't pay. I got the free stadium system so I can play it on the TV, too.

878
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:15,000
Yeah. Hey, oh, there you go. Nice. Yeah. All right. Hey, you know what? I appreciate, too,

879
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:19,400
that now you'll be able to you know, we've talked a lot about stadia and there's been a lot of like

880
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:24,360
down talking on stadia. I appreciate that you've kind of taken this plunge. And now I'm hoping on

881
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:29,000
next week's show. You can tell us how your stadia experience has been if you appreciated that you

882
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:37,240
bought the game there or wish you hadn't. Well, I'm really only. Twenty twenty seven dollars in

883
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:47,880
after buying five packs and the game for nine ninety nine. Yeah. So there's that. I also own

884
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:55,400
it on steam. And I have the Geforce thing, too, so I got it there as well. Oh, plenty, plenty of

885
01:22:55,400 --> 01:23:00,760
places to enjoy trying to find a way to get this sucker to work on my Mac without using a visualizer.

886
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:06,200
Make sure you connect your steam and your stadia stuff on the Debbie Daylight site,

887
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:11,560
because that way the cross by works. And so you'll unlock daylight. That's my joke,

888
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:15,400
dead by day. Well, it's not my joke. It's Twitch's joke. Dead by Daylight, Debbie Daylight,

889
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:21,800
because it's DBD. So it sounds like Debbie. Yeah. Oh, I get it. Yeah. So Debbie Daylight,

890
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:26,680
you want to get the connect your two. So that way, those things you just bought on stadia

891
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:31,320
will unlock on steam as well. I already. OK, so I'll have to figure out how to link that.

892
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:37,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, anyway, let's move on. We have some rapid fire news. Let's travel around

893
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:42,760
and check out some other headlines going on in the world. Loki, I think you're first. Yeah.

894
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:48,600
So like we do every month, let's talk about the free stuff you get when you pay for subscriptions.

895
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:57,080
So games of gold this month, we're getting looks like Vikings, Wolves of Midgar. We have

896
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:06,120
Truck Racing Championship and on the Xbox 360 compatible games, Dark Void and Hardcore

897
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:11,480
Uprising. That's that, you know, Contra Contra game. Yeah, that's the better one, though,

898
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:17,800
is better. It's good. It's not like the the last one they release. Otherwise, the rest of those

899
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:25,720
picks. Now, this is where Microsoft is slipping. It's it's really time for Microsoft. I mean,

900
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:30,360
the Contra picks. All right. But the rest are a little they're not exciting. We'll say I'm sorry

901
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:35,080
to those developers. They're not that level of exciting. So this is where Microsoft Microsoft

902
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:39,240
might want to think about sunsetting this. Well, they've been doing this for a while and,

903
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:44,680
you know, it's not always exciting. But hey, you know, it's free game. At least they're giving out

904
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:50,360
four free games a month. You know, is that you can't say the same about Sony, who they're giving

905
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:56,600
away, though Oddworld Soulstorm, which is a pretty awesome game. Days Gone on PlayStation

906
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:03,000
four and Zombie Army for Dead War. And those are your free PlayStation plus games as well.

907
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:12,600
And then we've got this is kind of funny. There is a stonk skin that is going to be available

908
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:19,480
for Fortnite and the skin's name, of course, is Diamond Hands, which is a reference to Wall Street

909
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:25,720
Betts. But it's the stonks mean character that you can now get as a skin. I really get irritated

910
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:32,440
at all this awesome shit Fortnite gets like the Tron stuff is like, you know, it is Fortnite is

911
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:39,800
like this pop culture blender right now. It's it's pretty stunning. Yeah, so that's it's pretty

912
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:49,160
funny. And then they also have a wearable rising orange arrow to that you can get. So. Oh, my God.

913
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:54,840
That was their April Fool's thing. Tiger Claw on chat says the stonks skin to me looks like

914
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:59,800
a crash test dummy for some reason. It kind of does. Yeah. But I mean, that's kind of what the

915
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:06,760
meme looks like anyway. So I mean, it could double as both true. You know, you know which meme I need

916
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:11,080
for when I play Fortnite are the is Epic Games listening. Some of you for Fortnite listening.

917
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:17,000
The meme I need. I need the old guy in the red sweater that is going like this. I don't know.

918
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:25,000
It says guess I'll die because that's me playing Fortnite. So I need the guess I'll die guy in

919
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:30,520
Fortnite. Can somebody make that happen, please? Thank you. Love Rob Roberts. Dark Sakura,

920
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:36,440
what do you have for us in rapid fire news? So Summer Games Done Quick is definitely

921
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:42,520
returning in July and it is going to be online like the the previous ones have been within the

922
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:49,400
last year. And it certainly hasn't, you know, being online hasn't prevented the the contributions.

923
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:56,520
And to be honest, I actually kind of like that a lot of things are going online. Yeah. For it,

924
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:03,320
because it gives more participants a chance to to play in it when they maybe can't fly out or

925
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:08,120
Worldwide. Yeah. And it's kind of lended itself to its own memes, right? Like didn't Lamp come

926
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:14,920
out of this whole virtual thing and that stuff. So, yeah. But at any rate, it will be starting

927
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:27,560
Sunday, July 4th on the GDQ Twitch channel. Nice. Next up, the Dead or Alive series director

928
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:37,640
Shinbori Youhei has left Koei Tecmo. His quote is, as of today, I have left Koei Tecmo Games.

929
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:42,360
I worked on Dead or Alive for 16 years. And while there were times I was pleased, there were also

930
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:47,080
times I was unable to live up to expectations. I would like to take this opportunity to express

931
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:51,720
my utmost gratitude to the many people who have supported and taken care of me. Thank you very

932
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:59,000
much. All right. Tiger Claw in chat talking about the Summer Games Done Quick says the only thing I

933
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,560
miss about this is the audience reaction when they pull up a trick and then the audience reacting and

934
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:08,920
clapping. I can see that. And I think this is another place where I think we hope that the

935
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:14,520
pandemic lessons learned and the new technologies can maybe offer a blended approach moving forward

936
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:18,680
where that might be a great way to fill in some downtime. And I know Summer Games Done Quick does

937
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:22,520
its own thing for downtime right now, like their recaps and things like that. But it might be cool

938
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:26,840
to mix in a little bit of this, especially when you have a complicated tech maneuver going on in

939
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:33,560
person. Maybe, okay, let's go now to our friend in Russia, who's a great speed runner at this

940
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:37,800
game but wasn't able to make the trip out here. Let's do this for the next hour or two while we

941
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:44,360
do a complicated tech setup in person. It would be cool if maybe a blended approach works in the

942
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:49,560
future. I think it would be very, very cool. And of course, our fingers and toes crossed that our

943
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:53,480
pal Bobby Black Wolf will be involved with the Games Done Quick stuff again, although we know

944
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:57,240
nothing at this point. I don't think they've done any of the auditioning or anything like that.

945
01:28:57,240 --> 01:29:01,320
But it's always fun to know some people who are involved with the whole thing.

946
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:05,240
I don't know if we know any speed runners that might be submitting. I don't think Flaco submits

947
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:09,800
anymore for PT. But I don't know if we know anybody that submits for anything else. So best

948
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:15,400
of luck to anybody that's going to be participating in that. And more different things can be showcased

949
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:19,480
that can't be shown at the show like Pump or DDR. Yeah, that's true. You can get that in there as

950
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:27,880
well. Yeah, that's true. That's Super Mario Brothers World 2 that Bobby did had a huge

951
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:34,520
crowd pop. Yeah, they hosted that whole stage where he had to float through the whole damn

952
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:38,040
stage. That would have been a huge crowd reaction. That's for sure. That's for sure.

953
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:42,360
Act Def says Flaco is done with PT speed running as far as I know. I think that is the case too.

954
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:48,040
I think he's got family commitments and stuff as far as I know. And they didn't accept him

955
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:53,160
when he was really pushing for that. But, you know, we'll hope somebody out there listening

956
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:56,920
to OLR is going to be able to participate with the show in one way or another because it's always

957
01:29:56,920 --> 01:30:00,840
fun to know somebody involved. All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release

958
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:08,760
dates. Loki, we'll start with you in the US. Let's see, we have lost words beyond the page

959
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:16,040
on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. As we mentioned, as part of the PlayStation

960
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:23,880
Plus titles, Oddworld Soulstorm is coming out on PlayStation 5 as well as PlayStation 4 and PC.

961
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:31,880
We have Star Wars Republic Commando on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. Then we've also got

962
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:40,680
Island on Nintendo Switch. The Legend of Heroes Trails of Cold Steel 4 on PC and Nintendo Switch.

963
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:49,720
And last but not least, Poison Control on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. I think that's it.

964
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:57,800
All right, let's move on to Japan and let's talk about some of the releases on the Switch in Japan,

965
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:06,680
including WRC 9, Muse Dash, Island, Silver Star Japan Table Games is out on the Switch this week.

966
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:11,800
Is that something like clubhouse games or like a different set of games? Oh, it's like casino

967
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:15,960
games. I get it. Those types of table games. Although I think I see chess. Yeah, I see chess.

968
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:20,280
So it looks like chess kind of mixed with card games, maybe mixed with some casino games there.

969
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:25,240
And I think I see Mahjong as well. So I guess their own little version of clubhouse games of

970
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:30,680
sorts. Although not by Nintendo, that is by Silver Star Japan. So that is all coming out on the

971
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:36,760
Switch this week. Checking out the PlayStation 5, we have nothing this week on the PlayStation

972
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:45,240
5. Womp, womp. But on the PlayStation 4, we don't have anything this week either. It's slowing down.

973
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:50,760
We have Winning Post 9 next week, but we don't have anything this week. So that's it for releases.

974
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:58,440
How about Europe, Dark Sakura? Just a few things. We have on the seventh, we have Destruction

975
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:06,120
All-Stars for PlayStation. On the eighth, we have WRC 9 for Switch. PlayStation and Xbox

976
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:12,120
Mortal Shell Enhanced Edition Deluxe Set. Also in the ninth, Crypt of the Necrodancer.

977
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:17,560
Bladed Fury for PlayStation. And that is it for the week.

978
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:23,640
All right. We're going to do a few more stories, and then we are going to get to your emails,

979
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:30,520
as well as your questions in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network. Meanwhile, Loki,

980
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:35,000
continuing this summer looking very like last summer, right?

981
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:44,280
Yep. So we've got lots of events being canceled and going online. So we've got Tokyo Game Show

982
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:51,960
being canceled for in-person events, but they're doing their online event again this year. That's

983
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:57,080
going to run between September 30th to October 3rd. And then also...

984
01:32:57,080 --> 01:32:58,600
That's out there. That's...

985
01:32:58,600 --> 01:32:59,320
Yeah.

986
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:05,480
But Japan may be... I don't know how fast... I just don't know how fast Japan is vaccinating

987
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:10,600
the public. So the COVID situation may just be different there too. So something to keep in mind.

988
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:16,440
Yeah. And then PAX East is also canceled, but they're planning for an online event in July.

989
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:25,080
So that's something that's going to happen. No word though exactly when in July, but

990
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:29,640
it's unfortunate that we're... Maybe next year.

991
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:33,880
Yeah. Fingers crossed. I'm still trying to be hopeful about things like DragonCon,

992
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:37,560
but it's just one of those... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. That's

993
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:43,160
where my mind is right now. I trust that a convention that big, especially located in

994
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:47,960
the town where the CDC is at and has people that are involved there for their day job,

995
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:51,960
they'll make the right call. And if it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't.

996
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:56,360
So I'm not expecting a SacAnime situation with DragonCon.

997
01:33:56,360 --> 01:34:01,720
That's gross. But honestly, the county is, I think, more to blame for that one, but still,

998
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:05,880
they had to have the event to have the county do the thing.

999
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:09,960
It's one of those things where I think a lot of us are just shocked that that sort of event was

1000
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:16,520
even legal. But that's the problem. It's legal. And that could lend itself to a whole conversation

1001
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:23,320
about, should Spencer gifts be open at the mall? Because it's not that different, but it's whatever.

1002
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:29,000
None of us went because I don't think they had stellar attendance. I'm sure they didn't,

1003
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:35,640
but here's what it is. Anyway, but hopefully the situation is much different in what, five months,

1004
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:42,680
and we can look at this through different lenses as to how these events can happen. And if that

1005
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:47,480
requires people to be vaccinated before they go to events, then maybe. But we'll see. We'll see.

1006
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:50,440
I know there's a lot of controversy when it comes to vaccine passports and all that stuff.

1007
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:55,320
Moving on, let's talk about something less controversial, a game that gets everybody excited

1008
01:34:56,680 --> 01:35:03,240
among us. Although I think that the fever over this game seems to have died down a little bit

1009
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:08,200
on Twitch. I don't see as many people streaming it as I used to, but maybe that's why they're

1010
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:12,600
putting in some new modes. I mean, obviously this game has done above and beyond, I think what the

1011
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:19,080
team ever imagined that it would do. So even if the sun starts setting on this game, I don't think

1012
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:24,280
you could ever call it a failure. Absolutely not. Quite the opposite. It's been one of the craziest,

1013
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:29,560
hugest indie successes in many years. And there's some things to maybe keep that going and bring

1014
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:33,560
this game back up and get more people to play it. There is a big update happening that is

1015
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:40,200
bringing out the Airship map. The Airship map is now available in the game. There are also going

1016
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:45,800
to be some updates that InnerSloth is working on to kind of bring the game up to date with that.

1017
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:51,400
A persistent account system launched with the Airship map and of course new hats, gotta have

1018
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:57,560
new hats, launched with the map as well. Some other changes coming up in the future, 15 player lobbies.

1019
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:03,720
So if you thought the game with 10 players was crazy, just wait, we're going to have 15. And

1020
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:08,840
they're talking about a revamped art style. Marcus B, who is a artist over at InnerSloth,

1021
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:14,520
completely updated the visual assets, cleaning up lines, having animations cleaned up a little bit.

1022
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:20,520
So they're promising that that will be out soon. InnerSloth also talking about a roadmap for the

1023
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:25,720
future and kind of keeping the community up and up on what's going on with the game. So that's that.

1024
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:32,520
ActDeftInChat says, I like Among Us, but nobody I know wants to play it. So all right, I get the

1025
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:37,880
hint. We still need to do that Among Us stream at some point. We always talk about it, but we just

1026
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:42,600
haven't done it yet. So soon, trademark. All right, moving on, DarkSagra.

1027
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:53,560
So I thought this had already been done, but apparently it's more money. So there was a

1028
01:36:53,640 --> 01:37:02,520
nearly perfect copy of Super Mario Brothers for the NES and it is since sold for $660,000 at an

1029
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:20,760
auction. It was a 13 bidder event. And out of all of this, the original owner got $550,000

1030
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:31,720
for that auction. This one apparently had 11 different box variants for the original

1031
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:37,080
Super Mario Brothers. And this was one of the earliest shrink-wrapped versions of the game

1032
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:47,640
that you could buy in the US. So it was done by Heritage Auctions. So I guess they got whatever

1033
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:59,560
their cut was. But it sold for more than the Nintendo PlayStation. There was that pristine

1034
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:07,480
Super Mario Brothers 3 that went for $156,000. So goodness, the money.

1035
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:10,840
And it's funny because I've seen a lot of people kind of replying to this story going,

1036
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:16,040
I still have a copy of Super Mario Brothers somewhere, but it's a little bit more than

1037
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:20,920
just a copy of the game. It is the particular pressing of the game. And like Darsagra was

1038
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:24,280
kind of talking about, there was all these different variants of Super Mario Brothers.

1039
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:30,760
And these early, early ones are the way that they were, I think it's something to do with the

1040
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:36,520
back of the box when you're a particular way or the way the box is put together kind of makes

1041
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:40,920
it special and a little more rare. It's like a trading card with a misprint sort of thing.

1042
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:46,920
Yeah, yeah. So just because this sold for what, two thirds of a million dollars,

1043
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:51,480
something like that, doesn't mean that your copy of Mario Brothers and Duck Hunt is suddenly worth

1044
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:55,720
a lot of money because the Mario Brothers Duck Hunt cartridge really isn't worth a lot

1045
01:38:55,720 --> 01:39:01,320
because everybody got that with their NES. It's this particular version when not everybody got

1046
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:05,720
Mario Brothers with the console. Remember, they sold the Nintendo by itself in the beginning,

1047
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:11,080
and then they also had a pack with Rob the Robot. That did not come with Mario Brothers.

1048
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:16,120
The Rob the Robot pack came with Stack Up and Gyromite, right? Or something like that.

1049
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:23,080
Yeah. So there was a reason to sell Mario Brothers separately. But a lot of people,

1050
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:26,920
I think, reading the wrong thing out of this headline where my copy of Super Mario Brothers

1051
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:31,720
must be worth a lot of money. Probably not, unless you happen to still have it in a box,

1052
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:36,920
just the way you bought it. All right. Exactly. Let's move on. Loki.

1053
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:48,280
All right. So this is pretty cool. We've got. Well, I'm looking forward to the analog pocket.

1054
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:52,840
Unfortunately, I'm going to have to wait for a little bit longer because it's been delayed.

1055
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:58,040
So it was delayed. I don't remember the original release date. I think it was in the spring,

1056
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:05,480
though, but it's been delayed now to October 2021. And basically saying that there's sudden

1057
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:11,960
and severe electrical component shortages, which is definitely a thing. And logistical issues have

1058
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:18,280
led to a domino effect that challenges everyone in the industry. And they're sorry that it happened.

1059
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:23,560
But apparently it's a component shortage issue, which I know just hearing from other stories,

1060
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:27,080
especially with like, you know, I mean, everything, I mean.

1061
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:29,240
Yeah. And television was supposed to release yesterday.

1062
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:39,320
Yeah. Yeah. So it's it's to be expected, I guess. But hopefully there will be enough

1063
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:43,560
product available when it does come out, because I know that the NES one you cannot get anymore.

1064
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:47,720
Unless you're willing to spend like eight hundred dollars, which no one is.

1065
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:53,240
No. Why would you do that? Yeah. And obviously those same tech shortages

1066
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:58,120
are affecting things like PlayStation fives. Video cards are the other like huge. It's all

1067
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:05,480
the things the scalpers are buying up like crazy. Yeah. Yeah. S.J. one her mat in chat says analog

1068
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:12,440
pulls off its mask and it was really Nintendo all along. But it's a joke about being unable to make

1069
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:19,000
anyway. But yeah, component shortages actually having a short like a real shortage based on

1070
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:24,280
like facts and shorting something that there's literally infinite copies available for it.

1071
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:31,000
You know that there's a difference there, you know. Yeah. But but Nintendo wanted to kill Mario.

1072
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:36,840
So, you know, they waited until March 31st to do that. How sad for Mario having died this week.

1073
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:42,360
It's tragic that we lost an icon. All right. Anyway, one more story for you guys. And this

1074
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:47,000
is about an April Fool's joke coming true. But this is the good kind of April Fool's joke coming

1075
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:55,400
true. So I think it was last year Platinum Games announced as a joke Soul Cresta. It was a classic

1076
01:41:55,400 --> 01:42:01,080
shoot them up spiritual successor of sorts to Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta. Those are games that

1077
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:07,960
have been out previously. Guess what? Soul Cresta has now been confirmed as real. So it's gone from

1078
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:13,880
April Fool's joke to it's going to be the first entry in the neoclassic arcade series. It will

1079
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:20,040
be out on PlayStation 4, Switch and PC. There was a new announcement trailer that came out this week

1080
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:25,240
with Now in Development at the end. And just so you wouldn't think it was an April Fool's joke,

1081
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:31,960
again, Platinum Games themselves tweeted out on April 2nd. Soul Cresta, the first title in

1082
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:38,520
Platinum Games neoclassic arcade series is coming in 2021 to Nintendo Switch, PS4 and Steam. It's

1083
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:44,040
not an April Fool's joke anymore. It's really happening to, of course, where everybody on

1084
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:52,040
Twitter instantly replied, where is Bayonetta 3? Right. That's why don't read replies on Twitter.

1085
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:59,960
Sometimes I don't read replies to my own tweets. No, I'm kidding. I do read them. Whether you get

1086
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:07,800
blocked for them is another thing. No, not anybody here at OLR. But yeah, don't read replies to

1087
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:14,280
corporate accounts because they're always crazy. So going back to the last story a little bit about

1088
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:20,280
shortages. Shane is in our chat, Shad Starzik, saying shortages in something or other pushed my

1089
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:25,800
Hades vinyl from this month to December. Yeah, that's right. That was another delay. I remember

1090
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:31,560
hearing him complain about that last night on Discord. So he's got that. So I didn't think

1091
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:36,120
there was a shortage of vinyl. But whatever it is they used to make records, they've got that as

1092
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:41,960
well. Probably all the factories making other stuff right now. So. All right. Well, that is all

1093
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:46,600
the news we had scheduled for tonight. We'll get to some last minute stories here in a moment. But

1094
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:51,560
I also want to check if we got any email. I don't remember if we have any or not. We do. Yay. Let's

1095
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:55,880
get to it. Mail. Excuse me. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us

1096
01:43:55,880 --> 01:44:01,320
an email. So Dark Soccer is going to. Actually, no, wait a second. When was the 26th? Yeah,

1097
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:05,880
never mind. You guys would have already read this and someone doesn't clean the email box out.

1098
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:11,320
And that. Okay. So we don't have emails tonight. No email. All right. So guess what that means?

1099
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:15,880
We would usually talk about Drag Race, except I haven't been staying current. I've kind of

1100
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:21,160
fallen out of the habit. I know it's so much of it and I'm just I'm kind of over it. This is the

1101
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:28,760
first season, though, that I've actually been excited about. Yeah. It's really good.

1102
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:35,880
Is it over next week? Because we're down to the top four, right? I mean, I may not watch it,

1103
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:42,840
but Twitter watches it for me. You got to catch up. It's gotten so good. Is next week the last

1104
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:50,280
episode or is before the top before the top three? Well, but are they doing that with the whole

1105
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:56,040
pandemic and everything? I don't know. I honestly, I don't like the whole top three thing.

1106
01:44:56,920 --> 01:45:01,640
I like when they do the lip sync, right? And they have the winner of each lip sync,

1107
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:06,200
and then the two winners sink against each other and actually earn that last crown.

1108
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:11,560
That's what I like. I wish that would stay that way.

1109
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:14,600
Obviously, they're not going to do it in front of an audience, but are they going to maybe bring

1110
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:21,560
them back? Because technically, LA County is in orange tier as of Monday. So their restrictions

1111
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:26,600
are really so they could bring they could actually technically, they could probably get away with

1112
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:32,280
bringing in an audience for it. They probably won't. And if they do, it'll be made up of,

1113
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:40,920
you know, friends of like guests of the contestants only. But I'm curious if they'll

1114
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:44,360
even do it or if they'll just do an empty studio and do a finale that way. I don't know.

1115
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:51,640
I honestly think that they should just have like a very, very small venue type thing or, you know,

1116
01:45:51,640 --> 01:45:57,640
like a little tiny studio thing and just record it like maybe back at, you know, like clear out

1117
01:45:57,640 --> 01:46:04,280
the workroom, right? Have them, you know, make sure that they're either vaccinated or have been

1118
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:12,280
quarantined and bring them to do their lip sync in or maybe they could just do it on the main stage.

1119
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:17,960
Yeah, I don't know. Well, they've probably torn down that studio because they actually

1120
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:22,600
rebuild that whole set every time they film. And that's why you've been seeing more like All Stars

1121
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:27,640
and the regular show back to back is because they just recycle the set. But they tear it,

1122
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:33,160
they shoot other things in that space when Drag Race isn't filming. So they will probably run a

1123
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:37,160
theater like they've done. It's just the question is, will they sell the seats? Will they recruit

1124
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:41,480
people for the seats or will it just be guests of the queens? Or are they just gonna do a virtual

1125
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:44,440
again like they did with last season? Rent another studio is what I'm saying. Rent another

1126
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:49,720
studio. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Because then, I mean, number one, it's less than probably

1127
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:53,720
renting a full theater. You don't have to deal with crowds and you only have to light a certain

1128
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:59,160
small area. Well, or is it? Because the theaters aren't doing anything right now. So they'd probably

1129
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:03,880
welcome the shoot. Who knows? Who knows? I don't know. We'll see. Yeah, we'll see. Anyway, okay,

1130
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:07,800
so Drag Race talk when we don't get emails. Participate at orangelandtrader.com is the

1131
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:13,560
place to send us emails for a future show. One last thing. Yes. I no longer hate Candy,

1132
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:18,840
and in fact, I love her. The saddest thing about, maybe that's why I'm not watching as much.

1133
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:24,600
You're not gonna be able to see these girls tour for another year. So it's kind of sad. Also,

1134
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:31,640
the one I really liked, Utica. Uh-huh. I liked her too. Don't like her at all after the roast,

1135
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:37,400
but I'm still team Gottmik. But you know producers told her to do what she did.

1136
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:45,720
It's reality TV, darling. Yes. But anyway, I'm still team Gottmik. If anybody who has been

1137
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:52,600
consistently at the top of their game, it's been Gottmik and Rosé. Just saying. I'm still team

1138
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:58,120
Tamisha Iman, and that is the person I'm most looking forward to seeing when she tours.

1139
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:03,240
Well, I mean, like for winter. Oh, winter in my heart.

1140
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:15,560
Hey, I think I can like who I like. All right. All right. I still I'm pretty sure that Olivia

1141
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:20,680
is going to be Miss Congeniality. I haven't been paying attention enough to know who's nice or

1142
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:25,800
whatever. Anyway, let's get to I don't know if we have any. I feel like we got all the news out,

1143
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:28,760
but maybe Loki found some last minute stories he wants to address with us tonight.

1144
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:33,160
There's nothing really major. I mean, it was just a couple April Fool's things. So

1145
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:38,520
Pokemon Sword and Shield, they had an impossible to catch Magikarp.

1146
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:41,800
Oh, I heard about that. That was rude.

1147
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:53,240
And then Remedy did a demake of control. So that was cool. Interesting. Yeah.

1148
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:59,480
Have you heard that rumor? It is a huge rumor. But like, we're not even two hours of show yet. So

1149
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:04,040
this is where I start bringing out the rumors. By the way, if you guys have questions for us

1150
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:08,680
in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, please, by all means.

1151
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:15,400
Epic Games apparently is financing Alan Wake 2. That's that's the latest rumor.

1152
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:22,840
I'm not the biggest epic fan in the world. I used to be back in the ZZT days. I'm not anymore.

1153
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:27,640
I think the stuff they're pulling with Apple is really shitty. But at the end of the day,

1154
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:33,320
I would love to see an Alan Wake 2. So I have no idea if there's any truth to that as well.

1155
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:40,040
But it's certainly interesting to think about. So act deaf talking about the Magikarp event

1156
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:44,840
saying they've done Magikarp events in the past. I have like four shiny Magikarp that I caught in

1157
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:48,440
Shield already. Yeah, I know they did a shiny Magikarp event because I feel like it was early

1158
01:49:48,440 --> 01:49:54,280
on. I think even I have a shiny Magikarp and that's saying something. So I need to do the

1159
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:58,840
Pokemon Go event. I didn't play enough today. And they I didn't even know they were doing another

1160
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:04,440
collection quest. I haven't seen one of those since a dupe. No, it's not a dupe. It's it's

1161
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:12,840
like bunny stuff for Easter. So it's it's a bunny re has the mega evolution. Bunnelby I think his

1162
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:20,360
name is is kind of like the new shiny. And then also the pink stuff that are the eggs, the happy

1163
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:25,080
knee chancy. They're like the egg Pokemon. They're, they're big in this as well to

1164
01:50:27,080 --> 01:50:32,200
act. Defton chat says I finished my shiny mew quest you did I saw the tweets about that

1165
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:39,160
congratulation. I still need like 20 dragon types among other things. So you must have rated a shit

1166
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:46,200
ton of Rayquaza's to finish that or you did some other trick I'm not aware of. So but I know there

1167
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:50,040
were some people that were really pushing the pedal to the metal on the Rayquaza thing to get

1168
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:56,200
their dragon types. I also saw one of my friends here locally Pokemon Go Raider hit level 50.

1169
01:50:56,920 --> 01:51:02,760
And I'm like, dang, that takes dedication. That takes dedication. I just about have the experience

1170
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:11,160
for 44. But I really don't want to play the the PvP stuff. I've kind of been trying to go in.

1171
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:14,600
I like half ass do two of them. And then I'm like, I'm already over it.

1172
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:19,640
So. All right. Anything else? Loki?

1173
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:22,120
No, that's pretty much it.

1174
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:28,280
All right. I guess it was a slower week. What can you say? Not as much going on is,

1175
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:33,720
is Bobby out there? I hope Bobby's ready. I don't know if he was expecting the show

1176
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:39,240
to be done this early, but we'll see. Okay. He says yes. Okay, good. So that's it, y'all.

1177
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:44,200
Thanks for downloading our show, checking us out or watching us live on Twitch. If you like what

1178
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:47,560
you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio, tell a friend or two. Help us spread the word because

1179
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:51,400
we are the show where every gamer has a voice. But if the gamer the voices aren't here to put

1180
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:58,920
out on air, then what can we do? So, yeah, a nice five star review on a place like iTunes,

1181
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:03,480
Spotify, wherever you I know not all sites do reviews, but just a nice word and I social media

1182
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:09,640
share link wherever you found this show would be most appreciated. And then auto hosts on Twitch.

1183
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:14,600
Oh, they're huge. So thank you, everybody that gives us a host on Twitch. We really

1184
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:20,040
appreciate that. If you want to email the show, participate at OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

1185
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:24,600
We will be back next week. I may or may not be here. I have a feeling I will be here,

1186
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:29,400
but I'll only be pushing buttons and then taking a nap. But we'll see what happens. So

1187
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:32,200
next week's show is going to be interesting one way or the other. Tune in for that.

1188
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:37,720
Meanwhile, let's go. Oh, go ahead. For the record, Dead by Daylight works.

1189
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:40,840
Oh, good. Oh, did you get the connection thing going?

1190
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:46,920
Well, I did. I tried to do the connection, but it makes me have to log into the game to do it. So I

1191
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:52,200
actually just opened itself up. Nice. And it looks actually like I'm even going to be able to stream,

1192
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:56,760
but I just have to do a little bit of change to my graphic interface. Nice. Well, then,

1193
01:52:57,400 --> 01:53:01,800
oh, my God. So I think we're looking at our next bonus. Oh, wait, but you want to play killer as

1194
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:05,800
well. Well, maybe we'll figure something out, because I was thinking a nice bonus stream would

1195
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:11,080
be Rob murders his husband on air, but it's all through Dead by Daylight. But he'll need other

1196
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:15,720
survivors to play with. But maybe we can do something where you get to murder him as well

1197
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:22,600
at some point. So we'll talk about that off air. So. All right. Because our chat met the reward

1198
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:27,240
for the second thing. So we're going to have to start thinking of a third reward pretty soon,

1199
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:31,720
although Bobby's also talking about another VHS stream because he has more tapes, lots and lots

1200
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:38,600
of tapes to run. So we'll see. So many tapes. But I really hope. And if you haven't seen the clip,

1201
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:44,440
please look for it. I really hope there's more moments like that Mario statue that was being

1202
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:49,640
voiced live by Charles Martinet, where Bobby was just like turned beet red on his stream when he's

1203
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:54,280
like, oh, my God, I can't believe this is in here, where he's interacting with Mario and Charles

1204
01:53:54,280 --> 01:53:58,920
Martinet is going, it's the TV station, because he thought Bobby was with the TV station. He

1205
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:04,280
couldn't hear what station it was. He's like, it's a my TV station. It's really funny. Please

1206
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:10,440
try to look for that clip to which Bobby's protesting in chat. Thank you. As you have

1207
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:17,160
found the clip and posted the link for reference. It's so good, Bobby. Embrace it.

1208
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:22,360
All right. Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night. I'll start with

1209
01:54:22,360 --> 01:54:28,360
my final thought. I don't have a lot a lot, but I will just say, I'm looking forward to getting

1210
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:34,600
my second shot next week. And hopefully in May, getting to hug some people I know IRL again.

1211
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:40,600
And that includes my co-host. That includes some of you out there listening. I just,

1212
01:54:41,320 --> 01:54:46,040
man, it's been over a year and I'm ready for some actual human interaction again.

1213
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:54,920
All right, Rob. To be technical, we're safe. I know. I know. But I can I can push through

1214
01:54:54,920 --> 01:55:01,480
like one or two more weeks. And I'll bring you pie. I do love pie. I've been making mini pies.

1215
01:55:01,640 --> 01:55:04,840
All right. Let's get Loki's final thought. Loki.

1216
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:10,360
My final thought is that I like I said, I'm going to try to get into

1217
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:15,720
streaming again. So look forward to that. Awesome. Awesome. And last but not least, dark soccer.

1218
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:24,360
I'm excited to kill people. I mean, virtually. Nice. And can you shout out your friend who's

1219
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:32,840
streaming? Is she streaming now? It's Sweet Nika. So N-I-K-K-A. I think she's streaming.

1220
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:39,320
Let me just double check real quick. Well, streaming or not, give them a follow.

1221
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:47,400
Yeah. That way you can follow in future week. Yeah. Sweet Nika and Sweet N-I-K-K-A. And she's

1222
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:52,280
still streaming. Nice. Drop that in chat. Okay. That's it. That does it for another week here

1223
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:56,920
at Orange Lounge Radio. Thank you everybody for listening. Thank you. Thank you for your patience

1224
01:55:56,920 --> 01:56:02,840
podcasties with what happened last week's show. This one will go up much faster. Thank you. Thank

1225
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:06,760
you for being here and taking part. Have a great week gaming. We'll see you next time. Hopefully

1226
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:09,800
there's more news to talk about next time. It was a little light this week, but that's what happens

1227
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:15,880
sometimes. Have a great week, folks. I'll see you next time. Bye. You've been listening to Orange
