00:00.000 --> 00:14.520
For all the flak that Microsoft caught for sidelining gaming for additional entertainment

00:14.520 --> 00:18.400
options while launching the Xbox One, it's ironic given that Sony is an entertainment

00:18.400 --> 00:21.000
empire that publishes in every notable medium.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.960
Pair that with a recent drama over their desire for only blockbuster gaming titles and now

00:24.960 --> 00:29.160
a rumored PlayStation Plus video pass and what were we complaining about before?

00:29.160 --> 00:30.840
This is the association my brain has drawn.

00:30.840 --> 00:33.960
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to delve more into

00:33.960 --> 00:36.680
the rumors and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where

00:36.680 --> 00:38.320
every gamer has a voice.

00:38.320 --> 00:45.800
Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:45.800 --> 00:48.040
where every gamer has a voice.

00:48.040 --> 00:54.640
It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again on this Sunday evening, April the 25th of

00:54.640 --> 00:59.200
the 2021 episode number 866 of our show.

00:59.200 --> 01:03.120
My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined as always by my co-hosts.

01:03.120 --> 01:05.720
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:05.720 --> 01:06.720
Hi.

01:06.720 --> 01:07.720
Hi.

01:07.720 --> 01:12.040
And for our Twitch viewers tonight, not the podcast folks because that part gets kind

01:12.040 --> 01:15.880
of like cropped out of the podcast, but we had a new like we have like a little bump

01:15.880 --> 01:20.160
that plays because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock

01:20.160 --> 01:22.760
Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:22.760 --> 01:26.880
And there's a few minutes that takes transition from Bobby doing his show in Atlanta over

01:26.880 --> 01:28.480
to us in Sacramento.

01:28.480 --> 01:32.880
So we have a little like, if you've ever watched a Twitch stream, like a stream starting now

01:32.880 --> 01:36.760
equivalent or stream starting soon type equivalent that a lot of your favorite streamers do.

01:36.760 --> 01:38.840
And we had a new one of those tonight.

01:38.840 --> 01:44.160
We've had one for a while that used like free music that I found on some website and a bunch

01:44.160 --> 01:48.360
of collage pictures of Mr. Smoosh, but we've upgraded a little bit.

01:48.360 --> 01:52.580
I always thought, I did always think it was a little unfair that it was just Mr. Smoosh.

01:52.580 --> 01:56.980
Like I know Smoosh is a lovely cat, but we're all cat owners here at OLR.

01:56.980 --> 02:00.540
And we even don't, don't get, we appreciate a good doggo too.

02:00.540 --> 02:02.820
I just want to make sure the dog people don't get pissed.

02:02.820 --> 02:04.100
We appreciate a good doggo too.

02:04.100 --> 02:05.100
I love a corgi.

02:05.100 --> 02:06.300
I have a special place in my heart for that.

02:06.300 --> 02:11.260
There is a dog in the last picture that we didn't show because Midna was kissing her.

02:11.260 --> 02:12.260
I see.

02:12.260 --> 02:13.260
Okay.

02:13.260 --> 02:15.640
So there, so there's that, but, but we have more OLR cat representation and that was all

02:15.640 --> 02:21.900
done by dark soccer, including the new music was, was you, when's the album drop sis?

02:21.900 --> 02:22.900
It doesn't.

02:22.900 --> 02:27.780
Um, and that, and that music to explain people, um, were saying that they did hear it in some

02:27.780 --> 02:28.780
of my streams.

02:28.780 --> 02:35.780
Um, and there was, there was a little misunderstanding, there was a little misunderstanding.

02:35.780 --> 02:43.100
Um, well, but the thing is, is that, um, I'm really glad to, to offer it up to the channel

02:43.100 --> 02:44.100
instead.

02:44.100 --> 02:50.920
I've made some, uh, some new music for myself and I was gonna do, um, I, my plan for today

02:50.960 --> 02:54.440
was actually to work on my channel trailer cause I'm streaming, you know, I'm trying

02:54.440 --> 02:56.160
to get at least once a weekend.

02:56.160 --> 03:01.600
Um, and I made this like in a world, you know, type of serious music.

03:01.600 --> 03:05.120
I'm like, you get to watch this person suck at dead by daylight.

03:05.120 --> 03:07.240
Um, and I was getting everything ready to do that.

03:07.240 --> 03:08.240
I'm like, no, I hate it.

03:08.240 --> 03:14.720
And then Rob was like, we, we, uh, you know, we were talking about the, the intro, the

03:14.720 --> 03:16.200
pre-intro, I guess for the show.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.200
And I was like, I'll do it.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.200
Yeah.

03:18.360 --> 03:19.360
That still cracks me up.

03:19.360 --> 03:23.360
How that happened is that you sent me that intro, that song and you, it intended to use

03:23.360 --> 03:25.860
it for your channel, but somehow I didn't get that message.

03:25.860 --> 03:30.280
So it was very much a, um, here, Rob, I made this and I went, you made this.

03:30.280 --> 03:31.280
I made this.

03:31.280 --> 03:38.600
Bog made this and so there it is now it's on bog, but, uh, I appreciate you giving us

03:38.600 --> 03:39.600
the song.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.480
You made a new one for your channel and it's just as good.

03:41.480 --> 03:47.480
So it worked out, I guess you just had to, my intro one is actually a looped version

03:47.520 --> 03:56.520
of my first completed song that I did, um, and I would like to do like just more music

03:56.520 --> 03:57.520
like that.

03:57.520 --> 04:02.800
I mean, really right now, I'm not the best like keyboardist, even though for people who

04:02.800 --> 04:10.760
are in Twitch right now, I do have myself a nice MIDI keyboard and, uh, I'm still working

04:10.760 --> 04:11.760
on stuff.

04:11.760 --> 04:16.680
I actually paid for my first, uh, logic plugin and I got the, uh, the synthesizer they use

04:16.680 --> 04:18.160
for the Sega Genesis.

04:18.160 --> 04:22.480
Um, before I get to Loki, uh, there's a very well-timed question in chat that I think we

04:22.480 --> 04:23.480
need to address.

04:23.480 --> 04:29.200
Uh, so going to our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network, SSJ 100, Matt says, serious

04:29.200 --> 04:30.200
question.

04:30.200 --> 04:33.880
Could we say drop pet photos in the subscriber chat for it to be added to the photo roll

04:33.880 --> 04:38.240
roll if it's somehow changeable, Jamie, I think we have an answer for that.

04:38.240 --> 04:39.240
Yeah.

04:39.240 --> 04:42.840
Um, I was actually, we were talking about this before the show, but I would love to

04:42.840 --> 04:51.420
have, um, some submissions, um, in the chat is one thing you can private message me your

04:51.420 --> 04:55.000
pictures instead, because I check chat kind of infrequently.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.480
Um, so I'll set up a Twitter thread at OLR, Jamie, and I can just send you the pictures

05:00.480 --> 05:01.480
that people post.

05:01.480 --> 05:02.640
I think that's probably the easiest way to do it.

05:02.640 --> 05:06.360
We'll do a Twitter thread at OLR and for people that are anti Twitter, then they can reach

05:06.360 --> 05:08.360
out to you directly.

05:08.360 --> 05:11.800
Uh, honestly, Twitter is going to be difficult for me.

05:11.800 --> 05:12.800
No, no.

05:12.840 --> 05:15.680
I can, I can pull it all down from Twitter and send to you one big file.

05:15.680 --> 05:16.680
Yeah.

05:16.680 --> 05:17.680
Yeah.

05:17.680 --> 05:18.680
Then that works.

05:18.680 --> 05:19.680
I just need to know.

05:19.680 --> 05:27.320
Um, like if you have the picture in the picture title, put your name and your cat's name.

05:27.320 --> 05:30.840
That's what I want the picture to be labeled so that I know who's is who's.

05:30.840 --> 05:31.840
Awesome.

05:31.840 --> 05:35.360
So, um, yeah, that, and what you guys saw tonight was the first version of that anyway,

05:35.360 --> 05:38.600
because, um, there was a, there was a booboo we're not going to highlight, but Jamie has

05:38.600 --> 05:39.600
to fix it anyway.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.160
So we're going to add more, uh, add more pictures.

05:42.160 --> 05:45.200
Yeah, it's not a big deal, but we were, the plan was to add more stuff anyway.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.200
All right.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.840
Anyway, uh, enough talk about something that podcast folks don't even see.

05:48.840 --> 05:53.440
I'm sorry, but I hope you will check out the archive sometime at twitch.tv slash vog network.

05:53.440 --> 05:56.720
Um, you do have to be a subscriber to see the video feed completely.

05:56.720 --> 06:00.600
Um, but there's a lot of clips, like, uh, people have been clipping parts of the show.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.960
There's, there's a lot that you can just kind of look at for free anyway.

06:02.960 --> 06:05.360
Um, and then make it available somewhere.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.360
Yeah.

06:06.360 --> 06:07.360
Who knows?

06:07.360 --> 06:08.360
Who knows?

06:08.360 --> 06:09.360
Anyway.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.360
Um, so say hello as well to tech master Loki.

06:10.360 --> 06:11.360
Sorry, Loki.

06:11.560 --> 06:12.680
How are you doing?

06:12.680 --> 06:13.680
I'm doing good.

06:13.680 --> 06:16.480
Um, now did I, what, what is running behind you?

06:16.480 --> 06:18.360
Because I swear I saw your own name in that.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.360
What is going on here?

06:19.360 --> 06:20.360
Loki.

06:20.360 --> 06:21.360
That is my own name.

06:21.360 --> 06:28.600
This, this is, uh, the only historical evidence of the greatest gameplay ever, ever I've ever

06:28.600 --> 06:29.600
experienced.

06:29.600 --> 06:33.840
So this is actually on our, um, orange lounge radio, uh, YouTube page.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.480
It's a short sighted.

06:35.480 --> 06:36.480
Yeah.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.840
So this is, um, we have an updated, I just want to point out.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.880
I think that's the last thing that's gone on the orange on your YouTube page.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.800
It hasn't been updated in like 10 years.

06:44.800 --> 06:45.800
Okay.

06:45.800 --> 06:48.520
Like the orange on your YouTube page is kind of a relic at this point.

06:48.520 --> 06:51.640
You want to see how cute we were in our early thirties and late twenties.

06:51.640 --> 06:53.960
Go to the OLR YouTube page.

06:53.960 --> 06:54.960
It's all there.

06:54.960 --> 07:01.360
But yeah, so it, it's a evidence of the modded grand theft auto games, uh, grand theft auto

07:01.360 --> 07:05.480
four games we used to play on Xbox three 60 with my coworkers.

07:05.480 --> 07:12.680
And I seriously have not experienced a more fun version of any game except for that.

07:12.680 --> 07:17.760
And then they patched it out of course, and hadn't played a regular game, which is still

07:17.760 --> 07:23.280
fun, but it's, it was, it's not as, not as fun, as crazy as just everything that you

07:23.280 --> 07:24.280
see in the video.

07:24.280 --> 07:28.080
So, um, that's, what's running behind and I'll probably switch it up to the other short

07:28.080 --> 07:31.240
I have as well with the evil swing set.

07:31.240 --> 07:34.800
How long until grand theft auto six Loki, how long do you think we're going to be waiting

07:34.800 --> 07:35.800
there?

07:35.800 --> 07:36.800
I don't even really play five.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.760
You know, um, I really got out of that.

07:38.760 --> 07:42.920
I finished the single player campaign and then it's all been grand theft auto online

07:42.920 --> 07:45.560
updates and I just haven't gotten into it.

07:45.560 --> 07:46.560
It's such a grind.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.320
Um, it's just not really fun.

07:48.320 --> 07:50.880
Um, some of the races though and stuff look pretty cool.

07:50.880 --> 07:56.200
I used to watch this YouTuber Ali 43, he used to do a lot of the different races and things

07:56.200 --> 07:57.200
that you can do online.

07:57.200 --> 08:02.600
So there's some fun there, but I just, I don't know, I play Minecraft, so I haven't really

08:02.600 --> 08:07.400
gone back to five, but when six comes out, yeah, I'll, I mean, I'll definitely pick it

08:07.400 --> 08:08.400
up.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.400
I'm going to our chat.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.460
Dark Tetsuya says, I got five for free.

08:11.460 --> 08:13.920
So grand theft auto five for free on Epic.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.560
Wondering if I should install it.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.160
Well, yeah, it's a great game.

08:17.160 --> 08:18.160
Yeah, absolutely.

08:18.160 --> 08:22.000
I mean, if you haven't played through it, you should, it's just, I don't know.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
I liked four better.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.380
I liked like the open world stuff's fine, but like the way they set up the online matches

08:28.380 --> 08:33.300
and stuff, I liked it so much better because they kind of put you into a section of the

08:33.300 --> 08:35.860
map and you fought it out there.

08:35.860 --> 08:41.260
It's not like this big, I don't know, open world thing where you can do races and stuff

08:41.260 --> 08:42.260
like that.

08:42.260 --> 08:44.540
I just like it more structured kind of like Call of Duty or something like that.

08:44.540 --> 08:48.660
Well, I guess Call of Duty now is a big, you know, battle arena stuff.

08:48.660 --> 08:53.400
So, um, but like the more traditional like Call of Duty type of stuff where it's, it's

08:53.400 --> 08:58.220
a, a level or an arena granted the whole map is open, but they only put weapons as small

08:58.220 --> 08:59.860
portion of it.

08:59.860 --> 09:04.600
And so I really liked that kind of setup where it's more structured like that, but now it's

09:04.600 --> 09:09.340
just like, well, you know, you can have a death match over here or over here.

09:09.340 --> 09:12.220
And then, I don't know, it just wasn't as fun.

09:12.220 --> 09:13.500
I don't know what to say.

09:13.500 --> 09:20.980
It's hard to go back when you have, you know, Uzis that shoot, um, grenades and it just

09:20.980 --> 09:22.500
explosions everywhere.

09:22.500 --> 09:27.900
And then there's planes flying down close to the, you know, road and just flying cop

09:27.900 --> 09:33.380
cars with nuclear shotguns or suitcase bombs and stuff, all this modded stuff that we put

09:33.380 --> 09:34.380
in there.

09:34.380 --> 09:36.380
And it was just so amazing.

09:36.380 --> 09:40.860
Bobby Blackwell also points out that Grand Theft Auto five just went back on game pass.

09:40.860 --> 09:42.900
It was gone for a little bit, but it just came back.

09:42.900 --> 09:44.620
That was some, a recent headline.

09:44.620 --> 09:47.940
I do want to point out though with Dark Tetsuya's question, even though we're kind of sitting

09:47.940 --> 09:49.380
here going, yeah, install it.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.380
You know what?

09:50.580 --> 09:54.580
There's a very real hesitation and a very real reason to ask that question.

09:54.580 --> 09:57.740
And I'm going to give Dark Tetsuya the huge benefit of the doubt there because I've been

09:57.740 --> 10:02.380
in this very similar situation and it is those fucking bandwidth caps.

10:02.380 --> 10:06.060
And if you don't have to deal with those through your cable provider, congratulations.

10:06.060 --> 10:07.060
Good for you.

10:07.060 --> 10:08.060
You are lucky.

10:08.060 --> 10:09.060
You are.

10:09.060 --> 10:12.180
You're very lucky because I'm telling you those bandwidth caps are a pain in the ass

10:12.180 --> 10:16.020
and a game like, um, Grand Theft Auto five is going to be something like, it's gotta

10:16.020 --> 10:18.040
be like 40, 50, 60 gigs.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.040
Like it's pretty big.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.040
Yeah.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.040
It's a big game.

10:21.040 --> 10:24.240
So you really have to think about that kind of stuff before you just go download it.

10:24.240 --> 10:26.960
Um, I think it's a really good game.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.320
It really is like the single player campaign was, it was all right.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.320
I liked it.

10:31.320 --> 10:33.960
Um, but yeah, it's, it's got a good story.

10:33.960 --> 10:34.960
It's fun.

10:34.960 --> 10:35.960
The heists are fun.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.280
Um, I don't know.

10:38.280 --> 10:39.840
There's a lot to do in that game.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.520
It's very like pack full stuff.

10:41.520 --> 10:45.480
And if you really have the patience for Grand Theft Auto line and that could be fun, but

10:45.480 --> 10:46.800
it's just, it's such a grind.

10:46.800 --> 10:51.320
They make it so grindy with like, you have to pay rent for your apartment.

10:51.320 --> 10:56.160
You have to pay rent to have people fix up your cars when they get destroyed by another

10:56.160 --> 10:57.160
player.

10:57.160 --> 11:01.000
Like that stuff is, that's stupid, but I understand why they're doing it because that's where

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
they're making their money.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.100
They're trying to sell their shark shark cards.

11:04.100 --> 11:08.760
So they make it an unnecessary grind and that kind of ruined it for me because I used to

11:08.760 --> 11:13.560
like, you know, Grand Theft Auto four, for example, great game by itself.

11:13.560 --> 11:17.080
And then they released the loss of the dam expansion, which was also great.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.160
And then the ballad of gay Tony, which was also great.

11:19.160 --> 11:23.340
Like all of the content grant, the thought of four was just amazing.

11:23.340 --> 11:28.640
But then they found out they can make lots more money by having to persist to online

11:28.640 --> 11:29.640
mode.

11:29.640 --> 11:30.880
And so that's where it's going to go.

11:30.880 --> 11:34.940
And that's where six is probably going to go, unfortunately, even though the campaign

11:34.940 --> 11:40.980
is really good, but I'll buy it anyways, because I love those games.

11:40.980 --> 11:45.420
So it is disappointing though, that it's not structured the way it was because I really

11:45.420 --> 11:46.420
did like those.

11:46.420 --> 11:47.420
All right.

11:47.420 --> 11:53.220
Uh, so I, I'm looking and there's a, I usually read all the, uh, donators and stuff at the

11:53.220 --> 11:56.340
end of the show after we go off air, just live only on Twitch.

11:56.340 --> 12:00.140
But I have to acknowledge that there is a hype train going on right now.

12:00.140 --> 12:03.860
And I, I just put in a hundred biddies myself to kick it up to the next level.

12:03.860 --> 12:05.400
So people get more emotes.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.420
So I'd own their pixel pockets, just did it too.

12:07.420 --> 12:11.700
And many of you are donating bits and subs and thank you guys, you really don't have

12:11.700 --> 12:12.700
to do that.

12:12.700 --> 12:13.700
I know.

12:13.700 --> 12:14.700
Thank you.

12:14.700 --> 12:15.700
Thank you all.

12:15.700 --> 12:17.940
And I'll read, I'll read that all at the end of the show as I usually do.

12:17.940 --> 12:23.140
I, I, you know, it's, it's tricky cause we're walking that line between we're recording

12:23.140 --> 12:27.340
our podcast yet we are live on Twitch and it is very custom for Twitch streamers to

12:27.340 --> 12:29.900
thank people right as they donate.

12:29.900 --> 12:33.420
But it is hard when you're trying to, you know, do these stories and all these other

12:33.420 --> 12:37.140
things and try to keep the flow of your show going, which isn't as pleasant to listen to

12:37.140 --> 12:40.580
when you're in your car on a commuting train, you know, it's like, Hey, you were talking

12:40.580 --> 12:41.580
about this story.

12:41.580 --> 12:42.580
You don't get sidetracked.

12:42.580 --> 12:45.340
Uh, us at OLR get sidetracked.

12:45.340 --> 12:48.460
I guess maybe it's something you've come to expect here at OLR.

12:48.460 --> 12:49.460
I don't know.

12:49.460 --> 12:51.620
Who do you think you're listening to?

12:51.620 --> 12:52.620
Oh my gosh.

12:52.620 --> 12:54.620
You guys are so kind.

12:54.620 --> 12:57.700
VGRealness donated more and said, don't tell me what to do.

12:57.700 --> 12:58.700
You're not my real dad.

12:58.700 --> 12:59.700
I did it again.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.780
What are you going to do about it?

13:01.780 --> 13:04.300
Punish you.

13:04.340 --> 13:12.820
All right, moving on, uh, let's get it before things get really awkward here at OLR.

13:12.820 --> 13:16.500
Let's move on and talk about our kickoff topic tonight.

13:16.500 --> 13:21.620
Uh, Loki, you want to tell us a little bit about this, the, the, I heard you like stores.

13:21.620 --> 13:22.620
Yeah.

13:22.620 --> 13:24.580
So Epic says, Hey, you know what?

13:24.580 --> 13:27.140
We have a storefront, let's make more storefronts.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.980
So, uh, that's what they're doing.

13:28.980 --> 13:35.660
They're adding some different apps, um, into the Epic game storefront and, uh, some of

13:35.660 --> 13:38.500
those, they had five non gaming apps included with it.

13:38.500 --> 13:43.860
So they have a brave, which I guess is some open source web browser can shape, uh, which

13:43.860 --> 13:45.060
is actually really cool.

13:45.060 --> 13:49.980
So this is, um, if you're in game development, you'd probably know who Kenny is.

13:49.980 --> 13:57.060
Kenny is this guy who develops a lot of these free, um, creative commons, zero free to use

13:57.060 --> 13:58.360
assets.

13:58.360 --> 14:03.240
And so he has this new thing called Ken shape that you can use to generate simple low poly

14:03.240 --> 14:07.440
objects, just kind of drawing a picture and assigning like depth to it.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.440
And so it's really cool.

14:08.440 --> 14:14.000
So he's, um, they have that on there, uh, Krita, which is a painting and drawing app.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.320
Um, and then of course I heart radio, you guys are probably aware of that.

14:18.320 --> 14:22.800
Um, but then there's also, um, I guess like some itch IO stuff in there as well.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.680
So that's kind of interesting.

14:24.680 --> 14:31.040
Um, does that mean I can, uh, put pixel poops number two on there?

14:31.040 --> 14:34.240
That was, that was a question I was going to ask you, does this mean that now pixel

14:34.240 --> 14:39.640
poops, uh, number two is available on the, uh, on the, um, Epic game store?

14:39.640 --> 14:42.680
I mean, I guess it does, doesn't it?

14:42.680 --> 14:48.560
I mean, I, I guess, I guess you can, yeah, you can go within the store and then purchase

14:48.560 --> 14:51.200
pixel poops number two, if you wanted to.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.200
Huh?

14:52.800 --> 14:56.960
So technically, yes, we're on the Epic game store now, I guess.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.160
All right.

14:58.160 --> 14:59.160
That's great.

14:59.160 --> 15:04.440
Um, and, uh, Bobby is saying in chat, it's literally just the itch IO app that you can

15:04.440 --> 15:05.440
download.

15:05.440 --> 15:10.840
You can download it from their site or from Epic game store itch IO games are not listed

15:10.840 --> 15:16.520
on Epic game store, which is how a lot of people are kind of reporting this is that,

15:16.520 --> 15:19.320
Oh, it's embedded within, you know, the Epic game store.

15:19.560 --> 15:24.280
They're, they're, they're, they're taking over, uh, itch IO and all this stuff, or I'm

15:24.280 --> 15:25.960
sorry, they're Epic has taken over itch.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.600
I it's, that's not the case.

15:27.600 --> 15:31.160
So I think the app based thing is a way to think about it.

15:31.160 --> 15:35.680
It's just basically that they're launching their own app store, which when you consider

15:35.680 --> 15:39.600
what they've got going on in court and all this stuff right now, you know, again, I'm

15:39.600 --> 15:42.560
not going to touch that right now, cause we've got a long way to go in the court proceedings

15:42.560 --> 15:43.560
and all that stuff.

15:43.560 --> 15:48.020
But to hear that Epic is launching their own app store itch being one of those apps.

15:48.020 --> 15:49.740
That makes a lot of sense.

15:49.740 --> 15:50.740
Right.

15:50.740 --> 15:51.740
Yeah.

15:51.740 --> 15:53.540
And, and it's still pretty cool though.

15:53.540 --> 15:58.380
It's more exposure because there may be some people that are on, you know, get played stuff

15:58.380 --> 16:00.780
from steam or Epic games that they even know what it is.

16:00.780 --> 16:04.300
So, you know, more exposure is not a bad thing.

16:04.300 --> 16:05.420
Yeah, for sure.

16:05.420 --> 16:07.760
Um, and, uh, yeah, you're right.

16:07.760 --> 16:12.940
People may not necessarily, um, go to the itch website or even think about that, but

16:12.940 --> 16:16.980
maybe if they see within the Epic store and their Fortnite launcher that they're, Oh,

16:16.980 --> 16:21.640
there's this whole other game space, it may be a place that they can get exposed to even

16:21.640 --> 16:22.640
more stuff.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.520
And there's a lot of great stuff on itch.io, obviously.

16:24.520 --> 16:29.540
And I'm sure many of you own a truckload of games on itch.io already.

16:29.540 --> 16:34.400
Cause I, there were a lot of people I knew that participated in that, um, black lives

16:34.400 --> 16:39.100
matter or I was at a racial justice and inequity bundle.

16:39.100 --> 16:44.000
I'm sorry, I forget the actual name right now, but it was, it was, it was what they

16:44.020 --> 16:48.760
did when, you know, uh, that was really in the focus, um, as, as it should continue to

16:48.760 --> 16:49.760
be, let's be real.

16:49.760 --> 16:50.760
But you know what I mean?

16:50.760 --> 16:55.400
Really, really in the focus, uh, in June of last year, they did that bundle and many people

16:55.400 --> 16:59.480
probably picked up like, there was like 2000 games in that bundle or something like that.

16:59.480 --> 17:00.480
Right.

17:00.480 --> 17:01.880
And how many did y'all play?

17:01.880 --> 17:06.520
You know, so, um, there's, there's a lot, talk about a backlog, right?

17:06.520 --> 17:09.160
So, uh, so many backlogs.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.160
Yeah.

17:10.160 --> 17:11.160
Uh, this is funny.

17:11.320 --> 17:15.520
VG realness and chat is like, whoa, I mixed missed a few weeks.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.360
Did Loki release his game?

17:17.360 --> 17:19.720
Well, let it be, let us get you caught up.

17:19.720 --> 17:21.600
Yes, he released his game.

17:21.600 --> 17:27.640
Um, it is, um, so, uh, if you want to give Loki the most money for the game, you're going

17:27.640 --> 17:30.600
to go to itch.io and buy it there basically.

17:30.600 --> 17:35.840
But I have to kind of plug Aaron or YYR's pixel poops as well.

17:35.840 --> 17:40.040
So I would really also want to point you over to the steam store where the game pixel poops

17:40.040 --> 17:41.360
is free to play.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.000
Um, and you can check that out.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.080
That's our buddy YYR.

17:44.080 --> 17:48.600
And then there are two other versions of the game that are basically DLC.

17:48.600 --> 17:53.120
You have a cute little Commodore 64 version, which not enough people are talking about.

17:53.120 --> 17:57.000
You can buy that for, um, a certain amount of money that I forget in the moment, but

17:57.000 --> 17:58.480
it's under $5.

17:58.480 --> 18:02.560
And then there's your version of the game Loki, which is an NES game.

18:02.560 --> 18:06.720
And it's, you know, it's a little more, it's like $10, but you are getting like a really

18:06.720 --> 18:09.240
full NES cartridge experience.

18:09.240 --> 18:13.400
And there's still, yeah, and I'm still working on the special edition of it.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.800
So the special edition has actually 10 more levels.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.640
Um, it'll be a free update.

18:17.640 --> 18:23.120
So if you do purchase it before then you'll get a free update soon because I only have

18:23.120 --> 18:24.240
two more levels for it.

18:24.240 --> 18:29.260
Although I just saw tutorials on how to do animated tiles, so I may have to tweak that,

18:29.260 --> 18:32.000
but there's still like some updates I want to do to that.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.280
And then yeah, eventually like a physical release.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.320
I don't know how I'm going to do that yet.

18:36.320 --> 18:37.840
Um, I have cartridges.

18:37.840 --> 18:43.760
I can at least make 12, um, which based on the downloads so far and the purchases that

18:43.760 --> 18:49.960
may be all the interest we have, so we can, we can do it, but, um, we can see what we

18:49.960 --> 18:54.440
need to come up with there, but yeah, I've, I do want to have packed that cartridge as

18:54.440 --> 18:58.800
full as possible, um, before I actually start burning those.

18:58.800 --> 19:02.880
So that's why I made like, at least it's going to be at least 10 more levels.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.760
Um, I want to do more, but we'll see.

19:05.760 --> 19:09.880
Um, VG realness and chat says it's no longer the running joke of the podcast.

19:09.880 --> 19:10.880
What's it going to be now?

19:10.880 --> 19:18.040
Um, well, this is tough because maybe I was going to say Loki's, Loki's a game maker.

19:18.040 --> 19:20.200
Dark soccer is a music musician.

19:20.200 --> 19:29.560
Uh, I, um, well, um, maybe, maybe that's the joke and I don't even cook.

19:29.560 --> 19:38.120
I, I like to talk, uh, I'll do a series of motivational speeches or something.

19:38.120 --> 19:39.120
I don't know.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.120
Yeah, exactly.

19:40.120 --> 19:41.120
This is like crickets.

19:41.120 --> 19:42.120
So that's the new joke.

19:42.120 --> 19:45.120
My life.

19:45.120 --> 19:48.200
Your life is great.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.200
No I do.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.200
I do have things pretty good.

19:50.200 --> 19:54.320
I can't, but, but if you can't make fun of yourself and your friends, how are you going

19:54.320 --> 19:56.280
to make fun of somebody else?

19:56.280 --> 19:57.280
Yeah.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.280
All right.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.280
Oh, thank you.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Look at that.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
I was fishing, fishing for compliments there.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
S2 100 Matt.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.440
Rob is a great MC of things.

20:04.440 --> 20:05.440
That's right.

20:05.440 --> 20:06.440
You know what?

20:06.440 --> 20:08.960
I look forward for COVID to being over and I can get back into live hosting and doing

20:08.960 --> 20:10.040
panels and stuff like that.

20:10.040 --> 20:11.800
I, I, they, I, you're right.

20:11.800 --> 20:14.160
I, I love, I missed that a lot.

20:14.160 --> 20:15.160
So soon.

20:15.160 --> 20:22.600
Anyway, back to, uh, the Epic games store, adding another store, um, what do you, so,

20:22.600 --> 20:27.840
so Loki, do you think this is going to sell that 13th copy of the game or no, this isn't

20:27.840 --> 20:29.120
going to have, this isn't going to change anything.

20:29.120 --> 20:30.600
That's not going to change anything.

20:30.600 --> 20:31.600
It's a nice app though.

20:31.600 --> 20:37.040
I haven't had that downloaded yet, so, um, I get to see all the stuff that I own, which

20:37.040 --> 20:38.040
is a lot.

20:38.040 --> 20:43.000
I'll be curious kind of like how that works, if it's still kind of all embedded within

20:43.000 --> 20:47.600
the Epic store kind of front, or if it goes, cause it sounds like, especially the way Bobby's

20:47.600 --> 20:51.280
describing it, it's like, it's just a whole separate thing.

20:51.280 --> 20:54.640
So you don't even really have to wait for the Epic store to have it.

20:54.640 --> 20:57.680
You just go download it on itch.io's website and you check it out there.

20:57.680 --> 20:58.680
So there is that.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.680
So, all right.

21:00.680 --> 21:05.260
Well, um, at the end of the day, do you think this is a good thing for indies or does this

21:05.260 --> 21:07.800
feel like, Oh, it might be a cash in or something like that?

21:07.800 --> 21:09.520
I think it's a cash in at all.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.880
I think it's good to have that stuff out there.

21:11.880 --> 21:15.640
It'd be even better if it was integrated into Epic game store, but I can understand why

21:15.640 --> 21:17.440
they don't do that.

21:17.440 --> 21:18.440
Yeah.

21:18.440 --> 21:22.200
Um, yeah, we'll see, we'll see what ends up developing.

21:22.200 --> 21:25.720
I'll be curious to hear if any developers on itch.io notice a little boost from this,

21:25.720 --> 21:30.240
but yeah, I doubt at the end of the day, it's super kind of likely like either you

21:30.240 --> 21:33.320
are looking into these things or you're not.

21:33.320 --> 21:34.320
Right.

21:34.320 --> 21:35.320
So, right.

21:35.320 --> 21:36.320
Yeah.

21:36.320 --> 21:37.320
All right.

21:37.320 --> 21:41.720
Um, anyhow, moving on, um, gosh, you got to that level four hype train in chat.

21:41.720 --> 21:42.720
Thank you guys so much.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.800
There was a lot of anonymous donations and things like that.

21:44.800 --> 21:45.800
Gosh, gosh, gosh.

21:45.800 --> 21:46.800
I'm very, very thankful.

21:46.800 --> 21:47.800
Okay.

21:47.800 --> 21:50.800
Um, before we get into our gaming weeks, a little bit of other housekeeping here at the

21:50.800 --> 21:51.800
voice geeks network.

21:51.800 --> 21:57.560
I do want to give a shout out, um, to our pal, uh, Shane or, or shad stars, like, um,

21:57.560 --> 22:01.360
because he was a huge and instrumental in making this bonus stream happen here at the

22:01.360 --> 22:02.360
voice geeks network.

22:02.360 --> 22:08.600
This past week, uh, we did Shane's definitive Pokemon rankings, uh, and he illustrated his

22:08.600 --> 22:14.520
bottom 10 Pokemon and his top 50 Pokemon, and he even put together a PowerPoint.

22:14.520 --> 22:18.200
And so I'm actually very thankful that he like, you know, he kind of said that as a

22:18.200 --> 22:20.680
joke and then I was like, Oh no, now you got to do it.

22:20.680 --> 22:21.880
And he actually did do it.

22:21.880 --> 22:25.600
So I, you know, he's, he has better things he could be doing, um, like playing monster

22:25.600 --> 22:29.200
Hunter, I'm sure, but he did take the time out to do that and do the stream.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.200
And it was fun.

22:30.200 --> 22:34.560
Uh, I thought it was, you know, we, we ruffled a lot of feathers, I'm sure with the rankings,

22:34.560 --> 22:36.180
but, um, it was, it was a lot of fun.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.260
So check that out.

22:37.260 --> 22:41.820
If you are a subscriber here, uh, at twitch.tv, which a lot of you just became tonight, uh,

22:41.820 --> 22:43.180
with gift subs and things like that.

22:43.180 --> 22:44.220
So check that out.

22:44.220 --> 22:47.480
You can check that out, um, in the archives right now that's available.

22:48.120 --> 22:53.400
And we are looking to build more stuff out there in the archives so that, um, those of

22:53.400 --> 22:57.200
you that are so generous in subscribing, um, you know, really have, have more to look forward

22:57.200 --> 22:59.680
to as an extra special way to say thank you.

22:59.680 --> 23:06.880
Um, by the way, yes, I heard about the podcast app getting subscriptions and stuff this week.

23:06.880 --> 23:08.960
Uh, no comment on that at this time.

23:08.960 --> 23:11.120
I, we don't know enough details.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.760
I, right now the focus is on, on VOG.

23:13.760 --> 23:19.680
Um, and I, I do not see us, um, well, let me put it this way.

23:19.680 --> 23:24.120
It's been for the past 19 years, our MO has been, this show is free.

23:24.120 --> 23:27.200
This three hour thing that we do on Sunday nights, because it's a way to hang out with

23:27.200 --> 23:28.460
friends and all that stuff.

23:28.460 --> 23:29.460
That's free.

23:29.460 --> 23:31.880
That will not change period.

23:31.880 --> 23:35.880
Anything we do is going to be something extra in addition to that.

23:35.880 --> 23:39.900
Um, but I, I don't know if that is going to be, I, I'm kind of a little more focused on

23:39.900 --> 23:43.420
what we're trying to do, uh, at Twitch right now, but I know that question is going to

23:43.420 --> 23:44.420
get asked.

23:44.420 --> 23:47.300
Um, so I'm just going to clear up that air right now.

23:47.300 --> 23:50.980
Um, let's see, uh, what else I want to say with that?

23:50.980 --> 23:53.180
Oh, so Shane did the Pokemon ranking stream.

23:53.180 --> 23:58.580
It was a lot of fun and we're starting to raise the channel points for another stream.

23:58.580 --> 24:00.300
Bobby's going to do the next one.

24:00.300 --> 24:03.960
He's going to do something a little similar to what he did the first time with the tapes,

24:03.960 --> 24:10.040
and he's going to be doing some more E3 footage, uh, unearthed from the early two thousands.

24:10.040 --> 24:16.600
Um, and this is also neat because Bobby hasn't re-watched these tapes and he's going to go

24:16.600 --> 24:18.500
and put them onto Twitch.

24:18.500 --> 24:24.040
There may be more embarrassing shit like when he got Charles Martinet to be like, oh, it's

24:24.040 --> 24:29.040
Robert's TV show and all these things, which if you haven't seen the clip, please see the

24:29.040 --> 24:30.040
clip.

24:30.120 --> 24:35.360
So we don't know what kinds of stuff will show up there, so please, uh, look forward

24:35.360 --> 24:36.360
to that.

24:36.360 --> 24:40.040
I'm almost confident we're going to raise the points, uh, and, uh, that'll happen in

24:40.040 --> 24:41.040
the coming weeks.

24:41.040 --> 24:45.160
And then the ball will be back in our court to do something, but there are ideas there.

24:45.160 --> 24:49.160
I actually have ideas right now that I don't even necessarily want to do channel points

24:49.160 --> 24:50.160
for.

24:50.160 --> 24:51.160
I just want to do it.

24:51.160 --> 24:54.200
And Dark Sakura, we've been talking about some stuff like that and, uh, I want to rope

24:54.200 --> 24:55.860
Loki in on some ideas too.

24:55.860 --> 24:56.860
So we'll see.

24:56.860 --> 24:57.860
We'll see.

24:57.860 --> 24:58.860
All right.

24:58.980 --> 25:02.980
So anyway, uh, check that out all over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

25:02.980 --> 25:07.100
Let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the types of games that we have been playing

25:07.100 --> 25:08.100
this week.

25:08.100 --> 25:09.100
Dark Sakura.

25:09.100 --> 25:12.220
I know where this is going to go, but I think this is interesting.

25:12.220 --> 25:13.220
So go for it.

25:13.220 --> 25:14.220
It's more than animal crossing.

25:14.220 --> 25:15.220
That's true.

25:15.220 --> 25:16.220
It is more than animal crossing.

25:16.220 --> 25:21.140
So, um, yes, of course I did play animal crossing and I'm still playing word scapes.

25:21.140 --> 25:24.140
Um, but of course I'm playing dead by daylight.

25:24.140 --> 25:27.060
Um, I am not great at it.

25:27.060 --> 25:32.300
Actually, it takes more than five rounds of playing the game to, you know, actually

25:32.300 --> 25:33.300
be good.

25:33.300 --> 25:35.900
Although I finally got someone to sacrifice.

25:35.900 --> 25:43.900
Um, but, uh, I've been enjoying, uh, trolling trolls in the game.

25:43.900 --> 25:47.420
You know how people like try to do the teabag move and everything.

25:47.420 --> 25:52.700
And there were these, uh, little jerks that were up on it, whatever the name of the, the

25:52.700 --> 25:55.300
Myers level is where the houses hadn't filled.

25:55.300 --> 25:56.300
Yeah.

25:56.540 --> 25:58.900
Well, they were up on this like awning of a house.

25:58.900 --> 26:01.460
So I just sat there throwing up on them the whole time.

26:01.460 --> 26:07.460
Cause I played the Vami Mami and Legion is still number one in my heart nurse will be

26:07.460 --> 26:08.980
my end game.

26:08.980 --> 26:13.980
But right now I'm leveling the Vami Mami to get her stuff, to get a teachable.

26:13.980 --> 26:21.620
Anyway, I also did, uh, download another game on Apple arcade that I plan on streaming when

26:21.620 --> 26:28.060
I, uh, when I have a, a little bit more of a mood for it and that's Fantasian.

26:28.060 --> 26:29.060
Oh yeah.

26:29.060 --> 26:30.060
I want to see that.

26:30.060 --> 26:31.060
Sign me up.

26:31.060 --> 26:32.060
Yeah.

26:32.060 --> 26:37.220
Um, so, uh, because I do have my subscription to Apple arcade and I am playing on a Mac.

26:37.220 --> 26:45.940
Um, for the record, I get a lot of people now asking me about like how I'm playing,

26:45.940 --> 26:49.100
um, dead by daylight on a Mac.

26:49.100 --> 26:55.740
And they're like kind of floored that, that I am using Stadia and that I'm streaming from

26:55.740 --> 26:56.740
Stadia.

26:56.740 --> 26:57.740
Yeah.

26:57.740 --> 27:01.180
I, even I'm impressed that you're streaming gameplay from Stadia.

27:01.180 --> 27:05.380
The only time I've ever streamed Stadia footage was actually on this show.

27:05.380 --> 27:09.220
I think the week it came out or the week I got it when Bobby gave me a code or whatever,

27:09.220 --> 27:13.260
I recorded it in advance and then played it back on this show.

27:13.260 --> 27:16.540
I think that my video quality has been pretty good.

27:16.540 --> 27:19.980
Um, I've already downloaded a few, I've, I've clipped a few things.

27:19.980 --> 27:21.820
You can see it on my channel later on.

27:21.820 --> 27:25.100
Once you, once you fixed your proportions, you couldn't see the URL and that stuff anymore.

27:25.100 --> 27:26.100
It looks great.

27:26.100 --> 27:27.100
Yeah.

27:27.100 --> 27:28.100
Yeah.

27:28.100 --> 27:33.740
Um, it was, yeah, I really had to just tweak a lot of things in there, but, um, I'll be

27:33.740 --> 27:38.620
playing, um, some other games I think through Stadia as well, depending on, uh, when they

27:38.620 --> 27:39.620
come out.

27:39.620 --> 27:46.060
Like I'm considering, I mean, I don't want to buy, um, mass effect through Stadia because

27:46.060 --> 27:51.780
I want to eventually get my virtualization cleared up and, you know, have like a Parallels

27:51.780 --> 27:54.140
desktop or something.

27:54.140 --> 28:01.940
But um, I'm considering just trying to do a mass effect when it comes out through Parallels,

28:01.940 --> 28:05.780
if I can get that, but yeah, Stadia has been a delight.

28:05.780 --> 28:09.340
I take back every bad thing I've ever said about it.

28:09.340 --> 28:10.340
Interesting.

28:10.340 --> 28:11.340
Huh.

28:11.340 --> 28:19.220
On top of that, they had a lot of the dead by daylight DLC, um, on sale cheaper than

28:19.220 --> 28:23.140
how steam had it for a bit because they had it for half price.

28:23.140 --> 28:25.700
Be sure to promote that in your streams too, that you're playing on state.

28:25.700 --> 28:30.980
I think you do, but be sure to make sure Stadia is in there cause I, Stadia does have a small

28:30.980 --> 28:35.100
but loyal following and I bet they would seek out just people that are streaming on Stadia.

28:35.100 --> 28:40.480
Um, orange right in chat says I did play Stadia on my Twitch before it's definitely possible.

28:40.480 --> 28:41.480
Pretty interesting.

28:41.480 --> 28:46.200
The one problem I have, and I'm going to send this out as sort of a warning to other streamers

28:46.200 --> 28:47.200
on Mac.

28:47.200 --> 28:51.680
Um, so one thing about OBS that people don't realize is that you're going to have to have

28:51.680 --> 28:56.080
a second sound input that your system sounds will route through.

28:56.080 --> 29:00.920
I use this app called EQ Mac and that's what I used to capture my game audio.

29:00.920 --> 29:06.960
That's why when I was streaming animal crossing before my game audio wasn't being picked up.

29:06.960 --> 29:10.640
This very broadcast is coming to you from a Mac mini and we had to do a similar thing

29:10.640 --> 29:12.360
here in studio for that.

29:12.360 --> 29:13.360
Yeah.

29:13.360 --> 29:19.240
Um, so to answer what Stadia is, it is a streaming game service owned by Amazon.

29:19.240 --> 29:20.240
Google.

29:20.240 --> 29:21.760
Um, Google or Google.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.240
No, Amazon's was something different.

29:23.240 --> 29:24.240
Amazon's was Luna.

29:24.240 --> 29:31.280
Amazon is through Google and it's, uh, lots of really great games on there.

29:31.280 --> 29:36.040
I wish they did had a bigger library, but you can actually, it is like the G force now

29:36.040 --> 29:37.040
thing.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.600
Um, and I was going to use the G force now.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.920
I actually really prefer Stadia.

29:40.920 --> 29:45.640
Um, but it's really just, it's been really great.

29:45.640 --> 29:46.800
There's a lot of good games on it.

29:46.800 --> 29:51.280
It's enough to make me think about, uh, subscribing again to, uh, Stadia pro.

29:51.280 --> 29:59.200
Um, but back to the other thing, um, I've also found trouble with steam labs, OBS capturing

29:59.200 --> 30:02.600
my stadia screen where standard OBS does it just fine.

30:02.600 --> 30:06.200
So just wanted to throw that out there for other folks who might consider playing on

30:06.200 --> 30:07.560
stadium streaming.

30:07.560 --> 30:11.920
I do also to, uh, clarify what I'm amethyst Rose, which is saying in our chat with the

30:11.920 --> 30:14.320
questions about Stadia and video G force.

30:14.320 --> 30:18.480
Now, one thing you do, you do, especially cause I noticed amethyst Rose, which says,

30:18.480 --> 30:19.920
okay, I love G force now.

30:19.920 --> 30:23.160
Well, one thing you're going to want to be very aware of is, is that the pricing structure

30:23.160 --> 30:24.840
is very different between the two.

30:24.840 --> 30:25.840
That's the other big thing.

30:25.840 --> 30:29.960
I mean, in functionality, they're both cloud based gaming services, but Nvidia kind of

30:29.960 --> 30:32.600
taps into games you already own.

30:32.600 --> 30:36.120
Like it looks at your steam library and you know, what's installed on your computer and

30:36.120 --> 30:38.720
you kind of connect it to games that you already own.

30:38.720 --> 30:43.960
And then you're paying Nvidia basically to rent their computer and their, their super

30:43.960 --> 30:46.000
powerful computer and stream from that.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.400
Uh, but of course they have that free version, but you might run into a queue.

30:49.400 --> 30:50.720
You're limited to an hour.

30:50.720 --> 30:54.280
So there's things with that, or you can pay the 10 bucks to have the, whenever you want

30:54.280 --> 30:57.320
it and the highest quality and all that stuff.

30:57.320 --> 31:02.280
But, uh, you're not paying to rent the computer or what have you, not paying to rent Google's

31:02.280 --> 31:08.520
computer, but you are having to buy the games uniquely on Stadia's storefront.

31:08.520 --> 31:13.320
So when you buy a game on state, unless it's cross play or cross purchase, which very few

31:13.320 --> 31:19.600
are, unless you have Stadia pro, then you pay 10 bucks a month and you can get a bunch

31:19.600 --> 31:21.520
of games for quote free.

31:21.520 --> 31:22.520
Yeah, right.

31:22.520 --> 31:23.600
There is that as well.

31:23.600 --> 31:28.080
So, so just, I want to make sure that the pricing configurations are a little different

31:28.080 --> 31:30.200
between the two and kind of like where the ownership is.

31:30.200 --> 31:33.440
And I think that's important to weigh when you're deciding which one you want to go with.

31:33.440 --> 31:39.120
But I really do think, especially when Microsoft, which they're getting closer and closer to

31:39.120 --> 31:44.020
launching this whole thing with Xbox, when that gets closer and they launched that fully,

31:44.020 --> 31:48.000
I think you're really going to see cloud gaming take off in a lot of different ways.

31:48.000 --> 31:52.860
Um, which has me a little bit nervous again with the bandwidth cap thing, but I'm hoping

31:52.860 --> 31:57.620
as that becomes more and more the norm, there's going to be more pressure on cable companies

31:57.620 --> 31:59.980
to increase that cap to something reasonable.

31:59.980 --> 32:00.980
But we'll see.

32:00.980 --> 32:01.980
I don't know.

32:01.980 --> 32:04.580
It's that this is a process that will take years, not months to be honest.

32:04.580 --> 32:05.580
Data should be free.

32:05.580 --> 32:06.620
It really should be.

32:06.620 --> 32:08.820
But we all know, you know, yeah, anyway.

32:08.820 --> 32:09.820
All right.

32:09.820 --> 32:12.060
Uh, so that was a dark soccer's gaming week.

32:12.060 --> 32:15.700
Oh, actually one of the things, and I don't mean to make this the dead by daylight cast,

32:15.700 --> 32:16.700
which we've talked about.

32:16.700 --> 32:17.700
We've talked about the game.

32:17.700 --> 32:19.180
Maybe we should do that.

32:19.180 --> 32:20.640
Well, let's talk later.

32:20.640 --> 32:26.320
But um, I do want to ask about this because you were kind of saying I'm struggling with

32:26.320 --> 32:27.680
the game a little bit.

32:27.680 --> 32:29.560
It's hard, you know, to get in there.

32:29.560 --> 32:34.680
And obviously practice is a big deal, but I have found this element of it fascinating

32:34.680 --> 32:39.780
for me, quite frankly, Jamie, is that you like to play the killer, which is a first

32:39.780 --> 32:41.480
person game.

32:41.480 --> 32:47.580
You have been very adverse over the years to playing first person games because of what,

32:47.580 --> 32:52.100
you know, it can make you sick if it's not, you know, the right thing and all this stuff.

32:52.100 --> 32:58.460
So I'm, but I know the lore of this game and everything else is like, Halo's lore did not

32:58.460 --> 33:03.980
pull you in dead by daylight's Lord pulled you in to make you go enough like, all right,

33:03.980 --> 33:06.580
I got to just mentally give this a shot.

33:06.580 --> 33:08.300
So I play windowed.

33:08.300 --> 33:10.700
Oh, you play it in windowed.

33:10.700 --> 33:12.900
So that way it's not your entire screen.

33:12.900 --> 33:13.900
Ah, exactly.

33:13.900 --> 33:16.460
So then it's just a smaller area.

33:16.460 --> 33:17.460
Yeah.

33:17.460 --> 33:22.820
I mean, I play with a pretty, pretty big screen, you know, I mean, keep in mind my I've got

33:22.820 --> 33:29.420
a 32 inch ultra widescreen monitor with a really great refresh rate.

33:29.420 --> 33:33.500
So it turns out that the other part of things had to do with the refresh.

33:33.500 --> 33:40.140
When I'm using a 60 megahertz screen, I get more nauseous having a higher refresh rate

33:40.140 --> 33:41.140
on my monitor.

33:41.140 --> 33:45.460
So I have a 144 has actually made it a bit easier for me.

33:45.460 --> 33:46.460
Okay.

33:46.460 --> 33:49.580
So that was exactly what I needed to know is kind of like, how did you consolidate that

33:49.580 --> 33:53.500
and kind of, I don't want to say, get over it because when we're talking about physical

33:53.500 --> 33:55.740
things, I don't want to ever say, you know, Oh, get over it.

33:55.740 --> 33:57.980
But how were you able to kind of make it work, I guess.

33:57.980 --> 34:00.860
And that, that explains a lot because yeah, when you play in windowed mode, then your

34:00.860 --> 34:05.940
eyes can kind of fixate if it needs to on the static background and that kind of helps,

34:05.940 --> 34:06.940
right?

34:06.940 --> 34:07.940
Yeah.

34:07.940 --> 34:08.940
So it really does help.

34:08.940 --> 34:10.660
And the fact that actually the color of my background.

34:10.660 --> 34:16.380
So I have this a super Metroid background that's, you know, the, the dead people in

34:16.380 --> 34:22.700
the lab and the purples and blues actually add a nice frame around it that I also get

34:22.700 --> 34:26.420
less eye strain out of it.

34:26.420 --> 34:32.420
And so, and to answer, I answered DJ Ron mass already, but I'll say if it's an LG monitor,

34:32.420 --> 34:35.020
yes, my monitor is an LG.

34:35.020 --> 34:39.340
I paid almost as much as my Mac for, for my monitor.

34:39.340 --> 34:40.340
Yeah.

34:41.020 --> 34:51.100
Well, I cash stocks, but yeah, I, and I make sure that I keep softer light in my room.

34:51.100 --> 34:57.420
Like right now I have my lamp on cause I'm doing the show and I'll probably have it for

34:57.420 --> 35:01.060
other streaming events later.

35:01.060 --> 35:04.500
But it's, I've got to do a couple of things and I also make sure that I have something

35:04.500 --> 35:09.180
a little carby to eat because it keeps my stomach from flip-flopping.

35:09.500 --> 35:12.740
I just, I just think that that part, so it's not even really just about dead by daylight.

35:12.740 --> 35:15.660
So, you know, don't, don't razz me too much for talking about this game in depth three

35:15.660 --> 35:16.660
weeks in a row.

35:16.660 --> 35:23.540
But I think it's more the dark soccer kind of over or kind of accommodated this you know,

35:23.540 --> 35:27.300
thing that she's dealt with in first person games before to make it work because dead

35:27.300 --> 35:31.580
by daylight and the story and the uniqueness of it has appealed to her that much.

35:31.580 --> 35:34.860
I find that super fascinating, honestly, but absolutely.

35:34.860 --> 35:38.380
But I also think that's part of why you're having an uphill climb Jamie, because I know

35:38.380 --> 35:40.420
you were asking like, well, how did you do it so fast?

35:40.420 --> 35:43.260
Well, I've played a crap ton of first person games.

35:43.260 --> 35:44.300
I've played the halo.

35:44.300 --> 35:46.100
I've played all this other stuff.

35:46.100 --> 35:50.380
And I think inherently there's stuff with that, that you have to get used to on how

35:50.380 --> 35:52.580
those games control and how they move.

35:52.580 --> 35:56.940
And so you trying to navigate that and trying to make sure you don't get sick while playing

35:56.940 --> 35:57.940
it.

35:57.940 --> 35:59.900
I think you're going to have an even longer uphill climb.

35:59.900 --> 36:00.900
You'll get there.

36:00.900 --> 36:01.900
Practice makes perfect.

36:01.900 --> 36:02.900
Right?

36:02.900 --> 36:07.380
Yeah, well, and I, I mean, the thing is, is that I know that the game still for, for Killers

36:07.380 --> 36:09.540
has a pretty decent curve on it anyway.

36:09.540 --> 36:14.860
It does, especially since I'm starting with one of the harder characters when you have

36:14.860 --> 36:18.820
to, you have to work your way up and level the characters that you can get more perks

36:18.820 --> 36:20.700
and then the perks help you do better.

36:20.700 --> 36:21.700
It does.

36:21.700 --> 36:22.700
It has a steep climb.

36:22.700 --> 36:23.700
She's tall.

36:23.700 --> 36:25.180
I'm not used to tall.

36:25.180 --> 36:30.300
Like I do better and now I and I'll get off the topic in a second.

36:30.300 --> 36:37.140
I've done better with some of the faster characters like Legion and trickster.

36:37.140 --> 36:38.140
They're fun.

36:38.140 --> 36:39.220
I like the fast ones.

36:39.220 --> 36:45.260
I mean, tricksters, even with his Buffy still not very good, but, um, I hate, I hate playing

36:45.260 --> 36:46.260
Bubba.

36:46.260 --> 36:48.540
I hate him and I'm going to have to level him for barbecue.

36:48.540 --> 36:53.220
So yeah, it's just, I think that that's the thing is that I'm getting over characters.

36:53.220 --> 36:58.660
I'm not having a lot of fun with to get to the stuff I'm going to have fun with.

36:58.660 --> 37:02.460
Cause when I get to nurse, it's over, it's over for you host.

37:03.220 --> 37:09.500
Oh, cause if someone can play nurse really well, just bend over and kiss your ass.

37:09.500 --> 37:10.500
Goodbye.

37:10.500 --> 37:11.500
All right.

37:11.500 --> 37:14.220
Um, I do want to also mention, um, cause we've been talking about the, uh, you know, these

37:14.220 --> 37:16.780
issues and pixel pocket says, thanks for the tips, Jamie.

37:16.780 --> 37:21.380
Um, I try to get around, I try to get around motion sickness with windowed screen, large

37:21.380 --> 37:23.660
F FOV field of vision.

37:23.660 --> 37:24.660
Right.

37:24.660 --> 37:29.800
Um, and recently got a 144 Hertz monitor and it's helped, but some games still cause it.

37:30.240 --> 37:31.240
Yeah.

37:31.240 --> 37:32.240
I I'll have the same problem.

37:32.240 --> 37:38.480
Um, and the thing is the field of vision with, uh, in a dead by daylight is very, I guess,

37:38.480 --> 37:39.480
human range.

37:39.480 --> 37:44.040
Um, like when I'm playing a plague, Vami Mami, she's taller.

37:44.040 --> 37:49.160
So her field of vision is different for me, but when I'm play somebody who's got a field

37:49.160 --> 37:53.480
of vision, that's very similar to short little me, you know, it's easier.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.840
I don't, I don't have as many problems with it.

37:56.360 --> 38:01.000
Um, and there are, I think perks you can get that expand or add ons that expand your field

38:01.000 --> 38:02.360
of view for your character.

38:02.360 --> 38:03.360
Wraith has some.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.360
Yeah.

38:04.360 --> 38:05.360
Yeah.

38:05.360 --> 38:06.360
Well, ding dong.

38:06.360 --> 38:15.520
But anyway, um, I, I don't know, I I've, I've seen them in play and the standard FOV is,

38:15.520 --> 38:17.580
is honestly better.

38:17.580 --> 38:20.440
And then one other thing I want to point out is that, um, Bobby Black Wolf was kind of

38:20.440 --> 38:24.660
speaking up to, to one other thing you've been kind of open about your aversions with

38:24.660 --> 38:25.660
on the show.

38:25.660 --> 38:30.300
And that is VR, which I, I don't think is anything against VR as it is, but that VR

38:30.300 --> 38:34.140
kind of plays into a lot of the same things that have triggered sickness and first person

38:34.140 --> 38:40.200
games if I'm not misstating these, but Bobby points out, and I think this is also interesting.

38:40.200 --> 38:44.780
This is why VR devices are pushing for higher refresh rates.

38:44.780 --> 38:49.360
The valve index now does 124 or excuse me, 120 Hertz.

38:49.360 --> 38:53.660
So it's interesting to see that VR, that industry realizes this as well.

38:53.660 --> 38:57.880
And they're trying to get to those higher refresh rates to maybe hopefully one day when,

38:57.880 --> 38:59.960
when more people like you over, we'll see.

38:59.960 --> 39:00.960
So we'll see.

39:00.960 --> 39:01.960
We'll see.

39:01.960 --> 39:02.960
Interesting.

39:02.960 --> 39:03.960
All right.

39:03.960 --> 39:05.860
Uh, anyway, thank you for indulging my, uh, questions there.

39:05.860 --> 39:09.860
And, uh, I will say, um, live here at the voice of geeks network, um, tonight after

39:09.860 --> 39:15.760
the show, I believe you're gonna show, show some of your chops on some of my not chops.

39:15.760 --> 39:19.760
So I think it's basically just going to be a giant puke fest with vami mommy.

39:19.760 --> 39:21.960
So you're going to be streaming a little bit after OLR tonight.

39:21.960 --> 39:22.960
So it'd be fun to watch.

39:22.960 --> 39:23.960
Yeah.

39:23.960 --> 39:28.020
And keep in mind, I don't normally like to stream after we do or do much of anything

39:28.020 --> 39:34.580
after OLR because, um, I, I'm usually really tired after this show, but I'll switch off

39:34.580 --> 39:40.660
my headphones and put on the, the desktop audio and I'll, I'll suck it up for y'all.

39:40.660 --> 39:41.660
All right.

39:41.660 --> 39:42.660
Sounds good.

39:42.660 --> 39:43.660
All right.

39:43.660 --> 39:45.100
Uh, Loki, thanks for waiting.

39:45.100 --> 39:46.500
And how was your gaming week?

39:46.500 --> 39:49.940
Uh, it was pretty much all the same.

39:49.940 --> 39:55.860
So been all Minecraft all week long playing on that multiplayer server that I'm on now.

39:55.860 --> 39:58.160
Still also trying to edit my video together.

39:58.160 --> 40:00.200
I'm almost done with the first episode.

40:00.200 --> 40:06.620
It just, um, I need to do more voiceovers because a lot of the stuff that recorded before

40:06.620 --> 40:13.120
I didn't do voiceovers during, um, just because it's hard to do that, you know, in the area

40:13.120 --> 40:19.520
that I am, um, so it's just a lot of voiceover recording and editing together for that.

40:19.520 --> 40:21.320
But I am enjoying it.

40:21.320 --> 40:26.240
I'm, uh, built some farms and have to open up a shop.

40:26.240 --> 40:28.540
So I've got a lot more farms to make.

40:28.540 --> 40:32.420
And then I've taken the week off this week to play a lot of that.

40:32.420 --> 40:38.360
So it'll be a lot of Minecraft this week and then Orna, a little bit of Orna as well.

40:38.360 --> 40:42.500
Uh, I haven't, I haven't, I gotta admit, I've completely fallen off the Orna wagon.

40:42.500 --> 40:44.400
I haven't played in a month.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.400
Easy.

40:45.400 --> 40:48.680
It's just, I can only fit in so many of those games, right?

40:48.680 --> 40:52.640
When I'm out and about and Orna's kind of got, I think Pokemon go kind of got my interest

40:52.640 --> 40:57.080
enough again, where it's like an Ingress to an extent where Orna's kind of in the backseat.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.900
I don't know how much longer the Ingress thing is going to last, but they're really trying

40:59.900 --> 41:02.200
to push new stuff in that game to keep it interesting.

41:02.200 --> 41:03.560
I'll talk about that in a second.

41:03.560 --> 41:05.640
Um, so Orna's just kind of in the backseat for now.

41:05.640 --> 41:06.640
Yeah.

41:06.640 --> 41:09.680
I've been just trying to grind at that cause I'm still like one 84.

41:09.680 --> 41:11.360
Like I can't level up.

41:11.360 --> 41:12.720
It doesn't, it's, I don't know.

41:12.720 --> 41:15.040
I like fight boss after boss.

41:15.040 --> 41:18.440
I guess I should do more of the raid bosses, but like, I don't know.

41:18.440 --> 41:20.600
It doesn't seem like I'm earning XP very fast.

41:20.600 --> 41:21.600
Yeah.

41:21.600 --> 41:22.600
It's, it's a grind.

41:22.600 --> 41:23.600
It really is.

41:23.600 --> 41:26.440
I just take over areas as I go places.

41:26.440 --> 41:28.960
World bosses, world bosses are the fastest way to do it.

41:28.960 --> 41:33.760
Drop, drop the coin, drop the end and try to drive around safely, pull over in parking

41:33.760 --> 41:34.760
lots.

41:34.760 --> 41:35.760
Okay.

41:35.760 --> 41:38.160
And you know, hit every world boss you can in the parking lot, drive to another parking

41:38.160 --> 41:39.160
lot, do it again.

41:39.160 --> 41:40.160
And same, same.

41:40.160 --> 41:43.080
Oh, I, I fight bosses all the time, but it's just nothing.

41:43.080 --> 41:46.280
I mean, it just doesn't seem to be making a dent.

41:46.280 --> 41:47.280
Yeah.

41:47.280 --> 41:48.280
It's tough stuff.

41:48.320 --> 41:49.320
All right.

41:49.320 --> 41:53.560
Do, liberally run those coins and XP boosts because if, especially because you probably

41:53.560 --> 41:56.440
have hundreds of them in your inventory, there's no need to do every time.

41:56.440 --> 42:00.920
Every time I play for like any given amount of time, I will do that and I'll do the raids

42:00.920 --> 42:02.200
and or the gauntlets.

42:02.200 --> 42:08.040
Um, a lot of times I've been doing like the, uh, endless gauntlets and stuff to, you know,

42:08.040 --> 42:10.680
earn some more stuff or I'll do the boss only ones.

42:10.680 --> 42:11.680
Yep.

42:11.680 --> 42:12.680
Um, it's just nothing.

42:12.680 --> 42:14.680
It doesn't make a grind.

42:14.680 --> 42:15.680
It's a grind.

42:15.680 --> 42:16.680
All right.

42:16.680 --> 42:20.120
Uh, so, okay, then if that's it for your gaming week, I'll talk about my gaming week, which

42:20.120 --> 42:22.840
has, um, um, not a lot of new stuff this week.

42:22.840 --> 42:27.240
I've been continuing on in Final Fantasy 14 a little bit, except all of my buddies who

42:27.240 --> 42:31.360
play Final Fantasy 14 have kind of fallen off the wagon a little bit as they're, they're

42:31.360 --> 42:32.660
playing other games.

42:32.660 --> 42:37.600
So I really only get on, pardon me, to do like an expert or something a couple of times

42:37.600 --> 42:40.000
and there's not a lot else for me to do.

42:40.000 --> 42:45.200
Although I do need to run that new near raid again, I'll probably do it tomorrow, uh, run

42:45.200 --> 42:47.320
them all to get my coins, to get upgrades.

42:47.320 --> 42:51.380
Um, there's a big, uh, Final Fantasy 14 fan event coming up in a couple of weeks and they

42:51.380 --> 42:53.720
just released the schedule for the fan event.

42:53.720 --> 42:58.420
And man, this is where worldwide events stink because like the keynote, I think it's from

42:58.420 --> 43:02.940
like eight to 10, but no, maybe it was earlier, but it was like six to eight Pacific, which

43:02.940 --> 43:04.080
is fine.

43:04.080 --> 43:06.180
But then the programming goes all night long.

43:06.180 --> 43:10.760
And if you want to see the concert, guess when the concert airs two AM to three 50 Pacific

43:10.760 --> 43:13.240
time, I'm not gonna be awake for that.

43:13.280 --> 43:16.040
Nobody on the East coast is going to be awake for that unless you're a diehard Final Fantasy

43:16.040 --> 43:18.580
fanning, 14 fanning to stay up all night.

43:18.580 --> 43:23.800
So hopefully they let us watch that stuff on demand and I can see it later, but the

43:23.800 --> 43:26.440
keynote's the most important part because that's where all the news will be.

43:26.440 --> 43:30.900
So, um, Ooh, if they let us co-stream that again, maybe there'll be another, uh, reaction

43:30.900 --> 43:31.960
thing we'll do here at VOG.

43:31.960 --> 43:32.960
We'll see.

43:32.960 --> 43:36.760
Um, Bob coffee and chat says it must be running on JST.

43:36.760 --> 43:37.760
Absolutely.

43:37.760 --> 43:46.160
I think they were going to, at one point, uh, invite a few fans to act and not like

43:46.160 --> 43:51.040
a ton, but just a few to feel like, uh, you know, to, to safely fill a small room and

43:51.040 --> 43:52.820
do the presentation, do everything that way.

43:52.820 --> 43:54.320
I think don't quote me on this.

43:54.320 --> 43:59.240
I think they've had to, or they are calling that off because unfortunately Japan is, uh,

43:59.240 --> 44:00.880
regressing a little bit on the COVID thing.

44:00.880 --> 44:03.800
So I don't think, um, that is all happening in person after all.

44:03.800 --> 44:07.060
I think it's going to be similar to their event, um, a few weeks ago where it's going

44:07.060 --> 44:10.740
to be a very awkward, empty room, but that's just what it is right now.

44:10.740 --> 44:11.740
So you're laughing.

44:11.740 --> 44:12.740
Loki.

44:12.740 --> 44:13.740
What's a damn funny.

44:13.740 --> 44:14.740
Nothing.

44:14.740 --> 44:15.740
Okay.

44:15.740 --> 44:16.740
Read some stuff.

44:16.740 --> 44:17.740
All right.

44:17.740 --> 44:18.740
That's fine.

44:18.740 --> 44:19.740
I was like, COVID is not funny.

44:19.740 --> 44:20.740
Don't laugh at that.

44:20.740 --> 44:21.740
All right.

44:21.740 --> 44:22.740
Okay.

44:22.740 --> 44:23.740
Moving on.

44:23.740 --> 44:28.940
Um, other things in my gaming week, um, I've also been playing the mobile games, uh, ingress

44:28.940 --> 44:31.860
and Pokemon go, um, not a lot notable.

44:31.860 --> 44:37.380
I was really irritated with that Pokemon go event yesterday because, um, Alan and I

44:37.380 --> 44:38.380
have been looking at houses.

44:38.380 --> 44:41.740
I haven't really made that a secret on the show is that we're looking to buy finally

44:41.740 --> 44:46.440
after all these years, as is everyone in this area, did you know, this is the hottest real

44:46.440 --> 44:48.700
estate market in the entire nation right now.

44:48.700 --> 44:49.700
It's disgusting.

44:49.700 --> 44:53.420
Um, so yeah, we have a, we have a lot to deal with right now.

44:53.420 --> 44:57.980
Um, so, uh, but anyway, um, we, we've been doing all that.

44:57.980 --> 45:04.940
And so, um, I, uh, missed like the first hour and a half of that Pokemon event on Saturday.

45:04.940 --> 45:10.780
Um, thank God the collection event was really easy, uh, because I was able to finish it

45:10.780 --> 45:14.540
after all, or I would have broken my perfect streak and I would have been really upset

45:14.540 --> 45:15.540
about that.

45:15.540 --> 45:17.900
So, um, just something to state there.

45:17.900 --> 45:18.900
So, uh, yeah.

45:18.900 --> 45:24.860
As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, yeah, the 11 AM to 2 PM was too short for that event.

45:24.860 --> 45:27.300
It really was community days are six hours long.

45:27.300 --> 45:28.780
Why wasn't it at least that long?

45:28.780 --> 45:30.540
That was a little ridiculous to me.

45:30.540 --> 45:31.780
I still been playing Ingress.

45:31.780 --> 45:34.900
They've been doing events and that one too, like they're running a event right now for

45:34.900 --> 45:39.740
like the week where they, they have changed one of the core game mechanics, which is very

45:39.740 --> 45:44.460
interesting to me currently now in the game for the next week, you can throw a field under

45:44.460 --> 45:48.740
an existing field, which probably doesn't make sense to people who don't play the game.

45:48.740 --> 45:54.340
But um, part of it is you, you link point, you link pokey stops their version of it together

45:54.340 --> 45:57.060
to make fields for your team's color.

45:57.060 --> 46:01.500
And a core thing in the game is that links can't cross and you can't field under an existing

46:01.500 --> 46:02.500
field.

46:02.500 --> 46:03.500
You have to take the field down to field.

46:03.500 --> 46:07.140
Um, and that's the, so one of those rules, they're changing up this week, so that's kind

46:07.140 --> 46:08.140
of interesting.

46:08.140 --> 46:11.580
Um, but also there's a huge boost in AP or experience.

46:11.580 --> 46:16.140
Um, and so I've been trying to get like 30 minutes of exercise every day.

46:16.140 --> 46:19.700
So I'll just go out, play that, do some like, I walked downtown the other day and just did

46:19.700 --> 46:24.100
what I call micro fielding where you just, just hack all the portals, link, just try

46:24.140 --> 46:28.500
to, you know, field very small areas of downtown and get tons of stuff that way.

46:28.500 --> 46:32.060
And I was at the college campus the other day and I'll probably go somewhere else tomorrow,

46:32.060 --> 46:34.100
uh, and, and keep up with that throughout the event.

46:34.100 --> 46:35.620
So there's been that.

46:35.620 --> 46:40.820
Um, and then, uh, the other thing I've been playing this week of course is dead by daylight,

46:40.820 --> 46:45.140
but here's, here's the part where I'm sure y'all are going to laugh.

46:45.140 --> 46:50.980
I bought dead by daylight on steam, even after I'd invested all that time in my Xbox one

46:50.980 --> 46:51.980
version.

46:52.020 --> 46:56.220
Finally, those things that came up last week where I'm like, I need to be able to turn

46:56.220 --> 46:59.380
around quickly and use keyboard and mouse and all this stuff.

46:59.380 --> 47:02.140
I finally broke down and bought it on PC on steam.

47:02.140 --> 47:03.220
I had to have it that way.

47:03.220 --> 47:10.620
Now before you, oh yes, oh God, I, I've felt my gameplay improved tremendously with the

47:10.620 --> 47:13.180
monitor right in front of my face as opposed to the TV.

47:13.180 --> 47:17.580
I'm seeing more the headphones, which I don't have for my Xbox one.

47:17.660 --> 47:22.940
Um, I'm able to, um, hear more and that game is very important on sound cues.

47:22.940 --> 47:25.340
I didn't realize, especially if you play spirit.

47:25.340 --> 47:26.020
Oh my God.

47:26.020 --> 47:26.540
Well, yeah.

47:26.540 --> 47:30.380
And even just playing the killer, you've got to be able to hear the coughing and the, you

47:30.380 --> 47:31.900
know, crying and stuff.

47:31.900 --> 47:36.300
And, uh, I think for survivor to some point to, um, uh, sound is very important.

47:36.300 --> 47:42.220
I'm really tempted to try to, to see if I can find Strider, um, to, to have teachable

47:42.220 --> 47:47.500
soon, but just for that reason, that's one thing, one good thing about, about plague

47:47.500 --> 47:50.460
is that you can hear people retching when you vomited on them.

47:51.180 --> 47:51.420
Yeah.

47:51.420 --> 47:54.220
So there, yeah, there's a lot of important sound stuff in the game.

47:54.220 --> 47:59.900
Now, before you all give me crap about buying a game multiple times, ha ha, guess what?

47:59.900 --> 48:06.140
This is the first time I've bought dead by daylight because Xbox game pass allowed me

48:06.140 --> 48:08.220
to play it on Xbox one.

48:08.220 --> 48:10.460
And I had played a little bit on windows game store.

48:10.460 --> 48:14.860
I opted for steam because I was told, uh, and, uh, found out around the internet windows

48:14.860 --> 48:17.100
game store never has sales.

48:17.100 --> 48:17.420
Never.

48:17.980 --> 48:19.420
So, um, I bought it on steam.

48:19.980 --> 48:22.780
So, um, this is actually the first time I bought the game.

48:22.780 --> 48:25.340
Unfortunately, the DLC is the stuff.

48:25.340 --> 48:25.660
Thank you.

48:25.660 --> 48:27.580
I thank God I didn't buy a lot of it.

48:27.580 --> 48:31.820
Uh, and that, um, my, uh, my, my murder sister, dark Sakura kind of hooked me up with a lot

48:31.820 --> 48:32.380
of it.

48:32.380 --> 48:37.580
Um, so, um, it doesn't, it doesn't feel like as big a loss and someday they will implement

48:37.580 --> 48:42.300
the cross purchase and I'll be able to get all the stats back, but we'll, uh, we'll see.

48:42.860 --> 48:51.580
So, yeah, I know, um, actually for, for, uh, behavior's website, um, you, um, I don't know

48:51.580 --> 48:57.180
if they have any kind of link through Xbox, but they do have a stadia and a steam link.

48:57.180 --> 48:57.500
They do.

48:57.500 --> 49:00.300
And it does not include windows store or anything else yet.

49:00.300 --> 49:01.660
Although they say it's kind of sucks.

49:01.660 --> 49:05.660
And to clarify, I'm sorry, DJ Roma S says the Microsoft store does have a lot of sales,

49:05.660 --> 49:07.260
but they don't advertise it as well.

49:07.260 --> 49:07.820
I'm sorry.

49:07.820 --> 49:09.420
I may have misstated what I said.

49:09.420 --> 49:10.220
Yes, that is true.

49:10.220 --> 49:13.900
And the Xbox, uh, market front does a lot as well.

49:13.900 --> 49:19.180
Um, specifically dead by daylight is, uh, you go on the Reddit and thing like that.

49:19.180 --> 49:22.700
And people will say they never have sales on dead by daylight or the characters in the

49:22.700 --> 49:23.580
windows store.

49:23.580 --> 49:26.540
So, um, I just opted to get it on steam, whatever.

49:26.540 --> 49:31.660
Um, cause steam was having also steam was having a half off sale on the game itself

49:31.660 --> 49:32.300
anyway.

49:32.300 --> 49:34.460
So that made me kind of pull the trigger on that.

49:34.460 --> 49:39.260
So stadia is I think also having a sale though on the gold version of the game.

49:39.260 --> 49:39.740
Oh, nice.

49:40.300 --> 49:41.580
Like 36 bucks.

49:41.580 --> 49:42.080
Yeah.

49:42.780 --> 49:47.580
I, I did, I re-bought pyramid head because of course I think I will be a pyramid head

49:47.580 --> 49:48.940
main when all is said and done.

49:48.940 --> 49:53.980
And, uh, I did buy Bubba or leather face, which I didn't even have on Xbox one just

49:53.980 --> 49:56.940
because I'm like, I need to get that perk and why not?

49:56.940 --> 49:58.700
I'll have this killer in my repertoire.

49:58.700 --> 50:01.020
Um, and I've been playing mostly Bubba.

50:01.020 --> 50:05.020
Um, I, I don't like his talent at all.

50:05.020 --> 50:06.940
Like I think the chainsaw thing is kind of crap.

50:07.580 --> 50:09.980
It's nice for getting through pallets quickly.

50:10.300 --> 50:13.820
But he is what a lot of the streamers would call an M1 killer.

50:13.820 --> 50:17.820
Meaning you use your mouse, you use your mouse button one and that's about it.

50:17.820 --> 50:18.780
So anyway.

50:18.780 --> 50:20.700
All right, enough about that.

50:20.700 --> 50:25.980
Let's get into some other gaming news and talk about what else is going on in the industry.

50:25.980 --> 50:29.740
Uh, bonds double 06 is also pointing out the store have sales.

50:29.740 --> 50:31.100
They don't promote it.

50:31.100 --> 50:34.780
Well, if a tree falls in the woods and no one's around to hear it, does it really make

50:34.780 --> 50:35.280
a sound?

50:35.840 --> 50:39.840
I guess to use a, to use a very old antiquated analogy.

50:39.840 --> 50:40.340
All right.

50:41.200 --> 50:43.760
Uh, let's get into some other news space.

50:43.760 --> 50:45.280
Can no one actually hear you scream?

50:46.720 --> 50:47.520
All right, Loki.

50:48.640 --> 50:55.440
So we talked about how Sony was planning on getting rid of the PlayStation three and Vita

50:55.440 --> 50:59.360
storefronts, and that was making people upset, of course.

50:59.360 --> 51:07.680
So thankfully Sony has decided that it's going to, uh, hold off on shutting those down.

51:07.680 --> 51:11.840
So basically upon further reflection is clear that we made the wrong decision here.

51:11.840 --> 51:16.320
So I'm happy to say we'll be keeping the PlayStation store, uh, operational for PlayStation

51:16.320 --> 51:18.800
three and PlayStation Vita devices.

51:18.800 --> 51:22.400
PSP commerce functionality will retire on July 2nd.

51:23.360 --> 51:28.880
So sorry, PSP, but you know, all your batteries are probably bloated anyways, and none of

51:28.880 --> 51:33.040
those devices work anymore, but at least the Vita and the PlayStation three though,

51:33.040 --> 51:34.720
those would be, uh, prolonged.

51:34.720 --> 51:37.440
A lot of the PSP content is on the Vita store.

51:37.440 --> 51:38.560
Am I correct in that?

51:38.560 --> 51:43.120
Like, cause yeah, cause you can get those, you can get the PSP games for the Vita.

51:43.120 --> 51:47.280
So I have a digital version of that final fantasy four PSP, which is the greatest version

51:47.280 --> 51:50.960
of that game that I bought on the Vita marketplace because it went on sale at some point for

51:50.960 --> 51:52.240
like 14 bucks or something.

51:52.240 --> 51:53.920
So I bought it like years ago.

51:53.920 --> 51:56.160
So the Vita still has a lot of the PSP content.

51:56.160 --> 52:00.320
And I think that's why you're not hearing this little footnote as much.

52:00.320 --> 52:05.360
Plus maybe people are just a little more willing to let the PSP go because how old is that

52:05.360 --> 52:05.840
thing now?

52:05.840 --> 52:07.120
Like 14 years old, probably.

52:07.760 --> 52:09.040
It's pretty old.

52:09.040 --> 52:09.520
Yeah.

52:09.520 --> 52:09.920
Yeah.

52:09.920 --> 52:12.560
So, um, too bad.

52:12.560 --> 52:14.480
You know, I really wish they would do another handheld.

52:15.120 --> 52:16.000
I know.

52:16.000 --> 52:16.240
Right.

52:16.240 --> 52:17.680
It wasn't so bad.

52:17.680 --> 52:22.560
Like Vita was trying to do some things that it probably didn't need to do.

52:22.560 --> 52:23.840
Like the back touch panel.

52:23.840 --> 52:24.320
Really?

52:24.320 --> 52:25.840
I don't think we really needed that.

52:26.320 --> 52:29.280
But like it, it was solid.

52:29.280 --> 52:33.600
I thought the Vita just had some weird shit.

52:33.600 --> 52:34.560
The V that's what I did.

52:34.560 --> 52:35.840
The Vita had some weird shit.

52:35.840 --> 52:40.880
It was the, not just the back touch panel, but things like near like no one could, I

52:40.880 --> 52:44.800
think to this day, you still can't explain how that actually worked.

52:44.800 --> 52:49.520
Whereas Nintendo did a much better job explaining street pass and those types of things.

52:49.520 --> 52:54.720
And especially with how big portable gaming is in Japan, which is only further approved

52:54.720 --> 52:57.120
by how hot cakes the switches over there.

52:57.120 --> 53:01.280
I am really surprised Sony's never tried to do another handheld and I'm surprised they

53:01.280 --> 53:04.720
gave up on the Vita as fast as they did, at least here in the US.

53:04.720 --> 53:06.880
That was just kind of, I don't know.

53:07.920 --> 53:11.520
But I suppose, you know, this is, this is a topic that, you know, is five years old

53:11.520 --> 53:12.400
at this point.

53:12.400 --> 53:15.040
Um, it's, it's, it is what it is.

53:16.080 --> 53:18.320
Are we surprised though that Sony reversed course?

53:18.320 --> 53:21.680
I have to admit, I'm a little surprised they reverse course.

53:22.400 --> 53:24.480
And I'm not, I know this sounds weird.

53:24.480 --> 53:26.080
I'm not exactly sure why they did it.

53:27.280 --> 53:29.920
Like, here's the crazy thing.

53:29.920 --> 53:35.680
And I know you're probably, you, you are probably all going, Rob, didn't you just last week

53:35.680 --> 53:38.800
talk about like the backwards compatibility and how, yes.

53:38.800 --> 53:40.000
And that is all still true.

53:40.000 --> 53:44.800
And I can still believe that and still sit here and say, I'm kind of surprised Sony backtracked

53:44.800 --> 53:49.520
because I'm not sure there's a ton, a ton of people who are going to log into their

53:49.520 --> 53:54.240
PlayStation three and Vita's and stuff and start going on a downloading binge and celebration.

53:54.480 --> 53:59.120
They might, I don't know what I, and I want to make probably should, I've got like a 500

53:59.120 --> 54:00.560
gigabyte hard drive in that.

54:00.560 --> 54:03.840
So I should, I should probably fill it up.

54:03.840 --> 54:05.680
And, and I want to make my stance clear.

54:06.240 --> 54:11.600
I, it, I, I, I, I, and I'm sure it's great that the stores are staying open so that this

54:11.600 --> 54:16.000
PlayStation one content and two content and all that stuff is accessible and playable.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.040
That is all great.

54:17.040 --> 54:18.240
What do I really want?

54:18.240 --> 54:20.160
I want that to be playable on PlayStation five.

54:20.960 --> 54:22.960
I want my library to go to PlayStation five.

54:22.960 --> 54:29.920
That, that, and that is really, you know, and if maybe Sony can cross that bridge, then

54:29.920 --> 54:35.680
they can safely probably close these old stores and, you know, they, they won't have quite

54:35.680 --> 54:37.600
the same, you know, uh, pushback.

54:38.240 --> 54:42.480
If I can play sweet code and one and two on my PlayStation five now, then I don't have

54:42.480 --> 54:44.560
to worry about the PlayStation three version.

54:44.560 --> 54:45.520
That makes sense.

54:45.520 --> 54:47.680
That's where that really comes down to.

54:47.680 --> 54:50.080
So, um, let's see.

54:50.080 --> 54:54.560
SG100 Matt points out the Vita was just getting into doing some good remote play, which would

54:54.560 --> 54:55.760
have been cool in this era.

54:55.760 --> 54:56.720
Absolutely.

54:56.720 --> 55:03.920
I, the, how quickly Sony abandoned the Vita TV thing blows my mind.

55:04.640 --> 55:08.320
Absolutely blows my mind how fast they abandoned that PlayStation TV.

55:08.320 --> 55:09.680
I wish I knew where mine was.

55:10.480 --> 55:11.760
I have one somewhere.

55:11.760 --> 55:13.040
I just don't know where it is.

55:13.520 --> 55:19.840
I honestly, if they're going to keep these stores open, Sony should really consider putting

55:19.840 --> 55:20.640
that back out.

55:21.200 --> 55:27.120
I know that sounds ridiculous, but you know, with, with the Chrome cast, the Apple TVs,

55:27.120 --> 55:31.600
the Roku's and all this stuff of the world, there is a place for, there's a place for

55:31.600 --> 55:32.880
PlayStation TV in there.

55:33.920 --> 55:34.560
I don't get it.

55:35.760 --> 55:39.600
I don't, but that was the time to jailbreak those systems too.

55:39.600 --> 55:44.080
I guess not that that's what Sony, not that that is going to be incentive for Sony to

55:44.080 --> 55:49.920
put those back out, but you know, I, I, it just blows my mind.

55:49.920 --> 55:55.440
They could have done a classic thing for PlayStation one on a Vita TV for it.

55:56.400 --> 55:59.520
Anyway, it's just not going to make sense.

55:59.520 --> 56:04.880
Well, let's talk about PlayStation decisions that I think do make a little more sense because

56:04.880 --> 56:07.920
I feel like this one came up on the show previously.

56:07.920 --> 56:12.560
And it's something being tested called the PlayStation plus video pass.

56:13.120 --> 56:18.560
Apparently this was posted on Sony's website, but it was posted in another country.

56:18.560 --> 56:24.080
I think it was, was it the, this particular story I'm looking at?

56:24.080 --> 56:25.360
Doesn't say where.

56:25.360 --> 56:29.760
So I really looked at the wrong story here, but I believe it was the Polish store.

56:31.760 --> 56:32.480
Yes, thank you.

56:32.480 --> 56:32.720
Okay.

56:32.720 --> 56:38.320
It was the Polish store that said, um, a new benefit is available for a limited time on

56:38.320 --> 56:44.400
PlayStation plus PlayStation plus video pass is a trial service that will be active.

56:44.400 --> 56:46.640
Uh, and it was really quick, I think for, for a year.

56:46.640 --> 56:53.280
So April 22nd, 2021 through 2022, this is a benefit available to PlayStation plus users

56:53.280 --> 56:54.400
in Poland.

56:54.400 --> 56:57.120
Now Sony interactive entertainment did confirm.

56:57.120 --> 56:58.720
This is something they're testing in Poland.

56:58.720 --> 57:01.520
So this is not a rumor at this point when this was first reported.

57:01.520 --> 57:03.920
This was a rumor leaked website.

57:03.920 --> 57:05.760
No, Sony has confirmed it.

57:05.760 --> 57:11.040
Um, this will allow PlayStation four and PlayStation five users in Poland, which is their test

57:11.040 --> 57:17.520
market to access over 20 movie and television shows from Sony pictures as part of PlayStation

57:17.520 --> 57:21.840
plus subscriptions with more content that they're going to add every three months.

57:21.840 --> 57:26.960
And if you actually look at a screenshot from the Polish website for PlayStation, you see

57:26.960 --> 57:32.640
zombie land, double tap venom, you know, and other things that are related to Sony.

57:32.640 --> 57:39.120
Uh, so a way to, um, I guess increase, uh, the, the value of being a PlayStation plus

57:39.120 --> 57:39.840
member.

57:39.840 --> 57:43.840
And to this, I say this makes an awful lot of sense.

57:43.840 --> 57:46.080
In fact, I, I, so correct me if I'm wrong.

57:47.040 --> 57:51.360
Didn't we bring this up on the show a few months ago about how could Sony compete more

57:51.360 --> 57:52.480
with game pass?

57:52.480 --> 57:57.360
And I swear I said, or one of us said, Sony is also a movie company.

57:57.360 --> 57:58.560
Why aren't they leveraging that?

57:59.200 --> 57:59.920
Well, guess what?

58:00.960 --> 58:05.600
Here that plan apparently was in the works and here they are, they are leveraging that

58:05.600 --> 58:06.240
side of things.

58:06.800 --> 58:08.560
Now, let me ask this question.

58:08.560 --> 58:09.760
Does it matter?

58:09.760 --> 58:13.440
I asked that to our chatters over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

58:13.440 --> 58:14.720
I asked that to my cohost.

58:15.360 --> 58:18.800
How does free movies from Sony entertainment?

58:18.800 --> 58:21.280
Does that sweeten the pot a little bit?

58:21.280 --> 58:25.440
Loki, let's start with, you know, not really because, and it's just because I have so many

58:25.440 --> 58:27.440
streaming services I subscribed to already.

58:27.440 --> 58:31.840
Like for example, venom is supposed to be on a dizzy plus here pretty soon.

58:31.840 --> 58:36.480
Um, it's nice to have something else in there though.

58:36.480 --> 58:37.200
Like it would be cool.

58:37.200 --> 58:41.280
Like if they just said, Hey, you get, you know, these two games for the month of like

58:41.280 --> 58:46.160
may and you get this movie, you know, added to your library and you get an increasingly

58:46.160 --> 58:50.880
large library of movies and games, then yes, that would seem like it's sweetening the pot,

58:50.880 --> 58:56.640
but also at the same time, I don't really care because I, there's not anything that

58:56.640 --> 59:01.840
like, I need to go back and see what they need to do is they just need to offer this

59:01.840 --> 59:06.640
stuff so that it's more like, they need the, they need to drop the price of those movies

59:06.640 --> 59:12.640
down, um, to the point where it's just kind of like a, you know, impulse buy.

59:12.640 --> 59:16.880
And so people can build libraries like they have on steam where it's just like these large

59:16.880 --> 59:21.040
libraries of things that no one plays, but then you can acquire all these movies as well.

59:21.600 --> 59:23.200
Um, that might be cool.

59:23.920 --> 59:24.240
Okay.

59:24.800 --> 59:27.760
Uh, looking in chat as some responses there, and then I'll ask dark soccer.

59:27.760 --> 59:32.640
Um, so, uh, bonds double six is talking about you're right with their music, film and games,

59:32.640 --> 59:35.600
crunchy roll and funimation bundle it into the monthly sub.

59:35.600 --> 59:38.960
You can go from playing a game to anime on the same system and so forth.

59:38.960 --> 59:41.120
Pele Hanumea says could be cool.

59:41.120 --> 59:44.480
Uh, DJ Rama S is also bringing up the anime streaming services.

59:44.480 --> 59:46.640
It could sweeten the pot, but meh.

59:46.640 --> 59:48.960
Uh, act deaf says more bang for your buck.

59:48.960 --> 59:53.840
Uh, SJ100 Matt pointing out that Sony and Disney has that, have that new deal for Spider-Man

59:53.840 --> 59:56.880
and other Marvel to be shared on their respective services.

59:56.880 --> 59:58.960
That was a thing that just came up this week.

59:58.960 --> 01:00:02.240
And you got to wonder, is there something with the timing there?

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.360
Hmm.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:07.840
Uh, Quest Buster says, I guess we'll see if it matters in a year if they stick to it.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:10.480
That's how long they will be testing this in Poland.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:14.800
Um, I, I, I feel like the test is actually a lot shorter than that.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.040
Yeah, I read the website.

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.400
I saw what it said.

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:22.880
I feel like if this is going to happen, we're going to hear about it at E3.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.760
Well, Sony doesn't do E3, but you guys know what I mean.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:30.960
That time frame, whatever Sony's E3 equivalent is, we're going to hear more about this if

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.800
they plan to expand it beyond Poland.

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:33.760
And I think they will.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.040
Why wouldn't they?

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.520
It maybe it's a technical thing.

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.360
Maybe that's what they're kind of also testing in Poland.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:40.080
I don't know.

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.240
Um, but I really feel like they will.

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:49.600
Um, Bonds 006 also elaborates saying Sony is sitting, Sony is sitting on film, TV shows,

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:50.800
music games, and anime.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.560
Bundle it into the current sub they have.

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:55.760
PlayStation Plus price it less than Microsoft.

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:58.560
DJ Rama is suggesting they call it the Sony pass.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:02.800
SSJ100 Matt says, I think the pandemic spread this process up.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.840
Quest Buster says the E3 bombshell is prepping.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.600
I don't know if I call this a bombshell.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:12.880
It's a bombshell if there's more to it that makes it more competitive with game pass.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.680
Like maybe there's another side of this we're not seeing yet.

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:19.600
And those rumors that Sony is cooking up something to really compete with game pass.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:23.200
I'm not talking about PlayStation now, but to really compete with it on that same level.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:27.280
If that all drops at once, then that's a bombshell in my opinion.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:31.360
But the movies in PlayStation Plus is just kind of a, oh, neat.

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.680
I don't know if I call that a bombshell.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.040
I'd call that a firework.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:39.360
It's pretty dark soccer.

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.800
I wanted to get your opinion.

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:45.600
Do movies sweeten the pot of these game subscription services like PlayStation Plus?

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.600
You're muted, by the way.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.240
Dark soccer.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:50.960
I can't hear you.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:51.460
Sorry.

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.960
And she's fixing that crap.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:55.520
That's okay.

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:55.760
Hi.

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:58.240
I was like, yeah, it's neat.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:03.840
I don't really feel one way or another about it.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:11.200
It's still not a service I'm using, but it could attract some people.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.000
There's always that.

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.600
And if it attracts them, then happy.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:20.080
I would rather see a big package service come in, just like some of the others are saying.

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:24.080
So something that invokes the music and the anime and all that as well.

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:25.840
Exactly.

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:31.120
That would be a little more like, that makes me think of something like Apple's thing.

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.000
Is it Apple Plus?

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.240
Apple one.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:34.800
That's it.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:39.200
They bundle it like it's, it's the fitness and the music and the news and all that all

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.360
in one for like a pretty low price.

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.600
All things considered when you look at everything individually.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:48.400
So like if Sony were to make a similar move with a Sony one or I don't know what, you

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:48.880
know what I mean?

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.000
Whatever they call it.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.120
That would be very interesting.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:51.620
I think.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:03:00.400
Yeah, no, I, I honestly, I seem to really like having those combination bundles like

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:04.240
that, especially if you're giving it, especially something in there, something that people

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:09.600
are going to use, you can really, you know, people would get a lot of value out of it

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:15.200
if it's got those multiple services, but still, you know, I'm also a fan of having like an

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.120
individual thing you can subscribe to.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:21.680
Like if you just want the movies, you just want this so that you're not roped into paying

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:25.680
for a big thing with only what, you know, that has one out of three services you're

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.240
going to use.

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:26.880
Right.

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:27.380
Yeah.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:28.420
All right.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.260
Great.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:34.960
Looking one more comment here from Bonds006 in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:41.440
Sony can leverage the US market by bringing over the content that was marketed to Asia,

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.760
India, China, Japan, et cetera.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.320
It can go from games, anime, Bollywood, music, films, TV show.

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.640
The anime audience is very much tied to games.

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:55.680
That's a really good thought is that making maybe foreign content more accessible because

01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:00.000
you're right, there's absolutely an audience that would love to have like a more robust

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:06.720
like Bollywood film library or, you know, movies from the like China and other countries

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.560
in Asia, those places you mentioned.

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:12.080
I think that would really appeal to some people.

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:17.360
Some people might see that as a niche thing, but I think that's great.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:23.360
You know, there's probably a lot of crossover between like gamers, you know, and folks that

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.480
would be into some of that more independent and foreign film.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.600
So we'll see.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:28.100
Yeah.

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:28.880
All right.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.320
We'll see what Sony really does.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:35.360
I mean, we can sit here and go, wouldn't this be great with licensing cost?

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.560
How's it going to get paid for?

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:36.720
Right.

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.080
Movies don't make themselves.

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:39.040
So anyway.

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:39.680
All right.

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:40.160
Moving on.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.920
You've got a really timely and interesting thing.

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.040
Science story, huh?

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:46.580
Yeah.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:49.360
When I saw it, I thought it was very, very interesting.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:55.920
There are clinical trial plans for clinical trials to go on to see a video game therapy

01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:00.560
can help with adults who are suffering from COVID related brain fog.

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.600
And we know what this condition is.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.800
It's the best way to describe it.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:09.760
It's just this confusion and general malaise of the mind of attention, you know?

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:17.280
And it's very similar to the therapies that have been used for ADHD treatment in the past.

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:21.200
Um, but yeah, there are people who have, uh,

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:29.120
who've recovered from COVID who have this residual cognitive and functional, uh, difficulty.

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:34.160
So the trial is being conducted by, uh, Weill Cornell medicine.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:43.120
Um, also with a Vanderbilt university medical center, um, to see how effective, uh, a game,

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:51.440
uh, called, uh, AKL T zero one, um, on will help patients recover from, uh, this brain fog.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.480
Um, they're going to include a hundred patients over the age of 18 who have shown cognitive

01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:03.680
impairment, um, in at least, uh, one measure of attention and executive function.

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:07.120
Um, half will receive treatment.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.560
Half will, will be a control group.

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:12.640
Um, they are set, they're going to be completing five missions a day,

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:19.120
five days a week, and it's about 25 minutes of, uh, game, uh, of gameplay every day.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:24.320
And it will go on for six weeks with four weeks of post-treatment followup.

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:32.720
Um, so I think it's pretty, pretty interesting, you know, and I have to say that this brain fog

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:42.480
that people are exhibiting after, uh, COVID, uh, infection is very, very similar to what people

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:50.560
like me who have ME, um, experience, you know, just with our everyday fatigue.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:53.920
Um, it's just really fascinating.

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:58.640
I thought the, um, ADHD, uh, parallel was very interesting too, because I've,

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:01.200
I've heard a lot of that defined, defined as brain fog too.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:05.760
I would still, honestly, I kind of would put it a little bit more just from the people I've

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:10.400
talked to you who are dealing with it more along the lines of what I have, um, myalgic

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:16.080
encephalomyelitis, myelitis, sorry, I always mispronounce that part, um, or chronic fatigue

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:22.240
syndrome, where it's not always necessarily a matter of being able to pay attention.

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:28.960
It's being fogged out of it, you know, like you're too tired to focus on anything.

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:34.080
Yeah. You know, um, these, uh, these long haul kinds of symptoms, this is really going to be

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:39.200
interesting to see how, you know, we, we've got the vaccines now and hopefully we're on our way

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:45.280
to vastly minimizing COVID. I think it would be, um, a little bit too silly to say something like

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:50.880
eradicating COVID. That's not something, yeah, unless you can somehow get the entire planet to

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:53.520
take a vaccine at the same time. I don't think it's going to go away.

01:07:54.240 --> 01:08:00.000
So let's also be real. We've already had one mutation of it. Yeah. Sorry. Two mutations.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.960
Oh, more than that. Yeah. Yeah. But anyway, there's two, there's two more active strains

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:10.800
out there right now. But my, my point is, is that, you know, even if we get COVID to a manageable

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:15.680
level where it really is like a seasonal flu, let's say, you know, and we're dealing with it

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:19.600
in similar capacities, we're not having to shut things down because we have a way to kind of get

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:23.360
it. I think it's going to be interesting to see kind of the shift turn to how we deal with some

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:28.480
of these long haul systems and really treating COVID. There's been a lot of talks about

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:34.000
preventing COVID, but we haven't talked a lot about treating COVID and surely scientists are

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.600
working on that. And they've been working on it since the very beginning. And that's where you

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:42.720
had the talks about, you know, that, that drug that, you know, who was saying was the miracle

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:47.680
drug and no, but that whole discussion came out of, you know, the, you know, the, you know,

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:53.040
but that whole discussion came from treating COVID and how do you do that? And there's going to be

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:58.320
more talk like that in the future too. So I just think that's interesting. And also, you know,

01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:04.480
not just a miracle drug, but therapeutic, you know, a therapeutic kind of treatment like you

01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:10.080
might have for somebody who has a physical accident or a stroke or something that involves,

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:13.280
you know, physical rehabilitation. I think that's very interesting that that is something that

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:17.520
they're kind of talking about with COVID. That's what this is. It's this video game therapy is

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:22.720
a type of physical rehabilitation. It really is. It's brain training. I mean,

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:27.360
really is what this is brain training. Yeah. So very interesting. Very, very interesting.

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:31.760
All right. DJ Rama S in chat says, and more people are going out because of the vaccines.

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:37.440
Slow down people. Yeah. You got to. Yeah. I mean, today I will, today you got to wear your masks.

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:43.680
You still have to minimize content. Today is my full 5g activation day. Yay. It's been two weeks

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:49.440
since the second shot, but, um, you're not going to see me running to a crowded bar anytime soon.

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:55.440
And when I'm not, I ain't ready for that yet. Um, but I've already, I will, I will like to

01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:01.040
see my other vaccinated friends as their 5g fully activates and give them a big hug. And that I,

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:06.320
that I will be able to do, and that will feel good. Well, and I've just, you know, like for

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:12.640
my, my, uh, charity group for the sisters, I've been flat out two weeks. I'm not going to have

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:16.160
the meeting with you all for another two weeks. And that's if everybody at that meeting is

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:23.360
vaccinated. And I still, I know I mentioned on the last show, right? Allen got scheduled for

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:29.200
a shot. So Allen got his first shot this week. So he, he got to join team Pfizer with dark Sakura.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:33.440
So I don't know how that worked out, but, uh, that we have different vaccines in the same household,

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:39.760
but whatever he took, he took what they gave him. So that's that. So the countdown is on for that.

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:44.000
All right. Anyway, um, let's move on. Let's talk about, uh, our next story,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:52.400
which I believe is Loki's. So Microsoft is, um, went ahead and added that FPS boost

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:59.360
to a few more games now. So a lot of these are EA, well, it's actually as to say all EA titles. Um,

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:06.080
so now there's about, it looks like 12 new titles that are supporting 120 Hertz.

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:11.680
So battlefield for Titan fall, Titan fall to battlefront battlefront two plants versus

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:18.560
zombies, garden warfare and garden warfare two, as well as a battle for the neighbor Ville, um,

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:25.520
battlefield one battlefield five mirrors edge catalysts and unraveled two. And then for CS

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:32.000
solitude, they added 60 Hertz support as well. And that's on the series X and S. So, uh, that's

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:39.440
a pretty nice enhancement for those titles. Yeah. Uh, I wonder if that had kind of a priority

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:43.440
because they have that agreement with game pass and everything where EA play as a part of game

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:48.800
pass. Yeah, I bet. I bet that plays anyway. Yeah. So, and, and we just talked earlier in the show

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:53.520
about how increased frame rate, especially for a lot of the type of games that EA likes to make

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:59.120
can be very helpful for some people. I'm assuming that a lot of that all probably got, uh, upgraded

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:04.160
because it isn't like everything they have run on frostbite anyways. So like making enhancement

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:08.800
for one to run at 120 Hertz and you probably apply it to everything kind of like how they did

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:12.000
with like backwards compatibility. You get one game to work with that and you can get a bunch

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.920
of other ones to work. So maybe that was the, you know, maybe that's why, I don't know if everything

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:25.440
runs on prospect, but I know a lot of their games run on frostbite. Oh, so it's kind of like they,

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:31.040
they made the engine work better essentially. Yeah. I mean, that's why I would think, but

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:36.640
no, it makes a lot of sense for Andromeda. Yeah. Right. And I was thinking Mass Effect as well,

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:39.760
but they probably don't want to take Andromeda is one thing, but they probably don't want to

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:43.120
take away from that remaster coming out. They don't want to be like, Oh, we improved Mass Effect

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:46.320
one, two, and three. So don't worry about that remaster. No, no, no, no, no. They want your

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:53.840
money. They're doing it on, um, on unreal though. Yeah. Um, I think so. I think it's whatever the

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:59.680
old games used. It is. Yeah. So, um, yeah, you're right. They switched to frostbite with, uh,

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:05.120
Andromeda. So that's kind of a different thing, I think so. Yeah. But also a lot of those games that

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:10.800
Loki mentioned kind of date back to the three 60 era. And I think with, um, you know, Andromeda

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:14.560
being a little newer from the Xbox one era, it probably already runs pretty well. And there's

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:20.560
not a lot that they can do to it. So there's that. All right. Well, I'll have to check out some of

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:24.720
those games. I've been meaning to go back and play garden warfare again. That one's kind of fun.

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:32.320
All right. Moving on. Let's talk about, um, this, uh, interesting development in, uh, some former

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:37.520
folks that used to be with bungee studios. Uh, of course, you know, bungee is the team that made

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:44.480
halo back in the day. Uh, destiny is a big thing that they're working on. Well, uh, firewalk studios

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:50.080
is a company that's made up of, uh, or I should say the founders of firewalk studio worked on

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:55.520
destiny previously. And it was announced this week that Sony interactive entertainment has picked up

01:13:55.520 --> 01:14:00.480
the rights to an upcoming game from this studio. Of course, we don't know what it is because this

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:07.200
studio hasn't announced anything yet, but this sure seems timed well for June, doesn't it.

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:14.080
And an announcement there. Hmm. Anyway, there was a PlayStation blog post and in the blog post,

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:20.240
Tony Sue, uh, from firewalk studio, the head of that says for our team, the opportunity to create

01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:25.120
new worlds and inspire more amazing moments for players around the world is the fire and ambition

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:29.840
that keeps us going. The PlayStation team has a deep love and respect for the medium of games

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:34.800
and some of the best expertise and capabilities in the world to help make big ambitions a reality.

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:41.120
Obviously we have no idea what they're working on. You could assume it's a destiny like game,

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:47.760
but then again, you know, take a look at Halo and then take a look at destiny and kind of like how

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:52.800
those games like destiny kind of has some of the, like, yes, they're both first person shooters,

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:57.200
but they're very different and how they work. So it'd be very interesting to see kind of like

01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:02.640
what that evolution continues to, uh, with firewalk studios. And of course we're even

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:07.440
assuming it will continue to be a first person shooter. I think it's a safe bet. I don't suddenly,

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:13.120
Oh, they're going to do an RPG. I, well, destiny has RPG ish elements. Who knows anything's

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:18.800
possible, I guess, but I would expect it's going to rely a bit on, uh, probably some of their past

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:24.640
expertise. Anyway, the studio was formed in 2018. So they've been working on something for a little

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:31.040
while. Um, let's see, uh, uh, Sue is the lead of this. Uh, he was the general manager and

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:36.800
senior vice president of destiny, uh, over at Activision, uh, Riley, Ryan, Eli, uh, if I'm

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.720
saying that right, maybe Eli, sorry for the butchering of the name. There is a game director

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:45.840
and was a former bungee creative director, executive producer, Elena Siegman, uh, was

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:50.880
a producer on guitar hero two and Bioshock infinite. And then destiny as well. That's

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:56.800
quite the diverse resume, isn't it? That's it. Yeah. The cast on that one's pretty impressive.

01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:00.640
Yeah. So that's, uh, that's pretty cool. So anyway, other people at the studio have worked

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:05.280
on things like call of duty, apex legends, mass effect. Apparently they have some folks from there

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:10.320
and halo. So we'll see what they come up with. That could be very interesting. I'm hoping,

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:14.560
I'm hoping for, uh, the executive producer there to bring some of her guitar,

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:20.160
guitar hero to influence. How about a music based destiny game? I'd be into that.

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:27.840
Uh, I still never got into destiny. So it's, it's not bad. Like, uh, you know,

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:34.320
so I know that's a really whack, uh, recommendation. I don't play a lot of first person shooters. I do

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:38.400
get into halo once in a while. Um, there's obviously, you know, dead by daylight, but

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:41.920
that's not a shooter, you know, I don't get into a lot of the shooter. Yeah. Yeah. I don't get,

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:47.040
unless you play gunslinger. I don't get into a lot of those. I don't get into a harpoon,

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:51.920
but you know what I mean? I don't get into a lot of those first person shooter games,

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:56.640
but well, I liked overwatch. That's a first person sorta it's, but again, overwatch is

01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:00.960
really different because there's so many, like you, not everybody actually shoots in that game.

01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:06.480
If you're playing somebody with a sword or, you know, healing with a, like a Lucio or

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:11.440
was Mass Effect multiplayer third person or first person.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:15.600
It was that same over the shoulder that the rest of the game was.

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:19.600
Okay. Okay. I couldn't remember for a moment, but I was like,

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:22.960
I was just trying to think yet. Didn't I play other first person? Yeah.

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:27.680
Yeah. So, Oh yeah, that's true. Sorry. Act says Lucio still shoots. That's right. There's the

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:31.920
little gun that, but I think of the healing bubbles and things, but anyway, you guys know

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:37.040
what I mean? I don't get into a lot of those games, but destiny for one, it's really pretty

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:40.640
now that it's on a series X and I'm sure the PlayStation five version is the same thing.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:46.320
They're both very pretty. I'm sure. Um, and it's, I like it because it does have the light RPG

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:50.160
elements in it. It doesn't feel like you're just shooty, shooty, bang, bang, kill them all, kill

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:55.120
them all. There's quests to do. There's goals to work towards. There's, I like the idea, the

01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:00.720
concept of raids in a first person shooter, where you're basically going in into an instance thing

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:05.520
with other people and they made it a very PVE experience. I think that's probably the best

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:11.280
accolade I could give destiny is that if you don't like first person shooters because of PVP

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:18.320
elements, destiny did a really good job making a PVE first person game. The PVP stuff is there too,

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:23.360
but the PVE is pretty, pretty top notch in that game. So that's what I would say about destiny.

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:30.800
All right. Anyhow, um, let's, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm loving active salty commentary on

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:37.280
Overwatch. Uh, Brigitte used to heal. Now she does nothing with all those nerves she got. I see.

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:45.440
All right. Uh, moving on, let's get to our next story. Um, oh, this one's an interesting, uh,

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:50.000
game thing, dark soccer, another kind of entry story that I think is interesting.

01:18:50.960 --> 01:19:01.280
For sure. Um, so this actually goes a lot into, um, I would say intellectual property rights.

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:08.720
Um, and indeed I did find this on a report about intellectual property. Um, there is, uh,

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:18.320
argument now on the use of tattoos in video games. Um, there was a, uh, decision that was made

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:24.960
regarding a professional wrestlers tattoos in, um, a video game in one of the, the take to,

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:33.840
uh, WWE 2k, uh, games. So basically, um, the wrestler in question is Randy Orton and he's

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:40.960
got tattoos that were done by Catherine Alexander. Um, she had inked those, uh,

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:50.400
six different ones, um, on him, uh, between 2002 and 2008. Um, so he licensed his likeness,

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:58.640
uh, to be used in the game, but she was arguing that, uh, because her artwork wasn't licensed

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:05.920
to be used in the game, uh, that they had violated, uh, copyright that they had used her,

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:14.400
uh, basically copyright infringement, um, with using unauthorized, uh, uh, artwork with an implied

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:22.480
license. Um, well basically, and that is what take two is, is moved for summary judgment. Um,

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:26.560
again, that they were authorized to use it by an implied license and that they were using it under

01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:38.320
fair use. Um, and that, uh, it constitutes a de minimus part of, uh, WWE 2k. Um, so yeah,

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:48.480
they had a big, uh, argument over it, um, in court. Um, so with, um, the implied license,

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:56.080
the court found that two parts of that were satisfied partially due to conflicting testimony

01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:03.520
about agreement to forms, copywriting the tattoo. Um, they ruled that that should be heard by a

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:08.720
jury. Um, the second defense, the four factors that were necessary to establish fair use is that

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:12.400
the purpose and character of the use of the nature of the copyrighted work, the mountain

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:18.080
sustainability of the plaintiff's work and the effect of, uh, of the market of the copyrighted

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:28.160
work. Um, and so basically, uh, they found that take two did not meet the standard, uh,

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:36.800
necessary requirements. And then finally, um, they argued that the, the use of tattoos were,

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:43.200
uh, de de minimus, which, um, what de minimus means, uh, it's actually short for a de minimus

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:48.480
non current Lex, which is the law does not concern itself with trifles, meaning that it

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:54.320
serious. And it is legal term. No, I know it's funny. Yeah. Maybe I should just like,

01:21:54.320 --> 01:22:05.600
have that tattooed on me. Um, anyway, um, so, um, the, uh, they were unsuccessful in arguing that

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:11.200
because it was an open question as to whether the seventh circuit recognized de minimus as a valid

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:18.560
defense. And even so, uh, they couldn't see that take two met the standard. So the court's decision

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:23.520
was to deny the defense's motion for summary judgment effectively, uh, which effectively

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:34.880
means that anyone with a tattoo does not control all use of their likeness. So this is going to be

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:42.800
going to jury. Interesting. You know, and I, I can kind of see it both ways. I really can because,

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:47.040
you know, I, I kind of get like, if it was her original artwork that she, you know,

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:50.880
did specifically for him and now he's out basically reselling it and, you know, having

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:56.480
any games and stuff, then I kind of get that. But at the same time, like the dude's on TV,

01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:01.040
he's a wrestler. I'm sure, you know, a lot of wrestlers end up going to star in movies.

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:05.280
If he's in a movie and that tattoo is visible in the movie, does she get money? I don't think

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:11.280
that's how it works. Yeah. So it's, it's, but it's fascinating to me. I, and I, I feel like

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:16.960
this is something that needs to be established in the tattoo artist who they're tattooing

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:25.280
relationship from the get go. And I think because of this case, you may see like this have

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:30.320
repercussions for anyone who gets a tattoo. I think it could be very interesting. Brought

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:35.200
up a point that I was going to is that I look at it as it's technically commissioned to work.

01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:42.720
When like me as a graphic designer, if someone commissioned my work or my services,

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:50.400
you know, Hey, I would like you to design this banner for my website. The moment I have

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:56.400
delivered the artwork, it becomes their property. It is no longer my, I can use my,

01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:01.600
I can use it in my portfolio. You know, I can certainly use it, but I can't put my name on it.

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:13.120
You know, whereas if someone commissioned a painting from me and I painted it, then yeah,

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:19.840
I reckon that would be kind of a gray area. You know, that if they were gonna say film in their

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:28.320
house and my artwork was there, then I may ask for, you know, a little something because

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:32.320
my artwork was seen because as I like to say, artists die of exposure.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:44.400
But at the same time, you know, I would put this right in the range of commissioned work.

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:48.720
When you make that commission and you part ways with that commission,

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:55.600
that commission is no longer yours. You can put it in your portfolio and tattoo it on other people

01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:03.600
unless someone else designed that tattoo that you did. Like for example, if I designed a tattoo

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:09.680
and I went and had someone put it on, you know, put that on my body, they cannot go and put it

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:16.800
on somebody else without paying me for it. That's how it works.

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:21.680
What would you say would happen if this wrestler tried to sell the NFT of his tattoo?

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:23.360
I'm just kidding. Don't answer that. All right.

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:31.600
Oh, I mean, actually, I'll be honest in that case, if he had like a scan of it or something,

01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.880
uh huh. He can't sell that.

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:42.560
Okay. Yeah. I think this whole thing is legit. Like jokes, cheap jokes about things that are

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:47.440
big in pop culture right now aside, I think it's interesting about the precedent this could

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:53.360
actually set again, like for, you know, um, because there's a lot of tattoo artists who

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:56.880
are going to be looking at this, I'm sure. And probably never thought about that question

01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:01.120
because not everyone is necessarily a tattoo artist to the stars, so to speak.

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:04.640
But I'm sure there's a lot of tattoo artists going, what if I did tattoo someone famous,

01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:09.120
like what would happen there where everybody's seeing, you know, what I did. So I think it's

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:11.600
going to be very interesting to see what the ramifications of that end up being.

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:18.080
What I see is going to happen actually, is that I think that there are going to be, um,

01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:25.040
when you go to be professionally tattooed, that there's going to be, um, a license paperwork

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:29.840
drawn up. You know, and now that I'm sitting here thinking about it, you know, because I always kind

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:33.520
of go like, well, why are games being treated different than movies? And, and as I'm sitting

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:36.240
here thinking about it, as you're kind of explaining a lot of these things, I think

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:40.560
what it really comes down to is that in a movie or whatever you're filming it in a TV show, you're

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:45.840
filming it, you got a camera at it. And this is a recreation. Bingo. It's a recreation. It's tracing.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:51.600
You are, you're, you're, you're tracing the tattoo. You know what I mean though? You're basically,

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:59.040
you're recreating it. You're making a copy of it. And that's where the very interesting dilemma lies.

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:06.640
But it could also be considered derivative work. Yeah. You know, there's also other things under,

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:11.440
I think another, they wouldn't have a creative common license on it, but there are like other

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:21.920
rules, like having something be more than 50% changed in artwork, for example. Um, but I,

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:29.520
I could imagine being a tattoo artist who wants their name out there better, who wants their

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:35.760
work protected. I understand it from the artist's point of view, certainly as an artist myself,

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:44.960
but I also understand that when the product has left my hand, it belongs to the body that

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:50.640
it's on. It doesn't belong off of that body. They can't recreate it themselves to sell it.

01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:56.240
And so that's, I think, where that murky ground is. I think that I wouldn't be,

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:01.840
I don't know. Yeah. Um, let me get some other comments. That is a little bit murky.

01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:06.720
See a Tiberian chat says, has a tattoo artist done other celebrities? Well, I'm sure there's

01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:11.120
plenty of celebrities that have had tattoos. Um, has this person also run into other issues

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:15.760
before? I think what's happening here is that this is a case where the realism of video games

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:18.880
is starting to bring up these issues. You know, think about this is a relatively new

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:24.960
This is a relatively newer thing because when we were recreating wrestlers on the Nintendo,

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:29.600
on the Super Nintendo, hell, even the PlayStation and kind of the PlayStation 2,

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:36.640
the graphical fidelity to recreate the tattoos with such precision and such specificity or

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:43.040
whatever specificness didn't, didn't really exist. The tattoo was a pixel. Precision. That's

01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:47.760
a good way to put it. Thank you. Now that we're talking about PlayStation 4 and 5 and lifelike

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:53.280
stuff, I think this, this is why this is coming up now for the first time. It's just interesting.

01:28:55.120 --> 01:29:00.880
Act Defton chat says, let's say that if it were like all the fan made work you see at

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:05.920
artists alleys and conventions, we know it's not legal, but we just ignore it and support the

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:11.920
artist. That is very true. Um, that is, well, and here's the thing you have to keep in mind with all

01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:16.400
that. If you, if that's your business, you know, cool. And yes, we want to support artists and all

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:22.320
that stuff. Um, but you have to realize if Blizzard wanted to shut down your Overwatch art,

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:27.280
if, or your Warcraft art, or if, um, you know, whatever it is, whatever your fandom is,

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:33.520
if they wanted to come in and shut that down, they can. So in a sense, you're living on borrowed time

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:36.880
whenever you're incorporating someone else's trademark or copyright, you're right. Most

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:41.520
companies let it slip under the radar because it's just, it's, it's too expensive to chase.

01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:46.960
It doesn't make them look good. This is a case where for the bigger companies exposure, you know,

01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:52.720
would Overwatch be able to do something like the Overwatch league without the huge fandom that it

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:58.800
has. And what's a part of that fandom fan art, right? So I think these companies very carefully

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:03.200
have to weigh something like that, but look at a company like Disney to Disney's incredibly,

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:08.400
incredibly litigious, but usually if it's something, you know, under the table, again,

01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:13.600
they're not going to go after a lot of, uh, uh, personal creators and stuff, but they might,

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:17.920
and you kind of always have to live with that in the back of your mind, just like most of us that

01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:22.400
stream on Twitch, you know, what we do here at VOG is a little different because it's pretty much,

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:26.960
you know, it's us on camera and all that stuff, but there may come a day for, for things like,

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:31.120
let's say dark soccer streaming dead by daylight. There may come a day where behavior comes in and

01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:36.880
says, you know what? We want the money. And that's, that's a whole, and that thing's been bubbling

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:41.920
under for a long time, by the way, that specific example, I believe behavior has openly said,

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:47.120
we don't care if you stream it, you know, in that whole thing. But my example of we're living on

01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:55.840
borrowed time and all that is I think still relevant. So anyway, um, Amethyst Rose, which

01:30:55.840 --> 01:31:03.120
points out fan art is to a point free advertising. Yeah. Yes. But it is, we are kind of saying,

01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:08.720
as I said, it's, it's exposure, but it's, it's the inverse because it's now you're trying to

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:13.360
support the indie artist, but the big company, they're not going to miss it type of thing.

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:18.880
So it's, it's, it's interesting. And I want to be clear. I've bought fan art at stuff. I,

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:24.720
I like it as gifts. Like when, um, when Alan was super into Overwatch, I bought him some posters.

01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:29.600
I think I picked him up at magfest actually that I thought were really cute. Um, and so, you know,

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:33.120
I, I love fan art and stuff. I don't want to see that change, but I'm just saying

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:37.840
these sorts of legal questions. It kind of brings up all these questions about

01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:44.880
we might be on borrowed time y'all. Anyway, let's move on to something a little more timeless and

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:51.120
talk about retro consoles. Loki. Yeah, this is pretty cool. So, uh, Evercade has been around

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:56.560
for a while. It's like this handheld device that plays these cartridges with collections of

01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:01.040
different retro games. And some indie games, actually, they actually have one that has a

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:06.480
bunch of nest maker, any S games in there. So it's pretty cool to kind of, it covers everything.

01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:12.720
Well, now they're actually doing this new system called the Evercade vs, which is going to be

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:17.440
basically taking this portable console and making it into like a home console.

01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:22.320
So the difference here is that there's going to be two cartridge slots. So now you can have two

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:27.040
different cartridges loaded in at a time to select games from they're going to have support

01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:34.640
up to four controllers and, um, also wifi and 10 AP support as well for your TV. And it's supposed

01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:40.160
to be coming out later this year to around November for, I think a hundred dollars, not

01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:44.160
certain about the price on that. Uh, yeah, a hundred dollars. So that's actually about the

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:49.040
same price as their handheld was with a few games thrown in, but it's pretty cool. They've got like

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:56.640
lots of collections from like Atari and Amco, Data East, all sorts of things. So, um, it's

01:32:56.640 --> 01:33:00.720
interesting. I don't know if I'm picking it up, but it's definitely, you know, along the lines of

01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:07.680
like, if you're, you know, looking at console, say kind of like the Amico or something like that,

01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:12.160
that's playing, you know, more of this couch co-op stuff. You're going to get a lot of that

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:18.080
from the Evercade as well. Hmm. That's uh, it sounds like a lot of fun. I like the,

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:22.240
I like the homebrew stuff kind of built into it a little bit there. Loki, is that a way to get more

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:26.640
copies of a pixel poops out there? You got to get team up one of these consoles. Totally do that.

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:32.480
If they wanted to put it on one of those things. I know for example, there's a one cartridge that

01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:40.560
has, it does have a few different, um, NES home brew stuff. So there's a flea. I know it's one of

01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:45.440
the games that's made with nest maker. That's in there. There's also the, I'm trying to think of

01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:51.120
the name now. I have it on itch too. Um, it's basically with a doodle world is another one

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:55.360
that they have on there. And I think there was a couple other NES maker games that were part of

01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:59.120
that. And it was, uh, the, I'm trying to think of the actual collection. It's like something

01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:04.000
Indies collection that they had, but, um, there's like four games on one cartridge. That's pretty

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:10.800
cool. So yeah, I mean, sure. I will put it on one of those collections in a heartbeat.

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:15.280
The question, I don't think anyone's going to ask for that. I was going to say there's

01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:19.440
probably as many people listening to this podcast as bought your game. So, uh, don't

01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:23.600
hold your breath that Evercade is listening. Yeah, I'm not holding any breath whatsoever,

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:29.200
but like, yeah, absolutely. We love all 12 of you who listen. We really do hugs and kisses.

01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:33.920
All right. Um, pixel pocket is talking about Evercade and chat saying the Evercade portable

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:39.040
is pretty fun. I like that their carts always come with five games minimum. There's a mega cat

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:44.320
studios cart that has various home brew games. There's also like indie heroes collection.

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:48.960
I think that does sound pretty good. I think we reported on this one that they had. Yeah.

01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:51.920
I think we reported this on this once and I kind of, it kind of fell off my radar,

01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:56.800
but I think that I love that concept of we're still making cartridges in a new way with the

01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:01.520
retro stuff. I think that's pretty rad actually. Yeah. And then they've got all sorts of like

01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:06.400
things in there. There's, um, I'm trying to see the one that they had to actually had all those

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:10.800
cool, uh, home brew games. So I think it was, yeah, it was the indie heroes one. So that's

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:17.440
the one that has flea. Uh, I believe doodle world's in there. Um, I don't recognize the

01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:22.400
other games, but I know there's like at least three or four, uh, nest maker games in there.

01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:28.320
Plus they've got a collection from code masters. Uh, the Atari link stuff is in there. Um,

01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:36.080
lots of cool stuff. So yeah, I, I, they have like, I think like 280 games on the system right now.

01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:42.320
So it's, it's definitely, um, interesting. Okay, cool. All right. Uh, let's move on.

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:46.160
We've talked about blizzard a lot. Maybe they've been on my mind because I knew this story was

01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:51.440
coming and this has to do with a pretty big personality over at blizzard leaving the company.

01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:55.360
Uh, this is not the first time we've had a story like this in the past few months, uh,

01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:59.440
when it comes to blizzard. However, uh, Jeff Kaplan, who is a very well known, if you,

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:02.880
if you've seen his face, you probably go, Oh, that's the guy that is always talking about

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:07.440
overwatch. Well, yes, it's because he is the director of overwatch. He's been with blizzard

01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:12.400
for almost two decades. That's 19 years. Uh, and he announced this week he is leaving blizzard

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:16.480
saying, quote, it was truly the honor of a lifetime to have the opportunity to create

01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:20.960
worlds and heroes for such a passionate audience. Uh, if you want to read his full goodbye note,

01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:27.120
it is available at play over watch.com. Uh, Aaron Keller will be taking over for Jeff Kaplan.

01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:31.440
He is also been with blizzard for quite a long time. Uh, they both worked on world of

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:36.000
warcraft prior. Uh, and in a statement, Aaron Keller said, Jeff's been a great leader, mentor,

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.920
and friend, and he knows how much we're going to miss him. I've been lucky to work alongside him

01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:43.920
and the rest of the overwatch team for many years in building something that continues to inspire

01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:49.040
people all around the world. And I'm honored to carry the torch for forward. Um, of course,

01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:54.400
some folks in the overwatch community expressing some concern because you know, overwatch to

01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:59.440
overwatch itself, hasn't had a lot of updates recently, um, because you know,

01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:03.680
they're prepping for number two and they've already done a lot of, uh, uh, updates to the

01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:09.600
base game. Uh, but overwatch two, we know is not coming out in 2021. And so obviously this timing

01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:14.640
is a little bit, um, concerning to some people. I don't know so much about that because Diablo

01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:17.760
three went through so many, I think they went through like three different directors and that

01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:22.320
game still clunking along and doing fine. And Diablo four is, you know, in a good place too.

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:27.920
Um, I think the perception of what's happening with this news is just up there goes another

01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:32.880
Blizzard exec abandoning ship. You know, what the fuck's going on? Activision Blizzard,

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:39.040
Activision's ruined the company. There's another one. And the reality is this could be a lot of

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:43.200
things. And Bobby went into some good detail on his show tonight. So I'll give him a shout out

01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:48.000
and a plug, uh, for Bobby Black Wolf, our pal over there in his show. And he went into depth

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.160
kind of talking about, you know what, this whole COVID thing that a lot of us have been going

01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:57.840
through have made us reevaluate a lot of things. And one of those big things is where I'm working

01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:04.240
maybe I want to change that up a little bit. Maybe I'm taking up a new skill while I'm on furlough or

01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:08.560
layoff from my job. And now I want to use that skill to get a better job. And, you know,

01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:12.160
different types of companies are hiring and so on and so on. I'm not going to repeat what he said

01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:17.360
too much, but the more the, the point of that is we don't know what this guy's plans are

01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:23.600
professionally. And you know what, after you've been at a company for 19 years to want to change

01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:32.640
it up a little bit is not that unusual, but again, that perception is there. All of these

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:37.840
people that have been leaving Blizzard recently were there a very long time. And you would imagine

01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:44.000
we're very happy, but now here's another one that's gone. So I think a lot of the tea leaves

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:52.720
on that will come out in what does he do next? If he goes to another company and starts working on

01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:58.400
an Overwatch-like game, that's probably a pretty telltale sign something was wrong at Blizzard.

01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:04.880
But if the dude decides to take a year off to be with his family and go on a nice big vacation,

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:10.080
which he is absolutely fucking earned, I'm sure, and I don't even follow Overwatch that closely,

01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:15.280
as much as many other people do, then I think that will maybe read a different way. Or if he's

01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:21.280
decided, you know what, after 20 years in the video game industry, I want to paint. Go off,

01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:28.880
do it, paint. Great. I want to make children's playgrounds. Actually, we say that tongue in

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:36.480
cheek, but brilliant example. Why not? Exactly. Yeah. Anyhow, let's see. ActDeft is saying,

01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:41.120
many people are speculating he's going to Riot to work on one of their projects. Well,

01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:47.200
that's a little bit fan wanky, but we have seen Blizzard people go to Riot. I remember

01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:52.160
GhostCrawler, the big community person, had gone to Riot, and there's been others too. So

01:39:52.960 --> 01:40:02.000
anything's possible, but I wouldn't put too much stock in those sorts of reports yet. Let's see,

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:08.320
VGRealness saying, probably gone to Dreamhaven, like the rest who left. Or was that the same

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:14.000
studio that Chris Metzen is doing his D&D thing with? Because that one is interesting,

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:18.400
because it's not a video game. It's a very, you know, a D&D campaign type thing is a very story

01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:22.720
heavy type of thing. But that's kind of like what Chris Metzen kind of did at Blizzard. He was very

01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:32.080
involved in the story of World of Warcraft. So it's interesting, I think. Anyway. Questbuster

01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:37.120
in chat says, 20 years is a lot of life investment in a company and perhaps he's simply looking to do

01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:41.760
something new on his own. Take a break, bake a cake, whatever else it might be. A lot of

01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:46.560
veteran devs in the past few years have left AAA studios to either take sabbaticals or even found

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:51.520
smaller teams to find the spark they missed in working with large ones. I think a really good

01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:58.000
parallel in that regard is Reggie Fils-Aime. He probably didn't need to leave Nintendo. Like,

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.840
you know what I mean? Like, like he probably, he was doing a great job there. People love him,

01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:09.680
but he just decided, this is my time. And I want to go be with the family and stuff. And maybe I'll

01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:14.640
take on a little advisory role that lasts for nine months over a year, or I'll do another little

01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:20.080
thing over a year, you know, and that's, that's what he wants to do. And he's earned it. I think

01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:23.760
it's, you know, it's, it's, it's a little tough for the Overwatch community because Jeff Kaplan

01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:30.240
is such the face for Overwatch and so much so that he's participated in gags, you know, like the,

01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:35.040
the Yule Log Christmas, whatever that old joke was. I think he sat in front of a fireplace for

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:39.600
like six hours on a Twitch stream or whatever the hell he was doing. We don't know this new

01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:44.480
guy as much, you know, and there's always, there's always that, you know, what's the new,

01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:50.400
is this new? What's, I don't like new. I liked old. I already dislike new. We don't know what

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:54.240
this new person's going to bring to the table. I'm sure we've seen him before at panels and,

01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:58.400
you know, other things, but he's just not so much the face. So it'll be interesting to see,

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:03.040
you know, how, how that all works out, but I'm sure the guy will do fine. He's been with Blizzard

01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:12.320
a very long time as well. So let's see. Amethyst Rose Witch says, hell, 10 years is a lot. I know

01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:17.920
I'm reevaluating. I think they say something like it's, it's kind of average to want to change that

01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:21.680
up every 10 years or so. I don't remember the exact number. Don't quote me on that.

01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:26.560
But yeah, I know people that change. It seems, I know this one person I used to work with. I feel

01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:32.160
like she changes every year, but you know what, if, if you could do it and you're successful at it,

01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:38.320
one, and you're happy, it ain't my place to tell you what to do. Okay. VG realness says every seven

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:42.720
years is the average. Okay. I, I, and I thought I remember reading something like that somewhere.

01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:47.040
And I think, don't they also say like in your life, you kind of go through big changes every

01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:55.040
seven years. Yeah. And here I am by the way, sitting at 42, which is, which is seven times

01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:59.760
six, by the way. And we're looking at finally buying a house after all these years, which is

01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:03.840
a pretty big change of sorts. And I'm sure there'll be other stuff as well. So anyway,

01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:11.680
maybe there's something to that. I don't know. All right. But the more things change, the more we

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:16.720
appreciate the classics. And that's why we have this segment called the classic game of the week,

01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:22.000
where every week dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:28.320
Hey, you guys should be checking out this classic or actually what really happens in this segment

01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:32.160
sometimes. Cause I think that's, what's going to happen to us tonight is that sometimes it's like

01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:37.520
that meme that you've seen online, what you thought final fantasy was 20 years ago, where

01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:43.360
it shows the retro final fantasy. And then what final fantasy really was 20 years ago. And then

01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:48.960
you see the picture of final fantasy 10 on the PlayStation two with, you know, all it's a great

01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:54.720
graphics and everything. Um, because the criteria that dark soccer created, cause you know, she

01:43:54.720 --> 01:44:00.320
writes the rules is that a game has to be 10 years old or more to be a classic game of the week.

01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:05.120
And this is definitely one of those games when, when I was, you know, cause you know, I I'm,

01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:08.960
I'm special. I get to see what she picked in advance. And when I saw it, I was like,

01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:13.200
Oh my God, this is 10 years old. Really? And I had a final fantasy just for that reason.

01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:19.120
I had a final fantasy meme moment. It's a good one, but y'all get ready to feel old.

01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:25.600
I'm going to warn you. All right. Dark soccer. No, my pain. What are you going to, uh, what are

01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:34.480
you going to make the audience cry with tonight? The classic game of the week came out in 2011

01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:45.040
and it's called limbo. Yes. Limbo. Um, it is a very beautiful stylized puzzle platform

01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:50.640
game that was developed by an independent studio called play dead. It was released actually in July

01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:57.520
2010 on Xbox live arcade and has been ported around to other systems, including PS3, Linux

01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:03.040
and windows. It is a 2d site, huh? I'm sorry. I hate to interrupt, but you need to, I felt you

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:08.240
could celebrate in some of the tears that you're causing in chat. You ready? We have, wow. I feel

01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:15.760
old. Wow. I'm so old. When we was a weave log show. Good Lord. This is that old limbo is eligible.

01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:22.960
Fuck. So there you go. There you go. Dark soccer. Enjoy your cup of chat room tears.

01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:34.080
Ah, refreshing here. Mm. Delightful. And podcasts, uh, podcast listeners,

01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:39.440
we don't want you to be left out. Please send those tears to our Twitter account at OLR,

01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:42.880
uh, send them directly to dark soccer, water, my green onions.

01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:54.160
All right. And anyhow, so yes, the game is, uh, limbo. And as I was saying, it's presented in

01:45:54.160 --> 01:46:01.120
black and white tones, uh, kind of gray scale. And it uses, uh, lighting and film grain effects

01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:09.760
and very minimal ambient sounds to create this atmosphere of, of almost hopelessness kind of,

01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:17.600
kind of scary. Um, it's very dark. It's even been, uh, compared to old film noir in German

01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:27.200
expressionism, which I totally get that vibe out of it. Um, it is, it's also been toted as one of,

01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:33.840
as an example of video games as an art form, very positive reviews, um, minimalized story

01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:40.160
that kind of split people, but otherwise it's been just considered one of the greatest games

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:49.360
of all time. Um, it was also the third highest selling game on Xbox live arcade in 2010. Um,

01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:56.160
and as one, uh, several industry awards. So, um, to go forward into this. So basically you play

01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:04.080
a little boy and you have to navigate him through his dark, eerie world. Um, sorry,

01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:12.400
the cat was chatting about this in the background. Um, so you have to solve these puzzles

01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:18.560
to kind of get through. So you have hazards like glowing worms that will attach themselves to your

01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:23.360
head and force you to travel in one direction until they're killed. You also have the mechanical

01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:29.200
puzzles where you deal with machinery, electromagnets and gravity. Um, you don't

01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:35.760
notice the traps though until they kill you. And so you restart from your last checkpoint. Um,

01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:40.400
and you just can keep starting over as far as you go. It's basically a trial and death game

01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:47.680
and you can die with dismemberment or beheading or some gore. Um, you know, there are some,

01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:54.800
there's an optional gore filter if you don't want to see it. Um, but yeah, there's carcasses

01:47:54.800 --> 01:48:01.440
and bear traps and all kinds of stuff. Um, so basically the story of this is that you're this

01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:10.400
boy who wakes up in a forest on the edge of hell. Um, and you encounter a giant spider who tries to

01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:17.120
kill you. And then after you cut off the sharp points of, of his legs, then you continue through

01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:26.720
the story. Um, and then, uh, I'm not going to spoil the ending. Get off of there.

01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:34.240
You all right over there? My cat was on my art table.

01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:38.880
Well, your cat was also feeling old. Thanks to this selection. Just letting you know.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.040
And it's my fault for leaving the door open. You are a bad girl out.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:54.080
Out. She's going to the closed door to leave like great cat. Anyway. Um, it was, uh, conceived as

01:48:54.080 --> 01:49:02.400
a game around 2004 with some concept art, um, from, uh, the designer is at IO interactive.

01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:11.040
Um, he had, as he said, a mood image of a secret place to get ideas. Um, and he expanded upon it.

01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:17.280
He tried to make his own game and visual basic, but he needed a lot more, uh, assistance with it.

01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:24.080
So he made an art style trailer in 2006 and tried to recruit people. Um, but he had just two people

01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:31.360
to start with. So that led to the creation of play dead and they attracted more people and the game

01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:41.760
has gone on to be beautiful. Um, the ESRB listed entries for, for PS3 and windows, but it was a

01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:48.000
mistake on their part first. They didn't have any intention of bringing it out. Um, but then, uh,

01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:56.400
eventually, you know, things happened. Um, they did, they actually didn't want to release on

01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:00.640
windows because of software piracy. Something they were very worried about.

01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:05.440
But then again, I guess once they've made their money, you know, limbo.

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:11.920
It also out on steam also something, one thing we have to remember about PC games. Um, and by the

01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:16.560
way, if you don't like spiders, avert your eyes for a little bit because, um, the next part of

01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:21.520
this game for people who don't like spiders is very, um, rough visually. So I'm going to let it

01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:26.000
keep playing, but I'm going to warn you if you don't like spiders, don't watch just avert your

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:32.080
eyes for a little bit. I'll tell you when it's safe again. Um, and, uh, um, I, I got sidetracked.

01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:42.560
I'm sorry. I was going to say, um, uh, spiders now before that PC. Oh yes. PC. Thank you.

01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:48.640
It opens things up to a much larger audience because the PS3 is only officially available

01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:52.480
in so many places in the world. And I think that's one thing we often forget with PC gaming

01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:58.000
is that by putting out a game in P on PC, you can get to a lot of countries where console gaming is

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:04.640
not readily accessible. That makes sense. Yeah. So, but there are different versions of the game.

01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:15.600
Of course, there is a Mac OS version, um, through the Mac app store. Um, there, uh, sorry. Um,

01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:23.600
uh, as I said, there's a Mac OS version. There is a Linux version that plays in a wine, uh,

01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:32.080
environment, which is a, uh, sort of a windows virtualization. Um, there was a Vita version,

01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:38.880
um, but it doesn't use the touch pad. Um, there's an iOS version. Um, there's all kinds of versions

01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:52.480
out there. Um, and it's just really, really just a, a good game. Um, I, I really,

01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:58.560
really cannot stress, uh, enough about how beautiful the music, the minimalized music,

01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:05.360
uh, audio and the visuals are in this one. I mean, as you can see, um, but the audio was created by,

01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:13.520
Martin Stig Anderson, who was a graduate in Royal Academy of Music. Um, and so his specialty being,

01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:23.280
um, uh, cosmetic music, which is sort of non traditional from created from generated sounds.

01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:28.640
They don't seem to have any particular source, um, is it came in and it blends in quite beautifully

01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:36.160
with this, uh, background. Um, but yeah, uh, it got great receptions, very, very highly rated

01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:44.400
across the board. And, you know, it's just, it's really, I can't really say too much more good

01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:49.440
about it. It really is excellent. And it's, it's really that, that artistic style and the look of

01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:55.200
this game. Um, and she whole can chat says it's a great game and sound. Yeah. And I think that that

01:52:55.200 --> 01:53:01.520
unique style, when this came out, we weren't seeing a lot of games that really looked like,

01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:05.680
like such a unique style like this, you know what I mean? And I think that's what makes this game

01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:09.840
very special, even though, like I just said, and I warned y'all that scene that just played out

01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:14.400
with the spider. Um, that's literally my worst nightmare coming to life. Um, so anyway, I'm

01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:19.760
going to turn the game footage. The spider is very scary. I did you see, he picked the guy up and

01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:24.000
wrapped it. I think it's super, I mean, it's not, it's not violent or gory at least, but that, no,

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:29.440
I'm, I'm, that is like literally one of my worst nightmares playing out. Yeah, but, but he's free

01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:33.600
of, of the stuff. He is now happy ending, I suppose. All right. Except for that little piece.

01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:37.040
I just love that scene though, where like you see his eyes and he's lying on the ground,

01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:42.240
staring at the camera, like what even is my life? Yeah. All right. I'm going to go back. That's,

01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:47.600
that's me. I am that little boy right now. All right. There is your classic game of the week.

01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:53.600
Limbo. Yes. It's 10 years old and you are 10 years older as a result. Congratulations.

01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:59.840
All right. Great pick. Jamie really is. All right. Thank you. I mean, I'm if when you do a bad pick,

01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:05.600
I'm just not going to tell you, no, I'm kidding. There's no such thing. No, you have done bad

01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:12.000
picks, but you've said, I don't always pick a good one. I do it on purpose. Yeah. So they're

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:17.440
not always good, but even the bad ones are still classics and you should know about them so that

01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:22.400
you avoid them. Like they're classic in their own way. You know, show are just classically bad.

01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:29.520
Showgirls is classic cinema. Pink flamingos is classic cinema, but there, there are reasons for

01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:35.360
the hell Rocky horror picture show, honestly is not that great of a movie, but the experience,

01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:40.960
the music, the, the Tim Curry, the, and all of this stuff adds up to like this, you got to see

01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:46.720
it type of thing, right? Honestly, it is a better stage play than it is a movie. Yes. But, Oh, by the

01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:53.120
way, I have seen the stage play several times now. Was it rest in peace, um, just passed away this

01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:57.760
week that was involved with all the meatloaf songs. And I believe played the character and

01:54:57.760 --> 01:55:05.680
fan of the paradise, which is another huge, uh, is it Jim Steinman? Please don't. I know his face

01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:11.840
is a very distinctive look, but I don't remember the name. Somebody I'm waiting for chat to shout

01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:16.400
it out. Okay. See it to very things. I'm Jim Steinman. Was it? No, but no,

01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:21.360
William Finley was 2012. It was, uh, it was Jim Steinman. Okay. That's what I thought. Okay.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:27.120
Whew. I got that. Right. All right. Anyway. Um, so yeah, rest in peace because the paradise is

01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:32.320
fucking weird. Oh, that movie just Jessica Harper is such, it's like one of those actresses where

01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:38.960
if it's like, if you know her, it's like, you're in this secret society of people who know who she

01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:44.080
is and why she's awesome. Like that whole thing. So anyway, I still need to, to this day, I still

01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:51.920
need to see Suspiria, which is like one of her all time, like biggest roles. I actually have seen

01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:57.280
the remake of Suspiria. Oh, okay. And I have the original of Suspiria. If you want to come

01:55:57.280 --> 01:56:03.280
over and watch it with me, I really enjoyed the remake. Oh my God. That'll be a fun VAX thing.

01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:06.400
Like now that we're both VAX, we're going to watch movies together. That'll be fun.

01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:11.600
Yeah. I have to, I have to say though, I need, I want someone to watch Suspiria with me because the,

01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:18.240
the remake of it was really good. It had Tilda Swanson in it too. Um, but I really,

01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:23.840
yeah. And I know that Jessica Harper was in the remake very briefly, but, um, but I need,

01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:28.240
She writes children's books now. And so she's been kind of like, she even has her own podcast.

01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:32.880
Uh, I may be a limited edition or whatever, but she wrote a book recently and she was doing like

01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:37.040
tours and she's, she didn't do conventions for a long time, but she's one of those people who's

01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:40.720
really opened up over the years and does convention, or at least, you know, pre COVID

01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:44.480
was starting to do more conventions and kind of open up about her past and all that stuff.

01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:49.040
Pretty approachable. Yeah. I kept trying to get them like little, little inside baseball,

01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:53.360
but you know, they do that convention here in Sacramento and I'm, I'm in the ear of the person

01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:57.840
who runs it. And I've been, I've been saying for years, get Jessica Harper, get Jessica Harper,

01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:04.720
get Jessica Harper. One of the, one of these years it'll work. So, all right. I mean, why not?

01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:08.000
They got, they got Barry Boswith. They got Patricia Quinn. They got, they've gotten a

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:11.600
lot of good people and I'm like, please get Jessica Harper. That's like, who's on your

01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:18.160
wishlist? Rob Jessica Harper. All right. Anyhow, uh, this is not the Jessica Harper podcast,

01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:22.160
unfortunately, but, uh, and if you have no idea who we're talking about, you really should educate

01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:26.560
yourself. Like honestly, like you get joint, join the secret society of fans. Uh, we're,

01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:31.440
we're small and loyal. All right. Uh, let's move on to some rapid fire news where we talk about

01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:36.560
the video game industry, not the movie industry really quick. Uh, let's do it. Uh, Loki, why don't

01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:44.960
you start us off? All right. So, um, this is pretty cool. So on the 10th birthday of Portal 2,

01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:51.520
yes, now it's eligible for classic game of the week. Um, there's been a fan release,

01:57:51.520 --> 01:57:58.320
a mod called portal reloaded, which adds a third color portal to the gun. Uh, it's a green one.

01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:04.160
It actually allows time travel. So that's even more of a mind bender now. So you can go check

01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:11.360
that out. Um, looks pretty cool. I always like these portal fan games. Uh, speaking of fan

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:17.680
additions for games, um, mother three has had a brand new English translation by the fans as well

01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:24.240
on its 15th anniversary. So that's also available if you're a fan of mother three.

01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:29.760
Which, um, is a game I really still need to play. Start to finish. I've played a little

01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:33.680
bit of that translation patch, but I can't believe that game is 15 years old and still nothing.

01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:41.120
And even Reggie fees and may is joking about it now. Like how dare you? Although obviously

01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:45.600
this was a decision above his head, I'm sure, you know, even though he's the face of Nintendo,

01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:49.760
you know, in America to many of us, even still with Doug Bowser there, I mean, even still,

01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:54.080
um, obviously we know that Japan calls a lot of the shots with that stuff. So, um,

01:58:54.080 --> 01:58:58.960
one of these days, one of these days, all right. Uh, dark soccer, what do you have for us?

01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:05.680
A couple of things. Um, there are, uh, there's rumors that, uh,

01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:11.920
Sony and Konami are in discussions to do a new Castlevania game on the PlayStation five.

01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:19.760
Um, it came from a leaker called catharsis T. Just saying that they've been talking about it

01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:25.360
and that they also were having new projects related to metal gear, solid and silent Hill

01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:32.080
in the works. Um, but of course, rumor speculation, we don't know. Um, but, uh,

01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:37.040
apparently this person has been correct before. So yeah. And, and we're getting a new silent Hill

01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:41.520
too. Remember those rumors? So I don't know. It's like, I want to see the receipts,

01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:46.960
but I understand this is it's what gaming culture is talking about. So we, we do indulge the rumors

01:59:46.960 --> 01:59:53.040
sometimes. And I think we'd all love to see it. I think we'd all be loved to play a new Castlevania

01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:58.480
game, but in the meantime, we have bloodstain. It's not bad at all. Yeah. Well, for those of us

01:59:58.480 --> 02:00:04.800
though, who have already been enjoying Capcom arcade stadium on our switches. Well, the rest

02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:14.240
of you guys get it too. So, um, it will be available on PS4, Xbox one and PC on, on May 25th.

02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:22.320
Um, and you can, uh, you get 1943, the battle of Midway for free. Um, you will also get some

02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:29.520
add on packs. Um, there is Dawn of the arcade pack, um, which is 1984 to 1988 arcade revolution,

02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:38.880
which is 1989 to 1982, and then arcade evolution, 1992 to 2001. So, uh, in that last pack,

02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:44.480
that's where we have 1944, the loop master, uh, street fighter, two hyper fighting edition,

02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:49.040
street fighter, two turbo. That second pack is where we get, um, street fighter to the world

02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:54.880
warriors, captain commando, Strider and final fight, which is honestly, that's the best pack

02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:59.200
to get in my opinion. Yeah. I bought them all on. So I'm actually kind of irritated too, cause I

02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:02.480
would have probably bought it on a different system if I knew, but it's all right. Switch

02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:11.920
of these games though on like the Sega Saturn Capcom packs. Yeah. So, but I don't know. It's

02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:17.840
kind of, kind of fun to have them again. Giga wing is certainly, uh, a good one. Cause unless

02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:21.600
you have a dream cast, I don't think Giga wing didn't really come out on anything else. I don't

02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:26.240
think it did. They, they, they, the, the stadium is good because it does have deep cuts. I'd call

02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:30.320
that like a deep cut and they do have some really good deep cuts in there. Um, and they do, you

02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:33.600
know, they do stuff that the technology wasn't there for with those earlier packs. Like, you

02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:38.400
know, a little bit of the online competition achievements, weekly things, you know, that you

02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:43.840
get more skins and cosmetics for doing. I think, I think it's a well done pack and I hope they expand

02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:48.400
on it with more games. Actually. I would love to see that if possible. Uh, I'd love to see things

02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:51.680
like puzzle fighter in there, but I don't know if they'd actually do it when they could probably

02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:55.600
release that as a standalone game, but you could say the same thing about street fighter. And

02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:59.520
that's still in there. So, or street fighter two, excuse me, but you know what I meant.

02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:04.560
So it'd be very interesting to see. All right. Uh, let's travel around the world and check out

02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:09.120
some release dates, things that we'll be playing a little sooner than Capcom arcade on our PlayStation

02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:13.280
four. Although I guess not too much of a wait. Uh, it's only about a month, but what do we get

02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:21.040
to play next week? Loki? Uh, we've got death and requests on Nintendo switch, uh, Genshin impact on

02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:30.800
PlayStation five to hell with it on PC, uh, final two, uh, that's on Nintendo switch,

02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:37.200
PlayStation four X-Box one X-Box series X, uh, total war Rome remastered on PC, Mac, and Linux.

02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:44.800
Um, this is exciting new Pokemon snap on Nintendo switch. Oh, that's right. That's the sweet,

02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:52.720
yeah. Uh, returnal on PlayStation five. Oh, I wanted to see that. I hope my friends stream that

02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:59.600
also apparently our type final two is coming out again on, um, PlayStation four X-Box one

02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:04.720
X-Box series X and PC. I don't know why it's coming out twice in the week, but whatever,

02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:11.520
uh, maybe, I don't know. Um, there's a footnote and I don't want to read it.

02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:17.920
Uh, let's see. Oh, nobody does. I got it. So, so it's coming out slightly earlier in the week

02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:23.680
for Japan, North America is getting it later in the week, whatever, uh, terminate resistance

02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:32.400
enhanced on PlayStation five. And that's it. I need to, I need to recruit Shane for a Pokemon

02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:36.800
snap stream of sort. Cause I believe I think, didn't he say he's never played the original?

02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:40.960
Like I thought that was a thing that came up. I did not have played the original. I don't

02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:46.720
remember if you're listening, Shane, will you correct me or whatever, but I'm almost positive.

02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:50.160
That was the thing. Like he still hasn't played those games. And so we really need a reaction

02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:54.560
stream from him. All right. Anyway, moving on, uh, let's go to Japan and check out the

02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:59.360
releases over there. Uh, we also, we have some similar stuff. We had like the R-type final two

02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:04.320
is out there as well. Uh, let's see, uh, that is on the switch. Uh, there's also some themed

02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:08.880
controllers and some peripherals and things like that coming out this week as well. And of course,

02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:13.040
new Pokemon snap is also getting its release in Japan. I mean, that would be pretty rude if they

02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:18.080
didn't put that out in Japan at the same time. Uh, there's lots of Sanrio, uh, related, um,

02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:21.920
like Nintendo switch peripherals and things of that sort as well. So it's pretty big week for

02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:27.520
that type of stuff. Um, I think that's about it for the switch. Let me look at PlayStation

02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:31.360
five and PlayStation four. Oh, Returnal has a Japanese release this week on PlayStation

02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:35.840
five as well. So they're getting it about the same time. That's cool. Um, cause I think that

02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:40.400
was developed over here. And so Japan sometimes has to wait for those that are developed over

02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:45.200
here, but not that one. Uh, and then looking at PlayStation four, you have the star renegades and

02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:49.600
R-type final two also getting their releases in Japan this week. So there you go. How about the

02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:59.600
UK dark Sakura? A few things on the 29th, we have, uh, world war one, Verdun, um, and Tannenberg,

02:04:59.600 --> 02:05:02.960
uh, but that's the Western front and Eastern front, both coming out on PS five.

02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:10.880
Um, also taxi chaos for PS five and switch on the 30th, we have Terminator resistance enhanced

02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:18.640
on PS five, um, Pokemon snap on a switch battle acts on PlayStation and switch

02:05:18.640 --> 02:05:26.720
and Returnal on PlayStation. All right. Uh, let us get to some more news stories. And then of

02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:31.840
course, we'll take your questions, uh, and comments in our chat room over twitch.tv slash

02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:36.640
VOG network. As we get a little closer to the end of the show. Okay. Shane is saying I'm correct.

02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:40.960
He has never played Pokemon snap. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna work on this and see what I can do

02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:44.160
in the meantime. Loki, why don't you get to our next story?

02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:49.360
Yeah. So we had a rumor a few weeks ago talking about Microsoft possibly,

02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:54.720
uh, looking to buy discord. Well, that's not going to happen. So apparently all the talks

02:05:54.720 --> 02:06:00.320
are now off the table and it's that, you know, possible that it could be rekindled in the future,

02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:08.640
but not yet. So we can all take a nice, uh, relaxing side that, that, that nightmare isn't

02:06:08.640 --> 02:06:15.040
going to happen. All right. Uh, yeah, that's good. That's good. I don't think a lot of us

02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:18.240
really wanted to see that happen. I mean, some of us are probably reading into like,

02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:21.600
Oh, there are some good things that could come out of that, but I think most of us

02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:25.200
wanted discord to stay independent and it looks like that is, so it looks like all,

02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:29.440
it's not just Microsoft, but like all the suitors are off the table. Right. If I read that right.

02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:32.800
And it's just discord is going to go the independent right route. And I think that's

02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:38.480
the direction most of us wanted to see them take. Yeah. Yeah. So I think that's, uh, that's good

02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:48.160
news. Yay. All right. Uh, let's move on. Um, okay. This, this story is interesting. Um, and, uh,

02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:52.000
this is, again, it's one of those things where it's like, it's, it's not the same as it was

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:58.560
10 years ago. And I'm talking about the humble bundle, uh, humble bundle, the company, which,

02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:04.560
uh, is now an IGN company and has been for several years, by the way, um, humble bundle announced,

02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:09.440
uh, that in may, uh, there are no more, there are no longer going to be sliders, uh, when you buy

02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:14.000
a bundle. I think most of you have probably bought a humble bundle at some point, but let me remind

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:18.880
you. Um, in the early days of humble bundle, they used to do these big indie bundles, right? Where

02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:22.240
it would be like, I don't know what seven, eight, nine games that they would give away for like a

02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:27.600
pay what you want. And then they'd throw in an extra game or three, if you'd paid like a minimum,

02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:31.040
or if you paid like above the average, you know, the little benchmarks would get you a

02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:35.760
couple more games. And these were widely popular because you'd have a slider at the bottom where

02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:39.680
you could give all this money to the charity that they were supporting at the time. If it's like

02:07:39.680 --> 02:07:43.440
doctors that borders or whoever it is they're supporting at the moment, or you could give like

02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:49.360
maybe 50% to the developers of the games and 50% to charity. And then there was a place where you

02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:54.000
could leave a humble tip as well. Cause you know, um, bandwidth isn't free, um, and, and putting the

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.880
site together and all that. So you could leave them a little bit of a tip, but there were a lot

02:07:56.880 --> 02:08:00.080
of people that would do those bundles and just give a hundred percent of the money to charity.

02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:03.920
Um, you know, and that's, that's kind of what it was for, you know, you didn't really get a lot of

02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:08.960
new games in there. You got a lot of indie stuff, but I would say humble bundle was really where

02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:15.600
this started this whole concept of pay five bucks and get 10 awesome games. Right. And, and was,

02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:20.080
was really probably one of the biggest things we can blame for our fucking backlogs. Right.

02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:25.840
It's humble bundle. Am I right? Loki is humble bundle the source of a lot of your backlog?

02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:33.600
Yeah. I already increased my backlog just today. Oh boy. Um, the VR one.

02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:40.480
Okay. Um, so, uh, yeah, so, um, things are going to be changing now because, uh, they're no longer

02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:45.840
going to have those sliders. Um, and, uh, what's going to happen is that you're going to be able

02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:52.960
to choose preset options that decide how the money is divvied up, but the charity portion

02:08:52.960 --> 02:09:03.120
is capped at 15%. Meaning the best options for charity donations is 15%. Whereas in the past,

02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:06.240
most of, a lot of us were giving a hundred percent to charity. And I don't think there's

02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:10.960
anything wrong with that. Cause that was the whole point of humble bundle. But unfortunately,

02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:16.240
when we had that news, what four or five years ago at this point that IGN bought them.

02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:20.960
Well, we all know humble bundles kind of been, they've been a little bit different ever since,

02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:25.360
right? They're, they're more of a storefront. They, you know, they do these different,

02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:29.360
they try to sell their humble subscription and all of this, you know, when was the last time

02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:33.760
that they did an indie bundle that really caught fire the way the old ones did? Well,

02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:38.560
that's been a while with the subscription though. Like it's not even really subscription per se,

02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:42.400
cause you don't get automatically charged each month. And it's basically just,

02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:48.640
it's basically a bundle cause you buy you, you pay the amount and you get like 12 games.

02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:53.600
So it's, it's, it's kind of weird. You know what they are ahead of time. It's not like,

02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:58.160
Oh, I'm going to repay this and have it recur every month. And then we'll be surprised with

02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:01.520
what we get. It's like, cause there's been months I was like, yeah, I'm going to skip it,

02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:06.720
but I do it and it's a pretty good deal, but okay. It's not, it's hardly a subscription anymore.

02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:11.520
Now humble bundles said in their post announcing what's happening here,

02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:16.400
why they're removing the sliders. They want to unify their various services saying since we

02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:21.280
launched bundles a decade ago, sliders have not changed. Even as humble evolved by building

02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:25.760
products like humble choice and the humble store that all support charity without sliders.

02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:33.520
That's a, that's a weird flex to me. Like it's more that they need to keep the company running.

02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:37.920
They need to keep the lights on. It's, it's, it's what it boils down to. But of course,

02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:41.920
a lot of people are making jokes about how, well, they're not so humble anymore. Are they,

02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:46.240
or what was the great one liner that I just saw in chat? Ice P in chat says,

02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:52.640
might be taken a bit of a humble tumble. That's funny. I like the humble tumbles funny.

02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:57.600
Blah, blah, blah, blah. So I think there's a lot of us that are taking issue with the fact that

02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:01.600
they're calling themselves the humble bundle when the charity now seems to be taking a back seat to

02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:05.840
the other stuff. And like, on one hand, I get it. Like maybe this is how they're going to be able

02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:10.560
to attract more developers is by basically guaranteeing the developers are going to get

02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:15.920
a certain minimum and all this, but it, it certainly does feel like, okay, then isn't

02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:21.360
the humble bundle now just a steam key reseller at this point? Isn't that just what they do?

02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:27.200
And not just steam key because they do Nintendo stuff too. They have like 3DS that was on there

02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:30.480
for a little bit as well. And they still do. I still see ads for it where they're,

02:11:30.480 --> 02:11:34.560
they're using like Mario brothers three in the ad, but that is something that you can,

02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:38.800
you can buy on the store and redeem on like the 3DS shop and stuff. But essentially they're just

02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:45.920
a key seller front where a small part goes to charity. Do we care that, I mean, would,

02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:51.760
would a 15% charity donation change your mind and make you want to shop at humble bundle still?

02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:57.120
Loki, it sounds like with you. Well, but you said you, well, you said you are on their subscription

02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:02.880
thing. Yeah, right. I do that. And, um, I don't really change the sliders at all. I don't like

02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:09.440
give more to the charity. I just, whatever the default is. Um, SSG100Matt says, I believe humble

02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:13.520
was given the edict from Ziff Davis, the parent company to change the business model or they'll

02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:18.240
close it down. I'm sure Ziff is suffering from the pandemic and looking at their fiscal stuff.

02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:23.040
I'm sure humble is not really profitable and they push them to change this. Either they cap it or

02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:28.400
humble goes away. Sad truth. And Tiger Claw follows that up with it's more like a humble

02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:38.240
stumble. Stop. Oh, you, uh, Jamie, uh, what are your thoughts with the whole, like, you know,

02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:43.120
is it, is, is a 15% charity donation enough to get you to pay attention still to the store or

02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:49.200
is it, it's just kind of whatever at this point. I'm kind of whatever. You're all in on Stadia now

02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:55.360
anyway, so it doesn't matter. Yeah, it's pretty much as like, uh, I, my, my heart has been taken

02:12:55.360 --> 02:13:00.400
by the Stadia. All right. Well, at least my gaming experience has been taken by the Stadia.

02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:07.920
All right. All right. Let's move on and, uh, talk about our next story, which is, um, something I

02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:13.120
was not aware of, even though I've been interested in this game because everybody tells me I need to

02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:20.240
play the other game. Anyway, Jamie, please take it away. So, um, there is definitely some trauma

02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:27.200
going on with Nier Replicant, um, which is the newest game in the Nier series. And this is going

02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:30.560
to be a little bit spoilery. So I'm going to go ahead and give the warning out there. And it's,

02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:34.160
it's a reimagining of the first game is important to put out the Japanese version of first game.

02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:37.840
It's not like a new thing in the story. It's a reimagining. I never played any of them. So,

02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:44.240
um, anyways, so, um, with this game, uh, then since it's not a spoiler,

02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:53.280
they have put in two achievements that could definitely be seen as sexist, but absolutely

02:13:53.280 --> 02:14:00.400
as transphobic as well. Um, one of the characters in the game and I'm going to mispronounce, I think

02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:10.880
it's a kinase is intersex. Um, meaning has both general sets of, uh, genitalia. Um, so there is

02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:17.280
an achievement called daredevil. You risk life and limb 10 times to discover someone secret,

02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:28.160
which is basically an upskirt cam. You look up kinase skirt 10 times. Um,

02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:33.520
there was, uh, and it was the same thing as a near automata called, what are you doing?

02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:41.360
Where you look up to be skirt. It's the upskirt thing. It's just encouraging bad behavior,

02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:47.120
but in this case, since it's dealing with an intersex character, it really is just

02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:55.040
disgusting. Very bad taste at the bare minimum. It comes off like, I don't know if the intent

02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:58.800
was there to be transphobic, although that doesn't certainly matter at the end of the day,

02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:02.000
this whole thing just comes out. Like it just comes off as immature. Like it's just,

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:07.360
it's just immature. Like, and I thought as gamers and wanting to be accepted as an art form,

02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:11.600
which those near games are very artistic. And that's, that's the reason why I think this is

02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:15.680
so frustrating is that you don't want to see the game get canceled all over all this or whatever,

02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:20.880
because especially with your automata, there's a lot of beauty and brilliance in the story

02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:25.680
to just see something so immature, be a big blemish on it is just fresh.

02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:31.200
This isn't immaturity specifically, this is sexist immaturity.

02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:32.560
I'll give you that. Absolutely.

02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:37.920
The sexism is definitely there. And so there's already some major complaints about it,

02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:43.600
but we cannot overlook the general sexism of everything. Yeah. You know,

02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:48.400
by putting a blanket immaturity statement on it, it removes what this really is.

02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:52.720
Yeah. And you got some folks in chat that are echoing this a little bit saying,

02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:58.480
as Joe and Hunter Matt says, poor taste. Act Dev says, yeah, immature. It's bad nonetheless.

02:15:58.480 --> 02:16:02.720
Bob Coffee says, even if the intent is to reference automata's achievement,

02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:06.160
it's pretty tasteless. It shouldn't have been an automata in the first place.

02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:11.280
I would also agree with that. Amethyst Rose Witch says immature is an understatement. And I will,

02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:15.520
I will, I will grant, even though that's the first word that comes to my mind, I think

02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:19.920
dark soccer makes a very clear statement. And I agree with her that, you know, there's,

02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:26.320
it's, it's immaturity that, that has, that has very much sexism playing into it because we'd

02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:31.760
upskirt on dudes is not a thing. Where's that achievement? That's not, you know,

02:16:31.760 --> 02:16:38.320
that's not a thing. Where's that anime? There's no, I haven't seen too many dudes in kilts.

02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:43.360
Yeah. And games. So anyway, and then so, but now you have this additional kind of like thing where,

02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:49.680
where actually it's pretty cool that there's an intersex character in a game because there

02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:56.480
are intersex people in this world, quite a few of them. And I'm sure that representation is awesome,

02:16:56.480 --> 02:17:01.680
you know? So in, in that regard, you go near is doing an awesome thing by having an intersex

02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:08.000
character be, and then it's like, and they do this really stupid thing with it and it sucks.

02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:15.680
So that's, that's where we're left with, right? It's just, this is the kind of thing we really

02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:20.560
shouldn't be encouraging. Yeah, no, I agree. I agree. I think they should probably, uh,

02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:25.440
just take, take that achievement out and replace it with something that has to do with the game.

02:17:25.440 --> 02:17:29.200
And it's not like she's wearing much of anything. She's basically wandering around and, you know,

02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:37.440
negligee. Yeah. But I, I do, I do understand where folks are very upset. I don't want to make sure

02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:40.800
this is clear too, especially when I'm using the word like immature. I want to make clear,

02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:46.480
I do understand where folks are very upset about this focus on genitalia, right? Because

02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:52.720
unfortunately in our culture, you know, my brain goes to that Katie Couric interview when she's

02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:58.720
interviewing what Laverne Cox and Carmen Carrera, I think that's her name, right? That was on Drag

02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:04.080
Race all those years ago and then transitioned. Right. Um, and Katie Couric, who you think is

02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:09.600
this like respectable journalist wants to talk about genitalia. And it's like that,

02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:15.600
why do we as a society have a fascinating fascination with that? That is a much deeper

02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:21.360
question I expect us to tackle on this show. But my point is, is that like, that's just like

02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:26.720
why this is so like, if you're having difficulty understanding, why does this get to the level of

02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:34.720
transphobic? Because it, it makes it seem like gender is only genitalia and it's not that.

02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:38.400
Would you agree with what I said, Jamie, or you want to course correct me a little bit?

02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:48.080
Gender is not genitalia. Exactly. You know, your genitalia is basically what variety of

02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:54.000
reproduction you can and cannot do. Yeah. End of story. Yep. And some people, I have

02:18:54.720 --> 02:19:03.360
several friends who are intersex. One, um, who, uh, actually does have fairly working parts of

02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:06.640
anatomy and I'm not going to name names or anything. And I only know this because I'm a

02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:19.360
good friend. You know, it's, um, it's definitely, um, definitely something that these are mostly

02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:25.360
children by the way, who are having sex change performed on them or an assignment physically

02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:35.040
inflicted on them in the hospital. Um, gender is personal. It's not a preference. Stop using

02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:42.240
preferred pronouns and just call them pronouns. Gender is a part of who you are and how you

02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:52.480
identify. And so it's nobody's business, what genitalia that, that you have and parents should

02:19:52.480 --> 02:19:58.000
stop announcing it to the world. They say, Oh look, I have a little human. Are you saying

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:03.520
we shouldn't create earthquakes with giant explosions? God's been dropping hints to knock

02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:10.080
it off. God's been dropping a lot of hints to knock it off. And I'll actually even say in

02:20:10.080 --> 02:20:17.600
Judaism there's seven genders. Oh, interesting. Yeah. Although there should be one for, for

02:20:18.240 --> 02:20:24.000
female bodies in my position, but I won't, I won't go on that. So yeah, you, again,

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:29.600
a whole other podcast going on here. And, and honestly, if this is of interest to you and

02:20:29.600 --> 02:20:34.480
you don't have to consider yourself intersex, transgender, whatever, to be interested in these

02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:38.480
topics, that's, that's education listening to folks, right? Let's just, so if you want to

02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:42.240
listen on this stuff, there's lots of podcasts out there, but just to, just to shift the

02:20:42.240 --> 02:20:46.320
conversation back a little bit to this, I just, you know, I think it's just very frustrating to

02:20:46.320 --> 02:20:51.040
see like, Oh, this company did a great thing in the story and then they shot it in the foot

02:20:51.040 --> 02:20:56.720
with this, you know, dumb thing. Yeah. So, yeah. And I know what their goal was. Two steps forward,

02:20:56.720 --> 02:21:00.480
two steps back, right? I know their goal was to harken back to the other achievement,

02:21:00.480 --> 02:21:05.280
but like I said, the other achievement shouldn't have existed either. Yeah. No,

02:21:05.280 --> 02:21:09.840
right. Absolutely right. It was, it was, and it may be in the instance of Nier Automata,

02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:14.560
it's definitely, you know, that, that, um, sexist immaturity thing. I'm sorry. I forgot the exact

02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:18.800
phrase you use, but it's, it's, it's definitely that. And it's just kind of one of those, again,

02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:25.200
if gaming culture wants to be seen as grownups, then we kind of have to act grown up. That's what

02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:29.920
it boils down to. If you, and if you're sitting there going, but my anime titties, but my it's

02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:36.480
like, you have problems with yourself. Like there's a whole other art form for you

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:42.880
that needs to stay out of video games. And I need to, I need to correct myself. It's actually six,

02:21:42.880 --> 02:21:50.400
uh, uh, six genders in Judaism. Thank you. All right. Let's, um, let's try to cleanse the

02:21:50.400 --> 02:21:55.280
palette a little bit because, um, this there's some interesting similarities in this next story.

02:21:55.760 --> 02:22:02.080
And I'll, I'll just turn it over to Loki. Yeah, this is kind of surprising. Um, so there

02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:10.720
gearbox gearbox exec, uh, David Najib had testified against the Texas house bill 4042,

02:22:10.720 --> 02:22:15.120
which would force a transgender athletes in public schools to compete in the sports.

02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:19.840
According to the gender, they were assigned at birth. Uh, he basically said, I'm a Texan.

02:22:19.840 --> 02:22:25.200
I was born here and I know it's a welcoming, friendly place. I want to push that and not

02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:32.400
making up laws. We don't need, um, you know, our games company in competition or in competition

02:22:32.400 --> 02:22:37.120
worldwide, we sell more to Asia than we do in the United States. We bring in a lot of money

02:22:37.120 --> 02:22:42.000
into the state. We're headquartered here. We don't drive us to where we have to start expanding

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:45.840
outside of Texas and outside of the country. We want to keep doing business here.

02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:51.920
Um, basically threatening that, you know, if something like this passes that they might

02:22:51.920 --> 02:22:57.600
consider taking their business elsewhere. Um, it's kind of, it's kind of sickening that,

02:22:57.600 --> 02:23:02.800
you know, we see this kind of stuff happening right now and it's not just in Texas either. So,

02:23:03.360 --> 02:23:09.680
yeah, I don't know. Thank you for, um, being our token heterosexual saying that by the way,

02:23:09.680 --> 02:23:13.760
cause we need more people like you to recognize that this is, this is wrong.

02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:17.680
It's ridiculous. All the things in the world right now, why are we worried about like

02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:25.600
childhood sports? Who cares? Yeah. I, I, you know, you're preaching to the choir with me

02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:29.600
and, and our soccer and all that, but again, it's, it's very nice to hear you say that.

02:23:29.600 --> 02:23:35.360
Um, and it's, it's, and, and it's nice to hear gearbox say that, which is a company that has,

02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:39.760
again, it's, it's interesting cause now we have a two steps back, two steps forward situation,

02:23:39.840 --> 02:23:44.160
you know, gearbox is, uh, if it's saying constellations, it's not Randy Pitchford that

02:23:44.160 --> 02:23:50.960
said that. So, you know, maybe, maybe it's still terrible. It's a sign of, of change in the guard

02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:56.400
at gearbox. Perhaps. I don't know. I don't know, but it is refreshing to see them really take a

02:23:56.400 --> 02:24:01.040
stand with that. You know, saying, you know, we're a Texas company. We do this. This law is not what

02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:06.720
we're about. And, and it's been nice that in some other States, there have been some surprising

02:24:06.720 --> 02:24:11.600
people that you would expect might support this. Right. Cause it was, it was vetoed in one state.

02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:15.760
I'm unfortunately, this is happening far too often frequently, or I can't remember what

02:24:15.760 --> 02:24:19.680
States are doing what, but it's been vetoed by like two different governors in two different

02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:26.800
States, if I'm not mistaken. So. Yeah. And, and, um, actually, you know, to give Randy some, uh,

02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:35.120
prompts at least, um, he did echo the sentiment that was put forward by, um, the other guy saying,

02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:39.680
you know, the kinds of people that are best in the world at creating technology, at creating

02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:45.040
entertainment, these are people that do not want to live in places that are seen as discriminatory.

02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:49.600
So at least he did kind of echo that sentiment as well, but still, you know,

02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:57.040
he's got his own problems. Uh, going to chat, uh, Bobby Blackwolf says I'm in Georgia,

02:24:57.040 --> 02:25:00.960
so I can help give Texas some pointers on companies leaving their state. And yeah, that's,

02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:05.840
you know, another place where, uh, the companies have been voting with their wallets, so to speak.

02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:10.160
So, um, yeah, you have to vote with your wallet cause they're making it impossible to do it

02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:18.480
otherwise. It's I, I, my, my laugh is a laugh of shock at the accuracy of that statement.

02:25:18.480 --> 02:25:26.880
Like drag them, expose them. Loki. Yes. All right. Oof. Um, as she, 100 mountain chat

02:25:26.880 --> 02:25:30.640
says as someone who works in sports, this is such a vindictive, nasty thing to do. It's

02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:34.160
just unnecessary. Yes. Again, we're going to have a whole another podcast on this topic,

02:25:34.160 --> 02:25:38.720
but I'm very thankful to hear that a lot of people, you know, no matter, uh, I, we've got

02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:43.040
a variety of backgrounds here, a variety of, you know, life steps, a variety of political leanings.

02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:46.640
And I think most people are pretty much in agreement on this and maybe the folks that

02:25:46.640 --> 02:25:50.640
aren't are being a little more quiet and listening to the reasons why we're saying it's such a bad

02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:54.720
thing. And that's, that's a, that's a good thing too. Uh, hopefully maybe change a few minds here

02:25:54.720 --> 02:26:03.760
as to why this is just, it's, it's gross thing to do. So, um, anyhow. Uh, uh, yeah. Pixel pocket

02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:07.840
says, uh, the anti-trans bills occurring in a handful of states are so utterly fucked up

02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:12.480
and hurting people who cannot defend themselves children and follows that up with think of the

02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:17.360
children. Oh no, we don't mean all children. So, um, very well said there by pixel pockets.

02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:23.040
I'll leave it on that note. Um, although they, thanks to gearbox for, uh, sticking up for that.

02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:28.560
And, um, I th I think, um, do, do a good thing for the gaming industry. We kind of talked about

02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:32.960
making the game industry sound like grownups. I think that was a very grownup thing for them

02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:40.080
to do. So awesome. All right, moving on. Let's talk about, let's talk about something a little

02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:45.600
silly. Um, but, but in the best possible way, and I think a good last story tonight to end on,

02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:52.560
and that has to do with this up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right. Be a start,

02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:56.720
select, start. They, they all have different endings to them, but I'm sure you all recognize

02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:03.760
that as the infamous Konami code, right? Well, did you know the Konami code is now 35 years old?

02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:11.760
Hello old and aging. Guess what? That's you. Uh, and I believe that code was first in the game.

02:27:11.760 --> 02:27:15.280
Gradius, uh, was where that code showed up for the first time. And then of course,

02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:18.880
I think a lot of people know it from Contra though, certainly. Uh, but all of those,

02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:23.840
of course, the early Konami games where that sequence would unlock certain things or what

02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:30.560
have you. Um, now. Konami in celebration of the 35th anniversary. Yes. Konami did something. It's

02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:36.000
very exciting. Uh, they've teamed up with some musicians to do some remixes, uh, from Gradius

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:41.280
in what they're calling a lo-fi hip hop compilation. So it's remixes of what's that?

02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:46.560
So that sounds nice. Oh yeah. It's cool. Uh, a remix of the, I would, I would play it here,

02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:50.240
but that gets into weird copyright things. And so I just would encourage you to seek this out

02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:55.840
on your own. Um, it's a remix of the theme by Tokyo machine is included on that as well. Uh,

02:27:55.840 --> 02:27:59.360
and, uh, there's also some merchandise, of course, of course, cause you know,

02:27:59.360 --> 02:28:04.000
Konami is getting into that right now, selling the merchandise like Gradius t-shirts and logos from

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:09.200
Gradius titles and so forth. Um, anyhow, there, the video, if you want to check that out is on

02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:14.320
YouTube. So check Konami's YouTube channel, and there is a company illustration and motion graphic

02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:20.240
to, uh, kind of, uh, uh, mimic what's going on there. And, uh, there's six tracks in the list

02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:24.640
and, uh, you can check that out over on Konami's YouTube channel. So, uh, a fun way to kind of

02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:30.880
celebrate something that a lot of us as gamers just have ingrained into our brains that up,

02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:36.320
up, down, down, left, right, left, right BA start. Yeah. Uh, quick can, does anyone remember the

02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:45.200
championship code from the Capcom code? Uh, down, right, up, left YB. If I remember right,

02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:47.920
this is how you unlock championship mode. If I, somebody can fact check me on that,

02:28:47.920 --> 02:28:51.680
see if my memory still works after all these years, but I say downright as in the button

02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:58.080
down, right, up, left YB, I believe is it. So, uh, Bobby black Wolfen chat, uh, giving us the,

02:28:58.080 --> 02:29:08.640
uh, infamous IDD, QD and those codes IDBFG. Uh, Oh, I was right. Dark Tetsuya says I'm right.

02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:13.920
Yeah. Don right up left YB or it's XA at the Japanese version. Okay. Fair enough. Um,

02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:20.080
orange, right. Says ABA CABB. That's the blood code, right? From world combat. If I remember

02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:25.600
right. Um, ABA and Ikari warriors. That's right. Abba. My favorite code in any game.

02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:33.040
Good. All right. Anyway. Excellent. So, uh, of good reminiscent on the codes and all that

02:29:33.040 --> 02:29:39.200
good stuff. I still need to do the one in dead by daylight to get the Vic Viper. That would not work

02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:45.280
for the life of me on the Xbox one, but I need to try it now. It doesn't work on console. It

02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:49.840
only there's people that have YouTube's of it where they're doing it stopped working after

02:29:49.840 --> 02:29:57.120
July, 2020. Why did they turn it off? They did hold on. I've actually got the thing to tell you

02:29:57.120 --> 02:30:06.400
rude, but it still works on PC. Still works on PC. They ended this. I've got the article.

02:30:06.400 --> 02:30:09.760
No wonder it didn't work. And I'm looking at these YouTube's where I'm like, the guy's doing

02:30:09.760 --> 02:30:18.960
it slower than I, God. Um, yeah. June, June 16th, 2020. Um, it, it ended on, um, on the console

02:30:18.960 --> 02:30:25.120
versions. Oh, that's irritating. All right. Well, thank you for letting me know I can stop. There's

02:30:25.120 --> 02:30:29.600
another reason to buy it on steam so I can have my Vic Viper. All right. Yeah. Uh, this is the part

02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:33.600
of the show where we would go to the mailbag, participate at orange launch radio.com. If you

02:30:33.600 --> 02:30:40.320
want to send us an email, but I believe that is an empty mailbag this week, right? Yeah. All right.

02:30:40.320 --> 02:30:45.920
So you know what that means? Drag race talk. Season 13 finally ended. I didn't watch it,

02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:50.640
but of course Twitter filled me in on it. All right. Then I won't worry. All right. Don't

02:30:50.640 --> 02:30:57.040
chat. Don't spoil please. Cause dark soccer for myself right now. Oh, all right. Just tell me

02:30:57.040 --> 02:31:03.760
we get dark soccer's reaction live. Uh, I, um, I, I want to be very careful not to spoil it for

02:31:03.760 --> 02:31:09.360
anyone out there. Although I guess it's been 48 hours. Oh yeah. It was the second person I would

02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:13.680
have wanted. Yeah. I, I, and I would say it was the per I did watch the beginning of the season.

02:31:13.680 --> 02:31:18.400
I would say it was extremely obvious to me that person was going to win from like episode three.

02:31:19.120 --> 02:31:23.680
So I, I don't know why everyone, I get that. Um, one of the other contestants was really

02:31:23.680 --> 02:31:28.000
showing a lot and I think had a lot of people rooting, um, for them, uh, uh, throughout the

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:33.360
season. But, um, but I think it was obvious from the third episode, this dress. Yeah. I'll have

02:31:33.360 --> 02:31:37.280
to link you to pick the, the picture. I already know what it is. This is the one that looks like

02:31:37.280 --> 02:31:43.760
the final fantasy boss meets pinhead. All right. You'll have to already send it to me. The one,

02:31:43.760 --> 02:31:48.800
the white dress. Oh no, it's I'm thinking of something else. Nevermind. Okay. All right.

02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:53.680
Anyway. Uh, hopefully all star six starts soon. That one's going to be on paramount plus. What

02:31:53.680 --> 02:32:00.240
do you think about that? Drag race, uh, taken one of its biggest, uh, spinoffs to, uh, another,

02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:07.680
uh, uh, service. It's kind of interesting. I wish they'd just stay somewhere. All right.

02:32:09.040 --> 02:32:13.440
By the way, guys, I'm trying to talk Shane into the, um, Pokemon stream and I think,

02:32:14.160 --> 02:32:18.800
um, uh, he's, he's into it. He's like, is this another point reward thing? And I'm going to be

02:32:18.800 --> 02:32:23.760
like, no, just, just because, but he says, I don't see why this wouldn't be doable. So I think we're

02:32:23.760 --> 02:32:27.920
onto something there. So we may, we may have a special stream here at VOG just because not

02:32:27.920 --> 02:32:31.040
everything has to be a point reward thing, right? Bobby. I got to get clearance from Bobby. Not

02:32:31.040 --> 02:32:34.960
everything has to be a point reward thing, right? Bobby. All right. I'm almost positive. Uh, he'll

02:32:34.960 --> 02:32:43.040
be with me on the same. He's like content. Great. Do it. All right. Um, okay. Thank you. Bobby says

02:32:43.040 --> 02:32:47.920
not everything has to be a point reward. Great. Excellent. All right. Uh, let's get into some

02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:55.840
last minute stories then. Uh, Loki. All right. So, uh, it's happened. It's happened. We're

02:32:55.840 --> 02:33:02.320
finally getting Lego, green Mario, and I'm very excited. I should, I forgot to slot that story.

02:33:03.520 --> 02:33:08.960
It's it was coming out. It's coming out in August. So in my head, that was in the first

02:33:08.960 --> 02:33:15.680
half of the show, Loki. It's all good. Yeah. So a brand new starter set coming, uh, with boom,

02:33:15.680 --> 02:33:20.640
boom and a pink Yoshi. So I will have to pick that up, but that's, uh, yeah, coming out

02:33:20.640 --> 02:33:27.520
August 1st, which is actually a year after the original, uh, Lego Mario set bid. Um,

02:33:27.520 --> 02:33:31.040
so looking forward to that and what other sets are coming. Cause obviously now that they have

02:33:31.040 --> 02:33:36.880
a new starter set, they're going to have some more, uh, stuff coming. So very interesting.

02:33:38.720 --> 02:33:43.680
Uh, pixel, pixel pockets and chat says, what else happened on the show? And Rob's head,

02:33:43.680 --> 02:33:46.960
um, we had the listenership we had in 2006.

02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:55.200
I'm teasing. I love you guys that show up every week. I really do. All right. Sorry, Loki.

02:33:56.320 --> 02:34:02.560
Um, yeah. So, uh, there was that. And then apparently some rumors that, um,

02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:09.680
Sony is blocking, uh, resident evil eight from games past because of force parody.

02:34:10.320 --> 02:34:15.360
Oh, I did see some of the rumors about that and that whole, the contract page that leaked

02:34:15.360 --> 02:34:21.200
and all that stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I honestly though, should that surprise anyone? Like people are

02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:27.600
acting like it's this big ass deal, but like if Sony is going to spend the, the free promotion,

02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:32.720
when they put a resident evil trailer in their PlayStation showcase and all this stuff,

02:34:32.720 --> 02:34:36.320
they're basically giving them free advertising, you know, and there's, you know, certain

02:34:36.320 --> 02:34:41.760
concessions. So yes, they're going to be like, Hey, you can't go and then give away this game

02:34:41.760 --> 02:34:47.120
on game pass. You know, when it's, we're trying to sell copies on PlayStation by having these ads

02:34:47.120 --> 02:34:52.160
here. I'm not sure why this is shocking to some people. Um, I think it's just shocking to see it

02:34:52.160 --> 02:34:56.720
in writing and people feel like they're in a secret club getting to read these leak contracts

02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:00.160
and stuff. And I get that. Like, it's like, Ooh, I'm seeing something I'm not supposed to see.

02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:04.320
And it's a little bit scandalous, you know, but I don't think it's, this should not be

02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:09.440
surprising whatsoever. Um, and Bobby black woven chat says, yeah, I don't begrudge Sony for this.

02:35:09.440 --> 02:35:14.640
They're doing a lot of marketing and free demos and stuff. Absolutely. I don't like,

02:35:14.640 --> 02:35:20.960
this shouldn't be a surprise. Like, honestly, be happy you got MLB the show. And I say this

02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:26.160
as some, and you guys know, I've been very pro Xbox the last couple of years on this show. Okay.

02:35:26.160 --> 02:35:30.080
So like, but I'm going to say, I'm going to say to the Microsoft folks on this one,

02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:34.960
just back off. Okay. Like this, this, this one makes sense.

02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:40.400
Okay. Loki, uh, there was something else I saw too, about them renewing their trademark for

02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:47.200
PlayStation home. So was that a thing that's happening? That is another route. Well,

02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:53.440
we don't know. Uh, it's, it's in that rumor status since it's not, yeah. Um, curious.

02:35:53.440 --> 02:35:57.840
I don't know. I don't, I don't know if we should jump to the conclusion it's happening.

02:35:57.840 --> 02:36:02.800
It would be a very nice summertime announcement. Um, but I'm sure there's a lot of people going,

02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:08.640
Ooh, PlayStation home makes a lot of sense for VR. Um, which I could definitely see it going that

02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:14.400
way. Uh, uh, uh, uh, VR chat type of thing, I guess. Um, but I, I honestly would like to see

02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:20.800
PlayStation home. I know we gave PlayStation home a lot of shit, but we had very ardent fans of

02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:26.080
PlayStation home really open our eyes to the capability of, of what it could do over the years.

02:36:26.160 --> 02:36:31.920
And I think the most frustrating part was that like, you really saw the limits of what they

02:36:31.920 --> 02:36:37.360
were able to do in PlayStation home. Like, Oh man, it would have been awesome if like our clubhouse

02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:43.200
could have played a YouTube or a trailer or have maybe custom items that we did, whatever happened

02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:47.120
to the trophies for achievements and stuff that you could actually put on your wall. Like there

02:36:47.120 --> 02:36:52.480
were, there were a lot of potential things that, that home never realized. And then it did other

02:36:52.480 --> 02:36:55.840
things that were kind of neat, like the fake E3 booth, the virtually three booth. That was kind

02:36:55.840 --> 02:37:01.520
of cool. So I would hope that maybe the technology of the PlayStation five can really let them

02:37:01.520 --> 02:37:06.240
advance those capabilities of PlayStation home, but they need to be able to advance those

02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:10.480
capabilities of PlayStation home for me to care. If they're just doing the same thing they did on

02:37:10.480 --> 02:37:17.120
the PlayStation three, then, then it's going to be flop city. I don't think I I'm trying to believe

02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:23.120
that wouldn't be the case that with an upgrade to PlayStation five comes more than better graphics

02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:30.800
and better stuff that Sony really is looking at. How do we make a social thing to respond to Twitch

02:37:30.800 --> 02:37:35.760
to respond to, you know, and then when they go and get rid of communities that really sends a

02:37:35.760 --> 02:37:43.360
mixed signal, not the communities was really used at all. I like to think Sony did that in

02:37:43.440 --> 02:37:48.720
preparation for this, but am I giving them too much credit? I'm worried I am.

02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:54.880
Anyway, thank you for bringing that up. I forgot about that one. And that one's important.

02:37:55.440 --> 02:38:00.160
No problem. Hi, Midna. I see Kitty on cam. Here we go. All right. Anything else?

02:38:00.160 --> 02:38:06.080
Mama has some string cheese. No, that's it. All right. Then I think we're about ready to wrap up.

02:38:06.080 --> 02:38:10.080
So I want to thank everybody for listening to Orange Lawns Radio tonight. Thank you so much

02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:14.160
for participating with our show. If you enjoyed what you heard here on OLR, please tell a friend

02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:17.760
or two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has

02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:23.920
a voice. But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, what can we do? A nice five star review on

02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:28.000
a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this podcast will go a very long way. Spotify,

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:32.320
we're on there too. So thank you very much to everybody that does that. An auto host here at

02:38:32.320 --> 02:38:39.520
Twitch TV also does wonders. So thank you to those of you that go and do that as well. If you feel so

02:38:39.520 --> 02:38:45.040
inclined, you can also support our store over at vognetwork.com slash shop if you want to be able

02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:53.040
to shop for some merchandise there like an OLR sticker or things like that. So thank you. Again,

02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:57.280
a lot of you were very generous tonight during the show here live on Twitch. A lot of you are

02:38:57.280 --> 02:39:01.840
very generous in the things you say throughout the week online on Twitter and all that stuff.

02:39:01.840 --> 02:39:06.320
So thank you very much for everybody that takes time out to say hello and they appreciate what

02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:10.640
we're doing here. We appreciate you. Thank you so much. It was funny. There was actually somebody

02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:16.240
I was having a disagreement with on Twitter. We were having a spirited disagreement, not an

02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:20.640
F U U F and F and things like that. It was, you know, oh, we disagree on this. Here's my perspective.

02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:25.040
Here's my perspective. But I thought it was very nice that he ended it with, hey, I'm a big fan of

02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:29.760
OLR. And I was like, that does mean a lot. Even if we don't agree on this one particular issue,

02:39:30.080 --> 02:39:37.120
I it still means a lot that people are. So inclined to engage and interact with the show

02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:42.000
and and the people behind it after all these years coming up on 19 years in June.

02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:48.160
All right. I think we should get final thoughts, shouldn't we? I will start with Dark Sakura.

02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:54.400
Please stay tuned. Please stay tuned. Please, please, please. I need the attention.

02:39:54.480 --> 02:39:59.840
All right. At least you're honest. All right. My channel, I want I want to do more things

02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:06.480
for everybody. And the only way I can do them is if people join in. My final thought is, please

02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:12.160
cross your fingers and toes. We put our first bid in on a house today. And I'm not thinking we're

02:40:12.160 --> 02:40:18.640
going to get it, but I had this house is perfect. It has it like it has an upstairs loft area that

02:40:18.640 --> 02:40:24.000
would be perfect for this show if we wanted to continue to do it in person. So and it's much

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:30.400
closer to you, Dark Sakura. So we'll see what happens anyway. Loki, last but not least, your

02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:36.640
final thought. So during the show, I ordered labels for my cartridges, so hopefully they turn

02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:43.040
out. All right. Getting closer. Appreciate that. All right. I can't wait to own a physical copy.

02:40:43.040 --> 02:40:47.360
All right. That's it, everybody. We'll be back to do it in seven days. Thank you for tuning into our

02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:52.560
show this week. And we'll see you next week when, oh, my gosh, it's actually going to be May, isn't

02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:58.560
it? Please leave your Justin Timberlake memes out of this. That is overdone. That's it. Have
