1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,300
Any act of creation at scale is a strange beast. Businesses often prioritize so much

2
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,440
time and effort into quote big wins that they overlook the small fixes that can add up to

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,260
a more significant win. Toast, a Grand Theft Auto player, not a Rockstar employee, having

4
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,600
no access to GTA source code, diagnosed and implemented a change that improved PC load

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,520
times by 70% of a multiple minutes long process. This wasn't worth the time of Rockstar employees?

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,120
At least they did write and made it worth Host's time and effort.

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,240
This is the update to a fantastic story. Join your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,200
Loki for more of this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,160
the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:55,120
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:02,200
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:10,320
episode number 861 for this March the 21st of 2021. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joining

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,200
you here from the studio where we would usually tape in person, but obviously with everything

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,560
going on in the world for the past year now, we have been taping thanks to the magic of

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,920
Discord. So I am joined remotely by the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

16
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,920
Hello.

17
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,920
Hi, how are you?

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,320
I'm all right. It's, uh, I pulled my shoulder or something.

19
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,960
Ouch. I'm sorry to hear that.

20
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,080
Yeah, that's okay. That's what drugs are for.

21
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,840
And you have a nice new, um, well, it's kind of new setup. I know you got a new...

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,400
Oh, I have a super new setup.

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Yeah. And your camera looks a little like it's weird because you didn't change your

24
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,840
camera, but it still looks nicer somehow.

25
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:53,600
Yeah. Well, um, my, my old, what, 12 year? No, it was a little bit less than that. Maybe

26
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:02,320
10 year old PC has now been replaced with a shiny new Mac Mini M1 and it is super fast.

27
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:10,960
I was playing in Logic Pro earlier today, making music. Um, I also, uh, got one of those

28
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:22,760
LG, uh, HD, uh, ultrawide monitors with a very lovely refresh rate on it. Um, and, uh,

29
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:31,080
so far I'm really feeling no pain. I love my new machine. Um, I think that it processes

30
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,760
now people are saying that I sound a little bit quieter, but, um, I think though that

31
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:45,320
I'm dealing with a system that's going to work better for sound processing. So, and

32
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,560
I did do some audio balancing tonight. So those listening either live or on the podcast

33
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,440
feed may notice our volume is a little different. Cause even I noticed on some prior episodes,

34
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,920
I was way quieter than like Loki. So like I, I tried to balance some things out with

35
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,320
you getting the new setup. So it might just take a little bit of adjusting too.

36
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:10,280
I just moved my mic a little bit to where I'm actually speaking into it. So, um, well,

37
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,600
and I have the same mold, cheap ring light I got on wish an age ago and which does well

38
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:22,280
enough. Hey, whatever works. But I mean, this is the setup that I wanted from the get go.

39
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:29,400
You know, I, I really like my, my audio technical mic and I finally have my pop filter problem

40
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,120
figured out. And you know, I just need, I needed this computer. I still have my PC.

41
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,280
I'm just trying to decide what I'm going to do when mass effects comes out. If they don't

42
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,280
do a Mac version. Now quickly, before I move on to Loki, I did want to mention you texted

43
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,360
me when you got your new setup because you had to send me your background on your new

44
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,560
like ultra widescreen monitor and it's perfect. I wish you could show it, but obviously it's

45
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,120
going to be hard to do with the camera, but describe your new background for folks.

46
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,240
It is, it is, uh, the scene from super Metroid where the, uh, scientists are dead in the

47
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:12,400
Metroid is sitting inside the little tube in the center, but it's a widescreen version

48
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:20,320
of it. So I reckon they just took different screenshots and splice them together. And

49
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,640
if you guys remember the title screen to super Metroid, you'll kind of laugh at this because,

50
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,480
um, dark soccer called me earlier today so we could do a check and she didn't have a

51
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,480
ring light on because you know, when we're not live, we can be like a glance, not glamorous.

52
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,520
And I was like, you, you sound fine, but you look blue and it's because her background

53
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,400
with that Metroid, you know, it's very blue and super Metroid, if you remember, right.

54
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,720
And she's like, if my background is glowing on me, I was like, Oh, that's funny. Cause

55
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,740
you look like you just got out of the movie avatar. So I'll turn off my ring light. So,

56
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,600
so maybe it'll show. Okay. A little, yeah, it's just, you're a little purple when you

57
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,720
do that. Yes. A little bit, girl, look how blue you look. All right. Let's say wearing

58
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,400
a blue shirt. Let's say hello to tech master. Loki. Hey, Loki. Hey, how's it going? Good.

59
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,840
How are you? I'm doing fine. So, um, apparently, uh, I was talking a little bit last week about

60
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,920
getting the first shot of Moderna vaccine because that had happened earlier in the day.

61
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,620
And I never really had any side effects besides the sore arm, but I heard that you got your

62
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,580
shot in the last couple of days. Yeah. So I got the Johnson and Johnson shot on Friday.

63
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:37,740
So that one, unlike the Moderna and the Pfizer one are it's one and done. So I'm done. Well,

64
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,880
tech, technically you have to wait two weeks. So the antibodies to build up, but yes, for

65
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,700
all intents and purposes, you're done. So, um, so you're going to be, you're going to

66
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:51,740
be, so I, I did your wife get the same one. Yeah, she did. Cause I know when she saw me

67
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,100
getting mine, she was like, I've been trying to get mine for what's going on, you know,

68
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,860
that whole type of thing. But now the funny thing is you guys are going to be fully immunized

69
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,740
before I am, because I have to wait till April 11th to get the second shot because of the

70
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:09,740
whole Johnson and Johnson thing. So, um, but that's, you know, and again, don't, uh, if

71
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,980
you can get vaccinated folks and I see, I'm seeing more people on Facebook talking about

72
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,420
it. I'm seeing more people on Twitter talking about it. I'm seeing people in chat talking

73
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,420
about it. So it's great that more people are getting their shots. If you're getting frustrated

74
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,140
because you can't get a vaccine yet, cause you don't qualify or whatever. I wouldn't

75
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:30,140
keep, keep this in the back of your mind. Every person that gets vaccinated is one more

76
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,780
weapon against the virus because that's one less person that the virus can get to. So

77
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,900
every person that gets vaccinated is help. So, uh, think of it that way. And it makes

78
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,540
it a lot less frustrating and it's, it's nice to see that it is ramping up. That's for sure.

79
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,540
Compared to where we were like back in January. Um, and yeah, they opened it up to everybody

80
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,140
like literally days after, like they told my wife, no, you can't get it. It was like

81
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:57,900
the next day they're all, Oh, you can't get it, but now you can. So well, it's still officially

82
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:05,900
not open to everybody. It's uh, right now that I think they're on tier one C. So it

83
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:12,020
might also just depend on where you go. That's true. But I got, because I have some preexisting

84
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:19,180
conditions. I got my alert through, uh, your turn, which is the California signup deal

85
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:26,060
for it. And so, um, now I know mine's one of the, the two, two shot ones cause it said

86
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:31,460
so on the website. I just don't know which one. So, well, and I was, I was laughing right

87
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,260
before we went on air tonight because if I got Moderna and Loki got Johnson and Johnson,

88
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,900
it would be really funny if dark soccer got Pfizer, although at the end of the day she

89
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,500
should take whatever they give her. But, uh, okay. It's, it's, it's half, it's half

90
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,140
and half now. We know it's, since it's going to be a two shot one, we know it's not J and

91
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,480
J so it's going to be one of the others. That would be really funny if each cohost here

92
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,980
had a different vaccine. That would be very, very funny. And then we would only allow guests

93
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:02,820
from overseas who got AstraZeneca.

94
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,820
It's just fun to say that though. It is. Well, and apparently I guess I heard the thing cause

95
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,700
they haven't authorized that one in the U S yet, even though I think they're using it

96
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,840
in Europe, but apparently they were like warehousing a bunch of that vaccine here.

97
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,840
We will get to video games, I promise. But this stuff is interesting because this stuff

98
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,340
is how we get conventions back. The AstraZeneca, I guess we were hoarding it here for when

99
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,940
they do authorize it. But they ended up sending a bunch of it, I guess, to Canada and Mexico

100
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:33,580
where it is authorized. So kind of interesting. So helping, helping to get the world vaccinated

101
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:38,460
a little more. So, all right. And some folks in chat are talking about the vaccines they

102
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,940
got. So DJ Rama S says, I got Pfizer and Bobby got Pfizer and says, Joe and Matt got

103
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:48,420
Pfizer. All right, fair enough. I mean, our, our chat room, as we often say, is the fourth

104
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,020
listener of our show because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network,

105
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,780
twitch.tv slash VOG network or VOG network, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern

106
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:02,620
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. So if a dark soccer ends up getting Moderna too,

107
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:07,440
then fine. Our chat room completes the Trinity there. So there we go. All right. Black and

108
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:16,080
Pat in chat says, I got sheet because Florida fingers because of Dolly. I know, I know.

109
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,120
And I think I said this last week, I really wouldn't have cared which of the three they

110
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,040
gave me. It was a huge relief just to get the vaccine. But the fact that I did get the

111
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,520
Dolly vaccine is like, okay, this does feel correct. Like I'm, I'm more than okay with

112
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,680
this. So we've been blessed by St. Dolly. That's right. That's right. All right. I,

113
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,440
it is a video game show. So let's talk about some video games. Let's talk about some big

114
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,800
news going on in the gaming world. Last week, we had the whole, um, Bethesda, um, getting

115
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,480
bought by Microsoft, which honestly it started months before it's just was official last

116
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,160
week. And then we saw, uh, quite quickly, some of the, uh, bang for the buck, shall

117
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,960
we say with the, you know, 20 Bethesda games on game pass. Uh, and you know, some of the

118
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,680
other stuff that we got there, their little fireside chat. So there was a big question

119
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:06,400
last week. All right. Who's Sony gonna buy? Who's Nintendo gonna buy and lo and behold,

120
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:12,280
Sony bought someone this week, but I would bet this was on no one shortlist, right? Loki,

121
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:18,560
what happened? Yeah. So they purchased, uh, Evo or I guess the evolution and championship

122
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:26,320
series known as Evo. So now that is going to be, I guess, under their arm, which doesn't

123
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,840
really make sense to me because Sony doesn't really have any first party fighting games.

124
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,500
I get it that there's a lot of fighting aids that are exclude. Well, they, you know, maybe

125
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:41,460
either it's timed exclusives or whatever on the platforms, but I guess this is, I don't

126
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:48,900
know how this necessarily works as far as partnerships go, but maybe I, I don't know.

127
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:53,460
But apparently though the original co-founders are going to be staying on as key advisors.

128
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,820
Um, doesn't sound like there's going to be too many changes as far as that goes aside

129
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:03,100
from it being under Sony's ownership. So, you know, some folks that were talking about

130
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,780
this in our discord, um, over a vog network.com slash discord, if you want to join our community

131
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:12,020
there and get in on some of the discussion, um, outside of just Sundays. And you know,

132
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:16,460
when we're hosting shows and live shows, um, some folks were talking about kind of reminding

133
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:22,460
us cause I know, you know, I'd forgotten it's been a year, but Evo had all those problems,

134
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:28,260
you know, kind of getting pulled into the harassment issues with the, the former CEO

135
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,340
or whoever was leading that and so forth. So, um, their brand was kinda, you know, tainted

136
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:38,220
a little bit from all of that last year and what that guy had done. Um, so it was interesting

137
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:44,300
that Sony kind of took that on, although I could also see where that is kind of a positive

138
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:50,620
because now Sony owns it and these problem people or person really from before can quickly

139
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,900
be, you know, ceremoniously kind of thrown out of the picture, uh, for Sony to take over.

140
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:59,660
But it does still seem like an interesting thing for Sony to get in on, doesn't it?

141
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:05,260
Yeah, exactly. Cause like I said, they don't really have any first party franchises that

142
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:10,340
would necessarily fit in there unless they're thinking of bringing PlayStation all stars

143
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:16,820
back. Um, but I mean, they did have, like I said, you know, several third party exclusives

144
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,560
for awhile. So they mean there's, you know, always been a Tekken series that used to be

145
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,160
on the original PlayStation. You've got, you know, street fighter four and five, I think

146
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,240
for even on PlayStation exclusively for a little bit. Um, it's the return of air guys

147
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,160
confirmed. Yeah. It's, it's, it's all in the cards right there. So, um, I don't know. It'd

148
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,240
be interesting to see what they do with this. I thought maybe like maybe as far as like

149
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,620
streaming this goes, they may have some sort of rights with that. Um, but they don't really

150
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,160
have a streaming service anymore. So I don't know where that's really going with it, but

151
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,600
Hey, cool that they're supporting it at least. Um, but I don't know what this means is necessarily

152
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:02,120
any changes for Evo. Um, maybe less killer instincts. I don't know. Um, DJ Rama S in

153
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:08,840
chat says, and it just scrolled off the screen. Sorry guys. I don't see Sony owning Evo as

154
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,880
a good thing, but it is what it is. I'd be curious more of your thoughts if you would

155
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,240
wouldn't mind elaborating on that. I'm kind of curious. Um, the, the why behind that,

156
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,080
um, SG100 Matt says free money. I am actually really fascinated by this acquisition. I can

157
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,480
see Sony trying to become the one-stop shop for Esports streaming. Nobody really has the

158
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,320
mantle than Twitch in a sense. The Evo move could be the start of something bigger. Well,

159
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,400
also I think something to consider is that, you know, maybe, um, PlayStation and Sony

160
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:40,600
is really trying to set it, set it up. Not so much, maybe like the broadcasting side

161
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,000
of Esports, but the playing and participation, because certainly when it comes to fighting

162
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,280
games, Sony's really got a lock in some ways in the fighting game sense. Like there's,

163
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,560
there's, and I'm sure someone in chat will quickly correct me, but I'm going to be honest.

164
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,900
When I think of Microsoft, I don't think of a lot of like fighting games that are like

165
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:04,520
huge on Xbox that Sony doesn't already have, you know? Sure. Like I know like Soul Calibur

166
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,820
6 is on game pass, but Sony's got that. You know what I mean? Um, and then when you go

167
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:14,080
to the Switch, you know, obviously they have Smash Brothers, but I feel like Smash Brothers

168
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,940
kind of lives on this island and Sony is always going to be like, I don't see Smash

169
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:24,760
Brothers leaving Evo anytime soon. Um, I think I feel like it's going to always exist on

170
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:30,400
its own little island and Sony is going to be perfectly okay with that. Oh Nintendo kind

171
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,640
of thing, you know, like, Oh, Oh, the kitty, the kitty match going on over there. Don't

172
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,920
hate me Smash community. This is like, I just feel like this is the attitude. Okay. From

173
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,520
the, you know, cause Nintendo sometimes gets that label and so forth, but I feel like Sony's

174
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,660
going to be more than okay with it sitting over there. And Sony really wants to take

175
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:53,800
the reins as, Hey, you want to play one-on-one fighting games. You're going to come to PlayStation

176
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,440
because that's where the Tekken is. That's where the Street Fighter is. That's where

177
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:04,140
er guys to it. Okay. Just kidding. But you know, this is the platform for all of that.

178
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:08,760
What do you guys think? Do you think that, you know, maybe Sony is trying to establish

179
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,760
itself as we are the fighting game console and trying to get a lock on a popular genre

180
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:21,440
perhaps? I think that they are seeing, Hey, this is going to print us money. That's what

181
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:28,280
I see. Perhaps writing games or money conventions or money. You'd have to spend it to win it.

182
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:34,200
Good point. Why not combine Evo with the PlayStation fan event they used to do in the winter? What

183
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:40,400
the hell was that called? PlayStation Fest or something? Something. Yeah. Why not? Sony

184
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:46,100
Wink Fest. There you go. Fifth Dream in chat says, Rob only speaks truth. Why thank you.

185
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:51,920
I try my best. Let's see. And as she says, no, drag the Smash community. They deserve

186
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,120
it. Hey, I know people in there that are pretty cool. I'm trying to be nice to everybody.

187
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,460
And I, Hey, I like Smash. All right. Well, and Bobby is saying that what's interesting

188
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:06,940
is Evo's prize pool is much lower than all of the other esports. But I think that if

189
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:14,220
that Evo has this reputation. True. That if you've, if you've made it at Evo, you have

190
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:20,180
really made it. That's true. There is a certain prestige level, but I think that, um, comparison

191
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:25,900
of like, I got it on sale is kind of interesting. You're right. Like the prize at what the international

192
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:30,700
for Dota is a way bigger, I mean, granted, that's not a fighting game either, but I get

193
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,740
it. Like that's a very different, uh, and much more expensive thing. Evo's the one everyone

194
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,220
knows. Yeah. Thank you, PixelPockets. That's what I was trying to think. A PlayStation

195
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:44,580
experience. That is what it was for sure. Okay. I got an elaborate, elaborated on answer

196
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:50,460
from DJ Roma S who says, the problem is when a corporate entity buys a fan event, this

197
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:56,700
even is, this isn't even fun anymore. It becomes too corporate. The fun behind it is gone.

198
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:02,180
Case in point packs. As I was reading this, my brain was going, packs, packs, packs,

199
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,860
case in point packs. Packs isn't what it was because of how it's run now. People are going

200
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:13,120
to mag fest now. I, I will, you know, especially because I know Roma is really well versed

201
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,920
in the convention circuit because of anime jam session and the work that him and his

202
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,220
co-host have been doing there for a very long time and covering all the different conventions.

203
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:30,340
Public aside, um, I, I think he makes a very good point that sometimes that corporate takeover

204
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,140
of a fan event can really drive it into the ground. I think he makes a very excellent

205
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,780
point when it comes to packs and I've experienced that firsthand as have some of you, some of

206
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:44,240
you are totally fine with packs the way it is now. And this is not menace, you know,

207
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,420
if you're having fun, go have fun. Don't tell, don't let anyone else tell you how you can

208
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:55,700
and can't have fun. Um, but, um, for me, packs isn't really fun anymore than it is than

209
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:02,400
what it was. So maybe I went on a couple of off years. I don't know, but, um, I could

210
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,820
see that hesitation about the, the corporate stuff, uh, running into the ground, but PlayStation

211
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,660
experience was okay from what I heard. I never went myself, but I heard other people that

212
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:17,020
went and had a good time with that. So, um, and oh, I'm being reminded in chat anime jam

213
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:22,180
session was on a convention today. That's right. They were doing a zenacon. Sorry. I

214
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:28,220
get the name right. Hope I did. So my brain is only so big and can only remember so much.

215
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:33,220
Uh, Jamie, you're chatting in chat and not here. What is this about anime expo? You were

216
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,740
mentioning, I was just replying to Ronma. He was saying another, uh, point of corporate

217
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:42,980
run convention, anime expo. Um, FYI, AX isn't a con it's a trade show, but it used to be

218
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:48,980
a convention. Ooh, good point. E3 is the same thing. E3 is a trade show, not a convention,

219
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,180
but they've kind of been going the other way. Like they're, they're starting to do more

220
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:59,740
things that a convention would do. Like I went to one of the last few AXs that were

221
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:06,580
still kind of friendly sized, you know, and then they had the one at the Disneyland hotel,

222
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:14,320
which was a clusterfuck, but that's the same one that I played my first physical DDR, which

223
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,540
was a third mix. So in a way, anime expo brought you here to orange launch radio and the star

224
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:27,580
of the convention was a chair. Um, if anyone knew is that that AX knows the chair, you

225
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:35,260
better comment. But, um, dragon con, I also cosplayed as a Jill Valentine, that con. I

226
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:40,140
think dragon con in part is very popular because it's not corporate run. It is still

227
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:46,460
very fan run and gets, and I know, and I bet people have wanted to buy it. I mean, I don't

228
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:51,160
know nothing when it comes to that stuff, but I would bet people wanted to buy it. Um,

229
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,020
and they've really stuck to their guns and keep it kept at a fan thing. And that's pretty

230
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,780
damn impressive. You know what they're pulling off down there in Atlanta. Um, there's a reason

231
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:04,760
I travel out there every year, pandemic exception, you know, so, uh, but I can't, I can't wait

232
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,880
for the convention stuff to come back. I really, really hope we do get to the other side of

233
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:17,020
this where we can have conventions again. I'm wondering where they were at the Disneyland

234
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:22,900
hotel again. Cause I've always done the, uh, the, uh, Anaheim convention center, like for

235
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:30,160
the last two decades or something like that. Oh, if we're talking, I'm sorry, you playing

236
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:37,000
DDR. That would have been like, what, like 99, 2000. Yeah. All right. And it was at

237
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,900
the Disneyland hotel and they wouldn't let cosplayers into the park unless they had changed

238
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,240
out of their costume because they don't want them getting mixed up with the characters.

239
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,000
You can't cost them there today. Some cosplayers could, that's how Disney Disney is a Disney

240
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,120
binding or Disney bounding bonding, Disney bounding. That's how Disney bounding began.

241
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:04,280
Like I Disney bounded, um, in, uh, 2019 when I went to, um, drag con. And what is, what

242
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,400
is Disney bounding? People may not know what that is. Disney bounding is where you wear

243
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,320
an outfit that's reminiscent of a Disney character. Now me, I flat out well, and now they're including

244
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:22,840
Marvel and star Wars in it. I flat out just wore my captain Marvel dress and bounced around

245
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:30,240
the, the park. Um, but like I ran into this, uh, this girl who wore, uh, like a yellow

246
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:42,280
top and red leggings and she was, uh, um, uh, Gaston. And it seemed like, it's a hint

247
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:47,260
of cosplay. It's a flavor. It's a dash of flavor. It's salt bay. Some people may call

248
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:53,260
this casual cosplay. I like the casual cosplay. I like that. Yeah. But like I saw another

249
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:59,580
girl who's wearing like a blue sundress with like a white apron on it and she was Alice.

250
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,220
We're just going to get a little flavor of that cosplay. Just a little flavor there.

251
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,900
All right. Yeah. Just look at that. I mean, there's tons of Disney bounding sites. Just

252
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:11,300
look it up. All right. Yeah. All right. Anyway, uh, we've gone from Sony buying a fighting

253
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:17,060
games show to talking about Disney bounding. Hey, that's the way it goes sometimes. All

254
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,740
right. Uh, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing

255
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:25,220
this week. How was your gaming week and what video games have you been playing this week?

256
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:31,740
Dark soccer. We'll start with you. I played animal crossing and I played word scapes,

257
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:39,020
which I should play a little bit more simply because I, I want to get higher than a 15th

258
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:43,700
place at the tournament or better because you know, they do that tournament once a week.

259
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:48,260
Yeah. And right now I'm level 16. I haven't played in a couple of weeks, but yeah, generally

260
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:55,260
I know how it works. Oh, I freaking love this game. Like it's, it's literally my, my wake

261
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:04,980
up in the day. And if I, if I don't play, then I actually feel like my brain is like

262
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:11,780
degrading in my head. It's your brain training. So the two things that I do to, um, to wake

263
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:20,920
myself up is I play, um, word scapes and I play, uh, um, I don't play, but I do my

264
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:28,960
Duolingo, which by the way, last week I had number one in diamond league, which is like

265
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,300
a big achievement. I don't even know what that means. Okay. A big achievement, diamond

266
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,800
league is the highest level of their various leagues and you have to have a certain number

267
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,660
of points to be like in the top, whatever. And then like, if you're in the top 10, you

268
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:48,900
advance, if you're the top 25, you stay in your current league. And one of the achievements

269
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:57,220
was to get level, uh, number one in the diamond league. And I stayed on top of it. I think

270
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:05,560
I earned something like 4,000 experience points, which normally I will do like maybe 1200.

271
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:12,380
Okay. So I studied a lot of Japanese and I better know family units very well by now.

272
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,080
When are we, when are we finally going to switch on this show where you do the Japanese

273
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:22,540
release dates and I just do the, when are we doing that? Because like, I think this,

274
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:27,420
this joke of, I always mispronounce like it's getting old and, uh, I think maybe we need

275
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:34,220
to switch that up. You're getting better. I'm well, 11 years of fucking up, uh, give

276
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,040
a monkey a typewriter. He'll type a novel eventually. Right? Isn't that the whole thing?

277
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:42,640
Remember if it's a Japanese word that ends in an E it's not like tone, it would be Tony.

278
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,180
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, you just need to have you do the French releases now and then that way

279
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:54,500
you know, I know some French, I used to be conversational and then I moved to California

280
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:59,560
where no one speaks French. All right, let's move on with our gaming weeks. Loki, how was

281
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:05,940
your game week? Um, I didn't play a whole time. I mainly played Minecraft again. Uh,

282
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:12,820
I've been just kind of, I don't know, still working on the giant tree in our realm. So

283
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:20,400
it's, it's similar to one of the hermits on hermit craft. Um, it's cows, the mega Erie

284
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,940
of doom. So it's this giant, huge tree that I'm working on right now. So as such, I've

285
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:31,960
also been bingeing a ton of hermitcraft on YouTube. So I've pretty much caught myself

286
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:38,520
up on a mumbo's is cows and now I'm going through tango tech, but lots of a really fun

287
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:44,760
streamers on there and stuff. Um, haven't worked on my game this week, but next week

288
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,500
I am going to be, I actually took a couple of days off, uh, for other things and I'm

289
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:56,560
going to be splitting the audio. Um, so I can cram more music in the game. I'm not looking

290
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:04,280
for to splitting that engine, but I will give it a try and hopefully that'll work. Um, I'm

291
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,640
hoping to have the special edition on soon so that I can actually release the physical

292
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,400
version of that. Cause I know everybody's been waiting for it. So we'll give it a go

293
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:19,120
this week. All right. Super excited to see the physical addition of that. All right.

294
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:23,220
All right. My gaming week. So, um, I haven't really played a lot of new stuff. I've been,

295
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,060
I've been doing a lot of gaming, but it's kind of a lot of the stuff I've talked about

296
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:30,780
on the show before, uh, still playing Final Fantasy 14, uh, trying to make money, right.

297
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:35,140
It got into some crafting and I mean, I've been doing crafting, but like trying to figure

298
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:39,100
out how to play the market board a little more. So, um, and man, there are some, there

299
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,220
are some real sniping, you know, when the, cause, uh, the whole thing, like you'll, you'll

300
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:47,020
try to put up an item and you try to kind of put it at the lowest price. Cause that's

301
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:50,160
the one people are going to buy, right? You're, you're going to buy on the lowest price you

302
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,120
see on the market board. Well, there's people that'll sit there and like the minute they

303
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,640
see that you've listed it lower price, they'll go in and they'll do it one Gil lower. And

304
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,840
it just becomes this game of everybody just starting to undercut each other. And that

305
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,720
becomes a whole little meta game in and of itself. But I will say that item that I must

306
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,260
have had to update the price. I'm not kidding. Like 15 times yesterday finally sold today.

307
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,020
So I'm happy about that. Cause I don't have to play that game with that other person anymore

308
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:18,820
about who's going to undercut who more recently. Um, so that's an interesting little meta game

309
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,280
I've been getting into with FOMI SE 14. I've been continuing along and dead by daylight,

310
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,560
uh, enjoying my time killing. I played my first survivor match. I did not care for it.

311
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:34,120
So I'm definitely a born killer when it comes to dead by daylight. Uh, thanks to, uh, Alan

312
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,320
who's been doing, uh, more and more of his own streaming here. I think a lot of you,

313
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,240
uh, regulars here have found his channel over at Alan alchemy and watched him play stuff.

314
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,000
He's been getting more into killer now. Um, because he found, he played a match randomly,

315
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,020
I think as doctor and, uh, found that it was actually a lot of fun and I actually went

316
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:56,660
in and I, I usually play pyramid head. That's my killer of choice. I got my first four kill.

317
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:01,520
So that means like I a hundred percent want one because a dead by daylight, if you don't

318
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:07,440
already know, it's an asymmetrical PVP game. So you play one versus four and I kind of

319
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,620
always hesitated on dead by daylight for the longest time. I'm not big on the scary jump

320
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,580
scary. Well, I say that, but yet like I love silent Hill and like psychological horror

321
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:19,620
and stuff like that. I don't like the jump scare games like five nights at Freddy's.

322
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,940
I'll play that for laughs, but I don't enjoy it. Like I'm just going to be real. I don't

323
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:29,740
enjoy it. Um, so like the jump scare type of things aren't usually my thing. Luckily

324
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,340
dead by daylight. Isn't quite like I found out like actually getting in there and playing

325
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:38,020
it more and watching Alan play it. It's not really big on jump scares, but even that heartbeat

326
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:42,540
thing really messes with me because when the killer gets closer to you, the heartbeat

327
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:50,140
gets louder and louder. And so that gets, uh, that gets really scary. Um, so, uh, and

328
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,380
then I think if you have Michael Myers as the killer, it actually plays the Halloween

329
00:28:53,380 --> 00:29:01,260
piano theme, um, a little bit. So there's that. Um, so anyway, um, I, I, I enjoy playing

330
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:06,020
as killer, um, where you're the one and you're trying to cause, cause there's no scary when

331
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,700
you're the killer, you're the one, you're the one causing all the scares. And so it's

332
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:14,180
a lot easier. So I found that I enjoy playing pyramid head and then thanks to Alan playing

333
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:18,100
doctor, I find that, and don't take that to a weird place. I mean, doctor, the killer

334
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:22,860
in dead by daylight, uh, that, um, I actually enjoy playing the doctor and dead by daylight

335
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:28,660
as well, who is kind of, he does like shock therapy basically. Um, so you use these shock

336
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:33,540
waves and uh, when you hit survivors with them, they'll scream out and so they kind

337
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,140
of give away their location. So it's kind of interesting. It's an interesting little

338
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:41,180
mechanic and really how he's very good at tracking survivors. Um, so, and that's kind

339
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,700
of what I liked about pyramid head too, is that if a survivor runs through one of your

340
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,660
little traps that you lie down, then, uh, trenches, then they get revealed. Um, it's

341
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:54,380
just that those, those, the survivors can avoid if they kind of know and they crouch

342
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:58,460
through it. The doctor stuff is much harder to avoid. So that's kinda, yeah. So anyway,

343
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,420
yeah, dead by daylight playing the killer. They can't just strip the skin off of them

344
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:07,140
like, you know, in silent Hill. No, only in the movie. That was only in the movie.

345
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:13,540
And uh, they, they, they actually have to balance it for the game. So he can't do like

346
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,780
everything he does in the game because right. He's, he's in another universe and the whole

347
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:22,060
like story, if you, cause dead by daylight apparently has this very rich story behind

348
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:28,060
it. If you look for it, um, is that you are not usually the one doing the killing. You

349
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:35,120
are sacrificing survivors to the entity and the entity has summoned these killers to do

350
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:41,180
its bidding. That's but once in a while, if you please the entity, then the entity will

351
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:45,300
let you kill people by your own hand. And that's a Maury. So, and pyramid head does

352
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:50,820
actually have his own built in Maury, but he takes the sword and he just slams it down

353
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:56,300
on the body and effectively cuts them in half, which is really gross. Right. But it's not

354
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:00,820
like the way it's depicted in game. It just, it looks like a, like a mortal combat three

355
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:06,500
blood splatter. It isn't like, it isn't delightful. It isn't gross. Like it is in like mortal

356
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,900
combat 10 or 11. I hope that pyramid head moves a little bit faster than he does in

357
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:15,420
the game. So, um, he moves at the same speed as the other, you know, again, they had, they

358
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:20,260
have to balance it a little bit, but that's how they get like Michael Myers, leather face,

359
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:25,660
Freddy Krueger, um, the pig from the saw movies. Um, who am I missing? Ghost face. They're

360
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:31,400
all in this game. Play around as Freddy and let me know what it's like. I Freddy's interesting

361
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:36,500
as far, but I don't want to buy them. They all cost money. The only one I bought, I need

362
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:42,300
like five bucks. I'll buy them for you. Oh, that's sweet. Thank you. Okay. Then I'll text

363
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,380
you five bucks. You'd probably get a better bang for your buck. If you get, if you had

364
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:53,380
Alan by Freddy, I can't Apple pay Alan. Okay. Five bucks for Freddy. Sweet. Dark soccer

365
00:31:53,380 --> 00:32:00,380
just tapped into my dead by daylight edition. I love it. Addiction. I love it. Um, I'm seriously,

366
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:06,500
I'm going to give you five bucks right now. Okay. Yeah. Then I will buy Freddy and I'll,

367
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:11,580
I think he's a very hard killer to play though, but I'll try it. I'll try anything. Whatever.

368
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:17,860
Uh, for five bucks. I'll try it. So yeah, I have been playing more dead by daylight.

369
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:22,340
That's that's fine. I will do a stream at some point. It's just that Alan now wears

370
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,460
the streaming pants in this house outside of Sunday night. So there's no room for me

371
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:32,020
anymore. No, he's much more disciplined with it than I am. That's for sure. Um, let's see.

372
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:37,420
Oh, I also want to talk about, cause I've been playing more bravely default to my relationship

373
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:42,700
with this game is so interesting because there are things about this game that annoy the

374
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:48,060
fucking shit out of me. I am like, I don't know if I've ever been more annoyed by a game

375
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:53,260
in recent years than I have been with bravely default too, because I talked about this last

376
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:59,220
week on the show, the, the frame rate and the performance issues, they, they bug me.

377
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:05,820
Um, I'm finding that I am getting bugged now by, if you try to like auto equip characters,

378
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:11,700
the auto equip thing is not very smart because it will start equipping armor to your healers

379
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:16,080
that are good armor, but it will also draw the most amount of hate. So why did they put

380
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,120
that into some mechanic that armor draws hate? I don't know, but that's the thing. Uh, speaking

381
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,200
of mechanics that annoy the shit out of me, the weight mechanic, they haven't bravely

382
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,200
default to fucking annoys me. So there's a, there's a, and I was talking on discord with

383
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,100
some of my friends about this the other night. I'm like, this game annoys me so much with

384
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:41,220
all these little things that all being said, I can't stop playing it because at its core,

385
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:46,280
that very final fantasy five esque build up your characters in the different types

386
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:51,820
of jobs and the jobs that are offered in the game and the battle system that's there is

387
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:57,640
actually a very satisfying system. The battle system is, and the whole like defaulting and,

388
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,460
and braving to spend extra points and the whole like doing four turns at a time, if

389
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:08,700
you're willing to sit out for three turns and that whole stuff. Um, like that, that

390
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,340
is all very interesting to me and that's kind of what's keeping me with the game despite

391
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:17,140
the fact that I'm very annoyed by some of these other things. I'm going to be honest.

392
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:22,920
Um, when I saw that Octopath Traveler is coming to Xbox game pass, I was actually very excited

393
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:27,220
because I was like, I hope that means bravely default will come to those systems too because

394
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:30,660
that means the performance issue thing will no longer be an issue. Maybe we'll get the

395
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:35,020
switch pro too and that'll work out too. Uh, I'll still be annoyed by the weight and the

396
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:39,780
auto equip thing where I have to do everything by hand and when you're switching jobs a lot,

397
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:46,700
that's very annoying, but eh, I guess I'll take it. It's Hey, nothing can be worse than

398
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:53,300
the drawing junctioning system from Final Fantasy eight. So there is that. That's terrible.

399
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:58,260
Exactly. I think it puts a lot of stuff in perspective. It's like, Hey, nothing can ever

400
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:05,780
be that bad. Wow. I just got five bucks on Apple pay. How about that? I put the text

401
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:15,540
message up on the cam. I love it. All right. Anyway, that's enough for my gaming week.

402
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:20,340
I don't think I have a lot of extra to add. All right, let's get into some gaming news

403
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,140
actually real quick before we get into gaming news on a serious note because I need to make

404
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:30,340
sure we say this at some point in tonight's show. Um, obviously there's been, uh, there's

405
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:35,640
been a lot of bullshit in the world in the past year and, uh, we, um, have seen a lot

406
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,660
of bullshit in this past week. And yes, I'm referring to what happened, um, in Atlanta

407
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:44,000
with those, um, horrific shootings, um, done, you know, the terrorist act that was done

408
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
in Atlanta. Let's just call it what it is. Let's not call it what that Sheriff had the

409
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,760
audacity to call it on, on TV. That was somebody's bad day. It was a terrorist attack. Um, shit

410
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,480
is what it was racism. And it was very, it was very hurtful too, that it happened in

411
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,840
a place like Atlanta, which I, you know, it's my Atlanta is my home for one week out of

412
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,680
the year, um, outside of pandemics, you know, and obviously Bobby and dragon con have had

413
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,060
a huge influence in that whole thing. So certainly I, I, I felt a certain kind of connection

414
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:19,720
when I heard about this horrible thing, um, that happened in Atlanta that, um, you know,

415
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,960
could have, could have happened anywhere, unfortunately. And that's the disgusting thing.

416
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,400
And that's why we all need to, you know, take a promise that we're going to do what we can,

417
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:36,360
um, to stop Asian American and Pacific Islander hate, um, and, uh, stop that culture and stop

418
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:42,640
that racism, um, that's happening in our culture. And you can say that, and also at the same

419
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,860
time, still recognize black lives matter and the black lives matter movement and all the

420
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:53,340
bullshit that the black and African American and, and, uh, people of color community that

421
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:58,660
they face all of the time. Um, and I was talking a little bit about this on Twitter this week.

422
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:02,320
And I think a lot of this, and this does tie into video gaming. So if you're about to tune

423
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,740
out of the show, cause, Oh God, Rob's on another one of his rants. I really need you to listen

424
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:11,840
to this because when we talk about like stopping the hate and all this and stopping it when

425
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:17,680
it comes to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and stopping it when it comes to other casual

426
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:24,520
racism that happens, I think we all know gaming and that culture is all too often a

427
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:31,560
hotbed for that sort of casual racism, casual misogyny, casual homophobia, and transphobia.

428
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:37,600
If we want to talk about the LGBTQ and so forth community. Um, I'm, I know when I'm

429
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,560
talking to the OLR audience, I'm talking to folks that are here, you know, that join us

430
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,840
on VOG network every week. I'm, I'm pretty much preaching to the choir. I don't think

431
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:51,080
there's people around here that really actively participate in this, but what can you do if

432
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:56,480
you want to be an ally and you want to be an ally for things like stop AAPI hate and,

433
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,360
and BLM, what can you do if you want to be an ally? You've got to, you are in a unique

434
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:06,840
position. I'm in a unique position where we can call this out when we see it. And that's

435
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:12,400
what we have to do because think about it. Have you heard a racist joke in your life?

436
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:22,480
I know I have. Did you, did you maybe let that racist joke go by without doing anything

437
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,960
to stop it because you didn't want to create an awkward situation between you and your

438
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:33,040
friend. That is maybe the attitude we as allies have to change because a hashtag is not going

439
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:39,200
to do it. A picture of a square on your Instagram account is not going to do it. Calling that

440
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,840
out when it happens, that's going to do it. And that's going to be the shift in our culture.

441
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:49,520
And I can tell you from all of the Black people that I've talked to, all of the Asian American

442
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:55,240
people that I've talked to, they don't want to be doing this educating. They are tired

443
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:00,760
of always having to be the ones to do the educating, you know, and you see this happen

444
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,280
on Twitter, right? Somebody Black or somebody Asian American tweets a certain way that they're

445
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,320
feeling. And always the first and second reply is something like, well, you should

446
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,400
do this or explain to me why, you know, why don't we have white pride? Why don't you tell

447
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:24,520
me why we don't have that? Or, you know, whatever. You have Google use it. Exactly. Like, stop

448
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:32,040
making oppressed people explain it to you. Open your eyes because it's there. And if

449
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:37,200
you want to be a better ally, you've got to be the one. I think I made this comparison

450
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,860
on Twitter as I was like, this whole like locker room joke culture and this whole thing.

451
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:49,140
This is oftentimes when those locker room jokes are happening, the oppressed community

452
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:53,760
is not there in the locker room because most people don't have the balls to say that kind

453
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,920
of things to someone someone's face. When we had the President of the United States

454
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,480
getting up there calling coronavirus some really shitty things. Unfortunately, that

455
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:08,560
was an exception where that guy didn't give a fuck and he would say, you know, whatever,

456
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:14,760
which is a whole other issue. But for the most part, when these other aggressions happen,

457
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:20,520
the oppressed is not in the room. That's why we have to be the ones to speak up and say

458
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:27,480
something. So and I think that we we have this unique position where we know firsthand

459
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:36,720
what it's like to be the one talked about, you know, or deal with with having our own

460
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:43,660
issues have been sources of public mockery, you know, like, do you know how many times

461
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:50,240
I want to scream every time I see someone type autistic screaming? It's and the thing

462
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,220
is, is that we don't stop and think about, oh, well, it's not affecting us. We have our

463
00:40:55,220 --> 00:41:00,060
own issues to deal with. But the moment that we stop and we call out others, we can also

464
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:05,460
expect to have them called out on our behalf, too. And everyone should be doing it.

465
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:11,880
So next time you're playing a game online with friends, and somebody casually drops

466
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,460
the N word, heaven forbid, I mean, I hope that isn't happening with your friends. But

467
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:20,720
I'm also realistic. And I know there is people in the world that feel like they can just

468
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,560
say that wherever they want. Or somebody decides to do their own voice of an Asian

469
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:32,040
character in the game that is extremely stereotypical and in poor taste. You have a responsibility

470
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:36,740
as an ally to call that out. Is it going to be awkward with your friend? Yes. But that's

471
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:40,640
the only way this shit is going to change is when we call out this behavior when we

472
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,400
see it. And we have to stop the hate. We have to stop the hate with Asian American Pacific

473
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,400
Islanders. We have to stop casual racism. We have to stop misogyny. We have to stop

474
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:58,960
homophobia, transphobia, all of it. All of it. All of it. And gaming culture, unfortunately,

475
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:05,300
as we know, is a hotbed for it. So what are you going to do to make it a better place?

476
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:09,720
Because putting a hashtag on social media, that's cute. But that's not going to change

477
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:17,440
anything. Educating somebody on why they should stop doing what they're doing and how

478
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:24,080
that can be hurtful. That's going to be the start of it. Just some food for thought. All

479
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:30,160
right. I got on my soapbox, but it needed to happen. So there you go. All right. Let's

480
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,560
move on. Let's get into some gaming news and talk about what else is going on in the gaming

481
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,520
world. Besides what we talked about at the beginning of the show with Evo. So Loki, why

482
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,640
don't you start us off with our first topic tonight?

483
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,960
Yeah. So there was a presentation, which I actually missed because I didn't even know

484
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:52,840
it was happening. But Square Enix did a kind of a Nintendo Direct type event called Square

485
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:59,640
Enix Presents. And they showed off a bunch of different things, new game trailers and

486
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:04,840
different announcements. So for example, one of those being the announcement of the brand

487
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:11,240
new entry into the Life is Strange series, which looked interesting. So that's Life is

488
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:20,160
Strange True Colors. That's going to be coming out later this year on, I think most platforms

489
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:26,480
maybe. Yeah. Looks like on all the other platforms that normally came on. They did show off,

490
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,800
which is, I don't even remember the original trailer for this. It was Project Atheia, which

491
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,320
is now being called Force Spoken. But it's this brand new exclusive game that's coming

492
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:44,240
out for PlayStation 5 and PC, which looks amazing. So brand new IP for them. So very

493
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,320
interested in that.

494
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:50,840
I have to say that is probably the biggest thing I'm excited for on PlayStation 5 right

495
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:55,680
now. I got to say, like even above like the Horizon sequel and some of the other stuff

496
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,920
that Sony shown, that is probably the thing I'm most excited about right now. And that

497
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,800
trailer was really badass, like how they had the actress kind of introducing it. And

498
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:10,280
then you see her in the game and it's like, it's her. It's her. It's like, no, it's digital

499
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,440
her, but it's her, you know? And then of course the whole like, is that a fucking dragon?

500
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,680
Like that's the one line of dialogue and the whole thing. But it was a very sharp looking

501
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,320
trailer, I got to say.

502
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:24,100
So yeah, so they showed that off. They had a new trailer for Balan Wonderland, which

503
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:29,100
I think is coming out later this month. They announced that Black Panther is going to be

504
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:37,040
coming to Marvel Avengers. They showed off this Hitman Sniper Assassins, which is a mobile

505
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:45,460
game. Also Just Cause mobile, which I'm a huge Just Cause fan, but nope. I think that

506
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:52,120
was, it was certainly more a game trailer than gameplay. They're talking about the 25th

507
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:58,320
anniversary of Tomb Raider. And to celebrate that that's coming to Fortnite. So that's

508
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:05,920
interesting. Outriders, they showed a little bit more for that as well. And then some other

509
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:12,400
smaller things that they mentioned. Space Invaders is getting an AR game. So add that to

510
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:18,580
the list of AR games you got to try. Darius is coming to Switch and PlayStation 4 is an

511
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:25,720
HD remaster called Darius Cosmic Revelation. Bubble Bobble, four friends coming to Steam

512
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:34,260
and the second story pack for Toho Spell Bubble is coming through the Switch as well. Yeah,

513
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:40,120
pretty cool. Again, very interested about the four spoken, although that, God, like

514
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:44,300
I have a feeling that's a 2022 game. Yeah, it is a 2022 game.

515
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,300
Yeah, I think they said it is. Yeah.

516
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:52,660
Yeah. Oh, well it gives me time. But that, that one looked really good. And yeah, there

517
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:57,060
was a lot of, it was interesting because we got a lot more updates than I was expecting.

518
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:01,940
I think that, you know, the whole four spoken showing up was certainly unexpected. We went

519
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:05,700
in knowing it was going to be about Life is Strange. And certainly it's, you know, nice

520
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:10,300
that that series is continuing to go on and they're kind of bringing the older ones back

521
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:14,780
for the newer platforms. That's cool remasters for those as well. So that, that'd be interesting.

522
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:19,300
Honestly, that's what I kind of would have expected this event to be and kind of end

523
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:23,160
there, you know? Um, but they, they really went on and detailed more titles than I kind

524
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,040
of thought they would. So that was pretty cool. I mean, some people might be going,

525
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,980
where was Final Fantasy? But I think you set the bar way too high if you were going into

526
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:36,820
a Life is Strange event expecting Final Fantasy a couple of weeks ago. So like that, why bring

527
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:42,340
Final Fantasy back again? Right. I know, but you know, you know, people are like, where's,

528
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:47,260
chapter 16? Let's show me another screenshot. Give me another hit on what's going on there.

529
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:52,220
So Questbuster in chat is saying I really enjoyed the Outriders demo. Yeah, that has

530
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:57,980
my attention too. I can't believe that's coming to Game Pass. That's so exciting. The Outriders

531
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:02,500
demo was also notoriously farmed for the legendaries it drops because any progress you make in

532
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:07,900
it is carried over to the full game. That again from Questbuster in our chat, who also

533
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:11,980
mentioned that four spoken is by Luminous Productions, which is made up of the staff

534
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:17,380
that created Final Fantasy 15. Well, good. This will probably be a title that really

535
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:22,820
suits that. You know, I didn't love Final Fantasy 15 as a Final Fantasy title, but there

536
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:27,840
was some interesting stuff in there. I think also I didn't like that it was really kind

537
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:32,580
of rushed. Yes, I know that game was in development for 10 years, but let's be real, only the

538
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:39,380
last two years mattered. So there is that, but I'm excited to see what they do with kind

539
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:43,140
of like their own thing. I think that could be very, very interesting. That's for sure.

540
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:49,020
Bobby Black Wolf, I'm assuming a tongue in cheek, firmly planted saying I'm just disappointed

541
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:55,060
that Square Enix didn't show me a new Breath of the Wild 2 trailer. Yes, I know. I'm always

542
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:59,120
disappointed when that doesn't show up in an event too. DJ Roma S saying still waiting

543
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:05,260
on that Rad Racer 3 trailer. Wouldn't that be a hoot? That would be pretty awesome to

544
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:10,060
bring that back. Oh my God. Can you imagine if one day out of the blue Square brought

545
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:16,280
back Rad Racer? Why haven't they? Can we explore that for a minute? Can we look under

546
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:22,060
that rock? Why hasn't Square Enix? I mean, because Square is much more than just Final

547
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:28,900
Fantasy. Square now owns studios that develop things like Tomb Raider, the Avengers game,

548
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:33,140
you know, Forspoke, you know, they have a lot of different studios. Why haven't they

549
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:37,420
tasked one of them with doing a new Rad Racer? Do they think there's too many racing games

550
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:42,540
out there or something? It would be like, honestly, it would fit really well with like

551
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:48,020
an arcade racer, like kind of like a Ridge Racer or something like that. But I don't

552
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:55,540
know if Rad Racer know where it would fit like within the different racing. But honestly,

553
00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:02,980
the racing games out there tend to heavily stick to the simulation racing. There's a

554
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:08,200
lot more simulation racing used versus arcade. The only two I can only think of a couple

555
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:14,020
arcade racing titles out there that have been pretty big recently, that hotshots racing

556
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:21,160
and of course, you know, you've got the Forza Horizon series as well. But you know, we haven't

557
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:26,100
had a new Burnout game, I guess Need for Speed also is kind of on the arcade racing side

558
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:33,940
as well. But I don't know, like if Need for Speed is just very...

559
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:34,940
Rad Racer could fight...

560
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:39,820
It's just too complicated. It's like give me a good racing, arcade racing game.

561
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:43,760
All here's the thing, Rad Racer could find a niche in the space because when it comes

562
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:49,700
to racing games, the games that have dared to step up and kind of go try to like break

563
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:56,220
into that space have oftentimes been criminally underrated. Case in point, Blur. That game

564
00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:02,840
was fucking rad and it really got, you know, kind of shafted all things considered. The

565
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:06,700
gaming's, you know, history. Like if they had gone so far as to make a Blur sequel,

566
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:12,780
I think it would have been amazing. Case in point, again, split second. When Disney did

567
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:18,020
their whole thing on the Xbox 360, that game was pretty sweet too. Unfortunately, it didn't

568
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:21,780
make enough money and it never continued past that point either.

569
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:22,780
So I mean...

570
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:27,020
That was a pretty fun game though. I don't know why they tried, but didn't they have

571
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:31,900
like, um, God, I can't remember which one, if it was split second or Blur that had, it

572
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:37,900
had, oh, no, it was split second too. That's right. Um, cause that game looked amazing.

573
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:41,180
The screenshots or video of that.

574
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:46,260
Honestly, I really wanted a sequel to that. It's been what, like 10 years since Blur?

575
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:51,120
It's been a long time. I think Rad Racer could fill that space of Mario Kart meets

576
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:57,940
Arcade Racer that I think we want. Do we want that? I want that. So Square, if you're out

577
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:06,820
there, Rad Racer, make it happen. All right. All right. Let's move on. Hey, Rad Racer could

578
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:12,980
be a VR thing. Who knows? You know, the original Rad Racer was 3D with the 3D glasses, right?

579
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:19,500
Does anyone ever play Rad Racer in 3D? I did. It was, it was, um, it's, it's, it's gimmicky.

580
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,940
Like all you, it's, it, because the graphics are so basic, especially when you're playing

581
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:28,780
in 3D, like all you're really seeing is added depth. That's all you're really seeing. Um,

582
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:35,420
but it's, you know, obviously like 3DS technology and so forth really puts it to shame. Bobby

583
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:40,580
Black Wolf says, I did try it with my power glove. It's so bad. SHO 100 Matt says, has

584
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:45,600
to come with the red and blue 3D glasses. That was special. Look in the Rad Racer reboot,

585
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:51,260
the main character could sport those red and blue glasses. Look at it here. I'm designing

586
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:57,540
the game, you guys. All right. Anyway, moving on. Let's talk about VR for the PlayStation

587
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:02,440
five, because we have more news about VR coming to the PlayStation five. No, we don't have

588
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:07,120
a date. No, we don't have a price, but we do know what the controllers are going to

589
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:12,820
look like. Uh, there was an update, uh, from Sony's PlayStation blog this week, uh, that

590
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:17,840
shows what the controllers are going to look like for the PlayStation VR for PlayStation

591
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:24,360
five. Gone are the, uh, PlayStation move controllers and the little colored balls on the tips of

592
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:29,600
them. Uh, they are gone and these new controllers really look nothing like them. Um, they look

593
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:35,720
more like, I think there is a VR out there that uses Oculus two Oculus quest two or something.

594
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:40,920
They, they use these controllers and they, they look like, um, imagine like the outline

595
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,000
and I'm trying to describe this for the folks listening on the podcast. Imagine like the

596
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:52,120
outline of a boxing glove, kind of like on your hand that, and you grip like half a controller

597
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:59,640
that's on the inside. That's kind of what these look like. Um, so it does kind of, it

598
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,880
looks a little bit like a, yeah, I think it is Oculus that, uh, uses that there. Uh, or

599
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,860
as some people have noticed, uh, it looks a little bit like the orb that Jodie Foster

600
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:13,480
uses in contact. I would have never found that out, but who knows? Anyway, some of the

601
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:19,440
features, some of the features in here, adaptive triggers. So that means that when you press

602
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,400
it, it'll be, you know, adapt. It's kind of like the harder you press it, the harder it

603
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,620
goes and so forth. Um, that is very similar to what's already in the dual sense controller.

604
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:31,960
There will be haptic feedback, no real surprise there. Again, another kind of perk of the,

605
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:37,680
uh, existing dual sense controller, finger touch detection. So even if you don't like

606
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:43,540
press in areas where you like, there is a button, it will actually see like gestures

607
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:48,040
that your fingers and stuff are doing. And basically, yeah, it sounds just like a rift

608
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:55,520
controller with the dual sense triggers and the dual sense, uh, hap, it's not really haptic

609
00:53:55,520 --> 00:54:00,160
gremble, whatever they've got there. It's basically those two combined together. Basically.

610
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:05,400
Yes. All right. It just says the point cause like I had envisioned when they were talking

611
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:10,400
about haptics and stuff like actual gloves or something like that, but it's fine. I mean

612
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,760
those could work for like PC and stuff. Bobby is saying in chat, I'm getting it backwards.

613
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,560
So the adaptive triggers, it's actually the other way around. So they don't want you to

614
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:24,580
push the triggers down all the way sometimes. Uh, and so it's more like resistance on the

615
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:30,980
triggers as opposed to, um, what I was saying. So thank you, Bobby. Um, yeah. I mean, if

616
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:35,780
I could actually find a PlayStation five and I've decided I'm not buying a PlayStation

617
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:39,420
five until I can just walk into target and get one. And I realized I might be waiting

618
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:46,140
a while, but I, I'm not having it with 2022 for when this comes out and probably the other,

619
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:50,920
you know, uh, square index game, honestly. Yes, there's time. And so there's that. So

620
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:56,760
yeah, like I, I, I can't explain to you what a PlayStation five is like because they're

621
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,840
pretty hard to get and uh, I'm not willing to fight a lot of that. Go onto Walmart and

622
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:08,520
get the 3pm drop that's going to be gone in five seconds. And I'm just, I'm, I don't know

623
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,560
if it's this my age, I'm just not willing to subject myself to that stress. And I've,

624
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:16,860
I've said this with other products before, when I can walk into the store, pick one up

625
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:22,000
off the shelf, then it will be meant to be, but I'm not, I'm too old and too tired to

626
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,300
fight for a gaming console. I just am. So I'll get one when I can walk into a fries

627
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:37,080
and pick it up. You might have to time travel. You might have to check the dumpster out back.

628
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:41,820
I'm sure that'll be a thing. Yes, I can. I can do that. Uh, Bobby black woven chat says,

629
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:47,020
well episode Eufy is PlayStation five only in June. Then you know what? She's going to

630
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:53,820
have to wait. She's going to have to wait. Sorry. All right. Uh, also very important.

631
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:59,280
One other feature of the new VR, the tracking, the VR controller is tracked by, uh, by the

632
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:04,100
headset through a tracking ring across the bottom of the controller. So that's also very

633
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:08,500
interesting because that means it's not going to be the whole like camera looking at you

634
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:13,540
type of thing. It's actually in the VR headsets. That's kind of neat. I like that. So, uh,

635
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:19,260
cool. Of course, again, we don't know when we don't know how much we don't know what

636
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:23,360
the headset looks like. We're just getting, we don't know games. It's all we know. Sony

637
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:29,900
is working on it. Just, just announced a brand new, uh, until Dawn, uh, Russia blood game.

638
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:33,540
And I'm there just, that's all you need to do is say, Hey, we're putting them one of

639
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:38,820
those out and like, Oh, all right. I'm sure, I'm sure there'll be some good games for it.

640
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:43,180
I'm uh, I'm excited. I'm still thinking back to last week when we had that whole fan wank

641
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:47,380
about Sony buying Konami so that they can start putting Bemani games out again. And

642
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:52,000
now we had that story last week about the first Bemani VR game. Hey, there's a game

643
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,060
for PlayStation five. All right. I'm stretching a little bit, but, um, yeah, it'll be a little

644
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:02,600
bit, a lot. Okay. A lot of it. Um, but I'm sure that, you know, again, it's about getting

645
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:08,240
that must have app. So whether that is the Russia blood until Dawn for PlayStation five,

646
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,280
or maybe a new type of Beat Saber or one of those types of games or something we haven't

647
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,080
thought of yet, most likely. Um, I think that is really going to be the thing that pushes

648
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:22,840
VR forward, but PlayStation certainly did a great job of making quality VR accessible.

649
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:28,360
I'm using that word quality and some folks may feel differently about this, but I think

650
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:33,040
those like, um, that thing that you plop your cell phone into and it does VR through

651
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:40,760
that. I think PlayStation brought quality VR and VR experiences and made them very accessible.

652
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:48,880
So there's that. All right, let's move on dark Sakura. So, um, one thing I've been keeping

653
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,680
my eyes on is the stuff for the new resident evil stuff. And it could, there is a lot of

654
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:59,560
stuff. Oh yeah. So basically, um, the new movie has a title. Now it's resident evil,

655
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:04,200
welcome to raccoon city, and it's going to follow the first two games. So we'll have

656
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:12,800
Chris, Joe, Leon and Claire. Um, they've already done quite a bit of casting for it. Um, and

657
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:19,800
then, uh, there's going to definitely be some very interesting things as though that the,

658
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,400
the, the film franchise and this movie series have nothing to do with each other. They're

659
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:32,600
completely separate. It's not a remake. It's going to be a little bit more with the base

660
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:39,520
universe. Um, so there you go. Um, I'm actually kind of relieved for that because the one

661
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,920
thing I didn't really care for in the movie universes is that they didn't quite follow

662
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:49,560
the game universe. And I would rather dig more into the game universe. So I think that's

663
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:58,240
going to be, be awesome. So they got a good cast so far. Yeah. Um, and that's, uh, that

664
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:03,320
whole, uh, revival of stuff on Netflix. It's just like Netflix trying to become the video

665
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:09,280
game home of all this stuff. So yeah, it's going to be, yeah, they sure do. Uh, looking

666
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,660
in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, dark Tetsuya says, as long as it's better

667
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:17,600
than the original movie released, it's interesting though. Cause the original resident evil movie

668
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:22,560
certainly has its fans. Um, and it, yeah, I would say the original is probably better

669
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:27,640
than any of the sequels. Any of the many, how many seals they made me like 20 sequels

670
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:31,480
or something like that. I don't know. I think finally knew what I liked is I liked some

671
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:36,760
of the CG ones that they came out with. So like the, um, degeneration and the only reason

672
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:42,960
I bought degeneration is because it had, uh, a song on there. Gosh, why can't I remember

673
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:48,280
her name now? Cause I really like her and it's Chia. Um, she did like the closing song

674
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:52,440
on it and that's why I bought the movie, but the movie was actually really good. Yeah.

675
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:56,960
Um, and, uh, as she 100, Matt says, I haven't seen the cast yet. Are there any like highly

676
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:03,320
recognizable folks in the cast or is it a lot of, um, Robbie ML? Um, I'm trying to think

677
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:10,680
of other ones I've seen. Um, not too many people I know of. I mean, it's just, I've,

678
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:17,240
you know, I checked some of these people on IMDB, um, and they looked like they had,

679
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:21,160
you know, done some good work, but the only name I really recognized was Robbie ML who's

680
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:26,760
playing Chris. Uh, fifth dream is giving a shout out to Anna. Sushiya is amazing. So

681
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:32,960
yeah. Oh, sorry. Yeah. She's, there's a movie that she did. It's one of my favorite movies

682
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:43,840
ever called, um, uh, uh, where, um, she becomes a, uh, a courtesan, uh, an Iran or she's trying

683
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:49,880
to become the later on. It's really, really good movie. She's got a great voice. All right.

684
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:55,120
So, uh, we'll, we'll see that soon whenever this movie finally comes out. All right, let's

685
01:00:55,120 --> 01:01:01,360
move on to our next story. Loki. It's like, we've heard this story before. So Activision

686
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:08,080
is laying off some employees. So, uh, they're going to be laying off the Blizzard esports,

687
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:14,000
uh, which is going to be about 50 employees. Actually, it says the total figure is around

688
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:22,000
190 instead. Um, this is also coming after that they've just, uh, closed the European

689
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:29,360
publishing offices as well, uh, which laid off, you know, quite a few people, um, on top of that.

690
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:36,720
Um, and of course, you know, much like we saw last time, uh, during our investor call,

691
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:43,680
I think it was about a year or so ago from November, um, Bobby Kotick, Activision Blizzard

692
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:50,160
CEO is going to get even bigger bonuses because of that. Um, he's supposed to get more than,

693
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:57,440
I guess, a total payout, nearly $200 million. It's fucking terrible. So, you know, $200 million,

694
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:02,640
which I'm sure probably could have paid for a lot of those employees to work there. Um,

695
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,240
but you know, he needs more money even though he's a multi-billionaire.

696
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:15,360
It's that is a problem with this. Yeah. It's, um, it's extraordinarily frustrating to, you know,

697
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:21,520
to hear of that bonus that he's making, um, and how, I guess a lot of this staff was, uh, as I,

698
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:26,400
as I understand it in the, in the live events creation stuff. Am I right? Are we talking

699
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:31,200
about things like BlizzCon and things like that? Yeah. And that's, I don't quite understand. It

700
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:36,880
seems very shortsighted to me because even though that space is, you know, having a hard time right

701
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:41,760
now in the past year with everything going on, um, everybody really desires it to come back.

702
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,720
And once the convention space to come back and we see other companies that are certainly valuing

703
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:51,600
that convention space, like Sony, um, is certainly trying to get back into that space too. So to see

704
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:58,960
Activision kind of let that go is shocking or I should say, cut it back. I shouldn't say,

705
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,680
let it go. Cause I don't see that like, there's not going to be a BlizzCon again, hardly,

706
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:08,240
but it's just, I would have thought Blizzard would instead try to grow that, or sorry, I keep saying

707
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:13,680
Blizzard by me, Activision, Activision would try to grow that space and not try to, um, scale that

708
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:18,880
back. So that's just, it's shocking to me. I do have that with like everything they'll just leave

709
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:25,440
people off and then hire back later. Um, but I mean, a lot of these developers, like, especially

710
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:31,040
like we had, I think the last set of layoffs was around, you know, like teams working on like the

711
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,960
latest Call of Duty and stuff like that. They just lay people off and like, they'll hire back

712
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:40,480
people or hire different people back for less money or something. Um, but yeah, it does suck

713
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:46,640
that, you know, they're laying off all these people. Um, and their CEO who I don't know how

714
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:51,680
he contributes to the company is continuing to make millions and millions of dollars.

715
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:57,600
The system is built to help the rich. Uh, reading some comments in chat,

716
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:04,080
Black Compat says money gonna money, heavy sigh. Yeah. Heavy, heavy sigh. Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says

717
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:09,040
he's not welcome in the club of Bobby. Um, Tiger Claw says, here's the thing. We heard these kinds

718
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:13,760
of stories before CEO's getting bonuses while employees were being laid off. Look. And here's

719
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:20,880
the other thing is that like, if, okay, if truly because of the pandemic, there's just no work

720
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:27,200
right now in the live event space, and this is a decision that has to be made then, okay, but,

721
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:36,560
but underlined bolded, but give them the severance that they deserve. Help them get certifications

722
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:42,560
so that they can stay current, help them in job seeking and finding other stuff in the industry.

723
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:47,040
Because the part of this story that's most insulting is what SJ 100 Matt just reminded

724
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:53,440
me of there in chat. To me that $200 battle net gift card was a massive slap in the face.

725
01:04:53,440 --> 01:05:02,720
Um, yeah, that is the part where Bobby Kotak like needs to fucking go. Even if he didn't make that

726
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:07,920
call himself, which I doubt he did. At the end of the day, he's still ultimately responsible for it

727
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:11,760
to give these employees that had given so much of their time and effort into this. And again,

728
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:17,920
I want to stress this enough, because I know people that work at Blizzard. I believe I know

729
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:23,440
people that work to Activision as well or worked at least I know as well and the staff and the

730
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:29,040
people working in the front lines are all wonderful, fam fabulous people that work very hard and love

731
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:34,320
video games. The grievances I am airing have nothing to do with them. And I certainly would

732
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:39,040
never attack them on social media. And if I see you attacking them, I'm going to come at you with

733
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:44,640
my claws out because these people don't deserve it. Who deserves it? The senior management and

734
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:53,040
Bobby Kotak. That my grievances are for that right now. And that $200 battle net gift card

735
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:58,960
or whatever the hell it was terrible. That's that is the thing where I'm like that. Like if

736
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:05,280
we are to put down the list of reasons why Bobby Kotak needs to be ceremoniously thrown out of

737
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,880
office or whatever you want his office, whatever you want to call it. And I mean,

738
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:15,840
I want people to walk in there, grab him by the shoulders like you see in an old movie and throw

739
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:20,480
him out the front door. I don't care if he lands on pillows to be humane, whatever. There's a

740
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:29,360
better word. What? Finestrated. I'm trying to do a show. That is when people are thrown out of the

741
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:38,560
window. Yes, that. Okay. And it was a big thing too like going on in Europe. A big accident. We

742
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:42,880
need to bring back fenestration. So, here's it. So, I do not violate tWitch's terms of service

743
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:48,000
right there. He can land on a nice soft one of those fluffy mats that gymnasts use, okay?

744
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:55,840
But I still want the ceremonious throwing to happen. And that is the reason the $200

745
01:06:55,840 --> 01:07:02,240
gift cards. You know what? If you really felt bad, how about six months of insurance covered?

746
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:07,120
How about certifications to keep them current in their industry while they job hunt? How about

747
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,800
signing them up for, you know, headhunter services and things like that to help them find them?

748
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:15,040
Three months severance. So, three months severance and the gift card.

749
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:21,040
The word is defenestration. Sorry. Oh, okay. Anyway. Yeah. And Questbuster,

750
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:25,920
great point. Questbuster in chat says, meanwhile, years ago, Iwata and Nintendo's board of

751
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:32,080
directors took a massive pay cut over poor financial results. And that is why we miss

752
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:40,080
Iwata in this industry every single day. It also though has to do a little bit more,

753
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:45,360
I think, with the nature of work ethic in groups in America versus Japan.

754
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:53,920
Mm-hmm. That a manager is gonna say the failing of the company is the failing of the manager,

755
01:07:53,920 --> 01:08:00,480
and the employees should be protected. Whereas- And in America, the CEOs are like,

756
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:05,920
I can't hear you. I'm in the money pit. Yeah. Anyway.

757
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:10,000
The employees are nothing but a stepping stone for more money in their pocket.

758
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,640
That's the danger of capitalism. All right. Let's move on. Let's move

759
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:22,000
on to another story. Let's talk about Microsoft. As far as the Xbox gaming division goes and that

760
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,640
whole stuff, has a pretty decent guy at the helm right now, I'd say. So, Phil Spencer hasn't pissed

761
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:32,800
me off this week. He's usually one of the more impressive folks in the industry. So, a pat on

762
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:37,920
the back and a cookie for Phil Spencer. Literal pillows for Phil Spencer. A nice new pillow for

763
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:44,000
his couch. Okay? Phil Spencer can have that. Microsoft, Xbox getting a new feature this

764
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:50,480
week, a suspend feature to help with the download speeds. Because download speeds on console aren't

765
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:57,120
always great, but what this new feature will do is that you can suspend a game while you're trying

766
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:03,920
to download a new one to help the system download faster. So, suspend in the queue will let you

767
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:09,600
download at full speed while making sure your game remains resumable or quick resumable even

768
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:15,680
if you're on the series X or S. And this was all on a Twitter post by engineering lead Eden Marie

769
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:21,280
over at Xbox. And there's a screenshot of that new suspend functionality if you want to look at that

770
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:28,640
over on Twitter on her account, Neon Epiphany. And then right now, downloads I guess are pretty slow

771
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:33,760
when the games are open because some of the connection capacity has to be for the game,

772
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:37,680
which kind of makes sense. Like I get that because a lot of games have some type of like

773
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:41,920
online talking functionality there. So, you can't dedicate it to downloading the game.

774
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,240
But if you suspend it, then you're basically saying, okay, pause this game, put it on hold

775
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:51,600
and give more of the priority over to downloading the game there. So, I think that's kind of neat,

776
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:57,520
especially since Xbox Game Pass oftentimes is like the hometown buffet of gaming.

777
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:02,000
And it's like, I'm going to load me up a little bit with that. Oh, Doom 64. Yeah, put some of

778
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,640
that on my plate. Oh, oh, we got Outriders coming. Yep. Save room for that at the end.

779
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:12,000
And now people are downloading games to sample them and everything. I think this is a very

780
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,880
welcome sort of thing. If you have the bandwidth for it is a very welcome sort of thing. And I know

781
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:21,520
I keep saying that if you have the bandwidth for it, but I'm really trying to look forward

782
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:30,080
three or four years when 5G becomes more and more of a thing. I can't wait for the day.

783
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:36,160
I can bypass my cable connection and hook up my Xbox to 5G and download things that way. Now,

784
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:41,120
of course, 5G might have data limitations, but at least it's going to introduce competition into

785
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:45,440
that space where these whole bandwidth caps and this whole thing is going to get needled a little

786
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:51,200
bit. Let's hope. Let's hope the industry doesn't try to kind of artificially cap that, but we'll

787
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:58,960
see. All right, let's move on and let's get to Dark Sakura. Oh, some exciting news in your world

788
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:06,720
for sure, right? Yeah. How about something happy? Yes, please. So, there was a new update to Animal

789
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:12,160
Crossing that came out on the 18th and you know, I was on that shit the moment it happened. So,

790
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:19,600
basically the March 18th update came with lots of new stuff. Can I just say you're tweeting,

791
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:24,560
you're tweeting the equivalent of are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?

792
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:34,800
Pretty much. Pretty much. Sorry. But the cool thing is that number one is that if you have

793
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:47,360
the Sanrio cards that were part of Animal Crossing, what was it for New Leaf?

794
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:55,440
Welcome amiibo. There were some Sanrio cards that came out with six characters.

795
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:03,200
And if you have those cards, you can actually now invite them into your village and just for

796
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:10,400
scanning them, it unlocks permanent items that you can buy, including furniture sets and clothes

797
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:15,600
and all kinds of stuff. And for people who've played Pocket Camp, they probably are going

798
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:21,040
to look familiar because the characters are available in Pocket Camp. On top of that,

799
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:30,000
you can invite those animals to your village. So, you have Rila, who's the Hello Kitty one.

800
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:37,920
You have Etoile, who is a little twin stars sheep who is definitely on her way to my village. I

801
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:46,880
kicked out Shevra, finally. You have, now I forgot everybody's name, but you have a

802
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:55,040
Kero Kero Kero Pi character. You have a Pompompurin. You have My Melody, Little Twin Stars, Hello Kitty

803
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:07,200
and Cinema Roll as the other character. And now before all you could get though was their posters,

804
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:12,560
which all of my friends should have their posters by now because I have scanned them in.

805
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:19,600
But the other things that you will get from this is that you are going to get a cake for

806
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:25,760
the anniversary. And the cake is actually really cute. And I honestly think it could be remade in

807
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:31,440
person. And not a lie. Yeah, not a lie. It looks like it's like some sort of strawberry shortcake

808
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:37,040
that's done like the land in Animal Crossing with a big red one on it. Like a Christmas cake?

809
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:42,160
No. Well, kind of like a Christmas cake. Some Christmas cakes are traditionally that circular

810
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:46,800
with all the strawberries on top. This is more like a square. Okay. I gotcha. I gotcha. Okay.

811
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:56,000
Yeah. But then again, the really other big things that you're going to get are the Custom Design Pro

812
01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:05,120
Plus Editor. That is pretty cool. What you're going to get with that is that it will let you

813
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:11,680
bring in new designing features. So you're going to get access to 50 more design storage slots,

814
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:16,240
which is great because I completely ran out. And that's not just for normal, but that's for

815
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:21,680
both normal and pro. And it also gives you different things you can design like umbrellas.

816
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:27,680
Um, I saw the cutest design where someone took advantage of the shape of the umbrella to make

817
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:33,040
it look like a cat house. And those designs, by the way, are no fucking joke for the serious

818
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:37,440
Animal Crossing players, because that's how you get the things that look totally different than

819
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:43,040
what they're supposed to be. So to give a user 50 more of those is like that is the most exciting

820
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:48,480
thing about this whole patch for many people. But before I unlocked paths, I had my own custom

821
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:55,680
paths on the ground. The other things you can do, you can also purchase a custom design portal,

822
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:06,800
which basically will let you upload things directly from your in-game phone. You also

823
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,840
are going to get April Fool's Day whoopee cushions and prom decorations

824
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:18,160
available from the 1st to the 30th. The Mario stuff is still up, by the way. I think that's

825
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:27,200
permanent. Or until the 31st because, you know, Nintendo be Nintendo. At any rate, well, I have

826
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:34,560
all of them and I can forever now. So the thing about those, going back to the Sanrio cards,

827
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:40,720
is that they're only going to be available at Target starting on March 26th. For the,

828
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:47,840
you know, for the American ones, I have special acquisitions of them.

829
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:56,560
But, you know, the outfits are not ugly. They're actually kind of cute, you know. I had one of my

830
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,080
characters running around in the pom-pom portal and one which gives you like a blonde pig-tailed

831
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:06,800
wig with a beret on it. It's really cute. And I've already got a room done up in Keto-Keto-Ketopi.

832
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:11,280
We need Batsmaru in this, but I don't see that happening anytime soon.

833
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,480
I know. That's what's missing for me, but it still looks really cool.

834
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:21,280
Yeah. You know what Sanrio character I miss that I don't think is around anymore?

835
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:26,560
Robo-One. Oh, yeah. I don't think I've seen that one in a long time.

836
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:34,800
Yeah. I still have, and I'll put it on cam, I have a Robo-One paper binder and I still

837
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,800
use it for all my old artwork. I found my Batsmaru lunchbox the other day.

838
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:46,960
Well, you remember when I moved out here and I had this keychain on forever, but I have a

839
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:50,640
25-year-old Batsmaru keychain. That's awesome.

840
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:55,920
And my Bento box. But yeah.

841
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:59,280
All right. Well, lots to- We love Sanrio.

842
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:03,600
Lots to love in Animal Crossing one year later. It's nice to see the updates are still happening

843
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:08,320
and I imagine it's still going to keep going for a while, even though we've hit a full year

844
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:12,480
of Animal Crossing now, so they have done their events for the calendar year and everything.

845
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,680
I would imagine they're still going to grow the game in the coming months and continue

846
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:18,800
to add value to that. I'll tell you what, the warp

847
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,440
pipes are a fucking game changer. Oh, I bet.

848
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:27,760
Because I have one at my house, there's one at Dan's house, and there's one in front of the

849
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:34,960
alt house. And so I can just portal my way, you know, we're pretty much on any side of the island

850
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,600
I need to go because I'm lazy as fuck. So you can only have two.

851
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:44,480
No, you can have three and more, I think. But the other fun thing is that for a while,

852
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:51,040
Dan had a pipe in his house and I would find myself in Dan's house just randomly.

853
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:53,840
Like, I don't want to work my way to their house.

854
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,280
To their houses. That's funny.

855
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,320
That's kind of cool. So you know, if you were like

856
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:02,080
the ultimate and lazy or you wanted to avoid people, you put a pipe in front of like

857
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:07,200
nooks and then you put a pipe in your living room and then you just go to the store.

858
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:14,080
I could put a warp pipe in front of, you know, nooks that says fun, like a little sign pointing

859
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:18,400
at it says fun, and then they go down the warp pipe and then they end up in my basement that

860
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:22,320
looks like the murder dungeon. I could do that. Yes, you could do that.

861
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:25,600
Fun. That might be I might have to go back to Animal Crossing.

862
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:32,560
I have a little like Mario area set up with coins and the mushroom platforms and everything.

863
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:38,160
So it's really cute stuff. I also have way more lilies of the valley than I know what to do with.

864
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,560
I mean, I wish I was joking. I am not.

865
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:48,880
S2100 Matt in chat says Rob just made this dark. Can't help it. It's a gift.

866
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:57,440
Bobby says five nights at Rob's. If you don't want a permanent like murder basement at your

867
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:03,840
house, you can always decorate what's his face is Harv's basement to be a murder basement.

868
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:08,480
Oh, good thinking. But then you can create your own murder scenes,

869
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:13,280
but you can't put the warp pipe to Harv's basement. You can't. No,

870
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:17,360
but it's only a plane right away. Remember, what would Dodo's do?

871
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,760
That's true. All right. That's true. And it probably

872
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:24,960
putting the body as a plane right away is probably a better idea. All right. Moving on.

873
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,480
And then you get to see all the ridiculous stuff. What's his what's his face says.

874
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:33,760
All right. Let's go to this story is very interesting that Jason referenced

875
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,240
in the intro tonight there. Loki, tell us about this.

876
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:41,760
Yeah. So one thing Grand Theft Auto five and Grand Theft Auto online is known for is

877
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:49,840
extremely long load times. So thankfully, you know, one player who was quite a fan of the game

878
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:57,840
managed to modify it in a way that reduced load times by 70 percent. And so he had put out

879
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:06,400
a kind of a workaround to do that and then let Rockstar know that you found this way to do it.

880
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:12,400
And they actually went ahead and made it official and actually released it as a patch for the game.

881
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:19,280
So that is actually out now. You can check it out. But on top of that, not only did they

882
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:26,000
put it as an official update, but they also gave him a bug bounty reward of ten thousand dollars,

883
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:32,080
which normally they would only pay out for, say, finding security flaws or stuff like that.

884
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:36,560
But being that this improved load times by such a significant amount, I mean,

885
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:41,920
they thought that they'd make an exception to the rule and go ahead and give tossed or toast

886
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:49,280
his money, which is pretty awesome. But that's cool. Yeah. That is very interesting. I have to

887
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:53,840
go check it out because, I mean, the load times, it's been a while since I played Grand Theft Auto

888
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:58,400
five, but load times are like in the minutes. It's it's a very long load time.

889
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:05,120
I'm just kind of shocked that this was found by somebody outside of Take-Two.

890
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:09,360
You know, that's the surprising thing about it. Yeah, without the source code and stuff. So

891
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:19,520
basically just released a fix that you could check it out. But, you know, after they did some more

892
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:24,960
analysis and stuff, you know, they were able to implement it. So it was pretty awesome.

893
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:32,080
This is why we need the modding community. Exactly. Well, I mean, modding community has

894
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:37,920
been fixing games for a long time. I mean, look at anything Bethesda makes. Certainly not the first

895
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:43,040
time that they fixed something like this, but it is nice to see some of these become official

896
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:49,680
releases. I want to say, like, we've had other games do this before. I don't know if it was like

897
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:54,320
Cyberpunk or something like that, but like they had a few games where they've actually, you know,

898
01:21:54,320 --> 01:22:01,440
put out, you know, fan made mods or whatever, or incorporate that stuff into a game to be able to

899
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:06,480
make it, you know, actually run better. So that's pretty nice. As Joe and Hunter Matt says, this

900
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:13,600
saved the months of development time, I'm sure. Oh, I'm sure. For sure. Yeah. All right. All right.

901
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:20,480
All right. Well, let's move on and talk about a pretty cool discovery in this past week of some

902
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:26,000
prototypes and some demos for the PlayStation 2. It's very interesting when these kind of like

903
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:32,240
old gaming things kind of come up again. That website is the cutting room floor,

904
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:35,120
something like that, that shows all the stuff that was removed from games.

905
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:41,760
That site is really awesome. Anyway, another type of game preservation group called the

906
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:48,800
Hidden Palace over hidden palace.org has released 700 PlayStation 2 early builds,

907
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:55,920
prototypes, E3 and press release demos. They did a whole Twitch stream over six hours where they

908
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:01,040
show different PS2 pre-release builds for things like Crash Bandicoot, The Wrath of Cortex,

909
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:07,360
Final Fantasy X-2, Lego Star Wars, the video game and Crazy Taxi. Some of those builds were

910
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:11,840
only at places like E3 or they were built specifically for the preview end of things.

911
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:19,520
Some were debug builds, some were betas, but they were all found and they worked with this online

912
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:29,200
group to restore them, I guess. Over 850 gigabytes of stuff. So that's pretty cool. And I guess

913
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:33,760
the other part of this is that they're not done. Apparently there are more prototypes that they're

914
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:39,600
going to dig through and release. And certainly this gets into a whole bunch of like, well,

915
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:44,240
what is ethical? What is not? But when you consider these are all the way back in the

916
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:51,440
PlayStation 2 era, these are games that are not being sold as new anymore. I think it's a fine

917
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:57,520
thing. Especially because these were things that were, a lot of them were out there in the public

918
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:02,640
eye at things like E3 and stuff like that. People just want to preserve gaming history and this is

919
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:08,160
all a part of that and gave us the console and the games that we remember. So I think that's

920
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:12,880
pretty neat. Dartitsuya says, I saw a bit of that stream yesterday and then says the website I'm

921
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:18,640
trying to think of Cutting Room Floor, TCRF.net. And then Hidden Palace is the group that did this.

922
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:24,880
They were showing a Simpsons skateboarding game. Yeah, pretty cool. So I like when we get the whole

923
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:30,800
stuff from the past and the, ooh, we almost had this instead of this and the differences.

924
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:34,720
There's also Twitter called, I think like Forest of Illusion or Land of Illusion,

925
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:37,680
something like that. Oh yeah. I think I've heard of that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And they link back to

926
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:44,800
some of this too. Nice. All right. Well, what a nice segue into our segment called the Classic

927
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:49,440
Game of the Week where Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that

928
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:55,600
she thinks, Hey, you should check this game out. This wasn't a cut game. This was actually released

929
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:59,280
and actually the game she picked tonight, A, I can't believe she didn't pick before because this

930
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:03,120
is a game that I would have picked as Classic Game of the Week because I played a lot of this,

931
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:09,760
believe it or not. I love this game. Um, but, uh, I love the logo for this game. I love a lot about

932
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:14,160
this game. I love the music in this game. I love the characters, but anyway, uh, and I think it's

933
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:22,720
a great, uh, it's also great show off of the system that it's on. Anyway, uh, Dark Sakura,

934
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:27,600
Classic Game of the Week. What are we talking about? So the Classic Game of the Week is UN

935
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:32,640
Squadron, which in Japan was called Area 88. And we are looking at the Japanese version of the game

936
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:38,800
tonight. Yeah. Um, just, you know, I, I, the big, it was just happened to be like the, the better

937
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:45,360
quality one that I found, but I freaking love the, the logo for the unicorn with the main on fire.

938
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:53,200
I mean, I would have a tattoo of that if I could, you know, um, if it wasn't like so like niche

939
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:59,440
there, but to go into a little bit of detail, Area 88 was a manga. Um, and the characters in

940
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:05,840
the game are from the manga. There was also, uh, uh, an anime that actually had some really

941
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:15,040
good music in it. Um, I just, I actually watched the OAV last night. Um, but at any rate, um, they,

942
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:22,720
the, their goal is to stop a terrorist group that's called Project 4. So, um, this game, uh,

943
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:31,520
came out, uh, in the arcade. Um, it was, uh, public, it was done by Capcom. It came out,

944
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:36,720
actually, there were, there were various different releases of it. So the, um, the arcade release was

945
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:45,520
on, uh, in August, 1989. And then on the Super Nintendo, July 26th, uh, 1991 in Japan, September

946
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:53,200
91 in North America and December 92 in, uh, Europe. So it is a side scrolling shooter,

947
01:26:53,200 --> 01:27:00,160
which was actually against kind of Capcom's established style because they, you know,

948
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:06,720
1942, 1943, the battle of Midway, they were, um, were vertical, uh, scrolling shooters. This was

949
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:11,520
a side scrolling shooter, but very similar to a lot of their other ones. Um, you start,

950
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:17,120
you have an energy bar that's consumed over the course of your single life when you sustain damage.

951
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:24,240
Um, now one of the things that, um, that it has is, um,

952
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:30,640
um, that, you know, a lot of the games are like, when you get hit, you, you know,

953
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:38,320
your ship blows up and a new ship blows in until you're out of lives. So before you enter a level,

954
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:44,320
you can also purchase special weapons, um, or defense in the shop. It was just funny, the shop,

955
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:50,640
you know, everybody in this game is from the manga or anime. Um, but you earn money to buy

956
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:54,640
your weapons by destroying enemy planes and vehicles during the level. And then when you're

957
01:27:54,640 --> 01:28:01,680
finished, any unused weapons are converted back into money. So you can play as one of

958
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:08,400
three main characters. You have Shin Kazama, you have Mickey Simon and you have Greg Gates.

959
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:14,560
And each pilot has their own plane and their own specialty in the supernest version,

960
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:20,560
you can get a different range of planes. So you start off with 300, uh, with the,

961
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:25,920
sorry, $3,000 and the F8 Crusader, and you can buy other aircraft and weapon as you progress.

962
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:33,200
Um, and one of the things that was mentioned in the development of this game is that this is one

963
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:40,400
of the games that was a part of Capcom strategy to appeal to a wider audience by using characters

964
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:45,760
that were established in other media because they thought their own characters were too niche.

965
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:54,400
So, um, other games that were in this category was Willow, which I talked about in another session

966
01:28:54,400 --> 01:29:01,920
and Destiny of an Emperor. Um, the area area 88 was, uh, ported to, um, super Nintendo,

967
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:10,560
super Famicom. Um, and then of course, retitled as UN squadron, um, in, uh, US and Europe. Um,

968
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:17,760
and the poster that was created for it, for the Western audiences was actually done by

969
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:22,960
an illustrator named Mark Erickson, who was also the illustrator of the Mega Man 2 and

970
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:31,360
Strider covers. Um, there was a version that was also for the Capcom power system changer.

971
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:40,480
It was planned, but it was never released. Um, in Japan, uh, Game Machine was, uh, the, uh,

972
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:49,520
sixth most successful, uh, arcade unit of 1989. Um, Famitsu gave it a 28 out of 40 for the

973
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:57,040
super Nintendo. IGN ranked, uh, the game as 37th on the top 100 super Nintendo games list,

974
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:01,840
which was the highest ranking side scrolling shooter on the list. And EGM gave this NES

975
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:10,800
version an A and picked it as the 12th greatest game available in 1991. So, I mean, this game,

976
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:16,480
it gets nuts as you go through it too. I mean, it's not, I would say one of the super easiest

977
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:21,840
games and I've seen people beat this on the hardest mode. So kudos to them. And then of

978
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:28,480
course there was, um, while there wasn't a true sequel, there was a spiritual successor called

979
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:35,120
Carrier Air Wing. And I may go over this game a little bit later. It came out in 1990 and it

980
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:42,560
was also, um, it was a CP, uh, system arcade, uh, machine that only had an arcade release.

981
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:51,200
But, um, but the thing that's notable more about Area 88 is because it's port to super Nintendo

982
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:58,960
really, I think boosted the knowledge of this game outside of Japan and really boosted its

983
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:04,320
popularity in general. It made it accessible to audiences that might not have seen it otherwise.

984
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:14,880
So, um, that is the classic game. It is UN squadron or, uh, area 88, which, um, has a cool

985
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:21,040
logo because it's a unicorn on fire. Great pick. Um, like I said, you know, before we went into the

986
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:24,720
game tonight, um, this is a game I remember playing a lot on the super Nintendo. I didn't

987
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:30,160
own it. I think I rented it at least three or four times. So, uh, cause I really enjoy this game. Um,

988
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:35,920
but, um, interesting about the review scores when you were going over that, how Famitsu, I mean,

989
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:40,960
I realized the Famitsu criteria, especially in the older days was really tough. Like, you know,

990
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:46,960
very few games used to get forties, fairly decent score for me too. I guess, but it just seems so

991
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:52,240
different than what the rest of the world. Then you talk about these U S based, uh, publications

992
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:56,320
are giving it much higher scores and putting it in their top games of the year. It just seems like

993
01:31:56,320 --> 01:32:01,520
such a, like maybe this game wasn't as well, and correct me if I'm wrong, maybe this game just

994
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:07,280
wasn't as well received into culture in Japan, the way it was here, even though it was based off

995
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:13,760
a Japanese manga. It's really not a bad score for Famitsu. Yeah. For that era of Famitsu. It's really,

996
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:20,000
they are so stingy with good scores. I guess that's true. Yeah. Um, and you know,

997
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:29,120
keep in mind too, that, you know, this is a timeframe in Japan where, you know, we have so

998
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:35,280
many other, you know, a lot of the great shooters were actually on the mega drive and a PC engine.

999
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:47,920
Mm. So I mean, there was definitely better out, but you know, this game by no extension was a bad

1000
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:54,160
game. A 28, you know, keep in mind, this is 28 out of 40. So it's almost 30. I thought you said

1001
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:59,840
20. Oh, no, I said 28. Oh, okay. Well, 28 is a little better. Yeah. Oh God. I thought you

1002
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:04,960
said 20 and I was like, that's not a great score. All right. 28 would just be like average. Okay.

1003
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:10,160
28. Yeah. Okay. Okay. That's a little, that's a little more reasonable. Okay. Cool. Yeah. All

1004
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:15,040
right. There it is. Your classic game of the week. UN squadron area, area 88, depending on where you

1005
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:22,560
live. I think area 88 was a better name. Yeah. Well, I knew, I knew it was better. Yeah, true.

1006
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:26,640
There is that. I mean, not just, well, I mean, the unicorn was in both of them, but I think that the

1007
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:35,120
text, even like if you find the, the anime, the US releases, even the logo for area 88 in English

1008
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:40,400
looked better than the one for UN squadron. UN squadron was kind of dull. All right. Well,

1009
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:46,240
let's check out some other news going on in the gaming world with some rapid fire news. Um, let's

1010
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:50,880
go to, uh, why did I type games in the sidebar tonight on Twitch TV? It should be rapid fire

1011
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:55,360
news. That's all right. We'll talk about some games in rapid fire news. I guess that's what

1012
01:33:55,360 --> 01:34:00,720
happens when I type too fast, rapid fire type the stuff up tonight. I mush words together.

1013
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:07,600
All right. Logie. All right. Um, so we've got some more announcements regarding fixes coming to

1014
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:15,360
cyberpunk 2077. So the next fix that they have planned is going to be fixing the cop AI, which

1015
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:25,280
it's severely needed and also the way the cars handle. So this is, um, patch 1.2 and they said

1016
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:31,680
fewer cops are going to randomly spawn directly behind you. The second you pull, you step out,

1017
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:38,160
um, they have adjustments for speed and steering, make driving easier and sensitivity slider

1018
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:45,040
tweaks. They cars control even better, even when the frame rate dips down the new unstuck feature

1019
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:51,360
that activates when you accelerate, but don't move because you're stuck on something and, uh,

1020
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:58,160
more options for the wise bindings on keyboard and option to turn off double tapping, um,

1021
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:03,840
the movement key to dodge. So, uh, that's supposed to be coming out here pretty soon,

1022
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:09,520
but they haven't really announced yet when it's going to be coming. At least we know what it's

1023
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:16,480
going to fix. And the copy, I mean, I've seen videos where they've spawned into walls and stuff

1024
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:20,800
or you're up on a top of a building and you shoot somebody and also there's a cop like right behind

1025
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:27,600
you. Like how, how did you get there? So, um, very cool to see that happening. Um, and then also

1026
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:36,240
game that I'm not too excited about, but it is, uh, something that was shown off during the,

1027
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:42,320
uh, you know, like kind of the E3 period last year. So Gotham Knights was the brand new

1028
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:48,960
Warner brothers Montreal game. Well, it's been delayed to 2022, which is not surprising because

1029
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:56,560
I know a lot of folks are, a lot of teams are behind with, um, just development because of

1030
01:35:56,560 --> 01:36:04,480
COVID. And of course, you know, the trend nowadays thankfully has been to give the developers a little

1031
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:11,360
bit more time. So the game doesn't release as a buggy mess. So, um, yeah, glad to see that they're

1032
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:16,960
giving it more time before we get to dark soccer's rapid fire news. I'm, I'm giggling here because,

1033
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:22,160
we could hear Stella in the background or you're at Loki and dark soccer and chat,

1034
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:25,040
but hi smush. And I was like, Oh no, that's not smush. That's Stella.

1035
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:30,960
I should recognize the voice. She's across from, she's on the entire other side of the house.

1036
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:34,480
She's not even in the same room as I am in right now. That's how loud she is.

1037
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:41,040
But we have vaulted ceilings in there. No, we don't have vaulted ceilings. We just have a

1038
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:45,760
cheap house. I've got a vaulted ceiling in mine just because they didn't build a, you know,

1039
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:50,800
a ceiling. Yeah. It's a vaulted ceiling here too. Yeah. But, but, but what I was going to say is

1040
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:57,760
that smush walked in here after that, because I think he heard Stella because there's also the

1041
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:01,680
play through on the TV here. So I think here, cause I was like, well now smush is here cause

1042
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:06,000
he's meowing at something. He probably heard Stella. That's just cracking me up. So no,

1043
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:11,840
I think she's being kicked. See, she likes laying down in my oldest son's room and sleeps on his

1044
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:16,320
bed. And so since they're going to bed, she probably got kicked out of there. And so now

1045
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:20,640
she's screaming at everybody for attention. Oh no, smush is here because other daddy is

1046
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:27,280
feeding him right now. That's why smushes. Yes. See, I, I lock Midna out of this room and I wear

1047
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:34,480
headphones. So I wear headphones too, but this, this mic picks everything up. It's crazy. So,

1048
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:42,400
all right. Anyhow, uh, let's mail, mail, mail, mail. Yes. And now a lot of folks in our chat

1049
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:49,200
over twitch.tv slash VOG network are spanning the smush emote because Alan got a smush emote

1050
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:54,960
because he's allowed, he's also smushes dad. So, uh, he took a smush emote for his channel,

1051
01:37:54,960 --> 01:38:00,000
which if you go to his channel, he always has a little, like instead of the NBC or CBS logo in

1052
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:05,440
the corner all the time, he has a smush logo in the corner all the time. So, uh, he, he took that

1053
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:10,480
emote, but people that are subbing to his channel are now spamming that emote here. So you might be

1054
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:14,720
wondering, is VOG network going to get a smush emote? I don't know. We might. I mean, it's not

1055
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:21,600
like we can't have more smush emotes. Um, but we maybe want a Midna emote or a Stella emote,

1056
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:28,640
and maybe that'll be a thing. So we'll see. All right. Dark Tetsuya says my wife's cat heard all

1057
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:33,760
the cat talk apparently. And then, uh, to which bonds double 06, uh, followed up with

1058
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:42,880
instead of ASMR, it's going to be cat talk. Ready? ASMR needs to go away forever.

1059
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:48,800
All right. Moving on, but cat talk, cat talk and stay, right?

1060
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:54,160
Cat talk stays forever. ASMR dies. It's so terrible. It makes me so uncomfortable.

1061
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:58,080
All right. Well, hopefully, uh, some rapid fire news won't make you uncomfortable.

1062
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:00,160
Stark soccer. What do you have for us in rapid fire news tonight?

1063
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:07,440
Well, um, super bomber man are, is going to be coming to PS4, Xbox one switch and PC is a free

1064
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:12,960
to play title. Um, the PC one will be through steam. Um, and of course it was first announced

1065
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:19,200
for Stadia, um, September, 2020. So now we're getting it everywhere else because Stadia is

1066
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:27,120
dying, I think. And then technically no, but realistically, yeah.

1067
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:32,720
Realistically it's looking like Deadpool right about now. Um, anyway, and then, uh,

1068
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:40,480
there is a new owner for Toys R Us and they plan on reopening stores. Um, the quote says we're

1069
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:45,600
coming off a year where toys are on fire and for Toys R Us, the U S is really a blank canvas.

1070
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:54,640
So, uh, they've actually tried a couple of pop-up locations, um, that closed due to poor traffic.

1071
01:39:54,640 --> 01:40:01,600
Um, you know, that just had to do from COVID, but, um, they are looking like they're coming

1072
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:05,040
back and meeting that's purchased on the Toys R Us website right now, those still being routed

1073
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:10,640
through Amazon, just saying so cool. We can still be Toys R Us kidlets.

1074
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:18,640
That'll be nice to go to stores again, to go to the mall again. I mean, I guess technically

1075
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:22,800
I could go now, but I just haven't really, I haven't really had the desire to go to, uh, you

1076
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:29,840
know, uh, bed bath and beyond that strongly, you know, to brave them all. So, but now, now that the

1077
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:34,000
jabs are here, I'm feeling a little better. I'll feel a lot better in about a month.

1078
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:42,160
I am not going until that two weeks after I've had my shot. Yeah. I'm then I'm going to fucking San

1079
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:47,520
Francisco. I know I'm trying to be a good boy too. And, uh, wait, but I'm, I'm, uh, very happy

1080
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:51,760
thinking ahead to may, you know, even if we can't have the big conventions yet, we don't know. We

1081
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:56,320
don't know the status of some of these. The nice thing will be, is that like, I can go see a movie

1082
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:02,480
and not feel like it's going to be, you know, a horrific experience. It'll be nice to have some

1083
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:09,600
normal things back. Uh, COVID living hasn't been any different. Well, except working from home and,

1084
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:14,560
and having to leave the house even less for me, it's been very different. So, all right. Anyhow,

house in Fata Morgana dreams of the revenants edition comes out on the switch this week as

1106
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:43,760
well. AI kiss two in regular and limited edition and a sea of saltitude. The director's cut comes

1107
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:50,800
out in Japan as well. A busy week in Japan, my heavens, uh, a clockwork lay line, uh, Kageiro

1108
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:56,880
no Samayo Majo comes out this week and the quintessential quintuplets summer memories also

1109
01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:02,960
come in five. That is the name of the game comes out this week. Uh, SD Gundam G generation Genesis

1110
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:09,200
for Nintendo switch also out this week, busy week. And there's lastly a game called lover pretend,

1111
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:13,680
which I thought was kind of an interesting name. I was like lover pretend. Is that like a one night

1112
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:17,760
lover? Like what is that? Uh, but it turns out it looks like it's based on a manga as you know,

1113
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:22,320
some of these games are, uh, often, uh, doing that. And I was kind of like reading up on what

1114
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:27,280
this is and I guess it's about a main character and, uh, she is studying for university and

1115
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:33,600
doing part-time work and she wants to become a script writer, uh, which was also her mom's dream.

1116
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:40,240
And then she wants to find her father who she never met. So she goes to talk to people that

1117
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:51,280
were involved in the drama and as such becomes cast in the, the drama itself as the love interest.

1118
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:56,560
So it's a fake. So lover pretend is because she's the fake love interest in the, I don't know.

1119
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:00,240
I was like, this is some drama for a Nintendo switch game. This is some drama

1120
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:07,600
anyway, uh, on the PlayStation five this week, uh, ballon wonderland. And that's really about it.

1121
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:12,240
It's a much slower week in the PlayStation universe. All right. Uh, let's move on dark

1122
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:18,080
soccer. How about the UK? Just a little bit. We have, um, uh, uh, basically all of this is

1123
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:23,840
on the 26th. We have over overcooked, all you can eat, uh, samurai showdown. Oh wait,

1124
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:29,600
that's the 23rd. Sorry. The 25th we have hunting simulator to tennis world tour to, um,

1125
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:37,520
monster truck championship. Um, on the 26th, we have, uh, the monster Hunter, uh,

1126
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:44,160
Nintendo switch edition plus the pro controller, um, hot shot racing. We have a story of seasons,

1127
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:51,200
pioneers of all of town. We have monster Hunter rise ballon, wonder world space-based star topia.

1128
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:57,200
That's just a cool sounding name. Isn't it? And it takes two. All right. Pretty busy week for games,

1129
01:45:57,200 --> 01:46:01,120
all things considered all around the world. All right. We have some more news stories for you

1130
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:05,680
guys, and then we're going to take more of your comments and questions and discussion items,

1131
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:10,160
um, in our listener round table segment. So, um, joining the fun over at twitch.tv slash

1132
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:14,800
VOG network, or you can always send the show an email participate at orange lounge radio.com.

1133
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:19,040
I think we have a couple of those tonight, but we'll get to those later for now. We have some

1134
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:26,080
news Loki. Yeah. So Google has announced that they're going to be dropping the service fees

1135
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:32,960
on the first million that developers make off of their apps on the Google play store,

1136
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:41,200
from 15% to 30 or from 30 to 15%. So that's going to start July 1st. And that's for the

1137
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:45,840
first million dollars that they make on their app. Um, they said that of course,

1138
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:50,560
that's helping developers build sustainable business is part of the core part of Google

1139
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:54,960
plays mission. We're working with partners every day to understand their challenges that they face

1140
01:46:54,960 --> 01:47:00,400
and bring them innovative ideas. Um, I think this probably is directly related to the whole

1141
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:07,360
Epic games, uh, lawsuit thing that they had with Google play and over the app store

1142
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:13,920
on the Apple side of things. Um, I mean, it's a good move that they are dropping that fee down,

1143
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:19,040
but I have a feeling it's somewhat related to that. So I guess we'll see what, what happens

1144
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:24,320
with this. Well, it's also kind of reminiscent of what, um, some of the stores on PC have been

1145
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:30,480
doing, right? Cause, uh, didn't Epic games start a thing there that kind of had waves where, you

1146
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:34,800
know, folks are taking smaller cuts, at least for that first little chunk of money. Well, yeah,

1147
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:41,200
Epic games had always had like smaller fees. Um, I think, you know, steam was still the one that

1148
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:47,440
was kind of like, you know, uh, charging more. I want to say though that steam has a deal in place

1149
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:52,400
too for certain things, but I can't remember the details on that. And I want to say that was

1150
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:56,720
something more for like almost larger developers, like after a certain period of time, they'd take

1151
01:47:56,720 --> 01:48:02,480
less, but I don't remember. It's been a while, but yeah, I'm sure this is directly related to

1152
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:09,440
their lawsuits. Hmm. We'll have to see what develops with the lawsuits. All right, moving on.

1153
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:15,760
So whereas there's a smaller cut from Google there, uh, if you are a G force now, uh, person,

1154
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:18,880
there's going to be a larger cut in the future. Well, actually, no, not if you're, if you're

1155
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:23,040
using it today, nothing's going to change for you. But if you were thinking about getting on

1156
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:28,000
G force now, uh, it's going to cost you a little more money at this point. So here's what happened.

1157
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:34,160
Uh, Nvidia doubled the price of G force now up to $10 a month. So it was $5 a month before

1158
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:38,320
now it's $10 a month. Uh, if you want an annual plan, it's going to be a hundred dollars a year.

1159
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:43,200
The good news is though, if you are already subscribing to this, you're now locked into

1160
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:48,400
the founder's plan, all the same perks as priority, only $5 a month. So that's pretty

1161
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:53,680
cool. I wish Netflix would do that. Uh, instead of the price going up every, every couple months,

1162
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:58,880
um, you're locked in at $5, essentially for life, as long as you don't cancel,

1163
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:02,320
pause, you know, as long as your subscription stays in good standing, you're locked in at that

1164
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:07,680
$5 rate. So, um, that's pretty cool. But yeah, if you've been waiting to get in on G force now,

1165
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:13,040
whoops, you waited too long. Now it's going to cost $10 a month. Um, Nvidia, uh, in an interview

1166
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:18,480
with a games beat, uh, was talking about the $10 a month is the target price. They were really

1167
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:22,560
wanting to go for this whole time. They were subsidizing the cost to make the service more

1168
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:26,960
appealing. If you haven't used G force now, it kind of came around at the same time as say

1169
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:32,000
things like stadia. And it's somewhat the same concept. It's cloud gaming. However,

1170
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:37,920
uh, it's cloud gaming based on titles you already own. So if you bought a game on steam,

1171
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:44,720
you can essentially play that game in the cloud with a G force. Now, if the studio has allowed

1172
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:49,440
it, because this, uh, service was in the news a lot in the early days, because they put a lot

1173
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:55,120
of games on it that, uh, developers didn't want it on it because they saw it as kind of infringing

1174
01:49:55,120 --> 01:50:00,080
on their rights and the money that they're entitled to. So only so many games have really

1175
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:04,800
allowed themselves to be on this platform. Um, I know I've, I've played because they have a free

1176
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:08,720
version. If you want to try it, you're limited to like an hour and you have to wait a little

1177
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:12,800
bit, a couple of minutes to get into your game session. But I played around with no man's sky,

1178
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:17,840
of course, love that game. I played around with that in the G force now. And it was, uh, it was,

1179
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:24,320
you know, it was similar to stadia, you know, uh, it was like I was playing a YouTube live. Um,

1180
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:29,120
but, uh, it's nice for especially computers that maybe are having a hard time, uh, struggling with

1181
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:35,200
a game that you bought that really demands high-end hardware there. So also an update,

1182
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:40,000
apparently coming out to G force now, um, that will, uh, improve streaming quality through an

1183
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:46,560
adaptive V sync technology. This will sync frame rates at either 60 Hertz or 59.94 Hertz on the

1184
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:50,720
server side to match how the games are displayed in the client that they are looking to cut down

1185
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:56,960
stutter and latency with this. So that's kind of interesting. Um, I'm curious, especially for the

1186
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:02,800
chat, what do you all think about this G force now? Do any of you use it? Do any of you find

1187
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:07,520
it to be the preferable alternative to stadia? I do like that. Essentially, if you buy a game,

1188
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:14,320
you have it on both services. Now it's the whole, you got to pony up money to use somebody else's

1189
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:20,080
computer, but I suppose that's not much different than say using a VPN or something like that.

1190
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:23,760
So I don't know, Loki, any interest from you for, uh, G force now?

1191
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:31,520
No, not really. Cause I'm not going to stream more games considering that, uh, I have so many

1192
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:37,600
of my games already that I don't play. So I just don't have a real need to stream stuff with G

1193
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:43,360
force. Now I'll just install them and play them if I need to. But yeah, probably not.

1194
01:51:44,160 --> 01:51:50,720
Ice P in chat says G force now. I'm sorry. It's ice P one in chat says G force. Now I can't take

1195
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:54,880
the latency. I don't remember having latency issues. I'll have to try it again. To be fair.

1196
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:58,720
I played it like months ago and it was first in the headlines. I never bothered paying for it.

1197
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:02,720
I just played the free version just because I was curious, wanting to check it out. Um,

1198
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:08,400
tiger law does say you need good internet for G force now, however. Um, and, uh,

1199
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:13,360
as a 200, Matt says, how about getting one of those G force RTX cards?

1200
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:19,840
Now talk about things. You're just going to give up on buying until it's actually on the store

1201
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:25,600
shell for those high-end graphics cards. My God, that's a whole other, I'm scared for the day.

1202
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:29,760
I finally need to update my graphics card cause games won't run on my PC anymore. I might have

1203
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:33,520
to use cloud gaming cause I'm not going to be able to find a fucking graphics card because people

1204
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:40,880
need their doge coin, I guess. Ugh. All right. Anyhow, hopefully the pandemic will solve some,

1205
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:46,160
one or sorry, is the pandemic being over or I shouldn't say over, but, um, behind us,

1206
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:51,440
let's say, uh, will be, uh, help some of these issues, but we'll see. Moving on.

1207
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:54,160
How about a subject that I know dark saga is very interested in.

1208
01:52:55,120 --> 01:53:02,400
Yay. Dragon age. Um, so, uh, BioWare, um, you know, basically threw us a bone,

1209
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:08,520
all of us who have been waiting for dragon age four. We hadn't had any news in a while. Um,

1210
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:15,600
so it is going, you know, they did, uh, basically have a report that they're going to be dropping

1211
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:19,360
all of the multiplayer features that they were going to put in it just to keep it as a single

1212
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:29,040
player RPG. Um, but they did release some concept art, um, for, it looks like a, a mage character.

1213
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:34,000
Um, really cool looking. I like the, the style of it. I've always actually liked the,

1214
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:40,560
ever since dragon age two, I think that they've really found their styles for the various parts,

1215
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:48,560
you know, areas in, in their world. Um, but yeah, they put this Twitter up and saying that

1216
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:52,880
we could use a little pick me up. So it was awfully nice of them. And of course, uh,

1217
01:53:53,840 --> 01:54:00,720
we're not going to really get the game until probably, uh, April, 2022. So it'll be next

1218
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:06,080
year's birthday present, but Hey, at least you have that mass effect trilogy coming up.

1219
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:12,240
I got to decide if, if, if they don't do a Mac version, then I got to get a new card for

1220
01:54:12,240 --> 01:54:19,600
my, my poor dying PC. So we'll see no interest in trying console just to kind of bridge it.

1221
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:26,160
I thought I'd try. I'm going to, I'm going to get it for my series X,

1222
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:32,000
but I played the series the first time. What I mod. Oh yeah. There is that true, true.

1223
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:38,080
All right. Yeah. Let's move on to, uh, games in the future. We might be able to mod Loki.

1224
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:45,600
Well, uh, Jade Raymond has announced that she is going to be formatting or forming a new,

1225
01:54:46,240 --> 01:54:52,240
uh, independent studio called Haven. And that they're going to be working on a brand new IP

1226
01:54:52,240 --> 01:55:00,720
developed for PlayStation better luck. Wasn't she in the news like two weeks ago for leaving stadia?

1227
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:10,000
Yeah. So, well, first party development. So, uh, she says, I'm proud to, uh, proud of the

1228
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:15,760
team we built at stadia, um, games, entertainment, and the ground breaking work on exclusive games

1229
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:20,000
for that platform. It was difficult decision to take a new opportunity and I will be forever

1230
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:27,440
grateful for this team for everything we learned at chief together, Google. Yeah. She didn't put

1231
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:33,920
that in there, but, um, but yeah, so they're apparently, uh, I mean, working on new IP,

1232
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:40,640
so we'll have to see what that is, but that sounds pretty exciting. Yeah. Like I said,

1233
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:45,120
good for her. And I liked the fact that it's an original IP. And so it's something that Sony's

1234
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:50,240
trying to use to kind of add to their side of things. So, um, we'll have to see what they come

1235
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:55,200
up with. Obviously this is, this ain't something you're going to be playing until like 2024.

1236
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:01,920
It's just going to be a ways out, but, um, it's, it's, it's in progress, I guess. All right.

1237
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:08,720
That'd be interesting. Well, if you want to play some games a lot sooner on the PlayStation, uh,

1238
01:56:08,720 --> 01:56:15,120
boy, oh boy, they're coming through with 10 free games. That's right. Not, not PlayStation plus

1239
01:56:15,120 --> 01:56:20,240
games. Those are still a thing that happened every month, but this is under the, um, uh,

1240
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:27,040
PlayStation play at home promo, uh, is that they're actually giving away 10 free games. However,

1241
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:31,360
you only have about a month to grab them. So from March 25th at eight in the evening,

1242
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:35,920
and I wouldn't try to grab it right when they go live, till April 22nd at eight in the evening,

1243
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:42,960
you can grab Abzu, Enter the Gungeon, Rez Infinite, Subnautica, The Witness,

1244
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:51,360
Astro Bot Rescue Mission, Moss, Thumper, and Paper Beast, all for free. It should be pointed out,

1245
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:57,600
the Astro Bot Rescue Mission, Moss, and Paper Beast. Those are PlayStation VR titles. Otherwise

1246
01:56:57,600 --> 01:57:03,040
two of them are VR optional titles. The music games are as infinite and thumper. Um, but still,

1247
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:08,560
uh, yeah, that's pretty amazing. Now I only named nine games. That's because the 10th game,

1248
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:15,600
Horizon Zero Dawn, the complete edition will be free from April 19th until May 14th. That's my

1249
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:21,360
birthday. So that will happy birthday. Here's a free game. Um, right now for some people, I mean,

1250
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:29,600
it's, it's, I gotta say, if you're on PlayStation Plus, I think at least one, two, three, four of

1251
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:37,200
these have been PlayStation Plus titles in the past. However, um, free is free. Uh, and that is

1252
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:42,080
sometimes the price you pay of being an early adopter, right? You buy Final Fantasy 7 remake

1253
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:46,640
for 60 bucks and then a year later they're giving it away, but they, they have some nice perks for

1254
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:51,600
the folks that were in there originally. And I bet, well, I was going to say, I bet with

1255
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:55,440
Horizon Zero Dawn, they're not giving away the DLC, but then it's staring me right there in the

1256
01:57:55,440 --> 01:58:00,720
face. Complete edition. So how about that? But of course, they're trying to stir up a lot of buzz

1257
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:07,600
for the sequel. I'm sure. Ain't nothing real free in this world. Anyway, uh, this is Play at Home

1258
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:13,680
2021. There is also a 90 day trial that is an extended trial for Funimation. If you're, uh,

1259
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:18,800
wanting to get in on that, you have from March 25th to April 22nd to get in on that.

1260
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:23,360
So again, you do not need PlayStation Plus for these free games. This is outside of that.

1261
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:29,680
All you need is a PlayStation device to play them on. And I would imagine a PS5 would work for all

1262
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:35,120
these PS4 games with your backwards compatibility. Uh, just the VR titles, you know, unless you have

1263
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:39,920
that adapter are going to be a little, little trickier, but pretty cool. Uh, anything in that

1264
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:45,760
list you guys are going to be grabbing? I'll grab everything. I haven't, I don't think I've

1265
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:51,120
Astrobot yet, but yeah, I was gonna say I have everything except the VR only titles. So the

1266
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:55,200
Astrobot and Moss are like the only things that I literally have every other game that they're

1267
01:58:55,200 --> 01:59:00,480
giving away, but I'm not mad because I realized for other people, it's going to be a chance that,

1268
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:05,760
you know, they're getting to play the games for the first time. So pretty cool. Uh, good point

1269
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:12,400
from bonds, double 06. I have four of those games in Epic platform. So on PC and the Epic store,

1270
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:16,880
sometimes they do giveaways and some of those games will actually a lot like every week. So

1271
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:21,200
some of those games have been in the Epic, uh, free stuff too. Uh, and pixel pockets is

1272
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:25,120
recommending Moss. It's a great game. Highly recommended if you have PlayStation VR. Yeah.

1273
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:29,600
I've heard of that one before. And I, you know, a lot of times with these games, there's probably

1274
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:34,560
a reason they're giving them away too, is that they really kind of show off the platform. Um,

1275
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:39,760
and it's, you know, especially with a lot of the rabble rabble in the last week being game pass,

1276
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:44,800
game pass, game pass. Maybe this isn't Sony's answer to game pass, but this is definitely

1277
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:50,320
Sony's like, here's how we treat our PlayStation crowd. You know, here's just 10 free games on the

1278
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:56,640
house. Enjoy. So something for everyone. It's interesting. All right. I thought, I thought

1279
01:59:56,640 --> 02:00:02,560
free games was a nice thing to end things on tonight. All right. Uh, let's get into the Lister

1280
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:08,640
round table every week. We invite you guys to, um, add things to the show, uh, whether it be in

1281
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:14,240
our chat room or through our mailbag participate at orange lounge radio.com. And I think dark

1282
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:22,080
Sakura is going to open up the mailbag right now. Yep. We, um, we have two emails, so I'll go ahead

1283
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:27,680
and read the first. Um, this one comes from Ranma greetings, everyone. I hope that everyone had a

1284
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:31,920
great week, Rob, and the last couple of episodes, you mentioned a couple of things I wanted to

1285
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:36,720
discuss when you mentioned how conventions are going virtual with events and panels,

1286
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:40,880
and that when we return to some sense of normalcy, that streaming will still be a part of the

1287
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:46,160
convention. That is something that I wish for as well. The problem is most hotels and convention

1288
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:50,480
centers may not have the bandwidth for it from working with other Twitch streamers,

1289
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:56,960
having a connection up to 10 megs up and down is perfect for a 10 ADP stream. Most hotels and

1290
02:00:56,960 --> 02:01:02,160
convention centers will have a two megabit connection. If that I can vouch for this and

1291
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:06,400
they charge an arm and a leg for higher speed connections. If it is available because of that,

1292
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:11,040
I have a feeling that the conventions will drop that and rely on recording panels and events to

1293
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:18,320
post on their YouTube page at a later date. On top of that, uh, these conventions would need to set

1294
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:23,600
up cameras and streaming equipment in each room. Some conventions may have the finances to do this.

1295
02:01:23,600 --> 02:01:29,760
Others may not be so lucky, but I am one of the few geek media outlets that have come prepared

1296
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:35,040
and will help to the best of my abilities. So let's hope, I think it means that this can be

1297
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:39,920
a part of the new norm. You're at home dude. Um, uh, I also think when it comes to like the

1298
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:46,080
hotel thing and their shitty internet as the joke, this is going to be something that I think is

1299
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:51,440
going to be like the convention centers of, of the world and the hotels. This is something that

1300
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:55,680
they're going to need to up their game on because if they see this coming where there's going to be

1301
02:01:55,680 --> 02:02:00,720
more of a demand for virtual events, then they need to stop being the laughing stock of internet.

1302
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:06,960
And I understand a convention with thousands of nerds places a huge demand on bad bandwidth.

1303
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:12,240
It's very challenging to me. I get that. But I think this is a challenge that the hotel and

1304
02:02:12,240 --> 02:02:16,880
the convention center industry kind of needs to meet in that new normal. I think if we're talking

1305
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:24,240
about the, the industry is changing, then all parts of that industry, not just the convention

1306
02:02:24,240 --> 02:02:28,880
itself, but the venues that are charging the conventions money to host them are going to

1307
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:32,800
have to change. If I were going to put on a convention and I knew this place had shitty

1308
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:36,480
internet and this place had decent internet, I'd want to go to the place of decent internet.

1309
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:41,840
So I think this is something we might see. Maybe that reputation may evolve a little bit, but again,

1310
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:48,960
it's, it's tough for these hotels and stuff because they're just not prepared for a convention

1311
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:54,960
that draws thousands of nerds when most of the year they don't have those types of conventions.

1312
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:58,560
So it'll be, it'll, it'll really, I mean, when we're talking about the convention scene,

1313
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:05,280
we have to talk about business conventions, you know, conventions about bridal expos and car

1314
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:11,120
shows that also, if they're not evolving to some more virtual stuff, then these venues are not

1315
02:03:11,120 --> 02:03:15,360
going to see the need. So something to think about anyway, sorry, Jamie, but wanted to respond

1316
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:21,520
to that before we move on to another bullet. Okay. The next point, number two, you also

1317
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:26,240
mentioned that OLR is about gaming, even though it was all the other hosts have taken time out

1318
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:30,240
to talk about other important matters last week. I don't fully remember if you said that was a good

1319
02:03:30,240 --> 02:03:35,200
thing or not and apologizing for going off topic, but to be honest, most of us are here for that.

1320
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:42,240
I love how you, Jamie and Matt bring up important topics here for, sorry, I got lost,

1321
02:03:42,240 --> 02:03:47,840
that us gamers need to know. So many people listen to podcasts and why not? And I do know that we

1322
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:53,040
lost a listener when you spoke about BLM. I was touched and moved by that. That was something I

1323
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:58,240
truly appreciated. And if anyone else has a problem with that, then they can stop listening. OLR is

1324
02:03:58,240 --> 02:04:04,800
family and we take care of family and no one gets left behind. Amen. I guess ironic considering the

1325
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:08,560
topic, I didn't know this was a thing so ironic considering the topic we were talking about

1326
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:14,640
earlier, but from the heart, that's all I can say. And honestly, I have learned a lot from the

1327
02:04:14,640 --> 02:04:21,680
audience. I think that's something you guys need to keep in mind. I am so thankful that we have

1328
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:27,520
such a diverse group of people willing to waste three to four hours on a Sunday night to listen

1329
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:32,720
to this because I learned from you guys too. And that's an important part of this. So thank you.

1330
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:39,440
Number three. And lastly, today we at Anime Jam Session did a virtual convention. We did a 60

1331
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:44,960
minute version of our podcast. That went quite well. And for this, I pulled out my vog polo and

1332
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:49,840
wore it. I then realized how much I missed wearing that shirt at conventions. And I do look forward

1333
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:53,760
to the day when my whole staff can rock our vog polos at the next convention that is safe.

1334
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:59,120
Well, that's all on my mind for now. I must go seeing how I haven't had lunch yet and I'm

1335
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:04,880
starving. Take care, everyone. And I will see you all on the flip side, Ranma.

1336
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:10,240
I miss wearing the shirts to conventions too. Although I'm going to be honest, my polo has

1337
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:15,360
seen better days at this point. But that's why I'm sporting one of the new shirts. I bought two of

1338
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:21,200
these. Well, two different types. We have some different stuff over at vognetwork.com slash shop

1339
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:26,800
if you want to pick up a shirt. And when the convention- Which we still need V-neck ladies

1340
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:30,080
shirts. Get on me about that during the week and not during the middle of the live show and

1341
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:37,120
I'll go in there and add it. So all right. And we need more designs for shirts, so I'll trade you.

1342
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:43,680
All right. Well, I've been making music, so. I guess that works too. But anyway, yeah,

1343
02:05:43,680 --> 02:05:47,200
check out the shop and we'll be adding to that. And especially when the convention scene comes

1344
02:05:47,200 --> 02:05:52,960
back, we'll want people to have shirts they can wear and have our name on it because that's free

1345
02:05:52,960 --> 02:06:00,080
advertising for us. So thanks. Awesome. Next email. Next email. Thank you, Ranma, for that email.

1346
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:08,560
Hello, LR. Do we all miss going to conventions and festivals? Hey, this is Deja Vu. I sure do.

1347
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:13,120
And so do the folks who have been running the MAGFest Indie Video Game Showcase for over the

1348
02:06:13,120 --> 02:06:18,400
last several years. Now, under the new title, Indie Maker Syndicate, they're running their

1349
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:23,120
first virtual indie game showcase. It's called Maker's Play and it's taking place this weekend

1350
02:06:23,120 --> 02:06:28,400
from Friday, March 26th to Sunday, March 28th. I guess that's this upcoming weekend. Yeah,

1351
02:06:28,400 --> 02:06:32,560
this upcoming weekend. Yeah. Forty five games are being featured during this event, which will be

1352
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:37,520
taking place across Twitch and Discord. On the Discord server, each game has its own set of

1353
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:43,680
channels where you'll be able to chat with the developers, watch the games be streamed and even

1354
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:49,360
play them remotely using the Parsec app. On Twitch stream, you'll be able to watch special

1355
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:54,800
guest streamers try a selection of featured games. And if that wasn't enough, there's even a VR chat

1356
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:59,680
virtual expo hall featuring all of the developers games. You might be wondering why I'm bringing

1357
02:06:59,680 --> 02:07:04,400
this up. Well, it's because Super Multitasking will be one of the featured games. And to celebrate

1358
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:08,720
Super Multitasking is getting a free weekend on Steam. That's right. If you haven't yet taken the

1359
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:14,320
plunge, you'll be able to try the full game for free this weekend. And it'll be discounted 25%

1360
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:17,760
too if you want to pick it up. If you're interested in checking out Maker's Play,

1361
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:24,960
you can check yyrgames.com, the Super Multitasking page on Steam, the Vug Network Discord,

1362
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:31,440
or indymakerssyndicate.com for more information. I hope to see you all virtually next weekend.

1363
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:35,680
Thanks again for the show and have a great week. Keep on playing. Aaron, yyr.

1364
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:43,760
Aaron Congrats on that convention, yyr. That's a very clever way to do it in this day and age.

1365
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:51,120
So you know, obviously, I'm hopeful we can have a magfest by February. But I love this idea. It's

1366
02:07:51,120 --> 02:07:55,520
like a bandaid to kind of hold I'm sorry, but I guess it's I guess it's a January thing. The

1367
02:07:55,520 --> 02:08:02,880
February one was my favorite, though. Sorry. But the the fact that you have this whole virtual

1368
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:07,760
thing is pretty cool. So that sounds like a really clever way to do it. I like the idea of like,

1369
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:12,080
you go into the different Discord channels and you can actually play the game and talk with the

1370
02:08:12,080 --> 02:08:15,920
developer there. That's that's pretty rad. I love that. You guys thought that went through.

1371
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:23,120
And I'm all for Super Multitasking, getting more exposure. Good for you. All right.

1372
02:08:23,120 --> 02:08:24,320
We like exposure.

1373
02:08:25,280 --> 02:08:33,600
For sure. All right. Let's see. SJ 100 Matt in chat says most folks like the February magfest.

1374
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:38,560
Bobby Blackwell says except for magfest. Look, I actually and the January thing like it's the

1375
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:44,400
January thing is not a deal breaker for me. Like I think it was for Bobby. I'm open to coming back

1376
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:51,520
to magfest, especially now. The the upside of this pandemic. I mean, I have to look real hard to find

1377
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:57,040
one. But the upside is that I have a lot like I don't have the time off issues I had at my last

1378
02:08:57,040 --> 02:09:00,480
employer. I had to stop going to as many conventions because my last employer didn't

1379
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:05,760
give as much time off as I was used to at the job I was at for 14 years. So I was a job for 14 years.

1380
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:09,760
And having been there so long, I had a lot of time off to go out to a lot of conventions. I went to a

1381
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:14,880
new employer. They were fine. I have nothing bad to say about them. The only downside was that I

1382
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:18,000
because I was new, I didn't really have time off. I couldn't go to all the conventions I used to

1383
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:24,720
once I took my week for Dragon Con and only left me with so much. Now I'm at a third employer. And

1384
02:09:25,680 --> 02:09:31,120
the thing is with all this going on right now in the world, I'm not taking time off,

1385
02:09:31,120 --> 02:09:35,760
even though I probably should be. But I will not have those same issues I was having last employer.

1386
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:40,000
It's a little more generous in that department. So without giving away all, you know, I don't

1387
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:44,400
like to talk about my day job. You guys know I like to keep that separate. But like now it's

1388
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:48,720
just a money thing. Can I afford the flight out to DC? And, you know, I have to be mindful of

1389
02:09:48,720 --> 02:09:55,040
those sorts of things. But if the money is there, it's a possibility. So I don't want to promise yet.

1390
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:59,760
And obviously we have to see how COVID changes everything. But is going to MAGFest on the table?

1391
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:05,040
Yes. Going back to MAGFest is absolutely on the table. Even if I don't end up going to MAGFest,

1392
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:10,160
is going out to a different convention on the East Coast, such as New York Comic Con on the table?

1393
02:10:10,160 --> 02:10:18,320
Yes, absolutely. I'm going to be open to new and interesting ideas. What's that other one?

1394
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:24,800
Is it FlameCon? There's some LGBTQ thing in New York I've always wanted to go to. And that's

1395
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:33,680
going to be on the table for me as well. So we will see. All right. And Bobby Bockel says,

1396
02:10:33,680 --> 02:10:39,280
hell, I'm open to going to California to a con. Yeah. I mean, anything's possible. Oh,

1397
02:10:39,280 --> 02:10:43,280
like California Xtreme. Oh, that's a fun one. Next summer, you'd enjoy that.

1398
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:46,320
Yeah. I'm looking forward to California Xtreme returning.

1399
02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:50,720
Oh, Bobby, you should think about that. And the Golden State Pinball Expo,

1400
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:56,800
which we usually take our tables to. Because Bobby, if you come out here for California

1401
02:10:56,800 --> 02:11:03,280
Xtreme, we can do a day. Like, again, I'm daydreaming of a back to normal world. But,

1402
02:11:03,280 --> 02:11:08,720
you know, we can, you know, go to, I guess you've done a lot of the San Francisco stuff probably,

1403
02:11:08,720 --> 02:11:11,200
but there's probably other stuff up and down the Bay Area we can think of going

1404
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:15,040
and do that stuff. So it'd be fun. All right. And DJ Rama S says, yes,

1405
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:21,520
it's FlameCon is what I'm thinking of. Yes. So, all right. There was no other emails, right?

1406
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:23,200
That was it? That was it.

1407
02:11:23,200 --> 02:11:27,840
All right. Participate at orangelandrater.com if you have an email for a future week.

1408
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:32,480
I do want to open up, if you guys have any questions or comments in chat,

1409
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:36,080
things you want us to discuss, please make sure you get that out there in chat so we can

1410
02:11:36,080 --> 02:11:39,600
talk about that. If there's been something, I think I've missed it. So you might want to post

1411
02:11:39,600 --> 02:11:45,120
that again. Meanwhile, while we wait on that, Loki, do we have any last minute stories tonight?

1412
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:50,960
Just one thing I was going to mention. So we talked a few weeks ago how Microsoft was adding

1413
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:58,400
some FPS boosts to certain games to allow them to run at a higher frame rate. Well, because of the

1414
02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:04,400
recent acquisition of Bethesda titles, there were some Bethesda games that also got that treatment.

1415
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:08,960
So Dishonored Definitive Edition, Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Special Edition,

1416
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:18,160
Fallout 4, Fallout 76, and Prey are now part of that FPS boost program. So that's pretty awesome.

1417
02:12:19,360 --> 02:12:27,840
Looks like that most of those are going to be increasing from 30 to 60 FPS. So, cool.

1418
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:35,440
All right. And yeah, to clarify, because Bobby was like, I don't know if I would fly

1419
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:39,520
out to California this summer. No, no, I'm sorry. My frame of reference was 2022.

1420
02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:45,760
So yeah, I'm not, pretty much at this point, I'm not considering anything until 2022

1421
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:51,760
with the exception of Dragon Con, because I know they're only going to hold it if it's safe.

1422
02:12:52,160 --> 02:12:59,200
Um, and that's, that's that. So, um, yeah, Bobby says, I'm going to stick with road trips in late

1423
02:12:59,200 --> 02:13:04,000
2021. Then that's, that's fine. You know, we'll, we'll see how things change, but, um, just

1424
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:07,280
encourage those, you know, to get the vaccine. That's how we're going to, and, you know,

1425
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:12,160
when it comes to variants and things like that, well, one way to stop the virus from mutating

1426
02:13:12,160 --> 02:13:16,160
is to stop it from spreading. And you can do that through a vaccine and the vaccines have been

1427
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:20,720
pretty effective so far, it seems like against the variants, maybe even if not as effective,

1428
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:27,120
but even if a vaccine will stop you from being hospitalized, um, it's, it's probably

1429
02:13:27,120 --> 02:13:31,760
worth taking. So please look into that. All right. Um, I don't really see a lot of other

1430
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:36,720
topics in chat to talk about. So I think we are towards the end of the program tonight.

1431
02:13:36,720 --> 02:13:40,080
Um, I know it's a little early, but some weeks are faster than others. That's just the way it

1432
02:13:40,080 --> 02:13:44,240
goes sometimes. Uh, I want to thank you guys for listening to Orange Lawns Radio tonight and

1433
02:13:44,240 --> 02:13:47,680
spending some time with us here at the Voice of Geeks Network. If you enjoyed what you heard

1434
02:13:47,680 --> 02:13:52,080
here at Orange Lawns Radio, help us spread the word, uh, because we are the show where every

1435
02:13:52,080 --> 02:13:57,040
gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here to put out on air, then, uh, we don't have them.

1436
02:13:57,040 --> 02:14:03,360
So, um, uh, please help us spread the word. An auto host on Twitch goes a long way. I know I find

1437
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:07,360
a lot of new channels through what my friends are hosting. So, uh, please consider an auto host of

1438
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:10,960
VOG Network. That really, really helps us. And thank you for that. Um, I want to give a quick

1439
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:16,160
plug. Speaking of the VOG Network channel, Bobby Black Wolf is going to be live on Wednesday nights.

1440
02:14:16,240 --> 02:14:20,800
I know it moved. So Bobby, please correct me if I'm wrong, but Wednesday night, um, at OLR time.

1441
02:14:20,800 --> 02:14:26,320
So six Pacific, nine Eastern. Um, and he's going to be, uh, streaming, uh, the, the channel point

1442
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:30,960
rewards. You all raised the points for, uh, those of you that watch live, he's going to be doing

1443
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:37,600
his old VHS stream. So if you want to see like E3 in the Atlanta years, which was what, like 98,

1444
02:14:37,600 --> 02:14:43,200
uh, he's going to be doing that stuff, uh, live on Wednesday night. So that's going to be fun.

1445
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:49,360
Uh, so check that out. And that also means that starting next weekend,

1446
02:14:49,360 --> 02:14:54,400
we're going to open up the pool for the second VOG reward stream, which will be

1447
02:14:54,400 --> 02:15:00,240
that, uh, Shane's definitive Pokemon rankings. That will be the next one. Hey,

1448
02:15:00,240 --> 02:15:04,800
so here's a funny thing I want to talk about real quick. My, my kids were watching. Uh,

1449
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:10,320
they have a new Pokemon series that's on, um, Netflix. I guess it's something that they're

1450
02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:16,800
doing. And, um, I don't know which series it is. I don't remember, but they had a character named

1451
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:24,560
shame. Um, and he, he collected shinies and it immediately reminded me of Shane. I thought that

1452
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:30,080
was hilarious that they have a character that's all he's doing is collecting shinies. Well,

1453
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:36,080
obviously they listened to pokey stop podcasts. Clearly they did. It was just, it was pretty

1454
02:15:36,080 --> 02:15:41,280
funny. But, um, yeah, so that was just, I just saw that the other day when they were watching,

1455
02:15:41,280 --> 02:15:47,280
I was like, wait, that's totally Shane right there. So God, I wish he was listening right

1456
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:53,200
now. I'll have to send him this clip. All right. That's funny. Um, all right. So, um, I think,

1457
02:15:53,200 --> 02:15:57,680
I think that's it. Where was I was, I was in the middle of, uh, giving my, uh, uh, plugs here at

1458
02:15:57,680 --> 02:16:02,960
the end. Uh, Oh yes. I was going to say the store vog network.com. Sorry. His name was not Shane.

1459
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:05,760
His name is literally Shane. It's Shane seeker.

1460
02:16:08,240 --> 02:16:15,920
Hold on. He, he, he literally, um, he collects Pokemon, shiny Pokemon. So Shane seeker,

1461
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:24,320
did you know they put you in the Pokemon anime?

1462
02:16:26,320 --> 02:16:29,040
Okay. I just said it. I'll see what I get back. All right.

1463
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:34,640
Orange. Right. Put a link in the chat. Oh, that's, that's awfully convenient.

1464
02:16:36,960 --> 02:16:42,480
How about that? Oh, it looks nothing like him though. Right. I understand that. But the

1465
02:16:42,480 --> 02:16:50,000
character, I mean, it's just funny, Shane. And he also, you know, collects, uh, shiny Pokemon.

1466
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:54,960
I just thought it was quite the convenient or the coincidence that is quite, quite the coincidence.

1467
02:16:55,200 --> 02:17:00,080
That's quinky dinkle. All right. Uh, where was I and all the plugs? I don't know.

1468
02:17:00,080 --> 02:17:04,160
Thank you for listening and, uh, please continue to support the show. You all are wonderful for

1469
02:17:04,160 --> 02:17:08,320
being here every week. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Uh, let's go around and get everybody's

1470
02:17:08,320 --> 02:17:13,600
final thoughts. So, um, I'll start with my final thought. Cause I already kind of got into it

1471
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:19,200
earlier in the show, but, um, we all need to do our part to, um, stop, uh, the hate in our society

1472
02:17:19,200 --> 02:17:24,320
and, uh, ask yourself what you're going to do beyond a social media, uh, performative posts

1473
02:17:24,320 --> 02:17:28,720
and what you're really going to do to, um, you know, make things better in the world.

1474
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:32,560
Uh, that's my final thought. Uh, we'll go to Loki. Your final thought.

1475
02:17:33,680 --> 02:17:37,760
Uh, my final thought is I'm hoping to get a lot done on my game this week. So,

1476
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:44,080
um, I'll keep you updated. All right. Good luck. And last but not least star soccer,

1477
02:17:44,080 --> 02:17:49,280
your final thought. Nothing changes until you make it change. Reject false icons.

1478
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:54,960
Ooh, a classic. I've missed that one. All right. Have a wonderful week. Everybody

1479
02:17:54,960 --> 02:18:00,320
we'll see you in seven days for another March episode. Eight 62. Happy gaming.

1480
02:18:00,960 --> 02:18:07,040
We'll see you next week. Bye everyone. You've been listening to orange lounge radio. Orange
