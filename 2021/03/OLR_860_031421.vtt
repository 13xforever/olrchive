2013's Future of Entertainment is 2000 and dead!

00:13.420 --> 00:16.980
And in a fun coincidence, when I was plugging my Xbox One back in recently, I accidentally

00:16.980 --> 00:20.980
plugged the HDMI cable into the port that is meant for cable or satellite input rather

00:20.980 --> 00:22.180
than TV output.

00:22.180 --> 00:25.320
Imagine my amusement when I figured out and fixed that, the next thing I see is that that

00:25.320 --> 00:29.520
port is no longer functional on my and all other pre-Xbox One S units.

00:29.520 --> 00:33.240
This is just one story, join your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers and Loki for more on

00:33.240 --> 00:36.040
this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every

00:36.040 --> 00:37.040
gamer has a voice

00:37.040 --> 00:46.200
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back, it is another week of the show

00:46.200 --> 00:52.220
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio back with you once again here on Pi

00:52.220 --> 00:53.220
Day!

00:53.220 --> 00:59.900
Hurray it's Pi Day, March the 14th of 2021 with episode number 860 of our show.

00:59.900 --> 01:06.020
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to, first off, DarkSakura or Jamie

01:06.020 --> 01:07.020
Sommers.

01:07.020 --> 01:08.020
Greetings.

01:08.020 --> 01:09.020
Hi, how are you doing?

01:09.020 --> 01:17.340
Doing okay, I thought I had massively overslept and then I remembered the thing, so.

01:17.340 --> 01:20.700
Oh yes, that little show that we have on Sundays.

01:20.700 --> 01:21.700
No, no, no.

01:22.260 --> 01:27.540
I thought that I forgot about Daylight Savings and so I thought I had overslept and then

01:27.540 --> 01:30.500
I actually quite literally remembered it 10 minutes ago.

01:30.500 --> 01:35.740
Oh my gosh, okay, yes, yes, Daylight Savings, yeah, that was the thing that happened yesterday

01:35.740 --> 01:37.820
too, yeah, for sure.

01:37.820 --> 01:43.340
Well happy Pi Day, have you been able to celebrate with any Pi despite your nap?

01:43.340 --> 01:48.260
I have Pi waiting for me in the other room, husband went by Sherry's for me to get me

01:48.260 --> 01:51.500
my favorite strawberry rhubarb pie.

01:51.500 --> 01:58.660
Oh, yummy, look, I know I get labeled with the pumpkin thing a lot because, you know,

01:58.660 --> 02:03.620
I do really like the pumpkin flavored things, so of course I like pumpkin pie, but when

02:03.620 --> 02:09.100
it comes to pie, I like a lot of, like, I love lemon meringue pie, I like key lime pie,

02:09.100 --> 02:12.020
I like apple pie, and I like strawberry rhubarb pie.

02:12.020 --> 02:16.820
There's lots of pie, I can't really think of a bad pie come to think of it.

02:16.820 --> 02:18.900
I'm not sure there's a pie I can think of that's really bad.

02:18.940 --> 02:24.420
I'm sure somebody could invent one or something, and don't be like, oh, oh, the pie that, you

02:24.420 --> 02:28.500
know, the lady baked poo into and all that doesn't count, you know what I mean, like

02:28.500 --> 02:31.380
an actual pie, it's something I can order at Marine Calendars.

02:31.380 --> 02:34.700
Yeah, there's something I can order at Marine Calendars, I don't think there's a pie on

02:34.700 --> 02:37.380
that menu I dislike, so there's that.

02:37.380 --> 02:38.380
Anyway.

02:38.380 --> 02:40.380
I like meat pies.

02:40.380 --> 02:44.340
Oh, like a savory pie, I guess.

02:44.340 --> 02:45.340
Exactly.

02:45.780 --> 02:48.540
Our favorite little restaurant does those.

02:48.540 --> 02:49.540
They're pretty good.

02:49.540 --> 02:50.540
Touch of Britain.

02:50.540 --> 02:53.700
Oh, I wasn't thinking of Touch of Britain, I was thinking of Petey Kitchen.

02:53.700 --> 02:57.340
Well, yeah, Petey Kitchen does those, but those are more like a hand pie, and I was

02:57.340 --> 03:04.900
thinking of like, you know, like a steak and kidney pie or, you know, something like that.

03:04.900 --> 03:07.780
I don't know if I'd eat a steak and kidney pie.

03:07.780 --> 03:10.060
Well, there's different kinds.

03:10.060 --> 03:14.100
I like a steak and kidney pie, I think they're delightful, but yeah.

03:14.860 --> 03:17.060
Alright, well, heading over to Techmaster Loki.

03:17.060 --> 03:18.060
Hey, Loki.

03:18.060 --> 03:19.060
Hey.

03:19.060 --> 03:22.900
Would you eat a steak and kidney pie?

03:22.900 --> 03:24.900
Like kidney beans?

03:24.900 --> 03:26.900
No, kidneys.

03:26.900 --> 03:28.860
Kidney, kidney.

03:28.860 --> 03:33.140
Probably more likely than if it was kidney beans, I really like beans.

03:33.140 --> 03:34.140
Sounds a little more manageable.

03:34.140 --> 03:38.940
It's really just a different texture of meat.

03:38.940 --> 03:41.820
Have you had any pie today, Loki, to celebrate?

03:42.060 --> 03:47.020
No, the closest I had was I went to Roundtable and got breadsticks, but they were doing a

03:47.020 --> 03:52.780
special for Pi Day, so they have like pizza pie for like $3.14 or something.

03:52.780 --> 03:53.780
Perfect.

03:53.780 --> 03:54.780
But that's about it.

03:54.780 --> 03:57.620
I have pie in Animal Crossing that has a pie on it.

03:57.620 --> 03:59.420
Do they do a pie event in Animal Crossing?

03:59.420 --> 04:01.260
Yeah, you can get the pie meal.

04:01.260 --> 04:04.820
You should order, Rob, you need to look in tonight to get your pie before it's gone.

04:04.820 --> 04:06.380
I should, you're right.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.380
For pie.

04:07.380 --> 04:08.380
And all the Super Mario stuff.

04:08.380 --> 04:11.380
For pie, I will look in, I will go into Animal Crossing.

04:11.940 --> 04:16.140
And the Super Mario stuff, Rob.

04:16.140 --> 04:20.980
And the Sanrio stuff is going to be, I think, available to start using tomorrow.

04:20.980 --> 04:21.980
That's really cool, too.

04:21.980 --> 04:22.980
Yay.

04:22.980 --> 04:23.980
Awesome.

04:23.980 --> 04:27.900
Well, it gives me reasons to look at Animal Crossing, that's for sure.

04:27.900 --> 04:31.220
So before we get into our kickoff topic, I've had an interesting weekend.

04:31.220 --> 04:36.380
Let me tell you, I've had very high highs and I've had very low lows.

04:36.380 --> 04:40.940
So yesterday I get an email asking if I want to get the COVID vaccine.

04:40.940 --> 04:42.900
And I'm like, fuck yeah, I do.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.300
Like, let's do it.

04:44.300 --> 04:45.300
Let's get to it.

04:45.300 --> 04:46.300
Where?

04:46.300 --> 04:47.300
When?

04:47.300 --> 04:48.300
Which brand?

04:48.300 --> 04:49.300
I don't give a fuck.

04:49.300 --> 04:50.300
Just give me the vaccine.

04:50.300 --> 04:52.440
Let's let's get some sense of normalcy.

04:52.440 --> 04:54.980
So I actually I went and I got that done today.

04:54.980 --> 04:57.620
So I had my first shot today.

04:57.620 --> 05:01.620
And I'm sure people are wondering, how did I get the vaccine here?

05:01.620 --> 05:07.780
I do want to stress this question, especially as we move into that phase of a lot of people

05:07.780 --> 05:10.780
are going to you're going to see start getting the shot because of prior existing medical

05:10.780 --> 05:11.980
conditions and things like that.

05:11.980 --> 05:15.420
I do want to stress that generally this question is none of your fucking business.

05:15.420 --> 05:18.540
And I think that's important when it comes to social media, like how someone got the

05:18.540 --> 05:19.540
vaccine.

05:19.540 --> 05:24.700
Well, HIPAA is kind of overused, I think sometimes because HIPAA really only applies to insurers

05:24.700 --> 05:25.700
and health care entities.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.140
It doesn't apply to the press or people.

05:28.140 --> 05:34.180
Except that the places that you're getting vaccinated can't ask you about how you qualify

05:34.180 --> 05:36.180
due to HIPAA.

05:36.180 --> 05:37.180
I believe.

05:37.180 --> 05:40.180
Yeah, I think going to the pharmacies, they cannot ask you.

05:40.180 --> 05:41.180
Right.

05:41.180 --> 05:42.180
So.

05:42.180 --> 05:47.780
So anyway, but I will happily talk about it because we've had this show on for so long.

05:47.780 --> 05:51.660
Some of our listeners, not a lot, but some of our listeners may remember when this happened.

05:51.660 --> 05:56.740
Do you all remember when I was hospitalized back in 2008 and I was out of the show for

05:56.740 --> 05:58.980
I feel like I was out of the show for almost a month.

05:58.980 --> 05:59.980
It was it was a little bit.

05:59.980 --> 06:01.380
I was in the hospital for a couple of weeks.

06:01.380 --> 06:03.700
Well, I was in the hospital for like four days.

06:03.700 --> 06:07.340
And I remember you're eating nothing but bread, which I don't even think I was supposed to

06:07.340 --> 06:08.340
be having.

06:08.340 --> 06:10.900
But anyway, I ended up having my gallbladder out.

06:10.900 --> 06:13.940
So long story short, I had a condition called pancreatitis.

06:13.940 --> 06:17.180
That's what it put me in the hospital and it was caused by my gallbladder.

06:17.180 --> 06:21.180
So that puts on my medical record that I've had a history of pancreatitis because they

06:21.180 --> 06:23.900
never really know if it's going to come back.

06:24.060 --> 06:27.140
Thankfully, knock on wood, it's never come back.

06:27.140 --> 06:31.420
But my understanding from talking to some friends who are really into science is that

06:31.420 --> 06:35.700
if you get covid and you have pancreatitis at the same time, guess what?

06:35.700 --> 06:38.560
Your mortality rate shoots up to 15 percent.

06:38.560 --> 06:43.300
So I'm pretty sure because that was in my medical record that I'd had that before.

06:43.300 --> 06:47.020
That's why, as California is opening up to people with medical conditions, I was able

06:47.020 --> 06:48.820
to get the vaccine.

06:48.820 --> 06:55.220
So I went today and again, I would encourage if you're eligible for vaccine, get it no

06:55.220 --> 06:56.940
matter which one it is.

06:56.940 --> 06:58.380
I did get Moderna.

06:58.380 --> 07:00.820
I would have happily taken any of them.

07:00.820 --> 07:05.260
But something about getting the Dolly Parton vaccine does feel very correct.

07:05.260 --> 07:07.300
And I'm totally good with that.

07:07.300 --> 07:11.600
But obviously, whichever one they would have offered, I would have happily taken.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.340
And so I'm sure people are wondering, how are you feeling?

07:14.340 --> 07:15.340
I feel fine.

07:15.340 --> 07:17.580
My arm is a little sore.

07:17.580 --> 07:19.340
I would just compare it to a flu shot.

07:19.340 --> 07:21.900
Right now, everything I'm feeling is very similar to the flu shot.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.100
The arm is a little sore.

07:23.100 --> 07:28.940
I feel like a little bit of like, but it's not enough to stop me from doing this show.

07:28.940 --> 07:30.740
I don't know how the second dose is going to go.

07:30.740 --> 07:33.460
I hear that's the one that'll really kick your butt.

07:33.460 --> 07:37.200
But at the end of the day, it's better than actually getting covid.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.140
So there is that.

07:39.140 --> 07:42.420
Now, one other thing I want to say about my weekend.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.340
So yes, the covid vax happened.

07:44.340 --> 07:48.020
I'm thrilled about that, that, you know, I'm starting down that road and hopefully it's

07:48.020 --> 07:49.500
more and more my friends get it.

07:49.500 --> 07:53.940
You know, I'm sure dark soccer, Loki are going to end up getting it in hopefully a matter

07:53.940 --> 07:54.940
of weeks.

07:54.940 --> 07:55.940
Right.

07:55.940 --> 08:00.220
The president said May 1st as a you can schedule your appointment at least by then.

08:00.220 --> 08:01.260
So fingers crossed.

08:01.260 --> 08:05.820
And based on what I saw today, how fast they were moving people through at the state fairgrounds

08:05.820 --> 08:07.780
like I it could happen.

08:07.780 --> 08:08.780
We'll see.

08:08.780 --> 08:09.780
We'll see.

08:09.780 --> 08:10.780
There's lots going to happen over the next few weeks.

08:10.780 --> 08:14.260
But hopefully it puts us on a path back to normalcy where like maybe we can all be in

08:14.260 --> 08:19.580
the same room again and do this show in person like we did for 18 years or however long it

08:19.580 --> 08:21.980
was until this pandemic started.

08:21.980 --> 08:26.020
Pretty much a year ago at this point is when the first will need to tell us.

08:26.020 --> 08:27.020
Yeah.

08:27.020 --> 08:28.020
Yeah.

08:28.020 --> 08:32.160
I know we're going to go back to using our old mics after this one, we'll have to figure

08:32.160 --> 08:33.160
all that out.

08:33.160 --> 08:34.160
So.

08:34.160 --> 08:35.160
So we'll see.

08:35.160 --> 08:40.100
And I also want to acknowledge the chat room because I see they started another hype train

08:40.100 --> 08:42.220
while I was talking about the vaccine.

08:42.220 --> 08:44.500
So thank you guys very much for that.

08:44.500 --> 08:47.180
Over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

08:47.180 --> 08:48.380
You guys are very generous.

08:48.380 --> 08:52.320
I'll read everybody out individually as I usually do at the end of the show after we're

08:52.320 --> 08:53.620
done being live tonight.

08:53.620 --> 08:57.220
But you know, when you guys when you guys really, really go as far as like to start

08:57.220 --> 08:59.140
a train, I kind of have to acknowledge that.

08:59.140 --> 09:02.620
But of course, yes, we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine

09:02.620 --> 09:07.620
o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network right after the

09:07.620 --> 09:09.220
Bobby Black Wolf show.

09:09.220 --> 09:10.900
So my weekend I said it was interesting.

09:10.900 --> 09:15.500
Yes, the covid vaccine part was interesting, but you know what else happened on Saturday?

09:15.500 --> 09:21.280
So I was driving downtown because my plan was to play some Pokemon Go down at Capitol

09:21.280 --> 09:25.780
Park or in that area because I still had a quest I needed to finish and Pokemon Go to

09:25.780 --> 09:28.860
get like forty five steel types to finish that whole thing up.

09:28.860 --> 09:33.780
Well, while I'm driving downtown and I'm going through the downtown streets, I got no car

09:33.780 --> 09:34.780
accident.

09:34.780 --> 09:35.780
Yep.

09:35.780 --> 09:36.780
Somebody hit my car.

09:36.780 --> 09:37.780
Yep.

09:38.180 --> 09:43.420
It was I was in the far left lane and she was in the lane right next to me.

09:43.420 --> 09:47.200
She thought I had to turn it was because, you know, how like downtown is full of one

09:47.200 --> 09:49.660
way streets and, you know, weird.

09:49.660 --> 09:53.000
So she thought it was one of those streets where I had to turn and she wanted to turn.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.940
So she turned right into my car.

09:55.940 --> 09:57.740
I'm fine.

09:57.740 --> 09:59.440
You know, it was thankfully it was low speed.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.000
It was coming out of a stop sign.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.060
My car, my passenger side door, on the other hand, yikes.

10:05.060 --> 10:09.260
So luckily, you know, it's a crappy situation.

10:09.260 --> 10:12.180
But she and thankfully it was kind of one of those things.

10:12.180 --> 10:13.920
She realized she was at fault.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.940
She didn't try to play any funny games.

10:15.940 --> 10:17.500
She was very apologetic.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.340
You know, I'm sorry that this happened.

10:19.340 --> 10:22.300
And, you know, and I'm sorry you are inconvenienced.

10:22.300 --> 10:27.740
But since I was riding this high from I get to get the covid shot tomorrow, I was like,

10:27.740 --> 10:29.740
it's all these things happen.

10:29.740 --> 10:30.740
Don't worry about it.

10:30.740 --> 10:33.060
You know, like I must you didn't get her insurance.

10:33.060 --> 10:34.060
Oh, no, I did.

10:34.060 --> 10:35.060
Oh, no.

10:35.060 --> 10:36.060
We took care of all that.

10:36.060 --> 10:37.060
Yeah.

10:37.060 --> 10:38.060
No.

10:38.060 --> 10:39.060
Her insurance people called me yesterday.

10:39.060 --> 10:40.060
No, no, no.

10:40.060 --> 10:42.140
I just mean like as she was stressing out, I was just like, you know, it's don't stress

10:42.140 --> 10:43.140
out.

10:43.140 --> 10:44.140
It's OK.

10:44.140 --> 10:45.140
You know, I'm fine.

10:45.140 --> 10:46.140
None of us are injured.

10:46.140 --> 10:47.260
That's the important part.

10:47.260 --> 10:50.860
You know, and I'm like, honestly, I was she probably was thinking like, who the fuck is

10:50.860 --> 10:51.860
this guy?

10:51.860 --> 10:53.300
Why is he so nice?

10:53.300 --> 10:56.580
But it's because I got like the best news ever that morning.

10:56.580 --> 11:00.380
It's like if I if you're going to choose a day to hit my car, that was the day to do

11:00.380 --> 11:01.380
it, honestly.

11:01.380 --> 11:03.760
But yes, no, we got it was all good.

11:03.760 --> 11:07.320
Her insurance people called me last night and they were like, yep, we're going to accept

11:07.320 --> 11:08.680
full liability on this.

11:08.680 --> 11:10.400
And they set me up at the car place tomorrow.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.560
It is an inconvenience.

11:11.560 --> 11:17.280
I'm not happy about it, but something about the whole like covid situation, everything

11:17.280 --> 11:22.480
I think puts a lot of things in perspective where I'm like, OK, she made a mistake and

11:22.480 --> 11:26.020
she hit my car like shit happens.

11:26.020 --> 11:30.700
And honest, honestly, with things like that, it's more like it's done.

11:30.700 --> 11:31.700
What can you do?

11:31.700 --> 11:33.420
Yeah, I think it's that, too.

11:33.420 --> 11:36.300
It's like, am I going to scream at her?

11:36.300 --> 11:38.860
What literally what will that accomplish?

11:38.860 --> 11:40.460
What's that going to accomplish?

11:40.460 --> 11:46.180
Like I see I see a girl who's freaked out because she knows she caused this situation.

11:46.180 --> 11:49.300
And you know, you know, when you're the one that causes causes that you're running through

11:49.300 --> 11:50.300
your head.

11:50.300 --> 11:51.300
Oh, my God.

11:51.300 --> 11:52.300
Is this going to be a neck injury thing?

11:52.300 --> 11:54.020
Is this guy going to sue me for everything I have and all this stuff?

11:54.020 --> 11:56.300
You can tell she's going through like all that stress.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.060
Like I can tell just by looking at her.

11:58.060 --> 12:00.220
So her insurance is about to suck.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.140
Well, yeah, that part.

12:02.140 --> 12:04.780
And you know, she had one of those cars with paper plates.

12:04.780 --> 12:07.780
So I know it was probably a new to her car.

12:07.780 --> 12:14.740
So that that sucks, like, you know, but again, like, what is it going to help if I'm just

12:14.740 --> 12:16.860
like screaming at her going, how could you?

12:16.860 --> 12:17.860
My day is ruined.

12:17.860 --> 12:21.900
I am a I am an I'm an inconvenienced middle aged man.

12:21.900 --> 12:25.820
Like it's just like what's well, what's funny?

12:25.820 --> 12:31.720
I was reading a Vice article that's been making the rounds about how people are basically

12:32.300 --> 12:33.520
just being assholes lately.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.520
Oh, yeah.

12:34.520 --> 12:41.320
But a lot of it is having to do to, you know, carrying the stress of the political situation,

12:41.320 --> 12:43.440
the pandemic situation, all of this.

12:43.440 --> 12:46.400
And we're just grumpy in general.

12:46.400 --> 12:52.640
And the fact that you would turn it around and actually try to make somebody else.

12:52.640 --> 12:57.760
I guess, center centered a little bit better, you know, that's a good thing.

12:57.760 --> 13:01.400
We need more people showing just those little acts of kindness every day.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.080
And I want to be clear.

13:03.080 --> 13:06.440
I'm not telling this story to brag about what a good person I am, because I'm going to be

13:06.440 --> 13:07.440
completely honest.

13:07.440 --> 13:08.440
Yeah.

13:08.440 --> 13:09.440
No, no.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.440
I'm going to be completely honest with you.

13:10.440 --> 13:14.640
If I had not been if I had not been writing the high of the vaccine news, I don't think

13:14.640 --> 13:21.640
I would have been rude, but I think there would have been a lot more of that.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.680
You know, I think there would have been a lot more of that, right?

13:23.680 --> 13:27.840
Like, I just don't think I probably wouldn't have been like I probably just would have

13:27.840 --> 13:29.360
been a lot more like quiet.

13:29.360 --> 13:34.180
I think is probably my more nature is just like, all right, what's your insurance mo?

13:34.180 --> 13:35.520
You know, like that whole thing.

13:35.520 --> 13:36.800
So yeah, I'm not telling that story.

13:36.800 --> 13:39.760
If you see, you can all like, you know, gas me up and like, tell me what a great person

13:39.760 --> 13:40.760
I am.

13:40.760 --> 13:41.760
It's not about it.

13:41.760 --> 13:45.480
But it definitely was something about the timing of everything like that, paired with

13:45.480 --> 13:49.800
the great news of the vaccine stuff kind of just put a lot in perspective where it's like,

13:49.800 --> 13:50.960
you know what?

13:50.960 --> 13:52.680
I'm lucky to get this.

13:52.680 --> 13:54.520
I'm unlucky to get this.

13:54.520 --> 13:56.480
The universe works in weird ways.

13:57.120 --> 14:02.680
Yeah, anyway, it is it is a podcast about video games, but I thought that was an interesting

14:02.680 --> 14:04.840
life update y'all might enjoy.

14:04.840 --> 14:06.100
And I did want to encourage you know what?

14:06.100 --> 14:07.720
We have a platform.

14:07.720 --> 14:09.320
It's a tiny platform.

14:09.320 --> 14:14.080
It's like a little plank of wood that it's a it's a literal cardboard box that if somebody

14:14.080 --> 14:16.360
too heavy stands on it, it will collapse.

14:16.360 --> 14:18.660
But we do have a platform.

14:18.660 --> 14:22.840
And if I can use this platform to encourage people, get the vaccine.

14:22.840 --> 14:23.840
It's fine.

14:23.840 --> 14:24.840
It's safe.

14:24.840 --> 14:26.560
It's connected on lots of people.

14:26.560 --> 14:30.320
There are lots of medical journals and medical science behind it.

14:30.320 --> 14:36.760
So if you're like on the fence, like I'm not sure Bill Gates microchip, like, just please

14:36.760 --> 14:38.600
do a little research into it.

14:38.600 --> 14:42.160
And I think you're going to find it's it's fine.

14:42.160 --> 14:43.160
It's fine.

14:43.160 --> 14:47.320
Yes, there will be side effects, but they're they're 10 times better than actually getting

14:47.320 --> 14:48.320
COVID.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.320
I guarantee it.

14:49.320 --> 14:58.480
Well, and now they're actually showing that people are getting long COVID in higher numbers,

14:58.480 --> 15:02.240
which is basically you're over the virus, but you're left with the symptoms.

15:02.240 --> 15:03.240
Right.

15:03.240 --> 15:04.560
Well, Shane got into that a little bit last week.

15:04.560 --> 15:06.200
You weren't you weren't here last week.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.200
Was it last week or two?

15:07.200 --> 15:08.200
I can't even.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.200
It was last week.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.200
What is time?

15:10.200 --> 15:11.200
And he was talking a little bit.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.680
We had him on at the beginning because I think there was Pokemon news or something.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.880
I don't even know anymore.

15:14.880 --> 15:15.880
What is time?

15:16.360 --> 15:19.840
And but I know he was talking a little bit about that because he was wearing a mask on

15:19.840 --> 15:23.640
stream even though he was in his house and it actually for him, it's helping with breathing

15:23.640 --> 15:24.640
and all that.

15:24.640 --> 15:32.000
So, you know, again, if you if you think COVID is fake, like I've literally had somebody

15:32.000 --> 15:39.760
on this show to your way out of ever talking again, just or just like do a little research.

15:39.760 --> 15:41.120
Go look somewhere.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.880
It's not you're doing the research, Rob.

15:43.880 --> 15:46.040
They saw it all on the Internet and it must be true.

15:46.040 --> 15:49.760
Well, that's why I'm saying you need to do your research somewhere else, you know.

15:49.760 --> 15:50.760
And anyway.

15:50.760 --> 15:53.960
Well, even so, last week I was doing Gish.

15:53.960 --> 15:54.960
So to.

15:54.960 --> 15:55.960
All right.

15:55.960 --> 15:56.960
Lizzo on the Grammys.

15:56.960 --> 15:57.960
Bitch, I'm back.

15:57.960 --> 15:58.960
Well, welcome back.

15:58.960 --> 15:59.960
Welcome.

15:59.960 --> 16:00.960
I love her.

16:00.960 --> 16:01.960
It didn't.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.980
But the nice thing is because you had the classic game of the week, we didn't totally

16:04.980 --> 16:05.980
miss you.

16:05.980 --> 16:06.980
You know what I mean?

16:06.980 --> 16:08.400
Like, we still got a little bit of Jamie's.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.580
No, you know, we love you.

16:09.580 --> 16:10.580
We do.

16:10.580 --> 16:11.580
We do.

16:11.580 --> 16:12.580
Yeah.

16:12.660 --> 16:16.580
Some folks in chat talking about Zanderouz and chat over twitch dot TV slash Vogue Network

16:16.580 --> 16:19.780
says most of us already have the microchip anyway.

16:19.780 --> 16:20.780
You got to.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.620
I think the microchip thing has become a bit of a meme.

16:22.620 --> 16:26.220
But I know there are a few people that believe it, but it's crazy to me that they will post

16:26.220 --> 16:31.340
to Facebook about it and tweet about it from their device that literally tracks their location

16:31.340 --> 16:35.520
everywhere they go smart as I hold up my Apple Watch.

16:35.520 --> 16:37.340
It's just it's just ridiculous.

16:37.340 --> 16:38.340
All right.

16:39.100 --> 16:44.180
Look, I promised gaming just because we're talking about microchips doesn't mean we're

16:44.180 --> 16:45.580
in gaming news.

16:45.580 --> 16:47.980
Let's actually talk about what's going on in gaming.

16:47.980 --> 16:51.960
Loki, why don't you start us off with our kickoff topic tonight?

16:51.960 --> 16:57.360
So Bethesda, of course, we know that they're purchasing or I'm sorry, Microsoft's purchasing

16:57.360 --> 16:58.360
Bethesda.

16:58.360 --> 17:01.280
I kind of was wondering where we were on that.

17:01.280 --> 17:08.060
But apparently it was just down to the European Union's basically giving it the OK.

17:08.420 --> 17:14.660
And now that that's been kind of allowed to happen, they've completed their purchase of

17:14.660 --> 17:15.960
Bethesda.

17:15.960 --> 17:20.220
So along with that, we had some more clarifications on things.

17:20.220 --> 17:26.900
So, for example, as we kind of expected that some future Bethesda games will be exclusive

17:26.900 --> 17:28.540
to Xbox and PC.

17:28.540 --> 17:33.940
I mean, after all, you don't pay seven point five billion dollars to just have your games

17:33.940 --> 17:34.940
everywhere.

17:35.700 --> 17:38.540
But I mean, we'll see like what that means.

17:38.540 --> 17:43.020
I think what they were talking about, though, it says with the addition of Bethesda teams,

17:43.020 --> 17:48.220
gamers should know that Xbox consoles, PC and Game Pass will be the best place experience

17:48.220 --> 17:49.780
to do Bethesda games.

17:49.780 --> 17:55.220
Now, I'm wondering if they mean by games pass that they're looking to like, say, hey, look

17:55.220 --> 17:57.060
at these games we have.

17:57.060 --> 17:58.660
You know, you want to put them on your console.

17:58.660 --> 18:03.140
Well, you can offer game pass kind of like how EA has EA play.

18:03.140 --> 18:05.740
So that services on multiple consoles.

18:05.740 --> 18:07.060
Why not game pass?

18:07.060 --> 18:10.900
You know, so that may be something that they're trying to sweeten the pot there with that

18:10.900 --> 18:13.940
to try to entice them to be able to bring it on.

18:13.940 --> 18:16.900
But in the meantime, speaking of game pass, you know, if you are interested in playing

18:16.900 --> 18:19.380
some Bethesda game, they added 20 more on there.

18:19.380 --> 18:21.860
All all of your favorites are in there.

18:21.860 --> 18:27.060
So well, Doom 2016 is missing, just to be clear.

18:27.060 --> 18:28.420
So they're not not all there.

18:28.420 --> 18:30.740
But yes, a good chunk made.

18:30.740 --> 18:34.900
I don't want to poopoo the news because there are like I wasn't expecting Morrowind all

18:34.900 --> 18:36.940
the way from classic Xbox to show up.

18:36.940 --> 18:40.920
So there is some interesting picks that showed up in there.

18:40.920 --> 18:41.920
Or Doom 64.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.760
Who's really like dying to play Doom 64?

18:44.760 --> 18:45.760
Fuck you.

18:45.760 --> 18:46.760
I played it this week.

18:46.760 --> 18:48.740
That was the first one I watched.

18:48.740 --> 18:50.900
Why are you kidding?

18:50.900 --> 18:54.440
Because because it actually looks pretty good.

18:54.440 --> 18:57.360
Like it doesn't look like it because they up rezzed it or something.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.540
They made the modern tweaks to it.

18:59.540 --> 19:03.860
It looks good because you like I because of reasons.

19:03.860 --> 19:08.900
I played it for like five minutes, you know, when I was in college or something and a friend

19:08.900 --> 19:13.140
had Doom 64 and it was one of those I wanted to revisit it and see.

19:13.140 --> 19:15.980
Like in my mind, I was like, was this like the original Doom?

19:15.980 --> 19:16.980
Was it important?

19:16.980 --> 19:20.020
And the nice thing about game pass, Loki, is that I can do that.

19:20.020 --> 19:22.900
I can just like as long as, you know, I have the bandwidth or whatever.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.180
But Doom 64 is a pretty small game.

19:25.180 --> 19:28.620
So I just downloaded it just to be like, huh, I want to see I want to remember what this

19:28.620 --> 19:29.620
is like.

19:29.620 --> 19:33.180
I was and I, I played through the first level I and I enjoyed myself.

19:33.180 --> 19:35.780
I didn't think it was terrible.

19:35.780 --> 19:40.460
But you know, it's just it's in that same era of Doom one and Doom two.

19:40.460 --> 19:44.580
And graphically, those games, you know, they're showing their age, but they're obviously there.

19:44.580 --> 19:49.500
We wouldn't have the games we have today if it weren't for the legacy of those Doom games.

19:49.500 --> 19:53.700
Anyway, sorry, I'm getting off track, but I had to justify to Loki why I was playing

19:53.700 --> 19:54.700
Doom 64.

19:54.700 --> 19:55.700
Fine.

19:55.700 --> 19:56.700
I don't know.

19:56.780 --> 19:57.780
I don't know.

19:57.780 --> 20:02.620
Like it for me, it'd be like, hey, you like I know that Duke Nukem is not a Bethesda game,

20:02.620 --> 20:06.780
but it'd be like, hey, you can play Duke Nukem 3D or you can play Duke Nukem 3D that appeared

20:06.780 --> 20:08.660
on the Nintendo 64.

20:08.660 --> 20:10.340
Not picking the Nintendo 64 version.

20:10.340 --> 20:12.220
I'll take the original, please.

20:12.220 --> 20:17.060
Well, remember the 60 Doom 64 has unique monsters, levels.

20:17.060 --> 20:18.060
It's a different game.

20:18.060 --> 20:20.620
It's not the same as when I guess I get that.

20:20.620 --> 20:21.620
Yeah.

20:21.620 --> 20:22.620
Yeah.

20:22.620 --> 20:23.620
So I guess that makes sense.

20:23.620 --> 20:24.620
And who cares?

20:24.620 --> 20:25.620
It's free or free with your right.

20:25.620 --> 20:26.620
Exactly.

20:27.540 --> 20:28.540
It's quote free.

20:28.540 --> 20:30.540
It's free like PlayStation Plus free games and all that.

20:30.540 --> 20:31.540
Yeah, exactly.

20:31.540 --> 20:32.540
Yeah.

20:32.540 --> 20:33.540
All right.

20:33.540 --> 20:34.540
So that's yeah.

20:34.540 --> 20:37.860
It's kind of nice that we have the news that they have officially come together and how

20:37.860 --> 20:39.500
fast that moved.

20:39.500 --> 20:44.140
Like once that EU announcement came in, you know, we had the game pass additions within

20:44.140 --> 20:45.860
probably 72 hours.

20:45.860 --> 20:48.340
But I think it's also interesting that we had that.

20:48.340 --> 20:51.260
I don't know what you'd call it, that interesting live stream.

20:51.260 --> 20:55.820
I wouldn't call it a press event or what it was like a weird fireside chat where they

20:55.820 --> 21:00.420
were talking about, you know, a lot of these things and talking about the exclusive, you

21:00.420 --> 21:06.340
know, kind of confirming that there are going to be some games that will be exclusive to

21:06.340 --> 21:07.800
Xbox and PC.

21:07.800 --> 21:12.400
So what do you guys think about that exclusive side of things?

21:12.400 --> 21:17.700
Do you think that is confirmation of sorts that things like Starfield and Elder Scrolls

21:17.700 --> 21:21.700
6, like don't expect them on PlayStation or what do you think is going to happen with

21:21.700 --> 21:22.700
that?

21:22.700 --> 21:26.500
I think it's don't expect it on PlayStation immediately.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.180
Okay.

21:28.180 --> 21:34.400
I think that they're going to work out some bit of exclusivity because they can and then

21:34.400 --> 21:38.940
open it up to everybody else because they're not going to say, oh, we don't want money.

21:38.940 --> 21:39.940
Yeah.

21:39.940 --> 21:40.940
You know?

21:40.940 --> 21:41.940
Yeah.

21:41.940 --> 21:47.620
And I could see and from my perspective, I could see Elder Scrolls 6 going to PlayStation.

21:47.620 --> 21:48.980
I could see it.

21:48.980 --> 21:52.860
But even if it does, it's not going to be the version that you want.

21:52.860 --> 21:53.860
Like full stop.

21:53.860 --> 21:58.780
Like the best version will be the Microsoft and Windows Store version or PC, whatever

21:58.780 --> 22:04.260
trust that is going to be the version you want, even if it comes in less.

22:04.260 --> 22:06.140
They somehow get it on the switch.

22:06.140 --> 22:10.300
Maybe there's a switch pro or something and you must have handheld, but that's an exception.

22:10.300 --> 22:16.700
I think for most people like the if Elder Scrolls 6 comes out on PlayStation, it's not

22:16.700 --> 22:20.580
really going to matter for most people because the Xbox version will be the one you want.

22:20.580 --> 22:26.260
I'm not so sure it's guaranteed something like Elder Scrolls 6 would come out on PlayStation.

22:26.260 --> 22:29.260
I don't think anybody should really count on that.

22:29.260 --> 22:32.500
I think you need to start setting yourself up mentally that you're going to have to get

22:32.500 --> 22:34.420
an Xbox if you want to play Elder Scrolls 6.

22:34.420 --> 22:39.300
I think Starfield absolutely is Xbox exclusive at this point.

22:39.300 --> 22:40.700
I got nothing to go off of.

22:40.700 --> 22:45.860
I got nothing but rumors and stuff and what they said during this event.

22:45.860 --> 22:48.860
But I think something like that you better believe is going to be Xbox exclusive.

22:48.860 --> 22:53.060
They had no reason to take that to PlayStation at this point.

22:53.060 --> 23:00.420
But I do think that all being said, I do think there's going to be room for certain Bethesda

23:00.420 --> 23:05.060
things to still show up on Nintendo Switch, certainly, because they seem to have a pretty

23:05.060 --> 23:06.380
good partnership.

23:06.380 --> 23:09.420
And Microsoft never really seems threatened by Nintendo.

23:09.420 --> 23:14.700
You know, they've done things like Ori and the Blind Forest and Will of the Wisps, Minecraft,

23:14.700 --> 23:18.300
of course, although that's its own circumstance, right?

23:18.300 --> 23:19.940
But we've seen interesting...

23:19.940 --> 23:21.620
A Cuphead would be another one.

23:21.620 --> 23:25.480
We've seen interesting little partnerships between Nintendo and Microsoft.

23:25.480 --> 23:28.060
And I think that will still also hold true with Bethesda.

23:28.060 --> 23:32.220
I'm not necessarily thinking the Elder Scrolls 6s of the world, but how about the Fallout

23:32.220 --> 23:38.820
shelters of the world and little things like that, I think would still be very likely for

23:38.820 --> 23:40.520
the Switch.

23:40.520 --> 23:44.540
So I don't think everything is going to be.

23:44.540 --> 23:45.940
Loki, what about you?

23:45.940 --> 23:47.420
Where's your head at on the exclusives?

23:47.420 --> 23:49.420
What do you think is going to happen?

23:49.420 --> 23:53.060
I think we'll see how it goes with just having one console.

23:53.060 --> 23:57.020
I mean, I think it depends on where they think they're going to make their money.

23:57.020 --> 24:04.100
If it's going to be a game that is primarily single player and kind of an RPG like an Elder

24:04.100 --> 24:08.980
Scrolls type game, then I think that they will keep it to the exclusive platforms.

24:08.980 --> 24:12.820
If it's something more of a live service game where they feel that they're going to make

24:12.820 --> 24:19.340
more money and reoccurring income from monthly subscriptions or microtransactions, then they're

24:19.340 --> 24:21.780
going to want it on as many platforms as possible.

24:21.780 --> 24:26.700
So I think it's just going to determine the type of games that they have and where they

24:26.700 --> 24:30.420
feel that they're going to be best fitting.

24:30.420 --> 24:32.560
Interesting conversation happening in chat.

24:32.560 --> 24:37.100
And I think it might have started with this comment here where Phoenix7726 said, how long

24:37.100 --> 24:40.140
before Sony or Nintendo take Ubisoft?

24:40.140 --> 24:46.960
And then S2100matt followed that up with Sony would be smart to target Konami.

24:46.960 --> 24:48.780
And there's some other follow ups to that.

24:48.780 --> 24:53.260
And it's interesting, this conversation about Microsoft and Bethesda is sort of starting

24:53.260 --> 24:56.340
this who's next type of trend.

24:56.340 --> 24:58.300
Is Sony going to get Konami or something like that?

24:58.300 --> 25:02.900
Now it's pointed out, I think Bobby Blackwell said, Konami is no longer a console video

25:02.900 --> 25:05.860
game company and everyone's still in denial about it.

25:05.860 --> 25:07.000
Very true.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.480
But I think there's something to be said about, you know, the case set, you know, being pretty

25:11.480 --> 25:13.320
much long gone.

25:13.320 --> 25:20.320
And could maybe Konami's intellectual properties still be, you know, maybe if the whole company

25:20.320 --> 25:25.000
isn't bought, could their intellectual property be bought for console usage?

25:25.000 --> 25:28.400
And of course, I hate to bring it up because this rumor won't fucking die.

25:28.400 --> 25:32.480
But there's the whole Sony and Konami are in cahoots on a new Silent Hill.

25:32.480 --> 25:35.840
I give us a screenshot or something.

25:35.840 --> 25:37.480
I don't know.

25:37.480 --> 25:41.280
But I do like honestly, that would be a dream.

25:41.280 --> 25:47.960
If Sony were to acquire things like Castlevania as an IP, Silent Hill as an IP, Suikoden as

25:47.960 --> 25:48.960
an IP.

25:48.960 --> 25:52.440
Can you can you imagine if Sony brought back Suikoden?

25:52.440 --> 25:57.120
Like that's hot, like somebody needs to get all the Konami IPs and do something with them,

25:57.120 --> 25:59.380
at least in the home entertainment.

25:59.780 --> 26:05.220
What could also be very interesting, where would it if somebody were to buy and I realize

26:05.220 --> 26:09.900
I'm going on a tangent, but forgive me, because our show is rooted in a lot of Konami's culture

26:09.900 --> 26:12.260
when it comes to music games.

26:12.260 --> 26:17.100
Could you imagine if a company acquired the ability to make Bimani game home versions

26:17.100 --> 26:20.100
that would actually do something with it?

26:20.100 --> 26:25.380
And like Sony could I see Sony as a company where if they actually acquired the ability

26:25.380 --> 26:30.540
to make Bimani home games, they might actually fucking do something with it.

26:30.540 --> 26:33.460
And it could be very exciting, actually.

26:33.460 --> 26:37.500
But I realize things like Bimani get really weird because Konami still has an interest

26:37.500 --> 26:38.940
in the arcade stuff.

26:38.940 --> 26:44.000
Konami still has their stuff they're doing on the PC with, you know, they're they're

26:44.000 --> 26:48.100
like pop music online and they're 2DX Infinitas and all that stuff.

26:48.100 --> 26:53.420
So I think Bimani in particular is in a really weird gray area when we come to talk about

26:53.420 --> 26:54.940
acquiring stuff.

26:54.940 --> 27:00.060
But I see these great IPs that are really going nowhere as of late.

27:00.060 --> 27:05.040
And I would like Sony or somebody to buy them, quite frankly, at least the intellectual property.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.940
But I get the contracts can be weird.

27:06.940 --> 27:12.080
And Konami has not been a very well run company for quite a long time at this point.

27:12.080 --> 27:15.620
So I'm not sure they're going to sell just because we want them to.

27:15.620 --> 27:16.620
It's weird.

27:16.620 --> 27:17.620
Yeah.

27:17.620 --> 27:23.180
Konami also, they have to deal with probably a big difference in business model for Japanese

27:23.180 --> 27:27.260
origin companies versus European.

27:27.260 --> 27:28.260
It could be very true.

27:28.260 --> 27:35.140
And also, I mean, different rules of acquisition for for, you know, Asian countries versus

27:35.140 --> 27:36.220
European countries.

27:36.220 --> 27:42.460
So it might not even be worth it, especially since they've especially for Konami since

27:42.460 --> 27:49.060
they've become a little bit more niche with their bigger focus on the Pachi slot, you

27:49.060 --> 27:50.060
know.

27:50.060 --> 27:51.060
Yeah.

27:51.060 --> 27:52.060
Or just slots in general.

27:52.060 --> 27:56.600
And remember, walk into any casino and look at look at the look on the corner of the marquees

27:56.600 --> 27:58.220
for the different slot machines.

27:58.220 --> 27:59.940
About half of them are going to say Konami.

27:59.940 --> 28:03.660
And they're not they're not things like Castlevania slots.

28:03.660 --> 28:08.440
They're like, like, I don't think kitty glitter is by them, but I'm sure they have their own

28:08.440 --> 28:10.220
type of kitten slot machine.

28:10.220 --> 28:15.700
And there's I think that slot fortune cookie is Konami.

28:15.700 --> 28:20.500
There's a lot of like, Konami has a lot of slot machines with things you wouldn't even

28:20.500 --> 28:21.500
think were Konami.

28:21.940 --> 28:22.940
Yeah.

28:22.940 --> 28:23.940
Anyway.

28:23.940 --> 28:24.940
Okay.

28:24.940 --> 28:27.140
I completely took like the exit.

28:27.140 --> 28:32.300
I'm like that meme of the car who's like, oh, L.R. staying focused on the news tangent.

28:32.300 --> 28:38.940
And I just went down to let me go back to the news about Bethesda and Konami.

28:38.940 --> 28:43.180
Let's talk about what this does for Game Pass, because I think I think another reason why

28:43.180 --> 28:47.500
our chat room has this reaction of who's going to be next is because I think we're all looking

28:47.500 --> 28:48.740
at this going.

28:48.780 --> 28:52.020
Is anybody going to compete with Game Pass?

28:52.020 --> 28:56.020
Because right now, it seems like nobody's trying.

28:56.020 --> 29:00.300
Google Stadia sure didn't, because they went with a completely different model, right?

29:00.300 --> 29:03.700
Like who is actually trying to compete with Game Pass?

29:03.700 --> 29:08.300
I guess you could say EA Play, but look what happened there.

29:08.300 --> 29:09.300
No, not even.

29:09.300 --> 29:15.700
Well, EA Play, yeah, that's part of Game Pass now, but at least the trial version is.

29:15.740 --> 29:20.700
I don't know if anybody's really doing, you know, like a competitor for Game Pass.

29:20.700 --> 29:25.340
I could see Sony altering PlayStation now to try to make it like that.

29:25.340 --> 29:27.220
I don't know if they have downloadable games yet.

29:27.220 --> 29:28.820
That really is the thing that they need.

29:28.820 --> 29:30.620
The streaming stuff.

29:30.620 --> 29:37.740
It once again, it's a nice idea to have that you can stream any title, but the bandwidth,

29:37.740 --> 29:43.660
man, it just in this day and age, that's not something that we need to be more manageable

29:43.660 --> 29:46.980
and downloading something, it's going to be a lot more manageable that way.

29:46.980 --> 29:49.620
And I do want to address some of the stuff in chat because they're echoing some of what

29:49.620 --> 29:50.620
you're saying here.

29:50.620 --> 29:54.220
SJ100Matt says Sony is trying, PlayStation Plus will get there.

29:54.220 --> 29:56.420
Tiger Claw says Nintendo isn't even trying either.

29:56.420 --> 30:01.060
I mean, I guess you could say technically they do have their, you know, classic game

30:01.060 --> 30:03.820
library if you want to give them, you know, a point for that.

30:03.820 --> 30:07.060
Have they added anything to that in like, ever?

30:07.060 --> 30:08.700
I mean, like, I don't know.

30:08.700 --> 30:11.740
Yeah, last month we had the news about like fire and ice.

30:11.740 --> 30:15.260
I mean, we're getting, you know, I think all the Donkey Kong Country games have now

30:15.260 --> 30:16.260
shown up now.

30:16.260 --> 30:19.860
It's slim pickings, but they are adding to it.

30:19.860 --> 30:22.700
I mean, technically, Logie, the answer to your question is yes, they are adding to it.

30:22.700 --> 30:26.400
It's just not at the pace you or I or anybody else would really like now.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.400
But here's the thing.

30:27.400 --> 30:30.440
When you guys talk about the PlayStation, Nintendo, that's actually kind of my point

30:30.440 --> 30:34.980
is that those what's happening here with Microsoft and Bethesda and this whole news and their

30:34.980 --> 30:40.960
real like laser focus on Game Pass, they are fucking about to lap the other guys in how

30:41.000 --> 30:45.040
far along they are in becoming the Netflix of gaming.

30:45.040 --> 30:50.560
Now, of course, Netflix at one point had lapped everybody as well.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.400
And then some of the big boys really did.

30:52.400 --> 30:54.720
Then Disney Plus decided to show up.

30:54.720 --> 30:58.760
Then they decided to put a really fucking good Marvel show on it and so on.

30:58.760 --> 31:03.560
Like, you know, things like Disney Plus and even to some extent Paramount Plus, certainly

31:03.560 --> 31:05.800
Hulu, are starting to catch up to Netflix.

31:05.800 --> 31:06.800
Apple TV is doing it well too.

31:06.800 --> 31:07.800
Oh, yes.

31:07.800 --> 31:10.920
And of course, there's Apple TV and there's lots of stuff.

31:10.920 --> 31:16.280
But my point is, how many years did Netflix go unchecked?

31:16.280 --> 31:21.300
And that's what I see happening here with Game Pass and Microsoft is that they're just

31:21.300 --> 31:26.400
able to etch out such a huge lead in this.

31:26.400 --> 31:29.320
You know, I mean, it's it's interesting.

31:29.320 --> 31:33.100
And you know, Bobby says Xbox is no longer in the console war.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.880
They're in the ecosystem war.

31:34.880 --> 31:36.840
Sony is still trying to win the console war.

31:36.840 --> 31:39.280
And Microsoft doesn't really care about the console.

31:39.280 --> 31:42.680
And I think this is a huge mistake on Sony's part.

31:42.680 --> 31:45.160
I really do.

31:45.160 --> 31:50.100
I think they need to get serious about responding to Game Pass if they want to have that longevity.

31:50.100 --> 31:55.980
Because I think this news about Bethesda and everything with Game Pass, there isn't even

31:55.980 --> 31:58.560
lines to read between.

31:58.560 --> 32:02.880
Like in sometimes with these stories in the past, a year ago, I've had to say read between

32:02.880 --> 32:03.900
the lines.

32:03.900 --> 32:05.700
This is a Game Pass thing.

32:05.700 --> 32:10.100
Why did Microsoft have that E3 where they announced that they were acquiring seven studios

32:10.100 --> 32:11.580
that read between the lines?

32:11.580 --> 32:12.580
It's a Game Pass thing.

32:12.580 --> 32:14.740
You don't even have to read between the lines anymore.

32:14.740 --> 32:19.100
They said it's a Game Pass thing.

32:19.100 --> 32:22.000
So you can tell where Microsoft's interests are.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.420
It was not about bringing the games to Xbox Series X.

32:25.420 --> 32:28.140
It was not about bringing the games to Xbox One.

32:28.140 --> 32:31.120
It was about bringing the games to Game Pass.

32:31.120 --> 32:33.540
So did I just set off my phone?

32:33.540 --> 32:36.420
I think I did.

32:36.420 --> 32:37.420
Leave me alone.

32:37.420 --> 32:38.420
All right.

32:38.420 --> 32:40.780
I think it was my watch, actually.

32:40.780 --> 32:41.780
All right.

32:41.780 --> 32:45.780
Anyway, any other thoughts on the Bethesda Xbox thing?

32:45.780 --> 32:46.780
All right.

32:46.780 --> 32:47.780
Not really.

32:47.780 --> 32:48.780
All right.

32:48.780 --> 32:53.140
Then let's move on and we'll talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games

32:53.140 --> 32:54.920
that we have been playing this week.

32:54.920 --> 32:56.780
So Dark Soccer, let's start with you.

32:56.780 --> 32:58.780
How was your gaming week?

32:58.780 --> 33:00.620
Animal Crossing.

33:00.620 --> 33:01.620
It's a good choice.

33:01.620 --> 33:02.620
And Wordscape.

33:02.620 --> 33:09.020
Wordscape is like how I wake up my brain in the morning and now I'm actually timing myself

33:09.020 --> 33:16.040
to see how quickly I can finish an entire series, like the 16 puzzles.

33:16.040 --> 33:20.380
And so far, my fastest has been within like four and a half minutes.

33:20.380 --> 33:21.380
Wow.

33:21.380 --> 33:25.060
So now that I'm bored with that, now I'm actually seeing how many different words I can figure

33:25.060 --> 33:26.060
out.

33:26.060 --> 33:29.940
And right now, my max is 16 extra words.

33:29.940 --> 33:31.300
Nice.

33:31.300 --> 33:36.940
So it's really just been that and not that it's a game, but it's kind of a contest because

33:36.940 --> 33:39.240
it had achievements.

33:39.240 --> 33:40.540
I like Duolingo.

33:40.540 --> 33:43.340
I'm relearning Japanese.

33:43.340 --> 33:48.600
And I had a challenge to be number one in the Diamond League, which is like the top

33:48.600 --> 33:51.300
league and number one's pretty hard to get.

33:51.300 --> 33:53.500
You got to stay on top of it.

33:53.500 --> 34:01.100
And I think I earned something like 900 XP doing this, but I made number one in Diamond

34:01.100 --> 34:02.780
League.

34:02.780 --> 34:07.660
So now I can go back to half-assing it.

34:07.660 --> 34:16.380
So that's really all, although I'm pretty much considering making myself a Japanese

34:16.380 --> 34:22.880
account to play Animal Crossing so that I can maybe use that again to sort of teach

34:22.880 --> 34:23.880
myself.

34:23.880 --> 34:26.580
Oh, that's a cute idea.

34:26.580 --> 34:39.380
I was doing that with the original, not the N64 one, but the GameCube double tsunami plus.

34:39.380 --> 34:41.580
And it was pretty difficult at the time.

34:41.580 --> 34:46.360
Now I think I read a lot better, so I might have an easier time of it, but we'll see.

34:46.360 --> 34:51.620
It's interesting because Shane has talked to me about how he plays Final Fantasy XIV

34:51.620 --> 34:54.920
in Japanese because he's also studying Japanese right now.

34:54.920 --> 34:57.120
And so that is something to kind of help him learn.

34:57.120 --> 35:01.780
So that's a very interesting like trick or technique, I guess, to helping immerse yourself

35:01.780 --> 35:05.820
in a language is take one of your favorite video games, you know, and play it again,

35:05.820 --> 35:10.740
but in Japanese or continue to play it in Japanese is a little way to kind of practice.

35:10.740 --> 35:11.740
It's interesting.

35:11.740 --> 35:20.140
And I did order some stickers, but they never arrived, but I got the idea from when Extrofer

35:20.140 --> 35:21.620
was learning Russian.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.840
Oh, and he had all those postcards all over the house?

35:24.840 --> 35:25.840
Exactly.

35:25.840 --> 35:31.640
So I was ordering stickers to put on things, and I might just have to make my own, like

35:31.640 --> 35:36.460
get some like Avery labels or something, which shouldn't be too difficult to do.

35:36.460 --> 35:42.540
But I also have another thing coming on tomorrow should be here.

35:42.540 --> 35:43.540
And that's Mac Mini.

35:43.540 --> 35:44.540
Oh, yeah.

35:45.460 --> 35:53.300
I'm getting the Mac Mini M1, mostly for, you know, using Final Cut and Logic.

35:53.300 --> 36:01.320
But I'm looking forward to seeing what I've been hearing about how well it plays some

36:01.320 --> 36:06.840
of the games, because it's supposed to have just like this kickass graphics acceleration.

36:06.840 --> 36:13.100
So and I have a bunch of games in my Steam that are Mac compatible, and I have a few

36:13.160 --> 36:17.360
others that I had, you know, from the App Store, like, you know, Borderlands.

36:17.360 --> 36:23.960
So I'm going to try to get my streaming setup done and do a little bit of Mac streaming.

36:23.960 --> 36:24.960
So I see.

36:24.960 --> 36:25.960
All right.

36:25.960 --> 36:26.960
Excellent.

36:26.960 --> 36:31.020
I'm looking forward to reporting on it, but that's why I brought it up, because it will

36:31.020 --> 36:32.320
I'll be gaming on it.

36:32.320 --> 36:36.520
Although I hate that I'd have to buy Final Fantasy 14 completely over if I wanted to

36:36.520 --> 36:37.520
play it.

36:37.520 --> 36:38.520
Oh, yeah.

36:38.520 --> 36:39.520
Kind of lame.

36:39.520 --> 36:40.520
At least I have my account.

36:40.520 --> 36:41.520
We'll see.

36:41.940 --> 36:44.220
Does any of the arcade stuff extend to Mac Mini or is that only?

36:44.220 --> 36:45.220
Yes, it does.

36:45.220 --> 36:46.220
Oh, cool.

36:46.220 --> 36:48.020
You should check out that Fantasian.

36:48.020 --> 36:50.500
I really want to see more about that.

36:50.500 --> 36:51.500
I'll look into it.

36:51.500 --> 36:57.320
I mean, I like I, you know, when I sold my iMac, I'm actually probably selling my MacBook

36:57.320 --> 37:01.460
Pro because I use my iPad all the time.

37:01.460 --> 37:07.940
But I was, you know, playing patterned because, you know, I love patterned and I actually

37:07.940 --> 37:11.500
fully beat everything out on patterned right now.

37:11.500 --> 37:17.060
But I would play patterned on my iPad and on a Mac.

37:17.060 --> 37:19.480
So arcade goes through.

37:19.480 --> 37:20.480
Cool.

37:20.480 --> 37:21.480
Play what?

37:21.480 --> 37:22.480
The golf every so often.

37:22.480 --> 37:23.480
Good to know.

37:23.480 --> 37:24.480
Yeah.

37:24.480 --> 37:25.480
All right.

37:25.480 --> 37:26.480
Well, let's check it.

37:26.480 --> 37:29.920
Actually, a quick listener comment on the last segment before I go to Loki's gaming

37:29.920 --> 37:30.920
week.

37:30.920 --> 37:35.440
Bonds 006 in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network said Microsoft all you can eat model

37:35.440 --> 37:37.340
is great for those that want it.

37:37.340 --> 37:42.120
Bad times ahead winner if paywall for games become the only way to play games.

37:42.120 --> 37:43.120
I don't think it will.

37:43.120 --> 37:47.180
I mean, you're always going to have to pay for well, not true, I guess, because there

37:47.180 --> 37:51.160
are things like Fortnite and the free to play model will always exist.

37:51.160 --> 37:53.680
But that also is going to exist out of any of those ecosystems.

37:53.680 --> 37:59.200
But you know, even if you drop $60 or some $70, I guess for a new game, that is a paywall

37:59.200 --> 38:00.200
of sorts.

38:00.200 --> 38:05.440
But I think I do see your point that like, you know, what if I want to just own this

38:05.440 --> 38:06.440
game?

38:06.540 --> 38:08.380
What if I want the streaming service to play this game?

38:08.380 --> 38:13.300
I don't see that going away, especially with how integrated the digital storefronts are.

38:13.300 --> 38:17.860
I think there's always going to be ways to buy a game that you really want without needing

38:17.860 --> 38:22.940
any of these, you know, game pass or any of these service PS now, whatever you don't need

38:22.940 --> 38:23.940
any of it.

38:23.940 --> 38:28.620
Again, I always kind of look at this comparison to the movie industry.

38:28.620 --> 38:32.140
And I think, you know, you obviously a lot of Hollywood has gone to streaming services.

38:32.140 --> 38:33.460
But you know what?

38:33.460 --> 38:34.460
You can still get Blu rays.

38:34.840 --> 38:37.600
You can probably even still get DVDs.

38:37.600 --> 38:42.680
It's not quite as plentiful as it was pre Netflix, but it's out there.

38:42.680 --> 38:45.100
And hell online, you can get almost anything.

38:45.100 --> 38:48.640
So there's a movie you really want and you don't, you know, because movies come and go

38:48.640 --> 38:51.560
from the different streaming services too, which is really irritating.

38:51.560 --> 38:57.480
So like my favorite movie, Clue, I know it's on Pluto TV, and I think it's on the new Paramount

38:57.480 --> 38:58.480
Plus.

38:58.480 --> 38:59.480
But you know what?

38:59.480 --> 39:03.100
I own it on Blu ray just because I want to own it.

39:03.120 --> 39:06.120
And I don't want to have to chase it around different streaming services.

39:06.120 --> 39:09.080
And so I think there's I think that would be the case for games as well.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.960
I don't I don't see that for a few movies.

39:11.960 --> 39:15.760
Yeah, especially when it comes to Nintendo, if Nintendo is still going to always remain

39:15.760 --> 39:17.880
a portable system.

39:17.880 --> 39:19.160
We're not at the level yet.

39:19.160 --> 39:24.280
And certainly Nintendo is not at the level yet where like, they're going to stream 5G

39:24.280 --> 39:30.080
games to the switch, maybe 10, 15 years, we might have a different conversation on that.

39:30.080 --> 39:32.860
This show will probably still be going.

39:32.860 --> 39:38.300
But right now, no, I there were a long, long way out from that, for sure.

39:38.300 --> 39:39.300
Anyway.

39:39.300 --> 39:40.300
Okay, I just want to comment on that.

39:40.300 --> 39:41.500
I did think it was a good comment.

39:41.500 --> 39:45.300
But I think if you again, you look to Hollywood, I think you see a lot of where games is going

39:45.300 --> 39:47.940
games is just lagging 510 years behind.

39:47.940 --> 39:48.940
All right.

39:48.940 --> 39:51.700
Loki, how was your gaming week?

39:51.700 --> 39:52.940
I didn't play a ton.

39:52.940 --> 39:55.020
I did play a lot of Minecraft.

39:55.020 --> 40:01.080
And then of course, I had picked up a what's it called?

40:01.080 --> 40:09.080
It's a ABS retro HD I think systems a while back, it's basically like an HD Nintendo and

40:09.080 --> 40:10.460
Famicom.

40:10.460 --> 40:14.440
And so I've been just picking up a few Nintendo games here and there.

40:14.440 --> 40:19.640
So I got this week as a blaster master bionic commando, and of course, the guardian legend

40:19.640 --> 40:23.760
and then also rampage because it came with the guardian legend.

40:23.760 --> 40:27.720
Did you go to the retro store downtown or the one in Fair Oaks?

40:27.720 --> 40:28.720
The one in Fair Oaks.

40:28.720 --> 40:29.720
Okay.

40:29.720 --> 40:30.720
Because I didn't want to go all the way downtown.

40:30.720 --> 40:31.720
That's a cool place too.

40:31.720 --> 40:32.720
Like I'm not going to.

40:32.720 --> 40:33.720
We may as well give Fair Game a shout out.

40:33.720 --> 40:36.380
They're a local business and they're pretty fair.

40:36.380 --> 40:37.380
Yeah.

40:37.380 --> 40:38.380
Yeah.

40:38.380 --> 40:39.380
The prices were definitely good.

40:39.380 --> 40:44.620
I could have bought a whole lot more and I sought myself, but they have a lot of stuff

40:44.620 --> 40:45.620
there.

40:45.620 --> 40:49.640
They even carry some homebrew NES games and reprints.

40:49.640 --> 40:56.360
So like I didn't realize, but they have a NES multi-cart for a bunch of data East games.

40:56.360 --> 40:59.760
That's actually officially endorsed by data East and stuff.

40:59.760 --> 41:01.040
So I thought that was kind of interesting.

41:01.040 --> 41:02.040
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

41:02.040 --> 41:05.640
Does this mean you might sell your game at retail?

41:05.640 --> 41:06.680
It would be cool if I could.

41:06.680 --> 41:11.280
I didn't ask him, but like I saw that they had, um, they had, what was it?

41:11.280 --> 41:15.160
It's um, I think it's like hollow Halloween or something like that.

41:15.160 --> 41:22.600
Um, 85, there's some, some Halloween game, um, that they have, that's, uh, pretty well

41:22.600 --> 41:27.000
known and they have the box copy of it there for like 60 bucks.

41:27.000 --> 41:31.320
So a haunted Halloween 85, that's what it was.

41:31.320 --> 41:38.640
And um, so I saw that I was actually looking to see if they had any like other, you know,

41:38.640 --> 41:40.000
indie games there.

41:40.000 --> 41:45.480
Um, I think there's a few things, but like a lot, not so much on the NES and like some

41:45.480 --> 41:49.880
of the other stuff I was looking for, they didn't really have, but I mean, it's certainly

41:49.880 --> 41:56.680
well organized compared to, I like the previous week I had gone to the local flea market here

41:56.680 --> 42:03.280
and there's a guy that has a retro game store with games that are in far less good shape

42:03.280 --> 42:06.520
and it's just, there's no organization to it at all.

42:06.520 --> 42:11.500
It's like a bunch of NES carts and good luck, find what you're looking for because none

42:11.500 --> 42:12.500
of it's organized in.

42:12.500 --> 42:13.500
It's just a big pile mess.

42:13.500 --> 42:15.740
Not Crater Dan back, is it?

42:15.740 --> 42:21.760
It's uh, retro, it's like Dave's, it's, it's on the, he's, he's talking about the Folsom

42:21.760 --> 42:23.760
Boulevard one, not Denios.

42:23.760 --> 42:27.160
Oh, I don't think I've been there.

42:27.160 --> 42:28.160
Yeah.

42:28.160 --> 42:33.880
So his store is a bit, uh, trap, I mean, it, it represents the, the flea market as a whole.

42:33.880 --> 42:38.960
I mean, the whole flea market's kind of a dump, but that whole thing, not to like give

42:38.960 --> 42:43.600
away my address, but that whole thing is within like maybe two miles of my house and I'll

42:43.600 --> 42:46.080
still take the 20 minute drive to go to Denios.

42:46.080 --> 42:51.880
I would have, I should have gone to Denios, but like, I just wanted to real quickly check

42:51.880 --> 42:52.880
it out.

42:52.880 --> 42:58.280
Cause I saw when I was looking for like NES games on, um, not like the Facebook marketplace

42:58.280 --> 43:03.800
and like on Craigslist or something like that, I saw an ad for it and it looked, you know,

43:03.800 --> 43:04.800
better.

43:04.800 --> 43:06.400
They also have like amiibos and stuff like that.

43:06.400 --> 43:10.920
Um, so I wanted to go in there and see what they had, but Oh my God, it was a mess.

43:10.920 --> 43:15.040
Like I could, I could literally not find anything that I was looking for in there.

43:15.040 --> 43:17.400
Like I could have asked them, they would have been like, I don't know.

43:17.400 --> 43:22.240
And the way they have their counter set up, like if there's stuff on the counter and like

43:22.240 --> 43:25.600
the way the games are stacked up in there, you can't even see what's in there.

43:25.600 --> 43:26.800
It's just, it's a mess.

43:26.800 --> 43:31.760
And just looking at the labels, uh, from where they had it on there, it just looked trash.

43:31.760 --> 43:34.720
Just like dumpster diving for $5 DVDs at Walmart, right?

43:34.720 --> 43:35.720
Yeah.

43:35.720 --> 43:39.840
Pretty much like, except if the DVDs were like scraped off of the street, you know,

43:39.840 --> 43:44.280
because they'd been thrown away before, um, whereas at least the stuff that was at fair

43:44.280 --> 43:49.560
game, if the pricing wasn't bad, it was like 10 bucks a game.

43:49.560 --> 43:53.160
And depending on what you're looking for, obviously like Zelda was like 30 or $40.

43:53.160 --> 43:55.680
I'm like, I don't really want for that much.

43:55.680 --> 43:59.320
Um, but yeah, it's just, it's so much better.

43:59.320 --> 44:02.360
Just not a nightmare to find stuff.

44:02.360 --> 44:07.400
Um, so yeah, eventually I'll go back out to the, it's been a while since I've been out

44:07.400 --> 44:12.280
there, but like, I just want to do like a really quick trip to see what they had and

44:12.280 --> 44:13.280
that was it.

44:13.280 --> 44:16.640
So, um, you know, I'll probably go back to fair game at some point, you know, I don't

44:16.640 --> 44:21.740
want to get a huge collection of stuff cause I don't have any place to put it.

44:21.740 --> 44:22.740
So I don't know.

44:22.740 --> 44:23.740
We'll see.

44:23.740 --> 44:24.740
All right.

44:24.740 --> 44:26.160
Um, well I'll talk about my gaming week.

44:26.160 --> 44:30.200
So as I mentioned earlier, when Loki was talking about Bethesda, I did play doom 64

44:30.200 --> 44:31.320
this week a little bit.

44:31.320 --> 44:32.320
That's fun.

44:32.320 --> 44:36.280
Um, and also I used the whole, uh, game pass expansion, Bethesda.

44:36.280 --> 44:41.640
I picked up elder scrolls, oblivion, the Xbox three 61, because I was like, I just want

44:41.640 --> 44:42.640
to check it out.

44:42.640 --> 44:49.280
And I have to say, holy shit, the loading times are crazy good because of the whole

44:49.280 --> 44:53.540
fact like series X, you know, is on the, the, um, solid state drive and all that stuff and

44:53.540 --> 44:55.040
boast the faster loading times.

44:55.040 --> 45:00.280
I gotta say now that I'm playing oblivion, uh, it's, you notice it and it looks really

45:00.280 --> 45:01.280
sharp.

45:01.280 --> 45:05.760
You know, it's, it's still a years old game at this point from what, like 2006.

45:05.760 --> 45:11.880
But um, it's, it holds up pretty well thanks to, I'm not sure how many of those enhancements

45:11.880 --> 45:16.520
like the HDR and the frame skip stuff or the frame speed up stuff they've actually put

45:16.520 --> 45:17.840
into this yet.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.760
I think some of that is still coming.

45:19.760 --> 45:21.560
Um, but it looks good.

45:21.560 --> 45:23.520
Um, and so I enjoyed it well enough.

45:23.520 --> 45:26.880
You know, I'm not going to spend a lot of time on it, but, uh, I had a good time.

45:26.880 --> 45:29.440
It's kind of like going down memory lane, I guess.

45:29.440 --> 45:31.540
So, um, so I played a little bit of that.

45:31.540 --> 45:35.800
I'm still playing dead by daylight, thanks to husband and his streams.

45:35.800 --> 45:40.700
Um, I actually finally got to the point I spent money on it.

45:40.700 --> 45:45.140
I bought a new killer because I had to be able to play the game as pyramid head.

45:45.140 --> 45:49.760
So I bought pyramid head and day by daylight and I gotta say he's fucking fun.

45:49.760 --> 45:51.280
He's really fun to play.

45:51.280 --> 45:56.040
And you know, it's funny cause everybody tells me pyramid heads a little more advanced.

45:56.040 --> 45:59.360
I don't know if you want to, you know, even Alan is kind of like, he's a little bit harder

45:59.360 --> 46:00.360
to play.

46:00.360 --> 46:01.360
I don't know.

46:01.360 --> 46:02.880
And I'm like, I want to play this game as pyramid head.

46:02.880 --> 46:04.560
I will learn.

46:04.560 --> 46:10.100
And so it's pretty cool cause he digs trenches that, um, the survivors, if they touch them,

46:10.100 --> 46:11.440
they become tormented.

46:11.440 --> 46:12.440
And this is really cool.

46:12.440 --> 46:16.000
If they're tormented, then when you down them, instead of putting them on a hook, you can

46:16.000 --> 46:17.600
send them to a cage.

46:17.600 --> 46:21.120
So they go to a, like a barbed wire cage type of thing they have to escape from.

46:21.120 --> 46:22.600
And so that feels really good.

46:22.600 --> 46:25.880
Um, so I've, I've caged a few survivors and that's a lot of fun.

46:25.880 --> 46:30.420
So pyramid head is, is now my main in dead by daylight, at least for now until I get

46:30.420 --> 46:32.920
suckered into, uh, buying another killer.

46:32.920 --> 46:33.920
We'll see.

46:33.920 --> 46:35.440
But that's all, again, that's all thanks to Alan.

46:35.440 --> 46:40.500
I would, I wouldn't have given that game really another look, but he really did some streaming.

46:40.500 --> 46:41.500
I'll give him a cheap plug.

46:41.500 --> 46:42.960
Twitch TV slash Alan alchemy.

46:42.960 --> 46:44.760
I think he's streaming after tonight.

46:44.760 --> 46:46.380
So well are, I think he wanted to do that.

46:46.380 --> 46:49.800
So you might actually get to see him if you hang out until the end of the show.

46:49.800 --> 46:53.560
Um, but, um, he was really good at explaining all the mechanics.

46:53.560 --> 46:54.560
And I will say this.

46:54.560 --> 46:59.920
I played my first survivor game in dead by daylight, which I, you know, was kind of like

46:59.920 --> 47:02.800
on the fence, like, uh, but having played enough, I was like, all right, I should get

47:02.800 --> 47:04.240
in there and played survivor.

47:04.240 --> 47:05.960
I did not enjoy playing survivor.

47:05.960 --> 47:07.160
It was too stressful.

47:07.160 --> 47:09.080
I hate that heartbeat shit.

47:09.080 --> 47:12.320
Like when the killer's getting closer, the heartbeat gets into, and so my own heartbeat

47:12.320 --> 47:14.120
is like, what the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck?

47:14.120 --> 47:16.960
And then like, I was just playing like a dummy.

47:16.960 --> 47:21.320
Like I thought I was running away from the killer and the killer literally cornered me.

47:21.320 --> 47:25.280
So because a lot of people that play that game are kind of dicks, like the killer is

47:25.280 --> 47:27.760
like standing there right in front of me blocking.

47:27.760 --> 47:29.000
So I can't go anywhere.

47:29.000 --> 47:33.080
And so of course he starts doing the whole nanny, nanny, nanny, teabag TV, nanny, nanny,

47:33.080 --> 47:35.060
nanny, like, ah, you can't do anything.

47:35.060 --> 47:36.060
And then kills me.

47:36.060 --> 47:37.560
I'm like, you fucking dick.

47:37.560 --> 47:40.360
So I did not enjoy survivor experience.

47:40.360 --> 47:41.960
I don't think I'm going to do that again.

47:41.960 --> 47:46.480
Like, ah, I am a murderer at heart.

47:46.480 --> 47:49.360
That is, that is how I'm going to stick to it.

47:49.360 --> 47:51.680
All right.

47:51.680 --> 47:57.280
Um, I'm looking in chat, SSJ100Matt says, so Rob and Alan co-stream when?

47:57.280 --> 47:58.320
Okay.

47:58.320 --> 47:59.320
Do not quote me on this.

47:59.320 --> 48:00.800
Do not like write.

48:00.800 --> 48:02.320
This is not science seal delivered.

48:02.320 --> 48:04.340
However, we are talking about.

48:04.340 --> 48:09.560
So I mentioned after Bobby does his, um, reward stream here at VOG network, he's going to

48:09.560 --> 48:12.280
do the VHS tapes, memory lane stream.

48:12.280 --> 48:14.280
You already got the points raised for that.

48:14.280 --> 48:16.300
That is going to happen in the next couple of weeks.

48:16.300 --> 48:21.200
So once that's done, we already talked about the next stream is going to be, um, the Shane's

48:21.200 --> 48:22.840
definitive Pokemon rankings.

48:22.840 --> 48:23.960
We talked about that last week.

48:23.960 --> 48:27.800
So Shane is going to get out of spreadsheets, walk you through his spreadsheets of how he

48:27.800 --> 48:29.140
ranks Pokemon.

48:29.140 --> 48:31.580
And I think we said we were going to do the top 50 Poke.

48:31.580 --> 48:34.740
If we do all 800, it's going to be a 48 hour stream.

48:34.740 --> 48:37.400
So I think we said, we're going to do like the top 50 Pokemon is going to do his definitive

48:37.400 --> 48:38.400
ranking.

48:38.400 --> 48:44.860
The next stream after that, I am looking at doing a Rob Roberts, murders, his husband

48:44.860 --> 48:48.660
stream, um, in dead by daylight.

48:48.660 --> 48:53.020
So it'll be Rob Roberts murders, his husband in dead by daylight, but we're going to need

48:53.020 --> 48:57.980
to find three other survivors who Rob Roberts will also be murdering.

48:57.980 --> 49:03.660
Um, and if you're playing in that, if that's okay, if you're new to dead by daylight, that's,

49:03.660 --> 49:04.660
it can be listeners.

49:04.660 --> 49:06.380
It could be other friends of the show, whatever.

49:06.380 --> 49:10.560
If you're new to dead by daylight, that's okay because Alan will be coaching the team

49:10.560 --> 49:11.880
of survivors.

49:11.880 --> 49:14.840
So it will be a, and I fucking suck as a killer.

49:14.840 --> 49:20.420
So like, you know, if you're going to want to learn, this will be the stream to do it.

49:20.420 --> 49:23.720
I have to confirm and make sure Alan's all good with that.

49:23.720 --> 49:27.020
That is what we're looking at for the third bonus stream that will come a little later

49:27.020 --> 49:28.020
on.

49:28.020 --> 49:29.800
So, all right.

49:29.800 --> 49:37.300
Speaking in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, uh, sweet Nick, sweet Nika.

49:37.300 --> 49:38.300
I hope I said that right.

49:38.300 --> 49:39.300
I'm sorry.

49:39.300 --> 49:40.300
Nika.

49:40.300 --> 49:41.300
Sorry about that.

49:41.300 --> 49:45.160
Uh, says I play survivor more than killer, but being killer is a great stress relief

49:45.160 --> 49:46.160
at dead by daylight.

49:46.160 --> 49:47.160
LOL.

49:47.160 --> 49:51.260
Um, I am taking comfort in the fact that Alan is a pretty good survivor, but when he plays

49:51.260 --> 49:53.320
killer, he's about as good as I am.

49:53.320 --> 49:56.880
So I don't feel like I'm lagging behind or anything like that, which is nice.

49:56.960 --> 50:01.360
Um, as soon under Matt says, got to have Shane's not top 10 Pokemon though.

50:01.360 --> 50:02.360
Ha ha ha.

50:02.360 --> 50:05.800
Uh, and DJ Romas says we need a Rob Roberts presents among us.

50:05.800 --> 50:06.800
Yeah.

50:06.800 --> 50:10.240
I know that's still a desire to, that may end up being the third thing.

50:10.240 --> 50:13.800
So that's why I said, don't quote me on it, but we'll, uh, we'll, we'll get on that.

50:13.800 --> 50:14.800
So, okay.

50:14.800 --> 50:18.640
So see dark soccer, you don't have to worry pixel Pacas already volunteering to get murdered

50:18.640 --> 50:19.640
by me.

50:19.640 --> 50:20.640
So there we go.

50:20.640 --> 50:23.440
We're we'll get, we'll get Alan's team together in no time.

50:23.440 --> 50:24.440
All right.

50:24.440 --> 50:25.440
All right.

50:25.440 --> 50:27.760
Uh, what else do I want to say about my gaming week?

50:27.760 --> 50:29.280
Oh, I still have one more.

50:29.280 --> 50:34.200
I bought bravely default two, uh, on Nintendo switch and, uh, I haven't played a lot of

50:34.200 --> 50:35.200
it yet.

50:35.200 --> 50:40.160
I've only gone through, uh, that like very first boss fight where the team is still teaching

50:40.160 --> 50:41.520
you about boss fights.

50:41.520 --> 50:47.960
So I, I'm, I'm still very early into the game, but so far I am enjoying the actual game itself.

50:47.960 --> 50:51.960
The whole like job leveling, the, the battle system is very interesting where the whole

50:51.960 --> 50:56.200
like you kind of like stock up your turns, or if you're feeling very cocky or confident

50:56.200 --> 51:00.140
that you can finish the battle and in four turns, you just spend all your points and

51:00.140 --> 51:01.840
try to knock everything out.

51:01.840 --> 51:03.960
Um, there is a Bobby black Wolf mode.

51:03.960 --> 51:07.000
You can play on easy, uh, but I am playing on normal.

51:07.000 --> 51:11.940
Um, so I am enjoying it and, um, the story, you know, it's still early on, but it seems

51:11.940 --> 51:15.520
like it could go, the voice acting gets a little old, but I skipped most of it.

51:15.520 --> 51:19.520
Um, but the story so far seems like it could be interesting, very, very old school final

51:19.520 --> 51:23.120
fantasy so far anyway, again, I'm very early on in it.

51:23.120 --> 51:28.360
The one thing I am going to haze the game for a little bit though, um, it doesn't run

51:28.360 --> 51:29.360
great.

51:29.360 --> 51:33.940
Um, and that is kind of shocking for a game that's exclusive to switch to see things like

51:33.940 --> 51:41.400
frame skips and hiccups and like stuff that really shows how the switch is lagging behind

51:41.400 --> 51:42.640
other systems.

51:42.640 --> 51:48.720
Now maybe this is all when the switch pro comes out, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, bravely

51:48.720 --> 51:53.120
default two will run like butter on it, but I can't, I can't evaluate a system that ain't

51:53.120 --> 51:56.640
out or even announced yet as it is today.

51:56.640 --> 52:00.040
It's a little disappointing how kind of clunky it feels.

52:00.040 --> 52:06.820
Um, and uh, I gotta say, I think bravely default is really a game that's meant to be played

52:06.820 --> 52:08.720
in portable mode.

52:08.720 --> 52:15.040
I play it on the TV and when I do play it on the TV, I can see a lot of pixelization

52:15.040 --> 52:21.800
and like things that aren't very appealing when I'm in things like towns and stuff.

52:21.800 --> 52:26.400
And I'm not sure if that's supposed to be kind of intentionally the art style, um, which

52:26.400 --> 52:30.160
some of the fans may try to say, and that's fine, everybody can have their own opinion.

52:30.160 --> 52:31.600
I say it doesn't work.

52:31.600 --> 52:33.700
Um, and it, it looks, it looks old.

52:33.700 --> 52:35.280
It looks, uh, yeah.

52:35.280 --> 52:42.880
So some of those things are kind of annoying, um, but the game itself, the game mechanics

52:42.880 --> 52:47.960
and that whole thing are kind of strong enough for me to overlook that other stuff.

52:47.960 --> 52:53.080
I just hope there is a switch pro in the future that will not cause the game to like, you

52:53.080 --> 52:57.720
know, like literally stutter as I'm out in the overworld.

52:57.720 --> 53:01.400
It's it's kind of depressing that the game does that, honestly.

53:01.400 --> 53:02.400
All right.

53:02.400 --> 53:04.280
Um, let's move on.

53:04.280 --> 53:05.280
That's it for my gaming week.

53:05.280 --> 53:06.560
So I think that's all I have to say.

53:06.560 --> 53:08.940
Uh, I guess we'll get into some news, shall we?

53:08.940 --> 53:11.600
So Loki, why don't you start us off?

53:11.600 --> 53:12.640
All right.

53:12.640 --> 53:20.880
So, uh, you know, stonks, um, Roblox, the Roblox thing or Roblox corporation, I should

53:20.880 --> 53:23.320
say, uh, went public this week.

53:23.320 --> 53:32.120
I believe that was on the 10th and they had originally set out that their stock price

53:32.120 --> 53:38.160
was around, I think they were estimating $45 was originally what it was, uh, set the trade

53:38.160 --> 53:42.560
at, but then actually ended up trading around $70 at the end of the day.

53:42.560 --> 53:46.460
Um, so right now, though, they've, uh, raised quite a bit of money.

53:46.460 --> 53:55.440
So it's, you know, basically a valuation of about $45 billion, uh, which is huge because

53:55.440 --> 54:00.960
when you compare that to other companies like EA, for example, which is 37 billion or take

54:00.960 --> 54:08.260
two, which is 19 billion, um, that is quite a bit more, uh, considering, you know, it

54:08.260 --> 54:10.040
is a huge platform.

54:10.040 --> 54:15.560
I honestly think that this company is going to get, uh, too big for itself, uh, especially

54:15.560 --> 54:22.940
considering that like the rampant piracy of IP on the platform is going to, it's going

54:22.940 --> 54:24.480
to run into problems with that.

54:24.480 --> 54:29.300
I can see that at some point soon, um, wait, could you, could you do me a favor because

54:29.300 --> 54:30.360
you have kids?

54:30.360 --> 54:31.360
I don't have kids.

54:31.360 --> 54:32.360
Star soccer doesn't have kids.

54:32.360 --> 54:33.680
Could you do me a favor here?

54:33.680 --> 54:35.320
Explain Roblox Roblox.

54:35.320 --> 54:36.320
Like yeah.

54:36.320 --> 54:37.320
Okay.

54:37.320 --> 54:39.800
Why Roblox explain yourself.

54:39.800 --> 54:45.120
So Roblox is basically this platform that you go on there.

54:45.120 --> 54:49.980
It's free to play and you can actually play games.

54:49.980 --> 54:53.000
It looks similar to Lego a little bit.

54:53.000 --> 55:00.600
They have these really blocky, iconic characters that you play as, and what's unique about

55:00.600 --> 55:05.720
it though, is all of this content in, in these games are all user generated.

55:05.720 --> 55:14.000
So basically if I, I could go on there, develop a game in Lua and sell content on this platform

55:14.000 --> 55:16.760
and basically make money off of this platform.

55:16.760 --> 55:20.680
And a lot of people do that and it's gotten so big though.

55:20.680 --> 55:24.160
That's like, you know, they have merchandise like crazy.

55:24.160 --> 55:30.360
Um, there's just so much merchandise, toys, uh, I'm surprised they don't have like shows

55:30.360 --> 55:33.400
or anything yet, but it's, my kids play this constantly.

55:33.400 --> 55:38.520
It is like literally the only game that they play is Roblox aside from Minecraft occasionally,

55:38.520 --> 55:40.640
but mostly Roblox.

55:40.640 --> 55:48.400
And it's like the dumbest, I mean, it's like the stuff that they're playing is definitely

55:48.400 --> 55:56.800
made by kids or folks that are not used to game development is jank as fuck, but they're

55:56.800 --> 55:58.080
having fun with it.

55:58.080 --> 56:03.000
So that's fine, but there are some things that are very much like, you know, you need

56:03.000 --> 56:08.560
to pay Roblox, which is the in game currency to do different things.

56:08.560 --> 56:11.880
So I don't know.

56:11.880 --> 56:14.040
It's a huge, huge, huge platform.

56:14.040 --> 56:17.400
How is it different than Minecraft is absolutely different.

56:17.400 --> 56:20.080
So where's Minecraft is basically the same thing.

56:20.080 --> 56:25.760
You can kind of tweak it a little bit to, um, make your own stuff like your own levels

56:25.760 --> 56:26.960
and everything.

56:26.960 --> 56:31.920
This is basically like a sandbox.

56:31.920 --> 56:33.480
Think of like Gary's mod a little bit.

56:33.480 --> 56:34.680
So it's like a sandbox.

56:34.680 --> 56:39.280
You can build worlds with your own graphics, your own sound, whatever.

56:39.280 --> 56:43.200
Um, a lot of it's ripped off of IPs that they definitely don't own.

56:43.200 --> 56:47.680
Um, but you know, that's the least of it.

56:47.680 --> 56:48.680
Okay.

56:48.680 --> 56:52.840
The oof sound as iconic as it is in this game is the least of it.

56:52.840 --> 56:59.080
I mean, they're just ripping off anything you can imagine and just the most horrid combination

56:59.080 --> 57:04.680
of audio visuals in imaginable, but Bobby does point out in chat too.

57:04.680 --> 57:05.680
They worked there.

57:05.680 --> 57:07.200
They worked their oof out.

57:07.200 --> 57:10.280
I'm paraphrasing, but they worked it all at Tommy, Tommy and Roblox.

57:10.280 --> 57:11.280
They cool now.

57:11.280 --> 57:12.280
Anyway.

57:12.280 --> 57:13.280
Yes.

57:13.280 --> 57:16.160
So, um, it, but basically think of it as like a big platform.

57:16.160 --> 57:22.720
Like we've seen some of the stuff with like, um, project spark on the Microsoft, uh, platforms.

57:22.720 --> 57:24.800
There's this new thing that's through unreal.

57:24.800 --> 57:29.440
That's kind of like that as well, where you can build your own worlds and dreams, dreams

57:29.440 --> 57:34.000
probably be a little bit like dreams if you could monetize dreams and it looked way more

57:34.000 --> 57:40.500
jank than, uh, that is, you know, honest, honestly, I should probably decide to play

57:40.500 --> 57:41.500
a stream on Roblox.

57:41.500 --> 57:45.720
One of these days, uh, my kids keep asking me to do that, but like I've tried playing

57:45.720 --> 57:49.460
with them and it's the stuff that they play is just very janky.

57:49.460 --> 57:52.040
Like it bothers me how janky it is.

57:52.040 --> 57:55.200
And, uh, but I mean, someday I could do it.

57:55.200 --> 57:56.200
It's all in Lua.

57:56.200 --> 58:01.360
So it's pretty easy to script for it's just, I don't know Lua, so I'd have to learn that,

58:01.360 --> 58:05.400
but what better way to learn, um, getting you some other comments from chat.

58:05.400 --> 58:09.440
Zen monkey 11 says Roblox has nine versus nine multiplayer baseball.

58:09.440 --> 58:12.520
I'm unimpressed by that EA and two K won't ever do that.

58:12.520 --> 58:18.480
Uh, Questbuster says some Roblox users have made a living on making things on Roblox in

58:18.480 --> 58:19.480
the six figure range.

58:19.480 --> 58:20.480
Oh, well, there you go.

58:20.840 --> 58:22.360
Pixel poops Roblox edition.

58:22.360 --> 58:23.360
Get on it.

58:23.360 --> 58:24.360
Granted.

58:24.360 --> 58:27.200
Like, you know, I'm, I am making fun of the stuff that I see my kids play, but my kids

58:27.200 --> 58:28.800
play some really dumb stuff.

58:28.800 --> 58:33.480
Like there's actually like very polished things that are on this platform.

58:33.480 --> 58:36.140
Um, and there's some things that aren't very polished.

58:36.140 --> 58:40.500
Like for example, something that my kids are really into was piggy for a while and piggy

58:40.500 --> 58:49.000
is kind of like, if you combine five nights at Freddy's with Peppa pig, it was that if

58:49.000 --> 58:50.400
you can imagine that.

58:50.400 --> 58:52.520
I'd rather not.

58:52.520 --> 58:59.120
So it's, it's, there's a lot of weird stuff on there, but binary binary six, six, seven

58:59.120 --> 59:03.400
and chat says my daughter just likes doing the obstacle course stuff and is much better

59:03.400 --> 59:04.400
at it than I am.

59:04.400 --> 59:08.600
Hey, if anything binary, um, take comfort in the fact that when your daughter gets to

59:08.600 --> 59:12.160
be our age, like when your daughter's in her forties, um, she'll lose all that video game

59:12.160 --> 59:13.160
skill.

59:13.160 --> 59:14.160
Cause that's what happened to me.

59:14.160 --> 59:17.200
I used to be able to beat mega man too easy peasy.

59:17.200 --> 59:18.320
You know, no, no problem.

59:18.320 --> 59:19.320
Quick man stage.

59:19.320 --> 59:20.320
No problem.

59:20.320 --> 59:22.320
You do it now.

59:22.320 --> 59:23.440
Mess.

59:23.440 --> 59:26.600
So take comfort in that one day.

59:26.600 --> 59:32.280
She might be better than you now, but it won't last forever anyway.

59:32.280 --> 59:35.040
Nothing lasts forever.

59:35.040 --> 59:36.040
And not Roblox.

59:36.040 --> 59:37.040
That's for sure.

59:37.040 --> 59:38.040
All right.

59:38.040 --> 59:42.360
But it's, it's interesting just how much, you know, the Roblox was valued at.

59:42.360 --> 59:45.560
Like that was like four times the worth of Bethesda or something like that.

59:45.560 --> 59:46.560
It's crazy.

59:46.560 --> 59:47.560
Yeah.

59:47.560 --> 59:48.960
Well it could go down eventually.

59:48.960 --> 59:51.840
Like there's a lot of things that are overvalued right now.

59:51.840 --> 59:53.240
Um, GameStop.

59:53.240 --> 59:58.240
So true, but I'm on that ship, so it's all good.

59:58.240 --> 59:59.520
All right.

59:59.520 --> 01:00:00.520
To the moon, right?

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.520
Sweet money.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.520
Yeah.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.520
All right.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:07.000
Uh, let's talk about, Hey, one of the systems I know you can play Roblox on cause I think

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.360
like the five minutes I tried, tried Roblox and I was like, what the hell am I doing?

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.000
It was on my Xbox one.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:20.120
Well, the Xbox ones as well as Xbox series Xs, all the Xboxes, well from Xbox one, not

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:26.280
the 360 or the old one, but all the newer Xboxes are getting a new software update.

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:30.920
It will be adding some features, but it's also going to remove some features.

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.800
There's going to be a compatibility patch for the new Xbox wireless headset.

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:40.400
So that's kind of nice, but what they're getting rid of live TV listings in one guide.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:43.480
So you might remember, do you remember on the Xbox one, they really wanted you to hook

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:47.760
up your TV through, actually, some of you might still do this out there, honestly.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:48.760
And it's fine.

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:54.520
Um, yeah, I would do it too if I'd remembered to and I set up my TV, but, uh, there's not

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.640
going to be TV listings in one guide anymore.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.640
It's going away.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:02.120
So no, no TV guide channel built into your, do people even know what that is anymore?

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:06.280
I don't know, but that the listings will not be built in to the Xbox.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:11.480
You're going to have to rely on most TVs have that built in now though my, uh, my television

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.720
has that built into it, which is weird.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:16.400
So I guess just went a different place.

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:22.120
So, uh, you, the one guide will still stay so you can watch TV through HDMI.

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:25.600
So like it's not suddenly shutting off your ability to actually watch TV.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:28.320
It's just the schedules are actually going away.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:32.440
Now other big features that are coming in the March update, you can actually enable

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:36.440
or disable the auto HDR and FPS boost.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:38.960
That was what I was trying to think of earlier, the frame boost.

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:44.240
So if a game supports it, you can boost the frame rate up to even possibly 120 frames

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.840
per second, just depending on what game you're playing.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.240
So that's kind of cool.

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.200
Some other minor tweaks, including achievements, going back to the mobile app, uh, and things

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.200
like that.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:56.760
But that is a big Xbox console update that is on its way.

01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:02.120
Um, DJ Rama S talking about the TV thing says, I did that.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:06.560
I used to have my Fios box connected to my Xbox, but I had to remove that connection

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:12.280
because I now have a 4k TV and that Xbox HDMI input isn't 4k.

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:14.600
Oh, I didn't realize that.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:18.440
That's probably a big ouch as to why a lot of TV people aren't using that now.

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:20.000
Um, let's see.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.200
Uh, Zen monkey 11 says I was born in 2000.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:27.000
What's a TV guide?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Don't do this.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.360
Did you, are you, are you really going to choose violence today?

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:39.320
Um, look it up on Wikipedia.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.320
Get off my lawn.

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:46.440
Uh, bonds double six says Pluto TV for now I, yeah, Pluto TV is, is an Xbox app and I've

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:47.440
used that too.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:51.680
I mentioned a clue earlier and there's a lot of, they have a lot of interesting channels.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:55.880
They used to have a RuPaul's drag race channel that just showed nothing but drag race all

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:56.880
day.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:59.040
That went away probably because of the paramount thing.

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.560
But they do have as well, but they have a survivor channel, which is also a CBS, but

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:05.040
they have a survivor channel, which plays nothing but old.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.880
I'm talking like old.

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:11.560
I saw survivor, the Australian outback on it the other day, like old ass episodes of

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:12.560
survivor.

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:13.560
They just play all day long.

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:14.560
So it's kind of fun.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:15.560
So, all right.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:16.560
Oh, good.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.760
Uh, Zen monkey 11 says I'm joking.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:18.880
I wasn't born in 2000.

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:22.560
Oh, you did choose violence today, didn't you?

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.560
Liar.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:24.560
All right.

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:28.440
Anyway, that's the Xbox March update before I fight, fight our chatters.

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:31.640
Moving on to our next story, dark Sakura.

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:36.960
Well, one of my favorite ever game series are the teenage mutant Ninja Turtles arcade

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.920
ones like turtles in time.

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:42.760
And the first one that came out, those are, have always been like some of my favorites.

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:51.120
And so there is a new one coming out in the same vein as those others.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:57.560
It's going to be called a teenage mutant Ninja Turtles shredders revenge.

01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:59.320
And it's actually looking pretty neat.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:05.640
And on top of that, you can play as all four turtles and splinter and April, although I

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:07.240
don't see any Casey Jones anywhere.

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:11.040
I don't know what's going on with that.

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.280
But it looks, it looks really good.

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.440
It's a 2d fighter.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:17.840
The characters have really great personality.

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:20.680
Everything looks really awesome.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:27.800
I'm, I'm really, really hoping that that this does well, that it gives us more like that,

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:34.120
but it's the same, uh, uh, you know, uh, group that did like wonder boy, the dragons trap,

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.600
you know, so, oh, I didn't realize it was them.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.120
Oh, that was a good conversion tribute games.

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.920
Nice.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.200
Yeah.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:47.040
So, um, so I'm really looking forward to it.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:51.920
I mean, we pretty much like, Dan was like the other day, Hey, there's a new teenage mutant

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:52.160
turtles.

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:52.600
Look at this.

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.360
And I'm like, Ooh, yeah.

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:57.680
So they really hit that sweet spot of just giving us what we want.

01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:02.400
You know, like when people think of the Ninja Turtles video game, they think of that, you know, even the

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:08.120
guy born in 2000 thinks of the old school nineties, pizzeria arcade game.

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:13.440
Like, yes, I know there's been other Ninja Turtles games, but none of them have captured quite the magic

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:16.760
that that, cause they don't ask about the later Ninja Turtles games.

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:21.920
Everybody asks about, you remember, you remember that nineties Ninja Turtles game that we played at the

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:22.360
arcade.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.960
You remember that one with the four players, unfortunately.

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:26.280
So I'm glad they're kind of going back to the formula that works.

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:30.560
And I think it's really smart because this isn't in an arcade and you can do a little more with it.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:34.200
I think it's really smart for them to think about what if we did other characters, I don't think they've

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:36.080
confirmed the April and shredder thing.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.240
People are kind of reading into it from the trailer.

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:42.480
Well, they were in, they were in, uh, the preview fighting.

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:42.880
Yeah.

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.760
So, so, so people are assuming that you can play as them because they're fighting.

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:49.200
Um, but I think that's, I think that's great.

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:54.600
I think that's a great way to kind of expand on the idea without changing the idea.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:06:00.800
Like, I didn't realize I want to play as April O'Neill in the Ninja Turtles game until you showed me that.

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:07.160
Now I'm like, Oh, I want to do that April O'Neill too with that hideous, that hideous yellow jacket.

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:11.560
Yeah, this is totally nineties Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:15.720
So, um, I mean, Tiger call was talking about it being in the eighties.

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:18.480
Uh, the, the series was not eighties.

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:19.120
It was nineties.

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:22.240
Um, I think it was on that bubble.

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.880
I think like season one was like 89.

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:27.680
Like, but we're, we're, we're nickel and diamond at this point.

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:36.880
So now if they were going to do eighties though, it would be cool if there's like a bloody, all red bandana mode, you know, that's got like,

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.040
Oh, you want to go comics?

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.280
I'm going comics with this one.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:42.120
All right.

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:42.720
All right.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:43.240
Yeah.

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:47.080
Cause that's the original, that is the absolutely original.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:52.000
But that, but again, this is the one that people really remember, you know, that era of the,

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:57.200
the cartoon that folks are saying came out in late 87, whatever.

01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:57.920
All right.

01:06:58.880 --> 01:06:59.840
It's it was on the boat.

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:01.520
It was on for so long.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:04.120
Most people probably picked it up in reruns in the nineties.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.880
You know, it's, there's a lot of that type of stuff.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:07.840
I was watching it with my brothers.

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:08.440
Yeah.

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:12.560
So, uh, honestly I was watching it more than my brothers.

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:15.440
I think it looks great and I'm excited.

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:21.360
Uh, I, I did not make the connection that the wonder, uh, wonderboy trap, the dragons trap people were doing it.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.800
And that makes me even more excited.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:28.800
Like there's just certain studios that are getting the retro re the blaster master zero folks, another one of them.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.800
They're just getting the remakes.

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:31.320
Right.

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.280
Like they're doing the retro remakes.

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:33.800
Right.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.200
And that's very exciting.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.560
So awesome.

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:39.440
You know, I would still think it would be fun though.

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:45.920
I mean, I love that they're going off of the previous games, you know, like the one, the arcade games that we have.

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:56.480
I honestly would also really like to see the similar type of game, but in the IDW universe, because there's some really neat characters in the IDW comics right now.

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:59.600
That's I've actually been reading that fairly religiously.

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:01.720
All right.

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.320
Anyway, this is still making me happy.

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:04.600
So no, it's all good.

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:08.360
I think that trailer made a lot of people happy because it was also, it's just unexpected.

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:13.680
Like, you know, it kind of came out of nowhere that like, Hey, by the way, there's a new Ninja Turtles game coming.

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:15.760
And it's old school.

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:21.240
Here we are on Mario day and I'm expecting Mario announcements and all we get is Ninja Turtles.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:24.880
It's like, geez, but I'll tell you, I didn't even realize I'm dressed for Mario day.

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:28.360
I'm wearing my Mario shirt today on stream for those watching on Twitch.

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:30.360
I just realized I've had this shirt forever.

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:32.520
The shirt is very old, but it's one of my faves.

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:33.440
All right.

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:35.320
It is not as old as Mario three.

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:37.480
Um, but probably close.

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:39.360
All right, let's move on.

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:40.280
Uh, okay.

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:47.640
Loki, this is another one you're going to have to explain because this, this doesn't make sense, but can you try to make sense of it?

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:48.800
Loki, this next story.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:57.920
So, yeah, so the big, like buzzword this week has been NFT, which is non fungible tokens.

01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:02.160
So it's basically, I got an, I got NFT for this.

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:03.040
No fucking time.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:08.000
It's basically what it is.

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:18.800
Is like, you know how with Bitcoin, there's kind of the blockchain, the track who has, um, possession of a specific Bitcoin at any time.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:24.600
And so you can track that actually being able to take a digital good and have ownership of it.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:26.320
So that's kind of what it is.

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:39.600
So people now are selling all sorts of dumb things as NFTs, um, everything from like, just like artwork to really dumb things.

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:44.640
Like I saw someone that took a picture of their scrotum and they are selling as an F T.

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:50.920
So, um, obviously folks are really trying to cash in on this right now.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:52.680
Um, was it a nice scrotum?

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:54.360
Don't answer, don't answer.

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.800
It's iDubbbz from, it's iDubbbz.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.080
Was it FreshlyShorn?

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.800
He just did the bat wing thing.

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:04.480
So it was tastefully, the sun was coming through it.

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:05.720
You could see the veins and everything.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.040
Okay, enough.

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:14.760
Anyways, so they, they're selling like, was it a Beeple?

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.400
I don't know if you know of Beeple.

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:17.760
Was it a Beeple?

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.360
I don't know if you know of Beeple.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:27.120
There, Beeple is a, uh, an artist who actually puts out, he put a new piece of art every day for like 15 years.

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.080
So he sold his collection of art.

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:40.080
Um, and there's one massive, like huge image for 69, I think it was like $69 million, some ridiculous amount of money that people pay for that.

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:45.360
And what you get is basically like a digital image, but you own it.

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:51.600
Which I don't understand that in the sense that, um, it's a digital image.

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:52.920
I mean, I can make copies of it.

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:57.320
I can just do whatever, but apparently it's somehow you get ownership of it.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:02.640
So I don't really know how that works, but it's the thing that people are trying to make money off of right now.

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:05.440
The certificate of authenticity is yours.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:15.240
I mean, in theory, I get the NFT thing in theory as like a way to support artists, especially during this difficult time.

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.560
We're going to art galleries, maybe doesn't work.

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:28.120
So if the artist chooses to use this as a way to drive sales so that they can buy food and pay rent, I don't have a problem with that.

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:29.360
And I'm not going to shade that.

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.800
Where this is getting out of control is this shit I'm hearing about.

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:33.240
Like what?

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:39.360
You can go on Twitter, tag a certain account and like, cause I hear people are doing this to like get this Twitter account.

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:51.280
They're, they're tagging like Disney and Marvel tweets as NFT and trying to sell those to get the Disney and Marvel lawyers to like shut NFT down as if you could do that.

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:51.680
I don't know.

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:57.480
Like if somebody tried to sell OLR, like one of our episodes is NFT.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:04.400
I'm going to tell you here and now that they don't mean shit unless they're coming from us and we say we're selling it.

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:07.200
And like, then those NFTs are garbage.

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.280
They don't mean anything.

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.600
And I don't think we have a plan to do that.

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:14.440
Although, I mean, like if the price was right, maybe, but I just don't, I don't, what, what's the point?

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:18.840
You could own Orange On Radio episode 860, but what's, what's the point?

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:24.000
If you want to support us, you, which you certainly don't have to, we've been doing this show for free for years.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:28.720
You, you guys know plenty of other, you can do the subs, you can do the biddies, you know, all that stuff that you do on Twitch.

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:29.240
That's lovely.

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:29.840
That's wonderful.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.720
You don't have to, but a lot of you do, and we love that and appreciate that.

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.760
You can do the merchandise at vognetwork.com slash shop, cheap plug.

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.040
You don't have to, but we love it when you do.

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:57.960
Um, I just, but if somebody were to try to like make OLR NFTs outside of us and like Bobby and Jason and people that would maybe have a little bit of a right to state claim to a little bit of OLR outside of that bubble, like, no, like don't do that.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.440
Like it's, can't, can't I just say it's worthless?

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:01.720
It's it, I don't know.

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:02.240
It's weird.

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:04.600
I find the whole tagging things.

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:05.920
Anything is NFT.

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.280
Your balls is NFT.

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.240
I find that very strange.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.040
I think it's a technology that needs to be perfected.

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:14.480
Yeah.

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:17.320
So anyways, uh, getting back to gaming though.

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:23.440
So one example of some, um, indie game companies to kind of take advantage of this.

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:36.560
So there was this game, uh, called, uh, this, uh, guy, uh, was a company, Roarer, um, who was a creator of indie games, like the passage, the castle doctrine and one hour, one life.

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:53.840
So he put out an NFT auction called the crypto doctrine, and there was 155 paintings that he had originally commissioned for the use of in the castle doctrine, which is a game about home defense, I guess.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:04.160
And anyways, inside that, um, so he was auctioning off these 145 paintings, but the folks that made those paintings, the individual artists.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:13.240
Didn't have any idea that he was doing this and basically said, no, Hey, I didn't consent to selling the art as an NFT, though.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:19.400
I'm not sure if you commissioned something, if you really have control on over what it can and cannot be used for.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:24.920
And in the sense that you're using a promote promotional materials for your game, I don't know.

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:28.080
That doesn't make any sense to me, but that's between the artist and the buyer.

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:28.960
Exactly.

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:34.400
So apparently a lot of the creators with that, you know, were unaware that they were doing that.

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:50.520
Um, there is also, um, let's see what else, uh, lots of folks just basically, you know, and I think this kind of goes back to, we were talking about the Twitter stuff where people are just being able to tag an account and sell it as an NFT.

01:14:51.120 --> 01:15:00.800
A lot of like content that they're not really sure who is the owner of it in trying to sell it now as an NFT, because Taco Bell is selling NFTs.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:07.320
I mean, so yeah, it's just no, no, no fucking tacos.

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:09.120
Yeah.

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:13.680
And the thing with that too, it's like these NFTs, like you could have some really cool stuff with it.

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:22.800
Like say if we had an OLR NFT or something like that, where like you buy those and then it gets you access to special things or something like that.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:23.960
That'd be pretty cool.

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:26.480
But that is literally a Twitch subscription.

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:28.440
That is literally what that will do.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:29.040
Yeah.

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:31.960
But the truth, but this is going to be more expensive.

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:33.800
So, okay.

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:34.440
I see.

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:37.240
Well then sub at the $20 level.

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:39.360
I'm not going to stop anyone from doing that.

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:43.000
No, you need to go higher millions.

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:48.080
Anyways, yeah, well, and okay.

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:56.320
So aside from all the stupidness that's along with that, then there's also the talk about the whole blockchain technology.

01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:12.480
And so how energy inefficient it is and how, especially with crypto mining is literally using tons of electricity to make these calculations to see, to calculate the blockchain.

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:21.480
And so it's causing issues with pollution even because of all the electricity that it's being used up to do this.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:34.840
So that's also another thing that folks are kind of, kind of basic climbing down on all sorts of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology because of stuff like this.

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:36.680
So I don't know, it's messy.

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:47.520
I don't really know what we can really use this for, but certainly I don't have anything that interests me as far as the NFTs that have been offered so far.

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:54.560
I mean, I just, I don't see what the point is in owning like a one of a kind digital item that doesn't make any sense.

01:16:55.400 --> 01:17:03.760
IceP1 in chat, love that name, says, one of the things NFTs can do is earn the originator or royalty.

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:13.120
And I do want to emphasize, and I think Loki feels this way too, is that again, to support artists who are struggling right now in the times of COVID.

01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:17.720
Again, the arrangement between the buyer and the artist is between the buyer and the artist.

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:25.320
And if that arrangement is I'm giving you this special token, that means this is yours and for everybody else, it's just a copy.

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:28.040
If and that's something they agree to, then that's fine.

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:29.200
I don't have a problem with that.

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:30.520
I don't think anybody has a problem with that.

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:42.040
Where shit gets weird is where anybody can tag something as an NFT and these things that aren't really art, like Jack's first tweet is an NFT.

01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:42.720
Why?

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:44.480
And Jack doesn't need the money.

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.040
You know that, that he, he might've been doing it for charity.

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:53.280
If he did, if he's doing it for charity, I'll, I'll, I'll back off a little bit on what I just said.

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:57.480
Um, but I think, I think you kind of hopefully see the difference here.

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:03.720
You know, when it's a, when it's a struggling artist finding a new inventive way, like it's, it's their version of a Twitch sub or whatever it is.

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:05.040
An NFT is cool.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:18.560
Like I might even look into that for, for an artist who I really like, but for like, you know, tagging random tweets and everything on the internet, video game art, you had nothing to do with and labeling that an NFT.

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:21.160
That's where it's like, okay, this shit is out of control.

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:27.280
Like, and you're just begging for this to be regulated, which you probably, nobody's going to win in that scenario.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.000
If that makes sense.

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:28.720
I hope that makes sense.

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:35.600
So I hope, hope that kind of makes our stance clear where it's like, where we, where we are making fun of NFT or where we are not making fun of NFT.

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:36.480
I hope that's kind of clear.

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:38.600
So anything you want to add to that Loki?

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.000
I, I get it good.

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:41.960
I think that's about it.

01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:42.400
Yeah.

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:43.320
All right.

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:44.880
Well then let's move on.

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:48.840
Let's move on to something that I think a lot of people are going to have a hard time understanding.

01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:59.080
And that is, uh, this Twitch program that's happening behind the scenes about scoring streamers to possibly be used with ad sales.

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:01.000
So let me talk about what's going on.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:05.640
So there's something that's happening behind the scenes called the brand safety score.

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:19.280
It was found in Twitch's internal API by Twitter user Tayari CS, who talked about a little bit, wrote some tweets about it and actually posted pictures of the change log on Twitter.

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:28.040
Now, Twitch, you know, because they, they probably weren't really ready to talk about this, but then why do you put the code out in live if you don't want it to be found?

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:40.920
Cause there are people that do this, uh, Twitch did put a statement on it saying we are exploring ways to improve the experience on Twitch for viewers and creators, including efforts to better match the appropriate ads to the right communities.

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.320
User privacy is critical on Twitch.

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:48.080
And as we refine the process, we will not pursue plans that compromise that priority.

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:49.560
Nothing is launched yet.

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:54.280
No personal information was shared and we will keep our community informed of any updates along the way.

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:58.600
The original tweet by Tayari CS, uh, was a series of tweets.

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:11.680
The first one reading Twitch has added an automatic brand safety score, which grades how brand friendly every streamer is based on things like chat behavior, ban history, manual ratings by Twitch staff.

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:12.920
Games played.

01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:14.520
Times could say the N word.

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:20.080
Age, you honestly shouldn't be on Twitch if the answer is one, to be honest.

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.200
But anyway, that's another story.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:31.120
Uh, games played, age, auto, if the answer is one and you are in a group that is not supposed to say that word, just to make that very clear.

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:31.720
All right.

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:34.320
Games played, age, auto mod, and more.

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:36.040
Uh, and so on.

01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:50.760
Um, it's kind of like that whole argument that's going on about use of the LGBTQ tag because unfortunately Twitch currently, or at least of a few days ago and Dark Sakura try to.

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:52.640
You're not going to like this.

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:54.200
I'm just, don't shoot the messenger.

01:20:54.880 --> 01:21:05.040
Twitch unfortunately has labeled that LGBTQIA is okay for allies to use because for some people, the A means allies.

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:10.120
It, the A, just to be clear, actually stands for asexual.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:10.600
Okay.

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:11.960
Just, just so we're all clear on this.

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:25.040
Um, but this has caused people to kind of ask Twitch or, or, or some people who are using the LGBTQIA tag on their streams are saying, I'm doing this because I want people to know that this is a safe space.

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:30.880
This is a place that, you know, LGBTQ people can be and, and they're accepted and I'm not going to judge them or that stuff.

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:37.720
And my response to that is, you know, again, when you're well intentioned, I'm not going to attack dog you.

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:40.400
So I'm not going to attack dog anybody who does that.

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:59.240
But my simple answer would be, if your space is not welcoming to diverse groups, including LGBTQIA, including issues of race, including issues of gender, including if, if your space is not welcoming to that, then why the fuck are you allowed on Twitch in the first place?

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:05.080
Just, just a question I'd like to know the answer to.

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:12.520
If, if you are, if you are a dangerous place for LGBTQ or any of that, why are you on Twitch in the first, you shouldn't be here.

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.640
Just making that clear.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:33.440
Anyway, I think it would be great personally, if Twitch brought back the Twitch unity tag, because I felt that was a very good all encompassing tag to sort of show that you as a streamer accept a certain set of values and that you're going to enforce those values on your stream.

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:38.840
In my personal opinion, they should bring that tag back, but I don't, I don't work at Twitch.

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:39.440
So whatever.

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:42.480
Anyway, I'm sorry I got on a tangent, but it was an important one.

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:56.720
Um, now going back to the tweet, uh, the brand safety score talks about if, uh, you know, a streamer is ranked based on their age, like if they're over 18 or 21, what's their suspension history like, what's their relationship history with Twitch and so forth.

01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:05.840
I don't think people should be too freaked out about this, although certainly not everybody's going to like the whole big brother is watching you kind of thing.

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:06.960
You know what I mean?

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:21.000
Like people are not going to like that they're being ranked behind the scenes and all this stuff, but I get that Twitch is doing it because if there is a streamer out there that is very nasty towards certain minority communities.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.200
Again, I want to know why they're on Twitch to begin with, but fine.

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:34.680
Different topic, but there's going to be advertisers that don't want to advertise with that audience because they don't want their products associated with that, right?

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:37.280
Because what always happens with boycotts, right?

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:40.360
When you decide you're going to boycott Fox News or something, who do they go after?

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:41.680
The advertisers, right?

01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:57.040
So I think Twitch is kind of trying to create that environment for the advertisers, basically, so that they can somewhat guarantee that they're not going to be having their advertisements on streams run by assholes.

01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:01.480
Again, why do assholes get to stream on Twitch?

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:07.040
Freedom of speech doesn't apply here at Twitch Amazon private company.

01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:09.400
It's a yeah, it's a private company.

01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:12.680
There's absolutely nothing that a person could complain about.

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:16.240
I mean, well, they could complain about it, but it's not going to do anything.

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:17.480
There's no legal precedents.

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:18.080
Right.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:25.920
So anyway, um, DJ Obama S in chat says, I second that on both podcasts and Twitch streams.

01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:26.400
I do.

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:32.960
I have staffers that represent LGBTQ, but as a straight cis male, I won't use it for that reason alone.

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:39.040
Um, that, and we don't, we don't use that tag here, even though I'm gay, Dark Soccer's asexual.

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.360
She's talked about that before.

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:44.840
Um, Loki is our token cis, cis hetero white dude.

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:53.080
Um, you know, it's, but we don't use that tag because it's not that a, it's not all that what the show is about.

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:57.800
B, um, not all of us are directly LGBTQ and so forth.

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:02.120
But if there was a Twitch unity tag, I'd be happy to use that.

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:08.200
Because I do think this show subscribes to certain standards where everybody is welcome here.

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:12.480
You know, I know we use the tagline where every gamer has a voice a lot here.

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:17.000
Um, I think another tagline, although we don't own this, we didn't start this, but I love it.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.800
And I embrace it is that gaming is for everyone, period.

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:25.000
And I think that's a standard that we, uh, subscribe to here at OLR.

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:28.240
So yes, Act F says Loki is here and supportive.

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:30.360
Yes, Loki is awesome.

01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:31.320
Loki is awesome.

01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:33.320
On this show, Loki is awesome off this show.

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:36.400
I'm not going to inflate his ego too much, but Loki is amazing.

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.160
And OLR wouldn't be the same without him.

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:38.720
We all know that.

01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:39.720
All right.

01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:45.120
Um, you know, he's not LGBTQ, but nobody's perfect.

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:46.960
All right.

01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:47.880
Sorry.

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:49.840
All right.

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:50.880
Anyway.

01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:52.360
Uh, all right.

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.280
Let's move on.

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:55.400
Uh, I think I said enough.

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:57.840
I I've gone on too many tangents from that story.

01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:58.920
So let's go to the next one.

01:25:58.920 --> 01:25:59.680
Dark Sakura.

01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:05.160
So, um, Squinnix has some news for us.

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:05.760
Yay.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:11.080
Well, actually we're going to be, um, getting more information about it on the

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:16.560
18th, but they are going to show some details on the next life is strange game.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:22.360
Um, there's going to be a 40 minutes starting at 1 PM Eastern, um, to, you

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:27.960
know, go with all the upcoming games are going to be, um, and they're also talking

01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:30.360
about an April 1st release date.

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:37.400
Um, also the game, uh, Outriders will be included with, with that conversation.

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:40.080
Interesting.

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:43.240
I think some people are blowing this way out of proportion because

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:46.080
Square Enix announced an event and now people are like, oh, they're

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:47.200
going to show final fantasy.

01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:52.080
A lot of people are totally into life is strange.

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:56.120
And I think that it's definitely gonna, you know, raise some hype.

01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:57.240
Oh, for sure.

01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:57.640
Yeah.

01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:59.000
People are super into that series.

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:02.760
There was a spinoff game too, that was in the, the lion.

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:03.680
I can't remember the name of it.

01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:05.520
Somebody in shadow shouted out, I'm sure.

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:09.440
Um, and I imagine maybe, maybe because of the popularity of life is strange,

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:15.280
maybe Square Enix, maybe, maybe bolded underlined has other type of those like

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:22.200
narrative games maybe in process and who knows they could tie into other IPs, but

01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:25.680
I'm, I'm, I'm setting these real like tinfoil hat, crazy expectations.

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:27.280
I don't think anyone should go into this with.

01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:29.480
I think this is something for the life of strange fans.

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:33.080
I think, um, you know, people that are into the series will be very happy with this.

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:36.720
Other people should not expect things outside of that.

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:39.440
Outside of what dark soccer just mentioned with the

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:40.640
outsiders and all that stuff.

01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:41.760
This is yeah.

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:48.640
Pretty much going to be a fairly specific type of release, if that makes sense.

01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:52.040
So series of releases.

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:52.840
Yeah.

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:55.440
Well, yeah, because they're episodic games.

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:59.120
So there will certainly be probably three or five of them, just depending on how

01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:01.160
many episodes they, they end up doing with that.

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:02.600
So, all right.

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:06.600
As soon as Matt Chat says Square Enix, it's totally not a direct event.

01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:10.720
No, I think, I think your big news on other games, you know, obviously they've

01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:14.040
been peppered other places like the Nintendo direct had a lot of Square Enix

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:17.360
news in it, PlayStation had a huge Square Enix news thing in it.

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.840
Um, but look, look for June.

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:24.600
You know, June is when they'll, they'll do another big update for E3.

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:28.440
I'm using my Cody fingers or whatever that turns out to look like.

01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:31.960
So, all right, let's move on Loki.

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:33.960
All right.

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:40.800
Uh, so we've always heard so many stories of devs having to work

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:43.680
through not ideal conditions.

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:45.840
And here's some more stories about that.

01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:52.440
So, uh, Capcom had their employees working at the office, um,

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:57.680
apparently after a cyber attack and also, um, in the office,

01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:00.120
despite the COVID restrictions.

01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:04.440
So apparently this is coming from a whistleblower report that claims

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:08.520
that the actual conditions for game developers at the company, uh, were

01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:14.480
less than ideal and apparently Capcom had suffered a cyber attack with a

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:18.600
one terabyte of the employee and customer data stolen due to this attack.

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:23.920
Capcom wasn't able to safely have, uh, their external network secured

01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.720
and have employees work remotely.

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:31.600
So in that case, they had idea to have them, uh, it says we're abandoning

01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:35.000
the remote network for the time and have decided that there is no

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.520
choice, but to come to work.

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:42.840
And because of that, of course, folks were anxious, um, because of, you

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:46.600
know, distancing and everything may not be possible in that type of an

01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:51.480
environment to be able to, um, you know, isolate yourself enough

01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:53.200
without, you know, contaminating.

01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:56.480
We've heard so many reports of different workplaces, you know,

01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:58.200
having COVID spread through there.

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:05.800
But yeah, apparently, um, you know, they Capcom did respond saying, you

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:09.720
know, while there are none currently active within the company, employees

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:14.800
are free to form labor unions and Capcom strictly observes all relevant

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:18.760
laws and regulations regarding employees forming unions, Capcom is committed to

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:20.880
strictly observing all laws and regulations.

01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:21.280
Wow.

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:24.840
That sounds like a lot of, uh, lawyer PRSP.

01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:27.240
That's a very interesting statement.

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:31.640
I just, just the fact that they're like, go ahead, form a union.

01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:33.200
Do it, do it, bitch.

01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:33.760
Do it.

01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:38.600
Well, cause cause there's been a lot of talk about the, these, um, employees

01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:43.960
like in, in Gerald is forming a union because of the, um, to try to get

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:45.320
better working conditions.

01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:49.120
So that it was kind of weird that that was the first thing that came to their

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:51.200
head when I'm talking about that stuff.

01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:54.760
But yeah, I don't know.

01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:59.760
It, it seems like, cause the punishment's not enough for these companies that

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:02.560
they're just going to go ahead and risk their employees because they see them as

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:08.040
just, you know, um, I'm surprised, I'm surprised we haven't seen an employee

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:10.000
who caught COVID Sue their employer.

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:12.720
Um, maybe, maybe it has happened.

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:16.160
I'm sure that it's probably happened.

01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:20.440
I mean, especially in like, you know, these Amazon warehouses and stuff like

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:25.520
that, somebody, I mean, God, there's so many terrible working conditions with that.

01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:28.240
I'm not saying, I'm not automatically saying, Oh, they should win.

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:30.920
And also I'm just saying, I'm surprised in this Sue happy U S of

01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:33.400
a that we live in, we haven't seen, but you're right.

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:34.240
It probably has happened.

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:35.920
I'm just not paying enough attention, which is fair.

01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:41.520
And then along with that though, we also had the developers of star citizen,

01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:46.880
um, kind of fed up that they had to work during the, uh, that huge

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:49.320
snow storm that was in Texas.

01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:56.160
And, um, apparently, you know, they were trying to juggle work and also,

01:31:56.200 --> 01:32:00.760
um, you know, safety because, you know, a lot of the roads and everything were

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:02.720
closed and power outages and all that.

01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:10.480
Um, basically, you know, there is a lot of, you know, issues with, you know,

01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:14.760
just being able to safely travel and the fact that they're having to

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:18.280
come into work, um, is concerning.

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:22.920
Of course, CIG, uh, did come out and provide a statement saying our staff

01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:25.960
safety and wellbeing are priority to us at all times.

01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:30.840
And since the Austin offices, we had remained close to general staff since

01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:34.360
the beginning of the pandemic, the teams working from home in the immediate

01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:38.720
aftermath of the Texas storm, the studio leadership reached out to all 100 plus

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:42.960
employees through their managers individually, the offer support, of

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:48.640
course, you know, that doesn't really explain why they're coming into the

01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:49.280
office.

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:54.160
Um, I don't know that stuff is dangerous.

01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:57.200
I mean, lots of people die during that snow storm, just because of all the

01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:59.920
power outages, not being able to stay warm and everything.

01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:02.200
So I don't know why you would even risk it.

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:04.720
And during a pandemic, but again, it's Texas and they have the

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:05.640
whole state opening up.

01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:06.320
So who knows?

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:07.040
Who knows?

01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:11.760
Um, Bobby in chat, uh, with a good, uh, uh, follow up to what my, my question

01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:13.840
I asked a lot about, um, suing employers.

01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:17.760
Bobby says, uh, one of the things in the original economic relief bill that I

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:21.600
believe got taken out was to make companies not liable if their employees

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:24.720
caught COVID at work, it didn't make it in the final bill, but they tried.

01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:25.880
And I was like, that's right.

01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:30.600
I do remember that being, that being a thing, um, that they tried to put that

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:32.640
in there and thankfully it didn't go through.

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:36.320
I think in, you know, you gotta, you kind of walk a fine line.

01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:39.320
This is an opinion, but I think especially in some of these cases that

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:42.200
Loki's pointing out, like, especially the star citizen thing, which isn't

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:46.480
even related to COVID, but like if your employer knowingly and willingly put

01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:51.920
you in danger in a dangerous situation, um, and you have an injury because of

01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:57.600
that, I kind of think like, you ought to have some type of legal recourse

01:33:57.640 --> 01:33:59.240
through that, but that's my opinion.

01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:00.880
And I get to have an opinion.

01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:06.440
Um, so anyway, I just, I just can't believe a video game is worth that.

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:10.240
Cause you know, again, I didn't experience that Texas stuff firsthand,

01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:11.680
but I had a lot of friends that did.

01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:14.600
And, um, it sounded, it sounded horrible.

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:16.760
Like I don't really have any other word to describe it.

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:18.200
It just sounded horrible.

01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:21.200
And I'm so sorry to my friends that had to go through that whole situation.

01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:24.000
Um, and we can point the finger and we can blame all we want.

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.960
Um, but I'm not going to do that right now.

01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:29.000
But what I am going to do is just express the frustration that

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.880
like a fricking video game.

01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:35.200
Getting made was that important to put people's lives further

01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:37.400
at risk in a horrible situation.

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:39.840
Yeah, that is crazy.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:40.280
Yeah.

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:41.640
All right.

01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:43.920
Disgusting is what it is.

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:44.720
It is.

01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:48.040
Um, as Joan had a mat chat says, I work in live TV realm.

01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:51.400
I have had to come into work during snow storms, hurricanes, whole city blackouts.

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:55.200
I was never forced to come into work per se, but you feel that employee politics

01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:58.880
pressure, you bring up a very interesting point though, and I don't know how far

01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:04.080
down this rabbit hole I want to go, but I think in certain industries, you know,

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:08.040
there's going to be certain risks and I think the world of live TV, and I only

01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:14.240
say this because again, I don't work in live TV, but I did, I wanted to, at one

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:18.080
point I wanted to be a reporter, actually, I wanted to be a weatherman and I interned

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:19.920
at a CBS station for a little while.

01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:23.240
And they got to talk to a lot of reporters about their lives and so forth.

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:28.080
And I sort of think like if I had, and maybe part of the reason I didn't go into

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:33.000
that life was because there were certain things about it maybe I wasn't really

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:39.280
willing to go for, you know, like the excitement of, and I mean the excitement

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:44.840
of finding a dead body because it's going to make a big story that, that, that whole

01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:48.920
experience still to this day sits really weird with me and I'm not sure that was

01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:49.960
really for me.

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:52.240
And again, I'm not, I mean, look, look, people watch it.

01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:55.400
I understand that's the industry and that's not your industry, Matt, that

01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:59.240
brought that up, but like it's just, there's certain things you kind of know

01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:02.600
you're gonna put up with to be in certain areas.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:08.480
Making video games and risking your life for it is not one of them.

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:12.320
But like if you go into the field to be a TV reporter, you probably know they're

01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:14.720
going to send you to the middle of a hurricane too, right?

01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:15.520
Cause right, right.

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:18.920
When you turn on CNN or whatever it is you watch in one of those hurricanes,

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.440
there's always some poor reporter there that looks like they're about to blow

01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:24.920
away, you know, because they, you got, you got to see it firsthand, right?

01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:27.480
So anyway, yeah.

01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:31.080
Um, SHO 100, Matt in chat says, exactly.

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:34.200
You kind of accept that risk and they kind of put that risk in front of you.

01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:34.520
Yeah.

01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:36.000
So it's, it's crazy stuff.

01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:36.240
All right.

01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:37.080
Anyway, sorry.

01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:38.720
We're, we're a little far down the rabbit hole.

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:40.560
I want to move on, keep the show moving.

01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:41.680
Uh, let's talk.

01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:43.880
Well, what rabbit holes don't we go down?

01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:44.960
Right.

01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:46.240
Another intersect.

01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:50.720
What other, uh, analogies do I have to call tangents on this show?

01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:52.000
All right.

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:53.440
Uh, anyhow.

01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:54.040
Yeah.

01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:58.920
As that in chat says, you have to decide where your line is in safety and

01:36:58.920 --> 01:36:59.640
mortality.

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:00.560
Okay.

01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:00.800
Yeah.

01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:02.080
Or, and morally, I'm sorry.

01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:02.920
Safety and morally.

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:04.440
Y'all ready for another tangent?

01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:05.080
Y'all ready?

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:06.840
I got one.

01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:07.560
Okay.

01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:12.080
So because Alan's been doing more streaming, sometimes I'll let him have the

01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:13.120
office to himself.

01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:19.160
And one thing, Hey Dan, one thing that I've been, one thing that I've been getting

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:23.720
into while I, he is doing streaming, I have started becoming that person that

01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:26.360
really enjoys watching documentaries on Netflix.

01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:29.000
Um, I watched a murder among the Mormons.

01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:29.680
That was pretty good.

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:36.840
Uh, and I just watched the four part Jeffrey Epstein documentary, which there's

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:43.000
a lot I could say about that documentary and just how, how mad I just was, how

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:48.880
mad, anyway, that's not the tangent I want to take inhale, exhale, but part of

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:53.680
that documentary was that they had a pretty extensive interview with one of

01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:58.240
the defense lawyers for Jeffrey Epstein, who of course is one of the well-known

01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:01.440
gets paid a lot of fucking money because that's what he does.

01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:06.080
And he talked about very frankly, in this documentary, when you agree to be a

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:09.000
defense lawyer, you are agreeing to these sorts of things.

01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:12.000
You are out there looking for the best interest of your client and dah, dah, dah,

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:12.240
dah, dah.

01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:15.360
And he said these in a very like matter of fact way.

01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:21.120
And you know, and as that's comment made me think of this, um, the, the whole, uh,

01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:24.080
you have to choose what you do ethically and morally, because I'm looking at this

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:29.800
guy going, this guy you're defending is an absolute total fucking piece of shit.

01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:31.480
How are you okay with that?

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:33.400
How are you okay with that?

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:37.920
But every, everybody draws the line where they're okay with it.

01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:40.480
Anyway, sorry.

01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:44.520
I said no more tangents and then took a big one, but I had to get that off my

01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:45.720
chat. You did it chat.

01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:46.440
It's your fault.

01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:49.480
It's chat's fault.

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:52.760
They say things and then they make me think things that I have to say in this

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:53.320
microphone.

01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:56.360
All right, let's move on.

01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.200
Oh, I have the next story.

01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:57.480
Hurry.

01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:01.320
Um, let's talk about Bamani.

01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:03.320
We haven't done that on this show in a long time.

01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:06.240
Let's talk about Bamani, um, because it's still going.

01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:09.120
There are, of course, you know, we know there's new 2DX styles happening and

01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:09.720
things like that.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.400
And Bamani is entering an interesting new space.

01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:17.560
Um, Konami is going to be releasing a new rhythm game in the Bamani series called

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:18.760
Beat Arena.

01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:21.000
What makes this game special?

01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:24.640
It is a Oculus Quest and Oculus 2 games.

01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:29.240
So it is Konami's first VR music game.

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:32.560
Now, of course, VR music games have been done, right?

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:33.240
Beat Saber.

01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:33.680
Hello.

01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:34.600
We all know that one.

01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:38.120
Um, Attica by Harmonix, pretty good.

01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:41.080
I liked that one a lot too, and there's plenty of others as well.

01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:46.080
So it is interesting, which unfortunately, I love tangent.

01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:52.480
Having done this show for 18 years, we see Konami do this too often, right?

01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:54.840
Like in case in point, Rock Revolution.

01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:58.160
Oh, everybody else did the thing with the music game.

01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:00.640
Guess we should finally show up to the party.

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:02.960
How fucking long has Beat Saber been out?

01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:06.280
And just now Konami, oh, we're here.

01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:07.800
Here's our product.

01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:09.720
So Beat Arena is out.

01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:10.840
But you know what?

01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:14.880
Because Konami has its fans, because it is a Japanese made game.

01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:18.680
And because of the fact it, it doesn't look like it's necessarily like a total,

01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:21.800
like you're like in a band type of thing.

01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:23.440
It doesn't look like it's just Beat Saber.

01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:26.000
Like it does look like it's a little different and stuff.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.560
You have like the notes that are flying at you.

01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:31.600
And sometimes with the drums, it looks like you're hitting certain things.

01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:34.440
So, but it does have a different style.

01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:35.840
So I will give them that.

01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:42.240
Like Rock Revolution was just like a knockoff of rock band success, even though,

01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:47.760
yes, I completely realized and I will be the first to say Konami got to that table

01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:50.680
first with Guitar Freaks and Drummania.

01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:51.680
I almost said Guitar Hero.

01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:53.600
Guitar Freaks and Drummania.

01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:57.040
But they, they didn't do anything with it in the US.

01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:59.240
And that was a missed opportunity, wasn't it?

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:02.400
And they, they, they fought to catch up for you.

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:05.640
They lost their own game because of it.

01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:11.120
Anyway, so, so Beat Arena is now them entering the VR space.

01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:12.680
I will say it does look kind of neat.

01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:15.320
It is something I would enjoy to try out at some point.

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:19.280
You do get to pick guitar, bass, drums, or keyboards.

01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:19.800
It is interesting.

01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:23.280
It does kind of take that rock band thing, but it puts it in a VR space, which

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:24.160
is a little bit different.

01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:27.880
And of course there are transplant songs from other Bimani titles.

01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:28.760
So that's pretty cool.

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:33.760
So anyway, Oculus and Oculus Quest 2, it came out on March 12th.

01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:34.520
So it's already out.

01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:35.720
Maybe some of you have played it.

01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:36.800
I'll check the chat in a minute.

01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:37.840
See if any of you have comments.

01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:40.920
Uh, Japanese and English, both available.

01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:41.880
So that's pretty cool.

01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:45.920
Um, right now though, they're saying it's only coming out in Japan and Asia.

01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:48.960
They haven't said anything about a North American release.

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:52.760
I don't know why you would have English and then not.

01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:56.240
But I, Konami does weird shit.

01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:56.880
What can I say?

01:41:58.240 --> 01:41:58.600
All right.

01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:01.200
Anyhow, so that is Beat Arena.

01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:05.680
And it's, it's nice to see Konami still doing Bimani home versions.

01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:09.440
You want to go back to the earlier thing about, you know, the fan

01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:13.560
wank idea of Sony doing more versions of Konami IPs.

01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:17.520
You know, Konami or, uh, Sony's got a pretty good VR thing too.

01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:22.600
They could do a version of this, but I doubt it'll happen.

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:23.760
All right.

01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:30.800
Anyway, SSJ100Matt in chat says, Jason Enos could only do so much.

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:32.320
Konami didn't want to take that in that step.

01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:33.960
Oh, I don't fault him.

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:35.760
I don't follow anybody in America.

01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:38.760
He tried, he tried very hard.

01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:40.800
He has, he was never the problem.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.320
Nor was, um, there was a guy in Hawaii still wind.

01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:49.120
There was a huge, and unfortunately he passed away some time ago, but, uh, he

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:53.800
was, he was a big reason why the ultra mix soundtracks on Xbox were so fucking

01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:59.920
good was because of him and the risks he took with the series, they don't know

01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:02.600
that word risk at Konami Japan, unfortunately.

01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:08.680
At least they didn't a long time ago in the, I, well, I would say they

01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:09.960
probably still don't know it, honestly.

01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:10.680
All right.

01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:12.120
Anyway.

01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:14.200
Um, let's move on.

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:15.720
Let's go to a simpler time.

01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:19.280
We're going to go, we're going to go back to a time when VR didn't exist.

01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:20.360
You know what existed?

01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:22.800
Bits and polygons.

01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:25.200
It's the classic game of the week.

01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:26.720
Early polygons.

01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:27.000
Yes.

01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:30.760
Early, early polygons for this week's title, which again, Dark Soccer, you're

01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:33.600
so good at this, you picked a title where I'm like, how?

01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:36.480
How has this never been a classic game?

01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:37.320
How?

01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:39.440
I asked myself the same thing.

01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:39.920
I know.

01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:40.280
I know.

01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:40.960
So here you go.

01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:42.000
Got you watch.

01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:42.640
Ready?

01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:43.080
Chat.

01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:45.480
We're about to watch chat light up.

01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:47.720
How, what, what this has never been picked before.

01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:48.960
Here it is a classic game of the week.

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:51.560
Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she

01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:55.880
thinks, Hey, you guys should, uh, show a little, put some respect on this title.

01:43:56.160 --> 01:43:57.520
And, uh, it's a good one tonight.

01:43:57.520 --> 01:43:58.120
Dark Soccer.

01:43:58.120 --> 01:43:59.320
What is the classic game of the week?

01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:03.480
The classic game of the week is Ridge Racer.

01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:05.880
So yeah.

01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:07.520
How have I not done Ridge Racer?

01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:10.840
I actually was thinking, Oh, I'll do R4.

01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:13.320
I've done Ridge Racer before, so I'll do R4.

01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:16.200
No, I haven't done Ridge Racer.

01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:19.480
So how can I do R4 if I haven't done Ridge Racer?

01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:27.440
So, um, Ridge Racer came out in 1993 in Japan and North America and 94 in Europe.

01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:31.120
Um, it is a, uh, racing video game.

01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:36.160
It was published by Namco and it was on the Namco system, 22 arcade system board

01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:38.920
and ported to PlayStation in 1994.

01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:41.160
And it is the first in the series.

01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:48.280
Um, and basically as a game, you just have to get first place, you know, you even

01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:50.880
have like your qualifying, I think this one didn't have the qualifying lap.

01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:51.960
I'll have to double check again.

01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:56.840
But anyway, um, one little notable thing is that the PlayStation version

01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:01.680
let you use the Nejicon, which I love playing games with freaking Nejicon.

01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:07.240
Um, so at any rate, uh, it took eight months to develop.

01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:15.440
Um, and, uh, the game is actually, uh, inspired by a, uh, a trend

01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:17.800
amongst Japanese car enthusiasts.

01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:21.040
Um, and of course, uh, with the PlayStation one, it was a

01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:22.760
launch title for the PlayStation.

01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:29.840
Um, it was also re-released, uh, in PlayStation, the best in 97 and, uh,

01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:33.720
the greatest hits and platinum one for North America and PAL respectively.

01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:41.640
And it really was, I think one of the games that gave it, uh, an edge over

01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:45.240
the Saturn, at least in the U S also, of course, with how terribly the Saturn

01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:51.160
was handled for U S marketing, there is that, um, not honestly, keep in mind,

01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:57.160
I worked at an arcade that we had both of those and I would almost always play

01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:03.320
Ridge Racer over Daytona because I got really tired of the splash for Daytona.

01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:04.360
Anyway.

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:12.480
Um, it, it, it was, I'd say a pretty significant game also in the racing game

01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:19.040
genre, um, just because of what it's led to, I mean, I'll get into some of that

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:23.880
down the line, but anyway, for gameplay, you choose a course, you choose a car,

01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:28.800
you choose a transmission, it's either automatic or six speed, uh, six speed

01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:30.080
manual, and you choose a song.

01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:33.880
So, um, some of the cars have a good top speed.

01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:35.840
Others have greater acceleration or turning.

01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:37.200
Some are balanced.

01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:42.240
Um, and then the car, some of the cars are named after different Namco games,

01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:48.440
like Silverlou, Mappy, Bosconian, uh, Nebulas Ray and Xevious.

01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:55.200
So you can play in first person perspective, um, or on the PlayStation

01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:57.160
one, you can do a third person perspective.

01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:02.440
Um, like I said, you can use the Nejicon on the, uh, the PlayStation.

01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:04.520
And here I am doing like the Nejicon motion.

01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:10.320
Um, and so, uh, there's, uh, no damage from collisions.

01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:11.520
They just slow you down a little bit.

01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:12.640
There's a time limit.

01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:13.840
You have to hit your checkpoints.

01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:20.480
Um, so each course, uh, has four configurations of difficulty, novice,

01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:22.800
intermediate, advanced, and trial.

01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:30.960
Um, you, uh, you have, uh, 11 opponents except in the time trial

01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:34.440
where you have only one, the greater the difficulty, the faster the cars.

01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:36.200
And of course, time trial is the fastest.

01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:40.760
Um, each race has three laps or two on the beginner course.

01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:46.240
And when the race is won, you win the reversible course, um, and then

01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:50.800
additional, uh, opponent in the time trial, the 13th racing, also known

01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:52.920
as the devil car, the fastest car.

01:47:53.800 --> 01:48:00.480
Um, and, uh, you get like, um, you also have on the PlayStation, a

01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:04.400
mini version of Galaxian that you can play, uh, as the game loads.

01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:10.440
Um, if, if you win the game, then you get eight additional cars, the

01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:13.360
little game of Galaxian, and then eight additional cars are available.

01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:19.760
And then, um, but you also though lose extra tracks.

01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:21.160
You can only play six music tracks.

01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:24.040
It's kind, it's kind of interesting.

01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:28.560
The, the, uh, the game is actually mostly loaded into system memory.

01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:31.800
You know, so sorry, just, I don't mean to interrupt, but

01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:33.200
it came up a couple of weeks ago.

01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:35.280
I think a lot on Bobby's show and we brought it up too.

01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:39.560
It's interesting that that whole Galaxian loading mini game thing is like a patented

01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:41.240
thing that Namco had for a long time.

01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:44.440
I think their patent finally expired on it, but I thought that was kind of

01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:47.280
interesting that like, that's why you didn't really see that outside of

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:50.080
Namco games is that games within the game on the loading screen.

01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:51.120
This was that patent.

01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:52.360
Yeah.

01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:57.400
I mean, it's not clearly, this is not the only game that they've done that in.

01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:05.480
I mean, so, um, at, uh, the JAMA 1992 amusement, amusement machine show,

01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:08.680
that's a Japan amusement machinery manufacturers association.

01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:15.160
Um, in 1992, Namco actually debuted a game called SIM drive.

01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:20.640
Um, that was also for the system 22, um, arcade board.

01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:25.800
Um, it was a sequel to Eunice roadster driving simulator with the Mazda MX-5.

01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:27.360
Um, that was the simulation game.

01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:32.080
Um, but they did it in, um, in 3d.

01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:36.040
They stood out for the Goron shading and texture mapping.

01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:39.440
Um, and it was very positively reviewed.

01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:42.080
Um, but it didn't get a mass market release.

01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:46.240
It had a limited release in Japan and it pretty much is the prototype for Ridge racer.

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:55.560
Um, so basically the development team was sort of, uh, under this title

01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:00.520
time limit to complete their game before their rivals, um, quote, the

01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:02.600
other company was in the same position.

01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:08.080
Um, and it was supposed to be an F1 racing game, but then they, they took

01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:14.080
it to talking about the mountain roads and the drifting and all of that,

01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:17.760
which was, uh, you know, basically a big trend still, I think to this

01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:19.840
day for Japanese car enthusiasts.

01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:25.240
Um, so they had a game that would let you test different skills and

01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:29.120
experience different speeds and master your drifting.

01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:34.440
Um, and they weren't really worried that it wouldn't be received outside of Japan.

01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:39.080
Uh, they were pretty sure that it was going to be a success everywhere.

01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:48.840
So, um, they basically, instead of choosing cars that were already to be done, uh,

01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:51.360
they tried to make their own specific cars.

01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:55.880
Um, they really liked using the Nejicon for the PlayStation, because it would

01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:58.080
give you tighter control over your vehicle.

01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:02.280
Uh, they were concerned about loading times for the CD, uh, ROM, but then

01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:05.800
they fixed that by having it loaded into the PlayStation memories.

01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:08.600
And that's where the Galaxian play come through.

01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:18.320
Um, and, uh, the, uh, the designer Sakagami, he included Galaxian because

01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:24.000
he was also part of the Galaxian arcade team and wanted to honor his previous boss.

01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:31.760
So, um, and then of course the, uh, the 13th, uh, 13th racing, that car,

01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:36.560
um, was supposed to be a black car that no one had ever driven before.

01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:38.640
And its nickname was the cockroach.

01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:47.720
So, um, moving forward, uh, with that also, um, arcade system board, uh,

01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:51.440
Ridge Racer was considered to be the, well, according to Namco, the

01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:53.280
most realistic driving game ever.

01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:58.920
Um, it was, it was very, very well received.

01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:04.320
Um, now in particular, this is a little anecdote.

01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:10.920
I had to retest for my driver's license after I had, uh, graduated high school

01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:15.720
because I had something limiting me from being able to renew it at the time.

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:20.280
And honestly, it was Ridge Racer that I did some practice with.

01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:26.760
Um, you know, I was more practicing on, you know, just braking and going and,

01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:32.040
you know, and so actually I can, I can attribute a lot of things to Ridge Racer.

01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:35.600
Actually I can, I can attribute a little bit of Ridge Racer

01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:37.800
to passing my driving exam.

01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:39.400
Wow.

01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:43.920
I would think that that's not a great thing to do, but wow.

01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:45.080
You know, it's weird.

01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:47.040
What works for people it's different sometimes.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:51.240
Well, this is the game that taught me how to slow down when I'm turning a corner.

01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:53.160
True.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:53:01.080
You know, and the, the physics in it, weren't really that bad at all.

01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:05.560
I'd even say they had some pretty, uh, pretty good physics in the game.

01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:07.640
I'm going to the music now.

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:15.640
Um, it was produced by, uh, um, Shinji Hosoe, um, with also contributions

01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:18.080
from Nobuyoshi Sano and Ayako Saso.

01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:24.720
Um, but they didn't have enough time to produce the tracks independently.

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:31.480
Um, but they ended up producing kind of that, that sort of fast paced

01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:36.320
electronica and they wanted it to convey a fun feeling while they play.

01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:40.760
And then, um, you know, they wanted to put energy or speed into it.

01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:46.560
So, um, the soundtrack actually ended up being, uh, released as part of Namco

01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:50.480
games, sound express volume 11 by Victor entertainment, and it has

01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:52.160
remixes of all of those themes in it.

01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:55.880
So, yeah, like I said, this was very, very well received.

01:53:56.320 --> 01:54:02.760
Um, the Japanese, uh, magazine game machine listed it, uh, as, uh, uh,

01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:07.920
as their most successful upright arcade game of the year in December, 1993.

01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:14.480
Um, it was, I mean, all across the board, it was just lauded.

01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:18.680
Um, GamePro said the PlayStation version was quote, a mere carbon copy of the

01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:23.480
original, um, um, they thought it was brilliant loading it into the Ram,

01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:26.440
instead of having all these loading screens, you know, trying to

01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:27.640
load the next track or whatnot.

01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:33.760
Um, it, uh, EGM was really fond of the gameplay and the music.

01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:40.920
Um, you know, they said that there were some, uh, some downsides, like there are

01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:45.560
only, uh, this is from Maxima magazine, um, that there was only one track and it

01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:50.680
lacked the, uh, crash sequences from Daytona and, but the quote on here, but

01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:57.240
everything else in the title is sheer class, um, very smooth, very, very well

01:54:57.240 --> 01:55:04.160
playing, um, so looking over, uh, their aggregate score from gang rank, uh,

01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:13.240
gang rankings, they, uh, the PlayStation version had an 81% overall, um, and, uh,

01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:17.120
EGM gave it best driving game, uh, in 1995.

01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:24.040
So, um, let's talk about a little bit of what's become of Ridge Racers.

01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:29.760
So it actually was listed as one of the best games of all time by Game Informer

01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:37.080
in 2001 and by Yahoo in 2005 and EGM in 2006, uh, and the Guinness book

01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:39.520
of world records in 2008 and 2009.

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:43.560
So that's pretty notable.

01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:49.800
Um, and of course there were many sequels, uh, there were also different

01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:59.440
kinds of other releases for the first Ridge Racer, um, it, there were, um,

01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:06.200
there was Ridge Racer full scale, which I have seen one of, and I

01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:07.680
do not remember where I saw it.

01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:17.000
Um, it was basically in, uh, the adapted Eunos Roadster.

01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:20.120
You, and a passenger could sit with you in the car.

01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:24.200
It's a Japanese right hand drive version of a Mazda MX-5.

01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:29.200
Um, and then you have the wheel, the shift, you have the pedals for your

01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:33.320
controls, and then you use an ignition speed to start the gauges were all

01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:37.520
functional and these fans fans would blow, uh, air past you.

01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:43.240
Um, real, realistic engine sounds, uh, and overhead speakers will play the music.

01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:47.760
The PCB was under the, uh, the hood of the car.

01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:55.880
Um, there was also, um, uh, Ridge Racer three screen edition, which is

01:56:55.880 --> 01:56:59.560
also one I've seen a couple of times use multiple system, 22 boards.

01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:03.440
Um, and so it was the game that gave you peripheral vision.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.280
Um, then it was pocket racer, which is an SD version.

01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:10.520
Uh, the cars kind of resemble the core OQ models.

01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:15.040
Um, and it was only available in an upright cabinet version

01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:16.520
and use Namco system 11.

01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:18.000
It was actually released for children.

01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:22.600
Um, they actually included something very similar to it in Ridge Racer

01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:27.120
revolution, um, using those same cars under the name, pretty racer.

01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:29.080
Uh, also known as buggy mode.

01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:32.680
It was, uh, Ridge Racer turbo.

01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:39.720
Um, basically it was included in R4, which is the best Ridge Racer game ever.

01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:45.440
Um, and, uh, it had an extra disc with it that contained a version of Ridge

01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:50.880
Racer called Ridge Racers turbo in North America Ridge Racer high spec demo in

01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:57.360
Europe, um, and, uh, in Japan, it was also called Ridge Racer high spec version.

01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:02.640
Um, it had improved graphics, ran 60 frames per second or 50 in PAL.

01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:07.600
Um, as opposed to the original 30, I had vibration feedback and would let you use

01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:12.400
the, um, cause you know, R4 came with the jog con if you got that bundle.

01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:20.040
Um, you, uh, you have, uh, the white angel from Ridge Racer revolution in it.

01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:22.640
In addition to 13th racing as an unlockable car.

01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:29.160
Um, and you have, uh, a time attack mode where you have, uh, you just beat your

01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:34.200
time with no opponent cars where time trials does have, uh, uh, another car.

01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:36.240
Then there's the mobile versions.

01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:42.680
So, um, there were mobile phone versions released and, uh, criticized

01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:47.240
as being easy to master, but pretty impressive for what it was.

01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:54.120
Um, and then there was, uh, in 2005, there was Ridge Racer 3D for mobile phones.

01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:58.440
Um, and then of course, yeah.

01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:03.920
And then of course there was Ridge Racer 3D for the 3DS, but I want to say that

01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:06.320
that was actually a different game.

01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:11.000
Yeah, it was a different game, had a lot more modes.

01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:18.840
Um, and, uh, actually that version was, uh, ported to the Zeebo.

01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:24.200
You have, have you heard of the Zeebo?

01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:29.840
Um, the name sounds familiar, but I'm, I can't, I'm trying to picture it and I can't.

01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:36.280
It was targeted mostly to Brazil and Mexico, um, as a, an interactive,

01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:39.880
uh, entertainment and education device.

01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:40.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:42.240
Yeah.

01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:45.760
So, um, but yeah, there was a version of Ridge Racer on that.

01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:49.960
But there hasn't been one in a long time and that's kind of sad.

01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:51.680
Yeah.

01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:56.480
And, uh, at DEFT, it's called the Zeebo, Z-E-E-E-O.

01:59:56.800 --> 02:00:02.840
It was in 2009 that they tried to release it or that they did release the game.

02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:05.760
All right.

02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:14.400
So, um, so yeah, uh, anyway, Ridge Racer, that's the one, uh, and now

02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:17.240
I have the, the opening song from R4.

02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:23.560
I mean, cause now it's also given us like one of our notable, um, uh,

02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:33.000
mascots, um, uh, Reiko, who's become a, uh, you know, a definite, uh, face

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:40.240
for the, you know, the various, uh, uh, racing, uh, for the various, uh,

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.080
gosh, why can't I say the words for various Ridge Racer games?

02:00:44.120 --> 02:00:44.360
Yeah.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:54.000
So, um, you know, and honestly, it's so funny, like someone actually

02:00:54.000 --> 02:01:00.160
redid the R4 opening and, uh, it doesn't quite look right.

02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:03.600
Um, they tried to, you know, make it a little bit more upscale.

02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:10.840
Um, but, uh, like for just a moment though, I'm trying to remember her

02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:14.640
family name and I, my brain is blanking.

02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:15.400
That's all right.

02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:17.400
All right.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:19.760
Nagase.

02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:21.440
All right.

02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:26.360
We should use the virtual idol and she's actually, um, been

02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:28.400
used now in other things too.

02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:31.360
So, and she has a sister in another game.

02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:35.480
The whole big Namco family.

02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:42.040
Yeah, she was used in, um, Anna Kournikova, smash court tennis and

02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:48.400
professional baseball Famitsu, uh, Famista and Fantasia, Nari-kiri

02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:50.240
Dungeon, Taiko no Tatsujin V.

02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:54.480
She's a summon character or five, I should say, or V version, whatever.

02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:55.120
Anyway.

02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:56.240
All right.

02:01:56.920 --> 02:01:57.560
Well, there it is.

02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:02.280
Your classic game of the week Ridge Racer, which again, I don't know how

02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:05.160
we've never talked about Ridge Racer on this show before, I mean, we've

02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:08.480
talked about Ridge Racer, but not in the segment meant to talk about

02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:12.880
great classic games, so I'm glad we took care of that on Pi Day.

02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:17.920
So, uh, looking at chat over twitch.tv slash vlog network, DJ Rama S says,

02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:19.320
now I want to play Ridge Racer.

02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:20.240
Well, you, you know what?

02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:21.440
That's a good way to spend Pi Day.

02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:23.640
Have some Pi, play some Ridge Racer.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:25.720
We still have our copy of Ridge Racer.

02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:27.280
All right.

02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:31.160
We're going to, uh, travel around and check out some rapid fire news.

02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:34.240
Now, just a couple of quick headlines for you guys, starting with Loki.

02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:35.840
Yes.

02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:39.000
So we've been talking for a few weeks on how super Nintendo

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.440
world has been delayed in Japan.

02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:44.480
Well, now it's going to be opening March 18th.

02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:45.000
That's right.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:50.200
This week in Japan, it will be open of course, with, um, you know, certain

02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:54.840
guidelines, they're just, you know, trying to stay safe, but, uh, it is

02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:57.960
finally open, so that's, that's exciting.

02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:01.400
Um, uh, just a quick related tangent.

02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:02.480
Cause I love those tonight.

02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:06.280
Uh, Aria snark over from shaking and crying was actually at universal

02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:12.520
studios, uh, yesterday, I think the one in, um, uh, I almost said Anaheim.

02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:13.080
That's not true.

02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:13.920
Actual Hollywood.

02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:15.200
So universal studios, Hollywood.

02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:18.280
Um, and she went in a, I thought this was very clever.

02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:21.640
She went in a Bellatrix, uh, cosplay that had a mask.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.360
So she actually had like a mass of tied in and she looked great.

02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:27.960
Um, but anyway, uh, she said the point, oh, she's very crafty.

02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:33.320
She sent a picture of, so she texted me a picture of Nintendo world in

02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:35.800
progress at universal studios, Hollywood.

02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:38.520
And you can see they have some of the green like scenery stuff up.

02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:41.800
It's it's down in the lower lot area for those that have been there.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.120
I, when I sent the picture, I was like, isn't that right where the

02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:48.240
transformers ride is, but I guess my sense of direction is off, but you

02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:51.680
can see like right in the foreground, the, I guess now Jurassic world ride.

02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:53.160
Last time I was on, it was Jurassic park.

02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:54.000
Is right there.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:57.240
And then the Nintendo land looks like it's just a couple of steps past that.

02:03:57.480 --> 02:03:59.920
So it's interesting kind of seeing the construction on that.

02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:04.440
So I assume Hollywood's probably going to be next, uh, whenever they get around to it.

02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:05.760
It might beat Orlando to it.

02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:09.240
Yeah, I think it's maybe next year.

02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:11.560
Yeah, maybe later this year.

02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:12.040
Who knows?

02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:15.400
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says super Nintendo world has been open for a while though.

02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:21.960
Uh, they, they, um, they, uh, they had, uh, the, the press tour and they had

02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:25.520
those events like where Miyamoto was going through it and they had a couple

02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:30.120
of press events, but they had to delay the official opening because

02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:31.880
the COVID numbers went back up.

02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:34.960
I don't know if they did a soft opening or something, but this is

02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:36.800
now the official official opening.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:38.480
Um, but they, they had to delay it again.

02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:40.160
Cause COVID started going back up in Japan.

02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:42.200
All right.

02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:44.000
Uh, yeah.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.480
And a couple of people in chatter saying, uh, super Nintendo

02:04:46.480 --> 02:04:49.040
world Orlando is slated for 2025.

02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:49.480
Yeah.

02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:52.520
I thought theirs was going to, it's, it's this weird thing where Hollywood's

02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:55.240
actually going to get it before Orlando, which doesn't usually happen.

02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:56.360
So hooray, I guess.

02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:57.280
All right.

02:04:57.280 --> 02:05:01.080
And speaking of, speaking of delays though, uh, we have the next expansion

02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:07.720
to Borderlands three has now been delayed to April 8th and that's, uh, thankfully,

02:05:07.760 --> 02:05:12.200
well, I should say you can thank that, uh, Texas snow storm for that.

02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:18.360
Um, because of all the outages that they've had to, um, endure there.

02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:19.720
So that's put them behind.

02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:20.400
Okay.

02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:25.040
But that's understandable, you know, as opposed to, uh, what we talked about

02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:28.600
earlier, an actual, that's what a normal gaming company, like, sorry,

02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:30.040
our product's gonna take longer or not.

02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:32.840
You got to come in and, uh, hope you don't die on the way here.

02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:34.520
Yeah, much better.

02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:35.400
All right.

02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:35.840
Dark soccer.

02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:36.240
How about you?

02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:43.160
Way yell, um, crash bandicoot four it's about time is coming, uh, to

02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:45.920
the PC in a couple of weeks.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:51.720
Um, it was on PS five X-Box series, uh, X S and switch

02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:54.200
actually came out, uh, on the 12th.

02:05:54.760 --> 02:05:58.240
Um, but it's coming to battle on it on March 26th.

02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:02.800
So if you like crash, good for you, you can play it on your PC.

02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:09.840
And then super Mario three D world, uh, Bowser's fury is considered the best

02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:14.920
selling game during February, 2021 and kept the switch on top of everything.

02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:20.000
So yes, Mario games sell, uh, sell their hardware sales increased.

02:06:20.520 --> 02:06:25.840
Um, 121% um, over the year.

02:06:25.840 --> 02:06:29.760
So they're up to 406 million dollars.

02:06:30.920 --> 02:06:31.400
Wow.

02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:32.480
Yeah.

02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:36.200
I mean, that's the one thing that goes against a switch pro.

02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:38.240
Why do they need a switch pro?

02:06:38.520 --> 02:06:39.960
The one they got still selling.

02:06:40.920 --> 02:06:44.280
Yes, but you know, the moment a switch pro comes out, they're going

02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:45.600
to be selling even more of them.

02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:45.920
Yeah.

02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:49.040
But I'm like, you know, I was talking about with bravely default two earlier,

02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:52.080
and I'm sure a lot of these other games that are coming, it's just like the

02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:55.880
switch is getting to a point where it can't handle or the game makers want to go.

02:06:55.920 --> 02:07:00.440
So I really hope the switch pro is in the cards for that reason, because, you

02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:03.800
know, the switch might be hot right now, but without the games to keep it going,

02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:05.920
it's going to, uh, going to falter off.

02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:08.480
But of course we all know breath of the wild too is going to happen at some point.

02:07:08.480 --> 02:07:11.520
You know, Nintendo has some aces up their sleeve for sure.

02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:11.960
For sure.

02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:13.800
I can't wait for breath of the wild too.

02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:15.240
Oh, I get in line.

02:07:16.120 --> 02:07:19.560
I want there to be more korok hunting so you can keep collecting their poop.

02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:21.360
All right.

02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:23.000
Uh, let's move on.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:27.960
Let's get to, uh, our next, uh, world release dates segment here.

02:07:27.960 --> 02:07:30.520

Let's go over to Japan and check out, uh, some of the releases over there.

02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:28.400
So, um, coming out on the Nintendo switch switch, Jack Jan, uh, is out,

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:37.600
is also out in Japan this week.

02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:42.400
We also have Maglam Lord, uh, and then go by train hashiro.

02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:46.400
Yamanote lean, uh, is out this week, by the way, speaking of train games.

02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:48.320
Wait, what?

02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:51.600
Go by train hashiro.

02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:52.240
Yama note.

02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:52.640
I'm sorry.

02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:53.680
I misread the word line.

02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:54.800
It's just line.

02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:57.840
Um, Yamanote.

02:09:57.840 --> 02:09:58.340
Uh huh.

02:09:59.200 --> 02:09:59.680
Okay.

02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:00.400
Okay.

02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:05.760
So anyway, um, so the train game in Japan, um, I, I said, why don't they

02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:06.960
ever bring those over here?

02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:11.280
They, that a train game I talked about last week, they are bringing over here.

02:10:11.280 --> 02:10:12.320
Just a heads up.

02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:15.840
I, it surprised me too, but they are bringing out an English version of that

02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:16.320
over here.

02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:19.280
I can't remember if it already came out or if it's coming out, but, uh, I

02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:22.160
thought that was important to follow up with is that they are experimenting

02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:23.520
and bringing some more of those games over here.

02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:24.320
And I think that's kind of neat.

02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:28.800
Uh, anyway, sorry, uh, distracted, but, um, that's happened to me a lot tonight.

02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:33.920
Also out on the switch, uh, apex legends in Japan gets its switch release.

02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:35.200
So check that out.

02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:41.840
Um, and then going over to the PlayStation, of course, I closed my list

02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:42.160
here.

02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:45.040
So, um, dark soccer, why don't we go over to the UK real quick and then

02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:45.600
we'll come back.

02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:46.880
Okay.

02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:53.600
So on the 16th, uh, for switch kingdoms of Amalur re reckoning on the 18th, we

02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:58.560
have Marvel's Avengers for PlayStation hunting simulator two for PlayStation

Okay.

02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:26.000
And I'm back on track to finish Japan.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:26.480
Sorry about that.

02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:27.360
Screw up on my part.

Lord game is also coming out, uh, this week on the 18th.

02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:44.080
So those are the Japanese releases.

02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:44.720
All right.

02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:46.560
Let's get to some more stories.

02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:46.960
Loki.

02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:50.720
All right.

02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:56.000
Uh, so this is very interesting, I should say.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:01.280
So already like I FIFA ultimate team's been kind of shady as it is, you know,

02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:05.040
with the whole loot box scenario with that, but now EA is actually

02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:10.320
investigating claims that an employee has been selling rare items.

02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:15.840
So being that they're working for the company, they got access to special

02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:19.520
items that they're then pawning off, uh, for large sums of money.

02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:27.600
So apparently this is coming from, um, you know, some, I don't know if it's

02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:31.200
like from forums or whatnot, but basically saying, you know, showing

02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:33.520
that there's all these items that are up for sale.

02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:36.880
Like there's this, uh, post that was on Twitter saying, so we grind

02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:38.160
trade open packs.

02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:42.800
We can't touch these PIM players, but EA employees sell them to people

02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:44.400
secretly for $1,700.

02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:46.080
LOL.

02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:47.760
I respect the grind, but my God.

02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:56.400
So because this got, um, kind of exposed on social media under this EA

02:12:56.400 --> 02:13:03.120
gate, um, hashtag these complaints that these different, um, FIFA icon or

02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:07.520
prime icon moment players are there being sold for over a thousand dollars.

02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:12.880
They're now doing some investigation to see doing that.

02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:16.000
And you know, how, how this is happening.

02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:19.760
And of course, FIFA put out a statement saying that we want to be clear.

02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:21.440
This type of behavior is unacceptable.

02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:25.520
And we, in no way could don't was alleged to have happened here.

02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:28.960
We understand how this can create concern of unfair balance in the gaming

02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:29.600
competition.

02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:36.320
Um, yeah, but it's also shitty that you're selling these things in the

02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:38.880
first place, but whatever.

02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:43.600
I'm kind of surprised it took this long for a story like this to come out.

02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:44.240
You know what I mean?

02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:47.120
Uh, yeah, I completely agree.

02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:52.960
I'm surprised that it's just now that we're seeing this, but I don't know.

02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:57.120
I mean, not, not that it's good news, but in this age of like digital goods

02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:00.720
being worth so much, I'm just kind of surprised nobody's tried to take

02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:05.040
advantage of the system before, or at least I'm not recalling if it has

02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:06.240
happened before.

02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:07.200
So interesting.

02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:09.600
Yeah.

02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:10.160
All right.

02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:11.680
So interesting.

02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:15.360
Almost like that guy I heard on the news here that was stealing stuff out

02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:18.080
of the Amazon warehouse while he was working there and then reselling it.

02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:22.480
Unfortunately, crime crime happens even in the digital space.

02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:23.120
That's for sure.

02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:24.240
All right.

02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:28.720
Let's talk about Pokemon go since I talk about that game a lot, but this

02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:32.000
is interesting because you have one of the biggest mobile games out there

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.160
that's, uh, testing a pretty big change.

02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:39.200
And that is being able to preview what might be in the eggs that you are

02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:43.520
hatching because, uh, eggs are, I don't know, eggs are kind of like loot

02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:46.960
boxes, but they're also not because they, you know, eggs drop everywhere.

02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:48.400
Yeah.

02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:50.480
It's the incubators that cost money.

02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:54.960
And then you have to decide which you, although you do have the one, uh,

02:14:54.960 --> 02:14:58.160
infinite incubator, but you know, that's not enough for some people.

02:14:58.160 --> 02:15:02.160
Cause of course the game lets you hold nine eggs, but one, one eternal

02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:02.720
incubator.

02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:06.080
So if you want to have them all going at once, you got to buy some more or,

02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:08.400
you know, sometimes they give away little freebies.

02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:11.920
You know, there's a lot of, a lot of if thens and so forth, but, um, there's

02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:15.680
been a call to really like be more transparent with the odds.

02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:16.800
Although a lot of.

02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:21.520
Like Reddit has the silph road Reddit, which is extremely helpful for

02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:23.040
players of Pokemon go.

02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:26.320
Um, and they do these big tests where they have a lot of people report

02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:28.560
numbers and they kind of figure it out.

02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:31.760
Like they figure out that like, this is the, this is the percentage of, uh,

02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:35.200
what's in 5k eggs and this is what's in two case, but it looks like Niantic

02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:36.640
is going to be a bit more transparent with that.

02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:39.680
You won't have to wait for the silph road to do their experiments anymore.

02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:45.600
So in some tweets, uh, from Niantic help, they have said that, uh, trainers

02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:48.800
were excited to share that we're starting testing with a limited number

02:15:48.800 --> 02:15:52.960
of trainers who will be able to see which Pokemon may hatch from eggs in

02:15:52.960 --> 02:15:54.400
their inventory.

02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:59.040
Um, it's not going to show you though, if a Pokemon is a shiny, it doesn't

02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:00.240
show you odds on that.

02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:04.720
Sorry, Shane, but it does show you the odds on what might actually be in it,

02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:08.320
but you know what it doesn't let you do and what needs to happen.

02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:10.880
It doesn't let you send an egg to the shredder.

02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:13.200
That's been a big problem with the game.

02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:16.080
If you have nine eggs and you don't want to hatch one of them, cause it

02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:17.520
doesn't have what you want in it.

02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:20.960
You can't send it to the omelet factory or whatever you want to do with the

02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:21.280
egg.

02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:23.040
You can't get it to go.

02:16:23.040 --> 02:16:23.360
Oops.

02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:24.480
I dropped it on the ground.

02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:25.520
No, you cracked open.

02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:26.720
No, you can't do that.

02:16:26.720 --> 02:16:31.120
It's a, they, they did try to improve it a little bit where like the really

02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:35.280
valuable eggs, the 12 K eggs and the ones that you get from adventure sync

02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:37.360
and stuff, they go to like a holding.

02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:40.800
They go to like an extra inventory where you can hold three more eggs, but

02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:42.080
only those kinds of eggs.

02:16:42.720 --> 02:16:44.880
It's, it's a little bit convoluted.

02:16:44.880 --> 02:16:48.560
I just don't understand why you can't delete eggs, but it is what it is.

02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:53.200
Um, anyway, uh, you will actually, apparently if you are in Germany or

02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:57.920
Belgium, you can actually, I'm sorry, Germany and Belgium pass the laws that

02:16:57.920 --> 02:17:00.640
they are, uh, kind of responding to here.

02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:05.040
I don't know exactly where the trainers are that they can see these features

02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:07.840
yet, but I'm sure it'll start to spread out more and more.

02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:11.040
A lot of this stuff usually gets tested in places like Australia.

02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:13.840
New Zealand is almost always Niantic's testing zone.

02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:15.040
Um, but we'll see.

02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:15.840
So.

02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:24.480
Anyway, it should be noted that, uh, a Dutch court fined EA 10 million euros

02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:27.040
over FIFA ultimate team packs.

02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:31.120
And that, uh, was after a ban on loot boxes by the Dutch, uh, gambling

02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:32.960
authority in 2018.

02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:39.040
So these, uh, loot boxes are, um, uh, maybe going to be regulated to a thing

02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:39.600
of the past.

02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:40.240
We'll see.

02:17:40.240 --> 02:17:43.680
And even though eggs aren't quite loot boxes, I just think Niantic doesn't

02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:44.960
want to get caught up in that.

02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:49.440
And honestly, people figure it out anyway, because it's self road.

02:17:49.440 --> 02:17:50.960
So they might as well be transparent.

02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:55.440
Uh, Shane is in chat and says, I gave up on eggs to be honest.

02:17:55.440 --> 02:17:57.120
They never end up worth it.

02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:01.600
And they hype up like the Pokemon that make a 1% hatch chance every event.

02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:02.480
So why care?

02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:06.560
You know, and that's maybe one reason they're also responding to it was that

02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:11.280
whole issue with, was it denial or something that was in, uh, the eggs that

02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:13.120
like wasn't showing up.

02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:17.200
Even though his picture was all over the event and people were getting really

02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:17.760
frustrated.

02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:19.600
So maybe they're trying to be more transparent about that.

02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:20.000
I don't know.

02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:20.880
Anyway.

02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:23.040
Um, let's see.

02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:28.320
Um, as 200, Matt says, sending Pokemon to the professor equals a nice farm up

02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:30.000
state where they can be free.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:30.400
Nope.

02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:31.600
Poke blender.

02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:33.840
Where do you think, where do you think your candy comes from?

02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:37.280
Uh, anyway, let's move on.

02:18:37.280 --> 02:18:38.320
Uh, dark soccer.

02:18:40.400 --> 02:18:45.280
So, uh, a game that I've absolutely made no, no secret that I love.

02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:47.040
And I know that you love it too, Robin.

02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:48.560
Look, I don't know if you played it.

02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:50.640
Um, was everybody's gone to the rapture.

02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:53.200
Well, um, I, I streamed it.

02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:54.480
Oh, cool.

02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:54.640
Yeah.

02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:55.120
I remember that.

02:18:55.120 --> 02:18:55.440
That's right.

02:18:55.440 --> 02:18:55.760
That's right.

02:18:56.640 --> 02:18:57.040
Yeah.

02:18:57.040 --> 02:19:01.920
So it is basically a single player narrative game.

02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:09.760
Um, so, uh, the, uh, the designer, um, of the game, Andrew Crenshaw, uh, he

02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:14.080
was the lead designer for everybody's gone to the rapture is doing another

02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:17.040
game called the magnificent truffle pigs.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:22.960
And you basically go through the British countryside, looking for buried

02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:27.040
treasure with a metal detector and you dig around and the only other person

02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:30.400
you have to talk to is somebody on the other end of a walkie talkie.

02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:36.800
Um, her name is Beth, uh, voiced by, uh, Lucy fish from safe house and another

02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:37.200
Eden.

02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:44.480
Um, but you, uh, but you have, you're trying to help her find things as well.

02:19:44.880 --> 02:19:49.440
So it's definitely that narrative type of game.

02:19:49.440 --> 02:19:54.880
Um, you know, they say it also has a little bit of, uh, a relation to fire

02:19:54.880 --> 02:20:00.160
watch with just that, that calm aspect of it, the, the communicator aspect.

02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:01.680
And I loved fire watch as well.

02:20:01.680 --> 02:20:02.640
Firewatch was great.

02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:09.440
So, um, this is actually the first game being released for Crenshaw's, uh,

02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:17.040
studio thunked T H U N K apostrophe D backed by AMC games, um, which is a

02:20:17.040 --> 02:20:20.480
video game publisher, um, for AMC networks.

02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:24.560
Is that unfortunately, I think the company that made everybody's gone to

02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:26.800
rapture developed, I don't think they're around anymore.

02:20:26.800 --> 02:20:27.440
Don't quote me on that.

02:20:27.440 --> 02:20:29.360
I might be confusing my companies too.

02:20:29.360 --> 02:20:31.280
That's why I specified it was.

02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:32.240
No, no, no, I know.

02:20:32.240 --> 02:20:34.160
I know, but I just, that's why.

02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:34.660
Yeah.

02:20:35.620 --> 02:20:42.420
So, so, well, it definitely looks like this, the type of game I'd be into

02:20:42.420 --> 02:20:45.460
playing, I thought that everybody's gone to the rapture was brilliant and

02:20:45.460 --> 02:20:46.820
I'm looking for, for more.

02:20:47.380 --> 02:20:47.700
Yeah.

02:20:47.700 --> 02:20:50.580
I'll definitely check this game out too, just based on who's behind it for

02:20:50.580 --> 02:20:50.900
sure.

02:20:50.900 --> 02:20:53.780
Cause I really enjoyed, you know, all those games you mentioned, everybody's

02:20:53.780 --> 02:20:55.060
gone to the rapture firewatch.

02:20:55.060 --> 02:20:55.700
It's all good stuff.

02:20:56.500 --> 02:20:56.820
All right.

02:20:57.700 --> 02:20:58.020
All right.

02:20:58.020 --> 02:21:01.700
Let's go just a few more stories to go and then we'll, uh, open it up to chat

02:21:01.700 --> 02:21:04.260
to see if they have any questions in chat and see if we have any email

02:21:04.260 --> 02:21:04.580
tonight.

02:21:04.580 --> 02:21:07.540
Although sadly, I don't think we do, but, um, maybe I missed one.

02:21:07.540 --> 02:21:09.540
Uh, anyway, so Loki, what do you have for us?

02:21:10.820 --> 02:21:18.740
So DeNovo is, um, offering their anti-cheat middleware to, uh, PlayStation

02:21:18.740 --> 02:21:23.540
five, because yes, that's what everybody's been asking for to be in their

02:21:23.540 --> 02:21:24.260
games.

02:21:24.260 --> 02:21:26.660
They, everyone loves DeNovo, right?

02:21:26.660 --> 02:21:31.220
You know, on PC, no one ever complains that it breaks everything and just is

02:21:31.220 --> 02:21:32.740
completely useless.

02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:38.100
But yes, let's bring that and that anti-cheat, uh, technology to the

02:21:38.100 --> 02:21:39.060
PlayStation five.

02:21:40.020 --> 02:21:41.780
So it's not popular.

02:21:41.780 --> 02:21:42.740
That's for sure.

02:21:42.740 --> 02:21:48.740
Um, it's definitely, I hope it's better than their anti tamper software, but

02:21:48.740 --> 02:21:52.740
it is something that they're allowing, you know, folks to license, to be able

02:21:52.740 --> 02:21:55.940
to use in their PlayStation five titles.

02:21:55.940 --> 02:22:01.860
Um, good luck with that because if your game has a stink of DeNovo on it, then

02:22:02.740 --> 02:22:04.900
I don't know, you're going to be hurting.

02:22:04.900 --> 02:22:10.580
I think the best part that sums us up, there was a comment on this story and

02:22:10.580 --> 02:22:12.740
it's like, perfect.

02:22:12.740 --> 02:22:17.540
It's we'd let, and you know, the quote is we'd like more PC experiences on

02:22:17.540 --> 02:22:19.940
consoles, monkey paw activated.

02:22:22.500 --> 02:22:25.780
I thought, I thought that was funny, but yeah, DeNovo sucks.

02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:27.460
Uh, yeah.

02:22:27.460 --> 02:22:32.100
And, um, I do, are they trying to do this because maybe they think like they

02:22:32.100 --> 02:22:34.580
can be a little more transparent hidden with it.

02:22:34.580 --> 02:22:36.820
If it's on PlayStation, like they don't have to advertise it.

02:22:36.820 --> 02:22:38.100
It has DeNovo in it.

02:22:38.100 --> 02:22:40.820
So maybe they kind of think it'll like sneak in there and maybe people won't

02:22:40.820 --> 02:22:41.140
notice.

02:22:42.500 --> 02:22:46.580
Um, well, apparently they haven't been too transparent with it because DeNovo

02:22:46.580 --> 02:22:50.500
has already said that some PlayStation five games are already utilizing

02:22:50.500 --> 02:22:55.220
anti-cheat through DeNovo, but they won't say which ones because of the stink

02:22:55.220 --> 02:22:58.020
of DeNovo and that will cause people not to want to play those games.

02:22:58.580 --> 02:23:02.340
Um, so chances are you already have it and you just don't know.

02:23:03.380 --> 02:23:03.700
Yeah.

02:23:03.700 --> 02:23:07.460
So don't they have tests for that?

02:23:08.900 --> 02:23:10.420
Not for the, not for this one.

02:23:10.420 --> 02:23:11.780
There's no DeNovo test.

02:23:14.100 --> 02:23:15.220
So unfortunately not.

02:23:15.220 --> 02:23:20.580
So, uh, yeah, there's another strike against PlayStation five, I guess for

02:23:20.580 --> 02:23:21.300
now.

02:23:21.300 --> 02:23:22.260
All right.

02:23:22.340 --> 02:23:26.820
And, uh, our last story on record tonight is, uh, about the Game Boy

02:23:26.820 --> 02:23:27.380
Advance.

02:23:27.860 --> 02:23:29.380
Uh, yes, an old system.

02:23:29.380 --> 02:23:30.020
Yeah.

02:23:30.020 --> 02:23:32.820
Um, do you remember how they had those video cartridges for Game Boy

02:23:32.820 --> 02:23:33.300
Advance?

02:23:33.300 --> 02:23:35.940
Not the 3D, 3D thing that was later.

02:23:35.940 --> 02:23:38.740
Although I don't even think they ever actually really did that except maybe

02:23:38.740 --> 02:23:40.660
like dinosaur office and the things you can download.

02:23:40.660 --> 02:23:41.540
But do you remember the Game Boy?

02:23:41.540 --> 02:23:42.500
They had the Tekken movie.

02:23:43.220 --> 02:23:44.900
Did they have the Tekken movie on Game Boy carts?

02:23:45.540 --> 02:23:47.460
They had the Tekken movie on the 3DS.

02:23:47.460 --> 02:23:48.660
It was in 3D.

02:23:48.660 --> 02:23:50.820
Well, the Game Boy Advance cards, they were a lot smaller.

02:23:50.820 --> 02:23:53.540
They could only hold about 20, 30 minutes of video.

02:23:53.540 --> 02:23:57.220
So they had like SpongeBob episodes, uh, and like Pokemon episodes.

02:23:57.220 --> 02:23:59.300
That was the type of stuff you got on Game Boy Advance cards.

02:23:59.300 --> 02:24:03.540
It was very much a shut up while we're trying to drive somewhere type of

02:24:03.540 --> 02:24:06.100
thing, entertain the kids in the back seat type of thing.

02:24:06.100 --> 02:24:09.700
Since not everybody has a television installed in their car, at least not

02:24:09.700 --> 02:24:11.620
back when the Game Boy Advance was a thing.

02:24:11.620 --> 02:24:18.820
Well, somebody, because they can, decided to put Tenet on a Game Boy

02:24:18.820 --> 02:24:19.300
Advance cards.

02:24:19.380 --> 02:24:19.620
That's right.

02:24:19.620 --> 02:24:23.220
The Christopher Nolan movie Tenet, which, and why did he do this?

02:24:23.220 --> 02:24:26.980
Because Christopher Nolan said you have to enjoy it in cinema, even though

02:24:26.980 --> 02:24:28.420
there's a pandemic going on right now.

02:24:29.060 --> 02:24:32.260
This is a film whose image and sound really needs to be enjoyed in your

02:24:32.260 --> 02:24:34.100
theaters on the big screen.

02:24:34.100 --> 02:24:39.940
So YouTube, YouTuber Bob Wolf decided, fuck that, and put it on the Game Boy

02:24:39.940 --> 02:24:40.580
Advance.

02:24:40.580 --> 02:24:43.780
Loki, you went, you went and saw Tenet during that like gap where the

02:24:43.780 --> 02:24:44.740
theaters open, right?

02:24:44.740 --> 02:24:48.420
So I did, yeah, I did see it in the cinema and their sound balancing is

02:24:48.420 --> 02:24:50.420
just crap in that movie.

02:24:50.420 --> 02:24:52.100
Like it, it's just awful.

02:24:53.060 --> 02:24:53.860
Awful, awful.

02:24:57.860 --> 02:25:03.140
So, so in the, in a similarity to the world of, you know, three and a half

02:25:03.140 --> 02:25:09.780
inch floppy disks, this movie is spread across five cartridges because of

02:25:09.780 --> 02:25:11.300
the limits of what it will hold.

02:25:12.260 --> 02:25:16.340
The guy made custom labels for it, which I think is really funny, but then

02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:21.460
to actually get the movie to fit on the cartridges, the resolution is down

02:25:21.460 --> 02:25:25.300
to 192 by 128.

02:25:25.940 --> 02:25:30.580
That 128p power, six frames a second.

02:25:31.620 --> 02:25:39.060
So not, not 60, six and a whopping eight kilobyte bit rate.

02:25:39.060 --> 02:25:44.100
So it's, it's like watching real video, um, of a movie.

02:25:45.060 --> 02:25:47.860
If you want to throw it back a little bit, it's basically what you're looking

02:25:47.860 --> 02:25:48.580
at there.

02:25:48.580 --> 02:25:52.740
Uh, so it's definitely not IMAX, uh, definitely not the way, uh, the director

02:25:52.740 --> 02:25:54.020
wanted you to see it.

02:25:54.020 --> 02:25:57.380
Uh, and no, no word on how it sounded, although I'm sure it was kind of

02:25:57.380 --> 02:25:58.340
garbage.

02:25:58.340 --> 02:26:00.340
So, um, there you go.

02:26:00.340 --> 02:26:03.460
If you want to check out the YouTubes on it again, the YouTuber's name is Bob

02:26:03.460 --> 02:26:06.100
Wolf, W-U-L-F-F.

02:26:06.100 --> 02:26:09.380
And I do, I do applaud the idea of doing things.

02:26:09.380 --> 02:26:10.260
Why not?

02:26:10.260 --> 02:26:13.220
Just because I get, because this guy said it's the only way to watch it.

02:26:13.300 --> 02:26:15.860
Uh-uh, I'm going to do it my own way.

02:26:15.860 --> 02:26:20.020
Now we need to have the AI upscale that, bringing it up to 60 FPS as well.

02:26:21.380 --> 02:26:25.300
What, what horrible abomination that becomes.

02:26:25.300 --> 02:26:28.980
I want to, I want a Game Boy Advance cartridge of OLR clips.

02:26:28.980 --> 02:26:33.140
Obviously we can't, but a whole show of OLR would take like eight cartridges,

02:26:33.140 --> 02:26:38.020
but we can put clips together on a cartridge, go through the Twitch library

02:26:38.020 --> 02:26:40.660
and have OLR clips on a Game Boy Advance cartridge.

02:26:40.660 --> 02:26:41.780
I like that idea.

02:26:42.340 --> 02:26:46.820
Anyway, uh, Orange Right points out, hey, they did actually put Shrek and

02:26:46.820 --> 02:26:49.300
Shark Tale on one Game Boy Advance cartridge.

02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:51.140
Very much compressed.

02:26:51.140 --> 02:26:52.100
Yeah, I bet.

02:26:52.100 --> 02:26:52.900
I bet.

02:26:52.900 --> 02:26:56.820
Uh, DJ Roma asks, uh, is real media still a thing?

02:26:57.700 --> 02:26:58.500
That's a good question.

02:26:58.500 --> 02:27:00.100
I would assume they got bought or something.

02:27:01.220 --> 02:27:03.380
I think they've been gone for an age.

02:27:03.380 --> 02:27:04.180
I think so too.

02:27:04.820 --> 02:27:09.220
Um, uh, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I have a home theater and I just want

02:27:09.220 --> 02:27:10.580
to watch it on a Game Boy Advance.

02:27:11.860 --> 02:27:15.940
Uh, Sia Tabiri suggests they should reshoot it on a Game Boy camera.

02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:17.540
Oh, I like that idea.

02:27:19.940 --> 02:27:21.620
Making movies on a Game Boy camera.

02:27:21.620 --> 02:27:22.340
Brilliant.

02:27:22.340 --> 02:27:22.740
All right.

02:27:23.780 --> 02:27:26.980
That's it for all of the stories we had, uh, slotted tonight.

02:27:26.980 --> 02:27:29.380
However, we do want to open it up to the listener round table.

02:27:29.380 --> 02:27:34.180
If you guys have any questions or comments in chat over at twitch.tv

02:27:34.180 --> 02:27:38.020
slash vog network, that's twitch.tv slash VOG network.

02:27:38.020 --> 02:27:40.900
Um, then you guys can ask questions away there.

02:27:40.900 --> 02:27:44.660
We would also during this point of the show, check on our emails every week.

02:27:44.660 --> 02:27:50.420
You guys maybe send us emails to participate at orange lounge, radio.com.

02:27:50.420 --> 02:27:51.940
And we read our favorites on air.

02:27:51.940 --> 02:27:53.140
However, unfortunately.

02:27:53.700 --> 02:27:54.420
You failed us.

02:27:54.420 --> 02:27:57.620
You did not send us any emails this week, so I can ask Rob.

02:27:57.620 --> 02:27:57.860
Yes.

02:27:57.860 --> 02:28:00.980
I can ask dark soccer about drag race, even though I've barely been watching.

02:28:01.700 --> 02:28:02.820
I caught up.

02:28:02.820 --> 02:28:03.700
Um, oh, did you?

02:28:04.500 --> 02:28:05.140
Yeah, I don't.

02:28:05.140 --> 02:28:06.100
Did you see the last episode?

02:28:06.100 --> 02:28:07.140
Cause I don't want to spoil it.

02:28:07.140 --> 02:28:10.740
I well, don't spoil it for the listeners anyway, but I am aware of what happened.

02:28:11.460 --> 02:28:12.500
I'm pissed.

02:28:12.500 --> 02:28:12.740
Yeah.

02:28:13.940 --> 02:28:18.340
A lot of people are saying, I still think the winner has been obvious since the very first

02:28:18.340 --> 02:28:19.300
episode.

02:28:19.300 --> 02:28:22.740
Um, but I don't, I don't think it is.

02:28:22.740 --> 02:28:23.620
I think it's Simone.

02:28:23.620 --> 02:28:27.380
I think it's got Nick, but I think, I think that is the final two for sure.

02:28:27.380 --> 02:28:29.620
I think it's Simone and got make it the final two for sure.

02:28:30.260 --> 02:28:31.060
So who knows?

02:28:31.060 --> 02:28:35.300
I'm actually really happy with Simone, but I think that got Nick has.

02:28:36.580 --> 02:28:38.020
A different kind of artistry.

02:28:38.580 --> 02:28:39.080
Mm hmm.

02:28:39.620 --> 02:28:46.980
And, uh, I mean, I actually thought that got Nick and, uh, candy should have won the, uh,

02:28:48.020 --> 02:28:48.980
the, the challenge.

02:28:49.780 --> 02:28:53.940
Um, so speaking of like video games, I can actually tie a drag race to video games.

02:28:53.940 --> 02:28:59.620
I actually retweeted Simone dressed up as, uh, Jesse from team rocket.

02:28:59.620 --> 02:29:03.540
And so I did not know Simone was a bit of a gamer, but, uh, that was the thing she posted

02:29:03.540 --> 02:29:05.540
on, uh, uh, social media today.

02:29:05.540 --> 02:29:10.980
So I was like, Oh, my queen, even though I, I, I, I, I want them all to be successful.

02:29:10.980 --> 02:29:12.740
You know, there it's a, it's a good group.

02:29:12.740 --> 02:29:13.380
They have this year.

02:29:13.380 --> 02:29:15.380
I'll tell you what, I don't hate candy muse anymore.

02:29:16.340 --> 02:29:16.580
Yeah.

02:29:16.580 --> 02:29:18.980
She's I she's, she's there for a reason.

02:29:19.620 --> 02:29:24.580
Gotten to be a lot better of a person and definitely isn't like silky who was just annoying.

02:29:25.460 --> 02:29:27.460
I'm looking at chat, uh, quickly.

02:29:27.460 --> 02:29:30.340
Cause, uh, there's a followup to the real media thing that came up.

02:29:30.340 --> 02:29:33.780
Real media still exists says Bobby Blackwell for the link.

02:29:33.780 --> 02:29:38.340
Uh, looks like real networks works mostly with streaming services.

02:29:38.340 --> 02:29:42.820
So maybe they kind of facilitate, um, streaming at this point now, which is kind of what they

02:29:42.820 --> 02:29:48.260
were doing before, but they're not so much like the go-to destination to see the streaming stuff,

02:29:48.260 --> 02:29:52.740
um, that other websites like Twitch have become so interesting.

02:29:52.740 --> 02:29:54.340
I had no idea real networks was still around.

02:29:54.340 --> 02:29:55.220
Well, congrats.

02:29:55.220 --> 02:30:00.820
Isn't life 365 back to like, they, they sunset it and then they like came back, I think,

02:30:00.820 --> 02:30:02.980
but I'm not sure they're exactly what they were before.

02:30:03.780 --> 02:30:04.580
I'm double checking.

02:30:05.780 --> 02:30:07.860
I thought that was their website is up.

02:30:08.740 --> 02:30:09.460
Yeah.

02:30:09.460 --> 02:30:15.060
But are they still like radio stations and stuff or internet radio program?

02:30:15.060 --> 02:30:16.900
Real people and not an algorithm.

02:30:16.900 --> 02:30:17.300
Wow.

02:30:17.860 --> 02:30:18.740
So they came back.

02:30:19.780 --> 02:30:22.500
Cause I, I re I remember, yeah, it was 2016.

02:30:22.500 --> 02:30:23.460
I'm looking real quick.

02:30:23.460 --> 02:30:24.660
Uh, it was in 2016.

02:30:24.660 --> 02:30:25.300
They stopped.

02:30:25.300 --> 02:30:28.980
And I remember we had a whole thing where we were like, pour one out for life 365, where

02:30:28.980 --> 02:30:31.940
it all began end of an era and all that stuff.

02:30:31.940 --> 02:30:37.780
Uh, it looks like, okay, so in 2018, they reorganized under media Creek and they are

02:30:37.780 --> 02:30:40.420
back in the U S Canada and United Kingdom.

02:30:41.300 --> 02:30:41.780
Interesting.

02:30:41.780 --> 02:30:42.980
Well, good, good for them.

02:30:42.980 --> 02:30:44.260
That's where we got our start.

02:30:44.260 --> 02:30:44.760
Hey.

02:30:46.340 --> 02:30:46.980
Yeah.

02:30:46.980 --> 02:30:50.340
And yeah, they have like two different models.

02:30:50.340 --> 02:30:53.220
One's ad supported and the other's non ad supported.

02:30:53.220 --> 02:30:57.620
Oh, I think that's kind of how it worked before actually very similar.

02:30:58.340 --> 02:31:00.740
Cause I remember, yeah, you could have, we had two streams.

02:31:00.740 --> 02:31:02.180
One was the ad supported stream.

02:31:02.180 --> 02:31:06.260
One was the, because they would be on different songs depending on where the listener was

02:31:06.260 --> 02:31:06.340
at.

02:31:06.340 --> 02:31:09.140
It was always weird, but yeah, apparently you can't monetize them.

02:31:09.780 --> 02:31:10.580
Oh, interesting.

02:31:11.860 --> 02:31:13.300
Unless, okay.

02:31:13.300 --> 02:31:16.180
So if you put their ads on there, you can monetize.

02:31:16.980 --> 02:31:18.580
Oh, of course.

02:31:18.580 --> 02:31:19.300
Of course.

02:31:19.300 --> 02:31:20.420
Uh, who, who was there?

02:31:20.420 --> 02:31:21.700
Who in chat was there?

02:31:21.700 --> 02:31:24.500
Who remembers the orange lounge radio station on life 365?

02:31:25.300 --> 02:31:27.060
Who is there in chat?

02:31:27.060 --> 02:31:29.780
I'm kind of curious how many are still around from those days.

02:31:29.860 --> 02:31:31.780
Our dial up friendly radio station.

02:31:32.900 --> 02:31:33.540
Yeah.

02:31:33.540 --> 02:31:36.340
That you could, that was the thing, that was, that was one of the big things that

02:31:36.340 --> 02:31:39.140
differentiated us from DDR free radio at the time.

02:31:39.140 --> 02:31:41.300
DDR free radio was broadband only.

02:31:41.300 --> 02:31:43.220
We were dial up friendly radio.

02:31:43.220 --> 02:31:49.460
So it was doing, you know, cause we, we were doing this before podcasting existed.

02:31:49.460 --> 02:31:49.960
Right.

02:31:51.140 --> 02:31:57.220
And I, so many friends that I have now, I made through the early days of the show.

02:31:58.660 --> 02:31:59.540
So, oh, for sure.

02:31:59.940 --> 02:32:02.420
There's a lot of you in chat that are like, me, me, me, me.

02:32:02.420 --> 02:32:03.060
Hell yeah.

02:32:03.060 --> 02:32:04.180
So, well, thanks.

02:32:04.180 --> 02:32:06.100
Thank you guys for sticking with us through all these years.

02:32:06.100 --> 02:32:07.380
It really does mean a lot.

02:32:07.380 --> 02:32:11.860
And, uh, I think it's, I think it's really cool that, uh, yeah, that we have, you know,

02:32:11.860 --> 02:32:12.820
transformed the show.

02:32:12.820 --> 02:32:15.300
Here we are now doing a video thing on Twitch.

02:32:15.300 --> 02:32:18.260
I don't think we ever thought this would be a video show ever.

02:32:18.980 --> 02:32:20.740
You know, it's crazy.

02:32:20.740 --> 02:32:23.060
And now how long did it take you to get me on video?

02:32:23.860 --> 02:32:29.700
A pandemic, which, which even still I was like, you could just be on Discord and not

02:32:30.180 --> 02:32:33.460
point the camera at like a doll or something or a stuffed animal.

02:32:33.460 --> 02:32:38.420
But, um, I'm, I'm, I'm so glad you've decided to jump in and maybe this means once we're

02:32:38.420 --> 02:32:41.060
all back together, we can all be on cam, which would be fantastic.

02:32:41.620 --> 02:32:44.260
So I still like putting random things up in front of the camera.

02:32:44.260 --> 02:32:44.980
That's kind of funny.

02:32:44.980 --> 02:32:45.620
Yeah, yeah.

02:32:46.500 --> 02:32:48.180
So that's, that's fun.

02:32:48.180 --> 02:32:51.940
Um, what else is I going to say about all the old school days and all that stuff?

02:32:51.940 --> 02:32:54.740
Oh, and the, the long running podcast stuff.

02:32:54.740 --> 02:32:59.540
So yeah, I, you know, we, we do have that one little claim is that we're the longest

02:32:59.540 --> 02:33:05.620
running gaming show out there because the life through 65 years kind of added some time

02:33:05.620 --> 02:33:10.260
to this show that nobody else is able to get, you know, a lot of Guinness thing, a lot of

02:33:10.260 --> 02:33:11.940
the long running shows out there.

02:33:11.940 --> 02:33:14.180
And again, this is not a knock to any of those shows.

02:33:14.980 --> 02:33:19.780
They, everybody has worked very hard and I'm all about supporting other indie shows and

02:33:19.780 --> 02:33:22.740
you should be listening to all these other great shows that have been around forever.

02:33:22.740 --> 02:33:26.820
Um, but, uh, the one, the reason why we're able to kind of say, oh, we got about a year

02:33:26.820 --> 02:33:30.420
and a half on everybody else is because we were on life through 65 before podcasting

02:33:30.420 --> 02:33:31.060
was a thing.

02:33:31.060 --> 02:33:35.620
And then, but we jumped, we jumped on podcasting pretty quick with that whole to go edition.

02:33:35.620 --> 02:33:37.060
It still wasn't in iTunes.

02:33:37.060 --> 02:33:39.780
We were still doing a podcast before iTunes.

02:33:39.780 --> 02:33:43.620
So I think the, uh, random message for him, I was reading that clued me in on that.

02:33:44.980 --> 02:33:46.420
Uh, DJ Rama S in chat.

02:33:46.420 --> 02:33:48.020
And by the way, this is the part of the show.

02:33:48.020 --> 02:33:51.220
If you want us to do tangents now, this is the time to yell them out and chat.

02:33:51.220 --> 02:33:52.260
So go for it.

02:33:52.260 --> 02:33:56.500
Uh, such as this one, uh, DJ Rama S says, remember O L R at Fanta Mae.

02:33:57.060 --> 02:33:58.100
I sure, I sure do.

02:33:58.100 --> 02:34:00.500
The question wasn't for me, but I sure do.

02:34:00.500 --> 02:34:00.900
Of course.

02:34:00.900 --> 02:34:05.540
I'm sure dark soccer and Loki remember that I love doing the live shows.

02:34:05.540 --> 02:34:08.100
I wish we had had a chance to do more of them.

02:34:08.100 --> 02:34:10.580
Sometimes it's just hard to get us all together.

02:34:10.580 --> 02:34:15.060
I would love for all three of us to go to dragon con and do a show there, but I know

02:34:15.060 --> 02:34:18.660
the reality is it's going to be hard for Loki to get away from the kids for that amount

02:34:18.660 --> 02:34:19.300
of time.

02:34:19.300 --> 02:34:25.060
I would still want to do it, but I'm definitely going next year because we're going to have

02:34:25.540 --> 02:34:26.980
the layout army.

02:34:26.980 --> 02:34:27.480
Yeah.

02:34:27.940 --> 02:34:28.180
Yeah.

02:34:28.180 --> 02:34:31.860
And this year we still, you know, dragon con is still kind of like up in the air as it

02:34:31.860 --> 02:34:32.020
is.

02:34:32.020 --> 02:34:33.940
We ju we just don't know the period.

02:34:33.940 --> 02:34:36.820
We're not going to know until that.

02:34:36.820 --> 02:34:37.380
What was it?

02:34:37.380 --> 02:34:38.180
60, 90 days.

02:34:38.180 --> 02:34:41.940
So I think 60 days before we're just not going to know, just like last year, I think it was

02:34:41.940 --> 02:34:42.820
around the 4th of July.

02:34:42.820 --> 02:34:42.980
Right.

02:34:42.980 --> 02:34:46.820
We found we're not going to know till then and whatever, but I think it is better to

02:34:46.820 --> 02:34:47.700
bank on next year.

02:34:47.700 --> 02:34:48.820
Probably just 60 days.

02:34:48.820 --> 02:34:49.380
Yeah.

02:34:49.380 --> 02:34:52.980
Next year there will be, you know, and that's a good one to bank on Loki.

02:34:52.980 --> 02:34:54.980
I'd love it if you could come, but I understand he has kids.

02:34:55.540 --> 02:34:57.140
I would still love it if I could come too.

02:34:57.700 --> 02:35:02.100
You know, we can always, there is still, you know, dark soccer, if you're going to be there,

02:35:02.100 --> 02:35:03.620
there's a couple of ways we can do it.

02:35:03.620 --> 02:35:06.820
We can always allow Bobby Black Wolf to have third chair because he's a big part of this

02:35:06.820 --> 02:35:08.900
show, but Loki is a part of this show too.

02:35:09.700 --> 02:35:13.220
So I would think we should just, and I think they did this one year.

02:35:13.220 --> 02:35:17.380
They had their co-host come in via Skype, but they had a lot of issues with it, but

02:35:17.380 --> 02:35:19.540
I think they've ironed a lot of that out.

02:35:19.540 --> 02:35:24.660
So Loki may, I'm not going to promise anything, especially when it's not my track, not my

02:35:24.660 --> 02:35:27.860
programming, but if we wanted to do that, since dark soccer and I will both be there,

02:35:27.860 --> 02:35:30.580
we could probably Skype Loki in or something like that.

02:35:30.580 --> 02:35:33.540
The only thing for you, Loki, is that it might be at like 7 AM.

02:35:33.540 --> 02:35:34.020
You're tight.

02:35:34.020 --> 02:35:36.180
It just depends on what time slot they give us.

02:35:36.180 --> 02:35:39.540
And it's going to be three hours earlier for you, but we could probably work it out.

02:35:40.260 --> 02:35:40.760
So.

02:35:41.780 --> 02:35:42.340
Yeah.

02:35:42.340 --> 02:35:45.540
So, you know, it comes, but I miss conventions in general.

02:35:45.540 --> 02:35:51.620
I just, I've wanted to attend more medium sized cons and actually have like a vog network

02:35:51.620 --> 02:35:52.100
table there.

02:35:52.100 --> 02:35:54.980
Cause I think that's the best way to get word of mouth out there.

02:35:54.980 --> 02:35:57.940
Did anybody find us through a con or finding us IRL?

02:35:58.820 --> 02:35:59.320
I don't know.

02:36:00.180 --> 02:36:01.060
Maybe not so many.

02:36:01.060 --> 02:36:04.580
I'm not recognizing a lot of names where I remember that, but.

02:36:04.580 --> 02:36:12.260
Well, I, uh, I invited, uh, Nika in here to join us through our, uh, supernatural chat

02:36:12.260 --> 02:36:12.820
group.

02:36:12.820 --> 02:36:13.540
Well, yeah.

02:36:13.540 --> 02:36:16.740
And social media is a huge, that's why I always say at the end of every show, help us spread

02:36:16.740 --> 02:36:21.300
the word, a tweet, uh, sharing like that goes an awful long way and you never know, you

02:36:21.300 --> 02:36:23.380
know, who might benefit from finding this show.

02:36:23.380 --> 02:36:24.020
So welcome.

02:36:24.020 --> 02:36:24.520
Welcome.

02:36:25.300 --> 02:36:25.800
Yeah.

02:36:26.420 --> 02:36:34.420
And, but I mean, I've had a few people who, uh, you know, like, just like friends who

02:36:34.420 --> 02:36:37.700
have said, Oh yeah, I downloaded the podcast to check it out, you know?

02:36:37.700 --> 02:36:40.420
So a few, a few IRLs.

02:36:41.540 --> 02:36:43.860
Do you know what I did yesterday that I haven't done?

02:36:43.860 --> 02:36:46.820
And maybe I shouldn't even say this on air because there's going to be a very logical

02:36:46.820 --> 02:36:51.140
follow-up question that I don't want to answer on air, but yesterday for the first time in

02:36:51.700 --> 02:36:54.500
six years, I actually looked at our stats.

02:36:55.300 --> 02:36:55.780
I swear.

02:36:55.780 --> 02:37:00.980
And people don't believe me when I say this, I was, um, I, I was in there just because

02:37:00.980 --> 02:37:03.860
I could be, I was like, you know, I haven't looked at this in a long, long time.

02:37:03.860 --> 02:37:06.740
I'm curious, how many downloads is the show getting?

02:37:06.740 --> 02:37:08.260
And so I got the answer to that question.

02:37:08.820 --> 02:37:11.940
Um, and I will say, I, I'm not going to tell you, sorry.

02:37:11.940 --> 02:37:16.340
Those are, that's just our business, but I'll get, I'm well, I'll tell you guys off air,

02:37:16.900 --> 02:37:19.300
but, um, I'll give you a twofold answer.

02:37:19.860 --> 02:37:24.340
It's not as big as it used to be, but it's higher than I thought it was.

02:37:25.700 --> 02:37:29.620
There's a lot of people out there who I think are lurking, who listen that don't

02:37:29.620 --> 02:37:30.740
interact and that's okay.

02:37:30.740 --> 02:37:34.740
I'm not, this isn't, this isn't a call out tweet or anything like that as perfectly.

02:37:34.740 --> 02:37:35.140
Okay.

02:37:35.140 --> 02:37:36.660
We love and appreciate you guys too.

02:37:36.660 --> 02:37:38.980
The silent observers, you guys rule.

02:37:38.980 --> 02:37:44.260
Um, but, uh, yeah, it's, I, I'm always kind of, when I see it, I'm like, oh, that is more

02:37:44.260 --> 02:37:48.980
than I thought because, you know, we get, you know, 40 people, maybe max here live on

02:37:48.980 --> 02:37:49.620
a Sunday night.

02:37:49.620 --> 02:37:52.740
And so I think, oh, maybe there's another 40 to listen on the podcast feed.

02:37:52.740 --> 02:37:56.340
And no, it's, it's, uh, it's actually doing a little bit better than that.

02:37:56.340 --> 02:37:57.700
So that's, uh, there's that.

02:37:59.220 --> 02:38:02.580
Bobby Blackoff in chat says, I still have so many VOG flyers, lol.

02:38:02.580 --> 02:38:08.900
And the sad thing is they're all out of date now because so many shows have sunsetted,

02:38:08.900 --> 02:38:12.900
gone to another network, um, you know, or whatever the case may be.

02:38:12.900 --> 02:38:16.900
We really still need to like build an army of shows, but I just don't see that really

02:38:16.900 --> 02:38:20.100
happening in force until we get to the other side of this pandemic.

02:38:20.100 --> 02:38:24.820
And we can talk about who wants to join up to go to cons together and spread the word

02:38:24.820 --> 02:38:26.180
and do that whole thing again.

02:38:26.180 --> 02:38:27.540
So soon, soon.

02:38:28.100 --> 02:38:30.100
Oh, one of our lurkers said hi.

02:38:30.100 --> 02:38:33.460
Hey, y'all, I said it wasn't a call out tweet, but thank you.

02:38:33.460 --> 02:38:36.660
Mr. Rhizos in chat says lurker here, but love the show.

02:38:36.660 --> 02:38:38.100
Well, thank you very much for that.

02:38:38.100 --> 02:38:39.780
And lurk all you want.

02:38:39.780 --> 02:38:44.100
Just the fact that people, just the fact that people give a shit on what we have to say

02:38:44.100 --> 02:38:48.420
and don't, um, unsubscribe the minute I go on a tangent and talk about something that's

02:38:48.420 --> 02:38:51.940
not video games, which I may have done once or twice tonight.

02:38:51.940 --> 02:38:56.260
Um, it wouldn't be a show without a tangent.

02:38:56.260 --> 02:38:57.060
It wouldn't.

02:38:57.060 --> 02:38:59.300
How do you do a three hour show about video games?

02:38:59.860 --> 02:39:04.420
It's not just about video games, actually.

02:39:04.420 --> 02:39:07.860
The secret is weird stuff on my desk.

02:39:08.740 --> 02:39:09.300
All right.

02:39:09.300 --> 02:39:11.860
By the way, I'm just putting it all on camera because of reasons.

02:39:11.860 --> 02:39:15.700
Let me check in with Loki and see if he has any last minute stories for us tonight.

02:39:16.420 --> 02:39:18.740
No, this is an incredibly slow week.

02:39:19.780 --> 02:39:20.740
It was.

02:39:20.740 --> 02:39:22.020
It was kind of a slow week.

02:39:22.020 --> 02:39:23.220
So, um, all right.

02:39:23.220 --> 02:39:24.740
Well, no last minute stories there.

02:39:24.740 --> 02:39:27.300
All my Mario news that we never got.

02:39:27.300 --> 02:39:28.260
So, yeah.

02:39:29.460 --> 02:39:29.700
Yeah.

02:39:29.700 --> 02:39:30.580
What's that about?

02:39:30.580 --> 02:39:33.380
Or were we expecting stuff on March 10th or what?

02:39:33.940 --> 02:39:34.980
Well, it's Mario day.

02:39:34.980 --> 02:39:38.980
Like last year, I think they showed off, uh, some of the Lego Mario stuff.

02:39:38.980 --> 02:39:42.340
Um, yeah, nothing this year.

02:39:43.540 --> 02:39:44.340
All right.

02:39:44.340 --> 02:39:49.860
And still no word on the, um, year of Zelda everybody was hoping for, which is very sad,

02:39:49.860 --> 02:39:52.820
but maybe there's something about that March 31st date.

02:39:52.820 --> 02:39:58.660
You know, the new fiscal year where, you know, cause they still plan on no more 3d all star

02:39:58.660 --> 02:40:03.060
thing, no more, uh, uh, Mario 35 and all that stuff.

02:40:03.060 --> 02:40:04.020
That's all going away.

02:40:05.060 --> 02:40:07.380
They already, they already got my money.

02:40:07.380 --> 02:40:08.900
So sucker.

02:40:08.900 --> 02:40:09.220
All right.

02:40:09.860 --> 02:40:11.460
No, it's my kids wanted it.

02:40:11.460 --> 02:40:14.020
Uh, it's hard to say no in that case.

02:40:14.020 --> 02:40:14.980
All right.

02:40:14.980 --> 02:40:15.940
Uh, that's it.

02:40:15.940 --> 02:40:19.460
Uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts and then we'll be on our way out of here.

02:40:19.460 --> 02:40:23.860
So, um, I, uh, Oh, I should say, as I always say at the end of every show,

02:40:23.860 --> 02:40:26.500
thank you so much for downloading our show or listening to us live.

02:40:26.500 --> 02:40:30.660
However, you consumed OLR, whether you were very, very vocal and chatted a lot,

02:40:30.660 --> 02:40:34.340
uh, or if you were just lurking out there, thank you so much for participating with our

02:40:34.340 --> 02:40:35.060
show tonight.

02:40:35.060 --> 02:40:36.660
We really appreciate you guys being here.

02:40:36.660 --> 02:40:40.580
Um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at OLR, uh, help us spread the word, tell a friend

02:40:40.580 --> 02:40:41.460
or two about the show.

02:40:41.460 --> 02:40:45.700
Cause as dark soccer pointed out a moment ago, social media is very powerful in spreading

02:40:45.700 --> 02:40:46.020
the word.

02:40:46.020 --> 02:40:47.620
So we really appreciate the tweets.

02:40:47.620 --> 02:40:49.940
And I actually saw a couple of really kind tweets this week.

02:40:49.940 --> 02:40:52.420
I try to reply to those when I see them or at least like them.

02:40:52.420 --> 02:40:56.500
Um, so thank you so much to those of you that are spreading the word about OLR out there.

02:40:56.500 --> 02:41:02.580
Um, uh, a host here on a Twitch for VOG network that goes a long, long way.

02:41:02.580 --> 02:41:05.620
Even if you don't stream a lot yourself, it still helps us get the word out.

02:41:05.620 --> 02:41:07.540
So we appreciate all those auto hosts.

02:41:07.540 --> 02:41:09.460
So, um, okay.

02:41:09.460 --> 02:41:16.820
So, um, that is, um, gonna otherwise I think, oh, if you, um, want to help the show out,

02:41:16.820 --> 02:41:19.700
like with money, we appreciate the bits and subs and all that.

02:41:19.700 --> 02:41:21.940
You don't have to, but we're just saying we really appreciate it.

02:41:21.940 --> 02:41:24.340
And the shop of vognetwork.com slash shop.

02:41:24.340 --> 02:41:27.140
If you want to get some merchandise, but again, please don't feel obligated.

02:41:27.140 --> 02:41:30.180
It's just for the way that we get a new merchandise in the shop.

02:41:31.140 --> 02:41:31.940
Soon.

02:41:31.940 --> 02:41:32.580
Trademark.

02:41:33.860 --> 02:41:34.340
All right.

02:41:34.900 --> 02:41:38.580
Um, let us wrap it up with our final thoughts tonight.

02:41:38.580 --> 02:41:41.780
So, uh, dark Sakura, I'll start with you.

02:41:41.780 --> 02:41:43.860
You're, you're showing all the stuff off on cam there.

02:41:43.860 --> 02:41:44.740
What's your final thought tonight?

02:41:45.620 --> 02:41:50.900
Um, I found a bunch of my Instax photos from Easter two years ago with the sisters and

02:41:50.900 --> 02:41:55.140
my Disneyland pictures, uh, from the last, uh, dry con I attended.

02:41:55.700 --> 02:41:59.780
Including, and I don't know why I can never remember his name, but the, the, um,

02:41:59.860 --> 02:42:08.260
uh, yeah, but I also found my, my picture of James St. James that he basically was like,

02:42:08.260 --> 02:42:09.620
let's take a picture together.

02:42:09.620 --> 02:42:10.580
Grab photo.

02:42:11.860 --> 02:42:12.260
Love it.

02:42:13.060 --> 02:42:13.380
Yeah.

02:42:13.380 --> 02:42:14.340
He was pretty cool dude.

02:42:14.340 --> 02:42:14.820
Pretty nice.

02:42:15.540 --> 02:42:15.780
Nice.

02:42:16.660 --> 02:42:17.460
All right.

02:42:17.460 --> 02:42:18.820
Uh, how about Loki?

02:42:18.820 --> 02:42:19.700
Your final thought tonight?

02:42:20.740 --> 02:42:29.140
I'm still trying to locate some buddy to be able to do a label printing and if box packaging,

02:42:29.140 --> 02:42:32.500
I don't even know where to find that.

02:42:33.140 --> 02:42:34.980
It may be just labeled printing.

02:42:34.980 --> 02:42:40.260
And then they have, they have some other alternatives that are more rental case than

02:42:41.460 --> 02:42:44.180
cardboard box, but it may have to go with that.

02:42:44.180 --> 02:42:48.100
I, I may have some hookups from my printing days.

02:42:49.220 --> 02:42:49.620
All right.

02:42:49.620 --> 02:42:53.220
And I was also going to say, get in touch with the game developers, people here locally,

02:42:53.220 --> 02:42:56.740
because, um, they, they will have all those same questions too.

02:42:57.460 --> 02:43:03.620
So there's a couple of, there's a couple of print shops in town that will do like the

02:43:03.620 --> 02:43:06.340
actual like boxes to specification.

02:43:06.340 --> 02:43:10.420
You just need to have the template ready high res, but we can talk about that offline.

02:43:10.420 --> 02:43:10.660
Yeah.

02:43:11.300 --> 02:43:11.540
Okay.

02:43:12.980 --> 02:43:18.260
Um, and then my final thought tonight is when you can get your VAX, get your VAX.

02:43:18.260 --> 02:43:23.860
Look, I got, I got, I got my, I got my microchip quote using my quotey fingers,

02:43:23.860 --> 02:43:26.260
tongue firmly planted in cheek today.

02:43:26.260 --> 02:43:30.180
And I'm, I'm fine and I'm here and I'm excited.

02:43:30.180 --> 02:43:33.380
So I'm excited when everybody else is able to get theirs as well.

02:43:33.380 --> 02:43:36.100
Um, hopefully we really do get to the end of this thing.

02:43:36.100 --> 02:43:36.500
All right.

02:43:36.500 --> 02:43:38.980
Uh, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:43:38.980 --> 02:43:40.580
Thank you guys so much for being here.

02:43:40.580 --> 02:43:42.180
Uh, we will see you in seven days.

02:43:42.180 --> 02:43:44.980
Let's do it all again for 861.

02:43:44.980 --> 02:43:46.260
We'll see you next week.
