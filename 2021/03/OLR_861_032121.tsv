0	14300	Any act of creation at scale is a strange beast. Businesses often prioritize so much
14300	18440	time and effort into quote big wins that they overlook the small fixes that can add up to
18440	23260	a more significant win. Toast, a Grand Theft Auto player, not a Rockstar employee, having
23260	27600	no access to GTA source code, diagnosed and implemented a change that improved PC load
27600	33520	times by 70% of a multiple minutes long process. This wasn't worth the time of Rockstar employees?
33520	37120	At least they did write and made it worth Host's time and effort.
37120	41240	This is the update to a fantastic story. Join your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and
41240	44200	Loki for more of this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in
44200	47160	the show where every gamer has a voice.
47160	55120	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
55120	62200	where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with
62200	70320	episode number 861 for this March the 21st of 2021. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joining
70320	75200	you here from the studio where we would usually tape in person, but obviously with everything
75200	79560	going on in the world for the past year now, we have been taping thanks to the magic of
79560	83920	Discord. So I am joined remotely by the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
83920	84920	Hello.
84920	85920	Hi, how are you?
85920	90320	I'm all right. It's, uh, I pulled my shoulder or something.
90320	91960	Ouch. I'm sorry to hear that.
91960	95080	Yeah, that's okay. That's what drugs are for.
95080	99840	And you have a nice new, um, well, it's kind of new setup. I know you got a new...
99840	101400	Oh, I have a super new setup.
101400	104400	Yeah. And your camera looks a little like it's weird because you didn't change your
104400	106840	camera, but it still looks nicer somehow.
106840	113600	Yeah. Well, um, my, my old, what, 12 year? No, it was a little bit less than that. Maybe
113640	122320	10 year old PC has now been replaced with a shiny new Mac Mini M1 and it is super fast.
122320	130960	I was playing in Logic Pro earlier today, making music. Um, I also, uh, got one of those
130960	142760	LG, uh, HD, uh, ultrawide monitors with a very lovely refresh rate on it. Um, and, uh,
142760	151080	so far I'm really feeling no pain. I love my new machine. Um, I think that it processes
151080	157760	now people are saying that I sound a little bit quieter, but, um, I think though that
157760	165320	I'm dealing with a system that's going to work better for sound processing. So, and
165320	169560	I did do some audio balancing tonight. So those listening either live or on the podcast
169560	173440	feed may notice our volume is a little different. Cause even I noticed on some prior episodes,
173440	177920	I was way quieter than like Loki. So like I, I tried to balance some things out with
177920	182320	you getting the new setup. So it might just take a little bit of adjusting too.
182320	190280	I just moved my mic a little bit to where I'm actually speaking into it. So, um, well,
190280	195600	and I have the same mold, cheap ring light I got on wish an age ago and which does well
195600	202280	enough. Hey, whatever works. But I mean, this is the setup that I wanted from the get go.
202280	209400	You know, I, I really like my, my audio technical mic and I finally have my pop filter problem
209400	215120	figured out. And you know, I just need, I needed this computer. I still have my PC.
215120	219280	I'm just trying to decide what I'm going to do when mass effects comes out. If they don't
219280	225280	do a Mac version. Now quickly, before I move on to Loki, I did want to mention you texted
225280	230360	me when you got your new setup because you had to send me your background on your new
230360	234560	like ultra widescreen monitor and it's perfect. I wish you could show it, but obviously it's
234560	239120	going to be hard to do with the camera, but describe your new background for folks.
239120	246240	It is, it is, uh, the scene from super Metroid where the, uh, scientists are dead in the
246240	252400	Metroid is sitting inside the little tube in the center, but it's a widescreen version
252400	260320	of it. So I reckon they just took different screenshots and splice them together. And
260320	264640	if you guys remember the title screen to super Metroid, you'll kind of laugh at this because,
264640	268480	um, dark soccer called me earlier today so we could do a check and she didn't have a
268480	273480	ring light on because you know, when we're not live, we can be like a glance, not glamorous.
273480	278520	And I was like, you, you sound fine, but you look blue and it's because her background
278520	282400	with that Metroid, you know, it's very blue and super Metroid, if you remember, right.
282400	285720	And she's like, if my background is glowing on me, I was like, Oh, that's funny. Cause
285720	291740	you look like you just got out of the movie avatar. So I'll turn off my ring light. So,
291740	295600	so maybe it'll show. Okay. A little, yeah, it's just, you're a little purple when you
295600	301720	do that. Yes. A little bit, girl, look how blue you look. All right. Let's say wearing
301720	306400	a blue shirt. Let's say hello to tech master. Loki. Hey, Loki. Hey, how's it going? Good.
306400	311840	How are you? I'm doing fine. So, um, apparently, uh, I was talking a little bit last week about
311840	316920	getting the first shot of Moderna vaccine because that had happened earlier in the day.
316920	322620	And I never really had any side effects besides the sore arm, but I heard that you got your
322620	328580	shot in the last couple of days. Yeah. So I got the Johnson and Johnson shot on Friday.
328580	337740	So that one, unlike the Moderna and the Pfizer one are it's one and done. So I'm done. Well,
337740	341880	tech, technically you have to wait two weeks. So the antibodies to build up, but yes, for
341880	345700	all intents and purposes, you're done. So, um, so you're going to be, you're going to
345700	351740	be, so I, I did your wife get the same one. Yeah, she did. Cause I know when she saw me
351740	355100	getting mine, she was like, I've been trying to get mine for what's going on, you know,
355100	358860	that whole type of thing. But now the funny thing is you guys are going to be fully immunized
358860	362740	before I am, because I have to wait till April 11th to get the second shot because of the
362740	369740	whole Johnson and Johnson thing. So, um, but that's, you know, and again, don't, uh, if
369740	373980	you can get vaccinated folks and I see, I'm seeing more people on Facebook talking about
373980	377420	it. I'm seeing more people on Twitter talking about it. I'm seeing people in chat talking
377420	381420	about it. So it's great that more people are getting their shots. If you're getting frustrated
381420	385140	because you can't get a vaccine yet, cause you don't qualify or whatever. I wouldn't
385140	390140	keep, keep this in the back of your mind. Every person that gets vaccinated is one more
390140	394780	weapon against the virus because that's one less person that the virus can get to. So
394780	398900	every person that gets vaccinated is help. So, uh, think of it that way. And it makes
398900	403540	it a lot less frustrating and it's, it's nice to see that it is ramping up. That's for sure.
403540	407540	Compared to where we were like back in January. Um, and yeah, they opened it up to everybody
407620	412140	like literally days after, like they told my wife, no, you can't get it. It was like
412140	417900	the next day they're all, Oh, you can't get it, but now you can. So well, it's still officially
417900	425900	not open to everybody. It's uh, right now that I think they're on tier one C. So it
425900	432020	might also just depend on where you go. That's true. But I got, because I have some preexisting
432020	439180	conditions. I got my alert through, uh, your turn, which is the California signup deal
439180	446060	for it. And so, um, now I know mine's one of the, the two, two shot ones cause it said
446060	451460	so on the website. I just don't know which one. So, well, and I was, I was laughing right
451460	456260	before we went on air tonight because if I got Moderna and Loki got Johnson and Johnson,
456260	459900	it would be really funny if dark soccer got Pfizer, although at the end of the day she
459900	464500	should take whatever they give her. But, uh, okay. It's, it's, it's half, it's half
464500	468140	and half now. We know it's, since it's going to be a two shot one, we know it's not J and
468140	472480	J so it's going to be one of the others. That would be really funny if each cohost here
472480	476980	had a different vaccine. That would be very, very funny. And then we would only allow guests
476980	482820	from overseas who got AstraZeneca.
482820	486820	It's just fun to say that though. It is. Well, and apparently I guess I heard the thing cause
486820	489700	they haven't authorized that one in the U S yet, even though I think they're using it
489700	493840	in Europe, but apparently they were like warehousing a bunch of that vaccine here.
493840	497840	We will get to video games, I promise. But this stuff is interesting because this stuff
497840	503340	is how we get conventions back. The AstraZeneca, I guess we were hoarding it here for when
503340	507940	they do authorize it. But they ended up sending a bunch of it, I guess, to Canada and Mexico
507940	513580	where it is authorized. So kind of interesting. So helping, helping to get the world vaccinated
513580	518460	a little more. So, all right. And some folks in chat are talking about the vaccines they
518460	522940	got. So DJ Rama S says, I got Pfizer and Bobby got Pfizer and says, Joe and Matt got
522940	528420	Pfizer. All right, fair enough. I mean, our, our chat room, as we often say, is the fourth
528420	533020	listener of our show because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network,
533020	537780	twitch.tv slash VOG network or VOG network, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern
537780	542620	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. So if a dark soccer ends up getting Moderna too,
542620	547440	then fine. Our chat room completes the Trinity there. So there we go. All right. Black and
547440	556080	Pat in chat says, I got sheet because Florida fingers because of Dolly. I know, I know.
556080	559120	And I think I said this last week, I really wouldn't have cared which of the three they
559120	563040	gave me. It was a huge relief just to get the vaccine. But the fact that I did get the
563040	567520	Dolly vaccine is like, okay, this does feel correct. Like I'm, I'm more than okay with
567520	572680	this. So we've been blessed by St. Dolly. That's right. That's right. All right. I,
572680	576440	it is a video game show. So let's talk about some video games. Let's talk about some big
576440	581800	news going on in the gaming world. Last week, we had the whole, um, Bethesda, um, getting
581800	587480	bought by Microsoft, which honestly it started months before it's just was official last
587480	592160	week. And then we saw, uh, quite quickly, some of the, uh, bang for the buck, shall
592160	596960	we say with the, you know, 20 Bethesda games on game pass. Uh, and you know, some of the
596960	600680	other stuff that we got there, their little fireside chat. So there was a big question
600680	606400	last week. All right. Who's Sony gonna buy? Who's Nintendo gonna buy and lo and behold,
606760	612280	Sony bought someone this week, but I would bet this was on no one shortlist, right? Loki,
612280	618560	what happened? Yeah. So they purchased, uh, Evo or I guess the evolution and championship
618560	626320	series known as Evo. So now that is going to be, I guess, under their arm, which doesn't
626320	629840	really make sense to me because Sony doesn't really have any first party fighting games.
629840	634500	I get it that there's a lot of fighting aids that are exclude. Well, they, you know, maybe
634500	641460	either it's timed exclusives or whatever on the platforms, but I guess this is, I don't
641460	648900	know how this necessarily works as far as partnerships go, but maybe I, I don't know.
648900	653460	But apparently though the original co-founders are going to be staying on as key advisors.
653460	657820	Um, doesn't sound like there's going to be too many changes as far as that goes aside
657820	663100	from it being under Sony's ownership. So, you know, some folks that were talking about
663100	667780	this in our discord, um, over a vog network.com slash discord, if you want to join our community
667780	672020	there and get in on some of the discussion, um, outside of just Sundays. And you know,
672020	676460	when we're hosting shows and live shows, um, some folks were talking about kind of reminding
676460	682460	us cause I know, you know, I'd forgotten it's been a year, but Evo had all those problems,
682460	688260	you know, kind of getting pulled into the harassment issues with the, the former CEO
688260	693340	or whoever was leading that and so forth. So, um, their brand was kinda, you know, tainted
693340	698220	a little bit from all of that last year and what that guy had done. Um, so it was interesting
698220	704300	that Sony kind of took that on, although I could also see where that is kind of a positive
704300	710620	because now Sony owns it and these problem people or person really from before can quickly
710620	714900	be, you know, ceremoniously kind of thrown out of the picture, uh, for Sony to take over.
714900	719660	But it does still seem like an interesting thing for Sony to get in on, doesn't it?
719660	725260	Yeah, exactly. Cause like I said, they don't really have any first party franchises that
725260	730340	would necessarily fit in there unless they're thinking of bringing PlayStation all stars
730340	736820	back. Um, but I mean, they did have, like I said, you know, several third party exclusives
736820	740560	for awhile. So they mean there's, you know, always been a Tekken series that used to be
740560	744160	on the original PlayStation. You've got, you know, street fighter four and five, I think
744160	750240	for even on PlayStation exclusively for a little bit. Um, it's the return of air guys
750240	757160	confirmed. Yeah. It's, it's, it's all in the cards right there. So, um, I don't know. It'd
757160	760240	be interesting to see what they do with this. I thought maybe like maybe as far as like
760240	764620	streaming this goes, they may have some sort of rights with that. Um, but they don't really
764620	769160	have a streaming service anymore. So I don't know where that's really going with it, but
769160	774600	Hey, cool that they're supporting it at least. Um, but I don't know what this means is necessarily
774600	782120	any changes for Evo. Um, maybe less killer instincts. I don't know. Um, DJ Rama S in
782120	788840	chat says, and it just scrolled off the screen. Sorry guys. I don't see Sony owning Evo as
788840	792880	a good thing, but it is what it is. I'd be curious more of your thoughts if you would
792880	797240	wouldn't mind elaborating on that. I'm kind of curious. Um, the, the why behind that,
797240	802080	um, SG100 Matt says free money. I am actually really fascinated by this acquisition. I can
802080	806480	see Sony trying to become the one-stop shop for Esports streaming. Nobody really has the
806480	811320	mantle than Twitch in a sense. The Evo move could be the start of something bigger. Well,
811320	815400	also I think something to consider is that, you know, maybe, um, PlayStation and Sony
815400	820600	is really trying to set it, set it up. Not so much, maybe like the broadcasting side
820600	825000	of Esports, but the playing and participation, because certainly when it comes to fighting
825000	830280	games, Sony's really got a lock in some ways in the fighting game sense. Like there's,
830280	834560	there's, and I'm sure someone in chat will quickly correct me, but I'm going to be honest.
834560	838900	When I think of Microsoft, I don't think of a lot of like fighting games that are like
838900	844520	huge on Xbox that Sony doesn't already have, you know? Sure. Like I know like Soul Calibur
844520	848820	6 is on game pass, but Sony's got that. You know what I mean? Um, and then when you go
848820	854080	to the Switch, you know, obviously they have Smash Brothers, but I feel like Smash Brothers
854080	858940	kind of lives on this island and Sony is always going to be like, I don't see Smash
858940	864760	Brothers leaving Evo anytime soon. Um, I think I feel like it's going to always exist on
864760	870400	its own little island and Sony is going to be perfectly okay with that. Oh Nintendo kind
870400	874640	of thing, you know, like, Oh, Oh, the kitty, the kitty match going on over there. Don't
874640	879920	hate me Smash community. This is like, I just feel like this is the attitude. Okay. From
879920	884520	the, you know, cause Nintendo sometimes gets that label and so forth, but I feel like Sony's
884520	887660	going to be more than okay with it sitting over there. And Sony really wants to take
887660	893800	the reins as, Hey, you want to play one-on-one fighting games. You're going to come to PlayStation
893800	898440	because that's where the Tekken is. That's where the Street Fighter is. That's where
898440	904140	er guys to it. Okay. Just kidding. But you know, this is the platform for all of that.
904140	908760	What do you guys think? Do you think that, you know, maybe Sony is trying to establish
908760	913760	itself as we are the fighting game console and trying to get a lock on a popular genre
913760	921440	perhaps? I think that they are seeing, Hey, this is going to print us money. That's what
921440	928280	I see. Perhaps writing games or money conventions or money. You'd have to spend it to win it.
928280	934200	Good point. Why not combine Evo with the PlayStation fan event they used to do in the winter? What
934200	940400	the hell was that called? PlayStation Fest or something? Something. Yeah. Why not? Sony
940400	946100	Wink Fest. There you go. Fifth Dream in chat says, Rob only speaks truth. Why thank you.
946100	951920	I try my best. Let's see. And as she says, no, drag the Smash community. They deserve
951920	956120	it. Hey, I know people in there that are pretty cool. I'm trying to be nice to everybody.
956120	961460	And I, Hey, I like Smash. All right. Well, and Bobby is saying that what's interesting
961460	966940	is Evo's prize pool is much lower than all of the other esports. But I think that if
966940	974220	that Evo has this reputation. True. That if you've, if you've made it at Evo, you have
974220	980180	really made it. That's true. There is a certain prestige level, but I think that, um, comparison
980180	985900	of like, I got it on sale is kind of interesting. You're right. Like the prize at what the international
985900	990700	for Dota is a way bigger, I mean, granted, that's not a fighting game either, but I get
990700	995740	it. Like that's a very different, uh, and much more expensive thing. Evo's the one everyone
995740	999220	knows. Yeah. Thank you, PixelPockets. That's what I was trying to think. A PlayStation
999220	1004580	experience. That is what it was for sure. Okay. I got an elaborate, elaborated on answer
1004580	1010460	from DJ Roma S who says, the problem is when a corporate entity buys a fan event, this
1010460	1016700	even is, this isn't even fun anymore. It becomes too corporate. The fun behind it is gone.
1016700	1022180	Case in point packs. As I was reading this, my brain was going, packs, packs, packs,
1022180	1026860	case in point packs. Packs isn't what it was because of how it's run now. People are going
1026860	1033120	to mag fest now. I, I will, you know, especially because I know Roma is really well versed
1033120	1036920	in the convention circuit because of anime jam session and the work that him and his
1036920	1041220	co-host have been doing there for a very long time and covering all the different conventions.
1041220	1050340	Public aside, um, I, I think he makes a very good point that sometimes that corporate takeover
1050340	1055140	of a fan event can really drive it into the ground. I think he makes a very excellent
1055140	1059780	point when it comes to packs and I've experienced that firsthand as have some of you, some of
1059780	1064240	you are totally fine with packs the way it is now. And this is not menace, you know,
1064240	1068420	if you're having fun, go have fun. Don't tell, don't let anyone else tell you how you can
1068420	1075700	and can't have fun. Um, but, um, for me, packs isn't really fun anymore than it is than
1075700	1082400	what it was. So maybe I went on a couple of off years. I don't know, but, um, I could
1082400	1087820	see that hesitation about the, the corporate stuff, uh, running into the ground, but PlayStation
1087820	1091660	experience was okay from what I heard. I never went myself, but I heard other people that
1091660	1097020	went and had a good time with that. So, um, and oh, I'm being reminded in chat anime jam
1097020	1102180	session was on a convention today. That's right. They were doing a zenacon. Sorry. I
1102180	1108220	get the name right. Hope I did. So my brain is only so big and can only remember so much.
1108220	1113220	Uh, Jamie, you're chatting in chat and not here. What is this about anime expo? You were
1113220	1117740	mentioning, I was just replying to Ronma. He was saying another, uh, point of corporate
1117740	1122980	run convention, anime expo. Um, FYI, AX isn't a con it's a trade show, but it used to be
1122980	1128980	a convention. Ooh, good point. E3 is the same thing. E3 is a trade show, not a convention,
1128980	1133180	but they've kind of been going the other way. Like they're, they're starting to do more
1133180	1139740	things that a convention would do. Like I went to one of the last few AXs that were
1139740	1146580	still kind of friendly sized, you know, and then they had the one at the Disneyland hotel,
1146580	1154320	which was a clusterfuck, but that's the same one that I played my first physical DDR, which
1154320	1160540	was a third mix. So in a way, anime expo brought you here to orange launch radio and the star
1160540	1167580	of the convention was a chair. Um, if anyone knew is that that AX knows the chair, you
1167580	1175260	better comment. But, um, dragon con, I also cosplayed as a Jill Valentine, that con. I
1175260	1180140	think dragon con in part is very popular because it's not corporate run. It is still
1180140	1186460	very fan run and gets, and I know, and I bet people have wanted to buy it. I mean, I don't
1186460	1191160	know nothing when it comes to that stuff, but I would bet people wanted to buy it. Um,
1191160	1195020	and they've really stuck to their guns and keep it kept at a fan thing. And that's pretty
1195020	1198780	damn impressive. You know what they're pulling off down there in Atlanta. Um, there's a reason
1198780	1204760	I travel out there every year, pandemic exception, you know, so, uh, but I can't, I can't wait
1204760	1207880	for the convention stuff to come back. I really, really hope we do get to the other side of
1207880	1217020	this where we can have conventions again. I'm wondering where they were at the Disneyland
1217020	1222900	hotel again. Cause I've always done the, uh, the, uh, Anaheim convention center, like for
1222900	1230160	the last two decades or something like that. Oh, if we're talking, I'm sorry, you playing
1230160	1237000	DDR. That would have been like, what, like 99, 2000. Yeah. All right. And it was at
1237000	1242900	the Disneyland hotel and they wouldn't let cosplayers into the park unless they had changed
1242900	1247240	out of their costume because they don't want them getting mixed up with the characters.
1247240	1252000	You can't cost them there today. Some cosplayers could, that's how Disney Disney is a Disney
1252000	1257120	binding or Disney bounding bonding, Disney bounding. That's how Disney bounding began.
1257120	1264280	Like I Disney bounded, um, in, uh, 2019 when I went to, um, drag con. And what is, what
1264280	1268400	is Disney bounding? People may not know what that is. Disney bounding is where you wear
1268400	1274320	an outfit that's reminiscent of a Disney character. Now me, I flat out well, and now they're including
1274320	1282840	Marvel and star Wars in it. I flat out just wore my captain Marvel dress and bounced around
1282840	1290240	the, the park. Um, but like I ran into this, uh, this girl who wore, uh, like a yellow
1290240	1302280	top and red leggings and she was, uh, um, uh, Gaston. And it seemed like, it's a hint
1302280	1307260	of cosplay. It's a flavor. It's a dash of flavor. It's salt bay. Some people may call
1307260	1313260	this casual cosplay. I like the casual cosplay. I like that. Yeah. But like I saw another
1313260	1319580	girl who's wearing like a blue sundress with like a white apron on it and she was Alice.
1319580	1323220	We're just going to get a little flavor of that cosplay. Just a little flavor there.
1323220	1325900	All right. Yeah. Just look at that. I mean, there's tons of Disney bounding sites. Just
1325900	1331300	look it up. All right. Yeah. All right. Anyway, uh, we've gone from Sony buying a fighting
1331300	1337060	games show to talking about Disney bounding. Hey, that's the way it goes sometimes. All
1337060	1340740	right. Uh, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing
1340740	1345220	this week. How was your gaming week and what video games have you been playing this week?
1345220	1351740	Dark soccer. We'll start with you. I played animal crossing and I played word scapes,
1351740	1359020	which I should play a little bit more simply because I, I want to get higher than a 15th
1359020	1363700	place at the tournament or better because you know, they do that tournament once a week.
1363700	1368260	Yeah. And right now I'm level 16. I haven't played in a couple of weeks, but yeah, generally
1368260	1375260	I know how it works. Oh, I freaking love this game. Like it's, it's literally my, my wake
1375260	1384980	up in the day. And if I, if I don't play, then I actually feel like my brain is like
1384980	1391780	degrading in my head. It's your brain training. So the two things that I do to, um, to wake
1391780	1400920	myself up is I play, um, word scapes and I play, uh, um, I don't play, but I do my
1400920	1408960	Duolingo, which by the way, last week I had number one in diamond league, which is like
1408960	1412300	a big achievement. I don't even know what that means. Okay. A big achievement, diamond
1412300	1416800	league is the highest level of their various leagues and you have to have a certain number
1416800	1422660	of points to be like in the top, whatever. And then like, if you're in the top 10, you
1422660	1428900	advance, if you're the top 25, you stay in your current league. And one of the achievements
1428900	1437220	was to get level, uh, number one in the diamond league. And I stayed on top of it. I think
1437220	1445560	I earned something like 4,000 experience points, which normally I will do like maybe 1200.
1445560	1452380	Okay. So I studied a lot of Japanese and I better know family units very well by now.
1452380	1456080	When are we, when are we finally going to switch on this show where you do the Japanese
1456080	1462540	release dates and I just do the, when are we doing that? Because like, I think this,
1462540	1467420	this joke of, I always mispronounce like it's getting old and, uh, I think maybe we need
1467420	1474220	to switch that up. You're getting better. I'm well, 11 years of fucking up, uh, give
1474220	1478040	a monkey a typewriter. He'll type a novel eventually. Right? Isn't that the whole thing?
1478040	1482640	Remember if it's a Japanese word that ends in an E it's not like tone, it would be Tony.
1482640	1488180	Yeah. Yeah. Uh, you just need to have you do the French releases now and then that way
1488180	1494500	you know, I know some French, I used to be conversational and then I moved to California
1494500	1499560	where no one speaks French. All right, let's move on with our gaming weeks. Loki, how was
1499560	1505940	your game week? Um, I didn't play a whole time. I mainly played Minecraft again. Uh,
1505940	1512820	I've been just kind of, I don't know, still working on the giant tree in our realm. So
1512820	1520400	it's, it's similar to one of the hermits on hermit craft. Um, it's cows, the mega Erie
1520400	1525940	of doom. So it's this giant, huge tree that I'm working on right now. So as such, I've
1525940	1531960	also been bingeing a ton of hermitcraft on YouTube. So I've pretty much caught myself
1531960	1538520	up on a mumbo's is cows and now I'm going through tango tech, but lots of a really fun
1538520	1544760	streamers on there and stuff. Um, haven't worked on my game this week, but next week
1544760	1549500	I am going to be, I actually took a couple of days off, uh, for other things and I'm
1549500	1556560	going to be splitting the audio. Um, so I can cram more music in the game. I'm not looking
1556560	1564280	for to splitting that engine, but I will give it a try and hopefully that'll work. Um, I'm
1564280	1567640	hoping to have the special edition on soon so that I can actually release the physical
1567640	1572400	version of that. Cause I know everybody's been waiting for it. So we'll give it a go
1572400	1579120	this week. All right. Super excited to see the physical addition of that. All right.
1579540	1583220	All right. My gaming week. So, um, I haven't really played a lot of new stuff. I've been,
1583220	1586060	I've been doing a lot of gaming, but it's kind of a lot of the stuff I've talked about
1586060	1590780	on the show before, uh, still playing Final Fantasy 14, uh, trying to make money, right.
1590780	1595140	It got into some crafting and I mean, I've been doing crafting, but like trying to figure
1595140	1599100	out how to play the market board a little more. So, um, and man, there are some, there
1599100	1603220	are some real sniping, you know, when the, cause, uh, the whole thing, like you'll, you'll
1603220	1607020	try to put up an item and you try to kind of put it at the lowest price. Cause that's
1607020	1610160	the one people are going to buy, right? You're, you're going to buy on the lowest price you
1610160	1613120	see on the market board. Well, there's people that'll sit there and like the minute they
1613120	1617640	see that you've listed it lower price, they'll go in and they'll do it one Gil lower. And
1617640	1620840	it just becomes this game of everybody just starting to undercut each other. And that
1620840	1625720	becomes a whole little meta game in and of itself. But I will say that item that I must
1625720	1630260	have had to update the price. I'm not kidding. Like 15 times yesterday finally sold today.
1630260	1634020	So I'm happy about that. Cause I don't have to play that game with that other person anymore
1634020	1638820	about who's going to undercut who more recently. Um, so that's an interesting little meta game
1638820	1643280	I've been getting into with FOMI SE 14. I've been continuing along and dead by daylight,
1643280	1648560	uh, enjoying my time killing. I played my first survivor match. I did not care for it.
1648560	1654120	So I'm definitely a born killer when it comes to dead by daylight. Uh, thanks to, uh, Alan
1654120	1657320	who's been doing, uh, more and more of his own streaming here. I think a lot of you,
1657320	1662240	uh, regulars here have found his channel over at Alan alchemy and watched him play stuff.
1662240	1667000	He's been getting more into killer now. Um, because he found, he played a match randomly,
1667000	1672020	I think as doctor and, uh, found that it was actually a lot of fun and I actually went
1672020	1676660	in and I, I usually play pyramid head. That's my killer of choice. I got my first four kill.
1676660	1681520	So that means like I a hundred percent want one because a dead by daylight, if you don't
1681520	1687440	already know, it's an asymmetrical PVP game. So you play one versus four and I kind of
1687440	1691620	always hesitated on dead by daylight for the longest time. I'm not big on the scary jump
1691620	1695580	scary. Well, I say that, but yet like I love silent Hill and like psychological horror
1695580	1699620	and stuff like that. I don't like the jump scare games like five nights at Freddy's.
1699620	1703940	I'll play that for laughs, but I don't enjoy it. Like I'm just going to be real. I don't
1703940	1709740	enjoy it. Um, so like the jump scare type of things aren't usually my thing. Luckily
1709740	1713340	dead by daylight. Isn't quite like I found out like actually getting in there and playing
1713340	1718020	it more and watching Alan play it. It's not really big on jump scares, but even that heartbeat
1718020	1722540	thing really messes with me because when the killer gets closer to you, the heartbeat
1722540	1730140	gets louder and louder. And so that gets, uh, that gets really scary. Um, so, uh, and
1730140	1733380	then I think if you have Michael Myers as the killer, it actually plays the Halloween
1733380	1741260	piano theme, um, a little bit. So there's that. Um, so anyway, um, I, I, I enjoy playing
1741260	1746020	as killer, um, where you're the one and you're trying to cause, cause there's no scary when
1746020	1749700	you're the killer, you're the one, you're the one causing all the scares. And so it's
1749700	1754180	a lot easier. So I found that I enjoy playing pyramid head and then thanks to Alan playing
1754180	1758100	doctor, I find that, and don't take that to a weird place. I mean, doctor, the killer
1758100	1762860	in dead by daylight, uh, that, um, I actually enjoy playing the doctor and dead by daylight
1762860	1768660	as well, who is kind of, he does like shock therapy basically. Um, so you use these shock
1768660	1773540	waves and uh, when you hit survivors with them, they'll scream out and so they kind
1773540	1776140	of give away their location. So it's kind of interesting. It's an interesting little
1776140	1781180	mechanic and really how he's very good at tracking survivors. Um, so, and that's kind
1781180	1784700	of what I liked about pyramid head too, is that if a survivor runs through one of your
1784700	1789660	little traps that you lie down, then, uh, trenches, then they get revealed. Um, it's
1789660	1794380	just that those, those, the survivors can avoid if they kind of know and they crouch
1794380	1798460	through it. The doctor stuff is much harder to avoid. So that's kinda, yeah. So anyway,
1798460	1802420	yeah, dead by daylight playing the killer. They can't just strip the skin off of them
1802420	1807140	like, you know, in silent Hill. No, only in the movie. That was only in the movie.
1807140	1813540	And uh, they, they, they actually have to balance it for the game. So he can't do like
1813540	1817780	everything he does in the game because right. He's, he's in another universe and the whole
1817780	1822060	like story, if you, cause dead by daylight apparently has this very rich story behind
1822060	1828060	it. If you look for it, um, is that you are not usually the one doing the killing. You
1828060	1835120	are sacrificing survivors to the entity and the entity has summoned these killers to do
1835120	1841180	its bidding. That's but once in a while, if you please the entity, then the entity will
1841180	1845300	let you kill people by your own hand. And that's a Maury. So, and pyramid head does
1845300	1850820	actually have his own built in Maury, but he takes the sword and he just slams it down
1850820	1856300	on the body and effectively cuts them in half, which is really gross. Right. But it's not
1856340	1860820	like the way it's depicted in game. It just, it looks like a, like a mortal combat three
1860820	1866500	blood splatter. It isn't like, it isn't delightful. It isn't gross. Like it is in like mortal
1866500	1870900	combat 10 or 11. I hope that pyramid head moves a little bit faster than he does in
1870900	1875420	the game. So, um, he moves at the same speed as the other, you know, again, they had, they
1875420	1880260	have to balance it a little bit, but that's how they get like Michael Myers, leather face,
1880260	1885660	Freddy Krueger, um, the pig from the saw movies. Um, who am I missing? Ghost face. They're
1885660	1891400	all in this game. Play around as Freddy and let me know what it's like. I Freddy's interesting
1891400	1896500	as far, but I don't want to buy them. They all cost money. The only one I bought, I need
1896500	1902300	like five bucks. I'll buy them for you. Oh, that's sweet. Thank you. Okay. Then I'll text
1902300	1906380	you five bucks. You'd probably get a better bang for your buck. If you get, if you had
1906380	1913380	Alan by Freddy, I can't Apple pay Alan. Okay. Five bucks for Freddy. Sweet. Dark soccer
1913380	1920380	just tapped into my dead by daylight edition. I love it. Addiction. I love it. Um, I'm seriously,
1920380	1926500	I'm going to give you five bucks right now. Okay. Yeah. Then I will buy Freddy and I'll,
1926500	1931580	I think he's a very hard killer to play though, but I'll try it. I'll try anything. Whatever.
1931580	1937860	Uh, for five bucks. I'll try it. So yeah, I have been playing more dead by daylight.
1937860	1942340	That's that's fine. I will do a stream at some point. It's just that Alan now wears
1942340	1946460	the streaming pants in this house outside of Sunday night. So there's no room for me
1946460	1952020	anymore. No, he's much more disciplined with it than I am. That's for sure. Um, let's see.
1952020	1957420	Oh, I also want to talk about, cause I've been playing more bravely default to my relationship
1957420	1962700	with this game is so interesting because there are things about this game that annoy the
1962700	1968060	fucking shit out of me. I am like, I don't know if I've ever been more annoyed by a game
1968060	1973260	in recent years than I have been with bravely default too, because I talked about this last
1973260	1979220	week on the show, the, the frame rate and the performance issues, they, they bug me.
1979220	1985820	Um, I'm finding that I am getting bugged now by, if you try to like auto equip characters,
1985820	1991700	the auto equip thing is not very smart because it will start equipping armor to your healers
1991700	1996080	that are good armor, but it will also draw the most amount of hate. So why did they put
1996080	2001120	that into some mechanic that armor draws hate? I don't know, but that's the thing. Uh, speaking
2001120	2005200	of mechanics that annoy the shit out of me, the weight mechanic, they haven't bravely
2005200	2010200	default to fucking annoys me. So there's a, there's a, and I was talking on discord with
2010200	2013100	some of my friends about this the other night. I'm like, this game annoys me so much with
2013100	2021220	all these little things that all being said, I can't stop playing it because at its core,
2021220	2026280	that very final fantasy five esque build up your characters in the different types
2026280	2031820	of jobs and the jobs that are offered in the game and the battle system that's there is
2031820	2037640	actually a very satisfying system. The battle system is, and the whole like defaulting and,
2037640	2042460	and braving to spend extra points and the whole like doing four turns at a time, if
2042460	2048700	you're willing to sit out for three turns and that whole stuff. Um, like that, that
2048700	2052340	is all very interesting to me and that's kind of what's keeping me with the game despite
2052340	2057140	the fact that I'm very annoyed by some of these other things. I'm going to be honest.
2057140	2062920	Um, when I saw that Octopath Traveler is coming to Xbox game pass, I was actually very excited
2062920	2067220	because I was like, I hope that means bravely default will come to those systems too because
2067220	2070660	that means the performance issue thing will no longer be an issue. Maybe we'll get the
2070660	2075020	switch pro too and that'll work out too. Uh, I'll still be annoyed by the weight and the
2075020	2079780	auto equip thing where I have to do everything by hand and when you're switching jobs a lot,
2079780	2086700	that's very annoying, but eh, I guess I'll take it. It's Hey, nothing can be worse than
2086700	2093300	the drawing junctioning system from Final Fantasy eight. So there is that. That's terrible.
2093300	2098260	Exactly. I think it puts a lot of stuff in perspective. It's like, Hey, nothing can ever
2098260	2105780	be that bad. Wow. I just got five bucks on Apple pay. How about that? I put the text
2105780	2115540	message up on the cam. I love it. All right. Anyway, that's enough for my gaming week.
2115540	2120340	I don't think I have a lot of extra to add. All right, let's get into some gaming news
2120340	2124140	actually real quick before we get into gaming news on a serious note because I need to make
2124140	2130340	sure we say this at some point in tonight's show. Um, obviously there's been, uh, there's
2130340	2135640	been a lot of bullshit in the world in the past year and, uh, we, um, have seen a lot
2135640	2139660	of bullshit in this past week. And yes, I'm referring to what happened, um, in Atlanta
2139660	2144000	with those, um, horrific shootings, um, done, you know, the terrorist act that was done
2144000	2148000	in Atlanta. Let's just call it what it is. Let's not call it what that Sheriff had the
2148000	2153760	audacity to call it on, on TV. That was somebody's bad day. It was a terrorist attack. Um, shit
2153760	2160480	is what it was racism. And it was very, it was very hurtful too, that it happened in
2160480	2164840	a place like Atlanta, which I, you know, it's my Atlanta is my home for one week out of
2164840	2169680	the year, um, outside of pandemics, you know, and obviously Bobby and dragon con have had
2169680	2175060	a huge influence in that whole thing. So certainly I, I, I felt a certain kind of connection
2175060	2179720	when I heard about this horrible thing, um, that happened in Atlanta that, um, you know,
2179720	2183960	could have, could have happened anywhere, unfortunately. And that's the disgusting thing.
2183960	2189400	And that's why we all need to, you know, take a promise that we're going to do what we can,
2189400	2196360	um, to stop Asian American and Pacific Islander hate, um, and, uh, stop that culture and stop
2196360	2202640	that racism, um, that's happening in our culture. And you can say that, and also at the same
2202640	2207860	time, still recognize black lives matter and the black lives matter movement and all the
2207860	2213340	bullshit that the black and African American and, and, uh, people of color community that
2213340	2218660	they face all of the time. Um, and I was talking a little bit about this on Twitter this week.
2218660	2222320	And I think a lot of this, and this does tie into video gaming. So if you're about to tune
2222320	2226740	out of the show, cause, Oh God, Rob's on another one of his rants. I really need you to listen
2226740	2231840	to this because when we talk about like stopping the hate and all this and stopping it when
2231840	2237680	it comes to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and stopping it when it comes to other casual
2237680	2244520	racism that happens, I think we all know gaming and that culture is all too often a
2244520	2251560	hotbed for that sort of casual racism, casual misogyny, casual homophobia, and transphobia.
2251560	2257600	If we want to talk about the LGBTQ and so forth community. Um, I'm, I know when I'm
2257600	2261560	talking to the OLR audience, I'm talking to folks that are here, you know, that join us
2261560	2265840	on VOG network every week. I'm, I'm pretty much preaching to the choir. I don't think
2265840	2271080	there's people around here that really actively participate in this, but what can you do if
2271080	2276480	you want to be an ally and you want to be an ally for things like stop AAPI hate and,
2276480	2281360	and BLM, what can you do if you want to be an ally? You've got to, you are in a unique
2281360	2286840	position. I'm in a unique position where we can call this out when we see it. And that's
2286840	2292400	what we have to do because think about it. Have you heard a racist joke in your life?
2292400	2302480	I know I have. Did you, did you maybe let that racist joke go by without doing anything
2302480	2305960	to stop it because you didn't want to create an awkward situation between you and your
2305960	2313040	friend. That is maybe the attitude we as allies have to change because a hashtag is not going
2313040	2319200	to do it. A picture of a square on your Instagram account is not going to do it. Calling that
2319200	2324840	out when it happens, that's going to do it. And that's going to be the shift in our culture.
2324840	2329520	And I can tell you from all of the Black people that I've talked to, all of the Asian American
2329520	2335240	people that I've talked to, they don't want to be doing this educating. They are tired
2335240	2340760	of always having to be the ones to do the educating, you know, and you see this happen
2340760	2345280	on Twitter, right? Somebody Black or somebody Asian American tweets a certain way that they're
2345280	2350320	feeling. And always the first and second reply is something like, well, you should
2350320	2356400	do this or explain to me why, you know, why don't we have white pride? Why don't you tell
2356400	2364520	me why we don't have that? Or, you know, whatever. You have Google use it. Exactly. Like, stop
2364520	2372040	making oppressed people explain it to you. Open your eyes because it's there. And if
2372040	2377200	you want to be a better ally, you've got to be the one. I think I made this comparison
2377200	2382860	on Twitter as I was like, this whole like locker room joke culture and this whole thing.
2382860	2389140	This is oftentimes when those locker room jokes are happening, the oppressed community
2389140	2393760	is not there in the locker room because most people don't have the balls to say that kind
2393760	2398920	of things to someone someone's face. When we had the President of the United States
2398920	2403480	getting up there calling coronavirus some really shitty things. Unfortunately, that
2403480	2408560	was an exception where that guy didn't give a fuck and he would say, you know, whatever,
2408560	2414760	which is a whole other issue. But for the most part, when these other aggressions happen,
2414760	2420520	the oppressed is not in the room. That's why we have to be the ones to speak up and say
2420520	2427480	something. So and I think that we we have this unique position where we know firsthand
2427480	2436720	what it's like to be the one talked about, you know, or deal with with having our own
2436720	2443660	issues have been sources of public mockery, you know, like, do you know how many times
2443660	2450240	I want to scream every time I see someone type autistic screaming? It's and the thing
2450240	2455220	is, is that we don't stop and think about, oh, well, it's not affecting us. We have our
2455220	2460060	own issues to deal with. But the moment that we stop and we call out others, we can also
2460060	2465460	expect to have them called out on our behalf, too. And everyone should be doing it.
2465460	2471880	So next time you're playing a game online with friends, and somebody casually drops
2471880	2476460	the N word, heaven forbid, I mean, I hope that isn't happening with your friends. But
2476460	2480720	I'm also realistic. And I know there is people in the world that feel like they can just
2480720	2486560	say that wherever they want. Or somebody decides to do their own voice of an Asian
2486560	2492040	character in the game that is extremely stereotypical and in poor taste. You have a responsibility
2492040	2496740	as an ally to call that out. Is it going to be awkward with your friend? Yes. But that's
2496740	2500640	the only way this shit is going to change is when we call out this behavior when we
2500640	2506400	see it. And we have to stop the hate. We have to stop the hate with Asian American Pacific
2506400	2511400	Islanders. We have to stop casual racism. We have to stop misogyny. We have to stop
2511400	2518960	homophobia, transphobia, all of it. All of it. All of it. And gaming culture, unfortunately,
2518960	2525300	as we know, is a hotbed for it. So what are you going to do to make it a better place?
2525300	2529720	Because putting a hashtag on social media, that's cute. But that's not going to change
2529720	2537440	anything. Educating somebody on why they should stop doing what they're doing and how
2537440	2544080	that can be hurtful. That's going to be the start of it. Just some food for thought. All
2544080	2550160	right. I got on my soapbox, but it needed to happen. So there you go. All right. Let's
2550160	2554560	move on. Let's get into some gaming news and talk about what else is going on in the gaming
2554560	2558520	world. Besides what we talked about at the beginning of the show with Evo. So Loki, why
2558520	2560640	don't you start us off with our first topic tonight?
2560640	2564960	Yeah. So there was a presentation, which I actually missed because I didn't even know
2564960	2572840	it was happening. But Square Enix did a kind of a Nintendo Direct type event called Square
2572840	2579640	Enix Presents. And they showed off a bunch of different things, new game trailers and
2579640	2584840	different announcements. So for example, one of those being the announcement of the brand
2584840	2591240	new entry into the Life is Strange series, which looked interesting. So that's Life is
2591240	2600160	Strange True Colors. That's going to be coming out later this year on, I think most platforms
2600160	2606480	maybe. Yeah. Looks like on all the other platforms that normally came on. They did show off,
2606480	2612800	which is, I don't even remember the original trailer for this. It was Project Atheia, which
2612800	2617320	is now being called Force Spoken. But it's this brand new exclusive game that's coming
2617320	2624240	out for PlayStation 5 and PC, which looks amazing. So brand new IP for them. So very
2624240	2625320	interested in that.
2625320	2630840	I have to say that is probably the biggest thing I'm excited for on PlayStation 5 right
2630840	2635680	now. I got to say, like even above like the Horizon sequel and some of the other stuff
2635680	2638920	that Sony shown, that is probably the thing I'm most excited about right now. And that
2638920	2642800	trailer was really badass, like how they had the actress kind of introducing it. And
2642800	2650280	then you see her in the game and it's like, it's her. It's her. It's like, no, it's digital
2650280	2654440	her, but it's her, you know? And then of course the whole like, is that a fucking dragon?
2654440	2658680	Like that's the one line of dialogue and the whole thing. But it was a very sharp looking
2658680	2660320	trailer, I got to say.
2660320	2664100	So yeah, so they showed that off. They had a new trailer for Balan Wonderland, which
2664100	2669100	I think is coming out later this month. They announced that Black Panther is going to be
2669100	2677040	coming to Marvel Avengers. They showed off this Hitman Sniper Assassins, which is a mobile
2677040	2685460	game. Also Just Cause mobile, which I'm a huge Just Cause fan, but nope. I think that
2685460	2692120	was, it was certainly more a game trailer than gameplay. They're talking about the 25th
2692160	2698320	anniversary of Tomb Raider. And to celebrate that that's coming to Fortnite. So that's
2698320	2705920	interesting. Outriders, they showed a little bit more for that as well. And then some other
2705920	2712400	smaller things that they mentioned. Space Invaders is getting an AR game. So add that to
2712400	2718580	the list of AR games you got to try. Darius is coming to Switch and PlayStation 4 is an
2718580	2725720	HD remaster called Darius Cosmic Revelation. Bubble Bobble, four friends coming to Steam
2725720	2734260	and the second story pack for Toho Spell Bubble is coming through the Switch as well. Yeah,
2734260	2740120	pretty cool. Again, very interested about the four spoken, although that, God, like
2740120	2744300	I have a feeling that's a 2022 game. Yeah, it is a 2022 game.
2744300	2746300	Yeah, I think they said it is. Yeah.
2746300	2752660	Yeah. Oh, well it gives me time. But that, that one looked really good. And yeah, there
2752660	2757060	was a lot of, it was interesting because we got a lot more updates than I was expecting.
2757060	2761940	I think that, you know, the whole four spoken showing up was certainly unexpected. We went
2761940	2765700	in knowing it was going to be about Life is Strange. And certainly it's, you know, nice
2765700	2770300	that that series is continuing to go on and they're kind of bringing the older ones back
2770300	2774780	for the newer platforms. That's cool remasters for those as well. So that, that'd be interesting.
2774780	2779300	Honestly, that's what I kind of would have expected this event to be and kind of end
2779300	2783160	there, you know? Um, but they, they really went on and detailed more titles than I kind
2783160	2787040	of thought they would. So that was pretty cool. I mean, some people might be going,
2787040	2790980	where was Final Fantasy? But I think you set the bar way too high if you were going into
2790980	2796820	a Life is Strange event expecting Final Fantasy a couple of weeks ago. So like that, why bring
2796820	2802340	Final Fantasy back again? Right. I know, but you know, you know, people are like, where's,
2802340	2807260	chapter 16? Let's show me another screenshot. Give me another hit on what's going on there.
2807260	2812220	So Questbuster in chat is saying I really enjoyed the Outriders demo. Yeah, that has
2812220	2817980	my attention too. I can't believe that's coming to Game Pass. That's so exciting. The Outriders
2817980	2822500	demo was also notoriously farmed for the legendaries it drops because any progress you make in
2822500	2827900	it is carried over to the full game. That again from Questbuster in our chat, who also
2827900	2831980	mentioned that four spoken is by Luminous Productions, which is made up of the staff
2831980	2837380	that created Final Fantasy 15. Well, good. This will probably be a title that really
2837380	2842820	suits that. You know, I didn't love Final Fantasy 15 as a Final Fantasy title, but there
2842820	2847840	was some interesting stuff in there. I think also I didn't like that it was really kind
2847840	2852580	of rushed. Yes, I know that game was in development for 10 years, but let's be real, only the
2852580	2859380	last two years mattered. So there is that, but I'm excited to see what they do with kind
2859380	2863140	of like their own thing. I think that could be very, very interesting. That's for sure.
2863140	2869020	Bobby Black Wolf, I'm assuming a tongue in cheek, firmly planted saying I'm just disappointed
2869020	2875060	that Square Enix didn't show me a new Breath of the Wild 2 trailer. Yes, I know. I'm always
2875060	2879120	disappointed when that doesn't show up in an event too. DJ Roma S saying still waiting
2879120	2885260	on that Rad Racer 3 trailer. Wouldn't that be a hoot? That would be pretty awesome to
2885260	2890060	bring that back. Oh my God. Can you imagine if one day out of the blue Square brought
2890060	2896280	back Rad Racer? Why haven't they? Can we explore that for a minute? Can we look under
2896280	2902060	that rock? Why hasn't Square Enix? I mean, because Square is much more than just Final
2902060	2908900	Fantasy. Square now owns studios that develop things like Tomb Raider, the Avengers game,
2908900	2913140	you know, Forspoke, you know, they have a lot of different studios. Why haven't they
2913140	2917420	tasked one of them with doing a new Rad Racer? Do they think there's too many racing games
2917420	2922540	out there or something? It would be like, honestly, it would fit really well with like
2922540	2928020	an arcade racer, like kind of like a Ridge Racer or something like that. But I don't
2928020	2935540	know if Rad Racer know where it would fit like within the different racing. But honestly,
2935540	2942980	the racing games out there tend to heavily stick to the simulation racing. There's a
2942980	2948200	lot more simulation racing used versus arcade. The only two I can only think of a couple
2948200	2954020	arcade racing titles out there that have been pretty big recently, that hotshots racing
2954020	2961160	and of course, you know, you've got the Forza Horizon series as well. But you know, we haven't
2961160	2966100	had a new Burnout game, I guess Need for Speed also is kind of on the arcade racing side
2966100	2973940	as well. But I don't know, like if Need for Speed is just very...
2973940	2974940	Rad Racer could fight...
2974940	2979820	It's just too complicated. It's like give me a good racing, arcade racing game.
2979820	2983760	All here's the thing, Rad Racer could find a niche in the space because when it comes
2983760	2989700	to racing games, the games that have dared to step up and kind of go try to like break
2989700	2996220	into that space have oftentimes been criminally underrated. Case in point, Blur. That game
2996220	3002840	was fucking rad and it really got, you know, kind of shafted all things considered. The
3002840	3006700	gaming's, you know, history. Like if they had gone so far as to make a Blur sequel,
3006700	3012780	I think it would have been amazing. Case in point, again, split second. When Disney did
3012780	3018020	their whole thing on the Xbox 360, that game was pretty sweet too. Unfortunately, it didn't
3018020	3021780	make enough money and it never continued past that point either.
3021780	3022780	So I mean...
3022780	3027020	That was a pretty fun game though. I don't know why they tried, but didn't they have
3027020	3031900	like, um, God, I can't remember which one, if it was split second or Blur that had, it
3031900	3037900	had, oh, no, it was split second too. That's right. Um, cause that game looked amazing.
3037900	3041180	The screenshots or video of that.
3041180	3046260	Honestly, I really wanted a sequel to that. It's been what, like 10 years since Blur?
3046260	3051120	It's been a long time. I think Rad Racer could fill that space of Mario Kart meets
3051120	3057940	Arcade Racer that I think we want. Do we want that? I want that. So Square, if you're out
3057940	3066820	there, Rad Racer, make it happen. All right. All right. Let's move on. Hey, Rad Racer could
3066820	3072980	be a VR thing. Who knows? You know, the original Rad Racer was 3D with the 3D glasses, right?
3072980	3079500	Does anyone ever play Rad Racer in 3D? I did. It was, it was, um, it's, it's, it's gimmicky.
3079500	3082940	Like all you, it's, it, because the graphics are so basic, especially when you're playing
3082940	3088780	in 3D, like all you're really seeing is added depth. That's all you're really seeing. Um,
3088780	3095420	but it's, you know, obviously like 3DS technology and so forth really puts it to shame. Bobby
3095420	3100580	Black Wolf says, I did try it with my power glove. It's so bad. SHO 100 Matt says, has
3100580	3105600	to come with the red and blue 3D glasses. That was special. Look in the Rad Racer reboot,
3105600	3111260	the main character could sport those red and blue glasses. Look at it here. I'm designing
3111260	3117540	the game, you guys. All right. Anyway, moving on. Let's talk about VR for the PlayStation
3117540	3122440	five, because we have more news about VR coming to the PlayStation five. No, we don't have
3122440	3127120	a date. No, we don't have a price, but we do know what the controllers are going to
3127120	3132820	look like. Uh, there was an update, uh, from Sony's PlayStation blog this week, uh, that
3132820	3137840	shows what the controllers are going to look like for the PlayStation VR for PlayStation
3137840	3144360	five. Gone are the, uh, PlayStation move controllers and the little colored balls on the tips of
3144360	3149600	them. Uh, they are gone and these new controllers really look nothing like them. Um, they look
3149600	3155720	more like, I think there is a VR out there that uses Oculus two Oculus quest two or something.
3155720	3160920	They, they use these controllers and they, they look like, um, imagine like the outline
3160920	3165000	and I'm trying to describe this for the folks listening on the podcast. Imagine like the
3165000	3172120	outline of a boxing glove, kind of like on your hand that, and you grip like half a controller
3172120	3179640	that's on the inside. That's kind of what these look like. Um, so it does kind of, it
3179640	3183880	looks a little bit like a, yeah, I think it is Oculus that, uh, uses that there. Uh, or
3183880	3187860	as some people have noticed, uh, it looks a little bit like the orb that Jodie Foster
3187860	3193480	uses in contact. I would have never found that out, but who knows? Anyway, some of the
3193480	3199440	features, some of the features in here, adaptive triggers. So that means that when you press
3199440	3203400	it, it'll be, you know, adapt. It's kind of like the harder you press it, the harder it
3203400	3207620	goes and so forth. Um, that is very similar to what's already in the dual sense controller.
3207620	3211960	There will be haptic feedback, no real surprise there. Again, another kind of perk of the,
3211960	3217680	uh, existing dual sense controller, finger touch detection. So even if you don't like
3217680	3223540	press in areas where you like, there is a button, it will actually see like gestures
3223540	3228040	that your fingers and stuff are doing. And basically, yeah, it sounds just like a rift
3228040	3235520	controller with the dual sense triggers and the dual sense, uh, hap, it's not really haptic
3235520	3240160	gremble, whatever they've got there. It's basically those two combined together. Basically.
3240160	3245400	Yes. All right. It just says the point cause like I had envisioned when they were talking
3245400	3250400	about haptics and stuff like actual gloves or something like that, but it's fine. I mean
3250400	3254760	those could work for like PC and stuff. Bobby is saying in chat, I'm getting it backwards.
3254760	3258560	So the adaptive triggers, it's actually the other way around. So they don't want you to
3258560	3264580	push the triggers down all the way sometimes. Uh, and so it's more like resistance on the
3264620	3270980	triggers as opposed to, um, what I was saying. So thank you, Bobby. Um, yeah. I mean, if
3270980	3275780	I could actually find a PlayStation five and I've decided I'm not buying a PlayStation
3275780	3279420	five until I can just walk into target and get one. And I realized I might be waiting
3279420	3286140	a while, but I, I'm not having it with 2022 for when this comes out and probably the other,
3286140	3290920	you know, uh, square index game, honestly. Yes, there's time. And so there's that. So
3290920	3296760	yeah, like I, I, I can't explain to you what a PlayStation five is like because they're
3296760	3301840	pretty hard to get and uh, I'm not willing to fight a lot of that. Go onto Walmart and
3301840	3308520	get the 3pm drop that's going to be gone in five seconds. And I'm just, I'm, I don't know
3308520	3312560	if it's this my age, I'm just not willing to subject myself to that stress. And I've,
3312560	3316860	I've said this with other products before, when I can walk into the store, pick one up
3316860	3322000	off the shelf, then it will be meant to be, but I'm not, I'm too old and too tired to
3322000	3328300	fight for a gaming console. I just am. So I'll get one when I can walk into a fries
3328300	3337080	and pick it up. You might have to time travel. You might have to check the dumpster out back.
3337080	3341820	I'm sure that'll be a thing. Yes, I can. I can do that. Uh, Bobby black woven chat says,
3341820	3347020	well episode Eufy is PlayStation five only in June. Then you know what? She's going to
3347020	3353820	have to wait. She's going to have to wait. Sorry. All right. Uh, also very important.
3353820	3359280	One other feature of the new VR, the tracking, the VR controller is tracked by, uh, by the
3359280	3364100	headset through a tracking ring across the bottom of the controller. So that's also very
3364100	3368500	interesting because that means it's not going to be the whole like camera looking at you
3368500	3373540	type of thing. It's actually in the VR headsets. That's kind of neat. I like that. So, uh,
3373540	3379260	cool. Of course, again, we don't know when we don't know how much we don't know what
3379260	3383360	the headset looks like. We're just getting, we don't know games. It's all we know. Sony
3383360	3389900	is working on it. Just, just announced a brand new, uh, until Dawn, uh, Russia blood game.
3389900	3393540	And I'm there just, that's all you need to do is say, Hey, we're putting them one of
3393540	3398820	those out and like, Oh, all right. I'm sure, I'm sure there'll be some good games for it.
3398820	3403180	I'm uh, I'm excited. I'm still thinking back to last week when we had that whole fan wank
3403180	3407380	about Sony buying Konami so that they can start putting Bemani games out again. And
3407380	3412000	now we had that story last week about the first Bemani VR game. Hey, there's a game
3412000	3417060	for PlayStation five. All right. I'm stretching a little bit, but, um, yeah, it'll be a little
3417060	3422600	bit, a lot. Okay. A lot of it. Um, but I'm sure that, you know, again, it's about getting
3422600	3428240	that must have app. So whether that is the Russia blood until Dawn for PlayStation five,
3428240	3432280	or maybe a new type of Beat Saber or one of those types of games or something we haven't
3432280	3436080	thought of yet, most likely. Um, I think that is really going to be the thing that pushes
3436080	3442840	VR forward, but PlayStation certainly did a great job of making quality VR accessible.
3442840	3448360	I'm using that word quality and some folks may feel differently about this, but I think
3448360	3453040	those like, um, that thing that you plop your cell phone into and it does VR through
3453040	3460760	that. I think PlayStation brought quality VR and VR experiences and made them very accessible.
3460760	3468880	So there's that. All right, let's move on dark Sakura. So, um, one thing I've been keeping
3468880	3473680	my eyes on is the stuff for the new resident evil stuff. And it could, there is a lot of
3473680	3479560	stuff. Oh yeah. So basically, um, the new movie has a title. Now it's resident evil,
3479560	3484200	welcome to raccoon city, and it's going to follow the first two games. So we'll have
3484200	3492800	Chris, Joe, Leon and Claire. Um, they've already done quite a bit of casting for it. Um, and
3492800	3499800	then, uh, there's going to definitely be some very interesting things as though that the,
3500400	3505400	the, the film franchise and this movie series have nothing to do with each other. They're
3505400	3512600	completely separate. It's not a remake. It's going to be a little bit more with the base
3512600	3519520	universe. Um, so there you go. Um, I'm actually kind of relieved for that because the one
3519520	3522920	thing I didn't really care for in the movie universes is that they didn't quite follow
3522920	3529560	the game universe. And I would rather dig more into the game universe. So I think that's
3529560	3538240	going to be, be awesome. So they got a good cast so far. Yeah. Um, and that's, uh, that
3538240	3543320	whole, uh, revival of stuff on Netflix. It's just like Netflix trying to become the video
3543320	3549280	game home of all this stuff. So yeah, it's going to be, yeah, they sure do. Uh, looking
3549280	3553660	in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, dark Tetsuya says, as long as it's better
3553660	3557600	than the original movie released, it's interesting though. Cause the original resident evil movie
3557600	3562560	certainly has its fans. Um, and it, yeah, I would say the original is probably better
3562560	3567640	than any of the sequels. Any of the many, how many seals they made me like 20 sequels
3567640	3571480	or something like that. I don't know. I think finally knew what I liked is I liked some
3571480	3576760	of the CG ones that they came out with. So like the, um, degeneration and the only reason
3576760	3582960	I bought degeneration is because it had, uh, a song on there. Gosh, why can't I remember
3582960	3588280	her name now? Cause I really like her and it's Chia. Um, she did like the closing song
3588280	3592440	on it and that's why I bought the movie, but the movie was actually really good. Yeah.
3592440	3596960	Um, and, uh, as she 100, Matt says, I haven't seen the cast yet. Are there any like highly
3596960	3603320	recognizable folks in the cast or is it a lot of, um, Robbie ML? Um, I'm trying to think
3603320	3610680	of other ones I've seen. Um, not too many people I know of. I mean, it's just, I've,
3610680	3617240	you know, I checked some of these people on IMDB, um, and they looked like they had,
3617240	3621160	you know, done some good work, but the only name I really recognized was Robbie ML who's
3621160	3626760	playing Chris. Uh, fifth dream is giving a shout out to Anna. Sushiya is amazing. So
3626760	3632960	yeah. Oh, sorry. Yeah. She's, there's a movie that she did. It's one of my favorite movies
3632960	3643840	ever called, um, uh, uh, where, um, she becomes a, uh, a courtesan, uh, an Iran or she's trying
3643840	3649880	to become the later on. It's really, really good movie. She's got a great voice. All right.
3649880	3655120	So, uh, we'll, we'll see that soon whenever this movie finally comes out. All right, let's
3655120	3661360	move on to our next story. Loki. It's like, we've heard this story before. So Activision
3661440	3668080	is laying off some employees. So, uh, they're going to be laying off the Blizzard esports,
3668080	3674000	uh, which is going to be about 50 employees. Actually, it says the total figure is around
3674000	3682000	190 instead. Um, this is also coming after that they've just, uh, closed the European
3682000	3689360	publishing offices as well, uh, which laid off, you know, quite a few people, um, on top of that.
3689920	3696720	Um, and of course, you know, much like we saw last time, uh, during our investor call,
3696720	3703680	I think it was about a year or so ago from November, um, Bobby Kotick, Activision Blizzard
3703680	3710160	CEO is going to get even bigger bonuses because of that. Um, he's supposed to get more than,
3710160	3717440	I guess, a total payout, nearly $200 million. It's fucking terrible. So, you know, $200 million,
3717520	3722640	which I'm sure probably could have paid for a lot of those employees to work there. Um,
3723920	3728240	but you know, he needs more money even though he's a multi-billionaire.
3728240	3735360	It's that is a problem with this. Yeah. It's, um, it's extraordinarily frustrating to, you know,
3735360	3741520	to hear of that bonus that he's making, um, and how, I guess a lot of this staff was, uh, as I,
3741520	3746400	as I understand it in the, in the live events creation stuff. Am I right? Are we talking
3746400	3751200	about things like BlizzCon and things like that? Yeah. And that's, I don't quite understand. It
3751200	3756880	seems very shortsighted to me because even though that space is, you know, having a hard time right
3756880	3761760	now in the past year with everything going on, um, everybody really desires it to come back.
3761760	3766720	And once the convention space to come back and we see other companies that are certainly valuing
3766720	3771600	that convention space, like Sony, um, is certainly trying to get back into that space too. So to see
3771600	3778960	Activision kind of let that go is shocking or I should say, cut it back. I shouldn't say,
3778960	3783680	let it go. Cause I don't see that like, there's not going to be a BlizzCon again, hardly,
3783680	3788240	but it's just, I would have thought Blizzard would instead try to grow that, or sorry, I keep saying
3788240	3793680	Blizzard by me, Activision, Activision would try to grow that space and not try to, um, scale that
3793680	3798880	back. So that's just, it's shocking to me. I do have that with like everything they'll just leave
3798880	3805440	people off and then hire back later. Um, but I mean, a lot of these developers, like, especially
3805440	3811040	like we had, I think the last set of layoffs was around, you know, like teams working on like the
3811040	3814960	latest Call of Duty and stuff like that. They just lay people off and like, they'll hire back
3815520	3820480	people or hire different people back for less money or something. Um, but yeah, it does suck
3820480	3826640	that, you know, they're laying off all these people. Um, and their CEO who I don't know how
3826640	3831680	he contributes to the company is continuing to make millions and millions of dollars.
3832400	3837600	The system is built to help the rich. Uh, reading some comments in chat,
3837600	3844080	Black Compat says money gonna money, heavy sigh. Yeah. Heavy, heavy sigh. Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says
3844080	3849040	he's not welcome in the club of Bobby. Um, Tiger Claw says, here's the thing. We heard these kinds
3849040	3853760	of stories before CEO's getting bonuses while employees were being laid off. Look. And here's
3853760	3860880	the other thing is that like, if, okay, if truly because of the pandemic, there's just no work
3860880	3867200	right now in the live event space, and this is a decision that has to be made then, okay, but,
3867760	3876560	but underlined bolded, but give them the severance that they deserve. Help them get certifications
3876560	3882560	so that they can stay current, help them in job seeking and finding other stuff in the industry.
3882560	3887040	Because the part of this story that's most insulting is what SJ 100 Matt just reminded
3887040	3893440	me of there in chat. To me that $200 battle net gift card was a massive slap in the face.
3893440	3902720	Um, yeah, that is the part where Bobby Kotak like needs to fucking go. Even if he didn't make that
3902720	3907920	call himself, which I doubt he did. At the end of the day, he's still ultimately responsible for it
3907920	3911760	to give these employees that had given so much of their time and effort into this. And again,
3911760	3917920	I want to stress this enough, because I know people that work at Blizzard. I believe I know
3917920	3923440	people that work to Activision as well or worked at least I know as well and the staff and the
3923440	3929040	people working in the front lines are all wonderful, fam fabulous people that work very hard and love
3929040	3934320	video games. The grievances I am airing have nothing to do with them. And I certainly would
3934320	3939040	never attack them on social media. And if I see you attacking them, I'm going to come at you with
3939120	3944640	my claws out because these people don't deserve it. Who deserves it? The senior management and
3944640	3953040	Bobby Kotak. That my grievances are for that right now. And that $200 battle net gift card
3953040	3958960	or whatever the hell it was terrible. That's that is the thing where I'm like that. Like if
3958960	3965280	we are to put down the list of reasons why Bobby Kotak needs to be ceremoniously thrown out of
3965280	3968880	office or whatever you want his office, whatever you want to call it. And I mean,
3969600	3975840	I want people to walk in there, grab him by the shoulders like you see in an old movie and throw
3975840	3980480	him out the front door. I don't care if he lands on pillows to be humane, whatever. There's a
3980480	3989360	better word. What? Finestrated. I'm trying to do a show. That is when people are thrown out of the
3989360	3998560	window. Yes, that. Okay. And it was a big thing too like going on in Europe. A big accident. We
3998560	4002880	need to bring back fenestration. So, here's it. So, I do not violate tWitch's terms of service
4002880	4008000	right there. He can land on a nice soft one of those fluffy mats that gymnasts use, okay?
4008960	4015840	But I still want the ceremonious throwing to happen. And that is the reason the $200
4015840	4022240	gift cards. You know what? If you really felt bad, how about six months of insurance covered?
4022240	4027120	How about certifications to keep them current in their industry while they job hunt? How about
4027120	4030800	signing them up for, you know, headhunter services and things like that to help them find them?
4030800	4035040	Three months severance. So, three months severance and the gift card.
4035040	4041040	The word is defenestration. Sorry. Oh, okay. Anyway. Yeah. And Questbuster,
4041040	4045920	great point. Questbuster in chat says, meanwhile, years ago, Iwata and Nintendo's board of
4045920	4052080	directors took a massive pay cut over poor financial results. And that is why we miss
4052080	4060080	Iwata in this industry every single day. It also though has to do a little bit more,
4060080	4065360	I think, with the nature of work ethic in groups in America versus Japan.
4065360	4073920	Mm-hmm. That a manager is gonna say the failing of the company is the failing of the manager,
4073920	4080480	and the employees should be protected. Whereas- And in America, the CEOs are like,
4080480	4085920	I can't hear you. I'm in the money pit. Yeah. Anyway.
4085920	4090000	The employees are nothing but a stepping stone for more money in their pocket.
4090000	4094640	That's the danger of capitalism. All right. Let's move on. Let's move
4094640	4102000	on to another story. Let's talk about Microsoft. As far as the Xbox gaming division goes and that
4102000	4106640	whole stuff, has a pretty decent guy at the helm right now, I'd say. So, Phil Spencer hasn't pissed
4106640	4112800	me off this week. He's usually one of the more impressive folks in the industry. So, a pat on
4112800	4117920	the back and a cookie for Phil Spencer. Literal pillows for Phil Spencer. A nice new pillow for
4117920	4124000	his couch. Okay? Phil Spencer can have that. Microsoft, Xbox getting a new feature this
4124000	4130480	week, a suspend feature to help with the download speeds. Because download speeds on console aren't
4130480	4137120	always great, but what this new feature will do is that you can suspend a game while you're trying
4137120	4143920	to download a new one to help the system download faster. So, suspend in the queue will let you
4143920	4149600	download at full speed while making sure your game remains resumable or quick resumable even
4149600	4155680	if you're on the series X or S. And this was all on a Twitter post by engineering lead Eden Marie
4156320	4161280	over at Xbox. And there's a screenshot of that new suspend functionality if you want to look at that
4161280	4168640	over on Twitter on her account, Neon Epiphany. And then right now, downloads I guess are pretty slow
4169200	4173760	when the games are open because some of the connection capacity has to be for the game,
4173760	4177680	which kind of makes sense. Like I get that because a lot of games have some type of like
4177680	4181920	online talking functionality there. So, you can't dedicate it to downloading the game.
4181920	4186240	But if you suspend it, then you're basically saying, okay, pause this game, put it on hold
4186240	4191600	and give more of the priority over to downloading the game there. So, I think that's kind of neat,
4191600	4197520	especially since Xbox Game Pass oftentimes is like the hometown buffet of gaming.
4197520	4202000	And it's like, I'm going to load me up a little bit with that. Oh, Doom 64. Yeah, put some of
4202000	4206640	that on my plate. Oh, oh, we got Outriders coming. Yep. Save room for that at the end.
4207200	4212000	And now people are downloading games to sample them and everything. I think this is a very
4212000	4216880	welcome sort of thing. If you have the bandwidth for it is a very welcome sort of thing. And I know
4216880	4221520	I keep saying that if you have the bandwidth for it, but I'm really trying to look forward
4222480	4230080	three or four years when 5G becomes more and more of a thing. I can't wait for the day.
4230080	4236160	I can bypass my cable connection and hook up my Xbox to 5G and download things that way. Now,
4236160	4241120	of course, 5G might have data limitations, but at least it's going to introduce competition into
4241120	4245440	that space where these whole bandwidth caps and this whole thing is going to get needled a little
4245440	4251200	bit. Let's hope. Let's hope the industry doesn't try to kind of artificially cap that, but we'll
4251200	4258960	see. All right, let's move on and let's get to Dark Sakura. Oh, some exciting news in your world
4258960	4266720	for sure, right? Yeah. How about something happy? Yes, please. So, there was a new update to Animal
4266720	4272160	Crossing that came out on the 18th and you know, I was on that shit the moment it happened. So,
4273200	4279600	basically the March 18th update came with lots of new stuff. Can I just say you're tweeting,
4279600	4284560	you're tweeting the equivalent of are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
4284560	4294800	Pretty much. Pretty much. Sorry. But the cool thing is that number one is that if you have
4294800	4307360	the Sanrio cards that were part of Animal Crossing, what was it for New Leaf?
4307360	4315440	Welcome amiibo. There were some Sanrio cards that came out with six characters.
4316720	4323200	And if you have those cards, you can actually now invite them into your village and just for
4323200	4330400	scanning them, it unlocks permanent items that you can buy, including furniture sets and clothes
4330400	4335600	and all kinds of stuff. And for people who've played Pocket Camp, they probably are going
4335600	4341040	to look familiar because the characters are available in Pocket Camp. On top of that,
4342560	4350000	you can invite those animals to your village. So, you have Rila, who's the Hello Kitty one.
4350000	4357920	You have Etoile, who is a little twin stars sheep who is definitely on her way to my village. I
4357920	4366880	kicked out Shevra, finally. You have, now I forgot everybody's name, but you have a
4366880	4375040	Kero Kero Kero Pi character. You have a Pompompurin. You have My Melody, Little Twin Stars, Hello Kitty
4375760	4387200	and Cinema Roll as the other character. And now before all you could get though was their posters,
4387200	4392560	which all of my friends should have their posters by now because I have scanned them in.
4394480	4399600	But the other things that you will get from this is that you are going to get a cake for
4399600	4405760	the anniversary. And the cake is actually really cute. And I honestly think it could be remade in
4405760	4411440	person. And not a lie. Yeah, not a lie. It looks like it's like some sort of strawberry shortcake
4411440	4417040	that's done like the land in Animal Crossing with a big red one on it. Like a Christmas cake?
4418160	4422160	No. Well, kind of like a Christmas cake. Some Christmas cakes are traditionally that circular
4422160	4426800	with all the strawberries on top. This is more like a square. Okay. I gotcha. I gotcha. Okay.
4427360	4436000	Yeah. But then again, the really other big things that you're going to get are the Custom Design Pro
4436080	4445120	Plus Editor. That is pretty cool. What you're going to get with that is that it will let you
4445760	4451680	bring in new designing features. So you're going to get access to 50 more design storage slots,
4451680	4456240	which is great because I completely ran out. And that's not just for normal, but that's for
4456240	4461680	both normal and pro. And it also gives you different things you can design like umbrellas.
4462480	4467680	Um, I saw the cutest design where someone took advantage of the shape of the umbrella to make
4467680	4473040	it look like a cat house. And those designs, by the way, are no fucking joke for the serious
4473040	4477440	Animal Crossing players, because that's how you get the things that look totally different than
4477440	4483040	what they're supposed to be. So to give a user 50 more of those is like that is the most exciting
4483040	4488480	thing about this whole patch for many people. But before I unlocked paths, I had my own custom
4488480	4495680	paths on the ground. The other things you can do, you can also purchase a custom design portal,
4498080	4506800	which basically will let you upload things directly from your in-game phone. You also
4507600	4511840	are going to get April Fool's Day whoopee cushions and prom decorations
4513040	4518160	available from the 1st to the 30th. The Mario stuff is still up, by the way. I think that's
4518160	4527200	permanent. Or until the 31st because, you know, Nintendo be Nintendo. At any rate, well, I have
4527200	4534560	all of them and I can forever now. So the thing about those, going back to the Sanrio cards,
4534560	4540720	is that they're only going to be available at Target starting on March 26th. For the,
4541440	4547840	you know, for the American ones, I have special acquisitions of them.
4549680	4556560	But, you know, the outfits are not ugly. They're actually kind of cute, you know. I had one of my
4556560	4560080	characters running around in the pom-pom portal and one which gives you like a blonde pig-tailed
4560080	4566800	wig with a beret on it. It's really cute. And I've already got a room done up in Keto-Keto-Ketopi.
4567200	4571280	We need Batsmaru in this, but I don't see that happening anytime soon.
4572000	4576480	I know. That's what's missing for me, but it still looks really cool.
4576480	4581280	Yeah. You know what Sanrio character I miss that I don't think is around anymore?
4582400	4586560	Robo-One. Oh, yeah. I don't think I've seen that one in a long time.
4586560	4594800	Yeah. I still have, and I'll put it on cam, I have a Robo-One paper binder and I still
4594800	4598800	use it for all my old artwork. I found my Batsmaru lunchbox the other day.
4600320	4606960	Well, you remember when I moved out here and I had this keychain on forever, but I have a
4606960	4610640	25-year-old Batsmaru keychain. That's awesome.
4611280	4615920	And my Bento box. But yeah.
4615920	4619280	All right. Well, lots to- We love Sanrio.
4619280	4623600	Lots to love in Animal Crossing one year later. It's nice to see the updates are still happening
4623600	4628320	and I imagine it's still going to keep going for a while, even though we've hit a full year
4628320	4632480	of Animal Crossing now, so they have done their events for the calendar year and everything.
4632480	4635680	I would imagine they're still going to grow the game in the coming months and continue
4635680	4638800	to add value to that. I'll tell you what, the warp
4638800	4641440	pipes are a fucking game changer. Oh, I bet.
4642240	4647760	Because I have one at my house, there's one at Dan's house, and there's one in front of the
4647760	4654960	alt house. And so I can just portal my way, you know, we're pretty much on any side of the island
4654960	4657600	I need to go because I'm lazy as fuck. So you can only have two.
4658480	4664480	No, you can have three and more, I think. But the other fun thing is that for a while,
4664480	4671040	Dan had a pipe in his house and I would find myself in Dan's house just randomly.
4671040	4673840	Like, I don't want to work my way to their house.
4673840	4675280	To their houses. That's funny.
4675280	4678320	That's kind of cool. So you know, if you were like
4678320	4682080	the ultimate and lazy or you wanted to avoid people, you put a pipe in front of like
4682800	4687200	nooks and then you put a pipe in your living room and then you just go to the store.
4688160	4694080	I could put a warp pipe in front of, you know, nooks that says fun, like a little sign pointing
4694080	4698400	at it says fun, and then they go down the warp pipe and then they end up in my basement that
4698400	4702320	looks like the murder dungeon. I could do that. Yes, you could do that.
4702320	4705600	Fun. That might be I might have to go back to Animal Crossing.
4706400	4712560	I have a little like Mario area set up with coins and the mushroom platforms and everything.
4712560	4718160	So it's really cute stuff. I also have way more lilies of the valley than I know what to do with.
4720160	4722560	I mean, I wish I was joking. I am not.
4723760	4728880	S2100 Matt in chat says Rob just made this dark. Can't help it. It's a gift.
4728880	4737440	Bobby says five nights at Rob's. If you don't want a permanent like murder basement at your
4737440	4743840	house, you can always decorate what's his face is Harv's basement to be a murder basement.
4743840	4748480	Oh, good thinking. But then you can create your own murder scenes,
4748480	4753280	but you can't put the warp pipe to Harv's basement. You can't. No,
4753280	4757360	but it's only a plane right away. Remember, what would Dodo's do?
4757360	4759760	That's true. All right. That's true. And it probably
4759760	4764960	putting the body as a plane right away is probably a better idea. All right. Moving on.
4764960	4768480	And then you get to see all the ridiculous stuff. What's his what's his face says.
4769360	4773760	All right. Let's go to this story is very interesting that Jason referenced
4773760	4776240	in the intro tonight there. Loki, tell us about this.
4777440	4781760	Yeah. So one thing Grand Theft Auto five and Grand Theft Auto online is known for is
4781760	4789840	extremely long load times. So thankfully, you know, one player who was quite a fan of the game
4790480	4797840	managed to modify it in a way that reduced load times by 70 percent. And so he had put out
4799280	4806400	a kind of a workaround to do that and then let Rockstar know that you found this way to do it.
4806400	4812400	And they actually went ahead and made it official and actually released it as a patch for the game.
4813600	4819280	So that is actually out now. You can check it out. But on top of that, not only did they
4820000	4826000	put it as an official update, but they also gave him a bug bounty reward of ten thousand dollars,
4826000	4832080	which normally they would only pay out for, say, finding security flaws or stuff like that.
4832080	4836560	But being that this improved load times by such a significant amount, I mean,
4836560	4841920	they thought that they'd make an exception to the rule and go ahead and give tossed or toast
4842480	4849280	his money, which is pretty awesome. But that's cool. Yeah. That is very interesting. I have to
4849280	4853840	go check it out because, I mean, the load times, it's been a while since I played Grand Theft Auto
4853840	4858400	five, but load times are like in the minutes. It's it's a very long load time.
4859360	4865120	I'm just kind of shocked that this was found by somebody outside of Take-Two.
4865120	4869360	You know, that's the surprising thing about it. Yeah, without the source code and stuff. So
4871440	4879520	basically just released a fix that you could check it out. But, you know, after they did some more
4879520	4884960	analysis and stuff, you know, they were able to implement it. So it was pretty awesome.
4884960	4892080	This is why we need the modding community. Exactly. Well, I mean, modding community has
4892080	4897920	been fixing games for a long time. I mean, look at anything Bethesda makes. Certainly not the first
4897920	4903040	time that they fixed something like this, but it is nice to see some of these become official
4903040	4909680	releases. I want to say, like, we've had other games do this before. I don't know if it was like
4910080	4914320	Cyberpunk or something like that, but like they had a few games where they've actually, you know,
4914320	4921440	put out, you know, fan made mods or whatever, or incorporate that stuff into a game to be able to
4921440	4926480	make it, you know, actually run better. So that's pretty nice. As Joe and Hunter Matt says, this
4926480	4933600	saved the months of development time, I'm sure. Oh, I'm sure. For sure. Yeah. All right. All right.
4934080	4940480	All right. Well, let's move on and talk about a pretty cool discovery in this past week of some
4940480	4946000	prototypes and some demos for the PlayStation 2. It's very interesting when these kind of like
4946000	4952240	old gaming things kind of come up again. That website is the cutting room floor,
4952240	4955120	something like that, that shows all the stuff that was removed from games.
4955840	4961760	That site is really awesome. Anyway, another type of game preservation group called the
4961760	4968800	Hidden Palace over hidden palace.org has released 700 PlayStation 2 early builds,
4968800	4975920	prototypes, E3 and press release demos. They did a whole Twitch stream over six hours where they
4975920	4981040	show different PS2 pre-release builds for things like Crash Bandicoot, The Wrath of Cortex,
4981040	4987360	Final Fantasy X-2, Lego Star Wars, the video game and Crazy Taxi. Some of those builds were
4987360	4991840	only at places like E3 or they were built specifically for the preview end of things.
4992400	4999520	Some were debug builds, some were betas, but they were all found and they worked with this online
4999520	5009200	group to restore them, I guess. Over 850 gigabytes of stuff. So that's pretty cool. And I guess
5009200	5013760	the other part of this is that they're not done. Apparently there are more prototypes that they're
5013760	5019600	going to dig through and release. And certainly this gets into a whole bunch of like, well,
5019600	5024240	what is ethical? What is not? But when you consider these are all the way back in the
5024240	5031440	PlayStation 2 era, these are games that are not being sold as new anymore. I think it's a fine
5031440	5037520	thing. Especially because these were things that were, a lot of them were out there in the public
5037520	5042640	eye at things like E3 and stuff like that. People just want to preserve gaming history and this is
5042640	5048160	all a part of that and gave us the console and the games that we remember. So I think that's
5048160	5052880	pretty neat. Dartitsuya says, I saw a bit of that stream yesterday and then says the website I'm
5052880	5058640	trying to think of Cutting Room Floor, TCRF.net. And then Hidden Palace is the group that did this.
5058640	5064880	They were showing a Simpsons skateboarding game. Yeah, pretty cool. So I like when we get the whole
5066240	5070800	stuff from the past and the, ooh, we almost had this instead of this and the differences.
5070800	5074720	There's also Twitter called, I think like Forest of Illusion or Land of Illusion,
5074720	5077680	something like that. Oh yeah. I think I've heard of that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And they link back to
5077680	5084800	some of this too. Nice. All right. Well, what a nice segue into our segment called the Classic
5084800	5089440	Game of the Week where Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that
5089440	5095600	she thinks, Hey, you should check this game out. This wasn't a cut game. This was actually released
5095600	5099280	and actually the game she picked tonight, A, I can't believe she didn't pick before because this
5099280	5103120	is a game that I would have picked as Classic Game of the Week because I played a lot of this,
5103120	5109760	believe it or not. I love this game. Um, but, uh, I love the logo for this game. I love a lot about
5109760	5114160	this game. I love the music in this game. I love the characters, but anyway, uh, and I think it's
5114160	5122720	a great, uh, it's also great show off of the system that it's on. Anyway, uh, Dark Sakura,
5122720	5127600	Classic Game of the Week. What are we talking about? So the Classic Game of the Week is UN
5127600	5132640	Squadron, which in Japan was called Area 88. And we are looking at the Japanese version of the game
5132640	5138800	tonight. Yeah. Um, just, you know, I, I, the big, it was just happened to be like the, the better
5138800	5145360	quality one that I found, but I freaking love the, the logo for the unicorn with the main on fire.
5145360	5153200	I mean, I would have a tattoo of that if I could, you know, um, if it wasn't like so like niche
5153200	5159440	there, but to go into a little bit of detail, Area 88 was a manga. Um, and the characters in
5159440	5165840	the game are from the manga. There was also, uh, uh, an anime that actually had some really
5165840	5175040	good music in it. Um, I just, I actually watched the OAV last night. Um, but at any rate, um, they,
5175680	5182720	the, their goal is to stop a terrorist group that's called Project 4. So, um, this game, uh,
5182720	5191520	came out, uh, in the arcade. Um, it was, uh, public, it was done by Capcom. It came out,
5191520	5196720	actually, there were, there were various different releases of it. So the, um, the arcade release was
5196720	5205520	on, uh, in August, 1989. And then on the Super Nintendo, July 26th, uh, 1991 in Japan, September
5205520	5213200	91 in North America and December 92 in, uh, Europe. So it is a side scrolling shooter,
5213200	5220160	which was actually against kind of Capcom's established style because they, you know,
5220160	5226720	1942, 1943, the battle of Midway, they were, um, were vertical, uh, scrolling shooters. This was
5226720	5231520	a side scrolling shooter, but very similar to a lot of their other ones. Um, you start,
5231520	5237120	you have an energy bar that's consumed over the course of your single life when you sustain damage.
5237920	5244240	Um, now one of the things that, um, that it has is, um,
5244240	5250640	um, that, you know, a lot of the games are like, when you get hit, you, you know,
5250640	5258320	your ship blows up and a new ship blows in until you're out of lives. So before you enter a level,
5258320	5264320	you can also purchase special weapons, um, or defense in the shop. It was just funny, the shop,
5264320	5270640	you know, everybody in this game is from the manga or anime. Um, but you earn money to buy
5270640	5274640	your weapons by destroying enemy planes and vehicles during the level. And then when you're
5274640	5281680	finished, any unused weapons are converted back into money. So you can play as one of
5281680	5288400	three main characters. You have Shin Kazama, you have Mickey Simon and you have Greg Gates.
5288400	5294560	And each pilot has their own plane and their own specialty in the supernest version,
5294640	5300560	you can get a different range of planes. So you start off with 300, uh, with the,
5300560	5305920	sorry, $3,000 and the F8 Crusader, and you can buy other aircraft and weapon as you progress.
5307040	5313200	Um, and one of the things that was mentioned in the development of this game is that this is one
5313200	5320400	of the games that was a part of Capcom strategy to appeal to a wider audience by using characters
5320400	5325760	that were established in other media because they thought their own characters were too niche.
5326400	5334400	So, um, other games that were in this category was Willow, which I talked about in another session
5334400	5341920	and Destiny of an Emperor. Um, the area area 88 was, uh, ported to, um, super Nintendo,
5342160	5350560	super Famicom. Um, and then of course, retitled as UN squadron, um, in, uh, US and Europe. Um,
5350560	5357760	and the poster that was created for it, for the Western audiences was actually done by
5357760	5362960	an illustrator named Mark Erickson, who was also the illustrator of the Mega Man 2 and
5362960	5371360	Strider covers. Um, there was a version that was also for the Capcom power system changer.
5371360	5380480	It was planned, but it was never released. Um, in Japan, uh, Game Machine was, uh, the, uh,
5380480	5389520	sixth most successful, uh, arcade unit of 1989. Um, Famitsu gave it a 28 out of 40 for the
5389520	5397040	super Nintendo. IGN ranked, uh, the game as 37th on the top 100 super Nintendo games list,
5397040	5401840	which was the highest ranking side scrolling shooter on the list. And EGM gave this NES
5401840	5410800	version an A and picked it as the 12th greatest game available in 1991. So, I mean, this game,
5410800	5416480	it gets nuts as you go through it too. I mean, it's not, I would say one of the super easiest
5416480	5421840	games and I've seen people beat this on the hardest mode. So kudos to them. And then of
5421840	5428480	course there was, um, while there wasn't a true sequel, there was a spiritual successor called
5428480	5435120	Carrier Air Wing. And I may go over this game a little bit later. It came out in 1990 and it
5435120	5442560	was also, um, it was a CP, uh, system arcade, uh, machine that only had an arcade release.
5443280	5451200	But, um, but the thing that's notable more about Area 88 is because it's port to super Nintendo
5452560	5458960	really, I think boosted the knowledge of this game outside of Japan and really boosted its
5458960	5464320	popularity in general. It made it accessible to audiences that might not have seen it otherwise.
5465040	5474880	So, um, that is the classic game. It is UN squadron or, uh, area 88, which, um, has a cool
5474880	5481040	logo because it's a unicorn on fire. Great pick. Um, like I said, you know, before we went into the
5481040	5484720	game tonight, um, this is a game I remember playing a lot on the super Nintendo. I didn't
5484720	5490160	own it. I think I rented it at least three or four times. So, uh, cause I really enjoy this game. Um,
5490160	5495920	but, um, interesting about the review scores when you were going over that, how Famitsu, I mean,
5495920	5500960	I realized the Famitsu criteria, especially in the older days was really tough. Like, you know,
5500960	5506960	very few games used to get forties, fairly decent score for me too. I guess, but it just seems so
5506960	5512240	different than what the rest of the world. Then you talk about these U S based, uh, publications
5512240	5516320	are giving it much higher scores and putting it in their top games of the year. It just seems like
5516320	5521520	such a, like maybe this game wasn't as well, and correct me if I'm wrong, maybe this game just
5521520	5527280	wasn't as well received into culture in Japan, the way it was here, even though it was based off
5527280	5533760	a Japanese manga. It's really not a bad score for Famitsu. Yeah. For that era of Famitsu. It's really,
5533760	5540000	they are so stingy with good scores. I guess that's true. Yeah. Um, and you know,
5540000	5549120	keep in mind too, that, you know, this is a timeframe in Japan where, you know, we have so
5549120	5555280	many other, you know, a lot of the great shooters were actually on the mega drive and a PC engine.
5555840	5567920	Mm. So I mean, there was definitely better out, but you know, this game by no extension was a bad
5567920	5574160	game. A 28, you know, keep in mind, this is 28 out of 40. So it's almost 30. I thought you said
5574160	5579840	20. Oh, no, I said 28. Oh, okay. Well, 28 is a little better. Yeah. Oh God. I thought you
5579840	5584960	said 20 and I was like, that's not a great score. All right. 28 would just be like average. Okay.
5584960	5590160	28. Yeah. Okay. Okay. That's a little, that's a little more reasonable. Okay. Cool. Yeah. All
5590160	5595040	right. There it is. Your classic game of the week. UN squadron area, area 88, depending on where you
5595040	5602560	live. I think area 88 was a better name. Yeah. Well, I knew, I knew it was better. Yeah, true.
5602560	5606640	There is that. I mean, not just, well, I mean, the unicorn was in both of them, but I think that the
5606640	5615120	text, even like if you find the, the anime, the US releases, even the logo for area 88 in English
5615120	5620400	looked better than the one for UN squadron. UN squadron was kind of dull. All right. Well,
5620400	5626240	let's check out some other news going on in the gaming world with some rapid fire news. Um, let's
5626240	5630880	go to, uh, why did I type games in the sidebar tonight on Twitch TV? It should be rapid fire
5630880	5635360	news. That's all right. We'll talk about some games in rapid fire news. I guess that's what
5635360	5640720	happens when I type too fast, rapid fire type the stuff up tonight. I mush words together.
5640720	5647600	All right. Logie. All right. Um, so we've got some more announcements regarding fixes coming to
5648240	5655360	cyberpunk 2077. So the next fix that they have planned is going to be fixing the cop AI, which
5656080	5665280	it's severely needed and also the way the cars handle. So this is, um, patch 1.2 and they said
5665280	5671680	fewer cops are going to randomly spawn directly behind you. The second you pull, you step out,
5671680	5678160	um, they have adjustments for speed and steering, make driving easier and sensitivity slider
5678160	5685040	tweaks. They cars control even better, even when the frame rate dips down the new unstuck feature
5685040	5691360	that activates when you accelerate, but don't move because you're stuck on something and, uh,
5691360	5698160	more options for the wise bindings on keyboard and option to turn off double tapping, um,
5698160	5703840	the movement key to dodge. So, uh, that's supposed to be coming out here pretty soon,
5704640	5709520	but they haven't really announced yet when it's going to be coming. At least we know what it's
5709520	5716480	going to fix. And the copy, I mean, I've seen videos where they've spawned into walls and stuff
5716480	5720800	or you're up on a top of a building and you shoot somebody and also there's a cop like right behind
5720800	5727600	you. Like how, how did you get there? So, um, very cool to see that happening. Um, and then also
5728800	5736240	game that I'm not too excited about, but it is, uh, something that was shown off during the,
5736240	5742320	uh, you know, like kind of the E3 period last year. So Gotham Knights was the brand new
5742320	5748960	Warner brothers Montreal game. Well, it's been delayed to 2022, which is not surprising because
5748960	5756560	I know a lot of folks are, a lot of teams are behind with, um, just development because of
5756560	5764480	COVID. And of course, you know, the trend nowadays thankfully has been to give the developers a little
5764480	5771360	bit more time. So the game doesn't release as a buggy mess. So, um, yeah, glad to see that they're
5771360	5776960	giving it more time before we get to dark soccer's rapid fire news. I'm, I'm giggling here because,
5777440	5782160	we could hear Stella in the background or you're at Loki and dark soccer and chat,
5782160	5785040	but hi smush. And I was like, Oh no, that's not smush. That's Stella.
5785600	5790960	I should recognize the voice. She's across from, she's on the entire other side of the house.
5790960	5794480	She's not even in the same room as I am in right now. That's how loud she is.
5794480	5801040	But we have vaulted ceilings in there. No, we don't have vaulted ceilings. We just have a
5801040	5805760	cheap house. I've got a vaulted ceiling in mine just because they didn't build a, you know,
5806320	5810800	a ceiling. Yeah. It's a vaulted ceiling here too. Yeah. But, but, but what I was going to say is
5810800	5817760	that smush walked in here after that, because I think he heard Stella because there's also the
5817760	5821680	play through on the TV here. So I think here, cause I was like, well now smush is here cause
5821680	5826000	he's meowing at something. He probably heard Stella. That's just cracking me up. So no,
5826000	5831840	I think she's being kicked. See, she likes laying down in my oldest son's room and sleeps on his
5831840	5836320	bed. And so since they're going to bed, she probably got kicked out of there. And so now
5836320	5840640	she's screaming at everybody for attention. Oh no, smush is here because other daddy is
5840640	5847280	feeding him right now. That's why smushes. Yes. See, I, I lock Midna out of this room and I wear
5847280	5854480	headphones. So I wear headphones too, but this, this mic picks everything up. It's crazy. So,
5855120	5862400	all right. Anyhow, uh, let's mail, mail, mail, mail. Yes. And now a lot of folks in our chat
5862400	5869200	over twitch.tv slash VOG network are spanning the smush emote because Alan got a smush emote
5869200	5874960	because he's allowed, he's also smushes dad. So, uh, he took a smush emote for his channel,
5874960	5880000	which if you go to his channel, he always has a little, like instead of the NBC or CBS logo in
5880000	5885440	the corner all the time, he has a smush logo in the corner all the time. So, uh, he, he took that
5885440	5890480	emote, but people that are subbing to his channel are now spamming that emote here. So you might be
5890480	5894720	wondering, is VOG network going to get a smush emote? I don't know. We might. I mean, it's not
5894720	5901600	like we can't have more smush emotes. Um, but we maybe want a Midna emote or a Stella emote,
5901600	5908640	and maybe that'll be a thing. So we'll see. All right. Dark Tetsuya says my wife's cat heard all
5908640	5913760	the cat talk apparently. And then, uh, to which bonds double 06, uh, followed up with
5917600	5922880	instead of ASMR, it's going to be cat talk. Ready? ASMR needs to go away forever.
5925120	5928800	All right. Moving on, but cat talk, cat talk and stay, right?
5929600	5934160	Cat talk stays forever. ASMR dies. It's so terrible. It makes me so uncomfortable.
5934720	5938080	All right. Well, hopefully, uh, some rapid fire news won't make you uncomfortable.
5938080	5940160	Stark soccer. What do you have for us in rapid fire news tonight?
5941360	5947440	Well, um, super bomber man are, is going to be coming to PS4, Xbox one switch and PC is a free
5947440	5952960	to play title. Um, the PC one will be through steam. Um, and of course it was first announced
5952960	5959200	for Stadia, um, September, 2020. So now we're getting it everywhere else because Stadia is
5959200	5967120	dying, I think. And then technically no, but realistically, yeah.
5968080	5972720	Realistically it's looking like Deadpool right about now. Um, anyway, and then, uh,
5973440	5980480	there is a new owner for Toys R Us and they plan on reopening stores. Um, the quote says we're
5980480	5985600	coming off a year where toys are on fire and for Toys R Us, the U S is really a blank canvas.
5986320	5994640	So, uh, they've actually tried a couple of pop-up locations, um, that closed due to poor traffic.
5994640	6001600	Um, you know, that just had to do from COVID, but, um, they are looking like they're coming
6001600	6005040	back and meeting that's purchased on the Toys R Us website right now, those still being routed
6005040	6010640	through Amazon, just saying so cool. We can still be Toys R Us kidlets.
6013280	6018640	That'll be nice to go to stores again, to go to the mall again. I mean, I guess technically
6018640	6022800	I could go now, but I just haven't really, I haven't really had the desire to go to, uh, you
6022800	6029840	know, uh, bed bath and beyond that strongly, you know, to brave them all. So, but now, now that the
6029840	6034000	jabs are here, I'm feeling a little better. I'll feel a lot better in about a month.
6035040	6042160	I am not going until that two weeks after I've had my shot. Yeah. I'm then I'm going to fucking San
6042160	6047520	Francisco. I know I'm trying to be a good boy too. And, uh, wait, but I'm, I'm, uh, very happy
6047520	6051760	thinking ahead to may, you know, even if we can't have the big conventions yet, we don't know. We
6051760	6056320	don't know the status of some of these. The nice thing will be, is that like, I can go see a movie
6056960	6062480	and not feel like it's going to be, you know, a horrific experience. It'll be nice to have some
6062480	6069600	normal things back. Uh, COVID living hasn't been any different. Well, except working from home and,
6069600	6074560	and having to leave the house even less for me, it's been very different. So, all right. Anyhow,
6074560	6079360	let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. Uh, let's start with Loki. What
6079360	6084320	video games are coming out in the U S this week? Uh, we've got vaporium lockdown on
6084320	6090240	Nintendo switch, overcooked all you can eat on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation four and Xbox one

6107120	6113920	afterschool activity. Why, why home meeting? Why is that a name? Uh, that's on PlayStation four,

6176480	6184880	and two on PlayStation five and Xbox series X. And finally record of lotus wars deed it in wonder
6185200	6191600	in wonder labyrinth. I bought that game and that's on PC. I need to play that game. I love
6191600	6197200	load us where I even have, uh, the first book. All right. Traveling to Japan and checking out
6197200	6202880	the releases there on the Nintendo switch. We have a game, uh, called memories off Historia.
6202880	6206880	That's not, uh, it's off, uh, volume one and volume two. And then there's a limited edition.
6206880	6211760	I imagine that's kind of a bundle of both of them, uh, coming out on the switch this week. Also the
6211760	6216880	house in Fata Morgana dreams of the revenants edition comes out on the switch this week as
6216880	6223760	well. AI kiss two in regular and limited edition and a sea of saltitude. The director's cut comes
6223760	6230800	out in Japan as well. A busy week in Japan, my heavens, uh, a clockwork lay line, uh, Kageiro
6230800	6236880	no Samayo Majo comes out this week and the quintessential quintuplets summer memories also
6236880	6242960	come in five. That is the name of the game comes out this week. Uh, SD Gundam G generation Genesis
6242960	6249200	for Nintendo switch also out this week, busy week. And there's lastly a game called lover pretend,
6249200	6253680	which I thought was kind of an interesting name. I was like lover pretend. Is that like a one night
6253680	6257760	lover? Like what is that? Uh, but it turns out it looks like it's based on a manga as you know,
6257760	6262320	some of these games are, uh, often, uh, doing that. And I was kind of like reading up on what
6262320	6267280	this is and I guess it's about a main character and, uh, she is studying for university and
6267280	6273600	doing part-time work and she wants to become a script writer, uh, which was also her mom's dream.
6273600	6280240	And then she wants to find her father who she never met. So she goes to talk to people that
6280240	6291280	were involved in the drama and as such becomes cast in the, the drama itself as the love interest.
6291280	6296560	So it's a fake. So lover pretend is because she's the fake love interest in the, I don't know.
6296560	6300240	I was like, this is some drama for a Nintendo switch game. This is some drama
6301280	6307600	anyway, uh, on the PlayStation five this week, uh, ballon wonderland. And that's really about it.
6307600	6312240	It's a much slower week in the PlayStation universe. All right. Uh, let's move on dark
6312240	6318080	soccer. How about the UK? Just a little bit. We have, um, uh, uh, basically all of this is
6318080	6323840	on the 26th. We have over overcooked, all you can eat, uh, samurai showdown. Oh wait,
6323840	6329600	that's the 23rd. Sorry. The 25th we have hunting simulator to tennis world tour to, um,
6330480	6337520	monster truck championship. Um, on the 26th, we have, uh, the monster Hunter, uh,
6337520	6344160	Nintendo switch edition plus the pro controller, um, hot shot racing. We have a story of seasons,
6344160	6351200	pioneers of all of town. We have monster Hunter rise ballon, wonder world space-based star topia.
6351200	6357200	That's just a cool sounding name. Isn't it? And it takes two. All right. Pretty busy week for games,
6357200	6361120	all things considered all around the world. All right. We have some more news stories for you
6361120	6365680	guys, and then we're going to take more of your comments and questions and discussion items,
6365680	6370160	um, in our listener round table segment. So, um, joining the fun over at twitch.tv slash
6370160	6374800	VOG network, or you can always send the show an email participate at orange lounge radio.com.
6374800	6379040	I think we have a couple of those tonight, but we'll get to those later for now. We have some
6379040	6386080	news Loki. Yeah. So Google has announced that they're going to be dropping the service fees
6386640	6392960	on the first million that developers make off of their apps on the Google play store,
6393760	6401200	from 15% to 30 or from 30 to 15%. So that's going to start July 1st. And that's for the
6401200	6405840	first million dollars that they make on their app. Um, they said that of course,
6405840	6410560	that's helping developers build sustainable business is part of the core part of Google
6410560	6414960	plays mission. We're working with partners every day to understand their challenges that they face
6414960	6420400	and bring them innovative ideas. Um, I think this probably is directly related to the whole
6420400	6427360	Epic games, uh, lawsuit thing that they had with Google play and over the app store
6427360	6433920	on the Apple side of things. Um, I mean, it's a good move that they are dropping that fee down,
6433920	6439040	but I have a feeling it's somewhat related to that. So I guess we'll see what, what happens
6439040	6444320	with this. Well, it's also kind of reminiscent of what, um, some of the stores on PC have been
6444320	6450480	doing, right? Cause, uh, didn't Epic games start a thing there that kind of had waves where, you
6450480	6454800	know, folks are taking smaller cuts, at least for that first little chunk of money. Well, yeah,
6454800	6461200	Epic games had always had like smaller fees. Um, I think, you know, steam was still the one that
6461200	6467440	was kind of like, you know, uh, charging more. I want to say though that steam has a deal in place
6467440	6472400	too for certain things, but I can't remember the details on that. And I want to say that was
6472400	6476720	something more for like almost larger developers, like after a certain period of time, they'd take
6476720	6482480	less, but I don't remember. It's been a while, but yeah, I'm sure this is directly related to
6482480	6489440	their lawsuits. Hmm. We'll have to see what develops with the lawsuits. All right, moving on.
6489440	6495760	So whereas there's a smaller cut from Google there, uh, if you are a G force now, uh, person,
6495760	6498880	there's going to be a larger cut in the future. Well, actually, no, not if you're, if you're
6498880	6503040	using it today, nothing's going to change for you. But if you were thinking about getting on
6503040	6508000	G force now, uh, it's going to cost you a little more money at this point. So here's what happened.
6508000	6514160	Uh, Nvidia doubled the price of G force now up to $10 a month. So it was $5 a month before
6514160	6518320	now it's $10 a month. Uh, if you want an annual plan, it's going to be a hundred dollars a year.
6518320	6523200	The good news is though, if you are already subscribing to this, you're now locked into
6523200	6528400	the founder's plan, all the same perks as priority, only $5 a month. So that's pretty
6528400	6533680	cool. I wish Netflix would do that. Uh, instead of the price going up every, every couple months,
6533680	6538880	um, you're locked in at $5, essentially for life, as long as you don't cancel,
6538880	6542320	pause, you know, as long as your subscription stays in good standing, you're locked in at that
6542320	6547680	$5 rate. So, um, that's pretty cool. But yeah, if you've been waiting to get in on G force now,
6547680	6553040	whoops, you waited too long. Now it's going to cost $10 a month. Um, Nvidia, uh, in an interview
6553040	6558480	with a games beat, uh, was talking about the $10 a month is the target price. They were really
6558480	6562560	wanting to go for this whole time. They were subsidizing the cost to make the service more
6562560	6566960	appealing. If you haven't used G force now, it kind of came around at the same time as say
6566960	6572000	things like stadia. And it's somewhat the same concept. It's cloud gaming. However,
6572000	6577920	uh, it's cloud gaming based on titles you already own. So if you bought a game on steam,
6577920	6584720	you can essentially play that game in the cloud with a G force. Now, if the studio has allowed
6584720	6589440	it, because this, uh, service was in the news a lot in the early days, because they put a lot
6589440	6595120	of games on it that, uh, developers didn't want it on it because they saw it as kind of infringing
6595120	6600080	on their rights and the money that they're entitled to. So only so many games have really
6600080	6604800	allowed themselves to be on this platform. Um, I know I've, I've played because they have a free
6604800	6608720	version. If you want to try it, you're limited to like an hour and you have to wait a little
6608720	6612800	bit, a couple of minutes to get into your game session. But I played around with no man's sky,
6612800	6617840	of course, love that game. I played around with that in the G force now. And it was, uh, it was,
6617840	6624320	you know, it was similar to stadia, you know, uh, it was like I was playing a YouTube live. Um,
6624320	6629120	but, uh, it's nice for especially computers that maybe are having a hard time, uh, struggling with
6629120	6635200	a game that you bought that really demands high-end hardware there. So also an update,
6635200	6640000	apparently coming out to G force now, um, that will, uh, improve streaming quality through an
6640000	6646560	adaptive V sync technology. This will sync frame rates at either 60 Hertz or 59.94 Hertz on the
6646560	6650720	server side to match how the games are displayed in the client that they are looking to cut down
6650720	6656960	stutter and latency with this. So that's kind of interesting. Um, I'm curious, especially for the
6656960	6662800	chat, what do you all think about this G force now? Do any of you use it? Do any of you find
6662800	6667520	it to be the preferable alternative to stadia? I do like that. Essentially, if you buy a game,
6668400	6674320	you have it on both services. Now it's the whole, you got to pony up money to use somebody else's
6674320	6680080	computer, but I suppose that's not much different than say using a VPN or something like that.
6680080	6683760	So I don't know, Loki, any interest from you for, uh, G force now?
6684960	6691520	No, not really. Cause I'm not going to stream more games considering that, uh, I have so many
6691520	6697600	of my games already that I don't play. So I just don't have a real need to stream stuff with G
6697600	6703360	force. Now I'll just install them and play them if I need to. But yeah, probably not.
6704160	6710720	Ice P in chat says G force now. I'm sorry. It's ice P one in chat says G force. Now I can't take
6710720	6714880	the latency. I don't remember having latency issues. I'll have to try it again. To be fair.
6714880	6718720	I played it like months ago and it was first in the headlines. I never bothered paying for it.
6718720	6722720	I just played the free version just because I was curious, wanting to check it out. Um,
6722720	6728400	tiger law does say you need good internet for G force now, however. Um, and, uh,
6728480	6733360	as a 200, Matt says, how about getting one of those G force RTX cards?
6733360	6739840	Now talk about things. You're just going to give up on buying until it's actually on the store
6739840	6745600	shell for those high-end graphics cards. My God, that's a whole other, I'm scared for the day.
6745600	6749760	I finally need to update my graphics card cause games won't run on my PC anymore. I might have
6749760	6753520	to use cloud gaming cause I'm not going to be able to find a fucking graphics card because people
6753520	6760880	need their doge coin, I guess. Ugh. All right. Anyhow, hopefully the pandemic will solve some,
6760880	6766160	one or sorry, is the pandemic being over or I shouldn't say over, but, um, behind us,
6766160	6771440	let's say, uh, will be, uh, help some of these issues, but we'll see. Moving on.
6771440	6774160	How about a subject that I know dark saga is very interested in.
6775120	6782400	Yay. Dragon age. Um, so, uh, BioWare, um, you know, basically threw us a bone,
6782400	6788520	all of us who have been waiting for dragon age four. We hadn't had any news in a while. Um,
6790160	6795600	so it is going, you know, they did, uh, basically have a report that they're going to be dropping
6795600	6799360	all of the multiplayer features that they were going to put in it just to keep it as a single
6799360	6809040	player RPG. Um, but they did release some concept art, um, for, it looks like a, a mage character.
6809040	6814000	Um, really cool looking. I like the, the style of it. I've always actually liked the,
6815120	6820560	ever since dragon age two, I think that they've really found their styles for the various parts,
6820560	6828560	you know, areas in, in their world. Um, but yeah, they put this Twitter up and saying that
6828560	6832880	we could use a little pick me up. So it was awfully nice of them. And of course, uh,
6833840	6840720	we're not going to really get the game until probably, uh, April, 2022. So it'll be next
6840720	6846080	year's birthday present, but Hey, at least you have that mass effect trilogy coming up.
6847120	6852240	I got to decide if, if, if they don't do a Mac version, then I got to get a new card for
6852240	6859600	my, my poor dying PC. So we'll see no interest in trying console just to kind of bridge it.
6859600	6866160	I thought I'd try. I'm going to, I'm going to get it for my series X,
6866160	6872000	but I played the series the first time. What I mod. Oh yeah. There is that true, true.
6872960	6878080	All right. Yeah. Let's move on to, uh, games in the future. We might be able to mod Loki.
6879040	6885600	Well, uh, Jade Raymond has announced that she is going to be formatting or forming a new,
6886240	6892240	uh, independent studio called Haven. And that they're going to be working on a brand new IP
6892240	6900720	developed for PlayStation better luck. Wasn't she in the news like two weeks ago for leaving stadia?
6901840	6910000	Yeah. So, well, first party development. So, uh, she says, I'm proud to, uh, proud of the
6910000	6915760	team we built at stadia, um, games, entertainment, and the ground breaking work on exclusive games
6915760	6920000	for that platform. It was difficult decision to take a new opportunity and I will be forever
6920000	6927440	grateful for this team for everything we learned at chief together, Google. Yeah. She didn't put
6927440	6933920	that in there, but, um, but yeah, so they're apparently, uh, I mean, working on new IP,
6933920	6940640	so we'll have to see what that is, but that sounds pretty exciting. Yeah. Like I said,
6940640	6945120	good for her. And I liked the fact that it's an original IP. And so it's something that Sony's
6945120	6950240	trying to use to kind of add to their side of things. So, um, we'll have to see what they come
6950240	6955200	up with. Obviously this is, this ain't something you're going to be playing until like 2024.
6956000	6961920	It's just going to be a ways out, but, um, it's, it's, it's in progress, I guess. All right.
6961920	6968720	That'd be interesting. Well, if you want to play some games a lot sooner on the PlayStation, uh,
6968720	6975120	boy, oh boy, they're coming through with 10 free games. That's right. Not, not PlayStation plus
6975120	6980240	games. Those are still a thing that happened every month, but this is under the, um, uh,
6981040	6987040	PlayStation play at home promo, uh, is that they're actually giving away 10 free games. However,
6987040	6991360	you only have about a month to grab them. So from March 25th at eight in the evening,
6991360	6995920	and I wouldn't try to grab it right when they go live, till April 22nd at eight in the evening,
6995920	7002960	you can grab Abzu, Enter the Gungeon, Rez Infinite, Subnautica, The Witness,
7003600	7011360	Astro Bot Rescue Mission, Moss, Thumper, and Paper Beast, all for free. It should be pointed out,
7011360	7017600	the Astro Bot Rescue Mission, Moss, and Paper Beast. Those are PlayStation VR titles. Otherwise
7017600	7023040	two of them are VR optional titles. The music games are as infinite and thumper. Um, but still,
7023040	7028560	uh, yeah, that's pretty amazing. Now I only named nine games. That's because the 10th game,
7028560	7035600	Horizon Zero Dawn, the complete edition will be free from April 19th until May 14th. That's my
7035600	7041360	birthday. So that will happy birthday. Here's a free game. Um, right now for some people, I mean,
7041360	7049600	it's, it's, I gotta say, if you're on PlayStation Plus, I think at least one, two, three, four of
7049600	7057200	these have been PlayStation Plus titles in the past. However, um, free is free. Uh, and that is
7057200	7062080	sometimes the price you pay of being an early adopter, right? You buy Final Fantasy 7 remake
7062080	7066640	for 60 bucks and then a year later they're giving it away, but they, they have some nice perks for
7066960	7071600	the folks that were in there originally. And I bet, well, I was going to say, I bet with
7071600	7075440	Horizon Zero Dawn, they're not giving away the DLC, but then it's staring me right there in the
7075440	7080720	face. Complete edition. So how about that? But of course, they're trying to stir up a lot of buzz
7080720	7087600	for the sequel. I'm sure. Ain't nothing real free in this world. Anyway, uh, this is Play at Home
7087600	7093680	2021. There is also a 90 day trial that is an extended trial for Funimation. If you're, uh,
7093680	7098800	wanting to get in on that, you have from March 25th to April 22nd to get in on that.
7098800	7103360	So again, you do not need PlayStation Plus for these free games. This is outside of that.
7103360	7109680	All you need is a PlayStation device to play them on. And I would imagine a PS5 would work for all
7109680	7115120	these PS4 games with your backwards compatibility. Uh, just the VR titles, you know, unless you have
7115120	7119920	that adapter are going to be a little, little trickier, but pretty cool. Uh, anything in that
7119920	7125760	list you guys are going to be grabbing? I'll grab everything. I haven't, I don't think I've
7125760	7131120	Astrobot yet, but yeah, I was gonna say I have everything except the VR only titles. So the
7131120	7135200	Astrobot and Moss are like the only things that I literally have every other game that they're
7135200	7140480	giving away, but I'm not mad because I realized for other people, it's going to be a chance that,
7140480	7145760	you know, they're getting to play the games for the first time. So pretty cool. Uh, good point
7145760	7152400	from bonds, double 06. I have four of those games in Epic platform. So on PC and the Epic store,
7152400	7156880	sometimes they do giveaways and some of those games will actually a lot like every week. So
7156880	7161200	some of those games have been in the Epic, uh, free stuff too. Uh, and pixel pockets is
7161200	7165120	recommending Moss. It's a great game. Highly recommended if you have PlayStation VR. Yeah.
7165120	7169600	I've heard of that one before. And I, you know, a lot of times with these games, there's probably
7169600	7174560	a reason they're giving them away too, is that they really kind of show off the platform. Um,
7174560	7179760	and it's, you know, especially with a lot of the rabble rabble in the last week being game pass,
7179760	7184800	game pass, game pass. Maybe this isn't Sony's answer to game pass, but this is definitely
7184800	7190320	Sony's like, here's how we treat our PlayStation crowd. You know, here's just 10 free games on the
7190320	7196640	house. Enjoy. So something for everyone. It's interesting. All right. I thought, I thought
7196640	7202560	free games was a nice thing to end things on tonight. All right. Uh, let's get into the Lister
7202560	7208640	round table every week. We invite you guys to, um, add things to the show, uh, whether it be in
7208640	7214240	our chat room or through our mailbag participate at orange lounge radio.com. And I think dark
7214240	7222080	Sakura is going to open up the mailbag right now. Yep. We, um, we have two emails, so I'll go ahead
7222080	7227680	and read the first. Um, this one comes from Ranma greetings, everyone. I hope that everyone had a
7227680	7231920	great week, Rob, and the last couple of episodes, you mentioned a couple of things I wanted to
7231920	7236720	discuss when you mentioned how conventions are going virtual with events and panels,
7236720	7240880	and that when we return to some sense of normalcy, that streaming will still be a part of the
7240880	7246160	convention. That is something that I wish for as well. The problem is most hotels and convention
7246160	7250480	centers may not have the bandwidth for it from working with other Twitch streamers,
7250480	7256960	having a connection up to 10 megs up and down is perfect for a 10 ADP stream. Most hotels and
7256960	7262160	convention centers will have a two megabit connection. If that I can vouch for this and
7262160	7266400	they charge an arm and a leg for higher speed connections. If it is available because of that,
7266400	7271040	I have a feeling that the conventions will drop that and rely on recording panels and events to
7271040	7278320	post on their YouTube page at a later date. On top of that, uh, these conventions would need to set
7278320	7283600	up cameras and streaming equipment in each room. Some conventions may have the finances to do this.
7283600	7289760	Others may not be so lucky, but I am one of the few geek media outlets that have come prepared
7289760	7295040	and will help to the best of my abilities. So let's hope, I think it means that this can be
7295040	7299920	a part of the new norm. You're at home dude. Um, uh, I also think when it comes to like the
7299920	7306080	hotel thing and their shitty internet as the joke, this is going to be something that I think is
7306080	7311440	going to be like the convention centers of, of the world and the hotels. This is something that
7311440	7315680	they're going to need to up their game on because if they see this coming where there's going to be
7315680	7320720	more of a demand for virtual events, then they need to stop being the laughing stock of internet.
7320720	7326960	And I understand a convention with thousands of nerds places a huge demand on bad bandwidth.
7326960	7332240	It's very challenging to me. I get that. But I think this is a challenge that the hotel and
7332240	7336880	the convention center industry kind of needs to meet in that new normal. I think if we're talking
7336880	7344240	about the, the industry is changing, then all parts of that industry, not just the convention
7344240	7348880	itself, but the venues that are charging the conventions money to host them are going to
7348880	7352800	have to change. If I were going to put on a convention and I knew this place had shitty
7352800	7356480	internet and this place had decent internet, I'd want to go to the place of decent internet.
7356480	7361840	So I think this is something we might see. Maybe that reputation may evolve a little bit, but again,
7362800	7368960	it's, it's tough for these hotels and stuff because they're just not prepared for a convention
7368960	7374960	that draws thousands of nerds when most of the year they don't have those types of conventions.
7374960	7378560	So it'll be, it'll, it'll really, I mean, when we're talking about the convention scene,
7378560	7385280	we have to talk about business conventions, you know, conventions about bridal expos and car
7385280	7391120	shows that also, if they're not evolving to some more virtual stuff, then these venues are not
7391120	7395360	going to see the need. So something to think about anyway, sorry, Jamie, but wanted to respond
7395360	7401520	to that before we move on to another bullet. Okay. The next point, number two, you also
7401520	7406240	mentioned that OLR is about gaming, even though it was all the other hosts have taken time out
7406240	7410240	to talk about other important matters last week. I don't fully remember if you said that was a good
7410240	7415200	thing or not and apologizing for going off topic, but to be honest, most of us are here for that.
7415200	7422240	I love how you, Jamie and Matt bring up important topics here for, sorry, I got lost,
7422240	7427840	that us gamers need to know. So many people listen to podcasts and why not? And I do know that we
7427840	7433040	lost a listener when you spoke about BLM. I was touched and moved by that. That was something I
7433040	7438240	truly appreciated. And if anyone else has a problem with that, then they can stop listening. OLR is
7438240	7444800	family and we take care of family and no one gets left behind. Amen. I guess ironic considering the
7444800	7448560	topic, I didn't know this was a thing so ironic considering the topic we were talking about
7448560	7454640	earlier, but from the heart, that's all I can say. And honestly, I have learned a lot from the
7454640	7461680	audience. I think that's something you guys need to keep in mind. I am so thankful that we have
7461680	7467520	such a diverse group of people willing to waste three to four hours on a Sunday night to listen
7467520	7472720	to this because I learned from you guys too. And that's an important part of this. So thank you.
7473360	7479440	Number three. And lastly, today we at Anime Jam Session did a virtual convention. We did a 60
7479440	7484960	minute version of our podcast. That went quite well. And for this, I pulled out my vog polo and
7484960	7489840	wore it. I then realized how much I missed wearing that shirt at conventions. And I do look forward
7489840	7493760	to the day when my whole staff can rock our vog polos at the next convention that is safe.
7494560	7499120	Well, that's all on my mind for now. I must go seeing how I haven't had lunch yet and I'm
7499760	7504880	starving. Take care, everyone. And I will see you all on the flip side, Ranma.
7506000	7510240	I miss wearing the shirts to conventions too. Although I'm going to be honest, my polo has
7510240	7515360	seen better days at this point. But that's why I'm sporting one of the new shirts. I bought two of
7515360	7521200	these. Well, two different types. We have some different stuff over at vognetwork.com slash shop
7521200	7526800	if you want to pick up a shirt. And when the convention- Which we still need V-neck ladies
7526800	7530080	shirts. Get on me about that during the week and not during the middle of the live show and
7530080	7537120	I'll go in there and add it. So all right. And we need more designs for shirts, so I'll trade you.
7537760	7543680	All right. Well, I've been making music, so. I guess that works too. But anyway, yeah,
7543680	7547200	check out the shop and we'll be adding to that. And especially when the convention scene comes
7547200	7552960	back, we'll want people to have shirts they can wear and have our name on it because that's free
7552960	7560080	advertising for us. So thanks. Awesome. Next email. Next email. Thank you, Ranma, for that email.
7561200	7568560	Hello, LR. Do we all miss going to conventions and festivals? Hey, this is Deja Vu. I sure do.
7568560	7573120	And so do the folks who have been running the MAGFest Indie Video Game Showcase for over the
7573120	7578400	last several years. Now, under the new title, Indie Maker Syndicate, they're running their
7578400	7583120	first virtual indie game showcase. It's called Maker's Play and it's taking place this weekend
7583120	7588400	from Friday, March 26th to Sunday, March 28th. I guess that's this upcoming weekend. Yeah,
7588400	7592560	this upcoming weekend. Yeah. Forty five games are being featured during this event, which will be
7592560	7597520	taking place across Twitch and Discord. On the Discord server, each game has its own set of
7597520	7603680	channels where you'll be able to chat with the developers, watch the games be streamed and even
7603680	7609360	play them remotely using the Parsec app. On Twitch stream, you'll be able to watch special
7609360	7614800	guest streamers try a selection of featured games. And if that wasn't enough, there's even a VR chat
7614800	7619680	virtual expo hall featuring all of the developers games. You might be wondering why I'm bringing
7619680	7624400	this up. Well, it's because Super Multitasking will be one of the featured games. And to celebrate
7624400	7628720	Super Multitasking is getting a free weekend on Steam. That's right. If you haven't yet taken the
7628800	7634320	plunge, you'll be able to try the full game for free this weekend. And it'll be discounted 25%
7634320	7637760	too if you want to pick it up. If you're interested in checking out Maker's Play,
7637760	7644960	you can check yyrgames.com, the Super Multitasking page on Steam, the Vug Network Discord,
7644960	7651440	or indymakerssyndicate.com for more information. I hope to see you all virtually next weekend.
7651440	7655680	Thanks again for the show and have a great week. Keep on playing. Aaron, yyr.
7655920	7663760	Aaron Congrats on that convention, yyr. That's a very clever way to do it in this day and age.
7663760	7671120	So you know, obviously, I'm hopeful we can have a magfest by February. But I love this idea. It's
7671120	7675520	like a bandaid to kind of hold I'm sorry, but I guess it's I guess it's a January thing. The
7675520	7682880	February one was my favorite, though. Sorry. But the the fact that you have this whole virtual
7682960	7687760	thing is pretty cool. So that sounds like a really clever way to do it. I like the idea of like,
7687760	7692080	you go into the different Discord channels and you can actually play the game and talk with the
7692080	7695920	developer there. That's that's pretty rad. I love that. You guys thought that went through.
7697600	7703120	And I'm all for Super Multitasking, getting more exposure. Good for you. All right.
7703120	7704320	We like exposure.
7705280	7713600	For sure. All right. Let's see. SJ 100 Matt in chat says most folks like the February magfest.
7713600	7718560	Bobby Blackwell says except for magfest. Look, I actually and the January thing like it's the
7718560	7724400	January thing is not a deal breaker for me. Like I think it was for Bobby. I'm open to coming back
7724400	7731520	to magfest, especially now. The the upside of this pandemic. I mean, I have to look real hard to find
7731520	7737040	one. But the upside is that I have a lot like I don't have the time off issues I had at my last
7737040	7740480	employer. I had to stop going to as many conventions because my last employer didn't
7740480	7745760	give as much time off as I was used to at the job I was at for 14 years. So I was a job for 14 years.
7745760	7749760	And having been there so long, I had a lot of time off to go out to a lot of conventions. I went to a
7749760	7754880	new employer. They were fine. I have nothing bad to say about them. The only downside was that I
7754880	7758000	because I was new, I didn't really have time off. I couldn't go to all the conventions I used to
7758000	7764720	once I took my week for Dragon Con and only left me with so much. Now I'm at a third employer. And
7765680	7771120	the thing is with all this going on right now in the world, I'm not taking time off,
7771120	7775760	even though I probably should be. But I will not have those same issues I was having last employer.
7775760	7780000	It's a little more generous in that department. So without giving away all, you know, I don't
7780000	7784400	like to talk about my day job. You guys know I like to keep that separate. But like now it's
7784400	7788720	just a money thing. Can I afford the flight out to DC? And, you know, I have to be mindful of
7788720	7795040	those sorts of things. But if the money is there, it's a possibility. So I don't want to promise yet.
7795040	7799760	And obviously we have to see how COVID changes everything. But is going to MAGFest on the table?
7799760	7805040	Yes. Going back to MAGFest is absolutely on the table. Even if I don't end up going to MAGFest,
7805040	7810160	is going out to a different convention on the East Coast, such as New York Comic Con on the table?
7810160	7818320	Yes, absolutely. I'm going to be open to new and interesting ideas. What's that other one?
7819200	7824800	Is it FlameCon? There's some LGBTQ thing in New York I've always wanted to go to. And that's
7824800	7833680	going to be on the table for me as well. So we will see. All right. And Bobby Bockel says,
7833680	7839280	hell, I'm open to going to California to a con. Yeah. I mean, anything's possible. Oh,
7839280	7843280	like California Xtreme. Oh, that's a fun one. Next summer, you'd enjoy that.
7843280	7846320	Yeah. I'm looking forward to California Xtreme returning.
7846320	7850720	Oh, Bobby, you should think about that. And the Golden State Pinball Expo,
7852800	7856800	which we usually take our tables to. Because Bobby, if you come out here for California
7856800	7863280	Xtreme, we can do a day. Like, again, I'm daydreaming of a back to normal world. But,
7863280	7868720	you know, we can, you know, go to, I guess you've done a lot of the San Francisco stuff probably,
7868720	7871200	but there's probably other stuff up and down the Bay Area we can think of going
7871760	7875040	and do that stuff. So it'd be fun. All right. And DJ Rama S says, yes,
7875040	7881520	it's FlameCon is what I'm thinking of. Yes. So, all right. There was no other emails, right?
7881520	7883200	That was it? That was it.
7883200	7887840	All right. Participate at orangelandrater.com if you have an email for a future week.
7888640	7892480	I do want to open up, if you guys have any questions or comments in chat,
7892480	7896080	things you want us to discuss, please make sure you get that out there in chat so we can
7896080	7899600	talk about that. If there's been something, I think I've missed it. So you might want to post
7899600	7905120	that again. Meanwhile, while we wait on that, Loki, do we have any last minute stories tonight?
7905920	7910960	Just one thing I was going to mention. So we talked a few weeks ago how Microsoft was adding
7910960	7918400	some FPS boosts to certain games to allow them to run at a higher frame rate. Well, because of the
7918400	7924400	recent acquisition of Bethesda titles, there were some Bethesda games that also got that treatment.
7924400	7928960	So Dishonored Definitive Edition, Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Special Edition,
7930000	7938160	Fallout 4, Fallout 76, and Prey are now part of that FPS boost program. So that's pretty awesome.
7939360	7947840	Looks like that most of those are going to be increasing from 30 to 60 FPS. So, cool.
7947840	7955440	All right. And yeah, to clarify, because Bobby was like, I don't know if I would fly
7955440	7959520	out to California this summer. No, no, I'm sorry. My frame of reference was 2022.
7961040	7965760	So yeah, I'm not, pretty much at this point, I'm not considering anything until 2022
7965760	7971760	with the exception of Dragon Con, because I know they're only going to hold it if it's safe.
7972160	7979200	Um, and that's, that's that. So, um, yeah, Bobby says, I'm going to stick with road trips in late
7979200	7984000	2021. Then that's, that's fine. You know, we'll, we'll see how things change, but, um, just
7984000	7987280	encourage those, you know, to get the vaccine. That's how we're going to, and, you know,
7987280	7992160	when it comes to variants and things like that, well, one way to stop the virus from mutating
7992160	7996160	is to stop it from spreading. And you can do that through a vaccine and the vaccines have been
7996160	8000720	pretty effective so far, it seems like against the variants, maybe even if not as effective,
8000720	8007120	but even if a vaccine will stop you from being hospitalized, um, it's, it's probably
8007120	8011760	worth taking. So please look into that. All right. Um, I don't really see a lot of other
8011760	8016720	topics in chat to talk about. So I think we are towards the end of the program tonight.
8016720	8020080	Um, I know it's a little early, but some weeks are faster than others. That's just the way it
8020080	8024240	goes sometimes. Uh, I want to thank you guys for listening to Orange Lawns Radio tonight and
8024240	8027680	spending some time with us here at the Voice of Geeks Network. If you enjoyed what you heard
8027680	8032080	here at Orange Lawns Radio, help us spread the word, uh, because we are the show where every
8032080	8037040	gamer has a voice, but if the voices aren't here to put out on air, then, uh, we don't have them.
8037040	8043360	So, um, uh, please help us spread the word. An auto host on Twitch goes a long way. I know I find
8043360	8047360	a lot of new channels through what my friends are hosting. So, uh, please consider an auto host of
8047360	8050960	VOG Network. That really, really helps us. And thank you for that. Um, I want to give a quick
8050960	8056160	plug. Speaking of the VOG Network channel, Bobby Black Wolf is going to be live on Wednesday nights.
8056240	8060800	I know it moved. So Bobby, please correct me if I'm wrong, but Wednesday night, um, at OLR time.
8060800	8066320	So six Pacific, nine Eastern. Um, and he's going to be, uh, streaming, uh, the, the channel point
8066320	8070960	rewards. You all raised the points for, uh, those of you that watch live, he's going to be doing
8070960	8077600	his old VHS stream. So if you want to see like E3 in the Atlanta years, which was what, like 98,
8077600	8083200	uh, he's going to be doing that stuff, uh, live on Wednesday night. So that's going to be fun.
8083840	8089360	Uh, so check that out. And that also means that starting next weekend,
8089360	8094400	we're going to open up the pool for the second VOG reward stream, which will be
8094400	8100240	that, uh, Shane's definitive Pokemon rankings. That will be the next one. Hey,
8100240	8104800	so here's a funny thing I want to talk about real quick. My, my kids were watching. Uh,
8104800	8110320	they have a new Pokemon series that's on, um, Netflix. I guess it's something that they're
8110320	8116800	doing. And, um, I don't know which series it is. I don't remember, but they had a character named
8117840	8124560	shame. Um, and he, he collected shinies and it immediately reminded me of Shane. I thought that
8124560	8130080	was hilarious that they have a character that's all he's doing is collecting shinies. Well,
8130080	8136080	obviously they listened to pokey stop podcasts. Clearly they did. It was just, it was pretty
8136080	8141280	funny. But, um, yeah, so that was just, I just saw that the other day when they were watching,
8141280	8147280	I was like, wait, that's totally Shane right there. So God, I wish he was listening right
8147280	8153200	now. I'll have to send him this clip. All right. That's funny. Um, all right. So, um, I think,
8153200	8157680	I think that's it. Where was I was, I was in the middle of, uh, giving my, uh, uh, plugs here at
8157680	8162960	the end. Uh, Oh yes. I was going to say the store vog network.com. Sorry. His name was not Shane.
8162960	8165760	His name is literally Shane. It's Shane seeker.
8168240	8175920	Hold on. He, he, he literally, um, he collects Pokemon, shiny Pokemon. So Shane seeker,
8177920	8184320	did you know they put you in the Pokemon anime?
8186320	8189040	Okay. I just said it. I'll see what I get back. All right.
8189760	8194640	Orange. Right. Put a link in the chat. Oh, that's, that's awfully convenient.
8196960	8202480	How about that? Oh, it looks nothing like him though. Right. I understand that. But the
8202480	8210000	character, I mean, it's just funny, Shane. And he also, you know, collects, uh, shiny Pokemon.
8210000	8214960	I just thought it was quite the convenient or the coincidence that is quite, quite the coincidence.
8215200	8220080	That's quinky dinkle. All right. Uh, where was I and all the plugs? I don't know.
8220080	8224160	Thank you for listening and, uh, please continue to support the show. You all are wonderful for
8224160	8228320	being here every week. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Uh, let's go around and get everybody's
8228320	8233600	final thoughts. So, um, I'll start with my final thought. Cause I already kind of got into it
8233600	8239200	earlier in the show, but, um, we all need to do our part to, um, stop, uh, the hate in our society
8239200	8244320	and, uh, ask yourself what you're going to do beyond a social media, uh, performative posts
8244320	8248720	and what you're really going to do to, um, you know, make things better in the world.
8249280	8252560	Uh, that's my final thought. Uh, we'll go to Loki. Your final thought.
8253680	8257760	Uh, my final thought is I'm hoping to get a lot done on my game this week. So,
8257760	8264080	um, I'll keep you updated. All right. Good luck. And last but not least star soccer,
8264080	8269280	your final thought. Nothing changes until you make it change. Reject false icons.
8269280	8274960	Ooh, a classic. I've missed that one. All right. Have a wonderful week. Everybody
8274960	8280320	we'll see you in seven days for another March episode. Eight 62. Happy gaming.
