0	13520	This week, I learned that the PlayStation Store is still available for PSPs, PSVitas,
13520	17600	and PS3s, which make Sony way more legacy compatible than any other console manufacturer,
17600	18600	at least until this summer.
18600	22080	On a related note, if you still have a PSP or PSVita, please check its battery.
22080	25380	There were reports of battery swelling sometime back and now is still as good a time as any
25380	27080	to make sure that yours hasn't.
27080	29820	Swelling batteries are an awful chemical and or fire hazard.
29820	31380	This is one story of the gaming world that was.
31380	34380	Join your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki for more on this and the rest of
34380	37780	the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
37780	42340	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42340	43340	Welcome back.
43340	46340	It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46340	54620	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again here with episode number 862 of
54620	59040	our show for this March the 28th of 2021.
59040	64380	My name is Rob Roberts and sadly not joining me tonight, Dark Sakura or Jamie Sommers.
64380	65680	She is not here.
65680	66680	Good news and bad news.
66680	70320	The good news is she got the vaccine yesterday.
70320	71320	She got her first shot.
71320	72740	She got the Pfizer shot.
72740	74440	And so that's great news.
74440	79640	The bad news is she's having some side effects where she's kind of headachy and fatigue.
79640	83940	So she thought it would be best that she sit tonight show tonight's show out.
83940	88680	But again, you know, even though there are side effects to the vaccine, sometimes people
88680	89680	get them.
89680	90680	Sometimes people don't.
90680	95100	We would still always encourage you to get the vaccine and help us end the COVID pandemic
95100	98040	because whatever she's going through right now is certainly a lot better than actually
98040	100060	having COVID itself.
100060	101920	So anyway, say hello as well.
101920	103120	Joining me every week on the show.
103120	104120	Tech master.
104120	105120	Loki.
105120	106120	Hello.
106120	107120	Hi, Loki.
107120	109120	Hey, how's it going?
109120	110120	Good.
110120	111440	What's what's the game playing behind you tonight?
111440	112440	I'm trying to figure it out.
112440	115520	And it's like I can't see the main character very well.
115520	118280	It's like I'm having a hard time telling what it is.
118280	121200	I'm sure if you just looked at the enemies, you'd figure it out.
121200	122460	I can't see the enemies.
122460	123460	They're not showing.
123460	126000	Oh, it's too far away for me to really make them out.
126000	128400	Well, it's entered the Gungeon.
128400	130040	Oh, it is interesting.
130040	131380	OK, nice.
131380	136000	Is that a selection due to the PlayStation, whatever they're calling it?
136000	138880	Stay at home and we'll give you free games thing that's going on right now.
138880	142920	No, it's because I was going to do Katamari because they have the shirt on, but they realized
142920	144000	they'd already done that.
144000	145000	So gotcha.
145000	146240	I'm going to do enter the Gungeon.
146240	149520	Well, that's if he didn't say you'd already done it, nobody probably would have picked
149520	150520	up on it.
150520	151520	So.
151520	152520	All right.
152520	153960	Anyway, I do think it's kind of funny, though.
153960	157560	I know we'd kind of like joked about it on the show previously, but it is kind of interesting
157560	159920	that you got your Johnson and Johnson shot.
159920	165000	I got my Moderna shot and confirmed Jamie got the Pfizer shot this week.
165000	168120	So we have one of each in the house.
168120	169360	The Holy Trinity.
169360	170360	Exactly.
170360	172040	The Holy Trinity is complete.
172040	176240	Anyway, I also want to say a big hello to everybody in our chat room, because we do
176240	181800	tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network
181800	185400	every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby
185400	186760	Blackwell show.
186760	190460	Bobby's in our chat right now saying, oh, man, I totally forgot to remind everyone it's
190460	192200	close to the end of the month.
192200	197040	So check your data cap and download game pass games or the play at home games before the
197040	198480	end of the month.
198480	200080	Very true point.
200080	204040	I know for myself, I want to pre download hopefully I have the bandwidth for it.
204040	205040	I should.
205040	210160	But we're we're cutting it close now that Alan's doing the streaming all the time.
210160	216080	But I want to get the Outriders pre install before it unlocks on the first if I can fit
216080	218960	that into this month's bandwidth, that would be great.
218960	220880	Is that a game that's on your radar at all?
220880	221880	Loki?
221880	222880	No.
222880	224080	Oh, well, that's too bad.
224080	228200	Is there anything anything upcoming that's on your radar?
228200	229200	Not really.
229200	230200	Actually.
230200	238280	Well, you know what's going off the radar is Mario.
238280	241360	And I think this is really funny where the Internet's going with this, because, you know,
241360	245240	this is the week we're just days away from what the Internet is now calling the death
245240	253080	of Mario or Mario's execution, because all of course, Mario 35 is getting pulled.
253080	255760	Super Mario All Stars 3D is getting pulled.
255760	260640	And, you know, all those limited time games are going to disappear as of March 31st, because
260640	265400	Nintendo done told you it's limited and they meant it unless you had a retail code.
265400	267480	Those will still continue to work past March 31st.
267480	271000	Yeah, like, I don't know, I already have them.
271000	272920	So it's fine.
272920	277200	I didn't really play Mario 35 too much, but the other ones already have.
277200	281880	So in fact, we actually picked up because, like I said, my kids were as we mentioned,
281880	286080	I think it was last week we were talking about Shane, the shiny hunter and Pokemon
286080	287080	journeys.
287080	288080	Yes.
288080	290520	So since my kids have been watching that every time they go over to the grandmother's house,
290520	297240	I went ahead and picked up Pokemon sword for my son so he can play through the campaign
297240	300420	that's basically shown off in the the show.
300420	304240	So I'm sure our own shiny Hunter Shane would approve of that purchase.
304240	305240	Yeah.
305240	308680	So yeah, I don't know.
308680	312200	But yeah, the Mario stuff that we've already gotten all all of that.
312200	315240	So it's not a big deal.
315240	316360	It's still stupid, though.
316360	322000	I have to say I was able to hold the line and I never bought Mario 3D All Stars and
322000	323880	I'm totally okay with that decision.
323880	327520	I did play a little bit of Mario 35 and I enjoyed that.
327520	332480	I'm a little less irritated with that one because I can also kind of understand how
332480	335960	the audience for that game was probably going to fade pretty quick.
335960	341640	I think it would soften the blow an awful lot if Nintendo would announce some sort of
341640	343000	replacement.
343000	345640	And I'm not saying it has to be Zelda 35.
345640	352800	But some type of, you know, Nintendo online pass or whatever game to sort of lessen the
352800	358120	burden of or lessen the burn of losing the game that we're losing, I think would would
358120	360400	really make people maybe a lot less angry.
360400	361400	I don't know.
361400	363600	Yeah, I think that would help.
363600	366440	But like, I don't know why they're doing it in the first place.
366440	372760	And then I think it's kind of funny is one of the things that was on there that is limited
372760	380840	or quote unquote limited was that plane watch handheld thing and the local target that I
380840	381840	go to.
381840	387320	They've got like stacks of those really mean they were flying off the shelf at one time,
387320	389740	but now they've got like at least 10 of them.
389740	390880	So interesting.
390880	395080	I always look at him like, nah, I don't want it.
395080	397380	But somebody does and they're out there.
397380	401400	I'm kind of with the break man in chat, ugh, that thing is so overpriced.
401400	404880	Although I did see a comment from Tiger Claw earlier where he ran out and got one.
404880	408760	So again, it's it's all about what do you want to spend your money on?
408760	412080	You know, I buy a lot of these little tiny collectible actually I have one sitting right
412080	413080	here.
413080	416300	I buy a lot of these tiny collectible arcade cabinets and some would say this is a waste
416300	418740	of money, especially when I leave it in the box like this.
418740	419740	But I love these things.
419740	423940	And they're about a third of the price of that Mario Game and Watch thing.
423940	427740	But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tempted by the Mario Game and Watch.
427740	432980	But I suppose Nintendo is going to make that decision for me when they murder Mario on
432980	433980	in just three days.
433980	434980	We are.
434980	435980	We are.
435980	436980	Dawn.
436980	437980	Dawn of the Mario is dead day.
437980	438980	Three.
438980	439980	Seventy two hours remain.
439980	440980	Right.
440980	441980	Yep.
441980	442980	All right.
442980	443980	We're right around the corner.
443980	449060	So if you do want to get them, then you probably should get them or, you know.
449060	450060	I will be.
450060	454900	And look, actually, ironically, I'm wearing a Mario shirt tonight, but I will be taking
454900	456180	it off in three days.
456180	457180	Not on stream.
457180	458260	And we can all be thankful for that.
458260	463020	But I will be taking it off in three days because Mario will be dead.
463020	467180	And so I can't really wear the shirt that I've had for years and years anymore because
467180	473320	Nintendo has decided not only is the year of Mario over, but Mario products must be
473320	477300	over with it because that is that's how we celebrate.
477300	479820	We celebrate with Zelda now.
479820	481220	Is it the year of Zelda?
481220	482220	No, Loki.
482220	483220	It's the year of nothing.
483220	484760	It's the year of silence.
484760	492060	It's the year of another Nintendo Indies announcement, I'm sure, in the coming weeks, which I don't
492060	497940	mean to shade the indie thing, but I'm just saying that, like, Nintendo is, you know,
497940	502580	they'll probably just announce their brand new system and they're going to have those
502580	508260	games be pack-ins or something for that or some ridiculous thing that that actually would
508260	513100	be like, I'd be so irritated, but I would also laugh.
513100	517820	But I think there's a lot more people who would be extremely irritated if come June,
517820	522740	they announce a bundle and they're like, it's the Mario celebration bundle comes with 3D
522740	524700	all stars installed on the system.
524700	527460	No, it would be like, yeah, what was it?
527460	528940	The one that they?
528940	529940	Yeah.
530660	534180	Did he ever like add, um, what was it?
534180	536860	It was, um, galaxy two.
536860	538540	Was that ever like DLC or anything?
538540	539540	I can't remember.
539540	540540	I don't think it was.
540540	541540	No, I got that.
541540	542540	No.
542540	543540	Yeah.
543540	544540	No.
544540	546340	Nintendo has thrown galaxy two in the trash game of the year.
546340	548620	Galaxy two is in the dumpster out back in Redmond.
548620	549620	Right?
549620	550620	Yeah.
550620	553300	So yeah, I could see them doing something stupid like that.
553300	554420	Re-releasing it again.
554420	555420	I don't know.
556420	559900	It's just funny because they can't manage their supply chain as it is.
559900	564260	And now they're like not managing their digital supply chain, which really doesn't exist.
564260	568140	I mean, it's infinite, but somehow it's not.
568140	569140	I know.
569140	572420	It's very interesting because Nintendo has a lot of problems with their physical supply
572420	573420	chain.
573420	576100	So clearly the answer is to limit their digital supply.
576100	579500	I don't understand how they think that it's going to like devalue those things because
579500	580980	like all their games never go on.
580980	583000	I mean, like they hardly ever go on sale.
583000	587160	It's frustrating because like some of the stuff that's out there, it really should go
587160	588160	on sale.
588160	594080	Like, like Mario tennis doesn't need to be a $60 game several years after it's come out.
594080	597200	I mean, like it, it can drop in price.
597200	598600	It's fine.
598600	603240	It's just, they demand $60 for their games forever.
603240	606400	And no, no, thank you.
606400	607920	I'm curious.
607920	609920	I'm curious.
609920	611000	I'm curious in chat.
611000	614680	How would you guys feel, cause some of you did, I only want to hear from the people that
614680	618840	purchased Mario all stars of which there are several of you.
618840	626280	How would you feel if Nintendo this June confirms this super Nintendo switch, whatever you want
626280	628240	to call it, the 4k switch, whatever.
628240	630040	It's all a rumor anyway.
630040	636880	And as part, one of the launch titles for the switch is going to be a 4k version of
636880	640120	Mario 3d all stars with galaxy two.
640120	641720	How would you feel about that?
641720	646460	Would you be happy because yay, Mario's back from the dead or would you be pissed off because
646460	650880	I spent $60 on what I'd be, I'd, I'd be curious.
650880	651880	Okay.
651880	652880	I'm looking in chat.
652880	655080	Sacred Jade says I'd still buy it.
655080	656080	Okay.
656080	657080	We'll see.
657080	658320	I'm waiting for other comments to come in here.
658320	661560	It's the, there's a little bit of a delay between the time we say things and the time
661560	663400	our chat room sees them there.
663400	666120	So a pixel pockets in chat.
666120	667920	I love the honest answer.
667920	674880	Pixel pockets and Chad says I would buy it and feel like a clown, especially like right
674880	682120	after like, there is a clown Mario turned around and just like re-released it.
682120	686000	Not even like six months after it's like, Oh, we, we, we took it off the market, but
686000	688500	now we took it, put, brought it back.
688500	691280	Like I don't see the point.
691280	692840	I don't get why it's limited.
692840	697160	Like the Mario 35 understand because you know, network resources and stuff like that.
697160	703880	But a game you've literally produced, why are you not offering that anymore?
703880	705320	Like that is stupid.
705320	708640	Like you could do like limited time DLC or something like that.
708640	709640	Like they did with smash brothers.
709640	715060	Hey, we're going to throw in this piece of deals that you get a free piranha plant character.
715060	720000	If you purchase it within the first, you know, month or so, like that makes sense, but just
720000	722480	like, Oh, well, you didn't buy it within the timeframe.
722480	724360	Well, we're just going to take it off the market.
724360	729560	You should have bought it because you know, you belong to our Nintendo cult.
729560	731380	You buy all the things like that.
731380	732380	It's stupid.
732380	737080	Like it's absolutely stupid, especially like, like, let's just look at COVID and stuff.
737080	740800	Like not everybody has like a lot of resources to buy these games and what if someone actually
740800	745560	wanted to buy one, but they're waiting to get their tax refund back or something like
745560	746560	that.
746560	747560	It's like, Oh, sorry.
747560	748560	Too late.
748560	749560	Too late for that.
749560	750560	You know, I have this.
750560	751560	Yeah.
751560	752560	Nintendo doesn't accept stimulus money.
752920	754600	They only accept tax refunds.
754600	755600	I don't get it.
755600	756600	Whatever.
756600	757600	You know what?
757600	758600	It's fine.
758600	764640	I, they can make their own business decisions, I guess, but like I don't get it.
764640	767520	I don't understand the, the basis of it.
767520	768520	I don't either.
768520	773640	Um, uh, some other comments in chat, it seems like generally across the board, people are
773640	779600	like, I hate it, but I'd still buy it, which is, I'm not dragging anyone, but this is,
779640	782880	this is the way many gamers approach Nintendo.
782880	785520	I hate it, but I buy it.
785520	789320	They know that like, they're all, what are you going to do about it?
789320	790320	Hmm.
790320	791320	All right.
791320	793020	You know, we can do whatever we want.
793020	795320	You don't like the decision, but you're still going to do it anyways.
795320	796320	You're still going to buy it.
796320	797320	No, I'm not.
797320	798320	Loki.
798320	799320	I did it.
799320	800320	I did it.
800320	801320	Loki.
801320	802320	I stuck with my decision.
802320	803320	I want a star.
803320	804320	Yeah.
804320	805320	But you're, you're one person in the majority.
805320	806320	No.
806320	807320	SSJ 100.
807320	808320	Matt did it too.
808320	809320	We are two people.
810040	811040	All right.
811040	812040	All right.
812040	813040	Well, I guess, I guess that's it.
813040	814040	Game over.
814040	815040	I fucking showed them.
815040	816040	Didn't I?
816040	817040	All right.
817040	824720	SSJ 100, SSJ 100, Matt and I exist in a secret cult and we meet biweekly on Saturdays and
824720	828800	in our cult, we believe that Mario is still alive.
828800	833400	Even though Nintendo has killed him, Mario is secretly alive and he's living on an island
833400	835400	in the Bahamas.
835400	837260	And he's, he's a okay.
837260	838440	So that's where we're at.
838560	845480	They're just going to sell the collection as NFTs in like April, so that's fine.
845480	846480	I hate it.
846480	847480	All right.
847480	849380	Now I really want to change the topic.
849380	851120	Let's get to our kickoff topic tonight.
851120	855640	I don't know if you think that was it, but no, we just went off on something else.
855640	858780	Uh, Loki, what do we really want to talk about at the start of tonight's show?
858780	862200	So let's talk about the significant change coming to Xbox live.
862200	864160	I mean, I'm sorry, Xbox network.
864160	865160	That's it.
865160	866160	That's the change.
866160	867380	They're just changing the name.
867380	869420	So Xbox live, it's gone.
869420	873780	It's gone like Mario and it's going to be now Xbox network.
873780	875280	So maybe that's what's happening.
875280	878300	Maybe Mario is getting a brand new name and so it's no longer Mario.
878300	882620	It's going to be, um, you know, he's going to assign himself a new name.
882620	884940	He'll be a mark now.
884940	886220	Look here.
886220	890820	I just, I really quit cause I'm getting dragged in chat because a tiger claw on chat says
890820	894500	knowing Rob, he'll buy that legendary edition of the mass effect trilogy.
894500	897580	And Bobby Black Wolf says it's Mario, not mass effect.
897580	902700	Um, look, I'm allowed to be a hypocrite on my own show if I want to be, uh, and to quote
902700	906540	RuPaul from this week's episode of drag race, and I apologize to the podcast listeners.
906540	910060	He's not going to be able to hear this one, but if you saw the episode, you'll know what
910060	916200	I'm talking about anyway for you listeners to quote RuPaul's drag race this week.
916200	917200	Thank you.
917200	918500	All right, go ahead.
918500	919500	Loki.
919500	920500	All right.
920500	921500	So anyways.
921500	926980	Um, so yeah, so the rebranding basically, uh, they're saying that Xbox network is going
926980	933180	to be, what's going to be referred to as now, uh, refers the underlying Xbox online services,
933180	939740	uh, which was updated in the Microsoft service agreement and the update from Xbox live to
939740	947500	Xbox network is intended to distinguish the underlying services from Xbox live gold memberships.
947500	948500	That cool.
948500	951220	You change, you're calling it something else.
951220	955540	Um, other than that, it doesn't seem to be changing much of anything.
955540	958080	So that's it.
958080	961620	It's just called something different now.
961620	967980	And Xbox network, I mean, I guess, I don't know, it doesn't have the same ring to it,
967980	970540	but cool.
970540	974560	It really doesn't have the same ring as Xbox live.
974560	976580	Like Xbox live was kind of catchy.
976580	981940	Um, I, it is, I don't know, to me, this kind of strikes me as like, what an interesting
981940	983860	time to make a pivot.
983860	987180	I would have thought that if they were going to be rebranding an Xbox network, they might
987180	992160	kind of do that as they're launching a new console, but it's also kind of one of those
992160	993860	why now sorts of things.
993860	999540	But I also sort of like get it based on the fact that, you know, Microsoft has set this
999540	1005660	goal for themselves where they are not necessarily a device in your living room, but they are
1005700	1011340	a platform, they are a, you know, play, they are a, um, delivery service for games.
1011340	1014940	Uh, and you know, games pass is really your game passes, you mean is really where they're
1014940	1016800	putting a lot of their investment.
1016800	1021980	So I think to maybe rebrand as Xbox network kind of separates them from being something
1021980	1026940	that is, you know, traditionally been a very console centric thing because obviously Xbox
1026940	1032000	is something that, um, we are seeing on PCs as well.
1032000	1039860	And we even see it on PlayStation and Nintendo switch what log into Minecraft with your Xbox
1039860	1041640	network account.
1041640	1047200	It's probably because see, the reason they've got a rebranded text box network is because
1047200	1051540	the next console that the release to keep in line with the confusion of their naming
1051540	1055440	scheme is they'll just call the next console, the Xbox live.
1055440	1061120	And then they'll just kind of, you know, cap off the confusing console series that they've
1061120	1063480	had so far with their naming.
1063480	1066280	So maybe that's what it's about.
1066280	1071800	I can also see though, where, you know, maybe Microsoft is ready to distance themselves
1071800	1075480	with some of the reputation that Xbox live has had in the past.
1075480	1080440	Um, because I think we all have a horror story about playing a game on Xbox live and getting
1080440	1084400	called all sorts of names that are disgusting, and I'm not going to repeat them here on this
1084400	1088080	lovely program that we have, uh, especially on a Sunday.
1088080	1092960	Um, but maybe Microsoft wants to separate from that a little bit.
1092960	1095920	Although I completely understand.
1095920	1098880	I mean, look at, look at how well that worked out for Comcast.
1098880	1102640	I mean, Xfinity that that worked out so perfect, you know, they changed names.
1102640	1108880	It's like, yeah, that Comcast man, they sucked, but Xfinity, they still suck under a different
1108880	1109880	name.
1109880	1110880	Oh yeah.
1110880	1111880	Netflix going to Quickster.
1111880	1112880	No problem.
1112880	1114880	Everybody will embrace it.
1114880	1115880	Quickster.
1115880	1122880	Okay, but Quickster sounds like, you know, the flea market equivalent of the flash, which
1122880	1128200	is like what you order on wish when you order the flash version of the flash.
1128200	1129200	Well, what's funny.
1129200	1130200	Okay.
1130200	1134000	But what's funny about that whole Quickster scenario is that fucking Netflix did it anyway.
1134000	1136080	They just did it a year later and didn't call it.
1136080	1140120	They ended up what they sold it to dvd.com and I think, I think it's even called like
1140120	1141720	DVD flicks now.
1141720	1146320	Then there was an article I saw just this week about how the service sucks compared
1146320	1147600	to what it used to be.
1147600	1150900	Like they used to have over like 10,000 DVDs on the service and now there's not nearly
1150900	1151900	as many.
1151900	1156720	And for people that are super into like cult films, foreign films, old films, the really
1156720	1163540	hard to find shit that never made its way to Blu-ray still, or digital still, it kind
1163540	1166800	of sucks that that's fading because that was the audience that was still using that because
1166800	1169600	you could find almost anything on that service.
1169600	1173600	So it's just, just kind of interesting.
1173600	1176920	Anyway, this wasn't supposed to be about Netflix, supposed to be about Xbox live changing their
1176920	1182440	name and, and why now to change their name and will they be able to get away because
1182440	1187120	I think I was just having a call with Bobby earlier tonight on his show and I think I
1187120	1189100	still called it Xbox live.
1189100	1191940	So I think this is going to take a little bit of time before we kind of get that name
1191940	1192940	out of our mouths.
1192940	1193940	I don't know.
1193940	1198300	So what is Xbox live gold turn into Xbox network gold?
1198840	1199840	What's the plan there?
1199840	1201620	I think it's still going to be Xbox live.
1201620	1207700	It's just live gold doesn't make any sense now because there really isn't anything else.
1207700	1209620	You don't have live silver anymore.
1209620	1210620	It's just.
1210620	1214780	Well, and when are they going to just, and when are they just going to get rid of gold?
1214780	1216600	I've been saying this for a long time.
1216600	1218160	Like what do you, what do you get with gold?
1218160	1222420	You get the free games and the ability to play online, although they're starting to
1222420	1227500	dial that back because they were finally bullied into it by their user base.
1227500	1233300	And honestly, I, I, I get it because you know, the PlayStation wasn't charging online.
1233300	1235920	Windows store PC wasn't charging online.
1235920	1240540	And so for things like Fortnite and that stuff, so, um, you know, Microsoft has finally retreated
1240540	1243280	from that at least for the free to play games.
1243280	1246140	Although if you want to play, I don't know, Gears or whatever online, you're still going
1246140	1249500	to have to pay for the Xbox gold or shit.
1249500	1256420	I've been playing a lot of dead by daylight lately on, uh, Xbox series X and I have Xbox
1256420	1261300	gold thankfully, so I can still play online with strangers and get teabagged at the exit
1261300	1262300	doors.
1262300	1266540	So, yeah, I, I don't know why they still charge for that, especially on the console.
1266540	1267780	That doesn't make any sense too.
1267780	1273740	When you have like a lot of the, they've made, I don't know really why I got an Xbox series
1273740	1279460	X when you think about it, because they make a hard sell for, you know, buying their console
1279460	1280460	in the first place.
1280460	1282680	They're most of their games are available on PC as well.
1282680	1285020	And most people have a pretty decent PC.
1285860	1289100	You don't have to pay for the same online service there.
1289100	1295500	And it's just, there's less exclusives that are like specifically console exclusives.
1295500	1298100	They're always going to be console and PC.
1298100	1303500	And so it's just, it's like, they're like promoting not to buy their console.
1303500	1304860	It doesn't make any sense.
1304860	1307800	I just really wish they would get rid of that, but I get it.
1307800	1312120	It's an income, it's a revenue stream, but it's just not something that they can charge
1312120	1317200	on PC because people will be like, no, I'm just going to buy it from Steam or the Epic
1317200	1318200	Games store.
1318200	1319200	Yeah.
1319200	1325960	I'm just, I'm not really just a big fan in general of, uh, uh, the, the, uh, that's my
1325960	1326960	train of thought.
1326960	1327960	Damn it.
1327960	1331400	The, um, I was trying to reach out at the same time and I told her, I lost my train
1331400	1332400	of thought.
1332400	1333400	Anyway, go ahead.
1333400	1339280	But yeah, I mean, it's just, I don't know.
1339280	1341840	I don't see the point of charging for it.
1341840	1345480	I think it would be, you know, if they did want to charge for it and just like roll it
1345480	1351080	into games pass and let that be its thing, let just sell games pass, get rid of the Xbox
1351080	1353200	live gold and then have that.
1353200	1356880	And then, you know, branch that out to other platforms as well.
1356880	1361220	And I think you have a winning service there, but we're just not there yet.
1361220	1362220	I think.
1362220	1365220	Um, I will say that I enjoy my Xbox series X.
1365220	1367320	I don't regret that purchase in the slightest.
1367320	1370520	The performance is so much better than the prior, you know, console.
1370520	1373560	It really does feel like an upgrade and I really enjoy playing games in the living
1373560	1374560	room.
1374560	1378680	Um, but that's, you know, that also is just probably like my type of lifestyle.
1378680	1382200	I imagine Loki, when you try to play games in the living room, you get distracted a lot
1382200	1388240	by, you know, the kids, the wife, I have to, it's hooked up to my, my monitors here.
1388240	1389840	So it's basically like playing on PC.
1389840	1390840	Oh, okay.
1390840	1394360	See, but then that makes sense where it's like, well, why bother?
1394360	1399880	So, but for me, I like to get out of my office and plot my big butt on the couch and, you
1399880	1401920	know, play a game in there.
1401920	1405600	Um, although now I'm having this whole thing where I'm like, as much as I've invested in
1405600	1410840	Dead by Daylight to this point, I'm like, maybe I should get it on PC.
1410840	1411840	That might be fun.
1411840	1413320	I don't know.
1413320	1417520	But then I'll just get dragged by chat all over again for buying multiple copies of the
1417520	1418520	same game.
1418520	1422800	Does that, does the DLC port over to like, say if you buy that through the window store
1422800	1423800	or something like that?
1423800	1424800	No.
1424800	1426760	And it's so well, okay.
1426760	1428200	Yes and no.
1428200	1437760	Steam, the Switch and one other, oh, Stadia, Steam, the Switch and Stadia all cross by.
1437760	1442520	So if you buy DLC L1, you get it on those others within that area, but all the rest,
1442520	1443520	no.
1443520	1449420	And I think it is stupid that it's not cross by between window store and Xbox.
1449420	1450420	Why is that?
1450420	1451420	It makes no sense.
1451420	1452420	It is.
1452420	1453420	So that makes no sense to me.
1453420	1457160	It's one of my big complaints about that game, to be honest.
1457160	1464480	So anyway, Xbox Live, now Xbox Network, we'll see how long it takes us to really adapt to
1464480	1469880	that change name and see, I guess in June, maybe we'll really start to see some of the
1469880	1473040	marketing behind that, whether there's an E3 or not.
1473040	1477120	I imagine we're going to still start to see some of the push behind, you know, what Microsoft
1477120	1481000	really plans to do with that branding and how they're going to propel it forward, which
1481000	1484600	I imagine will have a lot to do with cloud gaming.
1484600	1488680	I expect a lot with cloud gaming to come out of Microsoft this June, but that is, I'm
1488680	1489680	not going to lie.
1489680	1490680	That is exciting.
1490680	1491680	So, yeah.
1491680	1493000	All right.
1493000	1496880	Let's move on and get into how was your gaming week and the types of games that you've been
1496880	1497880	playing this week.
1497880	1499920	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1499920	1501840	It's going to sound like a broken record.
1501840	1502840	It's been the same stuff.
1502840	1508240	So basically you've been playing Minecraft, still watching lots of streamers.
1508240	1515000	I've gone through several different Hermitcraft streamers and just watching their content,
1515000	1519160	but I've been also working on this giant tree that's on our realm.
1519160	1522240	And so working on that, it's very tedious.
1522240	1528620	I can see why the guy, Iskall, who does that actually in Hermitcraft takes many breaks
1528620	1532420	from it because it gets very tedious and boring.
1532420	1535120	So that's what I've been doing in Minecraft.
1535120	1541700	I have been playing more Orna as well and then also working on the special edition Pixel
1541700	1542700	Poops 2.
1542700	1549560	So I've put together like six new levels so far and I've got four more at least I've planned
1549560	1552520	out because I wanted to bump each world up to 10.
1552520	1557640	And then I've been trying to just polish some of the code that's in there to try to get
1557640	1559800	it to work how I wanted it to.
1559800	1562320	And I may add another whole world to it.
1562320	1564160	I haven't decided yet.
1564200	1569440	The problem is I'm like running out of like unique enemies or like things I can do with
1569440	1571280	since they don't really have a way.
1571280	1573140	There's no projectiles or anything in the game.
1573140	1579200	So it's hard to like make like a boss or like, you know, just different enemy types.
1579200	1585200	It's just aside from reskinning something that's basically it all I can really do with
1585200	1586200	it.
1586200	1590760	So I had thought about I had originally planned because I took two days off this week.
1591400	1596000	I had originally planned on splitting the sound engine to be able to allow for more
1596000	1597000	music.
1597000	1601720	But then I thought about it and it's like, well, I've already like dumped like X number
1601720	1605080	of dollars into the music itself.
1605080	1609000	And I clearly am not going to make that back.
1609000	1610000	Clearly so.
1610000	1613480	I was like, does it make sense to just dump more into it?
1613480	1615160	I'm like, no, it doesn't.
1615160	1618800	So that kind of got nixed.
1619760	1626280	And also the guy that like, you know, cosmic gem, you know, great music, but man, he can
1626280	1628400	he can take a while to get stuff done.
1628400	1635200	And so I didn't want to just like commission more music and have it take like several months.
1635200	1637280	So I just didn't want to get in that scenario again.
1637280	1639480	I just want to kind of be done with this.
1639480	1642960	So I am at the very least going to have 10 more levels in there total.
1642960	1646000	So I've gotten six of the 10.
1646000	1648760	Probably get the other four done maybe tonight or so.
1648760	1653680	And then I've already added like another like there you can play as female characters now.
1653680	1657280	So that was something I added like several weeks ago.
1657280	1659200	So there's that.
1659200	1665200	And I am going to change up the the continue.
1665200	1667800	I guess it's not respawning, but like continuing.
1667800	1670840	So instead of continuing at the beginning of a world, it'll just be the level you died
1670840	1675060	on, which I think is more fair, although it makes the game easier.
1675060	1680420	I may try to throw a hardcore mode in there to make it harder to increase the rate of
1680420	1683740	spawning, which would be easy enough to do.
1683740	1687460	So there's stuff like that and maybe an integrated manual as well.
1687460	1690260	So that is just some of the stuff I was working on for that.
1690260	1692060	But at the very least, I have levels done.
1692060	1693300	So that's kind of cool.
1693300	1697780	But yeah, that is basically what this week's been.
1697780	1699780	Be sure to check that out.
1699780	1701460	Listeners help Loki make some of his money back.
1701460	1703220	He spent on the music.
1703220	1708320	That's Pixel Poops number two on itch.io or also available on Steam with Pixel Poops
1708320	1709320	as DLC.
1709320	1710320	So check that out.
1710320	1711320	Yeah.
1711320	1717180	And there's this other website that the folks behind Nesbaker are working on as well, that
1717180	1721160	once they get it completed, it'll be nice to share it with you because they have a really
1721160	1722160	cool integrated.
1722160	1725180	It's almost like a Steam workshop for NES ROMs.
1725180	1726420	So it's pretty cool.
1726420	1732740	And they actually have one of the things that's coming with that is eventually like if I publish
1732740	1736960	a game, they could actually take care of making the physical versions.
1736960	1740100	So they pay you like a flat fee or whatever you want to charge for it.
1740100	1744380	And then they manufacture and ship it out for you, which would be ideal.
1744380	1749740	So in the future, that's like so early in development right now for that.
1749740	1753100	But like that is something cool that's coming down the pipeline.
1753100	1754100	All right.
1754100	1755100	Very cool.
1755100	1759100	My gaming week, honestly, kind of like Loki, a lot of the same stuff.
1759100	1762060	I've been continuing my adventures in Final Fantasy 14.
1762060	1765380	I fell off the Orna Wagon several weeks ago, though I haven't really been playing a lot
1765380	1766380	of that.
1766380	1771100	Yeah, I noticed that there's not been people like starting, you know, the kingdom battles
1771100	1772100	and stuff.
1772100	1774000	I'm like, I don't know how to operate the bot.
1774000	1776060	So I don't think I can do that.
1776060	1778340	Everybody should have the ability to do it now.
1778340	1780740	If you don't, just yell at me and I'll.
1780740	1784500	Well, I know how to do I know how to start a new kingdom battle, but I don't know how
1784500	1786500	to operate the bot.
1786500	1789580	Oh, you just so that's why I haven't been doing it otherwise.
1790220	1792580	War and however much time is left.
1792580	1796220	Just scroll up and see what other people type to say, like a template.
1796220	1797220	Let's see.
1797220	1799660	So otherwise, I have been playing more Pokemon Go.
1799660	1804500	I almost have hit the experience I need for level 44, finally.
1804500	1808160	But it's just the all the PvP battles I have to do is holding me back.
1808160	1812420	So I'm probably going to be gated behind that by the time I have the XP for 44.
1812420	1813420	But that's OK.
1813420	1817980	It'll be it'll be by the time I get the XP for 45 when I really start to get irritated
1817980	1818980	on that.
1819220	1821980	I'm still playing a little bit of Ingress, allowing that to motivate a lot of my walking
1821980	1826380	that I've been trying to do more of because I gained too much weight through this pandemic
1826380	1827380	process.
1827380	1831620	So I'm trying to be a little more physically active to try to lose some of that before
1831620	1835060	some of these in-person conventions start coming back.
1835060	1838940	I've also been playing Dead by Daylight, as I mentioned, a couple of weeks on the show.
1838940	1842740	I finally kind of started getting into that last week on the show.
1842740	1846880	I'm sad she's not here to hear this, but Jamie and I had a follow up conversation and she
1846880	1850500	was very adamant that I start playing Freddy Krueger as killer.
1850500	1854600	And you might remember she actually Apple paid me five bucks so I could get the DLC
1854600	1855600	for Freddy Krueger.
1855600	1859620	Well, I actually paid seven bucks because I just got the little combo pack that has
1859620	1864040	him and the survivor and whatever other Friday 13th crap came with it.
1864040	1865040	And I got that.
1865040	1866040	And so I've been playing.
1866040	1868820	I did play my first game with Freddy as the killer.
1868820	1871320	And I got to say, he's really fucking fun.
1871320	1876560	He's such a bitch, like he's such a little bitch to be playing against.
1876560	1881840	I know survivors have got to hate him, but the whole like fact that they can't even really
1881840	1885880	see you coming until you're already there, unless they're in the dream world is a pretty
1885880	1886960	nasty mechanic.
1886960	1889460	And I love being able to port to the generators.
1889460	1890460	It's great.
1890460	1893200	He's such a little jerk and I love his talent.
1893200	1896920	One of them, he can actually shut the exit doors once they've been opened.
1896920	1901120	As long as he hooks somebody, then the exit doors get shut for like 40 seconds and people
1901120	1904260	will try to run out thinking they can escape and psych.
1904260	1907940	So all those people that try to teabag you at the exit get fucked.
1907940	1915260	And it's awesome because I don't like killing anyone more than those people who teabag me
1915260	1917260	at the exit.
1917260	1921060	Zenmonkey11 in chat says, I always play as Freddy, but I don't think he's good for new
1921060	1922060	players.
1922060	1923060	I don't know.
1923060	1925020	Maybe it's because I like watched other streams.
1925020	1928140	I figured it out pretty quick.
1928140	1931020	It's just setting those traps and kind of knowing where to set them.
1931020	1934860	Although Pyramid Head has a very similar mechanic and that's who I was playing.
1934860	1937380	And then, which I need to do some with the pallets.
1937380	1942180	I fucking love that you can do fake pallets on top of all that.
1942180	1945420	And just kind of, you know, being able to use the blood porting to your advantage where
1945420	1949320	you can actually port to a gen on the other side of the map to more effectively patrol
1949320	1950960	or fake them out.
1950960	1955660	Like if you're, if you're going to be like near a gen, you start to blood port to that
1955660	1959020	gen and watch everybody run out and then get him as they're running out.
1959020	1963740	He's a nasty little shit trickster and that's why he's really fun to play.
1963740	1966400	So yeah, so I've been enjoying Freddy.
1966400	1971200	He's like my second highest leveled killer now next to Pyramid Head.
1971200	1974360	So I will have to, I texted Jamie and let her know, but I'll have to let her know more
1974360	1977660	about that later on.
1977660	1982100	So and Zenmonkey11 in chat says, Freddy in the Stranger Things lab is awesome.
1982100	1985500	Oh, I bet the traps are so effective there in the narrow quarters.
1985500	1989860	I hate that map though, but I can see where, cause Pyramid Head's trenches are very effective,
1989860	1991880	which again is a very similar mechanic.
1991880	1994140	So yeah, Dead by Daylight, still playing more of that.
1994140	1998900	I also played Octopath Traveler on Xbox cause it's with Game Pass.
1998900	2003020	So I played a little bit of that and it hasn't really changed from the Switch.
2003020	2006460	So there's really not a lot to add, but it was nice to kind of play that again and there's
2006460	2008180	a ton of achievements.
2008180	2010720	You get achievements for doing every little thing in that game.
2010720	2012300	So that's kind of fun.
2012300	2019180	I also played, this isn't really a full game, but you know, you know how Shane is my friend
2019180	2024300	and you know, he has a reputation here on Orange Silence Radio, being able to talk people
2024300	2029640	into buying and playing whatever game he wants you to be able to play.
2029640	2033640	And one of the series he's really into right now is Monster Hunter.
2033640	2036860	And so he's really trying to get me into Monster Hunter.
2036860	2041540	And you know, I guess I could have downloaded the one on Game Pass cause Monster Hunter
2041540	2044740	World, I think is on Game Pass, but he was like, no, they've done so many quality of
2044740	2046740	life things in Rise.
2046740	2049520	Just download that Monster Hunter Rise demo for the Switch.
2049520	2055140	So I did, and I have to say the demo was a lot better than the Wii U Monster Hunter demo
2055140	2059900	because it actually told you what to do and actually set you up and educated you on how
2059900	2061140	to play the game.
2061140	2066340	So I will give Rise credit in that department, but at the end of the day, unfortunately,
2066340	2069860	I think I just don't enjoy Monster Hunter.
2070100	2073200	And I think it's, and I know a lot of you do, so I'm sorry, and I'm not saying it's
2073200	2074500	a bad game.
2074500	2076280	It's just not for me.
2076280	2077740	And it's the combat.
2077740	2079900	It's so I can't get into the combat.
2079900	2084920	Like I was doing the little tutorial thing and I'm like, oh, I swung my sword, gigantic
2084920	2089880	sword and it took like two minutes and I missed and oh, I swung my big sword and I think I
2089880	2091440	hit this one, but you know what?
2091440	2097560	My dog pal and my cat pal already killed them because I'm so slow and bad that my dog and
2097560	2101960	cat pal, which I do love that there are dog and cat friends, but they already killed them.
2101960	2106200	And I tried to do another quest and it was just, I just, I can't get into it.
2106200	2107200	I'm sorry.
2107200	2110320	Anyway, I'm looking in chat.
2110320	2112360	Quest Buster says, not every game is for everyone.
2112360	2113360	It's okay.
2113360	2117160	I know, I know, but I know so many of you are fans of the series and I don't want to
2117160	2119560	sound like I'm talking negative on it.
2119560	2123640	It did seem really pretty, the map, there seemed to be a lot of area to explore and
2123640	2126480	all that, but I just can't get into the combat.
2126480	2131880	I just, and I think that's where it's just a, no, thank you for me.
2131880	2132880	Yeah.
2132880	2136520	Bobby Blackall says it's not a Nino Cooney, certainly not.
2136520	2140060	And Bobby says, yeah, they did a much better job with the demo and act deft and chat says
2140060	2143800	the same goes for me, Rob, after five to six installments of Monster Hunter, I finally
2143800	2144800	gave up.
2144800	2145800	The game is not for me.
2145800	2149200	Oh, Shane is in chat saying Monster Hunter is like deadly Pokemon.
2149200	2153600	I'm excited every time I see a new monster, but then I'm excited to murder it.
2153600	2155700	Mission chat says you're not talking negative.
2155700	2156700	You're just not into it.
2156700	2157700	And that's okay.
2157700	2158700	Exactly.
2158700	2162600	But you know, what's funny is you'll never know when I suddenly change my mind and I
2162600	2164520	reserve the right to change my mind.
2164520	2168400	I wasn't really into Mass Effect when I first played it, but I ended up changing my mind
2168400	2170360	pretty big, didn't I?
2170360	2172620	Here's the other one that shocks me.
2172620	2173620	The horror thing.
2173620	2175320	I'm not super into horror games.
2175320	2178600	Well, I guess I'm always like Silent Hill, like psychological games, but I've never really
2178600	2180640	been into like jump scare horror type of games.
2180680	2185480	I don't really love horror movies the way a lot of my friends do and so forth, which
2185480	2190480	I know is ironic because I work with the SAC horror film festival and even the producer
2190480	2192600	knows, I'm not as into it as everyone else is.
2192600	2194600	I'll do, I'll do a kick ass job hosting.
2194600	2195920	I'm just not as into it.
2195920	2202120	I love cult movies and that's why I'm there because horror and cult are very closely aligned.
2202120	2207000	But my point is yet here I am five years after it came out, finally getting into Dead by
2207000	2208000	Daylight.
2208000	2213320	And finally just, oh, something finally clicked for me in this game and I'm into it now.
2213320	2215960	And maybe that will happen with Monster Hunter someday.
2215960	2219500	Maybe there will be just the right class that I discover where it's like, oh, this one doesn't
2219500	2220500	play like molasses.
2220500	2223680	I can, you know, get into this.
2223680	2225640	But today is not that day.
2225640	2226640	There is that.
2226640	2230160	So Shane even says in chat, I didn't like Monster Hunter until World.
2230160	2234020	It took the changes they made in World for me to have fun and now it's even better.
2234020	2237060	So it took years for me to be a fan.
2237060	2241580	And Quest Buster says, I wasn't into Pokemon until I finally sat down with Pokemon Sword
2241580	2243680	and found myself really enjoying it.
2243680	2247540	And talk about a series that Shane has really been trying to get me into for a long time.
2247540	2249440	Yeah, the Pokemon games.
2249440	2252460	I mean, I've always enjoyed them enough.
2252460	2256100	I'll get through like a couple gyms in each of the mainline games and I'll kind of put
2256100	2257100	it aside.
2257100	2263000	But it wasn't until Pokemon Shield and that whole concept of you don't have to feel like
2263000	2267260	you're missing Pokemon if you don't catch them all in a certain area because you have
2267260	2272000	this gigantic, wild area waiting for you that you can explore in postgame and all this stuff.
2272000	2273000	So just focus on it.
2273000	2277340	Like the way Shield kind of framed it so much differently really worked for me.
2277340	2281500	And it was the first Pokemon game I actually played to completion.
2281500	2286220	And actually, as for those of you following the show, I even completed my stupid Pokedex
2286220	2287220	a couple months ago.
2287220	2290500	Now I just have to work on the DLC, but we'll see.
2290500	2292380	All right.
2292380	2296020	So that's that with all that stuff.
2296020	2298920	Speaking of Pokemon, before I get to the next story.
2298920	2300940	So a little bit of a housekeeping note.
2300940	2305820	This week here at the Voice of Geeks Network, Bobby Blackwolf gave us our first channel
2305820	2308820	point reward night.
2308820	2314220	And basically what happened, those of you that do watch our show live over on Twitch,
2314220	2318900	every so often we will have a channel reward thing that you can fundraise for.
2318900	2323760	It's not actual money for these fundraisers, but they're the points that you earn as you
2323760	2325280	watch VOG content.
2325280	2328020	You get 10 points every few minutes that you're watching.
2328020	2329860	I think if you're subbed, you get 12.
2329860	2333540	Well, you can actually chip in points towards a bonus stream when we open that up.
2333540	2339860	So Bobby did the first one this week and he did some old VHS footage of things he shot
2339860	2341520	in the 90s.
2341520	2345820	Some promos that he had VHS copies of, and some of them were wild, let me tell you.
2345860	2352460	I didn't see all of it because I instead saw a really, really bad car accident as I was
2352460	2354740	doing a Pokewalk that same day.
2354740	2357920	And I got stuck there because they had to move everything out of the way for the cars
2357920	2359080	to get out of the parking lot.
2359080	2363660	But anyway, I did get to see the E3 footage that he shot on camera.
2363660	2365740	And a lot of that was really funny and really good.
2365740	2368820	And I guess for wrestling fans, there's a pretty epic thing in there.
2368820	2371340	So yeah, he did a great stream of that.
2371340	2374780	So we've been promising for a bit the second stream we're going to do, because I got him
2374780	2377540	to say he would do it when he was here on the show a couple weeks ago.
2377540	2383620	We're going to do Shane's Definitive Pokemon Ranking, and we'll see how good he is at influencing
2383620	2385500	folks on his decisions.
2385500	2390940	So that will be coming up if you guys can raise enough points, which I think you will.
2390940	2397720	I think you have four weeks to raise 100,000 points, and we already have 38,000 as of tonight.
2397720	2399240	So there's that.
2399240	2403500	If you're not able to be here live, if you're a subscriber here at the Voice of Geeks Network,
2403500	2405100	you can always watch it on demand.
2405100	2407520	We're trying to create more benefit for our subscribers.
2407520	2411280	That's really what it is, because so many of you have been so generous with your subscriptions
2411280	2414940	and the gift subscriptions, especially a lot of that, that we want to make sure there is
2414940	2418620	more content than just the Sunday night shows, the other shows we host.
2418620	2421100	We want you to have more content to dive into.
2421100	2424500	So if you missed what Bobby did earlier this week, hey, guess what, subscribers, you can
2424500	2426720	go watch that on demand anytime.
2426720	2433140	Make sure you see the part with the Charles Martinet voiced Mario animatronic in 98.
2433140	2434140	It's great.
2434140	2440420	And Bobby was so, so like, like dying on camera because he couldn't believe we were watching
2440420	2441420	it.
2441420	2442420	It was great.
2442420	2443420	So check that.
2443420	2444420	Check that out.
2444420	2447660	But we will be doing Shane's definitive Pokemon ranking at some point in April, assuming we
2447660	2449940	raised the points for it, which I think we will.
2449940	2451820	So be sure to collect those points.
2451820	2452820	All right.
2452820	2454740	I think that's it for the housekeeping.
2454740	2459500	Let's get into some more news and we're going to start off with Loki.
2459500	2460680	Yeah.
2460680	2468320	So alluding back to the story we were just talking about with Nintendo and supply chain.
2468320	2477160	Well, the they were selling brand new Animal Crossing New Horizons Sanrio amiibo cards
2477160	2484840	and they sold out pretty much immediately because what supply chain and, you know, Target
2484840	2488200	was originally the store that was offering these.
2488200	2493200	I think they may have been the only store and they were limiting orders to per customer.
2493200	2498920	But of course, even like, you know, all the console launches last year immediately grabbed
2498920	2504040	by scalpers who then turned around and sold them online.
2504040	2508280	And, you know, it's a big old mess, as usual.
2508280	2518040	Of course, as pointed out, there's folks that are selling bootleg amiibo cards off of like
2518040	2524680	Etsy and stuff like that, because you can clone them using NFC stickers, which I have
2524680	2528240	a 50 of them.
2528240	2536080	But yeah, it makes it very difficult to actually pay money and get these because they are so
2536080	2539520	scarce, which in reality, they really shouldn't be.
2539520	2542440	Yeah, I have no problem endorsing piracy in this case.
2542440	2543440	Sorry.
2543440	2544440	I know.
2544440	2546800	And I know people are going to take issue with that too.
2546800	2548960	It's just this is unacceptable.
2548960	2551240	What's happening is unacceptable, period.
2551240	2558880	Like Nintendo's scarcity of fucking cards that are so easy to make yourself that there's
2558880	2562240	entire Reddit's dedicated to the process.
2562240	2565520	Like go forth and copy, make your own cards.
2565520	2567760	Now, that's not going to be good enough for some people.
2567760	2571200	Some people are collectors and they're going to want to collect the actual cards and so
2571200	2572200	forth.
2572200	2576040	And again, I'm not here to tell you how to spend your money and how to do all that stuff.
2576040	2579880	But all I'm going to say is that if you want to pirate these cards, because Nintendo didn't
2579880	2583880	put enough of them on shelves and scalpers are buying them instead to devalue what the
2583880	2587040	scalpers have, I am all about piracy.
2587040	2590000	Go forth, pirate, make your own Sanrio amiibo.
2590000	2593040	In this case, I'm not endorsing piracy everywhere.
2593040	2595640	I'm endorsing it for this particular product.
2595640	2601360	Because once again, Nintendo has flopped when it comes to creating the supply to meet the
2601360	2603000	demand.
2603000	2604000	They're cards.
2604000	2605000	I mean, they don't really cost anything.
2605000	2608280	But once again, they want to they don't want to oversaturate the market because it will
2608280	2609640	devalue their product.
2609640	2611960	But like, it's just frustrating.
2611960	2614320	Nobody is concerned about their product being devalued.
2614320	2620320	When is whenever has like anything that Nintendo has sold been devalued?
2620320	2625640	Like ever like I don't even looking at like classic NES games now buying cartridges for
2625640	2626640	those.
2626640	2628840	Those haven't dropped down in price very much.
2628840	2629840	No.
2629840	2635080	In fact, classic NES games, I mean, unless they're like, a lot of like sports games that
2635080	2636560	are released annually.
2636560	2642400	But even sometimes, like, you know, try to find a copy of like, what is the NHL 94, whatever
2642400	2645400	it is on Genesis, the, you know, epic one.
2645400	2647000	Those are still a bit of money.
2647000	2650560	But you know, a lot of the sports games that were published yearly are kind of the exception.
2650560	2654840	But you go back to like the cartridges on the NES, like a lot of they're they're going
2654840	2656620	up in price now.
2656620	2659280	You know, there was a little while when you could get them pretty cheaply.
2659280	2662800	But now that they're becoming more scarce, and they're more collectibles, they're just
2662800	2663800	going up in value.
2663800	2665080	They really, really are.
2665080	2666920	Yeah, it's crazy.
2666920	2669260	But yeah, same old, same old.
2669260	2671720	So I mean, if you want these, hope you got them.
2671720	2676160	But I don't know if they're going to be releasing more.
2676160	2683160	You know, honestly, like it to me, it, it doesn't even really make sense to me anyways,
2683160	2684520	because it's like a one time thing.
2684520	2688080	This really should have been just sold as DLC, like the cards, like, I guess you could
2688080	2691040	collect them, but it's not really something you can just display.
2691040	2693880	It's not like a statue like an amiibo normally is.
2693880	2697000	This is just you scan it into the game and you're done.
2697000	2698000	Yeah.
2698000	2703040	Like, I don't understand why even Well, what would be the point of keeping them again,
2703040	2706040	collectibles akin to baseball card collecting?
2706040	2707360	I understand.
2707360	2710520	And I'm not here to tell somebody what they should and shouldn't collect.
2710520	2712520	So if that is value to somebody, then cool.
2712520	2713520	But you're right.
2713520	2716440	The practical use in the game.
2716440	2718280	I'm sick of the scarcity.
2718280	2719480	I'm sick of it.
2719480	2725080	So pirate now, I would say that I'm going to pirate these.
2725080	2728900	But a listener was like, Oh, I saw these on the shelf.
2728900	2731880	And I grabbed you one so that a scalper wouldn't get it.
2731880	2732880	And that was very kind.
2732880	2734360	I'm very lucky in that regard.
2734360	2740760	But if that hadn't happened, I would have no problem making my own, asking Loki for
2740760	2742480	help and making my own.
2742480	2745920	Yeah, I haven't I haven't quite done it yet.
2745920	2748560	But from what I see, it's very easy.
2748560	2751100	You have a phone app to basically scan it.
2751100	2756120	My phone has NFC writers, so I can just put the sticker on there.
2756120	2760680	Then they have like, the way most people set them up is they have a you print like a piece
2760680	2766080	of paper and you glue it to a poker chip, and you stick it inside of a coin case.
2766080	2769280	And then you can keep everything kind of together.
2769720	2772480	I haven't done it yet because I'm in no hurry to do it.
2772480	2773480	But we did.
2773480	2778800	We were going to do that just with some of the Smash Brothers amiibos and stuff like
2778800	2781040	that that I can't find anymore.
2781040	2782780	Like they're just not being sold anywhere.
2782780	2790240	So it's like rather than pay, you know, over twenty dollars a statue, we'll just put them
2790240	2791440	on a coin.
2791440	2794960	I don't I don't need especially since we're going to scan them in once and that'll be
2794960	2795960	it.
2795960	2797280	Like, I don't need to do that.
2797280	2802000	We don't need a Nintendo just had their own online store where you could order any amiibo
2802000	2803000	you wanted.
2803000	2804000	This wouldn't be such a problem.
2804000	2805000	But no.
2805000	2806000	Oh, yeah.
2806000	2807000	Yeah.
2807000	2808000	That would be helpful.
2808000	2811000	But, you know, that might devalue their product or something.
2811000	2812000	Yeah.
2812000	2820160	I and this is this is the reason why I'm you know, I on one hand, I kind of miss some of
2820160	2821360	the amiibo stuff.
2821360	2823540	But this whole scarcity and thing, I don't miss it.
2823540	2827580	And that's the reason why I kind of do wish this amiibo stuff would come to an end.
2827580	2830660	And I realize these are just reprints of cards that are a few years old anyway, but they're
2830660	2834620	giving it all this new functionality, which obviously makes it a very different situation.
2834620	2836620	So yeah, there is that.
2836620	2841700	Well, speaking of Nintendo, at least this project sounds like it could be interesting.
2841700	2847300	There is a another joint venture that's going to be happening between Nintendo and Niantic.
2847300	2852980	Of course, Niantic being the makers of the hugely popular mobile phone game Pokemon Go,
2852980	2857060	which is still going, it's coming up on its five year anniversary, contrary to what Bobby
2857060	2861700	Black will try to tell you on our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash discord, Pokemon
2861700	2863020	Go is still going.
2863020	2867700	And it's honestly probably in a better place than it's been in a long time coming up on
2867700	2868700	its five year anniversary.
2868700	2873000	And that's going to be very interesting to see how they celebrate the five year anniversary.
2873000	2878000	And this week, Nintendo Niantic put out a joint press release talking about a new partnership.
2878000	2883040	They're going to be jointly develop apps that combine Niantic's real world AR technology
2883040	2885040	with Nintendo's beloved characters.
2885040	2889280	So this is one of probably more to come.
2889280	2897360	And I wonder if this isn't a result of Nintendo's own adventures into mobile phone gaming, you
2897360	2901320	know, outside of Pokemon Go, none of them really took off like everybody was expecting
2901320	2904440	Super Mario Run to change the game and it didn't.
2904960	2909800	And then the Animal Crossing, the Mario Kart, I think is really not done the expectations
2909800	2911280	they expected it to.
2911280	2916080	So they're really reevaluating how they do mobile phone and who's done well with a Nintendo
2916080	2917080	product.
2917080	2919440	Well, I'll tell you, it's Niantic.
2919440	2924400	And I'll tell you why Niantic did well with product where these other companies screwed
2924400	2931760	up because Niantic made a game, a unique thing with the mobile phone and what the mobile
2931760	2934400	phone can offer in mind.
2934400	2937240	What was Super Mario Run?
2937240	2941440	It was a cheap knockoff of the console experience because you couldn't have an actual controller
2941440	2942440	on the phone.
2942440	2946480	They decided, oh, he'll just always run and you'll tap the screen to jump.
2946480	2947480	Flop.
2947480	2948480	Mario.
2948480	2949480	So like an endless runner.
2949480	2954440	Well, it wasn't an endless runner, but like endless based off an endless runner is kind
2954440	2957160	of kind of like cheap.
2957160	2962800	Like just that's like, oh, I'm going to make a mobile game to be endless runners are popular.
2962800	2963800	Yeah.
2964200	2968440	Like when temple runs popular, it's like, okay, well, let's think outside the box of
2968440	2969440	it here.
2969440	2972120	Mario Kart, super fun game on console.
2972120	2974880	I hope they make a Mario Kart nine and soon.
2974880	2979280	But when you try to translate it to cell phone, doing this with your cell phone just isn't
2979280	2980440	the same.
2980440	2982180	It's not as fun.
2982180	2984620	And so people kind of rejected that.
2984620	2989000	This is where Niantic succeeded because they developed a game that took, you know, something
2989000	2992600	only mobile phones can do and a game that was designed for mobile.
2992600	2994480	They had that in the back of their mind.
2994480	2996560	And so that's really what it is.
2996560	2998760	So Nintendo's kind of realized this, I think.
2998760	3002140	And now they're partnering with Niantic to make other games.
3002140	3007200	And the first one that they are going to be doing is a new game based on Pikmin, which
3007200	3010880	that part kind of makes me go, ooh, cause I'm just not a big Pikmin fan.
3010880	3012580	It's like, it's like a monster Hunter for me.
3012580	3013580	You guys love it.
3013580	3014580	I don't, I don't care for it.
3014580	3016680	How many Pikmin games have we gotten recently?
3016680	3020880	Like let's move on to another franchise, please only Pikmin three.
3020880	3021880	It was just recent.
3021880	3024720	That's why it feels like there's like another one before that though.
3024720	3028680	They had another rerelease and aren't they making yet another game as well.
3028680	3029680	They did.
3029680	3031760	Yeah, I think, I think so.
3031760	3036240	It's been so many, like just, Oh God, it's, it's so uninteresting.
3036240	3041580	Like yeah, I'll check it out, but like, it's certainly not ha it does not have the appeal
3041580	3047760	that, you know, a Pokemon game would have a Pikmin is just not, it's not to that level.
3047760	3053380	I'll give it a chance because in the announcement, the press release, they say with gameplay
3053380	3058660	activities designed to encourage walking and making the activities more enjoyable.
3058660	3062080	And of course it's being made by Niantic in Tokyo.
3062080	3065680	And that all sounds making walking more enjoyable.
3065680	3069040	That's what motivates me to play things like Ingress and Pokemon go.
3069040	3073280	So if they find a way to gamify Pikmin in a way that's going to be fun.
3073280	3078640	And I don't expect, and I think I have to remember what I just said about why those
3078640	3080600	other games didn't work.
3080600	3082680	And that might be good news for me here.
3082680	3087900	I didn't enjoy Pikmin on console, but since Niantic, I expect is not just going to try
3087900	3092920	to shove a console version of Pikmin in the real world, but make an AR experience that
3092920	3094440	happens to involve Pikmin.
3094440	3098020	I'm going to give it a shot because it's going to be different from the console games based
3098020	3103520	on the track record of Niantic, based on the track record of all the other companies
3103520	3104820	that Nintendo tried to partner with.
3104820	3106380	Does that make sense?
3106380	3111820	Yeah, I wish they would do like a Zelda game, honestly, because the control scheme that
3111820	3118100	they had on the DS Zelda games using just the touch screen was fantastic.
3118100	3119100	It was great.
3119100	3120580	It worked really well.
3120580	3122860	Like you could make a pretty robust game.
3122860	3126900	I think it would be awesome to see a mobile like Zelda game and even like an AR based
3126900	3131100	one would be kind of cool with different randomly generated dungeons.
3131100	3138620	Can you fucking imagine a Zelda AR game that's kind of like based on the first Zelda where
3138620	3140780	like the entire world is a map.
3140780	3143180	And like you said, a lot of it is just kind of generated.
3143180	3148500	But let's say you go to your park nearby and your park is where the dungeons are and where
3148500	3151820	you get the little doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo and you get like a secret thing and
3151820	3153400	then you can kind of explore the air.
3153400	3154400	That would be so badass.
3154400	3159160	I'd be so into it, but I don't I have no idea if that is, you know, they wouldn't they
3159160	3160720	would do retro Zelda anymore.
3160720	3162480	They would just try to I don't know.
3162480	3169240	It would just not be I don't I. Yeah, it's unfortunate because like stuff like, you know,
3169240	3174760	especially like with Orna, I think is such a great concept that you will fifth dream
3174760	3177200	says just reskin Orna to Zelda.
3177200	3179720	Well, it's a different type of game.
3179720	3183440	But yeah, I mean, if that they could do something like that, that would be kind of similar to
3183480	3185560	like a Final Fantasy AR game almost.
3185560	3189520	I mean, that's kind of what it is.
3189520	3194720	But they could do like they they really could do a mobile Zelda game and it would work.
3194720	3195720	All right.
3195720	3200020	Hell, if you want to be super lazy about it, just pour it over the DS like Zelda games.
3200020	3201480	They worked well with touch screen.
3201480	3203160	Like that's how you played those games.
3203160	3204880	No, no, no.
3204880	3205880	Bad Loki.
3205880	3206880	Where's my square ball?
3206880	3207880	No.
3207880	3212880	I do not want console games ported to mobile phone anymore.
3212880	3213880	We're done.
3213880	3214880	We're past that.
3214880	3215880	So no, that sounds like a terrible idea.
3215880	3216880	Bad.
3216880	3217880	Time out.
3217880	3218880	All right.
3218880	3219880	Fine.
3219880	3220880	Going to chat.
3220880	3221880	Yes.
3221880	3222880	It's you.
3222880	3223880	One hundred.
3223880	3225660	Matt says Niantic is taking notes.
3225660	3226880	Don't give that away for free.
3226880	3229160	And I wouldn't be the first time it's happened on this show.
3229160	3231160	That's listening to.
3231160	3239160	Well, well, anyway, OK, well, Niantic is not listening to.
3239160	3240160	I don't.
3240160	3241160	Maybe not anymore.
3241160	3242160	Anyway.
3242440	3243440	I don't know.
3243440	3244440	We'll see.
3244440	3249680	But you know who you are and you know where to find me.
3249680	3253360	So let's talk if that's of interest to you, please.
3253360	3256160	Anyway, let's see.
3256160	3258560	What else is in the thing here?
3258560	3263680	The app is scheduled to launch globally in twenty twenty one with Niantic as the publisher.
3263680	3266700	That's another interesting note is that it is a game that's scheduled to release this
3266700	3271120	year, which is interesting because did you all forget Niantic supposed to be doing a
3271120	3273240	Catan game, a Settlers of Catan game?
3273240	3275560	That was the other project they did out some time ago.
3275560	3278760	There's there's Pokemon Go.
3278760	3280160	There's Ingress.
3280160	3285100	There's Harry Potter, although I think Portkey Warner Brothers does the bulk of development
3285100	3286100	for that game.
3286100	3288000	And they're just kind of using Niantic's database for that.
3288000	3291920	But the Niantic social has been really crammed into that.
3291920	3295200	And that was a big part of the Pokemon Go upgrades this week is that those two games
3295200	3297640	are really joined at the hip at this point.
3297640	3299640	So we'll see where that comes in.
3299680	3301320	But anyway, those are the three games that exist now.
3301320	3305080	They're supposed to be Settlers of Catan coming or Catan the World.
3305080	3306080	I don't know what it's called.
3306080	3311680	And now we know Pikmin will be game number five, four, if Catan gets slowed down anymore.
3311680	3312680	I don't know.
3312680	3314400	So and Catan is out.
3314400	3318280	If you're in Australia or New Zealand or maybe it's just New Zealand.
3318280	3320200	Sorry to any Aussie listeners.
3320200	3321960	We may have listening if I'm wrong.
3321960	3326600	But I think Catan is still in that beta test in those areas where Niantic really tends
3326600	3328760	to test a lot of their products.
3329560	3334840	All right, Akdev says, I think it's only New Zealand and that may very well be all right.
3334840	3335840	You know what?
3335840	3339960	It's a reward to New Zealand for doing COVID the right way.
3339960	3341640	You get you get Catan.
3341640	3342640	Congrats.
3342640	3345120	And you'll probably get the Pikmin game too first.
3345120	3346120	All right.
3346120	3351280	Anyway, S200mattinchat says, New Zealand gets all the fun things like winning a pandemic.
3351280	3353640	I know.
3353640	3354820	Freaking competent leadership.
3354820	3356840	It's pretty amazing what that'll bring.
3356840	3357840	Anyway, Loki.
3357920	3360800	Oh, oh, here's another gut punch on the mobile front.
3360800	3361800	Hi, Loki.
3361800	3362800	Although, I don't know.
3362800	3365200	I actually don't think this is bad news.
3365200	3366200	But Loki, whatever.
3366200	3367200	You know what?
3367200	3369200	I don't think it's bad news.
3369200	3372760	I think we should celebrate this news.
3372760	3378160	But no, they have to go and dash my hopes again, because that's just where we are in
3378160	3379360	this world.
3379360	3385320	So Square Enix was developing a port of Final Fantasy 11.
3385320	3387080	They were developing it.
3387320	3388320	OK, fine.
3388320	3394440	Nexon was developing it and it was called Final Fantasy 11 R. And it was supposed to
3394440	3403760	be some mobile MMO, but they, as of apparently February, have stopped development on it,
3403760	3409980	saying that in early February, Nexon and Square Enix announced a mutual decision to cancel
3409980	3410980	that project.
3410980	3415860	Together, we decided that the game was not showing the level of creative differentiation
3416140	3419340	that the players expect from a Final Fantasy franchise.
3419340	3424180	And rather than release a game that doesn't break new creative ground, we agreed to step
3424180	3426180	away from the project.
3426180	3427180	Yay.
3427180	3428180	No.
3428180	3429180	Yay.
3429180	3434840	Because that is a very long way of saying we realized Final Fantasy 11 was not fun to
3434840	3436340	play on a mobile phone.
3436340	3440540	And Loki, you would have you and look, I if Jobs were lost or something like that, I wouldn't
3440540	3444920	be having this celebration, but they moved everybody to another project.
3444920	3449000	Nobody finally, along the way, realized Final Fantasy 11 is going to fucking suck to play
3449000	3450000	on a mobile phone.
3450000	3453160	Yay for coming to that decision, because you're absolutely right.
3453160	3456560	And Loki, you know it, whether you want to admit it or not, this game would have sucked
3456560	3457560	on a mobile phone.
3457560	3458560	Absolutely.
3458560	3463680	I played on a tablet, then it would have been fine.
3463680	3465520	I would have still played it.
3465520	3471040	Now, if they take some of those assets that were built and maybe make a, say, Nintendo
3471040	3476520	Switch version of Final Fantasy 11, now we're talking maybe a little more.
3476520	3479880	Maybe I can get on board with something like that, but we'll see.
3479880	3483840	I do think, and look, I had many great years in Final Fantasy 11.
3483840	3489560	I do want to see Final Fantasy 11 be refreshed enough so that more people feel compelled
3489560	3492420	in the year 2021 to take a look at it.
3492420	3495680	I just think the answer was never port it to cell phones.
3495680	3499320	I don't understand, you know, that would have just fundamentally changed the game.
3499320	3503480	That wouldn't have even been Final Fantasy 11 the way we remember it.
3503480	3509200	But I think, well, number one, the mod scene is still doing incredible things in Final
3509200	3510200	Fantasy 11.
3510200	3511200	Did you see that, Loki?
3511200	3515600	Somebody went through and fucking upped all the textures in Final Fantasy 11 to like 4K.
3515600	3519560	And so, like, there's a mod out there that will, like, basically make an HD version of
3519560	3520560	Final Fantasy 11.
3520560	3522320	And it looks pretty amazing.
3522320	3529080	And it's also one of those things that makes you go, why won't Square embrace
3529080	3530080	something like this?
3530080	3534560	Well, maybe they couldn't because of the deal they had going on with Nexon.
3534560	3538080	And that was going to be the next official Final Fantasy 11 product.
3538080	3539760	So let me reiterate.
3539760	3542580	Yay, it's canceled.
3542580	3546960	So now they can do something else that's going to be a little more in line with what we would
3546960	3550680	expect out of a Final Fantasy 11 reimagining.
3550680	3551680	So there's that.
3551680	3552680	All right.
3552680	3558800	Loki, I don't mean to dance on your dreams and all that stuff, but Loki, it's for the
3558800	3560160	best.
3560160	3561400	It's for the best.
3561400	3562400	I guess.
3562400	3563400	All right.
3563400	3565800	I'm not happy about it, though.
3565800	3572200	No, I mean, I mean, I'm only happy because everybody got moved to another project.
3572200	3573200	So we're fine.
3573200	3574200	But anyway.
3574200	3575200	All right.
3575200	3581560	Moving on, let's talk about exciting things happening in the indie scene.
3581560	3584400	That's always something to celebrate and say yay about.
3584400	3589960	And Xbox did an event this week where they talked about indie games, indie games, indie
3589960	3592680	games, and a fucking lot of indie games.
3592680	3593680	There was a lot.
3593680	3594680	Did you see that?
3594680	3595680	I did Xbox.
3595680	3596680	I think it's called.
3596680	3597680	Do you see all that?
3597680	3598680	Yeah, I heard about it.
3598680	3600900	Yeah, I really only saw the bullet points.
3600900	3603160	And they did a showcase.
3603160	3608880	And in the showcase, over 20 games were confirmed that they are going to be on Game Pass at
3608880	3609880	launch.
3609880	3615800	And I think one of them just came out like the day after right away.
3615800	3618080	Sorry, I forget which game came out.
3618080	3621720	I forget the name in the moment.
3621720	3625400	But there was a game that something, Moonlight, I think it was called.
3625400	3630720	So anyway, some of the other games that are going to be coming to Game Pass.
3630720	3636120	Art of the Rally, Astrea Ascending, Backbone, Boyfriend Dungeon, Craftopia, Dead Static
3636120	3640160	Drive, Edge of Eternity, Hello Neighbor 2, that was one I know they're spotlighting
3640160	3648000	a bit, Library of Ruina, Little Witch in the Woods, Moonglow Bay, Narita Boy, Nobody Saves
3648000	3655760	the World, Omno, Re-compile, Sable, She Dreams Elsewhere, Stalker 2, The Ascent, Undungeon,
3655760	3657720	Way to the Woods, and Wild at Heart.
3657720	3660640	So all of those, again, they're coming to Game Pass the first day.
3660640	3662840	So it's pretty impressive on Microsoft's part.
3662880	3669160	And I think that's a great way for more indie games to get discovered as well, is that by
3669160	3675720	kind of releasing on that Game Pass and going to that app where, hey, I can check this game
3675720	3678960	out because it's part of what I have in my subscription anyway.
3678960	3682360	I think it's getting those games out there to even a wider audience.
3682360	3688160	And they're not getting lost in, say, Nintendo's storefront, where it's like if you don't succeed
3688160	3691760	in the first week, you're going to get buried, or the way things work on Steam.
3691800	3692560	Am I right, Loki?
3693880	3699720	Yeah, I mean, definitely, it's, you know, easier to find those games and easier to check
3699720	3703960	them out, especially, you know, I'm glad that they have the back of these independent
3703960	3708320	developers to be able to kind of showcase their games.
3708480	3713720	Plus, it's a guaranteed revenue stream because it is being included in Game Pass that they're
3713720	3714960	getting money from that.
3714960	3717560	So that's pretty nice as well, that deal.
3718560	3723920	Genesis Noir is the game I was trying to think of that came right out on Xbox Game Pass.
3723920	3727440	Yeah, that Nobody Saves the World 2, that's supposed to be a brand new RPG by the guys
3727440	3729320	that did Guacamelee.
3729320	3730320	So that looks pretty cool.
3730320	3731320	Oh, that'll be fun.
3731320	3732320	Very cool.
3732320	3733320	Yeah.
3733320	3734320	All right.
3734320	3739240	Akdeft in chat says, Art of the Rally kind of reminds me of RC Pro-Am.
3740760	3745600	So, yeah, there's, you know, a lot of these indie titles, honestly, they get their influence
3745600	3749520	from an established IP, and then a lot of them do it even better.
3749520	3751320	So that's pretty, pretty cool.
3751320	3754520	All right, let's move on with some more news.
3754520	3755520	Loki.
3755520	3764640	So, Sony is planning on shutting down the stores for the PlayStation 3, PSP and Vita
3764640	3765640	this summer.
3765640	3766640	Rumor.
3766640	3767640	Rumor.
3767640	3775040	Yes, allegedly, so the rumor is that they're closing the PlayStation 3 and PSP versions
3775040	3782700	of the store early July and then shutting down the Vita version in late August.
3782700	3787480	So apparently that will, I don't think you'll be able to purchase any more games through
3787480	3788480	that.
3788480	3794560	You will still have, possibly have the option to redownload previously purchased titles,
3794560	3798760	but you won't be able to purchase brand new titles anymore, or at least not through those
3798760	3799760	services.
3799760	3800760	Yeah.
3801480	3806480	Yeah, I mean, this is something we've seen, like, Nintendo do.
3806480	3811640	Not surprising, but we'll have to see if it actually happens.
3811640	3812640	Probably would.
3812640	3813920	I could see them doing that.
3813920	3820440	I know we've seen a lot of stories also about, like, so-called pirates preserving some of
3820440	3826760	these games, but I don't know if that's necessarily what they're doing.
3826760	3828480	But sure, sure.
3828480	3832120	People say that you're doing it for game preservation, not piracy.
3832120	3837120	Well, I mean, but this begs the question, you know, again, like, if I'm not allowed
3837120	3840320	to buy the game anymore, what choice do I have?
3840320	3841320	True.
3841320	3844000	Yeah, that makes sense.
3844000	3848880	But the developers, you know, the publishers or whatever of these games aren't receiving
3848880	3850200	any money either.
3850200	3856480	So yeah, I get it, you can't purchase the game, but I don't know.
3856480	3857480	Yeah.
3858480	3863960	I think at that point, though, like, the money's been made, but it still sucks.
3863960	3871440	Yeah, I just I wish Sony was embracing backwards compatibility.
3871440	3877040	I know their current, you know, management feels a certain way about it, but I think
3877040	3881360	Xbox has been winning a lot of favor with people because they've recognized they were
3881360	3883760	going the wrong way with backwards compatibility in the beginning, too.
3883760	3887120	But I think they recognized that that was a mistake and really opening their library
3887160	3890520	to backwards compatibility, and especially the part where they're making the older games
3890520	3894360	even better through something like the auto HDR and, you know, something like, you know,
3894360	3898320	I was talking last week, I played Oblivion for a little bit because it was on Game Pass
3898320	3900280	and it looks even better than it did.
3900280	3903000	Of course it does, because I have a nicer TV now and all that stuff.
3903000	3906200	You know, it looks great compared to what it did on the 360.
3906200	3911200	So it's just a shame that Sony won't do the same thing.
3911200	3915720	Now, Sony would say, oh, well, you can still experience our rich PlayStation 3 library
3915720	3917840	through PlayStation Now.
3917840	3920320	Nobody wants PlayStation Now.
3920320	3926120	Well, and I think a big part of that is because it's cloud based and I don't think everybody
3926120	3930400	wants cloud based, especially when we're still living in this era of data caps.
3930400	3934400	And you know, OK, but where's PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1?
3934400	3938120	You know, that was a big part of what was on the PlayStation 3 store.
3938120	3942280	There was a lot of PlayStation 1 classics on there that you really can't get anywhere
3942280	3946760	else once that's gone, because my PlayStation 5 can't play a fucking PlayStation 1 game.
3946760	3947760	You know what I mean?
3947760	3949760	Or PlayStation 4, whatever.
3949760	3954800	And that's going to suck because games like, say, you know, great, great PlayStation 1
3954800	3956760	games like, say, Suikoden 1 and 2.
3956760	3959140	You know, those games were really hard to find for a while.
3959140	3962120	And then when they came out on the PlayStation 3, it was like, awesome.
3962120	3965740	We can get these digitally because there's no such thing as digital scarcity in the Sony
3965740	3967360	universe until now.
3967360	3971220	All these years later, now we're just going to be losing the store altogether.
3971220	3975500	And we can't really trust Konami to ever get their shit together to get these games
3975500	3979220	re-released on PlayStation 4 or 5 or what have you.
3979220	3983680	So I think Sony is doing a big disservice by getting rid of a lot of these PlayStation
3983680	3985180	1 and 2 games as well.
3985180	3991000	Now there's rumors, you know, we love to talk rumors, that Sony is going to address the
3991000	3993820	backwards compatibility thing.
3993820	3997220	But I'm not going to put stock in that because their track record doesn't really show that.
3997220	4001780	I would be pleasantly, pleasantly surprised if they have a change of heart on that front.
4001780	4006620	And that's something we hear about come June or whenever.
4006620	4007620	We'll see.
4007620	4012020	It would be nice, but yeah, we've been hoping for that for a long time now.
4012020	4013020	Yeah.
4013020	4016900	Dartesuya in chat says, yeah, Sony is really bending over backwards to drop the ball in
4016900	4018580	this backwards compatibility stuff.
4018580	4019580	And it sucks.
4019580	4020580	Yeah.
4020580	4021740	And I mean, the same thing goes with the Vita and that stuff.
4021740	4025460	I mean, Jason mentioned in the intro tonight and I thought that was a great PSA.
4025460	4026660	Sure.
4026660	4033540	I might have downloaded games to my Vita and my PSP, but thanks to battery bloat and what
4033540	4038260	actually can happen to those batteries, those devices may not work anymore.
4038260	4040960	And I can't exactly go buy replacements either.
4040960	4046540	So my digital library on those consoles, gone forever.
4046540	4052260	Because for whatever reason, the PlayStation TV had to be a separate fucking thing and
4052260	4056140	couldn't have just been integrated into the PlayStation 4 or 5 to be able to play Vita
4056140	4057140	games.
4057140	4058140	I don't understand.
4058140	4065660	Well, you just see that the power of the PlayStation 5 cannot run a Vita game at this point.
4065660	4067180	It doesn't make any sense.
4067180	4068180	It really doesn't.
4068180	4073980	And again, why did I buy a Xbox Series X as compared to a PlayStation 5?
4073980	4078100	A lot of it had to do with backwards compatibility and the fact that there weren't a ton of launch
4078100	4081920	titles last year that were on either system that were very compelling.
4081920	4086880	So it was really about who I thought was going to handle the back library better.
4086880	4090440	And I think I made the right choice with Microsoft, especially after hearing about all these fucking
4090440	4094200	hoops people have to jump through to get their Marvel's Avenger PlayStation 4 file to work
4094200	4095200	on PlayStation 5.
4095200	4096200	It's ridiculous.
4096200	4097200	All right.
4097200	4104780	Anyway, let's move on and talk about a game that came out this week that's been having
4104780	4105780	some...
4105780	4107120	Oh, boy.
4107120	4109280	This game sounds like a hot ass fucking mess.
4109280	4110280	And I'm going to...
4110280	4111280	Full disclaimer.
4111560	4113720	Because everybody's told me not to.
4113720	4119000	Even though I like the people behind it, everything I've heard about this game, the demo wasn't
4119000	4120000	good.
4120000	4121000	The game's not good.
4121000	4122400	And it's been having issues.
4122400	4124760	It's Balan Wonderworld.
4124760	4130800	And apparently, just to pour salt on the wound, the last boss fight decided to do this whole
4130800	4135160	flashing thing, which I don't know how this misses QHX and things like that.
4135160	4137640	Or maybe it did get hit in the QHX.
4138360	4144120	But even then, how did it not get prioritized as a must fix type of thing is the flashing
4144120	4147360	that happened on the final boss fight, which can even cause seizures.
4147360	4150440	It just wasn't prioritized, much like how...
4150440	4153060	I think the same thing happened with Cyberpunk.
4153060	4154060	They had the same issue.
4154060	4157320	They had to tone it down.
4157320	4161820	So they did now, just to be clear, there is a day one patch for the game and the day one
4161820	4164240	patch does handle the issue.
4164400	4168440	But for all those journalists that were reviewing the cop writing their negative reviews of
4168440	4172840	the game in advance, that was sure a nasty little gotcha for those that got to the final
4172840	4174200	boss fight.
4174200	4179120	There is video of it on YouTube, but again, I just told you, it could make you sick.
4179120	4181240	So I really wouldn't go seeking that out.
4181240	4184480	There's much more interesting things you could watch on YouTube.
4184480	4193920	So it's another kick in the ass of this game, which has just not been getting great.
4193920	4199560	Like buzz, great reviews or anything, which is weird because it's coming from Sonic, dude,
4199560	4201920	and you know, Phantasy Star Online and all that stuff.
4201920	4206560	I think the expectations were a lot higher and wow.
4206560	4211620	Shane is in chat saying, I don't have flashing light problems usually, but that video did
4211620	4213440	not make me feel the best.
4213440	4215700	Darktitsuya said, yeah, I heard about this one.
4215700	4217400	Just glad they're fixing it day one.
4217400	4219200	So may try to get it at some point.
4219200	4221400	I did kind of like the demo.
4221400	4224480	It's out now, by the way, and it was fixed in that day one patch.
4224480	4228840	Just please make sure you get that patch before you get all the way to the final boss, because
4228840	4232280	this would be a nasty surprise sitting in the game.
4232280	4233280	That's a bummer.
4233280	4235760	Any interest in Balan Wonderworld from you, Loki?
4235760	4236760	It looked cool.
4236760	4242680	I just, you know, I have too many games right now that I haven't played, so.
4242680	4243680	I don't know.
4243680	4244680	It looks like a very cool game.
4244680	4245680	It's just.
4245680	4248000	I probably won't buy it anytime soon.
4248000	4249000	All right.
4249000	4253080	Well, I think we need to take a trip down memory lane to a time when we had classic
4253080	4258400	games that didn't cause such headaches and check out that video, the video, man, that's
4258400	4259400	a lot of flashing.
4259400	4263040	I don't know how that got past them.
4263040	4265840	That yeah, that seems like something that they should definitely have dressed.
4265840	4266840	I agree.
4266840	4267840	Anyway, let's get to it.
4267840	4272240	The classic game of the week.
4272240	4277320	So this week to help us with the classic game of the week, since Dark Sakura is out tonight,
4277320	4280060	I have brought in a very special guest.
4280060	4283140	One that I think is familiar to most of you O.L.R. regulars.
4283140	4284920	Say hello, everybody, to Alan Alchemy.
4284920	4285920	Hey, Alan.
4285920	4286920	Hello.
4286920	4288560	How are you doing?
4288560	4289560	I'm doing all right.
4289560	4290560	How are you?
4290560	4291560	I am good.
4291560	4293800	And thanks for being able to fill in tonight on short notice.
4293800	4297600	I guess it helps that you, you know, we live together and all that.
4297600	4298600	Yes.
4298600	4299600	All right.
4299600	4300600	So, you know the drill.
4300600	4303040	Every week here on the show, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and picks a game that
4303040	4306460	she wants to highlight as the classic game of the week.
4306600	4309340	Although once a month, she puts a twist on it, but you're not doing that tonight.
4309340	4312280	You're helping to fill in for a classic game.
4312280	4316020	So Alan, what have you picked for this week's classic game of the week?
4316020	4321000	Well, when you ask me to pinch hit like this, I did have to take a look on Wikipedia and
4321000	4325280	see what came out 10 years ago, which is morbidly depressing because I could have swore that
4325280	4329520	a lot of those games came out three years ago, not 10.
4329520	4332680	So yeah.
4332680	4338020	I saw something that caught my eye that played for, uh, that I had played, uh, for a bit
4338020	4342900	when it was fresh meme all back all the way back in October of 2010.
4342900	4346900	Um, it's actually a game that had a little bit of a preview in 2008.
4346900	4352580	I'll get to that in a moment, but I am talking about super meat boy, which came out on October
4352580	4360220	20th, 2010 for, I believe Xbox 360 live arcade came on, uh, became available on their online
4360220	4361820	store for the Xbox.
4361840	4364360	I cannot believe this game is 10 years old.
4364360	4369240	Although I think I saw a tweet just a couple of days ago that said something like the time
4369240	4374720	between the super Nintendo and the Xbox three 60 release now matches the time between the
4374720	4377780	Xbox three 60 release and now something like that.
4377780	4385000	So it's like, yeah, it's just like when the difference between now and Nirvana's, um,
4385000	4388760	smells like teen spirit when we were in high school was the same as like red Zeppelin's
4388760	4389880	houses, the Holies.
4389880	4390880	It's like, fuck off.
4390940	4393100	You know, I don't need your factoids.
4393100	4394220	I'm not interested.
4394220	4397820	I'm not here for these reminders of, you know what?
4397820	4399520	I don't like facts.
4399520	4401000	Get them away from me.
4401000	4402740	We don't like facts here at OLR.
4402740	4403740	This is good.
4403740	4405940	This is why I know I can always count on you to fill in the segment.
4405940	4406940	All right.
4406940	4407940	I'm sorry.
4407940	4408940	So super meat boy.
4408940	4409940	Yes.
4409940	4412520	I spent plenty of hours on this myself.
4412520	4418960	So this game started out as a flash game on new grounds, uh, who remembers new grounds,
4418960	4420920	the sort of more innocent.
4420920	4423060	I don't want to say it's more innocent for a chance.
4423060	4424060	What does that make?
4424060	4425060	What does that even mean?
4425060	4433340	Um, it was new grounds was just a, a big cornucopia of amazing, weird off kilter content.
4433340	4440660	You had salad fingers and like awesome games and ego Raptor from game grumps got to start
4440660	4441660	on new grounds.
4441660	4447800	And so did the behemoth studio that made alien hominid and also, um, castle crashers all
4447800	4449440	has roots in new grounds.
4449440	4457200	So a lot of like elder millennial and like gen X programmers really glommed on a new
4457200	4461540	grounds in the late nineties and eventually built careers that are still relevant to this
4461540	4466680	day at super meat boy is a game that was put out on new grounds and it got so much hype
4466680	4472360	and traffic that they were able to leverage that into a real, um, self published title.
4472360	4480840	Um, it was, uh, designed by Edmund McMillan and Tommy, uh, this is where I should probably
4480840	4483040	look up names before I try to say them.
4483040	4491360	Uh, Thomas Raffens, Tommy Raffens, apologies under the collective name of team Matt, much
4491360	4498920	better to say, um, this, uh, super meat boy to me, um, was a culmination of a lot of things
4498920	4505160	that were in sort of the ether in sort of like the self-published sort of bootleg ROM
4505160	4511620	type style games that were popular in the late two thousands, uh, games like I want
4511620	4520600	to be the guy games like asshole, Mario, Ron hacks, basically that really pushed punishing
4520600	4528840	intense difficulty and repetition, memorization, um, super meat boy was, uh, it's a, it's a
4528840	4529840	platformer.
4529840	4534400	Um, the sprites are very small, but there's a lot of pixels and there's a lot of detail.
4534400	4536120	The soundtrack is incredible.
4536120	4542960	Um, as the super in the title evokes, it's very much a intentional retro aesthetic game.
4542960	4547880	It looks like it could have been made on the super NAS or Genesis, especially when you
4547880	4550400	get that awesome soundtrack.
4550400	4557840	And the plot of it, um, is you are a little ball of flash, honestly, um, who lives with
4557840	4562160	his girlfriend bandage girl, cause he's constantly bleeding.
4562160	4564680	Um, and she's a bandaid.
4564680	4566320	How could I be more obvious?
4566320	4572080	Um, one day bandage girl is kidnapped by Dr. Fetus and intelligent fetus and a life support
4572080	4573080	suit.
4573080	4576800	Um, and it's, it's rescue the princess.
4576800	4579080	It's a rescue the princess game.
4579080	4582560	And there are a ton of levels.
4582560	4587560	Um, I don't know exactly how many, uh, but yeah, it is.
4587560	4592640	The type of game where you want to get from point A to point B, uh, you're navigating
4592640	4596000	these sort of scrolling levels that sometimes you go down.
4596000	4597600	Sometimes you go to the right.
4597600	4605920	There's traps, bombs, spinning blades, double jumps that inquire very specific timing.
4605920	4610720	And when you die, you leave a ghost of your attempt.
4610720	4617200	And then as you finish the level, it will show you the ghosts of every attempt that
4617200	4622680	you had needed to get to the fucking, whatever the objective is for that level.
4622680	4623680	That's very humbling.
4623680	4627400	When you would see a hundred of those little fuckers all over the screen, like just screwing
4627400	4628400	up left and right.
4628400	4630080	It is a mechanic.
4630080	4631080	It is a mechanic.
4631080	4635440	Sorry to interrupt it as the mechanic that they introduced or that they, that was replicated
4635440	4640920	in Mario maker because in Mario maker, you can see where everyone else dies.
4640920	4642320	No, that's very true.
4642320	4643320	Good point.
4644000	4650200	And as a matter of fact, I think, and this is a little tinfoil hat for me, the fact that,
4650200	4656840	um, super meat boy got the sales that it did, given that we already had seen, um, ROM hacks
4656840	4660600	like asshole Mario, I want to be the guy and so on.
4660600	4666880	I don't think Nintendo really knew what the demand was like for a professionally done
4666880	4671800	suite of like, let's make, let's take super Mario brothers and make it hard as fuck.
4671960	4675160	Let's make it like, cause people were already doing that.
4675160	4680880	And I think when this, I think put the writing on the wall where it's like, Oh, if we make
4680880	4684320	a Mario maker, it will be successful.
4684320	4688800	And the fact that that feature of the ghosts of all the previous attempts, even from online
4688800	4694480	people, just to see where most people die when they attempt the stage, the fact that
4694480	4699200	that brought India, it was brought into Mario maker to me is not a coincidence, but that's
4699200	4700200	just me.
4700200	4706920	He's sort of trying to be, you know, I mean, nobody can really prove that, but you know,
4706920	4711560	one could argue, it does seem like Nintendo may have taken influence from, you know, super
4711560	4716600	meat boy and what the indie community did for the Mario series, which in turn heavily
4716600	4718520	had influenced super meat boy in the first place.
4718520	4719520	It's just, it's very interesting.
4719520	4723960	I mean, again, we can't prove it, but it's, it's very interesting.
4723960	4732880	And I also believe that super meat boy success also gave the cup boy, um, developers the
4732880	4737920	sort of it's in the air sort of green light that they needed to motivate themselves to
4737920	4743840	put out cup boy, like, Oh, there is a market there for incredibly stylized.
4743840	4749560	I mean the graphics in cup boy are based off of like thirties animation, but the quality
4749560	4750560	of the visuals is incredible.
4750560	4752200	It's not really a cup head.
4752200	4753200	Oh, cup head.
4753200	4754200	I'm sorry.
4754200	4755200	Okay.
4755200	4756200	Cup head.
4756200	4765800	Um, uh, they were like, Oh, so, and also dark souls came out in like 2009 question
4765800	4770400	mark, uh, dark, uh, demon souls came out 2000, what, five, seven.
4770400	4776880	Um, so that it was in the air that gamers were all a bunch of fucking masochists and
4776880	4783120	would like whip us, whip me, beat me, daddy and super me boy was more than happy to oblige
4783120	4788540	like dark souls, like all of these asshole Mario Ram hat.
4788540	4794720	So and also, um, cup head, excuse me, of just really fucking difficult to the games.
4794720	4799480	Uh, super meat boy, the fact that it, I had never really heard of it cause I had fallen
4799480	4800480	off of the new grounds.
4800480	4802440	I wasn't checking it like every day or every week.
4802440	4805520	Like I had in the nineties and early two thousands.
4805520	4811340	So, um, yeah, it was a game that was ultimately put out on every platform that you could think
4811340	4813240	of because it's a digital footprint.
4813240	4814240	Isn't all about large.
4814240	4820040	It's a 2d scroller and it came out on the three 60 on windows proper.
4820040	4821860	I think it's on steam.
4821860	4822860	It's on the Vita.
4822860	4827440	It's on the Wii U it's on the switch, it's on the PS four and there's a Linux build for
4827440	4828440	it.
4828440	4830240	It's everywhere.
4830240	4837120	And it's sequel, um, came out in December of this most recent year.
4837120	4842880	So that's a pretty significant gap between the original game and the sequel and it wasn't
4842880	4844280	quite as well received.
4844280	4845280	That's for sure.
4845280	4846440	But I do want to, isn't it a runner?
4846440	4847440	Didn't they change it up?
4847440	4849080	And I think it's more like an endless runner.
4849080	4853600	Um, but, uh, the, uh, three 60, I think is always going to be my favorite version because
4853600	4856400	I, sorry, but the soundtrack is way better than that one.
4856400	4860480	And I realized they ended up having some disputes and so they ended up having the soundtrack
4860480	4861480	completely rewritten.
4861480	4865880	Um, but in my opinion, that original soundtrack was, was superior to the new one, no offense
4865880	4867760	to any composers involved.
4867760	4869240	That's just my opinion.
4869240	4870240	Yeah.
4870240	4876080	Um, yeah, I barely see, I played this for a bit and then I got distracted by something
4876080	4877080	else.
4877080	4884240	So, um, I can't necessarily say that I've beaten this game top to bottom and done every
4884240	4885440	level 10 times.
4885480	4889120	Um, but this definitely caught my attention for a bit and it, it, it's a unique enough
4889120	4895440	title that, um, I wanted to make sure that it got a spotlight in classic game.
4895440	4902360	Meat Boy, um, has made cameos in, uh, roughly a dozen, if not more, uh, titles.
4902360	4908880	He's appeared as an unlockable or DLC character in Bit.Trip Runner, Bit.Trip Fate, uh, Runner
4908880	4916480	2, um, Spelunky, Dust and Elysian Tail, Ori and the Blind Forest, Retro City Rampage,
4916480	4921720	uh, Ilomilo and Indie Pogo.
4921720	4929120	Um, PETA came out with, and here's the thing that I hate about, I mean, PETA is just a
4929120	4934220	horrific like organization, whatever their mission statement is there, they're bad.
4934220	4939460	There's other ways to, to, um, I guess make their talking points that don't have to come
4939460	4941540	out of their platform in particular.
4941540	4946540	But one thing that frustrates me about them is that when they put out a parody flash video
4946540	4949020	game, they hire good flash programmers.
4949020	4953660	If you remember the tofu cookie mama game that came out for Thanksgiving, that game
4953660	4955300	was a jam.
4955300	4959500	That was a good flash game where you had to like carve the tof- the tofurkey and like
4959500	4960920	put the stuffing in it.
4960920	4962300	It was a fun game.
4962300	4967980	Um, so PETA in protest of this game, even though I don't necessarily know that Super
4967980	4972380	Meat Boy is made of beef, I think he's just like, he's just blood.
4972380	4973780	I don't know what he is.
4973780	4975900	He's married to a bandaid.
4975900	4979820	I don't think, I don't think, no one told PETA that it wasn't that serious, but they
4979820	4987860	came out with a parody flash game called Super Tofu Boy, um, on December 1st of 2010 to protest
4987860	4990380	the game and promote veganism.
4990380	4993520	Um, I don't think you eat or cook anything in Super Meat Boy.
4993520	4996020	You're just a ball of blood trying to rescue his girlfriend.
4996020	4998820	So again, it's not, it's not that deep.
4998820	5004320	Um, but in response, Team Meat, uh, added its own interpretation of Tofu Boy on the
5004320	5007700	PC version of actual, uh, Super Meat Boy.
5007700	5010220	So yeah, I think he was a character in the Steam version.
5010220	5014940	Um, the game success, again, I mentioned this before, spurred the development of the 1930
5014940	5016900	style animated video game Cuphead.
5016900	5017900	Interesting.
5017900	5018900	All right.
5019300	5020300	All right.
5020300	5024260	Well, there it is your classic game of the week, Super Meat Boy.
5024260	5026140	Very good pick, Alan.
5026140	5027140	Thank you.
5027140	5031060	Um, Hey, before I let you go, um, I know you've been doing a lot more streaming here on Twitch
5031060	5032060	recently.
5032060	5036900	Um, and you know, we've even hosted your channel a couple of times after OLR, but for our podcast
5036900	5040780	crowd, um, who doesn't, you know, um, get those, you know, hosting things on Twitch
5040780	5041780	and stuff.
5041780	5042900	Do you want to tell us really quick about your channel?
5042900	5045300	Cause you've been, you've been doing like a lot more streaming.
5045300	5048460	I know I've talked about streaming, but you've been really committed to it over the past
5048460	5052060	month and what you're up past a hundred followers now, which for somebody just starting out
5052060	5053700	in their first month, that's really incredible.
5053700	5054700	You're doing great.
5054700	5056660	Um, you want to tell us a little more about your channel?
5056660	5057660	Yeah.
5057660	5061540	Um, I've, I haven't quite had a solid week where I've stuck to the schedule that I've
5061540	5066420	sort of designed for myself, but I have consistently done about three nights a week, if not four,
5066420	5067420	which is pretty good.
5067420	5068700	I've been doing it for a little over a month.
5068700	5074220	My Twitch channel is AlanAlchemy, A-L-L-E-N, A-L-C-H-E-M-Y.
5075060	5079020	My Twitter is AlanA-L-L-E-N underscore T-T-V.
5079020	5084140	I'm a variety streamer focusing right now on Dead by Daylight, but of a more important
5084140	5090300	interest to OLR listeners is that on Monday I decided to do Music Night Mondays where
5090300	5092700	I try out various music games.
5092700	5099140	A lot of it so far has been a retro, um, music games of established, you know, nostalgic
5099140	5100140	properties.
5100140	5101340	I haven't done Parappa the Rapper yet.
5101340	5104700	I don't know if I will because I never really clicked with Parappa, believe it or not, but
5104700	5108180	I've been doing a lot of Bust a Groove in the US.
5108180	5109180	It's called Bust a Move.
5109180	5110500	I have the Japanese versions.
5110500	5111500	Thank you very much.
5111500	5115820	So I've been playing Bust a Move, but the dance game, not the, um, the Marvel puzzle
5115820	5116820	game.
5116820	5118500	Um, I've been doing lots of Space Channel Five.
5118500	5122980	I did Rez last Monday, which was a lot of fun.
5122980	5129180	Um, so I may eventually broaden that to do stuff like Jet Set Radio or Jet Grind Radio
5129220	5131660	because that's very much a music game in my opinion.
5131660	5140740	Um, but yeah, when I'm not doing Music Night Mondays, um, I am focusing on Dead by Daylight
5140740	5147500	and I've thrown in some, um, beefcake slutty Skyrim, um, for the, for the gay, for the
5147500	5152220	gay men out there and the, uh, women who like to look at, um, barbarians who aren't wearing
5152220	5153220	a lot of clothing.
5153220	5157300	Um, it's a lot safer to broadcast than perhaps, um, what is it?
5157300	5164540	Bitchin' Bad Conan, whatever that game is with the, with the full schlong, um, but yeah,
5164540	5165540	it's a good time.
5165540	5166540	All right.
5166540	5171580	I hope, I hope our podcast listeners will check that out over at, um, Alan Alchemy on
5171580	5176320	Twitch and, um, hope you're able to continue growing your channel and, um, good luck with
5176320	5178620	all the, uh, Dead by Daylight and all that good stuff.
5178620	5181620	You know, one thing, um, I really enjoy when I'm watching your channel and, you know, I'm
5181620	5185580	not just saying this cause like we're married and stuff, but, um, is that I like that you
5185580	5188420	kind of explain, you know, I didn't know a lot about Dead by Daylight and there's a
5188420	5191980	lot of people on Twitch that stream Dead by Daylight, but when I first watched you do
5191980	5195620	it, you were really kind of explaining the why behind a lot of things you were doing.
5195620	5197620	And I think that really helped me understand the game.
5197620	5199740	And I know you've been doing that with a lot of the other stuff you play.
5199740	5203260	So I definitely encourage, um, you know, I know a lot of people on Twitch kind of be
5203260	5206980	like, I'm a variety streamer, but I like a variety streamer who kind of like also educates
5206980	5208020	a little bit on games.
5208020	5209020	And I think you do very good.
5209020	5210020	Yeah.
5210020	5213780	I don't know if I could ever just be a one game streamer because a lot of people on Twitch
5213780	5217620	are successful because they play Dark Souls or Fortnite and that is all they're allowed
5217620	5219940	to play by their fan base.
5219940	5223960	So yeah, I'm not going to pigeonhole myself like that, but I definitely do think that
5223960	5225820	Dead by Daylight is a really fun game.
5225820	5226820	All right.
5226820	5230620	Well, thank you for joining us tonight and, uh, filling in last minute here on the classic
5230620	5235260	game of the week when dark soccer is out tonight, um, we'll, uh, ask everybody to follow you
5235260	5239260	on Twitch again over at Alan Alchemy, and we'll see you back on the show again soon.
5239260	5240940	I'm sure Alan have a good one.
5240940	5241940	All right.
5241940	5242940	Thank you.
5243100	5244100	All right.
5244100	5248020	Thanks once again to Alan for filling in, uh, on this week's classic game of the week.
5248020	5249300	That was a great selection there.
5249300	5250300	Super Meat Boy.
5250300	5252620	Loki, you've dropped a lot of hours on that game too, right?
5252620	5253620	Super Meat Boy.
5253620	5260220	Um, yeah, I've played through, I think the single, like I, I think the original game,
5260220	5265740	I, I don't know if I beat it or I freak, I might've beaten it.
5265740	5268860	I don't remember, but yeah, I played through a lot of that.
5268860	5271820	Well, one thing we didn't end up getting into in that segment was the whole fact that there's
5271860	5274100	like the light world and the dark world.
5274100	5277180	So maybe like you played through the light world stages and it's like, Oh, the dark world
5277180	5278180	ones were even harder.
5278180	5283140	I did the dark world stuff too, um, hard levels to go back and look, but it's been a while,
5283140	5288940	but yeah, I did play through that quite a bit, um, a while back, but yeah, it's a great
5288940	5289940	game.
5289940	5290940	All right.
5290940	5292900	Well, thanks again to Alan for filling in with very little notice tonight.
5292900	5293900	Appreciate that.
5293900	5297420	All right, let's get to some rapid fire news and check out some other things going on in
5297420	5298420	the industry.
5298420	5300500	Loki, start us off, please.
5300500	5301500	Yeah.
5301500	5303860	So, um, this is pretty cool.
5303860	5309580	We've got some updates for a relatively old game, serious Sam too.
5309580	5313700	Um, and this is kind of actually a little bit like the story we talked about last week
5313700	5320740	with grant the photo online and how we had some independent developers creating mods
5320740	5322900	to update a game and make it better.
5322900	5325300	And then that being released officially.
5325300	5326540	So that's kind of what happened here.
5326540	5332780	Uh, we had an independent developer, Nathan DWK Brown released a huge update for serious
5332780	5334920	Sam too.
5334920	5341340	And it, um, it's basically the last update or the first update since the game launched.
5341340	5345940	Um, I don't know, like almost 15 years ago, it's been, it's been a while since they've
5345940	5350820	had an update and, uh, you know, added a lot of different things to it.
5350820	5356660	So some of the things added a couple of new weapons, um, sprinting, dual wielding rocket
5356660	5363700	jumping and visual up and, or updates to the visuals and animation, uh, radar that tracks
5363700	5367000	enemies, NPCs and new objectives.
5367000	5370860	So that's a pretty major overall.
5370860	5376220	Um, that's pretty awesome to see like an older game like that, get some love like that.
5376220	5382020	And you know, uh, crow team actually did partner with them to, uh, release that update.
5382020	5383940	So, uh, it's pretty awesome.
5383940	5388980	And according to the announces says, I hope all, uh, hope that all that was done helps
5388980	5391460	keep the game enjoyable for a long time to come.
5391460	5394620	Um, if that works out, it was all worth it.
5394620	5396900	Long live serious Sam too.
5396900	5398740	So pretty awesome.
5398740	5404900	Um, now this brand new game that's coming out here, Outriders, uh, which is coming out
5404900	5410540	soon, they are planning to, uh, mark cheaters in the game.
5410540	5417420	Um, so if they catch someone cheating, they're actually going to brand them as a cheater.
5417420	5429460	And apparently they said out of the, um, demo players, only about 0.01% of them were cheaters,
5429460	5434220	but, um, they said that every single one of the cheaters who gave themselves, you know,
5434220	5441660	I guess 600, um, ill gotten legendary weapons, uh, apparently are going to be banned or they're
5441660	5445180	not gonna be banned, but they're going to be punished in other ways for starters, there'll
5445180	5449340	be kept in separate, um, or kept separately from legit players.
5449340	5453780	So like some of the other games, including grants that online, um, they'll make you basically
5453780	5455920	play with other cheaters.
5455920	5459740	And they're also going to give you a small discreet, but easiest spot Mark that will
5459740	5461040	be added to your HUD.
5461040	5467480	So, um, if you're a popular streamer and you're cheating, they will be able to see
5467480	5468480	that you're cheating.
5468480	5469480	Interesting.
5469480	5472360	It's like the Scarlet letter, but for cheaters.
5472360	5473360	Yeah.
5473360	5478760	So some of the things of course that would be, um, considered cheating, they said intentionally
5478760	5484600	running a game on PC without easy anti-cheat modifying game files to enhance character,
5484600	5490160	uh, level skills and inventory, et cetera, extremely modifying the game to reduce time
5490200	5495680	dependent features such as vendors and challenges using a trainer program or similar to gain
5495680	5499920	advantages within the game and use the gameplay altering programs such as aim bots or wall
5499920	5500920	hacks.
5500920	5501920	Hmm.
5501920	5502920	So, all right.
5502920	5509560	Don't you, they're out to mark you, um, uh, Shane and chat says, what even is Outriders?
5509560	5513600	Should I be excited for it and do the early download on Xbox series X?
5513600	5518280	Isn't it, is it, isn't it like a West, like a Western, but like robots kind of like loot
5518280	5519840	shooter type of thing in it.
5519840	5521320	Is that for my Square Enix?
5521320	5529640	Um, I don't necessarily, it looks a lot like, um, uh, like, I don't know, it looks a lot
5529640	5531960	like destiny two or something like that.
5531960	5538820	So I don't know if, what exactly it is per se, um, but it looks neat.
5538820	5542360	It is a cooperative third person role-playing game.
5542360	5545800	Um, and it's, uh, published by Square Enix in Europe.
5545800	5550280	Um, and they're saying it's a third person shooter, but it's mixed with elements from
5550280	5551720	role-playing games.
5551720	5555880	So you customize your characters and you choose from four classes, including the trickster,
5555880	5561080	the pyromancer, the Devastator, and the technomancer, um, and, uh, the basic skills you have have
5561080	5562080	a cool down time.
5562080	5565800	So again, that sounds very much like destiny, uh, and then a skill tree that you use to
5565800	5567480	unlock and upgrade skills.
5567480	5571080	You can use weapons like shotguns and, uh, assault rifles.
5571080	5576000	Um, and, um, well, you know, DJRMS says it's first person, not third.
5576000	5578960	It's interesting cause I'm reading off the like official little script thing.
5578960	5581480	So I don't know why they're classifying it that way.
5581480	5584720	Um, let's see, uh, there's various role-playing elements.
5584720	5588680	So you can explore different hub areas, talk to NPCs, do side missions.
5588680	5590280	There's dialogue trees.
5590280	5594000	That's something destiny doesn't have, uh, that can affect the outcome of some conversations.
5594000	5596780	You can play solo or with two other players.
5596780	5601480	And it's about humanities efforts to colonize Enoch, uh, where, uh, there was a massive
5601480	5605780	energy storm known as the anomaly, uh, which is, uh, supposed to be indicating hope for
5605780	5607240	humanities feature.
5607240	5610580	And that's where some of the, um, superpowers, I guess, come from.
5610580	5611580	So there you go.
5611580	5614300	Uh, Shane and chat says I can make a character.
5614300	5616860	I mean, that's probably enough for me to make me want to try it.
5616860	5617860	Yep.
5617860	5618860	You can.
5618860	5619860	All right.
5619860	5620860	Yeah.
5620860	5621860	I mean, it looks interesting.
5621860	5622860	Yeah.
5622860	5623860	I'll, I'll probably check it out.
5623860	5625900	I've been hearing good things about it based on the demo.
5626020	5627020	All right.
5627020	5628020	Uh, moving on to some other games.
5628020	5631940	So this is a game, uh, that's, uh, very popular is rocket league.
5631940	5632940	And it's kind of surprising.
5632940	5634220	We don't have it on mobile phones.
5634220	5637300	Well, we're going to be getting a version of it on mobile phones, kind of a different
5637300	5640420	sort of game, but it's going to be on iOS and Android.
5640420	5647500	Um, it's rocket league side swipe, and you can play in solo games in this or team up
5647500	5651140	with a friend or two, uh, for two, two versus two matches.
5651140	5653060	And those will last for two minutes each.
5653060	5656940	Uh, the perspective is a 2d side on view.
5656940	5657940	So it's a little bit different.
5657940	5661260	And that way you use touch controls that are a little bit easier to pick up.
5661260	5665500	So, uh, they're gonna hopefully do free to play kind of similar to how rocket league
5665500	5666500	is now.
5666500	5670180	So there's that, uh, DJ Rama S by the way, correcting himself in chat saying, yes, it
5670180	5671580	is third person.
5671580	5673380	All right.
5673380	5680120	Uh, also in rapid fire news, a ghost of Tsushima movie is coming with John wick directing.
5680120	5684360	So yeah, this is another big video game going into the movie territory.
5684360	5688300	And of course this one, a lot of, you know, game of the year types of awards.
5688300	5692720	So it's, it's maybe just surprising that the whole thing isn't a franchise yet becoming
5692720	5695560	a movie, but it's, uh, it's going to become a movie.
5695560	5701280	Uh, so Chad Stalski who made the John wick franchise, uh, or directed it, I should say
5701280	5702920	is going to be directing this.
5702920	5703920	So that's pretty cool.
5703920	5708040	A deadline, uh, reported on it and Sony confirmed it.
5708040	5709360	So pretty cool.
5709360	5714000	Of course, we have no idea when it's coming out, but, you know, give it two years.
5714000	5719560	Probably take a little while, especially, uh, with the pandemic still sort of like,
5719560	5720560	are we ending?
5720560	5723680	Are we not like still trying to figure out where that's all at.
5723680	5725240	All right.
5725240	5729240	So we've been experiencing a little bit of a technical difficulties live on Twitch.
5729240	5733120	Um, so we're going to pick up our show again here, sorry, going to create for a little
5733120	5737920	bit of an awkward podcast, but, uh, you know, Hey, at least, uh, we'll have a podcast this
5737920	5738800	week.
5738800	5743800	So I believe the, uh, recording started to, uh, get a little dicey when we were getting
5743800	5745080	into release dates.
5745080	5746080	So let's try that again.
5746080	5747080	Loki.
5747080	5749920	Uh, apparently we had a bumpy flight the first time let's travel around the world again and
5749920	5753760	check out some release dates starting in the U S there's too much Kingdom hearts for the
5753760	5756560	stream to handle clearly.
5756560	5762920	So this week we've gotten to me, uh, Neptunia virtual stars coming out on PC, Disco Elysium,
5762920	5768200	the final cut on PC, Mac, PlayStation four, PlayStation five and stadia.
5768200	5773520	We have evil genius to world domination, a whole bunch of Kingdom hearts.
5773520	5781440	So we've got Kingdom hearts, HD 1.5 remix, 2.5 remix, 2.8 final chapter prologue three
5781440	5786580	plus remind and melody of memory all coming out on PC.
5786580	5792640	We have Narita boy on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one rogue company
5792680	5799840	on PlayStation five, the binding of Isaac repentance on PC.
5799840	5808480	We have death crown on Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one and Tucci on PC, Nintendo
5808480	5810040	switch and Xbox one.
5810040	5811040	All right.
5811040	5816280	Well, before we had our little technical hiccup, a couple more things, uh, outriders and resident
5816280	5821520	evil seven biohazard, both coming to stadia outriders also coming out on PC PlayStation
5821520	5824680	four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series X.
5824680	5826680	Uh, do you have a price on Disco Elysium?
5826680	5833120	Paley Hanumaya and chat is wondering Disco Elysium, uh, on which system?
5833120	5837360	I mean, I assume it's all like 60 bucks, but let's see here.
5837360	5838360	I don't know.
5838360	5839960	What do I look like?
5839960	5844920	GameStop act deaf to chat is guessing this is what the internet is for.
5844920	5845920	Okay.
5845920	5846920	All right.
5846920	5847920	31 99.
5847920	5848920	All right.
5848920	5849920	Thank you.
5849920	5850920	All right.
5851320	5852760	Uh, traveling over to Japan.
5852760	5856120	So we were talking a little bit before the technical hiccups about outriders.
5856120	5858400	That is also coming out in Japan on April the first.
5858400	5860460	So that is coming out on the PlayStation five.
5860460	5863000	It is also coming out on the PlayStation four.
5863000	5865780	And quite honestly, that is really the only release this week.
5865780	5869280	It's a pretty, uh, uneventful week in Japan otherwise.
5869280	5870600	So let's move on to the UK.
5870600	5874360	Loki, uh, the UK, we didn't have a whole lot coming out.
5874360	5880320	We have also outriders coming out on PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox series X, Xbox
5880360	5883080	one and stadia.
5883080	5889520	And then we also got, um, monster truck, uh, it was like monster truck rally, which is
5889520	5893620	coming out on, uh, PlayStation four and Xbox one.
5893620	5898280	So, uh, as the show 100, Matt and chat wants to know when his battle totes coming out since
5898280	5903160	you were already at boat, but you can get it on game pass.
5903160	5904160	He can.
5904160	5905160	All right.
5905160	5906880	Uh, let's get back into some other news.
5906880	5907880	Uh, Loki.
5907880	5908880	Oh boy.
5908880	5909880	More rumors.
5909880	5910880	Boy, my favorite.
5910880	5911880	Yeah.
5911880	5916720	Well, it's, it's more adding onto the same rumors that we've already had, uh, regarding
5916720	5920880	an upgraded Nintendo switch that's coming out later this year, uh, according to a Bloomberg
5920880	5926040	report, they're saying that it's going to be powered by a new, uh, Nvidia system on
5926040	5932320	chip that's in the dock using to, uh, they're going to be using that chip to upscale the
5932320	5936680	graphics to four K and the way they're going to be doing that is kind of similar to how
5936680	5944440	the RTX, uh, graphics cards kind of do it right now, um, using DLSS, which is basically
5944440	5950260	a deep learning super sampling, which allows them to basically take a very, uh, low resolution
5950260	5957960	image and, um, use AI to sharpen it and also kind of enhance the, um, image altogether.
5957960	5960360	They I've some modern games have been using it.
5960360	5964660	Like for example, I know cyberpunk uses that, um, it looks nice.
5964660	5967020	So it is a pretty cool technology.
5967020	5971680	Um, along with that, there's some other rumors regarding the pricing.
5971680	5976940	They're saying that the pricing, not supposed to be about three 49 to three 99, uh, it's
5976940	5982980	supposed to be out sometime this year, but, uh, I'm wondering what the DLSS, if that'll
5982980	5987020	enable them to do, you know, be able to run some of these games that they haven't been
5987020	5988020	able to run already.
5988020	5992780	Um, but we'll have to see, I mean, that's really kind of just talking about the dock
5992780	5993780	right now.
5993900	5995740	Um, but that's all rumors.
5995740	6000420	I know I'm getting so tired of these switch pro rumors, like Nintendo read the room.
6000420	6003620	Like everybody is sleek in this stuff left and right.
6003620	6004620	Just give us something.
6004620	6008460	I think they will in June, if they don't announce something by June, then I don't know what
6008460	6010460	the hell's going on.
6010460	6012140	Yeah.
6012140	6014260	And I maybe, maybe April 1st.
6014260	6015260	Yeah.
6015260	6018660	I wouldn't believe anything you read on the internet on April 1st, but now it's getting
6018660	6022100	into this weird thing where like companies are actually doing things on April 1st, right?
6022100	6024180	Like Outriders is actually coming out April 1st.
6024180	6025180	That's not a joke.
6025180	6026180	It's a Friday.
6026180	6027180	Yeah.
6027180	6028180	Friday release date, I think.
6028180	6029180	No, that's not Friday.
6029180	6030180	That's a Thursday.
6030180	6031180	Why is it coming out on Thursday?
6031180	6032180	I don't know.
6032180	6033180	That's a weird day.
6033180	6034180	Yeah.
6034180	6035180	Should be the second.
6035180	6036180	So Wednesday is a holiday here in California.
6036180	6037180	So, uh, which is the 31st.
6037180	6038820	So I know April 1st is a Friday.
6038820	6039820	So yeah.
6039820	6041820	All right.
6041820	6044020	Anyway, let's move on.
6044020	6049140	Uh, actually Shane in chat, uh, says, I just want to see what exclusives look like on it.
6049180	6053660	Um, yeah, that would be, uh, the Nintendo first party games, the limited, uh, Mario
6053660	6054660	3D All-Stars.
6054660	6056020	You can no longer buy what it might look like.
6056020	6059380	Uh, Bobby Black Wolf is also pointing out Friday is Good Friday.
6059380	6060820	So that might be why.
6060820	6064240	So maybe they don't want to release a game on Good Friday cause there's, you know, people
6064240	6066540	that are, are partaking in religious service that day.
6066540	6067540	I don't know.
6067540	6068540	Who knows?
6068540	6072260	I wouldn't think it would be that many, but I guess, I guess so.
6072260	6073420	All right.
6073420	6078080	Let's move on to, I guess another rumor of sorts, although this one is being backed by
6078080	6079760	the wall street journal.
6079760	6083480	So there's probably some inside sources that are talking a little bit about this.
6083480	6089520	And that is that Microsoft is apparently in talks to acquire discord and the price tag
6089520	6092240	may set them back $10 billion.
6092240	6096840	Um, and the wall street journal is going off of other reports from venture beat and Bloomberg.
6096840	6102680	Uh, apparently these talks are being called advanced and exclusive and could result in
6102680	6104400	a deal next month.
6104400	6106000	However, it should be stated.
6106000	6107840	Nothing is set in stone.
6107840	6110080	Apparently there are other suitors out there as well.
6110080	6114120	I have heard, um, Amazon's name being thrown around as well, which, you know, as you know,
6114120	6115120	owns Twitch TV.
6115120	6117720	Um, and there was another big one that was getting thrown around too.
6117720	6123400	And discord may just go public, um, as a company because you know what fucking Roblox went
6123400	6125000	public not that long ago.
6125000	6126000	They've done pretty well for themselves.
6126000	6130480	Um, and there's been, you know, other entertainment gaming companies that have gone public, uh,
6130480	6131480	and are doing pretty well.
6131480	6133880	So discord may go that direction.
6134560	6140720	Microsoft is, according to Bloomberg, interested in looking at getting discord, um, as a place
6140720	6146480	to talk for the communities that are using it, not just the gamers on Xbox live.
6146480	6150080	That is also kind of interesting to know is that Microsoft may not be looking at this
6150080	6154560	as just a gaming platform, but certainly what's happened during the pandemic, you've seen
6154560	6158740	a lot of community growth on a place like discord and sure that goes things for like
6158740	6160040	video games and so forth.
6160040	6164760	We have our own discord here at vog network, cheap plug, fognetwork.com slash discord.
6164760	6169640	Um, but like D and D campaigns, which I suppose is also gaming, but then you also see other
6169640	6173600	like other types of communities coming together through discord.
6173600	6176840	Um, although certainly gaming is a huge part of that as well.
6176840	6180720	Loki, what do you think when you hear the news that Microsoft might acquire discord?
6180720	6185880	Cause I could see mixed opinions here because you know, Microsoft didn't really end up doing
6185880	6189520	the, the beam TV or mixer so well.
6189520	6194440	They ended up selling that I didn't go really very far, but then they've also bought LinkedIn
6194440	6198640	get hub and everybody was screaming with get hub that the sky is falling and it hasn't
6198640	6199640	really fallen yet.
6199640	6205040	So let's say this is true and Microsoft does opt to buy discord.
6205040	6207840	Do you think this is good for them and what are they going to do with it?
6207840	6213240	I hope they integrate it with Skype because that would suck, but other than that, I don't
6213240	6214240	know.
6214240	6215720	I hope it's a replacement for Skype.
6215720	6219760	Frankly, I'll worry about it when there's something to worry about.
6219760	6220760	That's true.
6220760	6223040	Um, that's, that's very true.
6223040	6226760	Um, dart to see you in chat says, initially I was concerned, but after listening to Bobby
6226760	6230440	tonight, I think I feel a little better about the situation, so maybe it won't be so bad.
6230440	6233960	And Bobby went really in depth on this in, on this subject on his show tonight.
6233960	6237020	And you know, he, he had kind of brought up some of those other examples about the websites
6237020	6239240	that Microsoft bought that have done okay.
6239240	6241840	And not everything is necessarily the sky is falling.
6242840	6247600	I can see though, where maybe something has to change when it comes to discord.
6247600	6251960	You know, where are they really making money right now off of those nitro subscriptions
6251960	6254400	that aren't really required.
6254400	6259520	And how many people in those communities are really paying for those subscriptions?
6259520	6260920	Probably not a ton.
6260920	6266000	Um, I pay for it cause I want to boost the VoG network server because you know, that
6266000	6269720	should be something that, you know, we do to lift up the server and Bobby got into this
6269720	6273720	on this show, if VoG network is a business could just pay 20 bucks a month or whatever
6273720	6275080	to boost our server.
6275080	6276460	We would do that, but we can't.
6276460	6280880	So I have, I have discord pro just because I use discord a lot and I want to boost the
6280880	6284000	VoG server to at least the next level.
6284000	6287840	Um, but where would Microsoft really make money?
6287840	6293240	I think we would all be very upset if we saw them go up like to a place where Slack went,
6293240	6296680	where you have to pay to have a server or you're going to start losing messages.
6296680	6300240	You get really annoyed by all the prompts that start coming up.
6300240	6302200	So I don't really see that happening either.
6302200	6307140	And one thing that kind of occurred to me and I was always really surprised by this.
6307140	6311480	Do you remember when discord launched a game store and then they tried to do their own
6311480	6314200	game pass type of thing as well through nitro?
6314200	6319600	I was really surprised that didn't do so well because I thought it was a brilliant idea
6319600	6326300	that discord kind of stealth and solved itself onto all of these systems and on your phone
6326300	6330620	as, Hey, this great free messaging app, but as we know, nothing's really free.
6330620	6335680	So I thought by putting that store on there, that's how they were going to really make
6335680	6340880	some money was basically like they, they, they got something that people wanted to put
6340880	6341880	on their computers.
6341880	6343820	Unlike when steam first came out.
6343820	6347960	If you guys remember when steam first came out, people were pissed that you like had
6347960	6348960	to have that to play.
6348960	6351940	I think it was like half life two at the time.
6351940	6357320	So I really wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft does acquire discord, that they may try to
6357320	6361800	do something with their store in it, but then they say they don't necessarily want it to
6361800	6365340	be tied to gamers, but I just, I would have a hard time believing they wouldn't try to
6365340	6371280	sell some of their products directly there through the application and do some tie-ins
6371280	6372280	there.
6372280	6376880	Loki, how do you think discord could be profitable?
6376880	6381520	I mean, integrating it with game pass would be good if they could, you know, if Microsoft
6381520	6385480	does end up purchasing them.
6385480	6386480	I don't know.
6386480	6392860	I mean, I think definitely giving more power to the folks that have servers and allowing
6392860	6397720	them to upgrade them, however they need, you know, whether that be, you know, adding additional
6397720	6406340	bandwidth to the video or, you know, other features that may be in there, I don't know.
6406340	6412540	Does discord have any sort of like searchability or ways to actually have like stuff displayed?
6412540	6416860	Because like, I know there's like billions of different, I can't imagine billions, but
6416860	6420780	like probably several hundred thousand servers out there.
6420780	6425180	I think if you're like a discord partner or affiliate or something that you apply for,
6425180	6430340	you can get listed in some type of directory that they have, but not every server is by
6430340	6432060	default in this directory.
6432060	6435020	It's something that you apply for.
6435820	6439180	Now Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I still think they're going to try to make discord
6439180	6440700	with Xbox party chat.
6440700	6441980	That would be pretty cool.
6441980	6444180	You want me to take that one step further?
6444180	6448940	Because here's where I tell you where a Microsoft and discord partnership gets really fucking
6448940	6449940	exciting.
6449940	6453540	I'll give you an example that goes a step beyond that that just occurred to me.
6453540	6459060	With Microsoft getting really into this cloud gaming thing, what if I could sit here in
6459060	6464100	my home, Loki sits there in his home, and through discord now showing us a screen of
6464100	6468580	the game we're playing, we're now playing a game online together through the cloud thanks
6468580	6471880	to discord that's embedded in our community.
6471880	6475300	And that streaming technology, which is the only thing Microsoft kept from their whole
6475300	6478340	beam acquisition.
6478340	6485820	I mean, it's an awful lot of wishes and gosh, I hope it goes the way I want it to and maybe
6485820	6491580	not enough reality check, but I don't know, Phil Spencer's pretty cool, but he won't be
6491580	6495580	the head of discord, sadly, and especially with Microsoft saying it's not all about gaming.
6495580	6501500	I don't know, but I think that would be a pretty cool thing to be frank.
6501500	6502500	We'll see.
6502500	6507480	Now, a lot of people are bringing up Microsoft teams, which is a little bit more of a direct
6507480	6511500	Slack competitor and people are wondering if there could be emerging here.
6511500	6514780	I still see teams as more of a professional type of thing, sort of like LinkedIn as a
6514780	6516380	professional social network.
6516380	6521780	I'm not sure that would fit the bill, but maybe Microsoft is totally okay having like
6521780	6526180	your daytime chat app and your nighttime chat app.
6526180	6531660	I prefer discord over teams.
6531660	6536380	Discord is much snappier than teams as teams feels very bloaty and heavy.
6536380	6543940	I just, I would prefer if given the choice between using teams or discord, I would go
6543940	6544940	discord 100%.
6544940	6547380	Well, and then maybe that's something that Microsoft wants to get in on.
6547380	6548380	I don't know.
6548380	6553700	SG100map says, regardless, we won't see the full effects of the purchase until 18 months
6553700	6556260	after the sale, which will take a while.
6556260	6557300	We will see.
6557300	6558300	We will see.
6558300	6562380	Bonds006 says, if only they allow me to do that, as you said it, Rob, but right, yeah,
6562380	6566640	I know I'm doing a lot of wishful thinking, but I'm trying to also present some scenarios
6566640	6570620	that I'd like to think are realistic without necessarily being doom and gloom.
6570620	6575380	And that would be, oh, Microsoft buy something else just to close it.
6575380	6576380	I still don't understand.
6576380	6578820	Well, no, I do understand why they closed Mixer.
6578820	6583500	They had a really hard time attracting the volume of the other places because, and it's
6583500	6584700	just this simple.
6584700	6589220	Anybody that wants to go up against Twitch, take notes.
6589220	6595060	If you don't have a way for your broadcasters to make money and they see a path to being
6595060	6599140	able to make money and advertise and may enable revenue on their streams and stuff, you can
6599140	6601340	have a real hard time attracting talent.
6601340	6605220	And that was the problem with Mixer, period.
6605220	6609620	Now some people preferred Mixer because as an Xbox centric platform, it was a little
6609620	6612660	easier to get noticed over there in a different type of community.
6612660	6615440	So you can kind of stick out in a smaller community.
6615440	6616440	And I respect that.
6616440	6619940	And again, I have great friends who are broadcasting on Mixer and so forth.
6619940	6624900	But the reality was Mixer was always going to lag behind Twitch because Twitch has a
6624900	6628300	very easy path for their broadcasters.
6628300	6630960	Not easy, but you know what it is.
6630960	6635140	You know what the rules are and you have your little goals and the goalposts is right there
6635140	6636320	and you know what you got to do.
6636320	6637320	And it's achievable.
6637320	6643120	Whereas, sure, Mixer had a path to partner, it wasn't an easy thing to do at all, especially
6643120	6645580	on a smaller kind of network.
6645580	6651980	The good news here is that if Microsoft buys Discord, there's nothing bigger than Discord
6651980	6652980	right now.
6652980	6653980	There really isn't.
6653980	6657540	As far as nighttime chat apps and groups, some may say, well, Slack is really a bigger
6657540	6658540	thing.
6658540	6664100	And I think when it comes to these types of hobbyist, gaming hobbyist, arts and crafts
6664100	6668380	hobbyists and the things we've really relied on during the pandemic, Discord is the huge
6668380	6669720	thing right now.
6669720	6674620	And so it'll be really hard for Microsoft to fuck that up, but we'll see.
6674620	6675660	All right.
6675660	6677980	At least it's not Google buying them.
6677980	6680340	Yeah, that's true.
6680340	6685740	SG100Matt in chat says, we talked a sec ago about Nintendo not reading The Room.
6685740	6689500	I think Microsoft is reading The Room and I feel like they will leave the gamer part
6689500	6692700	of Discord alone and use it in other systems.
6692700	6693700	Hmm.
6693700	6694700	We'll see.
6694700	6697700	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, at least it's not Facebook buying them.
6697700	6698700	We can say that again.
6698700	6699700	All right.
6699700	6700700	Oh, yeah.
6700700	6701700	I'll be horrible.
6701700	6702700	All right.
6702700	6703700	Let's move on.
6703700	6704700	Loki.
6704700	6705700	All right.
6705700	6710460	Well, speaking of playing games with other people, Steam had this brand, this kind of
6710460	6715860	hidden update that they did recently to their remote play together.
6715860	6721940	So remote play together, if you may remember, was the way to basically invite a friend that
6721940	6727100	may not own a game that you have on Steam to come play with you kind of like couch co-op
6727100	6728100	type of thing.
6728100	6733340	Well, now they've updated it to where now not only can you invite someone that doesn't
6733340	6737920	have the game, but you can also invite someone that doesn't have Steam installed on their
6737920	6739480	computer.
6739480	6744560	So allows anybody to basically join you and play together remotely.
6744560	6746940	Right now, there's about a thousand games supporting it.
6746940	6748640	Not everything supports it.
6748640	6752460	Only the games that do support remote play together.
6752460	6757540	But like I said, there's over thousands of games already that support this.
6757540	6760000	So that's pretty amazing.
6760000	6761680	Pretty neat feature to see what's going on.
6761680	6762680	And they have a Steam sale right now.
6762680	6765740	So, you know, go check that out.
6765740	6770480	It's really funny that this story follows the Discord thing after that scenario I just
6770480	6779200	proposed, because now here is Steam kind of doing that, but not with a community focus.
6779200	6785120	I mean, sure, there are communities on Steam, like VoG has a community on Steam, but are
6785120	6787360	people really using them?
6787360	6791160	PlayStation had communities built into it, but was anyone really using it?
6791160	6792160	No.
6792160	6793160	So they closed it.
6793160	6795560	That's what's making Discord so appealing.
6795560	6800080	It has built communities in a way that no other gaming platform has been able to, that's
6800080	6801080	for sure.
6801080	6803540	And thanks to the pandemic, it's gone way beyond gaming.
6803540	6807660	Sorry, I don't mean to completely go revert to the last story, but it's interesting that
6807660	6811580	there is that similarity here about the whole, well, Steam is now allowing this whole playing
6811580	6812620	together thing.
6812620	6818360	It's a bummer they don't have the real community behind it besides the friend list to really
6818360	6819980	push this forward.
6819980	6820980	Yeah.
6821960	6825960	That's still pretty cool though, that they have that available.
6825960	6830480	I don't know where I'd use that, but I have lots of games that probably support it.
6830480	6831480	Yeah.
6831480	6836320	So, yeah, pretty cool feature though, especially if your friends don't have Steam or maybe
6836320	6840920	can't install Steam or whatever, a good way for them to look into that.
6840920	6842040	All right.
6842040	6844720	And I believe this is our last story that's slated for tonight.
6844720	6849840	And this one's kind of, oh boy, Crash Bandicoot 4 just came out.
6849900	6855700	And since it's an Activision game, they use the Battle.net app, which is part of Blizzard,
6855700	6860500	which is now part of Activision, right, to get Crash Bandicoot 4 out there.
6860500	6867380	But something they weren't very forward with, Crash Bandicoot 4 requires Always Online.
6867380	6870180	Crash Bandicoot 4, by the way, is a single player game.
6870180	6873500	And there is no multiplayer mode that I'm aware of in Crash Bandicoot 4.
6873500	6875340	I don't think they added one in or anything like that.
6875340	6877180	It is a single player game.
6877180	6882720	But yet it requires an internet connection to play on PC, which most of the Battle.net
6882720	6886720	games do to be fair, but also the Battle.net games are almost all online.
6886720	6889920	I would expect I have to be online to play World of Warcraft.
6889920	6891640	I would expect to play Starcraft.
6891640	6895800	I probably need to be online, especially if I'm going to play with other people.
6895800	6897300	And this goes a step further.
6897300	6899240	Now people are getting error messages.
6899240	6903000	So like Diablo's infamous Error 37, yep, this is happening to people that are playing
6903000	6904420	Crash Bandicoot 4.
6904420	6908880	They can't log in to the single player game that they purchased because Battle.net's having
6908880	6909880	issues.
6909880	6915040	Authentication servers are being overloaded, and this makes the game unplayable.
6915040	6920180	Now something else to say here.
6920180	6921180	Why would they do this?
6921180	6923240	Oh, well, to avoid piracy, right?
6923240	6927380	They don't want people to pirate the game because then pirates wouldn't be able to get
6927380	6929720	around this Always Online requirement.
6929720	6931460	Guess what?
6931460	6934960	Pirates have already gotten around this Always Online requirement.
6934960	6942140	So now we have a case where the piracy version of the game is, in a way, superior to the
6942140	6948200	actual version of the game because it'll actually connect.
6948200	6951320	The retail version of the game won't let you play it right now.
6951320	6954420	Well, sometimes won't let you play it.
6954420	6957560	Right this minute, I'm sure it's fine, but there were certainly issues during this week.
6957560	6960000	Pirated version didn't have that problem.
6960060	6961060	Oops.
6962420	6967500	What was Activision thinking giving a single player game Always Online DRM?
6967500	6969500	Loki, any thoughts?
6969500	6971940	They just don't care.
6971940	6974300	They're just trying to make all the money that they can.
6974300	6975620	I don't know.
6975620	6978380	Maybe they had...
6978380	6983720	I can't imagine there's that many people, like there'd be that much piracy with a Crash
6983720	6988940	Bandicoot game like that, considering also this version just came out.
6988940	6994720	I think the other versions have been out for a while now, so it's like, I don't know.
6994720	6998400	It's silly, but now this just tarnishes their PC.
6998400	7002280	This is embarrassing for a company that doesn't need any more embarrassment right now.
7002280	7003280	Exactly.
7003280	7004280	Well, it's not even so much...
7004280	7007560	That has not exactly been on an uptick lately.
7007560	7012000	And it's not even so much like that Crash Bandicoot 4 or anything.
7012000	7016640	It's always going to be like, people are now going to second guess any Activision games
7016640	7017640	that come to PC.
7017640	7018640	Is this going to be Always Online?
7019340	7020340	Especially Battle.net.
7020340	7021340	Is this one going to be Always Online?
7021340	7025940	You know, it's like, it's just, it's not good.
7025940	7028000	But they don't care because they're going to make money.
7028000	7033020	It is worth saying, Diablo 2 Resurrected is on many people's radar, right?
7033020	7035660	Because that is something that Blizzard announced that got people excited.
7035660	7037400	It will be on the Battle.net app.
7037400	7043940	Blizzard did say that this Diablo 2 Resurrected is playable offline.
7043940	7048340	It will not require the Always Online connection, which you may recall was a very controversial
7048340	7050860	part of Diablo 3 when it first came out.
7050860	7051860	But I digress.
7051860	7053440	This Diablo 2 remaster.
7053440	7058340	And the way Blizzards really explain this is that they really are putting an HD shell
7058340	7059780	over their old games.
7059780	7062480	So in a way, it kind of doesn't surprise me.
7062480	7068160	But yeah, they have explicitly said, and maybe that's still the part of Blizzard that's cool
7068160	7072820	versus the part of Activision that's never been cool.
7072820	7075120	So maybe that's kind of that coming to head.
7075120	7076120	I don't know.
7076120	7077120	Maybe.
7077120	7081320	FatNinjaDM in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says, that's the problem.
7081320	7083040	They weren't thinking.
7083040	7086300	Dart Satsuya says, does Battle.net have any other single player stuff?
7086300	7090580	I mean, I can understand the DRM for the other multiplayer games, since you need net anyway,
7090580	7091960	but that does seem a bit extreme.
7091960	7095040	One could argue that Diablo 3 doesn't have to be online.
7095040	7099280	You can play it single player mode.
7099280	7102320	I guess the same would be true of Starcraft, quite frankly.
7102320	7108360	Although certainly the Blizzard games are usually more inclined to be player versus
7108360	7110080	online and all that.
7110080	7113560	Their recent arcade collection, though, that just came out when they did their virtual
7113560	7116160	BlizzCon, that shouldn't need to be online.
7116160	7118160	I don't know if it is or not.
7118160	7120240	I haven't looked.
7120240	7124800	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, they might have tried to, but some extensive stat tracking
7124800	7130240	in Crash 4 that requires a connection to the home server, which is a terrible idea.
7130240	7134820	But I know a lot of games do keep track of how you play and phone home the anonymized
7134820	7138440	stats of your PlayStation play session.
7138440	7143140	So, all right, let's move on.
7143140	7144220	That's it for stories.
7144220	7145980	We're going to get to the listener roundtable.
7145980	7149360	If you have some other comments or questions for us in chat, get them out there.
7149360	7152020	Otherwise I'm going to go to the mailbag because I know we have at least one email tonight
7152020	7153280	that I saw come through.
7153280	7155080	Loki, I don't have the email up right now.
7155080	7157640	So you have any last minute stories for us?
7157640	7166880	I don't, unfortunately, you know, it wasn't a whole ton going on this week, but yeah,
7166880	7173800	I'm just still waiting for more game announcements and the death of Mario next week.
7173800	7176200	We do have a comment in our chat.
7176200	7182320	We do have a comment in chat from IceP1 who says, looks like Eve Online will be allowing
7182320	7185160	playing straight in the browser in the future.
7185160	7187700	And so eveonline.com if you want more information.
7187700	7189340	So there's no install needed.
7189340	7191980	In other news, work productivity drops.
7191980	7196020	And Bobby Blackwell cracks the joke about it's pretty easy to do spreadsheets in a browser
7196020	7200040	because some people have called Eve Online like a spreadsheets game, although obviously
7200040	7202140	there are more intricacies than that.
7202140	7206360	But that's pretty cool about playing in a browser because, I mean, when you think about
7206360	7210360	what was one of the big things that Google Stadia was pitching, you're going to be able
7210360	7212640	to stream games from the cloud in the browser.
7212680	7216240	So it's interesting that some games are kind of implementing this in their own way without
7216240	7218080	needing a Google Stadia.
7218080	7221840	Do you think we'll see more companies kind of do that, kind of just do their own cloud
7221840	7225520	gaming thing because they don't really trust the other companies to do it?
7225520	7228640	I don't know if it's necessarily they don't trust the other companies to do it because
7228640	7236520	certain companies are locking down their app stores so that they have to create browser
7236520	7237520	based applications.
7237520	7240840	And I also want to be very clear, this Eve thing I don't think is actually a cloud thing.
7240840	7242200	It's just playable in your browser.
7242200	7243200	So I do want to be clear.
7243200	7248700	Yeah, I mean, because they're kind of forced to do that, you know, to get around certain
7248700	7251680	restrictions with Apple in their app store.
7251680	7255280	So yeah, I could see him doing that.
7255280	7256280	All right.
7256280	7257320	I got our email up.
7257320	7259600	So we do have one email tonight.
7259600	7263400	If you want to send emails, participate at orangelawnsradio.com is the place to send
7263400	7264400	emails.
7264400	7269360	Tonight's email is Frodo Swagins, who writes, Hey, all super short email.
7269360	7271040	I'm a podcast listener.
7271040	7273440	The game It Takes Two just came out.
7273440	7274440	OMG.
7274440	7275440	It's super cute and fun.
7275440	7277600	I've never seen a cooperative game like this before.
7277600	7278920	I can't sit it down.
7278920	7281120	I'm not going to review it here.
7281120	7282120	You kind of did.
7282120	7283120	But that's OK.
7283120	7285400	I mean, you gave it a positive thing.
7285400	7286400	That's all right.
7286400	7287560	We appreciate the feedback.
7287560	7292640	I'm not going to review it here, but I hope if you haven't already, grab a friend and
7292640	7293640	try it out.
7293640	7294640	I have to make sense.
7294640	7296680	I haven't played It Takes Two.
7296680	7298480	I've seen it because I think it's on Game Pass.
7298480	7300240	Have you played this at all?
7300440	7301440	I have not.
7301440	7302440	Chat, help us out.
7302440	7305440	Anybody playing It Takes Two like our emailer tonight?
7305440	7308200	Curious what your thoughts are on It Takes Two.
7308200	7309760	Maybe someone in chat has played.
7309760	7310760	Thank you.
7310760	7311760	You know what?
7311760	7312760	You can host next week's show.
7312760	7313760	How about that?
7313760	7314760	All right.
7314760	7315760	I'm just teasing.
7315760	7319600	Also, I noticed you don't take live calls anymore in the green room.
7319600	7321840	I've been meaning to ask how come.
7321840	7325160	And that is from Frodo Swagins in Portland, Oregon.
7325160	7326920	Well, hello, Portland.
7326920	7328840	I haven't been in about 11 years now.
7328840	7331760	I really need to get back to Portland.
7331760	7334040	So why don't we take calls on Discord anymore?
7334040	7340280	It's because of the remote broadcasting versus when we were all in the same studio.
7340280	7342920	We're kind of not set up for it the same way.
7342920	7349080	I probably could do some presto change-o and change some things and have the other person.
7349080	7352720	But the thing we've noticed when we've done some guest appearances and things is that
7352720	7357960	when we have more people on Discord, the frame lag starts to come in and the show starts
7357960	7360280	to have some technical issues behind the scenes.
7360280	7365080	So just basically long story short, technically, the bandwidth hasn't really worked out because
7365080	7369440	we've been using all the Discord stuff so that we can tape remotely and still do our
7369440	7370440	show.
7370440	7377080	The good news is Loki's vaccinated, I'm vaccinated, Dark Sakura's vaccinated or getting there.
7377080	7378080	We've started the...
7378080	7381480	Well, Loki's closer than any of us having the one and done shot, but we're all in that
7381480	7382740	process right now.
7382740	7388300	So feasibly, in a few weeks, we can look at maybe returning to the studio if everybody
7388300	7389660	feels comfortable with that.
7389660	7393100	However, I do have the issue where somebody else who lives here has still not been able
7393100	7394100	to get vaccinated.
7394100	7400660	However, California said by April 15th, that will be a long issue.
7400660	7404180	So my hope is, and I'm just gonna throw this out there, I've talked to Loki about it, I
7404180	7405620	haven't talked to Dark Sakura about it.
7405620	7413900	My hope is June, specifically June 23rd, and whatever Sunday is closest to that, I haven't
7413900	7418620	looked at, that day, I think we may make a...
7418620	7422740	That would be a great day for us to come back together.
7422740	7426020	We will all be well fully vaccinated by that point.
7426020	7429140	I think it will just be a matter of where is COVID at in the world.
7429140	7431500	Technically we could probably actually do it before June.
7431500	7435380	I'm just saying that's a very nice day, right, Loki?
7435380	7439260	That would be a nice day to be back together again would be on our anniversary, right?
7439260	7440660	We are starting over.
7440660	7442260	I think would be a good little tagline for...
7442260	7443260	Where have I heard that before?
7443260	7448560	That would be a good little tagline for our show.
7448560	7451620	That just depends on COVID and how all that's going.
7451620	7456300	CDC has said vaccinated people can hang out together without masks.
7456300	7460260	By that day in June, we will well be vaccinated without masks.
7460260	7469820	I think the whole decision is COVID still threatening the variants and all of that,
7469820	7472620	I think is the factor we still have to figure out.
7472620	7476180	Bobby Blackwell says, the 23rd is a Wednesday, how convenient.
7476180	7481700	So June 20th or 27th, fine, I will opt for the earlier day and do the 20th and say that
7481700	7487260	right now on paper, that's the day I really want us to be able to come back into studio.
7487260	7488260	Maybe sooner.
7488260	7493540	We might just do May if things seem like it's gonna work that way.
7493540	7497980	So anyway, I know that's kind of a long winded question that went a little tangentially for
7497980	7500560	what you would really ask Frodo Swagons.
7500560	7504900	But I guess my answer is it's not gonna be that way much longer, because I really want
7504900	7508180	us to be back all in the same studio the way we used to do it.
7508180	7510240	That would be great.
7510240	7512380	And that's that.
7512380	7513380	See other comments in chat.
7513380	7515380	SG100 Matt says, maybe early summer.
7515380	7517060	Yeah, who knows?
7517060	7519540	I just like that June date because it's nice.
7519540	7524740	But I suppose we could always do the end of May, which is technically when the live 365
7524740	7525740	stations started.
7525740	7528840	Because remember, we were running that station for about a month before we actually started
7528840	7529840	our show.
7529840	7532020	So I don't know, we'll see.
7532020	7536260	Tiger class says tomorrow, they're going to allow people 40 years and older to be vaccinated.
7536260	7538000	That just depends on where you live.
7538000	7541220	So our show is based in California, Sacramento to be exact.
7541220	7544520	I think you guys know that I've said that a lot of times on the show.
7544520	7549840	And here in the state of California, 50 and over, we'll be able to be vaccinated on April
7549840	7551200	1st.
7551200	7555320	And then everybody else on April 15th.
7555320	7557360	But again, the three hosts are already vaccinated.
7557360	7563840	Alan is the only one who can't get his Kaiser appointment to get it done.
7563840	7566600	The system won't let him do it yet.
7566600	7569280	Bobby Blackwell says June 1st is Vogg's birthday.
7569280	7570840	So yeah, there's other dates that make sense.
7570840	7577360	So just so you know where my brain is at, I'm hoping in the next couple months, we finally
7577360	7578360	are able to come together again.
7578360	7580360	And I think that'll be a very nice thing.
7580360	7581920	So we'll see.
7581920	7583540	All right.
7583540	7585040	And we didn't have any last minute stories, right?
7585040	7587120	So I think we are towards the end of the show.
7587120	7592680	One more shout out for the mailbag, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
7592680	7594220	That brings us towards the end of the show.
7594220	7595960	Thank you guys for listening to the show tonight.
7595960	7599560	I know it was a little rough live with the technical hiccups, but you guys are awesome.
7599560	7600600	You stuck with it anyway.
7600600	7602160	Thank you so much for that.
7602160	7604320	Podcast listeners, there may be a little delay.
7604320	7606880	You might not get the show right at the same time you usually do.
7606880	7609520	Just know it's because I had to kind of stitch some things together.
7609520	7612140	Tonight's going to be a little bit of a Frankenstein episode.
7612140	7613140	But these things happen.
7613140	7617280	Thank you as well, podcast folks, for being here and being with us every week.
7617280	7618280	We appreciate that.
7618280	7622320	Emails, tweets at OLR, all the ways you want to interact with us.
7622320	7623580	We really appreciate that.
7623580	7626280	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lodge Radio, tell a friend or two about the
7626280	7627280	show.
7627280	7629600	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
7629600	7632840	But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, what else are we going to be able
7632840	7633840	to do?
7633840	7635360	So, yes, please, please help us spread the word.
7635360	7638280	That would be very appreciated.
7638280	7639600	What else was I going to say with all that?
7639600	7640600	Discord.
7640600	7644520	I guess I've plugged that a lot tonight, vognetwork.com slash discord.
7644520	7648280	If you feel so generous and you want to buy some merchandise, we do have a shop available
7648280	7652840	vognetwork.com slash shop if you are so inclined.
7652840	7654480	With that, I think we can get to final thoughts.
7654480	7657640	I think that's all the plugs I'm supposed to give at the end of the show.
7657640	7659840	Thank you to Alan once again for filling in last minute.
7659840	7665320	Thank you Chatroom for being patient tonight through all the Techhicups and always being
7665320	7666920	a great support of the show.
7666920	7670720	Loki, I will send it to you for your final thought.
7670720	7675940	My final thought is I'm going to try to work more of my game.
7675940	7681200	It's already almost to the point where I could probably put it out physically, but I just
7681200	7684520	want to cram some more stuff in there.
7684520	7687440	My final thought is I'm going to work on being a better killer.
7687440	7689440	I sure am.
7689440	7691340	In Dead by Daylight, of course.
7691340	7697000	And I still have some additional things for VOG floating around in my head.
7697000	7699880	And I hope I get my ass in gear to do that real soon.
7699880	7702280	There's just a lot of other stuff going on personally, too.
7702280	7705400	But things are looking bright over the next couple of months.
7705400	7706400	Hang in there.
7706400	7709440	We're almost to the end of this pandemic, but get your vacs when you can.
7709440	7710440	Keep masking up.
7710440	7711640	Stay safe.
7711640	7712640	We're going to get there.
7712640	7713640	Damn it.
7713760	7714920	All right.
7714920	7715920	Have a good night, everybody.
7715920	7716920	We'll see you next week.
7743640	7747880	See you next week.
7773640	7776760	See you next time.
