00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,520
This week, I learned that the PlayStation Store is still available for PSPs, PSVitas,

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,600
and PS3s, which make Sony way more legacy compatible than any other console manufacturer,

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,600
at least until this summer.

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,080
On a related note, if you still have a PSP or PSVita, please check its battery.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,380
There were reports of battery swelling sometime back and now is still as good a time as any

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,080
to make sure that yours hasn't.

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,820
Swelling batteries are an awful chemical and or fire hazard.

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,380
This is one story of the gaming world that was.

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,380
Join your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki for more on this and the rest of

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,780
the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,340
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

12
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,340
Welcome back.

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,340
It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

14
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:54,620
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again here with episode number 862 of

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,040
our show for this March the 28th of 2021.

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,380
My name is Rob Roberts and sadly not joining me tonight, Dark Sakura or Jamie Sommers.

17
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,680
She is not here.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
Good news and bad news.

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,320
The good news is she got the vaccine yesterday.

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,320
She got her first shot.

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,740
She got the Pfizer shot.

22
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,440
And so that's great news.

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,640
The bad news is she's having some side effects where she's kind of headachy and fatigue.

24
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,940
So she thought it would be best that she sit tonight show tonight's show out.

25
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,680
But again, you know, even though there are side effects to the vaccine, sometimes people

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,680
get them.

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,680
Sometimes people don't.

28
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,100
We would still always encourage you to get the vaccine and help us end the COVID pandemic

29
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,040
because whatever she's going through right now is certainly a lot better than actually

30
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,060
having COVID itself.

31
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,920
So anyway, say hello as well.

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,120
Joining me every week on the show.

33
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,120
Tech master.

34
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,120
Loki.

35
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,120
Hello.

36
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,120
Hi, Loki.

37
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,120
Hey, how's it going?

38
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,120
Good.

39
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,440
What's what's the game playing behind you tonight?

40
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
I'm trying to figure it out.

41
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,520
And it's like I can't see the main character very well.

42
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,280
It's like I'm having a hard time telling what it is.

43
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,200
I'm sure if you just looked at the enemies, you'd figure it out.

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,460
I can't see the enemies.

45
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,460
They're not showing.

46
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, it's too far away for me to really make them out.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,400
Well, it's entered the Gungeon.

48
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,040
Oh, it is interesting.

49
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,380
OK, nice.

50
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:16,000
Is that a selection due to the PlayStation, whatever they're calling it?

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,880
Stay at home and we'll give you free games thing that's going on right now.

52
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,920
No, it's because I was going to do Katamari because they have the shirt on, but they realized

53
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,000
they'd already done that.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So gotcha.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,240
I'm going to do enter the Gungeon.

56
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,520
Well, that's if he didn't say you'd already done it, nobody probably would have picked

57
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
up on it.

58
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,520
So.

59
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
All right.

60
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,960
Anyway, I do think it's kind of funny, though.

61
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,560
I know we'd kind of like joked about it on the show previously, but it is kind of interesting

62
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,920
that you got your Johnson and Johnson shot.

63
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,000
I got my Moderna shot and confirmed Jamie got the Pfizer shot this week.

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,120
So we have one of each in the house.

65
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,360
The Holy Trinity.

66
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
Exactly.

67
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,040
The Holy Trinity is complete.

68
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,240
Anyway, I also want to say a big hello to everybody in our chat room, because we do

69
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,800
tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network

70
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,400
every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby

71
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,760
Blackwell show.

72
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,460
Bobby's in our chat right now saying, oh, man, I totally forgot to remind everyone it's

73
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,200
close to the end of the month.

74
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,040
So check your data cap and download game pass games or the play at home games before the

75
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,480
end of the month.

76
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,080
Very true point.

77
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,040
I know for myself, I want to pre download hopefully I have the bandwidth for it.

78
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,040
I should.

79
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,160
But we're we're cutting it close now that Alan's doing the streaming all the time.

80
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:36,080
But I want to get the Outriders pre install before it unlocks on the first if I can fit

81
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,960
that into this month's bandwidth, that would be great.

82
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,880
Is that a game that's on your radar at all?

83
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,880
Loki?

84
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,880
No.

85
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,080
Oh, well, that's too bad.

86
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,200
Is there anything anything upcoming that's on your radar?

87
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
Not really.

88
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Actually.

89
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:58,280
Well, you know what's going off the radar is Mario.

90
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,360
And I think this is really funny where the Internet's going with this, because, you know,

91
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,240
this is the week we're just days away from what the Internet is now calling the death

92
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:13,080
of Mario or Mario's execution, because all of course, Mario 35 is getting pulled.

93
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,760
Super Mario All Stars 3D is getting pulled.

94
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,640
And, you know, all those limited time games are going to disappear as of March 31st, because

95
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,400
Nintendo done told you it's limited and they meant it unless you had a retail code.

96
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,480
Those will still continue to work past March 31st.

97
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah, like, I don't know, I already have them.

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,920
So it's fine.

99
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,200
I didn't really play Mario 35 too much, but the other ones already have.

100
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,880
So in fact, we actually picked up because, like I said, my kids were as we mentioned,

101
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,080
I think it was last week we were talking about Shane, the shiny hunter and Pokemon

102
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
journeys.

103
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
Yes.

104
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,520
So since my kids have been watching that every time they go over to the grandmother's house,

105
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:57,240
I went ahead and picked up Pokemon sword for my son so he can play through the campaign

106
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,420
that's basically shown off in the the show.

107
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,240
So I'm sure our own shiny Hunter Shane would approve of that purchase.

108
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,240
Yeah.

109
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,680
So yeah, I don't know.

110
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,200
But yeah, the Mario stuff that we've already gotten all all of that.

111
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,240
So it's not a big deal.

112
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,360
It's still stupid, though.

113
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:22,000
I have to say I was able to hold the line and I never bought Mario 3D All Stars and

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,880
I'm totally okay with that decision.

115
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,520
I did play a little bit of Mario 35 and I enjoyed that.

116
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,480
I'm a little less irritated with that one because I can also kind of understand how

117
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,960
the audience for that game was probably going to fade pretty quick.

118
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,640
I think it would soften the blow an awful lot if Nintendo would announce some sort of

119
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,000
replacement.

120
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,640
And I'm not saying it has to be Zelda 35.

121
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:52,800
But some type of, you know, Nintendo online pass or whatever game to sort of lessen the

122
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,120
burden of or lessen the burn of losing the game that we're losing, I think would would

123
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,400
really make people maybe a lot less angry.

124
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,400
I don't know.

125
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,600
Yeah, I think that would help.

126
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,440
But like, I don't know why they're doing it in the first place.

127
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,760
And then I think it's kind of funny is one of the things that was on there that is limited

128
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:20,840
or quote unquote limited was that plane watch handheld thing and the local target that I

129
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,840
go to.

130
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,320
They've got like stacks of those really mean they were flying off the shelf at one time,

131
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,740
but now they've got like at least 10 of them.

132
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,880
So interesting.

133
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,080
I always look at him like, nah, I don't want it.

134
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,380
But somebody does and they're out there.

135
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,400
I'm kind of with the break man in chat, ugh, that thing is so overpriced.

136
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,880
Although I did see a comment from Tiger Claw earlier where he ran out and got one.

137
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,760
So again, it's it's all about what do you want to spend your money on?

138
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,080
You know, I buy a lot of these little tiny collectible actually I have one sitting right

139
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
here.

140
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,300
I buy a lot of these tiny collectible arcade cabinets and some would say this is a waste

141
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,740
of money, especially when I leave it in the box like this.

142
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,740
But I love these things.

143
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,940
And they're about a third of the price of that Mario Game and Watch thing.

144
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,740
But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tempted by the Mario Game and Watch.

145
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,980
But I suppose Nintendo is going to make that decision for me when they murder Mario on

146
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,980
in just three days.

147
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,980
We are.

148
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,980
We are.

149
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,980
Dawn.

150
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,980
Dawn of the Mario is dead day.

151
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,980
Three.

152
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,980
Seventy two hours remain.

153
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,980
Right.

154
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,980
Yep.

155
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,980
All right.

156
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,980
We're right around the corner.

157
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:29,060
So if you do want to get them, then you probably should get them or, you know.

158
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,060
I will be.

159
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,900
And look, actually, ironically, I'm wearing a Mario shirt tonight, but I will be taking

160
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,180
it off in three days.

161
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,180
Not on stream.

162
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,260
And we can all be thankful for that.

163
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:43,020
But I will be taking it off in three days because Mario will be dead.

164
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,180
And so I can't really wear the shirt that I've had for years and years anymore because

165
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:53,320
Nintendo has decided not only is the year of Mario over, but Mario products must be

166
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,300
over with it because that is that's how we celebrate.

167
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,820
We celebrate with Zelda now.

168
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,220
Is it the year of Zelda?

169
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,220
No, Loki.

170
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,220
It's the year of nothing.

171
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,760
It's the year of silence.

172
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:12,060
It's the year of another Nintendo Indies announcement, I'm sure, in the coming weeks, which I don't

173
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,940
mean to shade the indie thing, but I'm just saying that, like, Nintendo is, you know,

174
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,580
they'll probably just announce their brand new system and they're going to have those

175
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:28,260
games be pack-ins or something for that or some ridiculous thing that that actually would

176
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,100
be like, I'd be so irritated, but I would also laugh.

177
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,820
But I think there's a lot more people who would be extremely irritated if come June,

178
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,740
they announce a bundle and they're like, it's the Mario celebration bundle comes with 3D

179
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,700
all stars installed on the system.

180
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,460
No, it would be like, yeah, what was it?

181
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,940
The one that they?

182
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,940
Yeah.

183
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,180
Did he ever like add, um, what was it?

184
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,860
It was, um, galaxy two.

185
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,540
Was that ever like DLC or anything?

186
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,540
I can't remember.

187
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,540
I don't think it was.

188
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,540
No, I got that.

189
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,540
No.

190
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,540
Yeah.

191
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,540
No.

192
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,340
Nintendo has thrown galaxy two in the trash game of the year.

193
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,620
Galaxy two is in the dumpster out back in Redmond.

194
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,620
Right?

195
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,620
Yeah.

196
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,300
So yeah, I could see them doing something stupid like that.

197
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,420
Re-releasing it again.

198
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,420
I don't know.

199
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,900
It's just funny because they can't manage their supply chain as it is.

200
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,260
And now they're like not managing their digital supply chain, which really doesn't exist.

201
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,140
I mean, it's infinite, but somehow it's not.

202
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,140
I know.

203
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,420
It's very interesting because Nintendo has a lot of problems with their physical supply

204
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,420
chain.

205
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,100
So clearly the answer is to limit their digital supply.

206
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,500
I don't understand how they think that it's going to like devalue those things because

207
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,980
like all their games never go on.

208
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,000
I mean, like they hardly ever go on sale.

209
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,160
It's frustrating because like some of the stuff that's out there, it really should go

210
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,160
on sale.

211
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,080
Like, like Mario tennis doesn't need to be a $60 game several years after it's come out.

212
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,200
I mean, like it, it can drop in price.

213
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,600
It's fine.

214
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,240
It's just, they demand $60 for their games forever.

215
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,400
And no, no, thank you.

216
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,920
I'm curious.

217
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
I'm curious.

218
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm curious in chat.

219
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,680
How would you guys feel, cause some of you did, I only want to hear from the people that

220
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,840
purchased Mario all stars of which there are several of you.

221
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:26,280
How would you feel if Nintendo this June confirms this super Nintendo switch, whatever you want

222
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,240
to call it, the 4k switch, whatever.

223
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,040
It's all a rumor anyway.

224
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:36,880
And as part, one of the launch titles for the switch is going to be a 4k version of

225
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,120
Mario 3d all stars with galaxy two.

226
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,720
How would you feel about that?

227
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,460
Would you be happy because yay, Mario's back from the dead or would you be pissed off because

228
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,880
I spent $60 on what I'd be, I'd, I'd be curious.

229
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
Okay.

230
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
I'm looking in chat.

231
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,080
Sacred Jade says I'd still buy it.

232
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
Okay.

233
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
We'll see.

234
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,320
I'm waiting for other comments to come in here.

235
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,560
It's the, there's a little bit of a delay between the time we say things and the time

236
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,400
our chat room sees them there.

237
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,120
So a pixel pockets in chat.

238
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,920
I love the honest answer.

239
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,880
Pixel pockets and Chad says I would buy it and feel like a clown, especially like right

240
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:22,120
after like, there is a clown Mario turned around and just like re-released it.

241
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,000
Not even like six months after it's like, Oh, we, we, we took it off the market, but

242
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,500
now we took it, put, brought it back.

243
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,280
Like I don't see the point.

244
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,840
I don't get why it's limited.

245
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,160
Like the Mario 35 understand because you know, network resources and stuff like that.

246
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:43,880
But a game you've literally produced, why are you not offering that anymore?

247
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,320
Like that is stupid.

248
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,640
Like you could do like limited time DLC or something like that.

249
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
Like they did with smash brothers.

250
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:55,060
Hey, we're going to throw in this piece of deals that you get a free piranha plant character.

251
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,000
If you purchase it within the first, you know, month or so, like that makes sense, but just

252
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,480
like, Oh, well, you didn't buy it within the timeframe.

253
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,360
Well, we're just going to take it off the market.

254
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,560
You should have bought it because you know, you belong to our Nintendo cult.

255
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,380
You buy all the things like that.

256
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,380
It's stupid.

257
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:17,080
Like it's absolutely stupid, especially like, like, let's just look at COVID and stuff.

258
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,800
Like not everybody has like a lot of resources to buy these games and what if someone actually

259
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,560
wanted to buy one, but they're waiting to get their tax refund back or something like

260
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,560
that.

261
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
It's like, Oh, sorry.

262
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
Too late.

263
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,560
Too late for that.

264
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,560
You know, I have this.

265
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,560
Yeah.

266
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,560
Nintendo doesn't accept stimulus money.

267
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,600
They only accept tax refunds.

268
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
I don't get it.

269
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Whatever.

270
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
You know what?

271
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
It's fine.

272
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,640
I, they can make their own business decisions, I guess, but like I don't get it.

273
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,520
I don't understand the, the basis of it.

274
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,520
I don't either.

275
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,640
Um, uh, some other comments in chat, it seems like generally across the board, people are

276
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:59,600
like, I hate it, but I'd still buy it, which is, I'm not dragging anyone, but this is,

277
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,880
this is the way many gamers approach Nintendo.

278
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,520
I hate it, but I buy it.

279
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,320
They know that like, they're all, what are you going to do about it?

280
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,320
Hmm.

281
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,320
All right.

282
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,020
You know, we can do whatever we want.

283
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,320
You don't like the decision, but you're still going to do it anyways.

284
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
You're still going to buy it.

285
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,320
No, I'm not.

286
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Loki.

287
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
I did it.

288
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
I did it.

289
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Loki.

290
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
I stuck with my decision.

291
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
I want a star.

292
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Yeah.

293
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
But you're, you're one person in the majority.

294
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,320
No.

295
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
SSJ 100.

296
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Matt did it too.

297
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
We are two people.

298
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,040
All right.

299
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
All right.

300
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
Well, I guess, I guess that's it.

301
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,040
Game over.

302
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,040
I fucking showed them.

303
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Didn't I?

304
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
All right.

305
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:44,720
SSJ 100, SSJ 100, Matt and I exist in a secret cult and we meet biweekly on Saturdays and

306
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,800
in our cult, we believe that Mario is still alive.

307
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,400
Even though Nintendo has killed him, Mario is secretly alive and he's living on an island

308
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,400
in the Bahamas.

309
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,260
And he's, he's a okay.

310
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,440
So that's where we're at.

311
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:05,480
They're just going to sell the collection as NFTs in like April, so that's fine.

312
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
I hate it.

313
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
All right.

314
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,380
Now I really want to change the topic.

315
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,120
Let's get to our kickoff topic tonight.

316
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,640
I don't know if you think that was it, but no, we just went off on something else.

317
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,780
Uh, Loki, what do we really want to talk about at the start of tonight's show?

318
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,200
So let's talk about the significant change coming to Xbox live.

319
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,160
I mean, I'm sorry, Xbox network.

320
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,160
That's it.

321
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
That's the change.

322
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,380
They're just changing the name.

323
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,420
So Xbox live, it's gone.

324
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,780
It's gone like Mario and it's going to be now Xbox network.

325
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,280
So maybe that's what's happening.

326
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,300
Maybe Mario is getting a brand new name and so it's no longer Mario.

327
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,620
It's going to be, um, you know, he's going to assign himself a new name.

328
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,940
He'll be a mark now.

329
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,220
Look here.

330
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,820
I just, I really quit cause I'm getting dragged in chat because a tiger claw on chat says

331
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,500
knowing Rob, he'll buy that legendary edition of the mass effect trilogy.

332
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,580
And Bobby Black Wolf says it's Mario, not mass effect.

333
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:02,700
Um, look, I'm allowed to be a hypocrite on my own show if I want to be, uh, and to quote

334
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,540
RuPaul from this week's episode of drag race, and I apologize to the podcast listeners.

335
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,060
He's not going to be able to hear this one, but if you saw the episode, you'll know what

336
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:16,200
I'm talking about anyway for you listeners to quote RuPaul's drag race this week.

337
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Thank you.

338
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,500
All right, go ahead.

339
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,500
Loki.

340
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,500
All right.

341
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,500
So anyways.

342
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,980
Um, so yeah, so the rebranding basically, uh, they're saying that Xbox network is going

343
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:33,180
to be, what's going to be referred to as now, uh, refers the underlying Xbox online services,

344
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:39,740
uh, which was updated in the Microsoft service agreement and the update from Xbox live to

345
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:47,500
Xbox network is intended to distinguish the underlying services from Xbox live gold memberships.

346
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
That cool.

347
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,220
You change, you're calling it something else.

348
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,540
Um, other than that, it doesn't seem to be changing much of anything.

349
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,080
So that's it.

350
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,620
It's just called something different now.

351
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:07,980
And Xbox network, I mean, I guess, I don't know, it doesn't have the same ring to it,

352
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,540
but cool.

353
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,560
It really doesn't have the same ring as Xbox live.

354
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,580
Like Xbox live was kind of catchy.

355
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:21,940
Um, I, it is, I don't know, to me, this kind of strikes me as like, what an interesting

356
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,860
time to make a pivot.

357
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,180
I would have thought that if they were going to be rebranding an Xbox network, they might

358
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:32,160
kind of do that as they're launching a new console, but it's also kind of one of those

359
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,860
why now sorts of things.

360
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:39,540
But I also sort of like get it based on the fact that, you know, Microsoft has set this

361
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:45,660
goal for themselves where they are not necessarily a device in your living room, but they are

362
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:51,340
a platform, they are a, you know, play, they are a, um, delivery service for games.

363
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,940
Uh, and you know, games pass is really your game passes, you mean is really where they're

364
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,800
putting a lot of their investment.

365
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,980
So I think to maybe rebrand as Xbox network kind of separates them from being something

366
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,940
that is, you know, traditionally been a very console centric thing because obviously Xbox

367
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:12,000
is something that, um, we are seeing on PCs as well.

368
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,860
And we even see it on PlayStation and Nintendo switch what log into Minecraft with your Xbox

369
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,640
network account.

370
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,200
It's probably because see, the reason they've got a rebranded text box network is because

371
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,540
the next console that the release to keep in line with the confusion of their naming

372
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,440
scheme is they'll just call the next console, the Xbox live.

373
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,120
And then they'll just kind of, you know, cap off the confusing console series that they've

374
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,480
had so far with their naming.

375
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,280
So maybe that's what it's about.

376
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:51,800
I can also see though, where, you know, maybe Microsoft is ready to distance themselves

377
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,480
with some of the reputation that Xbox live has had in the past.

378
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,440
Um, because I think we all have a horror story about playing a game on Xbox live and getting

379
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,400
called all sorts of names that are disgusting, and I'm not going to repeat them here on this

380
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,080
lovely program that we have, uh, especially on a Sunday.

381
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,960
Um, but maybe Microsoft wants to separate from that a little bit.

382
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,920
Although I completely understand.

383
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,880
I mean, look at, look at how well that worked out for Comcast.

384
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,640
I mean, Xfinity that that worked out so perfect, you know, they changed names.

385
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,880
It's like, yeah, that Comcast man, they sucked, but Xfinity, they still suck under a different

386
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,880
name.

387
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,880
Oh yeah.

388
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
Netflix going to Quickster.

389
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
No problem.

390
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
Everybody will embrace it.

391
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,880
Quickster.

392
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:42,880
Okay, but Quickster sounds like, you know, the flea market equivalent of the flash, which

393
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,200
is like what you order on wish when you order the flash version of the flash.

394
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Well, what's funny.

395
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Okay.

396
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,000
But what's funny about that whole Quickster scenario is that fucking Netflix did it anyway.

397
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,080
They just did it a year later and didn't call it.

398
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,120
They ended up what they sold it to dvd.com and I think, I think it's even called like

399
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,720
DVD flicks now.

400
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,320
Then there was an article I saw just this week about how the service sucks compared

401
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,600
to what it used to be.

402
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,900
Like they used to have over like 10,000 DVDs on the service and now there's not nearly

403
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,900
as many.

404
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,720
And for people that are super into like cult films, foreign films, old films, the really

405
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:23,540
hard to find shit that never made its way to Blu-ray still, or digital still, it kind

406
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,800
of sucks that that's fading because that was the audience that was still using that because

407
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,600
you could find almost anything on that service.

408
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,600
So it's just, just kind of interesting.

409
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,920
Anyway, this wasn't supposed to be about Netflix, supposed to be about Xbox live changing their

410
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:42,440
name and, and why now to change their name and will they be able to get away because

411
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,120
I think I was just having a call with Bobby earlier tonight on his show and I think I

412
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,100
still called it Xbox live.

413
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,940
So I think this is going to take a little bit of time before we kind of get that name

414
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,940
out of our mouths.

415
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,940
I don't know.

416
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,300
So what is Xbox live gold turn into Xbox network gold?

417
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,840
What's the plan there?

418
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,620
I think it's still going to be Xbox live.

419
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:07,700
It's just live gold doesn't make any sense now because there really isn't anything else.

420
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,620
You don't have live silver anymore.

421
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,620
It's just.

422
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,780
Well, and when are they going to just, and when are they just going to get rid of gold?

423
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,600
I've been saying this for a long time.

424
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,160
Like what do you, what do you get with gold?

425
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,420
You get the free games and the ability to play online, although they're starting to

426
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:27,500
dial that back because they were finally bullied into it by their user base.

427
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:33,300
And honestly, I, I, I get it because you know, the PlayStation wasn't charging online.

428
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,920
Windows store PC wasn't charging online.

429
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,540
And so for things like Fortnite and that stuff, so, um, you know, Microsoft has finally retreated

430
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,280
from that at least for the free to play games.

431
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,140
Although if you want to play, I don't know, Gears or whatever online, you're still going

432
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,500
to have to pay for the Xbox gold or shit.

433
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:56,420
I've been playing a lot of dead by daylight lately on, uh, Xbox series X and I have Xbox

434
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:01,300
gold thankfully, so I can still play online with strangers and get teabagged at the exit

435
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,300
doors.

436
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,540
So, yeah, I, I don't know why they still charge for that, especially on the console.

437
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,780
That doesn't make any sense too.

438
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:13,740
When you have like a lot of the, they've made, I don't know really why I got an Xbox series

439
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:19,460
X when you think about it, because they make a hard sell for, you know, buying their console

440
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,460
in the first place.

441
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,680
They're most of their games are available on PC as well.

442
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,020
And most people have a pretty decent PC.

443
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,100
You don't have to pay for the same online service there.

444
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:35,500
And it's just, there's less exclusives that are like specifically console exclusives.

445
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,100
They're always going to be console and PC.

446
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:43,500
And so it's just, it's like, they're like promoting not to buy their console.

447
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,860
It doesn't make any sense.

448
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,800
I just really wish they would get rid of that, but I get it.

449
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,120
It's an income, it's a revenue stream, but it's just not something that they can charge

450
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,200
on PC because people will be like, no, I'm just going to buy it from Steam or the Epic

451
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Games store.

452
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,200
Yeah.

453
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,960
I'm just, I'm not really just a big fan in general of, uh, uh, the, the, uh, that's my

454
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,960
train of thought.

455
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,960
Damn it.

456
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,400
The, um, I was trying to reach out at the same time and I told her, I lost my train

457
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,400
of thought.

458
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
Anyway, go ahead.

459
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:19,280
But yeah, I mean, it's just, I don't know.

460
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,840
I don't see the point of charging for it.

461
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,480
I think it would be, you know, if they did want to charge for it and just like roll it

462
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:31,080
into games pass and let that be its thing, let just sell games pass, get rid of the Xbox

463
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,200
live gold and then have that.

464
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,880
And then, you know, branch that out to other platforms as well.

465
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,220
And I think you have a winning service there, but we're just not there yet.

466
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,220
I think.

467
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,220
Um, I will say that I enjoy my Xbox series X.

468
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,320
I don't regret that purchase in the slightest.

469
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,520
The performance is so much better than the prior, you know, console.

470
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,560
It really does feel like an upgrade and I really enjoy playing games in the living

471
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
room.

472
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,680
Um, but that's, you know, that also is just probably like my type of lifestyle.

473
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,200
I imagine Loki, when you try to play games in the living room, you get distracted a lot

474
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:08,240
by, you know, the kids, the wife, I have to, it's hooked up to my, my monitors here.

475
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,840
So it's basically like playing on PC.

476
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
Oh, okay.

477
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,360
See, but then that makes sense where it's like, well, why bother?

478
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,880
So, but for me, I like to get out of my office and plot my big butt on the couch and, you

479
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,920
know, play a game in there.

480
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,600
Um, although now I'm having this whole thing where I'm like, as much as I've invested in

481
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,840
Dead by Daylight to this point, I'm like, maybe I should get it on PC.

482
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,840
That might be fun.

483
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,320
I don't know.

484
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,520
But then I'll just get dragged by chat all over again for buying multiple copies of the

485
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
same game.

486
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,800
Does that, does the DLC port over to like, say if you buy that through the window store

487
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
or something like that?

488
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
No.

489
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,760
And it's so well, okay.

490
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,200
Yes and no.

491
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:57,760
Steam, the Switch and one other, oh, Stadia, Steam, the Switch and Stadia all cross by.

492
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,520
So if you buy DLC L1, you get it on those others within that area, but all the rest,

493
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,520
no.

494
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:09,420
And I think it is stupid that it's not cross by between window store and Xbox.

495
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,420
Why is that?

496
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,420
It makes no sense.

497
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,420
It is.

498
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,420
So that makes no sense to me.

499
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:17,160
It's one of my big complaints about that game, to be honest.

500
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:24,480
So anyway, Xbox Live, now Xbox Network, we'll see how long it takes us to really adapt to

501
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,880
that change name and see, I guess in June, maybe we'll really start to see some of the

502
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,040
marketing behind that, whether there's an E3 or not.

503
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:37,120
I imagine we're going to still start to see some of the push behind, you know, what Microsoft

504
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,000
really plans to do with that branding and how they're going to propel it forward, which

505
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,600
I imagine will have a lot to do with cloud gaming.

506
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,680
I expect a lot with cloud gaming to come out of Microsoft this June, but that is, I'm

507
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,680
not going to lie.

508
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,680
That is exciting.

509
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,680
So, yeah.

510
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,000
All right.

511
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,880
Let's move on and get into how was your gaming week and the types of games that you've been

512
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,880
playing this week.

513
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,920
Loki, how was your gaming week?

514
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,840
It's going to sound like a broken record.

515
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,840
It's been the same stuff.

516
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:08,240
So basically you've been playing Minecraft, still watching lots of streamers.

517
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:15,000
I've gone through several different Hermitcraft streamers and just watching their content,

518
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,160
but I've been also working on this giant tree that's on our realm.

519
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,240
And so working on that, it's very tedious.

520
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,620
I can see why the guy, Iskall, who does that actually in Hermitcraft takes many breaks

521
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,420
from it because it gets very tedious and boring.

522
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,120
So that's what I've been doing in Minecraft.

523
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:41,700
I have been playing more Orna as well and then also working on the special edition Pixel

524
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,700
Poops 2.

525
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:49,560
So I've put together like six new levels so far and I've got four more at least I've planned

526
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,520
out because I wanted to bump each world up to 10.

527
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,640
And then I've been trying to just polish some of the code that's in there to try to get

528
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,800
it to work how I wanted it to.

529
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,320
And I may add another whole world to it.

530
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,160
I haven't decided yet.

531
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,440
The problem is I'm like running out of like unique enemies or like things I can do with

532
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,280
since they don't really have a way.

533
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,140
There's no projectiles or anything in the game.

534
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:19,200
So it's hard to like make like a boss or like, you know, just different enemy types.

535
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,200
It's just aside from reskinning something that's basically it all I can really do with

536
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
it.

537
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,760
So I had thought about I had originally planned because I took two days off this week.

538
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:36,000
I had originally planned on splitting the sound engine to be able to allow for more

539
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
music.

540
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,720
But then I thought about it and it's like, well, I've already like dumped like X number

541
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,080
of dollars into the music itself.

542
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,000
And I clearly am not going to make that back.

543
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Clearly so.

544
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,480
I was like, does it make sense to just dump more into it?

545
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,160
I'm like, no, it doesn't.

546
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,800
So that kind of got nixed.

547
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:06,280
And also the guy that like, you know, cosmic gem, you know, great music, but man, he can

548
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,400
he can take a while to get stuff done.

549
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:15,200
And so I didn't want to just like commission more music and have it take like several months.

550
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,280
So I just didn't want to get in that scenario again.

551
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,480
I just want to kind of be done with this.

552
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,960
So I am at the very least going to have 10 more levels in there total.

553
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,000
So I've gotten six of the 10.

554
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,760
Probably get the other four done maybe tonight or so.

555
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,680
And then I've already added like another like there you can play as female characters now.

556
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,280
So that was something I added like several weeks ago.

557
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,200
So there's that.

558
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,200
And I am going to change up the the continue.

559
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,800
I guess it's not respawning, but like continuing.

560
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,840
So instead of continuing at the beginning of a world, it'll just be the level you died

561
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,060
on, which I think is more fair, although it makes the game easier.

562
00:27:55,060 --> 00:28:00,420
I may try to throw a hardcore mode in there to make it harder to increase the rate of

563
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,740
spawning, which would be easy enough to do.

564
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,460
So there's stuff like that and maybe an integrated manual as well.

565
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,260
So that is just some of the stuff I was working on for that.

566
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,060
But at the very least, I have levels done.

567
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,300
So that's kind of cool.

568
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,780
But yeah, that is basically what this week's been.

569
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,780
Be sure to check that out.

570
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,460
Listeners help Loki make some of his money back.

571
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,220
He spent on the music.

572
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:28,320
That's Pixel Poops number two on itch.io or also available on Steam with Pixel Poops

573
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,320
as DLC.

574
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,320
So check that out.

575
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,320
Yeah.

576
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:37,180
And there's this other website that the folks behind Nesbaker are working on as well, that

577
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:41,160
once they get it completed, it'll be nice to share it with you because they have a really

578
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,160
cool integrated.

579
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,180
It's almost like a Steam workshop for NES ROMs.

580
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,420
So it's pretty cool.

581
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:52,740
And they actually have one of the things that's coming with that is eventually like if I publish

582
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,960
a game, they could actually take care of making the physical versions.

583
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,100
So they pay you like a flat fee or whatever you want to charge for it.

584
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,380
And then they manufacture and ship it out for you, which would be ideal.

585
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:09,740
So in the future, that's like so early in development right now for that.

586
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:13,100
But like that is something cool that's coming down the pipeline.

587
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,100
All right.

588
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,100
Very cool.

589
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,100
My gaming week, honestly, kind of like Loki, a lot of the same stuff.

590
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,060
I've been continuing my adventures in Final Fantasy 14.

591
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,380
I fell off the Orna Wagon several weeks ago, though I haven't really been playing a lot

592
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,380
of that.

593
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:31,100
Yeah, I noticed that there's not been people like starting, you know, the kingdom battles

594
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,100
and stuff.

595
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm like, I don't know how to operate the bot.

596
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,060
So I don't think I can do that.

597
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,340
Everybody should have the ability to do it now.

598
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,740
If you don't, just yell at me and I'll.

599
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,500
Well, I know how to do I know how to start a new kingdom battle, but I don't know how

600
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
to operate the bot.

601
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,580
Oh, you just so that's why I haven't been doing it otherwise.

602
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,580
War and however much time is left.

603
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,220
Just scroll up and see what other people type to say, like a template.

604
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,220
Let's see.

605
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,660
So otherwise, I have been playing more Pokemon Go.

606
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:04,500
I almost have hit the experience I need for level 44, finally.

607
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,160
But it's just the all the PvP battles I have to do is holding me back.

608
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,420
So I'm probably going to be gated behind that by the time I have the XP for 44.

609
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,420
But that's OK.

610
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:17,980
It'll be it'll be by the time I get the XP for 45 when I really start to get irritated

611
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,980
on that.

612
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,980
I'm still playing a little bit of Ingress, allowing that to motivate a lot of my walking

613
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:26,380
that I've been trying to do more of because I gained too much weight through this pandemic

614
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,380
process.

615
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:31,620
So I'm trying to be a little more physically active to try to lose some of that before

616
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,060
some of these in-person conventions start coming back.

617
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,940
I've also been playing Dead by Daylight, as I mentioned, a couple of weeks on the show.

618
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,740
I finally kind of started getting into that last week on the show.

619
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,880
I'm sad she's not here to hear this, but Jamie and I had a follow up conversation and she

620
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,500
was very adamant that I start playing Freddy Krueger as killer.

621
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,600
And you might remember she actually Apple paid me five bucks so I could get the DLC

622
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
for Freddy Krueger.

623
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,620
Well, I actually paid seven bucks because I just got the little combo pack that has

624
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:04,040
him and the survivor and whatever other Friday 13th crap came with it.

625
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
And I got that.

626
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
And so I've been playing.

627
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,820
I did play my first game with Freddy as the killer.

628
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,320
And I got to say, he's really fucking fun.

629
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,560
He's such a bitch, like he's such a little bitch to be playing against.

630
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:21,840
I know survivors have got to hate him, but the whole like fact that they can't even really

631
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,880
see you coming until you're already there, unless they're in the dream world is a pretty

632
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,960
nasty mechanic.

633
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,460
And I love being able to port to the generators.

634
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,460
It's great.

635
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,200
He's such a little jerk and I love his talent.

636
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,920
One of them, he can actually shut the exit doors once they've been opened.

637
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,120
As long as he hooks somebody, then the exit doors get shut for like 40 seconds and people

638
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,260
will try to run out thinking they can escape and psych.

639
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,940
So all those people that try to teabag you at the exit get fucked.

640
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:55,260
And it's awesome because I don't like killing anyone more than those people who teabag me

641
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,260
at the exit.

642
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:01,060
Zenmonkey11 in chat says, I always play as Freddy, but I don't think he's good for new

643
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,060
players.

644
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,060
I don't know.

645
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,020
Maybe it's because I like watched other streams.

646
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:08,140
I figured it out pretty quick.

647
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:11,020
It's just setting those traps and kind of knowing where to set them.

648
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,860
Although Pyramid Head has a very similar mechanic and that's who I was playing.

649
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,380
And then, which I need to do some with the pallets.

650
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:22,180
I fucking love that you can do fake pallets on top of all that.

651
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,420
And just kind of, you know, being able to use the blood porting to your advantage where

652
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:29,320
you can actually port to a gen on the other side of the map to more effectively patrol

653
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,960
or fake them out.

654
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,660
Like if you're, if you're going to be like near a gen, you start to blood port to that

655
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,020
gen and watch everybody run out and then get him as they're running out.

656
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:43,740
He's a nasty little shit trickster and that's why he's really fun to play.

657
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,400
So yeah, so I've been enjoying Freddy.

658
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,200
He's like my second highest leveled killer now next to Pyramid Head.

659
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,360
So I will have to, I texted Jamie and let her know, but I'll have to let her know more

660
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,660
about that later on.

661
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:02,100
So and Zenmonkey11 in chat says, Freddy in the Stranger Things lab is awesome.

662
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,500
Oh, I bet the traps are so effective there in the narrow quarters.

663
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,860
I hate that map though, but I can see where, cause Pyramid Head's trenches are very effective,

664
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,880
which again is a very similar mechanic.

665
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,140
So yeah, Dead by Daylight, still playing more of that.

666
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:18,900
I also played Octopath Traveler on Xbox cause it's with Game Pass.

667
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,020
So I played a little bit of that and it hasn't really changed from the Switch.

668
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:26,460
So there's really not a lot to add, but it was nice to kind of play that again and there's

669
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,180
a ton of achievements.

670
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,720
You get achievements for doing every little thing in that game.

671
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,300
So that's kind of fun.

672
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:39,180
I also played, this isn't really a full game, but you know, you know how Shane is my friend

673
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:44,300
and you know, he has a reputation here on Orange Silence Radio, being able to talk people

674
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:49,640
into buying and playing whatever game he wants you to be able to play.

675
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,640
And one of the series he's really into right now is Monster Hunter.

676
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,860
And so he's really trying to get me into Monster Hunter.

677
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:01,540
And you know, I guess I could have downloaded the one on Game Pass cause Monster Hunter

678
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,740
World, I think is on Game Pass, but he was like, no, they've done so many quality of

679
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,740
life things in Rise.

680
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,520
Just download that Monster Hunter Rise demo for the Switch.

681
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,140
So I did, and I have to say the demo was a lot better than the Wii U Monster Hunter demo

682
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:19,900
because it actually told you what to do and actually set you up and educated you on how

683
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,140
to play the game.

684
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:26,340
So I will give Rise credit in that department, but at the end of the day, unfortunately,

685
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,860
I think I just don't enjoy Monster Hunter.

686
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,200
And I think it's, and I know a lot of you do, so I'm sorry, and I'm not saying it's

687
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,500
a bad game.

688
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,280
It's just not for me.

689
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,740
And it's the combat.

690
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,900
It's so I can't get into the combat.

691
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:44,920
Like I was doing the little tutorial thing and I'm like, oh, I swung my sword, gigantic

692
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:49,880
sword and it took like two minutes and I missed and oh, I swung my big sword and I think I

693
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,440
hit this one, but you know what?

694
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:57,560
My dog pal and my cat pal already killed them because I'm so slow and bad that my dog and

695
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,960
cat pal, which I do love that there are dog and cat friends, but they already killed them.

696
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,200
And I tried to do another quest and it was just, I just, I can't get into it.

697
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
I'm sorry.

698
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,320
Anyway, I'm looking in chat.

699
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,360
Quest Buster says, not every game is for everyone.

700
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,360
It's okay.

701
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,160
I know, I know, but I know so many of you are fans of the series and I don't want to

702
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,560
sound like I'm talking negative on it.

703
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,640
It did seem really pretty, the map, there seemed to be a lot of area to explore and

704
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,480
all that, but I just can't get into the combat.

705
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,880
I just, and I think that's where it's just a, no, thank you for me.

706
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,880
Yeah.

707
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,520
Bobby Blackall says it's not a Nino Cooney, certainly not.

708
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,060
And Bobby says, yeah, they did a much better job with the demo and act deft and chat says

709
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:43,800
the same goes for me, Rob, after five to six installments of Monster Hunter, I finally

710
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,800
gave up.

711
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800
The game is not for me.

712
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,200
Oh, Shane is in chat saying Monster Hunter is like deadly Pokemon.

713
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,600
I'm excited every time I see a new monster, but then I'm excited to murder it.

714
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,700
Mission chat says you're not talking negative.

715
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,700
You're just not into it.

716
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,700
And that's okay.

717
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,700
Exactly.

718
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,600
But you know, what's funny is you'll never know when I suddenly change my mind and I

719
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,520
reserve the right to change my mind.

720
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,400
I wasn't really into Mass Effect when I first played it, but I ended up changing my mind

721
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,360
pretty big, didn't I?

722
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,620
Here's the other one that shocks me.

723
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,620
The horror thing.

724
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,320
I'm not super into horror games.

725
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,600
Well, I guess I'm always like Silent Hill, like psychological games, but I've never really

726
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,640
been into like jump scare horror type of games.

727
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,480
I don't really love horror movies the way a lot of my friends do and so forth, which

728
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,480
I know is ironic because I work with the SAC horror film festival and even the producer

729
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,600
knows, I'm not as into it as everyone else is.

730
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,600
I'll do, I'll do a kick ass job hosting.

731
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,920
I'm just not as into it.

732
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:42,120
I love cult movies and that's why I'm there because horror and cult are very closely aligned.

733
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:47,000
But my point is yet here I am five years after it came out, finally getting into Dead by

734
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Daylight.

735
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,320
And finally just, oh, something finally clicked for me in this game and I'm into it now.

736
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,960
And maybe that will happen with Monster Hunter someday.

737
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,500
Maybe there will be just the right class that I discover where it's like, oh, this one doesn't

738
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,500
play like molasses.

739
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,680
I can, you know, get into this.

740
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,640
But today is not that day.

741
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,640
There is that.

742
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,160
So Shane even says in chat, I didn't like Monster Hunter until World.

743
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,020
It took the changes they made in World for me to have fun and now it's even better.

744
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:17,060
So it took years for me to be a fan.

745
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:21,580
And Quest Buster says, I wasn't into Pokemon until I finally sat down with Pokemon Sword

746
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,680
and found myself really enjoying it.

747
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,540
And talk about a series that Shane has really been trying to get me into for a long time.

748
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,440
Yeah, the Pokemon games.

749
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,460
I mean, I've always enjoyed them enough.

750
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,100
I'll get through like a couple gyms in each of the mainline games and I'll kind of put

751
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,100
it aside.

752
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:43,000
But it wasn't until Pokemon Shield and that whole concept of you don't have to feel like

753
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,260
you're missing Pokemon if you don't catch them all in a certain area because you have

754
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:52,000
this gigantic, wild area waiting for you that you can explore in postgame and all this stuff.

755
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So just focus on it.

756
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,340
Like the way Shield kind of framed it so much differently really worked for me.

757
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:01,500
And it was the first Pokemon game I actually played to completion.

758
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,220
And actually, as for those of you following the show, I even completed my stupid Pokedex

759
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,220
a couple months ago.

760
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:10,500
Now I just have to work on the DLC, but we'll see.

761
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,380
All right.

762
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:16,020
So that's that with all that stuff.

763
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,920
Speaking of Pokemon, before I get to the next story.

764
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,940
So a little bit of a housekeeping note.

765
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,820
This week here at the Voice of Geeks Network, Bobby Blackwolf gave us our first channel

766
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,820
point reward night.

767
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:34,220
And basically what happened, those of you that do watch our show live over on Twitch,

768
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:38,900
every so often we will have a channel reward thing that you can fundraise for.

769
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:43,760
It's not actual money for these fundraisers, but they're the points that you earn as you

770
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,280
watch VOG content.

771
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,020
You get 10 points every few minutes that you're watching.

772
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,860
I think if you're subbed, you get 12.

773
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,540
Well, you can actually chip in points towards a bonus stream when we open that up.

774
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:59,860
So Bobby did the first one this week and he did some old VHS footage of things he shot

775
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,520
in the 90s.

776
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,820
Some promos that he had VHS copies of, and some of them were wild, let me tell you.

777
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:12,460
I didn't see all of it because I instead saw a really, really bad car accident as I was

778
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,740
doing a Pokewalk that same day.

779
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,920
And I got stuck there because they had to move everything out of the way for the cars

780
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,080
to get out of the parking lot.

781
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:23,660
But anyway, I did get to see the E3 footage that he shot on camera.

782
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,740
And a lot of that was really funny and really good.

783
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,820
And I guess for wrestling fans, there's a pretty epic thing in there.

784
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,340
So yeah, he did a great stream of that.

785
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,780
So we've been promising for a bit the second stream we're going to do, because I got him

786
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,540
to say he would do it when he was here on the show a couple weeks ago.

787
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:43,620
We're going to do Shane's Definitive Pokemon Ranking, and we'll see how good he is at influencing

788
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,500
folks on his decisions.

789
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:50,940
So that will be coming up if you guys can raise enough points, which I think you will.

790
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:57,720
I think you have four weeks to raise 100,000 points, and we already have 38,000 as of tonight.

791
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,240
So there's that.

792
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,500
If you're not able to be here live, if you're a subscriber here at the Voice of Geeks Network,

793
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,100
you can always watch it on demand.

794
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,520
We're trying to create more benefit for our subscribers.

795
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,280
That's really what it is, because so many of you have been so generous with your subscriptions

796
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,940
and the gift subscriptions, especially a lot of that, that we want to make sure there is

797
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,620
more content than just the Sunday night shows, the other shows we host.

798
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,100
We want you to have more content to dive into.

799
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,500
So if you missed what Bobby did earlier this week, hey, guess what, subscribers, you can

800
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,720
go watch that on demand anytime.

801
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:33,140
Make sure you see the part with the Charles Martinet voiced Mario animatronic in 98.

802
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,140
It's great.

803
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:40,420
And Bobby was so, so like, like dying on camera because he couldn't believe we were watching

804
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,420
it.

805
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,420
It was great.

806
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,420
So check that.

807
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,420
Check that out.

808
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,660
But we will be doing Shane's definitive Pokemon ranking at some point in April, assuming we

809
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,940
raised the points for it, which I think we will.

810
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,820
So be sure to collect those points.

811
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,820
All right.

812
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,740
I think that's it for the housekeeping.

813
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:59,500
Let's get into some more news and we're going to start off with Loki.

814
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,680
Yeah.

815
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:08,320
So alluding back to the story we were just talking about with Nintendo and supply chain.

816
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:17,160
Well, the they were selling brand new Animal Crossing New Horizons Sanrio amiibo cards

817
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:24,840
and they sold out pretty much immediately because what supply chain and, you know, Target

818
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,200
was originally the store that was offering these.

819
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:33,200
I think they may have been the only store and they were limiting orders to per customer.

820
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,920
But of course, even like, you know, all the console launches last year immediately grabbed

821
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:44,040
by scalpers who then turned around and sold them online.

822
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,280
And, you know, it's a big old mess, as usual.

823
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:58,040
Of course, as pointed out, there's folks that are selling bootleg amiibo cards off of like

824
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:04,680
Etsy and stuff like that, because you can clone them using NFC stickers, which I have

825
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,240
a 50 of them.

826
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:16,080
But yeah, it makes it very difficult to actually pay money and get these because they are so

827
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,520
scarce, which in reality, they really shouldn't be.

828
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,440
Yeah, I have no problem endorsing piracy in this case.

829
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,440
Sorry.

830
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,440
I know.

831
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,800
And I know people are going to take issue with that too.

832
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,960
It's just this is unacceptable.

833
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,240
What's happening is unacceptable, period.

834
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:38,880
Like Nintendo's scarcity of fucking cards that are so easy to make yourself that there's

835
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,240
entire Reddit's dedicated to the process.

836
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,520
Like go forth and copy, make your own cards.

837
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,760
Now, that's not going to be good enough for some people.

838
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,200
Some people are collectors and they're going to want to collect the actual cards and so

839
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,200
forth.

840
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,040
And again, I'm not here to tell you how to spend your money and how to do all that stuff.

841
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,880
But all I'm going to say is that if you want to pirate these cards, because Nintendo didn't

842
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,880
put enough of them on shelves and scalpers are buying them instead to devalue what the

843
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,040
scalpers have, I am all about piracy.

844
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,000
Go forth, pirate, make your own Sanrio amiibo.

845
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,040
In this case, I'm not endorsing piracy everywhere.

846
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,640
I'm endorsing it for this particular product.

847
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:21,360
Because once again, Nintendo has flopped when it comes to creating the supply to meet the

848
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,000
demand.

849
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
They're cards.

850
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I mean, they don't really cost anything.

851
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,280
But once again, they want to they don't want to oversaturate the market because it will

852
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,640
devalue their product.

853
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,960
But like, it's just frustrating.

854
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,320
Nobody is concerned about their product being devalued.

855
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:40,320
When is whenever has like anything that Nintendo has sold been devalued?

856
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:45,640
Like ever like I don't even looking at like classic NES games now buying cartridges for

857
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,640
those.

858
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,840
Those haven't dropped down in price very much.

859
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,840
No.

860
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:55,080
In fact, classic NES games, I mean, unless they're like, a lot of like sports games that

861
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,560
are released annually.

862
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:02,400
But even sometimes, like, you know, try to find a copy of like, what is the NHL 94, whatever

863
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,400
it is on Genesis, the, you know, epic one.

864
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,000
Those are still a bit of money.

865
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,560
But you know, a lot of the sports games that were published yearly are kind of the exception.

866
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,840
But you go back to like the cartridges on the NES, like a lot of they're they're going

867
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,620
up in price now.

868
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,280
You know, there was a little while when you could get them pretty cheaply.

869
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,800
But now that they're becoming more scarce, and they're more collectibles, they're just

870
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,800
going up in value.

871
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,080
They really, really are.

872
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,920
Yeah, it's crazy.

873
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,260
But yeah, same old, same old.

874
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,720
So I mean, if you want these, hope you got them.

875
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:36,160
But I don't know if they're going to be releasing more.

876
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:43,160
You know, honestly, like it to me, it, it doesn't even really make sense to me anyways,

877
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,520
because it's like a one time thing.

878
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,080
This really should have been just sold as DLC, like the cards, like, I guess you could

879
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,040
collect them, but it's not really something you can just display.

880
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,880
It's not like a statue like an amiibo normally is.

881
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,000
This is just you scan it into the game and you're done.

882
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Yeah.

883
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,040
Like, I don't understand why even Well, what would be the point of keeping them again,

884
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,040
collectibles akin to baseball card collecting?

885
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,360
I understand.

886
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,520
And I'm not here to tell somebody what they should and shouldn't collect.

887
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,520
So if that is value to somebody, then cool.

888
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,520
But you're right.

889
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,440
The practical use in the game.

890
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,280
I'm sick of the scarcity.

891
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,480
I'm sick of it.

892
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:25,080
So pirate now, I would say that I'm going to pirate these.

893
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:28,900
But a listener was like, Oh, I saw these on the shelf.

894
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,880
And I grabbed you one so that a scalper wouldn't get it.

895
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,880
And that was very kind.

896
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,360
I'm very lucky in that regard.

897
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:40,760
But if that hadn't happened, I would have no problem making my own, asking Loki for

898
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,480
help and making my own.

899
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,920
Yeah, I haven't I haven't quite done it yet.

900
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,560
But from what I see, it's very easy.

901
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,100
You have a phone app to basically scan it.

902
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:56,120
My phone has NFC writers, so I can just put the sticker on there.

903
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:00,680
Then they have like, the way most people set them up is they have a you print like a piece

904
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:06,080
of paper and you glue it to a poker chip, and you stick it inside of a coin case.

905
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,280
And then you can keep everything kind of together.

906
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,480
I haven't done it yet because I'm in no hurry to do it.

907
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,480
But we did.

908
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,800
We were going to do that just with some of the Smash Brothers amiibos and stuff like

909
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,040
that that I can't find anymore.

910
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,780
Like they're just not being sold anywhere.

911
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:30,240
So it's like rather than pay, you know, over twenty dollars a statue, we'll just put them

912
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,440
on a coin.

913
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,960
I don't I don't need especially since we're going to scan them in once and that'll be

914
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,960
it.

915
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,280
Like, I don't need to do that.

916
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,000
We don't need a Nintendo just had their own online store where you could order any amiibo

917
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
you wanted.

918
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
This wouldn't be such a problem.

919
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
But no.

920
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Oh, yeah.

921
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Yeah.

922
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
That would be helpful.

923
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
But, you know, that might devalue their product or something.

924
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Yeah.

925
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:00,160
I and this is this is the reason why I'm you know, I on one hand, I kind of miss some of

926
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,360
the amiibo stuff.

927
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,540
But this whole scarcity and thing, I don't miss it.

928
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:07,580
And that's the reason why I kind of do wish this amiibo stuff would come to an end.

929
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:10,660
And I realize these are just reprints of cards that are a few years old anyway, but they're

930
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:14,620
giving it all this new functionality, which obviously makes it a very different situation.

931
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:16,620
So yeah, there is that.

932
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:21,700
Well, speaking of Nintendo, at least this project sounds like it could be interesting.

933
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:27,300
There is a another joint venture that's going to be happening between Nintendo and Niantic.

934
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:32,980
Of course, Niantic being the makers of the hugely popular mobile phone game Pokemon Go,

935
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:37,060
which is still going, it's coming up on its five year anniversary, contrary to what Bobby

936
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:41,700
Black will try to tell you on our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash discord, Pokemon

937
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,020
Go is still going.

938
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:47,700
And it's honestly probably in a better place than it's been in a long time coming up on

939
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,700
its five year anniversary.

940
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:53,000
And that's going to be very interesting to see how they celebrate the five year anniversary.

941
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
And this week, Nintendo Niantic put out a joint press release talking about a new partnership.

942
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,040
They're going to be jointly develop apps that combine Niantic's real world AR technology

943
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,040
with Nintendo's beloved characters.

944
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:09,280
So this is one of probably more to come.

945
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:17,360
And I wonder if this isn't a result of Nintendo's own adventures into mobile phone gaming, you

946
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:21,320
know, outside of Pokemon Go, none of them really took off like everybody was expecting

947
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,440
Super Mario Run to change the game and it didn't.

948
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,800
And then the Animal Crossing, the Mario Kart, I think is really not done the expectations

949
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,280
they expected it to.

950
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,080
So they're really reevaluating how they do mobile phone and who's done well with a Nintendo

951
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,080
product.

952
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,440
Well, I'll tell you, it's Niantic.

953
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,400
And I'll tell you why Niantic did well with product where these other companies screwed

954
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:51,760
up because Niantic made a game, a unique thing with the mobile phone and what the mobile

955
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,400
phone can offer in mind.

956
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,240
What was Super Mario Run?

957
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:01,440
It was a cheap knockoff of the console experience because you couldn't have an actual controller

958
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,440
on the phone.

959
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,480
They decided, oh, he'll just always run and you'll tap the screen to jump.

960
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,480
Flop.

961
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,480
Mario.

962
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,480
So like an endless runner.

963
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:14,440
Well, it wasn't an endless runner, but like endless based off an endless runner is kind

964
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,160
of kind of like cheap.

965
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:22,800
Like just that's like, oh, I'm going to make a mobile game to be endless runners are popular.

966
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,800
Yeah.

967
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:28,440
Like when temple runs popular, it's like, okay, well, let's think outside the box of

968
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,440
it here.

969
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,120
Mario Kart, super fun game on console.

970
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,880
I hope they make a Mario Kart nine and soon.

971
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,280
But when you try to translate it to cell phone, doing this with your cell phone just isn't

972
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,440
the same.

973
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,180
It's not as fun.

974
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,620
And so people kind of rejected that.

975
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:49,000
This is where Niantic succeeded because they developed a game that took, you know, something

976
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,600
only mobile phones can do and a game that was designed for mobile.

977
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,480
They had that in the back of their mind.

978
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,560
And so that's really what it is.

979
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,760
So Nintendo's kind of realized this, I think.

980
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,140
And now they're partnering with Niantic to make other games.

981
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:07,200
And the first one that they are going to be doing is a new game based on Pikmin, which

982
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,880
that part kind of makes me go, ooh, cause I'm just not a big Pikmin fan.

983
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,580
It's like, it's like a monster Hunter for me.

984
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:13,580
You guys love it.

985
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,580
I don't, I don't care for it.

986
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,680
How many Pikmin games have we gotten recently?

987
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,880
Like let's move on to another franchise, please only Pikmin three.

988
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,880
It was just recent.

989
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,720
That's why it feels like there's like another one before that though.

990
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,680
They had another rerelease and aren't they making yet another game as well.

991
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,680
They did.

992
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,760
Yeah, I think, I think so.

993
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,240
It's been so many, like just, Oh God, it's, it's so uninteresting.

994
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,580
Like yeah, I'll check it out, but like, it's certainly not ha it does not have the appeal

995
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:47,760
that, you know, a Pokemon game would have a Pikmin is just not, it's not to that level.

996
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:53,380
I'll give it a chance because in the announcement, the press release, they say with gameplay

997
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:58,660
activities designed to encourage walking and making the activities more enjoyable.

998
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:02,080
And of course it's being made by Niantic in Tokyo.

999
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,680
And that all sounds making walking more enjoyable.

1000
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,040
That's what motivates me to play things like Ingress and Pokemon go.

1001
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,280
So if they find a way to gamify Pikmin in a way that's going to be fun.

1002
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:18,640
And I don't expect, and I think I have to remember what I just said about why those

1003
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,600
other games didn't work.

1004
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,680
And that might be good news for me here.

1005
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,900
I didn't enjoy Pikmin on console, but since Niantic, I expect is not just going to try

1006
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:32,920
to shove a console version of Pikmin in the real world, but make an AR experience that

1007
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,440
happens to involve Pikmin.

1008
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,020
I'm going to give it a shot because it's going to be different from the console games based

1009
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:43,520
on the track record of Niantic, based on the track record of all the other companies

1010
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,820
that Nintendo tried to partner with.

1011
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,380
Does that make sense?

1012
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:51,820
Yeah, I wish they would do like a Zelda game, honestly, because the control scheme that

1013
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:58,100
they had on the DS Zelda games using just the touch screen was fantastic.

1014
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,100
It was great.

1015
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,580
It worked really well.

1016
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,860
Like you could make a pretty robust game.

1017
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:06,900
I think it would be awesome to see a mobile like Zelda game and even like an AR based

1018
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:11,100
one would be kind of cool with different randomly generated dungeons.

1019
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:18,620
Can you fucking imagine a Zelda AR game that's kind of like based on the first Zelda where

1020
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:20,780
like the entire world is a map.

1021
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,180
And like you said, a lot of it is just kind of generated.

1022
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:28,500
But let's say you go to your park nearby and your park is where the dungeons are and where

1023
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,820
you get the little doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo and you get like a secret thing and

1024
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,400
then you can kind of explore the air.

1025
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,400
That would be so badass.

1026
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:39,160
I'd be so into it, but I don't I have no idea if that is, you know, they wouldn't they

1027
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,720
would do retro Zelda anymore.

1028
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,480
They would just try to I don't know.

1029
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:49,240
It would just not be I don't I. Yeah, it's unfortunate because like stuff like, you know,

1030
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:54,760
especially like with Orna, I think is such a great concept that you will fifth dream

1031
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,200
says just reskin Orna to Zelda.

1032
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,720
Well, it's a different type of game.

1033
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:03,440
But yeah, I mean, if that they could do something like that, that would be kind of similar to

1034
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,560
like a Final Fantasy AR game almost.

1035
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:09,520
I mean, that's kind of what it is.

1036
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:14,720
But they could do like they they really could do a mobile Zelda game and it would work.

1037
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,720
All right.

1038
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:20,020
Hell, if you want to be super lazy about it, just pour it over the DS like Zelda games.

1039
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,480
They worked well with touch screen.

1040
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,160
Like that's how you played those games.

1041
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,880
No, no, no.

1042
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:25,880
Bad Loki.

1043
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:26,880
Where's my square ball?

1044
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,880
No.

1045
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:32,880
I do not want console games ported to mobile phone anymore.

1046
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,880
We're done.

1047
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:34,880
We're past that.

1048
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,880
So no, that sounds like a terrible idea.

1049
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,880
Bad.

1050
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,880
Time out.

1051
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,880
All right.

1052
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,880
Fine.

1053
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:40,880
Going to chat.

1054
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,880
Yes.

1055
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:42,880
It's you.

1056
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,880
One hundred.

1057
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,660
Matt says Niantic is taking notes.

1058
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:46,880
Don't give that away for free.

1059
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,160
And I wouldn't be the first time it's happened on this show.

1060
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,160
That's listening to.

1061
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:59,160
Well, well, anyway, OK, well, Niantic is not listening to.

1062
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,160
I don't.

1063
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,160
Maybe not anymore.

1064
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,160
Anyway.

1065
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,440
I don't know.

1066
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,440
We'll see.

1067
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:09,680
But you know who you are and you know where to find me.

1068
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,360
So let's talk if that's of interest to you, please.

1069
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,160
Anyway, let's see.

1070
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,560
What else is in the thing here?

1071
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:23,680
The app is scheduled to launch globally in twenty twenty one with Niantic as the publisher.

1072
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,700
That's another interesting note is that it is a game that's scheduled to release this

1073
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:31,120
year, which is interesting because did you all forget Niantic supposed to be doing a

1074
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,240
Catan game, a Settlers of Catan game?

1075
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,560
That was the other project they did out some time ago.

1076
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,760
There's there's Pokemon Go.

1077
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,160
There's Ingress.

1078
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:45,100
There's Harry Potter, although I think Portkey Warner Brothers does the bulk of development

1079
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,100
for that game.

1080
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,000
And they're just kind of using Niantic's database for that.

1081
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,920
But the Niantic social has been really crammed into that.

1082
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,200
And that was a big part of the Pokemon Go upgrades this week is that those two games

1083
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,640
are really joined at the hip at this point.

1084
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,640
So we'll see where that comes in.

1085
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,320
But anyway, those are the three games that exist now.

1086
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:05,080
They're supposed to be Settlers of Catan coming or Catan the World.

1087
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,080
I don't know what it's called.

1088
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:11,680
And now we know Pikmin will be game number five, four, if Catan gets slowed down anymore.

1089
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,680
I don't know.

1090
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,400
So and Catan is out.

1091
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,280
If you're in Australia or New Zealand or maybe it's just New Zealand.

1092
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,200
Sorry to any Aussie listeners.

1093
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,960
We may have listening if I'm wrong.

1094
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:26,600
But I think Catan is still in that beta test in those areas where Niantic really tends

1095
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,760
to test a lot of their products.

1096
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:34,840
All right, Akdev says, I think it's only New Zealand and that may very well be all right.

1097
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,840
You know what?

1098
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,960
It's a reward to New Zealand for doing COVID the right way.

1099
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,640
You get you get Catan.

1100
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,640
Congrats.

1101
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,120
And you'll probably get the Pikmin game too first.

1102
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,120
All right.

1103
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:51,280
Anyway, S200mattinchat says, New Zealand gets all the fun things like winning a pandemic.

1104
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,640
I know.

1105
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,820
Freaking competent leadership.

1106
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,840
It's pretty amazing what that'll bring.

1107
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,840
Anyway, Loki.

1108
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,800
Oh, oh, here's another gut punch on the mobile front.

1109
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,800
Hi, Loki.

1110
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,800
Although, I don't know.

1111
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,200
I actually don't think this is bad news.

1112
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,200
But Loki, whatever.

1113
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,200
You know what?

1114
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,200
I don't think it's bad news.

1115
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,760
I think we should celebrate this news.

1116
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:18,160
But no, they have to go and dash my hopes again, because that's just where we are in

1117
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,360
this world.

1118
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:25,320
So Square Enix was developing a port of Final Fantasy 11.

1119
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,080
They were developing it.

1120
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,320
OK, fine.

1121
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:34,440
Nexon was developing it and it was called Final Fantasy 11 R. And it was supposed to

1122
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:43,760
be some mobile MMO, but they, as of apparently February, have stopped development on it,

1123
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:49,980
saying that in early February, Nexon and Square Enix announced a mutual decision to cancel

1124
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:50,980
that project.

1125
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:55,860
Together, we decided that the game was not showing the level of creative differentiation

1126
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:59,340
that the players expect from a Final Fantasy franchise.

1127
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:04,180
And rather than release a game that doesn't break new creative ground, we agreed to step

1128
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,180
away from the project.

1129
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,180
Yay.

1130
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:08,180
No.

1131
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:09,180
Yay.

1132
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:14,840
Because that is a very long way of saying we realized Final Fantasy 11 was not fun to

1133
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,340
play on a mobile phone.

1134
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:20,540
And Loki, you would have you and look, I if Jobs were lost or something like that, I wouldn't

1135
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:24,920
be having this celebration, but they moved everybody to another project.

1136
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:29,000
Nobody finally, along the way, realized Final Fantasy 11 is going to fucking suck to play

1137
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
on a mobile phone.

1138
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,160
Yay for coming to that decision, because you're absolutely right.

1139
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:36,560
And Loki, you know it, whether you want to admit it or not, this game would have sucked

1140
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,560
on a mobile phone.

1141
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,560
Absolutely.

1142
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:43,680
I played on a tablet, then it would have been fine.

1143
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,520
I would have still played it.

1144
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:51,040
Now, if they take some of those assets that were built and maybe make a, say, Nintendo

1145
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:56,520
Switch version of Final Fantasy 11, now we're talking maybe a little more.

1146
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,880
Maybe I can get on board with something like that, but we'll see.

1147
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:03,840
I do think, and look, I had many great years in Final Fantasy 11.

1148
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:09,560
I do want to see Final Fantasy 11 be refreshed enough so that more people feel compelled

1149
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,420
in the year 2021 to take a look at it.

1150
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:15,680
I just think the answer was never port it to cell phones.

1151
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:19,320
I don't understand, you know, that would have just fundamentally changed the game.

1152
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:23,480
That wouldn't have even been Final Fantasy 11 the way we remember it.

1153
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:29,200
But I think, well, number one, the mod scene is still doing incredible things in Final

1154
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,200
Fantasy 11.

1155
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,200
Did you see that, Loki?

1156
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:35,600
Somebody went through and fucking upped all the textures in Final Fantasy 11 to like 4K.

1157
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:39,560
And so, like, there's a mod out there that will, like, basically make an HD version of

1158
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,560
Final Fantasy 11.

1159
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,320
And it looks pretty amazing.

1160
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:49,080
And it's also one of those things that makes you go, why won't Square embrace

1161
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,080
something like this?

1162
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:54,560
Well, maybe they couldn't because of the deal they had going on with Nexon.

1163
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:58,080
And that was going to be the next official Final Fantasy 11 product.

1164
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,760
So let me reiterate.

1165
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,580
Yay, it's canceled.

1166
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:06,960
So now they can do something else that's going to be a little more in line with what we would

1167
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,680
expect out of a Final Fantasy 11 reimagining.

1168
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:11,680
So there's that.

1169
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,680
All right.

1170
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:18,800
Loki, I don't mean to dance on your dreams and all that stuff, but Loki, it's for the

1171
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,160
best.

1172
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,400
It's for the best.

1173
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,400
I guess.

1174
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,400
All right.

1175
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,800
I'm not happy about it, though.

1176
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:32,200
No, I mean, I mean, I'm only happy because everybody got moved to another project.

1177
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,200
So we're fine.

1178
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,200
But anyway.

1179
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,200
All right.

1180
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:41,560
Moving on, let's talk about exciting things happening in the indie scene.

1181
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:44,400
That's always something to celebrate and say yay about.

1182
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:49,960
And Xbox did an event this week where they talked about indie games, indie games, indie

1183
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,680
games, and a fucking lot of indie games.

1184
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:53,680
There was a lot.

1185
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:54,680
Did you see that?

1186
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:55,680
I did Xbox.

1187
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,680
I think it's called.

1188
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,680
Do you see all that?

1189
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,680
Yeah, I heard about it.

1190
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,900
Yeah, I really only saw the bullet points.

1191
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,160
And they did a showcase.

1192
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:08,880
And in the showcase, over 20 games were confirmed that they are going to be on Game Pass at

1193
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:09,880
launch.

1194
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:15,800
And I think one of them just came out like the day after right away.

1195
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,080
Sorry, I forget which game came out.

1196
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:21,720
I forget the name in the moment.

1197
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:25,400
But there was a game that something, Moonlight, I think it was called.

1198
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:30,720
So anyway, some of the other games that are going to be coming to Game Pass.

1199
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:36,120
Art of the Rally, Astrea Ascending, Backbone, Boyfriend Dungeon, Craftopia, Dead Static

1200
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:40,160
Drive, Edge of Eternity, Hello Neighbor 2, that was one I know they're spotlighting

1201
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:48,000
a bit, Library of Ruina, Little Witch in the Woods, Moonglow Bay, Narita Boy, Nobody Saves

1202
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:55,760
the World, Omno, Re-compile, Sable, She Dreams Elsewhere, Stalker 2, The Ascent, Undungeon,

1203
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,720
Way to the Woods, and Wild at Heart.

1204
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,640
So all of those, again, they're coming to Game Pass the first day.

1205
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,840
So it's pretty impressive on Microsoft's part.

1206
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:09,160
And I think that's a great way for more indie games to get discovered as well, is that by

1207
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:15,720
kind of releasing on that Game Pass and going to that app where, hey, I can check this game

1208
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:18,960
out because it's part of what I have in my subscription anyway.

1209
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,360
I think it's getting those games out there to even a wider audience.

1210
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:28,160
And they're not getting lost in, say, Nintendo's storefront, where it's like if you don't succeed

1211
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:31,760
in the first week, you're going to get buried, or the way things work on Steam.

1212
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:32,560
Am I right, Loki?

1213
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:39,720
Yeah, I mean, definitely, it's, you know, easier to find those games and easier to check

1214
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:43,960
them out, especially, you know, I'm glad that they have the back of these independent

1215
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:48,320
developers to be able to kind of showcase their games.

1216
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:53,720
Plus, it's a guaranteed revenue stream because it is being included in Game Pass that they're

1217
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,960
getting money from that.

1218
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,560
So that's pretty nice as well, that deal.

1219
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:03,920
Genesis Noir is the game I was trying to think of that came right out on Xbox Game Pass.

1220
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,440
Yeah, that Nobody Saves the World 2, that's supposed to be a brand new RPG by the guys

1221
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,320
that did Guacamelee.

1222
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,320
So that looks pretty cool.

1223
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,320
Oh, that'll be fun.

1224
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,320
Very cool.

1225
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,320
Yeah.

1226
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,320
All right.

1227
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:19,240
Akdeft in chat says, Art of the Rally kind of reminds me of RC Pro-Am.

1228
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:25,600
So, yeah, there's, you know, a lot of these indie titles, honestly, they get their influence

1229
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:29,520
from an established IP, and then a lot of them do it even better.

1230
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,320
So that's pretty, pretty cool.

1231
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,520
All right, let's move on with some more news.

1232
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:35,520
Loki.

1233
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:44,640
So, Sony is planning on shutting down the stores for the PlayStation 3, PSP and Vita

1234
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:45,640
this summer.

1235
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:46,640
Rumor.

1236
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,640
Rumor.

1237
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:55,040
Yes, allegedly, so the rumor is that they're closing the PlayStation 3 and PSP versions

1238
01:02:55,040 --> 01:03:02,700
of the store early July and then shutting down the Vita version in late August.

1239
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:07,480
So apparently that will, I don't think you'll be able to purchase any more games through

1240
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:08,480
that.

1241
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:14,560
You will still have, possibly have the option to redownload previously purchased titles,

1242
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:18,760
but you won't be able to purchase brand new titles anymore, or at least not through those

1243
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:19,760
services.

1244
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:20,760
Yeah.

1245
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:26,480
Yeah, I mean, this is something we've seen, like, Nintendo do.

1246
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:31,640
Not surprising, but we'll have to see if it actually happens.

1247
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:32,640
Probably would.

1248
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,920
I could see them doing that.

1249
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:40,440
I know we've seen a lot of stories also about, like, so-called pirates preserving some of

1250
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:46,760
these games, but I don't know if that's necessarily what they're doing.

1251
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,480
But sure, sure.

1252
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,120
People say that you're doing it for game preservation, not piracy.

1253
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:57,120
Well, I mean, but this begs the question, you know, again, like, if I'm not allowed

1254
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,320
to buy the game anymore, what choice do I have?

1255
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,320
True.

1256
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:04,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

1257
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,880
But the developers, you know, the publishers or whatever of these games aren't receiving

1258
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,200
any money either.

1259
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:16,480
So yeah, I get it, you can't purchase the game, but I don't know.

1260
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,480
Yeah.

1261
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:23,960
I think at that point, though, like, the money's been made, but it still sucks.

1262
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:31,440
Yeah, I just I wish Sony was embracing backwards compatibility.

1263
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:37,040
I know their current, you know, management feels a certain way about it, but I think

1264
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:41,360
Xbox has been winning a lot of favor with people because they've recognized they were

1265
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,760
going the wrong way with backwards compatibility in the beginning, too.

1266
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,120
But I think they recognized that that was a mistake and really opening their library

1267
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:50,520
to backwards compatibility, and especially the part where they're making the older games

1268
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:54,360
even better through something like the auto HDR and, you know, something like, you know,

1269
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:58,320
I was talking last week, I played Oblivion for a little bit because it was on Game Pass

1270
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,280
and it looks even better than it did.

1271
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:03,000
Of course it does, because I have a nicer TV now and all that stuff.

1272
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,200
You know, it looks great compared to what it did on the 360.

1273
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:11,200
So it's just a shame that Sony won't do the same thing.

1274
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:15,720
Now, Sony would say, oh, well, you can still experience our rich PlayStation 3 library

1275
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,840
through PlayStation Now.

1276
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:20,320
Nobody wants PlayStation Now.

1277
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:26,120
Well, and I think a big part of that is because it's cloud based and I don't think everybody

1278
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:30,400
wants cloud based, especially when we're still living in this era of data caps.

1279
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,400
And you know, OK, but where's PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1?

1280
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,120
You know, that was a big part of what was on the PlayStation 3 store.

1281
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:42,280
There was a lot of PlayStation 1 classics on there that you really can't get anywhere

1282
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:46,760
else once that's gone, because my PlayStation 5 can't play a fucking PlayStation 1 game.

1283
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:47,760
You know what I mean?

1284
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,760
Or PlayStation 4, whatever.

1285
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:54,800
And that's going to suck because games like, say, you know, great, great PlayStation 1

1286
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,760
games like, say, Suikoden 1 and 2.

1287
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,140
You know, those games were really hard to find for a while.

1288
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:02,120
And then when they came out on the PlayStation 3, it was like, awesome.

1289
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:05,740
We can get these digitally because there's no such thing as digital scarcity in the Sony

1290
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:07,360
universe until now.

1291
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:11,220
All these years later, now we're just going to be losing the store altogether.

1292
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:15,500
And we can't really trust Konami to ever get their shit together to get these games

1293
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:19,220
re-released on PlayStation 4 or 5 or what have you.

1294
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:23,680
So I think Sony is doing a big disservice by getting rid of a lot of these PlayStation

1295
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,180
1 and 2 games as well.

1296
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:31,000
Now there's rumors, you know, we love to talk rumors, that Sony is going to address the

1297
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,820
backwards compatibility thing.

1298
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:37,220
But I'm not going to put stock in that because their track record doesn't really show that.

1299
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:41,780
I would be pleasantly, pleasantly surprised if they have a change of heart on that front.

1300
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:46,620
And that's something we hear about come June or whenever.

1301
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:47,620
We'll see.

1302
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:52,020
It would be nice, but yeah, we've been hoping for that for a long time now.

1303
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:53,020
Yeah.

1304
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:56,900
Dartesuya in chat says, yeah, Sony is really bending over backwards to drop the ball in

1305
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,580
this backwards compatibility stuff.

1306
01:06:58,580 --> 01:06:59,580
And it sucks.

1307
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:00,580
Yeah.

1308
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:01,740
And I mean, the same thing goes with the Vita and that stuff.

1309
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:05,460
I mean, Jason mentioned in the intro tonight and I thought that was a great PSA.

1310
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:06,660
Sure.

1311
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:13,540
I might have downloaded games to my Vita and my PSP, but thanks to battery bloat and what

1312
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:18,260
actually can happen to those batteries, those devices may not work anymore.

1313
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:20,960
And I can't exactly go buy replacements either.

1314
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:26,540
So my digital library on those consoles, gone forever.

1315
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:32,260
Because for whatever reason, the PlayStation TV had to be a separate fucking thing and

1316
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:36,140
couldn't have just been integrated into the PlayStation 4 or 5 to be able to play Vita

1317
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:37,140
games.

1318
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:38,140
I don't understand.

1319
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:45,660
Well, you just see that the power of the PlayStation 5 cannot run a Vita game at this point.

1320
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:47,180
It doesn't make any sense.

1321
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:48,180
It really doesn't.

1322
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:53,980
And again, why did I buy a Xbox Series X as compared to a PlayStation 5?

1323
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:58,100
A lot of it had to do with backwards compatibility and the fact that there weren't a ton of launch

1324
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:01,920
titles last year that were on either system that were very compelling.

1325
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,880
So it was really about who I thought was going to handle the back library better.

1326
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,440
And I think I made the right choice with Microsoft, especially after hearing about all these fucking

1327
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:14,200
hoops people have to jump through to get their Marvel's Avenger PlayStation 4 file to work

1328
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,200
on PlayStation 5.

1329
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,200
It's ridiculous.

1330
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,200
All right.

1331
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:24,780
Anyway, let's move on and talk about a game that came out this week that's been having

1332
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:25,780
some...

1333
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:27,120
Oh, boy.

1334
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,280
This game sounds like a hot ass fucking mess.

1335
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:30,280
And I'm going to...

1336
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,280
Full disclaimer.

1337
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,720
Because everybody's told me not to.

1338
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:39,000
Even though I like the people behind it, everything I've heard about this game, the demo wasn't

1339
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
good.

1340
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
The game's not good.

1341
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,400
And it's been having issues.

1342
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,760
It's Balan Wonderworld.

1343
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:50,800
And apparently, just to pour salt on the wound, the last boss fight decided to do this whole

1344
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:55,160
flashing thing, which I don't know how this misses QHX and things like that.

1345
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,640
Or maybe it did get hit in the QHX.

1346
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:04,120
But even then, how did it not get prioritized as a must fix type of thing is the flashing

1347
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:07,360
that happened on the final boss fight, which can even cause seizures.

1348
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:10,440
It just wasn't prioritized, much like how...

1349
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:13,060
I think the same thing happened with Cyberpunk.

1350
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:14,060
They had the same issue.

1351
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:17,320
They had to tone it down.

1352
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:21,820
So they did now, just to be clear, there is a day one patch for the game and the day one

1353
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:24,240
patch does handle the issue.

1354
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:28,440
But for all those journalists that were reviewing the cop writing their negative reviews of

1355
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:32,840
the game in advance, that was sure a nasty little gotcha for those that got to the final

1356
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,200
boss fight.

1357
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:39,120
There is video of it on YouTube, but again, I just told you, it could make you sick.

1358
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,240
So I really wouldn't go seeking that out.

1359
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:44,480
There's much more interesting things you could watch on YouTube.

1360
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:53,920
So it's another kick in the ass of this game, which has just not been getting great.

1361
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:59,560
Like buzz, great reviews or anything, which is weird because it's coming from Sonic, dude,

1362
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,920
and you know, Phantasy Star Online and all that stuff.

1363
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:06,560
I think the expectations were a lot higher and wow.

1364
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:11,620
Shane is in chat saying, I don't have flashing light problems usually, but that video did

1365
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:13,440
not make me feel the best.

1366
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,700
Darktitsuya said, yeah, I heard about this one.

1367
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,400
Just glad they're fixing it day one.

1368
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,200
So may try to get it at some point.

1369
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,400
I did kind of like the demo.

1370
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:24,480
It's out now, by the way, and it was fixed in that day one patch.

1371
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:28,840
Just please make sure you get that patch before you get all the way to the final boss, because

1372
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:32,280
this would be a nasty surprise sitting in the game.

1373
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:33,280
That's a bummer.

1374
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,760
Any interest in Balan Wonderworld from you, Loki?

1375
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:36,760
It looked cool.

1376
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:42,680
I just, you know, I have too many games right now that I haven't played, so.

1377
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:43,680
I don't know.

1378
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:44,680
It looks like a very cool game.

1379
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:45,680
It's just.

1380
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:48,000
I probably won't buy it anytime soon.

1381
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
All right.

1382
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,080
Well, I think we need to take a trip down memory lane to a time when we had classic

1383
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:58,400
games that didn't cause such headaches and check out that video, the video, man, that's

1384
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,400
a lot of flashing.

1385
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:03,040
I don't know how that got past them.

1386
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,840
That yeah, that seems like something that they should definitely have dressed.

1387
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:06,840
I agree.

1388
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:07,840
Anyway, let's get to it.

1389
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:12,240
The classic game of the week.

1390
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:17,320
So this week to help us with the classic game of the week, since Dark Sakura is out tonight,

1391
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:20,060
I have brought in a very special guest.

1392
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:23,140
One that I think is familiar to most of you O.L.R. regulars.

1393
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:24,920
Say hello, everybody, to Alan Alchemy.

1394
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:25,920
Hey, Alan.

1395
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:26,920
Hello.

1396
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,560
How are you doing?

1397
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,560
I'm doing all right.

1398
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:30,560
How are you?

1399
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,560
I am good.

1400
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,800
And thanks for being able to fill in tonight on short notice.

1401
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,600
I guess it helps that you, you know, we live together and all that.

1402
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:38,600
Yes.

1403
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,600
All right.

1404
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,600
So, you know the drill.

1405
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,040
Every week here on the show, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and picks a game that

1406
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:46,460
she wants to highlight as the classic game of the week.

1407
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,340
Although once a month, she puts a twist on it, but you're not doing that tonight.

1408
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:52,280
You're helping to fill in for a classic game.

1409
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:56,020
So Alan, what have you picked for this week's classic game of the week?

1410
01:11:56,020 --> 01:12:01,000
Well, when you ask me to pinch hit like this, I did have to take a look on Wikipedia and

1411
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,280
see what came out 10 years ago, which is morbidly depressing because I could have swore that

1412
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:09,520
a lot of those games came out three years ago, not 10.

1413
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,680
So yeah.

1414
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:18,020
I saw something that caught my eye that played for, uh, that I had played, uh, for a bit

1415
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:22,900
when it was fresh meme all back all the way back in October of 2010.

1416
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:26,900
Um, it's actually a game that had a little bit of a preview in 2008.

1417
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:32,580
I'll get to that in a moment, but I am talking about super meat boy, which came out on October

1418
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:40,220
20th, 2010 for, I believe Xbox 360 live arcade came on, uh, became available on their online

1419
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:41,820
store for the Xbox.

1420
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,360
I cannot believe this game is 10 years old.

1421
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:49,240
Although I think I saw a tweet just a couple of days ago that said something like the time

1422
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:54,720
between the super Nintendo and the Xbox three 60 release now matches the time between the

1423
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:57,780
Xbox three 60 release and now something like that.

1424
01:12:57,780 --> 01:13:05,000
So it's like, yeah, it's just like when the difference between now and Nirvana's, um,

1425
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,760
smells like teen spirit when we were in high school was the same as like red Zeppelin's

1426
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:09,880
houses, the Holies.

1427
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:10,880
It's like, fuck off.

1428
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:13,100
You know, I don't need your factoids.

1429
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:14,220
I'm not interested.

1430
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:17,820
I'm not here for these reminders of, you know what?

1431
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:19,520
I don't like facts.

1432
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,000
Get them away from me.

1433
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,740
We don't like facts here at OLR.

1434
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:23,740
This is good.

1435
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:25,940
This is why I know I can always count on you to fill in the segment.

1436
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:26,940
All right.

1437
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:27,940
I'm sorry.

1438
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:28,940
So super meat boy.

1439
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:29,940
Yes.

1440
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:32,520
I spent plenty of hours on this myself.

1441
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:38,960
So this game started out as a flash game on new grounds, uh, who remembers new grounds,

1442
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,920
the sort of more innocent.

1443
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,060
I don't want to say it's more innocent for a chance.

1444
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:44,060
What does that make?

1445
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:45,060
What does that even mean?

1446
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:53,340
Um, it was new grounds was just a, a big cornucopia of amazing, weird off kilter content.

1447
01:13:53,340 --> 01:14:00,660
You had salad fingers and like awesome games and ego Raptor from game grumps got to start

1448
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:01,660
on new grounds.

1449
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:07,800
And so did the behemoth studio that made alien hominid and also, um, castle crashers all

1450
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,440
has roots in new grounds.

1451
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:17,200
So a lot of like elder millennial and like gen X programmers really glommed on a new

1452
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:21,540
grounds in the late nineties and eventually built careers that are still relevant to this

1453
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:26,680
day at super meat boy is a game that was put out on new grounds and it got so much hype

1454
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:32,360
and traffic that they were able to leverage that into a real, um, self published title.

1455
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:40,840
Um, it was, uh, designed by Edmund McMillan and Tommy, uh, this is where I should probably

1456
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,040
look up names before I try to say them.

1457
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:51,360
Uh, Thomas Raffens, Tommy Raffens, apologies under the collective name of team Matt, much

1458
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:58,920
better to say, um, this, uh, super meat boy to me, um, was a culmination of a lot of things

1459
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:05,160
that were in sort of the ether in sort of like the self-published sort of bootleg ROM

1460
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:11,620
type style games that were popular in the late two thousands, uh, games like I want

1461
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:20,600
to be the guy games like asshole, Mario, Ron hacks, basically that really pushed punishing

1462
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:28,840
intense difficulty and repetition, memorization, um, super meat boy was, uh, it's a, it's a

1463
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:29,840
platformer.

1464
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:34,400
Um, the sprites are very small, but there's a lot of pixels and there's a lot of detail.

1465
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,120
The soundtrack is incredible.

1466
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:42,960
Um, as the super in the title evokes, it's very much a intentional retro aesthetic game.

1467
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:47,880
It looks like it could have been made on the super NAS or Genesis, especially when you

1468
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,400
get that awesome soundtrack.

1469
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:57,840
And the plot of it, um, is you are a little ball of flash, honestly, um, who lives with

1470
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:02,160
his girlfriend bandage girl, cause he's constantly bleeding.

1471
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:04,680
Um, and she's a bandaid.

1472
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,320
How could I be more obvious?

1473
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:12,080
Um, one day bandage girl is kidnapped by Dr. Fetus and intelligent fetus and a life support

1474
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,080
suit.

1475
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:16,800
Um, and it's, it's rescue the princess.

1476
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,080
It's a rescue the princess game.

1477
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:22,560
And there are a ton of levels.

1478
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:27,560
Um, I don't know exactly how many, uh, but yeah, it is.

1479
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:32,640
The type of game where you want to get from point A to point B, uh, you're navigating

1480
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,000
these sort of scrolling levels that sometimes you go down.

1481
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,600
Sometimes you go to the right.

1482
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:45,920
There's traps, bombs, spinning blades, double jumps that inquire very specific timing.

1483
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:50,720
And when you die, you leave a ghost of your attempt.

1484
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:57,200
And then as you finish the level, it will show you the ghosts of every attempt that

1485
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:02,680
you had needed to get to the fucking, whatever the objective is for that level.

1486
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:03,680
That's very humbling.

1487
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:07,400
When you would see a hundred of those little fuckers all over the screen, like just screwing

1488
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:08,400
up left and right.

1489
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,080
It is a mechanic.

1490
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,080
It is a mechanic.

1491
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:15,440
Sorry to interrupt it as the mechanic that they introduced or that they, that was replicated

1492
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:20,920
in Mario maker because in Mario maker, you can see where everyone else dies.

1493
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:22,320
No, that's very true.

1494
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:23,320
Good point.

1495
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:30,200
And as a matter of fact, I think, and this is a little tinfoil hat for me, the fact that,

1496
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:36,840
um, super meat boy got the sales that it did, given that we already had seen, um, ROM hacks

1497
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:40,600
like asshole Mario, I want to be the guy and so on.

1498
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:46,880
I don't think Nintendo really knew what the demand was like for a professionally done

1499
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:51,800
suite of like, let's make, let's take super Mario brothers and make it hard as fuck.

1500
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:55,160
Let's make it like, cause people were already doing that.

1501
01:17:55,160 --> 01:18:00,880
And I think when this, I think put the writing on the wall where it's like, Oh, if we make

1502
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:04,320
a Mario maker, it will be successful.

1503
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:08,800
And the fact that that feature of the ghosts of all the previous attempts, even from online

1504
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:14,480
people, just to see where most people die when they attempt the stage, the fact that

1505
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:19,200
that brought India, it was brought into Mario maker to me is not a coincidence, but that's

1506
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,200
just me.

1507
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:26,920
He's sort of trying to be, you know, I mean, nobody can really prove that, but you know,

1508
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:31,560
one could argue, it does seem like Nintendo may have taken influence from, you know, super

1509
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:36,600
meat boy and what the indie community did for the Mario series, which in turn heavily

1510
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,520
had influenced super meat boy in the first place.

1511
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,520
It's just, it's very interesting.

1512
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:43,960
I mean, again, we can't prove it, but it's, it's very interesting.

1513
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:52,880
And I also believe that super meat boy success also gave the cup boy, um, developers the

1514
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:57,920
sort of it's in the air sort of green light that they needed to motivate themselves to

1515
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:03,840
put out cup boy, like, Oh, there is a market there for incredibly stylized.

1516
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:09,560
I mean the graphics in cup boy are based off of like thirties animation, but the quality

1517
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:10,560
of the visuals is incredible.

1518
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,200
It's not really a cup head.

1519
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,200
Oh, cup head.

1520
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,200
I'm sorry.

1521
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,200
Okay.

1522
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,200
Cup head.

1523
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:25,800
Um, uh, they were like, Oh, so, and also dark souls came out in like 2009 question

1524
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:30,400
mark, uh, dark, uh, demon souls came out 2000, what, five, seven.

1525
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:36,880
Um, so that it was in the air that gamers were all a bunch of fucking masochists and

1526
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:43,120
would like whip us, whip me, beat me, daddy and super me boy was more than happy to oblige

1527
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:48,540
like dark souls, like all of these asshole Mario Ram hat.

1528
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:54,720
So and also, um, cup head, excuse me, of just really fucking difficult to the games.

1529
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:59,480
Uh, super meat boy, the fact that it, I had never really heard of it cause I had fallen

1530
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:00,480
off of the new grounds.

1531
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,440
I wasn't checking it like every day or every week.

1532
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:05,520
Like I had in the nineties and early two thousands.

1533
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:11,340
So, um, yeah, it was a game that was ultimately put out on every platform that you could think

1534
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,240
of because it's a digital footprint.

1535
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:14,240
Isn't all about large.

1536
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:20,040
It's a 2d scroller and it came out on the three 60 on windows proper.

1537
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,860
I think it's on steam.

1538
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:22,860
It's on the Vita.

1539
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:27,440
It's on the Wii U it's on the switch, it's on the PS four and there's a Linux build for

1540
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,440
it.

1541
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,240
It's everywhere.

1542
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:37,120
And it's sequel, um, came out in December of this most recent year.

1543
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:42,880
So that's a pretty significant gap between the original game and the sequel and it wasn't

1544
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,280
quite as well received.

1545
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:45,280
That's for sure.

1546
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:46,440
But I do want to, isn't it a runner?

1547
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:47,440
Didn't they change it up?

1548
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,080
And I think it's more like an endless runner.

1549
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:53,600
Um, but, uh, the, uh, three 60, I think is always going to be my favorite version because

1550
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,400
I, sorry, but the soundtrack is way better than that one.

1551
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:00,480
And I realized they ended up having some disputes and so they ended up having the soundtrack

1552
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,480
completely rewritten.

1553
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:05,880
Um, but in my opinion, that original soundtrack was, was superior to the new one, no offense

1554
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:07,760
to any composers involved.

1555
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,240
That's just my opinion.

1556
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,240
Yeah.

1557
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:16,080
Um, yeah, I barely see, I played this for a bit and then I got distracted by something

1558
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,080
else.

1559
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:24,240
So, um, I can't necessarily say that I've beaten this game top to bottom and done every

1560
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:25,440
level 10 times.

1561
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:29,120
Um, but this definitely caught my attention for a bit and it, it, it's a unique enough

1562
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:35,440
title that, um, I wanted to make sure that it got a spotlight in classic game.

1563
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:42,360
Meat Boy, um, has made cameos in, uh, roughly a dozen, if not more, uh, titles.

1564
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:48,880
He's appeared as an unlockable or DLC character in Bit.Trip Runner, Bit.Trip Fate, uh, Runner

1565
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:56,480
2, um, Spelunky, Dust and Elysian Tail, Ori and the Blind Forest, Retro City Rampage,

1566
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:01,720
uh, Ilomilo and Indie Pogo.

1567
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:09,120
Um, PETA came out with, and here's the thing that I hate about, I mean, PETA is just a

1568
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:14,220
horrific like organization, whatever their mission statement is there, they're bad.

1569
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:19,460
There's other ways to, to, um, I guess make their talking points that don't have to come

1570
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:21,540
out of their platform in particular.

1571
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:26,540
But one thing that frustrates me about them is that when they put out a parody flash video

1572
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:29,020
game, they hire good flash programmers.

1573
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:33,660
If you remember the tofu cookie mama game that came out for Thanksgiving, that game

1574
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:35,300
was a jam.

1575
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:39,500
That was a good flash game where you had to like carve the tof- the tofurkey and like

1576
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:40,920
put the stuffing in it.

1577
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:42,300
It was a fun game.

1578
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:47,980
Um, so PETA in protest of this game, even though I don't necessarily know that Super

1579
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:52,380
Meat Boy is made of beef, I think he's just like, he's just blood.

1580
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:53,780
I don't know what he is.

1581
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:55,900
He's married to a bandaid.

1582
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:59,820
I don't think, I don't think, no one told PETA that it wasn't that serious, but they

1583
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:07,860
came out with a parody flash game called Super Tofu Boy, um, on December 1st of 2010 to protest

1584
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:10,380
the game and promote veganism.

1585
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:13,520
Um, I don't think you eat or cook anything in Super Meat Boy.

1586
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,020
You're just a ball of blood trying to rescue his girlfriend.

1587
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:18,820
So again, it's not, it's not that deep.

1588
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:24,320
Um, but in response, Team Meat, uh, added its own interpretation of Tofu Boy on the

1589
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:27,700
PC version of actual, uh, Super Meat Boy.

1590
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:30,220
So yeah, I think he was a character in the Steam version.

1591
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:34,940
Um, the game success, again, I mentioned this before, spurred the development of the 1930

1592
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:36,900
style animated video game Cuphead.

1593
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:37,900
Interesting.

1594
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:38,900
All right.

1595
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:40,300
All right.

1596
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:44,260
Well, there it is your classic game of the week, Super Meat Boy.

1597
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:46,140
Very good pick, Alan.

1598
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:47,140
Thank you.

1599
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:51,060
Um, Hey, before I let you go, um, I know you've been doing a lot more streaming here on Twitch

1600
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:52,060
recently.

1601
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:56,900
Um, and you know, we've even hosted your channel a couple of times after OLR, but for our podcast

1602
01:23:56,900 --> 01:24:00,780
crowd, um, who doesn't, you know, um, get those, you know, hosting things on Twitch

1603
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:01,780
and stuff.

1604
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:02,900
Do you want to tell us really quick about your channel?

1605
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:05,300
Cause you've been, you've been doing like a lot more streaming.

1606
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:08,460
I know I've talked about streaming, but you've been really committed to it over the past

1607
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:12,060
month and what you're up past a hundred followers now, which for somebody just starting out

1608
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:13,700
in their first month, that's really incredible.

1609
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:14,700
You're doing great.

1610
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,660
Um, you want to tell us a little more about your channel?

1611
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:17,660
Yeah.

1612
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:21,540
Um, I've, I haven't quite had a solid week where I've stuck to the schedule that I've

1613
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:26,420
sort of designed for myself, but I have consistently done about three nights a week, if not four,

1614
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:27,420
which is pretty good.

1615
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:28,700
I've been doing it for a little over a month.

1616
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:34,220
My Twitch channel is AlanAlchemy, A-L-L-E-N, A-L-C-H-E-M-Y.

1617
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:39,020
My Twitter is AlanA-L-L-E-N underscore T-T-V.

1618
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:44,140
I'm a variety streamer focusing right now on Dead by Daylight, but of a more important

1619
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:50,300
interest to OLR listeners is that on Monday I decided to do Music Night Mondays where

1620
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:52,700
I try out various music games.

1621
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:59,140
A lot of it so far has been a retro, um, music games of established, you know, nostalgic

1622
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:00,140
properties.

1623
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:01,340
I haven't done Parappa the Rapper yet.

1624
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:04,700
I don't know if I will because I never really clicked with Parappa, believe it or not, but

1625
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:08,180
I've been doing a lot of Bust a Groove in the US.

1626
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:09,180
It's called Bust a Move.

1627
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:10,500
I have the Japanese versions.

1628
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:11,500
Thank you very much.

1629
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:15,820
So I've been playing Bust a Move, but the dance game, not the, um, the Marvel puzzle

1630
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:16,820
game.

1631
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:18,500
Um, I've been doing lots of Space Channel Five.

1632
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:22,980
I did Rez last Monday, which was a lot of fun.

1633
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:29,180
Um, so I may eventually broaden that to do stuff like Jet Set Radio or Jet Grind Radio

1634
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:31,660
because that's very much a music game in my opinion.

1635
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:40,740
Um, but yeah, when I'm not doing Music Night Mondays, um, I am focusing on Dead by Daylight

1636
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:47,500
and I've thrown in some, um, beefcake slutty Skyrim, um, for the, for the gay, for the

1637
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:52,220
gay men out there and the, uh, women who like to look at, um, barbarians who aren't wearing

1638
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:53,220
a lot of clothing.

1639
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:57,300
Um, it's a lot safer to broadcast than perhaps, um, what is it?

1640
01:25:57,300 --> 01:26:04,540
Bitchin' Bad Conan, whatever that game is with the, with the full schlong, um, but yeah,

1641
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:05,540
it's a good time.

1642
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:06,540
All right.

1643
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:11,580
I hope, I hope our podcast listeners will check that out over at, um, Alan Alchemy on

1644
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:16,320
Twitch and, um, hope you're able to continue growing your channel and, um, good luck with

1645
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,620
all the, uh, Dead by Daylight and all that good stuff.

1646
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:21,620
You know, one thing, um, I really enjoy when I'm watching your channel and, you know, I'm

1647
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:25,580
not just saying this cause like we're married and stuff, but, um, is that I like that you

1648
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:28,420
kind of explain, you know, I didn't know a lot about Dead by Daylight and there's a

1649
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:31,980
lot of people on Twitch that stream Dead by Daylight, but when I first watched you do

1650
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:35,620
it, you were really kind of explaining the why behind a lot of things you were doing.

1651
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:37,620
And I think that really helped me understand the game.

1652
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:39,740
And I know you've been doing that with a lot of the other stuff you play.

1653
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:43,260
So I definitely encourage, um, you know, I know a lot of people on Twitch kind of be

1654
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:46,980
like, I'm a variety streamer, but I like a variety streamer who kind of like also educates

1655
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:48,020
a little bit on games.

1656
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:49,020
And I think you do very good.

1657
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:50,020
Yeah.

1658
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:53,780
I don't know if I could ever just be a one game streamer because a lot of people on Twitch

1659
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:57,620
are successful because they play Dark Souls or Fortnite and that is all they're allowed

1660
01:26:57,620 --> 01:26:59,940
to play by their fan base.

1661
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:03,960
So yeah, I'm not going to pigeonhole myself like that, but I definitely do think that

1662
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:05,820
Dead by Daylight is a really fun game.

1663
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:06,820
All right.

1664
01:27:06,820 --> 01:27:10,620
Well, thank you for joining us tonight and, uh, filling in last minute here on the classic

1665
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:15,260
game of the week when dark soccer is out tonight, um, we'll, uh, ask everybody to follow you

1666
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:19,260
on Twitch again over at Alan Alchemy, and we'll see you back on the show again soon.

1667
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:20,940
I'm sure Alan have a good one.

1668
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:21,940
All right.

1669
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:22,940
Thank you.

1670
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:24,100
All right.

1671
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:28,020
Thanks once again to Alan for filling in, uh, on this week's classic game of the week.

1672
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:29,300
That was a great selection there.

1673
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:30,300
Super Meat Boy.

1674
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:32,620
Loki, you've dropped a lot of hours on that game too, right?

1675
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:33,620
Super Meat Boy.

1676
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:40,220
Um, yeah, I've played through, I think the single, like I, I think the original game,

1677
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:45,740
I, I don't know if I beat it or I freak, I might've beaten it.

1678
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:48,860
I don't remember, but yeah, I played through a lot of that.

1679
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:51,820
Well, one thing we didn't end up getting into in that segment was the whole fact that there's

1680
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:54,100
like the light world and the dark world.

1681
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:57,180
So maybe like you played through the light world stages and it's like, Oh, the dark world

1682
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:58,180
ones were even harder.

1683
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:03,140
I did the dark world stuff too, um, hard levels to go back and look, but it's been a while,

1684
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:08,940
but yeah, I did play through that quite a bit, um, a while back, but yeah, it's a great

1685
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:09,940
game.

1686
01:28:09,940 --> 01:28:10,940
All right.

1687
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:12,900
Well, thanks again to Alan for filling in with very little notice tonight.

1688
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:13,900
Appreciate that.

1689
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:17,420
All right, let's get to some rapid fire news and check out some other things going on in

1690
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:18,420
the industry.

1691
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:20,500
Loki, start us off, please.

1692
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:21,500
Yeah.

1693
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:23,860
So, um, this is pretty cool.

1694
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:29,580
We've got some updates for a relatively old game, serious Sam too.

1695
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:33,700
Um, and this is kind of actually a little bit like the story we talked about last week

1696
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:40,740
with grant the photo online and how we had some independent developers creating mods

1697
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:42,900
to update a game and make it better.

1698
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:45,300
And then that being released officially.

1699
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:46,540
So that's kind of what happened here.

1700
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:52,780
Uh, we had an independent developer, Nathan DWK Brown released a huge update for serious

1701
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:54,920
Sam too.

1702
01:28:54,920 --> 01:29:01,340
And it, um, it's basically the last update or the first update since the game launched.

1703
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:05,940
Um, I don't know, like almost 15 years ago, it's been, it's been a while since they've

1704
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:10,820
had an update and, uh, you know, added a lot of different things to it.

1705
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:16,660
So some of the things added a couple of new weapons, um, sprinting, dual wielding rocket

1706
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:23,700
jumping and visual up and, or updates to the visuals and animation, uh, radar that tracks

1707
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:27,000
enemies, NPCs and new objectives.

1708
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,860
So that's a pretty major overall.

1709
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:36,220
Um, that's pretty awesome to see like an older game like that, get some love like that.

1710
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:42,020
And you know, uh, crow team actually did partner with them to, uh, release that update.

1711
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:43,940
So, uh, it's pretty awesome.

1712
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:48,980
And according to the announces says, I hope all, uh, hope that all that was done helps

1713
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:51,460
keep the game enjoyable for a long time to come.

1714
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:54,620
Um, if that works out, it was all worth it.

1715
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:56,900
Long live serious Sam too.

1716
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:58,740
So pretty awesome.

1717
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:04,900
Um, now this brand new game that's coming out here, Outriders, uh, which is coming out

1718
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:10,540
soon, they are planning to, uh, mark cheaters in the game.

1719
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:17,420
Um, so if they catch someone cheating, they're actually going to brand them as a cheater.

1720
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:29,460
And apparently they said out of the, um, demo players, only about 0.01% of them were cheaters,

1721
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:34,220
but, um, they said that every single one of the cheaters who gave themselves, you know,

1722
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:41,660
I guess 600, um, ill gotten legendary weapons, uh, apparently are going to be banned or they're

1723
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:45,180
not gonna be banned, but they're going to be punished in other ways for starters, there'll

1724
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:49,340
be kept in separate, um, or kept separately from legit players.

1725
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:53,780
So like some of the other games, including grants that online, um, they'll make you basically

1726
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:55,920
play with other cheaters.

1727
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,740
And they're also going to give you a small discreet, but easiest spot Mark that will

1728
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:01,040
be added to your HUD.

1729
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:07,480
So, um, if you're a popular streamer and you're cheating, they will be able to see

1730
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:08,480
that you're cheating.

1731
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:09,480
Interesting.

1732
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:12,360
It's like the Scarlet letter, but for cheaters.

1733
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:13,360
Yeah.

1734
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:18,760
So some of the things of course that would be, um, considered cheating, they said intentionally

1735
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:24,600
running a game on PC without easy anti-cheat modifying game files to enhance character,

1736
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:30,160
uh, level skills and inventory, et cetera, extremely modifying the game to reduce time

1737
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:35,680
dependent features such as vendors and challenges using a trainer program or similar to gain

1738
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:39,920
advantages within the game and use the gameplay altering programs such as aim bots or wall

1739
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:40,920
hacks.

1740
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:41,920
Hmm.

1741
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:42,920
So, all right.

1742
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:49,560
Don't you, they're out to mark you, um, uh, Shane and chat says, what even is Outriders?

1743
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:53,600
Should I be excited for it and do the early download on Xbox series X?

1744
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:58,280
Isn't it, is it, isn't it like a West, like a Western, but like robots kind of like loot

1745
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:59,840
shooter type of thing in it.

1746
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,320
Is that for my Square Enix?

1747
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:09,640
Um, I don't necessarily, it looks a lot like, um, uh, like, I don't know, it looks a lot

1748
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:11,960
like destiny two or something like that.

1749
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:18,820
So I don't know if, what exactly it is per se, um, but it looks neat.

1750
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:22,360
It is a cooperative third person role-playing game.

1751
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:25,800
Um, and it's, uh, published by Square Enix in Europe.

1752
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:30,280
Um, and they're saying it's a third person shooter, but it's mixed with elements from

1753
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:31,720
role-playing games.

1754
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:35,880
So you customize your characters and you choose from four classes, including the trickster,

1755
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:41,080
the pyromancer, the Devastator, and the technomancer, um, and, uh, the basic skills you have have

1756
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:42,080
a cool down time.

1757
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:45,800
So again, that sounds very much like destiny, uh, and then a skill tree that you use to

1758
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:47,480
unlock and upgrade skills.

1759
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:51,080
You can use weapons like shotguns and, uh, assault rifles.

1760
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:56,000
Um, and, um, well, you know, DJRMS says it's first person, not third.

1761
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,960
It's interesting cause I'm reading off the like official little script thing.

1762
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,480
So I don't know why they're classifying it that way.

1763
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:04,720
Um, let's see, uh, there's various role-playing elements.

1764
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:08,680
So you can explore different hub areas, talk to NPCs, do side missions.

1765
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:10,280
There's dialogue trees.

1766
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:14,000
That's something destiny doesn't have, uh, that can affect the outcome of some conversations.

1767
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,780
You can play solo or with two other players.

1768
01:33:16,780 --> 01:33:21,480
And it's about humanities efforts to colonize Enoch, uh, where, uh, there was a massive

1769
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:25,780
energy storm known as the anomaly, uh, which is, uh, supposed to be indicating hope for

1770
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:27,240
humanities feature.

1771
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:30,580
And that's where some of the, um, superpowers, I guess, come from.

1772
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:31,580
So there you go.

1773
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:34,300
Uh, Shane and chat says I can make a character.

1774
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:36,860
I mean, that's probably enough for me to make me want to try it.

1775
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:37,860
Yep.

1776
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:38,860
You can.

1777
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:39,860
All right.

1778
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:40,860
Yeah.

1779
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:41,860
I mean, it looks interesting.

1780
01:33:41,860 --> 01:33:42,860
Yeah.

1781
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:43,860
I'll, I'll probably check it out.

1782
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:45,900
I've been hearing good things about it based on the demo.

1783
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:47,020
All right.

1784
01:33:47,020 --> 01:33:48,020
Uh, moving on to some other games.

1785
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:51,940
So this is a game, uh, that's, uh, very popular is rocket league.

1786
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:52,940
And it's kind of surprising.

1787
01:33:52,940 --> 01:33:54,220
We don't have it on mobile phones.

1788
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:57,300
Well, we're going to be getting a version of it on mobile phones, kind of a different

1789
01:33:57,300 --> 01:34:00,420
sort of game, but it's going to be on iOS and Android.

1790
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:07,500
Um, it's rocket league side swipe, and you can play in solo games in this or team up

1791
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:11,140
with a friend or two, uh, for two, two versus two matches.

1792
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:13,060
And those will last for two minutes each.

1793
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:16,940
Uh, the perspective is a 2d side on view.

1794
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:17,940
So it's a little bit different.

1795
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:21,260
And that way you use touch controls that are a little bit easier to pick up.

1796
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:25,500
So, uh, they're gonna hopefully do free to play kind of similar to how rocket league

1797
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:26,500
is now.

1798
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:30,180
So there's that, uh, DJ Rama S by the way, correcting himself in chat saying, yes, it

1799
01:34:30,180 --> 01:34:31,580
is third person.

1800
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:33,380
All right.

1801
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:40,120
Uh, also in rapid fire news, a ghost of Tsushima movie is coming with John wick directing.

1802
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:44,360
So yeah, this is another big video game going into the movie territory.

1803
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:48,300
And of course this one, a lot of, you know, game of the year types of awards.

1804
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:52,720
So it's, it's maybe just surprising that the whole thing isn't a franchise yet becoming

1805
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:55,560
a movie, but it's, uh, it's going to become a movie.

1806
01:34:55,560 --> 01:35:01,280
Uh, so Chad Stalski who made the John wick franchise, uh, or directed it, I should say

1807
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:02,920
is going to be directing this.

1808
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:03,920
So that's pretty cool.

1809
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:08,040
A deadline, uh, reported on it and Sony confirmed it.

1810
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:09,360
So pretty cool.

1811
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:14,000
Of course, we have no idea when it's coming out, but, you know, give it two years.

1812
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:19,560
Probably take a little while, especially, uh, with the pandemic still sort of like,

1813
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:20,560
are we ending?

1814
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:23,680
Are we not like still trying to figure out where that's all at.

1815
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:25,240
All right.

1816
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:29,240
So we've been experiencing a little bit of a technical difficulties live on Twitch.

1817
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:33,120
Um, so we're going to pick up our show again here, sorry, going to create for a little

1818
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:37,920
bit of an awkward podcast, but, uh, you know, Hey, at least, uh, we'll have a podcast this

1819
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:38,800
week.

1820
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:43,800
So I believe the, uh, recording started to, uh, get a little dicey when we were getting

1821
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,080
into release dates.

1822
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:46,080
So let's try that again.

1823
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:47,080
Loki.

1824
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:49,920
Uh, apparently we had a bumpy flight the first time let's travel around the world again and

1825
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:53,760
check out some release dates starting in the U S there's too much Kingdom hearts for the

1826
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:56,560
stream to handle clearly.

1827
01:35:56,560 --> 01:36:02,920
So this week we've gotten to me, uh, Neptunia virtual stars coming out on PC, Disco Elysium,

1828
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:08,200
the final cut on PC, Mac, PlayStation four, PlayStation five and stadia.

1829
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:13,520
We have evil genius to world domination, a whole bunch of Kingdom hearts.

1830
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:21,440
So we've got Kingdom hearts, HD 1.5 remix, 2.5 remix, 2.8 final chapter prologue three

1831
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:26,580
plus remind and melody of memory all coming out on PC.

1832
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:32,640
We have Narita boy on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one rogue company

1833
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:39,840
on PlayStation five, the binding of Isaac repentance on PC.

1834
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:48,480
We have death crown on Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one and Tucci on PC, Nintendo

1835
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,040
switch and Xbox one.

1836
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,040
All right.

1837
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:56,280
Well, before we had our little technical hiccup, a couple more things, uh, outriders and resident

1838
01:36:56,280 --> 01:37:01,520
evil seven biohazard, both coming to stadia outriders also coming out on PC PlayStation

1839
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:04,680
four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series X.

1840
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:06,680
Uh, do you have a price on Disco Elysium?

1841
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:13,120
Paley Hanumaya and chat is wondering Disco Elysium, uh, on which system?

1842
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:17,360
I mean, I assume it's all like 60 bucks, but let's see here.

1843
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:18,360
I don't know.

1844
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:19,960
What do I look like?

1845
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:24,920
GameStop act deaf to chat is guessing this is what the internet is for.

1846
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:25,920
Okay.

1847
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:26,920
All right.

1848
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:27,920
31 99.

1849
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:28,920
All right.

1850
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:29,920
Thank you.

1851
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:30,920
All right.

1852
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:32,760
Uh, traveling over to Japan.

1853
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:36,120
So we were talking a little bit before the technical hiccups about outriders.

1854
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:38,400
That is also coming out in Japan on April the first.

1855
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:40,460
So that is coming out on the PlayStation five.

1856
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:43,000
It is also coming out on the PlayStation four.

1857
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,780
And quite honestly, that is really the only release this week.

1858
01:37:45,780 --> 01:37:49,280
It's a pretty, uh, uneventful week in Japan otherwise.

1859
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,600
So let's move on to the UK.

1860
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:54,360
Loki, uh, the UK, we didn't have a whole lot coming out.

1861
01:37:54,360 --> 01:38:00,320
We have also outriders coming out on PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox series X, Xbox

1862
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:03,080
one and stadia.

1863
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:09,520
And then we also got, um, monster truck, uh, it was like monster truck rally, which is

1864
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:13,620
coming out on, uh, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

1865
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:18,280
So, uh, as the show 100, Matt and chat wants to know when his battle totes coming out since

1866
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:23,160
you were already at boat, but you can get it on game pass.

1867
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:24,160
He can.

1868
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:25,160
All right.

1869
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:26,880
Uh, let's get back into some other news.

1870
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:27,880
Uh, Loki.

1871
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:28,880
Oh boy.

1872
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:29,880
More rumors.

1873
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:30,880
Boy, my favorite.

1874
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:31,880
Yeah.

1875
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:36,720
Well, it's, it's more adding onto the same rumors that we've already had, uh, regarding

1876
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:40,880
an upgraded Nintendo switch that's coming out later this year, uh, according to a Bloomberg

1877
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:46,040
report, they're saying that it's going to be powered by a new, uh, Nvidia system on

1878
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:52,320
chip that's in the dock using to, uh, they're going to be using that chip to upscale the

1879
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:56,680
graphics to four K and the way they're going to be doing that is kind of similar to how

1880
01:38:56,680 --> 01:39:04,440
the RTX, uh, graphics cards kind of do it right now, um, using DLSS, which is basically

1881
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:10,260
a deep learning super sampling, which allows them to basically take a very, uh, low resolution

1882
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:17,960
image and, um, use AI to sharpen it and also kind of enhance the, um, image altogether.

1883
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:20,360
They I've some modern games have been using it.

1884
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:24,660
Like for example, I know cyberpunk uses that, um, it looks nice.

1885
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:27,020
So it is a pretty cool technology.

1886
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:31,680
Um, along with that, there's some other rumors regarding the pricing.

1887
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:36,940
They're saying that the pricing, not supposed to be about three 49 to three 99, uh, it's

1888
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:42,980
supposed to be out sometime this year, but, uh, I'm wondering what the DLSS, if that'll

1889
01:39:42,980 --> 01:39:47,020
enable them to do, you know, be able to run some of these games that they haven't been

1890
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:48,020
able to run already.

1891
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:52,780
Um, but we'll have to see, I mean, that's really kind of just talking about the dock

1892
01:39:52,780 --> 01:39:53,780
right now.

1893
01:39:53,900 --> 01:39:55,740
Um, but that's all rumors.

1894
01:39:55,740 --> 01:40:00,420
I know I'm getting so tired of these switch pro rumors, like Nintendo read the room.

1895
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:03,620
Like everybody is sleek in this stuff left and right.

1896
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:04,620
Just give us something.

1897
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:08,460
I think they will in June, if they don't announce something by June, then I don't know what

1898
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:10,460
the hell's going on.

1899
01:40:10,460 --> 01:40:12,140
Yeah.

1900
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:14,260
And I maybe, maybe April 1st.

1901
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:15,260
Yeah.

1902
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:18,660
I wouldn't believe anything you read on the internet on April 1st, but now it's getting

1903
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:22,100
into this weird thing where like companies are actually doing things on April 1st, right?

1904
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:24,180
Like Outriders is actually coming out April 1st.

1905
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:25,180
That's not a joke.

1906
01:40:25,180 --> 01:40:26,180
It's a Friday.

1907
01:40:26,180 --> 01:40:27,180
Yeah.

1908
01:40:27,180 --> 01:40:28,180
Friday release date, I think.

1909
01:40:28,180 --> 01:40:29,180
No, that's not Friday.

1910
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:30,180
That's a Thursday.

1911
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:31,180
Why is it coming out on Thursday?

1912
01:40:31,180 --> 01:40:32,180
I don't know.

1913
01:40:32,180 --> 01:40:33,180
That's a weird day.

1914
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:34,180
Yeah.

1915
01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:35,180
Should be the second.

1916
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:36,180
So Wednesday is a holiday here in California.

1917
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:37,180
So, uh, which is the 31st.

1918
01:40:37,180 --> 01:40:38,820
So I know April 1st is a Friday.

1919
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:39,820
So yeah.

1920
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:41,820
All right.

1921
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:44,020
Anyway, let's move on.

1922
01:40:44,020 --> 01:40:49,140
Uh, actually Shane in chat, uh, says, I just want to see what exclusives look like on it.

1923
01:40:49,180 --> 01:40:53,660
Um, yeah, that would be, uh, the Nintendo first party games, the limited, uh, Mario

1924
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:54,660
3D All-Stars.

1925
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:56,020
You can no longer buy what it might look like.

1926
01:40:56,020 --> 01:40:59,380
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf is also pointing out Friday is Good Friday.

1927
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:00,820
So that might be why.

1928
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:04,240
So maybe they don't want to release a game on Good Friday cause there's, you know, people

1929
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:06,540
that are, are partaking in religious service that day.

1930
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:07,540
I don't know.

1931
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:08,540
Who knows?

1932
01:41:08,540 --> 01:41:12,260
I wouldn't think it would be that many, but I guess, I guess so.

1933
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:13,420
All right.

1934
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:18,080
Let's move on to, I guess another rumor of sorts, although this one is being backed by

1935
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,760
the wall street journal.

1936
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:23,480
So there's probably some inside sources that are talking a little bit about this.

1937
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:29,520
And that is that Microsoft is apparently in talks to acquire discord and the price tag

1938
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:32,240
may set them back $10 billion.

1939
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:36,840
Um, and the wall street journal is going off of other reports from venture beat and Bloomberg.

1940
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:42,680
Uh, apparently these talks are being called advanced and exclusive and could result in

1941
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,400
a deal next month.

1942
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,000
However, it should be stated.

1943
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,840
Nothing is set in stone.

1944
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,080
Apparently there are other suitors out there as well.

1945
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:54,120
I have heard, um, Amazon's name being thrown around as well, which, you know, as you know,

1946
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:55,120
owns Twitch TV.

1947
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:57,720
Um, and there was another big one that was getting thrown around too.

1948
01:41:57,720 --> 01:42:03,400
And discord may just go public, um, as a company because you know what fucking Roblox went

1949
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:05,000
public not that long ago.

1950
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,000
They've done pretty well for themselves.

1951
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,480
Um, and there's been, you know, other entertainment gaming companies that have gone public, uh,

1952
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:11,480
and are doing pretty well.

1953
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:13,880
So discord may go that direction.

1954
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:20,720
Microsoft is, according to Bloomberg, interested in looking at getting discord, um, as a place

1955
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:26,480
to talk for the communities that are using it, not just the gamers on Xbox live.

1956
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:30,080
That is also kind of interesting to know is that Microsoft may not be looking at this

1957
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:34,560
as just a gaming platform, but certainly what's happened during the pandemic, you've seen

1958
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:38,740
a lot of community growth on a place like discord and sure that goes things for like

1959
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:40,040
video games and so forth.

1960
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:44,760
We have our own discord here at vog network, cheap plug, fognetwork.com slash discord.

1961
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:49,640
Um, but like D and D campaigns, which I suppose is also gaming, but then you also see other

1962
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:53,600
like other types of communities coming together through discord.

1963
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,840
Um, although certainly gaming is a huge part of that as well.

1964
01:42:56,840 --> 01:43:00,720
Loki, what do you think when you hear the news that Microsoft might acquire discord?

1965
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:05,880
Cause I could see mixed opinions here because you know, Microsoft didn't really end up doing

1966
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:09,520
the, the beam TV or mixer so well.

1967
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:14,440
They ended up selling that I didn't go really very far, but then they've also bought LinkedIn

1968
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:18,640
get hub and everybody was screaming with get hub that the sky is falling and it hasn't

1969
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:19,640
really fallen yet.

1970
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:25,040
So let's say this is true and Microsoft does opt to buy discord.

1971
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,840
Do you think this is good for them and what are they going to do with it?

1972
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:33,240
I hope they integrate it with Skype because that would suck, but other than that, I don't

1973
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:34,240
know.

1974
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:35,720
I hope it's a replacement for Skype.

1975
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:39,760
Frankly, I'll worry about it when there's something to worry about.

1976
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:40,760
That's true.

1977
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:43,040
Um, that's, that's very true.

1978
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:46,760
Um, dart to see you in chat says, initially I was concerned, but after listening to Bobby

1979
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:50,440
tonight, I think I feel a little better about the situation, so maybe it won't be so bad.

1980
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:53,960
And Bobby went really in depth on this in, on this subject on his show tonight.

1981
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:57,020
And you know, he, he had kind of brought up some of those other examples about the websites

1982
01:43:57,020 --> 01:43:59,240
that Microsoft bought that have done okay.

1983
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:01,840
And not everything is necessarily the sky is falling.

1984
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:07,600
I can see though, where maybe something has to change when it comes to discord.

1985
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:11,960
You know, where are they really making money right now off of those nitro subscriptions

1986
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:14,400
that aren't really required.

1987
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:19,520
And how many people in those communities are really paying for those subscriptions?

1988
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,920
Probably not a ton.

1989
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:26,000
Um, I pay for it cause I want to boost the VoG network server because you know, that

1990
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,720
should be something that, you know, we do to lift up the server and Bobby got into this

1991
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:33,720
on this show, if VoG network is a business could just pay 20 bucks a month or whatever

1992
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:35,080
to boost our server.

1993
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:36,460
We would do that, but we can't.

1994
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:40,880
So I have, I have discord pro just because I use discord a lot and I want to boost the

1995
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:44,000
VoG server to at least the next level.

1996
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,840
Um, but where would Microsoft really make money?

1997
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:53,240
I think we would all be very upset if we saw them go up like to a place where Slack went,

1998
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:56,680
where you have to pay to have a server or you're going to start losing messages.

1999
01:44:56,680 --> 01:45:00,240
You get really annoyed by all the prompts that start coming up.

2000
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:02,200
So I don't really see that happening either.

2001
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:07,140
And one thing that kind of occurred to me and I was always really surprised by this.

2002
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:11,480
Do you remember when discord launched a game store and then they tried to do their own

2003
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:14,200
game pass type of thing as well through nitro?

2004
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:19,600
I was really surprised that didn't do so well because I thought it was a brilliant idea

2005
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:26,300
that discord kind of stealth and solved itself onto all of these systems and on your phone

2006
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:30,620
as, Hey, this great free messaging app, but as we know, nothing's really free.

2007
01:45:30,620 --> 01:45:35,680
So I thought by putting that store on there, that's how they were going to really make

2008
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:40,880
some money was basically like they, they, they got something that people wanted to put

2009
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:41,880
on their computers.

2010
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:43,820
Unlike when steam first came out.

2011
01:45:43,820 --> 01:45:47,960
If you guys remember when steam first came out, people were pissed that you like had

2012
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:48,960
to have that to play.

2013
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:51,940
I think it was like half life two at the time.

2014
01:45:51,940 --> 01:45:57,320
So I really wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft does acquire discord, that they may try to

2015
01:45:57,320 --> 01:46:01,800
do something with their store in it, but then they say they don't necessarily want it to

2016
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:05,340
be tied to gamers, but I just, I would have a hard time believing they wouldn't try to

2017
01:46:05,340 --> 01:46:11,280
sell some of their products directly there through the application and do some tie-ins

2018
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:12,280
there.

2019
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:16,880
Loki, how do you think discord could be profitable?

2020
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:21,520
I mean, integrating it with game pass would be good if they could, you know, if Microsoft

2021
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:25,480
does end up purchasing them.

2022
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:26,480
I don't know.

2023
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:32,860
I mean, I think definitely giving more power to the folks that have servers and allowing

2024
01:46:32,860 --> 01:46:37,720
them to upgrade them, however they need, you know, whether that be, you know, adding additional

2025
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:46,340
bandwidth to the video or, you know, other features that may be in there, I don't know.

2026
01:46:46,340 --> 01:46:52,540
Does discord have any sort of like searchability or ways to actually have like stuff displayed?

2027
01:46:52,540 --> 01:46:56,860
Because like, I know there's like billions of different, I can't imagine billions, but

2028
01:46:56,860 --> 01:47:00,780
like probably several hundred thousand servers out there.

2029
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:05,180
I think if you're like a discord partner or affiliate or something that you apply for,

2030
01:47:05,180 --> 01:47:10,340
you can get listed in some type of directory that they have, but not every server is by

2031
01:47:10,340 --> 01:47:12,060
default in this directory.

2032
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:15,020
It's something that you apply for.

2033
01:47:15,820 --> 01:47:19,180
Now Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I still think they're going to try to make discord

2034
01:47:19,180 --> 01:47:20,700
with Xbox party chat.

2035
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:21,980
That would be pretty cool.

2036
01:47:21,980 --> 01:47:24,180
You want me to take that one step further?

2037
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:28,940
Because here's where I tell you where a Microsoft and discord partnership gets really fucking

2038
01:47:28,940 --> 01:47:29,940
exciting.

2039
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:33,540
I'll give you an example that goes a step beyond that that just occurred to me.

2040
01:47:33,540 --> 01:47:39,060
With Microsoft getting really into this cloud gaming thing, what if I could sit here in

2041
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:44,100
my home, Loki sits there in his home, and through discord now showing us a screen of

2042
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:48,580
the game we're playing, we're now playing a game online together through the cloud thanks

2043
01:47:48,580 --> 01:47:51,880
to discord that's embedded in our community.

2044
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:55,300
And that streaming technology, which is the only thing Microsoft kept from their whole

2045
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:58,340
beam acquisition.

2046
01:47:58,340 --> 01:48:05,820
I mean, it's an awful lot of wishes and gosh, I hope it goes the way I want it to and maybe

2047
01:48:05,820 --> 01:48:11,580
not enough reality check, but I don't know, Phil Spencer's pretty cool, but he won't be

2048
01:48:11,580 --> 01:48:15,580
the head of discord, sadly, and especially with Microsoft saying it's not all about gaming.

2049
01:48:15,580 --> 01:48:21,500
I don't know, but I think that would be a pretty cool thing to be frank.

2050
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:22,500
We'll see.

2051
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:27,480
Now, a lot of people are bringing up Microsoft teams, which is a little bit more of a direct

2052
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:31,500
Slack competitor and people are wondering if there could be emerging here.

2053
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:34,780
I still see teams as more of a professional type of thing, sort of like LinkedIn as a

2054
01:48:34,780 --> 01:48:36,380
professional social network.

2055
01:48:36,380 --> 01:48:41,780
I'm not sure that would fit the bill, but maybe Microsoft is totally okay having like

2056
01:48:41,780 --> 01:48:46,180
your daytime chat app and your nighttime chat app.

2057
01:48:46,180 --> 01:48:51,660
I prefer discord over teams.

2058
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:56,380
Discord is much snappier than teams as teams feels very bloaty and heavy.

2059
01:48:56,380 --> 01:49:03,940
I just, I would prefer if given the choice between using teams or discord, I would go

2060
01:49:03,940 --> 01:49:04,940
discord 100%.

2061
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:07,380
Well, and then maybe that's something that Microsoft wants to get in on.

2062
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:08,380
I don't know.

2063
01:49:08,380 --> 01:49:13,700
SG100map says, regardless, we won't see the full effects of the purchase until 18 months

2064
01:49:13,700 --> 01:49:16,260
after the sale, which will take a while.

2065
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:17,300
We will see.

2066
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:18,300
We will see.

2067
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:22,380
Bonds006 says, if only they allow me to do that, as you said it, Rob, but right, yeah,

2068
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:26,640
I know I'm doing a lot of wishful thinking, but I'm trying to also present some scenarios

2069
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:30,620
that I'd like to think are realistic without necessarily being doom and gloom.

2070
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:35,380
And that would be, oh, Microsoft buy something else just to close it.

2071
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:36,380
I still don't understand.

2072
01:49:36,380 --> 01:49:38,820
Well, no, I do understand why they closed Mixer.

2073
01:49:38,820 --> 01:49:43,500
They had a really hard time attracting the volume of the other places because, and it's

2074
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:44,700
just this simple.

2075
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:49,220
Anybody that wants to go up against Twitch, take notes.

2076
01:49:49,220 --> 01:49:55,060
If you don't have a way for your broadcasters to make money and they see a path to being

2077
01:49:55,060 --> 01:49:59,140
able to make money and advertise and may enable revenue on their streams and stuff, you can

2078
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:01,340
have a real hard time attracting talent.

2079
01:50:01,340 --> 01:50:05,220
And that was the problem with Mixer, period.

2080
01:50:05,220 --> 01:50:09,620
Now some people preferred Mixer because as an Xbox centric platform, it was a little

2081
01:50:09,620 --> 01:50:12,660
easier to get noticed over there in a different type of community.

2082
01:50:12,660 --> 01:50:15,440
So you can kind of stick out in a smaller community.

2083
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:16,440
And I respect that.

2084
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:19,940
And again, I have great friends who are broadcasting on Mixer and so forth.

2085
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:24,900
But the reality was Mixer was always going to lag behind Twitch because Twitch has a

2086
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:28,300
very easy path for their broadcasters.

2087
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:30,960
Not easy, but you know what it is.

2088
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:35,140
You know what the rules are and you have your little goals and the goalposts is right there

2089
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:36,320
and you know what you got to do.

2090
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:37,320
And it's achievable.

2091
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:43,120
Whereas, sure, Mixer had a path to partner, it wasn't an easy thing to do at all, especially

2092
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:45,580
on a smaller kind of network.

2093
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:51,980
The good news here is that if Microsoft buys Discord, there's nothing bigger than Discord

2094
01:50:51,980 --> 01:50:52,980
right now.

2095
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:53,980
There really isn't.

2096
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:57,540
As far as nighttime chat apps and groups, some may say, well, Slack is really a bigger

2097
01:50:57,540 --> 01:50:58,540
thing.

2098
01:50:58,540 --> 01:51:04,100
And I think when it comes to these types of hobbyist, gaming hobbyist, arts and crafts

2099
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:08,380
hobbyists and the things we've really relied on during the pandemic, Discord is the huge

2100
01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:09,720
thing right now.

2101
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:14,620
And so it'll be really hard for Microsoft to fuck that up, but we'll see.

2102
01:51:14,620 --> 01:51:15,660
All right.

2103
01:51:15,660 --> 01:51:17,980
At least it's not Google buying them.

2104
01:51:17,980 --> 01:51:20,340
Yeah, that's true.

2105
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:25,740
SG100Matt in chat says, we talked a sec ago about Nintendo not reading The Room.

2106
01:51:25,740 --> 01:51:29,500
I think Microsoft is reading The Room and I feel like they will leave the gamer part

2107
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:32,700
of Discord alone and use it in other systems.

2108
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:33,700
Hmm.

2109
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:34,700
We'll see.

2110
01:51:34,700 --> 01:51:37,700
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, at least it's not Facebook buying them.

2111
01:51:37,700 --> 01:51:38,700
We can say that again.

2112
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:39,700
All right.

2113
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:40,700
Oh, yeah.

2114
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:41,700
I'll be horrible.

2115
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:42,700
All right.

2116
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:43,700
Let's move on.

2117
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:44,700
Loki.

2118
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:45,700
All right.

2119
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:50,460
Well, speaking of playing games with other people, Steam had this brand, this kind of

2120
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:55,860
hidden update that they did recently to their remote play together.

2121
01:51:55,860 --> 01:52:01,940
So remote play together, if you may remember, was the way to basically invite a friend that

2122
01:52:01,940 --> 01:52:07,100
may not own a game that you have on Steam to come play with you kind of like couch co-op

2123
01:52:07,100 --> 01:52:08,100
type of thing.

2124
01:52:08,100 --> 01:52:13,340
Well, now they've updated it to where now not only can you invite someone that doesn't

2125
01:52:13,340 --> 01:52:17,920
have the game, but you can also invite someone that doesn't have Steam installed on their

2126
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:19,480
computer.

2127
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:24,560
So allows anybody to basically join you and play together remotely.

2128
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,940
Right now, there's about a thousand games supporting it.

2129
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:28,640
Not everything supports it.

2130
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:32,460
Only the games that do support remote play together.

2131
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:37,540
But like I said, there's over thousands of games already that support this.

2132
01:52:37,540 --> 01:52:40,000
So that's pretty amazing.

2133
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,680
Pretty neat feature to see what's going on.

2134
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:42,680
And they have a Steam sale right now.

2135
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:45,740
So, you know, go check that out.

2136
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:50,480
It's really funny that this story follows the Discord thing after that scenario I just

2137
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:59,200
proposed, because now here is Steam kind of doing that, but not with a community focus.

2138
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:05,120
I mean, sure, there are communities on Steam, like VoG has a community on Steam, but are

2139
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:07,360
people really using them?

2140
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:11,160
PlayStation had communities built into it, but was anyone really using it?

2141
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:12,160
No.

2142
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:13,160
So they closed it.

2143
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:15,560
That's what's making Discord so appealing.

2144
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:20,080
It has built communities in a way that no other gaming platform has been able to, that's

2145
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:21,080
for sure.

2146
01:53:21,080 --> 01:53:23,540
And thanks to the pandemic, it's gone way beyond gaming.

2147
01:53:23,540 --> 01:53:27,660
Sorry, I don't mean to completely go revert to the last story, but it's interesting that

2148
01:53:27,660 --> 01:53:31,580
there is that similarity here about the whole, well, Steam is now allowing this whole playing

2149
01:53:31,580 --> 01:53:32,620
together thing.

2150
01:53:32,620 --> 01:53:38,360
It's a bummer they don't have the real community behind it besides the friend list to really

2151
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:39,980
push this forward.

2152
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:40,980
Yeah.

2153
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:45,960
That's still pretty cool though, that they have that available.

2154
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:50,480
I don't know where I'd use that, but I have lots of games that probably support it.

2155
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:51,480
Yeah.

2156
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:56,320
So, yeah, pretty cool feature though, especially if your friends don't have Steam or maybe

2157
01:53:56,320 --> 01:54:00,920
can't install Steam or whatever, a good way for them to look into that.

2158
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:02,040
All right.

2159
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:04,720
And I believe this is our last story that's slated for tonight.

2160
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:09,840
And this one's kind of, oh boy, Crash Bandicoot 4 just came out.

2161
01:54:09,900 --> 01:54:15,700
And since it's an Activision game, they use the Battle.net app, which is part of Blizzard,

2162
01:54:15,700 --> 01:54:20,500
which is now part of Activision, right, to get Crash Bandicoot 4 out there.

2163
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:27,380
But something they weren't very forward with, Crash Bandicoot 4 requires Always Online.

2164
01:54:27,380 --> 01:54:30,180
Crash Bandicoot 4, by the way, is a single player game.

2165
01:54:30,180 --> 01:54:33,500
And there is no multiplayer mode that I'm aware of in Crash Bandicoot 4.

2166
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:35,340
I don't think they added one in or anything like that.

2167
01:54:35,340 --> 01:54:37,180
It is a single player game.

2168
01:54:37,180 --> 01:54:42,720
But yet it requires an internet connection to play on PC, which most of the Battle.net

2169
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:46,720
games do to be fair, but also the Battle.net games are almost all online.

2170
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:49,920
I would expect I have to be online to play World of Warcraft.

2171
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:51,640
I would expect to play Starcraft.

2172
01:54:51,640 --> 01:54:55,800
I probably need to be online, especially if I'm going to play with other people.

2173
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:57,300
And this goes a step further.

2174
01:54:57,300 --> 01:54:59,240
Now people are getting error messages.

2175
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:03,000
So like Diablo's infamous Error 37, yep, this is happening to people that are playing

2176
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,420
Crash Bandicoot 4.

2177
01:55:04,420 --> 01:55:08,880
They can't log in to the single player game that they purchased because Battle.net's having

2178
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:09,880
issues.

2179
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:15,040
Authentication servers are being overloaded, and this makes the game unplayable.

2180
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:20,180
Now something else to say here.

2181
01:55:20,180 --> 01:55:21,180
Why would they do this?

2182
01:55:21,180 --> 01:55:23,240
Oh, well, to avoid piracy, right?

2183
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:27,380
They don't want people to pirate the game because then pirates wouldn't be able to get

2184
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:29,720
around this Always Online requirement.

2185
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:31,460
Guess what?

2186
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:34,960
Pirates have already gotten around this Always Online requirement.

2187
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:42,140
So now we have a case where the piracy version of the game is, in a way, superior to the

2188
01:55:42,140 --> 01:55:48,200
actual version of the game because it'll actually connect.

2189
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:51,320
The retail version of the game won't let you play it right now.

2190
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:54,420
Well, sometimes won't let you play it.

2191
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:57,560
Right this minute, I'm sure it's fine, but there were certainly issues during this week.

2192
01:55:57,560 --> 01:56:00,000
Pirated version didn't have that problem.

2193
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:01,060
Oops.

2194
01:56:02,420 --> 01:56:07,500
What was Activision thinking giving a single player game Always Online DRM?

2195
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:09,500
Loki, any thoughts?

2196
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:11,940
They just don't care.

2197
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:14,300
They're just trying to make all the money that they can.

2198
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:15,620
I don't know.

2199
01:56:15,620 --> 01:56:18,380
Maybe they had...

2200
01:56:18,380 --> 01:56:23,720
I can't imagine there's that many people, like there'd be that much piracy with a Crash

2201
01:56:23,720 --> 01:56:28,940
Bandicoot game like that, considering also this version just came out.

2202
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:34,720
I think the other versions have been out for a while now, so it's like, I don't know.

2203
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:38,400
It's silly, but now this just tarnishes their PC.

2204
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:42,280
This is embarrassing for a company that doesn't need any more embarrassment right now.

2205
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:43,280
Exactly.

2206
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:44,280
Well, it's not even so much...

2207
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:47,560
That has not exactly been on an uptick lately.

2208
01:56:47,560 --> 01:56:52,000
And it's not even so much like that Crash Bandicoot 4 or anything.

2209
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,640
It's always going to be like, people are now going to second guess any Activision games

2210
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:57,640
that come to PC.

2211
01:56:57,640 --> 01:56:58,640
Is this going to be Always Online?

2212
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:00,340
Especially Battle.net.

2213
01:57:00,340 --> 01:57:01,340
Is this one going to be Always Online?

2214
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:05,940
You know, it's like, it's just, it's not good.

2215
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:08,000
But they don't care because they're going to make money.

2216
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:13,020
It is worth saying, Diablo 2 Resurrected is on many people's radar, right?

2217
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:15,660
Because that is something that Blizzard announced that got people excited.

2218
01:57:15,660 --> 01:57:17,400
It will be on the Battle.net app.

2219
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:23,940
Blizzard did say that this Diablo 2 Resurrected is playable offline.

2220
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:28,340
It will not require the Always Online connection, which you may recall was a very controversial

2221
01:57:28,340 --> 01:57:30,860
part of Diablo 3 when it first came out.

2222
01:57:30,860 --> 01:57:31,860
But I digress.

2223
01:57:31,860 --> 01:57:33,440
This Diablo 2 remaster.

2224
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:38,340
And the way Blizzards really explain this is that they really are putting an HD shell

2225
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:39,780
over their old games.

2226
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:42,480
So in a way, it kind of doesn't surprise me.

2227
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:48,160
But yeah, they have explicitly said, and maybe that's still the part of Blizzard that's cool

2228
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:52,820
versus the part of Activision that's never been cool.

2229
01:57:52,820 --> 01:57:55,120
So maybe that's kind of that coming to head.

2230
01:57:55,120 --> 01:57:56,120
I don't know.

2231
01:57:56,120 --> 01:57:57,120
Maybe.

2232
01:57:57,120 --> 01:58:01,320
FatNinjaDM in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says, that's the problem.

2233
01:58:01,320 --> 01:58:03,040
They weren't thinking.

2234
01:58:03,040 --> 01:58:06,300
Dart Satsuya says, does Battle.net have any other single player stuff?

2235
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:10,580
I mean, I can understand the DRM for the other multiplayer games, since you need net anyway,

2236
01:58:10,580 --> 01:58:11,960
but that does seem a bit extreme.

2237
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:15,040
One could argue that Diablo 3 doesn't have to be online.

2238
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:19,280
You can play it single player mode.

2239
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:22,320
I guess the same would be true of Starcraft, quite frankly.

2240
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:28,360
Although certainly the Blizzard games are usually more inclined to be player versus

2241
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:30,080
online and all that.

2242
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:33,560
Their recent arcade collection, though, that just came out when they did their virtual

2243
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:36,160
BlizzCon, that shouldn't need to be online.

2244
01:58:36,160 --> 01:58:38,160
I don't know if it is or not.

2245
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:40,240
I haven't looked.

2246
01:58:40,240 --> 01:58:44,800
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, they might have tried to, but some extensive stat tracking

2247
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:50,240
in Crash 4 that requires a connection to the home server, which is a terrible idea.

2248
01:58:50,240 --> 01:58:54,820
But I know a lot of games do keep track of how you play and phone home the anonymized

2249
01:58:54,820 --> 01:58:58,440
stats of your PlayStation play session.

2250
01:58:58,440 --> 01:59:03,140
So, all right, let's move on.

2251
01:59:03,140 --> 01:59:04,220
That's it for stories.

2252
01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:05,980
We're going to get to the listener roundtable.

2253
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:09,360
If you have some other comments or questions for us in chat, get them out there.

2254
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:12,020
Otherwise I'm going to go to the mailbag because I know we have at least one email tonight

2255
01:59:12,020 --> 01:59:13,280
that I saw come through.

2256
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:15,080
Loki, I don't have the email up right now.

2257
01:59:15,080 --> 01:59:17,640
So you have any last minute stories for us?

2258
01:59:17,640 --> 01:59:26,880
I don't, unfortunately, you know, it wasn't a whole ton going on this week, but yeah,

2259
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:33,800
I'm just still waiting for more game announcements and the death of Mario next week.

2260
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:36,200
We do have a comment in our chat.

2261
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:42,320
We do have a comment in chat from IceP1 who says, looks like Eve Online will be allowing

2262
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:45,160
playing straight in the browser in the future.

2263
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:47,700
And so eveonline.com if you want more information.

2264
01:59:47,700 --> 01:59:49,340
So there's no install needed.

2265
01:59:49,340 --> 01:59:51,980
In other news, work productivity drops.

2266
01:59:51,980 --> 01:59:56,020
And Bobby Blackwell cracks the joke about it's pretty easy to do spreadsheets in a browser

2267
01:59:56,020 --> 02:00:00,040
because some people have called Eve Online like a spreadsheets game, although obviously

2268
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:02,140
there are more intricacies than that.

2269
02:00:02,140 --> 02:00:06,360
But that's pretty cool about playing in a browser because, I mean, when you think about

2270
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:10,360
what was one of the big things that Google Stadia was pitching, you're going to be able

2271
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:12,640
to stream games from the cloud in the browser.

2272
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:16,240
So it's interesting that some games are kind of implementing this in their own way without

2273
02:00:16,240 --> 02:00:18,080
needing a Google Stadia.

2274
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:21,840
Do you think we'll see more companies kind of do that, kind of just do their own cloud

2275
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:25,520
gaming thing because they don't really trust the other companies to do it?

2276
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:28,640
I don't know if it's necessarily they don't trust the other companies to do it because

2277
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:36,520
certain companies are locking down their app stores so that they have to create browser

2278
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:37,520
based applications.

2279
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:40,840
And I also want to be very clear, this Eve thing I don't think is actually a cloud thing.

2280
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:42,200
It's just playable in your browser.

2281
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:43,200
So I do want to be clear.

2282
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:48,700
Yeah, I mean, because they're kind of forced to do that, you know, to get around certain

2283
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:51,680
restrictions with Apple in their app store.

2284
02:00:51,680 --> 02:00:55,280
So yeah, I could see him doing that.

2285
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:56,280
All right.

2286
02:00:56,280 --> 02:00:57,320
I got our email up.

2287
02:00:57,320 --> 02:00:59,600
So we do have one email tonight.

2288
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:03,400
If you want to send emails, participate at orangelawnsradio.com is the place to send

2289
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:04,400
emails.

2290
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:09,360
Tonight's email is Frodo Swagins, who writes, Hey, all super short email.

2291
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:11,040
I'm a podcast listener.

2292
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:13,440
The game It Takes Two just came out.

2293
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:14,440
OMG.

2294
02:01:14,440 --> 02:01:15,440
It's super cute and fun.

2295
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:17,600
I've never seen a cooperative game like this before.

2296
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:18,920
I can't sit it down.

2297
02:01:18,920 --> 02:01:21,120
I'm not going to review it here.

2298
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:22,120
You kind of did.

2299
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:23,120
But that's OK.

2300
02:01:23,120 --> 02:01:25,400
I mean, you gave it a positive thing.

2301
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:26,400
That's all right.

2302
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:27,560
We appreciate the feedback.

2303
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:32,640
I'm not going to review it here, but I hope if you haven't already, grab a friend and

2304
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:33,640
try it out.

2305
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:34,640
I have to make sense.

2306
02:01:34,640 --> 02:01:36,680
I haven't played It Takes Two.

2307
02:01:36,680 --> 02:01:38,480
I've seen it because I think it's on Game Pass.

2308
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:40,240
Have you played this at all?

2309
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:41,440
I have not.

2310
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:42,440
Chat, help us out.

2311
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:45,440
Anybody playing It Takes Two like our emailer tonight?

2312
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:48,200
Curious what your thoughts are on It Takes Two.

2313
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:49,760
Maybe someone in chat has played.

2314
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:50,760
Thank you.

2315
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:51,760
You know what?

2316
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:52,760
You can host next week's show.

2317
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:53,760
How about that?

2318
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:54,760
All right.

2319
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:55,760
I'm just teasing.

2320
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:59,600
Also, I noticed you don't take live calls anymore in the green room.

2321
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:01,840
I've been meaning to ask how come.

2322
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:05,160
And that is from Frodo Swagins in Portland, Oregon.

2323
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:06,920
Well, hello, Portland.

2324
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:08,840
I haven't been in about 11 years now.

2325
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:11,760
I really need to get back to Portland.

2326
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:14,040
So why don't we take calls on Discord anymore?

2327
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:20,280
It's because of the remote broadcasting versus when we were all in the same studio.

2328
02:02:20,280 --> 02:02:22,920
We're kind of not set up for it the same way.

2329
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:29,080
I probably could do some presto change-o and change some things and have the other person.

2330
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:32,720
But the thing we've noticed when we've done some guest appearances and things is that

2331
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:37,960
when we have more people on Discord, the frame lag starts to come in and the show starts

2332
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:40,280
to have some technical issues behind the scenes.

2333
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:45,080
So just basically long story short, technically, the bandwidth hasn't really worked out because

2334
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:49,440
we've been using all the Discord stuff so that we can tape remotely and still do our

2335
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:50,440
show.

2336
02:02:50,440 --> 02:02:57,080
The good news is Loki's vaccinated, I'm vaccinated, Dark Sakura's vaccinated or getting there.

2337
02:02:57,080 --> 02:02:58,080
We've started the...

2338
02:02:58,080 --> 02:03:01,480
Well, Loki's closer than any of us having the one and done shot, but we're all in that

2339
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:02,740
process right now.

2340
02:03:02,740 --> 02:03:08,300
So feasibly, in a few weeks, we can look at maybe returning to the studio if everybody

2341
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:09,660
feels comfortable with that.

2342
02:03:09,660 --> 02:03:13,100
However, I do have the issue where somebody else who lives here has still not been able

2343
02:03:13,100 --> 02:03:14,100
to get vaccinated.

2344
02:03:14,100 --> 02:03:20,660
However, California said by April 15th, that will be a long issue.

2345
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:24,180
So my hope is, and I'm just gonna throw this out there, I've talked to Loki about it, I

2346
02:03:24,180 --> 02:03:25,620
haven't talked to Dark Sakura about it.

2347
02:03:25,620 --> 02:03:33,900
My hope is June, specifically June 23rd, and whatever Sunday is closest to that, I haven't

2348
02:03:33,900 --> 02:03:38,620
looked at, that day, I think we may make a...

2349
02:03:38,620 --> 02:03:42,740
That would be a great day for us to come back together.

2350
02:03:42,740 --> 02:03:46,020
We will all be well fully vaccinated by that point.

2351
02:03:46,020 --> 02:03:49,140
I think it will just be a matter of where is COVID at in the world.

2352
02:03:49,140 --> 02:03:51,500
Technically we could probably actually do it before June.

2353
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:55,380
I'm just saying that's a very nice day, right, Loki?

2354
02:03:55,380 --> 02:03:59,260
That would be a nice day to be back together again would be on our anniversary, right?

2355
02:03:59,260 --> 02:04:00,660
We are starting over.

2356
02:04:00,660 --> 02:04:02,260
I think would be a good little tagline for...

2357
02:04:02,260 --> 02:04:03,260
Where have I heard that before?

2358
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:08,560
That would be a good little tagline for our show.

2359
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:11,620
That just depends on COVID and how all that's going.

2360
02:04:11,620 --> 02:04:16,300
CDC has said vaccinated people can hang out together without masks.

2361
02:04:16,300 --> 02:04:20,260
By that day in June, we will well be vaccinated without masks.

2362
02:04:20,260 --> 02:04:29,820
I think the whole decision is COVID still threatening the variants and all of that,

2363
02:04:29,820 --> 02:04:32,620
I think is the factor we still have to figure out.

2364
02:04:32,620 --> 02:04:36,180
Bobby Blackwell says, the 23rd is a Wednesday, how convenient.

2365
02:04:36,180 --> 02:04:41,700
So June 20th or 27th, fine, I will opt for the earlier day and do the 20th and say that

2366
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:47,260
right now on paper, that's the day I really want us to be able to come back into studio.

2367
02:04:47,260 --> 02:04:48,260
Maybe sooner.

2368
02:04:48,260 --> 02:04:53,540
We might just do May if things seem like it's gonna work that way.

2369
02:04:53,540 --> 02:04:57,980
So anyway, I know that's kind of a long winded question that went a little tangentially for

2370
02:04:57,980 --> 02:05:00,560
what you would really ask Frodo Swagons.

2371
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:04,900
But I guess my answer is it's not gonna be that way much longer, because I really want

2372
02:05:04,900 --> 02:05:08,180
us to be back all in the same studio the way we used to do it.

2373
02:05:08,180 --> 02:05:10,240
That would be great.

2374
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:12,380
And that's that.

2375
02:05:12,380 --> 02:05:13,380
See other comments in chat.

2376
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:15,380
SG100 Matt says, maybe early summer.

2377
02:05:15,380 --> 02:05:17,060
Yeah, who knows?

2378
02:05:17,060 --> 02:05:19,540
I just like that June date because it's nice.

2379
02:05:19,540 --> 02:05:24,740
But I suppose we could always do the end of May, which is technically when the live 365

2380
02:05:24,740 --> 02:05:25,740
stations started.

2381
02:05:25,740 --> 02:05:28,840
Because remember, we were running that station for about a month before we actually started

2382
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:29,840
our show.

2383
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:32,020
So I don't know, we'll see.

2384
02:05:32,020 --> 02:05:36,260
Tiger class says tomorrow, they're going to allow people 40 years and older to be vaccinated.

2385
02:05:36,260 --> 02:05:38,000
That just depends on where you live.

2386
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,220
So our show is based in California, Sacramento to be exact.

2387
02:05:41,220 --> 02:05:44,520
I think you guys know that I've said that a lot of times on the show.

2388
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:49,840
And here in the state of California, 50 and over, we'll be able to be vaccinated on April

2389
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:51,200
1st.

2390
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:55,320
And then everybody else on April 15th.

2391
02:05:55,320 --> 02:05:57,360
But again, the three hosts are already vaccinated.

2392
02:05:57,360 --> 02:06:03,840
Alan is the only one who can't get his Kaiser appointment to get it done.

2393
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:06,600
The system won't let him do it yet.

2394
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:09,280
Bobby Blackwell says June 1st is Vogg's birthday.

2395
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:10,840
So yeah, there's other dates that make sense.

2396
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:17,360
So just so you know where my brain is at, I'm hoping in the next couple months, we finally

2397
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:18,360
are able to come together again.

2398
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:20,360
And I think that'll be a very nice thing.

2399
02:06:20,360 --> 02:06:21,920
So we'll see.

2400
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:23,540
All right.

2401
02:06:23,540 --> 02:06:25,040
And we didn't have any last minute stories, right?

2402
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:27,120
So I think we are towards the end of the show.

2403
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:32,680
One more shout out for the mailbag, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

2404
02:06:32,680 --> 02:06:34,220
That brings us towards the end of the show.

2405
02:06:34,220 --> 02:06:35,960
Thank you guys for listening to the show tonight.

2406
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:39,560
I know it was a little rough live with the technical hiccups, but you guys are awesome.

2407
02:06:39,560 --> 02:06:40,600
You stuck with it anyway.

2408
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:42,160
Thank you so much for that.

2409
02:06:42,160 --> 02:06:44,320
Podcast listeners, there may be a little delay.

2410
02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:46,880
You might not get the show right at the same time you usually do.

2411
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:49,520
Just know it's because I had to kind of stitch some things together.

2412
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:52,140
Tonight's going to be a little bit of a Frankenstein episode.

2413
02:06:52,140 --> 02:06:53,140
But these things happen.

2414
02:06:53,140 --> 02:06:57,280
Thank you as well, podcast folks, for being here and being with us every week.

2415
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:58,280
We appreciate that.

2416
02:06:58,280 --> 02:07:02,320
Emails, tweets at OLR, all the ways you want to interact with us.

2417
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:03,580
We really appreciate that.

2418
02:07:03,580 --> 02:07:06,280
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lodge Radio, tell a friend or two about the

2419
02:07:06,280 --> 02:07:07,280
show.

2420
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:09,600
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2421
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:12,840
But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, what else are we going to be able

2422
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:13,840
to do?

2423
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:15,360
So, yes, please, please help us spread the word.

2424
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:18,280
That would be very appreciated.

2425
02:07:18,280 --> 02:07:19,600
What else was I going to say with all that?

2426
02:07:19,600 --> 02:07:20,600
Discord.

2427
02:07:20,600 --> 02:07:24,520
I guess I've plugged that a lot tonight, vognetwork.com slash discord.

2428
02:07:24,520 --> 02:07:28,280
If you feel so generous and you want to buy some merchandise, we do have a shop available

2429
02:07:28,280 --> 02:07:32,840
vognetwork.com slash shop if you are so inclined.

2430
02:07:32,840 --> 02:07:34,480
With that, I think we can get to final thoughts.

2431
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:37,640
I think that's all the plugs I'm supposed to give at the end of the show.

2432
02:07:37,640 --> 02:07:39,840
Thank you to Alan once again for filling in last minute.

2433
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:45,320
Thank you Chatroom for being patient tonight through all the Techhicups and always being

2434
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:46,920
a great support of the show.

2435
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:50,720
Loki, I will send it to you for your final thought.

2436
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:55,940
My final thought is I'm going to try to work more of my game.

2437
02:07:55,940 --> 02:08:01,200
It's already almost to the point where I could probably put it out physically, but I just

2438
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:04,520
want to cram some more stuff in there.

2439
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:07,440
My final thought is I'm going to work on being a better killer.

2440
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:09,440
I sure am.

2441
02:08:09,440 --> 02:08:11,340
In Dead by Daylight, of course.

2442
02:08:11,340 --> 02:08:17,000
And I still have some additional things for VOG floating around in my head.

2443
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,880
And I hope I get my ass in gear to do that real soon.

2444
02:08:19,880 --> 02:08:22,280
There's just a lot of other stuff going on personally, too.

2445
02:08:22,280 --> 02:08:25,400
But things are looking bright over the next couple of months.

2446
02:08:25,400 --> 02:08:26,400
Hang in there.

2447
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:29,440
We're almost to the end of this pandemic, but get your vacs when you can.

2448
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:30,440
Keep masking up.

2449
02:08:30,440 --> 02:08:31,640
Stay safe.

2450
02:08:31,640 --> 02:08:32,640
We're going to get there.

2451
02:08:32,640 --> 02:08:33,640
Damn it.

2452
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:34,920
All right.

2453
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:35,920
Have a good night, everybody.

2454
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:36,920
We'll see you next week.

2455
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:07,880
See you next week.

2456
02:09:33,640 --> 02:09:36,760
See you next time.
