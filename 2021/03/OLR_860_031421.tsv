0	13420	2013's Future of Entertainment is 2000 and dead!
13420	16980	And in a fun coincidence, when I was plugging my Xbox One back in recently, I accidentally
16980	20980	plugged the HDMI cable into the port that is meant for cable or satellite input rather
20980	22180	than TV output.
22180	25320	Imagine my amusement when I figured out and fixed that, the next thing I see is that that
25320	29520	port is no longer functional on my and all other pre-Xbox One S units.
29520	33240	This is just one story, join your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers and Loki for more on
33240	36040	this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every
36040	37040	gamer has a voice
37040	46200	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back, it is another week of the show
46200	52220	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio back with you once again here on Pi
52220	53220	Day!
53220	59900	Hurray it's Pi Day, March the 14th of 2021 with episode number 860 of our show.
59900	66020	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to, first off, DarkSakura or Jamie
66020	67020	Sommers.
67020	68020	Greetings.
68020	69020	Hi, how are you doing?
69020	77340	Doing okay, I thought I had massively overslept and then I remembered the thing, so.
77340	80700	Oh yes, that little show that we have on Sundays.
80700	81700	No, no, no.
82260	87540	I thought that I forgot about Daylight Savings and so I thought I had overslept and then
87540	90500	I actually quite literally remembered it 10 minutes ago.
90500	95740	Oh my gosh, okay, yes, yes, Daylight Savings, yeah, that was the thing that happened yesterday
95740	97820	too, yeah, for sure.
97820	103340	Well happy Pi Day, have you been able to celebrate with any Pi despite your nap?
103340	108260	I have Pi waiting for me in the other room, husband went by Sherry's for me to get me
108260	111500	my favorite strawberry rhubarb pie.
111500	118660	Oh, yummy, look, I know I get labeled with the pumpkin thing a lot because, you know,
118660	123620	I do really like the pumpkin flavored things, so of course I like pumpkin pie, but when
123620	129100	it comes to pie, I like a lot of, like, I love lemon meringue pie, I like key lime pie,
129100	132020	I like apple pie, and I like strawberry rhubarb pie.
132020	136820	There's lots of pie, I can't really think of a bad pie come to think of it.
136820	138900	I'm not sure there's a pie I can think of that's really bad.
138940	144420	I'm sure somebody could invent one or something, and don't be like, oh, oh, the pie that, you
144420	148500	know, the lady baked poo into and all that doesn't count, you know what I mean, like
148500	151380	an actual pie, it's something I can order at Marine Calendars.
151380	154700	Yeah, there's something I can order at Marine Calendars, I don't think there's a pie on
154700	157380	that menu I dislike, so there's that.
157380	158380	Anyway.
158380	160380	I like meat pies.
160380	164340	Oh, like a savory pie, I guess.
164340	165340	Exactly.
165780	168540	Our favorite little restaurant does those.
168540	169540	They're pretty good.
169540	170540	Touch of Britain.
170540	173700	Oh, I wasn't thinking of Touch of Britain, I was thinking of Petey Kitchen.
173700	177340	Well, yeah, Petey Kitchen does those, but those are more like a hand pie, and I was
177340	184900	thinking of like, you know, like a steak and kidney pie or, you know, something like that.
184900	187780	I don't know if I'd eat a steak and kidney pie.
187780	190060	Well, there's different kinds.
190060	194100	I like a steak and kidney pie, I think they're delightful, but yeah.
194860	197060	Alright, well, heading over to Techmaster Loki.
197060	198060	Hey, Loki.
198060	199060	Hey.
199060	202900	Would you eat a steak and kidney pie?
202900	204900	Like kidney beans?
204900	206900	No, kidneys.
206900	208860	Kidney, kidney.
208860	213140	Probably more likely than if it was kidney beans, I really like beans.
213140	214140	Sounds a little more manageable.
214140	218940	It's really just a different texture of meat.
218940	221820	Have you had any pie today, Loki, to celebrate?
222060	227020	No, the closest I had was I went to Roundtable and got breadsticks, but they were doing a
227020	232780	special for Pi Day, so they have like pizza pie for like $3.14 or something.
232780	233780	Perfect.
233780	234780	But that's about it.
234780	237620	I have pie in Animal Crossing that has a pie on it.
237620	239420	Do they do a pie event in Animal Crossing?
239420	241260	Yeah, you can get the pie meal.
241260	244820	You should order, Rob, you need to look in tonight to get your pie before it's gone.
244820	246380	I should, you're right.
246380	247380	For pie.
247380	248380	And all the Super Mario stuff.
248380	251380	For pie, I will look in, I will go into Animal Crossing.
251940	256140	And the Super Mario stuff, Rob.
256140	260980	And the Sanrio stuff is going to be, I think, available to start using tomorrow.
260980	261980	That's really cool, too.
261980	262980	Yay.
262980	263980	Awesome.
263980	267900	Well, it gives me reasons to look at Animal Crossing, that's for sure.
267900	271220	So before we get into our kickoff topic, I've had an interesting weekend.
271220	276380	Let me tell you, I've had very high highs and I've had very low lows.
276380	280940	So yesterday I get an email asking if I want to get the COVID vaccine.
280940	282900	And I'm like, fuck yeah, I do.
282900	284300	Like, let's do it.
284300	285300	Let's get to it.
285300	286300	Where?
286300	287300	When?
287300	288300	Which brand?
288300	289300	I don't give a fuck.
289300	290300	Just give me the vaccine.
290300	292440	Let's let's get some sense of normalcy.
292440	294980	So I actually I went and I got that done today.
294980	297620	So I had my first shot today.
297620	301620	And I'm sure people are wondering, how did I get the vaccine here?
301620	307780	I do want to stress this question, especially as we move into that phase of a lot of people
307780	310780	are going to you're going to see start getting the shot because of prior existing medical
310780	311980	conditions and things like that.
311980	315420	I do want to stress that generally this question is none of your fucking business.
315420	318540	And I think that's important when it comes to social media, like how someone got the
318540	319540	vaccine.
319540	324700	Well, HIPAA is kind of overused, I think sometimes because HIPAA really only applies to insurers
324700	325700	and health care entities.
325700	328140	It doesn't apply to the press or people.
328140	334180	Except that the places that you're getting vaccinated can't ask you about how you qualify
334180	336180	due to HIPAA.
336180	337180	I believe.
337180	340180	Yeah, I think going to the pharmacies, they cannot ask you.
340180	341180	Right.
341180	342180	So.
342180	347780	So anyway, but I will happily talk about it because we've had this show on for so long.
347780	351660	Some of our listeners, not a lot, but some of our listeners may remember when this happened.
351660	356740	Do you all remember when I was hospitalized back in 2008 and I was out of the show for
356740	358980	I feel like I was out of the show for almost a month.
358980	359980	It was it was a little bit.
359980	361380	I was in the hospital for a couple of weeks.
361380	363700	Well, I was in the hospital for like four days.
363700	367340	And I remember you're eating nothing but bread, which I don't even think I was supposed to
367340	368340	be having.
368340	370900	But anyway, I ended up having my gallbladder out.
370900	373940	So long story short, I had a condition called pancreatitis.
373940	377180	That's what it put me in the hospital and it was caused by my gallbladder.
377180	381180	So that puts on my medical record that I've had a history of pancreatitis because they
381180	383900	never really know if it's going to come back.
384060	387140	Thankfully, knock on wood, it's never come back.
387140	391420	But my understanding from talking to some friends who are really into science is that
391420	395700	if you get covid and you have pancreatitis at the same time, guess what?
395700	398560	Your mortality rate shoots up to 15 percent.
398560	403300	So I'm pretty sure because that was in my medical record that I'd had that before.
403300	407020	That's why, as California is opening up to people with medical conditions, I was able
407020	408820	to get the vaccine.
408820	415220	So I went today and again, I would encourage if you're eligible for vaccine, get it no
415220	416940	matter which one it is.
416940	418380	I did get Moderna.
418380	420820	I would have happily taken any of them.
420820	425260	But something about getting the Dolly Parton vaccine does feel very correct.
425260	427300	And I'm totally good with that.
427300	431600	But obviously, whichever one they would have offered, I would have happily taken.
431600	434340	And so I'm sure people are wondering, how are you feeling?
434340	435340	I feel fine.
435340	437580	My arm is a little sore.
437580	439340	I would just compare it to a flu shot.
439340	441900	Right now, everything I'm feeling is very similar to the flu shot.
441900	443100	The arm is a little sore.
443100	448940	I feel like a little bit of like, but it's not enough to stop me from doing this show.
448940	450740	I don't know how the second dose is going to go.
450740	453460	I hear that's the one that'll really kick your butt.
453460	457200	But at the end of the day, it's better than actually getting covid.
457200	459140	So there is that.
459140	462420	Now, one other thing I want to say about my weekend.
462420	464340	So yes, the covid vax happened.
464340	468020	I'm thrilled about that, that, you know, I'm starting down that road and hopefully it's
468020	469500	more and more my friends get it.
469500	473940	You know, I'm sure dark soccer, Loki are going to end up getting it in hopefully a matter
473940	474940	of weeks.
474940	475940	Right.
475940	480220	The president said May 1st as a you can schedule your appointment at least by then.
480220	481260	So fingers crossed.
481260	485820	And based on what I saw today, how fast they were moving people through at the state fairgrounds
485820	487780	like I it could happen.
487780	488780	We'll see.
488780	489780	We'll see.
489780	490780	There's lots going to happen over the next few weeks.
490780	494260	But hopefully it puts us on a path back to normalcy where like maybe we can all be in
494260	499580	the same room again and do this show in person like we did for 18 years or however long it
499580	501980	was until this pandemic started.
501980	506020	Pretty much a year ago at this point is when the first will need to tell us.
506020	507020	Yeah.
507020	508020	Yeah.
508020	512160	I know we're going to go back to using our old mics after this one, we'll have to figure
512160	513160	all that out.
513160	514160	So.
514160	515160	So we'll see.
515160	520100	And I also want to acknowledge the chat room because I see they started another hype train
520100	522220	while I was talking about the vaccine.
522220	524500	So thank you guys very much for that.
524500	527180	Over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
527180	528380	You guys are very generous.
528380	532320	I'll read everybody out individually as I usually do at the end of the show after we're
532320	533620	done being live tonight.
533620	537220	But you know, when you guys when you guys really, really go as far as like to start
537220	539140	a train, I kind of have to acknowledge that.
539140	542620	But of course, yes, we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine
542620	547620	o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network right after the
547620	549220	Bobby Black Wolf show.
549220	550900	So my weekend I said it was interesting.
550900	555500	Yes, the covid vaccine part was interesting, but you know what else happened on Saturday?
555500	561280	So I was driving downtown because my plan was to play some Pokemon Go down at Capitol
561280	565780	Park or in that area because I still had a quest I needed to finish and Pokemon Go to
565780	568860	get like forty five steel types to finish that whole thing up.
568860	573780	Well, while I'm driving downtown and I'm going through the downtown streets, I got no car
573780	574780	accident.
574780	575780	Yep.
575780	576780	Somebody hit my car.
576780	577780	Yep.
578180	583420	It was I was in the far left lane and she was in the lane right next to me.
583420	587200	She thought I had to turn it was because, you know, how like downtown is full of one
587200	589660	way streets and, you know, weird.
589660	593000	So she thought it was one of those streets where I had to turn and she wanted to turn.
593000	595940	So she turned right into my car.
595940	597740	I'm fine.
597740	599440	You know, it was thankfully it was low speed.
599440	601000	It was coming out of a stop sign.
601000	605060	My car, my passenger side door, on the other hand, yikes.
605060	609260	So luckily, you know, it's a crappy situation.
609260	612180	But she and thankfully it was kind of one of those things.
612180	613920	She realized she was at fault.
613920	615940	She didn't try to play any funny games.
615940	617500	She was very apologetic.
617500	619340	You know, I'm sorry that this happened.
619340	622300	And, you know, and I'm sorry you are inconvenienced.
622300	627740	But since I was riding this high from I get to get the covid shot tomorrow, I was like,
627740	629740	it's all these things happen.
629740	630740	Don't worry about it.
630740	633060	You know, like I must you didn't get her insurance.
633060	634060	Oh, no, I did.
634060	635060	Oh, no.
635060	636060	We took care of all that.
636060	637060	Yeah.
637060	638060	No.
638060	639060	Her insurance people called me yesterday.
639060	640060	No, no, no.
640060	642140	I just mean like as she was stressing out, I was just like, you know, it's don't stress
642140	643140	out.
643140	644140	It's OK.
644140	645140	You know, I'm fine.
645140	646140	None of us are injured.
646140	647260	That's the important part.
647260	650860	You know, and I'm like, honestly, I was she probably was thinking like, who the fuck is
650860	651860	this guy?
651860	653300	Why is he so nice?
653300	656580	But it's because I got like the best news ever that morning.
656580	660380	It's like if I if you're going to choose a day to hit my car, that was the day to do
660380	661380	it, honestly.
661380	663760	But yes, no, we got it was all good.
663760	667320	Her insurance people called me last night and they were like, yep, we're going to accept
667320	668680	full liability on this.
668680	670400	And they set me up at the car place tomorrow.
670400	671560	It is an inconvenience.
671560	677280	I'm not happy about it, but something about the whole like covid situation, everything
677280	682480	I think puts a lot of things in perspective where I'm like, OK, she made a mistake and
682480	686020	she hit my car like shit happens.
686020	690700	And honest, honestly, with things like that, it's more like it's done.
690700	691700	What can you do?
691700	693420	Yeah, I think it's that, too.
693420	696300	It's like, am I going to scream at her?
696300	698860	What literally what will that accomplish?
698860	700460	What's that going to accomplish?
700460	706180	Like I see I see a girl who's freaked out because she knows she caused this situation.
706180	709300	And you know, you know, when you're the one that causes causes that you're running through
709300	710300	your head.
710300	711300	Oh, my God.
711300	712300	Is this going to be a neck injury thing?
712300	714020	Is this guy going to sue me for everything I have and all this stuff?
714020	716300	You can tell she's going through like all that stress.
716300	718060	Like I can tell just by looking at her.
718060	720220	So her insurance is about to suck.
720220	722140	Well, yeah, that part.
722140	724780	And you know, she had one of those cars with paper plates.
724780	727780	So I know it was probably a new to her car.
727780	734740	So that that sucks, like, you know, but again, like, what is it going to help if I'm just
734740	736860	like screaming at her going, how could you?
736860	737860	My day is ruined.
737860	741900	I am a I am an I'm an inconvenienced middle aged man.
741900	745820	Like it's just like what's well, what's funny?
745820	751720	I was reading a Vice article that's been making the rounds about how people are basically
752300	753520	just being assholes lately.
753520	754520	Oh, yeah.
754520	761320	But a lot of it is having to do to, you know, carrying the stress of the political situation,
761320	763440	the pandemic situation, all of this.
763440	766400	And we're just grumpy in general.
766400	772640	And the fact that you would turn it around and actually try to make somebody else.
772640	777760	I guess, center centered a little bit better, you know, that's a good thing.
777760	781400	We need more people showing just those little acts of kindness every day.
782080	783080	And I want to be clear.
783080	786440	I'm not telling this story to brag about what a good person I am, because I'm going to be
786440	787440	completely honest.
787440	788440	Yeah.
788440	789440	No, no.
789440	790440	I'm going to be completely honest with you.
790440	794640	If I had not been if I had not been writing the high of the vaccine news, I don't think
794640	801640	I would have been rude, but I think there would have been a lot more of that.
801640	803680	You know, I think there would have been a lot more of that, right?
803680	807840	Like, I just don't think I probably wouldn't have been like I probably just would have
807840	809360	been a lot more like quiet.
809360	814180	I think is probably my more nature is just like, all right, what's your insurance mo?
814180	815520	You know, like that whole thing.
815520	816800	So yeah, I'm not telling that story.
816800	819760	If you see, you can all like, you know, gas me up and like, tell me what a great person
819760	820760	I am.
820760	821760	It's not about it.
821760	825480	But it definitely was something about the timing of everything like that, paired with
825480	829800	the great news of the vaccine stuff kind of just put a lot in perspective where it's like,
829800	830960	you know what?
830960	832680	I'm lucky to get this.
832680	834520	I'm unlucky to get this.
834520	836480	The universe works in weird ways.
837120	842680	Yeah, anyway, it is it is a podcast about video games, but I thought that was an interesting
842680	844840	life update y'all might enjoy.
844840	846100	And I did want to encourage you know what?
846100	847720	We have a platform.
847720	849320	It's a tiny platform.
849320	854080	It's like a little plank of wood that it's a it's a literal cardboard box that if somebody
854080	856360	too heavy stands on it, it will collapse.
856360	858660	But we do have a platform.
858660	862840	And if I can use this platform to encourage people, get the vaccine.
862840	863840	It's fine.
863840	864840	It's safe.
864840	866560	It's connected on lots of people.
866560	870320	There are lots of medical journals and medical science behind it.
870320	876760	So if you're like on the fence, like I'm not sure Bill Gates microchip, like, just please
876760	878600	do a little research into it.
878600	882160	And I think you're going to find it's it's fine.
882160	883160	It's fine.
883160	887320	Yes, there will be side effects, but they're they're 10 times better than actually getting
887320	888320	COVID.
888320	889320	I guarantee it.
889320	898480	Well, and now they're actually showing that people are getting long COVID in higher numbers,
898480	902240	which is basically you're over the virus, but you're left with the symptoms.
902240	903240	Right.
903240	904560	Well, Shane got into that a little bit last week.
904560	906200	You weren't you weren't here last week.
906200	907200	Was it last week or two?
907200	908200	I can't even.
908200	909200	It was last week.
909200	910200	What is time?
910200	911200	And he was talking a little bit.
911200	913680	We had him on at the beginning because I think there was Pokemon news or something.
913680	914880	I don't even know anymore.
914880	915880	What is time?
916360	919840	And but I know he was talking a little bit about that because he was wearing a mask on
919840	923640	stream even though he was in his house and it actually for him, it's helping with breathing
923640	924640	and all that.
924640	932000	So, you know, again, if you if you think COVID is fake, like I've literally had somebody
932000	939760	on this show to your way out of ever talking again, just or just like do a little research.
939760	941120	Go look somewhere.
941120	943880	It's not you're doing the research, Rob.
943880	946040	They saw it all on the Internet and it must be true.
946040	949760	Well, that's why I'm saying you need to do your research somewhere else, you know.
949760	950760	And anyway.
950760	953960	Well, even so, last week I was doing Gish.
953960	954960	So to.
954960	955960	All right.
955960	956960	Lizzo on the Grammys.
956960	957960	Bitch, I'm back.
957960	958960	Well, welcome back.
958960	959960	Welcome.
959960	960960	I love her.
960960	961960	It didn't.
961960	964980	But the nice thing is because you had the classic game of the week, we didn't totally
964980	965980	miss you.
965980	966980	You know what I mean?
966980	968400	Like, we still got a little bit of Jamie's.
968400	969580	No, you know, we love you.
969580	970580	We do.
970580	971580	We do.
971580	972580	Yeah.
972660	976580	Some folks in chat talking about Zanderouz and chat over twitch dot TV slash Vogue Network
976580	979780	says most of us already have the microchip anyway.
979780	980780	You got to.
980780	982620	I think the microchip thing has become a bit of a meme.
982620	986220	But I know there are a few people that believe it, but it's crazy to me that they will post
986220	991340	to Facebook about it and tweet about it from their device that literally tracks their location
991340	995520	everywhere they go smart as I hold up my Apple Watch.
995520	997340	It's just it's just ridiculous.
997340	998340	All right.
999100	1004180	Look, I promised gaming just because we're talking about microchips doesn't mean we're
1004180	1005580	in gaming news.
1005580	1007980	Let's actually talk about what's going on in gaming.
1007980	1011960	Loki, why don't you start us off with our kickoff topic tonight?
1011960	1017360	So Bethesda, of course, we know that they're purchasing or I'm sorry, Microsoft's purchasing
1017360	1018360	Bethesda.
1018360	1021280	I kind of was wondering where we were on that.
1021280	1028060	But apparently it was just down to the European Union's basically giving it the OK.
1028420	1034660	And now that that's been kind of allowed to happen, they've completed their purchase of
1034660	1035960	Bethesda.
1035960	1040220	So along with that, we had some more clarifications on things.
1040220	1046900	So, for example, as we kind of expected that some future Bethesda games will be exclusive
1046900	1048540	to Xbox and PC.
1048540	1053940	I mean, after all, you don't pay seven point five billion dollars to just have your games
1053940	1054940	everywhere.
1055700	1058540	But I mean, we'll see like what that means.
1058540	1063020	I think what they were talking about, though, it says with the addition of Bethesda teams,
1063020	1068220	gamers should know that Xbox consoles, PC and Game Pass will be the best place experience
1068220	1069780	to do Bethesda games.
1069780	1075220	Now, I'm wondering if they mean by games pass that they're looking to like, say, hey, look
1075220	1077060	at these games we have.
1077060	1078660	You know, you want to put them on your console.
1078660	1083140	Well, you can offer game pass kind of like how EA has EA play.
1083140	1085740	So that services on multiple consoles.
1085740	1087060	Why not game pass?
1087060	1090900	You know, so that may be something that they're trying to sweeten the pot there with that
1090900	1093940	to try to entice them to be able to bring it on.
1093940	1096900	But in the meantime, speaking of game pass, you know, if you are interested in playing
1096900	1099380	some Bethesda game, they added 20 more on there.
1099380	1101860	All all of your favorites are in there.
1101860	1107060	So well, Doom 2016 is missing, just to be clear.
1107060	1108420	So they're not not all there.
1108420	1110740	But yes, a good chunk made.
1110740	1114900	I don't want to poopoo the news because there are like I wasn't expecting Morrowind all
1114900	1116940	the way from classic Xbox to show up.
1116940	1120920	So there is some interesting picks that showed up in there.
1120920	1121920	Or Doom 64.
1121920	1124760	Who's really like dying to play Doom 64?
1124760	1125760	Fuck you.
1125760	1126760	I played it this week.
1126760	1128740	That was the first one I watched.
1128740	1130900	Why are you kidding?
1130900	1134440	Because because it actually looks pretty good.
1134440	1137360	Like it doesn't look like it because they up rezzed it or something.
1137360	1139540	They made the modern tweaks to it.
1139540	1143860	It looks good because you like I because of reasons.
1143860	1148900	I played it for like five minutes, you know, when I was in college or something and a friend
1148900	1153140	had Doom 64 and it was one of those I wanted to revisit it and see.
1153140	1155980	Like in my mind, I was like, was this like the original Doom?
1155980	1156980	Was it important?
1156980	1160020	And the nice thing about game pass, Loki, is that I can do that.
1160020	1162900	I can just like as long as, you know, I have the bandwidth or whatever.
1162900	1165180	But Doom 64 is a pretty small game.
1165180	1168620	So I just downloaded it just to be like, huh, I want to see I want to remember what this
1168620	1169620	is like.
1169620	1173180	I was and I, I played through the first level I and I enjoyed myself.
1173180	1175780	I didn't think it was terrible.
1175780	1180460	But you know, it's just it's in that same era of Doom one and Doom two.
1180460	1184580	And graphically, those games, you know, they're showing their age, but they're obviously there.
1184580	1189500	We wouldn't have the games we have today if it weren't for the legacy of those Doom games.
1189500	1193700	Anyway, sorry, I'm getting off track, but I had to justify to Loki why I was playing
1193700	1194700	Doom 64.
1194700	1195700	Fine.
1195700	1196700	I don't know.
1196780	1197780	I don't know.
1197780	1202620	Like it for me, it'd be like, hey, you like I know that Duke Nukem is not a Bethesda game,
1202620	1206780	but it'd be like, hey, you can play Duke Nukem 3D or you can play Duke Nukem 3D that appeared
1206780	1208660	on the Nintendo 64.
1208660	1210340	Not picking the Nintendo 64 version.
1210340	1212220	I'll take the original, please.
1212220	1217060	Well, remember the 60 Doom 64 has unique monsters, levels.
1217060	1218060	It's a different game.
1218060	1220620	It's not the same as when I guess I get that.
1220620	1221620	Yeah.
1221620	1222620	Yeah.
1222620	1223620	So I guess that makes sense.
1223620	1224620	And who cares?
1224620	1225620	It's free or free with your right.
1225620	1226620	Exactly.
1227540	1228540	It's quote free.
1228540	1230540	It's free like PlayStation Plus free games and all that.
1230540	1231540	Yeah, exactly.
1231540	1232540	Yeah.
1232540	1233540	All right.
1233540	1234540	So that's yeah.
1234540	1237860	It's kind of nice that we have the news that they have officially come together and how
1237860	1239500	fast that moved.
1239500	1244140	Like once that EU announcement came in, you know, we had the game pass additions within
1244140	1245860	probably 72 hours.
1245860	1248340	But I think it's also interesting that we had that.
1248340	1251260	I don't know what you'd call it, that interesting live stream.
1251260	1255820	I wouldn't call it a press event or what it was like a weird fireside chat where they
1255820	1260420	were talking about, you know, a lot of these things and talking about the exclusive, you
1260420	1266340	know, kind of confirming that there are going to be some games that will be exclusive to
1266340	1267800	Xbox and PC.
1267800	1272400	So what do you guys think about that exclusive side of things?
1272400	1277700	Do you think that is confirmation of sorts that things like Starfield and Elder Scrolls
1277700	1281700	6, like don't expect them on PlayStation or what do you think is going to happen with
1281700	1282700	that?
1282700	1286500	I think it's don't expect it on PlayStation immediately.
1286500	1288180	Okay.
1288180	1294400	I think that they're going to work out some bit of exclusivity because they can and then
1294400	1298940	open it up to everybody else because they're not going to say, oh, we don't want money.
1298940	1299940	Yeah.
1299940	1300940	You know?
1300940	1301940	Yeah.
1301940	1307620	And I could see and from my perspective, I could see Elder Scrolls 6 going to PlayStation.
1307620	1308980	I could see it.
1308980	1312860	But even if it does, it's not going to be the version that you want.
1312860	1313860	Like full stop.
1313860	1318780	Like the best version will be the Microsoft and Windows Store version or PC, whatever
1318780	1324260	trust that is going to be the version you want, even if it comes in less.
1324260	1326140	They somehow get it on the switch.
1326140	1330300	Maybe there's a switch pro or something and you must have handheld, but that's an exception.
1330300	1336700	I think for most people like the if Elder Scrolls 6 comes out on PlayStation, it's not
1336700	1340580	really going to matter for most people because the Xbox version will be the one you want.
1340580	1346260	I'm not so sure it's guaranteed something like Elder Scrolls 6 would come out on PlayStation.
1346260	1349260	I don't think anybody should really count on that.
1349260	1352500	I think you need to start setting yourself up mentally that you're going to have to get
1352500	1354420	an Xbox if you want to play Elder Scrolls 6.
1354420	1359300	I think Starfield absolutely is Xbox exclusive at this point.
1359300	1360700	I got nothing to go off of.
1360700	1365860	I got nothing but rumors and stuff and what they said during this event.
1365860	1368860	But I think something like that you better believe is going to be Xbox exclusive.
1368860	1373060	They had no reason to take that to PlayStation at this point.
1373060	1380420	But I do think that all being said, I do think there's going to be room for certain Bethesda
1380420	1385060	things to still show up on Nintendo Switch, certainly, because they seem to have a pretty
1385060	1386380	good partnership.
1386380	1389420	And Microsoft never really seems threatened by Nintendo.
1389420	1394700	You know, they've done things like Ori and the Blind Forest and Will of the Wisps, Minecraft,
1394700	1398300	of course, although that's its own circumstance, right?
1398300	1399940	But we've seen interesting...
1399940	1401620	A Cuphead would be another one.
1401620	1405480	We've seen interesting little partnerships between Nintendo and Microsoft.
1405480	1408060	And I think that will still also hold true with Bethesda.
1408060	1412220	I'm not necessarily thinking the Elder Scrolls 6s of the world, but how about the Fallout
1412220	1418820	shelters of the world and little things like that, I think would still be very likely for
1418820	1420520	the Switch.
1420520	1424540	So I don't think everything is going to be.
1424540	1425940	Loki, what about you?
1425940	1427420	Where's your head at on the exclusives?
1427420	1429420	What do you think is going to happen?
1429420	1433060	I think we'll see how it goes with just having one console.
1433060	1437020	I mean, I think it depends on where they think they're going to make their money.
1437020	1444100	If it's going to be a game that is primarily single player and kind of an RPG like an Elder
1444100	1448980	Scrolls type game, then I think that they will keep it to the exclusive platforms.
1448980	1452820	If it's something more of a live service game where they feel that they're going to make
1452820	1459340	more money and reoccurring income from monthly subscriptions or microtransactions, then they're
1459340	1461780	going to want it on as many platforms as possible.
1461780	1466700	So I think it's just going to determine the type of games that they have and where they
1466700	1470420	feel that they're going to be best fitting.
1470420	1472560	Interesting conversation happening in chat.
1472560	1477100	And I think it might have started with this comment here where Phoenix7726 said, how long
1477100	1480140	before Sony or Nintendo take Ubisoft?
1480140	1486960	And then S2100matt followed that up with Sony would be smart to target Konami.
1486960	1488780	And there's some other follow ups to that.
1488780	1493260	And it's interesting, this conversation about Microsoft and Bethesda is sort of starting
1493260	1496340	this who's next type of trend.
1496340	1498300	Is Sony going to get Konami or something like that?
1498300	1502900	Now it's pointed out, I think Bobby Blackwell said, Konami is no longer a console video
1502900	1505860	game company and everyone's still in denial about it.
1505860	1507000	Very true.
1507000	1511480	But I think there's something to be said about, you know, the case set, you know, being pretty
1511480	1513320	much long gone.
1513320	1520320	And could maybe Konami's intellectual properties still be, you know, maybe if the whole company
1520320	1525000	isn't bought, could their intellectual property be bought for console usage?
1525000	1528400	And of course, I hate to bring it up because this rumor won't fucking die.
1528400	1532480	But there's the whole Sony and Konami are in cahoots on a new Silent Hill.
1532480	1535840	I give us a screenshot or something.
1535840	1537480	I don't know.
1537480	1541280	But I do like honestly, that would be a dream.
1541280	1547960	If Sony were to acquire things like Castlevania as an IP, Silent Hill as an IP, Suikoden as
1547960	1548960	an IP.
1548960	1552440	Can you can you imagine if Sony brought back Suikoden?
1552440	1557120	Like that's hot, like somebody needs to get all the Konami IPs and do something with them,
1557120	1559380	at least in the home entertainment.
1559780	1565220	What could also be very interesting, where would it if somebody were to buy and I realize
1565220	1569900	I'm going on a tangent, but forgive me, because our show is rooted in a lot of Konami's culture
1569900	1572260	when it comes to music games.
1572260	1577100	Could you imagine if a company acquired the ability to make Bimani game home versions
1577100	1580100	that would actually do something with it?
1580100	1585380	And like Sony could I see Sony as a company where if they actually acquired the ability
1585380	1590540	to make Bimani home games, they might actually fucking do something with it.
1590540	1593460	And it could be very exciting, actually.
1593460	1597500	But I realize things like Bimani get really weird because Konami still has an interest
1597500	1598940	in the arcade stuff.
1598940	1604000	Konami still has their stuff they're doing on the PC with, you know, they're they're
1604000	1608100	like pop music online and they're 2DX Infinitas and all that stuff.
1608100	1613420	So I think Bimani in particular is in a really weird gray area when we come to talk about
1613420	1614940	acquiring stuff.
1614940	1620060	But I see these great IPs that are really going nowhere as of late.
1620060	1625040	And I would like Sony or somebody to buy them, quite frankly, at least the intellectual property.
1625040	1626940	But I get the contracts can be weird.
1626940	1632080	And Konami has not been a very well run company for quite a long time at this point.
1632080	1635620	So I'm not sure they're going to sell just because we want them to.
1635620	1636620	It's weird.
1636620	1637620	Yeah.
1637620	1643180	Konami also, they have to deal with probably a big difference in business model for Japanese
1643180	1647260	origin companies versus European.
1647260	1648260	It could be very true.
1648260	1655140	And also, I mean, different rules of acquisition for for, you know, Asian countries versus
1655140	1656220	European countries.
1656220	1662460	So it might not even be worth it, especially since they've especially for Konami since
1662460	1669060	they've become a little bit more niche with their bigger focus on the Pachi slot, you
1669060	1670060	know.
1670060	1671060	Yeah.
1671060	1672060	Or just slots in general.
1672060	1676600	And remember, walk into any casino and look at look at the look on the corner of the marquees
1676600	1678220	for the different slot machines.
1678220	1679940	About half of them are going to say Konami.
1679940	1683660	And they're not they're not things like Castlevania slots.
1683660	1688440	They're like, like, I don't think kitty glitter is by them, but I'm sure they have their own
1688440	1690220	type of kitten slot machine.
1690220	1695700	And there's I think that slot fortune cookie is Konami.
1695700	1700500	There's a lot of like, Konami has a lot of slot machines with things you wouldn't even
1700500	1701500	think were Konami.
1701940	1702940	Yeah.
1702940	1703940	Anyway.
1703940	1704940	Okay.
1704940	1707140	I completely took like the exit.
1707140	1712300	I'm like that meme of the car who's like, oh, L.R. staying focused on the news tangent.
1712300	1718940	And I just went down to let me go back to the news about Bethesda and Konami.
1718940	1723180	Let's talk about what this does for Game Pass, because I think I think another reason why
1723180	1727500	our chat room has this reaction of who's going to be next is because I think we're all looking
1727500	1728740	at this going.
1728780	1732020	Is anybody going to compete with Game Pass?
1732020	1736020	Because right now, it seems like nobody's trying.
1736020	1740300	Google Stadia sure didn't, because they went with a completely different model, right?
1740300	1743700	Like who is actually trying to compete with Game Pass?
1743700	1748300	I guess you could say EA Play, but look what happened there.
1748300	1749300	No, not even.
1749300	1755700	Well, EA Play, yeah, that's part of Game Pass now, but at least the trial version is.
1755740	1760700	I don't know if anybody's really doing, you know, like a competitor for Game Pass.
1760700	1765340	I could see Sony altering PlayStation now to try to make it like that.
1765340	1767220	I don't know if they have downloadable games yet.
1767220	1768820	That really is the thing that they need.
1768820	1770620	The streaming stuff.
1770620	1777740	It once again, it's a nice idea to have that you can stream any title, but the bandwidth,
1777740	1783660	man, it just in this day and age, that's not something that we need to be more manageable
1783660	1786980	and downloading something, it's going to be a lot more manageable that way.
1786980	1789620	And I do want to address some of the stuff in chat because they're echoing some of what
1789620	1790620	you're saying here.
1790620	1794220	SJ100Matt says Sony is trying, PlayStation Plus will get there.
1794220	1796420	Tiger Claw says Nintendo isn't even trying either.
1796420	1801060	I mean, I guess you could say technically they do have their, you know, classic game
1801060	1803820	library if you want to give them, you know, a point for that.
1803820	1807060	Have they added anything to that in like, ever?
1807060	1808700	I mean, like, I don't know.
1808700	1811740	Yeah, last month we had the news about like fire and ice.
1811740	1815260	I mean, we're getting, you know, I think all the Donkey Kong Country games have now
1815260	1816260	shown up now.
1816260	1819860	It's slim pickings, but they are adding to it.
1819860	1822700	I mean, technically, Logie, the answer to your question is yes, they are adding to it.
1822700	1826400	It's just not at the pace you or I or anybody else would really like now.
1826400	1827400	But here's the thing.
1827400	1830440	When you guys talk about the PlayStation, Nintendo, that's actually kind of my point
1830440	1834980	is that those what's happening here with Microsoft and Bethesda and this whole news and their
1834980	1840960	real like laser focus on Game Pass, they are fucking about to lap the other guys in how
1841000	1845040	far along they are in becoming the Netflix of gaming.
1845040	1850560	Now, of course, Netflix at one point had lapped everybody as well.
1850560	1852400	And then some of the big boys really did.
1852400	1854720	Then Disney Plus decided to show up.
1854720	1858760	Then they decided to put a really fucking good Marvel show on it and so on.
1858760	1863560	Like, you know, things like Disney Plus and even to some extent Paramount Plus, certainly
1863560	1865800	Hulu, are starting to catch up to Netflix.
1865800	1866800	Apple TV is doing it well too.
1866800	1867800	Oh, yes.
1867800	1870920	And of course, there's Apple TV and there's lots of stuff.
1870920	1876280	But my point is, how many years did Netflix go unchecked?
1876280	1881300	And that's what I see happening here with Game Pass and Microsoft is that they're just
1881300	1886400	able to etch out such a huge lead in this.
1886400	1889320	You know, I mean, it's it's interesting.
1889320	1893100	And you know, Bobby says Xbox is no longer in the console war.
1893100	1894880	They're in the ecosystem war.
1894880	1896840	Sony is still trying to win the console war.
1896840	1899280	And Microsoft doesn't really care about the console.
1899280	1902680	And I think this is a huge mistake on Sony's part.
1902680	1905160	I really do.
1905160	1910100	I think they need to get serious about responding to Game Pass if they want to have that longevity.
1910100	1915980	Because I think this news about Bethesda and everything with Game Pass, there isn't even
1915980	1918560	lines to read between.
1918560	1922880	Like in sometimes with these stories in the past, a year ago, I've had to say read between
1922880	1923900	the lines.
1923900	1925700	This is a Game Pass thing.
1925700	1930100	Why did Microsoft have that E3 where they announced that they were acquiring seven studios
1930100	1931580	that read between the lines?
1931580	1932580	It's a Game Pass thing.
1932580	1934740	You don't even have to read between the lines anymore.
1934740	1939100	They said it's a Game Pass thing.
1939100	1942000	So you can tell where Microsoft's interests are.
1942000	1945420	It was not about bringing the games to Xbox Series X.
1945420	1948140	It was not about bringing the games to Xbox One.
1948140	1951120	It was about bringing the games to Game Pass.
1951120	1953540	So did I just set off my phone?
1953540	1956420	I think I did.
1956420	1957420	Leave me alone.
1957420	1958420	All right.
1958420	1960780	I think it was my watch, actually.
1960780	1961780	All right.
1961780	1965780	Anyway, any other thoughts on the Bethesda Xbox thing?
1965780	1966780	All right.
1966780	1967780	Not really.
1967780	1968780	All right.
1968780	1973140	Then let's move on and we'll talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games
1973140	1974920	that we have been playing this week.
1974920	1976780	So Dark Soccer, let's start with you.
1976780	1978780	How was your gaming week?
1978780	1980620	Animal Crossing.
1980620	1981620	It's a good choice.
1981620	1982620	And Wordscape.
1982620	1989020	Wordscape is like how I wake up my brain in the morning and now I'm actually timing myself
1989020	1996040	to see how quickly I can finish an entire series, like the 16 puzzles.
1996040	2000380	And so far, my fastest has been within like four and a half minutes.
2000380	2001380	Wow.
2001380	2005060	So now that I'm bored with that, now I'm actually seeing how many different words I can figure
2005060	2006060	out.
2006060	2009940	And right now, my max is 16 extra words.
2009940	2011300	Nice.
2011300	2016940	So it's really just been that and not that it's a game, but it's kind of a contest because
2016940	2019240	it had achievements.
2019240	2020540	I like Duolingo.
2020540	2023340	I'm relearning Japanese.
2023340	2028600	And I had a challenge to be number one in the Diamond League, which is like the top
2028600	2031300	league and number one's pretty hard to get.
2031300	2033500	You got to stay on top of it.
2033500	2041100	And I think I earned something like 900 XP doing this, but I made number one in Diamond
2041100	2042780	League.
2042780	2047660	So now I can go back to half-assing it.
2047660	2056380	So that's really all, although I'm pretty much considering making myself a Japanese
2056380	2062880	account to play Animal Crossing so that I can maybe use that again to sort of teach
2062880	2063880	myself.
2063880	2066580	Oh, that's a cute idea.
2066580	2079380	I was doing that with the original, not the N64 one, but the GameCube double tsunami plus.
2079380	2081580	And it was pretty difficult at the time.
2081580	2086360	Now I think I read a lot better, so I might have an easier time of it, but we'll see.
2086360	2091620	It's interesting because Shane has talked to me about how he plays Final Fantasy XIV
2091620	2094920	in Japanese because he's also studying Japanese right now.
2094920	2097120	And so that is something to kind of help him learn.
2097120	2101780	So that's a very interesting like trick or technique, I guess, to helping immerse yourself
2101780	2105820	in a language is take one of your favorite video games, you know, and play it again,
2105820	2110740	but in Japanese or continue to play it in Japanese is a little way to kind of practice.
2110740	2111740	It's interesting.
2111740	2120140	And I did order some stickers, but they never arrived, but I got the idea from when Extrofer
2120140	2121620	was learning Russian.
2122320	2124840	Oh, and he had all those postcards all over the house?
2124840	2125840	Exactly.
2125840	2131640	So I was ordering stickers to put on things, and I might just have to make my own, like
2131640	2136460	get some like Avery labels or something, which shouldn't be too difficult to do.
2136460	2142540	But I also have another thing coming on tomorrow should be here.
2142540	2143540	And that's Mac Mini.
2143540	2144540	Oh, yeah.
2145460	2153300	I'm getting the Mac Mini M1, mostly for, you know, using Final Cut and Logic.
2153300	2161320	But I'm looking forward to seeing what I've been hearing about how well it plays some
2161320	2166840	of the games, because it's supposed to have just like this kickass graphics acceleration.
2166840	2173100	So and I have a bunch of games in my Steam that are Mac compatible, and I have a few
2173160	2177360	others that I had, you know, from the App Store, like, you know, Borderlands.
2177360	2183960	So I'm going to try to get my streaming setup done and do a little bit of Mac streaming.
2183960	2184960	So I see.
2184960	2185960	All right.
2185960	2186960	Excellent.
2186960	2191020	I'm looking forward to reporting on it, but that's why I brought it up, because it will
2191020	2192320	I'll be gaming on it.
2192320	2196520	Although I hate that I'd have to buy Final Fantasy 14 completely over if I wanted to
2196520	2197520	play it.
2197520	2198520	Oh, yeah.
2198520	2199520	Kind of lame.
2199520	2200520	At least I have my account.
2200520	2201520	We'll see.
2201940	2204220	Does any of the arcade stuff extend to Mac Mini or is that only?
2204220	2205220	Yes, it does.
2205220	2206220	Oh, cool.
2206220	2208020	You should check out that Fantasian.
2208020	2210500	I really want to see more about that.
2210500	2211500	I'll look into it.
2211500	2217320	I mean, I like I, you know, when I sold my iMac, I'm actually probably selling my MacBook
2217320	2221460	Pro because I use my iPad all the time.
2221460	2227940	But I was, you know, playing patterned because, you know, I love patterned and I actually
2227940	2231500	fully beat everything out on patterned right now.
2231500	2237060	But I would play patterned on my iPad and on a Mac.
2237060	2239480	So arcade goes through.
2239480	2240480	Cool.
2240480	2241480	Play what?
2241480	2242480	The golf every so often.
2242480	2243480	Good to know.
2243480	2244480	Yeah.
2244480	2245480	All right.
2245480	2246480	Well, let's check it.
2246480	2249920	Actually, a quick listener comment on the last segment before I go to Loki's gaming
2249920	2250920	week.
2250920	2255440	Bonds 006 in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network said Microsoft all you can eat model
2255440	2257340	is great for those that want it.
2257340	2262120	Bad times ahead winner if paywall for games become the only way to play games.
2262120	2263120	I don't think it will.
2263120	2267180	I mean, you're always going to have to pay for well, not true, I guess, because there
2267180	2271160	are things like Fortnite and the free to play model will always exist.
2271160	2273680	But that also is going to exist out of any of those ecosystems.
2273680	2279200	But you know, even if you drop $60 or some $70, I guess for a new game, that is a paywall
2279200	2280200	of sorts.
2280200	2285440	But I think I do see your point that like, you know, what if I want to just own this
2285440	2286440	game?
2286540	2288380	What if I want the streaming service to play this game?
2288380	2293300	I don't see that going away, especially with how integrated the digital storefronts are.
2293300	2297860	I think there's always going to be ways to buy a game that you really want without needing
2297860	2302940	any of these, you know, game pass or any of these service PS now, whatever you don't need
2302940	2303940	any of it.
2303940	2308620	Again, I always kind of look at this comparison to the movie industry.
2308620	2312140	And I think, you know, you obviously a lot of Hollywood has gone to streaming services.
2312140	2313460	But you know what?
2313460	2314460	You can still get Blu rays.
2314840	2317600	You can probably even still get DVDs.
2317600	2322680	It's not quite as plentiful as it was pre Netflix, but it's out there.
2322680	2325100	And hell online, you can get almost anything.
2325100	2328640	So there's a movie you really want and you don't, you know, because movies come and go
2328640	2331560	from the different streaming services too, which is really irritating.
2331560	2337480	So like my favorite movie, Clue, I know it's on Pluto TV, and I think it's on the new Paramount
2337480	2338480	Plus.
2338480	2339480	But you know what?
2339480	2343100	I own it on Blu ray just because I want to own it.
2343120	2346120	And I don't want to have to chase it around different streaming services.
2346120	2349080	And so I think there's I think that would be the case for games as well.
2349080	2351960	I don't I don't see that for a few movies.
2351960	2355760	Yeah, especially when it comes to Nintendo, if Nintendo is still going to always remain
2355760	2357880	a portable system.
2357880	2359160	We're not at the level yet.
2359160	2364280	And certainly Nintendo is not at the level yet where like, they're going to stream 5G
2364280	2370080	games to the switch, maybe 10, 15 years, we might have a different conversation on that.
2370080	2372860	This show will probably still be going.
2372860	2378300	But right now, no, I there were a long, long way out from that, for sure.
2378300	2379300	Anyway.
2379300	2380300	Okay, I just want to comment on that.
2380300	2381500	I did think it was a good comment.
2381500	2385300	But I think if you again, you look to Hollywood, I think you see a lot of where games is going
2385300	2387940	games is just lagging 510 years behind.
2387940	2388940	All right.
2388940	2391700	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2391700	2392940	I didn't play a ton.
2392940	2395020	I did play a lot of Minecraft.
2395020	2401080	And then of course, I had picked up a what's it called?
2401080	2409080	It's a ABS retro HD I think systems a while back, it's basically like an HD Nintendo and
2409080	2410460	Famicom.
2410460	2414440	And so I've been just picking up a few Nintendo games here and there.
2414440	2419640	So I got this week as a blaster master bionic commando, and of course, the guardian legend
2419640	2423760	and then also rampage because it came with the guardian legend.
2423760	2427720	Did you go to the retro store downtown or the one in Fair Oaks?
2427720	2428720	The one in Fair Oaks.
2428720	2429720	Okay.
2429720	2430720	Because I didn't want to go all the way downtown.
2430720	2431720	That's a cool place too.
2431720	2432720	Like I'm not going to.
2432720	2433720	We may as well give Fair Game a shout out.
2433720	2436380	They're a local business and they're pretty fair.
2436380	2437380	Yeah.
2437380	2438380	Yeah.
2438380	2439380	The prices were definitely good.
2439380	2444620	I could have bought a whole lot more and I sought myself, but they have a lot of stuff
2444620	2445620	there.
2445620	2449640	They even carry some homebrew NES games and reprints.
2449640	2456360	So like I didn't realize, but they have a NES multi-cart for a bunch of data East games.
2456360	2459760	That's actually officially endorsed by data East and stuff.
2459760	2461040	So I thought that was kind of interesting.
2461040	2462040	Hold up, hold up, hold up.
2462040	2465640	Does this mean you might sell your game at retail?
2465640	2466680	It would be cool if I could.
2466680	2471280	I didn't ask him, but like I saw that they had, um, they had, what was it?
2471280	2475160	It's um, I think it's like hollow Halloween or something like that.
2475160	2482600	Um, 85, there's some, some Halloween game, um, that they have, that's, uh, pretty well
2482600	2487000	known and they have the box copy of it there for like 60 bucks.
2487000	2491320	So a haunted Halloween 85, that's what it was.
2491320	2498640	And um, so I saw that I was actually looking to see if they had any like other, you know,
2498640	2500000	indie games there.
2500000	2505480	Um, I think there's a few things, but like a lot, not so much on the NES and like some
2505480	2509880	of the other stuff I was looking for, they didn't really have, but I mean, it's certainly
2509880	2516680	well organized compared to, I like the previous week I had gone to the local flea market here
2516680	2523280	and there's a guy that has a retro game store with games that are in far less good shape
2523280	2526520	and it's just, there's no organization to it at all.
2526520	2531500	It's like a bunch of NES carts and good luck, find what you're looking for because none
2531500	2532500	of it's organized in.
2532500	2533500	It's just a big pile mess.
2533500	2535740	Not Crater Dan back, is it?
2535740	2541760	It's uh, retro, it's like Dave's, it's, it's on the, he's, he's talking about the Folsom
2541760	2543760	Boulevard one, not Denios.
2543760	2547160	Oh, I don't think I've been there.
2547160	2548160	Yeah.
2548160	2553880	So his store is a bit, uh, trap, I mean, it, it represents the, the flea market as a whole.
2553880	2558960	I mean, the whole flea market's kind of a dump, but that whole thing, not to like give
2558960	2563600	away my address, but that whole thing is within like maybe two miles of my house and I'll
2563600	2566080	still take the 20 minute drive to go to Denios.
2566080	2571880	I would have, I should have gone to Denios, but like, I just wanted to real quickly check
2571880	2572880	it out.
2572880	2578280	Cause I saw when I was looking for like NES games on, um, not like the Facebook marketplace
2578280	2583800	and like on Craigslist or something like that, I saw an ad for it and it looked, you know,
2583800	2584800	better.
2584800	2586400	They also have like amiibos and stuff like that.
2586400	2590920	Um, so I wanted to go in there and see what they had, but Oh my God, it was a mess.
2590920	2595040	Like I could, I could literally not find anything that I was looking for in there.
2595040	2597400	Like I could have asked them, they would have been like, I don't know.
2597400	2602240	And the way they have their counter set up, like if there's stuff on the counter and like
2602240	2605600	the way the games are stacked up in there, you can't even see what's in there.
2605600	2606800	It's just, it's a mess.
2606800	2611760	And just looking at the labels, uh, from where they had it on there, it just looked trash.
2611760	2614720	Just like dumpster diving for $5 DVDs at Walmart, right?
2614720	2615720	Yeah.
2615720	2619840	Pretty much like, except if the DVDs were like scraped off of the street, you know,
2619840	2624280	because they'd been thrown away before, um, whereas at least the stuff that was at fair
2624280	2629560	game, if the pricing wasn't bad, it was like 10 bucks a game.
2629560	2633160	And depending on what you're looking for, obviously like Zelda was like 30 or $40.
2633160	2635680	I'm like, I don't really want for that much.
2635680	2639320	Um, but yeah, it's just, it's so much better.
2639320	2642360	Just not a nightmare to find stuff.
2642360	2647400	Um, so yeah, eventually I'll go back out to the, it's been a while since I've been out
2647400	2652280	there, but like, I just want to do like a really quick trip to see what they had and
2652280	2653280	that was it.
2653280	2656640	So, um, you know, I'll probably go back to fair game at some point, you know, I don't
2656640	2661740	want to get a huge collection of stuff cause I don't have any place to put it.
2661740	2662740	So I don't know.
2662740	2663740	We'll see.
2663740	2664740	All right.
2664740	2666160	Um, well I'll talk about my gaming week.
2666160	2670200	So as I mentioned earlier, when Loki was talking about Bethesda, I did play doom 64
2670200	2671320	this week a little bit.
2671320	2672320	That's fun.
2672320	2676280	Um, and also I used the whole, uh, game pass expansion, Bethesda.
2676280	2681640	I picked up elder scrolls, oblivion, the Xbox three 61, because I was like, I just want
2681640	2682640	to check it out.
2682640	2689280	And I have to say, holy shit, the loading times are crazy good because of the whole
2689280	2693540	fact like series X, you know, is on the, the, um, solid state drive and all that stuff and
2693540	2695040	boast the faster loading times.
2695040	2700280	I gotta say now that I'm playing oblivion, uh, it's, you notice it and it looks really
2700280	2701280	sharp.
2701280	2705760	You know, it's, it's still a years old game at this point from what, like 2006.
2705760	2711880	But um, it's, it holds up pretty well thanks to, I'm not sure how many of those enhancements
2711880	2716520	like the HDR and the frame skip stuff or the frame speed up stuff they've actually put
2716520	2717840	into this yet.
2717840	2719760	I think some of that is still coming.
2719760	2721560	Um, but it looks good.
2721560	2723520	Um, and so I enjoyed it well enough.
2723520	2726880	You know, I'm not going to spend a lot of time on it, but, uh, I had a good time.
2726880	2729440	It's kind of like going down memory lane, I guess.
2729440	2731540	So, um, so I played a little bit of that.
2731540	2735800	I'm still playing dead by daylight, thanks to husband and his streams.
2735800	2740700	Um, I actually finally got to the point I spent money on it.
2740700	2745140	I bought a new killer because I had to be able to play the game as pyramid head.
2745140	2749760	So I bought pyramid head and day by daylight and I gotta say he's fucking fun.
2749760	2751280	He's really fun to play.
2751280	2756040	And you know, it's funny cause everybody tells me pyramid heads a little more advanced.
2756040	2759360	I don't know if you want to, you know, even Alan is kind of like, he's a little bit harder
2759360	2760360	to play.
2760360	2761360	I don't know.
2761360	2762880	And I'm like, I want to play this game as pyramid head.
2762880	2764560	I will learn.
2764560	2770100	And so it's pretty cool cause he digs trenches that, um, the survivors, if they touch them,
2770100	2771440	they become tormented.
2771440	2772440	And this is really cool.
2772440	2776000	If they're tormented, then when you down them, instead of putting them on a hook, you can
2776000	2777600	send them to a cage.
2777600	2781120	So they go to a, like a barbed wire cage type of thing they have to escape from.
2781120	2782600	And so that feels really good.
2782600	2785880	Um, so I've, I've caged a few survivors and that's a lot of fun.
2785880	2790420	So pyramid head is, is now my main in dead by daylight, at least for now until I get
2790420	2792920	suckered into, uh, buying another killer.
2792920	2793920	We'll see.
2793920	2795440	But that's all, again, that's all thanks to Alan.
2795440	2800500	I would, I wouldn't have given that game really another look, but he really did some streaming.
2800500	2801500	I'll give him a cheap plug.
2801500	2802960	Twitch TV slash Alan alchemy.
2802960	2804760	I think he's streaming after tonight.
2804760	2806380	So well are, I think he wanted to do that.
2806380	2809800	So you might actually get to see him if you hang out until the end of the show.
2809800	2813560	Um, but, um, he was really good at explaining all the mechanics.
2813560	2814560	And I will say this.
2814560	2819920	I played my first survivor game in dead by daylight, which I, you know, was kind of like
2819920	2822800	on the fence, like, uh, but having played enough, I was like, all right, I should get
2822800	2824240	in there and played survivor.
2824240	2825960	I did not enjoy playing survivor.
2825960	2827160	It was too stressful.
2827160	2829080	I hate that heartbeat shit.
2829080	2832320	Like when the killer's getting closer, the heartbeat gets into, and so my own heartbeat
2832320	2834120	is like, what the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck?
2834120	2836960	And then like, I was just playing like a dummy.
2836960	2841320	Like I thought I was running away from the killer and the killer literally cornered me.
2841320	2845280	So because a lot of people that play that game are kind of dicks, like the killer is
2845280	2847760	like standing there right in front of me blocking.
2847760	2849000	So I can't go anywhere.
2849000	2853080	And so of course he starts doing the whole nanny, nanny, nanny, teabag TV, nanny, nanny,
2853080	2855060	nanny, like, ah, you can't do anything.
2855060	2856060	And then kills me.
2856060	2857560	I'm like, you fucking dick.
2857560	2860360	So I did not enjoy survivor experience.
2860360	2861960	I don't think I'm going to do that again.
2861960	2866480	Like, ah, I am a murderer at heart.
2866480	2869360	That is, that is how I'm going to stick to it.
2869360	2871680	All right.
2871680	2877280	Um, I'm looking in chat, SSJ100Matt says, so Rob and Alan co-stream when?
2877280	2878320	Okay.
2878320	2879320	Do not quote me on this.
2879320	2880800	Do not like write.
2880800	2882320	This is not science seal delivered.
2882320	2884340	However, we are talking about.
2884340	2889560	So I mentioned after Bobby does his, um, reward stream here at VOG network, he's going to
2889560	2892280	do the VHS tapes, memory lane stream.
2892280	2894280	You already got the points raised for that.
2894280	2896300	That is going to happen in the next couple of weeks.
2896300	2901200	So once that's done, we already talked about the next stream is going to be, um, the Shane's
2901200	2902840	definitive Pokemon rankings.
2902840	2903960	We talked about that last week.
2903960	2907800	So Shane is going to get out of spreadsheets, walk you through his spreadsheets of how he
2907800	2909140	ranks Pokemon.
2909140	2911580	And I think we said we were going to do the top 50 Poke.
2911580	2914740	If we do all 800, it's going to be a 48 hour stream.
2914740	2917400	So I think we said, we're going to do like the top 50 Pokemon is going to do his definitive
2917400	2918400	ranking.
2918400	2924860	The next stream after that, I am looking at doing a Rob Roberts, murders, his husband
2924860	2928660	stream, um, in dead by daylight.
2928660	2933020	So it'll be Rob Roberts murders, his husband in dead by daylight, but we're going to need
2933020	2937980	to find three other survivors who Rob Roberts will also be murdering.
2937980	2943660	Um, and if you're playing in that, if that's okay, if you're new to dead by daylight, that's,
2943660	2944660	it can be listeners.
2944660	2946380	It could be other friends of the show, whatever.
2946380	2950560	If you're new to dead by daylight, that's okay because Alan will be coaching the team
2950560	2951880	of survivors.
2951880	2954840	So it will be a, and I fucking suck as a killer.
2954840	2960420	So like, you know, if you're going to want to learn, this will be the stream to do it.
2960420	2963720	I have to confirm and make sure Alan's all good with that.
2963720	2967020	That is what we're looking at for the third bonus stream that will come a little later
2967020	2968020	on.
2968020	2969800	So, all right.
2969800	2977300	Speaking in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, uh, sweet Nick, sweet Nika.
2977300	2978300	I hope I said that right.
2978300	2979300	I'm sorry.
2979300	2980300	Nika.
2980300	2981300	Sorry about that.
2981300	2985160	Uh, says I play survivor more than killer, but being killer is a great stress relief
2985160	2986160	at dead by daylight.
2986160	2987160	LOL.
2987160	2991260	Um, I am taking comfort in the fact that Alan is a pretty good survivor, but when he plays
2991260	2993320	killer, he's about as good as I am.
2993320	2996880	So I don't feel like I'm lagging behind or anything like that, which is nice.
2996960	3001360	Um, as soon under Matt says, got to have Shane's not top 10 Pokemon though.
3001360	3002360	Ha ha ha.
3002360	3005800	Uh, and DJ Romas says we need a Rob Roberts presents among us.
3005800	3006800	Yeah.
3006800	3010240	I know that's still a desire to, that may end up being the third thing.
3010240	3013800	So that's why I said, don't quote me on it, but we'll, uh, we'll, we'll get on that.
3013800	3014800	So, okay.
3014800	3018640	So see dark soccer, you don't have to worry pixel Pacas already volunteering to get murdered
3018640	3019640	by me.
3019640	3020640	So there we go.
3020640	3023440	We're we'll get, we'll get Alan's team together in no time.
3023440	3024440	All right.
3024440	3025440	All right.
3025440	3027760	Uh, what else do I want to say about my gaming week?
3027760	3029280	Oh, I still have one more.
3029280	3034200	I bought bravely default two, uh, on Nintendo switch and, uh, I haven't played a lot of
3034200	3035200	it yet.
3035200	3040160	I've only gone through, uh, that like very first boss fight where the team is still teaching
3040160	3041520	you about boss fights.
3041520	3047960	So I, I'm, I'm still very early into the game, but so far I am enjoying the actual game itself.
3047960	3051960	The whole like job leveling, the, the battle system is very interesting where the whole
3051960	3056200	like you kind of like stock up your turns, or if you're feeling very cocky or confident
3056200	3060140	that you can finish the battle and in four turns, you just spend all your points and
3060140	3061840	try to knock everything out.
3061840	3063960	Um, there is a Bobby black Wolf mode.
3063960	3067000	You can play on easy, uh, but I am playing on normal.
3067000	3071940	Um, so I am enjoying it and, um, the story, you know, it's still early on, but it seems
3071940	3075520	like it could go, the voice acting gets a little old, but I skipped most of it.
3075520	3079520	Um, but the story so far seems like it could be interesting, very, very old school final
3079520	3083120	fantasy so far anyway, again, I'm very early on in it.
3083120	3088360	The one thing I am going to haze the game for a little bit though, um, it doesn't run
3088360	3089360	great.
3089360	3093940	Um, and that is kind of shocking for a game that's exclusive to switch to see things like
3093940	3101400	frame skips and hiccups and like stuff that really shows how the switch is lagging behind
3101400	3102640	other systems.
3102640	3108720	Now maybe this is all when the switch pro comes out, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, bravely
3108720	3113120	default two will run like butter on it, but I can't, I can't evaluate a system that ain't
3113120	3116640	out or even announced yet as it is today.
3116640	3120040	It's a little disappointing how kind of clunky it feels.
3120040	3126820	Um, and uh, I gotta say, I think bravely default is really a game that's meant to be played
3126820	3128720	in portable mode.
3128720	3135040	I play it on the TV and when I do play it on the TV, I can see a lot of pixelization
3135040	3141800	and like things that aren't very appealing when I'm in things like towns and stuff.
3141800	3146400	And I'm not sure if that's supposed to be kind of intentionally the art style, um, which
3146400	3150160	some of the fans may try to say, and that's fine, everybody can have their own opinion.
3150160	3151600	I say it doesn't work.
3151600	3153700	Um, and it, it looks, it looks old.
3153700	3155280	It looks, uh, yeah.
3155280	3162880	So some of those things are kind of annoying, um, but the game itself, the game mechanics
3162880	3167960	and that whole thing are kind of strong enough for me to overlook that other stuff.
3167960	3173080	I just hope there is a switch pro in the future that will not cause the game to like, you
3173080	3177720	know, like literally stutter as I'm out in the overworld.
3177720	3181400	It's it's kind of depressing that the game does that, honestly.
3181400	3182400	All right.
3182400	3184280	Um, let's move on.
3184280	3185280	That's it for my gaming week.
3185280	3186560	So I think that's all I have to say.
3186560	3188940	Uh, I guess we'll get into some news, shall we?
3188940	3191600	So Loki, why don't you start us off?
3191600	3192640	All right.
3192640	3200880	So, uh, you know, stonks, um, Roblox, the Roblox thing or Roblox corporation, I should
3200880	3203320	say, uh, went public this week.
3203320	3212120	I believe that was on the 10th and they had originally set out that their stock price
3212120	3218160	was around, I think they were estimating $45 was originally what it was, uh, set the trade
3218160	3222560	at, but then actually ended up trading around $70 at the end of the day.
3222560	3226460	Um, so right now, though, they've, uh, raised quite a bit of money.
3226460	3235440	So it's, you know, basically a valuation of about $45 billion, uh, which is huge because
3235440	3240960	when you compare that to other companies like EA, for example, which is 37 billion or take
3240960	3248260	two, which is 19 billion, um, that is quite a bit more, uh, considering, you know, it
3248260	3250040	is a huge platform.
3250040	3255560	I honestly think that this company is going to get, uh, too big for itself, uh, especially
3255560	3262940	considering that like the rampant piracy of IP on the platform is going to, it's going
3262940	3264480	to run into problems with that.
3264480	3269300	I can see that at some point soon, um, wait, could you, could you do me a favor because
3269300	3270360	you have kids?
3270360	3271360	I don't have kids.
3271360	3272360	Star soccer doesn't have kids.
3272360	3273680	Could you do me a favor here?
3273680	3275320	Explain Roblox Roblox.
3275320	3276320	Like yeah.
3276320	3277320	Okay.
3277320	3279800	Why Roblox explain yourself.
3279800	3285120	So Roblox is basically this platform that you go on there.
3285120	3289980	It's free to play and you can actually play games.
3289980	3293000	It looks similar to Lego a little bit.
3293000	3300600	They have these really blocky, iconic characters that you play as, and what's unique about
3300600	3305720	it though, is all of this content in, in these games are all user generated.
3305720	3314000	So basically if I, I could go on there, develop a game in Lua and sell content on this platform
3314000	3316760	and basically make money off of this platform.
3316760	3320680	And a lot of people do that and it's gotten so big though.
3320680	3324160	That's like, you know, they have merchandise like crazy.
3324160	3330360	Um, there's just so much merchandise, toys, uh, I'm surprised they don't have like shows
3330360	3333400	or anything yet, but it's, my kids play this constantly.
3333400	3338520	It is like literally the only game that they play is Roblox aside from Minecraft occasionally,
3338520	3340640	but mostly Roblox.
3340640	3348400	And it's like the dumbest, I mean, it's like the stuff that they're playing is definitely
3348400	3356800	made by kids or folks that are not used to game development is jank as fuck, but they're
3356800	3358080	having fun with it.
3358080	3363000	So that's fine, but there are some things that are very much like, you know, you need
3363000	3368560	to pay Roblox, which is the in game currency to do different things.
3368560	3371880	So I don't know.
3371880	3374040	It's a huge, huge, huge platform.
3374040	3377400	How is it different than Minecraft is absolutely different.
3377400	3380080	So where's Minecraft is basically the same thing.
3380080	3385760	You can kind of tweak it a little bit to, um, make your own stuff like your own levels
3385760	3386960	and everything.
3386960	3391920	This is basically like a sandbox.
3391920	3393480	Think of like Gary's mod a little bit.
3393480	3394680	So it's like a sandbox.
3394680	3399280	You can build worlds with your own graphics, your own sound, whatever.
3399280	3403200	Um, a lot of it's ripped off of IPs that they definitely don't own.
3403200	3407680	Um, but you know, that's the least of it.
3407680	3408680	Okay.
3408680	3412840	The oof sound as iconic as it is in this game is the least of it.
3412840	3419080	I mean, they're just ripping off anything you can imagine and just the most horrid combination
3419080	3424680	of audio visuals in imaginable, but Bobby does point out in chat too.
3424680	3425680	They worked there.
3425680	3427200	They worked their oof out.
3427200	3430280	I'm paraphrasing, but they worked it all at Tommy, Tommy and Roblox.
3430280	3431280	They cool now.
3431280	3432280	Anyway.
3432280	3433280	Yes.
3433280	3436160	So, um, it, but basically think of it as like a big platform.
3436160	3442720	Like we've seen some of the stuff with like, um, project spark on the Microsoft, uh, platforms.
3442720	3444800	There's this new thing that's through unreal.
3444800	3449440	That's kind of like that as well, where you can build your own worlds and dreams, dreams
3449440	3454000	probably be a little bit like dreams if you could monetize dreams and it looked way more
3454000	3460500	jank than, uh, that is, you know, honest, honestly, I should probably decide to play
3460500	3461500	a stream on Roblox.
3461500	3465720	One of these days, uh, my kids keep asking me to do that, but like I've tried playing
3465720	3469460	with them and it's the stuff that they play is just very janky.
3469460	3472040	Like it bothers me how janky it is.
3472040	3475200	And, uh, but I mean, someday I could do it.
3475200	3476200	It's all in Lua.
3476200	3481360	So it's pretty easy to script for it's just, I don't know Lua, so I'd have to learn that,
3481360	3485400	but what better way to learn, um, getting you some other comments from chat.
3485400	3489440	Zen monkey 11 says Roblox has nine versus nine multiplayer baseball.
3489440	3492520	I'm unimpressed by that EA and two K won't ever do that.
3492520	3498480	Uh, Questbuster says some Roblox users have made a living on making things on Roblox in
3498480	3499480	the six figure range.
3499480	3500480	Oh, well, there you go.
3500840	3502360	Pixel poops Roblox edition.
3502360	3503360	Get on it.
3503360	3504360	Granted.
3504360	3507200	Like, you know, I'm, I am making fun of the stuff that I see my kids play, but my kids
3507200	3508800	play some really dumb stuff.
3508800	3513480	Like there's actually like very polished things that are on this platform.
3513480	3516140	Um, and there's some things that aren't very polished.
3516140	3520500	Like for example, something that my kids are really into was piggy for a while and piggy
3520500	3529000	is kind of like, if you combine five nights at Freddy's with Peppa pig, it was that if
3529000	3530400	you can imagine that.
3530400	3532520	I'd rather not.
3532520	3539120	So it's, it's, there's a lot of weird stuff on there, but binary binary six, six, seven
3539120	3543400	and chat says my daughter just likes doing the obstacle course stuff and is much better
3543400	3544400	at it than I am.
3544400	3548600	Hey, if anything binary, um, take comfort in the fact that when your daughter gets to
3548600	3552160	be our age, like when your daughter's in her forties, um, she'll lose all that video game
3552160	3553160	skill.
3553160	3554160	Cause that's what happened to me.
3554160	3557200	I used to be able to beat mega man too easy peasy.
3557200	3558320	You know, no, no problem.
3558320	3559320	Quick man stage.
3559320	3560320	No problem.
3560320	3562320	You do it now.
3562320	3563440	Mess.
3563440	3566600	So take comfort in that one day.
3566600	3572280	She might be better than you now, but it won't last forever anyway.
3572280	3575040	Nothing lasts forever.
3575040	3576040	And not Roblox.
3576040	3577040	That's for sure.
3577040	3578040	All right.
3578040	3582360	But it's, it's interesting just how much, you know, the Roblox was valued at.
3582360	3585560	Like that was like four times the worth of Bethesda or something like that.
3585560	3586560	It's crazy.
3586560	3587560	Yeah.
3587560	3588960	Well it could go down eventually.
3588960	3591840	Like there's a lot of things that are overvalued right now.
3591840	3593240	Um, GameStop.
3593240	3598240	So true, but I'm on that ship, so it's all good.
3598240	3599520	All right.
3599520	3600520	To the moon, right?
3600520	3601520	Sweet money.
3601520	3602520	Yeah.
3602520	3603520	All right.
3603520	3607000	Uh, let's talk about, Hey, one of the systems I know you can play Roblox on cause I think
3607000	3612360	like the five minutes I tried, tried Roblox and I was like, what the hell am I doing?
3612360	3614000	It was on my Xbox one.
3614000	3620120	Well, the Xbox ones as well as Xbox series Xs, all the Xboxes, well from Xbox one, not
3620120	3626280	the 360 or the old one, but all the newer Xboxes are getting a new software update.
3626280	3630920	It will be adding some features, but it's also going to remove some features.
3630920	3634800	There's going to be a compatibility patch for the new Xbox wireless headset.
3634800	3640400	So that's kind of nice, but what they're getting rid of live TV listings in one guide.
3640400	3643480	So you might remember, do you remember on the Xbox one, they really wanted you to hook
3643480	3647760	up your TV through, actually, some of you might still do this out there, honestly.
3647760	3648760	And it's fine.
3648760	3654520	Um, yeah, I would do it too if I'd remembered to and I set up my TV, but, uh, there's not
3654520	3656640	going to be TV listings in one guide anymore.
3656640	3657640	It's going away.
3657640	3662120	So no, no TV guide channel built into your, do people even know what that is anymore?
3662120	3666280	I don't know, but that the listings will not be built in to the Xbox.
3666280	3671480	You're going to have to rely on most TVs have that built in now though my, uh, my television
3671480	3673720	has that built into it, which is weird.
3673720	3676400	So I guess just went a different place.
3676400	3682120	So, uh, you, the one guide will still stay so you can watch TV through HDMI.
3682120	3685600	So like it's not suddenly shutting off your ability to actually watch TV.
3685600	3688320	It's just the schedules are actually going away.
3688320	3692440	Now other big features that are coming in the March update, you can actually enable
3692440	3696440	or disable the auto HDR and FPS boost.
3696440	3698960	That was what I was trying to think of earlier, the frame boost.
3699520	3704240	So if a game supports it, you can boost the frame rate up to even possibly 120 frames
3704240	3706840	per second, just depending on what game you're playing.
3706840	3708240	So that's kind of cool.
3708240	3712200	Some other minor tweaks, including achievements, going back to the mobile app, uh, and things
3712200	3713200	like that.
3713200	3716760	But that is a big Xbox console update that is on its way.
3716760	3722120	Um, DJ Rama S talking about the TV thing says, I did that.
3722120	3726560	I used to have my Fios box connected to my Xbox, but I had to remove that connection
3726560	3732280	because I now have a 4k TV and that Xbox HDMI input isn't 4k.
3732280	3734600	Oh, I didn't realize that.
3734600	3738440	That's probably a big ouch as to why a lot of TV people aren't using that now.
3738440	3740000	Um, let's see.
3740000	3743200	Uh, Zen monkey 11 says I was born in 2000.
3743200	3747000	What's a TV guide?
3747000	3748000	Don't do this.
3748000	3753360	Did you, are you, are you really going to choose violence today?
3753360	3759320	Um, look it up on Wikipedia.
3759320	3760320	Get off my lawn.
3760320	3766440	Uh, bonds double six says Pluto TV for now I, yeah, Pluto TV is, is an Xbox app and I've
3766440	3767440	used that too.
3767440	3771680	I mentioned a clue earlier and there's a lot of, they have a lot of interesting channels.
3771680	3775880	They used to have a RuPaul's drag race channel that just showed nothing but drag race all
3775880	3776880	day.
3776880	3779040	That went away probably because of the paramount thing.
3779040	3782560	But they do have as well, but they have a survivor channel, which is also a CBS, but
3782560	3785040	they have a survivor channel, which plays nothing but old.
3785040	3786880	I'm talking like old.
3786880	3791560	I saw survivor, the Australian outback on it the other day, like old ass episodes of
3791560	3792560	survivor.
3792560	3793560	They just play all day long.
3793560	3794560	So it's kind of fun.
3794560	3795560	So, all right.
3795560	3796560	Oh, good.
3796560	3797760	Uh, Zen monkey 11 says I'm joking.
3797760	3798880	I wasn't born in 2000.
3798880	3802560	Oh, you did choose violence today, didn't you?
3802560	3803560	Liar.
3803560	3804560	All right.
3804560	3808440	Anyway, that's the Xbox March update before I fight, fight our chatters.
3808440	3811640	Moving on to our next story, dark Sakura.
3811640	3816960	Well, one of my favorite ever game series are the teenage mutant Ninja Turtles arcade
3816960	3818920	ones like turtles in time.
3818920	3822760	And the first one that came out, those are, have always been like some of my favorites.
3822760	3831120	And so there is a new one coming out in the same vein as those others.
3831120	3837560	It's going to be called a teenage mutant Ninja Turtles shredders revenge.
3837560	3839320	And it's actually looking pretty neat.
3839320	3845640	And on top of that, you can play as all four turtles and splinter and April, although I
3845640	3847240	don't see any Casey Jones anywhere.
3847240	3851040	I don't know what's going on with that.
3851040	3853280	But it looks, it looks really good.
3853280	3854440	It's a 2d fighter.
3854440	3857840	The characters have really great personality.
3857840	3860680	Everything looks really awesome.
3860680	3867800	I'm, I'm really, really hoping that that this does well, that it gives us more like that,
3867800	3874120	but it's the same, uh, uh, you know, uh, group that did like wonder boy, the dragons trap,
3874120	3877600	you know, so, oh, I didn't realize it was them.
3877600	3881120	Oh, that was a good conversion tribute games.
3881120	3882920	Nice.
3882920	3884200	Yeah.
3884200	3887040	So, um, so I'm really looking forward to it.
3887040	3891920	I mean, we pretty much like, Dan was like the other day, Hey, there's a new teenage mutant
3891920	3892160	turtles.
3892160	3892600	Look at this.
3892600	3894360	And I'm like, Ooh, yeah.
3894360	3897680	So they really hit that sweet spot of just giving us what we want.
3897720	3902400	You know, like when people think of the Ninja Turtles video game, they think of that, you know, even the
3902400	3908120	guy born in 2000 thinks of the old school nineties, pizzeria arcade game.
3908120	3913440	Like, yes, I know there's been other Ninja Turtles games, but none of them have captured quite the magic
3913440	3916760	that that, cause they don't ask about the later Ninja Turtles games.
3916760	3921920	Everybody asks about, you remember, you remember that nineties Ninja Turtles game that we played at the
3921920	3922360	arcade.
3922360	3923960	You remember that one with the four players, unfortunately.
3923960	3926280	So I'm glad they're kind of going back to the formula that works.
3926280	3930560	And I think it's really smart because this isn't in an arcade and you can do a little more with it.
3930560	3934200	I think it's really smart for them to think about what if we did other characters, I don't think they've
3934200	3936080	confirmed the April and shredder thing.
3936080	3938240	People are kind of reading into it from the trailer.
3938320	3942480	Well, they were in, they were in, uh, the preview fighting.
3942520	3942880	Yeah.
3942880	3945760	So, so, so people are assuming that you can play as them because they're fighting.
3946080	3949200	Um, but I think that's, I think that's great.
3949640	3954600	I think that's a great way to kind of expand on the idea without changing the idea.
3954800	3960800	Like, I didn't realize I want to play as April O'Neill in the Ninja Turtles game until you showed me that.
3960840	3967160	Now I'm like, Oh, I want to do that April O'Neill too with that hideous, that hideous yellow jacket.
3968320	3971560	Yeah, this is totally nineties Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
3971560	3975720	So, um, I mean, Tiger call was talking about it being in the eighties.
3975760	3978480	Uh, the, the series was not eighties.
3978480	3979120	It was nineties.
3980240	3982240	Um, I think it was on that bubble.
3982280	3984880	I think like season one was like 89.
3984920	3987680	Like, but we're, we're, we're nickel and diamond at this point.
3987880	3996880	So now if they were going to do eighties though, it would be cool if there's like a bloody, all red bandana mode, you know, that's got like,
3997360	3999040	Oh, you want to go comics?
3999560	4001280	I'm going comics with this one.
4001400	4002120	All right.
4002240	4002720	All right.
4002880	4003240	Yeah.
4003480	4007080	Cause that's the original, that is the absolutely original.
4007560	4012000	But that, but again, this is the one that people really remember, you know, that era of the,
4012040	4017200	the cartoon that folks are saying came out in late 87, whatever.
4017520	4017920	All right.
4018880	4019840	It's it was on the boat.
4019960	4021520	It was on for so long.
4021560	4024120	Most people probably picked it up in reruns in the nineties.
4024120	4025880	You know, it's, there's a lot of that type of stuff.
4026360	4027840	I was watching it with my brothers.
4028160	4028440	Yeah.
4029480	4032560	So, uh, honestly I was watching it more than my brothers.
4033760	4035440	I think it looks great and I'm excited.
4035480	4041360	Uh, I, I did not make the connection that the wonder, uh, wonderboy trap, the dragons trap people were doing it.
4041360	4042800	And that makes me even more excited.
4043040	4048800	Like there's just certain studios that are getting the retro re the blaster master zero folks, another one of them.
4049040	4050800	They're just getting the remakes.
4050840	4051320	Right.
4051680	4053280	Like they're doing the retro remakes.
4053320	4053800	Right.
4054000	4055200	And that's very exciting.
4055400	4056560	So awesome.
4056560	4059440	You know, I would still think it would be fun though.
4059440	4065920	I mean, I love that they're going off of the previous games, you know, like the one, the arcade games that we have.
4066680	4076480	I honestly would also really like to see the similar type of game, but in the IDW universe, because there's some really neat characters in the IDW comics right now.
4076480	4079600	That's I've actually been reading that fairly religiously.
4081280	4081720	All right.
4081800	4083320	Anyway, this is still making me happy.
4083320	4084600	So no, it's all good.
4084600	4088360	I think that trailer made a lot of people happy because it was also, it's just unexpected.
4088840	4093680	Like, you know, it kind of came out of nowhere that like, Hey, by the way, there's a new Ninja Turtles game coming.
4094480	4095760	And it's old school.
4095760	4101240	Here we are on Mario day and I'm expecting Mario announcements and all we get is Ninja Turtles.
4101240	4104880	It's like, geez, but I'll tell you, I didn't even realize I'm dressed for Mario day.
4104920	4108360	I'm wearing my Mario shirt today on stream for those watching on Twitch.
4108400	4110360	I just realized I've had this shirt forever.
4110680	4112520	The shirt is very old, but it's one of my faves.
4113120	4113440	All right.
4113480	4115320	It is not as old as Mario three.
4115560	4117480	Um, but probably close.
4117800	4119360	All right, let's move on.
4119640	4120280	Uh, okay.
4120280	4127640	Loki, this is another one you're going to have to explain because this, this doesn't make sense, but can you try to make sense of it?
4127640	4128800	Loki, this next story.
4129720	4137920	So, yeah, so the big, like buzzword this week has been NFT, which is non fungible tokens.
4138280	4142160	So it's basically, I got an, I got NFT for this.
4142160	4143040	No fucking time.
4145640	4148000	It's basically what it is.
4148080	4158800	Is like, you know how with Bitcoin, there's kind of the blockchain, the track who has, um, possession of a specific Bitcoin at any time.
4158800	4164600	And so you can track that actually being able to take a digital good and have ownership of it.
4164840	4166320	So that's kind of what it is.
4166320	4179600	So people now are selling all sorts of dumb things as NFTs, um, everything from like, just like artwork to really dumb things.
4179600	4184640	Like I saw someone that took a picture of their scrotum and they are selling as an F T.
4184640	4190920	So, um, obviously folks are really trying to cash in on this right now.
4190960	4192680	Um, was it a nice scrotum?
4192680	4194360	Don't answer, don't answer.
4194360	4196800	It's iDubbbz from, it's iDubbbz.
4196800	4198080	Was it FreshlyShorn?
4200080	4201800	He just did the bat wing thing.
4201800	4204480	So it was tastefully, the sun was coming through it.
4204480	4205720	You could see the veins and everything.
4205720	4207040	Okay, enough.
4208760	4214760	Anyways, so they, they're selling like, was it a Beeple?
4214760	4216400	I don't know if you know of Beeple.
4216640	4217760	Was it a Beeple?
4217760	4219360	I don't know if you know of Beeple.
4219360	4227120	There, Beeple is a, uh, an artist who actually puts out, he put a new piece of art every day for like 15 years.
4227120	4229080	So he sold his collection of art.
4229400	4240080	Um, and there's one massive, like huge image for 69, I think it was like $69 million, some ridiculous amount of money that people pay for that.
4240400	4245360	And what you get is basically like a digital image, but you own it.
4246040	4251600	Which I don't understand that in the sense that, um, it's a digital image.
4251600	4252920	I mean, I can make copies of it.
4252920	4257320	I can just do whatever, but apparently it's somehow you get ownership of it.
4257680	4262640	So I don't really know how that works, but it's the thing that people are trying to make money off of right now.
4262680	4265440	The certificate of authenticity is yours.
4266720	4275240	I mean, in theory, I get the NFT thing in theory as like a way to support artists, especially during this difficult time.
4275480	4277560	We're going to art galleries, maybe doesn't work.
4277560	4288120	So if the artist chooses to use this as a way to drive sales so that they can buy food and pay rent, I don't have a problem with that.
4288120	4289360	And I'm not going to shade that.
4290120	4292800	Where this is getting out of control is this shit I'm hearing about.
4292800	4293240	Like what?
4293240	4299360	You can go on Twitter, tag a certain account and like, cause I hear people are doing this to like get this Twitter account.
4299520	4311280	They're, they're tagging like Disney and Marvel tweets as NFT and trying to sell those to get the Disney and Marvel lawyers to like shut NFT down as if you could do that.
4311280	4311680	I don't know.
4311800	4317480	Like if somebody tried to sell OLR, like one of our episodes is NFT.
4317760	4324400	I'm going to tell you here and now that they don't mean shit unless they're coming from us and we say we're selling it.
4324400	4327200	And like, then those NFTs are garbage.
4327280	4328280	They don't mean anything.
4328520	4330600	And I don't think we have a plan to do that.
4330600	4334440	Although, I mean, like if the price was right, maybe, but I just don't, I don't, what, what's the point?
4335200	4338840	You could own Orange On Radio episode 860, but what's, what's the point?
4339160	4344000	If you want to support us, you, which you certainly don't have to, we've been doing this show for free for years.
4344400	4348720	You, you guys know plenty of other, you can do the subs, you can do the biddies, you know, all that stuff that you do on Twitch.
4348720	4349240	That's lovely.
4349240	4349840	That's wonderful.
4349840	4352720	You don't have to, but a lot of you do, and we love that and appreciate that.
4352720	4355760	You can do the merchandise at vognetwork.com slash shop, cheap plug.
4356240	4358040	You don't have to, but we love it when you do.
4358440	4377960	Um, I just, but if somebody were to try to like make OLR NFTs outside of us and like Bobby and Jason and people that would maybe have a little bit of a right to state claim to a little bit of OLR outside of that bubble, like, no, like don't do that.
4378000	4380440	Like it's, can't, can't I just say it's worthless?
4380440	4381720	It's it, I don't know.
4381720	4382240	It's weird.
4382440	4384600	I find the whole tagging things.
4384640	4385920	Anything is NFT.
4385920	4387280	Your balls is NFT.
4387320	4389240	I find that very strange.
4391000	4393040	I think it's a technology that needs to be perfected.
4394040	4394480	Yeah.
4394720	4397320	So anyways, uh, getting back to gaming though.
4397320	4403440	So one example of some, um, indie game companies to kind of take advantage of this.
4403760	4416560	So there was this game, uh, called, uh, this, uh, guy, uh, was a company, Roarer, um, who was a creator of indie games, like the passage, the castle doctrine and one hour, one life.
4417040	4433840	So he put out an NFT auction called the crypto doctrine, and there was 155 paintings that he had originally commissioned for the use of in the castle doctrine, which is a game about home defense, I guess.
4434000	4444160	And anyways, inside that, um, so he was auctioning off these 145 paintings, but the folks that made those paintings, the individual artists.
4445040	4453240	Didn't have any idea that he was doing this and basically said, no, Hey, I didn't consent to selling the art as an NFT, though.
4453240	4459400	I'm not sure if you commissioned something, if you really have control on over what it can and cannot be used for.
4459400	4464920	And in the sense that you're using a promote promotional materials for your game, I don't know.
4464920	4468080	That doesn't make any sense to me, but that's between the artist and the buyer.
4468280	4468960	Exactly.
4468960	4474400	So apparently a lot of the creators with that, you know, were unaware that they were doing that.
4474440	4490520	Um, there is also, um, let's see what else, uh, lots of folks just basically, you know, and I think this kind of goes back to, we were talking about the Twitter stuff where people are just being able to tag an account and sell it as an NFT.
4491120	4500800	A lot of like content that they're not really sure who is the owner of it in trying to sell it now as an NFT, because Taco Bell is selling NFTs.
4501080	4507320	I mean, so yeah, it's just no, no, no fucking tacos.
4508840	4509120	Yeah.
4509120	4513680	And the thing with that too, it's like these NFTs, like you could have some really cool stuff with it.
4513680	4522800	Like say if we had an OLR NFT or something like that, where like you buy those and then it gets you access to special things or something like that.
4523000	4523960	That'd be pretty cool.
4523960	4526480	But that is literally a Twitch subscription.
4526520	4528440	That is literally what that will do.
4528800	4529040	Yeah.
4529040	4531960	But the truth, but this is going to be more expensive.
4532560	4533800	So, okay.
4533840	4534440	I see.
4535400	4537240	Well then sub at the $20 level.
4537240	4539360	I'm not going to stop anyone from doing that.
4540280	4543000	No, you need to go higher millions.
4544680	4548080	Anyways, yeah, well, and okay.
4548080	4556320	So aside from all the stupidness that's along with that, then there's also the talk about the whole blockchain technology.
4556320	4572480	And so how energy inefficient it is and how, especially with crypto mining is literally using tons of electricity to make these calculations to see, to calculate the blockchain.
4572480	4581480	And so it's causing issues with pollution even because of all the electricity that it's being used up to do this.
4581680	4594840	So that's also another thing that folks are kind of, kind of basic climbing down on all sorts of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology because of stuff like this.
4595200	4596680	So I don't know, it's messy.
4597080	4607520	I don't really know what we can really use this for, but certainly I don't have anything that interests me as far as the NFTs that have been offered so far.
4607520	4614560	I mean, I just, I don't see what the point is in owning like a one of a kind digital item that doesn't make any sense.
4615400	4623760	IceP1 in chat, love that name, says, one of the things NFTs can do is earn the originator or royalty.
4623920	4633120	And I do want to emphasize, and I think Loki feels this way too, is that again, to support artists who are struggling right now in the times of COVID.
4633240	4637720	Again, the arrangement between the buyer and the artist is between the buyer and the artist.
4637840	4645320	And if that arrangement is I'm giving you this special token, that means this is yours and for everybody else, it's just a copy.
4645480	4648040	If and that's something they agree to, then that's fine.
4648160	4649200	I don't have a problem with that.
4649200	4650520	I don't think anybody has a problem with that.
4650760	4662040	Where shit gets weird is where anybody can tag something as an NFT and these things that aren't really art, like Jack's first tweet is an NFT.
4662040	4662720	Why?
4662840	4664480	And Jack doesn't need the money.
4664640	4668040	You know that, that he, he might've been doing it for charity.
4668200	4673280	If he did, if he's doing it for charity, I'll, I'll, I'll back off a little bit on what I just said.
4673640	4677480	Um, but I think, I think you kind of hopefully see the difference here.
4677600	4683720	You know, when it's a, when it's a struggling artist finding a new inventive way, like it's, it's their version of a Twitch sub or whatever it is.
4683720	4685040	An NFT is cool.
4685280	4698560	Like I might even look into that for, for an artist who I really like, but for like, you know, tagging random tweets and everything on the internet, video game art, you had nothing to do with and labeling that an NFT.
4698720	4701160	That's where it's like, okay, this shit is out of control.
4701760	4707280	Like, and you're just begging for this to be regulated, which you probably, nobody's going to win in that scenario.
4707280	4708000	If that makes sense.
4708040	4708720	I hope that makes sense.
4708920	4715600	So I hope, hope that kind of makes our stance clear where it's like, where we, where we are making fun of NFT or where we are not making fun of NFT.
4715640	4716480	I hope that's kind of clear.
4716960	4718600	So anything you want to add to that Loki?
4718720	4720000	I, I get it good.
4720920	4721960	I think that's about it.
4722040	4722400	Yeah.
4722920	4723320	All right.
4724040	4724880	Well then let's move on.
4725040	4728840	Let's move on to something that I think a lot of people are going to have a hard time understanding.
4729080	4739080	And that is, uh, this Twitch program that's happening behind the scenes about scoring streamers to possibly be used with ad sales.
4739120	4741000	So let me talk about what's going on.
4741200	4745640	So there's something that's happening behind the scenes called the brand safety score.
4745840	4759280	It was found in Twitch's internal API by Twitter user Tayari CS, who talked about a little bit, wrote some tweets about it and actually posted pictures of the change log on Twitter.
4759720	4768040	Now, Twitch, you know, because they, they probably weren't really ready to talk about this, but then why do you put the code out in live if you don't want it to be found?
4768040	4780920	Cause there are people that do this, uh, Twitch did put a statement on it saying we are exploring ways to improve the experience on Twitch for viewers and creators, including efforts to better match the appropriate ads to the right communities.
4781160	4783320	User privacy is critical on Twitch.
4783520	4788080	And as we refine the process, we will not pursue plans that compromise that priority.
4788360	4789560	Nothing is launched yet.
4789560	4794280	No personal information was shared and we will keep our community informed of any updates along the way.
4794800	4798600	The original tweet by Tayari CS, uh, was a series of tweets.
4798600	4811680	The first one reading Twitch has added an automatic brand safety score, which grades how brand friendly every streamer is based on things like chat behavior, ban history, manual ratings by Twitch staff.
4811920	4812920	Games played.
4812920	4814520	Times could say the N word.
4815480	4820080	Age, you honestly shouldn't be on Twitch if the answer is one, to be honest.
4820080	4821200	But anyway, that's another story.
4821600	4831120	Uh, games played, age, auto, if the answer is one and you are in a group that is not supposed to say that word, just to make that very clear.
4831360	4831720	All right.
4831840	4834320	Games played, age, auto mod, and more.
4835200	4836040	Uh, and so on.
4836520	4850760	Um, it's kind of like that whole argument that's going on about use of the LGBTQ tag because unfortunately Twitch currently, or at least of a few days ago and Dark Sakura try to.
4851440	4852640	You're not going to like this.
4852640	4854200	I'm just, don't shoot the messenger.
4854880	4865040	Twitch unfortunately has labeled that LGBTQIA is okay for allies to use because for some people, the A means allies.
4866120	4870120	It, the A, just to be clear, actually stands for asexual.
4870240	4870600	Okay.
4870640	4871960	Just, just so we're all clear on this.
4872600	4885040	Um, but this has caused people to kind of ask Twitch or, or, or some people who are using the LGBTQIA tag on their streams are saying, I'm doing this because I want people to know that this is a safe space.
4885040	4890880	This is a place that, you know, LGBTQ people can be and, and they're accepted and I'm not going to judge them or that stuff.
4891320	4897720	And my response to that is, you know, again, when you're well intentioned, I'm not going to attack dog you.
4897920	4900400	So I'm not going to attack dog anybody who does that.
4900560	4919240	But my simple answer would be, if your space is not welcoming to diverse groups, including LGBTQIA, including issues of race, including issues of gender, including if, if your space is not welcoming to that, then why the fuck are you allowed on Twitch in the first place?
4922600	4925080	Just, just a question I'd like to know the answer to.
4925600	4932520	If, if you are, if you are a dangerous place for LGBTQ or any of that, why are you on Twitch in the first, you shouldn't be here.
4933520	4934640	Just making that clear.
4935000	4953440	Anyway, I think it would be great personally, if Twitch brought back the Twitch unity tag, because I felt that was a very good all encompassing tag to sort of show that you as a streamer accept a certain set of values and that you're going to enforce those values on your stream.
4953600	4958840	In my personal opinion, they should bring that tag back, but I don't, I don't work at Twitch.
4958840	4959440	So whatever.
4959840	4962480	Anyway, I'm sorry I got on a tangent, but it was an important one.
4962920	4976720	Um, now going back to the tweet, uh, the brand safety score talks about if, uh, you know, a streamer is ranked based on their age, like if they're over 18 or 21, what's their suspension history like, what's their relationship history with Twitch and so forth.
4977720	4985840	I don't think people should be too freaked out about this, although certainly not everybody's going to like the whole big brother is watching you kind of thing.
4986400	4986960	You know what I mean?
4986960	5001000	Like people are not going to like that they're being ranked behind the scenes and all this stuff, but I get that Twitch is doing it because if there is a streamer out there that is very nasty towards certain minority communities.
5001000	5005200	Again, I want to know why they're on Twitch to begin with, but fine.
5005800	5014680	Different topic, but there's going to be advertisers that don't want to advertise with that audience because they don't want their products associated with that, right?
5014920	5017280	Because what always happens with boycotts, right?
5017280	5020360	When you decide you're going to boycott Fox News or something, who do they go after?
5020360	5021680	The advertisers, right?
5022080	5037040	So I think Twitch is kind of trying to create that environment for the advertisers, basically, so that they can somewhat guarantee that they're not going to be having their advertisements on streams run by assholes.
5037680	5041480	Again, why do assholes get to stream on Twitch?
5041920	5047040	Freedom of speech doesn't apply here at Twitch Amazon private company.
5047720	5049400	It's a yeah, it's a private company.
5049400	5052680	There's absolutely nothing that a person could complain about.
5052680	5056240	I mean, well, they could complain about it, but it's not going to do anything.
5056320	5057480	There's no legal precedents.
5057720	5058080	Right.
5059000	5065920	So anyway, um, DJ Obama S in chat says, I second that on both podcasts and Twitch streams.
5065920	5066400	I do.
5066400	5072960	I have staffers that represent LGBTQ, but as a straight cis male, I won't use it for that reason alone.
5073200	5079040	Um, that, and we don't, we don't use that tag here, even though I'm gay, Dark Soccer's asexual.
5079040	5080360	She's talked about that before.
5080600	5084840	Um, Loki is our token cis, cis hetero white dude.
5085200	5093080	Um, you know, it's, but we don't use that tag because it's not that a, it's not all that what the show is about.
5093080	5097800	B, um, not all of us are directly LGBTQ and so forth.
5098080	5102120	But if there was a Twitch unity tag, I'd be happy to use that.
5102840	5108200	Because I do think this show subscribes to certain standards where everybody is welcome here.
5108360	5112480	You know, I know we use the tagline where every gamer has a voice a lot here.
5112680	5117000	Um, I think another tagline, although we don't own this, we didn't start this, but I love it.
5117000	5120800	And I embrace it is that gaming is for everyone, period.
5121800	5125000	And I think that's a standard that we, uh, subscribe to here at OLR.
5125320	5128240	So yes, Act F says Loki is here and supportive.
5128240	5130360	Yes, Loki is awesome.
5130480	5131320	Loki is awesome.
5131320	5133320	On this show, Loki is awesome off this show.
5133320	5136400	I'm not going to inflate his ego too much, but Loki is amazing.
5136400	5138160	And OLR wouldn't be the same without him.
5138160	5138720	We all know that.
5139360	5139720	All right.
5140200	5145120	Um, you know, he's not LGBTQ, but nobody's perfect.
5146560	5146960	All right.
5147480	5147880	Sorry.
5149440	5149840	All right.
5150360	5150880	Anyway.
5151240	5152360	Uh, all right.
5153440	5154280	Let's move on.
5154320	5155400	Uh, I think I said enough.
5155440	5157840	I I've gone on too many tangents from that story.
5157840	5158920	So let's go to the next one.
5158920	5159680	Dark Sakura.
5160680	5165160	So, um, Squinnix has some news for us.
5165280	5165760	Yay.
5165960	5171080	Well, actually we're going to be, um, getting more information about it on the
5171080	5176560	18th, but they are going to show some details on the next life is strange game.
5177000	5182360	Um, there's going to be a 40 minutes starting at 1 PM Eastern, um, to, you
5182360	5187960	know, go with all the upcoming games are going to be, um, and they're also talking
5188200	5190360	about an April 1st release date.
5190880	5197400	Um, also the game, uh, Outriders will be included with, with that conversation.
5199600	5200080	Interesting.
5200560	5203240	I think some people are blowing this way out of proportion because
5203320	5206080	Square Enix announced an event and now people are like, oh, they're
5206080	5207200	going to show final fantasy.
5209720	5212080	A lot of people are totally into life is strange.
5212080	5216120	And I think that it's definitely gonna, you know, raise some hype.
5216680	5217240	Oh, for sure.
5217400	5217640	Yeah.
5217640	5219000	People are super into that series.
5219040	5222760	There was a spinoff game too, that was in the, the lion.
5222760	5223680	I can't remember the name of it.
5223880	5225520	Somebody in shadow shouted out, I'm sure.
5225720	5229440	Um, and I imagine maybe, maybe because of the popularity of life is strange,
5229600	5235280	maybe Square Enix, maybe, maybe bolded underlined has other type of those like
5235280	5242200	narrative games maybe in process and who knows they could tie into other IPs, but
5242200	5245680	I'm, I'm, I'm setting these real like tinfoil hat, crazy expectations.
5245680	5247280	I don't think anyone should go into this with.
5247320	5249480	I think this is something for the life of strange fans.
5249680	5253080	I think, um, you know, people that are into the series will be very happy with this.
5253400	5256720	Other people should not expect things outside of that.
5257840	5259440	Outside of what dark soccer just mentioned with the
5259440	5260640	outsiders and all that stuff.
5260960	5261760	This is yeah.
5261760	5268640	Pretty much going to be a fairly specific type of release, if that makes sense.
5270280	5272040	So series of releases.
5272640	5272840	Yeah.
5273520	5275440	Well, yeah, because they're episodic games.
5275520	5279120	So there will certainly be probably three or five of them, just depending on how
5279120	5281160	many episodes they, they end up doing with that.
5281240	5282600	So, all right.
5282600	5286600	As soon as Matt Chat says Square Enix, it's totally not a direct event.
5286640	5290720	No, I think, I think your big news on other games, you know, obviously they've
5290720	5294040	been peppered other places like the Nintendo direct had a lot of Square Enix
5294040	5297360	news in it, PlayStation had a huge Square Enix news thing in it.
5297600	5299840	Um, but look, look for June.
5300160	5304600	You know, June is when they'll, they'll do another big update for E3.
5304840	5308440	I'm using my Cody fingers or whatever that turns out to look like.
5308920	5311960	So, all right, let's move on Loki.
5313360	5313960	All right.
5314640	5320800	Uh, so we've always heard so many stories of devs having to work
5320800	5323680	through not ideal conditions.
5324040	5325840	And here's some more stories about that.
5325840	5332440	So, uh, Capcom had their employees working at the office, um,
5332520	5337680	apparently after a cyber attack and also, um, in the office,
5337880	5340120	despite the COVID restrictions.
5340680	5344440	So apparently this is coming from a whistleblower report that claims
5344440	5348520	that the actual conditions for game developers at the company, uh, were
5348520	5354480	less than ideal and apparently Capcom had suffered a cyber attack with a
5354480	5358600	one terabyte of the employee and customer data stolen due to this attack.
5358680	5363920	Capcom wasn't able to safely have, uh, their external network secured
5364240	5366720	and have employees work remotely.
5366720	5371600	So in that case, they had idea to have them, uh, it says we're abandoning
5371600	5375000	the remote network for the time and have decided that there is no
5375000	5376520	choice, but to come to work.
5377280	5382840	And because of that, of course, folks were anxious, um, because of, you
5382840	5386600	know, distancing and everything may not be possible in that type of an
5386600	5391480	environment to be able to, um, you know, isolate yourself enough
5391480	5393200	without, you know, contaminating.
5393440	5396480	We've heard so many reports of different workplaces, you know,
5396680	5398200	having COVID spread through there.
5398840	5405800	But yeah, apparently, um, you know, they Capcom did respond saying, you
5405800	5409720	know, while there are none currently active within the company, employees
5409720	5414800	are free to form labor unions and Capcom strictly observes all relevant
5414800	5418760	laws and regulations regarding employees forming unions, Capcom is committed to
5418760	5420880	strictly observing all laws and regulations.
5421080	5421280	Wow.
5421280	5424840	That sounds like a lot of, uh, lawyer PRSP.
5425200	5427240	That's a very interesting statement.
5427880	5431640	I just, just the fact that they're like, go ahead, form a union.
5431680	5433200	Do it, do it, bitch.
5433240	5433760	Do it.
5434240	5438600	Well, cause cause there's been a lot of talk about the, these, um, employees
5438680	5443960	like in, in Gerald is forming a union because of the, um, to try to get
5443960	5445320	better working conditions.
5445320	5449120	So that it was kind of weird that that was the first thing that came to their
5449120	5451200	head when I'm talking about that stuff.
5451760	5454760	But yeah, I don't know.
5454760	5459760	It, it seems like, cause the punishment's not enough for these companies that
5459760	5462560	they're just going to go ahead and risk their employees because they see them as
5462560	5468040	just, you know, um, I'm surprised, I'm surprised we haven't seen an employee
5468040	5470000	who caught COVID Sue their employer.
5470880	5472720	Um, maybe, maybe it has happened.
5472720	5476160	I'm sure that it's probably happened.
5476160	5480440	I mean, especially in like, you know, these Amazon warehouses and stuff like
5480440	5485520	that, somebody, I mean, God, there's so many terrible working conditions with that.
5485600	5488240	I'm not saying, I'm not automatically saying, Oh, they should win.
5488240	5490920	And also I'm just saying, I'm surprised in this Sue happy U S of
5490920	5493400	a that we live in, we haven't seen, but you're right.
5493400	5494240	It probably has happened.
5494240	5495920	I'm just not paying enough attention, which is fair.
5497640	5501520	And then along with that though, we also had the developers of star citizen,
5501520	5506880	um, kind of fed up that they had to work during the, uh, that huge
5506880	5509320	snow storm that was in Texas.
5509760	5516160	And, um, apparently, you know, they were trying to juggle work and also,
5516200	5520760	um, you know, safety because, you know, a lot of the roads and everything were
5520760	5522720	closed and power outages and all that.
5523200	5530480	Um, basically, you know, there is a lot of, you know, issues with, you know,
5530520	5534760	just being able to safely travel and the fact that they're having to
5534760	5538280	come into work, um, is concerning.
5538600	5542920	Of course, CIG, uh, did come out and provide a statement saying our staff
5542920	5545960	safety and wellbeing are priority to us at all times.
5546400	5550840	And since the Austin offices, we had remained close to general staff since
5550840	5554360	the beginning of the pandemic, the teams working from home in the immediate
5554360	5558720	aftermath of the Texas storm, the studio leadership reached out to all 100 plus
5558720	5562960	employees through their managers individually, the offer support, of
5562960	5568640	course, you know, that doesn't really explain why they're coming into the
5568640	5569280	office.
5569600	5574160	Um, I don't know that stuff is dangerous.
5574160	5577200	I mean, lots of people die during that snow storm, just because of all the
5577200	5579920	power outages, not being able to stay warm and everything.
5579920	5582200	So I don't know why you would even risk it.
5582200	5584720	And during a pandemic, but again, it's Texas and they have the
5584720	5585640	whole state opening up.
5585640	5586320	So who knows?
5586520	5587040	Who knows?
5587080	5591760	Um, Bobby in chat, uh, with a good, uh, uh, follow up to what my, my question
5591760	5593840	I asked a lot about, um, suing employers.
5594240	5597760	Bobby says, uh, one of the things in the original economic relief bill that I
5597760	5601600	believe got taken out was to make companies not liable if their employees
5601600	5604720	caught COVID at work, it didn't make it in the final bill, but they tried.
5604720	5605880	And I was like, that's right.
5605920	5610600	I do remember that being, that being a thing, um, that they tried to put that
5610600	5612640	in there and thankfully it didn't go through.
5612640	5616320	I think in, you know, you gotta, you kind of walk a fine line.
5616320	5619320	This is an opinion, but I think especially in some of these cases that
5619320	5622200	Loki's pointing out, like, especially the star citizen thing, which isn't
5622200	5626480	even related to COVID, but like if your employer knowingly and willingly put
5626480	5631920	you in danger in a dangerous situation, um, and you have an injury because of
5631920	5637600	that, I kind of think like, you ought to have some type of legal recourse
5637640	5639240	through that, but that's my opinion.
5639240	5640880	And I get to have an opinion.
5641320	5646440	Um, so anyway, I just, I just can't believe a video game is worth that.
5646440	5650240	Cause you know, again, I didn't experience that Texas stuff firsthand,
5650240	5651680	but I had a lot of friends that did.
5651960	5654600	And, um, it sounded, it sounded horrible.
5654720	5656760	Like I don't really have any other word to describe it.
5656760	5658200	It just sounded horrible.
5658200	5661200	And I'm so sorry to my friends that had to go through that whole situation.
5661480	5664000	Um, and we can point the finger and we can blame all we want.
5664240	5665960	Um, but I'm not going to do that right now.
5666120	5669000	But what I am going to do is just express the frustration that
5669000	5670880	like a fricking video game.
5671240	5675200	Getting made was that important to put people's lives further
5675200	5677400	at risk in a horrible situation.
5678640	5679840	Yeah, that is crazy.
5680000	5680280	Yeah.
5681240	5681640	All right.
5682560	5683920	Disgusting is what it is.
5684240	5684720	It is.
5684760	5688040	Um, as Joan had a mat chat says, I work in live TV realm.
5688080	5691400	I have had to come into work during snow storms, hurricanes, whole city blackouts.
5691400	5695200	I was never forced to come into work per se, but you feel that employee politics
5695200	5698880	pressure, you bring up a very interesting point though, and I don't know how far
5698880	5704080	down this rabbit hole I want to go, but I think in certain industries, you know,
5704080	5708040	there's going to be certain risks and I think the world of live TV, and I only
5708040	5714240	say this because again, I don't work in live TV, but I did, I wanted to, at one
5714240	5718080	point I wanted to be a reporter, actually, I wanted to be a weatherman and I interned
5718080	5719920	at a CBS station for a little while.
5720160	5723240	And they got to talk to a lot of reporters about their lives and so forth.
5723600	5728080	And I sort of think like if I had, and maybe part of the reason I didn't go into
5728080	5733000	that life was because there were certain things about it maybe I wasn't really
5733000	5739280	willing to go for, you know, like the excitement of, and I mean the excitement
5739400	5744840	of finding a dead body because it's going to make a big story that, that, that whole
5744840	5748920	experience still to this day sits really weird with me and I'm not sure that was
5748920	5749960	really for me.
5750280	5752240	And again, I'm not, I mean, look, look, people watch it.
5752320	5755400	I understand that's the industry and that's not your industry, Matt, that
5755400	5759240	brought that up, but like it's just, there's certain things you kind of know
5759240	5762600	you're gonna put up with to be in certain areas.
5763000	5768480	Making video games and risking your life for it is not one of them.
5768760	5772320	But like if you go into the field to be a TV reporter, you probably know they're
5772320	5774720	going to send you to the middle of a hurricane too, right?
5774720	5775520	Cause right, right.
5775520	5778920	When you turn on CNN or whatever it is you watch in one of those hurricanes,
5779000	5781440	there's always some poor reporter there that looks like they're about to blow
5781440	5784920	away, you know, because they, you got, you got to see it firsthand, right?
5785240	5787480	So anyway, yeah.
5787880	5791080	Um, SHO 100, Matt in chat says, exactly.
5791080	5794200	You kind of accept that risk and they kind of put that risk in front of you.
5794240	5794520	Yeah.
5794520	5796000	So it's, it's crazy stuff.
5796040	5796240	All right.
5796240	5797080	Anyway, sorry.
5797080	5798720	We're, we're a little far down the rabbit hole.
5798720	5800560	I want to move on, keep the show moving.
5800840	5801680	Uh, let's talk.
5801680	5803880	Well, what rabbit holes don't we go down?
5804680	5804960	Right.
5804960	5806240	Another intersect.
5806240	5810720	What other, uh, analogies do I have to call tangents on this show?
5811520	5812000	All right.
5812600	5813440	Uh, anyhow.
5813760	5814040	Yeah.
5814040	5818920	As that in chat says, you have to decide where your line is in safety and
5818920	5819640	mortality.
5820200	5820560	Okay.
5820560	5820800	Yeah.
5820800	5822080	Or, and morally, I'm sorry.
5822120	5822920	Safety and morally.
5823120	5824440	Y'all ready for another tangent?
5824640	5825080	Y'all ready?
5826160	5826840	I got one.
5827200	5827560	Okay.
5828480	5832080	So because Alan's been doing more streaming, sometimes I'll let him have the
5832080	5833120	office to himself.
5833440	5839160	And one thing, Hey Dan, one thing that I've been, one thing that I've been getting
5839200	5843720	into while I, he is doing streaming, I have started becoming that person that
5843720	5846360	really enjoys watching documentaries on Netflix.
5846880	5849000	Um, I watched a murder among the Mormons.
5849040	5849680	That was pretty good.
5850040	5856840	Uh, and I just watched the four part Jeffrey Epstein documentary, which there's
5856840	5863000	a lot I could say about that documentary and just how, how mad I just was, how
5863000	5868880	mad, anyway, that's not the tangent I want to take inhale, exhale, but part of
5868920	5873680	that documentary was that they had a pretty extensive interview with one of
5873680	5878240	the defense lawyers for Jeffrey Epstein, who of course is one of the well-known
5878400	5881440	gets paid a lot of fucking money because that's what he does.
5881800	5886080	And he talked about very frankly, in this documentary, when you agree to be a
5886080	5889000	defense lawyer, you are agreeing to these sorts of things.
5889280	5892000	You are out there looking for the best interest of your client and dah, dah, dah,
5892000	5892240	dah, dah.
5892440	5895360	And he said these in a very like matter of fact way.
5895960	5901120	And you know, and as that's comment made me think of this, um, the, the whole, uh,
5901240	5904080	you have to choose what you do ethically and morally, because I'm looking at this
5904080	5909800	guy going, this guy you're defending is an absolute total fucking piece of shit.
5910160	5911480	How are you okay with that?
5911880	5913400	How are you okay with that?
5914360	5917920	But every, everybody draws the line where they're okay with it.
5918880	5920480	Anyway, sorry.
5920760	5924520	I said no more tangents and then took a big one, but I had to get that off my
5924560	5925720	chat. You did it chat.
5925720	5926440	It's your fault.
5928320	5929480	It's chat's fault.
5929520	5932760	They say things and then they make me think things that I have to say in this
5932760	5933320	microphone.
5933960	5936360	All right, let's move on.
5936400	5937200	Oh, I have the next story.
5937200	5937480	Hurry.
5937920	5941320	Um, let's talk about Bamani.
5941520	5943320	We haven't done that on this show in a long time.
5943320	5946240	Let's talk about Bamani, um, because it's still going.
5946280	5949120	There are, of course, you know, we know there's new 2DX styles happening and
5949120	5949720	things like that.
5950000	5952400	And Bamani is entering an interesting new space.
5952760	5957560	Um, Konami is going to be releasing a new rhythm game in the Bamani series called
5957600	5958760	Beat Arena.
5959280	5961000	What makes this game special?
5961200	5964640	It is a Oculus Quest and Oculus 2 games.
5964640	5969240	So it is Konami's first VR music game.
5969560	5972560	Now, of course, VR music games have been done, right?
5972560	5973240	Beat Saber.
5973240	5973680	Hello.
5973680	5974600	We all know that one.
5974920	5978120	Um, Attica by Harmonix, pretty good.
5978160	5981080	I liked that one a lot too, and there's plenty of others as well.
5981240	5986080	So it is interesting, which unfortunately, I love tangent.
5987320	5992480	Having done this show for 18 years, we see Konami do this too often, right?
5992680	5994840	Like in case in point, Rock Revolution.
5995080	5998160	Oh, everybody else did the thing with the music game.
5998320	6000640	Guess we should finally show up to the party.
6001040	6002960	How fucking long has Beat Saber been out?
6003840	6006280	And just now Konami, oh, we're here.
6006720	6007800	Here's our product.
6008400	6009720	So Beat Arena is out.
6010040	6010840	But you know what?
6010880	6014880	Because Konami has its fans, because it is a Japanese made game.
6015080	6018680	And because of the fact it, it doesn't look like it's necessarily like a total,
6018680	6021800	like you're like in a band type of thing.
6021800	6023440	It doesn't look like it's just Beat Saber.
6023640	6026000	Like it does look like it's a little different and stuff.
6026000	6028560	You have like the notes that are flying at you.
6028560	6031600	And sometimes with the drums, it looks like you're hitting certain things.
6031800	6034440	So, but it does have a different style.
6034440	6035840	So I will give them that.
6036040	6042240	Like Rock Revolution was just like a knockoff of rock band success, even though,
6042240	6047760	yes, I completely realized and I will be the first to say Konami got to that table
6047760	6050680	first with Guitar Freaks and Drummania.
6050680	6051680	I almost said Guitar Hero.
6051840	6053600	Guitar Freaks and Drummania.
6054120	6057040	But they, they didn't do anything with it in the US.
6057240	6059240	And that was a missed opportunity, wasn't it?
6059920	6062400	And they, they, they fought to catch up for you.
6062400	6065640	They lost their own game because of it.
6066240	6071120	Anyway, so, so Beat Arena is now them entering the VR space.
6071120	6072680	I will say it does look kind of neat.
6072960	6075320	It is something I would enjoy to try out at some point.
6075840	6079280	You do get to pick guitar, bass, drums, or keyboards.
6079280	6079800	It is interesting.
6079800	6083280	It does kind of take that rock band thing, but it puts it in a VR space, which
6083280	6084160	is a little bit different.
6084640	6087880	And of course there are transplant songs from other Bimani titles.
6087880	6088760	So that's pretty cool.
6089040	6093760	So anyway, Oculus and Oculus Quest 2, it came out on March 12th.
6093760	6094520	So it's already out.
6094520	6095720	Maybe some of you have played it.
6095880	6096800	I'll check the chat in a minute.
6096800	6097840	See if any of you have comments.
6098080	6100920	Uh, Japanese and English, both available.
6100920	6101880	So that's pretty cool.
6102080	6105920	Um, right now though, they're saying it's only coming out in Japan and Asia.
6105920	6108960	They haven't said anything about a North American release.
6109280	6112760	I don't know why you would have English and then not.
6114080	6116240	But I, Konami does weird shit.
6116240	6116880	What can I say?
6118240	6118600	All right.
6118600	6121200	Anyhow, so that is Beat Arena.
6121800	6125680	And it's, it's nice to see Konami still doing Bimani home versions.
6126680	6129440	You want to go back to the earlier thing about, you know, the fan
6129440	6133560	wank idea of Sony doing more versions of Konami IPs.
6133800	6137520	You know, Konami or, uh, Sony's got a pretty good VR thing too.
6139480	6142600	They could do a version of this, but I doubt it'll happen.
6143360	6143760	All right.
6145320	6150800	Anyway, SSJ100Matt in chat says, Jason Enos could only do so much.
6150800	6152320	Konami didn't want to take that in that step.
6152520	6153960	Oh, I don't fault him.
6154200	6155760	I don't follow anybody in America.
6156760	6158760	He tried, he tried very hard.
6158960	6160800	He has, he was never the problem.
6161000	6165320	Nor was, um, there was a guy in Hawaii still wind.
6165360	6169120	There was a huge, and unfortunately he passed away some time ago, but, uh, he
6169120	6173800	was, he was a big reason why the ultra mix soundtracks on Xbox were so fucking
6173800	6179920	good was because of him and the risks he took with the series, they don't know
6179920	6182600	that word risk at Konami Japan, unfortunately.
6184560	6188680	At least they didn't a long time ago in the, I, well, I would say they
6188680	6189960	probably still don't know it, honestly.
6190280	6190680	All right.
6191720	6192120	Anyway.
6192760	6194200	Um, let's move on.
6194360	6195720	Let's go to a simpler time.
6195760	6199280	We're going to go, we're going to go back to a time when VR didn't exist.
6199280	6200360	You know what existed?
6200720	6202800	Bits and polygons.
6202840	6205200	It's the classic game of the week.
6205640	6206720	Early polygons.
6206760	6207000	Yes.
6207040	6210760	Early, early polygons for this week's title, which again, Dark Soccer, you're
6210760	6213600	so good at this, you picked a title where I'm like, how?
6213960	6216480	How has this never been a classic game?
6216720	6217320	How?
6217920	6219440	I asked myself the same thing.
6219480	6219920	I know.
6219920	6220280	I know.
6220280	6220960	So here you go.
6220960	6222000	Got you watch.
6222320	6222640	Ready?
6222640	6223080	Chat.
6223720	6225480	We're about to watch chat light up.
6225600	6227720	How, what, what this has never been picked before.
6227960	6228960	Here it is a classic game of the week.
6229160	6231560	Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she
6231560	6235880	thinks, Hey, you guys should, uh, show a little, put some respect on this title.
6236160	6237520	And, uh, it's a good one tonight.
6237520	6238120	Dark Soccer.
6238120	6239320	What is the classic game of the week?
6240280	6243480	The classic game of the week is Ridge Racer.
6244360	6245880	So yeah.
6245880	6247520	How have I not done Ridge Racer?
6247920	6250840	I actually was thinking, Oh, I'll do R4.
6250880	6253320	I've done Ridge Racer before, so I'll do R4.
6253840	6256200	No, I haven't done Ridge Racer.
6256520	6259480	So how can I do R4 if I haven't done Ridge Racer?
6260280	6267440	So, um, Ridge Racer came out in 1993 in Japan and North America and 94 in Europe.
6267600	6271120	Um, it is a, uh, racing video game.
6271520	6276160	It was published by Namco and it was on the Namco system, 22 arcade system board
6276520	6278920	and ported to PlayStation in 1994.
6278960	6281160	And it is the first in the series.
6281720	6288280	Um, and basically as a game, you just have to get first place, you know, you even
6288280	6290880	have like your qualifying, I think this one didn't have the qualifying lap.
6290960	6291960	I'll have to double check again.
6292520	6296840	But anyway, um, one little notable thing is that the PlayStation version
6296920	6301680	let you use the Nejicon, which I love playing games with freaking Nejicon.
6302600	6307240	Um, so at any rate, uh, it took eight months to develop.
6307800	6315440	Um, and, uh, the game is actually, uh, inspired by a, uh, a trend
6315520	6317800	amongst Japanese car enthusiasts.
6318440	6321040	Um, and of course, uh, with the PlayStation one, it was a
6321040	6322760	launch title for the PlayStation.
6323760	6329840	Um, it was also re-released, uh, in PlayStation, the best in 97 and, uh,
6329880	6333720	the greatest hits and platinum one for North America and PAL respectively.
6334320	6341640	And it really was, I think one of the games that gave it, uh, an edge over
6341680	6345240	the Saturn, at least in the U S also, of course, with how terribly the Saturn
6345240	6351160	was handled for U S marketing, there is that, um, not honestly, keep in mind,
6351280	6357160	I worked at an arcade that we had both of those and I would almost always play
6357200	6363320	Ridge Racer over Daytona because I got really tired of the splash for Daytona.
6363880	6364360	Anyway.
6365360	6372480	Um, it, it, it was, I'd say a pretty significant game also in the racing game
6372480	6379040	genre, um, just because of what it's led to, I mean, I'll get into some of that
6379040	6383880	down the line, but anyway, for gameplay, you choose a course, you choose a car,
6383880	6388800	you choose a transmission, it's either automatic or six speed, uh, six speed
6388800	6390080	manual, and you choose a song.
6390760	6393880	So, um, some of the cars have a good top speed.
6393880	6395840	Others have greater acceleration or turning.
6395840	6397200	Some are balanced.
6397960	6402240	Um, and then the car, some of the cars are named after different Namco games,
6402560	6408440	like Silverlou, Mappy, Bosconian, uh, Nebulas Ray and Xevious.
6409160	6415200	So you can play in first person perspective, um, or on the PlayStation
6415200	6417160	one, you can do a third person perspective.
6417680	6422440	Um, like I said, you can use the Nejicon on the, uh, the PlayStation.
6422440	6424520	And here I am doing like the Nejicon motion.
6425040	6430320	Um, and so, uh, there's, uh, no damage from collisions.
6430320	6431520	They just slow you down a little bit.
6431600	6432640	There's a time limit.
6432680	6433840	You have to hit your checkpoints.
6434480	6440480	Um, so each course, uh, has four configurations of difficulty, novice,
6440480	6442800	intermediate, advanced, and trial.
6443720	6450960	Um, you, uh, you have, uh, 11 opponents except in the time trial
6450960	6454440	where you have only one, the greater the difficulty, the faster the cars.
6454480	6456200	And of course, time trial is the fastest.
6456760	6460760	Um, each race has three laps or two on the beginner course.
6460760	6466240	And when the race is won, you win the reversible course, um, and then
6466240	6470800	additional, uh, opponent in the time trial, the 13th racing, also known
6470800	6472920	as the devil car, the fastest car.
6473800	6480480	Um, and, uh, you get like, um, you also have on the PlayStation, a
6480480	6484400	mini version of Galaxian that you can play, uh, as the game loads.
6485080	6490440	Um, if, if you win the game, then you get eight additional cars, the
6490440	6493360	little game of Galaxian, and then eight additional cars are available.
6494200	6499760	And then, um, but you also though lose extra tracks.
6499760	6501160	You can only play six music tracks.
6501160	6504040	It's kind, it's kind of interesting.
6504360	6508560	The, the, uh, the game is actually mostly loaded into system memory.
6509160	6511800	You know, so sorry, just, I don't mean to interrupt, but
6511800	6513200	it came up a couple of weeks ago.
6513200	6515280	I think a lot on Bobby's show and we brought it up too.
6515640	6519560	It's interesting that that whole Galaxian loading mini game thing is like a patented
6519560	6521240	thing that Namco had for a long time.
6521240	6524440	I think their patent finally expired on it, but I thought that was kind of
6524440	6527280	interesting that like, that's why you didn't really see that outside of
6527280	6530080	Namco games is that games within the game on the loading screen.
6530280	6531120	This was that patent.
6532080	6532360	Yeah.
6533680	6537400	I mean, it's not clearly, this is not the only game that they've done that in.
6537400	6545480	I mean, so, um, at, uh, the JAMA 1992 amusement, amusement machine show,
6545480	6548680	that's a Japan amusement machinery manufacturers association.
6549280	6555160	Um, in 1992, Namco actually debuted a game called SIM drive.
6555760	6560640	Um, that was also for the system 22, um, arcade board.
6561240	6565800	Um, it was a sequel to Eunice roadster driving simulator with the Mazda MX-5.
6565840	6567360	Um, that was the simulation game.
6567960	6572080	Um, but they did it in, um, in 3d.
6572120	6576040	They stood out for the Goron shading and texture mapping.
6576560	6579440	Um, and it was very positively reviewed.
6579520	6582080	Um, but it didn't get a mass market release.
6582080	6586240	It had a limited release in Japan and it pretty much is the prototype for Ridge racer.
6586880	6595560	Um, so basically the development team was sort of, uh, under this title
6595600	6600520	time limit to complete their game before their rivals, um, quote, the
6600520	6602600	other company was in the same position.
6603080	6608080	Um, and it was supposed to be an F1 racing game, but then they, they took
6608080	6614080	it to talking about the mountain roads and the drifting and all of that,
6614080	6617760	which was, uh, you know, basically a big trend still, I think to this
6617760	6619840	day for Japanese car enthusiasts.
6620480	6625240	Um, so they had a game that would let you test different skills and
6625880	6629120	experience different speeds and master your drifting.
6629240	6634440	Um, and they weren't really worried that it wouldn't be received outside of Japan.
6635120	6639080	Uh, they were pretty sure that it was going to be a success everywhere.
6640120	6648840	So, um, they basically, instead of choosing cars that were already to be done, uh,
6648840	6651360	they tried to make their own specific cars.
6651400	6655880	Um, they really liked using the Nejicon for the PlayStation, because it would
6655880	6658080	give you tighter control over your vehicle.
6658720	6662280	Uh, they were concerned about loading times for the CD, uh, ROM, but then
6662320	6665800	they fixed that by having it loaded into the PlayStation memories.
6665840	6668600	And that's where the Galaxian play come through.
6669440	6678320	Um, and, uh, the, uh, the designer Sakagami, he included Galaxian because
6678360	6684000	he was also part of the Galaxian arcade team and wanted to honor his previous boss.
6685120	6691760	So, um, and then of course the, uh, the 13th, uh, 13th racing, that car,
6692280	6696560	um, was supposed to be a black car that no one had ever driven before.
6696560	6698640	And its nickname was the cockroach.
6698640	6707720	So, um, moving forward, uh, with that also, um, arcade system board, uh,
6707760	6711440	Ridge Racer was considered to be the, well, according to Namco, the
6711440	6713280	most realistic driving game ever.
6713680	6718920	Um, it was, it was very, very well received.
6718960	6724320	Um, now in particular, this is a little anecdote.
6724320	6730920	I had to retest for my driver's license after I had, uh, graduated high school
6731200	6735720	because I had something limiting me from being able to renew it at the time.
6736480	6740280	And honestly, it was Ridge Racer that I did some practice with.
6740800	6746760	Um, you know, I was more practicing on, you know, just braking and going and,
6746760	6752040	you know, and so actually I can, I can attribute a lot of things to Ridge Racer.
6752040	6755600	Actually I can, I can attribute a little bit of Ridge Racer
6755640	6757800	to passing my driving exam.
6758640	6759400	Wow.
6759680	6763920	I would think that that's not a great thing to do, but wow.
6764080	6765080	You know, it's weird.
6765080	6767040	What works for people it's different sometimes.
6768000	6771240	Well, this is the game that taught me how to slow down when I'm turning a corner.
6772760	6773160	True.
6774000	6781080	You know, and the, the physics in it, weren't really that bad at all.
6781240	6785560	I'd even say they had some pretty, uh, pretty good physics in the game.
6785920	6787640	I'm going to the music now.
6787680	6795640	Um, it was produced by, uh, um, Shinji Hosoe, um, with also contributions
6795640	6798080	from Nobuyoshi Sano and Ayako Saso.
6798760	6804720	Um, but they didn't have enough time to produce the tracks independently.
6805360	6811480	Um, but they ended up producing kind of that, that sort of fast paced
6811480	6816320	electronica and they wanted it to convey a fun feeling while they play.
6816920	6820760	And then, um, you know, they wanted to put energy or speed into it.
6820760	6826560	So, um, the soundtrack actually ended up being, uh, released as part of Namco
6826560	6830480	games, sound express volume 11 by Victor entertainment, and it has
6830480	6832160	remixes of all of those themes in it.
6832760	6835880	So, yeah, like I said, this was very, very well received.
6836320	6842760	Um, the Japanese, uh, magazine game machine listed it, uh, as, uh, uh,
6843120	6847920	as their most successful upright arcade game of the year in December, 1993.
6848640	6854480	Um, it was, I mean, all across the board, it was just lauded.
6854560	6858680	Um, GamePro said the PlayStation version was quote, a mere carbon copy of the
6858680	6863480	original, um, um, they thought it was brilliant loading it into the Ram,
6863480	6866440	instead of having all these loading screens, you know, trying to
6866440	6867640	load the next track or whatnot.
6868280	6873760	Um, it, uh, EGM was really fond of the gameplay and the music.
6873880	6880920	Um, you know, they said that there were some, uh, some downsides, like there are
6880920	6885560	only, uh, this is from Maxima magazine, um, that there was only one track and it
6885600	6890680	lacked the, uh, crash sequences from Daytona and, but the quote on here, but
6890720	6897240	everything else in the title is sheer class, um, very smooth, very, very well
6897240	6904160	playing, um, so looking over, uh, their aggregate score from gang rank, uh,
6904440	6913240	gang rankings, they, uh, the PlayStation version had an 81% overall, um, and, uh,
6913400	6917120	EGM gave it best driving game, uh, in 1995.
6917680	6924040	So, um, let's talk about a little bit of what's become of Ridge Racers.
6924040	6929760	So it actually was listed as one of the best games of all time by Game Informer
6929760	6937080	in 2001 and by Yahoo in 2005 and EGM in 2006, uh, and the Guinness book
6937080	6939520	of world records in 2008 and 2009.
6940400	6943560	So that's pretty notable.
6944160	6949800	Um, and of course there were many sequels, uh, there were also different
6949800	6959440	kinds of other releases for the first Ridge Racer, um, it, there were, um,
6961040	6966200	there was Ridge Racer full scale, which I have seen one of, and I
6966200	6967680	do not remember where I saw it.
6968200	6977000	Um, it was basically in, uh, the adapted Eunos Roadster.
6977480	6980120	You, and a passenger could sit with you in the car.
6980120	6984200	It's a Japanese right hand drive version of a Mazda MX-5.
6984800	6989200	Um, and then you have the wheel, the shift, you have the pedals for your
6989200	6993320	controls, and then you use an ignition speed to start the gauges were all
6993320	6997520	functional and these fans fans would blow, uh, air past you.
6998120	7003240	Um, real, realistic engine sounds, uh, and overhead speakers will play the music.
7003240	7007760	The PCB was under the, uh, the hood of the car.
7008600	7015880	Um, there was also, um, uh, Ridge Racer three screen edition, which is
7015880	7019560	also one I've seen a couple of times use multiple system, 22 boards.
7020120	7023440	Um, and so it was the game that gave you peripheral vision.
7024000	7027280	Um, then it was pocket racer, which is an SD version.
7027760	7030520	Uh, the cars kind of resemble the core OQ models.
7031200	7035040	Um, and it was only available in an upright cabinet version
7035040	7036520	and use Namco system 11.
7036520	7038000	It was actually released for children.
7038560	7042600	Um, they actually included something very similar to it in Ridge Racer
7042600	7047120	revolution, um, using those same cars under the name, pretty racer.
7047640	7049080	Uh, also known as buggy mode.
7049760	7052680	It was, uh, Ridge Racer turbo.
7053360	7059720	Um, basically it was included in R4, which is the best Ridge Racer game ever.
7060240	7065440	Um, and, uh, it had an extra disc with it that contained a version of Ridge
7065440	7070880	Racer called Ridge Racers turbo in North America Ridge Racer high spec demo in
7070920	7077360	Europe, um, and, uh, in Japan, it was also called Ridge Racer high spec version.
7078040	7082640	Um, it had improved graphics, ran 60 frames per second or 50 in PAL.
7083200	7087600	Um, as opposed to the original 30, I had vibration feedback and would let you use
7087600	7092400	the, um, cause you know, R4 came with the jog con if you got that bundle.
7092920	7100040	Um, you, uh, you have, uh, the white angel from Ridge Racer revolution in it.
7100040	7102640	In addition to 13th racing as an unlockable car.
7103200	7109160	Um, and you have, uh, a time attack mode where you have, uh, you just beat your
7109160	7114200	time with no opponent cars where time trials does have, uh, uh, another car.
7114680	7116240	Then there's the mobile versions.
7116600	7122680	So, um, there were mobile phone versions released and, uh, criticized
7122720	7127240	as being easy to master, but pretty impressive for what it was.
7127840	7134120	Um, and then there was, uh, in 2005, there was Ridge Racer 3D for mobile phones.
7134640	7138440	Um, and then of course, yeah.
7138920	7143920	And then of course there was Ridge Racer 3D for the 3DS, but I want to say that
7143920	7146320	that was actually a different game.
7148440	7151000	Yeah, it was a different game, had a lot more modes.
7151720	7158840	Um, and, uh, actually that version was, uh, ported to the Zeebo.
7162400	7164200	You have, have you heard of the Zeebo?
7165240	7169840	Um, the name sounds familiar, but I'm, I can't, I'm trying to picture it and I can't.
7170080	7176280	It was targeted mostly to Brazil and Mexico, um, as a, an interactive,
7176280	7179880	uh, entertainment and education device.
7179920	7180640	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7181880	7182240	Yeah.
7182320	7185760	So, um, but yeah, there was a version of Ridge Racer on that.
7187280	7189960	But there hasn't been one in a long time and that's kind of sad.
7191280	7191680	Yeah.
7192120	7196480	And, uh, at DEFT, it's called the Zeebo, Z-E-E-E-O.
7196800	7202840	It was in 2009 that they tried to release it or that they did release the game.
7205320	7205760	All right.
7205840	7214400	So, um, so yeah, uh, anyway, Ridge Racer, that's the one, uh, and now
7214400	7217240	I have the, the opening song from R4.
7217240	7223560	I mean, cause now it's also given us like one of our notable, um, uh,
7223600	7233000	mascots, um, uh, Reiko, who's become a, uh, you know, a definite, uh, face
7233000	7240240	for the, you know, the various, uh, uh, racing, uh, for the various, uh,
7241000	7244080	gosh, why can't I say the words for various Ridge Racer games?
7244120	7244360	Yeah.
7245000	7254000	So, um, you know, and honestly, it's so funny, like someone actually
7254000	7260160	redid the R4 opening and, uh, it doesn't quite look right.
7260160	7263600	Um, they tried to, you know, make it a little bit more upscale.
7264320	7270840	Um, but, uh, like for just a moment though, I'm trying to remember her
7271600	7274640	family name and I, my brain is blanking.
7274920	7275400	That's all right.
7277040	7277400	All right.
7278000	7279760	Nagase.
7281120	7281440	All right.
7282200	7286360	We should use the virtual idol and she's actually, um, been
7286400	7288400	used now in other things too.
7288720	7291360	So, and she has a sister in another game.
7293680	7295480	The whole big Namco family.
7296480	7302040	Yeah, she was used in, um, Anna Kournikova, smash court tennis and
7302520	7308400	professional baseball Famitsu, uh, Famista and Fantasia, Nari-kiri
7308400	7310240	Dungeon, Taiko no Tatsujin V.
7310240	7314480	She's a summon character or five, I should say, or V version, whatever.
7314800	7315120	Anyway.
7315840	7316240	All right.
7316920	7317560	Well, there it is.
7317600	7322280	Your classic game of the week Ridge Racer, which again, I don't know how
7322280	7325160	we've never talked about Ridge Racer on this show before, I mean, we've
7325160	7328480	talked about Ridge Racer, but not in the segment meant to talk about
7328480	7332880	great classic games, so I'm glad we took care of that on Pi Day.
7333440	7337920	So, uh, looking at chat over twitch.tv slash vlog network, DJ Rama S says,
7337920	7339320	now I want to play Ridge Racer.
7339320	7340240	Well, you, you know what?
7340240	7341440	That's a good way to spend Pi Day.
7342240	7343640	Have some Pi, play some Ridge Racer.
7344000	7345720	We still have our copy of Ridge Racer.
7346720	7347280	All right.
7347640	7351160	We're going to, uh, travel around and check out some rapid fire news.
7351160	7354240	Now, just a couple of quick headlines for you guys, starting with Loki.
7355200	7355840	Yes.
7355840	7359000	So we've been talking for a few weeks on how super Nintendo
7359000	7361440	world has been delayed in Japan.
7361440	7364480	Well, now it's going to be opening March 18th.
7364480	7365000	That's right.
7365000	7370200	This week in Japan, it will be open of course, with, um, you know, certain
7370200	7374840	guidelines, they're just, you know, trying to stay safe, but, uh, it is
7374840	7377960	finally open, so that's, that's exciting.
7378680	7381400	Um, uh, just a quick related tangent.
7381440	7382480	Cause I love those tonight.
7382720	7386280	Uh, Aria snark over from shaking and crying was actually at universal
7386280	7392520	studios, uh, yesterday, I think the one in, um, uh, I almost said Anaheim.
7392520	7393080	That's not true.
7393080	7393920	Actual Hollywood.
7393920	7395200	So universal studios, Hollywood.
7395560	7398280	Um, and she went in a, I thought this was very clever.
7398280	7401640	She went in a Bellatrix, uh, cosplay that had a mask.
7402000	7404360	So she actually had like a mass of tied in and she looked great.
7404400	7407960	Um, but anyway, uh, she said the point, oh, she's very crafty.
7407960	7413320	She sent a picture of, so she texted me a picture of Nintendo world in
7413320	7415800	progress at universal studios, Hollywood.
7415800	7418520	And you can see they have some of the green like scenery stuff up.
7418760	7421800	It's it's down in the lower lot area for those that have been there.
7422000	7424120	I, when I sent the picture, I was like, isn't that right where the
7424120	7428240	transformers ride is, but I guess my sense of direction is off, but you
7428240	7431680	can see like right in the foreground, the, I guess now Jurassic world ride.
7431680	7433160	Last time I was on, it was Jurassic park.
7433400	7434000	Is right there.
7434000	7437240	And then the Nintendo land looks like it's just a couple of steps past that.
7437480	7439920	So it's interesting kind of seeing the construction on that.
7439920	7444440	So I assume Hollywood's probably going to be next, uh, whenever they get around to it.
7444440	7445760	It might beat Orlando to it.
7446640	7449240	Yeah, I think it's maybe next year.
7450480	7451560	Yeah, maybe later this year.
7451560	7452040	Who knows?
7452200	7455400	Uh, Bobby Blackwell says super Nintendo world has been open for a while though.
7455560	7461960	Uh, they, they, um, they, uh, they had, uh, the, the press tour and they had
7462920	7465520	those events like where Miyamoto was going through it and they had a couple
7465520	7470120	of press events, but they had to delay the official opening because
7470120	7471880	the COVID numbers went back up.
7472040	7474960	I don't know if they did a soft opening or something, but this is
7474960	7476800	now the official official opening.
7477000	7478480	Um, but they, they had to delay it again.
7478480	7480160	Cause COVID started going back up in Japan.
7481800	7482200	All right.
7483360	7484000	Uh, yeah.
7484000	7486480	And a couple of people in chatter saying, uh, super Nintendo
7486480	7489040	world Orlando is slated for 2025.
7489240	7489480	Yeah.
7489480	7492520	I thought theirs was going to, it's, it's this weird thing where Hollywood's
7492520	7495240	actually going to get it before Orlando, which doesn't usually happen.
7495240	7496360	So hooray, I guess.
7496960	7497280	All right.
7497280	7501080	And speaking of, speaking of delays though, uh, we have the next expansion
7501080	7507720	to Borderlands three has now been delayed to April 8th and that's, uh, thankfully,
7507760	7512200	well, I should say you can thank that, uh, Texas snow storm for that.
7512720	7518360	Um, because of all the outages that they've had to, um, endure there.
7518360	7519720	So that's put them behind.
7519880	7520400	Okay.
7520440	7525040	But that's understandable, you know, as opposed to, uh, what we talked about
7525040	7528600	earlier, an actual, that's what a normal gaming company, like, sorry,
7528600	7530040	our product's gonna take longer or not.
7530080	7532840	You got to come in and, uh, hope you don't die on the way here.
7533080	7534520	Yeah, much better.
7535120	7535400	All right.
7535400	7535840	Dark soccer.
7535840	7536240	How about you?
7537600	7543160	Way yell, um, crash bandicoot four it's about time is coming, uh, to
7543160	7545920	the PC in a couple of weeks.
7546000	7551720	Um, it was on PS five X-Box series, uh, X S and switch
7551760	7554200	actually came out, uh, on the 12th.
7554760	7558240	Um, but it's coming to battle on it on March 26th.
7558560	7562800	So if you like crash, good for you, you can play it on your PC.
7563760	7569840	And then super Mario three D world, uh, Bowser's fury is considered the best
7569840	7574920	selling game during February, 2021 and kept the switch on top of everything.
7574920	7580000	So yes, Mario games sell, uh, sell their hardware sales increased.
7580520	7585840	Um, 121% um, over the year.
7585840	7589760	So they're up to 406 million dollars.
7590920	7591400	Wow.
7592120	7592480	Yeah.
7592640	7596200	I mean, that's the one thing that goes against a switch pro.
7596720	7598240	Why do they need a switch pro?
7598520	7599960	The one they got still selling.
7600920	7604280	Yes, but you know, the moment a switch pro comes out, they're going
7604280	7605600	to be selling even more of them.
7605640	7605920	Yeah.
7605960	7609040	But I'm like, you know, I was talking about with bravely default two earlier,
7609040	7612080	and I'm sure a lot of these other games that are coming, it's just like the
7612080	7615880	switch is getting to a point where it can't handle or the game makers want to go.
7615920	7620440	So I really hope the switch pro is in the cards for that reason, because, you
7620440	7623800	know, the switch might be hot right now, but without the games to keep it going,
7623800	7625920	it's going to, uh, going to falter off.
7625920	7628480	But of course we all know breath of the wild too is going to happen at some point.
7628480	7631520	You know, Nintendo has some aces up their sleeve for sure.
7631520	7631960	For sure.
7632400	7633800	I can't wait for breath of the wild too.
7633840	7635240	Oh, I get in line.
7636120	7639560	I want there to be more korok hunting so you can keep collecting their poop.
7640880	7641360	All right.
7641720	7643000	Uh, let's move on.
7643000	7647960	Let's get to, uh, our next, uh, world release dates segment here.
7647960	7650520	So, uh, Loki, let's talk about some things coming out a little sooner.

7759040	7762960	Let's go over to Japan and check out, uh, some of the releases over there.
7762960	7768400	So, um, coming out on the Nintendo switch switch, Jack Jan, uh, is out,
7768400	7771840	uh, in Japan on the Nintendo switch, regular and limited edition, uh, the
7771840	7776000	legend of heroes trails of cold steel four, which I heard in the U S States
7776000	7777600	is also out in Japan this week.
7777600	7782400	We also have Maglam Lord, uh, and then go by train hashiro.
7782400	7786400	Yamanote lean, uh, is out this week, by the way, speaking of train games.
7787680	7788320	Wait, what?
7789760	7791600	Go by train hashiro.
7791600	7792240	Yama note.
7792240	7792640	I'm sorry.
7792640	7793680	I misread the word line.
7793680	7794800	It's just line.
7794800	7797840	Um, Yamanote.
7797840	7798340	Uh huh.
7799200	7799680	Okay.
7799680	7800400	Okay.
7800480	7805760	So anyway, um, so the train game in Japan, um, I, I said, why don't they
7805760	7806960	ever bring those over here?
7806960	7811280	They, that a train game I talked about last week, they are bringing over here.
7811280	7812320	Just a heads up.
7812320	7815840	I, it surprised me too, but they are bringing out an English version of that
7815840	7816320	over here.
7816320	7819280	I can't remember if it already came out or if it's coming out, but, uh, I
7819280	7822160	thought that was important to follow up with is that they are experimenting
7822160	7823520	and bringing some more of those games over here.
7823520	7824320	And I think that's kind of neat.
7824880	7828800	Uh, anyway, sorry, uh, distracted, but, um, that's happened to me a lot tonight.
7828800	7833920	Also out on the switch, uh, apex legends in Japan gets its switch release.
7833920	7835200	So check that out.
7835200	7841840	Um, and then going over to the PlayStation, of course, I closed my list
7841840	7842160	here.
7842160	7845040	So, um, dark soccer, why don't we go over to the UK real quick and then
7845040	7845600	we'll come back.
7846560	7846880	Okay.
7847440	7853600	So on the 16th, uh, for switch kingdoms of Amalur re reckoning on the 18th, we
7853600	7858560	have Marvel's Avengers for PlayStation hunting simulator two for PlayStation
7858560	7862880	on the 19th, we have plants versus zombies battle for the neighborville
7862880	7864720	complete edition on switch.
7865280	7868880	Also on switches, Hades limited edition on PlayStation.
7868880	7871680	We have can't drive this now.
7871680	7872240	Now can't touch.
7872240	7874720	This is going through my head on the 19th.
7874720	7877280	We have for switching PlayStation root film.
7877920	7882080	Um, also in the 19th, bow Babs mausoleum on switch.
7882080	7883280	And that is it.
7883840	7884240	Okay.
7884240	7886000	And I'm back on track to finish Japan.
7886000	7886480	Sorry about that.
7886480	7887360	Screw up on my part.
7887520	7892640	Uh, for the PlayStation five, we have, uh, Tom Clancy's rainbow six siege gets
7892640	7894240	its Japanese version this week.
7894240	7898000	That's again on the PlayStation five and on the PlayStation four, that Maglam
7898000	7901760	Lord game is also coming out, uh, this week on the 18th.
7901760	7904080	So those are the Japanese releases.
7904080	7904720	All right.
7904720	7906560	Let's get to some more stories.
7906560	7906960	Loki.
7910080	7910720	All right.
7910720	7916000	Uh, so this is very interesting, I should say.
7916000	7921280	So already like I FIFA ultimate team's been kind of shady as it is, you know,
7921280	7925040	with the whole loot box scenario with that, but now EA is actually
7925040	7930320	investigating claims that an employee has been selling rare items.
7930320	7935840	So being that they're working for the company, they got access to special
7935840	7939520	items that they're then pawning off, uh, for large sums of money.
7940320	7947600	So apparently this is coming from, um, you know, some, I don't know if it's
7947600	7951200	like from forums or whatnot, but basically saying, you know, showing
7951200	7953520	that there's all these items that are up for sale.
7953520	7956880	Like there's this, uh, post that was on Twitter saying, so we grind
7956880	7958160	trade open packs.
7958160	7962800	We can't touch these PIM players, but EA employees sell them to people
7962800	7964400	secretly for $1,700.
7965440	7966080	LOL.
7966080	7967760	I respect the grind, but my God.
7968560	7976400	So because this got, um, kind of exposed on social media under this EA
7976400	7983120	gate, um, hashtag these complaints that these different, um, FIFA icon or
7983120	7987520	prime icon moment players are there being sold for over a thousand dollars.
7988320	7992880	They're now doing some investigation to see doing that.
7992880	7996000	And you know, how, how this is happening.
7996080	7999760	And of course, FIFA put out a statement saying that we want to be clear.
7999760	8001440	This type of behavior is unacceptable.
8001440	8005520	And we, in no way could don't was alleged to have happened here.
8005520	8008960	We understand how this can create concern of unfair balance in the gaming
8008960	8009600	competition.
8010320	8016320	Um, yeah, but it's also shitty that you're selling these things in the
8016320	8018880	first place, but whatever.
8020080	8023600	I'm kind of surprised it took this long for a story like this to come out.
8023600	8024240	You know what I mean?
8025200	8027120	Uh, yeah, I completely agree.
8027120	8032960	I'm surprised that it's just now that we're seeing this, but I don't know.
8032960	8037120	I mean, not, not that it's good news, but in this age of like digital goods
8037120	8040720	being worth so much, I'm just kind of surprised nobody's tried to take
8040720	8045040	advantage of the system before, or at least I'm not recalling if it has
8045040	8046240	happened before.
8046240	8047200	So interesting.
8048960	8049600	Yeah.
8049600	8050160	All right.
8050160	8051680	So interesting.
8051680	8055360	Almost like that guy I heard on the news here that was stealing stuff out
8055360	8058080	of the Amazon warehouse while he was working there and then reselling it.
8059280	8062480	Unfortunately, crime crime happens even in the digital space.
8062480	8063120	That's for sure.
8063840	8064240	All right.
8064880	8068720	Let's talk about Pokemon go since I talk about that game a lot, but this
8068720	8072000	is interesting because you have one of the biggest mobile games out there
8072000	8074160	that's, uh, testing a pretty big change.
8074160	8079200	And that is being able to preview what might be in the eggs that you are
8079200	8083520	hatching because, uh, eggs are, I don't know, eggs are kind of like loot
8083520	8086960	boxes, but they're also not because they, you know, eggs drop everywhere.
8088160	8088400	Yeah.
8088400	8090480	It's the incubators that cost money.
8090480	8094960	And then you have to decide which you, although you do have the one, uh,
8094960	8098160	infinite incubator, but you know, that's not enough for some people.
8098160	8102160	Cause of course the game lets you hold nine eggs, but one, one eternal
8102160	8102720	incubator.
8102720	8106080	So if you want to have them all going at once, you got to buy some more or,
8106080	8108400	you know, sometimes they give away little freebies.
8108400	8111920	You know, there's a lot of, a lot of if thens and so forth, but, um, there's
8111920	8115680	been a call to really like be more transparent with the odds.
8115680	8116800	Although a lot of.
8117680	8121520	Like Reddit has the silph road Reddit, which is extremely helpful for
8121520	8123040	players of Pokemon go.
8123040	8126320	Um, and they do these big tests where they have a lot of people report
8126320	8128560	numbers and they kind of figure it out.
8128560	8131760	Like they figure out that like, this is the, this is the percentage of, uh,
8131760	8135200	what's in 5k eggs and this is what's in two case, but it looks like Niantic
8135200	8136640	is going to be a bit more transparent with that.
8136640	8139680	You won't have to wait for the silph road to do their experiments anymore.
8139680	8145600	So in some tweets, uh, from Niantic help, they have said that, uh, trainers
8145600	8148800	were excited to share that we're starting testing with a limited number
8148800	8152960	of trainers who will be able to see which Pokemon may hatch from eggs in
8152960	8154400	their inventory.
8154400	8159040	Um, it's not going to show you though, if a Pokemon is a shiny, it doesn't
8159040	8160240	show you odds on that.
8160240	8164720	Sorry, Shane, but it does show you the odds on what might actually be in it,
8164720	8168320	but you know what it doesn't let you do and what needs to happen.
8168320	8170880	It doesn't let you send an egg to the shredder.
8171600	8173200	That's been a big problem with the game.
8173200	8176080	If you have nine eggs and you don't want to hatch one of them, cause it
8176080	8177520	doesn't have what you want in it.
8177520	8180960	You can't send it to the omelet factory or whatever you want to do with the
8180960	8181280	egg.
8181280	8183040	You can't get it to go.
8183040	8183360	Oops.
8183360	8184480	I dropped it on the ground.
8184480	8185520	No, you cracked open.
8185520	8186720	No, you can't do that.
8186720	8191120	It's a, they, they did try to improve it a little bit where like the really
8191120	8195280	valuable eggs, the 12 K eggs and the ones that you get from adventure sync
8195280	8197360	and stuff, they go to like a holding.
8197360	8200800	They go to like an extra inventory where you can hold three more eggs, but
8200800	8202080	only those kinds of eggs.
8202720	8204880	It's, it's a little bit convoluted.
8204880	8208560	I just don't understand why you can't delete eggs, but it is what it is.
8208560	8213200	Um, anyway, uh, you will actually, apparently if you are in Germany or
8213200	8217920	Belgium, you can actually, I'm sorry, Germany and Belgium pass the laws that
8217920	8220640	they are, uh, kind of responding to here.
8220640	8225040	I don't know exactly where the trainers are that they can see these features
8225040	8227840	yet, but I'm sure it'll start to spread out more and more.
8227840	8231040	A lot of this stuff usually gets tested in places like Australia.
8231040	8233840	New Zealand is almost always Niantic's testing zone.
8233840	8235040	Um, but we'll see.
8235600	8235840	So.
8237600	8244480	Anyway, it should be noted that, uh, a Dutch court fined EA 10 million euros
8244480	8247040	over FIFA ultimate team packs.
8247040	8251120	And that, uh, was after a ban on loot boxes by the Dutch, uh, gambling
8251120	8252960	authority in 2018.
8252960	8259040	So these, uh, loot boxes are, um, uh, maybe going to be regulated to a thing
8259040	8259600	of the past.
8259600	8260240	We'll see.
8260240	8263680	And even though eggs aren't quite loot boxes, I just think Niantic doesn't
8263680	8264960	want to get caught up in that.
8264960	8269440	And honestly, people figure it out anyway, because it's self road.
8269440	8270960	So they might as well be transparent.
8271600	8275440	Uh, Shane is in chat and says, I gave up on eggs to be honest.
8275440	8277120	They never end up worth it.
8277120	8281600	And they hype up like the Pokemon that make a 1% hatch chance every event.
8281600	8282480	So why care?
8283040	8286560	You know, and that's maybe one reason they're also responding to it was that
8286560	8291280	whole issue with, was it denial or something that was in, uh, the eggs that
8291280	8293120	like wasn't showing up.
8293120	8297200	Even though his picture was all over the event and people were getting really
8297200	8297760	frustrated.
8297760	8299600	So maybe they're trying to be more transparent about that.
8299600	8300000	I don't know.
8300560	8300880	Anyway.
8301920	8303040	Um, let's see.
8303040	8308320	Um, as 200, Matt says, sending Pokemon to the professor equals a nice farm up
8308320	8310000	state where they can be free.
8310000	8310400	Nope.
8310400	8311600	Poke blender.
8311600	8313840	Where do you think, where do you think your candy comes from?
8313840	8317280	Uh, anyway, let's move on.
8317280	8318320	Uh, dark soccer.
8320400	8325280	So, uh, a game that I've absolutely made no, no secret that I love.
8325280	8327040	And I know that you love it too, Robin.
8327040	8328560	Look, I don't know if you played it.
8328560	8330640	Um, was everybody's gone to the rapture.
8331520	8333200	Well, um, I, I streamed it.
8333840	8334480	Oh, cool.
8334480	8334640	Yeah.
8334640	8335120	I remember that.
8335120	8335440	That's right.
8335440	8335760	That's right.
8336640	8337040	Yeah.
8337040	8341920	So it is basically a single player narrative game.
8341920	8349760	Um, so, uh, the, uh, the designer, um, of the game, Andrew Crenshaw, uh, he
8349760	8354080	was the lead designer for everybody's gone to the rapture is doing another
8354080	8357040	game called the magnificent truffle pigs.
8358000	8362960	And you basically go through the British countryside, looking for buried
8363440	8367040	treasure with a metal detector and you dig around and the only other person
8367040	8370400	you have to talk to is somebody on the other end of a walkie talkie.
8370960	8376800	Um, her name is Beth, uh, voiced by, uh, Lucy fish from safe house and another
8376800	8377200	Eden.
8377840	8384480	Um, but you, uh, but you have, you're trying to help her find things as well.
8384880	8389440	So it's definitely that narrative type of game.
8389440	8394880	Um, you know, they say it also has a little bit of, uh, a relation to fire
8394880	8400160	watch with just that, that calm aspect of it, the, the communicator aspect.
8400160	8401680	And I loved fire watch as well.
8401680	8402640	Firewatch was great.
8403440	8409440	So, um, this is actually the first game being released for Crenshaw's, uh,
8409520	8417040	studio thunked T H U N K apostrophe D backed by AMC games, um, which is a
8417040	8420480	video game publisher, um, for AMC networks.
8421360	8424560	Is that unfortunately, I think the company that made everybody's gone to
8424560	8426800	rapture developed, I don't think they're around anymore.
8426800	8427440	Don't quote me on that.
8427440	8429360	I might be confusing my companies too.
8429360	8431280	That's why I specified it was.
8431280	8432240	No, no, no, I know.
8432240	8434160	I know, but I just, that's why.
8434160	8434660	Yeah.
8435620	8442420	So, so, well, it definitely looks like this, the type of game I'd be into
8442420	8445460	playing, I thought that everybody's gone to the rapture was brilliant and
8445460	8446820	I'm looking for, for more.
8447380	8447700	Yeah.
8447700	8450580	I'll definitely check this game out too, just based on who's behind it for
8450580	8450900	sure.
8450900	8453780	Cause I really enjoyed, you know, all those games you mentioned, everybody's
8453780	8455060	gone to the rapture firewatch.
8455060	8455700	It's all good stuff.
8456500	8456820	All right.
8457700	8458020	All right.
8458020	8461700	Let's go just a few more stories to go and then we'll, uh, open it up to chat
8461700	8464260	to see if they have any questions in chat and see if we have any email
8464260	8464580	tonight.
8464580	8467540	Although sadly, I don't think we do, but, um, maybe I missed one.
8467540	8469540	Uh, anyway, so Loki, what do you have for us?
8470820	8478740	So DeNovo is, um, offering their anti-cheat middleware to, uh, PlayStation
8478740	8483540	five, because yes, that's what everybody's been asking for to be in their
8483540	8484260	games.
8484260	8486660	They, everyone loves DeNovo, right?
8486660	8491220	You know, on PC, no one ever complains that it breaks everything and just is
8491220	8492740	completely useless.
8492820	8498100	But yes, let's bring that and that anti-cheat, uh, technology to the
8498100	8499060	PlayStation five.
8500020	8501780	So it's not popular.
8501780	8502740	That's for sure.
8502740	8508740	Um, it's definitely, I hope it's better than their anti tamper software, but
8508740	8512740	it is something that they're allowing, you know, folks to license, to be able
8512740	8515940	to use in their PlayStation five titles.
8515940	8521860	Um, good luck with that because if your game has a stink of DeNovo on it, then
8522740	8524900	I don't know, you're going to be hurting.
8524900	8530580	I think the best part that sums us up, there was a comment on this story and
8530580	8532740	it's like, perfect.
8532740	8537540	It's we'd let, and you know, the quote is we'd like more PC experiences on
8537540	8539940	consoles, monkey paw activated.
8542500	8545780	I thought, I thought that was funny, but yeah, DeNovo sucks.
8546580	8547460	Uh, yeah.
8547460	8552100	And, um, I do, are they trying to do this because maybe they think like they
8552100	8554580	can be a little more transparent hidden with it.
8554580	8556820	If it's on PlayStation, like they don't have to advertise it.
8556820	8558100	It has DeNovo in it.
8558100	8560820	So maybe they kind of think it'll like sneak in there and maybe people won't
8560820	8561140	notice.
8562500	8566580	Um, well, apparently they haven't been too transparent with it because DeNovo
8566580	8570500	has already said that some PlayStation five games are already utilizing
8570500	8575220	anti-cheat through DeNovo, but they won't say which ones because of the stink
8575220	8578020	of DeNovo and that will cause people not to want to play those games.
8578580	8582340	Um, so chances are you already have it and you just don't know.
8583380	8583700	Yeah.
8583700	8587460	So don't they have tests for that?
8588900	8590420	Not for the, not for this one.
8590420	8591780	There's no DeNovo test.
8594100	8595220	So unfortunately not.
8595220	8600580	So, uh, yeah, there's another strike against PlayStation five, I guess for
8600580	8601300	now.
8601300	8602260	All right.
8602340	8606820	And, uh, our last story on record tonight is, uh, about the Game Boy
8606820	8607380	Advance.
8607860	8609380	Uh, yes, an old system.
8609380	8610020	Yeah.
8610020	8612820	Um, do you remember how they had those video cartridges for Game Boy
8612820	8613300	Advance?
8613300	8615940	Not the 3D, 3D thing that was later.
8615940	8618740	Although I don't even think they ever actually really did that except maybe
8618740	8620660	like dinosaur office and the things you can download.
8620660	8621540	But do you remember the Game Boy?
8621540	8622500	They had the Tekken movie.
8623220	8624900	Did they have the Tekken movie on Game Boy carts?
8625540	8627460	They had the Tekken movie on the 3DS.
8627460	8628660	It was in 3D.
8628660	8630820	Well, the Game Boy Advance cards, they were a lot smaller.
8630820	8633540	They could only hold about 20, 30 minutes of video.
8633540	8637220	So they had like SpongeBob episodes, uh, and like Pokemon episodes.
8637220	8639300	That was the type of stuff you got on Game Boy Advance cards.
8639300	8643540	It was very much a shut up while we're trying to drive somewhere type of
8643540	8646100	thing, entertain the kids in the back seat type of thing.
8646100	8649700	Since not everybody has a television installed in their car, at least not
8649700	8651620	back when the Game Boy Advance was a thing.
8651620	8658820	Well, somebody, because they can, decided to put Tenet on a Game Boy
8658820	8659300	Advance cards.
8659380	8659620	That's right.
8659620	8663220	The Christopher Nolan movie Tenet, which, and why did he do this?
8663220	8666980	Because Christopher Nolan said you have to enjoy it in cinema, even though
8666980	8668420	there's a pandemic going on right now.
8669060	8672260	This is a film whose image and sound really needs to be enjoyed in your
8672260	8674100	theaters on the big screen.
8674100	8679940	So YouTube, YouTuber Bob Wolf decided, fuck that, and put it on the Game Boy
8679940	8680580	Advance.
8680580	8683780	Loki, you went, you went and saw Tenet during that like gap where the
8683780	8684740	theaters open, right?
8684740	8688420	So I did, yeah, I did see it in the cinema and their sound balancing is
8688420	8690420	just crap in that movie.
8690420	8692100	Like it, it's just awful.
8693060	8693860	Awful, awful.
8697860	8703140	So, so in the, in a similarity to the world of, you know, three and a half
8703140	8709780	inch floppy disks, this movie is spread across five cartridges because of
8709780	8711300	the limits of what it will hold.
8712260	8716340	The guy made custom labels for it, which I think is really funny, but then
8716340	8721460	to actually get the movie to fit on the cartridges, the resolution is down
8721460	8725300	to 192 by 128.
8725940	8730580	That 128p power, six frames a second.
8731620	8739060	So not, not 60, six and a whopping eight kilobyte bit rate.
8739060	8744100	So it's, it's like watching real video, um, of a movie.
8745060	8747860	If you want to throw it back a little bit, it's basically what you're looking
8747860	8748580	at there.
8748580	8752740	Uh, so it's definitely not IMAX, uh, definitely not the way, uh, the director
8752740	8754020	wanted you to see it.
8754020	8757380	Uh, and no, no word on how it sounded, although I'm sure it was kind of
8757380	8758340	garbage.
8758340	8760340	So, um, there you go.
8760340	8763460	If you want to check out the YouTubes on it again, the YouTuber's name is Bob
8763460	8766100	Wolf, W-U-L-F-F.
8766100	8769380	And I do, I do applaud the idea of doing things.
8769380	8770260	Why not?
8770260	8773220	Just because I get, because this guy said it's the only way to watch it.
8773300	8775860	Uh-uh, I'm going to do it my own way.
8775860	8780020	Now we need to have the AI upscale that, bringing it up to 60 FPS as well.
8781380	8785300	What, what horrible abomination that becomes.
8785300	8788980	I want to, I want a Game Boy Advance cartridge of OLR clips.
8788980	8793140	Obviously we can't, but a whole show of OLR would take like eight cartridges,
8793140	8798020	but we can put clips together on a cartridge, go through the Twitch library
8798020	8800660	and have OLR clips on a Game Boy Advance cartridge.
8800660	8801780	I like that idea.
8802340	8806820	Anyway, uh, Orange Right points out, hey, they did actually put Shrek and
8806820	8809300	Shark Tale on one Game Boy Advance cartridge.
8809300	8811140	Very much compressed.
8811140	8812100	Yeah, I bet.
8812100	8812900	I bet.
8812900	8816820	Uh, DJ Roma asks, uh, is real media still a thing?
8817700	8818500	That's a good question.
8818500	8820100	I would assume they got bought or something.
8821220	8823380	I think they've been gone for an age.
8823380	8824180	I think so too.
8824820	8829220	Um, uh, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I have a home theater and I just want
8829220	8830580	to watch it on a Game Boy Advance.
8831860	8835940	Uh, Sia Tabiri suggests they should reshoot it on a Game Boy camera.
8836500	8837540	Oh, I like that idea.
8839940	8841620	Making movies on a Game Boy camera.
8841620	8842340	Brilliant.
8842340	8842740	All right.
8843780	8846980	That's it for all of the stories we had, uh, slotted tonight.
8846980	8849380	However, we do want to open it up to the listener round table.
8849380	8854180	If you guys have any questions or comments in chat over at twitch.tv
8854180	8858020	slash vog network, that's twitch.tv slash VOG network.
8858020	8860900	Um, then you guys can ask questions away there.
8860900	8864660	We would also during this point of the show, check on our emails every week.
8864660	8870420	You guys maybe send us emails to participate at orange lounge, radio.com.
8870420	8871940	And we read our favorites on air.
8871940	8873140	However, unfortunately.
8873700	8874420	You failed us.
8874420	8877620	You did not send us any emails this week, so I can ask Rob.
8877620	8877860	Yes.
8877860	8880980	I can ask dark soccer about drag race, even though I've barely been watching.
8881700	8882820	I caught up.
8882820	8883700	Um, oh, did you?
8884500	8885140	Yeah, I don't.
8885140	8886100	Did you see the last episode?
8886100	8887140	Cause I don't want to spoil it.
8887140	8890740	I well, don't spoil it for the listeners anyway, but I am aware of what happened.
8891460	8892500	I'm pissed.
8892500	8892740	Yeah.
8893940	8898340	A lot of people are saying, I still think the winner has been obvious since the very first
8898340	8899300	episode.
8899300	8902740	Um, but I don't, I don't think it is.
8902740	8903620	I think it's Simone.
8903620	8907380	I think it's got Nick, but I think, I think that is the final two for sure.
8907380	8909620	I think it's Simone and got make it the final two for sure.
8910260	8911060	So who knows?
8911060	8915300	I'm actually really happy with Simone, but I think that got Nick has.
8916580	8918020	A different kind of artistry.
8918580	8919080	Mm hmm.
8919620	8926980	And, uh, I mean, I actually thought that got Nick and, uh, candy should have won the, uh,
8928020	8928980	the, the challenge.
8929780	8933940	Um, so speaking of like video games, I can actually tie a drag race to video games.
8933940	8939620	I actually retweeted Simone dressed up as, uh, Jesse from team rocket.
8939620	8943540	And so I did not know Simone was a bit of a gamer, but, uh, that was the thing she posted
8943540	8945540	on, uh, uh, social media today.
8945540	8950980	So I was like, Oh, my queen, even though I, I, I, I, I want them all to be successful.
8950980	8952740	You know, there it's a, it's a good group.
8952740	8953380	They have this year.
8953380	8955380	I'll tell you what, I don't hate candy muse anymore.
8956340	8956580	Yeah.
8956580	8958980	She's I she's, she's there for a reason.
8959620	8964580	Gotten to be a lot better of a person and definitely isn't like silky who was just annoying.
8965460	8967460	I'm looking at chat, uh, quickly.
8967460	8970340	Cause, uh, there's a followup to the real media thing that came up.
8970340	8973780	Real media still exists says Bobby Blackwell for the link.
8973780	8978340	Uh, looks like real networks works mostly with streaming services.
8978340	8982820	So maybe they kind of facilitate, um, streaming at this point now, which is kind of what they
8982820	8988260	were doing before, but they're not so much like the go-to destination to see the streaming stuff,
8988260	8992740	um, that other websites like Twitch have become so interesting.
8992740	8994340	I had no idea real networks was still around.
8994340	8995220	Well, congrats.
8995220	9000820	Isn't life 365 back to like, they, they sunset it and then they like came back, I think,
9000820	9002980	but I'm not sure they're exactly what they were before.
9003780	9004580	I'm double checking.
9005780	9007860	I thought that was their website is up.
9008740	9009460	Yeah.
9009460	9015060	But are they still like radio stations and stuff or internet radio program?
9015060	9016900	Real people and not an algorithm.
9016900	9017300	Wow.
9017860	9018740	So they came back.
9019780	9022500	Cause I, I re I remember, yeah, it was 2016.
9022500	9023460	I'm looking real quick.
9023460	9024660	Uh, it was in 2016.
9024660	9025300	They stopped.
9025300	9028980	And I remember we had a whole thing where we were like, pour one out for life 365, where
9028980	9031940	it all began end of an era and all that stuff.
9031940	9037780	Uh, it looks like, okay, so in 2018, they reorganized under media Creek and they are
9037780	9040420	back in the U S Canada and United Kingdom.
9041300	9041780	Interesting.
9041780	9042980	Well, good, good for them.
9042980	9044260	That's where we got our start.
9044260	9044760	Hey.
9046340	9046980	Yeah.
9046980	9050340	And yeah, they have like two different models.
9050340	9053220	One's ad supported and the other's non ad supported.
9053220	9057620	Oh, I think that's kind of how it worked before actually very similar.
9058340	9060740	Cause I remember, yeah, you could have, we had two streams.
9060740	9062180	One was the ad supported stream.
9062180	9066260	One was the, because they would be on different songs depending on where the listener was
9066260	9066340	at.
9066340	9069140	It was always weird, but yeah, apparently you can't monetize them.
9069780	9070580	Oh, interesting.
9071860	9073300	Unless, okay.
9073300	9076180	So if you put their ads on there, you can monetize.
9076980	9078580	Oh, of course.
9078580	9079300	Of course.
9079300	9080420	Uh, who, who was there?
9080420	9081700	Who in chat was there?
9081700	9084500	Who remembers the orange lounge radio station on life 365?
9085300	9087060	Who is there in chat?
9087060	9089780	I'm kind of curious how many are still around from those days.
9089860	9091780	Our dial up friendly radio station.
9092900	9093540	Yeah.
9093540	9096340	That you could, that was the thing, that was, that was one of the big things that
9096340	9099140	differentiated us from DDR free radio at the time.
9099140	9101300	DDR free radio was broadband only.
9101300	9103220	We were dial up friendly radio.
9103220	9109460	So it was doing, you know, cause we, we were doing this before podcasting existed.
9109460	9109960	Right.
9111140	9117220	And I, so many friends that I have now, I made through the early days of the show.
9118660	9119540	So, oh, for sure.
9119940	9122420	There's a lot of you in chat that are like, me, me, me, me.
9122420	9123060	Hell yeah.
9123060	9124180	So, well, thanks.
9124180	9126100	Thank you guys for sticking with us through all these years.
9126100	9127380	It really does mean a lot.
9127380	9131860	And, uh, I think it's, I think it's really cool that, uh, yeah, that we have, you know,
9131860	9132820	transformed the show.
9132820	9135300	Here we are now doing a video thing on Twitch.
9135300	9138260	I don't think we ever thought this would be a video show ever.
9138980	9140740	You know, it's crazy.
9140740	9143060	And now how long did it take you to get me on video?
9143860	9149700	A pandemic, which, which even still I was like, you could just be on Discord and not
9150180	9153460	point the camera at like a doll or something or a stuffed animal.
9153460	9158420	But, um, I'm, I'm, I'm so glad you've decided to jump in and maybe this means once we're
9158420	9161060	all back together, we can all be on cam, which would be fantastic.
9161620	9164260	So I still like putting random things up in front of the camera.
9164260	9164980	That's kind of funny.
9164980	9165620	Yeah, yeah.
9166500	9168180	So that's, that's fun.
9168180	9171940	Um, what else is I going to say about all the old school days and all that stuff?
9171940	9174740	Oh, and the, the long running podcast stuff.
9174740	9179540	So yeah, I, you know, we, we do have that one little claim is that we're the longest
9179540	9185620	running gaming show out there because the life through 65 years kind of added some time
9185620	9190260	to this show that nobody else is able to get, you know, a lot of Guinness thing, a lot of
9190260	9191940	the long running shows out there.
9191940	9194180	And again, this is not a knock to any of those shows.
9194980	9199780	They, everybody has worked very hard and I'm all about supporting other indie shows and
9199780	9202740	you should be listening to all these other great shows that have been around forever.
9202740	9206820	Um, but, uh, the one, the reason why we're able to kind of say, oh, we got about a year
9206820	9210420	and a half on everybody else is because we were on life through 65 before podcasting
9210420	9211060	was a thing.
9211060	9215620	And then, but we jumped, we jumped on podcasting pretty quick with that whole to go edition.
9215620	9217060	It still wasn't in iTunes.
9217060	9219780	We were still doing a podcast before iTunes.
9219780	9223620	So I think the, uh, random message for him, I was reading that clued me in on that.
9224980	9226420	Uh, DJ Rama S in chat.
9226420	9228020	And by the way, this is the part of the show.
9228020	9231220	If you want us to do tangents now, this is the time to yell them out and chat.
9231220	9232260	So go for it.
9232260	9236500	Uh, such as this one, uh, DJ Rama S says, remember O L R at Fanta Mae.
9237060	9238100	I sure, I sure do.
9238100	9240500	The question wasn't for me, but I sure do.
9240500	9240900	Of course.
9240900	9245540	I'm sure dark soccer and Loki remember that I love doing the live shows.
9245540	9248100	I wish we had had a chance to do more of them.
9248100	9250580	Sometimes it's just hard to get us all together.
9250580	9255060	I would love for all three of us to go to dragon con and do a show there, but I know
9255060	9258660	the reality is it's going to be hard for Loki to get away from the kids for that amount
9258660	9259300	of time.
9259300	9265060	I would still want to do it, but I'm definitely going next year because we're going to have
9265540	9266980	the layout army.
9266980	9267480	Yeah.
9267940	9268180	Yeah.
9268180	9271860	And this year we still, you know, dragon con is still kind of like up in the air as it
9271860	9272020	is.
9272020	9273940	We ju we just don't know the period.
9273940	9276820	We're not going to know until that.
9276820	9277380	What was it?
9277380	9278180	60, 90 days.
9278180	9281940	So I think 60 days before we're just not going to know, just like last year, I think it was
9281940	9282820	around the 4th of July.
9282820	9282980	Right.
9282980	9286820	We found we're not going to know till then and whatever, but I think it is better to
9286820	9287700	bank on next year.
9287700	9288820	Probably just 60 days.
9288820	9289380	Yeah.
9289380	9292980	Next year there will be, you know, and that's a good one to bank on Loki.
9292980	9294980	I'd love it if you could come, but I understand he has kids.
9295540	9297140	I would still love it if I could come too.
9297700	9302100	You know, we can always, there is still, you know, dark soccer, if you're going to be there,
9302100	9303620	there's a couple of ways we can do it.
9303620	9306820	We can always allow Bobby Black Wolf to have third chair because he's a big part of this
9306820	9308900	show, but Loki is a part of this show too.
9309700	9313220	So I would think we should just, and I think they did this one year.
9313220	9317380	They had their co-host come in via Skype, but they had a lot of issues with it, but
9317380	9319540	I think they've ironed a lot of that out.
9319540	9324660	So Loki may, I'm not going to promise anything, especially when it's not my track, not my
9324660	9327860	programming, but if we wanted to do that, since dark soccer and I will both be there,
9327860	9330580	we could probably Skype Loki in or something like that.
9330580	9333540	The only thing for you, Loki, is that it might be at like 7 AM.
9333540	9334020	You're tight.
9334020	9336180	It just depends on what time slot they give us.
9336180	9339540	And it's going to be three hours earlier for you, but we could probably work it out.
9340260	9340760	So.
9341780	9342340	Yeah.
9342340	9345540	So, you know, it comes, but I miss conventions in general.
9345540	9351620	I just, I've wanted to attend more medium sized cons and actually have like a vog network
9351620	9352100	table there.
9352100	9354980	Cause I think that's the best way to get word of mouth out there.
9354980	9357940	Did anybody find us through a con or finding us IRL?
9358820	9359320	I don't know.
9360180	9361060	Maybe not so many.
9361060	9364580	I'm not recognizing a lot of names where I remember that, but.
9364580	9372260	Well, I, uh, I invited, uh, Nika in here to join us through our, uh, supernatural chat
9372260	9372820	group.
9372820	9373540	Well, yeah.
9373540	9376740	And social media is a huge, that's why I always say at the end of every show, help us spread
9376740	9381300	the word, a tweet, uh, sharing like that goes an awful long way and you never know, you
9381300	9383380	know, who might benefit from finding this show.
9383380	9384020	So welcome.
9384020	9384520	Welcome.
9385300	9385800	Yeah.
9386420	9394420	And, but I mean, I've had a few people who, uh, you know, like, just like friends who
9394420	9397700	have said, Oh yeah, I downloaded the podcast to check it out, you know?
9397700	9400420	So a few, a few IRLs.
9401540	9403860	Do you know what I did yesterday that I haven't done?
9403860	9406820	And maybe I shouldn't even say this on air because there's going to be a very logical
9406820	9411140	follow-up question that I don't want to answer on air, but yesterday for the first time in
9411700	9414500	six years, I actually looked at our stats.
9415300	9415780	I swear.
9415780	9420980	And people don't believe me when I say this, I was, um, I, I was in there just because
9420980	9423860	I could be, I was like, you know, I haven't looked at this in a long, long time.
9423860	9426740	I'm curious, how many downloads is the show getting?
9426740	9428260	And so I got the answer to that question.
9428820	9431940	Um, and I will say, I, I'm not going to tell you, sorry.
9431940	9436340	Those are, that's just our business, but I'll get, I'm well, I'll tell you guys off air,
9436900	9439300	but, um, I'll give you a twofold answer.
9439860	9444340	It's not as big as it used to be, but it's higher than I thought it was.
9445700	9449620	There's a lot of people out there who I think are lurking, who listen that don't
9449620	9450740	interact and that's okay.
9450740	9454740	I'm not, this isn't, this isn't a call out tweet or anything like that as perfectly.
9454740	9455140	Okay.
9455140	9456660	We love and appreciate you guys too.
9456660	9458980	The silent observers, you guys rule.
9458980	9464260	Um, but, uh, yeah, it's, I, I'm always kind of, when I see it, I'm like, oh, that is more
9464260	9468980	than I thought because, you know, we get, you know, 40 people, maybe max here live on
9468980	9469620	a Sunday night.
9469620	9472740	And so I think, oh, maybe there's another 40 to listen on the podcast feed.
9472740	9476340	And no, it's, it's, uh, it's actually doing a little bit better than that.
9476340	9477700	So that's, uh, there's that.
9479220	9482580	Bobby Blackoff in chat says, I still have so many VOG flyers, lol.
9482580	9488900	And the sad thing is they're all out of date now because so many shows have sunsetted,
9488900	9492900	gone to another network, um, you know, or whatever the case may be.
9492900	9496900	We really still need to like build an army of shows, but I just don't see that really
9496900	9500100	happening in force until we get to the other side of this pandemic.
9500100	9504820	And we can talk about who wants to join up to go to cons together and spread the word
9504820	9506180	and do that whole thing again.
9506180	9507540	So soon, soon.
9508100	9510100	Oh, one of our lurkers said hi.
9510100	9513460	Hey, y'all, I said it wasn't a call out tweet, but thank you.
9513460	9516660	Mr. Rhizos in chat says lurker here, but love the show.
9516660	9518100	Well, thank you very much for that.
9518100	9519780	And lurk all you want.
9519780	9524100	Just the fact that people, just the fact that people give a shit on what we have to say
9524100	9528420	and don't, um, unsubscribe the minute I go on a tangent and talk about something that's
9528420	9531940	not video games, which I may have done once or twice tonight.
9531940	9536260	Um, it wouldn't be a show without a tangent.
9536260	9537060	It wouldn't.
9537060	9539300	How do you do a three hour show about video games?
9539860	9544420	It's not just about video games, actually.
9544420	9547860	The secret is weird stuff on my desk.
9548740	9549300	All right.
9549300	9551860	By the way, I'm just putting it all on camera because of reasons.
9551860	9555700	Let me check in with Loki and see if he has any last minute stories for us tonight.
9556420	9558740	No, this is an incredibly slow week.
9559780	9560740	It was.
9560740	9562020	It was kind of a slow week.
9562020	9563220	So, um, all right.
9563220	9564740	Well, no last minute stories there.
9564740	9567300	All my Mario news that we never got.
9567300	9568260	So, yeah.
9569460	9569700	Yeah.
9569700	9570580	What's that about?
9570580	9573380	Or were we expecting stuff on March 10th or what?
9573940	9574980	Well, it's Mario day.
9574980	9578980	Like last year, I think they showed off, uh, some of the Lego Mario stuff.
9578980	9582340	Um, yeah, nothing this year.
9583540	9584340	All right.
9584340	9589860	And still no word on the, um, year of Zelda everybody was hoping for, which is very sad,
9589860	9592820	but maybe there's something about that March 31st date.
9592820	9598660	You know, the new fiscal year where, you know, cause they still plan on no more 3d all star
9598660	9603060	thing, no more, uh, uh, Mario 35 and all that stuff.
9603060	9604020	That's all going away.
9605060	9607380	They already, they already got my money.
9607380	9608900	So sucker.
9608900	9609220	All right.
9609860	9611460	No, it's my kids wanted it.
9611460	9614020	Uh, it's hard to say no in that case.
9614020	9614980	All right.
9614980	9615940	Uh, that's it.
9615940	9619460	Uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts and then we'll be on our way out of here.
9619460	9623860	So, um, I, uh, Oh, I should say, as I always say at the end of every show,
9623860	9626500	thank you so much for downloading our show or listening to us live.
9626500	9630660	However, you consumed OLR, whether you were very, very vocal and chatted a lot,
9630660	9634340	uh, or if you were just lurking out there, thank you so much for participating with our
9634340	9635060	show tonight.
9635060	9636660	We really appreciate you guys being here.
9636660	9640580	Um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at OLR, uh, help us spread the word, tell a friend
9640580	9641460	or two about the show.
9641460	9645700	Cause as dark soccer pointed out a moment ago, social media is very powerful in spreading
9645700	9646020	the word.
9646020	9647620	So we really appreciate the tweets.
9647620	9649940	And I actually saw a couple of really kind tweets this week.
9649940	9652420	I try to reply to those when I see them or at least like them.
9652420	9656500	Um, so thank you so much to those of you that are spreading the word about OLR out there.
9656500	9662580	Um, uh, a host here on a Twitch for VOG network that goes a long, long way.
9662580	9665620	Even if you don't stream a lot yourself, it still helps us get the word out.
9665620	9667540	So we appreciate all those auto hosts.
9667540	9669460	So, um, okay.
9669460	9676820	So, um, that is, um, gonna otherwise I think, oh, if you, um, want to help the show out,
9676820	9679700	like with money, we appreciate the bits and subs and all that.
9679700	9681940	You don't have to, but we're just saying we really appreciate it.
9681940	9684340	And the shop of vognetwork.com slash shop.
9684340	9687140	If you want to get some merchandise, but again, please don't feel obligated.
9687140	9690180	It's just for the way that we get a new merchandise in the shop.
9691140	9691940	Soon.
9691940	9692580	Trademark.
9693860	9694340	All right.
9694900	9698580	Um, let us wrap it up with our final thoughts tonight.
9698580	9701780	So, uh, dark Sakura, I'll start with you.
9701780	9703860	You're, you're showing all the stuff off on cam there.
9703860	9704740	What's your final thought tonight?
9705620	9710900	Um, I found a bunch of my Instax photos from Easter two years ago with the sisters and
9710900	9715140	my Disneyland pictures, uh, from the last, uh, dry con I attended.
9715700	9719780	Including, and I don't know why I can never remember his name, but the, the, um,
9719860	9728260	uh, yeah, but I also found my, my picture of James St. James that he basically was like,
9728260	9729620	let's take a picture together.
9729620	9730580	Grab photo.
9731860	9732260	Love it.
9733060	9733380	Yeah.
9733380	9734340	He was pretty cool dude.
9734340	9734820	Pretty nice.
9735540	9735780	Nice.
9736660	9737460	All right.
9737460	9738820	Uh, how about Loki?
9738820	9739700	Your final thought tonight?
9740740	9749140	I'm still trying to locate some buddy to be able to do a label printing and if box packaging,
9749140	9752500	I don't even know where to find that.
9753140	9754980	It may be just labeled printing.
9754980	9760260	And then they have, they have some other alternatives that are more rental case than
9761460	9764180	cardboard box, but it may have to go with that.
9764180	9768100	I, I may have some hookups from my printing days.
9769220	9769620	All right.
9769620	9773220	And I was also going to say, get in touch with the game developers, people here locally,
9773220	9776740	because, um, they, they will have all those same questions too.
9777460	9783620	So there's a couple of, there's a couple of print shops in town that will do like the
9783620	9786340	actual like boxes to specification.
9786340	9790420	You just need to have the template ready high res, but we can talk about that offline.
9790420	9790660	Yeah.
9791300	9791540	Okay.
9792980	9798260	Um, and then my final thought tonight is when you can get your VAX, get your VAX.
9798260	9803860	Look, I got, I got, I got my, I got my microchip quote using my quotey fingers,
9803860	9806260	tongue firmly planted in cheek today.
9806260	9810180	And I'm, I'm fine and I'm here and I'm excited.
9810180	9813380	So I'm excited when everybody else is able to get theirs as well.
9813380	9816100	Um, hopefully we really do get to the end of this thing.
9816100	9816500	All right.
9816500	9818980	Uh, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
9818980	9820580	Thank you guys so much for being here.
9820580	9822180	Uh, we will see you in seven days.
9822180	9824980	Let's do it all again for 861.
9824980	9826260	We'll see you next week.
