0	15000	Coming soon to a reopened, round one, Dave & Buster's or similarly sized arcade near you, Minecraft Dungeons!
15000	22000	Not content with Fruit Ninja? Flappy Tickets? That visual overhaul of TMNT Arcade or Infinity Blade? Why not head out and play Minecraft Dungeons?
22000	29000	Introduce your kids to the glory of an arcade via a game that they know and enjoy! Don't have kids? Stay far away from that machine!
29000	35000	This is just one new cash grab space taker. Join your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki for more on this and the rest of the week's gaming news.
35000	37000	Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
42000	48000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
48000	59000	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back once again live tonight with episode number 859 of our show for March the 7th of 2021.
59000	67000	My name is Rob Roberts and sadly not joining me tonight but she will be here later in the show is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
67000	74000	But I am joined this week as I am just about every week by the one and only Techmaster, Loki. Hey, Loki!
74000	75000	Hello.
75000	76000	Hey, how you doing?
76000	77000	I'm doing fine.
77000	80000	Yeah, what game is running behind you tonight? Is that Castle Crashers?
80000	81000	It is Castle Crashers.
81000	90000	Ah, there it is. So a little enhanced video there because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network.
90000	97000	Twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after Bobby Blackwolf.
97000	102000	How is development of your Pixel Poops Ultimate Edition going?
102000	114000	It's going okay. I haven't really worked a ton on it this week. Mostly I'm just doing other things but slowly but surely I got some more of my carts in so I have 12 now.
114000	115000	Oh, nice.
115000	126000	They did some announcements actually. So the folks that make Nest Maker, which I can't remember the name of their company now, but they're launching a service that's going to be similar.
127000	136000	It's kind of like a Steam marketplace, but it's for NES games, for retro games. So you'll be able to purchase digital copies there and they'll actually make cartridges.
136000	143000	So that may be something to check out whenever they launch that. It's like Retroverse or something like that is what they're calling it.
143000	144000	Oh, that'd be pretty cool.
144000	145000	Pretty cool, yeah.
145000	158000	That'll be a really good way to network with other NES game developers too to try to get the word out about your own game and then, you know, we have this little show here that some of them that maybe like their games can come on here and talk about their stuff.
158000	160000	Yeah, pretty cool actually.
160000	170000	Yeah, because we do invite guests to our show once in a while so sadly Dark Sakura not here tonight. She's doing some other stuff she'll talk about a little later on in the show we have a recorded thing with her.
170000	182000	But we are joined tonight as I'm sure the Twitch viewers can see, we do have one of our old pals on the show, sitting in tonight, at least for this first part of the show. Say hello everybody to Shane.
182000	184000	Hello. Hi, how are you?
184000	190000	Busy doing homework. That's why I keep like looking down, going through books trying to get some stuff done.
190000	194000	So you're, you're actually doing homework while the show is going on.
194000	196000	Yes. Fantastic.
196000	208000	You were showing off just before we went live tonight on the video here sorry to the podcast folks we love you but sometimes I have to address some of the visual things, but Shane is wearing a new hat, and I actually I'm always in the market for new
208000	212000	hats I'm wearing an old hat I've had this Nintendo have forever. You've got a new hat. Tell us about the hat.
212000	226000	So, I don't know if you've talked about it on the show before but Donald Konami opened up an official like merchandise store in with the, with the mask on and your words blending together it almost sounded like you said Donald Konami.
226000	231000	I was like, Donald, Donald.
231000	243000	So, Konami opened up a merch store online for North America, though I think they ship everywhere. And so I've got a couple things from them because they have sweet code and stuff.
243000	253000	And this is a sweet code in one soul eater rune hats, it's got the little soul eater emblem right there.
253000	267000	I also have this says getting so sweet code in. So that's cool. And I have a poster but I haven't done anything with. And I know you've talked about it on the show before but we get we get new listeners here and they believe it or not sometimes people
267000	274000	actually like what they hear and they start listening for a few weeks but some folks may not know you actually worked on the sweet code and series back in the day right.
274000	292000	Yes, yes, number five game number five. And what did what did you do for that what was, what did I was, I was on the localization team, so we would get translated text in and then we would have to make it sound better for the intended audience
292000	303000	which would be English speakers. So like, you would get a Google Translate type of thing, and you had to make it make a little more like logical sense I guess would be a good way to logical sense and coherent so if somebody was
303000	316000	talking in a specific way, or they had, you know, some sort of characteristic about the way they spoke, you had to make sure it translated through the entire game through all of their text.
316000	330000	So, interesting. Some of the things I bet a lot of people don't really realize goes into making games and why you know not every game from Japan just shows up over here like that because there is a process that it goes through, and I wish our live chatters
330000	345000	cared more about the merchandise you were showing off, but Loki's cat, yeah Loki's cat Stella has joined us on cam, and she knows I'm on like some sort of video call so she has to come scream so I had to like pick her up, like the live chat could give
345000	358000	two shits about Donald Konami at this point. It's all about Stella now so, of course, our live chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network we do invite you guys to participate live with our chat every week.
358000	370000	I have to bring this up, Shane you know I have to talk about this because you also worked on DDR, like you worked on the Dances Revolution series, and you did arrow does that was there like an official name for arrow designers step artists
371000	380000	step data creators. Okay, so, and then just switch to designers after that. So, people may have danced to songs that you actually did the steps for.
380000	385000	Yeah, I still have songs in the arcade machine so like what can you tell us.
385000	391000	Um, fire, the song from guitar freaks drum mania.
391000	394000	Gosh, it's been so long.
394000	398000	I think a thing called love is still there.
398000	403000	And I'm pretty sure I future list is still there.
403000	419000	So, anything that was like a Konami original that was on a PS two game is probably still there. If I've done it, but you and a lot of that I mean it wasn't just you it was a lot of you know people that were really well known in the DDR scene at that time that
419000	433000	were working on the series and, you know, contributed a lot to the Xbox series which I don't ever think really got the proper amount of respect in the DDR scene, but those ultra mix games, specifically, the first one was okay but really like ultra
433000	447000	mix to I think to this day is still my favorite home version they've ever done and my favorite home song list, and that might just be because I'm you know 42 I'm older at this point and so I look back on those days fondly, but those songs were fire like that was such a good
447000	453000	like mix. And of course, I think back to because that was the first game y'all worked on right.
453000	462000	Correct. Okay, so, um, and some folks in chat by the way dark to see is like oh you stepped fire that was my favorite guitar freaks drum mania DDR crossovers there you go.
462000	465000	Some people, some people are familiar with your work.
466000	481000	But specifically there was there was a song and there was a band in ultra mix to that I ended up totally fanboying over and I think you did to a little bit and that we all did we all did it located to that was the band echo image from Norway because they had the
481000	493000	song skulk. And I remember when you first played me that song because I don't think you were supposed to but you did. And I was like, this is DDR. Now, like this song is amazing.
493000	500000	And then it was like, well we got to find more songs by this band and then it was getting the album, you got the album from a different drum didn't you.
500000	506000	At some point, I went, I went to amoeba amoeba in San Francisco.
506000	515000	I'm pretty sure it was the day that I started working on that song because it was so good. Yes, so good. And then of course that album is so good then you start to start discovering the B side so good.
515000	532000	So of course, what happens to anything that you really fall in love with in a door with it stops, it ends and echo image hasn't put anything out in like, it's been what like 20 years like the last thing they did was that single for endless day right was like 2004,
532000	546000	I think, or 2002, so it's been a long time. Well get this, so out of like nowhere this week I open up Spotify and you know Spotify has the playlist, they have a recommended for you based on the stuff you listen to that's all new things that come out this week.
546000	555000	I look at it and there's a new echo image song, and I'm like, what, and I look and sure enough the echo image artists bio has been updated on echo image fucking put out a single.
555000	569000	This week, after 20 years, and I never thought and that's the band that did skulk again and DDR ultimate to which I fell in love with. And what I really like about this new song is that it sounds like a lot of their old stuff.
569000	581000	And the guys voice has an age today. It's pretty amazing. So, yeah, so if you guys are DDR ultimate to fans, I have to give that cheap plug to echo image. Check it out, and Shane you you liked it well enough to right.
581000	588000	Yeah, it. It definitely reminded me of their first album because there was, like you said that single that came out.
588000	602000	What in 2004 then that compilation has an extra new song on it that we just don't want to talk about. It was, I don't think it was new I think it was deep from the archive like a deep deep cut in the archives, and that's what at least new to us.
602000	606000	That's what I'm going to keep the story as so anyway. All right.
606000	619000	All that old game talk but we want to talk about some of the other things going on in the news. Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight which has to do with a pretty big change coming to PlayStation Loki Tell us a little bit more about this.
619000	634000	Yeah, so basically the PlayStation story you may remember you could, you know, not only purchase games, but you could also get video because it's Sony and so they will of course had their movies, and you can even rent titles off there.
634000	647000	Well, apparently with all these streaming services, folks individually renting movies from a service for the same price as a monthly fee from one of these dozens of other services.
647000	660000	It's not very popular anymore so come as of August 31 2021 they're going to be removing the ability to purchase or rent movies and TV shows from the PlayStation store.
660000	671000	So if you want to be able to do that, you have plenty of other outlets, you know many streaming services, Amazon Prime you can still rent stuff off there if you want to do that.
671000	677000	Voodoo I mean lots of stuff but Sony's PlayStation store will not be the place to do that.
678000	687000	That's a pretty big change don't you think Loki considering, you know when I, when I think of the PlayStation maybe not so much the PlayStation four but I think of you know the equivalent the Xbox one.
687000	703000	And when they first announced the Xbox one remember that whole like initial reveal of Xbox one was sports sports TV TV that's what got criticized for. And I feel like that whole generation was representative of the game console is an entertainment box.
703000	717000	It's no longer just a game console it's your Hollywood box. Also that sits in your, you know, living room, because the we was was so huge for Netflix, and all that stuff so I does this new surprise you Loki or where you at.
717000	723000	It doesn't surprise me because I think that with a lot of these different streaming services launching.
723000	738000	You're seeing a lot of these more popular titles being removed from one and being exclusive to another. So I think it's just a matter of probably some of the stuff that they had is probably going to be pulled from the store in the first place because it's
738000	742000	being exclusive to like Paramount Plus or something like that.
742000	756000	And I think the same thing happened kind of with their TV streaming service as well. I mean, a lot of the channels that they had on there, all of a sudden disappeared because they didn't have the access rights to them anymore and so they couldn't offer it and so they're
756000	761000	they're offering of a streaming service wasn't very good at that time.
761000	773000	So I'm thinking they're probably just see that it's just not worth the money. They're probably not making much off of it anymore so it's just, you know, get it cut out of there and simplify things a bit.
773000	778000	I didn't even think about the fact that PlayStation TV which I can't remember the name of it now.
778000	794000	Was that PlayStation TV or was it have a different I remember, but that's it. Yeah, it is. Yeah, so PlayStation view kind of slowly declined because you're right they lost all those agreements I didn't even occur to me that that might have been a sign of things to come, so to speak.
794000	809000	Yeah, so I just think that they probably not making, you know, they didn't make anything off of that they probably lost the rights to a lot of things. It's just not worth it to pay for those rights to have those street, you know, titles, as part of that library.
809000	826000	And so they just saw, you know, this isn't making us money we're just going to streamline this. And I think you see that with like a lot of the Sony stuffy restructure, you know, I think PlayStation still making quite a bit of money but maybe so many pictures might not be making as much much money right now.
826000	834000	I don't know so he has their own like streaming service outside of me out places can be is not a thing anymore so.
834000	848000	So this topic, this topic came up on Bobby Blackwell show a little bit and we thought crackle but Sony actually sold their stake in crackle. A few years ago it turns out, one of the chatters had pointed out to us, so it doesn't appear Sony has their own service
848000	855000	at this time at least not that not that we're thinking of and not that's obvious which should be a sign that they're not a major player in it.
855000	865000	Yeah, they probably just they're licensing their titles out to other streaming services. And so that's probably, you know, they're making their money probably.
865000	879000	I mean, if you think about it, they don't have to have the network infrastructure for that stuff. They basically just send the files or the movies to these other companies that host it on their services, and really they just receive royalty checks in the mail I mean that's
879000	895000	I think it's much simpler for them and probably making them more money than it is, you know, individually renting these out because I mean honestly, what big Sony Pictures titles, have they had recently I mean there's not really much that's come out.
895000	899000	I mean obviously the new Spider Man movie will be something big.
899000	902000	There's still the new.
902000	906000	Yes, into the spider verse movie I think next year.
906000	911000	Not a lot that I really know I didn't be a charted movie at some point.
911000	926000	But they can't really, aside from like renting those brand new titles I don't think that they're really people are interested in paying $5 to rent, you know, a movie for one a lesson to be brand new, and Sony is certainly not going to be interested in making their own TV shows anymore
926000	931000	so we're never going to get a fourth season of the tester I'm sorry to say.
931000	934000	No, unfortunately not.
934000	950000	Bobby Blackwell saying Ghostbusters afterlife that is a Sony movies there's that now she Hulk is suggesting that. Why not just sell Sony movies why not lean into that and sell Sony movies through PlayStation, and she even suggest rent them for 50 cents, make it cheap
950000	962000	to maybe drive more interest I still, it's still not, not worth it though like I don't think that they're making their money back even if they charge 50 cents for that stuff they're making more money off just licensing them to streaming services
962000	971000	at this point, because they should have done is said hey, you know that that PlayStation Plus that you're paying for. Let's throw in some free movie titles in there as well.
971000	982000	There you go. Okay, I like that. That would make sense or, you know, PlayStation Now or something like that. Hey, not only can you stream these you know, games that you can stream these movies as well.
982000	994000	Good idea. I like that they should have done but nope, they didn't think about that, DJ rama s talking about streaming services saying the only streaming service Sony has right now is crunchy roll and fundamentally.
994000	1004000	I want to go a little more on the animation side of things although now now tying into what you just said Loki crunchy, I want to say didn't wasn't there a thing where PlayStation Plus could get like crunchy roll for a month.
1004000	1009000	So maybe they did lean into that at one point before, maybe so interesting, interesting, interesting.
1009000	1021000	But you know I think Sony is also kind of leaning into the fact that they are getting beat by streaming services but you know if you go to Sony and you go to the TV because I use my, my PlayStation, a lot for like Netflix and that sort of thing.
1021000	1035000	And if you go to the TV video tab, you see a lot like what they spotlight in there they kind of show like oh Amazon has this Netflix has this, and they're kind of showing a lot of like previews for the services and what movies are new on the services
1035000	1043000	especially like originals when it comes to that sort of thing. I've become a lot more familiar with this recently because Alan is doing more and more streaming.
1043000	1053000	I don't always necessarily like to be in the office while he's streaming it gets really hot in there and so forth. So I'll go out in the living room and watch serial killer things on Netflix like a lot of people do these days.
1053000	1061000	And so I've been using these apps more and more and I kind of noticed all those little previews and I'm kind of like, maybe Sony is selling some of that ad space.
1061000	1075000	So it's like maybe they're making money by leaning into the fact that okay if everybody's going to use this for the streaming services. Let's make, let's make money off the streaming services by putting them you know charging them to be front and center on our entertainment box.
1075000	1087000	Yeah, and if you think about it, I mean really in order for them to be able to make money off of a rental like that they would have to have it exclusive to it would have to be not in any of the other streaming services because it doesn't make sense like say for example Spider
1087000	1098000	Man into the Spider-Verse. If I have that for as a four dollar rental or two dollar rental from you know PlayStation Store, but then I also see oh wait it's on Netflix for free.
1098000	1108000	You know if unless most people have a Netflix subscription it's like that doesn't make any sense like you're just not going to even look at the PlayStation Store stuff.
1108000	1118000	Plus I mean on top of that there's all the digital rights management stuff and I mean we've had, you know, folks telling us you know that they've lost their access to their movies and stuff like that.
1118000	1123000	Yeah, it's just, it's easier just to do a streaming service.
1123000	1127000	And that's why, that's why stuff like Stadia doesn't work.
1127000	1134000	SSJ 100 Matt in chat says Rob figured it out. I don't crack the code, they're just going to sell the ad space for everybody else if that's where it's going.
1134000	1135000	He didn't crackle the code.
1135000	1139000	I crackled the code.
1139000	1148000	Shane, what's your thoughts on all this? Did you ever, did you ever use the TV services on PlayStation? Do you think this is good for them? What's your thoughts?
1148000	1163000	No, I never used it. I never saw the point because I already had things like Netflix or Hulu or Amazon Prime. And so, seeing this news that they're going to discontinue rentals and all that, it's no big deal.
1163000	1167000	It's no big deal to them obviously so why should it be a big deal to me?
1167000	1179000	Do you think Microsoft may follow suit? Because remember, Microsoft is also, and Microsoft as far as I know, has no relationship with any, like they're not owned by any major movie studio or anything like that.
1179000	1187000	Like Microsoft's its own thing so Microsoft is licensing all of that from other providers. Do you think Microsoft might follow suit?
1187000	1199000	Well, to be honest, I didn't even know that was a thing on the Xbox. It's not, I guess unless they would advertise it on the main like homepage.
1199000	1203000	Which they do, but you have to scroll down like four tabs or so.
1203000	1217000	I can't be bothered to scroll down. I go to like manage my games, play the disc that's in the system, or I go straight to Game Pass and I don't look at anything in between where I'm at and Game Pass content.
1217000	1239000	I don't think it matters if they also get rid of it because honestly, we've come to a point where we're on the complete other spectrum of where we wanted to be in terms of how we consume TV shows and movies.
1239000	1260000	We cut cable because we had this awesome thing called Netflix and then there was Hulu and then there's Amazon Prime but now there's Paramount Plus and HBO Max and I can't keep up with some competitor dying off because they couldn't do as well in that same space.
1261000	1271000	Looking at some comments from chat, DJ Rama S says they do advertise the movies and TVs. When I turn my Xbox on, I see the sales and rental info on the main page. I haven't changed any settings.
1271000	1280000	I do think they throw an ad in the main page once in a while. Now that DJ Rama says that, I'm like, I do see an ad once in a while. You probably just ignore those. Pretty sure.
1280000	1302000	Oh, what Bobby said is exactly right when I try to think about it and get a headache that it does cost more to have streaming services than it would be to have cable. We have Netflix, Hulu, Discovery, Paramount, Disney, Amazon, Peacock.
1302000	1308000	All of those are paid. That's seven paid services. It's ridiculous.
1308000	1318000	And you know, I even think I offered to let you log into my Paramount thing. I mean, I would never do that. But hypothetically, I may have offered that and you were like, we just bought it.
1318000	1331000	Yeah, because we did the cheaper like pay for one year at a time, then go month to month. And if there is an ad free version, we're definitely already on top of that.
1331000	1334000	So I don't care about the ads. I'm like, whatever.
1335000	1349000	Yeah, that's how I consume so many shows like, because we don't have any ads on anything. So they just play and they play and they play and yeah, that's how I see like 14 seasons of a show and then I just move on to the next one.
1349000	1365000	Let's take up a lot of time. They do. They do. I do think this whole thing is still kind of like just a jarring change because, you know, we really were meant to think of game consoles as entertainment boxes, especially in the last generation with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
1365000	1375000	And it does seem like they've leaned off that a lot going into PlayStation 5. So I think Sony always knew this was the long term because they really never talked about movies and TV at all with PlayStation 5.
1375000	1386000	And I think Microsoft's done very little when it comes to Series S and X. So, you know, I guess the days of the entertainment device, I don't know, I wouldn't necessarily say they're gone because now it's just about streaming services.
1386000	1401000	It's just now the box is a third party device and not a first party device to these things. And I guess that's the big change. So I mean, as long as all the streaming services are on it, and I think the streaming services know they have to be on it to be successful.
1401000	1408000	That's why something like Paramount Plus was everywhere day one, even though that was really just an upgraded CBS All Access app, which I think was pretty much everywhere.
1408000	1421000	But even something like, you know, Disney Plus when it showed up, Peacock when it showed up had to be everywhere day one, because getting on the boxes is the way you're going to get people engaged in those platforms.
1421000	1435000	Hey, don't diss Paramount Plus because it not only did they change the splash screen video, but we got wonder shows and now we have like some good episodes of the real world.
1435000	1436000	Yeah.
1437000	1439000	Drawn Together is on there.
1439000	1451000	The only thing that's weird to me about Paramount Plus, having used it a little bit because I watched that real world reunion at least the one episode we have so far, but the weird thing okay so I got really excited when I saw oh my god MTV's next, the next bus.
1451000	1453000	Next is on there, yeah.
1453000	1458000	It's one season. And it's not even the season with the girl.
1458000	1459000	No.
1459000	1469000	Oh, what's the point, like that's the only episode you need. Exactly. It's like, and I only want to watch the episodes with her and bitchy gays. I don't.
1469000	1476000	Those the only episodes. And do they have date my mom, or, yeah, was that a date but I think they do have date my mom right.
1476000	1488000	But they probably only have one season of it. That's just a weird thing. There's a random ass seasons that are missing and maybe that's a licensing thing they are gonna work out still know that culture points out there is a new road rules coming, and it sounds
1488000	1501000	like it's the classic style, and not like the newer garbage so I'm pretty excited for that, and drag race all stars, which is this is very controversial will not be on VH one it's going to be on Paramount Plus.
1501000	1504000	That's a very controversial move.
1504000	1513000	So, let's see. And then, what was the thing somebody brought up HBO Max I was like oh that's one Shane didn't say.
1513000	1524000	We don't we don't we don't subscribe to that because I don't think there's anything on that service that matters to us like, what is it for it's like the friends.
1524000	1536000	Like that's the only place you can watch friends I don't even like that show so Miss, Miss Aria snark from shaking and crying that show I was doing and we've been toying with the idea of bringing it back but nothing solid yet, but I have I have it on
1536000	1553000	good authority from her she says HBO Max is we're all the best, like documentaries about fucked up things are. She says, like, she says all of them are there, like, she's she's specifically said the Scientology documentary on HBO Max, and that there's some
1553000	1558000	really good serial killer ones on there. So, all of that.
1558000	1568000	All right, anyway. All right, enough about the video stuff on PlayStation. One reason I want to ask you here tonight, Shane and that you guys Shane stepped in like totally last minute tonight to be here so I appreciate it.
1568000	1576000	Hence why I'm doing my homework to while we're talking. Well, and I know you're not gonna stay for the whole show but I want to get a couple things out of the way before we let you go back to your homework.
1576000	1589000	Number one, I want to get to an email here because we actually got an email this week for Shane. I usually do emails at the end of the show I have another email I'll do at the end of the show, but I'm going to do this one here, so we got an email
1589000	1593000	I don't even get emails addressed to me.
1593000	1607000	Well, it actually it did to be fair it does say, Hello, or and then says I have a quick question for Shane. So, this is, this is like, it still mentions my name it's better than most of the spam I get in my real email.
1607000	1616000	Anyway, if you want to send us an email or I guess if you want to send Shane a fan letter participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send us an email. So here we go.
1616000	1630000	Next up on the email are. I have a quick question for Shane regarding last week's Pokemon legends are chaos discussion in Pokemon x and y. The story mentions an ancient Pokemon war that happened.
1630000	1642000	Do you think second legends they're already already know the answer. Do you think this will factor into the RKS game story at all. No, no, I don't think so.
1643000	1650000	I was like, that's like when you point at somebody when you know the objection. Yeah.
1650000	1670000	I don't think it'll factor into this game. I think if the game is successful enough. I say I, I qualify that with enough because it'll be successful it's a Pokemon game, but if it's successful enough that they decide to do another one.
1670000	1694000	I think they will revisit different historical periods that are relevant to the Pokemon games. So I would think that the second game would take place during that war, and that would probably also satisfy fans of x and y who only got x and y there was no secondary game
1694000	1716000	for it because that said that season that generation was x and y and Omega Ruby Alpha Sapphire so they didn't get their third game they didn't get sequels. They were just kind of left with what x and y gave them which was a lot of nothing, even though I like those games but they really botched the story and, and like, who even cares about
1716000	1731000	who even cares about Zygarde he didn't, he wasn't relevant for anything, and then he showed up in a Lola, and still wasn't relevant so making that legendary relevant, plus having the war, I think that would be the best way to go about it.
1731000	1745000	Do you think this weird diversion in Pokemon, because the thing that still blows my mind is that they're saying Pokemon Legends is a mainline game. And do you think there's a weird diversion in the series happening here because Pokemon legend may be for the people that are like
1745000	1755000	in their 30s and 40s now because they've been following Pokemon from the beginning, and then the mainline games are okay this is our more traditional, you know, audience okay you're shaking your head no big time.
1755000	1759000	No. Okay, first of all, I just want to address the chat room.
1759000	1770000	I'm sorry, me she can's mesh is I mesh mesh, I am what they call a coven long hauler so I still have breathing problems.
1770000	1778000	And so, like I wear this mask we actually talked about right before the show started, because it helps.
1778000	1780000	Yes, no one heard it.
1780000	1788000	So it. So yeah I'm muffled and everything but it helps with my breathing it makes it easier for me to breathe. For whatever reason.
1788000	1793000	So yes I'm still sick No I'm not, I'm somewhere in the middle.
1793000	1799000	Anyway, you said a question, I shook my head.
1799000	1805000	Pokemon was is the main series diverting is legends, like the adult game now.
1805000	1818000	Well, no, I think it is for a specific subset of people, because this game has no online, it's single player only doesn't look like there's any trading.
1818000	1834000	So I think it's for the people that wanted Pokemon to take a different direction, but I don't necessarily think that it's for older people I just think, like, what do I do in Pokemon games I just like collecting I don't battle I don't trade with anybody
1834000	1837000	because I don't trust anyone.
1837000	1854000	So, like this game, it's just another option that's not true you traded with me to help me finish my decks. Yeah, but I know you didn't cheat, like to, to get your Pokemon I don't trust randos that are like, here's the shiny whatever and no it's probably
1854000	1871000	happened which happened which happened to me when I went on PlayStation home I'm like, I got a shame I got a shiny Giratina shades like hacks. No, I want to know the shameless first like you're not pronouncing that right.
1871000	1873000	All right. Oh, there was more to the email here.
1873000	1876000	Um, let me finish it off.
1876000	1885000	Where was I here we go. Also, why all the hate for squirtle clearly he's the superior water starter. Thanks for reading Garth wolf.
1885000	1900000	Did you throw this in the trash afterwards. No, belongs because I, I like squirtle I'm not I'm not, I'm not gonna like I'm not gonna fight you on this because like I just know how you are about Ashwa, which by the way, for those that are on Twitch.
1900000	1911000	Look behind Shane, like look right above his head, you can see all those Ashwa star somebody there's a whole, somebody is in your life please.
1911000	1927000	You can see all the Ashwa on the shelf, like the love for Ashwa, is it is it fair to say Shane that the love for Ashwa is so strong that you just don't have room in your heart for any other water starters and that's what happened to squirtle.
1927000	1939000	Well, okay, so in a monogamous relationship with first of all, here's, here's my husband. Here's Ashwa, and then everybody else is not even on the screen.
1939000	1943000	Like everybody else.
1943000	1948000	As far as squirtle is my favorite Gen one starter.
1948000	1951000	However, wow.
1951000	1955000	Talk about throwing scraps out.
1955000	1958000	I mean I'm trying to say something nice.
1958000	1969000	Squirtle is my favorite way to hold on, I have, I have an Excel ranking. Let me just double check my notes here. Don't you have like a shareable Google Sheets.
1969000	1975000	I have so many different like Pokemon spreadsheets I made because spreadsheets are fun.
1975000	1989000	Um, oh, so here you go. Here's something also nice about squirtle. According to my official ranker that I made squirtle is my sixth favorite water starter, like overall.
1989000	1998000	So, he beats two different other water starters. So, yeah.
1999000	2002000	Which two did he beat?
2002000	2022000	Um, Totodile and Mudkip, but that's as that says an entire line. Like if we're just talking about like squirtle squirtle is last, but if we're talking about squirtle, and these other evolutions that I can literally read off this thing but I didn't because I forgot to.
2022000	2027000	Yeah, they as a whole are my sixth favorite water starter.
2027000	2040000	Okay, Shane I have I have an idea, and would you be into this, it's okay for you to say no I don't want to press you just because we're live, but you know we we have a lot of these articles out there that are like top 10 da da da and now you have your definitive
2040000	2053000	ranking. So would you be willing to, if we, let's say raise enough channel points, sit down with me for a special episode where we share Shane's definitive Pokemon ranking, start to finish.
2053000	2060000	I don't care that's fine I love talking about Pokemon and there are lesser ones.
2060000	2073000	Alright, so, so, Bobby I hope you're still out there listening we're gonna set that up for after Bobby because Bobby's doing his channel point rewards this week. So the next big reward we're going to raise points for is going to be unveiling Shane's definitive
2073000	2077000	Pokemon ranking colon, whether you like it or not.
2077000	2092000	So, so, SSJ 100 Matt asks about pop Leo, because I didn't like it for so. So, the thing about my ranking, there's two things that affect it one boredom.
2092000	2106000	If I'm on ambient at the time I'm looking at it, because that will change like almost anything on there. So currently, pop Leo is not last, but I like pop Leo like pop Leo is great.
2106000	2117000	It's the evolutions I have a problem with, which you can hear about on this thing that you just said that I wasn't paying attention to special special stream will will talk special stream.
2117000	2126000	Alright, there you go. Alright, we'll give you more details. Later on, but I see I've been telling Bobby I'm going to come up with ideas and I just got inspired by someone else's list.
2126000	2128000	Awesome.
2128000	2140000	Alright, I okay before I let you go, Shane, we always like to get into how is our gaming weeks, and what are the types of games that we've been playing this week and I know there's been one game that you've been playing a lot of that I don't think
2140000	2148000	Loki and I have really touched. And I think some of our listeners are into this right now too so I want to ask you like, how was your gaming week What have you been playing.
2148000	2157000	So, honestly, I'm going to mix it up because there's two games. Wait, there was my finger Oh wait there's a delay there. My fingers are there.
2157000	2173000	Um, there are two games that I've been playing pretty hardcore. This week, who started who started a poll that says is Shane correct about Pokemon. Did Bobby do some a poll popped up is Shane correct about.
2173000	2184000	And how do we know if I'm correct about Pokemon because we haven't had the special yet we haven't had the special yet Bobby. So we're looking into the future. And you have no idea what's going to happen.
2184000	2189000	All right, anyway your gaming week and then I guess we'll get to the poll results.
2189000	2197000	Well the polls going to be skewed and wrong. Probably, unless it ends on a 5050 it's going to be wrong.
2197000	2205000	So, the first game I've been playing that is probably the major release is bravely default to.
2205000	2220000	And it was a game that I had played both demos of, and I hated both demos. In fact, they went out of their way and said that the second demo is basically indicative of the final game.
2220000	2231000	So why would I want to keep playing, or why would I even consider purchasing bravely default to if I hated the demo that was literally a slice of the game.
2231000	2242000	Breaking news, breaking news, 56% of our listeners think you are correct about Pokemon. Well, I don't even believe that.
2242000	2252000	Like, thank you, but you probably won't agree after this suppose it's special back to bravely default no more Pokemon back to bravely.
2252000	2263000	Anyway, so I don't know why but I still went and I got the game. I loved bravely default one despite like the things people hated about it.
2263000	2269000	I own the second one bravely second I've never played it, I don't, it's just sitting over there.
2269000	2280000	And so I was like okay I'll get this game. And I love it. Everything that I hated about the demo is still there, the voice acting, the combat.
2280000	2308000	I just really enjoy the game. I love the grinding for job points and for experience points, and I will play it until like 2am every morning, because I just, I want to max out my classes and it's a monotonous thing to do but I like monotonous things so this is like right up my alley, and the story is pretty good it's kind of dark too which is fun.
2309000	2317000	mission our chat says I just got it today and I love it, and Shane Can you add me, so is there is there a friend thing that goes on in the game.
2317000	2335000	I did not know that there was I know that there's like a thing where you put the game in sleep mode, and it does these like little trips, these little voyages, but yeah I can I can add you to my friends list and if that helps us do voyages, not a problem, I'll just
2335000	2341000	go get my friend code, which I think I probably have somewhere on my phone, so I can look while I talk.
2341000	2362000	But yeah, I, I'm taking my taking my time with this game, because of how I love the monotonous grinding. So I'm only on chapter two which I know there's at least six chapters. I'm on chapter two, like probably the middle or the beginning of the middle of it.
2362000	2373000	And I'm at like 27 hours, because I just like oh I need to go spend three hours grinding this new job I just got to max because I enjoy doing that.
2373000	2386000	And me says there's a boat you get in the game and that's where the friends come in. So, oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's the I think it's the voyages thing, unless there's another boat that you get but yeah I'm looking at my friend code and I'll just post it in chat,
2386000	2398000	because I definitely don't have like the max amount of friends on my switch. I do. But that's because I connected it to Twitter. And I filled up because of Twitter.
2398000	2406000	So now I have to go when somebody wants to add me and I like I actually know them. I have to go through and I'm like okay who added me through Twitter that I don't really interact with.
2406000	2411000	Oh, I have like I have people through Twitter too I'm like I don't know who has these people.
2411000	2420000	Turn it off, or you're gonna max out that's my honest suggestion turn off the Twitter integration I don't know what it is. I was finding people in there where I'm like I don't even follow this person on Twitter who is this.
2420000	2430000	So, yeah, my suggestion is turn that off. So, all right. Anything else on Bravely Default 2?
2430000	2446000	The one thing that bums me out about Bravely Default 2, there's a couple things. One, it does not run well on the switch. There are a lot of hiccups and just like moments where the game freezes up and then starts, you know, doing what it needs to.
2446000	2461000	I would have wished that they could have optimized it better. The music is not as memorable as Bravely Default 1. And that is really disappointing because Bravely Default 1 has great music.
2461000	2473000	And, like, the, the character models look like creepy marionettes, and I'm getting used to it but it's still, it's still not right.
2473000	2492000	I'm gonna have to check this out. I do love me a grindy JRPG. I just didn't really play enough of the first one, I think. I didn't really love it. So I've been a little bit like skittish about the second one, but I guess it's more like Final Fantasy where the second game doesn't tie into the first game like whatsoever they just they have the same name and they have some similarities about it right.
2492000	2500000	Yeah, it goes Bravely Default to Bravely Second, and then Bravely Default 2 to something if they decide to make another game.
2500000	2503000	Interesting. Okay. You said there was a second game you want to talk about?
2503000	2510000	Yes. The other game is a little indie game that came out this past week called Gnosia.
2510000	2524000	This came up on Discord. Somebody mentioned this over at vognetwork.com slash Discord. I definitely invite you guys to join us over there, because sometimes people bring games to my attention and this was one of them and I was like, Oh, Shane's been talking about this one so anyway, go ahead.
2524000	2533000	Yeah, so it's a game of that social game Werewolf where somebody sabotaging you and you have to figure out who it is.
2533000	2537000	Which is what Among Us is rooted in really.
2537000	2552000	This is single player only and it's like a visual novel so it may not be as fun as Among Us, I would say, but it's got a really interesting story where time keeps looping.
2552000	2562000	And so that's really the narrative is you need to figure out why this is going on. And I'm not very good at it because, I mean, because it's a single player game.
2562000	2572000	It's harder for me to pick up on cues that the computer is doing if they're trying to figure out if they're lying or telling the truth or what's going on.
2573000	2588000	But it's been interesting enough where it's like, okay, like the other night you were I think you were asking if we could play like Final Fantasy or something I was like, yeah, just let me do a few more, let me finish this loop is what they're called the loops last like 10 to 15 minutes.
2588000	2598000	But since they go so quick, you just keep doing them over and over and it got to the point where it's like almost four in the morning and I'm just like still doing these loops like maybe I should go to bed.
2598000	2604000	Meanwhile, I'm just just one more loop. Meanwhile, I'm playing Final Fantasy 14 alone and sad.
2604000	2607000	Just kidding.
2607000	2615000	We play a lot of Final Fantasy 14, just so you guys know like a lot. Yeah, a lot. Yeah. So anyway, but the game is pretty cool.
2615000	2622000	If you like those sort of like who done it, but only in 15 minute bursts.
2622000	2630000	You should probably check it out. It's not that expensive. It's like 25 bucks on switch. All right, and the name one more time.
2630000	2635000	Good was good.
2635000	2637000	Okay.
2637000	2639000	All right.
2639000	2652000	All right. Well, Shane, I'm gonna let you go because I know you got homework to do. Thank you for joining us. Last minute notice tonight and anything else you want to get out any other plugs any other definitive pokemons you want to throw out there before we say good night.
2652000	2656000	I mean, we can see the definitive one.
2656000	2663000	He's just he's pointing at the Auschwitz again podcast, folks. Yeah. And then also the definitive starters right up there.
2663000	2672000	So, um, yeah, no, that's it. I'm good. All right. All right. Have a good one. Take care, Shane. You too. Bye. Bye.
2672000	2677000	All right, Loki, it's just you and me now. So hello. Hello. And let's talk about your gaming week.
2677000	2696000	Yeah, so it's really been just Minecraft this week for the most part. I was we're just doing large scale builds. So on our realm, I decided to make a giant tree kind of modeled after the tree that is scale has in hermitcraft.
2696000	2711000	So I guess sort of the Omega Tree of Doom again. So I've started doing that and I've been working on right now, just modeling the roots of this giant tree. So it's it's enormous on our map.
2711000	2721000	So that's basically what I've been working on this week. And just kind of it's part of this theme park that we're building on our map. I've run out of things to do, really.
2721000	2733000	So just building things now because I have farms for everything. And I think actually last week I tore down several of the because they were trying to figure out how to unlag the server.
2733000	2744000	But it's it's Minecraft realms and just the stuff that Mojang hosts or Microsoft hosts. It's not great.
2744000	2759000	Like I would prefer to just do my own server, which may end up doing some day, but I think we're going to wait to start a new server once my other son has a laptop or computer so that we can all play the Java version and maybe a lot more stable.
2759000	2774000	We could do a lot more with it, but for now with realms, it's just it's pretty slow ever since they switched to that new graphics engine, it's just kind of slowed down for things that really shouldn't be slowed down.
2774000	2779000	But I'm enjoying it. So we've just been working on that.
2779000	2786000	All right. Well, for my gaming week, I haven't been playing Minecraft, but I randomly decided I'm going to play Minecraft Dungeons again.
2786000	2792000	So I've been playing a little bit of that. I need to play that. It's fun. I've been playing that. You know, it's it's very old school Diablo, very that.
2792000	2799000	And it gets hard. Like I actually died on the boss. I think I'm doing something wrong. I was in the swamp of sorrow. I think it's called for those who played the game.
2799000	2805000	And I got to the final boss, which just shoots these ads everywhere. And I was having the hardest time. I think I'm doing something wrong.
2805000	2813000	I need to like read an FAQ or something. But yeah, it's actually pretty challenging because my level is like nine and you only need to be like level four to do it.
2813000	2824000	So I'm doing something wrong when it comes to this boss. But it's it's challenging. And I kind of like that. And yeah, it's it's it's that very old school Diablo vibes, but it's Minecraft.
2824000	2834000	And so I think if people get turned off because they don't like Minecraft, which I understand, you know, Minecraft isn't for everybody, but the dungeons is is not like the original game at all.
2834000	2846000	It's more Diablo. It just it's actually actually it's it could be described like this. When Alan walked in the room, he's like, what are you playing? Is that Lego? Oh, it's Minecraft Diablo.
2846000	2855000	So it's like playing a Lego game or something like that. So, yes, I've been enjoying Minecraft Dungeons, continuing to play things like Final Fantasy 14 again.
2855000	2861000	We play a lot of Final Fantasy 14, Final Fantasy 12, although I kind of hit a point in that where I was like, I don't want to go around.
2861000	2867000	I have to talk to all these villagers to get past this stupid side quest. But if I don't pick that up again soon, I'm not going to finish the game.
2867000	2873000	So I need to pick that up again. But the other thing that's been really distracting me. Sorry, I'm I'm laughing.
2874000	2894000	So you can also bump down the difficulty. Like when you start a level, it starts you recommended difficulty two, which is kind of like the normal mode. But there is totally a Bobby Black Wolf or like kids mode in it.
2894000	2903000	If you bump it down with the left bumper, you can go down to like where like you'll just steam through everything, I believe, because I think it's all tailored for level one.
2903000	2910000	So I think I haven't played a lot with that, but I know I'm not playing on the hardest, hardest difficulty. I'm playing on like the equivalent of normal.
2910000	2920000	Yeah. So there is that anyway. So Final Fantasy 12, Final Fantasy 14. If I don't get past this point, Final Fantasy 12, I'm going to stop playing the game.
2920000	2932000	But so I can't let myself do that. But here's what I got distracted with. So I've mentioned on the show before, I've given lots of cheap plugs to my husband, Alan Alchemy here on Twitch, because he is now streaming and he's really sticking with it.
2932000	2941000	Like he's streaming like at least three times a week. And it's been a few weeks now. He hit affiliate. Yeah. He stole Mr. Smoosh for the emote, which he can do.
2941000	2950000	Mr. Smoosh is his cat, too. He's allowed. So some people were spamming the Smoosh emote in chat earlier that actually comes from Alan's channel because he did that.
2950000	2959000	And he has a little Smoosh watermark when he plays. It's really funny. But one of the games that he plays, he plays a variety of things. He's done like Space Channel 5.
2959000	2968000	He's in Skyrim. So he's done a variety of things. But probably the thing he plays most is Dead by Daylight, which is what a lot of Twitch streamers are playing this day and age.
2968000	2973000	And I have to admit, I usually watch a lot of streamers. I don't understand what the hell's going on with Dead by Daylight.
2973000	2982000	Well, I'd like to think maybe one place where I had a good influence on Alan and what he's been doing with his streams is that when he streamed Dead by Daylight, he explained it.
2982000	2989000	Like he assumed the audience didn't already know the entire game and explained what he was doing and why he was doing it.
2989000	2994000	And I have to admit, after I kind of watched that, I was like, oh, I guess I get this game a little bit.
2994000	3001000	And also, I'm not usually big into scary games because I don't like all the jump scares and things like that. But then it clicked for me.
3001000	3011000	I would have no problem in Dead by Daylight playing the killer. Then I'm the one causing the jump scares. I'm in control of all that stuff because I'm the murderer.
3011000	3013000	Are there really any jump scares in Dead by Daylight?
3013000	3021000	Not really. Like you might get surprised. Like you might be like, oh shit, I didn't know the killer was there. But it's not like a Five Nights jump scare. It's nothing like that.
3021000	3028000	Yeah, I don't think they jump in front of you. It's more of just kind of chasing people down. It didn't seem like a jump scare.
3028000	3034000	No, not really. I kind of learned that from watching the streams and all that. Oh, this isn't like what I thought.
3034000	3042000	And I've got to admit, it's pretty neat how they tie in a lot of the licensed stuff. Because you know, we always have these stories on the show about, oh, this new killer is coming to Dead by Daylight.
3042000	3048000	Oh, they got Pyramid Head in Dead by Daylight. Oh, they've got the ghost faced killer from the screen. Oh, it looks like Michael Myers is in it now.
3048000	3063000	So the thing to realize, the game already had these base killers that they have like the hag, the butcher, no, not the butcher, the doctor, the hillbilly, the wraith, I think it is.
3063000	3069000	That was the one that Alan told me to start with. The one that cloaks invisible and comes in. And they really worked in the licensed stuff very well into this.
3069000	3077000	So anyway, long story short, I've gotten into playing a murderer in Dead by Daylight, which apparently not enough people are doing.
3077000	3085000	Like if you want to wait for a match as a survivor, you have to wait way longer for a match than a killer does. A killer only has to wait like not even a minute.
3085000	3092000	It just depends. If it tries to sync you with people that really are your level, it might take a little while longer. I'm really not good at playing killer.
3092000	3100000	I'm still learning. But the nice thing, like I watched Alan play killer and I'm like, okay, I feel like I'm getting as many hooks as he does in a game.
3100000	3110000	So I'm feeling a little better about my game. And now I'm at the point where I'm like, okay, I've been playing. Mostly the killer I've gotten a lot better with is the hillbilly who uses the chainsaw.
3110000	3118000	And he uses the chainsaw to either dart across the map or dart right into a survivor and knock them over with the chainsaw in one hit.
3118000	3127000	So that's a lot of fun. I'm getting to the point where I'm like, I think I want to buy DLC and Alan is like, oh, that's the point of no return.
3127000	3138000	But like, I really, really want to buy Pyramid Head. Okay, I really, really want to play as Pyramid Head. And that's gonna be here's here's where I'm stuck.
3138000	3151000	Do I get it on Xbox One? Or do I get it on Windows Game Store? Because unfortunately, the game is on Game Pass. That's how I'm playing it is Game Pass through when both actually I've tried it on both Windows Game Store and Xbox One.
3152000	3173000	Unfortunately, cross purchasing isn't a thing on those systems. Here's the weird part. Cross purchasing is a thing on the Steam version, the Stadia version, and the Switch version, ironically, all have cross purchasing, they said with the exception of some licenses.
3173000	3188000	So there may be some there may be some characters that don't. But so if you buy certain characters, you will like if I buy it on Steam, I will have it on the switch, assuming it's not like like it's it's it's an original like the twins and not something like Ghost Face, I'm assuming is like one of the tricky ones.
3188000	3199000	So this is interesting. Zen Monkey says in chat, they did everything nice, but they fucked up by putting the wrong Freddy Krueger in it. You just have to find the right killer for your play style.
3199000	3216000	You need one that's just a hack and slasher without powers. Yeah, I'm finding that I just need someone who's kind of like fast, which I don't think the killers I don't know, I don't know, I, I still have to I think the the Wraith looks like one I might do good with the Wraith is kind of a hybrid.
3216000	3232000	Like the nurse does these teleporting things. I don't think I'm good enough for that. But the Wraith can kind of teleport without sight can kind of like dash forward. And I think that would help me a lot. So I don't know there are there are definitely some killers I want to play around and I just want to play pyramid because pyramid head is awesome.
3232000	3246000	So anyway, the 10 minutes later, the point of my story is my husband finally broke me and I'm playing dead by daylight. But the twist is, I'm playing it as a killer. Because I think I think killing is fun in that game.
3246000	3266000	Listen, let's make it in the game in a game only sense. So anyway, and I think I do at the end of the day enjoy playing on Xbox one a little more. You know why? Because there's no chat at the end of the game if you're on Xbox one, because I've seen on streams and stuff, some of the shit talking people do in chats on steam and things like that after a game.
3266000	3290000	No, ma'am. I'm not interested in that, you know, jerk off stuff where people are acting like acting like fools. What is it Dion Warwick said on Twitter, we're gonna leave that foolishness behind in 2020. Is that when it comes to when it comes to dead by daylight postgame chats, we are leaving that foolishness in 2020. So I'm only gonna play on Xbox one, I think I think I'm going to settle on being an Xbox one person. So there it is.
3291000	3299000	All right, let's move on. Let's talk about some things that are in gaming news. Loki, we'll start with you.
3300000	3317000	Yes, acquisitions. Let's talk about acquisitions. So Epic Games has purchased Tonic Games Group, which includes the company Media Tonic, who you may know for the Fall Guys game. So now, essentially, Epic Games now owns Fall Guys.
3317000	3346000	So along with that, though, apparently, he said, there was a kind of a welcome message that was put out about them joining the Epic Games family. So with our publisher Devolver Digital supporting and championing us along the way with Fall Guys, Foul Play and Hot Tofo Boyfriend, we've been able to bring some truly unique experiences to players as an independent studio joining forces with Epic will put an accelerator or will accelerate our plans.
3347000	3356000	To improve the game and bring Fall Guys to as many players as possible, assuming that you purchase it on the Epic Games store, of course, and probably probably not the iPhone anytime soon.
3360000	3361000	Just just saying.
3362000	3373000	So, yeah, so kind of similar to what they did with, you know, Rocket League and Psyonix. So it is interesting and be curious to see what happens with Fall Guys on Steam.
3374000	3386000	Now, what they said, though, if it will remain purchasable on Steam and PlayStation, if you own the game on these platforms, you'll still be able to play it from there and will receive future updates, they say.
3387000	3388000	OK, we'll see.
3389000	3395000	And the Switch, right? Because they just announced Fall Guys for Switch and Xbox versions as well. So those are going to be coming as well.
3396000	3401000	So, yeah, it'll be interesting what happens with this.
3402000	3407000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network is pointing out if Fall Guys ever goes free to play, then it'll disappear from Steam.
3408000	3414000	Rocket League wasn't pulled from Steam until it went free to play. So they maybe and maybe maybe that's what do you think?
3415000	3418000	That might be what Epic is trying to build is kind of like an e-sports thing.
3419000	3424000	You know, I've never really considered Fall Guy e-sports, but I can I can see where they but certainly Rocket League, certainly that.
3425000	3435000	And there is a certain there is an interesting trend between those two games where they are both games that were PlayStation plus games that blew the fuck up.
3435000	3442000	Because so many people discovered it through PlayStation plus and found that these games were very fun and very replayable.
3443000	3450000	Although what is sorry is Fall Guys as big now as it was when it first launched? I'm not sure I see as much of it.
3451000	3457000	It has its fans and I don't I don't want to diss anybody that's still super into Fall Guys, but I definitely feel like Fall Guys has already peaked.
3458000	3467000	But then again, Rocket League probably peaked when it was on PlayStation plus and there's still a huge I don't actually know that's probably not fair to say there's like Rocket League championship out in Vegas.
3468000	3476000	It's it's probably bigger than it's ever been. But we it's just not in the mainstream. I guess maybe is the right way to say they're not mainstream games like they used to be.
3477000	3490000	Well, that's that's I mean, I think that one avenue that they could make some money off of this, obviously, is that they already have a game Fortnite that sells a buttload of cosmetics.
3491000	3497000	That's how they make money in their game. And what's you know, how do they make money with Fall Guys selling cosmetics?
3497000	3509000	So it makes sense that you just have, you know, what is a lot. How does Debbie Daylights still make money after being on the Xbox thing for free and Game Pass for free?
3510000	3517000	And I think the base games like 50, but it's all cosmetics and new killers and things like that. That's that's how the game industries. That's all that's all the rage now.
3517000	3529000	So so it makes sense that they would probably try to pump some money into cosmetics and maybe they could even do stuff where it's like, oh, yeah, you buy buy the skin in Fortnite and you get something in this game or something.
3530000	3538000	I don't know. But it sounds like that they're trying to like bolster their free to play stuff, although granted that we're just assuming that eventually they'll go free to play.
3539000	3547000	But yeah, I think that's kind of one of the reasons why that they're including more stuff with that. I don't know. Be interested to see what happens with this.
3548000	3560000	Yeah. Very interesting to see what the long term strategy ends up being. So I wonder if maybe you might see Epic kind of build something where it's a Fortnite and Rocket League and Fall Guys championship thing.
3561000	3570000	And I can't even believe I didn't say Fortnite when I was talking about like these big like e-sport type of event things. It's it's very interesting how Epic is trying to pocket a few of them.
3571000	3579000	I really feel like there's a long term thing there when it comes to not I almost I would say like multiplayer games, but almost massively.
3580000	3586000	So, you know, I guess massively is like Fortnite. Rocket League is still what, four, six, maybe eight people tops, depending on how you're playing it.
3586000	3588000	I don't know. Interesting.
3589000	3595000	Act F suggests Fall Night League. Yes. Yeah. Please look forward to that as a future bumper at the beginning of the show here on Twitch.
3596000	3598000	All right. Moving on.
3599000	3611000	Let's get to our next story, which I saw I almost want to apologize because here we go again with rumors. And here we go again. They're about the Switch Pro about to be unveiled.
3612000	3620000	So what the hell's different this time? Why are we talking about this again? Because apparently this has to do with a Bloomberg report.
3621000	3626000	It originally came out last year, but now there has been some updates.
3627000	3636000	So Bloomberg has gone back and updated their whole thing on the Nintendo Switch Pro specs and leaks and what is going to be happening.
3636000	3640000	So apparently this new, you know, and again, I I already said rumor.
3641000	3646000	Well, let me before I even get into the details, before I even tell you what's in it and look, you don't think about what's in it.
3647000	3649000	Do we need a Switch Pro? Do we need a Switch Pro?
3649000	3666000	It would be nice to have something that's a little bit more powerful just to be able to support some of these cross platform games that right now are on the Xbox Series X and probably going to be PlayStation 5.
3667000	3675000	So you're going to need a little bit more powerful of a system in order to be able to have make it easier for developers to have something that also plays on the Nintendo Switch.
3676000	3690000	That being said, I don't know, maybe. I mean, I know that the last Pokémon game had some open world sections that really chugged. Maybe that extra horsepower would help things out a bit.
3691000	3700000	And it's just J100 Matt in our chat over Twitch.tv slash VOG Network says Nintendo doesn't need a Switch Pro because the Switch still does well.
3701000	3718000	That is true. But I think if there is a space in the world for there to be new mobile phones every year, you know, a new iPhone every year like clockwork, a new Android every year like clockwork, there's there's new stuff in that space every year.
3718000	3732000	And I'm not saying we need a new Nintendo Switch every year, but I think it's OK. It's been what, four years now at this point? I think it's OK for them to do an upgrade so that they can stay a little bit on the curve.
3732000	3737000	I can't stay ahead of the curve because Nintendo is never going to be there when it comes to the hardware. We just have to accept that.
3737000	3745000	But they can be more on the curve. And what Loki was saying about these third party games getting ported where Nintendo is going to get left behind.
3745000	3754000	And I think they may have learned that lesson a little bit with the Wii U if they don't. So I and I think this is why these rumors, I'll have you say in a second.
3754000	3769000	This is why these rumors keep gaining steam, I think, because a lot of the gamer population wants it to be true because they want the Switch to remain competitive with the other systems, which, yes, I realize is a weird thing to say when the Switch is still selling very well.
3769000	3772000	It's it's competitive in its own way. Anyway, Loki.
3772000	3780000	But that being said, though, I don't know what they could really do with this because it's going to be segmenting the user base already.
3780000	3793000	They've sold a ton of Switches already. So it's kind of like like the new 3DS type of thing where you have a version of the 3DS that, you know, is a little bit more powerful.
3793000	3803000	They can run some things that may be only exclusive to that. But like aside from it sounds like, you know, hardware wise, it's not going to be much of an upgrade.
3803000	3811000	I don't know if it's more of a refresh. Maybe maybe they're like going forward that all the systems are going to be this brand new one or something.
3811000	3818000	I think if there's a big if Nintendo can get it right, you'll see something like what you see in the mobile phone space.
3818000	3824000	And what Microsoft is really trying to do with Xbox One and Series S and X is that the games will still work.
3824000	3828000	They're just going to be a lot smoother on the Series X.
3828000	3838000	And I think if you really want to just point your finger and go for me, I'm like, this may be the biggest example of that, where the game will still play on the old Switch.
3838000	3845000	But you're going to want it on the new one is that Pokemon Legends footage that everybody was tearing apart because they said it doesn't look well.
3845000	3853000	Well, folks, what if and again, I hate to add the fuel to this fire, but I I'm starting to you know, I do think that where there's smoke, there's fire.
3853000	3857000	There's been too many rumors about this or this not to happen.
3857000	3865000	I think that Pokemon Legends maybe was being shown on an original Switch and that game will run the way you expect it to run on the Switch Pro.
3865000	3869000	And following up in our chat, Act Def says, crazy theory.
3869000	3877000	What if we haven't heard anything about Metroid, Breath of the Wild 2 and Bayonetta 3 because they're being optimized for the Switch Pro?
3877000	3885000	In my opinion, if you're a Nintendo fan, don't you fucking want that really bad? Because I know I do.
3885000	3891000	Yes. Hold on to them and make them want run really well on the Switch Pro.
3891000	3898000	Don't leave the old school Switch fans out in the cold, but make sure they run Chef's Kiss on the Switch Pro.
3898000	3907000	And I think that would be a great thing. Anyway, let's get to some of the rumor details from the Bloomberg report.
3907000	3919000	It will have an OLED screen that is made by Samsung, which led somebody in chat, S.J. 100 Matt, I think, said, hmm, I wonder if this is a leak within Samsung because of the the screen they're describing.
3919000	3922000	Who knows? We don't know where the leak is coming from, but here's what it is.
3922000	3926000	So the OLED screen will be by Samsung. It will be seven inches across.
3926000	3932000	A current Switch model is six point two inches across unless you have a light, which is five and a half.
3932000	3938000	So it will be bigger and it will feature a 720p resolution, I believe.
3938000	3944000	Correct me if I'm wrong, but OLED is what a PlayStation Vita uses, right?
3944000	3946000	I think that. Yeah, I think those were OLED.
3946000	3952000	So imagine a PlayStation Vita screen and those are pretty nice, but seven inches big.
3952000	3956000	So it's going to be a little bigger than your current Switch. That sounds pretty nice.
3956000	3962000	And the big kicker is that it will do 4K visuals when docked.
3962000	3967000	So it's 720p undocked or handheld, 4K when it's docked.
3968000	3976000	So they're saying almost sounds like though, like if it's only doing 720, though, and handheld, then it doesn't sound like hardware wise.
3976000	3983000	It's really much more powerful. Well, but if it's if it's spitting out 4K, you know, it might be just 4K upscaled.
3983000	3986000	I mean, they could have an upscaler built through the dock and that's it.
3986000	3993000	But like, I don't know, it's just I'm surprised that they didn't go 1080 or something like that for the handheld.
3993000	3999000	Maybe it's 720, but very smooth. I don't think the handheld today is 720, is it?
3999000	4001000	The handheld is 720.
4001000	4005000	But very few, very few games optimize that way because they can't.
4005000	4013000	Because I don't remember what the native resolution was on the PlayStation Vita, but I thought it was 1080.
4013000	4016000	Maybe I'm thinking maybe that was still 720.
4016000	4024000	No, yeah, 960 by 544. So that's still a higher resolution, though, than the Switch had.
4024000	4030000	But I mean, it's not natively 1080. It's kind of like an in-between weirdo resolution.
4030000	4034000	But yeah, I'm kind of disappointed that the resolution is not better.
4034000	4041000	Yeah. Yeah, Bob Coffee in chat suggests if it's 4K docked, it probably has some special sauce.
4041000	4053000	Yeah, probably. Again, I don't always love reporting on rumors, even though this is just a show about gaming culture as well as gaming news.
4053000	4055000	And rumors are a part of the culture.
4055000	4060000	But I do think we've heard this from so many different places so many times, I think it's happening.
4060000	4064000	Now it's just sorting out the garbage rumors from the true rumors.
4064000	4075000	But again, you've got a larger publication here kind of running with it that's probably vetted their sources a little better than somebody on Reddit or a random forum out there.
4075000	4081000	So I do think there's something to this. I wouldn't necessarily hold them to these specs.
4081000	4086000	But it does sure sound like we're going to get some type of Switch Pro in it.
4086000	4095000	I would guess we'll probably see it at what would historically be E3 in June. As we all know, all of that is a mess right now.
4095000	4101000	But I would guess that June's Nintendo Direct will unveil that. But that's extremely hypothetical.
4101000	4106000	And that might also explain why this last Nintendo Direct didn't really give everybody what they were looking for.
4106000	4109000	That maybe, yes, a lot of those things are holding on to.
4109000	4118000	They want to show you when it looks its best and brightest when it's upscaled to 4K on Switch Pro. But we'll see. We'll see.
4118000	4121000	All right. Well, moving on, Loki.
4121000	4129000	So speaking of Nintendo systems, Nintendo system has been out of the picture for quite a while now.
4129000	4133000	The Wii U has actually gotten another firmware update.
4133000	4139000	So the last one came out almost three years ago, back in September 2018.
4139000	4148000	And Nintendo put out the very detailed update description saying that improvements to system stability and usability.
4148000	4155000	And it says further improvements to overall system stability and other minor adjustments have been made to enhance the user experience.
4155000	4158000	That sounds like anti-piracy. That's always anti-piracy.
4158000	4163000	Translation hackers and pirates found an exploit and we fucking zipped it up.
4163000	4170000	That's what it is. Yeah, at least that's what they're saying. But I mean, I don't know.
4170000	4176000	According to like some of the comments that I see on the article here, they're talking about like whether if that was actually what it was,
4176000	4181000	because most people usually think, you know, stability improvements are just, you know, hack prevention.
4181000	4184000	But apparently it didn't do anything with the current methods of hacking right now.
4184000	4194000	So. But yeah, they said it did. But did it mess up existing hack consoles? I don't know.
4194000	4204000	So, yeah, I don't know what it I mean, even at this point, like if it's even worth it, because I think that aren't they taking down the Wii U store anyways?
4204000	4216000	Well, that was my I was going to put out the tinfoil hat suggestion is the update a hidden kill switch for a countdown clock for the Wii U store,
4216000	4222000	which I don't think they've announced at the Wii store. Yes. Oh, for sure. The Wii U store.
4222000	4226000	I'm pretty sure that they announced that already that they were really.
4226000	4235000	Yeah, because. I'm pretty sure. Yeah, I thought that was a thing. Maybe not.
4235000	4246000	Maybe I'm thinking of the Wii Shop channel. Yeah, it says versions of Nintendo eShop, Wii U and 3DS were discontinued July 31st, 2020.
4246000	4257000	Oh, that's a Latin American and other countries. Well, maybe it's coming. Maybe that's what it is. But I thought I thought it was being shut down, though.
4257000	4271000	I think it's one. It's probably imminent, which is going to be a bummer because there's some things on Wii U, especially in the virtual console space that you're going to want to get, you know, things like the original Pokemon Snap Earth.
4271000	4278000	Was Earthbound ever put out? I can't. Yeah, I think Earthbound was. I know Mother, the original Mother One or what do they call it? Earthbound Zero.
4278000	4285000	I think that is definitely one you're going to want to grab. You know, there are definitely things on that shop you're going to want to get.
4285000	4293000	Again, I'm totally tinfoil heading. We have nothing to. But it's interesting. If it didn't patch out the current hacking and exploits, then what the hell did it do?
4293000	4297000	Especially out of the middle of nowhere after all this time, you know?
4297000	4312000	Yeah, I don't I don't know. But yeah, they shut down the services in 42 countries. That was back in July of last year, but they haven't shut it down everywhere yet. So maybe that's just it's coming.
4312000	4321000	Probably. All right. Well, you know what? Sometimes the old stuff is new again, and we know that is the case with Diablo 2.
4321000	4330000	And I got to say, I think this is pretty interesting. Diablo 2 Resurrected, of course, which was announced at the online BlizzCon, which is supposed to be releasing this year.
4330000	4336000	Fingers crossed that they can make their date. And it was announced this week that your old save games.
4336000	4348000	That's right. If you still somehow I don't who has these? Well, somebody does, obviously. But if you have an old save game from Diablo 2 20 years ago, you can use it in the new game.
4348000	4359000	So there was an actual interview that was happening with the IGN Middle East, where producer Matthew Sederquist, I hope I said that right, said yes, yes, keep those.
4359000	4369000	The best feature ever, which is using those old save games. Do you have a three and a half inch floppy sitting around the house somewhere with your old Diablo 2 games?
4369000	4382000	I never played Diablo 2. I think I played. Where would I even get a three and a half inch disk drive for my new computer? I guess I could go to Fry's. Oh, wait.
4382000	4389000	No, you could get I'm sure they have USB drives for that. You could get three and a half inch floppy USB drives, I'm sure.
4389000	4400000	And I'm sure Amazon or something. Yeah, I'm sure that they still have those. It's just you're right. Yeah. Who is that? I threw away all my floppies a long time ago. I had hundreds of them.
4401000	4407000	Now, good point. Dark Tetsuya does point out, I think you can get original D2 on Battle.net and Pixel Pocket says yes, you can.
4407000	4414000	So original D2 is still being sold all these years later because it is a great game. So people are still interested in it.
4414000	4424000	So not everybody's saves may be on three and a half inch floppies. They may actually have been playing Diablo 2 on more current hardware. So that makes a little more sense.
4424000	4427000	They have their saves on five and a quarter floppies.
4427000	4434000	Which were older than the three and a half. Hello. You mean you mean zip drives on a zip disk?
4434000	4437000	The zip disk, yes. I had those too.
4437000	4443000	Oh, yeah. I used to use those at work because we needed the space because it was publication stuff. Anyway.
4443000	4450000	I use those at work to download because they had high speed internet at work and I didn't have high speed at home.
4450000	4452000	MP3's Napster?
4453000	4458000	That step mania files, lots of stuff.
4458000	4466000	Otherwise, otherwise, the way you got around that before you'd be able to zip that stuff up and be able to transfer is you have a span floppy disk.
4466000	4471000	And I did. I used to do that with like 50 floppy disk and span of one zip file.
4471000	4476000	But then I was like, well, I'm just going to get a zip disk and that worked out great.
4476000	4491000	Now, it should be pointed out that hypothetically, you could use your old save file, put it on PC and then use the whole like cross play thing to actually then play your old save on a Nintendo Switch.
4491000	4494000	So that's kind of interesting. Yeah, that would work.
4494000	4502000	And, you know, the way this works is that basically it is the original game. And in an interview, one of the folks behind it says this isn't a remake.
4502000	4509000	We're not reverse engineering it. We're not rebuilding it and trying to make it look like and sound like Diablo 2. This is Diablo 2 right there underneath the surface.
4509000	4513000	The entire simulation, the engine for the game, the lifeblood of the game is Diablo 2.
4513000	4521000	So there's a toggle switch, a legacy toggle that when you press the button, you see behind the curtains and there's Diablo 2 in 2D sprites running right there.
4521000	4525000	And you can play the way that you did 20 years ago. And that's why it works.
4525000	4527000	So, very interesting.
4527000	4528000	It just works.
4528000	4536000	It just works. If you want to try Diablo 2 Resurrected, there's going to be at least two chances to do this.
4536000	4540000	Apparently, there is going to be an initial alpha test for the game.
4540000	4545000	And then there's going to be a second alpha period, which will be a multiplayer stress test.
4545000	4551000	Lead producer Chris Lena said, we're going to be starting with a single player technical alpha.
4551000	4556000	And then we'll have a second technica alpha after that, which is kind of multiplayer and stress testing.
4556000	4560000	So we're trying to avoid what happened with Diablo 3 the day it launched.
4560000	4567000	If anyone can remember way back, the day that Diablo 3 launched, it was Air 37 or something like that.
4567000	4569000	It was a goddamn mess.
4569000	4574000	We would have done an episode that week. That's the sad thing. It wasn't that long ago.
4574000	4579000	So I'm sure we bitched all about it. I remember getting it free.
4580000	4587000	I remember. It was probably during the Hoard House years because I remember there was this thing called the Blood Pact.
4587000	4589000	Well, we called it that. It wasn't actually called that.
4589000	4599000	But if you signed up for World of Warcraft for an entire year and agreed that you would play World of Warcraft for a year, you got a copy of Diablo 3 free.
4599000	4602000	So it was the WoW Blood Pact. Do you remember that?
4602000	4604000	I remember that, yes.
4604000	4610000	All those Warcraft people were trying to play Diablo 3, their new free game, right on that same first day.
4610000	4616000	And then I think they regretted doing that Blood Pact because it almost got too many people into the game pretty quick.
4616000	4619000	But anyway, that's old news at this point.
4619000	4624000	Alright, S2100Matt says, I remember that as well. Yeah, it was something.
4624000	4626000	Alright, moving on. Loki.
4626000	4638000	Alright, so we talked a little bit about how Zynga was producing, I think, a version of Star Wars as part of that whole, like, hey, look, we licensed Star Wars to a hundred people.
4638000	4650000	Well, now we have them purchasing the studio Etchra Games. I guess that's the studio behind Torchlight.
4651000	4655000	So apparently now they're going to be joining Zynga.
4655000	4663000	And apparently now they're going to be responsible for some of the, yeah, it doesn't really say what they're working on yet.
4663000	4671000	Other than they said the acquisition will be instrumental in our growing of our iconic licenses and brands from mobile to PC to consoles.
4673000	4678000	Yeah, I'm looking forward to the Torchlight Farmville crossover game.
4678000	4688000	Yeah, I agree with Phoenix7726 who says, Welp, RIP Torchlight. Yeah, I played a little bit of Torchlight 3 and it just, it doesn't have the magic at the first two games for me.
4688000	4694000	I'm just going to be blunt. I don't know. I don't know what happened. I don't know if it's because it started as the whole free to play thing.
4694000	4697000	And then, you know, kind of shifted focus along the way.
4697000	4706000	They're working on an unannounced cross platform action role playing game in partner with Zynga's natural motion studio.
4707000	4715000	I wonder if that's, maybe that's the Star Wars game or maybe not. I don't know. But I'm not excited when I hear the word Zynga.
4716000	4717000	Yeah.
4718000	4719000	I don't know.
4719000	4721000	It's almost like Facebook Live.
4721000	4722000	Yeah.
4725000	4731000	Anyway, this is also not, I don't know. Some people like this kind of news because it means free game.
4731000	4740000	But then it's also not great news because the game isn't really being worked on anymore. And sadly, it's Valve's Artifact game.
4740000	4746000	This was the card game that was inspired by Dota 2, which I swear just came up on the show not that long ago.
4746000	4749000	I think we knew this was kind of like the beginning of the end.
4749000	4760000	They tried to reinvent the game with a 2.0 rework, but according to Valve in an update called The Future of Artifact, it didn't attract enough of an audience to justify further work and investment.
4760000	4768000	Which if you want to go, speaking of the rumor farm, apparently a similar discussion happened with EA and Anthem, although that might have been last week.
4768000	4775000	But apparently that Anthem 2.0, not happening. The executives got their look at it.
4775000	4776000	We talked about that last week.
4776000	4781000	Oh, did we talk about, I can't, I can't even remember what I did yesterday, let alone seven days ago. Sorry.
4781000	4788000	But I guess Valve having a similar conversation in their walls and they're not going to be continuing with Artifact.
4788000	4798000	So the classic version and the 2.0 version of Artifact, which is called Artifact Foundry, this is kind of like now one big game that anyone can play for free.
4798000	4802000	You don't even have to spend money on cards, but there will be no further updates.
4802000	4807000	This was originally announced in 2017 and then it finally came out in 2018.
4807000	4810000	And so that is it with the team moving on to other projects.
4810000	4814000	You know, I think this is just the case of too many card games.
4815000	4819000	You know, too many people tried to get into this all at once because Hearthstone did so well.
4819000	4825000	Now everybody wanted their game. And didn't we have a very similar story not that long ago about Gwent, the Witcher game?
4825000	4829000	You know why? You know why they had to stop development on this, right?
4829000	4832000	Because, you know, they were already on their 2.0 version.
4832000	4835000	That's right. They can't have 3.0. Can't have it.
4835000	4838000	It's in the Creed.
4838000	4840000	Gabe hates that number. Oh, yeah.
4841000	4851000	There's a big sign on the wall at Valve HQ that says, no threes. No threes. No capes, no threes.
4851000	4854000	How many floors does the building have? I wonder if there's a third floor in there.
4854000	4856000	Two. No.
4857000	4859000	One, two, and four.
4863000	4866000	If you go in the elevator, there's floors one, two, and four.
4866000	4871000	It's like the hotel where it's like, why does it go from 12 to 14? Why can't I go to 13?
4871000	4877000	Well, the 14th floor is the 13th floor. They just don't tell you that.
4877000	4879000	Anyway.
4880000	4887000	All right. Phoenix7726 in chat asks, so if we ever get Half-Life 3, does the world end?
4887000	4890000	Shh. Shh.
4892000	4900000	DJ Rama S says, remember, Capcom had that same sign up in their office for years. Yeah, that's true.
4900000	4911000	All right. Anyhow, let's use a little bit of magic to take a step back in time and check out the classic game of the week with Dark Sakura.
4912000	4916000	So I'm going to push this button over here marked Time Warp.
4916000	4923000	And through the magic of internet radio, I'm going to be transported to a space where I'm joined with Dark Sakura.
4923000	4925000	Jamie Summers, hello.
4925000	4929000	Hi. We found a magical interdimensional space where there's no COVID.
4929000	4933000	Yes. Let's use it to our advantage for our little podcast.
4933000	4936000	Yeah, we're going to podcast and play video games.
4937000	4939000	All right. Well, you're here to join us,
4939000	4946000	as you do every week to talk about the classic game of the week where we're going to step into the vault and find a video game that we think,
4946000	4950000	hey, the brat should be checking out this game instead this week.
4950000	4956000	Forget your Debbie Daylights and your Final Fantasy 12s and 14s and 16s.
4956000	4958000	You should enjoy this classic instead.
4958000	4963000	Oh, I believe we have a treat tonight because we have a flag.
4963000	4967000	We do. Yeah, it's a flag. A wild flag has spotted. Throw a pester ball at it.
4967000	4975000	So if you don't know what a flag is, that is a fucking weird arcade game of the month and a special 2021 twist.
4975000	4981000	Dark Sakura takes her segment and every month spotlights one fucking weird arcade game.
4981000	4986000	And this week is no different. Dark Sakura, what is the flag for the month of March?
4986000	4990000	Well, this game says you need to get off your ass and start moving.
4990000	4992000	And it's not DDR.
4992000	4994000	It's Spider-Star.
4994000	5002000	No, the game is called Inu no Osanpo, which means walk the dog, and it's a dog walking simulation game.
5002000	5009000	But now the developers of this were WoW Entertainment and Cave, as in cave shooters, you know.
5009000	5010000	Oh, wow.
5010000	5017000	And it was published by Sega for the NAOMI arcade system in 2001.
5017000	5024000	So basically, it is a virtual dog walking game with a treadmill and a leash attachment.
5024000	5034000	So and of course, it only came out in Japan, although I think you can find them like in really random places in North America.
5034000	5039000	But basically, it's supposed to simulate the experience of dog walking.
5039000	5042000	And you can choose one of six breeds.
5042000	5049000	You have a poodle, a pug, a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, which I would be using all the time because corgis are amazing.
5049000	5050000	Corgis are amazing.
5050000	5054000	Shiba Inu, a Labrador Retriever or Siberian Husky.
5054000	5058000	So it's like Nintendogs, but it's cave dogs.
5058000	5061000	No, they don't like it.
5061000	5065000	You don't have to dodge like firepower from them or anything or, you know, flying poops.
5065000	5066000	OK.
5066000	5070000	That's Pixel Poops Part 3, the poops in space.
5072000	5080000	Anyway, so depending on what kind of dog you choose, you get a different difficulty.
5080000	5088000	So after you select the dog, then you get one of three walking routes, each of them that has a unique scenario with it.
5088000	5093000	Route A is the beginner route where you walk to the pet store to buy dog food.
5093000	5100000	Route B is intermediate, which is walking around in a field so your dog can play Frisbee.
5100000	5106000	And Route C, which is the hardest one, takes you through a city on the way home from the dog park.
5106000	5114000	So once you've chosen your dog and your route, the walk starts and your goal is to keep your dog happy.
5114000	5118000	You have to keep that dog happy long enough to complete the entire course.
5118000	5123000	And so you have a mood meter in the game and musical notes that are around the doggy's head.
5123000	5132000	So you have to move this plastic leash controller to steer the dog away from danger, like traffic or big dogs.
5132000	5136000	And then towards things that the dog would be interested in, like cats.
5136000	5144000	You also have to avoid garbage and rotten food so that your dog won't eat it and become sick.
5144000	5152000	But if you know your dog won't be injured or anything, but if you don't keep the dog out of danger, the mood meter will decrease.
5152000	5157000	And you also have to keep moving at the right pace to keep your dog happy.
5157000	5163000	Too fast will drag your dog and too slow will make your dog become angry and hug at the leash.
5163000	5171000	And then if you do well, you can unlock a bonus stage where you have to follow your dog that chases your runaway cat.
5171000	5177000	So the game's over when your route is completed or your dog gets too pissed at you.
5178000	5189000	At the end, you get a score, which is basically, well, it's calculated by your distance, the amount of movement and the number of calories burned.
5189000	5201000	So there's one review I could find of this game and basically IGN called it odd and proof that Sega is absolutely insane.
5201000	5203000	I'd say that's a compliment.
5203000	5209000	Yeah, there are a few other reviews about it out and around.
5209000	5219000	Siliconera did one that, you know, was basically, you know, saying that it was, you know, a happy little game.
5219000	5226000	You can move around and that it's strange that when you run, the dog doesn't move faster.
5226000	5233000	You can sprint and the dog will just kind of go with you.
5233000	5239000	But you do get happy bonus points when you let the dog have fun with it.
5239000	5243000	And this actually did come out before Nintendogs.
5243000	5244000	Oh, yeah.
5244000	5255000	Wouldn't have been neat, though, if you could have, like, had your Nintendogs data interact with this.
5255000	5261000	The things that could have been if there was an earlier Nintendo and Sega, I guess, partnership, how did now I might have missed this.
5261000	5265000	But how do you how do you control this? Is it just like a normal joystick type of thing?
5265000	5271000	It's it's this big leash controller that you would just move back and forth to steer your dog.
5271000	5280000	Interesting. OK, because I know these I know these Sega arcade games, like all of them just had like wild controllers to go custom things to go with them.
5280000	5282000	So, OK, this one's no different then.
5282000	5291000	Well, yeah, and you do I mean, basically like the the cars coming up on you were bicycles are kind of this quick time event.
5291000	5297000	So you'd have to move the chain to keep the dog out of the way.
5297000	5301000	And then the cat chasing one is a full on run.
5301000	5304000	So there's that.
5304000	5312000	And you also, of course, I mean, like you can let your dog have a pee because that makes dogs happy to be able to have a pee.
5312000	5316000	So it hashtag relatable.
5316000	5322000	Yeah. But, you know, this kind of game, I think I would love to play this one.
5322000	5330000	I'd love to find one, you know, because I think that something like this would be just, you know, super, super fun to do.
5330000	5335000	You know, I I'm into to these kinds of of activity games.
5335000	5340000	It's and it's about little doggies, in particular, corgis as one of the selections.
5340000	5351000	How can you possibly go wrong? Well, and and the other thing about these Naomi era games are I mean,
5351000	5358000	I mean, like we had one of Planet Harrier was Hikaru.
5358000	5366000	We had what was it, Brave Firefighters, I think also was around Bank Panic.
5366000	5370000	I know that was that was early on. I'm thinking big, big panic.
5370000	5375000	But we had. Brave Firefighters wasn't Sega, was it?
5375000	5383000	I don't recall, but I remember seeing one of those, but they did a bunch of just weird games like this.
5383000	5388000	Those like Jumbo Safari was that that was Namco. Yes.
5388000	5404000	But there were like these series of games right around this time that were like these weird kind of simulation or adventure games that were sort of
5404000	5419000	putting you in this one particular like area of of experience, like something very sort of thinking of very isolated.
5419000	5422000	Does that make sense? Yeah. Very focused on a certain thing.
5422000	5428000	And just a minor update, because I'm sure the chat room is probably screaming it already. Jumbo Safari actually was a Sega.
5429000	5435000	Sega did publish that game and it was originally going to be part of like a three in one compilation.
5435000	5443000	That was like a real life career series with Brave Firefighters and Emergency Call Ambulance was the other one, except Emergency Call Ambulance.
5443000	5451000	Well, the actual compilation was never released, although I guess all those games were individually in the arcade.
5451000	5454000	Just a little footnote, even though it's a different game.
5454000	5464000	Yeah. And so I'm really quick just pulling up like another list of the NAOMI games.
5464000	5471000	So there was like a hold on, it's taking me a moment to bring it up.
5471000	5478000	So, yeah, for NAOMI, we had Crazy Taxi, F355 Challenge, Super Monkey Ball, Virtual Fighter.
5478000	5484000	So that was NAOMI and NAOMI 2. Just some of the games that were on them.
5484000	5487000	NAOMI 2 was the replacement for Hikaru.
5487000	5494000	But I mean, for Hikaru, we had Brave Firefighters again, Star Wars Arcade, Planet Harriers, NASCAR Arcade.
5494000	5501000	So they were really kind of getting into some of the, I'd say more interesting things.
5501000	5506000	Well, there's a lot of iconic arcade games in that category and lots of flags in their own right.
5507000	5509000	Yeah, definitely a lot of flags.
5509000	5514000	But I was actually just double checking and I saw they also had one called Triforce.
5514000	5517000	Yeah, that was the F-Zero one, right?
5517000	5523000	Exactly. But it was co-developed by Namco, Sega and Nintendo, and that was F-Zero AX.
5523000	5529000	After that, they had Chihiro, which was based on Xbox structure.
5529000	5532000	That was Ghost Squad and Outrun 2 and Virtual Cop 3.
5532000	5535000	All right. Well, we got lots of arcade games there.
5535000	5539000	All right. But the classic game of the week. What was it one more time?
5539000	5544000	Inu no Osanpo. So it literally means walking the dog.
5544000	5548000	All right. And probably not found in an arcade near you.
5548000	5551000	But I'm sure there's some footage to check out online.
5551000	5554000	Or if you do find one in the US somewhere, let us know.
5554000	5556000	I need a picture. Play it.
5556000	5558000	Dark Sakura wants to fly out there and play it.
5558000	5560000	Record yourself playing it.
5560000	5561000	Yes.
5561000	5563000	And I'll try to draw you a puppy.
5563000	5565000	Tweet it at us. All right.
5565000	5566000	Yeah.
5566000	5568000	Dark Sakura, I know you can't join us live tonight.
5568000	5571000	Do you have any other final thoughts for our listeners tonight before we go back to the show?
5571000	5573000	I'll tell people why.
5573000	5574000	Okay, sure.
5574000	5580000	So I'm participating in GISH, the Great International Scavenger Hunt.
5580000	5584000	Not to be confused with the original Snashing Pumpkins album, correct?
5584000	5588000	Did they have an album called GISH?
5588000	5590000	I think so. It was their very first album, I think.
5590000	5591000	Was that what it was called?
5591000	5592000	Yes.
5594000	5596000	I'm having an old person moment.
5596000	5597000	That's all right.
5597000	5605000	Well, at any rate, I'm doing a mini hunt and they issue out small challenges.
5605000	5610000	And some of them, though, involve doing acts of charity and kindness for other people.
5610000	5616000	There's going to be another big one in August, and that's the week-long hunt.
5616000	5627000	But I'm doing this small weekend one, and it involves doing baking and crafting and making commercials and things like that.
5627000	5635000	So I just want to say that on a time where it's not going to interfere with Orange Lounge Radio, I will plan my time better.
5635000	5643000	But I would definitely look into going to GISH.com and seeing if this is something you'd want to participate in, because I'd like to start an Orange Lounge team.
5643000	5644000	Okay.
5644000	5646000	Let me know if you want to be a GISH-er.
5646000	5647000	All right.
5647000	5652000	All right. Well, we will see you back on the show again next week, Dark Sakura. Have a great week.
5652000	5654000	You too. Bye.
5656000	5658000	All right. There it is, your classic game of the week.
5658000	5662000	And now we are warped back to the present and back here live in the studio.
5662000	5670000	And what I think is kind of interesting is that Bobby Blackwell was listening to that segment and actually found pictures of him playing the game.
5670000	5677000	So he posted it in the, you may or may not know this, we have a secret subscribers only chat on our Discord server.
5677000	5684000	So if you actually have your Discord link to your Twitch and you subscribe to VOG Network, then you get access to this little special channel in there.
5684000	5687000	So just a little extra perk, Bobby posted a picture.
5687000	5697000	If you ever curious what he looks like without a beard and what he looked like when he was 28 as opposed to 29, I guess, you can check that out over in the VOG Network Discord.
5697000	5700000	So I thought that was funny that Bobby's actually played the game.
5700000	5703000	So he'll have to he'll have to tell Jamie all about it, I guess.
5703000	5705000	But that looked like that was like a fun game.
5705000	5707000	I'd never seen one in person either.
5707000	5715000	But I expect most of these weird arcade games, probably not unless she picks Derby Owners Club at some point, which would be a pretty weird pick, I guess.
5715000	5717000	I don't know.
5717000	5722000	All right. Well, let's get back into the show and do some rapid fire news.
5722000	5724000	Loki, why don't you start us off?
5724000	5729000	Yes. So we have a brand new Blaster Master game announced.
5729000	5735000	So Blaster Master 03 coming to PlayStation 4, PC and Nintendo Switch this summer.
5735000	5739000	And they put out a brand new trailer for that as well.
5739000	5741000	It's supposed to launch on July 29th.
5741000	5746000	That reminds me I need to play Blaster Master 02, but those those remakes are really good.
5746000	5748000	Yeah. Yeah. This one looks pretty good, too.
5748000	5750000	So that coming soon.
5750000	5758000	So, you know, I wonder what they're going to make after this, because Inti Creates has been doing a lot of good stuff.
5758000	5761000	I know. Can somebody just send them a copy of the Guardian legend?
5761000	5765000	Just leave it on their doorstep, just with a hint and maybe a cake or something.
5765000	5767000	Just anyway, just saying.
5767000	5772000	You know, funny that you mention that, because it's like actually I haven't I've been picking up some more.
5773000	5784000	I went to the flea market this weekend to go look at retro games because there's on the was it the Folsom Boulevard flea market or wherever they've got, like this guy that sells is like a shop.
5784000	5786000	Oh, yeah. I've been in there. Yeah.
5786000	5792000	Except it's a complete mess and you can't find anything in the condition of them are pretty horrible.
5792000	5795000	So I was kind of I don't remember when I went in there.
5795000	5798000	Have you been to the one downtown at this point, right? Like that new place downtown?
5798000	5799000	I have not been to the one down.
5799000	5802000	You should. It's cute. It's cute.
5802000	5808000	Yeah, I need to go in there. But anyways, so I was just playing because I was looking for a copy of the Guardian legends.
5808000	5812000	I ended up just ordering one. So I've got a copy coming for my Nintendo.
5812000	5814000	Now that I have good rampage. Yeah, good.
5814000	5816000	Make your kids play it.
5816000	5818000	I, I will.
5818000	5821000	Good tone. This is what a good game looks like.
5821000	5823000	Yeah, excellent. All right.
5823000	5835000	Anyways, and then we, of course, are not surprised by the fact that there is an announcement that Super Nintendo World in Orlando has been delayed to 2025.
5835000	5838000	Not a big surprise with the pandemic going on.
5838000	5848000	But apparently the park now is scheduled to open early 2025 and has been, of course, on hold since COVID-19 is a thing.
5848000	5853000	So that's fine. Probably not the one I would have been going to.
5853000	5860000	Anyways, I know the Anaheim one's a little ahead of schedule or, you know, not Anaheim, but like Hollywood Universal.
5860000	5865000	Yeah, Hollywood, I guess, is a little bit more along than the Orlando one anyway.
5865000	5868000	So I and I believe that is actually in Hollywood, too.
5868000	5871000	It's not just name that because, you know, L.A. or whatever. I think.
5871000	5875000	Yeah. I remember I based on where it is, right. It's right across the street from Hollywood Bowl.
5875000	5882000	If I remember right. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, I mean, I'm more anticipating going that one anyway.
5882000	5886000	So no big deal. But yeah, but still a two year delay is pretty significant.
5886000	5892000	Like I would have I wouldn't wouldn't have been surprised if it was like a year, you know, about the same time that COVID has been.
5892000	5897000	Well, we hope like, you know, again, this is the first show of March 2020 again.
5897000	5903000	You know what I mean? Like, you know, it's been it's honestly it has been I think we did do so.
5903000	5908000	I was still on the cruise this time last year. Right. I was on that Star Trek cruise, which again, nothing.
5908000	5913000	You would have never known that there was cruise problems in the world because I had a great time and nothing happened.
5913000	5920000	But if I remember right, I got back. I was at work for a week. And then you and I did a show that Sunday.
5920000	5926000	Jamie wasn't here because she got her respiratory thing, which, you know, she thought at the time could be COVID.
5926000	5930000	But I think the doctors ended up it was something else. But I remember you and I were here in the studio.
5930000	5936000	That was the last show we did in the studio together was there. So all three of us were a year past that point now.
5936000	5941000	But even just you and me here in the studio, it were past a year or we're coming up on a year.
5941000	5946000	I think that was would have been like March 15th or so. Last year was the last show we did live.
5946000	5949000	Yeah. So like next week, basically. So we're kind of looped a whole year.
5949000	5956000	So anyway, hoping that COVID does ramp down in about that same, you know, that year time frame.
5956000	5959000	You know, they are they're finally talking about Disneyland in April. Right.
5959000	5968000	So that's a pretty that's a pretty significant, you know, milestone, I think, especially remember California's got a very different approach to all of this than maybe the part of the country you live in.
5968000	5971000	Yeah. Everything is opening up over here, though. I know.
5971000	5978000	I know it's a weird like is is he doing it just because people are pissed off enough to sign a recall petition or is it.
5978000	5989000	But I, I try to listen to the scientists and not the politicians and the, you know, the science does seem to be that like, if you're vaccinated, it does open up a lot more possibility for you.
5989000	6002000	It's just about we've got to make sure that the vaccines also stop the disease, which the signs out of Israel are looking hopeful, at least for Pfizer, that it will stop because that would be very, very, very good news.
6002000	6010000	If the vaccines also stop you from being able to transmit it, that will probably put a stop to all this. Fingers and toes crossed.
6010000	6024000	But anyway, my my my real point being with all of this was I thought because maybe the pandemic would last about a year, maybe a little over 13, 14 months, that this would only be delayed 13, 14 months.
6024000	6029000	But we're talking a two year delay. Right. It's crazy. Yeah. Yeah.
6030000	6039000	I wonder how the stuff's going on in California Adventure. I know that they were doing the whole Avengers complex thing, the new rides and stuff over there.
6039000	6044000	All that is still that they all that is still being worked on. They took the time to go back and redo.
6044000	6049000	They totally redid Snow White's ride at Disneyland. And I think they refer.
6049000	6058000	So, I mean, Disneyland is going to look great for those people that can actually get in there in April and who are willing to go in there in April, because I got to admit, I'm still a little bit like.
6058000	6071000	But I'm not I'm not going to judge people who want to rush and go to Disneyland in April, because I've been in the shoes of somebody where a Disneyland trip can do wonders for your mental health.
6071000	6079000	And I think after the year it's been, I think a lot of us need that boost to our mental health. And we have to remember, they're only going to open at like 15, 25 percent capacity.
6079000	6085000	There's going to be masks. Not everything's probably going to be open. Everybody gets to make their own personal choice on that as far as I'm concerned.
6085000	6092000	And I'm not going to judge people that want to go day one because I get it. Some people need it and it's just that simple.
6092000	6098000	But anyway, 15, 15 to 20 percent capacity. Can you imagine? Yeah, but that might be fantastic. I know.
6098000	6104000	Right. Sounds like a dream to be in the park when it's only that full. Honestly, it almost makes me want to risk it.
6104000	6109000	But conveniently, Alan and I have other financial priorities right now.
6109000	6116000	So like when we talk about let's go to Disneyland right when they open, it's kind of like that's just it's it's a nonstarter conversation for us right now.
6116000	6122000	Like we have to get past some milestones we're working on first. So anyway.
6122000	6128000	Wow. We got to rapid fire news from that two year delay story. All right. Let's quickly talk about these other stories then.
6128000	6135000	A new RPG coming to Apple Arcade. Well, we already knew this. I knew I remember we talked about Mist Walker was making something for Apple Arcade.
6135000	6141000	Now we've seen it. It's called Fantasian. And I've got to admit, it looks really nice.
6141000	6149000	I mean, for a phone game. And I don't know how many of you out there had this reaction, but I know I was like switch switch version when?
6149000	6157000	Because I'd rather just play this on the switch. But the way some of the battles work looks like it might be kind of touch screen intensive,
6157000	6162000	which maybe is a good thing because things designed for a cell phone controller tend to work a little better.
6162000	6167000	So I don't know. This this may be all right. I got to maybe give this a chance.
6167000	6175000	But anyway, of course, Mr. Mist Walker brought us the Blue Dragon series, Lost Odyssey, which I'm getting a lot of Lost Odyssey vibes from some of the battles.
6175000	6180000	Should we have a new Lost Odyssey game? Well, you got this for better or worse.
6180000	6187000	It looks good. Yeah, it does. And they actually use like real like dioramas that actually make up the backgrounds.
6187000	6192000	They're like real figures and sculptures and things that kind of a neat way to do it.
6192000	6197000	So, yeah, check out the trailer if you haven't seen it yet. So and apparently I'll never play it because it's on Apple Arcade.
6197000	6203000	Yeah. Well, hopefully you can still buy it as a standalone game. And again, hopefully it does get ported to other stuff.
6203000	6207000	And doesn't end there. But yeah, who knows what kind of deal they have.
6207000	6211000	Apple may have financed it. And if that's the case, you're not going to play it anywhere else, period.
6211000	6216000	So we'll see. All right. Anyhow, one other story.
6216000	6224000	So I guess I'm a Dead by Daylight person now because I have a story about Dead by Daylight and a new killer that's coming to that game.
6224000	6229000	So Dead by Daylight is getting a new killer. It is not somebody you recognize.
6229000	6236000	It is not like the Demi Gorgon from Stranger Things, which, yes, is one of the killers you can play, or Leatherface or something like that.
6236000	6240000	It is going to be inspired very much by a K-pop.
6240000	6247000	Actually, I believe some folks actually kind of like worked on this who are involved in K-pop.
6247000	6254000	They teamed up with a BTS producer to actually create the character Ji Woon, who is a K-pop star.
6254000	6259000	And he is somehow he went from K-pop to being addicted to murder.
6259000	6264000	He uses knives and he kind of looks he looks pretty cool.
6264000	6269000	Looks like he might be kind of that more fast and agile character I'm looking to play. I don't know.
6269000	6278000	So, yeah, he uses throwing knives, which I believe the Huntress kind of uses a similar thing as well, and then has some other tricks and things as well.
6278000	6282000	And there will be a survivor that gets added to the game as well.
6282000	6290000	And the All Kill chapter will be released soon. It is on the Test Realms right now, if you want to check that out.
6290000	6297000	I'm also hearing that colorblind, some of the issues with the colorblindness are being addressed in this update as well.
6297000	6303000	And they're showing some of the auras of like what generators look like in different stages.
6303000	6310000	Some of that is going to be changing the colors as well to help address some of those issues, which is good news, because that's a long time coming.
6310000	6312000	So that is coming out.
6312000	6316000	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. Loki.
6316000	6324000	So we've got a few things coming out, starting off with looks like Apex Legends.
6324000	6328000	That's going to be coming out on Nintendo Switch. I was like, that game's already out everywhere.
6328000	6332000	Oh, sweet. Not yet. Not this way. Not this way. Not yet.
6333000	6340000	Gensou Sky Drift on PlayStation 4. We have Stronghold Warlords on PC.
6340000	6350000	Monster Energy Supercross, the official video game for on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Stadia.
6350000	6356000	Crash Bandicoot 4 It's About Time on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.
6356000	6358000	And that's it.
6358000	6363000	All right, going over to Japan and checking out the releases there.
6363000	6368000	A-Train, Hajimaru Kankou Kaikaku comes out on the Nintendo Switch.
6368000	6372000	A-Train All Aboard Tourism is basically what that is.
6372000	6377000	So it's another one of those A-Train simulation games. Again, there's a ton of them in Japan.
6377000	6380000	They don't bring many of them over here, and that's too bad.
6380000	6385000	Crash Bandicoot It's About Time also gets its Japanese release this week on March 12th.
6385000	6389000	And let's see, that's about it for the Switch this week.
6389000	6397000	Looking at the PlayStation 5, I don't think we get anything until we get the Japanese version of a Tom Clancy game on March 18th.
6397000	6402000	PlayStation 4, on the other hand, gets the King of Fighters XIV.
6402000	6406000	The Ultimate Edition comes out this week on March the 11th.
6406000	6409000	So you can check that out on PlayStation 4.
6409000	6411000	Otherwise, it's a fairly light week this week.
6411000	6413000	OK, how about the UK, Logie?
6413000	6419000	We've got the Hunting Simulator 2 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6419000	6423000	Monster Truck Championship on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6423000	6431000	Monster Energy Supercross 4 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and on PC.
6431000	6433000	Wheel of Fortune on the Switch.
6433000	6436000	Trivial Pursuit Live on Switch.
6436000	6438000	RISC on Switch.
6439000	6441000	I don't even know how to pronounce this.
6441000	6444000	Jupiter Grad on PlayStation 4.
6444000	6449000	Baobad's Mausoleum on Nintendo Switch.
6449000	6450000	And that's it.
6450000	6452000	I didn't realize it was such a board game week.
6452000	6454000	Trivial Pursuit and RISC.
6454000	6460000	Yeah, all those family games, I guess they're just putting out physical versions of that.
6460000	6463000	Yeah, but a lot of those hold up really well over time.
6463000	6467000	There's still people that are gung-ho about a game like RISC.
6468000	6473000	All right, let's move on and get back into a few more long stories for you guys.
6473000	6475000	I have a feeling it's going to end up a shorter show tonight
6475000	6477000	because we're not even at the two-hour mark yet.
6477000	6479000	We only have about four more stories for you guys.
6479000	6481000	But we're down a host tonight.
6481000	6484000	Actually, the news seemed to be a little bit lighter too this week.
6484000	6488000	It didn't seem to be quite as much going on as we've had in the past couple of weeks.
6488000	6490000	So we'll do a few stories for you guys.
6490000	6495000	And if you have any questions, we'll get to those, of course, in our Discord or other comments.
6495000	6497000	Twitch.tv slash vog network.
6497000	6500000	And we do have one more longer email to get to tonight as well,
6500000	6503000	which I briefly glanced at before the show, and it's pretty cool.
6503000	6505000	So we'll get to that in a minute.
6505000	6507000	Meanwhile, Loki.
6507000	6512000	So there's been this long story that's been going on about this publisher
6512000	6515000	or developer Frogwares and their game The Sinking City.
6515000	6524000	Apparently, they've had to DMCA their own game on Steam to get it taken down
6524000	6530000	because apparently their publisher has pirated the game and put it onto the storefront.
6530000	6536000	So the way this worked out is the publisher Nacon, which I think is also
6536000	6538000	I'm trying to remember the other name for them,
6538000	6542000	but they published a lot of these kind of British games as well.
6542000	6546000	Like they had, I think, some of the Sherlock Holmes games
6546000	6548000	and there was, I can't remember some of the others,
6548000	6551000	I think it might be Ben Interactive.
6552000	6560000	So they actually had a deal with the developers Frogwares on The Sinking City.
6560000	6564000	And apparently they did not fulfill their part of the deal,
6564000	6569000	which included payments for the game and hitting development milestones.
6569000	6571000	Basically, they had the game done and they said,
6571000	6573000	oh, well, you didn't hit your development milestones,
6573000	6574000	you're not going to pay you.
6574000	6577000	So it kind of breached the contract with that.
6577000	6580000	And since Frogwares owns the entire IP for it,
6580000	6585000	you know, they were supposed to be able to publish that on their own.
6585000	6591000	Well, what ended up happening is this company decided to go ahead
6591000	6596000	and just take a version of the game from another platform,
6596000	6600000	reverse compile it, basically using some,
6600000	6602000	I don't know if they hacked it or what,
6602000	6607000	but then they went ahead and they took out the developer Frogwares logos
6607000	6610000	and stuff out of the game and tried publishing it on Steam.
6610000	6613000	So they basically stole it and they published it.
6613000	6616000	And they were so lazy about it, they didn't even use the same,
6616000	6620000	they used the same encryption keys as the original game had.
6620000	6622000	So Frogwares, of course,
6622000	6626000	were able to go in with their own encryption keys and see that, yes,
6626000	6629000	they did steal this from this other platform.
6629000	6630000	That's pretty bold.
6630000	6631000	It is.
6631000	6637000	OK, so apparently, yeah, it's in this long, you know,
6637000	6639000	drawn out thing that they've had to do.
6639000	6645000	Now, of course, they've filed lawsuits and going to try to go after this company
6645000	6649000	because, you know, it sounds like they've basically tried to steal it
6649000	6654000	and get actual profits from this,
6654000	6658000	considering that they hadn't paid any of their appropriate royalties.
6658000	6664000	So, yeah, this isn't going on for a while now for several years.
6664000	6666000	So this is kind of led up to this moment.
6666000	6669000	But that's kind of crazy.
6669000	6672000	So be interesting to see what ends up happening.
6672000	6677000	I'm hoping that they actually end up putting out the game again under the Frogwares label,
6677000	6680000	because that's what they've been doing is actually self-publishing a lot of stuff.
6680000	6682000	And from what I understand, though,
6682000	6687000	this is not the first time that they've had trouble like this with this publisher,
6687000	6690000	is that they've tried to do like shady stuff like that before.
6690000	6692000	So I don't know.
6692000	6695000	This publisher is going to have quite a reputation.
6695000	6697000	Yeah, exactly.
6697000	6699000	Not the good kind.
6699000	6701000	I'll be interested to see how this unfolds.
6701000	6704000	It sounds like at least they're starting to get to a point
6704000	6708000	where there might be some resolution to it, but I don't know.
6708000	6710000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,
6710000	6713000	My favorite part is that Frogwares still had access to the Steam page
6713000	6716000	and posted news updates to say not to buy it.
6716000	6719000	And that the publishers already changed their name once.
6719000	6721000	Bobby talked about this at length on his show tonight.
6721000	6723000	So it's yeah.
6723000	6725000	Yeah, so it's interesting.
6725000	6730000	There was there was a few stories I had heard people talking about and stuff.
6730000	6733000	So, you know, kind of got the gist of what was going on there.
6733000	6735000	But yeah, I don't know.
6735000	6737000	Publishers, man.
6737000	6739000	What do you get?
6739000	6741000	What are they good for?
6741000	6745000	Well, I know they're good for, but in this case, they didn't fulfill their part of it.
6745000	6749000	So it's like, you know, you can't, you know, back out of paying royalties.
6749000	6751000	Oh, but we want money, though.
6751000	6753000	You pay us your money.
6753000	6755000	But we're not going to pay you our money.
6755000	6756000	I don't know.
6756000	6757000	All right.
6757000	6758000	It's ridiculous.
6758000	6762000	Well, I think this agreement will go a little bit smoother, at least we hope.
6762000	6768000	Forever Entertainment is gone into an agreement to release multiple game remakes
6768000	6772000	based on an IP that belongs to Square Enix Japan.
6772000	6774000	This is something that the company announced.
6774000	6775000	We don't know what it is.
6775000	6779000	And of course, obviously, fanboys are going wild with speculation.
6779000	6782000	Square Enix remakes are very in style right now.
6782000	6783000	Right.
6783000	6784000	We just had what?
6784000	6786000	Legend of Mana and Saga Frontier.
6786000	6790000	Two mediocre at best games getting remakes.
6790000	6791000	I have to be shady.
6791000	6792000	I'm sorry.
6792000	6795000	It's my opinion.
6795000	6798000	Those two games, you know, are getting the Switch ones.
6798000	6802000	And then we had some pretty stellar games like Trials of Mana or Second Edition 3.
6802000	6803000	You know, and those remakes.
6803000	6807000	And of course, some of the older Final Fantasy games got remakes some times ago,
6807000	6809000	for better or for worse.
6809000	6812000	But Forever Entertainment has gone into agreement to remake something.
6812000	6813000	We don't know what it is.
6813000	6815000	There's a lot of whisper.
6815000	6820000	Maybe is it Chrono Trigger Cross?
6820000	6824000	Because Square hasn't visited that in a while.
6824000	6829000	There was the Chrono Trigger, like, mobile phone iPad version.
6829000	6831000	They did do that.
6831000	6837000	But I don't know if that's what they want the final note on Chrono Trigger to be.
6837000	6839000	That might be reaching a little bit.
6839000	6842000	I don't know what other Square Enix IPs it could be.
6842000	6843000	I'm sure everybody has their...
6843000	6847000	I've got to look at chat here in a minute because I'm sure they've got some comments.
6847000	6851000	But some other points here from Forever Entertainment.
6851000	6856000	The remakes will have new visuals, but the same gameplay and scenario from the original versions.
6856000	6860000	Over 50% of sales will go to Forever Entertainment.
6860000	6864000	And Forever Entertainment recently did that Panzer Dragoon remake,
6864000	6868000	which wasn't received super well when it first came out,
6868000	6871000	but I think it got better with some patches.
6871000	6875000	So that's where they've kind of set the bar.
6875000	6879000	PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC for the Panzer Dragoon remake.
6879000	6884000	And there is going to be a Panzer Dragoon 2 Zwei remake in 2021.
6884000	6889000	They also have remade House of the Dead and House of the Dead 2 or are remaking those, I guess.
6889000	6893000	So they're very busy in the remake department.
6893000	6897000	Folks in chat saying Einhänder. Why not?
6897000	6901000	No, don't ruin Einhänder.
6901000	6904000	Bobby Blackpool says Ur-Guys remake.
6904000	6909000	But it seems like it's got to be more than one game.
6909000	6911000	Because it says a franchise.
6911000	6914000	So there's more than one game that we're talking about.
6914000	6915000	Toeball.
6915000	6919000	I think there only was a Toeball number two. Was there a Toeball number one?
6919000	6922000	No, there's a one. You can't have a two without a one.
6922000	6924000	I don't know if gaming always works like that.
6924000	6927000	Parasite Eve is a good guess by Black Wolf.
6927000	6929000	That is a good guess.
6929000	6932000	Because there were two, at least, of those games, right?
6932000	6935000	Didn't they do something on the Vita, though, with that too?
6935000	6938000	I think they did. I think it had a totally different name, though.
6938000	6941000	Ooh, yes. Yes, ActDeft. Yes, yes, yes.
6942000	6946000	ActDeft says, I want Chocobo Racing. Yes to that.
6946000	6948000	Although I think there was only one release of that.
6948000	6951000	I hope it's not like Chocobo Mystery Dungeon. I shouldn't say that.
6951000	6956000	Those games aren't as exciting as some of these other ones.
6956000	6960000	Bobby Blackpool says Toeball 1 was released in the US.
6960000	6964000	Toeball 2 was not, but it had the Final Fantasy 7 demo with it.
6965000	6967000	All right. So, we'll see.
6967000	6972000	I mean, we can theorize all we want, but we're just not going to know what it is.
6972000	6974000	Moving on. Loki.
6974000	6977000	Kind of going back to something I talked about earlier, right?
6977000	6979000	Yes. So, this is interesting.
6979000	6984000	Apparently, Mojang has announced that Minecraft Dungeons is going to become an arcade game.
6984000	6988000	So, this is being developed by...
6988000	6992000	Oh, who was the developer? Because I was looking them up, actually.
6992000	6998000	It's the same folks that do the extremely large Halo cabinet out there.
6998000	7001000	It's basically, I think, a division of Raw Thrills.
7001000	7004000	But, yeah, play mechanics. That's what it was.
7004000	7010000	And so, they're doing this. It's like a four-player cabinet co-op, obviously.
7010000	7015000	And what's kind of cool about it is you're also going to be able to get physical cards that go along with that.
7015000	7025000	You can scan with, apparently, some RFID that's going to allow you to basically get different power-ups and stuff like that.
7025000	7028000	So, they're going to have some sort of physical element as well.
7028000	7030000	Yeah, different physical trading cards that you'll be able to collect.
7030000	7033000	Yay. So, like Derby Owners Club cards, again?
7033000	7036000	I think so. Yeah. It's going to get new power-ups.
7036000	7037000	I love those.
7037000	7038000	That's cool.
7038000	7044000	Yeah. So, no word, obviously, when we're going to see this in arcades, because arcades are open.
7044000	7048000	Well, again, our perspective, Loki, here they're not.
7048000	7056000	But other places, remember, there's plenty of other states where just COVID is just, it's just there.
7056000	7058000	We just, we ignore it, you know?
7058000	7062000	So, arcades are open in lots of places. It's just not here.
7062000	7065000	Apparently, it says there's 60 cards to collect.
7065000	7068000	This is each player can scan up to five cards per session.
7069000	7073000	And where do we purchase these cards is what I want to know.
7073000	7074000	Do you get them out of the machine?
7074000	7077000	But, yeah, it looks interesting.
7077000	7082000	They're going to have different buttons for, like, melee, dodge, and range weapons.
7082000	7086000	Yeah. I mean, it looks just like Minecraft Dungeons.
7086000	7087000	So, that sounds like fun.
7087000	7089000	Yeah. I kind of want to play it, you know?
7089000	7095000	Well, Jay, and Bobby is reminding us that in Jason's intro, he did say stay away from it if you don't have kids.
7095000	7102000	But, you know, that's why you go to the arcade between the hours of 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. while the kids are still at school.
7102000	7104000	I used to love playing, like, Gauntlet Legends, though.
7104000	7108000	Like, I used to play Gauntlet Legends a lot, so, like, more, like, fun.
7108000	7114000	It looks like it's, like, a Gauntlet Legends-type game, but then they have minigames in there and stuff like that and different fun things like that.
7114000	7116000	I love it. I love the idea.
7116000	7117000	So, I'm down.
7117000	7118000	Yeah.
7118000	7123000	I think, Loki, you and I need to, like, if Scandia gets this, we sneak over there and play it during the day someday.
7123000	7124000	Hell, yes.
7124000	7126000	While all the kids are in school.
7126000	7129000	Exactly. I'm down. Anything to get out of work.
7129000	7131000	Awesome.
7131000	7137000	Alright, well, unfortunately for some people, their work is going to be changing pretty big and it has an impact on us.
7137000	7143000	And that is EA, of course, has made an unpopular decision for some. What a surprise.
7143000	7147000	They have delayed the next Need for Speed game.
7147000	7150000	So, they, you know, they do Need for Speed games pretty regularly.
7150000	7156000	And they said that the next Need for Speed in Battlefield games would be out in March 2022.
7156000	7159000	But EA has said, maybe not.
7159000	7165000	We're going to be delaying Need for Speed so that Criterion Games can actually help EA Dice on Battlefield.
7165000	7173000	And that has people feeling a certain some kind of way, is that their speed racing game is being put on hold for the shooty shooty bang bang game.
7173000	7176000	That has people feeling all sorts of things.
7177000	7184000	But I think the reality is Battlefield sells more copies than Need for Speed does traditionally.
7184000	7188000	So that is why it is. And you have to release the Need for Speed game last year.
7188000	7191000	So, I mean, they release Battlefield games all the time.
7191000	7196000	But anyway, and I think it's also the pandemic is probably hugely to blame for this.
7196000	7198000	Right. And this came up not just on Bobby's show.
7198000	7204000	We were talking about it too last week about the whole fact that it's it's harder to make a game during a pandemic.
7204000	7208000	I mean, yes, Zoom does a lot. Yes, you can use a lot of virtual meeting spaces.
7208000	7212000	You can do a lot of things virtually. You even have virtual whiteboard softwares and things like that.
7212000	7223000	Now, the fact of the matter is it's just harder to do it in this space than it is to do in person with those and everything that it can bring you there in person.
7223000	7229000	There's a lot of industries that they can make working at home work, but it would be better if it could be in person.
7229000	7238000	And I think this is just, you know, when those dates were initially projected, who would have thought that we'd be sitting here, you know, during this whole pandemic?
7238000	7240000	So I think that is what's really to blame.
7240000	7248000	It's just some people are going to say, well, that was a choice to, you know, delay Need for Speed and prioritize Battlefield.
7248000	7251000	That's where people are going to have the problem. And you know what?
7251000	7259000	If they delayed Battlefield and prioritize Need for Speed, there would have also been people that would have had a problem, which would have been the other half.
7259000	7266000	So anyway, no other real details about either game at this time.
7266000	7278000	But I imagine as June and whatever skeleton of E3 is left in June, we'll see more details on what this has in store, the new Battlefield game, and get a date.
7278000	7280000	Probably not so much the Need for Speed game.
7280000	7285000	Maybe we'd hear about that closer to a Game Awards type of time frame, or maybe just next year.
7285000	7293000	Maybe they're just going to delay it to next holiday at this point, which very well could be to take full advantage of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X graphics.
7293000	7298000	Dartitsia does point out, well, didn't they just acquire the dirt developers?
7298000	7303000	I did enjoy Hot Pursuit Remastered, especially with the new customization update up now.
7303000	7310000	So maybe EA is looking at it that way, too. It's like, well, maybe we got Codemasters doing a thing so we can put off Need for Speed.
7310000	7318000	Maybe. I mean, yeah, maybe they would be kind of competing with themselves in that sense.
7318000	7323000	But I think there are different types of games. You have more of a sim racing game versus a more of an arcade racing game.
7323000	7332000	I don't know. I think even the last Need for Speed before the remaster of Hot Pursuit, which I think was better than the one before it.
7332000	7340000	The one before that, though, like, I don't remember what it was, The Chase, or I don't remember what the subtitle was, but wasn't very good.
7340000	7351000	I know that. So give it more time. I'd rather be good because obviously they release it now and then there's a road map of what they're going to fix.
7351000	7359000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I just played Dirt 5 via Game Pass. It looks pretty on Xbox Series X, which is funny to say about a game called Dirt.
7359000	7366000	That's true. It's probably a name they should reevaluate, but I guess, hey, if they've got five games in the series, it's doing well.
7366000	7368000	Yeah, it's pretty iconic at this point.
7368000	7377000	Yeah, at this point, it's just funny that it's called Dirt. All right, this game is dirt. Anyway, let's get to the mailbag. Your opinions and your thoughts. Definitely not dirt.
7377000	7383000	Every week we invite your emails. Participate at orangeloungeradio.com and we read some of our favorites here on air.
7383000	7390000	We did one earlier in the show that was addressed to Shane. This one is not addressed to Shane. It's addressed to all of us because it starts, hey all.
7390000	7395000	So let's get to this email. Hey all, Ziba here. Good to hear from Ziba via email.
7395000	7404000	I wanted to share an amazing experience that I had in Final Fantasy 14 last Saturday. Normally my free company does maps or mount farming on Saturdays.
7404000	7411000	However, my free company leader saw an advertisement shout for a Little Mermaid production that a roleplay free company was doing.
7411000	7420000	Yes, you heard right, a production of the Little Mermaid. Not knowing what to expect, we all agreed to go. It was by far the best thing I have seen in an MMO.
7420000	7432000	They decorated their free company estate to make it look like a stage. They had a huge coral tabletop decoration in front of the stage and the maximum amount of large aquariums spread throughout the room with numerous fish in them.
7432000	7441000	They also had ambient water sounds playing. The cast all had armor glamors that look like each character. Ariel's father was a shirtless dragoon with a trident, which was great.
7441000	7454000	For the production itself, each cast member said their lines using slash yell. Their lines were directly taken from the movie in Broadway play. For the songs, they gave out a watch together link that had a YouTube video playing the music.
7454000	7465000	As you had this playing alongside the game, the cast would do a bunch of emotes in sync with the music. Also, they had two blue mages on either side of the stage doing the water and lightning effects.
7465000	7480000	For the scene changes from underwater and land, they had someone in charge of changing the wall color and lighting. For the kiss the girls scene, they had all of us go down to the basement where they had another area all decorated.
7480000	7494000	The audience was all asked to do the slash dote emote to convince Eric to kiss Ariel. For those who don't know, the slash dote emote is an emote that makes your character blow a kiss and a cartoon heart floats to where you target.
7494000	7507000	When the production ended, the character that played Ariel was sitting on a mermaid hot tub where you could take screenshots with her and sign the guestbook on your way out. This is like next level. This is next level, but I love it. I fucking love it.
7507000	7518000	The whole thing was truly amazing. I never thought I'd ever watch something like this in an MMO. I have always been interested in being a spectator during a roleplay session, but nothing like this.
7518000	7533000	Apparently, The Little Mermaid wasn't their first production. In the past, they've done Sweeney Todd, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Beauty and the Beast, and a handful of others. At the end of the month, they're doing a production of Labyrinth, and I can't wait to see it.
7533000	7542000	For those interested, the Final Fantasy XIV server is Mateus, which is on the Crystal Data Center, which is where I am not. Womp womp.
7542000	7556000	I'm looking forward to when we can travel between data centers, me too, so everyone can have a chance to experience their productions. Have any of you ever had an amazing experience similar to this in a game or MMO? Thanks, Ziba.
7557000	7569000	Nothing can compare to that. I wonder if there's got to be a YouTube that somebody put together, like a compilation of the whole thing. Not just the live sing-along bit of it, but somebody had to have recorded that. That's pretty amazing.
7569000	7585000	And I remember I saw somebody do... I think it was in an early... Not in Final Fantasy XIV 1.0, but I think right when Realm Reborn first came out, somebody redid the opera scene for Final Fantasy VI, but they did it in Final Fantasy XIV. Maybe it was all the way back in XI.
7585000	7601000	I can't remember. It's been so long. It's probably been done in both, honestly, and I'd always thought that was pretty cool, but yeah. Have you ever done... I mean, you played XI for a while, and you've dabbled in some MMOs. Do you ever remember an experience that was just so immersive like this?
7601000	7624000	Yeah, no. Me neither. Bobby Blackwell says, we used bards in EverQuest and musicians or entertainers in Star Wars Galaxies to do concerts and performances. Yeah, I've heard of that. There's a lot of that that happens in XIV too now, like right in the main plazas of like Gridania or Limsa Lominsa. Like, there will be bands that get together and play songs because playing instruments is a thing in the game now.
7624000	7641000	I don't think you have to be a bard to do it, but it helps, I guess. But there's all sorts of musical instruments you can play. It's really silly and fun. I will say this, Ziba, to try to humor your question, and you're probably familiar with this as a Final Fantasy XIV player, but I don't think everybody is.
7641000	7659000	I would say those weddings that they do or the ceremonies of eternal bonding, because that is how Final Fantasy XIV sidestepped the apparently controversial issue of same-sex marriage, which I get it. Japanese culture isn't in the same place we are, and even we aren't perfect when it comes to that stuff.
7659000	7676000	So you can do the ceremony of eternal bonding. And I remember the first time I went to one of those, because the game kind of has it all built in. They have a to-do ceremony about it, and these cutscenes where the characters like fly up into the air and kiss and grow wings and they're spinning. It's really cute.
7676000	7693000	And the whole thing is staged. You have to reserve a spot at this cathedral in-game, and you get the place to yourself for like 45 minutes to do the ceremony. You send invites to your friends that you want to be able to go, and they can actually participate, and it's pretty next level.
7693000	7708000	So like, as really silly as this story sounds that Ziba's telling about the lengths that people are going to to do this in-game, Final Fantasy XIV has kind of set the tone, even amongst the official stuff they've done.
7708000	7730000	And I bet Yoshi P, if he knew about this, would fucking love it. Like, he probably can't go on the record and say it because, you know, copyright issues. Do they have an official license to be doing that? Probably not. So I doubt any of the XIV team can officially acknowledge that stuff, but you bet if they've got wind of it, they probably think it's fucking funny.
7730000	7734000	Like in a good way, in a good way. Laughing with it, not at it.
7734000	7747000	Yeah, and S21 on her map brings up, you know, something else that is very true and a matter of fact with these MMOs is that the funerals in MMOs for IRL players that pass away are really special. I remember ones in WoW and EverQuest.
7747000	7757000	And yeah, that's a lot more difficult, but you know, the bonds that you build with people in games, especially like, you know, folks that you raid with, you're there every Wednesday night, you know?
7757000	7775000	And, you know, like I do this show every week on Sundays. And I had another show, Horde House, for several years that was about Warcraft. And I remember a listener passed away that was somebody that would, you know, tune into the show pretty regular and somebody that I interacted with on Twitch.
7775000	7788000	And that hit us all like right in the feels, so to speak, you know, and I'd feel the same way. I know this is really dark. I'm sorry, but I feel the same way if like one of our Sunday regulars suddenly stopped coming and it was because of a reason like that.
7788000	7813000	I would be very torn up, you know? And so we get close with the people that we hang out with regularly and things like that. So I'm not surprised that, you know, these big to do's when it comes to things like funerals are as, I guess, impressive in the context of what you can do with an MMO and what it kind of means to people and stuff.
7813000	7821000	It doesn't really surprise me. Anyway, back to on a lighter note, as are weddings, as are the RP events and things of that nature as well.
7821000	7834000	So Bobby Black Wolf is talking about how he wrote songs for EverQuest and they played it playing the loot spell and then typing really fast. And they travel around to do concerts.
7834000	7850000	We even went into the dark elf town where all the NPCs were KOS of our characters to do a secret concert in the city. We had to get smuggled in by the dark elf RP guild with invisible spells and distractions of the NPCs. That's great.
7850000	7862000	You know, but that's, yeah, that's how you know a game really has got a fan base. When you've got like multiple people trying to do these like crazy things and really push the limits and just for the fun of it, really.
7862000	7871000	So thanks for the email, Ziba. I love that. And I got to seek that out on YouTube and see if they capture because unfortunately, I'm not on the Crystal Data Center.
7871000	7880000	But, you know, again, like you said, hopefully in the next expansion, they say they're going to be working on those cross realm visits so that we can do things like that.
7880000	7896000	I just I wonder if at some point the housing district hits a limit, because they do. There's also, you know, I haven't seen those RP events, but Ziba and I know they got to be on your data center to are those hot tub events.
7896000	7901000	And y'all know what kind of RP happens there.
7901000	7921000	And that is, that is a thing. Hey, hey, give a man an internet, and he'll put porn on it. Okay, so like that's, that's it. Like it's so so yeah, that all that happens but I know some of those events can get really really really really crowded, so I be interesting kind of stress
7921000	7933000	test and that whole thing. Anyway, thanks for the email, Ziba. If you guys have an email for us, participate at orangelandrado.com is the place to send us an email. I love that. Hey, if you got a story about an MMO event, I'd love to hear that as well.
7933000	7935000	All right.
7935000	7949000	Now's the part of the show where we get to last minute stories, and if you guys have any questions for us or further comment in our chat room twitch.tv slash vog network, why we'll get to those as well but Loki I'll check in with you for some last minute stories.
7949000	7954000	I don't have anything. Oh, yeah, it was it was a little bit slower of a week wasn't it.
7954000	7962000	Yeah, pretty much was any game saw on the agenda like games that you're like meaning to check out you're trying to get around to here pretty soon.
7962000	7969000	Not really like there isn't anything on my radar that's really kind of coming out that I'm looking forward to.
7969000	7983000	I don't know, I just know I need to work on more of mine, I've, I've been hesitating to try to split the audio engine in mind to be able to allow for more music to be crammed in.
7983000	7990000	Because it's going to be a pain in the ass. So I've been just hesitating to do that. I know I probably can.
7990000	8000000	And if I do that, then I have to go get some more music to put in the game. So we'll see. But that's what I'm basically you got to use use all that money you're getting from the game that's out there now.
8000000	8004000	Yeah, all of that money.
8004000	8015000	Lucky to break even break, but you didn't. Well, did you. Oh yeah, because you had to pay the musicians right and you did contract out some of that stuff so well fingers crossed.
8015000	8027000	Yeah, it's fine. Well I bet when you get those physical additions going I mean I know you're not going to sell those much of a profit, but yeah, we'll get some money from that with the NES I think a lot of people more interested in physical stuff anyways
8027000	8032000	they're not interested in ROM so it's understandable.
8032000	8045000	And that's why I'm like thinking well do I want to do like a, like a Kickstarter or something like that I may end up doing that because I've seen a lot of people even like very small scale stuff for physical editions will do Kickstarter, but I just have
8045000	8058000	to figure out like, you know, what do you need to account for for the fees and taxes and you can always set the Kickstarter at, you know, what you have 12 cartridges now right so let's say you sell those for 50 bucks a pop.
8058000	8068000	That's what 600 bucks. So you set the Kickstarter at 600 bucks, you know account for the cartridges you have now and then anything else that people pre order on top of that is a bonus, you know, and then tells you have any of those cartridges
8068000	8070000	you need to find.
8070000	8078000	Yeah, so I may end up doing something like that and then later on down the road whenever they launch that new retroverse or whatever thing that they're going to have.
8078000	8090000	Where it's basically like they'll make them as, as they sell, and it's just more of like you sign in licensing deal and then they, they pay you know whatever on, you know, certain amount of money from each one of those.
8090000	8104000	That's cool. Do that now to worry about like maintaining inventory on that stuff. It'd be kind of cool though the next time we actually do like, you know, one of those Sacramento indie game festival things and stuff like that I can actually showcase something
8104000	8119000	and go there. So that'd be fun. Thank you. And then, and then I do want to finish up my game now so I can work on something else, I may end up doing another Nintendo game. I have an idea for like a roguelike game but I don't know that that's, I don't know.
8119000	8122000	I could do that. We'll see.
8122000	8129000	I have an idea though what I could do for that but it is a little complicated. So we'll see. But, yeah, it'll be fun.
8129000	8141000	All right, well we're not getting a lot of comments from our chat specific to the roundtable and Alan just finished dinner and just came over here to set it down so I think I think I'm ready to wrap up Loki, I know it's a little bit shorter time.
8141000	8144000	So we still have two hours so we did a good job. Yeah.
8144000	8153000	Anyway, um, thank you, Shane for sitting in at the top of the show tonight I doubt he's still out there listening but he's probably doing homework but I want to thank him for filling in last minute again tonight.
8153000	8163000	DarkSakura will be back with us next week as will you Loki of course, as will I and we'll talk about whatever happens in gaming next week. Of course I want to wrap up and get everybody's final thoughts.
8163000	8176000	Before I do that, I want to thank you guys for listening to Orange Lounge Radio tonight. If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, please help us spread the word, a nice little like social media tweet share type of thing goes an awful long way a five star review on iTunes
8176000	8189000	or wherever you found this show auto hosts on vogue I can't emphasize how helpful that is. And, yeah, spreading the word, because we want to get more voices here but we can't put the voices out there if they're not here so anything you guys can do to help us
8189000	8199000	promote much appreciated I'm really excited for conventions to come back because I want to get more tables at local convention stuff, because I think that's the best way to get new people is just you have to, you know, put yourself right in front of them
8199000	8208000	and get them to sub on the phone while they're right or follow on the phone while they're right there, you know, so, yeah, looking forward to conventions coming back fingers crossed fingers crossed.
8208000	8221000	But otherwise that's going to do it. If you want to go the extra mile and do financial support, you certainly don't have to but we do have a shop with some merchandise like shirts and things like that go over to vogue network.com slash shop, if you're so inclined
8221000	8226000	and check out what we have for sale there some stickers and some shirts and some fun things like that.
8226000	8232000	Okay, let's get our final thoughts, Loki, I will start with you your final thought.
8232000	8237000	My final thought is, hopefully I finished up this tree this week because it's, it's huge.
8237000	8241000	All right. And my final thought is these tacos look delicious.
8242000	8254000	It's taco Sunday here at the Roberts and husband household. So I'm very, very excited about that. All right, that's it. Have a great week everybody happy gaming we'll see you in seven days to do it all over again.
8254000	8256000	Good night. Bye.
