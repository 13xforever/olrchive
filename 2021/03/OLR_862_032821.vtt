00:00.000 --> 00:13.520
This week, I learned that the PlayStation Store is still available for PSPs, PSVitas,

00:13.520 --> 00:17.600
and PS3s, which make Sony way more legacy compatible than any other console manufacturer,

00:17.600 --> 00:18.600
at least until this summer.

00:18.600 --> 00:22.080
On a related note, if you still have a PSP or PSVita, please check its battery.

00:22.080 --> 00:25.380
There were reports of battery swelling sometime back and now is still as good a time as any

00:25.380 --> 00:27.080
to make sure that yours hasn't.

00:27.080 --> 00:29.820
Swelling batteries are an awful chemical and or fire hazard.

00:29.820 --> 00:31.380
This is one story of the gaming world that was.

00:31.380 --> 00:34.380
Join your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki for more on this and the rest of

00:34.380 --> 00:37.780
the week's gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.780 --> 00:42.340
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

00:42.340 --> 00:43.340
Welcome back.

00:43.340 --> 00:46.340
It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:46.340 --> 00:54.620
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again here with episode number 862 of

00:54.620 --> 00:59.040
our show for this March the 28th of 2021.

00:59.040 --> 01:04.380
My name is Rob Roberts and sadly not joining me tonight, Dark Sakura or Jamie Sommers.

01:04.380 --> 01:05.680
She is not here.

01:05.680 --> 01:06.680
Good news and bad news.

01:06.680 --> 01:10.320
The good news is she got the vaccine yesterday.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.320
She got her first shot.

01:11.320 --> 01:12.740
She got the Pfizer shot.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.440
And so that's great news.

01:14.440 --> 01:19.640
The bad news is she's having some side effects where she's kind of headachy and fatigue.

01:19.640 --> 01:23.940
So she thought it would be best that she sit tonight show tonight's show out.

01:23.940 --> 01:28.680
But again, you know, even though there are side effects to the vaccine, sometimes people

01:28.680 --> 01:29.680
get them.

01:29.680 --> 01:30.680
Sometimes people don't.

01:30.680 --> 01:35.100
We would still always encourage you to get the vaccine and help us end the COVID pandemic

01:35.100 --> 01:38.040
because whatever she's going through right now is certainly a lot better than actually

01:38.040 --> 01:40.060
having COVID itself.

01:40.060 --> 01:41.920
So anyway, say hello as well.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.120
Joining me every week on the show.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.120
Tech master.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.120
Loki.

01:45.120 --> 01:46.120
Hello.

01:46.120 --> 01:47.120
Hi, Loki.

01:47.120 --> 01:49.120
Hey, how's it going?

01:49.120 --> 01:50.120
Good.

01:50.120 --> 01:51.440
What's what's the game playing behind you tonight?

01:51.440 --> 01:52.440
I'm trying to figure it out.

01:52.440 --> 01:55.520
And it's like I can't see the main character very well.

01:55.520 --> 01:58.280
It's like I'm having a hard time telling what it is.

01:58.280 --> 02:01.200
I'm sure if you just looked at the enemies, you'd figure it out.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.460
I can't see the enemies.

02:02.460 --> 02:03.460
They're not showing.

02:03.460 --> 02:06.000
Oh, it's too far away for me to really make them out.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.400
Well, it's entered the Gungeon.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.040
Oh, it is interesting.

02:10.040 --> 02:11.380
OK, nice.

02:11.380 --> 02:16.000
Is that a selection due to the PlayStation, whatever they're calling it?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.880
Stay at home and we'll give you free games thing that's going on right now.

02:18.880 --> 02:22.920
No, it's because I was going to do Katamari because they have the shirt on, but they realized

02:22.920 --> 02:24.000
they'd already done that.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
So gotcha.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.240
I'm going to do enter the Gungeon.

02:26.240 --> 02:29.520
Well, that's if he didn't say you'd already done it, nobody probably would have picked

02:29.520 --> 02:30.520
up on it.

02:30.520 --> 02:31.520
So.

02:31.520 --> 02:32.520
All right.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.960
Anyway, I do think it's kind of funny, though.

02:33.960 --> 02:37.560
I know we'd kind of like joked about it on the show previously, but it is kind of interesting

02:37.560 --> 02:39.920
that you got your Johnson and Johnson shot.

02:39.920 --> 02:45.000
I got my Moderna shot and confirmed Jamie got the Pfizer shot this week.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.120
So we have one of each in the house.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.360
The Holy Trinity.

02:49.360 --> 02:50.360
Exactly.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.040
The Holy Trinity is complete.

02:52.040 --> 02:56.240
Anyway, I also want to say a big hello to everybody in our chat room, because we do

02:56.240 --> 03:01.800
tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network

03:01.800 --> 03:05.400
every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby

03:05.400 --> 03:06.760
Blackwell show.

03:06.760 --> 03:10.460
Bobby's in our chat right now saying, oh, man, I totally forgot to remind everyone it's

03:10.460 --> 03:12.200
close to the end of the month.

03:12.200 --> 03:17.040
So check your data cap and download game pass games or the play at home games before the

03:17.040 --> 03:18.480
end of the month.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.080
Very true point.

03:20.080 --> 03:24.040
I know for myself, I want to pre download hopefully I have the bandwidth for it.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.040
I should.

03:25.040 --> 03:30.160
But we're we're cutting it close now that Alan's doing the streaming all the time.

03:30.160 --> 03:36.080
But I want to get the Outriders pre install before it unlocks on the first if I can fit

03:36.080 --> 03:38.960
that into this month's bandwidth, that would be great.

03:38.960 --> 03:40.880
Is that a game that's on your radar at all?

03:40.880 --> 03:41.880
Loki?

03:41.880 --> 03:42.880
No.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.080
Oh, well, that's too bad.

03:44.080 --> 03:48.200
Is there anything anything upcoming that's on your radar?

03:48.200 --> 03:49.200
Not really.

03:49.200 --> 03:50.200
Actually.

03:50.200 --> 03:58.280
Well, you know what's going off the radar is Mario.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.360
And I think this is really funny where the Internet's going with this, because, you know,

04:01.360 --> 04:05.240
this is the week we're just days away from what the Internet is now calling the death

04:05.240 --> 04:13.080
of Mario or Mario's execution, because all of course, Mario 35 is getting pulled.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.760
Super Mario All Stars 3D is getting pulled.

04:15.760 --> 04:20.640
And, you know, all those limited time games are going to disappear as of March 31st, because

04:20.640 --> 04:25.400
Nintendo done told you it's limited and they meant it unless you had a retail code.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.480
Those will still continue to work past March 31st.

04:27.480 --> 04:31.000
Yeah, like, I don't know, I already have them.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.920
So it's fine.

04:32.920 --> 04:37.200
I didn't really play Mario 35 too much, but the other ones already have.

04:37.200 --> 04:41.880
So in fact, we actually picked up because, like I said, my kids were as we mentioned,

04:41.880 --> 04:46.080
I think it was last week we were talking about Shane, the shiny hunter and Pokemon

04:46.080 --> 04:47.080
journeys.

04:47.080 --> 04:48.080
Yes.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.520
So since my kids have been watching that every time they go over to the grandmother's house,

04:50.520 --> 04:57.240
I went ahead and picked up Pokemon sword for my son so he can play through the campaign

04:57.240 --> 05:00.420
that's basically shown off in the the show.

05:00.420 --> 05:04.240
So I'm sure our own shiny Hunter Shane would approve of that purchase.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.240
Yeah.

05:05.240 --> 05:08.680
So yeah, I don't know.

05:08.680 --> 05:12.200
But yeah, the Mario stuff that we've already gotten all all of that.

05:12.200 --> 05:15.240
So it's not a big deal.

05:15.240 --> 05:16.360
It's still stupid, though.

05:16.360 --> 05:22.000
I have to say I was able to hold the line and I never bought Mario 3D All Stars and

05:22.000 --> 05:23.880
I'm totally okay with that decision.

05:23.880 --> 05:27.520
I did play a little bit of Mario 35 and I enjoyed that.

05:27.520 --> 05:32.480
I'm a little less irritated with that one because I can also kind of understand how

05:32.480 --> 05:35.960
the audience for that game was probably going to fade pretty quick.

05:35.960 --> 05:41.640
I think it would soften the blow an awful lot if Nintendo would announce some sort of

05:41.640 --> 05:43.000
replacement.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.640
And I'm not saying it has to be Zelda 35.

05:45.640 --> 05:52.800
But some type of, you know, Nintendo online pass or whatever game to sort of lessen the

05:52.800 --> 05:58.120
burden of or lessen the burn of losing the game that we're losing, I think would would

05:58.120 --> 06:00.400
really make people maybe a lot less angry.

06:00.400 --> 06:01.400
I don't know.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.600
Yeah, I think that would help.

06:03.600 --> 06:06.440
But like, I don't know why they're doing it in the first place.

06:06.440 --> 06:12.760
And then I think it's kind of funny is one of the things that was on there that is limited

06:12.760 --> 06:20.840
or quote unquote limited was that plane watch handheld thing and the local target that I

06:20.840 --> 06:21.840
go to.

06:21.840 --> 06:27.320
They've got like stacks of those really mean they were flying off the shelf at one time,

06:27.320 --> 06:29.740
but now they've got like at least 10 of them.

06:29.740 --> 06:30.880
So interesting.

06:30.880 --> 06:35.080
I always look at him like, nah, I don't want it.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.380
But somebody does and they're out there.

06:37.380 --> 06:41.400
I'm kind of with the break man in chat, ugh, that thing is so overpriced.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.880
Although I did see a comment from Tiger Claw earlier where he ran out and got one.

06:44.880 --> 06:48.760
So again, it's it's all about what do you want to spend your money on?

06:48.760 --> 06:52.080
You know, I buy a lot of these little tiny collectible actually I have one sitting right

06:52.080 --> 06:53.080
here.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.300
I buy a lot of these tiny collectible arcade cabinets and some would say this is a waste

06:56.300 --> 06:58.740
of money, especially when I leave it in the box like this.

06:58.740 --> 06:59.740
But I love these things.

06:59.740 --> 07:03.940
And they're about a third of the price of that Mario Game and Watch thing.

07:03.940 --> 07:07.740
But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tempted by the Mario Game and Watch.

07:07.740 --> 07:12.980
But I suppose Nintendo is going to make that decision for me when they murder Mario on

07:12.980 --> 07:13.980
in just three days.

07:13.980 --> 07:14.980
We are.

07:14.980 --> 07:15.980
We are.

07:15.980 --> 07:16.980
Dawn.

07:16.980 --> 07:17.980
Dawn of the Mario is dead day.

07:17.980 --> 07:18.980
Three.

07:18.980 --> 07:19.980
Seventy two hours remain.

07:19.980 --> 07:20.980
Right.

07:20.980 --> 07:21.980
Yep.

07:21.980 --> 07:22.980
All right.

07:22.980 --> 07:23.980
We're right around the corner.

07:23.980 --> 07:29.060
So if you do want to get them, then you probably should get them or, you know.

07:29.060 --> 07:30.060
I will be.

07:30.060 --> 07:34.900
And look, actually, ironically, I'm wearing a Mario shirt tonight, but I will be taking

07:34.900 --> 07:36.180
it off in three days.

07:36.180 --> 07:37.180
Not on stream.

07:37.180 --> 07:38.260
And we can all be thankful for that.

07:38.260 --> 07:43.020
But I will be taking it off in three days because Mario will be dead.

07:43.020 --> 07:47.180
And so I can't really wear the shirt that I've had for years and years anymore because

07:47.180 --> 07:53.320
Nintendo has decided not only is the year of Mario over, but Mario products must be

07:53.320 --> 07:57.300
over with it because that is that's how we celebrate.

07:57.300 --> 07:59.820
We celebrate with Zelda now.

07:59.820 --> 08:01.220
Is it the year of Zelda?

08:01.220 --> 08:02.220
No, Loki.

08:02.220 --> 08:03.220
It's the year of nothing.

08:03.220 --> 08:04.760
It's the year of silence.

08:04.760 --> 08:12.060
It's the year of another Nintendo Indies announcement, I'm sure, in the coming weeks, which I don't

08:12.060 --> 08:17.940
mean to shade the indie thing, but I'm just saying that, like, Nintendo is, you know,

08:17.940 --> 08:22.580
they'll probably just announce their brand new system and they're going to have those

08:22.580 --> 08:28.260
games be pack-ins or something for that or some ridiculous thing that that actually would

08:28.260 --> 08:33.100
be like, I'd be so irritated, but I would also laugh.

08:33.100 --> 08:37.820
But I think there's a lot more people who would be extremely irritated if come June,

08:37.820 --> 08:42.740
they announce a bundle and they're like, it's the Mario celebration bundle comes with 3D

08:42.740 --> 08:44.700
all stars installed on the system.

08:44.700 --> 08:47.460
No, it would be like, yeah, what was it?

08:47.460 --> 08:48.940
The one that they?

08:48.940 --> 08:49.940
Yeah.

08:50.660 --> 08:54.180
Did he ever like add, um, what was it?

08:54.180 --> 08:56.860
It was, um, galaxy two.

08:56.860 --> 08:58.540
Was that ever like DLC or anything?

08:58.540 --> 08:59.540
I can't remember.

08:59.540 --> 09:00.540
I don't think it was.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.540
No, I got that.

09:01.540 --> 09:02.540
No.

09:02.540 --> 09:03.540
Yeah.

09:03.540 --> 09:04.540
No.

09:04.540 --> 09:06.340
Nintendo has thrown galaxy two in the trash game of the year.

09:06.340 --> 09:08.620
Galaxy two is in the dumpster out back in Redmond.

09:08.620 --> 09:09.620
Right?

09:09.620 --> 09:10.620
Yeah.

09:10.620 --> 09:13.300
So yeah, I could see them doing something stupid like that.

09:13.300 --> 09:14.420
Re-releasing it again.

09:14.420 --> 09:15.420
I don't know.

09:16.420 --> 09:19.900
It's just funny because they can't manage their supply chain as it is.

09:19.900 --> 09:24.260
And now they're like not managing their digital supply chain, which really doesn't exist.

09:24.260 --> 09:28.140
I mean, it's infinite, but somehow it's not.

09:28.140 --> 09:29.140
I know.

09:29.140 --> 09:32.420
It's very interesting because Nintendo has a lot of problems with their physical supply

09:32.420 --> 09:33.420
chain.

09:33.420 --> 09:36.100
So clearly the answer is to limit their digital supply.

09:36.100 --> 09:39.500
I don't understand how they think that it's going to like devalue those things because

09:39.500 --> 09:40.980
like all their games never go on.

09:40.980 --> 09:43.000
I mean, like they hardly ever go on sale.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.160
It's frustrating because like some of the stuff that's out there, it really should go

09:47.160 --> 09:48.160
on sale.

09:48.160 --> 09:54.080
Like, like Mario tennis doesn't need to be a $60 game several years after it's come out.

09:54.080 --> 09:57.200
I mean, like it, it can drop in price.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.600
It's fine.

09:58.600 --> 10:03.240
It's just, they demand $60 for their games forever.

10:03.240 --> 10:06.400
And no, no, thank you.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.920
I'm curious.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.920
I'm curious.

10:09.920 --> 10:11.000
I'm curious in chat.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.680
How would you guys feel, cause some of you did, I only want to hear from the people that

10:14.680 --> 10:18.840
purchased Mario all stars of which there are several of you.

10:18.840 --> 10:26.280
How would you feel if Nintendo this June confirms this super Nintendo switch, whatever you want

10:26.280 --> 10:28.240
to call it, the 4k switch, whatever.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.040
It's all a rumor anyway.

10:30.040 --> 10:36.880
And as part, one of the launch titles for the switch is going to be a 4k version of

10:36.880 --> 10:40.120
Mario 3d all stars with galaxy two.

10:40.120 --> 10:41.720
How would you feel about that?

10:41.720 --> 10:46.460
Would you be happy because yay, Mario's back from the dead or would you be pissed off because

10:46.460 --> 10:50.880
I spent $60 on what I'd be, I'd, I'd be curious.

10:50.880 --> 10:51.880
Okay.

10:51.880 --> 10:52.880
I'm looking in chat.

10:52.880 --> 10:55.080
Sacred Jade says I'd still buy it.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.080
Okay.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.080
We'll see.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.320
I'm waiting for other comments to come in here.

10:58.320 --> 11:01.560
It's the, there's a little bit of a delay between the time we say things and the time

11:01.560 --> 11:03.400
our chat room sees them there.

11:03.400 --> 11:06.120
So a pixel pockets in chat.

11:06.120 --> 11:07.920
I love the honest answer.

11:07.920 --> 11:14.880
Pixel pockets and Chad says I would buy it and feel like a clown, especially like right

11:14.880 --> 11:22.120
after like, there is a clown Mario turned around and just like re-released it.

11:22.120 --> 11:26.000
Not even like six months after it's like, Oh, we, we, we took it off the market, but

11:26.000 --> 11:28.500
now we took it, put, brought it back.

11:28.500 --> 11:31.280
Like I don't see the point.

11:31.280 --> 11:32.840
I don't get why it's limited.

11:32.840 --> 11:37.160
Like the Mario 35 understand because you know, network resources and stuff like that.

11:37.160 --> 11:43.880
But a game you've literally produced, why are you not offering that anymore?

11:43.880 --> 11:45.320
Like that is stupid.

11:45.320 --> 11:48.640
Like you could do like limited time DLC or something like that.

11:48.640 --> 11:49.640
Like they did with smash brothers.

11:49.640 --> 11:55.060
Hey, we're going to throw in this piece of deals that you get a free piranha plant character.

11:55.060 --> 12:00.000
If you purchase it within the first, you know, month or so, like that makes sense, but just

12:00.000 --> 12:02.480
like, Oh, well, you didn't buy it within the timeframe.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.360
Well, we're just going to take it off the market.

12:04.360 --> 12:09.560
You should have bought it because you know, you belong to our Nintendo cult.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.380
You buy all the things like that.

12:11.380 --> 12:12.380
It's stupid.

12:12.380 --> 12:17.080
Like it's absolutely stupid, especially like, like, let's just look at COVID and stuff.

12:17.080 --> 12:20.800
Like not everybody has like a lot of resources to buy these games and what if someone actually

12:20.800 --> 12:25.560
wanted to buy one, but they're waiting to get their tax refund back or something like

12:25.560 --> 12:26.560
that.

12:26.560 --> 12:27.560
It's like, Oh, sorry.

12:27.560 --> 12:28.560
Too late.

12:28.560 --> 12:29.560
Too late for that.

12:29.560 --> 12:30.560
You know, I have this.

12:30.560 --> 12:31.560
Yeah.

12:31.560 --> 12:32.560
Nintendo doesn't accept stimulus money.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.600
They only accept tax refunds.

12:34.600 --> 12:35.600
I don't get it.

12:35.600 --> 12:36.600
Whatever.

12:36.600 --> 12:37.600
You know what?

12:37.600 --> 12:38.600
It's fine.

12:38.600 --> 12:44.640
I, they can make their own business decisions, I guess, but like I don't get it.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.520
I don't understand the, the basis of it.

12:47.520 --> 12:48.520
I don't either.

12:48.520 --> 12:53.640
Um, uh, some other comments in chat, it seems like generally across the board, people are

12:53.640 --> 12:59.600
like, I hate it, but I'd still buy it, which is, I'm not dragging anyone, but this is,

12:59.640 --> 13:02.880
this is the way many gamers approach Nintendo.

13:02.880 --> 13:05.520
I hate it, but I buy it.

13:05.520 --> 13:09.320
They know that like, they're all, what are you going to do about it?

13:09.320 --> 13:10.320
Hmm.

13:10.320 --> 13:11.320
All right.

13:11.320 --> 13:13.020
You know, we can do whatever we want.

13:13.020 --> 13:15.320
You don't like the decision, but you're still going to do it anyways.

13:15.320 --> 13:16.320
You're still going to buy it.

13:16.320 --> 13:17.320
No, I'm not.

13:17.320 --> 13:18.320
Loki.

13:18.320 --> 13:19.320
I did it.

13:19.320 --> 13:20.320
I did it.

13:20.320 --> 13:21.320
Loki.

13:21.320 --> 13:22.320
I stuck with my decision.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.320
I want a star.

13:23.320 --> 13:24.320
Yeah.

13:24.320 --> 13:25.320
But you're, you're one person in the majority.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.320
No.

13:26.320 --> 13:27.320
SSJ 100.

13:27.320 --> 13:28.320
Matt did it too.

13:28.320 --> 13:29.320
We are two people.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.040
All right.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.040
All right.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.040
Well, I guess, I guess that's it.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.040
Game over.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.040
I fucking showed them.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.040
Didn't I?

13:36.040 --> 13:37.040
All right.

13:37.040 --> 13:44.720
SSJ 100, SSJ 100, Matt and I exist in a secret cult and we meet biweekly on Saturdays and

13:44.720 --> 13:48.800
in our cult, we believe that Mario is still alive.

13:48.800 --> 13:53.400
Even though Nintendo has killed him, Mario is secretly alive and he's living on an island

13:53.400 --> 13:55.400
in the Bahamas.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.260
And he's, he's a okay.

13:57.260 --> 13:58.440
So that's where we're at.

13:58.560 --> 14:05.480
They're just going to sell the collection as NFTs in like April, so that's fine.

14:05.480 --> 14:06.480
I hate it.

14:06.480 --> 14:07.480
All right.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.380
Now I really want to change the topic.

14:09.380 --> 14:11.120
Let's get to our kickoff topic tonight.

14:11.120 --> 14:15.640
I don't know if you think that was it, but no, we just went off on something else.

14:15.640 --> 14:18.780
Uh, Loki, what do we really want to talk about at the start of tonight's show?

14:18.780 --> 14:22.200
So let's talk about the significant change coming to Xbox live.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.160
I mean, I'm sorry, Xbox network.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.160
That's it.

14:25.160 --> 14:26.160
That's the change.

14:26.160 --> 14:27.380
They're just changing the name.

14:27.380 --> 14:29.420
So Xbox live, it's gone.

14:29.420 --> 14:33.780
It's gone like Mario and it's going to be now Xbox network.

14:33.780 --> 14:35.280
So maybe that's what's happening.

14:35.280 --> 14:38.300
Maybe Mario is getting a brand new name and so it's no longer Mario.

14:38.300 --> 14:42.620
It's going to be, um, you know, he's going to assign himself a new name.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.940
He'll be a mark now.

14:44.940 --> 14:46.220
Look here.

14:46.220 --> 14:50.820
I just, I really quit cause I'm getting dragged in chat because a tiger claw on chat says

14:50.820 --> 14:54.500
knowing Rob, he'll buy that legendary edition of the mass effect trilogy.

14:54.500 --> 14:57.580
And Bobby Black Wolf says it's Mario, not mass effect.

14:57.580 --> 15:02.700
Um, look, I'm allowed to be a hypocrite on my own show if I want to be, uh, and to quote

15:02.700 --> 15:06.540
RuPaul from this week's episode of drag race, and I apologize to the podcast listeners.

15:06.540 --> 15:10.060
He's not going to be able to hear this one, but if you saw the episode, you'll know what

15:10.060 --> 15:16.200
I'm talking about anyway for you listeners to quote RuPaul's drag race this week.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.200
Thank you.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.500
All right, go ahead.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.500
Loki.

15:19.500 --> 15:20.500
All right.

15:20.500 --> 15:21.500
So anyways.

15:21.500 --> 15:26.980
Um, so yeah, so the rebranding basically, uh, they're saying that Xbox network is going

15:26.980 --> 15:33.180
to be, what's going to be referred to as now, uh, refers the underlying Xbox online services,

15:33.180 --> 15:39.740
uh, which was updated in the Microsoft service agreement and the update from Xbox live to

15:39.740 --> 15:47.500
Xbox network is intended to distinguish the underlying services from Xbox live gold memberships.

15:47.500 --> 15:48.500
That cool.

15:48.500 --> 15:51.220
You change, you're calling it something else.

15:51.220 --> 15:55.540
Um, other than that, it doesn't seem to be changing much of anything.

15:55.540 --> 15:58.080
So that's it.

15:58.080 --> 16:01.620
It's just called something different now.

16:01.620 --> 16:07.980
And Xbox network, I mean, I guess, I don't know, it doesn't have the same ring to it,

16:07.980 --> 16:10.540
but cool.

16:10.540 --> 16:14.560
It really doesn't have the same ring as Xbox live.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.580
Like Xbox live was kind of catchy.

16:16.580 --> 16:21.940
Um, I, it is, I don't know, to me, this kind of strikes me as like, what an interesting

16:21.940 --> 16:23.860
time to make a pivot.

16:23.860 --> 16:27.180
I would have thought that if they were going to be rebranding an Xbox network, they might

16:27.180 --> 16:32.160
kind of do that as they're launching a new console, but it's also kind of one of those

16:32.160 --> 16:33.860
why now sorts of things.

16:33.860 --> 16:39.540
But I also sort of like get it based on the fact that, you know, Microsoft has set this

16:39.540 --> 16:45.660
goal for themselves where they are not necessarily a device in your living room, but they are

16:45.700 --> 16:51.340
a platform, they are a, you know, play, they are a, um, delivery service for games.

16:51.340 --> 16:54.940
Uh, and you know, games pass is really your game passes, you mean is really where they're

16:54.940 --> 16:56.800
putting a lot of their investment.

16:56.800 --> 17:01.980
So I think to maybe rebrand as Xbox network kind of separates them from being something

17:01.980 --> 17:06.940
that is, you know, traditionally been a very console centric thing because obviously Xbox

17:06.940 --> 17:12.000
is something that, um, we are seeing on PCs as well.

17:12.000 --> 17:19.860
And we even see it on PlayStation and Nintendo switch what log into Minecraft with your Xbox

17:19.860 --> 17:21.640
network account.

17:21.640 --> 17:27.200
It's probably because see, the reason they've got a rebranded text box network is because

17:27.200 --> 17:31.540
the next console that the release to keep in line with the confusion of their naming

17:31.540 --> 17:35.440
scheme is they'll just call the next console, the Xbox live.

17:35.440 --> 17:41.120
And then they'll just kind of, you know, cap off the confusing console series that they've

17:41.120 --> 17:43.480
had so far with their naming.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.280
So maybe that's what it's about.

17:46.280 --> 17:51.800
I can also see though, where, you know, maybe Microsoft is ready to distance themselves

17:51.800 --> 17:55.480
with some of the reputation that Xbox live has had in the past.

17:55.480 --> 18:00.440
Um, because I think we all have a horror story about playing a game on Xbox live and getting

18:00.440 --> 18:04.400
called all sorts of names that are disgusting, and I'm not going to repeat them here on this

18:04.400 --> 18:08.080
lovely program that we have, uh, especially on a Sunday.

18:08.080 --> 18:12.960
Um, but maybe Microsoft wants to separate from that a little bit.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.920
Although I completely understand.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.880
I mean, look at, look at how well that worked out for Comcast.

18:18.880 --> 18:22.640
I mean, Xfinity that that worked out so perfect, you know, they changed names.

18:22.640 --> 18:28.880
It's like, yeah, that Comcast man, they sucked, but Xfinity, they still suck under a different

18:28.880 --> 18:29.880
name.

18:29.880 --> 18:30.880
Oh yeah.

18:30.880 --> 18:31.880
Netflix going to Quickster.

18:31.880 --> 18:32.880
No problem.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.880
Everybody will embrace it.

18:34.880 --> 18:35.880
Quickster.

18:35.880 --> 18:42.880
Okay, but Quickster sounds like, you know, the flea market equivalent of the flash, which

18:42.880 --> 18:48.200
is like what you order on wish when you order the flash version of the flash.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.200
Well, what's funny.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.200
Okay.

18:50.200 --> 18:54.000
But what's funny about that whole Quickster scenario is that fucking Netflix did it anyway.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.080
They just did it a year later and didn't call it.

18:56.080 --> 19:00.120
They ended up what they sold it to dvd.com and I think, I think it's even called like

19:00.120 --> 19:01.720
DVD flicks now.

19:01.720 --> 19:06.320
Then there was an article I saw just this week about how the service sucks compared

19:06.320 --> 19:07.600
to what it used to be.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.900
Like they used to have over like 10,000 DVDs on the service and now there's not nearly

19:10.900 --> 19:11.900
as many.

19:11.900 --> 19:16.720
And for people that are super into like cult films, foreign films, old films, the really

19:16.720 --> 19:23.540
hard to find shit that never made its way to Blu-ray still, or digital still, it kind

19:23.540 --> 19:26.800
of sucks that that's fading because that was the audience that was still using that because

19:26.800 --> 19:29.600
you could find almost anything on that service.

19:29.600 --> 19:33.600
So it's just, just kind of interesting.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.920
Anyway, this wasn't supposed to be about Netflix, supposed to be about Xbox live changing their

19:36.920 --> 19:42.440
name and, and why now to change their name and will they be able to get away because

19:42.440 --> 19:47.120
I think I was just having a call with Bobby earlier tonight on his show and I think I

19:47.120 --> 19:49.100
still called it Xbox live.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.940
So I think this is going to take a little bit of time before we kind of get that name

19:51.940 --> 19:52.940
out of our mouths.

19:52.940 --> 19:53.940
I don't know.

19:53.940 --> 19:58.300
So what is Xbox live gold turn into Xbox network gold?

19:58.840 --> 19:59.840
What's the plan there?

19:59.840 --> 20:01.620
I think it's still going to be Xbox live.

20:01.620 --> 20:07.700
It's just live gold doesn't make any sense now because there really isn't anything else.

20:07.700 --> 20:09.620
You don't have live silver anymore.

20:09.620 --> 20:10.620
It's just.

20:10.620 --> 20:14.780
Well, and when are they going to just, and when are they just going to get rid of gold?

20:14.780 --> 20:16.600
I've been saying this for a long time.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.160
Like what do you, what do you get with gold?

20:18.160 --> 20:22.420
You get the free games and the ability to play online, although they're starting to

20:22.420 --> 20:27.500
dial that back because they were finally bullied into it by their user base.

20:27.500 --> 20:33.300
And honestly, I, I, I get it because you know, the PlayStation wasn't charging online.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.920
Windows store PC wasn't charging online.

20:35.920 --> 20:40.540
And so for things like Fortnite and that stuff, so, um, you know, Microsoft has finally retreated

20:40.540 --> 20:43.280
from that at least for the free to play games.

20:43.280 --> 20:46.140
Although if you want to play, I don't know, Gears or whatever online, you're still going

20:46.140 --> 20:49.500
to have to pay for the Xbox gold or shit.

20:49.500 --> 20:56.420
I've been playing a lot of dead by daylight lately on, uh, Xbox series X and I have Xbox

20:56.420 --> 21:01.300
gold thankfully, so I can still play online with strangers and get teabagged at the exit

21:01.300 --> 21:02.300
doors.

21:02.300 --> 21:06.540
So, yeah, I, I don't know why they still charge for that, especially on the console.

21:06.540 --> 21:07.780
That doesn't make any sense too.

21:07.780 --> 21:13.740
When you have like a lot of the, they've made, I don't know really why I got an Xbox series

21:13.740 --> 21:19.460
X when you think about it, because they make a hard sell for, you know, buying their console

21:19.460 --> 21:20.460
in the first place.

21:20.460 --> 21:22.680
They're most of their games are available on PC as well.

21:22.680 --> 21:25.020
And most people have a pretty decent PC.

21:25.860 --> 21:29.100
You don't have to pay for the same online service there.

21:29.100 --> 21:35.500
And it's just, there's less exclusives that are like specifically console exclusives.

21:35.500 --> 21:38.100
They're always going to be console and PC.

21:38.100 --> 21:43.500
And so it's just, it's like, they're like promoting not to buy their console.

21:43.500 --> 21:44.860
It doesn't make any sense.

21:44.860 --> 21:47.800
I just really wish they would get rid of that, but I get it.

21:47.800 --> 21:52.120
It's an income, it's a revenue stream, but it's just not something that they can charge

21:52.120 --> 21:57.200
on PC because people will be like, no, I'm just going to buy it from Steam or the Epic

21:57.200 --> 21:58.200
Games store.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.200
Yeah.

21:59.200 --> 22:05.960
I'm just, I'm not really just a big fan in general of, uh, uh, the, the, uh, that's my

22:05.960 --> 22:06.960
train of thought.

22:06.960 --> 22:07.960
Damn it.

22:07.960 --> 22:11.400
The, um, I was trying to reach out at the same time and I told her, I lost my train

22:11.400 --> 22:12.400
of thought.

22:12.400 --> 22:13.400
Anyway, go ahead.

22:13.400 --> 22:19.280
But yeah, I mean, it's just, I don't know.

22:19.280 --> 22:21.840
I don't see the point of charging for it.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.480
I think it would be, you know, if they did want to charge for it and just like roll it

22:25.480 --> 22:31.080
into games pass and let that be its thing, let just sell games pass, get rid of the Xbox

22:31.080 --> 22:33.200
live gold and then have that.

22:33.200 --> 22:36.880
And then, you know, branch that out to other platforms as well.

22:36.880 --> 22:41.220
And I think you have a winning service there, but we're just not there yet.

22:41.220 --> 22:42.220
I think.

22:42.220 --> 22:45.220
Um, I will say that I enjoy my Xbox series X.

22:45.220 --> 22:47.320
I don't regret that purchase in the slightest.

22:47.320 --> 22:50.520
The performance is so much better than the prior, you know, console.

22:50.520 --> 22:53.560
It really does feel like an upgrade and I really enjoy playing games in the living

22:53.560 --> 22:54.560
room.

22:54.560 --> 22:58.680
Um, but that's, you know, that also is just probably like my type of lifestyle.

22:58.680 --> 23:02.200
I imagine Loki, when you try to play games in the living room, you get distracted a lot

23:02.200 --> 23:08.240
by, you know, the kids, the wife, I have to, it's hooked up to my, my monitors here.

23:08.240 --> 23:09.840
So it's basically like playing on PC.

23:09.840 --> 23:10.840
Oh, okay.

23:10.840 --> 23:14.360
See, but then that makes sense where it's like, well, why bother?

23:14.360 --> 23:19.880
So, but for me, I like to get out of my office and plot my big butt on the couch and, you

23:19.880 --> 23:21.920
know, play a game in there.

23:21.920 --> 23:25.600
Um, although now I'm having this whole thing where I'm like, as much as I've invested in

23:25.600 --> 23:30.840
Dead by Daylight to this point, I'm like, maybe I should get it on PC.

23:30.840 --> 23:31.840
That might be fun.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.320
I don't know.

23:33.320 --> 23:37.520
But then I'll just get dragged by chat all over again for buying multiple copies of the

23:37.520 --> 23:38.520
same game.

23:38.520 --> 23:42.800
Does that, does the DLC port over to like, say if you buy that through the window store

23:42.800 --> 23:43.800
or something like that?

23:43.800 --> 23:44.800
No.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.760
And it's so well, okay.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.200
Yes and no.

23:48.200 --> 23:57.760
Steam, the Switch and one other, oh, Stadia, Steam, the Switch and Stadia all cross by.

23:57.760 --> 24:02.520
So if you buy DLC L1, you get it on those others within that area, but all the rest,

24:02.520 --> 24:03.520
no.

24:03.520 --> 24:09.420
And I think it is stupid that it's not cross by between window store and Xbox.

24:09.420 --> 24:10.420
Why is that?

24:10.420 --> 24:11.420
It makes no sense.

24:11.420 --> 24:12.420
It is.

24:12.420 --> 24:13.420
So that makes no sense to me.

24:13.420 --> 24:17.160
It's one of my big complaints about that game, to be honest.

24:17.160 --> 24:24.480
So anyway, Xbox Live, now Xbox Network, we'll see how long it takes us to really adapt to

24:24.480 --> 24:29.880
that change name and see, I guess in June, maybe we'll really start to see some of the

24:29.880 --> 24:33.040
marketing behind that, whether there's an E3 or not.

24:33.040 --> 24:37.120
I imagine we're going to still start to see some of the push behind, you know, what Microsoft

24:37.120 --> 24:41.000
really plans to do with that branding and how they're going to propel it forward, which

24:41.000 --> 24:44.600
I imagine will have a lot to do with cloud gaming.

24:44.600 --> 24:48.680
I expect a lot with cloud gaming to come out of Microsoft this June, but that is, I'm

24:48.680 --> 24:49.680
not going to lie.

24:49.680 --> 24:50.680
That is exciting.

24:50.680 --> 24:51.680
So, yeah.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.000
All right.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.880
Let's move on and get into how was your gaming week and the types of games that you've been

24:56.880 --> 24:57.880
playing this week.

24:57.880 --> 24:59.920
Loki, how was your gaming week?

24:59.920 --> 25:01.840
It's going to sound like a broken record.

25:01.840 --> 25:02.840
It's been the same stuff.

25:02.840 --> 25:08.240
So basically you've been playing Minecraft, still watching lots of streamers.

25:08.240 --> 25:15.000
I've gone through several different Hermitcraft streamers and just watching their content,

25:15.000 --> 25:19.160
but I've been also working on this giant tree that's on our realm.

25:19.160 --> 25:22.240
And so working on that, it's very tedious.

25:22.240 --> 25:28.620
I can see why the guy, Iskall, who does that actually in Hermitcraft takes many breaks

25:28.620 --> 25:32.420
from it because it gets very tedious and boring.

25:32.420 --> 25:35.120
So that's what I've been doing in Minecraft.

25:35.120 --> 25:41.700
I have been playing more Orna as well and then also working on the special edition Pixel

25:41.700 --> 25:42.700
Poops 2.

25:42.700 --> 25:49.560
So I've put together like six new levels so far and I've got four more at least I've planned

25:49.560 --> 25:52.520
out because I wanted to bump each world up to 10.

25:52.520 --> 25:57.640
And then I've been trying to just polish some of the code that's in there to try to get

25:57.640 --> 25:59.800
it to work how I wanted it to.

25:59.800 --> 26:02.320
And I may add another whole world to it.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.160
I haven't decided yet.

26:04.200 --> 26:09.440
The problem is I'm like running out of like unique enemies or like things I can do with

26:09.440 --> 26:11.280
since they don't really have a way.

26:11.280 --> 26:13.140
There's no projectiles or anything in the game.

26:13.140 --> 26:19.200
So it's hard to like make like a boss or like, you know, just different enemy types.

26:19.200 --> 26:25.200
It's just aside from reskinning something that's basically it all I can really do with

26:25.200 --> 26:26.200
it.

26:26.200 --> 26:30.760
So I had thought about I had originally planned because I took two days off this week.

26:31.400 --> 26:36.000
I had originally planned on splitting the sound engine to be able to allow for more

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
music.

26:37.000 --> 26:41.720
But then I thought about it and it's like, well, I've already like dumped like X number

26:41.720 --> 26:45.080
of dollars into the music itself.

26:45.080 --> 26:49.000
And I clearly am not going to make that back.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Clearly so.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.480
I was like, does it make sense to just dump more into it?

26:53.480 --> 26:55.160
I'm like, no, it doesn't.

26:55.160 --> 26:58.800
So that kind of got nixed.

26:59.760 --> 27:06.280
And also the guy that like, you know, cosmic gem, you know, great music, but man, he can

27:06.280 --> 27:08.400
he can take a while to get stuff done.

27:08.400 --> 27:15.200
And so I didn't want to just like commission more music and have it take like several months.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.280
So I just didn't want to get in that scenario again.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.480
I just want to kind of be done with this.

27:19.480 --> 27:22.960
So I am at the very least going to have 10 more levels in there total.

27:22.960 --> 27:26.000
So I've gotten six of the 10.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.760
Probably get the other four done maybe tonight or so.

27:28.760 --> 27:33.680
And then I've already added like another like there you can play as female characters now.

27:33.680 --> 27:37.280
So that was something I added like several weeks ago.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.200
So there's that.

27:39.200 --> 27:45.200
And I am going to change up the the continue.

27:45.200 --> 27:47.800
I guess it's not respawning, but like continuing.

27:47.800 --> 27:50.840
So instead of continuing at the beginning of a world, it'll just be the level you died

27:50.840 --> 27:55.060
on, which I think is more fair, although it makes the game easier.

27:55.060 --> 28:00.420
I may try to throw a hardcore mode in there to make it harder to increase the rate of

28:00.420 --> 28:03.740
spawning, which would be easy enough to do.

28:03.740 --> 28:07.460
So there's stuff like that and maybe an integrated manual as well.

28:07.460 --> 28:10.260
So that is just some of the stuff I was working on for that.

28:10.260 --> 28:12.060
But at the very least, I have levels done.

28:12.060 --> 28:13.300
So that's kind of cool.

28:13.300 --> 28:17.780
But yeah, that is basically what this week's been.

28:17.780 --> 28:19.780
Be sure to check that out.

28:19.780 --> 28:21.460
Listeners help Loki make some of his money back.

28:21.460 --> 28:23.220
He spent on the music.

28:23.220 --> 28:28.320
That's Pixel Poops number two on itch.io or also available on Steam with Pixel Poops

28:28.320 --> 28:29.320
as DLC.

28:29.320 --> 28:30.320
So check that out.

28:30.320 --> 28:31.320
Yeah.

28:31.320 --> 28:37.180
And there's this other website that the folks behind Nesbaker are working on as well, that

28:37.180 --> 28:41.160
once they get it completed, it'll be nice to share it with you because they have a really

28:41.160 --> 28:42.160
cool integrated.

28:42.160 --> 28:45.180
It's almost like a Steam workshop for NES ROMs.

28:45.180 --> 28:46.420
So it's pretty cool.

28:46.420 --> 28:52.740
And they actually have one of the things that's coming with that is eventually like if I publish

28:52.740 --> 28:56.960
a game, they could actually take care of making the physical versions.

28:56.960 --> 29:00.100
So they pay you like a flat fee or whatever you want to charge for it.

29:00.100 --> 29:04.380
And then they manufacture and ship it out for you, which would be ideal.

29:04.380 --> 29:09.740
So in the future, that's like so early in development right now for that.

29:09.740 --> 29:13.100
But like that is something cool that's coming down the pipeline.

29:13.100 --> 29:14.100
All right.

29:14.100 --> 29:15.100
Very cool.

29:15.100 --> 29:19.100
My gaming week, honestly, kind of like Loki, a lot of the same stuff.

29:19.100 --> 29:22.060
I've been continuing my adventures in Final Fantasy 14.

29:22.060 --> 29:25.380
I fell off the Orna Wagon several weeks ago, though I haven't really been playing a lot

29:25.380 --> 29:26.380
of that.

29:26.380 --> 29:31.100
Yeah, I noticed that there's not been people like starting, you know, the kingdom battles

29:31.100 --> 29:32.100
and stuff.

29:32.100 --> 29:34.000
I'm like, I don't know how to operate the bot.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.060
So I don't think I can do that.

29:36.060 --> 29:38.340
Everybody should have the ability to do it now.

29:38.340 --> 29:40.740
If you don't, just yell at me and I'll.

29:40.740 --> 29:44.500
Well, I know how to do I know how to start a new kingdom battle, but I don't know how

29:44.500 --> 29:46.500
to operate the bot.

29:46.500 --> 29:49.580
Oh, you just so that's why I haven't been doing it otherwise.

29:50.220 --> 29:52.580
War and however much time is left.

29:52.580 --> 29:56.220
Just scroll up and see what other people type to say, like a template.

29:56.220 --> 29:57.220
Let's see.

29:57.220 --> 29:59.660
So otherwise, I have been playing more Pokemon Go.

29:59.660 --> 30:04.500
I almost have hit the experience I need for level 44, finally.

30:04.500 --> 30:08.160
But it's just the all the PvP battles I have to do is holding me back.

30:08.160 --> 30:12.420
So I'm probably going to be gated behind that by the time I have the XP for 44.

30:12.420 --> 30:13.420
But that's OK.

30:13.420 --> 30:17.980
It'll be it'll be by the time I get the XP for 45 when I really start to get irritated

30:17.980 --> 30:18.980
on that.

30:19.220 --> 30:21.980
I'm still playing a little bit of Ingress, allowing that to motivate a lot of my walking

30:21.980 --> 30:26.380
that I've been trying to do more of because I gained too much weight through this pandemic

30:26.380 --> 30:27.380
process.

30:27.380 --> 30:31.620
So I'm trying to be a little more physically active to try to lose some of that before

30:31.620 --> 30:35.060
some of these in-person conventions start coming back.

30:35.060 --> 30:38.940
I've also been playing Dead by Daylight, as I mentioned, a couple of weeks on the show.

30:38.940 --> 30:42.740
I finally kind of started getting into that last week on the show.

30:42.740 --> 30:46.880
I'm sad she's not here to hear this, but Jamie and I had a follow up conversation and she

30:46.880 --> 30:50.500
was very adamant that I start playing Freddy Krueger as killer.

30:50.500 --> 30:54.600
And you might remember she actually Apple paid me five bucks so I could get the DLC

30:54.600 --> 30:55.600
for Freddy Krueger.

30:55.600 --> 30:59.620
Well, I actually paid seven bucks because I just got the little combo pack that has

30:59.620 --> 31:04.040
him and the survivor and whatever other Friday 13th crap came with it.

31:04.040 --> 31:05.040
And I got that.

31:05.040 --> 31:06.040
And so I've been playing.

31:06.040 --> 31:08.820
I did play my first game with Freddy as the killer.

31:08.820 --> 31:11.320
And I got to say, he's really fucking fun.

31:11.320 --> 31:16.560
He's such a bitch, like he's such a little bitch to be playing against.

31:16.560 --> 31:21.840
I know survivors have got to hate him, but the whole like fact that they can't even really

31:21.840 --> 31:25.880
see you coming until you're already there, unless they're in the dream world is a pretty

31:25.880 --> 31:26.960
nasty mechanic.

31:26.960 --> 31:29.460
And I love being able to port to the generators.

31:29.460 --> 31:30.460
It's great.

31:30.460 --> 31:33.200
He's such a little jerk and I love his talent.

31:33.200 --> 31:36.920
One of them, he can actually shut the exit doors once they've been opened.

31:36.920 --> 31:41.120
As long as he hooks somebody, then the exit doors get shut for like 40 seconds and people

31:41.120 --> 31:44.260
will try to run out thinking they can escape and psych.

31:44.260 --> 31:47.940
So all those people that try to teabag you at the exit get fucked.

31:47.940 --> 31:55.260
And it's awesome because I don't like killing anyone more than those people who teabag me

31:55.260 --> 31:57.260
at the exit.

31:57.260 --> 32:01.060
Zenmonkey11 in chat says, I always play as Freddy, but I don't think he's good for new

32:01.060 --> 32:02.060
players.

32:02.060 --> 32:03.060
I don't know.

32:03.060 --> 32:05.020
Maybe it's because I like watched other streams.

32:05.020 --> 32:08.140
I figured it out pretty quick.

32:08.140 --> 32:11.020
It's just setting those traps and kind of knowing where to set them.

32:11.020 --> 32:14.860
Although Pyramid Head has a very similar mechanic and that's who I was playing.

32:14.860 --> 32:17.380
And then, which I need to do some with the pallets.

32:17.380 --> 32:22.180
I fucking love that you can do fake pallets on top of all that.

32:22.180 --> 32:25.420
And just kind of, you know, being able to use the blood porting to your advantage where

32:25.420 --> 32:29.320
you can actually port to a gen on the other side of the map to more effectively patrol

32:29.320 --> 32:30.960
or fake them out.

32:30.960 --> 32:35.660
Like if you're, if you're going to be like near a gen, you start to blood port to that

32:35.660 --> 32:39.020
gen and watch everybody run out and then get him as they're running out.

32:39.020 --> 32:43.740
He's a nasty little shit trickster and that's why he's really fun to play.

32:43.740 --> 32:46.400
So yeah, so I've been enjoying Freddy.

32:46.400 --> 32:51.200
He's like my second highest leveled killer now next to Pyramid Head.

32:51.200 --> 32:54.360
So I will have to, I texted Jamie and let her know, but I'll have to let her know more

32:54.360 --> 32:57.660
about that later on.

32:57.660 --> 33:02.100
So and Zenmonkey11 in chat says, Freddy in the Stranger Things lab is awesome.

33:02.100 --> 33:05.500
Oh, I bet the traps are so effective there in the narrow quarters.

33:05.500 --> 33:09.860
I hate that map though, but I can see where, cause Pyramid Head's trenches are very effective,

33:09.860 --> 33:11.880
which again is a very similar mechanic.

33:11.880 --> 33:14.140
So yeah, Dead by Daylight, still playing more of that.

33:14.140 --> 33:18.900
I also played Octopath Traveler on Xbox cause it's with Game Pass.

33:18.900 --> 33:23.020
So I played a little bit of that and it hasn't really changed from the Switch.

33:23.020 --> 33:26.460
So there's really not a lot to add, but it was nice to kind of play that again and there's

33:26.460 --> 33:28.180
a ton of achievements.

33:28.180 --> 33:30.720
You get achievements for doing every little thing in that game.

33:30.720 --> 33:32.300
So that's kind of fun.

33:32.300 --> 33:39.180
I also played, this isn't really a full game, but you know, you know how Shane is my friend

33:39.180 --> 33:44.300
and you know, he has a reputation here on Orange Silence Radio, being able to talk people

33:44.300 --> 33:49.640
into buying and playing whatever game he wants you to be able to play.

33:49.640 --> 33:53.640
And one of the series he's really into right now is Monster Hunter.

33:53.640 --> 33:56.860
And so he's really trying to get me into Monster Hunter.

33:56.860 --> 34:01.540
And you know, I guess I could have downloaded the one on Game Pass cause Monster Hunter

34:01.540 --> 34:04.740
World, I think is on Game Pass, but he was like, no, they've done so many quality of

34:04.740 --> 34:06.740
life things in Rise.

34:06.740 --> 34:09.520
Just download that Monster Hunter Rise demo for the Switch.

34:09.520 --> 34:15.140
So I did, and I have to say the demo was a lot better than the Wii U Monster Hunter demo

34:15.140 --> 34:19.900
because it actually told you what to do and actually set you up and educated you on how

34:19.900 --> 34:21.140
to play the game.

34:21.140 --> 34:26.340
So I will give Rise credit in that department, but at the end of the day, unfortunately,

34:26.340 --> 34:29.860
I think I just don't enjoy Monster Hunter.

34:30.100 --> 34:33.200
And I think it's, and I know a lot of you do, so I'm sorry, and I'm not saying it's

34:33.200 --> 34:34.500
a bad game.

34:34.500 --> 34:36.280
It's just not for me.

34:36.280 --> 34:37.740
And it's the combat.

34:37.740 --> 34:39.900
It's so I can't get into the combat.

34:39.900 --> 34:44.920
Like I was doing the little tutorial thing and I'm like, oh, I swung my sword, gigantic

34:44.920 --> 34:49.880
sword and it took like two minutes and I missed and oh, I swung my big sword and I think I

34:49.880 --> 34:51.440
hit this one, but you know what?

34:51.440 --> 34:57.560
My dog pal and my cat pal already killed them because I'm so slow and bad that my dog and

34:57.560 --> 35:01.960
cat pal, which I do love that there are dog and cat friends, but they already killed them.

35:01.960 --> 35:06.200
And I tried to do another quest and it was just, I just, I can't get into it.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.200
I'm sorry.

35:07.200 --> 35:10.320
Anyway, I'm looking in chat.

35:10.320 --> 35:12.360
Quest Buster says, not every game is for everyone.

35:12.360 --> 35:13.360
It's okay.

35:13.360 --> 35:17.160
I know, I know, but I know so many of you are fans of the series and I don't want to

35:17.160 --> 35:19.560
sound like I'm talking negative on it.

35:19.560 --> 35:23.640
It did seem really pretty, the map, there seemed to be a lot of area to explore and

35:23.640 --> 35:26.480
all that, but I just can't get into the combat.

35:26.480 --> 35:31.880
I just, and I think that's where it's just a, no, thank you for me.

35:31.880 --> 35:32.880
Yeah.

35:32.880 --> 35:36.520
Bobby Blackall says it's not a Nino Cooney, certainly not.

35:36.520 --> 35:40.060
And Bobby says, yeah, they did a much better job with the demo and act deft and chat says

35:40.060 --> 35:43.800
the same goes for me, Rob, after five to six installments of Monster Hunter, I finally

35:43.800 --> 35:44.800
gave up.

35:44.800 --> 35:45.800
The game is not for me.

35:45.800 --> 35:49.200
Oh, Shane is in chat saying Monster Hunter is like deadly Pokemon.

35:49.200 --> 35:53.600
I'm excited every time I see a new monster, but then I'm excited to murder it.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.700
Mission chat says you're not talking negative.

35:55.700 --> 35:56.700
You're just not into it.

35:56.700 --> 35:57.700
And that's okay.

35:57.700 --> 35:58.700
Exactly.

35:58.700 --> 36:02.600
But you know, what's funny is you'll never know when I suddenly change my mind and I

36:02.600 --> 36:04.520
reserve the right to change my mind.

36:04.520 --> 36:08.400
I wasn't really into Mass Effect when I first played it, but I ended up changing my mind

36:08.400 --> 36:10.360
pretty big, didn't I?

36:10.360 --> 36:12.620
Here's the other one that shocks me.

36:12.620 --> 36:13.620
The horror thing.

36:13.620 --> 36:15.320
I'm not super into horror games.

36:15.320 --> 36:18.600
Well, I guess I'm always like Silent Hill, like psychological games, but I've never really

36:18.600 --> 36:20.640
been into like jump scare horror type of games.

36:20.680 --> 36:25.480
I don't really love horror movies the way a lot of my friends do and so forth, which

36:25.480 --> 36:30.480
I know is ironic because I work with the SAC horror film festival and even the producer

36:30.480 --> 36:32.600
knows, I'm not as into it as everyone else is.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.600
I'll do, I'll do a kick ass job hosting.

36:34.600 --> 36:35.920
I'm just not as into it.

36:35.920 --> 36:42.120
I love cult movies and that's why I'm there because horror and cult are very closely aligned.

36:42.120 --> 36:47.000
But my point is yet here I am five years after it came out, finally getting into Dead by

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Daylight.

36:48.000 --> 36:53.320
And finally just, oh, something finally clicked for me in this game and I'm into it now.

36:53.320 --> 36:55.960
And maybe that will happen with Monster Hunter someday.

36:55.960 --> 36:59.500
Maybe there will be just the right class that I discover where it's like, oh, this one doesn't

36:59.500 --> 37:00.500
play like molasses.

37:00.500 --> 37:03.680
I can, you know, get into this.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.640
But today is not that day.

37:05.640 --> 37:06.640
There is that.

37:06.640 --> 37:10.160
So Shane even says in chat, I didn't like Monster Hunter until World.

37:10.160 --> 37:14.020
It took the changes they made in World for me to have fun and now it's even better.

37:14.020 --> 37:17.060
So it took years for me to be a fan.

37:17.060 --> 37:21.580
And Quest Buster says, I wasn't into Pokemon until I finally sat down with Pokemon Sword

37:21.580 --> 37:23.680
and found myself really enjoying it.

37:23.680 --> 37:27.540
And talk about a series that Shane has really been trying to get me into for a long time.

37:27.540 --> 37:29.440
Yeah, the Pokemon games.

37:29.440 --> 37:32.460
I mean, I've always enjoyed them enough.

37:32.460 --> 37:36.100
I'll get through like a couple gyms in each of the mainline games and I'll kind of put

37:36.100 --> 37:37.100
it aside.

37:37.100 --> 37:43.000
But it wasn't until Pokemon Shield and that whole concept of you don't have to feel like

37:43.000 --> 37:47.260
you're missing Pokemon if you don't catch them all in a certain area because you have

37:47.260 --> 37:52.000
this gigantic, wild area waiting for you that you can explore in postgame and all this stuff.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
So just focus on it.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.340
Like the way Shield kind of framed it so much differently really worked for me.

37:57.340 --> 38:01.500
And it was the first Pokemon game I actually played to completion.

38:01.500 --> 38:06.220
And actually, as for those of you following the show, I even completed my stupid Pokedex

38:06.220 --> 38:07.220
a couple months ago.

38:07.220 --> 38:10.500
Now I just have to work on the DLC, but we'll see.

38:10.500 --> 38:12.380
All right.

38:12.380 --> 38:16.020
So that's that with all that stuff.

38:16.020 --> 38:18.920
Speaking of Pokemon, before I get to the next story.

38:18.920 --> 38:20.940
So a little bit of a housekeeping note.

38:20.940 --> 38:25.820
This week here at the Voice of Geeks Network, Bobby Blackwolf gave us our first channel

38:25.820 --> 38:28.820
point reward night.

38:28.820 --> 38:34.220
And basically what happened, those of you that do watch our show live over on Twitch,

38:34.220 --> 38:38.900
every so often we will have a channel reward thing that you can fundraise for.

38:38.900 --> 38:43.760
It's not actual money for these fundraisers, but they're the points that you earn as you

38:43.760 --> 38:45.280
watch VOG content.

38:45.280 --> 38:48.020
You get 10 points every few minutes that you're watching.

38:48.020 --> 38:49.860
I think if you're subbed, you get 12.

38:49.860 --> 38:53.540
Well, you can actually chip in points towards a bonus stream when we open that up.

38:53.540 --> 38:59.860
So Bobby did the first one this week and he did some old VHS footage of things he shot

38:59.860 --> 39:01.520
in the 90s.

39:01.520 --> 39:05.820
Some promos that he had VHS copies of, and some of them were wild, let me tell you.

39:05.860 --> 39:12.460
I didn't see all of it because I instead saw a really, really bad car accident as I was

39:12.460 --> 39:14.740
doing a Pokewalk that same day.

39:14.740 --> 39:17.920
And I got stuck there because they had to move everything out of the way for the cars

39:17.920 --> 39:19.080
to get out of the parking lot.

39:19.080 --> 39:23.660
But anyway, I did get to see the E3 footage that he shot on camera.

39:23.660 --> 39:25.740
And a lot of that was really funny and really good.

39:25.740 --> 39:28.820
And I guess for wrestling fans, there's a pretty epic thing in there.

39:28.820 --> 39:31.340
So yeah, he did a great stream of that.

39:31.340 --> 39:34.780
So we've been promising for a bit the second stream we're going to do, because I got him

39:34.780 --> 39:37.540
to say he would do it when he was here on the show a couple weeks ago.

39:37.540 --> 39:43.620
We're going to do Shane's Definitive Pokemon Ranking, and we'll see how good he is at influencing

39:43.620 --> 39:45.500
folks on his decisions.

39:45.500 --> 39:50.940
So that will be coming up if you guys can raise enough points, which I think you will.

39:50.940 --> 39:57.720
I think you have four weeks to raise 100,000 points, and we already have 38,000 as of tonight.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.240
So there's that.

39:59.240 --> 40:03.500
If you're not able to be here live, if you're a subscriber here at the Voice of Geeks Network,

40:03.500 --> 40:05.100
you can always watch it on demand.

40:05.100 --> 40:07.520
We're trying to create more benefit for our subscribers.

40:07.520 --> 40:11.280
That's really what it is, because so many of you have been so generous with your subscriptions

40:11.280 --> 40:14.940
and the gift subscriptions, especially a lot of that, that we want to make sure there is

40:14.940 --> 40:18.620
more content than just the Sunday night shows, the other shows we host.

40:18.620 --> 40:21.100
We want you to have more content to dive into.

40:21.100 --> 40:24.500
So if you missed what Bobby did earlier this week, hey, guess what, subscribers, you can

40:24.500 --> 40:26.720
go watch that on demand anytime.

40:26.720 --> 40:33.140
Make sure you see the part with the Charles Martinet voiced Mario animatronic in 98.

40:33.140 --> 40:34.140
It's great.

40:34.140 --> 40:40.420
And Bobby was so, so like, like dying on camera because he couldn't believe we were watching

40:40.420 --> 40:41.420
it.

40:41.420 --> 40:42.420
It was great.

40:42.420 --> 40:43.420
So check that.

40:43.420 --> 40:44.420
Check that out.

40:44.420 --> 40:47.660
But we will be doing Shane's definitive Pokemon ranking at some point in April, assuming we

40:47.660 --> 40:49.940
raised the points for it, which I think we will.

40:49.940 --> 40:51.820
So be sure to collect those points.

40:51.820 --> 40:52.820
All right.

40:52.820 --> 40:54.740
I think that's it for the housekeeping.

40:54.740 --> 40:59.500
Let's get into some more news and we're going to start off with Loki.

40:59.500 --> 41:00.680
Yeah.

41:00.680 --> 41:08.320
So alluding back to the story we were just talking about with Nintendo and supply chain.

41:08.320 --> 41:17.160
Well, the they were selling brand new Animal Crossing New Horizons Sanrio amiibo cards

41:17.160 --> 41:24.840
and they sold out pretty much immediately because what supply chain and, you know, Target

41:24.840 --> 41:28.200
was originally the store that was offering these.

41:28.200 --> 41:33.200
I think they may have been the only store and they were limiting orders to per customer.

41:33.200 --> 41:38.920
But of course, even like, you know, all the console launches last year immediately grabbed

41:38.920 --> 41:44.040
by scalpers who then turned around and sold them online.

41:44.040 --> 41:48.280
And, you know, it's a big old mess, as usual.

41:48.280 --> 41:58.040
Of course, as pointed out, there's folks that are selling bootleg amiibo cards off of like

41:58.040 --> 42:04.680
Etsy and stuff like that, because you can clone them using NFC stickers, which I have

42:04.680 --> 42:08.240
a 50 of them.

42:08.240 --> 42:16.080
But yeah, it makes it very difficult to actually pay money and get these because they are so

42:16.080 --> 42:19.520
scarce, which in reality, they really shouldn't be.

42:19.520 --> 42:22.440
Yeah, I have no problem endorsing piracy in this case.

42:22.440 --> 42:23.440
Sorry.

42:23.440 --> 42:24.440
I know.

42:24.440 --> 42:26.800
And I know people are going to take issue with that too.

42:26.800 --> 42:28.960
It's just this is unacceptable.

42:28.960 --> 42:31.240
What's happening is unacceptable, period.

42:31.240 --> 42:38.880
Like Nintendo's scarcity of fucking cards that are so easy to make yourself that there's

42:38.880 --> 42:42.240
entire Reddit's dedicated to the process.

42:42.240 --> 42:45.520
Like go forth and copy, make your own cards.

42:45.520 --> 42:47.760
Now, that's not going to be good enough for some people.

42:47.760 --> 42:51.200
Some people are collectors and they're going to want to collect the actual cards and so

42:51.200 --> 42:52.200
forth.

42:52.200 --> 42:56.040
And again, I'm not here to tell you how to spend your money and how to do all that stuff.

42:56.040 --> 42:59.880
But all I'm going to say is that if you want to pirate these cards, because Nintendo didn't

42:59.880 --> 43:03.880
put enough of them on shelves and scalpers are buying them instead to devalue what the

43:03.880 --> 43:07.040
scalpers have, I am all about piracy.

43:07.040 --> 43:10.000
Go forth, pirate, make your own Sanrio amiibo.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.040
In this case, I'm not endorsing piracy everywhere.

43:13.040 --> 43:15.640
I'm endorsing it for this particular product.

43:15.640 --> 43:21.360
Because once again, Nintendo has flopped when it comes to creating the supply to meet the

43:21.360 --> 43:23.000
demand.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
They're cards.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
I mean, they don't really cost anything.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.280
But once again, they want to they don't want to oversaturate the market because it will

43:28.280 --> 43:29.640
devalue their product.

43:29.640 --> 43:31.960
But like, it's just frustrating.

43:31.960 --> 43:34.320
Nobody is concerned about their product being devalued.

43:34.320 --> 43:40.320
When is whenever has like anything that Nintendo has sold been devalued?

43:40.320 --> 43:45.640
Like ever like I don't even looking at like classic NES games now buying cartridges for

43:45.640 --> 43:46.640
those.

43:46.640 --> 43:48.840
Those haven't dropped down in price very much.

43:48.840 --> 43:49.840
No.

43:49.840 --> 43:55.080
In fact, classic NES games, I mean, unless they're like, a lot of like sports games that

43:55.080 --> 43:56.560
are released annually.

43:56.560 --> 44:02.400
But even sometimes, like, you know, try to find a copy of like, what is the NHL 94, whatever

44:02.400 --> 44:05.400
it is on Genesis, the, you know, epic one.

44:05.400 --> 44:07.000
Those are still a bit of money.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.560
But you know, a lot of the sports games that were published yearly are kind of the exception.

44:10.560 --> 44:14.840
But you go back to like the cartridges on the NES, like a lot of they're they're going

44:14.840 --> 44:16.620
up in price now.

44:16.620 --> 44:19.280
You know, there was a little while when you could get them pretty cheaply.

44:19.280 --> 44:22.800
But now that they're becoming more scarce, and they're more collectibles, they're just

44:22.800 --> 44:23.800
going up in value.

44:23.800 --> 44:25.080
They really, really are.

44:25.080 --> 44:26.920
Yeah, it's crazy.

44:26.920 --> 44:29.260
But yeah, same old, same old.

44:29.260 --> 44:31.720
So I mean, if you want these, hope you got them.

44:31.720 --> 44:36.160
But I don't know if they're going to be releasing more.

44:36.160 --> 44:43.160
You know, honestly, like it to me, it, it doesn't even really make sense to me anyways,

44:43.160 --> 44:44.520
because it's like a one time thing.

44:44.520 --> 44:48.080
This really should have been just sold as DLC, like the cards, like, I guess you could

44:48.080 --> 44:51.040
collect them, but it's not really something you can just display.

44:51.040 --> 44:53.880
It's not like a statue like an amiibo normally is.

44:53.880 --> 44:57.000
This is just you scan it into the game and you're done.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
Yeah.

44:58.000 --> 45:03.040
Like, I don't understand why even Well, what would be the point of keeping them again,

45:03.040 --> 45:06.040
collectibles akin to baseball card collecting?

45:06.040 --> 45:07.360
I understand.

45:07.360 --> 45:10.520
And I'm not here to tell somebody what they should and shouldn't collect.

45:10.520 --> 45:12.520
So if that is value to somebody, then cool.

45:12.520 --> 45:13.520
But you're right.

45:13.520 --> 45:16.440
The practical use in the game.

45:16.440 --> 45:18.280
I'm sick of the scarcity.

45:18.280 --> 45:19.480
I'm sick of it.

45:19.480 --> 45:25.080
So pirate now, I would say that I'm going to pirate these.

45:25.080 --> 45:28.900
But a listener was like, Oh, I saw these on the shelf.

45:28.900 --> 45:31.880
And I grabbed you one so that a scalper wouldn't get it.

45:31.880 --> 45:32.880
And that was very kind.

45:32.880 --> 45:34.360
I'm very lucky in that regard.

45:34.360 --> 45:40.760
But if that hadn't happened, I would have no problem making my own, asking Loki for

45:40.760 --> 45:42.480
help and making my own.

45:42.480 --> 45:45.920
Yeah, I haven't I haven't quite done it yet.

45:45.920 --> 45:48.560
But from what I see, it's very easy.

45:48.560 --> 45:51.100
You have a phone app to basically scan it.

45:51.100 --> 45:56.120
My phone has NFC writers, so I can just put the sticker on there.

45:56.120 --> 46:00.680
Then they have like, the way most people set them up is they have a you print like a piece

46:00.680 --> 46:06.080
of paper and you glue it to a poker chip, and you stick it inside of a coin case.

46:06.080 --> 46:09.280
And then you can keep everything kind of together.

46:09.720 --> 46:12.480
I haven't done it yet because I'm in no hurry to do it.

46:12.480 --> 46:13.480
But we did.

46:13.480 --> 46:18.800
We were going to do that just with some of the Smash Brothers amiibos and stuff like

46:18.800 --> 46:21.040
that that I can't find anymore.

46:21.040 --> 46:22.780
Like they're just not being sold anywhere.

46:22.780 --> 46:30.240
So it's like rather than pay, you know, over twenty dollars a statue, we'll just put them

46:30.240 --> 46:31.440
on a coin.

46:31.440 --> 46:34.960
I don't I don't need especially since we're going to scan them in once and that'll be

46:34.960 --> 46:35.960
it.

46:35.960 --> 46:37.280
Like, I don't need to do that.

46:37.280 --> 46:42.000
We don't need a Nintendo just had their own online store where you could order any amiibo

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
you wanted.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
This wouldn't be such a problem.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
But no.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
Oh, yeah.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Yeah.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
That would be helpful.

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
But, you know, that might devalue their product or something.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
Yeah.

46:52.000 --> 47:00.160
I and this is this is the reason why I'm you know, I on one hand, I kind of miss some of

47:00.160 --> 47:01.360
the amiibo stuff.

47:01.360 --> 47:03.540
But this whole scarcity and thing, I don't miss it.

47:03.540 --> 47:07.580
And that's the reason why I kind of do wish this amiibo stuff would come to an end.

47:07.580 --> 47:10.660
And I realize these are just reprints of cards that are a few years old anyway, but they're

47:10.660 --> 47:14.620
giving it all this new functionality, which obviously makes it a very different situation.

47:14.620 --> 47:16.620
So yeah, there is that.

47:16.620 --> 47:21.700
Well, speaking of Nintendo, at least this project sounds like it could be interesting.

47:21.700 --> 47:27.300
There is a another joint venture that's going to be happening between Nintendo and Niantic.

47:27.300 --> 47:32.980
Of course, Niantic being the makers of the hugely popular mobile phone game Pokemon Go,

47:32.980 --> 47:37.060
which is still going, it's coming up on its five year anniversary, contrary to what Bobby

47:37.060 --> 47:41.700
Black will try to tell you on our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash discord, Pokemon

47:41.700 --> 47:43.020
Go is still going.

47:43.020 --> 47:47.700
And it's honestly probably in a better place than it's been in a long time coming up on

47:47.700 --> 47:48.700
its five year anniversary.

47:48.700 --> 47:53.000
And that's going to be very interesting to see how they celebrate the five year anniversary.

47:53.000 --> 47:58.000
And this week, Nintendo Niantic put out a joint press release talking about a new partnership.

47:58.000 --> 48:03.040
They're going to be jointly develop apps that combine Niantic's real world AR technology

48:03.040 --> 48:05.040
with Nintendo's beloved characters.

48:05.040 --> 48:09.280
So this is one of probably more to come.

48:09.280 --> 48:17.360
And I wonder if this isn't a result of Nintendo's own adventures into mobile phone gaming, you

48:17.360 --> 48:21.320
know, outside of Pokemon Go, none of them really took off like everybody was expecting

48:21.320 --> 48:24.440
Super Mario Run to change the game and it didn't.

48:24.960 --> 48:29.800
And then the Animal Crossing, the Mario Kart, I think is really not done the expectations

48:29.800 --> 48:31.280
they expected it to.

48:31.280 --> 48:36.080
So they're really reevaluating how they do mobile phone and who's done well with a Nintendo

48:36.080 --> 48:37.080
product.

48:37.080 --> 48:39.440
Well, I'll tell you, it's Niantic.

48:39.440 --> 48:44.400
And I'll tell you why Niantic did well with product where these other companies screwed

48:44.400 --> 48:51.760
up because Niantic made a game, a unique thing with the mobile phone and what the mobile

48:51.760 --> 48:54.400
phone can offer in mind.

48:54.400 --> 48:57.240
What was Super Mario Run?

48:57.240 --> 49:01.440
It was a cheap knockoff of the console experience because you couldn't have an actual controller

49:01.440 --> 49:02.440
on the phone.

49:02.440 --> 49:06.480
They decided, oh, he'll just always run and you'll tap the screen to jump.

49:06.480 --> 49:07.480
Flop.

49:07.480 --> 49:08.480
Mario.

49:08.480 --> 49:09.480
So like an endless runner.

49:09.480 --> 49:14.440
Well, it wasn't an endless runner, but like endless based off an endless runner is kind

49:14.440 --> 49:17.160
of kind of like cheap.

49:17.160 --> 49:22.800
Like just that's like, oh, I'm going to make a mobile game to be endless runners are popular.

49:22.800 --> 49:23.800
Yeah.

49:24.200 --> 49:28.440
Like when temple runs popular, it's like, okay, well, let's think outside the box of

49:28.440 --> 49:29.440
it here.

49:29.440 --> 49:32.120
Mario Kart, super fun game on console.

49:32.120 --> 49:34.880
I hope they make a Mario Kart nine and soon.

49:34.880 --> 49:39.280
But when you try to translate it to cell phone, doing this with your cell phone just isn't

49:39.280 --> 49:40.440
the same.

49:40.440 --> 49:42.180
It's not as fun.

49:42.180 --> 49:44.620
And so people kind of rejected that.

49:44.620 --> 49:49.000
This is where Niantic succeeded because they developed a game that took, you know, something

49:49.000 --> 49:52.600
only mobile phones can do and a game that was designed for mobile.

49:52.600 --> 49:54.480
They had that in the back of their mind.

49:54.480 --> 49:56.560
And so that's really what it is.

49:56.560 --> 49:58.760
So Nintendo's kind of realized this, I think.

49:58.760 --> 50:02.140
And now they're partnering with Niantic to make other games.

50:02.140 --> 50:07.200
And the first one that they are going to be doing is a new game based on Pikmin, which

50:07.200 --> 50:10.880
that part kind of makes me go, ooh, cause I'm just not a big Pikmin fan.

50:10.880 --> 50:12.580
It's like, it's like a monster Hunter for me.

50:12.580 --> 50:13.580
You guys love it.

50:13.580 --> 50:14.580
I don't, I don't care for it.

50:14.580 --> 50:16.680
How many Pikmin games have we gotten recently?

50:16.680 --> 50:20.880
Like let's move on to another franchise, please only Pikmin three.

50:20.880 --> 50:21.880
It was just recent.

50:21.880 --> 50:24.720
That's why it feels like there's like another one before that though.

50:24.720 --> 50:28.680
They had another rerelease and aren't they making yet another game as well.

50:28.680 --> 50:29.680
They did.

50:29.680 --> 50:31.760
Yeah, I think, I think so.

50:31.760 --> 50:36.240
It's been so many, like just, Oh God, it's, it's so uninteresting.

50:36.240 --> 50:41.580
Like yeah, I'll check it out, but like, it's certainly not ha it does not have the appeal

50:41.580 --> 50:47.760
that, you know, a Pokemon game would have a Pikmin is just not, it's not to that level.

50:47.760 --> 50:53.380
I'll give it a chance because in the announcement, the press release, they say with gameplay

50:53.380 --> 50:58.660
activities designed to encourage walking and making the activities more enjoyable.

50:58.660 --> 51:02.080
And of course it's being made by Niantic in Tokyo.

51:02.080 --> 51:05.680
And that all sounds making walking more enjoyable.

51:05.680 --> 51:09.040
That's what motivates me to play things like Ingress and Pokemon go.

51:09.040 --> 51:13.280
So if they find a way to gamify Pikmin in a way that's going to be fun.

51:13.280 --> 51:18.640
And I don't expect, and I think I have to remember what I just said about why those

51:18.640 --> 51:20.600
other games didn't work.

51:20.600 --> 51:22.680
And that might be good news for me here.

51:22.680 --> 51:27.900
I didn't enjoy Pikmin on console, but since Niantic, I expect is not just going to try

51:27.900 --> 51:32.920
to shove a console version of Pikmin in the real world, but make an AR experience that

51:32.920 --> 51:34.440
happens to involve Pikmin.

51:34.440 --> 51:38.020
I'm going to give it a shot because it's going to be different from the console games based

51:38.020 --> 51:43.520
on the track record of Niantic, based on the track record of all the other companies

51:43.520 --> 51:44.820
that Nintendo tried to partner with.

51:44.820 --> 51:46.380
Does that make sense?

51:46.380 --> 51:51.820
Yeah, I wish they would do like a Zelda game, honestly, because the control scheme that

51:51.820 --> 51:58.100
they had on the DS Zelda games using just the touch screen was fantastic.

51:58.100 --> 51:59.100
It was great.

51:59.100 --> 52:00.580
It worked really well.

52:00.580 --> 52:02.860
Like you could make a pretty robust game.

52:02.860 --> 52:06.900
I think it would be awesome to see a mobile like Zelda game and even like an AR based

52:06.900 --> 52:11.100
one would be kind of cool with different randomly generated dungeons.

52:11.100 --> 52:18.620
Can you fucking imagine a Zelda AR game that's kind of like based on the first Zelda where

52:18.620 --> 52:20.780
like the entire world is a map.

52:20.780 --> 52:23.180
And like you said, a lot of it is just kind of generated.

52:23.180 --> 52:28.500
But let's say you go to your park nearby and your park is where the dungeons are and where

52:28.500 --> 52:31.820
you get the little doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo and you get like a secret thing and

52:31.820 --> 52:33.400
then you can kind of explore the air.

52:33.400 --> 52:34.400
That would be so badass.

52:34.400 --> 52:39.160
I'd be so into it, but I don't I have no idea if that is, you know, they wouldn't they

52:39.160 --> 52:40.720
would do retro Zelda anymore.

52:40.720 --> 52:42.480
They would just try to I don't know.

52:42.480 --> 52:49.240
It would just not be I don't I. Yeah, it's unfortunate because like stuff like, you know,

52:49.240 --> 52:54.760
especially like with Orna, I think is such a great concept that you will fifth dream

52:54.760 --> 52:57.200
says just reskin Orna to Zelda.

52:57.200 --> 52:59.720
Well, it's a different type of game.

52:59.720 --> 53:03.440
But yeah, I mean, if that they could do something like that, that would be kind of similar to

53:03.480 --> 53:05.560
like a Final Fantasy AR game almost.

53:05.560 --> 53:09.520
I mean, that's kind of what it is.

53:09.520 --> 53:14.720
But they could do like they they really could do a mobile Zelda game and it would work.

53:14.720 --> 53:15.720
All right.

53:15.720 --> 53:20.020
Hell, if you want to be super lazy about it, just pour it over the DS like Zelda games.

53:20.020 --> 53:21.480
They worked well with touch screen.

53:21.480 --> 53:23.160
Like that's how you played those games.

53:23.160 --> 53:24.880
No, no, no.

53:24.880 --> 53:25.880
Bad Loki.

53:25.880 --> 53:26.880
Where's my square ball?

53:26.880 --> 53:27.880
No.

53:27.880 --> 53:32.880
I do not want console games ported to mobile phone anymore.

53:32.880 --> 53:33.880
We're done.

53:33.880 --> 53:34.880
We're past that.

53:34.880 --> 53:35.880
So no, that sounds like a terrible idea.

53:35.880 --> 53:36.880
Bad.

53:36.880 --> 53:37.880
Time out.

53:37.880 --> 53:38.880
All right.

53:38.880 --> 53:39.880
Fine.

53:39.880 --> 53:40.880
Going to chat.

53:40.880 --> 53:41.880
Yes.

53:41.880 --> 53:42.880
It's you.

53:42.880 --> 53:43.880
One hundred.

53:43.880 --> 53:45.660
Matt says Niantic is taking notes.

53:45.660 --> 53:46.880
Don't give that away for free.

53:46.880 --> 53:49.160
And I wouldn't be the first time it's happened on this show.

53:49.160 --> 53:51.160
That's listening to.

53:51.160 --> 53:59.160
Well, well, anyway, OK, well, Niantic is not listening to.

53:59.160 --> 54:00.160
I don't.

54:00.160 --> 54:01.160
Maybe not anymore.

54:01.160 --> 54:02.160
Anyway.

54:02.440 --> 54:03.440
I don't know.

54:03.440 --> 54:04.440
We'll see.

54:04.440 --> 54:09.680
But you know who you are and you know where to find me.

54:09.680 --> 54:13.360
So let's talk if that's of interest to you, please.

54:13.360 --> 54:16.160
Anyway, let's see.

54:16.160 --> 54:18.560
What else is in the thing here?

54:18.560 --> 54:23.680
The app is scheduled to launch globally in twenty twenty one with Niantic as the publisher.

54:23.680 --> 54:26.700
That's another interesting note is that it is a game that's scheduled to release this

54:26.700 --> 54:31.120
year, which is interesting because did you all forget Niantic supposed to be doing a

54:31.120 --> 54:33.240
Catan game, a Settlers of Catan game?

54:33.240 --> 54:35.560
That was the other project they did out some time ago.

54:35.560 --> 54:38.760
There's there's Pokemon Go.

54:38.760 --> 54:40.160
There's Ingress.

54:40.160 --> 54:45.100
There's Harry Potter, although I think Portkey Warner Brothers does the bulk of development

54:45.100 --> 54:46.100
for that game.

54:46.100 --> 54:48.000
And they're just kind of using Niantic's database for that.

54:48.000 --> 54:51.920
But the Niantic social has been really crammed into that.

54:51.920 --> 54:55.200
And that was a big part of the Pokemon Go upgrades this week is that those two games

54:55.200 --> 54:57.640
are really joined at the hip at this point.

54:57.640 --> 54:59.640
So we'll see where that comes in.

54:59.680 --> 55:01.320
But anyway, those are the three games that exist now.

55:01.320 --> 55:05.080
They're supposed to be Settlers of Catan coming or Catan the World.

55:05.080 --> 55:06.080
I don't know what it's called.

55:06.080 --> 55:11.680
And now we know Pikmin will be game number five, four, if Catan gets slowed down anymore.

55:11.680 --> 55:12.680
I don't know.

55:12.680 --> 55:14.400
So and Catan is out.

55:14.400 --> 55:18.280
If you're in Australia or New Zealand or maybe it's just New Zealand.

55:18.280 --> 55:20.200
Sorry to any Aussie listeners.

55:20.200 --> 55:21.960
We may have listening if I'm wrong.

55:21.960 --> 55:26.600
But I think Catan is still in that beta test in those areas where Niantic really tends

55:26.600 --> 55:28.760
to test a lot of their products.

55:29.560 --> 55:34.840
All right, Akdev says, I think it's only New Zealand and that may very well be all right.

55:34.840 --> 55:35.840
You know what?

55:35.840 --> 55:39.960
It's a reward to New Zealand for doing COVID the right way.

55:39.960 --> 55:41.640
You get you get Catan.

55:41.640 --> 55:42.640
Congrats.

55:42.640 --> 55:45.120
And you'll probably get the Pikmin game too first.

55:45.120 --> 55:46.120
All right.

55:46.120 --> 55:51.280
Anyway, S200mattinchat says, New Zealand gets all the fun things like winning a pandemic.

55:51.280 --> 55:53.640
I know.

55:53.640 --> 55:54.820
Freaking competent leadership.

55:54.820 --> 55:56.840
It's pretty amazing what that'll bring.

55:56.840 --> 55:57.840
Anyway, Loki.

55:57.920 --> 56:00.800
Oh, oh, here's another gut punch on the mobile front.

56:00.800 --> 56:01.800
Hi, Loki.

56:01.800 --> 56:02.800
Although, I don't know.

56:02.800 --> 56:05.200
I actually don't think this is bad news.

56:05.200 --> 56:06.200
But Loki, whatever.

56:06.200 --> 56:07.200
You know what?

56:07.200 --> 56:09.200
I don't think it's bad news.

56:09.200 --> 56:12.760
I think we should celebrate this news.

56:12.760 --> 56:18.160
But no, they have to go and dash my hopes again, because that's just where we are in

56:18.160 --> 56:19.360
this world.

56:19.360 --> 56:25.320
So Square Enix was developing a port of Final Fantasy 11.

56:25.320 --> 56:27.080
They were developing it.

56:27.320 --> 56:28.320
OK, fine.

56:28.320 --> 56:34.440
Nexon was developing it and it was called Final Fantasy 11 R. And it was supposed to

56:34.440 --> 56:43.760
be some mobile MMO, but they, as of apparently February, have stopped development on it,

56:43.760 --> 56:49.980
saying that in early February, Nexon and Square Enix announced a mutual decision to cancel

56:49.980 --> 56:50.980
that project.

56:50.980 --> 56:55.860
Together, we decided that the game was not showing the level of creative differentiation

56:56.140 --> 56:59.340
that the players expect from a Final Fantasy franchise.

56:59.340 --> 57:04.180
And rather than release a game that doesn't break new creative ground, we agreed to step

57:04.180 --> 57:06.180
away from the project.

57:06.180 --> 57:07.180
Yay.

57:07.180 --> 57:08.180
No.

57:08.180 --> 57:09.180
Yay.

57:09.180 --> 57:14.840
Because that is a very long way of saying we realized Final Fantasy 11 was not fun to

57:14.840 --> 57:16.340
play on a mobile phone.

57:16.340 --> 57:20.540
And Loki, you would have you and look, I if Jobs were lost or something like that, I wouldn't

57:20.540 --> 57:24.920
be having this celebration, but they moved everybody to another project.

57:24.920 --> 57:29.000
Nobody finally, along the way, realized Final Fantasy 11 is going to fucking suck to play

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
on a mobile phone.

57:30.000 --> 57:33.160
Yay for coming to that decision, because you're absolutely right.

57:33.160 --> 57:36.560
And Loki, you know it, whether you want to admit it or not, this game would have sucked

57:36.560 --> 57:37.560
on a mobile phone.

57:37.560 --> 57:38.560
Absolutely.

57:38.560 --> 57:43.680
I played on a tablet, then it would have been fine.

57:43.680 --> 57:45.520
I would have still played it.

57:45.520 --> 57:51.040
Now, if they take some of those assets that were built and maybe make a, say, Nintendo

57:51.040 --> 57:56.520
Switch version of Final Fantasy 11, now we're talking maybe a little more.

57:56.520 --> 57:59.880
Maybe I can get on board with something like that, but we'll see.

57:59.880 --> 58:03.840
I do think, and look, I had many great years in Final Fantasy 11.

58:03.840 --> 58:09.560
I do want to see Final Fantasy 11 be refreshed enough so that more people feel compelled

58:09.560 --> 58:12.420
in the year 2021 to take a look at it.

58:12.420 --> 58:15.680
I just think the answer was never port it to cell phones.

58:15.680 --> 58:19.320
I don't understand, you know, that would have just fundamentally changed the game.

58:19.320 --> 58:23.480
That wouldn't have even been Final Fantasy 11 the way we remember it.

58:23.480 --> 58:29.200
But I think, well, number one, the mod scene is still doing incredible things in Final

58:29.200 --> 58:30.200
Fantasy 11.

58:30.200 --> 58:31.200
Did you see that, Loki?

58:31.200 --> 58:35.600
Somebody went through and fucking upped all the textures in Final Fantasy 11 to like 4K.

58:35.600 --> 58:39.560
And so, like, there's a mod out there that will, like, basically make an HD version of

58:39.560 --> 58:40.560
Final Fantasy 11.

58:40.560 --> 58:42.320
And it looks pretty amazing.

58:42.320 --> 58:49.080
And it's also one of those things that makes you go, why won't Square embrace

58:49.080 --> 58:50.080
something like this?

58:50.080 --> 58:54.560
Well, maybe they couldn't because of the deal they had going on with Nexon.

58:54.560 --> 58:58.080
And that was going to be the next official Final Fantasy 11 product.

58:58.080 --> 58:59.760
So let me reiterate.

58:59.760 --> 59:02.580
Yay, it's canceled.

59:02.580 --> 59:06.960
So now they can do something else that's going to be a little more in line with what we would

59:06.960 --> 59:10.680
expect out of a Final Fantasy 11 reimagining.

59:10.680 --> 59:11.680
So there's that.

59:11.680 --> 59:12.680
All right.

59:12.680 --> 59:18.800
Loki, I don't mean to dance on your dreams and all that stuff, but Loki, it's for the

59:18.800 --> 59:20.160
best.

59:20.160 --> 59:21.400
It's for the best.

59:21.400 --> 59:22.400
I guess.

59:22.400 --> 59:23.400
All right.

59:23.400 --> 59:25.800
I'm not happy about it, though.

59:25.800 --> 59:32.200
No, I mean, I mean, I'm only happy because everybody got moved to another project.

59:32.200 --> 59:33.200
So we're fine.

59:33.200 --> 59:34.200
But anyway.

59:34.200 --> 59:35.200
All right.

59:35.200 --> 59:41.560
Moving on, let's talk about exciting things happening in the indie scene.

59:41.560 --> 59:44.400
That's always something to celebrate and say yay about.

59:44.400 --> 59:49.960
And Xbox did an event this week where they talked about indie games, indie games, indie

59:49.960 --> 59:52.680
games, and a fucking lot of indie games.

59:52.680 --> 59:53.680
There was a lot.

59:53.680 --> 59:54.680
Did you see that?

59:54.680 --> 59:55.680
I did Xbox.

59:55.680 --> 59:56.680
I think it's called.

59:56.680 --> 59:57.680
Do you see all that?

59:57.680 --> 59:58.680
Yeah, I heard about it.

59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.900
Yeah, I really only saw the bullet points.

01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:03.160
And they did a showcase.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:08.880
And in the showcase, over 20 games were confirmed that they are going to be on Game Pass at

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:09.880
launch.

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:15.800
And I think one of them just came out like the day after right away.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:18.080
Sorry, I forget which game came out.

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:21.720
I forget the name in the moment.

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:25.400
But there was a game that something, Moonlight, I think it was called.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:30.720
So anyway, some of the other games that are going to be coming to Game Pass.

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:36.120
Art of the Rally, Astrea Ascending, Backbone, Boyfriend Dungeon, Craftopia, Dead Static

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:40.160
Drive, Edge of Eternity, Hello Neighbor 2, that was one I know they're spotlighting

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:48.000
a bit, Library of Ruina, Little Witch in the Woods, Moonglow Bay, Narita Boy, Nobody Saves

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:55.760
the World, Omno, Re-compile, Sable, She Dreams Elsewhere, Stalker 2, The Ascent, Undungeon,

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.720
Way to the Woods, and Wild at Heart.

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.640
So all of those, again, they're coming to Game Pass the first day.

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.840
So it's pretty impressive on Microsoft's part.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:09.160
And I think that's a great way for more indie games to get discovered as well, is that by

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:15.720
kind of releasing on that Game Pass and going to that app where, hey, I can check this game

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:18.960
out because it's part of what I have in my subscription anyway.

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:22.360
I think it's getting those games out there to even a wider audience.

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:28.160
And they're not getting lost in, say, Nintendo's storefront, where it's like if you don't succeed

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:31.760
in the first week, you're going to get buried, or the way things work on Steam.

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:32.560
Am I right, Loki?

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:39.720
Yeah, I mean, definitely, it's, you know, easier to find those games and easier to check

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:43.960
them out, especially, you know, I'm glad that they have the back of these independent

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:48.320
developers to be able to kind of showcase their games.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:53.720
Plus, it's a guaranteed revenue stream because it is being included in Game Pass that they're

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.960
getting money from that.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.560
So that's pretty nice as well, that deal.

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:03.920
Genesis Noir is the game I was trying to think of that came right out on Xbox Game Pass.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:07.440
Yeah, that Nobody Saves the World 2, that's supposed to be a brand new RPG by the guys

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.320
that did Guacamelee.

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:10.320
So that looks pretty cool.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.320
Oh, that'll be fun.

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.320
Very cool.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:13.320
Yeah.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:14.320
All right.

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:19.240
Akdeft in chat says, Art of the Rally kind of reminds me of RC Pro-Am.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:25.600
So, yeah, there's, you know, a lot of these indie titles, honestly, they get their influence

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:29.520
from an established IP, and then a lot of them do it even better.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.320
So that's pretty, pretty cool.

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.520
All right, let's move on with some more news.

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.520
Loki.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:44.640
So, Sony is planning on shutting down the stores for the PlayStation 3, PSP and Vita

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:45.640
this summer.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:46.640
Rumor.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.640
Rumor.

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:55.040
Yes, allegedly, so the rumor is that they're closing the PlayStation 3 and PSP versions

01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:02.700
of the store early July and then shutting down the Vita version in late August.

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:07.480
So apparently that will, I don't think you'll be able to purchase any more games through

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:08.480
that.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:14.560
You will still have, possibly have the option to redownload previously purchased titles,

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:18.760
but you won't be able to purchase brand new titles anymore, or at least not through those

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:19.760
services.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:20.760
Yeah.

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:26.480
Yeah, I mean, this is something we've seen, like, Nintendo do.

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:31.640
Not surprising, but we'll have to see if it actually happens.

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:32.640
Probably would.

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:33.920
I could see them doing that.

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:40.440
I know we've seen a lot of stories also about, like, so-called pirates preserving some of

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:46.760
these games, but I don't know if that's necessarily what they're doing.

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.480
But sure, sure.

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:52.120
People say that you're doing it for game preservation, not piracy.

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:57.120
Well, I mean, but this begs the question, you know, again, like, if I'm not allowed

01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:00.320
to buy the game anymore, what choice do I have?

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:01.320
True.

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:04.000
Yeah, that makes sense.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.880
But the developers, you know, the publishers or whatever of these games aren't receiving

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.200
any money either.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:16.480
So yeah, I get it, you can't purchase the game, but I don't know.

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:17.480
Yeah.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:23.960
I think at that point, though, like, the money's been made, but it still sucks.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:31.440
Yeah, I just I wish Sony was embracing backwards compatibility.

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:37.040
I know their current, you know, management feels a certain way about it, but I think

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:41.360
Xbox has been winning a lot of favor with people because they've recognized they were

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:43.760
going the wrong way with backwards compatibility in the beginning, too.

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:47.120
But I think they recognized that that was a mistake and really opening their library

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:50.520
to backwards compatibility, and especially the part where they're making the older games

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:54.360
even better through something like the auto HDR and, you know, something like, you know,

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:58.320
I was talking last week, I played Oblivion for a little bit because it was on Game Pass

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:00.280
and it looks even better than it did.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:03.000
Of course it does, because I have a nicer TV now and all that stuff.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.200
You know, it looks great compared to what it did on the 360.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:11.200
So it's just a shame that Sony won't do the same thing.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:15.720
Now, Sony would say, oh, well, you can still experience our rich PlayStation 3 library

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:17.840
through PlayStation Now.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:20.320
Nobody wants PlayStation Now.

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:26.120
Well, and I think a big part of that is because it's cloud based and I don't think everybody

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:30.400
wants cloud based, especially when we're still living in this era of data caps.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:34.400
And you know, OK, but where's PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1?

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:38.120
You know, that was a big part of what was on the PlayStation 3 store.

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:42.280
There was a lot of PlayStation 1 classics on there that you really can't get anywhere

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:46.760
else once that's gone, because my PlayStation 5 can't play a fucking PlayStation 1 game.

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:47.760
You know what I mean?

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.760
Or PlayStation 4, whatever.

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:54.800
And that's going to suck because games like, say, you know, great, great PlayStation 1

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.760
games like, say, Suikoden 1 and 2.

01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:59.140
You know, those games were really hard to find for a while.

01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:02.120
And then when they came out on the PlayStation 3, it was like, awesome.

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:05.740
We can get these digitally because there's no such thing as digital scarcity in the Sony

01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:07.360
universe until now.

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:11.220
All these years later, now we're just going to be losing the store altogether.

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:15.500
And we can't really trust Konami to ever get their shit together to get these games

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:19.220
re-released on PlayStation 4 or 5 or what have you.

01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:23.680
So I think Sony is doing a big disservice by getting rid of a lot of these PlayStation

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.180
1 and 2 games as well.

01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:31.000
Now there's rumors, you know, we love to talk rumors, that Sony is going to address the

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.820
backwards compatibility thing.

01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:37.220
But I'm not going to put stock in that because their track record doesn't really show that.

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:41.780
I would be pleasantly, pleasantly surprised if they have a change of heart on that front.

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:46.620
And that's something we hear about come June or whenever.

01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:47.620
We'll see.

01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:52.020
It would be nice, but yeah, we've been hoping for that for a long time now.

01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:53.020
Yeah.

01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:56.900
Dartesuya in chat says, yeah, Sony is really bending over backwards to drop the ball in

01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:58.580
this backwards compatibility stuff.

01:06:58.580 --> 01:06:59.580
And it sucks.

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:00.580
Yeah.

01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:01.740
And I mean, the same thing goes with the Vita and that stuff.

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:05.460
I mean, Jason mentioned in the intro tonight and I thought that was a great PSA.

01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:06.660
Sure.

01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:13.540
I might have downloaded games to my Vita and my PSP, but thanks to battery bloat and what

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:18.260
actually can happen to those batteries, those devices may not work anymore.

01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:20.960
And I can't exactly go buy replacements either.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:26.540
So my digital library on those consoles, gone forever.

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:32.260
Because for whatever reason, the PlayStation TV had to be a separate fucking thing and

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:36.140
couldn't have just been integrated into the PlayStation 4 or 5 to be able to play Vita

01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:37.140
games.

01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:38.140
I don't understand.

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:45.660
Well, you just see that the power of the PlayStation 5 cannot run a Vita game at this point.

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:47.180
It doesn't make any sense.

01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:48.180
It really doesn't.

01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:53.980
And again, why did I buy a Xbox Series X as compared to a PlayStation 5?

01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:58.100
A lot of it had to do with backwards compatibility and the fact that there weren't a ton of launch

01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:01.920
titles last year that were on either system that were very compelling.

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:06.880
So it was really about who I thought was going to handle the back library better.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:10.440
And I think I made the right choice with Microsoft, especially after hearing about all these fucking

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:14.200
hoops people have to jump through to get their Marvel's Avenger PlayStation 4 file to work

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.200
on PlayStation 5.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.200
It's ridiculous.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:17.200
All right.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:24.780
Anyway, let's move on and talk about a game that came out this week that's been having

01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:25.780
some...

01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:27.120
Oh, boy.

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.280
This game sounds like a hot ass fucking mess.

01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:30.280
And I'm going to...

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.280
Full disclaimer.

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.720
Because everybody's told me not to.

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:39.000
Even though I like the people behind it, everything I've heard about this game, the demo wasn't

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
good.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
The game's not good.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.400
And it's been having issues.

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.760
It's Balan Wonderworld.

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:50.800
And apparently, just to pour salt on the wound, the last boss fight decided to do this whole

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:55.160
flashing thing, which I don't know how this misses QHX and things like that.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:57.640
Or maybe it did get hit in the QHX.

01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:04.120
But even then, how did it not get prioritized as a must fix type of thing is the flashing

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:07.360
that happened on the final boss fight, which can even cause seizures.

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:10.440
It just wasn't prioritized, much like how...

01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:13.060
I think the same thing happened with Cyberpunk.

01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:14.060
They had the same issue.

01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:17.320
They had to tone it down.

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:21.820
So they did now, just to be clear, there is a day one patch for the game and the day one

01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:24.240
patch does handle the issue.

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:28.440
But for all those journalists that were reviewing the cop writing their negative reviews of

01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:32.840
the game in advance, that was sure a nasty little gotcha for those that got to the final

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:34.200
boss fight.

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:39.120
There is video of it on YouTube, but again, I just told you, it could make you sick.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.240
So I really wouldn't go seeking that out.

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:44.480
There's much more interesting things you could watch on YouTube.

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:53.920
So it's another kick in the ass of this game, which has just not been getting great.

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:59.560
Like buzz, great reviews or anything, which is weird because it's coming from Sonic, dude,

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:01.920
and you know, Phantasy Star Online and all that stuff.

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:06.560
I think the expectations were a lot higher and wow.

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:11.620
Shane is in chat saying, I don't have flashing light problems usually, but that video did

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:13.440
not make me feel the best.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.700
Darktitsuya said, yeah, I heard about this one.

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:17.400
Just glad they're fixing it day one.

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:19.200
So may try to get it at some point.

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:21.400
I did kind of like the demo.

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:24.480
It's out now, by the way, and it was fixed in that day one patch.

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:28.840
Just please make sure you get that patch before you get all the way to the final boss, because

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:32.280
this would be a nasty surprise sitting in the game.

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:33.280
That's a bummer.

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:35.760
Any interest in Balan Wonderworld from you, Loki?

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:36.760
It looked cool.

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:42.680
I just, you know, I have too many games right now that I haven't played, so.

01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:43.680
I don't know.

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:44.680
It looks like a very cool game.

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:45.680
It's just.

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:48.000
I probably won't buy it anytime soon.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
All right.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.080
Well, I think we need to take a trip down memory lane to a time when we had classic

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:58.400
games that didn't cause such headaches and check out that video, the video, man, that's

01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.400
a lot of flashing.

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:03.040
I don't know how that got past them.

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:05.840
That yeah, that seems like something that they should definitely have dressed.

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:06.840
I agree.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:07.840
Anyway, let's get to it.

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:12.240
The classic game of the week.

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:17.320
So this week to help us with the classic game of the week, since Dark Sakura is out tonight,

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:20.060
I have brought in a very special guest.

01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:23.140
One that I think is familiar to most of you O.L.R. regulars.

01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:24.920
Say hello, everybody, to Alan Alchemy.

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:25.920
Hey, Alan.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:26.920
Hello.

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.560
How are you doing?

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:29.560
I'm doing all right.

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:30.560
How are you?

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:31.560
I am good.

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.800
And thanks for being able to fill in tonight on short notice.

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:37.600
I guess it helps that you, you know, we live together and all that.

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:38.600
Yes.

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:39.600
All right.

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:40.600
So, you know the drill.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:43.040
Every week here on the show, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and picks a game that

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:46.460
she wants to highlight as the classic game of the week.

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:49.340
Although once a month, she puts a twist on it, but you're not doing that tonight.

01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:52.280
You're helping to fill in for a classic game.

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:56.020
So Alan, what have you picked for this week's classic game of the week?

01:11:56.020 --> 01:12:01.000
Well, when you ask me to pinch hit like this, I did have to take a look on Wikipedia and

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.280
see what came out 10 years ago, which is morbidly depressing because I could have swore that

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:09.520
a lot of those games came out three years ago, not 10.

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:12.680
So yeah.

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:18.020
I saw something that caught my eye that played for, uh, that I had played, uh, for a bit

01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:22.900
when it was fresh meme all back all the way back in October of 2010.

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:26.900
Um, it's actually a game that had a little bit of a preview in 2008.

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:32.580
I'll get to that in a moment, but I am talking about super meat boy, which came out on October

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:40.220
20th, 2010 for, I believe Xbox 360 live arcade came on, uh, became available on their online

01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:41.820
store for the Xbox.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:44.360
I cannot believe this game is 10 years old.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:49.240
Although I think I saw a tweet just a couple of days ago that said something like the time

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:54.720
between the super Nintendo and the Xbox three 60 release now matches the time between the

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:57.780
Xbox three 60 release and now something like that.

01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:05.000
So it's like, yeah, it's just like when the difference between now and Nirvana's, um,

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.760
smells like teen spirit when we were in high school was the same as like red Zeppelin's

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:09.880
houses, the Holies.

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:10.880
It's like, fuck off.

01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:13.100
You know, I don't need your factoids.

01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:14.220
I'm not interested.

01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:17.820
I'm not here for these reminders of, you know what?

01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:19.520
I don't like facts.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.000
Get them away from me.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.740
We don't like facts here at OLR.

01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:23.740
This is good.

01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:25.940
This is why I know I can always count on you to fill in the segment.

01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:26.940
All right.

01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:27.940
I'm sorry.

01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:28.940
So super meat boy.

01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:29.940
Yes.

01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:32.520
I spent plenty of hours on this myself.

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:38.960
So this game started out as a flash game on new grounds, uh, who remembers new grounds,

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.920
the sort of more innocent.

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:43.060
I don't want to say it's more innocent for a chance.

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:44.060
What does that make?

01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:45.060
What does that even mean?

01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:53.340
Um, it was new grounds was just a, a big cornucopia of amazing, weird off kilter content.

01:13:53.340 --> 01:14:00.660
You had salad fingers and like awesome games and ego Raptor from game grumps got to start

01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:01.660
on new grounds.

01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:07.800
And so did the behemoth studio that made alien hominid and also, um, castle crashers all

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.440
has roots in new grounds.

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:17.200
So a lot of like elder millennial and like gen X programmers really glommed on a new

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:21.540
grounds in the late nineties and eventually built careers that are still relevant to this

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:26.680
day at super meat boy is a game that was put out on new grounds and it got so much hype

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:32.360
and traffic that they were able to leverage that into a real, um, self published title.

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:40.840
Um, it was, uh, designed by Edmund McMillan and Tommy, uh, this is where I should probably

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:43.040
look up names before I try to say them.

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:51.360
Uh, Thomas Raffens, Tommy Raffens, apologies under the collective name of team Matt, much

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:58.920
better to say, um, this, uh, super meat boy to me, um, was a culmination of a lot of things

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:05.160
that were in sort of the ether in sort of like the self-published sort of bootleg ROM

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:11.620
type style games that were popular in the late two thousands, uh, games like I want

01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:20.600
to be the guy games like asshole, Mario, Ron hacks, basically that really pushed punishing

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:28.840
intense difficulty and repetition, memorization, um, super meat boy was, uh, it's a, it's a

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:29.840
platformer.

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:34.400
Um, the sprites are very small, but there's a lot of pixels and there's a lot of detail.

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.120
The soundtrack is incredible.

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:42.960
Um, as the super in the title evokes, it's very much a intentional retro aesthetic game.

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:47.880
It looks like it could have been made on the super NAS or Genesis, especially when you

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:50.400
get that awesome soundtrack.

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:57.840
And the plot of it, um, is you are a little ball of flash, honestly, um, who lives with

01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:02.160
his girlfriend bandage girl, cause he's constantly bleeding.

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:04.680
Um, and she's a bandaid.

01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:06.320
How could I be more obvious?

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:12.080
Um, one day bandage girl is kidnapped by Dr. Fetus and intelligent fetus and a life support

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:13.080
suit.

01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:16.800
Um, and it's, it's rescue the princess.

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:19.080
It's a rescue the princess game.

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:22.560
And there are a ton of levels.

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:27.560
Um, I don't know exactly how many, uh, but yeah, it is.

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:32.640
The type of game where you want to get from point A to point B, uh, you're navigating

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:36.000
these sort of scrolling levels that sometimes you go down.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.600
Sometimes you go to the right.

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:45.920
There's traps, bombs, spinning blades, double jumps that inquire very specific timing.

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:50.720
And when you die, you leave a ghost of your attempt.

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:57.200
And then as you finish the level, it will show you the ghosts of every attempt that

01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:02.680
you had needed to get to the fucking, whatever the objective is for that level.

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:03.680
That's very humbling.

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:07.400
When you would see a hundred of those little fuckers all over the screen, like just screwing

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:08.400
up left and right.

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.080
It is a mechanic.

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.080
It is a mechanic.

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:15.440
Sorry to interrupt it as the mechanic that they introduced or that they, that was replicated

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:20.920
in Mario maker because in Mario maker, you can see where everyone else dies.

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:22.320
No, that's very true.

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.320
Good point.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:30.200
And as a matter of fact, I think, and this is a little tinfoil hat for me, the fact that,

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:36.840
um, super meat boy got the sales that it did, given that we already had seen, um, ROM hacks

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:40.600
like asshole Mario, I want to be the guy and so on.

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:46.880
I don't think Nintendo really knew what the demand was like for a professionally done

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:51.800
suite of like, let's make, let's take super Mario brothers and make it hard as fuck.

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:55.160
Let's make it like, cause people were already doing that.

01:17:55.160 --> 01:18:00.880
And I think when this, I think put the writing on the wall where it's like, Oh, if we make

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:04.320
a Mario maker, it will be successful.

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:08.800
And the fact that that feature of the ghosts of all the previous attempts, even from online

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:14.480
people, just to see where most people die when they attempt the stage, the fact that

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:19.200
that brought India, it was brought into Mario maker to me is not a coincidence, but that's

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.200
just me.

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:26.920
He's sort of trying to be, you know, I mean, nobody can really prove that, but you know,

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:31.560
one could argue, it does seem like Nintendo may have taken influence from, you know, super

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:36.600
meat boy and what the indie community did for the Mario series, which in turn heavily

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:38.520
had influenced super meat boy in the first place.

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:39.520
It's just, it's very interesting.

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:43.960
I mean, again, we can't prove it, but it's, it's very interesting.

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:52.880
And I also believe that super meat boy success also gave the cup boy, um, developers the

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:57.920
sort of it's in the air sort of green light that they needed to motivate themselves to

01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:03.840
put out cup boy, like, Oh, there is a market there for incredibly stylized.

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:09.560
I mean the graphics in cup boy are based off of like thirties animation, but the quality

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:10.560
of the visuals is incredible.

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:12.200
It's not really a cup head.

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.200
Oh, cup head.

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.200
I'm sorry.

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:15.200
Okay.

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.200
Cup head.

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:25.800
Um, uh, they were like, Oh, so, and also dark souls came out in like 2009 question

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:30.400
mark, uh, dark, uh, demon souls came out 2000, what, five, seven.

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:36.880
Um, so that it was in the air that gamers were all a bunch of fucking masochists and

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:43.120
would like whip us, whip me, beat me, daddy and super me boy was more than happy to oblige

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:48.540
like dark souls, like all of these asshole Mario Ram hat.

01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:54.720
So and also, um, cup head, excuse me, of just really fucking difficult to the games.

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:59.480
Uh, super meat boy, the fact that it, I had never really heard of it cause I had fallen

01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:00.480
off of the new grounds.

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:02.440
I wasn't checking it like every day or every week.

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:05.520
Like I had in the nineties and early two thousands.

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:11.340
So, um, yeah, it was a game that was ultimately put out on every platform that you could think

01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:13.240
of because it's a digital footprint.

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.240
Isn't all about large.

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:20.040
It's a 2d scroller and it came out on the three 60 on windows proper.

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:21.860
I think it's on steam.

01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:22.860
It's on the Vita.

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:27.440
It's on the Wii U it's on the switch, it's on the PS four and there's a Linux build for

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:28.440
it.

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:30.240
It's everywhere.

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:37.120
And it's sequel, um, came out in December of this most recent year.

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:42.880
So that's a pretty significant gap between the original game and the sequel and it wasn't

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.280
quite as well received.

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:45.280
That's for sure.

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:46.440
But I do want to, isn't it a runner?

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:47.440
Didn't they change it up?

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.080
And I think it's more like an endless runner.

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:53.600
Um, but, uh, the, uh, three 60, I think is always going to be my favorite version because

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:56.400
I, sorry, but the soundtrack is way better than that one.

01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:00.480
And I realized they ended up having some disputes and so they ended up having the soundtrack

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:01.480
completely rewritten.

01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:05.880
Um, but in my opinion, that original soundtrack was, was superior to the new one, no offense

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:07.760
to any composers involved.

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:09.240
That's just my opinion.

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.240
Yeah.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:16.080
Um, yeah, I barely see, I played this for a bit and then I got distracted by something

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.080
else.

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:24.240
So, um, I can't necessarily say that I've beaten this game top to bottom and done every

01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:25.440
level 10 times.

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:29.120
Um, but this definitely caught my attention for a bit and it, it, it's a unique enough

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:35.440
title that, um, I wanted to make sure that it got a spotlight in classic game.

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:42.360
Meat Boy, um, has made cameos in, uh, roughly a dozen, if not more, uh, titles.

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:48.880
He's appeared as an unlockable or DLC character in Bit.Trip Runner, Bit.Trip Fate, uh, Runner

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:56.480
2, um, Spelunky, Dust and Elysian Tail, Ori and the Blind Forest, Retro City Rampage,

01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:01.720
uh, Ilomilo and Indie Pogo.

01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:09.120
Um, PETA came out with, and here's the thing that I hate about, I mean, PETA is just a

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:14.220
horrific like organization, whatever their mission statement is there, they're bad.

01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:19.460
There's other ways to, to, um, I guess make their talking points that don't have to come

01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:21.540
out of their platform in particular.

01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:26.540
But one thing that frustrates me about them is that when they put out a parody flash video

01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:29.020
game, they hire good flash programmers.

01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:33.660
If you remember the tofu cookie mama game that came out for Thanksgiving, that game

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:35.300
was a jam.

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:39.500
That was a good flash game where you had to like carve the tof- the tofurkey and like

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:40.920
put the stuffing in it.

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.300
It was a fun game.

01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:47.980
Um, so PETA in protest of this game, even though I don't necessarily know that Super

01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:52.380
Meat Boy is made of beef, I think he's just like, he's just blood.

01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:53.780
I don't know what he is.

01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:55.900
He's married to a bandaid.

01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:59.820
I don't think, I don't think, no one told PETA that it wasn't that serious, but they

01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:07.860
came out with a parody flash game called Super Tofu Boy, um, on December 1st of 2010 to protest

01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:10.380
the game and promote veganism.

01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:13.520
Um, I don't think you eat or cook anything in Super Meat Boy.

01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:16.020
You're just a ball of blood trying to rescue his girlfriend.

01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:18.820
So again, it's not, it's not that deep.

01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:24.320
Um, but in response, Team Meat, uh, added its own interpretation of Tofu Boy on the

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:27.700
PC version of actual, uh, Super Meat Boy.

01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:30.220
So yeah, I think he was a character in the Steam version.

01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:34.940
Um, the game success, again, I mentioned this before, spurred the development of the 1930

01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:36.900
style animated video game Cuphead.

01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:37.900
Interesting.

01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:38.900
All right.

01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:40.300
All right.

01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:44.260
Well, there it is your classic game of the week, Super Meat Boy.

01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:46.140
Very good pick, Alan.

01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:47.140
Thank you.

01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:51.060
Um, Hey, before I let you go, um, I know you've been doing a lot more streaming here on Twitch

01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:52.060
recently.

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:56.900
Um, and you know, we've even hosted your channel a couple of times after OLR, but for our podcast

01:23:56.900 --> 01:24:00.780
crowd, um, who doesn't, you know, um, get those, you know, hosting things on Twitch

01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:01.780
and stuff.

01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:02.900
Do you want to tell us really quick about your channel?

01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:05.300
Cause you've been, you've been doing like a lot more streaming.

01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:08.460
I know I've talked about streaming, but you've been really committed to it over the past

01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:12.060
month and what you're up past a hundred followers now, which for somebody just starting out

01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:13.700
in their first month, that's really incredible.

01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:14.700
You're doing great.

01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:16.660
Um, you want to tell us a little more about your channel?

01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:17.660
Yeah.

01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:21.540
Um, I've, I haven't quite had a solid week where I've stuck to the schedule that I've

01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:26.420
sort of designed for myself, but I have consistently done about three nights a week, if not four,

01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:27.420
which is pretty good.

01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:28.700
I've been doing it for a little over a month.

01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:34.220
My Twitch channel is AlanAlchemy, A-L-L-E-N, A-L-C-H-E-M-Y.

01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:39.020
My Twitter is AlanA-L-L-E-N underscore T-T-V.

01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:44.140
I'm a variety streamer focusing right now on Dead by Daylight, but of a more important

01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:50.300
interest to OLR listeners is that on Monday I decided to do Music Night Mondays where

01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:52.700
I try out various music games.

01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:59.140
A lot of it so far has been a retro, um, music games of established, you know, nostalgic

01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:00.140
properties.

01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:01.340
I haven't done Parappa the Rapper yet.

01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:04.700
I don't know if I will because I never really clicked with Parappa, believe it or not, but

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:08.180
I've been doing a lot of Bust a Groove in the US.

01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:09.180
It's called Bust a Move.

01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:10.500
I have the Japanese versions.

01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:11.500
Thank you very much.

01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:15.820
So I've been playing Bust a Move, but the dance game, not the, um, the Marvel puzzle

01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:16.820
game.

01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:18.500
Um, I've been doing lots of Space Channel Five.

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:22.980
I did Rez last Monday, which was a lot of fun.

01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:29.180
Um, so I may eventually broaden that to do stuff like Jet Set Radio or Jet Grind Radio

01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:31.660
because that's very much a music game in my opinion.

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:40.740
Um, but yeah, when I'm not doing Music Night Mondays, um, I am focusing on Dead by Daylight

01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:47.500
and I've thrown in some, um, beefcake slutty Skyrim, um, for the, for the gay, for the

01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:52.220
gay men out there and the, uh, women who like to look at, um, barbarians who aren't wearing

01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:53.220
a lot of clothing.

01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:57.300
Um, it's a lot safer to broadcast than perhaps, um, what is it?

01:25:57.300 --> 01:26:04.540
Bitchin' Bad Conan, whatever that game is with the, with the full schlong, um, but yeah,

01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:05.540
it's a good time.

01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:06.540
All right.

01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:11.580
I hope, I hope our podcast listeners will check that out over at, um, Alan Alchemy on

01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:16.320
Twitch and, um, hope you're able to continue growing your channel and, um, good luck with

01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:18.620
all the, uh, Dead by Daylight and all that good stuff.

01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:21.620
You know, one thing, um, I really enjoy when I'm watching your channel and, you know, I'm

01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:25.580
not just saying this cause like we're married and stuff, but, um, is that I like that you

01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:28.420
kind of explain, you know, I didn't know a lot about Dead by Daylight and there's a

01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:31.980
lot of people on Twitch that stream Dead by Daylight, but when I first watched you do

01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:35.620
it, you were really kind of explaining the why behind a lot of things you were doing.

01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:37.620
And I think that really helped me understand the game.

01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:39.740
And I know you've been doing that with a lot of the other stuff you play.

01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:43.260
So I definitely encourage, um, you know, I know a lot of people on Twitch kind of be

01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:46.980
like, I'm a variety streamer, but I like a variety streamer who kind of like also educates

01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:48.020
a little bit on games.

01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:49.020
And I think you do very good.

01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:50.020
Yeah.

01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:53.780
I don't know if I could ever just be a one game streamer because a lot of people on Twitch

01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:57.620
are successful because they play Dark Souls or Fortnite and that is all they're allowed

01:26:57.620 --> 01:26:59.940
to play by their fan base.

01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:03.960
So yeah, I'm not going to pigeonhole myself like that, but I definitely do think that

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:05.820
Dead by Daylight is a really fun game.

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:06.820
All right.

01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:10.620
Well, thank you for joining us tonight and, uh, filling in last minute here on the classic

01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:15.260
game of the week when dark soccer is out tonight, um, we'll, uh, ask everybody to follow you

01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:19.260
on Twitch again over at Alan Alchemy, and we'll see you back on the show again soon.

01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:20.940
I'm sure Alan have a good one.

01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:21.940
All right.

01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:22.940
Thank you.

01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:24.100
All right.

01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:28.020
Thanks once again to Alan for filling in, uh, on this week's classic game of the week.

01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:29.300
That was a great selection there.

01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:30.300
Super Meat Boy.

01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:32.620
Loki, you've dropped a lot of hours on that game too, right?

01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:33.620
Super Meat Boy.

01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:40.220
Um, yeah, I've played through, I think the single, like I, I think the original game,

01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:45.740
I, I don't know if I beat it or I freak, I might've beaten it.

01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:48.860
I don't remember, but yeah, I played through a lot of that.

01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:51.820
Well, one thing we didn't end up getting into in that segment was the whole fact that there's

01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:54.100
like the light world and the dark world.

01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:57.180
So maybe like you played through the light world stages and it's like, Oh, the dark world

01:27:57.180 --> 01:27:58.180
ones were even harder.

01:27:58.180 --> 01:28:03.140
I did the dark world stuff too, um, hard levels to go back and look, but it's been a while,

01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:08.940
but yeah, I did play through that quite a bit, um, a while back, but yeah, it's a great

01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:09.940
game.

01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:10.940
All right.

01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:12.900
Well, thanks again to Alan for filling in with very little notice tonight.

01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:13.900
Appreciate that.

01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:17.420
All right, let's get to some rapid fire news and check out some other things going on in

01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:18.420
the industry.

01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:20.500
Loki, start us off, please.

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:21.500
Yeah.

01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:23.860
So, um, this is pretty cool.

01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:29.580
We've got some updates for a relatively old game, serious Sam too.

01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:33.700
Um, and this is kind of actually a little bit like the story we talked about last week

01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:40.740
with grant the photo online and how we had some independent developers creating mods

01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:42.900
to update a game and make it better.

01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:45.300
And then that being released officially.

01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:46.540
So that's kind of what happened here.

01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:52.780
Uh, we had an independent developer, Nathan DWK Brown released a huge update for serious

01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:54.920
Sam too.

01:28:54.920 --> 01:29:01.340
And it, um, it's basically the last update or the first update since the game launched.

01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:05.940
Um, I don't know, like almost 15 years ago, it's been, it's been a while since they've

01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:10.820
had an update and, uh, you know, added a lot of different things to it.

01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:16.660
So some of the things added a couple of new weapons, um, sprinting, dual wielding rocket

01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:23.700
jumping and visual up and, or updates to the visuals and animation, uh, radar that tracks

01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:27.000
enemies, NPCs and new objectives.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.860
So that's a pretty major overall.

01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:36.220
Um, that's pretty awesome to see like an older game like that, get some love like that.

01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:42.020
And you know, uh, crow team actually did partner with them to, uh, release that update.

01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:43.940
So, uh, it's pretty awesome.

01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:48.980
And according to the announces says, I hope all, uh, hope that all that was done helps

01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:51.460
keep the game enjoyable for a long time to come.

01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:54.620
Um, if that works out, it was all worth it.

01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:56.900
Long live serious Sam too.

01:29:56.900 --> 01:29:58.740
So pretty awesome.

01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:04.900
Um, now this brand new game that's coming out here, Outriders, uh, which is coming out

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:10.540
soon, they are planning to, uh, mark cheaters in the game.

01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:17.420
Um, so if they catch someone cheating, they're actually going to brand them as a cheater.

01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:29.460
And apparently they said out of the, um, demo players, only about 0.01% of them were cheaters,

01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:34.220
but, um, they said that every single one of the cheaters who gave themselves, you know,

01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:41.660
I guess 600, um, ill gotten legendary weapons, uh, apparently are going to be banned or they're

01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:45.180
not gonna be banned, but they're going to be punished in other ways for starters, there'll

01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:49.340
be kept in separate, um, or kept separately from legit players.

01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:53.780
So like some of the other games, including grants that online, um, they'll make you basically

01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:55.920
play with other cheaters.

01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:59.740
And they're also going to give you a small discreet, but easiest spot Mark that will

01:30:59.740 --> 01:31:01.040
be added to your HUD.

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:07.480
So, um, if you're a popular streamer and you're cheating, they will be able to see

01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:08.480
that you're cheating.

01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:09.480
Interesting.

01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:12.360
It's like the Scarlet letter, but for cheaters.

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:13.360
Yeah.

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:18.760
So some of the things of course that would be, um, considered cheating, they said intentionally

01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:24.600
running a game on PC without easy anti-cheat modifying game files to enhance character,

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:30.160
uh, level skills and inventory, et cetera, extremely modifying the game to reduce time

01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:35.680
dependent features such as vendors and challenges using a trainer program or similar to gain

01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:39.920
advantages within the game and use the gameplay altering programs such as aim bots or wall

01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:40.920
hacks.

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:41.920
Hmm.

01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:42.920
So, all right.

01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:49.560
Don't you, they're out to mark you, um, uh, Shane and chat says, what even is Outriders?

01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:53.600
Should I be excited for it and do the early download on Xbox series X?

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:58.280
Isn't it, is it, isn't it like a West, like a Western, but like robots kind of like loot

01:31:58.280 --> 01:31:59.840
shooter type of thing in it.

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:01.320
Is that for my Square Enix?

01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:09.640
Um, I don't necessarily, it looks a lot like, um, uh, like, I don't know, it looks a lot

01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:11.960
like destiny two or something like that.

01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:18.820
So I don't know if, what exactly it is per se, um, but it looks neat.

01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:22.360
It is a cooperative third person role-playing game.

01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:25.800
Um, and it's, uh, published by Square Enix in Europe.

01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:30.280
Um, and they're saying it's a third person shooter, but it's mixed with elements from

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:31.720
role-playing games.

01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:35.880
So you customize your characters and you choose from four classes, including the trickster,

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:41.080
the pyromancer, the Devastator, and the technomancer, um, and, uh, the basic skills you have have

01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:42.080
a cool down time.

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:45.800
So again, that sounds very much like destiny, uh, and then a skill tree that you use to

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:47.480
unlock and upgrade skills.

01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:51.080
You can use weapons like shotguns and, uh, assault rifles.

01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:56.000
Um, and, um, well, you know, DJRMS says it's first person, not third.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.960
It's interesting cause I'm reading off the like official little script thing.

01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:01.480
So I don't know why they're classifying it that way.

01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:04.720
Um, let's see, uh, there's various role-playing elements.

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:08.680
So you can explore different hub areas, talk to NPCs, do side missions.

01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:10.280
There's dialogue trees.

01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:14.000
That's something destiny doesn't have, uh, that can affect the outcome of some conversations.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.780
You can play solo or with two other players.

01:33:16.780 --> 01:33:21.480
And it's about humanities efforts to colonize Enoch, uh, where, uh, there was a massive

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:25.780
energy storm known as the anomaly, uh, which is, uh, supposed to be indicating hope for

01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:27.240
humanities feature.

01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:30.580
And that's where some of the, um, superpowers, I guess, come from.

01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:31.580
So there you go.

01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:34.300
Uh, Shane and chat says I can make a character.

01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:36.860
I mean, that's probably enough for me to make me want to try it.

01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:37.860
Yep.

01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:38.860
You can.

01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:39.860
All right.

01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:40.860
Yeah.

01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:41.860
I mean, it looks interesting.

01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:42.860
Yeah.

01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:43.860
I'll, I'll probably check it out.

01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:45.900
I've been hearing good things about it based on the demo.

01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:47.020
All right.

01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:48.020
Uh, moving on to some other games.

01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:51.940
So this is a game, uh, that's, uh, very popular is rocket league.

01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:52.940
And it's kind of surprising.

01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:54.220
We don't have it on mobile phones.

01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:57.300
Well, we're going to be getting a version of it on mobile phones, kind of a different

01:33:57.300 --> 01:34:00.420
sort of game, but it's going to be on iOS and Android.

01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:07.500
Um, it's rocket league side swipe, and you can play in solo games in this or team up

01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:11.140
with a friend or two, uh, for two, two versus two matches.

01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:13.060
And those will last for two minutes each.

01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:16.940
Uh, the perspective is a 2d side on view.

01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:17.940
So it's a little bit different.

01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:21.260
And that way you use touch controls that are a little bit easier to pick up.

01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:25.500
So, uh, they're gonna hopefully do free to play kind of similar to how rocket league

01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:26.500
is now.

01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:30.180
So there's that, uh, DJ Rama S by the way, correcting himself in chat saying, yes, it

01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:31.580
is third person.

01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:33.380
All right.

01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:40.120
Uh, also in rapid fire news, a ghost of Tsushima movie is coming with John wick directing.

01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:44.360
So yeah, this is another big video game going into the movie territory.

01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:48.300
And of course this one, a lot of, you know, game of the year types of awards.

01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:52.720
So it's, it's maybe just surprising that the whole thing isn't a franchise yet becoming

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:55.560
a movie, but it's, uh, it's going to become a movie.

01:34:55.560 --> 01:35:01.280
Uh, so Chad Stalski who made the John wick franchise, uh, or directed it, I should say

01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:02.920
is going to be directing this.

01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:03.920
So that's pretty cool.

01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:08.040
A deadline, uh, reported on it and Sony confirmed it.

01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:09.360
So pretty cool.

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:14.000
Of course, we have no idea when it's coming out, but, you know, give it two years.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:19.560
Probably take a little while, especially, uh, with the pandemic still sort of like,

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:20.560
are we ending?

01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:23.680
Are we not like still trying to figure out where that's all at.

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:25.240
All right.

01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:29.240
So we've been experiencing a little bit of a technical difficulties live on Twitch.

01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:33.120
Um, so we're going to pick up our show again here, sorry, going to create for a little

01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:37.920
bit of an awkward podcast, but, uh, you know, Hey, at least, uh, we'll have a podcast this

01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:38.800
week.

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:43.800
So I believe the, uh, recording started to, uh, get a little dicey when we were getting

01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:45.080
into release dates.

01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:46.080
So let's try that again.

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:47.080
Loki.

01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:49.920
Uh, apparently we had a bumpy flight the first time let's travel around the world again and

01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:53.760
check out some release dates starting in the U S there's too much Kingdom hearts for the

01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:56.560
stream to handle clearly.

01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:02.920
So this week we've gotten to me, uh, Neptunia virtual stars coming out on PC, Disco Elysium,

01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:08.200
the final cut on PC, Mac, PlayStation four, PlayStation five and stadia.

01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:13.520
We have evil genius to world domination, a whole bunch of Kingdom hearts.

01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:21.440
So we've got Kingdom hearts, HD 1.5 remix, 2.5 remix, 2.8 final chapter prologue three

01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:26.580
plus remind and melody of memory all coming out on PC.

01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:32.640
We have Narita boy on PC, Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one rogue company

01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:39.840
on PlayStation five, the binding of Isaac repentance on PC.

01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:48.480
We have death crown on Nintendo switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one and Tucci on PC, Nintendo

01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:50.040
switch and Xbox one.

01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:51.040
All right.

01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:56.280
Well, before we had our little technical hiccup, a couple more things, uh, outriders and resident

01:36:56.280 --> 01:37:01.520
evil seven biohazard, both coming to stadia outriders also coming out on PC PlayStation

01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:04.680
four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series X.

01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:06.680
Uh, do you have a price on Disco Elysium?

01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:13.120
Paley Hanumaya and chat is wondering Disco Elysium, uh, on which system?

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:17.360
I mean, I assume it's all like 60 bucks, but let's see here.

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:18.360
I don't know.

01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:19.960
What do I look like?

01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:24.920
GameStop act deaf to chat is guessing this is what the internet is for.

01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:25.920
Okay.

01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:26.920
All right.

01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:27.920
31 99.

01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:28.920
All right.

01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:29.920
Thank you.

01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:30.920
All right.

01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:32.760
Uh, traveling over to Japan.

01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:36.120
So we were talking a little bit before the technical hiccups about outriders.

01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:38.400
That is also coming out in Japan on April the first.

01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:40.460
So that is coming out on the PlayStation five.

01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:43.000
It is also coming out on the PlayStation four.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.780
And quite honestly, that is really the only release this week.

01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:49.280
It's a pretty, uh, uneventful week in Japan otherwise.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.600
So let's move on to the UK.

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:54.360
Loki, uh, the UK, we didn't have a whole lot coming out.

01:37:54.360 --> 01:38:00.320
We have also outriders coming out on PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox series X, Xbox

01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:03.080
one and stadia.

01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:09.520
And then we also got, um, monster truck, uh, it was like monster truck rally, which is

01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:13.620
coming out on, uh, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:18.280
So, uh, as the show 100, Matt and chat wants to know when his battle totes coming out since

01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:23.160
you were already at boat, but you can get it on game pass.

01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:24.160
He can.

01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:25.160
All right.

01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:26.880
Uh, let's get back into some other news.

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:27.880
Uh, Loki.

01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:28.880
Oh boy.

01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:29.880
More rumors.

01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:30.880
Boy, my favorite.

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:31.880
Yeah.

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:36.720
Well, it's, it's more adding onto the same rumors that we've already had, uh, regarding

01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:40.880
an upgraded Nintendo switch that's coming out later this year, uh, according to a Bloomberg

01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:46.040
report, they're saying that it's going to be powered by a new, uh, Nvidia system on

01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:52.320
chip that's in the dock using to, uh, they're going to be using that chip to upscale the

01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:56.680
graphics to four K and the way they're going to be doing that is kind of similar to how

01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:04.440
the RTX, uh, graphics cards kind of do it right now, um, using DLSS, which is basically

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:10.260
a deep learning super sampling, which allows them to basically take a very, uh, low resolution

01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:17.960
image and, um, use AI to sharpen it and also kind of enhance the, um, image altogether.

01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:20.360
They I've some modern games have been using it.

01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:24.660
Like for example, I know cyberpunk uses that, um, it looks nice.

01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:27.020
So it is a pretty cool technology.

01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:31.680
Um, along with that, there's some other rumors regarding the pricing.

01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:36.940
They're saying that the pricing, not supposed to be about three 49 to three 99, uh, it's

01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:42.980
supposed to be out sometime this year, but, uh, I'm wondering what the DLSS, if that'll

01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:47.020
enable them to do, you know, be able to run some of these games that they haven't been

01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:48.020
able to run already.

01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:52.780
Um, but we'll have to see, I mean, that's really kind of just talking about the dock

01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:53.780
right now.

01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:55.740
Um, but that's all rumors.

01:39:55.740 --> 01:40:00.420
I know I'm getting so tired of these switch pro rumors, like Nintendo read the room.

01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:03.620
Like everybody is sleek in this stuff left and right.

01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:04.620
Just give us something.

01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:08.460
I think they will in June, if they don't announce something by June, then I don't know what

01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:10.460
the hell's going on.

01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:12.140
Yeah.

01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:14.260
And I maybe, maybe April 1st.

01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:15.260
Yeah.

01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:18.660
I wouldn't believe anything you read on the internet on April 1st, but now it's getting

01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:22.100
into this weird thing where like companies are actually doing things on April 1st, right?

01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:24.180
Like Outriders is actually coming out April 1st.

01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:25.180
That's not a joke.

01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:26.180
It's a Friday.

01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:27.180
Yeah.

01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:28.180
Friday release date, I think.

01:40:28.180 --> 01:40:29.180
No, that's not Friday.

01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:30.180
That's a Thursday.

01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:31.180
Why is it coming out on Thursday?

01:40:31.180 --> 01:40:32.180
I don't know.

01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:33.180
That's a weird day.

01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:34.180
Yeah.

01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:35.180
Should be the second.

01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:36.180
So Wednesday is a holiday here in California.

01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:37.180
So, uh, which is the 31st.

01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:38.820
So I know April 1st is a Friday.

01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:39.820
So yeah.

01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:41.820
All right.

01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:44.020
Anyway, let's move on.

01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:49.140
Uh, actually Shane in chat, uh, says, I just want to see what exclusives look like on it.

01:40:49.180 --> 01:40:53.660
Um, yeah, that would be, uh, the Nintendo first party games, the limited, uh, Mario

01:40:53.660 --> 01:40:54.660
3D All-Stars.

01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:56.020
You can no longer buy what it might look like.

01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:59.380
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf is also pointing out Friday is Good Friday.

01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:00.820
So that might be why.

01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:04.240
So maybe they don't want to release a game on Good Friday cause there's, you know, people

01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:06.540
that are, are partaking in religious service that day.

01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:07.540
I don't know.

01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:08.540
Who knows?

01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:12.260
I wouldn't think it would be that many, but I guess, I guess so.

01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:13.420
All right.

01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:18.080
Let's move on to, I guess another rumor of sorts, although this one is being backed by

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:19.760
the wall street journal.

01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:23.480
So there's probably some inside sources that are talking a little bit about this.

01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:29.520
And that is that Microsoft is apparently in talks to acquire discord and the price tag

01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:32.240
may set them back $10 billion.

01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:36.840
Um, and the wall street journal is going off of other reports from venture beat and Bloomberg.

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:42.680
Uh, apparently these talks are being called advanced and exclusive and could result in

01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:44.400
a deal next month.

01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:46.000
However, it should be stated.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.840
Nothing is set in stone.

01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:50.080
Apparently there are other suitors out there as well.

01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:54.120
I have heard, um, Amazon's name being thrown around as well, which, you know, as you know,

01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:55.120
owns Twitch TV.

01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:57.720
Um, and there was another big one that was getting thrown around too.

01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:03.400
And discord may just go public, um, as a company because you know what fucking Roblox went

01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:05.000
public not that long ago.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000
They've done pretty well for themselves.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.480
Um, and there's been, you know, other entertainment gaming companies that have gone public, uh,

01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:11.480
and are doing pretty well.

01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:13.880
So discord may go that direction.

01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:20.720
Microsoft is, according to Bloomberg, interested in looking at getting discord, um, as a place

01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:26.480
to talk for the communities that are using it, not just the gamers on Xbox live.

01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:30.080
That is also kind of interesting to know is that Microsoft may not be looking at this

01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:34.560
as just a gaming platform, but certainly what's happened during the pandemic, you've seen

01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:38.740
a lot of community growth on a place like discord and sure that goes things for like

01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:40.040
video games and so forth.

01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:44.760
We have our own discord here at vog network, cheap plug, fognetwork.com slash discord.

01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:49.640
Um, but like D and D campaigns, which I suppose is also gaming, but then you also see other

01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:53.600
like other types of communities coming together through discord.

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:56.840
Um, although certainly gaming is a huge part of that as well.

01:42:56.840 --> 01:43:00.720
Loki, what do you think when you hear the news that Microsoft might acquire discord?

01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:05.880
Cause I could see mixed opinions here because you know, Microsoft didn't really end up doing

01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:09.520
the, the beam TV or mixer so well.

01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:14.440
They ended up selling that I didn't go really very far, but then they've also bought LinkedIn

01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:18.640
get hub and everybody was screaming with get hub that the sky is falling and it hasn't

01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:19.640
really fallen yet.

01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:25.040
So let's say this is true and Microsoft does opt to buy discord.

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:27.840
Do you think this is good for them and what are they going to do with it?

01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:33.240
I hope they integrate it with Skype because that would suck, but other than that, I don't

01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:34.240
know.

01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:35.720
I hope it's a replacement for Skype.

01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:39.760
Frankly, I'll worry about it when there's something to worry about.

01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:40.760
That's true.

01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:43.040
Um, that's, that's very true.

01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:46.760
Um, dart to see you in chat says, initially I was concerned, but after listening to Bobby

01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:50.440
tonight, I think I feel a little better about the situation, so maybe it won't be so bad.

01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:53.960
And Bobby went really in depth on this in, on this subject on his show tonight.

01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:57.020
And you know, he, he had kind of brought up some of those other examples about the websites

01:43:57.020 --> 01:43:59.240
that Microsoft bought that have done okay.

01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:01.840
And not everything is necessarily the sky is falling.

01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:07.600
I can see though, where maybe something has to change when it comes to discord.

01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:11.960
You know, where are they really making money right now off of those nitro subscriptions

01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:14.400
that aren't really required.

01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:19.520
And how many people in those communities are really paying for those subscriptions?

01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:20.920
Probably not a ton.

01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:26.000
Um, I pay for it cause I want to boost the VoG network server because you know, that

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:29.720
should be something that, you know, we do to lift up the server and Bobby got into this

01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:33.720
on this show, if VoG network is a business could just pay 20 bucks a month or whatever

01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:35.080
to boost our server.

01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:36.460
We would do that, but we can't.

01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:40.880
So I have, I have discord pro just because I use discord a lot and I want to boost the

01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:44.000
VoG server to at least the next level.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.840
Um, but where would Microsoft really make money?

01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:53.240
I think we would all be very upset if we saw them go up like to a place where Slack went,

01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:56.680
where you have to pay to have a server or you're going to start losing messages.

01:44:56.680 --> 01:45:00.240
You get really annoyed by all the prompts that start coming up.

01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:02.200
So I don't really see that happening either.

01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:07.140
And one thing that kind of occurred to me and I was always really surprised by this.

01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:11.480
Do you remember when discord launched a game store and then they tried to do their own

01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:14.200
game pass type of thing as well through nitro?

01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:19.600
I was really surprised that didn't do so well because I thought it was a brilliant idea

01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:26.300
that discord kind of stealth and solved itself onto all of these systems and on your phone

01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:30.620
as, Hey, this great free messaging app, but as we know, nothing's really free.

01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:35.680
So I thought by putting that store on there, that's how they were going to really make

01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:40.880
some money was basically like they, they, they got something that people wanted to put

01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:41.880
on their computers.

01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:43.820
Unlike when steam first came out.

01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:47.960
If you guys remember when steam first came out, people were pissed that you like had

01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:48.960
to have that to play.

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:51.940
I think it was like half life two at the time.

01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:57.320
So I really wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft does acquire discord, that they may try to

01:45:57.320 --> 01:46:01.800
do something with their store in it, but then they say they don't necessarily want it to

01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:05.340
be tied to gamers, but I just, I would have a hard time believing they wouldn't try to

01:46:05.340 --> 01:46:11.280
sell some of their products directly there through the application and do some tie-ins

01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:12.280
there.

01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:16.880
Loki, how do you think discord could be profitable?

01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:21.520
I mean, integrating it with game pass would be good if they could, you know, if Microsoft

01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:25.480
does end up purchasing them.

01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:26.480
I don't know.

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:32.860
I mean, I think definitely giving more power to the folks that have servers and allowing

01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:37.720
them to upgrade them, however they need, you know, whether that be, you know, adding additional

01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:46.340
bandwidth to the video or, you know, other features that may be in there, I don't know.

01:46:46.340 --> 01:46:52.540
Does discord have any sort of like searchability or ways to actually have like stuff displayed?

01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:56.860
Because like, I know there's like billions of different, I can't imagine billions, but

01:46:56.860 --> 01:47:00.780
like probably several hundred thousand servers out there.

01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:05.180
I think if you're like a discord partner or affiliate or something that you apply for,

01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:10.340
you can get listed in some type of directory that they have, but not every server is by

01:47:10.340 --> 01:47:12.060
default in this directory.

01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:15.020
It's something that you apply for.

01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:19.180
Now Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I still think they're going to try to make discord

01:47:19.180 --> 01:47:20.700
with Xbox party chat.

01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:21.980
That would be pretty cool.

01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:24.180
You want me to take that one step further?

01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:28.940
Because here's where I tell you where a Microsoft and discord partnership gets really fucking

01:47:28.940 --> 01:47:29.940
exciting.

01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:33.540
I'll give you an example that goes a step beyond that that just occurred to me.

01:47:33.540 --> 01:47:39.060
With Microsoft getting really into this cloud gaming thing, what if I could sit here in

01:47:39.060 --> 01:47:44.100
my home, Loki sits there in his home, and through discord now showing us a screen of

01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:48.580
the game we're playing, we're now playing a game online together through the cloud thanks

01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:51.880
to discord that's embedded in our community.

01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:55.300
And that streaming technology, which is the only thing Microsoft kept from their whole

01:47:55.300 --> 01:47:58.340
beam acquisition.

01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:05.820
I mean, it's an awful lot of wishes and gosh, I hope it goes the way I want it to and maybe

01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:11.580
not enough reality check, but I don't know, Phil Spencer's pretty cool, but he won't be

01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:15.580
the head of discord, sadly, and especially with Microsoft saying it's not all about gaming.

01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:21.500
I don't know, but I think that would be a pretty cool thing to be frank.

01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:22.500
We'll see.

01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:27.480
Now, a lot of people are bringing up Microsoft teams, which is a little bit more of a direct

01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:31.500
Slack competitor and people are wondering if there could be emerging here.

01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:34.780
I still see teams as more of a professional type of thing, sort of like LinkedIn as a

01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:36.380
professional social network.

01:48:36.380 --> 01:48:41.780
I'm not sure that would fit the bill, but maybe Microsoft is totally okay having like

01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:46.180
your daytime chat app and your nighttime chat app.

01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:51.660
I prefer discord over teams.

01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:56.380
Discord is much snappier than teams as teams feels very bloaty and heavy.

01:48:56.380 --> 01:49:03.940
I just, I would prefer if given the choice between using teams or discord, I would go

01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:04.940
discord 100%.

01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:07.380
Well, and then maybe that's something that Microsoft wants to get in on.

01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:08.380
I don't know.

01:49:08.380 --> 01:49:13.700
SG100map says, regardless, we won't see the full effects of the purchase until 18 months

01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:16.260
after the sale, which will take a while.

01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:17.300
We will see.

01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:18.300
We will see.

01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:22.380
Bonds006 says, if only they allow me to do that, as you said it, Rob, but right, yeah,

01:49:22.380 --> 01:49:26.640
I know I'm doing a lot of wishful thinking, but I'm trying to also present some scenarios

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:30.620
that I'd like to think are realistic without necessarily being doom and gloom.

01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:35.380
And that would be, oh, Microsoft buy something else just to close it.

01:49:35.380 --> 01:49:36.380
I still don't understand.

01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:38.820
Well, no, I do understand why they closed Mixer.

01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:43.500
They had a really hard time attracting the volume of the other places because, and it's

01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:44.700
just this simple.

01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:49.220
Anybody that wants to go up against Twitch, take notes.

01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:55.060
If you don't have a way for your broadcasters to make money and they see a path to being

01:49:55.060 --> 01:49:59.140
able to make money and advertise and may enable revenue on their streams and stuff, you can

01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:01.340
have a real hard time attracting talent.

01:50:01.340 --> 01:50:05.220
And that was the problem with Mixer, period.

01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:09.620
Now some people preferred Mixer because as an Xbox centric platform, it was a little

01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:12.660
easier to get noticed over there in a different type of community.

01:50:12.660 --> 01:50:15.440
So you can kind of stick out in a smaller community.

01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:16.440
And I respect that.

01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:19.940
And again, I have great friends who are broadcasting on Mixer and so forth.

01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:24.900
But the reality was Mixer was always going to lag behind Twitch because Twitch has a

01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:28.300
very easy path for their broadcasters.

01:50:28.300 --> 01:50:30.960
Not easy, but you know what it is.

01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:35.140
You know what the rules are and you have your little goals and the goalposts is right there

01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:36.320
and you know what you got to do.

01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:37.320
And it's achievable.

01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:43.120
Whereas, sure, Mixer had a path to partner, it wasn't an easy thing to do at all, especially

01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:45.580
on a smaller kind of network.

01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:51.980
The good news here is that if Microsoft buys Discord, there's nothing bigger than Discord

01:50:51.980 --> 01:50:52.980
right now.

01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:53.980
There really isn't.

01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:57.540
As far as nighttime chat apps and groups, some may say, well, Slack is really a bigger

01:50:57.540 --> 01:50:58.540
thing.

01:50:58.540 --> 01:51:04.100
And I think when it comes to these types of hobbyist, gaming hobbyist, arts and crafts

01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:08.380
hobbyists and the things we've really relied on during the pandemic, Discord is the huge

01:51:08.380 --> 01:51:09.720
thing right now.

01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:14.620
And so it'll be really hard for Microsoft to fuck that up, but we'll see.

01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:15.660
All right.

01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:17.980
At least it's not Google buying them.

01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:20.340
Yeah, that's true.

01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:25.740
SG100Matt in chat says, we talked a sec ago about Nintendo not reading The Room.

01:51:25.740 --> 01:51:29.500
I think Microsoft is reading The Room and I feel like they will leave the gamer part

01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:32.700
of Discord alone and use it in other systems.

01:51:32.700 --> 01:51:33.700
Hmm.

01:51:33.700 --> 01:51:34.700
We'll see.

01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:37.700
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, at least it's not Facebook buying them.

01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:38.700
We can say that again.

01:51:38.700 --> 01:51:39.700
All right.

01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:40.700
Oh, yeah.

01:51:40.700 --> 01:51:41.700
I'll be horrible.

01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:42.700
All right.

01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:43.700
Let's move on.

01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:44.700
Loki.

01:51:44.700 --> 01:51:45.700
All right.

01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:50.460
Well, speaking of playing games with other people, Steam had this brand, this kind of

01:51:50.460 --> 01:51:55.860
hidden update that they did recently to their remote play together.

01:51:55.860 --> 01:52:01.940
So remote play together, if you may remember, was the way to basically invite a friend that

01:52:01.940 --> 01:52:07.100
may not own a game that you have on Steam to come play with you kind of like couch co-op

01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:08.100
type of thing.

01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:13.340
Well, now they've updated it to where now not only can you invite someone that doesn't

01:52:13.340 --> 01:52:17.920
have the game, but you can also invite someone that doesn't have Steam installed on their

01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:19.480
computer.

01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:24.560
So allows anybody to basically join you and play together remotely.

01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:26.940
Right now, there's about a thousand games supporting it.

01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:28.640
Not everything supports it.

01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:32.460
Only the games that do support remote play together.

01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:37.540
But like I said, there's over thousands of games already that support this.

01:52:37.540 --> 01:52:40.000
So that's pretty amazing.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.680
Pretty neat feature to see what's going on.

01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:42.680
And they have a Steam sale right now.

01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:45.740
So, you know, go check that out.

01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:50.480
It's really funny that this story follows the Discord thing after that scenario I just

01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:59.200
proposed, because now here is Steam kind of doing that, but not with a community focus.

01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:05.120
I mean, sure, there are communities on Steam, like VoG has a community on Steam, but are

01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:07.360
people really using them?

01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:11.160
PlayStation had communities built into it, but was anyone really using it?

01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:12.160
No.

01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:13.160
So they closed it.

01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:15.560
That's what's making Discord so appealing.

01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:20.080
It has built communities in a way that no other gaming platform has been able to, that's

01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:21.080
for sure.

01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:23.540
And thanks to the pandemic, it's gone way beyond gaming.

01:53:23.540 --> 01:53:27.660
Sorry, I don't mean to completely go revert to the last story, but it's interesting that

01:53:27.660 --> 01:53:31.580
there is that similarity here about the whole, well, Steam is now allowing this whole playing

01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:32.620
together thing.

01:53:32.620 --> 01:53:38.360
It's a bummer they don't have the real community behind it besides the friend list to really

01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:39.980
push this forward.

01:53:39.980 --> 01:53:40.980
Yeah.

01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:45.960
That's still pretty cool though, that they have that available.

01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:50.480
I don't know where I'd use that, but I have lots of games that probably support it.

01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:51.480
Yeah.

01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:56.320
So, yeah, pretty cool feature though, especially if your friends don't have Steam or maybe

01:53:56.320 --> 01:54:00.920
can't install Steam or whatever, a good way for them to look into that.

01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:02.040
All right.

01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:04.720
And I believe this is our last story that's slated for tonight.

01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:09.840
And this one's kind of, oh boy, Crash Bandicoot 4 just came out.

01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:15.700
And since it's an Activision game, they use the Battle.net app, which is part of Blizzard,

01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:20.500
which is now part of Activision, right, to get Crash Bandicoot 4 out there.

01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:27.380
But something they weren't very forward with, Crash Bandicoot 4 requires Always Online.

01:54:27.380 --> 01:54:30.180
Crash Bandicoot 4, by the way, is a single player game.

01:54:30.180 --> 01:54:33.500
And there is no multiplayer mode that I'm aware of in Crash Bandicoot 4.

01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:35.340
I don't think they added one in or anything like that.

01:54:35.340 --> 01:54:37.180
It is a single player game.

01:54:37.180 --> 01:54:42.720
But yet it requires an internet connection to play on PC, which most of the Battle.net

01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:46.720
games do to be fair, but also the Battle.net games are almost all online.

01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:49.920
I would expect I have to be online to play World of Warcraft.

01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:51.640
I would expect to play Starcraft.

01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:55.800
I probably need to be online, especially if I'm going to play with other people.

01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:57.300
And this goes a step further.

01:54:57.300 --> 01:54:59.240
Now people are getting error messages.

01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:03.000
So like Diablo's infamous Error 37, yep, this is happening to people that are playing

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.420
Crash Bandicoot 4.

01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:08.880
They can't log in to the single player game that they purchased because Battle.net's having

01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:09.880
issues.

01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:15.040
Authentication servers are being overloaded, and this makes the game unplayable.

01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:20.180
Now something else to say here.

01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:21.180
Why would they do this?

01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:23.240
Oh, well, to avoid piracy, right?

01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:27.380
They don't want people to pirate the game because then pirates wouldn't be able to get

01:55:27.380 --> 01:55:29.720
around this Always Online requirement.

01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:31.460
Guess what?

01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:34.960
Pirates have already gotten around this Always Online requirement.

01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:42.140
So now we have a case where the piracy version of the game is, in a way, superior to the

01:55:42.140 --> 01:55:48.200
actual version of the game because it'll actually connect.

01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:51.320
The retail version of the game won't let you play it right now.

01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:54.420
Well, sometimes won't let you play it.

01:55:54.420 --> 01:55:57.560
Right this minute, I'm sure it's fine, but there were certainly issues during this week.

01:55:57.560 --> 01:56:00.000
Pirated version didn't have that problem.

01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:01.060
Oops.

01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:07.500
What was Activision thinking giving a single player game Always Online DRM?

01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:09.500
Loki, any thoughts?

01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:11.940
They just don't care.

01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:14.300
They're just trying to make all the money that they can.

01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:15.620
I don't know.

01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:18.380
Maybe they had...

01:56:18.380 --> 01:56:23.720
I can't imagine there's that many people, like there'd be that much piracy with a Crash

01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:28.940
Bandicoot game like that, considering also this version just came out.

01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:34.720
I think the other versions have been out for a while now, so it's like, I don't know.

01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:38.400
It's silly, but now this just tarnishes their PC.

01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:42.280
This is embarrassing for a company that doesn't need any more embarrassment right now.

01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:43.280
Exactly.

01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:44.280
Well, it's not even so much...

01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:47.560
That has not exactly been on an uptick lately.

01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:52.000
And it's not even so much like that Crash Bandicoot 4 or anything.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:56.640
It's always going to be like, people are now going to second guess any Activision games

01:56:56.640 --> 01:56:57.640
that come to PC.

01:56:57.640 --> 01:56:58.640
Is this going to be Always Online?

01:56:59.340 --> 01:57:00.340
Especially Battle.net.

01:57:00.340 --> 01:57:01.340
Is this one going to be Always Online?

01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:05.940
You know, it's like, it's just, it's not good.

01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:08.000
But they don't care because they're going to make money.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:13.020
It is worth saying, Diablo 2 Resurrected is on many people's radar, right?

01:57:13.020 --> 01:57:15.660
Because that is something that Blizzard announced that got people excited.

01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:17.400
It will be on the Battle.net app.

01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:23.940
Blizzard did say that this Diablo 2 Resurrected is playable offline.

01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:28.340
It will not require the Always Online connection, which you may recall was a very controversial

01:57:28.340 --> 01:57:30.860
part of Diablo 3 when it first came out.

01:57:30.860 --> 01:57:31.860
But I digress.

01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:33.440
This Diablo 2 remaster.

01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:38.340
And the way Blizzards really explain this is that they really are putting an HD shell

01:57:38.340 --> 01:57:39.780
over their old games.

01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:42.480
So in a way, it kind of doesn't surprise me.

01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:48.160
But yeah, they have explicitly said, and maybe that's still the part of Blizzard that's cool

01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:52.820
versus the part of Activision that's never been cool.

01:57:52.820 --> 01:57:55.120
So maybe that's kind of that coming to head.

01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:56.120
I don't know.

01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:57.120
Maybe.

01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:01.320
FatNinjaDM in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says, that's the problem.

01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:03.040
They weren't thinking.

01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:06.300
Dart Satsuya says, does Battle.net have any other single player stuff?

01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:10.580
I mean, I can understand the DRM for the other multiplayer games, since you need net anyway,

01:58:10.580 --> 01:58:11.960
but that does seem a bit extreme.

01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:15.040
One could argue that Diablo 3 doesn't have to be online.

01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:19.280
You can play it single player mode.

01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:22.320
I guess the same would be true of Starcraft, quite frankly.

01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:28.360
Although certainly the Blizzard games are usually more inclined to be player versus

01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:30.080
online and all that.

01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:33.560
Their recent arcade collection, though, that just came out when they did their virtual

01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:36.160
BlizzCon, that shouldn't need to be online.

01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:38.160
I don't know if it is or not.

01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:40.240
I haven't looked.

01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:44.800
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, they might have tried to, but some extensive stat tracking

01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:50.240
in Crash 4 that requires a connection to the home server, which is a terrible idea.

01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:54.820
But I know a lot of games do keep track of how you play and phone home the anonymized

01:58:54.820 --> 01:58:58.440
stats of your PlayStation play session.

01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:03.140
So, all right, let's move on.

01:59:03.140 --> 01:59:04.220
That's it for stories.

01:59:04.220 --> 01:59:05.980
We're going to get to the listener roundtable.

01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:09.360
If you have some other comments or questions for us in chat, get them out there.

01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:12.020
Otherwise I'm going to go to the mailbag because I know we have at least one email tonight

01:59:12.020 --> 01:59:13.280
that I saw come through.

01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:15.080
Loki, I don't have the email up right now.

01:59:15.080 --> 01:59:17.640
So you have any last minute stories for us?

01:59:17.640 --> 01:59:26.880
I don't, unfortunately, you know, it wasn't a whole ton going on this week, but yeah,

01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:33.800
I'm just still waiting for more game announcements and the death of Mario next week.

01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:36.200
We do have a comment in our chat.

01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:42.320
We do have a comment in chat from IceP1 who says, looks like Eve Online will be allowing

01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:45.160
playing straight in the browser in the future.

01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:47.700
And so eveonline.com if you want more information.

01:59:47.700 --> 01:59:49.340
So there's no install needed.

01:59:49.340 --> 01:59:51.980
In other news, work productivity drops.

01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:56.020
And Bobby Blackwell cracks the joke about it's pretty easy to do spreadsheets in a browser

01:59:56.020 --> 02:00:00.040
because some people have called Eve Online like a spreadsheets game, although obviously

02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:02.140
there are more intricacies than that.

02:00:02.140 --> 02:00:06.360
But that's pretty cool about playing in a browser because, I mean, when you think about

02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:10.360
what was one of the big things that Google Stadia was pitching, you're going to be able

02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:12.640
to stream games from the cloud in the browser.

02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:16.240
So it's interesting that some games are kind of implementing this in their own way without

02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:18.080
needing a Google Stadia.

02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:21.840
Do you think we'll see more companies kind of do that, kind of just do their own cloud

02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:25.520
gaming thing because they don't really trust the other companies to do it?

02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:28.640
I don't know if it's necessarily they don't trust the other companies to do it because

02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:36.520
certain companies are locking down their app stores so that they have to create browser

02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:37.520
based applications.

02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:40.840
And I also want to be very clear, this Eve thing I don't think is actually a cloud thing.

02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:42.200
It's just playable in your browser.

02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:43.200
So I do want to be clear.

02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:48.700
Yeah, I mean, because they're kind of forced to do that, you know, to get around certain

02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:51.680
restrictions with Apple in their app store.

02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:55.280
So yeah, I could see him doing that.

02:00:55.280 --> 02:00:56.280
All right.

02:00:56.280 --> 02:00:57.320
I got our email up.

02:00:57.320 --> 02:00:59.600
So we do have one email tonight.

02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:03.400
If you want to send emails, participate at orangelawnsradio.com is the place to send

02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:04.400
emails.

02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:09.360
Tonight's email is Frodo Swagins, who writes, Hey, all super short email.

02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:11.040
I'm a podcast listener.

02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:13.440
The game It Takes Two just came out.

02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:14.440
OMG.

02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:15.440
It's super cute and fun.

02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:17.600
I've never seen a cooperative game like this before.

02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:18.920
I can't sit it down.

02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:21.120
I'm not going to review it here.

02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:22.120
You kind of did.

02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:23.120
But that's OK.

02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:25.400
I mean, you gave it a positive thing.

02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:26.400
That's all right.

02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:27.560
We appreciate the feedback.

02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:32.640
I'm not going to review it here, but I hope if you haven't already, grab a friend and

02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:33.640
try it out.

02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:34.640
I have to make sense.

02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:36.680
I haven't played It Takes Two.

02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:38.480
I've seen it because I think it's on Game Pass.

02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:40.240
Have you played this at all?

02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:41.440
I have not.

02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:42.440
Chat, help us out.

02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:45.440
Anybody playing It Takes Two like our emailer tonight?

02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:48.200
Curious what your thoughts are on It Takes Two.

02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:49.760
Maybe someone in chat has played.

02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:50.760
Thank you.

02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:51.760
You know what?

02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:52.760
You can host next week's show.

02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:53.760
How about that?

02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:54.760
All right.

02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:55.760
I'm just teasing.

02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:59.600
Also, I noticed you don't take live calls anymore in the green room.

02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:01.840
I've been meaning to ask how come.

02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:05.160
And that is from Frodo Swagins in Portland, Oregon.

02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:06.920
Well, hello, Portland.

02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:08.840
I haven't been in about 11 years now.

02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:11.760
I really need to get back to Portland.

02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:14.040
So why don't we take calls on Discord anymore?

02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:20.280
It's because of the remote broadcasting versus when we were all in the same studio.

02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:22.920
We're kind of not set up for it the same way.

02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:29.080
I probably could do some presto change-o and change some things and have the other person.

02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:32.720
But the thing we've noticed when we've done some guest appearances and things is that

02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:37.960
when we have more people on Discord, the frame lag starts to come in and the show starts

02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:40.280
to have some technical issues behind the scenes.

02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:45.080
So just basically long story short, technically, the bandwidth hasn't really worked out because

02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:49.440
we've been using all the Discord stuff so that we can tape remotely and still do our

02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:50.440
show.

02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:57.080
The good news is Loki's vaccinated, I'm vaccinated, Dark Sakura's vaccinated or getting there.

02:02:57.080 --> 02:02:58.080
We've started the...

02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:01.480
Well, Loki's closer than any of us having the one and done shot, but we're all in that

02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:02.740
process right now.

02:03:02.740 --> 02:03:08.300
So feasibly, in a few weeks, we can look at maybe returning to the studio if everybody

02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:09.660
feels comfortable with that.

02:03:09.660 --> 02:03:13.100
However, I do have the issue where somebody else who lives here has still not been able

02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:14.100
to get vaccinated.

02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:20.660
However, California said by April 15th, that will be a long issue.

02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:24.180
So my hope is, and I'm just gonna throw this out there, I've talked to Loki about it, I

02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:25.620
haven't talked to Dark Sakura about it.

02:03:25.620 --> 02:03:33.900
My hope is June, specifically June 23rd, and whatever Sunday is closest to that, I haven't

02:03:33.900 --> 02:03:38.620
looked at, that day, I think we may make a...

02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:42.740
That would be a great day for us to come back together.

02:03:42.740 --> 02:03:46.020
We will all be well fully vaccinated by that point.

02:03:46.020 --> 02:03:49.140
I think it will just be a matter of where is COVID at in the world.

02:03:49.140 --> 02:03:51.500
Technically we could probably actually do it before June.

02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:55.380
I'm just saying that's a very nice day, right, Loki?

02:03:55.380 --> 02:03:59.260
That would be a nice day to be back together again would be on our anniversary, right?

02:03:59.260 --> 02:04:00.660
We are starting over.

02:04:00.660 --> 02:04:02.260
I think would be a good little tagline for...

02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:03.260
Where have I heard that before?

02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:08.560
That would be a good little tagline for our show.

02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:11.620
That just depends on COVID and how all that's going.

02:04:11.620 --> 02:04:16.300
CDC has said vaccinated people can hang out together without masks.

02:04:16.300 --> 02:04:20.260
By that day in June, we will well be vaccinated without masks.

02:04:20.260 --> 02:04:29.820
I think the whole decision is COVID still threatening the variants and all of that,

02:04:29.820 --> 02:04:32.620
I think is the factor we still have to figure out.

02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:36.180
Bobby Blackwell says, the 23rd is a Wednesday, how convenient.

02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:41.700
So June 20th or 27th, fine, I will opt for the earlier day and do the 20th and say that

02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:47.260
right now on paper, that's the day I really want us to be able to come back into studio.

02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:48.260
Maybe sooner.

02:04:48.260 --> 02:04:53.540
We might just do May if things seem like it's gonna work that way.

02:04:53.540 --> 02:04:57.980
So anyway, I know that's kind of a long winded question that went a little tangentially for

02:04:57.980 --> 02:05:00.560
what you would really ask Frodo Swagons.

02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:04.900
But I guess my answer is it's not gonna be that way much longer, because I really want

02:05:04.900 --> 02:05:08.180
us to be back all in the same studio the way we used to do it.

02:05:08.180 --> 02:05:10.240
That would be great.

02:05:10.240 --> 02:05:12.380
And that's that.

02:05:12.380 --> 02:05:13.380
See other comments in chat.

02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:15.380
SG100 Matt says, maybe early summer.

02:05:15.380 --> 02:05:17.060
Yeah, who knows?

02:05:17.060 --> 02:05:19.540
I just like that June date because it's nice.

02:05:19.540 --> 02:05:24.740
But I suppose we could always do the end of May, which is technically when the live 365

02:05:24.740 --> 02:05:25.740
stations started.

02:05:25.740 --> 02:05:28.840
Because remember, we were running that station for about a month before we actually started

02:05:28.840 --> 02:05:29.840
our show.

02:05:29.840 --> 02:05:32.020
So I don't know, we'll see.

02:05:32.020 --> 02:05:36.260
Tiger class says tomorrow, they're going to allow people 40 years and older to be vaccinated.

02:05:36.260 --> 02:05:38.000
That just depends on where you live.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:41.220
So our show is based in California, Sacramento to be exact.

02:05:41.220 --> 02:05:44.520
I think you guys know that I've said that a lot of times on the show.

02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:49.840
And here in the state of California, 50 and over, we'll be able to be vaccinated on April

02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:51.200
1st.

02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:55.320
And then everybody else on April 15th.

02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:57.360
But again, the three hosts are already vaccinated.

02:05:57.360 --> 02:06:03.840
Alan is the only one who can't get his Kaiser appointment to get it done.

02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:06.600
The system won't let him do it yet.

02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:09.280
Bobby Blackwell says June 1st is Vogg's birthday.

02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:10.840
So yeah, there's other dates that make sense.

02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:17.360
So just so you know where my brain is at, I'm hoping in the next couple months, we finally

02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:18.360
are able to come together again.

02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:20.360
And I think that'll be a very nice thing.

02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:21.920
So we'll see.

02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:23.540
All right.

02:06:23.540 --> 02:06:25.040
And we didn't have any last minute stories, right?

02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:27.120
So I think we are towards the end of the show.

02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:32.680
One more shout out for the mailbag, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:06:32.680 --> 02:06:34.220
That brings us towards the end of the show.

02:06:34.220 --> 02:06:35.960
Thank you guys for listening to the show tonight.

02:06:35.960 --> 02:06:39.560
I know it was a little rough live with the technical hiccups, but you guys are awesome.

02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:40.600
You stuck with it anyway.

02:06:40.600 --> 02:06:42.160
Thank you so much for that.

02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:44.320
Podcast listeners, there may be a little delay.

02:06:44.320 --> 02:06:46.880
You might not get the show right at the same time you usually do.

02:06:46.880 --> 02:06:49.520
Just know it's because I had to kind of stitch some things together.

02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:52.140
Tonight's going to be a little bit of a Frankenstein episode.

02:06:52.140 --> 02:06:53.140
But these things happen.

02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:57.280
Thank you as well, podcast folks, for being here and being with us every week.

02:06:57.280 --> 02:06:58.280
We appreciate that.

02:06:58.280 --> 02:07:02.320
Emails, tweets at OLR, all the ways you want to interact with us.

02:07:02.320 --> 02:07:03.580
We really appreciate that.

02:07:03.580 --> 02:07:06.280
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lodge Radio, tell a friend or two about the

02:07:06.280 --> 02:07:07.280
show.

02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:09.600
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:12.840
But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, what else are we going to be able

02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:13.840
to do?

02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:15.360
So, yes, please, please help us spread the word.

02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:18.280
That would be very appreciated.

02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:19.600
What else was I going to say with all that?

02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:20.600
Discord.

02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:24.520
I guess I've plugged that a lot tonight, vognetwork.com slash discord.

02:07:24.520 --> 02:07:28.280
If you feel so generous and you want to buy some merchandise, we do have a shop available

02:07:28.280 --> 02:07:32.840
vognetwork.com slash shop if you are so inclined.

02:07:32.840 --> 02:07:34.480
With that, I think we can get to final thoughts.

02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:37.640
I think that's all the plugs I'm supposed to give at the end of the show.

02:07:37.640 --> 02:07:39.840
Thank you to Alan once again for filling in last minute.

02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:45.320
Thank you Chatroom for being patient tonight through all the Techhicups and always being

02:07:45.320 --> 02:07:46.920
a great support of the show.

02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:50.720
Loki, I will send it to you for your final thought.

02:07:50.720 --> 02:07:55.940
My final thought is I'm going to try to work more of my game.

02:07:55.940 --> 02:08:01.200
It's already almost to the point where I could probably put it out physically, but I just

02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:04.520
want to cram some more stuff in there.

02:08:04.520 --> 02:08:07.440
My final thought is I'm going to work on being a better killer.

02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:09.440
I sure am.

02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:11.340
In Dead by Daylight, of course.

02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:17.000
And I still have some additional things for VOG floating around in my head.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.880
And I hope I get my ass in gear to do that real soon.

02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:22.280
There's just a lot of other stuff going on personally, too.

02:08:22.280 --> 02:08:25.400
But things are looking bright over the next couple of months.

02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:26.400
Hang in there.

02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:29.440
We're almost to the end of this pandemic, but get your vacs when you can.

02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:30.440
Keep masking up.

02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:31.640
Stay safe.

02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:32.640
We're going to get there.

02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:33.640
Damn it.

02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:34.920
All right.

02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:35.920
Have a good night, everybody.

02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:36.920
We'll see you next week.

02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:07.880
See you next week.

02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:36.760
See you next time.
