1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,420
2013's Future of Entertainment is 2000 and dead!

2
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,980
And in a fun coincidence, when I was plugging my Xbox One back in recently, I accidentally

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,980
plugged the HDMI cable into the port that is meant for cable or satellite input rather

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,180
than TV output.

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,320
Imagine my amusement when I figured out and fixed that, the next thing I see is that that

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,520
port is no longer functional on my and all other pre-Xbox One S units.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,240
This is just one story, join your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers and Loki for more on

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,040

Day!

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:59,900
Hurray it's Pi Day, March the 14th of 2021 with episode number 860 of our show.

14
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:06,020
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to, first off, DarkSakura or Jamie

15
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,020
Sommers.

16
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,020
Greetings.

17
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,020
Hi, how are you doing?

18
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:17,340
Doing okay, I thought I had massively overslept and then I remembered the thing, so.

19
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,700
Oh yes, that little show that we have on Sundays.

20
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,700
No, no, no.

21
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,540
I thought that I forgot about Daylight Savings and so I thought I had overslept and then

22
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,500
I actually quite literally remembered it 10 minutes ago.

23
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,740
Oh my gosh, okay, yes, yes, Daylight Savings, yeah, that was the thing that happened yesterday

24
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,820
too, yeah, for sure.

25
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:43,340
Well happy Pi Day, have you been able to celebrate with any Pi despite your nap?

26
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,260
I have Pi waiting for me in the other room, husband went by Sherry's for me to get me

27
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,500
my favorite strawberry rhubarb pie.

28
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:58,660
Oh, yummy, look, I know I get labeled with the pumpkin thing a lot because, you know,

29
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,620
I do really like the pumpkin flavored things, so of course I like pumpkin pie, but when

30
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:09,100
it comes to pie, I like a lot of, like, I love lemon meringue pie, I like key lime pie,

31
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,020
I like apple pie, and I like strawberry rhubarb pie.

32
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,820
There's lots of pie, I can't really think of a bad pie come to think of it.

33
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,900
I'm not sure there's a pie I can think of that's really bad.

34
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:24,420
I'm sure somebody could invent one or something, and don't be like, oh, oh, the pie that, you

35
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,500
know, the lady baked poo into and all that doesn't count, you know what I mean, like

36
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,380
an actual pie, it's something I can order at Marine Calendars.

37
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,700
Yeah, there's something I can order at Marine Calendars, I don't think there's a pie on

38
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,380
that menu I dislike, so there's that.

39
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,380
Anyway.

40
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,380
I like meat pies.

41
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,340
Oh, like a savory pie, I guess.

42
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,340
Exactly.

43
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,540
Our favorite little restaurant does those.

44
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,540
They're pretty good.

45
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,540
Touch of Britain.

46
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,700
Oh, I wasn't thinking of Touch of Britain, I was thinking of Petey Kitchen.

47
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,340
Well, yeah, Petey Kitchen does those, but those are more like a hand pie, and I was

48
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:04,900
thinking of like, you know, like a steak and kidney pie or, you know, something like that.

49
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,780
I don't know if I'd eat a steak and kidney pie.

50
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,060
Well, there's different kinds.

51
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,100
I like a steak and kidney pie, I think they're delightful, but yeah.

52
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,060
Alright, well, heading over to Techmaster Loki.

53
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,060
Hey, Loki.

54
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,060
Hey.

55
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,900
Would you eat a steak and kidney pie?

56
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,900
Like kidney beans?

57
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,900
No, kidneys.

58
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,860
Kidney, kidney.

59
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,140
Probably more likely than if it was kidney beans, I really like beans.

60
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,140
Sounds a little more manageable.

61
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,940
It's really just a different texture of meat.

62
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,820
Have you had any pie today, Loki, to celebrate?

63
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,020
No, the closest I had was I went to Roundtable and got breadsticks, but they were doing a

64
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:52,780
special for Pi Day, so they have like pizza pie for like $3.14 or something.

65
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,780
Perfect.

66
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,780
But that's about it.

67
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,620
I have pie in Animal Crossing that has a pie on it.

68
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,420
Do they do a pie event in Animal Crossing?

69
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,260
Yeah, you can get the pie meal.

70
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,820
You should order, Rob, you need to look in tonight to get your pie before it's gone.

71
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,380
I should, you're right.

72
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,380
For pie.

73
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,380
And all the Super Mario stuff.

74
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,380
For pie, I will look in, I will go into Animal Crossing.

75
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,140
And the Super Mario stuff, Rob.

76
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,980
And the Sanrio stuff is going to be, I think, available to start using tomorrow.

77
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,980
That's really cool, too.

78
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,980
Yay.

79
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,980
Awesome.

80
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,900
Well, it gives me reasons to look at Animal Crossing, that's for sure.

81
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,220
So before we get into our kickoff topic, I've had an interesting weekend.

82
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,380
Let me tell you, I've had very high highs and I've had very low lows.

83
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,940
So yesterday I get an email asking if I want to get the COVID vaccine.

84
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,900
And I'm like, fuck yeah, I do.

85
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,300
Like, let's do it.

86
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,300
Let's get to it.

87
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,300
Where?

88
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,300
When?

89
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,300
Which brand?

90
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,300
I don't give a fuck.

91
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,300
Just give me the vaccine.

92
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,440
Let's let's get some sense of normalcy.

93
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,980
So I actually I went and I got that done today.

94
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,620
So I had my first shot today.

95
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,620
And I'm sure people are wondering, how did I get the vaccine here?

96
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,780
I do want to stress this question, especially as we move into that phase of a lot of people

97
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,780
are going to you're going to see start getting the shot because of prior existing medical

98
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,980
conditions and things like that.

99
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,420
I do want to stress that generally this question is none of your fucking business.

100
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,540
And I think that's important when it comes to social media, like how someone got the

101
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,540
vaccine.

102
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,700
Well, HIPAA is kind of overused, I think sometimes because HIPAA really only applies to insurers

103
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,700
and health care entities.

104
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,140
It doesn't apply to the press or people.

105
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:34,180
Except that the places that you're getting vaccinated can't ask you about how you qualify

106
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,180
due to HIPAA.

107
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,180
I believe.

108
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,180
Yeah, I think going to the pharmacies, they cannot ask you.

109
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,180
Right.

110
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,180
So.

111
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,780
So anyway, but I will happily talk about it because we've had this show on for so long.

112
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,660
Some of our listeners, not a lot, but some of our listeners may remember when this happened.

113
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,740
Do you all remember when I was hospitalized back in 2008 and I was out of the show for

114
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,980
I feel like I was out of the show for almost a month.

115
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,980
It was it was a little bit.

116
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,380
I was in the hospital for a couple of weeks.

117
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,700
Well, I was in the hospital for like four days.

118
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,340
And I remember you're eating nothing but bread, which I don't even think I was supposed to

119
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,340
be having.

120
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,900
But anyway, I ended up having my gallbladder out.

121
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,940
So long story short, I had a condition called pancreatitis.

122
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,180
That's what it put me in the hospital and it was caused by my gallbladder.

123
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,180
So that puts on my medical record that I've had a history of pancreatitis because they

124
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,900
never really know if it's going to come back.

125
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,140
Thankfully, knock on wood, it's never come back.

126
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,420
But my understanding from talking to some friends who are really into science is that

127
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,700
if you get covid and you have pancreatitis at the same time, guess what?

128
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,560
Your mortality rate shoots up to 15 percent.

129
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,300
So I'm pretty sure because that was in my medical record that I'd had that before.

130
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,020
That's why, as California is opening up to people with medical conditions, I was able

131
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,820
to get the vaccine.

132
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:55,220
So I went today and again, I would encourage if you're eligible for vaccine, get it no

133
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,940
matter which one it is.

134
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,380
I did get Moderna.

135
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,820
I would have happily taken any of them.

136
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,260
But something about getting the Dolly Parton vaccine does feel very correct.

137
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,300
And I'm totally good with that.

138
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,600
But obviously, whichever one they would have offered, I would have happily taken.

139
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,340
And so I'm sure people are wondering, how are you feeling?

140
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,340
I feel fine.

141
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,580
My arm is a little sore.

142
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,340
I would just compare it to a flu shot.

143
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,900
Right now, everything I'm feeling is very similar to the flu shot.

144
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,100
The arm is a little sore.

145
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:28,940
I feel like a little bit of like, but it's not enough to stop me from doing this show.

146
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,740
I don't know how the second dose is going to go.

147
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,460
I hear that's the one that'll really kick your butt.

148
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,200
But at the end of the day, it's better than actually getting covid.

149
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,140
So there is that.

150
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,420
Now, one other thing I want to say about my weekend.

151
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,340
So yes, the covid vax happened.

152
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,020
I'm thrilled about that, that, you know, I'm starting down that road and hopefully it's

153
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,500
more and more my friends get it.

154
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,940
You know, I'm sure dark soccer, Loki are going to end up getting it in hopefully a matter

155
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,940
of weeks.

156
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,940
Right.

157
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,220
The president said May 1st as a you can schedule your appointment at least by then.

158
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,260
So fingers crossed.

159
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,820
And based on what I saw today, how fast they were moving people through at the state fairgrounds

160
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,780
like I it could happen.

161
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,780
We'll see.

162
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,780
We'll see.

163
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,780
There's lots going to happen over the next few weeks.

164
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,260
But hopefully it puts us on a path back to normalcy where like maybe we can all be in

165
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,580
the same room again and do this show in person like we did for 18 years or however long it

166
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,980
was until this pandemic started.

167
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,020
Pretty much a year ago at this point is when the first will need to tell us.

168
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,020
Yeah.

169
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,020
Yeah.

170
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,160
I know we're going to go back to using our old mics after this one, we'll have to figure

171
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,160
all that out.

172
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,160
So.

173
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
So we'll see.

174
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,100
And I also want to acknowledge the chat room because I see they started another hype train

175
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,220
while I was talking about the vaccine.

176
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,500
So thank you guys very much for that.

177
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,180
Over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

178
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,380
You guys are very generous.

179
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,320
I'll read everybody out individually as I usually do at the end of the show after we're

180
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,620
done being live tonight.

181
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,220
But you know, when you guys when you guys really, really go as far as like to start

182
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,140
a train, I kind of have to acknowledge that.

183
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,620
But of course, yes, we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine

184
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:07,620
o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network right after the

185
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,220
Bobby Black Wolf show.

186
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,900
So my weekend I said it was interesting.

187
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:15,500
Yes, the covid vaccine part was interesting, but you know what else happened on Saturday?

188
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:21,280
So I was driving downtown because my plan was to play some Pokemon Go down at Capitol

189
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,780
Park or in that area because I still had a quest I needed to finish and Pokemon Go to

190
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,860
get like forty five steel types to finish that whole thing up.

191
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,780
Well, while I'm driving downtown and I'm going through the downtown streets, I got no car

192
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,780
accident.

193
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,780
Yep.

194
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,780
Somebody hit my car.

195
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,780
Yep.

196
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:43,420
It was I was in the far left lane and she was in the lane right next to me.

197
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,200
She thought I had to turn it was because, you know, how like downtown is full of one

198
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,660
way streets and, you know, weird.

199
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,000
So she thought it was one of those streets where I had to turn and she wanted to turn.

200
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,940
So she turned right into my car.

201
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,740
I'm fine.

202
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,440
You know, it was thankfully it was low speed.

203
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,000
It was coming out of a stop sign.

204
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,060
My car, my passenger side door, on the other hand, yikes.

205
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,260
So luckily, you know, it's a crappy situation.

206
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,180
But she and thankfully it was kind of one of those things.

207
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,920
She realized she was at fault.

208
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,940
She didn't try to play any funny games.

209
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,500
She was very apologetic.

210
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,340
You know, I'm sorry that this happened.

211
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,300
And, you know, and I'm sorry you are inconvenienced.

212
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,740
But since I was riding this high from I get to get the covid shot tomorrow, I was like,

213
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,740
it's all these things happen.

214
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,740
Don't worry about it.

215
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,060
You know, like I must you didn't get her insurance.

216
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,060
Oh, no, I did.

217
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,060
Oh, no.

218
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,060
We took care of all that.

219
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,060
Yeah.

220
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,060
No.

221
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,060
Her insurance people called me yesterday.

222
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,060
No, no, no.

223
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,140
I just mean like as she was stressing out, I was just like, you know, it's don't stress

224
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,140
out.

225
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,140
It's OK.

226
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,140
You know, I'm fine.

227
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,140
None of us are injured.

228
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,260
That's the important part.

229
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,860
You know, and I'm like, honestly, I was she probably was thinking like, who the fuck is

230
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,860
this guy?

231
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,300
Why is he so nice?

232
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,580
But it's because I got like the best news ever that morning.

233
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,380
It's like if I if you're going to choose a day to hit my car, that was the day to do

234
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,380
it, honestly.

235
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,760
But yes, no, we got it was all good.

236
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,320
Her insurance people called me last night and they were like, yep, we're going to accept

237
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,680
full liability on this.

238
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,400
And they set me up at the car place tomorrow.

239
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,560
It is an inconvenience.

240
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:17,280
I'm not happy about it, but something about the whole like covid situation, everything

241
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,480
I think puts a lot of things in perspective where I'm like, OK, she made a mistake and

242
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,020
she hit my car like shit happens.

243
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,700
And honest, honestly, with things like that, it's more like it's done.

244
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,700
What can you do?

245
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,420
Yeah, I think it's that, too.

246
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,300
It's like, am I going to scream at her?

247
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,860
What literally what will that accomplish?

248
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,460
What's that going to accomplish?

249
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:46,180
Like I see I see a girl who's freaked out because she knows she caused this situation.

250
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,300
And you know, you know, when you're the one that causes causes that you're running through

251
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,300
your head.

252
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,300
Oh, my God.

253
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,300
Is this going to be a neck injury thing?

254
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,020
Is this guy going to sue me for everything I have and all this stuff?

255
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,300
You can tell she's going through like all that stress.

256
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,060
Like I can tell just by looking at her.

257
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,220
So her insurance is about to suck.

258
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,140
Well, yeah, that part.

259
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,780
And you know, she had one of those cars with paper plates.

260
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,780
So I know it was probably a new to her car.

261
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:14,740
So that that sucks, like, you know, but again, like, what is it going to help if I'm just

262
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,860
like screaming at her going, how could you?

263
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,860
My day is ruined.

264
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,900
I am a I am an I'm an inconvenienced middle aged man.

265
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,820
Like it's just like what's well, what's funny?

266
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:31,720
I was reading a Vice article that's been making the rounds about how people are basically

267
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,520
just being assholes lately.

268
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
Oh, yeah.

269
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:41,320
But a lot of it is having to do to, you know, carrying the stress of the political situation,

270
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,440
the pandemic situation, all of this.

271
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,400
And we're just grumpy in general.

272
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:52,640
And the fact that you would turn it around and actually try to make somebody else.

273
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,760
I guess, center centered a little bit better, you know, that's a good thing.

274
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,400
We need more people showing just those little acts of kindness every day.

275
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
And I want to be clear.

276
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,440
I'm not telling this story to brag about what a good person I am, because I'm going to be

277
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440
completely honest.

278
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,440
Yeah.

279
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
No, no.

280
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,440
I'm going to be completely honest with you.

281
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,640
If I had not been if I had not been writing the high of the vaccine news, I don't think

282
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:21,640
I would have been rude, but I think there would have been a lot more of that.

283
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,680
You know, I think there would have been a lot more of that, right?

284
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,840
Like, I just don't think I probably wouldn't have been like I probably just would have

285
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,360
been a lot more like quiet.

286
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,180
I think is probably my more nature is just like, all right, what's your insurance mo?

287
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,520
You know, like that whole thing.

288
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,800
So yeah, I'm not telling that story.

289
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,760
If you see, you can all like, you know, gas me up and like, tell me what a great person

290
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,760
I am.

291
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
It's not about it.

292
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,480
But it definitely was something about the timing of everything like that, paired with

293
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,800
the great news of the vaccine stuff kind of just put a lot in perspective where it's like,

294
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,960
you know what?

295
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,680
I'm lucky to get this.

296
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,520
I'm unlucky to get this.

297
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,480
The universe works in weird ways.

298
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,680
Yeah, anyway, it is it is a podcast about video games, but I thought that was an interesting

299
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,840
life update y'all might enjoy.

300
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,100
And I did want to encourage you know what?

301
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,720
We have a platform.

302
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,320
It's a tiny platform.

303
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,080
It's like a little plank of wood that it's a it's a literal cardboard box that if somebody

304
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,360
too heavy stands on it, it will collapse.

305
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,660
But we do have a platform.

306
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,840
And if I can use this platform to encourage people, get the vaccine.

307
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
It's fine.

308
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
It's safe.

309
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,560
It's connected on lots of people.

310
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,320
There are lots of medical journals and medical science behind it.

311
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,760
So if you're like on the fence, like I'm not sure Bill Gates microchip, like, just please

312
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,600
do a little research into it.

313
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,160
And I think you're going to find it's it's fine.

314
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,160
It's fine.

315
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,320
Yes, there will be side effects, but they're they're 10 times better than actually getting

316
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
COVID.

317
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,320
I guarantee it.

318
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:58,480
Well, and now they're actually showing that people are getting long COVID in higher numbers,

319
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,240
which is basically you're over the virus, but you're left with the symptoms.

320
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
Right.

321
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,560
Well, Shane got into that a little bit last week.

322
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,200
You weren't you weren't here last week.

323
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
Was it last week or two?

324
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
I can't even.

325
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
It was last week.

326
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
What is time?

327
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
And he was talking a little bit.

328
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,680
We had him on at the beginning because I think there was Pokemon news or something.

329
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,880
I don't even know anymore.

330
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,880
What is time?

331
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,840
And but I know he was talking a little bit about that because he was wearing a mask on

332
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,640
stream even though he was in his house and it actually for him, it's helping with breathing

333
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
and all that.

334
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:32,000
So, you know, again, if you if you think COVID is fake, like I've literally had somebody

335
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,760
on this show to your way out of ever talking again, just or just like do a little research.

336
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,120
Go look somewhere.

337
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,880
It's not you're doing the research, Rob.

338
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,040
They saw it all on the Internet and it must be true.

339
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,760
Well, that's why I'm saying you need to do your research somewhere else, you know.

340
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
And anyway.

341
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,960
Well, even so, last week I was doing Gish.

342
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,960
So to.

343
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,960
All right.

344
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
Lizzo on the Grammys.

345
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
Bitch, I'm back.

346
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
Well, welcome back.

347
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Welcome.

348
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
I love her.

349
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
It didn't.

350
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,980
But the nice thing is because you had the classic game of the week, we didn't totally

351
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,980
miss you.

352
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,980
You know what I mean?

353
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,400
Like, we still got a little bit of Jamie's.

354
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,580
No, you know, we love you.

355
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,580
We do.

356
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,580
We do.

357
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,580
Yeah.

358
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,580
Some folks in chat talking about Zanderouz and chat over twitch dot TV slash Vogue Network

359
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,780
says most of us already have the microchip anyway.

360
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,780
You got to.

361
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,620
I think the microchip thing has become a bit of a meme.

362
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,220
But I know there are a few people that believe it, but it's crazy to me that they will post

363
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,340
to Facebook about it and tweet about it from their device that literally tracks their location

364
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:35,520
everywhere they go smart as I hold up my Apple Watch.

365
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,340
It's just it's just ridiculous.

366
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,340
All right.

367
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,180
Look, I promised gaming just because we're talking about microchips doesn't mean we're

368
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,580
in gaming news.

369
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,980
Let's actually talk about what's going on in gaming.

370
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,960
Loki, why don't you start us off with our kickoff topic tonight?

371
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:57,360
So Bethesda, of course, we know that they're purchasing or I'm sorry, Microsoft's purchasing

372
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,360
Bethesda.

373
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,280
I kind of was wondering where we were on that.

374
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:08,060
But apparently it was just down to the European Union's basically giving it the OK.

375
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:14,660
And now that that's been kind of allowed to happen, they've completed their purchase of

376
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,960
Bethesda.

377
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,220
So along with that, we had some more clarifications on things.

378
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:26,900
So, for example, as we kind of expected that some future Bethesda games will be exclusive

379
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,540
to Xbox and PC.

380
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:33,940
I mean, after all, you don't pay seven point five billion dollars to just have your games

381
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,940
everywhere.

382
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,540
But I mean, we'll see like what that means.

383
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:43,020
I think what they were talking about, though, it says with the addition of Bethesda teams,

384
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,220
gamers should know that Xbox consoles, PC and Game Pass will be the best place experience

385
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,780
to do Bethesda games.

386
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:55,220
Now, I'm wondering if they mean by games pass that they're looking to like, say, hey, look

387
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,060
at these games we have.

388
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,660
You know, you want to put them on your console.

389
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,140
Well, you can offer game pass kind of like how EA has EA play.

390
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,740
So that services on multiple consoles.

391
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,060
Why not game pass?

392
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,900
You know, so that may be something that they're trying to sweeten the pot there with that

393
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,940
to try to entice them to be able to bring it on.

394
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,900
But in the meantime, speaking of game pass, you know, if you are interested in playing

395
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,380
some Bethesda game, they added 20 more on there.

396
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,860
All all of your favorites are in there.

397
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:27,060
So well, Doom 2016 is missing, just to be clear.

398
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,420
So they're not not all there.

399
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,740
But yes, a good chunk made.

400
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,900
I don't want to poopoo the news because there are like I wasn't expecting Morrowind all

401
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,940
the way from classic Xbox to show up.

402
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,920
So there is some interesting picks that showed up in there.

403
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,920
Or Doom 64.

404
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,760
Who's really like dying to play Doom 64?

405
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,760
Fuck you.

406
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,760
I played it this week.

407
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,740
That was the first one I watched.

408
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,900
Why are you kidding?

409
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,440
Because because it actually looks pretty good.

410
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,360
Like it doesn't look like it because they up rezzed it or something.

411
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,540
They made the modern tweaks to it.

412
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,860
It looks good because you like I because of reasons.

413
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,900
I played it for like five minutes, you know, when I was in college or something and a friend

414
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,140
had Doom 64 and it was one of those I wanted to revisit it and see.

415
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,980
Like in my mind, I was like, was this like the original Doom?

416
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,980
Was it important?

417
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,020
And the nice thing about game pass, Loki, is that I can do that.

418
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,900
I can just like as long as, you know, I have the bandwidth or whatever.

419
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,180
But Doom 64 is a pretty small game.

420
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,620
So I just downloaded it just to be like, huh, I want to see I want to remember what this

421
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,620
is like.

422
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,180
I was and I, I played through the first level I and I enjoyed myself.

423
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,780
I didn't think it was terrible.

424
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,460
But you know, it's just it's in that same era of Doom one and Doom two.

425
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,580
And graphically, those games, you know, they're showing their age, but they're obviously there.

426
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,500
We wouldn't have the games we have today if it weren't for the legacy of those Doom games.

427
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,700
Anyway, sorry, I'm getting off track, but I had to justify to Loki why I was playing

428
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,700
Doom 64.

429
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,700
Fine.

430
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,700
I don't know.

431
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,780
I don't know.

432
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,620
Like it for me, it'd be like, hey, you like I know that Duke Nukem is not a Bethesda game,

433
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,780
but it'd be like, hey, you can play Duke Nukem 3D or you can play Duke Nukem 3D that appeared

434
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,660
on the Nintendo 64.

435
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,340
Not picking the Nintendo 64 version.

436
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,220
I'll take the original, please.

437
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:17,060
Well, remember the 60 Doom 64 has unique monsters, levels.

438
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,060
It's a different game.

439
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,620
It's not the same as when I guess I get that.

440
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,620
Yeah.

441
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,620
Yeah.

442
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,620
So I guess that makes sense.

443
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,620
And who cares?

444
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,620
It's free or free with your right.

445
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,620
Exactly.

446
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,540
It's quote free.

447
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,540
It's free like PlayStation Plus free games and all that.

448
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,540
Yeah, exactly.

449
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,540
Yeah.

450
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,540
All right.

451
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,540
So that's yeah.

452
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,860
It's kind of nice that we have the news that they have officially come together and how

453
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,500
fast that moved.

454
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,140
Like once that EU announcement came in, you know, we had the game pass additions within

455
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,860
probably 72 hours.

456
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,340
But I think it's also interesting that we had that.

457
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,260
I don't know what you'd call it, that interesting live stream.

458
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,820
I wouldn't call it a press event or what it was like a weird fireside chat where they

459
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,420
were talking about, you know, a lot of these things and talking about the exclusive, you

460
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:06,340
know, kind of confirming that there are going to be some games that will be exclusive to

461
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,800
Xbox and PC.

462
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,400
So what do you guys think about that exclusive side of things?

463
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,700
Do you think that is confirmation of sorts that things like Starfield and Elder Scrolls

464
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,700
6, like don't expect them on PlayStation or what do you think is going to happen with

465
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,700
that?

466
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,500
I think it's don't expect it on PlayStation immediately.

467
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,180
Okay.

468
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:34,400
I think that they're going to work out some bit of exclusivity because they can and then

469
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,940
open it up to everybody else because they're not going to say, oh, we don't want money.

470
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,940
Yeah.

471
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,940
You know?

472
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,940
Yeah.

473
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:47,620
And I could see and from my perspective, I could see Elder Scrolls 6 going to PlayStation.

474
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,980
I could see it.

475
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,860
But even if it does, it's not going to be the version that you want.

476
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,860
Like full stop.

477
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,780
Like the best version will be the Microsoft and Windows Store version or PC, whatever

478
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:04,260
trust that is going to be the version you want, even if it comes in less.

479
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,140
They somehow get it on the switch.

480
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,300
Maybe there's a switch pro or something and you must have handheld, but that's an exception.

481
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:16,700
I think for most people like the if Elder Scrolls 6 comes out on PlayStation, it's not

482
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,580
really going to matter for most people because the Xbox version will be the one you want.

483
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:26,260
I'm not so sure it's guaranteed something like Elder Scrolls 6 would come out on PlayStation.

484
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,260
I don't think anybody should really count on that.

485
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,500
I think you need to start setting yourself up mentally that you're going to have to get

486
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,420
an Xbox if you want to play Elder Scrolls 6.

487
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:39,300
I think Starfield absolutely is Xbox exclusive at this point.

488
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,700
I got nothing to go off of.

489
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,860
I got nothing but rumors and stuff and what they said during this event.

490
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,860
But I think something like that you better believe is going to be Xbox exclusive.

491
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:53,060
They had no reason to take that to PlayStation at this point.

492
00:22:53,060 --> 00:23:00,420
But I do think that all being said, I do think there's going to be room for certain Bethesda

493
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,060
things to still show up on Nintendo Switch, certainly, because they seem to have a pretty

494
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,380
good partnership.

495
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,420
And Microsoft never really seems threatened by Nintendo.

496
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:14,700
You know, they've done things like Ori and the Blind Forest and Will of the Wisps, Minecraft,

497
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,300
of course, although that's its own circumstance, right?

498
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,940
But we've seen interesting...

499
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,620
A Cuphead would be another one.

500
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,480
We've seen interesting little partnerships between Nintendo and Microsoft.

501
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,060
And I think that will still also hold true with Bethesda.

502
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:32,220
I'm not necessarily thinking the Elder Scrolls 6s of the world, but how about the Fallout

503
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:38,820
shelters of the world and little things like that, I think would still be very likely for

504
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,520
the Switch.

505
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,540
So I don't think everything is going to be.

506
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,940
Loki, what about you?

507
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,420
Where's your head at on the exclusives?

508
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,420
What do you think is going to happen?

509
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:53,060
I think we'll see how it goes with just having one console.

510
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:57,020
I mean, I think it depends on where they think they're going to make their money.

511
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:04,100
If it's going to be a game that is primarily single player and kind of an RPG like an Elder

512
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,980
Scrolls type game, then I think that they will keep it to the exclusive platforms.

513
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,820
If it's something more of a live service game where they feel that they're going to make

514
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:19,340
more money and reoccurring income from monthly subscriptions or microtransactions, then they're

515
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,780
going to want it on as many platforms as possible.

516
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:26,700
So I think it's just going to determine the type of games that they have and where they

517
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,420
feel that they're going to be best fitting.

518
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,560
Interesting conversation happening in chat.

519
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:37,100
And I think it might have started with this comment here where Phoenix7726 said, how long

520
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,140
before Sony or Nintendo take Ubisoft?

521
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:46,960
And then S2100matt followed that up with Sony would be smart to target Konami.

522
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,780
And there's some other follow ups to that.

523
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:53,260
And it's interesting, this conversation about Microsoft and Bethesda is sort of starting

524
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,340
this who's next type of trend.

525
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,300
Is Sony going to get Konami or something like that?

526
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,900
Now it's pointed out, I think Bobby Blackwell said, Konami is no longer a console video

527
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,860
game company and everyone's still in denial about it.

528
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,000
Very true.

529
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,480
But I think there's something to be said about, you know, the case set, you know, being pretty

530
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,320
much long gone.

531
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:20,320
And could maybe Konami's intellectual properties still be, you know, maybe if the whole company

532
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,000
isn't bought, could their intellectual property be bought for console usage?

533
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,400
And of course, I hate to bring it up because this rumor won't fucking die.

534
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,480
But there's the whole Sony and Konami are in cahoots on a new Silent Hill.

535
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,840
I give us a screenshot or something.

536
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,480
I don't know.

537
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,280
But I do like honestly, that would be a dream.

538
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:47,960
If Sony were to acquire things like Castlevania as an IP, Silent Hill as an IP, Suikoden as

539
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
an IP.

540
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,440
Can you can you imagine if Sony brought back Suikoden?

541
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,120
Like that's hot, like somebody needs to get all the Konami IPs and do something with them,

542
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,380
at least in the home entertainment.

543
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:05,220
What could also be very interesting, where would it if somebody were to buy and I realize

544
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,900
I'm going on a tangent, but forgive me, because our show is rooted in a lot of Konami's culture

545
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,260
when it comes to music games.

546
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,100
Could you imagine if a company acquired the ability to make Bimani game home versions

547
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,100
that would actually do something with it?

548
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:25,380
And like Sony could I see Sony as a company where if they actually acquired the ability

549
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:30,540
to make Bimani home games, they might actually fucking do something with it.

550
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,460
And it could be very exciting, actually.

551
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,500
But I realize things like Bimani get really weird because Konami still has an interest

552
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,940
in the arcade stuff.

553
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:44,000
Konami still has their stuff they're doing on the PC with, you know, they're they're

554
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,100
like pop music online and they're 2DX Infinitas and all that stuff.

555
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:53,420
So I think Bimani in particular is in a really weird gray area when we come to talk about

556
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,940
acquiring stuff.

557
00:26:54,940 --> 00:27:00,060
But I see these great IPs that are really going nowhere as of late.

558
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:05,040
And I would like Sony or somebody to buy them, quite frankly, at least the intellectual property.

559
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,940
But I get the contracts can be weird.

560
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:12,080
And Konami has not been a very well run company for quite a long time at this point.

561
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,620
So I'm not sure they're going to sell just because we want them to.

562
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,620
It's weird.

563
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,620
Yeah.

564
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:23,180
Konami also, they have to deal with probably a big difference in business model for Japanese

565
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:27,260
origin companies versus European.

566
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,260
It could be very true.

567
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:35,140
And also, I mean, different rules of acquisition for for, you know, Asian countries versus

568
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,220
European countries.

569
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:42,460
So it might not even be worth it, especially since they've especially for Konami since

570
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:49,060
they've become a little bit more niche with their bigger focus on the Pachi slot, you

571
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,060
know.

572
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,060
Yeah.

573
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,060
Or just slots in general.

574
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:56,600
And remember, walk into any casino and look at look at the look on the corner of the marquees

575
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,220
for the different slot machines.

576
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,940
About half of them are going to say Konami.

577
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,660
And they're not they're not things like Castlevania slots.

578
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:08,440
They're like, like, I don't think kitty glitter is by them, but I'm sure they have their own

579
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,220
type of kitten slot machine.

580
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:15,700
And there's I think that slot fortune cookie is Konami.

581
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,500
There's a lot of like, Konami has a lot of slot machines with things you wouldn't even

582
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,500
think were Konami.

583
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,940
Yeah.

584
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,940
Anyway.

585
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,940
Okay.

586
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,140
I completely took like the exit.

587
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:32,300
I'm like that meme of the car who's like, oh, L.R. staying focused on the news tangent.

588
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:38,940
And I just went down to let me go back to the news about Bethesda and Konami.

589
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,180
Let's talk about what this does for Game Pass, because I think I think another reason why

590
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:47,500
our chat room has this reaction of who's going to be next is because I think we're all looking

591
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,740
at this going.

592
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,020
Is anybody going to compete with Game Pass?

593
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:56,020
Because right now, it seems like nobody's trying.

594
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:00,300
Google Stadia sure didn't, because they went with a completely different model, right?

595
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,700
Like who is actually trying to compete with Game Pass?

596
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,300
I guess you could say EA Play, but look what happened there.

597
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,300
No, not even.

598
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:15,700
Well, EA Play, yeah, that's part of Game Pass now, but at least the trial version is.

599
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:20,700
I don't know if anybody's really doing, you know, like a competitor for Game Pass.

600
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,340
I could see Sony altering PlayStation now to try to make it like that.

601
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,220
I don't know if they have downloadable games yet.

602
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,820
That really is the thing that they need.

603
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,620
The streaming stuff.

604
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:37,740
It once again, it's a nice idea to have that you can stream any title, but the bandwidth,

605
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:43,660
man, it just in this day and age, that's not something that we need to be more manageable

606
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,980
and downloading something, it's going to be a lot more manageable that way.

607
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,620
And I do want to address some of the stuff in chat because they're echoing some of what

608
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,620
you're saying here.

609
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,220
SJ100Matt says Sony is trying, PlayStation Plus will get there.

610
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,420
Tiger Claw says Nintendo isn't even trying either.

611
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:01,060
I mean, I guess you could say technically they do have their, you know, classic game

612
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,820
library if you want to give them, you know, a point for that.

613
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:07,060
Have they added anything to that in like, ever?

614
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,700
I mean, like, I don't know.

615
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,740
Yeah, last month we had the news about like fire and ice.

616
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,260
I mean, we're getting, you know, I think all the Donkey Kong Country games have now

617
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,260
shown up now.

618
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,860
It's slim pickings, but they are adding to it.

619
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,700
I mean, technically, Logie, the answer to your question is yes, they are adding to it.

620
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,400
It's just not at the pace you or I or anybody else would really like now.

621
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
But here's the thing.

622
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,440
When you guys talk about the PlayStation, Nintendo, that's actually kind of my point

623
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,980
is that those what's happening here with Microsoft and Bethesda and this whole news and their

624
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:40,960
real like laser focus on Game Pass, they are fucking about to lap the other guys in how

625
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,040
far along they are in becoming the Netflix of gaming.

626
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:50,560
Now, of course, Netflix at one point had lapped everybody as well.

627
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,400
And then some of the big boys really did.

628
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,720
Then Disney Plus decided to show up.

629
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,760
Then they decided to put a really fucking good Marvel show on it and so on.

630
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,560
Like, you know, things like Disney Plus and even to some extent Paramount Plus, certainly

631
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,800
Hulu, are starting to catch up to Netflix.

632
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,800
Apple TV is doing it well too.

633
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
Oh, yes.

634
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,920
And of course, there's Apple TV and there's lots of stuff.

635
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:16,280
But my point is, how many years did Netflix go unchecked?

636
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:21,300
And that's what I see happening here with Game Pass and Microsoft is that they're just

637
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:26,400
able to etch out such a huge lead in this.

638
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,320
You know, I mean, it's it's interesting.

639
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,100
And you know, Bobby says Xbox is no longer in the console war.

640
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,880
They're in the ecosystem war.

641
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,840
Sony is still trying to win the console war.

642
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,280
And Microsoft doesn't really care about the console.

643
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,680
And I think this is a huge mistake on Sony's part.

644
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,160
I really do.

645
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,100
I think they need to get serious about responding to Game Pass if they want to have that longevity.

646
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:55,980
Because I think this news about Bethesda and everything with Game Pass, there isn't even

647
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,560
lines to read between.

648
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,880
Like in sometimes with these stories in the past, a year ago, I've had to say read between

649
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,900
the lines.

650
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,700
This is a Game Pass thing.

651
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,100
Why did Microsoft have that E3 where they announced that they were acquiring seven studios

652
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,580
that read between the lines?

653
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,580
It's a Game Pass thing.

654
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,740
You don't even have to read between the lines anymore.

655
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:19,100
They said it's a Game Pass thing.

656
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,000
So you can tell where Microsoft's interests are.

657
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,420
It was not about bringing the games to Xbox Series X.

658
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,140
It was not about bringing the games to Xbox One.

659
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,120
It was about bringing the games to Game Pass.

660
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,540
So did I just set off my phone?

661
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,420
I think I did.

662
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,420
Leave me alone.

663
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,420
All right.

664
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,780
I think it was my watch, actually.

665
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,780
All right.

666
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:45,780
Anyway, any other thoughts on the Bethesda Xbox thing?

667
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,780
All right.

668
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,780
Not really.

669
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,780
All right.

670
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:53,140
Then let's move on and we'll talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games

671
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,920
that we have been playing this week.

672
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,780
So Dark Soccer, let's start with you.

673
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,780
How was your gaming week?

674
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,620
Animal Crossing.

675
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,620
It's a good choice.

676
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,620
And Wordscape.

677
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:09,020
Wordscape is like how I wake up my brain in the morning and now I'm actually timing myself

678
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:16,040
to see how quickly I can finish an entire series, like the 16 puzzles.

679
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,380
And so far, my fastest has been within like four and a half minutes.

680
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,380
Wow.

681
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,060
So now that I'm bored with that, now I'm actually seeing how many different words I can figure

682
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,060
out.

683
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:29,940
And right now, my max is 16 extra words.

684
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,300
Nice.

685
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:36,940
So it's really just been that and not that it's a game, but it's kind of a contest because

686
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,240
it had achievements.

687
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,540
I like Duolingo.

688
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,340
I'm relearning Japanese.

689
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:48,600
And I had a challenge to be number one in the Diamond League, which is like the top

690
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,300
league and number one's pretty hard to get.

691
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,500
You got to stay on top of it.

692
00:33:53,500 --> 00:34:01,100
And I think I earned something like 900 XP doing this, but I made number one in Diamond

693
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,780
League.

694
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:07,660
So now I can go back to half-assing it.

695
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:16,380
So that's really all, although I'm pretty much considering making myself a Japanese

696
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:22,880
account to play Animal Crossing so that I can maybe use that again to sort of teach

697
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,880
myself.

698
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,580
Oh, that's a cute idea.

699
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:39,380
I was doing that with the original, not the N64 one, but the GameCube double tsunami plus.

700
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,580
And it was pretty difficult at the time.

701
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:46,360
Now I think I read a lot better, so I might have an easier time of it, but we'll see.

702
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:51,620
It's interesting because Shane has talked to me about how he plays Final Fantasy XIV

703
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,920
in Japanese because he's also studying Japanese right now.

704
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,120
And so that is something to kind of help him learn.

705
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,780
So that's a very interesting like trick or technique, I guess, to helping immerse yourself

706
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,820
in a language is take one of your favorite video games, you know, and play it again,

707
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:10,740
but in Japanese or continue to play it in Japanese is a little way to kind of practice.

708
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,740
It's interesting.

709
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:20,140
And I did order some stickers, but they never arrived, but I got the idea from when Extrofer

710
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,620
was learning Russian.

711
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,840
Oh, and he had all those postcards all over the house?

712
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,840
Exactly.

713
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:31,640
So I was ordering stickers to put on things, and I might just have to make my own, like

714
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,460
get some like Avery labels or something, which shouldn't be too difficult to do.

715
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:42,540
But I also have another thing coming on tomorrow should be here.

716
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,540
And that's Mac Mini.

717
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,540
Oh, yeah.

718
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:53,300
I'm getting the Mac Mini M1, mostly for, you know, using Final Cut and Logic.

719
00:35:53,300 --> 00:36:01,320
But I'm looking forward to seeing what I've been hearing about how well it plays some

720
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,840
of the games, because it's supposed to have just like this kickass graphics acceleration.

721
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:13,100
So and I have a bunch of games in my Steam that are Mac compatible, and I have a few

722
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,360
others that I had, you know, from the App Store, like, you know, Borderlands.

723
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:23,960
So I'm going to try to get my streaming setup done and do a little bit of Mac streaming.

724
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,960
So I see.

725
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,960
All right.

726
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,960
Excellent.

727
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,020
I'm looking forward to reporting on it, but that's why I brought it up, because it will

728
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,320
I'll be gaming on it.

729
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,520
Although I hate that I'd have to buy Final Fantasy 14 completely over if I wanted to

730
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,520
play it.

731
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,520
Oh, yeah.

732
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,520
Kind of lame.

733
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,520
At least I have my account.

734
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,520
We'll see.

735
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,220
Does any of the arcade stuff extend to Mac Mini or is that only?

736
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,220
Yes, it does.

737
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,220
Oh, cool.

738
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,020
You should check out that Fantasian.

739
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,500
I really want to see more about that.

740
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,500
I'll look into it.

741
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:57,320
I mean, I like I, you know, when I sold my iMac, I'm actually probably selling my MacBook

742
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,460
Pro because I use my iPad all the time.

743
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:07,940
But I was, you know, playing patterned because, you know, I love patterned and I actually

744
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,500
fully beat everything out on patterned right now.

745
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:17,060
But I would play patterned on my iPad and on a Mac.

746
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,480
So arcade goes through.

747
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,480
Cool.

748
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
Play what?

749
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,480
The golf every so often.

750
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,480
Good to know.

751
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,480
Yeah.

752
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,480
All right.

753
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,480
Well, let's check it.

754
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,920
Actually, a quick listener comment on the last segment before I go to Loki's gaming

755
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,920
week.

756
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,440
Bonds 006 in chat over twitch.tv slash vog network said Microsoft all you can eat model

757
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,340
is great for those that want it.

758
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:42,120
Bad times ahead winner if paywall for games become the only way to play games.

759
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,120
I don't think it will.

760
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,180
I mean, you're always going to have to pay for well, not true, I guess, because there

761
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:51,160
are things like Fortnite and the free to play model will always exist.

762
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,680
But that also is going to exist out of any of those ecosystems.

763
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,200
But you know, even if you drop $60 or some $70, I guess for a new game, that is a paywall

764
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,200
of sorts.

765
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,440
But I think I do see your point that like, you know, what if I want to just own this

766
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,440
game?

767
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,380
What if I want the streaming service to play this game?

768
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:13,300
I don't see that going away, especially with how integrated the digital storefronts are.

769
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,860
I think there's always going to be ways to buy a game that you really want without needing

770
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:22,940
any of these, you know, game pass or any of these service PS now, whatever you don't need

771
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,940
any of it.

772
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:28,620
Again, I always kind of look at this comparison to the movie industry.

773
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:32,140
And I think, you know, you obviously a lot of Hollywood has gone to streaming services.

774
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,460
But you know what?

775
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,460
You can still get Blu rays.

776
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,600
You can probably even still get DVDs.

777
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,680
It's not quite as plentiful as it was pre Netflix, but it's out there.

778
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,100
And hell online, you can get almost anything.

779
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,640
So there's a movie you really want and you don't, you know, because movies come and go

780
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,560
from the different streaming services too, which is really irritating.

781
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:57,480
So like my favorite movie, Clue, I know it's on Pluto TV, and I think it's on the new Paramount

782
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,480
Plus.

783
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,480
But you know what?

784
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,100
I own it on Blu ray just because I want to own it.

785
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,120
And I don't want to have to chase it around different streaming services.

786
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,080
And so I think there's I think that would be the case for games as well.

787
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,960
I don't I don't see that for a few movies.

788
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,760
Yeah, especially when it comes to Nintendo, if Nintendo is still going to always remain

789
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,880
a portable system.

790
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,160
We're not at the level yet.

791
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:24,280
And certainly Nintendo is not at the level yet where like, they're going to stream 5G

792
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:30,080
games to the switch, maybe 10, 15 years, we might have a different conversation on that.

793
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,860
This show will probably still be going.

794
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:38,300
But right now, no, I there were a long, long way out from that, for sure.

795
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,300
Anyway.

796
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,300
Okay, I just want to comment on that.

797
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,500
I did think it was a good comment.

798
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,300
But I think if you again, you look to Hollywood, I think you see a lot of where games is going

799
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,940
games is just lagging 510 years behind.

800
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,940
All right.

801
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,700
Loki, how was your gaming week?

802
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,940
I didn't play a ton.

803
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,020
I did play a lot of Minecraft.

804
00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:01,080
And then of course, I had picked up a what's it called?

805
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:09,080
It's a ABS retro HD I think systems a while back, it's basically like an HD Nintendo and

806
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,460
Famicom.

807
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:14,440
And so I've been just picking up a few Nintendo games here and there.

808
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,640
So I got this week as a blaster master bionic commando, and of course, the guardian legend

809
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,760
and then also rampage because it came with the guardian legend.

810
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,720
Did you go to the retro store downtown or the one in Fair Oaks?

811
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,720
The one in Fair Oaks.

812
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,720
Okay.

813
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,720
Because I didn't want to go all the way downtown.

814
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,720
That's a cool place too.

815
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,720
Like I'm not going to.

816
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,720
We may as well give Fair Game a shout out.

817
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,380
They're a local business and they're pretty fair.

818
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,380
Yeah.

819
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,380
Yeah.

820
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,380
The prices were definitely good.

821
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:44,620
I could have bought a whole lot more and I sought myself, but they have a lot of stuff

822
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,620
there.

823
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:49,640
They even carry some homebrew NES games and reprints.

824
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:56,360
So like I didn't realize, but they have a NES multi-cart for a bunch of data East games.

825
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,760
That's actually officially endorsed by data East and stuff.

826
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,040
So I thought that was kind of interesting.

827
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,040
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

828
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,640
Does this mean you might sell your game at retail?

829
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,680
It would be cool if I could.

830
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:11,280
I didn't ask him, but like I saw that they had, um, they had, what was it?

831
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,160
It's um, I think it's like hollow Halloween or something like that.

832
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:22,600
Um, 85, there's some, some Halloween game, um, that they have, that's, uh, pretty well

833
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:27,000
known and they have the box copy of it there for like 60 bucks.

834
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,320
So a haunted Halloween 85, that's what it was.

835
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:38,640
And um, so I saw that I was actually looking to see if they had any like other, you know,

836
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,000
indie games there.

837
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,480
Um, I think there's a few things, but like a lot, not so much on the NES and like some

838
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,880
of the other stuff I was looking for, they didn't really have, but I mean, it's certainly

839
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:56,680
well organized compared to, I like the previous week I had gone to the local flea market here

840
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:03,280
and there's a guy that has a retro game store with games that are in far less good shape

841
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,520
and it's just, there's no organization to it at all.

842
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:11,500
It's like a bunch of NES carts and good luck, find what you're looking for because none

843
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,500
of it's organized in.

844
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,500
It's just a big pile mess.

845
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,740
Not Crater Dan back, is it?

846
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:21,760
It's uh, retro, it's like Dave's, it's, it's on the, he's, he's talking about the Folsom

847
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,760
Boulevard one, not Denios.

848
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,160
Oh, I don't think I've been there.

849
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,160
Yeah.

850
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,880
So his store is a bit, uh, trap, I mean, it, it represents the, the flea market as a whole.

851
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,960
I mean, the whole flea market's kind of a dump, but that whole thing, not to like give

852
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,600
away my address, but that whole thing is within like maybe two miles of my house and I'll

853
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,080
still take the 20 minute drive to go to Denios.

854
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:51,880
I would have, I should have gone to Denios, but like, I just wanted to real quickly check

855
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,880
it out.

856
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,280
Cause I saw when I was looking for like NES games on, um, not like the Facebook marketplace

857
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:03,800
and like on Craigslist or something like that, I saw an ad for it and it looked, you know,

858
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,800
better.

859
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,400
They also have like amiibos and stuff like that.

860
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,920
Um, so I wanted to go in there and see what they had, but Oh my God, it was a mess.

861
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:15,040
Like I could, I could literally not find anything that I was looking for in there.

862
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,400
Like I could have asked them, they would have been like, I don't know.

863
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:22,240
And the way they have their counter set up, like if there's stuff on the counter and like

864
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,600
the way the games are stacked up in there, you can't even see what's in there.

865
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,800
It's just, it's a mess.

866
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,760
And just looking at the labels, uh, from where they had it on there, it just looked trash.

867
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,720
Just like dumpster diving for $5 DVDs at Walmart, right?

868
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,720
Yeah.

869
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,840
Pretty much like, except if the DVDs were like scraped off of the street, you know,

870
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:44,280
because they'd been thrown away before, um, whereas at least the stuff that was at fair

871
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,560
game, if the pricing wasn't bad, it was like 10 bucks a game.

872
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,160
And depending on what you're looking for, obviously like Zelda was like 30 or $40.

873
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,680
I'm like, I don't really want for that much.

874
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,320
Um, but yeah, it's just, it's so much better.

875
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,360
Just not a nightmare to find stuff.

876
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:07,400
Um, so yeah, eventually I'll go back out to the, it's been a while since I've been out

877
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,280
there, but like, I just want to do like a really quick trip to see what they had and

878
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,280
that was it.

879
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,640
So, um, you know, I'll probably go back to fair game at some point, you know, I don't

880
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,740
want to get a huge collection of stuff cause I don't have any place to put it.

881
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:22,740
So I don't know.

882
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,740
We'll see.

883
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,740
All right.

884
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,160
Um, well I'll talk about my gaming week.

885
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,200
So as I mentioned earlier, when Loki was talking about Bethesda, I did play doom 64

886
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,320
this week a little bit.

887
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,320
That's fun.

888
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:36,280
Um, and also I used the whole, uh, game pass expansion, Bethesda.

889
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:41,640
I picked up elder scrolls, oblivion, the Xbox three 61, because I was like, I just want

890
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,640
to check it out.

891
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:49,280
And I have to say, holy shit, the loading times are crazy good because of the whole

892
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,540
fact like series X, you know, is on the, the, um, solid state drive and all that stuff and

893
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,040
boast the faster loading times.

894
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:00,280
I gotta say now that I'm playing oblivion, uh, it's, you notice it and it looks really

895
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,280
sharp.

896
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,760
You know, it's, it's still a years old game at this point from what, like 2006.

897
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,880
But um, it's, it holds up pretty well thanks to, I'm not sure how many of those enhancements

898
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,520
like the HDR and the frame skip stuff or the frame speed up stuff they've actually put

899
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,840
into this yet.

900
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,760
I think some of that is still coming.

901
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,560
Um, but it looks good.

902
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,520
Um, and so I enjoyed it well enough.

903
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,880
You know, I'm not going to spend a lot of time on it, but, uh, I had a good time.

904
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,440
It's kind of like going down memory lane, I guess.

905
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,540
So, um, so I played a little bit of that.

906
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:35,800
I'm still playing dead by daylight, thanks to husband and his streams.

907
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:40,700
Um, I actually finally got to the point I spent money on it.

908
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:45,140
I bought a new killer because I had to be able to play the game as pyramid head.

909
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:49,760
So I bought pyramid head and day by daylight and I gotta say he's fucking fun.

910
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,280
He's really fun to play.

911
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,040
And you know, it's funny cause everybody tells me pyramid heads a little more advanced.

912
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,360
I don't know if you want to, you know, even Alan is kind of like, he's a little bit harder

913
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,360
to play.

914
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,360
I don't know.

915
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,880
And I'm like, I want to play this game as pyramid head.

916
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,560
I will learn.

917
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:10,100
And so it's pretty cool cause he digs trenches that, um, the survivors, if they touch them,

918
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,440
they become tormented.

919
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,440
And this is really cool.

920
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,000
If they're tormented, then when you down them, instead of putting them on a hook, you can

921
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,600
send them to a cage.

922
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,120
So they go to a, like a barbed wire cage type of thing they have to escape from.

923
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,600
And so that feels really good.

924
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,880
Um, so I've, I've caged a few survivors and that's a lot of fun.

925
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,420
So pyramid head is, is now my main in dead by daylight, at least for now until I get

926
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,920
suckered into, uh, buying another killer.

927
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:33,920
We'll see.

928
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,440
But that's all, again, that's all thanks to Alan.

929
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,500
I would, I wouldn't have given that game really another look, but he really did some streaming.

930
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,500
I'll give him a cheap plug.

931
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,960
Twitch TV slash Alan alchemy.

932
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,760
I think he's streaming after tonight.

933
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,380
So well are, I think he wanted to do that.

934
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,800
So you might actually get to see him if you hang out until the end of the show.

935
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,560
Um, but, um, he was really good at explaining all the mechanics.

936
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,560
And I will say this.

937
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:59,920
I played my first survivor game in dead by daylight, which I, you know, was kind of like

938
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,800
on the fence, like, uh, but having played enough, I was like, all right, I should get

939
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,240
in there and played survivor.

940
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,960
I did not enjoy playing survivor.

941
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,160
It was too stressful.

942
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,080
I hate that heartbeat shit.

943
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,320
Like when the killer's getting closer, the heartbeat gets into, and so my own heartbeat

944
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,120
is like, what the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck?

945
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,960
And then like, I was just playing like a dummy.

946
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,320
Like I thought I was running away from the killer and the killer literally cornered me.

947
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:25,280
So because a lot of people that play that game are kind of dicks, like the killer is

948
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,760
like standing there right in front of me blocking.

949
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,000
So I can't go anywhere.

950
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,080
And so of course he starts doing the whole nanny, nanny, nanny, teabag TV, nanny, nanny,

951
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,060
nanny, like, ah, you can't do anything.

952
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,060
And then kills me.

953
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,560
I'm like, you fucking dick.

954
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,360
So I did not enjoy survivor experience.

955
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,960
I don't think I'm going to do that again.

956
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,480
Like, ah, I am a murderer at heart.

957
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,360
That is, that is how I'm going to stick to it.

958
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,680
All right.

959
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:57,280
Um, I'm looking in chat, SSJ100Matt says, so Rob and Alan co-stream when?

960
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,320
Okay.

961
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,320
Do not quote me on this.

962
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,800
Do not like write.

963
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,320
This is not science seal delivered.

964
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,340
However, we are talking about.

965
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:09,560
So I mentioned after Bobby does his, um, reward stream here at VOG network, he's going to

966
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,280
do the VHS tapes, memory lane stream.

967
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,280
You already got the points raised for that.

968
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,300
That is going to happen in the next couple of weeks.

969
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:21,200
So once that's done, we already talked about the next stream is going to be, um, the Shane's

970
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,840
definitive Pokemon rankings.

971
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,960
We talked about that last week.

972
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,800
So Shane is going to get out of spreadsheets, walk you through his spreadsheets of how he

973
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,140
ranks Pokemon.

974
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,580
And I think we said we were going to do the top 50 Poke.

975
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:34,740
If we do all 800, it's going to be a 48 hour stream.

976
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:37,400
So I think we said, we're going to do like the top 50 Pokemon is going to do his definitive

977
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,400
ranking.

978
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:44,860
The next stream after that, I am looking at doing a Rob Roberts, murders, his husband

979
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:48,660
stream, um, in dead by daylight.

980
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:53,020
So it'll be Rob Roberts murders, his husband in dead by daylight, but we're going to need

981
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:57,980
to find three other survivors who Rob Roberts will also be murdering.

982
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:03,660
Um, and if you're playing in that, if that's okay, if you're new to dead by daylight, that's,

983
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:04,660
it can be listeners.

984
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,380
It could be other friends of the show, whatever.

985
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:10,560
If you're new to dead by daylight, that's okay because Alan will be coaching the team

986
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,880
of survivors.

987
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,840
So it will be a, and I fucking suck as a killer.

988
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:20,420
So like, you know, if you're going to want to learn, this will be the stream to do it.

989
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,720
I have to confirm and make sure Alan's all good with that.

990
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:27,020
That is what we're looking at for the third bonus stream that will come a little later

991
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,020
on.

992
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,800
So, all right.

993
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:37,300
Speaking in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, uh, sweet Nick, sweet Nika.

994
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,300
I hope I said that right.

995
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,300
I'm sorry.

996
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:40,300
Nika.

997
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,300
Sorry about that.

998
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:45,160
Uh, says I play survivor more than killer, but being killer is a great stress relief

999
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,160
at dead by daylight.

1000
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,160
LOL.

1001
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:51,260
Um, I am taking comfort in the fact that Alan is a pretty good survivor, but when he plays

1002
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,320
killer, he's about as good as I am.

1003
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,880
So I don't feel like I'm lagging behind or anything like that, which is nice.

1004
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,360
Um, as soon under Matt says, got to have Shane's not top 10 Pokemon though.

1005
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,360
Ha ha ha.

1006
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:05,800
Uh, and DJ Romas says we need a Rob Roberts presents among us.

1007
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,800
Yeah.

1008
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,240
I know that's still a desire to, that may end up being the third thing.

1009
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,800
So that's why I said, don't quote me on it, but we'll, uh, we'll, we'll get on that.

1010
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,800
So, okay.

1011
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,640
So see dark soccer, you don't have to worry pixel Pacas already volunteering to get murdered

1012
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,640
by me.

1013
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,640
So there we go.

1014
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,440
We're we'll get, we'll get Alan's team together in no time.

1015
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,440
All right.

1016
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,440
All right.

1017
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,760
Uh, what else do I want to say about my gaming week?

1018
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,280
Oh, I still have one more.

1019
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,200
I bought bravely default two, uh, on Nintendo switch and, uh, I haven't played a lot of

1020
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,200
it yet.

1021
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:40,160
I've only gone through, uh, that like very first boss fight where the team is still teaching

1022
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,520
you about boss fights.

1023
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:47,960
So I, I'm, I'm still very early into the game, but so far I am enjoying the actual game itself.

1024
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,960
The whole like job leveling, the, the battle system is very interesting where the whole

1025
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,200
like you kind of like stock up your turns, or if you're feeling very cocky or confident

1026
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,140
that you can finish the battle and in four turns, you just spend all your points and

1027
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,840
try to knock everything out.

1028
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,960
Um, there is a Bobby black Wolf mode.

1029
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,000
You can play on easy, uh, but I am playing on normal.

1030
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,940
Um, so I am enjoying it and, um, the story, you know, it's still early on, but it seems

1031
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:15,520
like it could go, the voice acting gets a little old, but I skipped most of it.

1032
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,520
Um, but the story so far seems like it could be interesting, very, very old school final

1033
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,120
fantasy so far anyway, again, I'm very early on in it.

1034
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:28,360
The one thing I am going to haze the game for a little bit though, um, it doesn't run

1035
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,360
great.

1036
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:33,940
Um, and that is kind of shocking for a game that's exclusive to switch to see things like

1037
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:41,400
frame skips and hiccups and like stuff that really shows how the switch is lagging behind

1038
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,640
other systems.

1039
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:48,720
Now maybe this is all when the switch pro comes out, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, bravely

1040
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,120
default two will run like butter on it, but I can't, I can't evaluate a system that ain't

1041
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:56,640
out or even announced yet as it is today.

1042
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,040
It's a little disappointing how kind of clunky it feels.

1043
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:06,820
Um, and uh, I gotta say, I think bravely default is really a game that's meant to be played

1044
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:08,720
in portable mode.

1045
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:15,040
I play it on the TV and when I do play it on the TV, I can see a lot of pixelization

1046
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:21,800
and like things that aren't very appealing when I'm in things like towns and stuff.

1047
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:26,400
And I'm not sure if that's supposed to be kind of intentionally the art style, um, which

1048
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,160
some of the fans may try to say, and that's fine, everybody can have their own opinion.

1049
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,600
I say it doesn't work.

1050
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,700
Um, and it, it looks, it looks old.

1051
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,280
It looks, uh, yeah.

1052
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:42,880
So some of those things are kind of annoying, um, but the game itself, the game mechanics

1053
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,960
and that whole thing are kind of strong enough for me to overlook that other stuff.

1054
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:53,080
I just hope there is a switch pro in the future that will not cause the game to like, you

1055
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:57,720
know, like literally stutter as I'm out in the overworld.

1056
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:01,400
It's it's kind of depressing that the game does that, honestly.

1057
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,400
All right.

1058
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,280
Um, let's move on.

1059
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,280
That's it for my gaming week.

1060
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,560
So I think that's all I have to say.

1061
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,940
Uh, I guess we'll get into some news, shall we?

1062
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:11,600
So Loki, why don't you start us off?

1063
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,640
All right.

1064
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:20,880
So, uh, you know, stonks, um, Roblox, the Roblox thing or Roblox corporation, I should

1065
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,320
say, uh, went public this week.

1066
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:32,120
I believe that was on the 10th and they had originally set out that their stock price

1067
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:38,160
was around, I think they were estimating $45 was originally what it was, uh, set the trade

1068
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,560
at, but then actually ended up trading around $70 at the end of the day.

1069
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:46,460
Um, so right now, though, they've, uh, raised quite a bit of money.

1070
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:55,440
So it's, you know, basically a valuation of about $45 billion, uh, which is huge because

1071
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,960
when you compare that to other companies like EA, for example, which is 37 billion or take

1072
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:08,260
two, which is 19 billion, um, that is quite a bit more, uh, considering, you know, it

1073
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,040
is a huge platform.

1074
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:15,560
I honestly think that this company is going to get, uh, too big for itself, uh, especially

1075
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:22,940
considering that like the rampant piracy of IP on the platform is going to, it's going

1076
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,480
to run into problems with that.

1077
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,300
I can see that at some point soon, um, wait, could you, could you do me a favor because

1078
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,360
you have kids?

1079
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,360
I don't have kids.

1080
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,360
Star soccer doesn't have kids.

1081
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,680
Could you do me a favor here?

1082
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,320
Explain Roblox Roblox.

1083
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,320
Like yeah.

1084
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,320
Okay.

1085
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,800
Why Roblox explain yourself.

1086
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:45,120
So Roblox is basically this platform that you go on there.

1087
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,980
It's free to play and you can actually play games.

1088
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,000
It looks similar to Lego a little bit.

1089
00:54:53,000 --> 00:55:00,600
They have these really blocky, iconic characters that you play as, and what's unique about

1090
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:05,720
it though, is all of this content in, in these games are all user generated.

1091
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:14,000
So basically if I, I could go on there, develop a game in Lua and sell content on this platform

1092
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,760
and basically make money off of this platform.

1093
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,680
And a lot of people do that and it's gotten so big though.

1094
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:24,160
That's like, you know, they have merchandise like crazy.

1095
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:30,360
Um, there's just so much merchandise, toys, uh, I'm surprised they don't have like shows

1096
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,400
or anything yet, but it's, my kids play this constantly.

1097
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:38,520
It is like literally the only game that they play is Roblox aside from Minecraft occasionally,

1098
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,640
but mostly Roblox.

1099
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:48,400
And it's like the dumbest, I mean, it's like the stuff that they're playing is definitely

1100
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:56,800
made by kids or folks that are not used to game development is jank as fuck, but they're

1101
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,080
having fun with it.

1102
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:03,000
So that's fine, but there are some things that are very much like, you know, you need

1103
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,560
to pay Roblox, which is the in game currency to do different things.

1104
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,880
So I don't know.

1105
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,040
It's a huge, huge, huge platform.

1106
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:17,400
How is it different than Minecraft is absolutely different.

1107
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,080
So where's Minecraft is basically the same thing.

1108
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:25,760
You can kind of tweak it a little bit to, um, make your own stuff like your own levels

1109
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,960
and everything.

1110
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,920
This is basically like a sandbox.

1111
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,480
Think of like Gary's mod a little bit.

1112
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,680
So it's like a sandbox.

1113
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:39,280
You can build worlds with your own graphics, your own sound, whatever.

1114
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,200
Um, a lot of it's ripped off of IPs that they definitely don't own.

1115
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:47,680
Um, but you know, that's the least of it.

1116
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,680
Okay.

1117
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:52,840
The oof sound as iconic as it is in this game is the least of it.

1118
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:59,080
I mean, they're just ripping off anything you can imagine and just the most horrid combination

1119
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:04,680
of audio visuals in imaginable, but Bobby does point out in chat too.

1120
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,680
They worked there.

1121
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,200
They worked their oof out.

1122
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,280
I'm paraphrasing, but they worked it all at Tommy, Tommy and Roblox.

1123
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,280
They cool now.

1124
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,280
Anyway.

1125
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,280
Yes.

1126
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,160
So, um, it, but basically think of it as like a big platform.

1127
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:22,720
Like we've seen some of the stuff with like, um, project spark on the Microsoft, uh, platforms.

1128
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,800
There's this new thing that's through unreal.

1129
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:29,440
That's kind of like that as well, where you can build your own worlds and dreams, dreams

1130
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,000
probably be a little bit like dreams if you could monetize dreams and it looked way more

1131
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:40,500
jank than, uh, that is, you know, honest, honestly, I should probably decide to play

1132
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,500
a stream on Roblox.

1133
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:45,720
One of these days, uh, my kids keep asking me to do that, but like I've tried playing

1134
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,460
with them and it's the stuff that they play is just very janky.

1135
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:52,040
Like it bothers me how janky it is.

1136
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:55,200
And, uh, but I mean, someday I could do it.

1137
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,200
It's all in Lua.

1138
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:01,360
So it's pretty easy to script for it's just, I don't know Lua, so I'd have to learn that,

1139
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:05,400
but what better way to learn, um, getting you some other comments from chat.

1140
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:09,440
Zen monkey 11 says Roblox has nine versus nine multiplayer baseball.

1141
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,520
I'm unimpressed by that EA and two K won't ever do that.

1142
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:18,480
Uh, Questbuster says some Roblox users have made a living on making things on Roblox in

1143
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,480
the six figure range.

1144
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,480
Oh, well, there you go.

1145
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,360
Pixel poops Roblox edition.

1146
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,360
Get on it.

1147
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,360
Granted.

1148
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,200
Like, you know, I'm, I am making fun of the stuff that I see my kids play, but my kids

1149
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,800
play some really dumb stuff.

1150
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:33,480
Like there's actually like very polished things that are on this platform.

1151
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,140
Um, and there's some things that aren't very polished.

1152
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:40,500
Like for example, something that my kids are really into was piggy for a while and piggy

1153
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:49,000
is kind of like, if you combine five nights at Freddy's with Peppa pig, it was that if

1154
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,400
you can imagine that.

1155
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,520
I'd rather not.

1156
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:59,120
So it's, it's, there's a lot of weird stuff on there, but binary binary six, six, seven

1157
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:03,400
and chat says my daughter just likes doing the obstacle course stuff and is much better

1158
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,400
at it than I am.

1159
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,600
Hey, if anything binary, um, take comfort in the fact that when your daughter gets to

1160
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:12,160
be our age, like when your daughter's in her forties, um, she'll lose all that video game

1161
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,160
skill.

1162
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,160
Cause that's what happened to me.

1163
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,200
I used to be able to beat mega man too easy peasy.

1164
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,320
You know, no, no problem.

1165
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,320
Quick man stage.

1166
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,320
No problem.

1167
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,320
You do it now.

1168
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,440
Mess.

1169
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,600
So take comfort in that one day.

1170
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:32,280
She might be better than you now, but it won't last forever anyway.

1171
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,040
Nothing lasts forever.

1172
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,040
And not Roblox.

1173
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,040
That's for sure.

1174
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,040
All right.

1175
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:42,360
But it's, it's interesting just how much, you know, the Roblox was valued at.

1176
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,560
Like that was like four times the worth of Bethesda or something like that.

1177
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,560
It's crazy.

1178
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,560
Yeah.

1179
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,960
Well it could go down eventually.

1180
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,840
Like there's a lot of things that are overvalued right now.

1181
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,240
Um, GameStop.

1182
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:58,240
So true, but I'm on that ship, so it's all good.

1183
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,520
All right.

1184
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,520
To the moon, right?

1185
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:01,520
Sweet money.

1186
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,520
Yeah.

1187
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,520
All right.

1188
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,000
Uh, let's talk about, Hey, one of the systems I know you can play Roblox on cause I think

1189
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,360
like the five minutes I tried, tried Roblox and I was like, what the hell am I doing?

1190
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,000
It was on my Xbox one.

1191
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,120
Well, the Xbox ones as well as Xbox series Xs, all the Xboxes, well from Xbox one, not

1192
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:26,280
the 360 or the old one, but all the newer Xboxes are getting a new software update.

1193
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:30,920
It will be adding some features, but it's also going to remove some features.

1194
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:34,800
There's going to be a compatibility patch for the new Xbox wireless headset.

1195
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:40,400
So that's kind of nice, but what they're getting rid of live TV listings in one guide.

1196
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,480
So you might remember, do you remember on the Xbox one, they really wanted you to hook

1197
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:47,760
up your TV through, actually, some of you might still do this out there, honestly.

1198
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:48,760
And it's fine.

1199
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:54,520
Um, yeah, I would do it too if I'd remembered to and I set up my TV, but, uh, there's not

1200
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,640
going to be TV listings in one guide anymore.

1201
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,640
It's going away.

1202
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:02,120
So no, no TV guide channel built into your, do people even know what that is anymore?

1203
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:06,280
I don't know, but that the listings will not be built in to the Xbox.

1204
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:11,480
You're going to have to rely on most TVs have that built in now though my, uh, my television

1205
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,720
has that built into it, which is weird.

1206
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,400
So I guess just went a different place.

1207
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:22,120
So, uh, you, the one guide will still stay so you can watch TV through HDMI.

1208
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:25,600
So like it's not suddenly shutting off your ability to actually watch TV.

1209
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,320
It's just the schedules are actually going away.

1210
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:32,440
Now other big features that are coming in the March update, you can actually enable

1211
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:36,440
or disable the auto HDR and FPS boost.

1212
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,960
That was what I was trying to think of earlier, the frame boost.

1213
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:44,240
So if a game supports it, you can boost the frame rate up to even possibly 120 frames

1214
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,840
per second, just depending on what game you're playing.

1215
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,240
So that's kind of cool.

1216
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:52,200
Some other minor tweaks, including achievements, going back to the mobile app, uh, and things

1217
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,200
like that.

1218
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,760
But that is a big Xbox console update that is on its way.

1219
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:02,120
Um, DJ Rama S talking about the TV thing says, I did that.

1220
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:06,560
I used to have my Fios box connected to my Xbox, but I had to remove that connection

1221
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:12,280
because I now have a 4k TV and that Xbox HDMI input isn't 4k.

1222
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:14,600
Oh, I didn't realize that.

1223
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:18,440
That's probably a big ouch as to why a lot of TV people aren't using that now.

1224
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,000
Um, let's see.

1225
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,200
Uh, Zen monkey 11 says I was born in 2000.

1226
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:27,000
What's a TV guide?

1227
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Don't do this.

1228
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,360
Did you, are you, are you really going to choose violence today?

1229
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:39,320
Um, look it up on Wikipedia.

1230
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,320
Get off my lawn.

1231
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:46,440
Uh, bonds double six says Pluto TV for now I, yeah, Pluto TV is, is an Xbox app and I've

1232
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:47,440
used that too.

1233
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,680
I mentioned a clue earlier and there's a lot of, they have a lot of interesting channels.

1234
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:55,880
They used to have a RuPaul's drag race channel that just showed nothing but drag race all

1235
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:56,880
day.

1236
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,040
That went away probably because of the paramount thing.

1237
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:02,560
But they do have as well, but they have a survivor channel, which is also a CBS, but

1238
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:05,040
they have a survivor channel, which plays nothing but old.

1239
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,880
I'm talking like old.

1240
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:11,560
I saw survivor, the Australian outback on it the other day, like old ass episodes of

1241
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:12,560
survivor.

1242
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,560
They just play all day long.

1243
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:14,560
So it's kind of fun.

1244
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,560
So, all right.

1245
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:16,560
Oh, good.

1246
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,760
Uh, Zen monkey 11 says I'm joking.

1247
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,880
I wasn't born in 2000.

1248
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,560
Oh, you did choose violence today, didn't you?

1249
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:23,560
Liar.

1250
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:24,560
All right.

1251
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:28,440
Anyway, that's the Xbox March update before I fight, fight our chatters.

1252
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:31,640
Moving on to our next story, dark Sakura.

1253
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:36,960
Well, one of my favorite ever game series are the teenage mutant Ninja Turtles arcade

1254
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,920
ones like turtles in time.

1255
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:42,760
And the first one that came out, those are, have always been like some of my favorites.

1256
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:51,120
And so there is a new one coming out in the same vein as those others.

1257
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:57,560
It's going to be called a teenage mutant Ninja Turtles shredders revenge.

1258
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,320
And it's actually looking pretty neat.

1259
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:05,640
And on top of that, you can play as all four turtles and splinter and April, although I

1260
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,240
don't see any Casey Jones anywhere.

1261
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:11,040
I don't know what's going on with that.

1262
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,280
But it looks, it looks really good.

1263
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,440
It's a 2d fighter.

1264
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:17,840
The characters have really great personality.

1265
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:20,680
Everything looks really awesome.

1266
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:27,800
I'm, I'm really, really hoping that that this does well, that it gives us more like that,

1267
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:34,120
but it's the same, uh, uh, you know, uh, group that did like wonder boy, the dragons trap,

1268
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,600
you know, so, oh, I didn't realize it was them.

1269
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:41,120
Oh, that was a good conversion tribute games.

1270
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,920
Nice.

1271
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,200
Yeah.

1272
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:47,040
So, um, so I'm really looking forward to it.

1273
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:51,920
I mean, we pretty much like, Dan was like the other day, Hey, there's a new teenage mutant

1274
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:52,160
turtles.

1275
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:52,600
Look at this.

1276
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,360
And I'm like, Ooh, yeah.

1277
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:57,680
So they really hit that sweet spot of just giving us what we want.

1278
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:02,400
You know, like when people think of the Ninja Turtles video game, they think of that, you know, even the

1279
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:08,120
guy born in 2000 thinks of the old school nineties, pizzeria arcade game.

1280
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:13,440
Like, yes, I know there's been other Ninja Turtles games, but none of them have captured quite the magic

1281
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,760
that that, cause they don't ask about the later Ninja Turtles games.

1282
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:21,920
Everybody asks about, you remember, you remember that nineties Ninja Turtles game that we played at the

1283
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:22,360
arcade.

1284
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,960
You remember that one with the four players, unfortunately.

1285
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:26,280
So I'm glad they're kind of going back to the formula that works.

1286
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:30,560
And I think it's really smart because this isn't in an arcade and you can do a little more with it.

1287
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:34,200
I think it's really smart for them to think about what if we did other characters, I don't think they've

1288
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,080
confirmed the April and shredder thing.

1289
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,240
People are kind of reading into it from the trailer.

1290
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:42,480
Well, they were in, they were in, uh, the preview fighting.

1291
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:42,880
Yeah.

1292
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,760
So, so, so people are assuming that you can play as them because they're fighting.

1293
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:49,200
Um, but I think that's, I think that's great.

1294
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:54,600
I think that's a great way to kind of expand on the idea without changing the idea.

1295
01:05:54,800 --> 01:06:00,800
Like, I didn't realize I want to play as April O'Neill in the Ninja Turtles game until you showed me that.

1296
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:07,160
Now I'm like, Oh, I want to do that April O'Neill too with that hideous, that hideous yellow jacket.

1297
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:11,560
Yeah, this is totally nineties Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

1298
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:15,720
So, um, I mean, Tiger call was talking about it being in the eighties.

1299
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,480
Uh, the, the series was not eighties.

1300
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,120
It was nineties.

1301
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,240
Um, I think it was on that bubble.

1302
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,880
I think like season one was like 89.

1303
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,680
Like, but we're, we're, we're nickel and diamond at this point.

1304
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:36,880
So now if they were going to do eighties though, it would be cool if there's like a bloody, all red bandana mode, you know, that's got like,

1305
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,040
Oh, you want to go comics?

1306
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,280
I'm going comics with this one.

1307
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,120
All right.

1308
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:42,720
All right.

1309
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:43,240
Yeah.

1310
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:47,080
Cause that's the original, that is the absolutely original.

1311
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:52,000
But that, but again, this is the one that people really remember, you know, that era of the,

1312
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:57,200
the cartoon that folks are saying came out in late 87, whatever.

1313
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:57,920
All right.

1314
01:06:58,880 --> 01:06:59,840
It's it was on the boat.

1315
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,520
It was on for so long.

1316
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:04,120
Most people probably picked it up in reruns in the nineties.

1317
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,880
You know, it's, there's a lot of that type of stuff.

1318
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,840
I was watching it with my brothers.

1319
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:08,440
Yeah.

1320
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,560
So, uh, honestly I was watching it more than my brothers.

1321
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,440
I think it looks great and I'm excited.

1322
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:21,360
Uh, I, I did not make the connection that the wonder, uh, wonderboy trap, the dragons trap people were doing it.

1323
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,800
And that makes me even more excited.

1324
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:28,800
Like there's just certain studios that are getting the retro re the blaster master zero folks, another one of them.

1325
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,800
They're just getting the remakes.

1326
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:31,320
Right.

1327
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,280
Like they're doing the retro remakes.

1328
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:33,800
Right.

1329
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,200
And that's very exciting.

1330
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,560
So awesome.

1331
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:39,440
You know, I would still think it would be fun though.

1332
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:45,920
I mean, I love that they're going off of the previous games, you know, like the one, the arcade games that we have.

1333
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:56,480
I honestly would also really like to see the similar type of game, but in the IDW universe, because there's some really neat characters in the IDW comics right now.

1334
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,600
That's I've actually been reading that fairly religiously.

1335
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:01,720
All right.

1336
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,320
Anyway, this is still making me happy.

1337
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,600
So no, it's all good.

1338
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:08,360
I think that trailer made a lot of people happy because it was also, it's just unexpected.

1339
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:13,680
Like, you know, it kind of came out of nowhere that like, Hey, by the way, there's a new Ninja Turtles game coming.

1340
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,760
And it's old school.

1341
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:21,240
Here we are on Mario day and I'm expecting Mario announcements and all we get is Ninja Turtles.

1342
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:24,880
It's like, geez, but I'll tell you, I didn't even realize I'm dressed for Mario day.

1343
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:28,360
I'm wearing my Mario shirt today on stream for those watching on Twitch.

1344
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,360
I just realized I've had this shirt forever.

1345
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,520
The shirt is very old, but it's one of my faves.

1346
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:33,440
All right.

1347
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:35,320
It is not as old as Mario three.

1348
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,480
Um, but probably close.

1349
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,360
All right, let's move on.

1350
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:40,280
Uh, okay.

1351
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:47,640
Loki, this is another one you're going to have to explain because this, this doesn't make sense, but can you try to make sense of it?

1352
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,800
Loki, this next story.

1353
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:57,920
So, yeah, so the big, like buzzword this week has been NFT, which is non fungible tokens.

1354
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:02,160
So it's basically, I got an, I got NFT for this.

1355
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:03,040
No fucking time.

1356
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,000
It's basically what it is.

1357
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:18,800
Is like, you know how with Bitcoin, there's kind of the blockchain, the track who has, um, possession of a specific Bitcoin at any time.

1358
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:24,600
And so you can track that actually being able to take a digital good and have ownership of it.

1359
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,320
So that's kind of what it is.

1360
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:39,600
So people now are selling all sorts of dumb things as NFTs, um, everything from like, just like artwork to really dumb things.

1361
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:44,640
Like I saw someone that took a picture of their scrotum and they are selling as an F T.

1362
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:50,920
So, um, obviously folks are really trying to cash in on this right now.

1363
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,680
Um, was it a nice scrotum?

1364
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:54,360
Don't answer, don't answer.

1365
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,800
It's iDubbbz from, it's iDubbbz.

1366
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,080
Was it FreshlyShorn?

1367
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,800
He just did the bat wing thing.

1368
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,480
So it was tastefully, the sun was coming through it.

1369
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,720
You could see the veins and everything.

1370
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,040
Okay, enough.

1371
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:14,760
Anyways, so they, they're selling like, was it a Beeple?

1372
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,400
I don't know if you know of Beeple.

1373
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,760
Was it a Beeple?

1374
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,360
I don't know if you know of Beeple.

1375
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:27,120
There, Beeple is a, uh, an artist who actually puts out, he put a new piece of art every day for like 15 years.

1376
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,080
So he sold his collection of art.

1377
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:40,080
Um, and there's one massive, like huge image for 69, I think it was like $69 million, some ridiculous amount of money that people pay for that.

1378
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:45,360
And what you get is basically like a digital image, but you own it.

1379
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:51,600
Which I don't understand that in the sense that, um, it's a digital image.

1380
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,920
I mean, I can make copies of it.

1381
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:57,320
I can just do whatever, but apparently it's somehow you get ownership of it.

1382
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:02,640
So I don't really know how that works, but it's the thing that people are trying to make money off of right now.

1383
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:05,440
The certificate of authenticity is yours.

1384
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:15,240
I mean, in theory, I get the NFT thing in theory as like a way to support artists, especially during this difficult time.

1385
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,560
We're going to art galleries, maybe doesn't work.

1386
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:28,120
So if the artist chooses to use this as a way to drive sales so that they can buy food and pay rent, I don't have a problem with that.

1387
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,360
And I'm not going to shade that.

1388
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,800
Where this is getting out of control is this shit I'm hearing about.

1389
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,240
Like what?

1390
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:39,360
You can go on Twitter, tag a certain account and like, cause I hear people are doing this to like get this Twitter account.

1391
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:51,280
They're, they're tagging like Disney and Marvel tweets as NFT and trying to sell those to get the Disney and Marvel lawyers to like shut NFT down as if you could do that.

1392
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:51,680
I don't know.

1393
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:57,480
Like if somebody tried to sell OLR, like one of our episodes is NFT.

1394
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:04,400
I'm going to tell you here and now that they don't mean shit unless they're coming from us and we say we're selling it.

1395
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,200
And like, then those NFTs are garbage.

1396
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,280
They don't mean anything.

1397
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,600
And I don't think we have a plan to do that.

1398
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:14,440
Although, I mean, like if the price was right, maybe, but I just don't, I don't, what, what's the point?

1399
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:18,840
You could own Orange On Radio episode 860, but what's, what's the point?

1400
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:24,000
If you want to support us, you, which you certainly don't have to, we've been doing this show for free for years.

1401
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:28,720
You, you guys know plenty of other, you can do the subs, you can do the biddies, you know, all that stuff that you do on Twitch.

1402
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:29,240
That's lovely.

1403
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:29,840
That's wonderful.

1404
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,720
You don't have to, but a lot of you do, and we love that and appreciate that.

1405
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,760
You can do the merchandise at vognetwork.com slash shop, cheap plug.

1406
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,040
You don't have to, but we love it when you do.

1407
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:57,960
Um, I just, but if somebody were to try to like make OLR NFTs outside of us and like Bobby and Jason and people that would maybe have a little bit of a right to state claim to a little bit of OLR outside of that bubble, like, no, like don't do that.

1408
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,440
Like it's, can't, can't I just say it's worthless?

1409
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:01,720
It's it, I don't know.

1410
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:02,240
It's weird.

1411
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,600
I find the whole tagging things.

1412
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,920
Anything is NFT.

1413
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,280
Your balls is NFT.

1414
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,240
I find that very strange.

1415
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,040
I think it's a technology that needs to be perfected.

1416
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:14,480
Yeah.

1417
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,320
So anyways, uh, getting back to gaming though.

1418
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:23,440
So one example of some, um, indie game companies to kind of take advantage of this.

1419
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:36,560
So there was this game, uh, called, uh, this, uh, guy, uh, was a company, Roarer, um, who was a creator of indie games, like the passage, the castle doctrine and one hour, one life.

1420
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:53,840
So he put out an NFT auction called the crypto doctrine, and there was 155 paintings that he had originally commissioned for the use of in the castle doctrine, which is a game about home defense, I guess.

1421
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:04,160
And anyways, inside that, um, so he was auctioning off these 145 paintings, but the folks that made those paintings, the individual artists.

1422
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:13,240
Didn't have any idea that he was doing this and basically said, no, Hey, I didn't consent to selling the art as an NFT, though.

1423
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:19,400
I'm not sure if you commissioned something, if you really have control on over what it can and cannot be used for.

1424
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:24,920
And in the sense that you're using a promote promotional materials for your game, I don't know.

1425
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:28,080
That doesn't make any sense to me, but that's between the artist and the buyer.

1426
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:28,960
Exactly.

1427
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:34,400
So apparently a lot of the creators with that, you know, were unaware that they were doing that.

1428
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:50,520
Um, there is also, um, let's see what else, uh, lots of folks just basically, you know, and I think this kind of goes back to, we were talking about the Twitter stuff where people are just being able to tag an account and sell it as an NFT.

1429
01:14:51,120 --> 01:15:00,800
A lot of like content that they're not really sure who is the owner of it in trying to sell it now as an NFT, because Taco Bell is selling NFTs.

1430
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:07,320
I mean, so yeah, it's just no, no, no fucking tacos.

1431
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:09,120
Yeah.

1432
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:13,680
And the thing with that too, it's like these NFTs, like you could have some really cool stuff with it.

1433
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:22,800
Like say if we had an OLR NFT or something like that, where like you buy those and then it gets you access to special things or something like that.

1434
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:23,960
That'd be pretty cool.

1435
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:26,480
But that is literally a Twitch subscription.

1436
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,440
That is literally what that will do.

1437
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:29,040
Yeah.

1438
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,960
But the truth, but this is going to be more expensive.

1439
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,800
So, okay.

1440
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:34,440
I see.

1441
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,240
Well then sub at the $20 level.

1442
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:39,360
I'm not going to stop anyone from doing that.

1443
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:43,000
No, you need to go higher millions.

1444
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:48,080
Anyways, yeah, well, and okay.

1445
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:56,320
So aside from all the stupidness that's along with that, then there's also the talk about the whole blockchain technology.

1446
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:12,480
And so how energy inefficient it is and how, especially with crypto mining is literally using tons of electricity to make these calculations to see, to calculate the blockchain.

1447
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:21,480
And so it's causing issues with pollution even because of all the electricity that it's being used up to do this.

1448
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:34,840
So that's also another thing that folks are kind of, kind of basic climbing down on all sorts of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology because of stuff like this.

1449
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,680
So I don't know, it's messy.

1450
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:47,520
I don't really know what we can really use this for, but certainly I don't have anything that interests me as far as the NFTs that have been offered so far.

1451
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:54,560
I mean, I just, I don't see what the point is in owning like a one of a kind digital item that doesn't make any sense.

1452
01:16:55,400 --> 01:17:03,760
IceP1 in chat, love that name, says, one of the things NFTs can do is earn the originator or royalty.

1453
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:13,120
And I do want to emphasize, and I think Loki feels this way too, is that again, to support artists who are struggling right now in the times of COVID.

1454
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:17,720
Again, the arrangement between the buyer and the artist is between the buyer and the artist.

1455
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:25,320
And if that arrangement is I'm giving you this special token, that means this is yours and for everybody else, it's just a copy.

1456
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:28,040
If and that's something they agree to, then that's fine.

1457
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:29,200
I don't have a problem with that.

1458
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:30,520
I don't think anybody has a problem with that.

1459
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:42,040
Where shit gets weird is where anybody can tag something as an NFT and these things that aren't really art, like Jack's first tweet is an NFT.

1460
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:42,720
Why?

1461
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:44,480
And Jack doesn't need the money.

1462
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,040
You know that, that he, he might've been doing it for charity.

1463
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:53,280
If he did, if he's doing it for charity, I'll, I'll, I'll back off a little bit on what I just said.

1464
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:57,480
Um, but I think, I think you kind of hopefully see the difference here.

1465
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:03,720
You know, when it's a, when it's a struggling artist finding a new inventive way, like it's, it's their version of a Twitch sub or whatever it is.

1466
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,040
An NFT is cool.

1467
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:18,560
Like I might even look into that for, for an artist who I really like, but for like, you know, tagging random tweets and everything on the internet, video game art, you had nothing to do with and labeling that an NFT.

1468
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:21,160
That's where it's like, okay, this shit is out of control.

1469
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:27,280
Like, and you're just begging for this to be regulated, which you probably, nobody's going to win in that scenario.

1470
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,000
If that makes sense.

1471
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:28,720
I hope that makes sense.

1472
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:35,600
So I hope, hope that kind of makes our stance clear where it's like, where we, where we are making fun of NFT or where we are not making fun of NFT.

1473
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:36,480
I hope that's kind of clear.

1474
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,600
So anything you want to add to that Loki?

1475
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,000
I, I get it good.

1476
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:41,960
I think that's about it.

1477
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:42,400
Yeah.

1478
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:43,320
All right.

1479
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:44,880
Well then let's move on.

1480
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:48,840
Let's move on to something that I think a lot of people are going to have a hard time understanding.

1481
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:59,080
And that is, uh, this Twitch program that's happening behind the scenes about scoring streamers to possibly be used with ad sales.

1482
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:01,000
So let me talk about what's going on.

1483
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:05,640
So there's something that's happening behind the scenes called the brand safety score.

1484
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:19,280
It was found in Twitch's internal API by Twitter user Tayari CS, who talked about a little bit, wrote some tweets about it and actually posted pictures of the change log on Twitter.

1485
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:28,040
Now, Twitch, you know, because they, they probably weren't really ready to talk about this, but then why do you put the code out in live if you don't want it to be found?

1486
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:40,920
Cause there are people that do this, uh, Twitch did put a statement on it saying we are exploring ways to improve the experience on Twitch for viewers and creators, including efforts to better match the appropriate ads to the right communities.

1487
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:43,320
User privacy is critical on Twitch.

1488
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:48,080
And as we refine the process, we will not pursue plans that compromise that priority.

1489
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,560
Nothing is launched yet.

1490
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:54,280
No personal information was shared and we will keep our community informed of any updates along the way.

1491
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:58,600
The original tweet by Tayari CS, uh, was a series of tweets.

1492
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:11,680
The first one reading Twitch has added an automatic brand safety score, which grades how brand friendly every streamer is based on things like chat behavior, ban history, manual ratings by Twitch staff.

1493
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:12,920
Games played.

1494
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:14,520
Times could say the N word.

1495
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:20,080
Age, you honestly shouldn't be on Twitch if the answer is one, to be honest.

1496
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,200
But anyway, that's another story.

1497
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:31,120
Uh, games played, age, auto, if the answer is one and you are in a group that is not supposed to say that word, just to make that very clear.

1498
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:31,720
All right.

1499
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,320
Games played, age, auto mod, and more.

1500
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,040
Uh, and so on.

1501
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:50,760
Um, it's kind of like that whole argument that's going on about use of the LGBTQ tag because unfortunately Twitch currently, or at least of a few days ago and Dark Sakura try to.

1502
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:52,640
You're not going to like this.

1503
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,200
I'm just, don't shoot the messenger.

1504
01:20:54,880 --> 01:21:05,040
Twitch unfortunately has labeled that LGBTQIA is okay for allies to use because for some people, the A means allies.

1505
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:10,120
It, the A, just to be clear, actually stands for asexual.

1506
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:10,600
Okay.

1507
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:11,960
Just, just so we're all clear on this.

1508
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:25,040
Um, but this has caused people to kind of ask Twitch or, or, or some people who are using the LGBTQIA tag on their streams are saying, I'm doing this because I want people to know that this is a safe space.

1509
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:30,880
This is a place that, you know, LGBTQ people can be and, and they're accepted and I'm not going to judge them or that stuff.

1510
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:37,720
And my response to that is, you know, again, when you're well intentioned, I'm not going to attack dog you.

1511
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:40,400
So I'm not going to attack dog anybody who does that.

1512
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:59,240
But my simple answer would be, if your space is not welcoming to diverse groups, including LGBTQIA, including issues of race, including issues of gender, including if, if your space is not welcoming to that, then why the fuck are you allowed on Twitch in the first place?

1513
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:05,080
Just, just a question I'd like to know the answer to.

1514
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:12,520
If, if you are, if you are a dangerous place for LGBTQ or any of that, why are you on Twitch in the first, you shouldn't be here.

1515
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,640
Just making that clear.

1516
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:33,440
Anyway, I think it would be great personally, if Twitch brought back the Twitch unity tag, because I felt that was a very good all encompassing tag to sort of show that you as a streamer accept a certain set of values and that you're going to enforce those values on your stream.

1517
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:38,840
In my personal opinion, they should bring that tag back, but I don't, I don't work at Twitch.

1518
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:39,440
So whatever.

1519
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,480
Anyway, I'm sorry I got on a tangent, but it was an important one.

1520
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:56,720
Um, now going back to the tweet, uh, the brand safety score talks about if, uh, you know, a streamer is ranked based on their age, like if they're over 18 or 21, what's their suspension history like, what's their relationship history with Twitch and so forth.

1521
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:05,840
I don't think people should be too freaked out about this, although certainly not everybody's going to like the whole big brother is watching you kind of thing.

1522
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:06,960
You know what I mean?

1523
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:21,000
Like people are not going to like that they're being ranked behind the scenes and all this stuff, but I get that Twitch is doing it because if there is a streamer out there that is very nasty towards certain minority communities.

1524
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,200
Again, I want to know why they're on Twitch to begin with, but fine.

1525
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:34,680
Different topic, but there's going to be advertisers that don't want to advertise with that audience because they don't want their products associated with that, right?

1526
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:37,280
Because what always happens with boycotts, right?

1527
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,360
When you decide you're going to boycott Fox News or something, who do they go after?

1528
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:41,680
The advertisers, right?

1529
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:57,040
So I think Twitch is kind of trying to create that environment for the advertisers, basically, so that they can somewhat guarantee that they're not going to be having their advertisements on streams run by assholes.

1530
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:01,480
Again, why do assholes get to stream on Twitch?

1531
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:07,040
Freedom of speech doesn't apply here at Twitch Amazon private company.

1532
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,400
It's a yeah, it's a private company.

1533
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:12,680
There's absolutely nothing that a person could complain about.

1534
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:16,240
I mean, well, they could complain about it, but it's not going to do anything.

1535
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,480
There's no legal precedents.

1536
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:18,080
Right.

1537
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:25,920
So anyway, um, DJ Obama S in chat says, I second that on both podcasts and Twitch streams.

1538
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:26,400
I do.

1539
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:32,960
I have staffers that represent LGBTQ, but as a straight cis male, I won't use it for that reason alone.

1540
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:39,040
Um, that, and we don't, we don't use that tag here, even though I'm gay, Dark Soccer's asexual.

1541
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,360
She's talked about that before.

1542
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:44,840
Um, Loki is our token cis, cis hetero white dude.

1543
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:53,080
Um, you know, it's, but we don't use that tag because it's not that a, it's not all that what the show is about.

1544
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:57,800
B, um, not all of us are directly LGBTQ and so forth.

1545
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:02,120
But if there was a Twitch unity tag, I'd be happy to use that.

1546
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:08,200
Because I do think this show subscribes to certain standards where everybody is welcome here.

1547
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:12,480
You know, I know we use the tagline where every gamer has a voice a lot here.

1548
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:17,000
Um, I think another tagline, although we don't own this, we didn't start this, but I love it.

1549
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,800
And I embrace it is that gaming is for everyone, period.

1550
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:25,000
And I think that's a standard that we, uh, subscribe to here at OLR.

1551
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:28,240
So yes, Act F says Loki is here and supportive.

1552
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:30,360
Yes, Loki is awesome.

1553
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:31,320
Loki is awesome.

1554
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,320
On this show, Loki is awesome off this show.

1555
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:36,400
I'm not going to inflate his ego too much, but Loki is amazing.

1556
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,160
And OLR wouldn't be the same without him.

1557
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:38,720
We all know that.

1558
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:39,720
All right.

1559
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:45,120
Um, you know, he's not LGBTQ, but nobody's perfect.

1560
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:46,960
All right.

1561
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:47,880
Sorry.

1562
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:49,840
All right.

1563
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:50,880
Anyway.

1564
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:52,360
Uh, all right.

1565
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,280
Let's move on.

1566
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,400
Uh, I think I said enough.

1567
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,840
I I've gone on too many tangents from that story.

1568
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:58,920
So let's go to the next one.

1569
01:25:58,920 --> 01:25:59,680
Dark Sakura.

1570
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:05,160
So, um, Squinnix has some news for us.

1571
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:05,760
Yay.

1572
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:11,080
Well, actually we're going to be, um, getting more information about it on the

1573
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:16,560
18th, but they are going to show some details on the next life is strange game.

1574
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:22,360
Um, there's going to be a 40 minutes starting at 1 PM Eastern, um, to, you

1575
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:27,960
know, go with all the upcoming games are going to be, um, and they're also talking

1576
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,360
about an April 1st release date.

1577
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:37,400
Um, also the game, uh, Outriders will be included with, with that conversation.

1578
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:40,080
Interesting.

1579
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,240
I think some people are blowing this way out of proportion because

1580
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:46,080
Square Enix announced an event and now people are like, oh, they're

1581
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,200
going to show final fantasy.

1582
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:52,080
A lot of people are totally into life is strange.

1583
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:56,120
And I think that it's definitely gonna, you know, raise some hype.

1584
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:57,240
Oh, for sure.

1585
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:57,640
Yeah.

1586
01:26:57,640 --> 01:26:59,000
People are super into that series.

1587
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:02,760
There was a spinoff game too, that was in the, the lion.

1588
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:03,680
I can't remember the name of it.

1589
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:05,520
Somebody in shadow shouted out, I'm sure.

1590
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:09,440
Um, and I imagine maybe, maybe because of the popularity of life is strange,

1591
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:15,280
maybe Square Enix, maybe, maybe bolded underlined has other type of those like

1592
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:22,200
narrative games maybe in process and who knows they could tie into other IPs, but

1593
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:25,680
I'm, I'm, I'm setting these real like tinfoil hat, crazy expectations.

1594
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:27,280
I don't think anyone should go into this with.

1595
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:29,480
I think this is something for the life of strange fans.

1596
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:33,080
I think, um, you know, people that are into the series will be very happy with this.

1597
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:36,720
Other people should not expect things outside of that.

1598
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,440
Outside of what dark soccer just mentioned with the

1599
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:40,640
outsiders and all that stuff.

1600
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:41,760
This is yeah.

1601
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:48,640
Pretty much going to be a fairly specific type of release, if that makes sense.

1602
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:52,040
So series of releases.

1603
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:52,840
Yeah.

1604
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,440
Well, yeah, because they're episodic games.

1605
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:59,120
So there will certainly be probably three or five of them, just depending on how

1606
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,160
many episodes they, they end up doing with that.

1607
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:02,600
So, all right.

1608
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:06,600
As soon as Matt Chat says Square Enix, it's totally not a direct event.

1609
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:10,720
No, I think, I think your big news on other games, you know, obviously they've

1610
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:14,040
been peppered other places like the Nintendo direct had a lot of Square Enix

1611
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:17,360
news in it, PlayStation had a huge Square Enix news thing in it.

1612
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,840
Um, but look, look for June.

1613
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:24,600
You know, June is when they'll, they'll do another big update for E3.

1614
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:28,440
I'm using my Cody fingers or whatever that turns out to look like.

1615
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:31,960
So, all right, let's move on Loki.

1616
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:33,960
All right.

1617
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:40,800
Uh, so we've always heard so many stories of devs having to work

1618
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,680
through not ideal conditions.

1619
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:45,840
And here's some more stories about that.

1620
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:52,440
So, uh, Capcom had their employees working at the office, um,

1621
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:57,680
apparently after a cyber attack and also, um, in the office,

1622
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:00,120
despite the COVID restrictions.

1623
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:04,440
So apparently this is coming from a whistleblower report that claims

1624
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:08,520
that the actual conditions for game developers at the company, uh, were

1625
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:14,480
less than ideal and apparently Capcom had suffered a cyber attack with a

1626
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:18,600
one terabyte of the employee and customer data stolen due to this attack.

1627
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:23,920
Capcom wasn't able to safely have, uh, their external network secured

1628
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,720
and have employees work remotely.

1629
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:31,600
So in that case, they had idea to have them, uh, it says we're abandoning

1630
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:35,000
the remote network for the time and have decided that there is no

1631
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,520
choice, but to come to work.

1632
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:42,840
And because of that, of course, folks were anxious, um, because of, you

1633
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:46,600
know, distancing and everything may not be possible in that type of an

1634
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:51,480
environment to be able to, um, you know, isolate yourself enough

1635
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:53,200
without, you know, contaminating.

1636
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:56,480
We've heard so many reports of different workplaces, you know,

1637
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:58,200
having COVID spread through there.

1638
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:05,800
But yeah, apparently, um, you know, they Capcom did respond saying, you

1639
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:09,720
know, while there are none currently active within the company, employees

1640
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:14,800
are free to form labor unions and Capcom strictly observes all relevant

1641
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,760
laws and regulations regarding employees forming unions, Capcom is committed to

1642
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:20,880
strictly observing all laws and regulations.

1643
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:21,280
Wow.

1644
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:24,840
That sounds like a lot of, uh, lawyer PRSP.

1645
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,240
That's a very interesting statement.

1646
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:31,640
I just, just the fact that they're like, go ahead, form a union.

1647
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:33,200
Do it, do it, bitch.

1648
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:33,760
Do it.

1649
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:38,600
Well, cause cause there's been a lot of talk about the, these, um, employees

1650
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:43,960
like in, in Gerald is forming a union because of the, um, to try to get

1651
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:45,320
better working conditions.

1652
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:49,120
So that it was kind of weird that that was the first thing that came to their

1653
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:51,200
head when I'm talking about that stuff.

1654
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:54,760
But yeah, I don't know.

1655
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:59,760
It, it seems like, cause the punishment's not enough for these companies that

1656
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,560
they're just going to go ahead and risk their employees because they see them as

1657
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:08,040
just, you know, um, I'm surprised, I'm surprised we haven't seen an employee

1658
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:10,000
who caught COVID Sue their employer.

1659
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,720
Um, maybe, maybe it has happened.

1660
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:16,160
I'm sure that it's probably happened.

1661
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:20,440
I mean, especially in like, you know, these Amazon warehouses and stuff like

1662
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:25,520
that, somebody, I mean, God, there's so many terrible working conditions with that.

1663
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:28,240
I'm not saying, I'm not automatically saying, Oh, they should win.

1664
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:30,920
And also I'm just saying, I'm surprised in this Sue happy U S of

1665
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:33,400
a that we live in, we haven't seen, but you're right.

1666
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:34,240
It probably has happened.

1667
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:35,920
I'm just not paying enough attention, which is fair.

1668
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:41,520
And then along with that though, we also had the developers of star citizen,

1669
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:46,880
um, kind of fed up that they had to work during the, uh, that huge

1670
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:49,320
snow storm that was in Texas.

1671
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:56,160
And, um, apparently, you know, they were trying to juggle work and also,

1672
01:31:56,200 --> 01:32:00,760
um, you know, safety because, you know, a lot of the roads and everything were

1673
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:02,720
closed and power outages and all that.

1674
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:10,480
Um, basically, you know, there is a lot of, you know, issues with, you know,

1675
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:14,760
just being able to safely travel and the fact that they're having to

1676
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:18,280
come into work, um, is concerning.

1677
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:22,920
Of course, CIG, uh, did come out and provide a statement saying our staff

1678
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:25,960
safety and wellbeing are priority to us at all times.

1679
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:30,840
And since the Austin offices, we had remained close to general staff since

1680
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:34,360
the beginning of the pandemic, the teams working from home in the immediate

1681
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:38,720
aftermath of the Texas storm, the studio leadership reached out to all 100 plus

1682
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:42,960
employees through their managers individually, the offer support, of

1683
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:48,640
course, you know, that doesn't really explain why they're coming into the

1684
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:49,280
office.

1685
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:54,160
Um, I don't know that stuff is dangerous.

1686
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:57,200
I mean, lots of people die during that snow storm, just because of all the

1687
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,920
power outages, not being able to stay warm and everything.

1688
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:02,200
So I don't know why you would even risk it.

1689
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:04,720
And during a pandemic, but again, it's Texas and they have the

1690
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:05,640
whole state opening up.

1691
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:06,320
So who knows?

1692
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,040
Who knows?

1693
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:11,760
Um, Bobby in chat, uh, with a good, uh, uh, follow up to what my, my question

1694
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,840
I asked a lot about, um, suing employers.

1695
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:17,760
Bobby says, uh, one of the things in the original economic relief bill that I

1696
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:21,600
believe got taken out was to make companies not liable if their employees

1697
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:24,720
caught COVID at work, it didn't make it in the final bill, but they tried.

1698
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:25,880
And I was like, that's right.

1699
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:30,600
I do remember that being, that being a thing, um, that they tried to put that

1700
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,640
in there and thankfully it didn't go through.

1701
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:36,320
I think in, you know, you gotta, you kind of walk a fine line.

1702
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:39,320
This is an opinion, but I think especially in some of these cases that

1703
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:42,200
Loki's pointing out, like, especially the star citizen thing, which isn't

1704
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:46,480
even related to COVID, but like if your employer knowingly and willingly put

1705
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:51,920
you in danger in a dangerous situation, um, and you have an injury because of

1706
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:57,600
that, I kind of think like, you ought to have some type of legal recourse

1707
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:59,240
through that, but that's my opinion.

1708
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:00,880
And I get to have an opinion.

1709
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:06,440
Um, so anyway, I just, I just can't believe a video game is worth that.

1710
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:10,240
Cause you know, again, I didn't experience that Texas stuff firsthand,

1711
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:11,680
but I had a lot of friends that did.

1712
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:14,600
And, um, it sounded, it sounded horrible.

1713
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:16,760
Like I don't really have any other word to describe it.

1714
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:18,200
It just sounded horrible.

1715
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:21,200
And I'm so sorry to my friends that had to go through that whole situation.

1716
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:24,000
Um, and we can point the finger and we can blame all we want.

1717
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:25,960
Um, but I'm not going to do that right now.

1718
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:29,000
But what I am going to do is just express the frustration that

1719
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,880
like a fricking video game.

1720
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:35,200
Getting made was that important to put people's lives further

1721
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,400
at risk in a horrible situation.

1722
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:39,840
Yeah, that is crazy.

1723
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:40,280
Yeah.

1724
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:41,640
All right.

1725
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:43,920
Disgusting is what it is.

1726
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:44,720
It is.

1727
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:48,040
Um, as Joan had a mat chat says, I work in live TV realm.

1728
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:51,400
I have had to come into work during snow storms, hurricanes, whole city blackouts.

1729
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:55,200
I was never forced to come into work per se, but you feel that employee politics

1730
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:58,880
pressure, you bring up a very interesting point though, and I don't know how far

1731
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:04,080
down this rabbit hole I want to go, but I think in certain industries, you know,

1732
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:08,040
there's going to be certain risks and I think the world of live TV, and I only

1733
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:14,240
say this because again, I don't work in live TV, but I did, I wanted to, at one

1734
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:18,080
point I wanted to be a reporter, actually, I wanted to be a weatherman and I interned

1735
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,920
at a CBS station for a little while.

1736
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:23,240
And they got to talk to a lot of reporters about their lives and so forth.

1737
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:28,080
And I sort of think like if I had, and maybe part of the reason I didn't go into

1738
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:33,000
that life was because there were certain things about it maybe I wasn't really

1739
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:39,280
willing to go for, you know, like the excitement of, and I mean the excitement

1740
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:44,840
of finding a dead body because it's going to make a big story that, that, that whole

1741
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:48,920
experience still to this day sits really weird with me and I'm not sure that was

1742
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:49,960
really for me.

1743
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:52,240
And again, I'm not, I mean, look, look, people watch it.

1744
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:55,400
I understand that's the industry and that's not your industry, Matt, that

1745
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:59,240
brought that up, but like it's just, there's certain things you kind of know

1746
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:02,600
you're gonna put up with to be in certain areas.

1747
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:08,480
Making video games and risking your life for it is not one of them.

1748
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:12,320
But like if you go into the field to be a TV reporter, you probably know they're

1749
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:14,720
going to send you to the middle of a hurricane too, right?

1750
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:15,520
Cause right, right.

1751
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,920
When you turn on CNN or whatever it is you watch in one of those hurricanes,

1752
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,440
there's always some poor reporter there that looks like they're about to blow

1753
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:24,920
away, you know, because they, you got, you got to see it firsthand, right?

1754
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:27,480
So anyway, yeah.

1755
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:31,080
Um, SHO 100, Matt in chat says, exactly.

1756
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:34,200
You kind of accept that risk and they kind of put that risk in front of you.

1757
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:34,520
Yeah.

1758
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:36,000
So it's, it's crazy stuff.

1759
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:36,240
All right.

1760
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:37,080
Anyway, sorry.

1761
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:38,720
We're, we're a little far down the rabbit hole.

1762
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:40,560
I want to move on, keep the show moving.

1763
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:41,680
Uh, let's talk.

1764
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:43,880
Well, what rabbit holes don't we go down?

1765
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:44,960
Right.

1766
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:46,240
Another intersect.

1767
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:50,720
What other, uh, analogies do I have to call tangents on this show?

1768
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:52,000
All right.

1769
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:53,440
Uh, anyhow.

1770
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,040
Yeah.

1771
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:58,920
As that in chat says, you have to decide where your line is in safety and

1772
01:36:58,920 --> 01:36:59,640
mortality.

1773
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:00,560
Okay.

1774
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:00,800
Yeah.

1775
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,080
Or, and morally, I'm sorry.

1776
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:02,920
Safety and morally.

1777
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:04,440
Y'all ready for another tangent?

1778
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:05,080
Y'all ready?

1779
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:06,840
I got one.

1780
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:07,560
Okay.

1781
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:12,080
So because Alan's been doing more streaming, sometimes I'll let him have the

1782
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:13,120
office to himself.

1783
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:19,160
And one thing, Hey Dan, one thing that I've been, one thing that I've been getting

1784
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:23,720
into while I, he is doing streaming, I have started becoming that person that

1785
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:26,360
really enjoys watching documentaries on Netflix.

1786
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:29,000
Um, I watched a murder among the Mormons.

1787
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:29,680
That was pretty good.

1788
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:36,840
Uh, and I just watched the four part Jeffrey Epstein documentary, which there's

1789
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:43,000
a lot I could say about that documentary and just how, how mad I just was, how

1790
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:48,880
mad, anyway, that's not the tangent I want to take inhale, exhale, but part of

1791
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:53,680
that documentary was that they had a pretty extensive interview with one of

1792
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:58,240
the defense lawyers for Jeffrey Epstein, who of course is one of the well-known

1793
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:01,440
gets paid a lot of fucking money because that's what he does.

1794
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:06,080
And he talked about very frankly, in this documentary, when you agree to be a

1795
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:09,000
defense lawyer, you are agreeing to these sorts of things.

1796
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:12,000
You are out there looking for the best interest of your client and dah, dah, dah,

1797
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:12,240
dah, dah.

1798
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:15,360
And he said these in a very like matter of fact way.

1799
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:21,120
And you know, and as that's comment made me think of this, um, the, the whole, uh,

1800
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:24,080
you have to choose what you do ethically and morally, because I'm looking at this

1801
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:29,800
guy going, this guy you're defending is an absolute total fucking piece of shit.

1802
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:31,480
How are you okay with that?

1803
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:33,400
How are you okay with that?

1804
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:37,920
But every, everybody draws the line where they're okay with it.

1805
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,480
Anyway, sorry.

1806
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:44,520
I said no more tangents and then took a big one, but I had to get that off my

1807
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:45,720
chat. You did it chat.

1808
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:46,440
It's your fault.

1809
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:49,480
It's chat's fault.

1810
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:52,760
They say things and then they make me think things that I have to say in this

1811
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:53,320
microphone.

1812
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:56,360
All right, let's move on.

1813
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:57,200
Oh, I have the next story.

1814
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:57,480
Hurry.

1815
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:01,320
Um, let's talk about Bamani.

1816
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,320
We haven't done that on this show in a long time.

1817
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:06,240
Let's talk about Bamani, um, because it's still going.

1818
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:09,120
There are, of course, you know, we know there's new 2DX styles happening and

1819
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:09,720
things like that.

1820
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,400
And Bamani is entering an interesting new space.

1821
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:17,560
Um, Konami is going to be releasing a new rhythm game in the Bamani series called

1822
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:18,760
Beat Arena.

1823
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:21,000
What makes this game special?

1824
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:24,640
It is a Oculus Quest and Oculus 2 games.

1825
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:29,240
So it is Konami's first VR music game.

1826
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:32,560
Now, of course, VR music games have been done, right?

1827
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:33,240
Beat Saber.

1828
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:33,680
Hello.

1829
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:34,600
We all know that one.

1830
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:38,120
Um, Attica by Harmonix, pretty good.

1831
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:41,080
I liked that one a lot too, and there's plenty of others as well.

1832
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:46,080
So it is interesting, which unfortunately, I love tangent.

1833
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:52,480
Having done this show for 18 years, we see Konami do this too often, right?

1834
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:54,840
Like in case in point, Rock Revolution.

1835
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:58,160
Oh, everybody else did the thing with the music game.

1836
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,640
Guess we should finally show up to the party.

1837
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:02,960
How fucking long has Beat Saber been out?

1838
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:06,280
And just now Konami, oh, we're here.

1839
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:07,800
Here's our product.

1840
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:09,720
So Beat Arena is out.

1841
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:10,840
But you know what?

1842
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:14,880
Because Konami has its fans, because it is a Japanese made game.

1843
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:18,680
And because of the fact it, it doesn't look like it's necessarily like a total,

1844
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:21,800
like you're like in a band type of thing.

1845
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:23,440
It doesn't look like it's just Beat Saber.

1846
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:26,000
Like it does look like it's a little different and stuff.

1847
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,560
You have like the notes that are flying at you.

1848
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:31,600
And sometimes with the drums, it looks like you're hitting certain things.

1849
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:34,440
So, but it does have a different style.

1850
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:35,840
So I will give them that.

1851
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:42,240
Like Rock Revolution was just like a knockoff of rock band success, even though,

1852
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:47,760
yes, I completely realized and I will be the first to say Konami got to that table

1853
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:50,680
first with Guitar Freaks and Drummania.

1854
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:51,680
I almost said Guitar Hero.

1855
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,600
Guitar Freaks and Drummania.

1856
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:57,040
But they, they didn't do anything with it in the US.

1857
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:59,240
And that was a missed opportunity, wasn't it?

1858
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:02,400
And they, they, they fought to catch up for you.

1859
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:05,640
They lost their own game because of it.

1860
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:11,120
Anyway, so, so Beat Arena is now them entering the VR space.

1861
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:12,680
I will say it does look kind of neat.

1862
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:15,320
It is something I would enjoy to try out at some point.

1863
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:19,280
You do get to pick guitar, bass, drums, or keyboards.

1864
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:19,800
It is interesting.

1865
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:23,280
It does kind of take that rock band thing, but it puts it in a VR space, which

1866
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:24,160
is a little bit different.

1867
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:27,880
And of course there are transplant songs from other Bimani titles.

1868
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:28,760
So that's pretty cool.

1869
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:33,760
So anyway, Oculus and Oculus Quest 2, it came out on March 12th.

1870
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:34,520
So it's already out.

1871
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:35,720
Maybe some of you have played it.

1872
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:36,800
I'll check the chat in a minute.

1873
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:37,840
See if any of you have comments.

1874
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:40,920
Uh, Japanese and English, both available.

1875
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:41,880
So that's pretty cool.

1876
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:45,920
Um, right now though, they're saying it's only coming out in Japan and Asia.

1877
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:48,960
They haven't said anything about a North American release.

1878
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:52,760
I don't know why you would have English and then not.

1879
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:56,240
But I, Konami does weird shit.

1880
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:56,880
What can I say?

1881
01:41:58,240 --> 01:41:58,600
All right.

1882
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:01,200
Anyhow, so that is Beat Arena.

1883
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:05,680
And it's, it's nice to see Konami still doing Bimani home versions.

1884
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:09,440
You want to go back to the earlier thing about, you know, the fan

1885
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:13,560
wank idea of Sony doing more versions of Konami IPs.

1886
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:17,520
You know, Konami or, uh, Sony's got a pretty good VR thing too.

1887
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:22,600
They could do a version of this, but I doubt it'll happen.

1888
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:23,760
All right.

1889
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:30,800
Anyway, SSJ100Matt in chat says, Jason Enos could only do so much.

1890
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,320
Konami didn't want to take that in that step.

1891
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:33,960
Oh, I don't fault him.

1892
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:35,760
I don't follow anybody in America.

1893
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:38,760
He tried, he tried very hard.

1894
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:40,800
He has, he was never the problem.

1895
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:45,320
Nor was, um, there was a guy in Hawaii still wind.

1896
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:49,120
There was a huge, and unfortunately he passed away some time ago, but, uh, he

1897
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:53,800
was, he was a big reason why the ultra mix soundtracks on Xbox were so fucking

1898
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:59,920
good was because of him and the risks he took with the series, they don't know

1899
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:02,600
that word risk at Konami Japan, unfortunately.

1900
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:08,680
At least they didn't a long time ago in the, I, well, I would say they

1901
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:09,960
probably still don't know it, honestly.

1902
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:10,680
All right.

1903
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:12,120
Anyway.

1904
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:14,200
Um, let's move on.

1905
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:15,720
Let's go to a simpler time.

1906
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:19,280
We're going to go, we're going to go back to a time when VR didn't exist.

1907
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:20,360
You know what existed?

1908
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:22,800
Bits and polygons.

1909
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:25,200
It's the classic game of the week.

1910
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:26,720
Early polygons.

1911
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:27,000
Yes.

1912
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:30,760
Early, early polygons for this week's title, which again, Dark Soccer, you're

1913
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:33,600
so good at this, you picked a title where I'm like, how?

1914
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:36,480
How has this never been a classic game?

1915
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:37,320
How?

1916
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,440
I asked myself the same thing.

1917
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:39,920
I know.

1918
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:40,280
I know.

1919
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:40,960
So here you go.

1920
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:42,000
Got you watch.

1921
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:42,640
Ready?

1922
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:43,080
Chat.

1923
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:45,480
We're about to watch chat light up.

1924
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:47,720
How, what, what this has never been picked before.

1925
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:48,960
Here it is a classic game of the week.

1926
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:51,560
Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she

1927
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:55,880
thinks, Hey, you guys should, uh, show a little, put some respect on this title.

1928
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:57,520
And, uh, it's a good one tonight.

1929
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:58,120
Dark Soccer.

1930
01:43:58,120 --> 01:43:59,320
What is the classic game of the week?

1931
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:03,480
The classic game of the week is Ridge Racer.

1932
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:05,880
So yeah.

1933
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:07,520
How have I not done Ridge Racer?

1934
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:10,840
I actually was thinking, Oh, I'll do R4.

1935
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:13,320
I've done Ridge Racer before, so I'll do R4.

1936
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:16,200
No, I haven't done Ridge Racer.

1937
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:19,480
So how can I do R4 if I haven't done Ridge Racer?

1938
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:27,440
So, um, Ridge Racer came out in 1993 in Japan and North America and 94 in Europe.

1939
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:31,120
Um, it is a, uh, racing video game.

1940
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:36,160
It was published by Namco and it was on the Namco system, 22 arcade system board

1941
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:38,920
and ported to PlayStation in 1994.

1942
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,160
And it is the first in the series.

1943
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:48,280
Um, and basically as a game, you just have to get first place, you know, you even

1944
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:50,880
have like your qualifying, I think this one didn't have the qualifying lap.

1945
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:51,960
I'll have to double check again.

1946
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:56,840
But anyway, um, one little notable thing is that the PlayStation version

1947
01:44:56,920 --> 01:45:01,680
let you use the Nejicon, which I love playing games with freaking Nejicon.

1948
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:07,240
Um, so at any rate, uh, it took eight months to develop.

1949
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:15,440
Um, and, uh, the game is actually, uh, inspired by a, uh, a trend

1950
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:17,800
amongst Japanese car enthusiasts.

1951
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:21,040
Um, and of course, uh, with the PlayStation one, it was a

1952
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:22,760
launch title for the PlayStation.

1953
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:29,840
Um, it was also re-released, uh, in PlayStation, the best in 97 and, uh,

1954
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:33,720
the greatest hits and platinum one for North America and PAL respectively.

1955
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:41,640
And it really was, I think one of the games that gave it, uh, an edge over

1956
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:45,240
the Saturn, at least in the U S also, of course, with how terribly the Saturn

1957
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:51,160
was handled for U S marketing, there is that, um, not honestly, keep in mind,

1958
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:57,160
I worked at an arcade that we had both of those and I would almost always play

1959
01:45:57,200 --> 01:46:03,320
Ridge Racer over Daytona because I got really tired of the splash for Daytona.

1960
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:04,360
Anyway.

1961
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:12,480
Um, it, it, it was, I'd say a pretty significant game also in the racing game

1962
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:19,040
genre, um, just because of what it's led to, I mean, I'll get into some of that

1963
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:23,880
down the line, but anyway, for gameplay, you choose a course, you choose a car,

1964
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:28,800
you choose a transmission, it's either automatic or six speed, uh, six speed

1965
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,080
manual, and you choose a song.

1966
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:33,880
So, um, some of the cars have a good top speed.

1967
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:35,840
Others have greater acceleration or turning.

1968
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,200
Some are balanced.

1969
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:42,240
Um, and then the car, some of the cars are named after different Namco games,

1970
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:48,440
like Silverlou, Mappy, Bosconian, uh, Nebulas Ray and Xevious.

1971
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:55,200
So you can play in first person perspective, um, or on the PlayStation

1972
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,160
one, you can do a third person perspective.

1973
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:02,440
Um, like I said, you can use the Nejicon on the, uh, the PlayStation.

1974
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:04,520
And here I am doing like the Nejicon motion.

1975
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:10,320
Um, and so, uh, there's, uh, no damage from collisions.

1976
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:11,520
They just slow you down a little bit.

1977
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:12,640
There's a time limit.

1978
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:13,840
You have to hit your checkpoints.

1979
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:20,480
Um, so each course, uh, has four configurations of difficulty, novice,

1980
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:22,800
intermediate, advanced, and trial.

1981
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:30,960
Um, you, uh, you have, uh, 11 opponents except in the time trial

1982
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:34,440
where you have only one, the greater the difficulty, the faster the cars.

1983
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:36,200
And of course, time trial is the fastest.

1984
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:40,760
Um, each race has three laps or two on the beginner course.

1985
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:46,240
And when the race is won, you win the reversible course, um, and then

1986
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:50,800
additional, uh, opponent in the time trial, the 13th racing, also known

1987
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:52,920
as the devil car, the fastest car.

1988
01:47:53,800 --> 01:48:00,480
Um, and, uh, you get like, um, you also have on the PlayStation, a

1989
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:04,400
mini version of Galaxian that you can play, uh, as the game loads.

1990
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:10,440
Um, if, if you win the game, then you get eight additional cars, the

1991
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:13,360
little game of Galaxian, and then eight additional cars are available.

1992
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:19,760
And then, um, but you also though lose extra tracks.

1993
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:21,160
You can only play six music tracks.

1994
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:24,040
It's kind, it's kind of interesting.

1995
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:28,560
The, the, uh, the game is actually mostly loaded into system memory.

1996
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:31,800
You know, so sorry, just, I don't mean to interrupt, but

1997
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:33,200
it came up a couple of weeks ago.

1998
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:35,280
I think a lot on Bobby's show and we brought it up too.

1999
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:39,560
It's interesting that that whole Galaxian loading mini game thing is like a patented

2000
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:41,240
thing that Namco had for a long time.

2001
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:44,440
I think their patent finally expired on it, but I thought that was kind of

2002
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:47,280
interesting that like, that's why you didn't really see that outside of

2003
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:50,080
Namco games is that games within the game on the loading screen.

2004
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:51,120
This was that patent.

2005
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:52,360
Yeah.

2006
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:57,400
I mean, it's not clearly, this is not the only game that they've done that in.

2007
01:48:57,400 --> 01:49:05,480
I mean, so, um, at, uh, the JAMA 1992 amusement, amusement machine show,

2008
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:08,680
that's a Japan amusement machinery manufacturers association.

2009
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:15,160
Um, in 1992, Namco actually debuted a game called SIM drive.

2010
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:20,640
Um, that was also for the system 22, um, arcade board.

2011
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:25,800
Um, it was a sequel to Eunice roadster driving simulator with the Mazda MX-5.

2012
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:27,360
Um, that was the simulation game.

2013
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:32,080
Um, but they did it in, um, in 3d.

2014
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:36,040
They stood out for the Goron shading and texture mapping.

2015
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:39,440
Um, and it was very positively reviewed.

2016
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:42,080
Um, but it didn't get a mass market release.

2017
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:46,240
It had a limited release in Japan and it pretty much is the prototype for Ridge racer.

2018
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:55,560
Um, so basically the development team was sort of, uh, under this title

2019
01:49:55,600 --> 01:50:00,520
time limit to complete their game before their rivals, um, quote, the

2020
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:02,600
other company was in the same position.

2021
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:08,080
Um, and it was supposed to be an F1 racing game, but then they, they took

2022
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:14,080
it to talking about the mountain roads and the drifting and all of that,

2023
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:17,760
which was, uh, you know, basically a big trend still, I think to this

2024
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:19,840
day for Japanese car enthusiasts.

2025
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:25,240
Um, so they had a game that would let you test different skills and

2026
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:29,120
experience different speeds and master your drifting.

2027
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:34,440
Um, and they weren't really worried that it wouldn't be received outside of Japan.

2028
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:39,080
Uh, they were pretty sure that it was going to be a success everywhere.

2029
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:48,840
So, um, they basically, instead of choosing cars that were already to be done, uh,

2030
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:51,360
they tried to make their own specific cars.

2031
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:55,880
Um, they really liked using the Nejicon for the PlayStation, because it would

2032
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:58,080
give you tighter control over your vehicle.

2033
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:02,280
Uh, they were concerned about loading times for the CD, uh, ROM, but then

2034
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:05,800
they fixed that by having it loaded into the PlayStation memories.

2035
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:08,600
And that's where the Galaxian play come through.

2036
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:18,320
Um, and, uh, the, uh, the designer Sakagami, he included Galaxian because

2037
01:51:18,360 --> 01:51:24,000
he was also part of the Galaxian arcade team and wanted to honor his previous boss.

2038
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:31,760
So, um, and then of course the, uh, the 13th, uh, 13th racing, that car,

2039
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:36,560
um, was supposed to be a black car that no one had ever driven before.

2040
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:38,640
And its nickname was the cockroach.

2041
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:47,720
So, um, moving forward, uh, with that also, um, arcade system board, uh,

2042
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:51,440
Ridge Racer was considered to be the, well, according to Namco, the

2043
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:53,280
most realistic driving game ever.

2044
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:58,920
Um, it was, it was very, very well received.

2045
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:04,320
Um, now in particular, this is a little anecdote.

2046
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:10,920
I had to retest for my driver's license after I had, uh, graduated high school

2047
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:15,720
because I had something limiting me from being able to renew it at the time.

2048
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:20,280
And honestly, it was Ridge Racer that I did some practice with.

2049
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:26,760
Um, you know, I was more practicing on, you know, just braking and going and,

2050
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:32,040
you know, and so actually I can, I can attribute a lot of things to Ridge Racer.

2051
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:35,600
Actually I can, I can attribute a little bit of Ridge Racer

2052
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:37,800
to passing my driving exam.

2053
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:39,400
Wow.

2054
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:43,920
I would think that that's not a great thing to do, but wow.

2055
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:45,080
You know, it's weird.

2056
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:47,040
What works for people it's different sometimes.

2057
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,240
Well, this is the game that taught me how to slow down when I'm turning a corner.

2058
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:53,160
True.

2059
01:52:54,000 --> 01:53:01,080
You know, and the, the physics in it, weren't really that bad at all.

2060
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:05,560
I'd even say they had some pretty, uh, pretty good physics in the game.

2061
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:07,640
I'm going to the music now.

2062
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:15,640
Um, it was produced by, uh, um, Shinji Hosoe, um, with also contributions

2063
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:18,080
from Nobuyoshi Sano and Ayako Saso.

2064
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:24,720
Um, but they didn't have enough time to produce the tracks independently.

2065
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:31,480
Um, but they ended up producing kind of that, that sort of fast paced

2066
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:36,320
electronica and they wanted it to convey a fun feeling while they play.

2067
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:40,760
And then, um, you know, they wanted to put energy or speed into it.

2068
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:46,560
So, um, the soundtrack actually ended up being, uh, released as part of Namco

2069
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:50,480
games, sound express volume 11 by Victor entertainment, and it has

2070
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:52,160
remixes of all of those themes in it.

2071
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:55,880
So, yeah, like I said, this was very, very well received.

2072
01:53:56,320 --> 01:54:02,760
Um, the Japanese, uh, magazine game machine listed it, uh, as, uh, uh,

2073
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:07,920
as their most successful upright arcade game of the year in December, 1993.

2074
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:14,480
Um, it was, I mean, all across the board, it was just lauded.

2075
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:18,680
Um, GamePro said the PlayStation version was quote, a mere carbon copy of the

2076
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:23,480
original, um, um, they thought it was brilliant loading it into the Ram,

2077
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:26,440
instead of having all these loading screens, you know, trying to

2078
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:27,640
load the next track or whatnot.

2079
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:33,760
Um, it, uh, EGM was really fond of the gameplay and the music.

2080
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:40,920
Um, you know, they said that there were some, uh, some downsides, like there are

2081
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:45,560
only, uh, this is from Maxima magazine, um, that there was only one track and it

2082
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:50,680
lacked the, uh, crash sequences from Daytona and, but the quote on here, but

2083
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:57,240
everything else in the title is sheer class, um, very smooth, very, very well

2084
01:54:57,240 --> 01:55:04,160
playing, um, so looking over, uh, their aggregate score from gang rank, uh,

2085
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:13,240
gang rankings, they, uh, the PlayStation version had an 81% overall, um, and, uh,

2086
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:17,120
EGM gave it best driving game, uh, in 1995.

2087
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:24,040
So, um, let's talk about a little bit of what's become of Ridge Racers.

2088
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:29,760
So it actually was listed as one of the best games of all time by Game Informer

2089
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:37,080
in 2001 and by Yahoo in 2005 and EGM in 2006, uh, and the Guinness book

2090
01:55:37,080 --> 01:55:39,520
of world records in 2008 and 2009.

2091
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:43,560
So that's pretty notable.

2092
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:49,800
Um, and of course there were many sequels, uh, there were also different

2093
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:59,440
kinds of other releases for the first Ridge Racer, um, it, there were, um,

2094
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:06,200
there was Ridge Racer full scale, which I have seen one of, and I

2095
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:07,680
do not remember where I saw it.

2096
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:17,000
Um, it was basically in, uh, the adapted Eunos Roadster.

2097
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:20,120
You, and a passenger could sit with you in the car.

2098
01:56:20,120 --> 01:56:24,200
It's a Japanese right hand drive version of a Mazda MX-5.

2099
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:29,200
Um, and then you have the wheel, the shift, you have the pedals for your

2100
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:33,320
controls, and then you use an ignition speed to start the gauges were all

2101
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:37,520
functional and these fans fans would blow, uh, air past you.

2102
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:43,240
Um, real, realistic engine sounds, uh, and overhead speakers will play the music.

2103
01:56:43,240 --> 01:56:47,760
The PCB was under the, uh, the hood of the car.

2104
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:55,880
Um, there was also, um, uh, Ridge Racer three screen edition, which is

2105
01:56:55,880 --> 01:56:59,560
also one I've seen a couple of times use multiple system, 22 boards.

2106
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:03,440
Um, and so it was the game that gave you peripheral vision.

2107
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,280
Um, then it was pocket racer, which is an SD version.

2108
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:10,520
Uh, the cars kind of resemble the core OQ models.

2109
01:57:11,200 --> 01:57:15,040
Um, and it was only available in an upright cabinet version

2110
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:16,520
and use Namco system 11.

2111
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:18,000
It was actually released for children.

2112
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:22,600
Um, they actually included something very similar to it in Ridge Racer

2113
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:27,120
revolution, um, using those same cars under the name, pretty racer.

2114
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:29,080
Uh, also known as buggy mode.

2115
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:32,680
It was, uh, Ridge Racer turbo.

2116
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:39,720
Um, basically it was included in R4, which is the best Ridge Racer game ever.

2117
01:57:40,240 --> 01:57:45,440
Um, and, uh, it had an extra disc with it that contained a version of Ridge

2118
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:50,880
Racer called Ridge Racers turbo in North America Ridge Racer high spec demo in

2119
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:57,360
Europe, um, and, uh, in Japan, it was also called Ridge Racer high spec version.

2120
01:57:58,040 --> 01:58:02,640
Um, it had improved graphics, ran 60 frames per second or 50 in PAL.

2121
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:07,600
Um, as opposed to the original 30, I had vibration feedback and would let you use

2122
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:12,400
the, um, cause you know, R4 came with the jog con if you got that bundle.

2123
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:20,040
Um, you, uh, you have, uh, the white angel from Ridge Racer revolution in it.

2124
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:22,640
In addition to 13th racing as an unlockable car.

2125
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:29,160
Um, and you have, uh, a time attack mode where you have, uh, you just beat your

2126
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:34,200
time with no opponent cars where time trials does have, uh, uh, another car.

2127
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:36,240
Then there's the mobile versions.

2128
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:42,680
So, um, there were mobile phone versions released and, uh, criticized

2129
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:47,240
as being easy to master, but pretty impressive for what it was.

2130
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:54,120
Um, and then there was, uh, in 2005, there was Ridge Racer 3D for mobile phones.

2131
01:58:54,640 --> 01:58:58,440
Um, and then of course, yeah.

2132
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:03,920
And then of course there was Ridge Racer 3D for the 3DS, but I want to say that

2133
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:06,320
that was actually a different game.

2134
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:11,000
Yeah, it was a different game, had a lot more modes.

2135
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:18,840
Um, and, uh, actually that version was, uh, ported to the Zeebo.

2136
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:24,200
You have, have you heard of the Zeebo?

2137
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:29,840
Um, the name sounds familiar, but I'm, I can't, I'm trying to picture it and I can't.

2138
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:36,280
It was targeted mostly to Brazil and Mexico, um, as a, an interactive,

2139
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:39,880
uh, entertainment and education device.

2140
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:40,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2141
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:42,240
Yeah.

2142
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:45,760
So, um, but yeah, there was a version of Ridge Racer on that.

2143
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:49,960
But there hasn't been one in a long time and that's kind of sad.

2144
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:51,680
Yeah.

2145
01:59:52,120 --> 01:59:56,480
And, uh, at DEFT, it's called the Zeebo, Z-E-E-E-O.

2146
01:59:56,800 --> 02:00:02,840
It was in 2009 that they tried to release it or that they did release the game.

2147
02:00:05,320 --> 02:00:05,760
All right.

2148
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:14,400
So, um, so yeah, uh, anyway, Ridge Racer, that's the one, uh, and now

2149
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:17,240
I have the, the opening song from R4.

2150
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:23,560
I mean, cause now it's also given us like one of our notable, um, uh,

2151
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:33,000
mascots, um, uh, Reiko, who's become a, uh, you know, a definite, uh, face

2152
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:40,240
for the, you know, the various, uh, uh, racing, uh, for the various, uh,

2153
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:44,080
gosh, why can't I say the words for various Ridge Racer games?

2154
02:00:44,120 --> 02:00:44,360
Yeah.

2155
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:54,000
So, um, you know, and honestly, it's so funny, like someone actually

2156
02:00:54,000 --> 02:01:00,160
redid the R4 opening and, uh, it doesn't quite look right.

2157
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:03,600
Um, they tried to, you know, make it a little bit more upscale.

2158
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:10,840
Um, but, uh, like for just a moment though, I'm trying to remember her

2159
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:14,640
family name and I, my brain is blanking.

2160
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:15,400
That's all right.

2161
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:17,400
All right.

2162
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,760
Nagase.

2163
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:21,440
All right.

2164
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:26,360
We should use the virtual idol and she's actually, um, been

2165
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:28,400
used now in other things too.

2166
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:31,360
So, and she has a sister in another game.

2167
02:01:33,680 --> 02:01:35,480
The whole big Namco family.

2168
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:42,040
Yeah, she was used in, um, Anna Kournikova, smash court tennis and

2169
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:48,400
professional baseball Famitsu, uh, Famista and Fantasia, Nari-kiri

2170
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:50,240
Dungeon, Taiko no Tatsujin V.

2171
02:01:50,240 --> 02:01:54,480
She's a summon character or five, I should say, or V version, whatever.

2172
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:55,120
Anyway.

2173
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:56,240
All right.

2174
02:01:56,920 --> 02:01:57,560
Well, there it is.

2175
02:01:57,600 --> 02:02:02,280
Your classic game of the week Ridge Racer, which again, I don't know how

2176
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:05,160
we've never talked about Ridge Racer on this show before, I mean, we've

2177
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:08,480
talked about Ridge Racer, but not in the segment meant to talk about

2178
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:12,880
great classic games, so I'm glad we took care of that on Pi Day.

2179
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:17,920
So, uh, looking at chat over twitch.tv slash vlog network, DJ Rama S says,

2180
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:19,320
now I want to play Ridge Racer.

2181
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:20,240
Well, you, you know what?

2182
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:21,440
That's a good way to spend Pi Day.

2183
02:02:22,240 --> 02:02:23,640
Have some Pi, play some Ridge Racer.

2184
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,720
We still have our copy of Ridge Racer.

2185
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:27,280
All right.

2186
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:31,160
We're going to, uh, travel around and check out some rapid fire news.

2187
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:34,240
Now, just a couple of quick headlines for you guys, starting with Loki.

2188
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:35,840
Yes.

2189
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:39,000
So we've been talking for a few weeks on how super Nintendo

2190
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,440
world has been delayed in Japan.

2191
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:44,480
Well, now it's going to be opening March 18th.

2192
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:45,000
That's right.

2193
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:50,200
This week in Japan, it will be open of course, with, um, you know, certain

2194
02:02:50,200 --> 02:02:54,840
guidelines, they're just, you know, trying to stay safe, but, uh, it is

2195
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:57,960
finally open, so that's, that's exciting.

2196
02:02:58,680 --> 02:03:01,400
Um, uh, just a quick related tangent.

2197
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:02,480
Cause I love those tonight.

2198
02:03:02,720 --> 02:03:06,280
Uh, Aria snark over from shaking and crying was actually at universal

2199
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:12,520
studios, uh, yesterday, I think the one in, um, uh, I almost said Anaheim.

2200
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:13,080
That's not true.

2201
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:13,920
Actual Hollywood.

2202
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:15,200
So universal studios, Hollywood.

2203
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:18,280
Um, and she went in a, I thought this was very clever.

2204
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:21,640
She went in a Bellatrix, uh, cosplay that had a mask.

2205
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,360
So she actually had like a mass of tied in and she looked great.

2206
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:27,960
Um, but anyway, uh, she said the point, oh, she's very crafty.

2207
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:33,320
She sent a picture of, so she texted me a picture of Nintendo world in

2208
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:35,800
progress at universal studios, Hollywood.

2209
02:03:35,800 --> 02:03:38,520
And you can see they have some of the green like scenery stuff up.

2210
02:03:38,760 --> 02:03:41,800
It's it's down in the lower lot area for those that have been there.

2211
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,120
I, when I sent the picture, I was like, isn't that right where the

2212
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:48,240
transformers ride is, but I guess my sense of direction is off, but you

2213
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:51,680
can see like right in the foreground, the, I guess now Jurassic world ride.

2214
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:53,160
Last time I was on, it was Jurassic park.

2215
02:03:53,400 --> 02:03:54,000
Is right there.

2216
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,240
And then the Nintendo land looks like it's just a couple of steps past that.

2217
02:03:57,480 --> 02:03:59,920
So it's interesting kind of seeing the construction on that.

2218
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:04,440
So I assume Hollywood's probably going to be next, uh, whenever they get around to it.

2219
02:04:04,440 --> 02:04:05,760
It might beat Orlando to it.

2220
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:09,240
Yeah, I think it's maybe next year.

2221
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:11,560
Yeah, maybe later this year.

2222
02:04:11,560 --> 02:04:12,040
Who knows?

2223
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:15,400
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says super Nintendo world has been open for a while though.

2224
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:21,960
Uh, they, they, um, they, uh, they had, uh, the, the press tour and they had

2225
02:04:22,920 --> 02:04:25,520
those events like where Miyamoto was going through it and they had a couple

2226
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:30,120
of press events, but they had to delay the official opening because

2227
02:04:30,120 --> 02:04:31,880
the COVID numbers went back up.

2228
02:04:32,040 --> 02:04:34,960
I don't know if they did a soft opening or something, but this is

2229
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:36,800
now the official official opening.

2230
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,480
Um, but they, they had to delay it again.

2231
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:40,160
Cause COVID started going back up in Japan.

2232
02:04:41,800 --> 02:04:42,200
All right.

2233
02:04:43,360 --> 02:04:44,000
Uh, yeah.

2234
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,480
And a couple of people in chatter saying, uh, super Nintendo

2235
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:49,040
world Orlando is slated for 2025.

2236
02:04:49,240 --> 02:04:49,480
Yeah.

2237
02:04:49,480 --> 02:04:52,520
I thought theirs was going to, it's, it's this weird thing where Hollywood's

2238
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:55,240
actually going to get it before Orlando, which doesn't usually happen.

2239
02:04:55,240 --> 02:04:56,360
So hooray, I guess.

2240
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:57,280
All right.

2241
02:04:57,280 --> 02:05:01,080
And speaking of, speaking of delays though, uh, we have the next expansion

2242
02:05:01,080 --> 02:05:07,720
to Borderlands three has now been delayed to April 8th and that's, uh, thankfully,

2243
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:12,200
well, I should say you can thank that, uh, Texas snow storm for that.

2244
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:18,360
Um, because of all the outages that they've had to, um, endure there.

2245
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:19,720
So that's put them behind.

2246
02:05:19,880 --> 02:05:20,400
Okay.

2247
02:05:20,440 --> 02:05:25,040
But that's understandable, you know, as opposed to, uh, what we talked about

2248
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:28,600
earlier, an actual, that's what a normal gaming company, like, sorry,

2249
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:30,040
our product's gonna take longer or not.

2250
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:32,840
You got to come in and, uh, hope you don't die on the way here.

2251
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:34,520
Yeah, much better.

2252
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:35,400
All right.

2253
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:35,840
Dark soccer.

2254
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:36,240
How about you?

2255
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:43,160
Way yell, um, crash bandicoot four it's about time is coming, uh, to

2256
02:05:43,160 --> 02:05:45,920
the PC in a couple of weeks.

2257
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:51,720
Um, it was on PS five X-Box series, uh, X S and switch

2258
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:54,200
actually came out, uh, on the 12th.

2259
02:05:54,760 --> 02:05:58,240
Um, but it's coming to battle on it on March 26th.

2260
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:02,800
So if you like crash, good for you, you can play it on your PC.

2261
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:09,840
And then super Mario three D world, uh, Bowser's fury is considered the best

2262
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:14,920
selling game during February, 2021 and kept the switch on top of everything.

2263
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:20,000
So yes, Mario games sell, uh, sell their hardware sales increased.

2264
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:25,840
Um, 121% um, over the year.

2265
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:29,760
So they're up to 406 million dollars.

2266
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:31,400
Wow.

2267
02:06:32,120 --> 02:06:32,480
Yeah.

2268
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:36,200
I mean, that's the one thing that goes against a switch pro.

2269
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:38,240
Why do they need a switch pro?

2270
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:39,960
The one they got still selling.

2271
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:44,280
Yes, but you know, the moment a switch pro comes out, they're going

2272
02:06:44,280 --> 02:06:45,600
to be selling even more of them.

2273
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:45,920
Yeah.

2274
02:06:45,960 --> 02:06:49,040
But I'm like, you know, I was talking about with bravely default two earlier,

2275
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:52,080
and I'm sure a lot of these other games that are coming, it's just like the

2276
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:55,880
switch is getting to a point where it can't handle or the game makers want to go.

2277
02:06:55,920 --> 02:07:00,440
So I really hope the switch pro is in the cards for that reason, because, you

2278
02:07:00,440 --> 02:07:03,800
know, the switch might be hot right now, but without the games to keep it going,

2279
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:05,920
it's going to, uh, going to falter off.

2280
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:08,480
But of course we all know breath of the wild too is going to happen at some point.

2281
02:07:08,480 --> 02:07:11,520
You know, Nintendo has some aces up their sleeve for sure.

2282
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:11,960
For sure.

2283
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:13,800
I can't wait for breath of the wild too.

2284
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:15,240
Oh, I get in line.

2285
02:07:16,120 --> 02:07:19,560
I want there to be more korok hunting so you can keep collecting their poop.

2286
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:21,360
All right.

2287
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:23,000
Uh, let's move on.

2288
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:27,960

2317
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,600
is also out in Japan this week.

2318
02:09:37,600 --> 02:09:42,400
We also have Maglam Lord, uh, and then go by train hashiro.

2319
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:46,400
Yamanote lean, uh, is out this week, by the way, speaking of train games.

2320
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:48,320
Wait, what?

2321
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:51,600
Go by train hashiro.

2322
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:52,240
Yama note.

2323
02:09:52,240 --> 02:09:52,640
I'm sorry.

2324
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:53,680
I misread the word line.

2325
02:09:53,680 --> 02:09:54,800
It's just line.

2326
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:57,840
Um, Yamanote.

2327
02:09:57,840 --> 02:09:58,340
Uh huh.

2328
02:09:59,200 --> 02:09:59,680
Okay.

2329
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:00,400
Okay.

2330
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:05,760
So anyway, um, so the train game in Japan, um, I, I said, why don't they

2331
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:06,960
ever bring those over here?

2332
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:11,280
They, that a train game I talked about last week, they are bringing over here.

2333
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:12,320
Just a heads up.

2334
02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:15,840
I, it surprised me too, but they are bringing out an English version of that

2335
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:16,320
over here.

2336
02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:19,280
I can't remember if it already came out or if it's coming out, but, uh, I

2337
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:22,160
thought that was important to follow up with is that they are experimenting

2338
02:10:22,160 --> 02:10:23,520
and bringing some more of those games over here.

2339
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:24,320
And I think that's kind of neat.

2340
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:28,800
Uh, anyway, sorry, uh, distracted, but, um, that's happened to me a lot tonight.

2341
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:33,920
Also out on the switch, uh, apex legends in Japan gets its switch release.

2342
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:35,200
So check that out.

2343
02:10:35,200 --> 02:10:41,840
Um, and then going over to the PlayStation, of course, I closed my list

2344
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:42,160
here.

2345
02:10:42,160 --> 02:10:45,040
So, um, dark soccer, why don't we go over to the UK real quick and then

2346
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:45,600
we'll come back.

2347
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:46,880
Okay.

2348
02:10:47,440 --> 02:10:53,600
So on the 16th, uh, for switch kingdoms of Amalur re reckoning on the 18th, we

2349
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:58,560
have Marvel's Avengers for PlayStation hunting simulator two for PlayStation

2350
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:02,880
on the 19th, we have plants versus zombies battle for the neighborville

2351
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:04,720
complete edition on switch.

2352
02:11:05,280 --> 02:11:08,880
Also on switches, Hades limited edition on PlayStation.

2353
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:11,680
We have can't drive this now.

2354
02:11:11,680 --> 02:11:12,240
Now can't touch.

2355
02:11:12,240 --> 02:11:14,720
This is going through my head on the 19th.

2356
02:11:14,720 --> 02:11:17,280
We have for switching PlayStation root film.

2357
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:22,080
Um, also in the 19th, bow Babs mausoleum on switch.

02:11:22,080 --> 02:11:23,280
And that is it.

2359

Okay.

2360
02:11:24,240 --> 02:11:26,000
And I'm back on track to finish Japan.

2361
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:26,480
Sorry about that.

2362
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:27,360
Screw up on my part.

2363
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:32,640
Uh, for the PlayStation five, we have, uh, Tom Clancy's rainbow six siege gets

2364
02:11:32,640 --> 02:11:34,240
its Japanese version this week.

2365
02:11:34,240 --> 02:11:38,000
That's again on the PlayStation five and on the PlayStation four, that Maglam

2366
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:41,760
Lord game is also coming out, uh, this week on the 18th.

2367
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:44,080
So those are the Japanese releases.

2368
02:11:44,080 --> 02:11:44,720
All right.

2369
02:11:44,720 --> 02:11:46,560
Let's get to some more stories.

2370
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:46,960
Loki.

2371
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:50,720
All right.

2372
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:56,000
Uh, so this is very interesting, I should say.

2373
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:01,280
So already like I FIFA ultimate team's been kind of shady as it is, you know,

2374
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:05,040
with the whole loot box scenario with that, but now EA is actually

2375
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:10,320
investigating claims that an employee has been selling rare items.

2376
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:15,840
So being that they're working for the company, they got access to special

2377
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:19,520
items that they're then pawning off, uh, for large sums of money.

2378
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:27,600
So apparently this is coming from, um, you know, some, I don't know if it's

2379
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:31,200
like from forums or whatnot, but basically saying, you know, showing

2380
02:12:31,200 --> 02:12:33,520
that there's all these items that are up for sale.

2381
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:36,880
Like there's this, uh, post that was on Twitter saying, so we grind

2382
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:38,160
trade open packs.

2383
02:12:38,160 --> 02:12:42,800
We can't touch these PIM players, but EA employees sell them to people

2384
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:44,400
secretly for $1,700.

2385
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:46,080
LOL.

2386
02:12:46,080 --> 02:12:47,760
I respect the grind, but my God.

2387
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:56,400
So because this got, um, kind of exposed on social media under this EA

2388
02:12:56,400 --> 02:13:03,120
gate, um, hashtag these complaints that these different, um, FIFA icon or

2389
02:13:03,120 --> 02:13:07,520
prime icon moment players are there being sold for over a thousand dollars.

2390
02:13:08,320 --> 02:13:12,880
They're now doing some investigation to see doing that.

2391
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:16,000
And you know, how, how this is happening.

2392
02:13:16,080 --> 02:13:19,760
And of course, FIFA put out a statement saying that we want to be clear.

2393
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:21,440
This type of behavior is unacceptable.

2394
02:13:21,440 --> 02:13:25,520
And we, in no way could don't was alleged to have happened here.

2395
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:28,960
We understand how this can create concern of unfair balance in the gaming

2396
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:29,600
competition.

2397
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:36,320
Um, yeah, but it's also shitty that you're selling these things in the

2398
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:38,880
first place, but whatever.

2399
02:13:40,080 --> 02:13:43,600
I'm kind of surprised it took this long for a story like this to come out.

2400
02:13:43,600 --> 02:13:44,240
You know what I mean?

2401
02:13:45,200 --> 02:13:47,120
Uh, yeah, I completely agree.

2402
02:13:47,120 --> 02:13:52,960
I'm surprised that it's just now that we're seeing this, but I don't know.

2403
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:57,120
I mean, not, not that it's good news, but in this age of like digital goods

2404
02:13:57,120 --> 02:14:00,720
being worth so much, I'm just kind of surprised nobody's tried to take

2405
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:05,040
advantage of the system before, or at least I'm not recalling if it has

2406
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:06,240
happened before.

2407
02:14:06,240 --> 02:14:07,200
So interesting.

2408
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:09,600
Yeah.

2409
02:14:09,600 --> 02:14:10,160
All right.

2410
02:14:10,160 --> 02:14:11,680
So interesting.

2411
02:14:11,680 --> 02:14:15,360
Almost like that guy I heard on the news here that was stealing stuff out

2412
02:14:15,360 --> 02:14:18,080
of the Amazon warehouse while he was working there and then reselling it.

2413
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:22,480
Unfortunately, crime crime happens even in the digital space.

2414
02:14:22,480 --> 02:14:23,120
That's for sure.

2415
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:24,240
All right.

2416
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:28,720
Let's talk about Pokemon go since I talk about that game a lot, but this

2417
02:14:28,720 --> 02:14:32,000
is interesting because you have one of the biggest mobile games out there

2418
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,160
that's, uh, testing a pretty big change.

2419
02:14:34,160 --> 02:14:39,200
And that is being able to preview what might be in the eggs that you are

2420
02:14:39,200 --> 02:14:43,520
hatching because, uh, eggs are, I don't know, eggs are kind of like loot

2421
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:46,960
boxes, but they're also not because they, you know, eggs drop everywhere.

2422
02:14:48,160 --> 02:14:48,400
Yeah.

2423
02:14:48,400 --> 02:14:50,480
It's the incubators that cost money.

2424
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:54,960
And then you have to decide which you, although you do have the one, uh,

2425
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:58,160
infinite incubator, but you know, that's not enough for some people.

2426
02:14:58,160 --> 02:15:02,160
Cause of course the game lets you hold nine eggs, but one, one eternal

2427
02:15:02,160 --> 02:15:02,720
incubator.

2428
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:06,080
So if you want to have them all going at once, you got to buy some more or,

2429
02:15:06,080 --> 02:15:08,400
you know, sometimes they give away little freebies.

2430
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:11,920
You know, there's a lot of, a lot of if thens and so forth, but, um, there's

2431
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:15,680
been a call to really like be more transparent with the odds.

2432
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:16,800
Although a lot of.

2433
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:21,520
Like Reddit has the silph road Reddit, which is extremely helpful for

2434
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:23,040
players of Pokemon go.

2435
02:15:23,040 --> 02:15:26,320
Um, and they do these big tests where they have a lot of people report

2436
02:15:26,320 --> 02:15:28,560
numbers and they kind of figure it out.

2437
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:31,760
Like they figure out that like, this is the, this is the percentage of, uh,

2438
02:15:31,760 --> 02:15:35,200
what's in 5k eggs and this is what's in two case, but it looks like Niantic

2439
02:15:35,200 --> 02:15:36,640
is going to be a bit more transparent with that.

2440
02:15:36,640 --> 02:15:39,680
You won't have to wait for the silph road to do their experiments anymore.

2441
02:15:39,680 --> 02:15:45,600
So in some tweets, uh, from Niantic help, they have said that, uh, trainers

2442
02:15:45,600 --> 02:15:48,800
were excited to share that we're starting testing with a limited number

2443
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:52,960
of trainers who will be able to see which Pokemon may hatch from eggs in

2444
02:15:52,960 --> 02:15:54,400
their inventory.

2445
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:59,040
Um, it's not going to show you though, if a Pokemon is a shiny, it doesn't

2446
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:00,240
show you odds on that.

2447
02:16:00,240 --> 02:16:04,720
Sorry, Shane, but it does show you the odds on what might actually be in it,

2448
02:16:04,720 --> 02:16:08,320
but you know what it doesn't let you do and what needs to happen.

2449
02:16:08,320 --> 02:16:10,880
It doesn't let you send an egg to the shredder.

2450
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:13,200
That's been a big problem with the game.

2451
02:16:13,200 --> 02:16:16,080
If you have nine eggs and you don't want to hatch one of them, cause it

2452
02:16:16,080 --> 02:16:17,520
doesn't have what you want in it.

2453
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:20,960
You can't send it to the omelet factory or whatever you want to do with the

2454
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:21,280
egg.

2455
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:23,040
You can't get it to go.

2456
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:23,360
Oops.

2457
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:24,480
I dropped it on the ground.

2458
02:16:24,480 --> 02:16:25,520
No, you cracked open.

2459
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:26,720
No, you can't do that.

2460
02:16:26,720 --> 02:16:31,120
It's a, they, they did try to improve it a little bit where like the really

2461
02:16:31,120 --> 02:16:35,280
valuable eggs, the 12 K eggs and the ones that you get from adventure sync

2462
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:37,360
and stuff, they go to like a holding.

2463
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:40,800
They go to like an extra inventory where you can hold three more eggs, but

2464
02:16:40,800 --> 02:16:42,080
only those kinds of eggs.

2465
02:16:42,720 --> 02:16:44,880
It's, it's a little bit convoluted.

2466
02:16:44,880 --> 02:16:48,560
I just don't understand why you can't delete eggs, but it is what it is.

2467
02:16:48,560 --> 02:16:53,200
Um, anyway, uh, you will actually, apparently if you are in Germany or

2468
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:57,920
Belgium, you can actually, I'm sorry, Germany and Belgium pass the laws that

2469
02:16:57,920 --> 02:17:00,640
they are, uh, kind of responding to here.

2470
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:05,040
I don't know exactly where the trainers are that they can see these features

2471
02:17:05,040 --> 02:17:07,840
yet, but I'm sure it'll start to spread out more and more.

2472
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:11,040
A lot of this stuff usually gets tested in places like Australia.

2473
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:13,840
New Zealand is almost always Niantic's testing zone.

2474
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:15,040
Um, but we'll see.

2475
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:15,840
So.

2476
02:17:17,600 --> 02:17:24,480
Anyway, it should be noted that, uh, a Dutch court fined EA 10 million euros

2477
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:27,040
over FIFA ultimate team packs.

2478
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:31,120
And that, uh, was after a ban on loot boxes by the Dutch, uh, gambling

2479
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:32,960
authority in 2018.

2480
02:17:32,960 --> 02:17:39,040
So these, uh, loot boxes are, um, uh, maybe going to be regulated to a thing

2481
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:39,600
of the past.

2482
02:17:39,600 --> 02:17:40,240
We'll see.

2483
02:17:40,240 --> 02:17:43,680
And even though eggs aren't quite loot boxes, I just think Niantic doesn't

2484
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:44,960
want to get caught up in that.

2485
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:49,440
And honestly, people figure it out anyway, because it's self road.

2486
02:17:49,440 --> 02:17:50,960
So they might as well be transparent.

2487
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:55,440
Uh, Shane is in chat and says, I gave up on eggs to be honest.

2488
02:17:55,440 --> 02:17:57,120
They never end up worth it.

2489
02:17:57,120 --> 02:18:01,600
And they hype up like the Pokemon that make a 1% hatch chance every event.

2490
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:02,480
So why care?

2491
02:18:03,040 --> 02:18:06,560
You know, and that's maybe one reason they're also responding to it was that

2492
02:18:06,560 --> 02:18:11,280
whole issue with, was it denial or something that was in, uh, the eggs that

2493
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:13,120
like wasn't showing up.

2494
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:17,200
Even though his picture was all over the event and people were getting really

2495
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:17,760
frustrated.

2496
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:19,600
So maybe they're trying to be more transparent about that.

2497
02:18:19,600 --> 02:18:20,000
I don't know.

2498
02:18:20,560 --> 02:18:20,880
Anyway.

2499
02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:23,040
Um, let's see.

2500
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:28,320
Um, as 200, Matt says, sending Pokemon to the professor equals a nice farm up

2501
02:18:28,320 --> 02:18:30,000
state where they can be free.

2502
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:30,400
Nope.

2503
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:31,600
Poke blender.

2504
02:18:31,600 --> 02:18:33,840
Where do you think, where do you think your candy comes from?

2505
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:37,280
Uh, anyway, let's move on.

2506
02:18:37,280 --> 02:18:38,320
Uh, dark soccer.

2507
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:45,280
So, uh, a game that I've absolutely made no, no secret that I love.

2508
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:47,040
And I know that you love it too, Robin.

2509
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:48,560
Look, I don't know if you played it.

2510
02:18:48,560 --> 02:18:50,640
Um, was everybody's gone to the rapture.

2511
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:53,200
Well, um, I, I streamed it.

2512
02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:54,480
Oh, cool.

2513
02:18:54,480 --> 02:18:54,640
Yeah.

2514
02:18:54,640 --> 02:18:55,120
I remember that.

2515
02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:55,440
That's right.

2516
02:18:55,440 --> 02:18:55,760
That's right.

2517
02:18:56,640 --> 02:18:57,040
Yeah.

2518
02:18:57,040 --> 02:19:01,920
So it is basically a single player narrative game.

2519
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:09,760
Um, so, uh, the, uh, the designer, um, of the game, Andrew Crenshaw, uh, he

2520
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:14,080
was the lead designer for everybody's gone to the rapture is doing another

2521
02:19:14,080 --> 02:19:17,040
game called the magnificent truffle pigs.

2522
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:22,960
And you basically go through the British countryside, looking for buried

2523
02:19:23,440 --> 02:19:27,040
treasure with a metal detector and you dig around and the only other person

2524
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:30,400
you have to talk to is somebody on the other end of a walkie talkie.

2525
02:19:30,960 --> 02:19:36,800
Um, her name is Beth, uh, voiced by, uh, Lucy fish from safe house and another

2526
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:37,200
Eden.

2527
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:44,480
Um, but you, uh, but you have, you're trying to help her find things as well.

2528
02:19:44,880 --> 02:19:49,440
So it's definitely that narrative type of game.

2529
02:19:49,440 --> 02:19:54,880
Um, you know, they say it also has a little bit of, uh, a relation to fire

2530
02:19:54,880 --> 02:20:00,160
watch with just that, that calm aspect of it, the, the communicator aspect.

2531
02:20:00,160 --> 02:20:01,680
And I loved fire watch as well.

2532
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:02,640
Firewatch was great.

2533
02:20:03,440 --> 02:20:09,440
So, um, this is actually the first game being released for Crenshaw's, uh,

2534
02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:17,040
studio thunked T H U N K apostrophe D backed by AMC games, um, which is a

2535
02:20:17,040 --> 02:20:20,480
video game publisher, um, for AMC networks.

2536
02:20:21,360 --> 02:20:24,560
Is that unfortunately, I think the company that made everybody's gone to

2537
02:20:24,560 --> 02:20:26,800
rapture developed, I don't think they're around anymore.

2538
02:20:26,800 --> 02:20:27,440
Don't quote me on that.

2539
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:29,360
I might be confusing my companies too.

2540
02:20:29,360 --> 02:20:31,280
That's why I specified it was.

2541
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:32,240
No, no, no, I know.

2542
02:20:32,240 --> 02:20:34,160
I know, but I just, that's why.

2543
02:20:34,160 --> 02:20:34,660
Yeah.

2544
02:20:35,620 --> 02:20:42,420
So, so, well, it definitely looks like this, the type of game I'd be into

2545
02:20:42,420 --> 02:20:45,460
playing, I thought that everybody's gone to the rapture was brilliant and

2546
02:20:45,460 --> 02:20:46,820
I'm looking for, for more.

2547
02:20:47,380 --> 02:20:47,700
Yeah.

2548
02:20:47,700 --> 02:20:50,580
I'll definitely check this game out too, just based on who's behind it for

2549
02:20:50,580 --> 02:20:50,900
sure.

2550
02:20:50,900 --> 02:20:53,780
Cause I really enjoyed, you know, all those games you mentioned, everybody's

2551
02:20:53,780 --> 02:20:55,060
gone to the rapture firewatch.

2552
02:20:55,060 --> 02:20:55,700
It's all good stuff.

2553
02:20:56,500 --> 02:20:56,820
All right.

2554
02:20:57,700 --> 02:20:58,020
All right.

2555
02:20:58,020 --> 02:21:01,700
Let's go just a few more stories to go and then we'll, uh, open it up to chat

2556
02:21:01,700 --> 02:21:04,260
to see if they have any questions in chat and see if we have any email

2557
02:21:04,260 --> 02:21:04,580
tonight.

2558
02:21:04,580 --> 02:21:07,540
Although sadly, I don't think we do, but, um, maybe I missed one.

2559
02:21:07,540 --> 02:21:09,540
Uh, anyway, so Loki, what do you have for us?

2560
02:21:10,820 --> 02:21:18,740
So DeNovo is, um, offering their anti-cheat middleware to, uh, PlayStation

2561
02:21:18,740 --> 02:21:23,540
five, because yes, that's what everybody's been asking for to be in their

2562
02:21:23,540 --> 02:21:24,260
games.

2563
02:21:24,260 --> 02:21:26,660
They, everyone loves DeNovo, right?

2564
02:21:26,660 --> 02:21:31,220
You know, on PC, no one ever complains that it breaks everything and just is

2565
02:21:31,220 --> 02:21:32,740
completely useless.

2566
02:21:32,820 --> 02:21:38,100
But yes, let's bring that and that anti-cheat, uh, technology to the

2567
02:21:38,100 --> 02:21:39,060
PlayStation five.

2568
02:21:40,020 --> 02:21:41,780
So it's not popular.

2569
02:21:41,780 --> 02:21:42,740
That's for sure.

2570
02:21:42,740 --> 02:21:48,740
Um, it's definitely, I hope it's better than their anti tamper software, but

2571
02:21:48,740 --> 02:21:52,740
it is something that they're allowing, you know, folks to license, to be able

2572
02:21:52,740 --> 02:21:55,940
to use in their PlayStation five titles.

2573
02:21:55,940 --> 02:22:01,860
Um, good luck with that because if your game has a stink of DeNovo on it, then

2574
02:22:02,740 --> 02:22:04,900
I don't know, you're going to be hurting.

2575
02:22:04,900 --> 02:22:10,580
I think the best part that sums us up, there was a comment on this story and

2576
02:22:10,580 --> 02:22:12,740
it's like, perfect.

2577
02:22:12,740 --> 02:22:17,540
It's we'd let, and you know, the quote is we'd like more PC experiences on

2578
02:22:17,540 --> 02:22:19,940
consoles, monkey paw activated.

2579
02:22:22,500 --> 02:22:25,780
I thought, I thought that was funny, but yeah, DeNovo sucks.

2580
02:22:26,580 --> 02:22:27,460
Uh, yeah.

2581
02:22:27,460 --> 02:22:32,100
And, um, I do, are they trying to do this because maybe they think like they

2582
02:22:32,100 --> 02:22:34,580
can be a little more transparent hidden with it.

2583
02:22:34,580 --> 02:22:36,820
If it's on PlayStation, like they don't have to advertise it.

2584
02:22:36,820 --> 02:22:38,100
It has DeNovo in it.

2585
02:22:38,100 --> 02:22:40,820
So maybe they kind of think it'll like sneak in there and maybe people won't

2586
02:22:40,820 --> 02:22:41,140
notice.

2587
02:22:42,500 --> 02:22:46,580
Um, well, apparently they haven't been too transparent with it because DeNovo

2588
02:22:46,580 --> 02:22:50,500
has already said that some PlayStation five games are already utilizing

2589
02:22:50,500 --> 02:22:55,220
anti-cheat through DeNovo, but they won't say which ones because of the stink

2590
02:22:55,220 --> 02:22:58,020
of DeNovo and that will cause people not to want to play those games.

2591
02:22:58,580 --> 02:23:02,340
Um, so chances are you already have it and you just don't know.

2592
02:23:03,380 --> 02:23:03,700
Yeah.

2593
02:23:03,700 --> 02:23:07,460
So don't they have tests for that?

2594
02:23:08,900 --> 02:23:10,420
Not for the, not for this one.

2595
02:23:10,420 --> 02:23:11,780
There's no DeNovo test.

2596
02:23:14,100 --> 02:23:15,220
So unfortunately not.

2597
02:23:15,220 --> 02:23:20,580
So, uh, yeah, there's another strike against PlayStation five, I guess for

2598
02:23:20,580 --> 02:23:21,300
now.

2599
02:23:21,300 --> 02:23:22,260
All right.

2600
02:23:22,340 --> 02:23:26,820
And, uh, our last story on record tonight is, uh, about the Game Boy

2601
02:23:26,820 --> 02:23:27,380
Advance.

2602
02:23:27,860 --> 02:23:29,380
Uh, yes, an old system.

2603
02:23:29,380 --> 02:23:30,020
Yeah.

2604
02:23:30,020 --> 02:23:32,820
Um, do you remember how they had those video cartridges for Game Boy

2605
02:23:32,820 --> 02:23:33,300
Advance?

2606
02:23:33,300 --> 02:23:35,940
Not the 3D, 3D thing that was later.

2607
02:23:35,940 --> 02:23:38,740
Although I don't even think they ever actually really did that except maybe

2608
02:23:38,740 --> 02:23:40,660
like dinosaur office and the things you can download.

2609
02:23:40,660 --> 02:23:41,540
But do you remember the Game Boy?

2610
02:23:41,540 --> 02:23:42,500
They had the Tekken movie.

2611
02:23:43,220 --> 02:23:44,900
Did they have the Tekken movie on Game Boy carts?

2612
02:23:45,540 --> 02:23:47,460
They had the Tekken movie on the 3DS.

2613
02:23:47,460 --> 02:23:48,660
It was in 3D.

2614
02:23:48,660 --> 02:23:50,820
Well, the Game Boy Advance cards, they were a lot smaller.

2615
02:23:50,820 --> 02:23:53,540
They could only hold about 20, 30 minutes of video.

2616
02:23:53,540 --> 02:23:57,220
So they had like SpongeBob episodes, uh, and like Pokemon episodes.

2617
02:23:57,220 --> 02:23:59,300
That was the type of stuff you got on Game Boy Advance cards.

2618
02:23:59,300 --> 02:24:03,540
It was very much a shut up while we're trying to drive somewhere type of

2619
02:24:03,540 --> 02:24:06,100
thing, entertain the kids in the back seat type of thing.

2620
02:24:06,100 --> 02:24:09,700
Since not everybody has a television installed in their car, at least not

2621
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:11,620
back when the Game Boy Advance was a thing.

2622
02:24:11,620 --> 02:24:18,820
Well, somebody, because they can, decided to put Tenet on a Game Boy

2623
02:24:18,820 --> 02:24:19,300
Advance cards.

2624
02:24:19,380 --> 02:24:19,620
That's right.

2625
02:24:19,620 --> 02:24:23,220
The Christopher Nolan movie Tenet, which, and why did he do this?

2626
02:24:23,220 --> 02:24:26,980
Because Christopher Nolan said you have to enjoy it in cinema, even though

2627
02:24:26,980 --> 02:24:28,420
there's a pandemic going on right now.

2628
02:24:29,060 --> 02:24:32,260
This is a film whose image and sound really needs to be enjoyed in your

2629
02:24:32,260 --> 02:24:34,100
theaters on the big screen.

2630
02:24:34,100 --> 02:24:39,940
So YouTube, YouTuber Bob Wolf decided, fuck that, and put it on the Game Boy

2631
02:24:39,940 --> 02:24:40,580
Advance.

2632
02:24:40,580 --> 02:24:43,780
Loki, you went, you went and saw Tenet during that like gap where the

2633
02:24:43,780 --> 02:24:44,740
theaters open, right?

2634
02:24:44,740 --> 02:24:48,420
So I did, yeah, I did see it in the cinema and their sound balancing is

2635
02:24:48,420 --> 02:24:50,420
just crap in that movie.

2636
02:24:50,420 --> 02:24:52,100
Like it, it's just awful.

2637
02:24:53,060 --> 02:24:53,860
Awful, awful.

2638
02:24:57,860 --> 02:25:03,140
So, so in the, in a similarity to the world of, you know, three and a half

2639
02:25:03,140 --> 02:25:09,780
inch floppy disks, this movie is spread across five cartridges because of

2640
02:25:09,780 --> 02:25:11,300
the limits of what it will hold.

2641
02:25:12,260 --> 02:25:16,340
The guy made custom labels for it, which I think is really funny, but then

2642
02:25:16,340 --> 02:25:21,460
to actually get the movie to fit on the cartridges, the resolution is down

2643
02:25:21,460 --> 02:25:25,300
to 192 by 128.

2644
02:25:25,940 --> 02:25:30,580
That 128p power, six frames a second.

2645
02:25:31,620 --> 02:25:39,060
So not, not 60, six and a whopping eight kilobyte bit rate.

2646
02:25:39,060 --> 02:25:44,100
So it's, it's like watching real video, um, of a movie.

2647
02:25:45,060 --> 02:25:47,860
If you want to throw it back a little bit, it's basically what you're looking

2648
02:25:47,860 --> 02:25:48,580
at there.

2649
02:25:48,580 --> 02:25:52,740
Uh, so it's definitely not IMAX, uh, definitely not the way, uh, the director

2650
02:25:52,740 --> 02:25:54,020
wanted you to see it.

2651
02:25:54,020 --> 02:25:57,380
Uh, and no, no word on how it sounded, although I'm sure it was kind of

2652
02:25:57,380 --> 02:25:58,340
garbage.

2653
02:25:58,340 --> 02:26:00,340
So, um, there you go.

2654
02:26:00,340 --> 02:26:03,460
If you want to check out the YouTubes on it again, the YouTuber's name is Bob

2655
02:26:03,460 --> 02:26:06,100
Wolf, W-U-L-F-F.

2656
02:26:06,100 --> 02:26:09,380
And I do, I do applaud the idea of doing things.

2657
02:26:09,380 --> 02:26:10,260
Why not?

2658
02:26:10,260 --> 02:26:13,220
Just because I get, because this guy said it's the only way to watch it.

2659
02:26:13,300 --> 02:26:15,860
Uh-uh, I'm going to do it my own way.

2660
02:26:15,860 --> 02:26:20,020
Now we need to have the AI upscale that, bringing it up to 60 FPS as well.

2661
02:26:21,380 --> 02:26:25,300
What, what horrible abomination that becomes.

2662
02:26:25,300 --> 02:26:28,980
I want to, I want a Game Boy Advance cartridge of OLR clips.

2663
02:26:28,980 --> 02:26:33,140
Obviously we can't, but a whole show of OLR would take like eight cartridges,

2664
02:26:33,140 --> 02:26:38,020
but we can put clips together on a cartridge, go through the Twitch library

2665
02:26:38,020 --> 02:26:40,660
and have OLR clips on a Game Boy Advance cartridge.

2666
02:26:40,660 --> 02:26:41,780
I like that idea.

2667
02:26:42,340 --> 02:26:46,820
Anyway, uh, Orange Right points out, hey, they did actually put Shrek and

2668
02:26:46,820 --> 02:26:49,300
Shark Tale on one Game Boy Advance cartridge.

2669
02:26:49,300 --> 02:26:51,140
Very much compressed.

2670
02:26:51,140 --> 02:26:52,100
Yeah, I bet.

2671
02:26:52,100 --> 02:26:52,900
I bet.

2672
02:26:52,900 --> 02:26:56,820
Uh, DJ Roma asks, uh, is real media still a thing?

2673
02:26:57,700 --> 02:26:58,500
That's a good question.

2674
02:26:58,500 --> 02:27:00,100
I would assume they got bought or something.

2675
02:27:01,220 --> 02:27:03,380
I think they've been gone for an age.

2676
02:27:03,380 --> 02:27:04,180
I think so too.

2677
02:27:04,820 --> 02:27:09,220
Um, uh, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I have a home theater and I just want

2678
02:27:09,220 --> 02:27:10,580
to watch it on a Game Boy Advance.

2679
02:27:11,860 --> 02:27:15,940
Uh, Sia Tabiri suggests they should reshoot it on a Game Boy camera.

2680
02:27:16,500 --> 02:27:17,540
Oh, I like that idea.

2681
02:27:19,940 --> 02:27:21,620
Making movies on a Game Boy camera.

2682
02:27:21,620 --> 02:27:22,340
Brilliant.

2683
02:27:22,340 --> 02:27:22,740
All right.

2684
02:27:23,780 --> 02:27:26,980
That's it for all of the stories we had, uh, slotted tonight.

2685
02:27:26,980 --> 02:27:29,380
However, we do want to open it up to the listener round table.

2686
02:27:29,380 --> 02:27:34,180
If you guys have any questions or comments in chat over at twitch.tv

2687
02:27:34,180 --> 02:27:38,020
slash vog network, that's twitch.tv slash VOG network.

2688
02:27:38,020 --> 02:27:40,900
Um, then you guys can ask questions away there.

2689
02:27:40,900 --> 02:27:44,660
We would also during this point of the show, check on our emails every week.

2690
02:27:44,660 --> 02:27:50,420
You guys maybe send us emails to participate at orange lounge, radio.com.

2691
02:27:50,420 --> 02:27:51,940
And we read our favorites on air.

2692
02:27:51,940 --> 02:27:53,140
However, unfortunately.

2693
02:27:53,700 --> 02:27:54,420
You failed us.

2694
02:27:54,420 --> 02:27:57,620
You did not send us any emails this week, so I can ask Rob.

2695
02:27:57,620 --> 02:27:57,860
Yes.

2696
02:27:57,860 --> 02:28:00,980
I can ask dark soccer about drag race, even though I've barely been watching.

2697
02:28:01,700 --> 02:28:02,820
I caught up.

2698
02:28:02,820 --> 02:28:03,700
Um, oh, did you?

2699
02:28:04,500 --> 02:28:05,140
Yeah, I don't.

2700
02:28:05,140 --> 02:28:06,100
Did you see the last episode?

2701
02:28:06,100 --> 02:28:07,140
Cause I don't want to spoil it.

2702
02:28:07,140 --> 02:28:10,740
I well, don't spoil it for the listeners anyway, but I am aware of what happened.

2703
02:28:11,460 --> 02:28:12,500
I'm pissed.

2704
02:28:12,500 --> 02:28:12,740
Yeah.

2705
02:28:13,940 --> 02:28:18,340
A lot of people are saying, I still think the winner has been obvious since the very first

2706
02:28:18,340 --> 02:28:19,300
episode.

2707
02:28:19,300 --> 02:28:22,740
Um, but I don't, I don't think it is.

2708
02:28:22,740 --> 02:28:23,620
I think it's Simone.

2709
02:28:23,620 --> 02:28:27,380
I think it's got Nick, but I think, I think that is the final two for sure.

2710
02:28:27,380 --> 02:28:29,620
I think it's Simone and got make it the final two for sure.

2711
02:28:30,260 --> 02:28:31,060
So who knows?

2712
02:28:31,060 --> 02:28:35,300
I'm actually really happy with Simone, but I think that got Nick has.

2713
02:28:36,580 --> 02:28:38,020
A different kind of artistry.

2714
02:28:38,580 --> 02:28:39,080
Mm hmm.

2715
02:28:39,620 --> 02:28:46,980
And, uh, I mean, I actually thought that got Nick and, uh, candy should have won the, uh,

2716
02:28:48,020 --> 02:28:48,980
the, the challenge.

2717
02:28:49,780 --> 02:28:53,940
Um, so speaking of like video games, I can actually tie a drag race to video games.

2718
02:28:53,940 --> 02:28:59,620
I actually retweeted Simone dressed up as, uh, Jesse from team rocket.

2719
02:28:59,620 --> 02:29:03,540
And so I did not know Simone was a bit of a gamer, but, uh, that was the thing she posted

2720
02:29:03,540 --> 02:29:05,540
on, uh, uh, social media today.

2721
02:29:05,540 --> 02:29:10,980
So I was like, Oh, my queen, even though I, I, I, I, I want them all to be successful.

2722
02:29:10,980 --> 02:29:12,740
You know, there it's a, it's a good group.

2723
02:29:12,740 --> 02:29:13,380
They have this year.

2724
02:29:13,380 --> 02:29:15,380
I'll tell you what, I don't hate candy muse anymore.

2725
02:29:16,340 --> 02:29:16,580
Yeah.

2726
02:29:16,580 --> 02:29:18,980
She's I she's, she's there for a reason.

2727
02:29:19,620 --> 02:29:24,580
Gotten to be a lot better of a person and definitely isn't like silky who was just annoying.

2728
02:29:25,460 --> 02:29:27,460
I'm looking at chat, uh, quickly.

2729
02:29:27,460 --> 02:29:30,340
Cause, uh, there's a followup to the real media thing that came up.

2730
02:29:30,340 --> 02:29:33,780
Real media still exists says Bobby Blackwell for the link.

2731
02:29:33,780 --> 02:29:38,340
Uh, looks like real networks works mostly with streaming services.

2732
02:29:38,340 --> 02:29:42,820
So maybe they kind of facilitate, um, streaming at this point now, which is kind of what they

2733
02:29:42,820 --> 02:29:48,260
were doing before, but they're not so much like the go-to destination to see the streaming stuff,

2734
02:29:48,260 --> 02:29:52,740
um, that other websites like Twitch have become so interesting.

2735
02:29:52,740 --> 02:29:54,340
I had no idea real networks was still around.

2736
02:29:54,340 --> 02:29:55,220
Well, congrats.

2737
02:29:55,220 --> 02:30:00,820
Isn't life 365 back to like, they, they sunset it and then they like came back, I think,

2738
02:30:00,820 --> 02:30:02,980
but I'm not sure they're exactly what they were before.

2739
02:30:03,780 --> 02:30:04,580
I'm double checking.

2740
02:30:05,780 --> 02:30:07,860
I thought that was their website is up.

2741
02:30:08,740 --> 02:30:09,460
Yeah.

2742
02:30:09,460 --> 02:30:15,060
But are they still like radio stations and stuff or internet radio program?

2743
02:30:15,060 --> 02:30:16,900
Real people and not an algorithm.

2744
02:30:16,900 --> 02:30:17,300
Wow.

2745
02:30:17,860 --> 02:30:18,740
So they came back.

2746
02:30:19,780 --> 02:30:22,500
Cause I, I re I remember, yeah, it was 2016.

2747
02:30:22,500 --> 02:30:23,460
I'm looking real quick.

2748
02:30:23,460 --> 02:30:24,660
Uh, it was in 2016.

2749
02:30:24,660 --> 02:30:25,300
They stopped.

2750
02:30:25,300 --> 02:30:28,980
And I remember we had a whole thing where we were like, pour one out for life 365, where

2751
02:30:28,980 --> 02:30:31,940
it all began end of an era and all that stuff.

2752
02:30:31,940 --> 02:30:37,780
Uh, it looks like, okay, so in 2018, they reorganized under media Creek and they are

2753
02:30:37,780 --> 02:30:40,420
back in the U S Canada and United Kingdom.

2754
02:30:41,300 --> 02:30:41,780
Interesting.

2755
02:30:41,780 --> 02:30:42,980
Well, good, good for them.

2756
02:30:42,980 --> 02:30:44,260
That's where we got our start.

2757
02:30:44,260 --> 02:30:44,760
Hey.

2758
02:30:46,340 --> 02:30:46,980
Yeah.

2759
02:30:46,980 --> 02:30:50,340
And yeah, they have like two different models.

2760
02:30:50,340 --> 02:30:53,220
One's ad supported and the other's non ad supported.

2761
02:30:53,220 --> 02:30:57,620
Oh, I think that's kind of how it worked before actually very similar.

2762
02:30:58,340 --> 02:31:00,740
Cause I remember, yeah, you could have, we had two streams.

2763
02:31:00,740 --> 02:31:02,180
One was the ad supported stream.

2764
02:31:02,180 --> 02:31:06,260
One was the, because they would be on different songs depending on where the listener was

2765
02:31:06,260 --> 02:31:06,340
at.

2766
02:31:06,340 --> 02:31:09,140
It was always weird, but yeah, apparently you can't monetize them.

2767
02:31:09,780 --> 02:31:10,580
Oh, interesting.

2768
02:31:11,860 --> 02:31:13,300
Unless, okay.

2769
02:31:13,300 --> 02:31:16,180
So if you put their ads on there, you can monetize.

2770
02:31:16,980 --> 02:31:18,580
Oh, of course.

2771
02:31:18,580 --> 02:31:19,300
Of course.

2772
02:31:19,300 --> 02:31:20,420
Uh, who, who was there?

2773
02:31:20,420 --> 02:31:21,700
Who in chat was there?

2774
02:31:21,700 --> 02:31:24,500
Who remembers the orange lounge radio station on life 365?

2775
02:31:25,300 --> 02:31:27,060
Who is there in chat?

2776
02:31:27,060 --> 02:31:29,780
I'm kind of curious how many are still around from those days.

2777
02:31:29,860 --> 02:31:31,780
Our dial up friendly radio station.

2778
02:31:32,900 --> 02:31:33,540
Yeah.

2779
02:31:33,540 --> 02:31:36,340
That you could, that was the thing, that was, that was one of the big things that

2780
02:31:36,340 --> 02:31:39,140
differentiated us from DDR free radio at the time.

2781
02:31:39,140 --> 02:31:41,300
DDR free radio was broadband only.

2782
02:31:41,300 --> 02:31:43,220
We were dial up friendly radio.

2783
02:31:43,220 --> 02:31:49,460
So it was doing, you know, cause we, we were doing this before podcasting existed.

2784
02:31:49,460 --> 02:31:49,960
Right.

2785
02:31:51,140 --> 02:31:57,220
And I, so many friends that I have now, I made through the early days of the show.

2786
02:31:58,660 --> 02:31:59,540
So, oh, for sure.

2787
02:31:59,940 --> 02:32:02,420
There's a lot of you in chat that are like, me, me, me, me.

2788
02:32:02,420 --> 02:32:03,060
Hell yeah.

2789
02:32:03,060 --> 02:32:04,180
So, well, thanks.

2790
02:32:04,180 --> 02:32:06,100
Thank you guys for sticking with us through all these years.

2791
02:32:06,100 --> 02:32:07,380
It really does mean a lot.

2792
02:32:07,380 --> 02:32:11,860
And, uh, I think it's, I think it's really cool that, uh, yeah, that we have, you know,

2793
02:32:11,860 --> 02:32:12,820
transformed the show.

2794
02:32:12,820 --> 02:32:15,300
Here we are now doing a video thing on Twitch.

2795
02:32:15,300 --> 02:32:18,260
I don't think we ever thought this would be a video show ever.

2796
02:32:18,980 --> 02:32:20,740
You know, it's crazy.

2797
02:32:20,740 --> 02:32:23,060
And now how long did it take you to get me on video?

2798
02:32:23,860 --> 02:32:29,700
A pandemic, which, which even still I was like, you could just be on Discord and not

2799
02:32:30,180 --> 02:32:33,460
point the camera at like a doll or something or a stuffed animal.

2800
02:32:33,460 --> 02:32:38,420
But, um, I'm, I'm, I'm so glad you've decided to jump in and maybe this means once we're

2801
02:32:38,420 --> 02:32:41,060
all back together, we can all be on cam, which would be fantastic.

2802
02:32:41,620 --> 02:32:44,260
So I still like putting random things up in front of the camera.

2803
02:32:44,260 --> 02:32:44,980
That's kind of funny.

2804
02:32:44,980 --> 02:32:45,620
Yeah, yeah.

2805
02:32:46,500 --> 02:32:48,180
So that's, that's fun.

2806
02:32:48,180 --> 02:32:51,940
Um, what else is I going to say about all the old school days and all that stuff?

2807
02:32:51,940 --> 02:32:54,740
Oh, and the, the long running podcast stuff.

2808
02:32:54,740 --> 02:32:59,540
So yeah, I, you know, we, we do have that one little claim is that we're the longest

2809
02:32:59,540 --> 02:33:05,620
running gaming show out there because the life through 65 years kind of added some time

2810
02:33:05,620 --> 02:33:10,260
to this show that nobody else is able to get, you know, a lot of Guinness thing, a lot of

2811
02:33:10,260 --> 02:33:11,940
the long running shows out there.

2812
02:33:11,940 --> 02:33:14,180
And again, this is not a knock to any of those shows.

2813
02:33:14,980 --> 02:33:19,780
They, everybody has worked very hard and I'm all about supporting other indie shows and

2814
02:33:19,780 --> 02:33:22,740
you should be listening to all these other great shows that have been around forever.

2815
02:33:22,740 --> 02:33:26,820
Um, but, uh, the one, the reason why we're able to kind of say, oh, we got about a year

2816
02:33:26,820 --> 02:33:30,420
and a half on everybody else is because we were on life through 65 before podcasting

2817
02:33:30,420 --> 02:33:31,060
was a thing.

2818
02:33:31,060 --> 02:33:35,620
And then, but we jumped, we jumped on podcasting pretty quick with that whole to go edition.

2819
02:33:35,620 --> 02:33:37,060
It still wasn't in iTunes.

2820
02:33:37,060 --> 02:33:39,780
We were still doing a podcast before iTunes.

2821
02:33:39,780 --> 02:33:43,620
So I think the, uh, random message for him, I was reading that clued me in on that.

2822
02:33:44,980 --> 02:33:46,420
Uh, DJ Rama S in chat.

2823
02:33:46,420 --> 02:33:48,020
And by the way, this is the part of the show.

2824
02:33:48,020 --> 02:33:51,220
If you want us to do tangents now, this is the time to yell them out and chat.

2825
02:33:51,220 --> 02:33:52,260
So go for it.

2826
02:33:52,260 --> 02:33:56,500
Uh, such as this one, uh, DJ Rama S says, remember O L R at Fanta Mae.

2827
02:33:57,060 --> 02:33:58,100
I sure, I sure do.

2828
02:33:58,100 --> 02:34:00,500
The question wasn't for me, but I sure do.

2829
02:34:00,500 --> 02:34:00,900
Of course.

2830
02:34:00,900 --> 02:34:05,540
I'm sure dark soccer and Loki remember that I love doing the live shows.

2831
02:34:05,540 --> 02:34:08,100
I wish we had had a chance to do more of them.

2832
02:34:08,100 --> 02:34:10,580
Sometimes it's just hard to get us all together.

2833
02:34:10,580 --> 02:34:15,060
I would love for all three of us to go to dragon con and do a show there, but I know

2834
02:34:15,060 --> 02:34:18,660
the reality is it's going to be hard for Loki to get away from the kids for that amount

2835
02:34:18,660 --> 02:34:19,300
of time.

2836
02:34:19,300 --> 02:34:25,060
I would still want to do it, but I'm definitely going next year because we're going to have

2837
02:34:25,540 --> 02:34:26,980
the layout army.

2838
02:34:26,980 --> 02:34:27,480
Yeah.

2839
02:34:27,940 --> 02:34:28,180
Yeah.

2840
02:34:28,180 --> 02:34:31,860
And this year we still, you know, dragon con is still kind of like up in the air as it

2841
02:34:31,860 --> 02:34:32,020
is.

2842
02:34:32,020 --> 02:34:33,940
We ju we just don't know the period.

2843
02:34:33,940 --> 02:34:36,820
We're not going to know until that.

2844
02:34:36,820 --> 02:34:37,380
What was it?

2845
02:34:37,380 --> 02:34:38,180
60, 90 days.

2846
02:34:38,180 --> 02:34:41,940
So I think 60 days before we're just not going to know, just like last year, I think it was

2847
02:34:41,940 --> 02:34:42,820
around the 4th of July.

2848
02:34:42,820 --> 02:34:42,980
Right.

2849
02:34:42,980 --> 02:34:46,820
We found we're not going to know till then and whatever, but I think it is better to

2850
02:34:46,820 --> 02:34:47,700
bank on next year.

2851
02:34:47,700 --> 02:34:48,820
Probably just 60 days.

2852
02:34:48,820 --> 02:34:49,380
Yeah.

2853
02:34:49,380 --> 02:34:52,980
Next year there will be, you know, and that's a good one to bank on Loki.

2854
02:34:52,980 --> 02:34:54,980
I'd love it if you could come, but I understand he has kids.

2855
02:34:55,540 --> 02:34:57,140
I would still love it if I could come too.

2856
02:34:57,700 --> 02:35:02,100
You know, we can always, there is still, you know, dark soccer, if you're going to be there,

2857
02:35:02,100 --> 02:35:03,620
there's a couple of ways we can do it.

2858
02:35:03,620 --> 02:35:06,820
We can always allow Bobby Black Wolf to have third chair because he's a big part of this

2859
02:35:06,820 --> 02:35:08,900
show, but Loki is a part of this show too.

2860
02:35:09,700 --> 02:35:13,220
So I would think we should just, and I think they did this one year.

2861
02:35:13,220 --> 02:35:17,380
They had their co-host come in via Skype, but they had a lot of issues with it, but

2862
02:35:17,380 --> 02:35:19,540
I think they've ironed a lot of that out.

2863
02:35:19,540 --> 02:35:24,660
So Loki may, I'm not going to promise anything, especially when it's not my track, not my

2864
02:35:24,660 --> 02:35:27,860
programming, but if we wanted to do that, since dark soccer and I will both be there,

2865
02:35:27,860 --> 02:35:30,580
we could probably Skype Loki in or something like that.

2866
02:35:30,580 --> 02:35:33,540
The only thing for you, Loki, is that it might be at like 7 AM.

2867
02:35:33,540 --> 02:35:34,020
You're tight.

2868
02:35:34,020 --> 02:35:36,180
It just depends on what time slot they give us.

2869
02:35:36,180 --> 02:35:39,540
And it's going to be three hours earlier for you, but we could probably work it out.

2870
02:35:40,260 --> 02:35:40,760
So.

2871
02:35:41,780 --> 02:35:42,340
Yeah.

2872
02:35:42,340 --> 02:35:45,540
So, you know, it comes, but I miss conventions in general.

2873
02:35:45,540 --> 02:35:51,620
I just, I've wanted to attend more medium sized cons and actually have like a vog network

2874
02:35:51,620 --> 02:35:52,100
table there.

2875
02:35:52,100 --> 02:35:54,980
Cause I think that's the best way to get word of mouth out there.

2876
02:35:54,980 --> 02:35:57,940
Did anybody find us through a con or finding us IRL?

2877
02:35:58,820 --> 02:35:59,320
I don't know.

2878
02:36:00,180 --> 02:36:01,060
Maybe not so many.

2879
02:36:01,060 --> 02:36:04,580
I'm not recognizing a lot of names where I remember that, but.

2880
02:36:04,580 --> 02:36:12,260
Well, I, uh, I invited, uh, Nika in here to join us through our, uh, supernatural chat

2881
02:36:12,260 --> 02:36:12,820
group.

2882
02:36:12,820 --> 02:36:13,540
Well, yeah.

2883
02:36:13,540 --> 02:36:16,740
And social media is a huge, that's why I always say at the end of every show, help us spread

2884
02:36:16,740 --> 02:36:21,300
the word, a tweet, uh, sharing like that goes an awful long way and you never know, you

2885
02:36:21,300 --> 02:36:23,380
know, who might benefit from finding this show.

2886
02:36:23,380 --> 02:36:24,020
So welcome.

2887
02:36:24,020 --> 02:36:24,520
Welcome.

2888
02:36:25,300 --> 02:36:25,800
Yeah.

2889
02:36:26,420 --> 02:36:34,420
And, but I mean, I've had a few people who, uh, you know, like, just like friends who

2890
02:36:34,420 --> 02:36:37,700
have said, Oh yeah, I downloaded the podcast to check it out, you know?

2891
02:36:37,700 --> 02:36:40,420
So a few, a few IRLs.

2892
02:36:41,540 --> 02:36:43,860
Do you know what I did yesterday that I haven't done?

2893
02:36:43,860 --> 02:36:46,820
And maybe I shouldn't even say this on air because there's going to be a very logical

2894
02:36:46,820 --> 02:36:51,140
follow-up question that I don't want to answer on air, but yesterday for the first time in

2895
02:36:51,700 --> 02:36:54,500
six years, I actually looked at our stats.

2896
02:36:55,300 --> 02:36:55,780
I swear.

2897
02:36:55,780 --> 02:37:00,980
And people don't believe me when I say this, I was, um, I, I was in there just because

2898
02:37:00,980 --> 02:37:03,860
I could be, I was like, you know, I haven't looked at this in a long, long time.

2899
02:37:03,860 --> 02:37:06,740
I'm curious, how many downloads is the show getting?

2900
02:37:06,740 --> 02:37:08,260
And so I got the answer to that question.

2901
02:37:08,820 --> 02:37:11,940
Um, and I will say, I, I'm not going to tell you, sorry.

2902
02:37:11,940 --> 02:37:16,340
Those are, that's just our business, but I'll get, I'm well, I'll tell you guys off air,

2903
02:37:16,900 --> 02:37:19,300
but, um, I'll give you a twofold answer.

2904
02:37:19,860 --> 02:37:24,340
It's not as big as it used to be, but it's higher than I thought it was.

2905
02:37:25,700 --> 02:37:29,620
There's a lot of people out there who I think are lurking, who listen that don't

2906
02:37:29,620 --> 02:37:30,740
interact and that's okay.

2907
02:37:30,740 --> 02:37:34,740
I'm not, this isn't, this isn't a call out tweet or anything like that as perfectly.

2908
02:37:34,740 --> 02:37:35,140
Okay.

2909
02:37:35,140 --> 02:37:36,660
We love and appreciate you guys too.

2910
02:37:36,660 --> 02:37:38,980
The silent observers, you guys rule.

2911
02:37:38,980 --> 02:37:44,260
Um, but, uh, yeah, it's, I, I'm always kind of, when I see it, I'm like, oh, that is more

2912
02:37:44,260 --> 02:37:48,980
than I thought because, you know, we get, you know, 40 people, maybe max here live on

2913
02:37:48,980 --> 02:37:49,620
a Sunday night.

2914
02:37:49,620 --> 02:37:52,740
And so I think, oh, maybe there's another 40 to listen on the podcast feed.

2915
02:37:52,740 --> 02:37:56,340
And no, it's, it's, uh, it's actually doing a little bit better than that.

2916
02:37:56,340 --> 02:37:57,700
So that's, uh, there's that.

2917
02:37:59,220 --> 02:38:02,580
Bobby Blackoff in chat says, I still have so many VOG flyers, lol.

2918
02:38:02,580 --> 02:38:08,900
And the sad thing is they're all out of date now because so many shows have sunsetted,

2919
02:38:08,900 --> 02:38:12,900
gone to another network, um, you know, or whatever the case may be.

2920
02:38:12,900 --> 02:38:16,900
We really still need to like build an army of shows, but I just don't see that really

2921
02:38:16,900 --> 02:38:20,100
happening in force until we get to the other side of this pandemic.

2922
02:38:20,100 --> 02:38:24,820
And we can talk about who wants to join up to go to cons together and spread the word

2923
02:38:24,820 --> 02:38:26,180
and do that whole thing again.

2924
02:38:26,180 --> 02:38:27,540
So soon, soon.

2925
02:38:28,100 --> 02:38:30,100
Oh, one of our lurkers said hi.

2926
02:38:30,100 --> 02:38:33,460
Hey, y'all, I said it wasn't a call out tweet, but thank you.

2927
02:38:33,460 --> 02:38:36,660
Mr. Rhizos in chat says lurker here, but love the show.

2928
02:38:36,660 --> 02:38:38,100
Well, thank you very much for that.

2929
02:38:38,100 --> 02:38:39,780
And lurk all you want.

2930
02:38:39,780 --> 02:38:44,100
Just the fact that people, just the fact that people give a shit on what we have to say

2931
02:38:44,100 --> 02:38:48,420
and don't, um, unsubscribe the minute I go on a tangent and talk about something that's

2932
02:38:48,420 --> 02:38:51,940
not video games, which I may have done once or twice tonight.

2933
02:38:51,940 --> 02:38:56,260
Um, it wouldn't be a show without a tangent.

2934
02:38:56,260 --> 02:38:57,060
It wouldn't.

2935
02:38:57,060 --> 02:38:59,300
How do you do a three hour show about video games?

2936
02:38:59,860 --> 02:39:04,420
It's not just about video games, actually.

2937
02:39:04,420 --> 02:39:07,860
The secret is weird stuff on my desk.

2938
02:39:08,740 --> 02:39:09,300
All right.

2939
02:39:09,300 --> 02:39:11,860
By the way, I'm just putting it all on camera because of reasons.

2940
02:39:11,860 --> 02:39:15,700
Let me check in with Loki and see if he has any last minute stories for us tonight.

2941
02:39:16,420 --> 02:39:18,740
No, this is an incredibly slow week.

2942
02:39:19,780 --> 02:39:20,740
It was.

2943
02:39:20,740 --> 02:39:22,020
It was kind of a slow week.

2944
02:39:22,020 --> 02:39:23,220
So, um, all right.

2945
02:39:23,220 --> 02:39:24,740
Well, no last minute stories there.

2946
02:39:24,740 --> 02:39:27,300
All my Mario news that we never got.

2947
02:39:27,300 --> 02:39:28,260
So, yeah.

2948
02:39:29,460 --> 02:39:29,700
Yeah.

2949
02:39:29,700 --> 02:39:30,580
What's that about?

2950
02:39:30,580 --> 02:39:33,380
Or were we expecting stuff on March 10th or what?

2951
02:39:33,940 --> 02:39:34,980
Well, it's Mario day.

2952
02:39:34,980 --> 02:39:38,980
Like last year, I think they showed off, uh, some of the Lego Mario stuff.

2953
02:39:38,980 --> 02:39:42,340
Um, yeah, nothing this year.

2954
02:39:43,540 --> 02:39:44,340
All right.

2955
02:39:44,340 --> 02:39:49,860
And still no word on the, um, year of Zelda everybody was hoping for, which is very sad,

2956
02:39:49,860 --> 02:39:52,820
but maybe there's something about that March 31st date.

2957
02:39:52,820 --> 02:39:58,660
You know, the new fiscal year where, you know, cause they still plan on no more 3d all star

2958
02:39:58,660 --> 02:40:03,060
thing, no more, uh, uh, Mario 35 and all that stuff.

2959
02:40:03,060 --> 02:40:04,020
That's all going away.

2960
02:40:05,060 --> 02:40:07,380
They already, they already got my money.

2961
02:40:07,380 --> 02:40:08,900
So sucker.

2962
02:40:08,900 --> 02:40:09,220
All right.

2963
02:40:09,860 --> 02:40:11,460
No, it's my kids wanted it.

2964
02:40:11,460 --> 02:40:14,020
Uh, it's hard to say no in that case.

2965
02:40:14,020 --> 02:40:14,980
All right.

2966
02:40:14,980 --> 02:40:15,940
Uh, that's it.

2967
02:40:15,940 --> 02:40:19,460
Uh, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts and then we'll be on our way out of here.

2968
02:40:19,460 --> 02:40:23,860
So, um, I, uh, Oh, I should say, as I always say at the end of every show,

2969
02:40:23,860 --> 02:40:26,500
thank you so much for downloading our show or listening to us live.

2970
02:40:26,500 --> 02:40:30,660
However, you consumed OLR, whether you were very, very vocal and chatted a lot,

2971
02:40:30,660 --> 02:40:34,340
uh, or if you were just lurking out there, thank you so much for participating with our

2972
02:40:34,340 --> 02:40:35,060
show tonight.

2973
02:40:35,060 --> 02:40:36,660
We really appreciate you guys being here.

2974
02:40:36,660 --> 02:40:40,580
Um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at OLR, uh, help us spread the word, tell a friend

2975
02:40:40,580 --> 02:40:41,460
or two about the show.

2976
02:40:41,460 --> 02:40:45,700
Cause as dark soccer pointed out a moment ago, social media is very powerful in spreading

2977
02:40:45,700 --> 02:40:46,020
the word.

2978
02:40:46,020 --> 02:40:47,620
So we really appreciate the tweets.

2979
02:40:47,620 --> 02:40:49,940
And I actually saw a couple of really kind tweets this week.

2980
02:40:49,940 --> 02:40:52,420
I try to reply to those when I see them or at least like them.

2981
02:40:52,420 --> 02:40:56,500
Um, so thank you so much to those of you that are spreading the word about OLR out there.

2982
02:40:56,500 --> 02:41:02,580
Um, uh, a host here on a Twitch for VOG network that goes a long, long way.

2983
02:41:02,580 --> 02:41:05,620
Even if you don't stream a lot yourself, it still helps us get the word out.

2984
02:41:05,620 --> 02:41:07,540
So we appreciate all those auto hosts.

2985
02:41:07,540 --> 02:41:09,460
So, um, okay.

2986
02:41:09,460 --> 02:41:16,820
So, um, that is, um, gonna otherwise I think, oh, if you, um, want to help the show out,

2987
02:41:16,820 --> 02:41:19,700
like with money, we appreciate the bits and subs and all that.

2988
02:41:19,700 --> 02:41:21,940
You don't have to, but we're just saying we really appreciate it.

2989
02:41:21,940 --> 02:41:24,340
And the shop of vognetwork.com slash shop.

2990
02:41:24,340 --> 02:41:27,140
If you want to get some merchandise, but again, please don't feel obligated.

2991
02:41:27,140 --> 02:41:30,180
It's just for the way that we get a new merchandise in the shop.

2992
02:41:31,140 --> 02:41:31,940
Soon.

2993
02:41:31,940 --> 02:41:32,580
Trademark.

2994
02:41:33,860 --> 02:41:34,340
All right.

2995
02:41:34,900 --> 02:41:38,580
Um, let us wrap it up with our final thoughts tonight.

2996
02:41:38,580 --> 02:41:41,780
So, uh, dark Sakura, I'll start with you.

2997
02:41:41,780 --> 02:41:43,860
You're, you're showing all the stuff off on cam there.

2998
02:41:43,860 --> 02:41:44,740
What's your final thought tonight?

2999
02:41:45,620 --> 02:41:50,900
Um, I found a bunch of my Instax photos from Easter two years ago with the sisters and

3000
02:41:50,900 --> 02:41:55,140
my Disneyland pictures, uh, from the last, uh, dry con I attended.

3001
02:41:55,700 --> 02:41:59,780
Including, and I don't know why I can never remember his name, but the, the, um,

3002
02:41:59,860 --> 02:42:08,260
uh, yeah, but I also found my, my picture of James St. James that he basically was like,

3003
02:42:08,260 --> 02:42:09,620
let's take a picture together.

3004
02:42:09,620 --> 02:42:10,580
Grab photo.

3005
02:42:11,860 --> 02:42:12,260
Love it.

3006
02:42:13,060 --> 02:42:13,380
Yeah.

3007
02:42:13,380 --> 02:42:14,340
He was pretty cool dude.

3008
02:42:14,340 --> 02:42:14,820
Pretty nice.

3009
02:42:15,540 --> 02:42:15,780
Nice.

3010
02:42:16,660 --> 02:42:17,460
All right.

3011
02:42:17,460 --> 02:42:18,820
Uh, how about Loki?

3012
02:42:18,820 --> 02:42:19,700
Your final thought tonight?

3013
02:42:20,740 --> 02:42:29,140
I'm still trying to locate some buddy to be able to do a label printing and if box packaging,

3014
02:42:29,140 --> 02:42:32,500
I don't even know where to find that.

3015
02:42:33,140 --> 02:42:34,980
It may be just labeled printing.

3016
02:42:34,980 --> 02:42:40,260
And then they have, they have some other alternatives that are more rental case than

3017
02:42:41,460 --> 02:42:44,180
cardboard box, but it may have to go with that.

3018
02:42:44,180 --> 02:42:48,100
I, I may have some hookups from my printing days.

3019
02:42:49,220 --> 02:42:49,620
All right.

3020
02:42:49,620 --> 02:42:53,220
And I was also going to say, get in touch with the game developers, people here locally,

3021
02:42:53,220 --> 02:42:56,740
because, um, they, they will have all those same questions too.

3022
02:42:57,460 --> 02:43:03,620
So there's a couple of, there's a couple of print shops in town that will do like the

3023
02:43:03,620 --> 02:43:06,340
actual like boxes to specification.

3024
02:43:06,340 --> 02:43:10,420
You just need to have the template ready high res, but we can talk about that offline.

3025
02:43:10,420 --> 02:43:10,660
Yeah.

3026
02:43:11,300 --> 02:43:11,540
Okay.

3027
02:43:12,980 --> 02:43:18,260
Um, and then my final thought tonight is when you can get your VAX, get your VAX.

3028
02:43:18,260 --> 02:43:23,860
Look, I got, I got, I got my, I got my microchip quote using my quotey fingers,

3029
02:43:23,860 --> 02:43:26,260
tongue firmly planted in cheek today.

3030
02:43:26,260 --> 02:43:30,180
And I'm, I'm fine and I'm here and I'm excited.

3031
02:43:30,180 --> 02:43:33,380
So I'm excited when everybody else is able to get theirs as well.

3032
02:43:33,380 --> 02:43:36,100
Um, hopefully we really do get to the end of this thing.

3033
02:43:36,100 --> 02:43:36,500
All right.

3034
02:43:36,500 --> 02:43:38,980
Uh, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3035
02:43:38,980 --> 02:43:40,580
Thank you guys so much for being here.

3036
02:43:40,580 --> 02:43:42,180
Uh, we will see you in seven days.

3037
02:43:42,180 --> 02:43:44,980
Let's do it all again for 861.

3038
02:43:44,980 --> 02:43:46,260
We'll see you next week.

3039
02:43:46,260 --> 02:43:46,820
