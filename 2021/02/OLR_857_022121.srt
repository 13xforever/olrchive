00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Years ago I was watching a compilation of best video game trailers, and all the best ones were for games I've never played and don't have any interest in and I was disappointed about that. Fast forward just a bit and we finally reach the part of the timeline where game universes and other forms of media are getting good. While I'm not a mobile player, I am still delighted to see that Dota 2 is getting its own animated series this year. This is my favorite headline of the night, now it's time for your host,

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring you detail on this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm Rob Roberts and I'm joined virtually via the magic of Discord with my co-hosts. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hi, how are you?

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I don't...

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Your internet is a little bit choppy, I think, because you're cutting out a little bit, but that's alright.

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's like having a Zoom call during work. Are you there? Are you on mute?

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Oh my god, I don't even know what's going on because it was affecting work yesterday and my speeds and everything are great, so I think that it's just time to replace this dinosaur.

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well the good news is the complaining is coming through loud and clear, so I think we have you back.

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
All I need to do is bitch about everything then, for fuck's sake.

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
When life gives you lemons, ask to speak to life's manager.

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Alright, anyway, we were doing a little show and tell before the show tonight and I thought maybe you'd want to show some of our Twitch listeners, or yeah, Twitch viewers of course, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network over at twitch.tv slash vog network, that's VOG Network, at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But don't worry, for the podcast folks, I'm not just going to make you sit there in silence. If you subscribe to us on a popular platform like Spotify or iTunes or whatever, Google Podcasts, whatever it is you used to listen to us, I know you can't see, but I'll talk you through it here.

14
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So Dark Sakura has some things. So like, you know, as if this vault, which is more of a metaphorical vault at this point, it's not an actual vault anymore, but we have some new things, right?

15
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So Dark Sakura, talk us through some of these, these things you've added to your collection, and where did you get this from?

16
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Well, and right now, I guess my office here is like my nerd cave officially. So back in the day, of course, you know, my husband used to work at a GameStop and GameCrazy, that was the Hollywood video one, and we would acquire some of their advertisement products.

17
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So I'll hold up the first one. It is a ginormous PS2 box for a Parappa the Rapper 2.

18
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I love the giant oversized game boxes. I don't know what it is about them. I like just like fake giant oversized product in general. I guess it reminds me of Supermarket Sweep when they have to grab the large inflatable thing. I don't know. Anyway, what else you got?

19
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So that was Parappa.

20
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You ready for number two?

21
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yes, I am.

22
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh, what a cool it's a blow up of Busta is that it's Busta Groove, right?

23
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah, it's the US one, of course, because I don't know that. Did they do these in Japan? I don't know. But at any rate, you know, like I was going to pass that shit up.

24
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Oh, yeah, that's that's a keeper right there. I love that one. So it's a giant oversized of that. And then here we go. Maximo.

25
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah, and like Maximo is kind of the maybe a spiritual successor to Ghosts and Goblins, Ghouls and Ghosts.

26
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Which those games are back in the news this week. We'll get into that in just a little bit. We have a very busy intro to our show tonight.

27
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I love that now. Now give us. So that's the Final Fantasy 10 box for those listening on the podcast.

28
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And I love that they have the front and the back so somebody could pick that up and pick the giant box up and read the back.

29
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Now you have to give us your best Titus laugh.

30
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No.

31
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Jamie's like, I don't have to do anything.

32
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Perfect. Or should I say all right.

33
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh, Kingdom Hearts. Is that one or two? It's Kingdom Hearts one, right? Kingdom hearts. Love it.

34
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yep. That's awesome. That game was like brand new the very first week we did.

35
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Oh, well, I remember that there were some people that were playing through that for the first time. So you ready for the last one?

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
All right. Yes, I am. Because we've got to introduce. Oh, yes. Final Fantasy seven, the original on PlayStation complete.

37
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This is probably my most munched one.

38
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But this is, I think, one of the first ones we ever acquired. And it's these are going nowhere except on my wall.

39
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You know, I was going to say, if we are ever able to get back together in person again, hopefully, hopefully the vaccine won't take.

40
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You're not going on your wall. These are going on my wall. It doesn't have to be on my wall, but we can maybe borrow them for a photo shoot or something.

41
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah, I would do that. You know, Rob, I would gladly lend these to whatever new studio happens to come into the future.

42
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I think the last actual photo shoot we did with the three of us was like a lot.

43
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It was like 10 years ago. Like I, I, I look great with all my hair, but it was a long time ago.

44
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Well, my hair was when I was dying it myself.

45
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, yeah. And there was a little bit more of me at the time. So we've all we've all changed a little bit.

46
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
All right. Well, let's also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

47
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Hello. Who's also changed in 10 years because now he's I don't know, maybe I need to stop calling him Tech Master Loki and call him Game Developer Loki.

48
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It doesn't have the same ring to it. OK, I guess. Yeah, it's true. It doesn't have the same ring to it.

49
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I guess I guess you're stuck with the old name. So how are sales of pixel poops going through the roof?

50
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
No. All right.

51
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, you know, you just make sure you get out there and promote and do all that good stuff, you know, because it's it's going to be hard after the first week.

52
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You know, it is what it is. All right.

53
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Well, we hope most of our listeners have checked that out by now over on itch.io or steam pixel poops number two.

54
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And on steam, you have to look up the main pixel poops game. But I would also recommend that to all all of our listeners here at Orange Lounge Radio.

55
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But we've talked at length about that. So my question to this for you this week is what now?

56
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Like, obviously, we'll get into your gaming week a little later in the show.

57
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So I'm talking about what you played, but like what's going through your mind now about what you want to do next?

58
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Or you focus now on, oh, I got to go back and I got to upgrade pixel poops, too, for that physical release that everybody's asking about.

59
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So I've been working on like a few things, just like I purchase a few more boards to come inside, seven more coming in.

60
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So I have like a total of 12 cartridges now because just the supply is not there's not a lot of supply out there for that stuff.

61
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So I got what I could with that. I have been looking at what I'm going to do next.

62
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I wasn't really sure. There's an NES game jam that's in March.

63
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
They may do. I don't know. But yeah, I have lots of ideas of things I could work on.

64
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I may do another NES game. I have an idea for one, so I may do that.

65
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
All right. Go into our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

66
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Zen Monkey regarding your name is suggesting Game Master Loki.

67
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't know. That might be too much for the ego, Zen Monkey. I like the name.

68
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It does have a much better ring to it. Game Master Loki.

69
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But I like I imagine like Loki probably would get his butt whooped at most video games by a lot of people out there on the Internet.

70
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yeah, we're probably we're in our 40s now, like.

71
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I don't know if we're going to call ourselves the game master, but I I appreciate the thought and I do agree it has a better ring to it.

72
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
All right. I am the game mistress, the game mistress.

73
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
See, I I kind of like that in a way, but I think when I think game mistress, it's got to be more like Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.

74
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's that's the Jamie vibe I get. So, you know, yours, Cruelly.

75
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Hi. Yes. Our Zoom meeting is still connected.

76
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And I'm just like whatever about it right now. So I understand. All right.

77
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, let's talk a little bit. You know what? Since we are joking about age and things like that.

78
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And for the folks watching on Twitch tonight, we had a little parody at the beginning that was poking fun at age a little bit.

79
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But, you know, this is this is the reality is that today one of the all time greatest franchises is turning 35 years old.

80
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So today, February the 21st of 1986, is when the Famicom version of The Legend of Zelda released on the Famicom, which was actually the disk system at the time.

81
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And you can play that original Japanese version of the game if you are a Nintendo Switch Pro person, because you can actually download it.

82
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You just make a Japanese account on your Switch, which doesn't cost you any money to do.

83
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And you just use that to get into the e-shop and download the Famicom player.

84
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And then you can log into the Famicom player in your U.S. account that actually pays for the service.

85
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And I imagine this works, you know, UK and other regions as well.

86
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And then you can actually play the original.

87
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So you get that little extra sound chip that the Famicom disk system had that didn't translate over to the Nintendo.

88
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Really extra as much as different because the cartridges had were the ones that could get the extra chip.

89
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:17,000
True. But it did seem like games, there were a handful like that one, Metroid, Castlevania, you know, that sacrificed a little something as opposed to trying to, you know, because they couldn't really bring it over one for one.

90
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:27,000
One of the big things, though, is that actually Castlevania 3, when it came out, it had that extra chip that gave it another, I think, layer of sound.

91
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Oh, right. Because it wasn't a disk game, of course. Right, right.

92
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Exactly. And it also had extra animations and like a different attack for Grant. There were a few things.

93
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah. But anyway, this isn't about Castlevania, it's about Zelda.

94
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It could be.

95
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
We love all the games, but I'm kind of curious, you know, because I know for me, this series has been hugely impactful.

96
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And I guess I guess maybe I'll start first and talk a little bit about my memories of Zelda, because, you know, playing the very first original Legend of Zelda game.

97
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Obviously, we got it a little bit later, but that was really the first game that I remember really wanting a Nintendo for.

98
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Like, I liked playing Super Mario Brothers in the arcade, and I liked playing things like Ice Climbers and stuff like that, too.

99
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And I remember playing some things at friends' houses, like my friend even had the Rob the Robot, and we tried to play, I think it was Stack'em, even though we didn't understand what the hell we were doing.

100
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But, oh, and Hogan's Alley. I remember that one, too, because that was a game I really liked in the arcade.

101
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But I remember that when I saw, like, the Legend of Zelda, that was the moment, and I would have been like eight or nine years old when I saw it, where I was like, oh, I've got to have this.

102
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Like, this game is amazing, and I want to play this. I want this in my house. Mommy, Mommy, can I have an NES? Okay, we'll get straight A's.

103
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And I did. I got straight A's. So, you know, I got a Nintendo, and that was pretty much the first game we bought.

104
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Outside of, of course, it comes with, most of them came with Mario Brothers and Duck Hunt and all that, but Zelda was, like, the first game we bought.

105
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And then I became so obsessed with that game, like, not just playing through the first quest, but playing through the second quest, that even though I got picked on a lot in school when I was growing up, because, you know, I was, you know, a little different,

106
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:24,000
the bullies would then want to talk to me more one-on-one to ask me things like, so where is, like, level seven in the second quest of Legend of Zelda, because I can't find it.

107
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So it was a very interesting kind of, like, dynamic that played out there, but that was really the game that led to me becoming, like, the, and I'm using my quotey fingers, video game expert when I was younger, you know, the one in the class who, who knew everything about the games and read all the magazines and all that stuff.

108
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So, yeah, that, and, you know, obviously from there, I, I, I still love Zelda 2. I got that the Christmas or holiday when that first came out, and I played the crap out of that.

109
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I wasn't bothered by the changes. It was just a little different to me, but I really enjoyed the game. Of course, I loved A Link to the Past on Super Nintendo and on and on.

110
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I, I did, I did lose the series a little bit because in college I fell out of gaming a little bit, and so I didn't transition to Nintendo 64.

111
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,000
When I did finally go to a new console, I went to PlayStation because that's where Final Fantasy was at, and that's, like, the, the big series.

112
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So I kind of fell out of Zelda at that point, which I know, because Ocarina of Time is, like, the Zelda game for many, many people, but for, I had a different trajectory.

113
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I kind of fell out at that point, and, you know, obviously I've rediscovered a lot of the love through more recent releases like Twilight Princess and so forth.

114
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So, yeah, I mean, it's, it's just an all-time great series, but especially that original game has a real special place in my heart.

115
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So I'm kind of curious about you guys and your memories of Zelda back in the day. Now, Jamie, how were, how were your thoughts on Zelda?

116
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I played that when it came out more times than I can count because I played, you know, both quests and then I would play them again, and then I would play them again.

117
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And, like, I wouldn't even bother getting, like, the, the red bracelet, I would just play through and, you know, I, it was just something I did.

118
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And then I didn't like Zelda 2, you know, had good music, wasn't my favorite, although I like watching Dan play it.

119
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And I mean, I, oh yeah, I remember that, you know, kind of thing. I really liked it. I had, I had the gold cartridge.

120
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Um, gosh, I mean, the only thing that toppled it in my gaming esteem was the Guardian Legend.

121
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And that takes a lot to topple, at the time, to topple that.

122
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Even the Guardian Legend kind of owes a little bit to Zelda. And I think part of the reason why that game, you know, at least why I'm a fan of that game is because it's not just some of the best parts of Zelda, but then it's like a shooter 2.

123
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You know, it's like the best part of both of those kind of coming together. And I think that's what that made, that made that game very special in many ways.

124
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Well, and then there's other games that I really like that, of course, were influenced by that, like Newtopia and Newtopia 2 that were on the PC Engine or TurboGrafx.

125
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Sure. I think a lot of...

126
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So, a good number of...

127
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Go ahead.

128
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh, there's a good number of games that I like that were influenced by the first one, most of the top down games, you know, but I, I want to say that Legend of the Valkyrie came out before Legend of Zelda.

129
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I have to double check that. So I also see some other games that I like influenced the Legend of Zelda.

130
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:47,000
That's true. Games that actually influenced the Legend of Zelda kind of going the other way. You know, I would think certainly something like Adventure on the Atari 2600 was kind of like an early, early, early kind of precursor to that style.

131
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Like, obviously it's different. And obviously with the, you know, Atari 2600 is a very kind of, you know, I don't think it necessarily had the same leverage in Japan where obviously Zelda came from.

132
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Go ahead, Jamie.

133
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You remember though, before I had a NES, I had a ColecoVision.

134
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yep.

135
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And my favorite game to play on ColecoVision was Venture.

136
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You know, very top down adventure, dash in, grab the thing, dash out.

137
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And I saw the Legend of Zelda as a very logical evolution of that scenario with more story.

138
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And so that was also, you know, one of, you know, it probably even took some influences from Rogue. I mean, if you think about it.

139
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Oh, sure. Yeah, that's a good one.

140
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah.

141
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network points out Intellivision had the AD&D games that were top down dungeon crawlers.

142
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So it's kind of like there was kind of like a dungeon-y game on whatever you were playing at the time, but it just kind of depended on how they did it.

143
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You know, they all did it a little differently.

144
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I would probably say that Rogue would have been its great granddaddy.

145
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah, I think that's... did you just call Zelda a roguelike?

146
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I did.

147
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
If you think about it.

148
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Actually, I would say a lot of people are super into the Zelda randomizer stuff.

149
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
That is a roguelike. Absolutely.

150
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
That's the only kind of...

151
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm more referring to the overall...

152
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Oh, I get it. No, I get it.

153
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:23,000
The mythology of it where you have exploration that you do, you find secret panels, you have enemies to fight, you move your way through it, you map as you go.

154
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah.

155
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So I think that I would even go on a limb and say that Rogue is probably one of our... Rogue and the tech space games married together, created our adventure RPG series.

156
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
As far as video games go.

157
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
How have you been with Zelda in the later years? Do you still try to play all the games that come out or have you fallen out a little bit?

158
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I never could get into Majora's Mask because the moon thing creeped me the fuck out.

159
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But I've beaten Ocarina of Time several times.

160
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Link to the Past is my favorite ever.

161
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I played the sequel to it.

162
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Didn't really get too much into it.

163
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
We didn't play many of the...

164
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I mean, I played Link's Awakening on Game Boy back in the day.

165
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And of course, we have the remake on Switch.

166
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Dan and I did Twilight Princess together.

167
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And I fucking love Breath of the Wild. Don't even get me started on how much I loved it.

168
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But we didn't play Skyward Sword for reasons, I think.

169
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
We just really didn't have a reason. It just didn't happen.

170
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You're gonna get another chance not to get too far ahead, but we'll get to it.

171
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Right. We're getting it. We are getting it.

172
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Because Dan and I have been talking about, are we gonna get it? Are we gonna wait?

173
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And then the announcement came, so yeah.

174
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I think most people listening know it's coming, but we'll talk about that in a little bit.

175
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Dan really enjoyed Four Swords Adventures. I didn't get into it that much.

176
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Oh yeah, I liked that one too.

177
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Man, those games that kind of utilized the Game Boy Advance and the GameCube.

178
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
There was only a couple of them, but they were all done so well.

179
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Minish Cap was really cute, and I regret having not played more of that.

180
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It was when I was going through a lot of video game ADD.

181
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You were talking about the Link to the Past being one of the all-time greats.

182
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And I totally agree.

183
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It was my favorite.

184
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I think it's my favorite Zelda 2 at the end of the day as well.

185
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And honestly, one of my favorite video games in my top ten, like overall, ever, easily.

186
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Maybe even top five. I have to really sit down and think about it.

187
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But it is so many elements in it that just make it the perfect adventure game.

188
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And it's so replayable.

189
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But I think that's also why I really loved the Link Between Two Worlds that came out.

190
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The Link Between Worlds.

191
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yeah, because that brought a lot of that same kind of style to it.

192
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Well, I actually have to tell you something.

193
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You know how steadfast my top three games have always been?

194
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Right.

195
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
My top three games list has changed.

196
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Ooh, how so?

197
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Because I've been going back to play A Link to the Past.

198
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And so I'm still going to say The Guardian Legend is number one, but A Link to the Past is number three now.

199
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Fantasy Zone is number two.

200
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Okay.

201
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Space Harrier, I've decided it's more fun to watch people play it than actually play it.

202
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Okay.

203
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I love Space Harrier, don't get me wrong.

204
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But number four is not a bad place to be of the millions of video games that have ever been made.

205
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Well, I was actually going to say number four, Super Metroid.

206
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Oh, well, hey, I'm okay with that choice.

207
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That's my number one.

208
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And guess what number five is that isn't Space Harrier?

209
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Ooh, you've really demoted Space Harrier over time.

210
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I have, because I enjoy watching other people play it more than actually playing it myself.

211
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I would be shocked if Mass Effect isn't up there, just with how much that trilogy has done.

212
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And actually it is a cross, probably a toss up between the Mass Effect as a series, because I consider all three of them basically one game in my heart.

213
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yeah, of course.

214
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Or, I mean, I've got like a big tie list because I put the Mass Effect series and Dragon Age as, I guess, more of my modern favorites.

215
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Like I have two lists of favorites.

216
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I have my classic favorites and I have my more modern favorites.

217
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You don't have to rank everything either, you know?

218
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Divided by...

219
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's hard to rank art.

220
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Divided by maybe the year 2000 gap.

221
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Okay.

222
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
So my pre-California and my post-California.

223
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Okay. Well, was that your five? Was Mass Effect slash Dragon Age?

224
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm actually going to say Chrono Trigger and keep that as my favorite classics.

225
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But for my modern favorites, Mass Effect goes on the top of the list and specifically Dragon Age Inquisition would be right under the Mass Effect series.

226
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Okay.

227
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I played so much of that shit. It was great.

228
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
All right.

229
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I got to hear from Loki.

230
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Loki, your reflections on Zelda's birthday as it turns 35.

231
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Well, Zelda was one of the first games I had for the NES.

232
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So that was kind of how the NES was presented to me.

233
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,000
When like we... I remember we had played, you know, different games at friends houses and stuff like that.

234
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But like when my parents surprised me with the NES, they had Zelda booted up on it.

235
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And so that was kind of like my first game anyways.

236
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
So yeah, it definitely does have a special place in my heart, you know, for it.

237
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And I played a ton of it.

238
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So.

239
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yeah.

240
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And in all of the others, all this except several of the 3D ones, really the only thing 3D that played was probably Wind Waker.

241
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I didn't really play... I guess the 3DS stuff is sort of 3D, I guess.

242
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So I did those as well.

243
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And also the DS stuff, but not really any like Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask,

244
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Skyward Sword did not play that.

245
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Haven't really even played much of Breath of the Wild.

246
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So I don't know.

247
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It was just hard getting into those.

248
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Are we surprised, you know, obviously we're going to kind of roll into the Nintendo Direct Talk here in a moment,

249
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
which is, you know, another big headline from the week.

250
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
But are we kind of surprised that Nintendo didn't try to do like a classics type of thing for...

251
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I mean, to be fair, well, to be fair, let's make sure we state if you have the Switch online,

252
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
you already do have the original Legend of Zelda, Zelda 2, the Adventures of Link and Dark Soccer's favorite game,

253
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
A Link to the Past are all available in those two libraries.

254
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
So they didn't have any need to repackage those games because they're already there on the Switch.

255
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
But are we surprised they didn't try to do, you know, Ocarina of Time, you know, or some of the other,

256
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
you know, maybe like Ocarina of Time slash Majora's Mask kind of combo thing,

257
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
even though, you know, it's not just for Jamie that Majora's Mask is a little bit controversial,

258
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
but some people love it, some people don't like it.

259
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm kind of in the middle with it.

260
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I honestly don't think I really spent enough time with it.

261
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And I think a collection like that would have really kind of given me a chance to revisit that again.

262
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Are we kind of surprised Nintendo didn't go that direction?

263
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I still think that they have time to do that.

264
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
We only know some of the announcements so far this year.

265
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I don't think that it's out of the realm of possibility for them to do some sort of collection outside of Skyward Sword.

266
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I think that it's been rumored for a while that they're going to do something like that with Ocarina of Time

267
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and maybe even throw some of the other Wii games on there.

268
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You know, there could be Twilight Princess or, you know, they could do Majora's Mask.

269
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I mean, they've remastered both of those sort of for 3DS.

270
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And I mean, emulating the Wii is pretty easy.

271
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I don't know if they want to necessarily dive into the Wii too much because, you know, with motion controls and everything,

272
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
they do have to kind of work around that a little bit.

273
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,000
That's one of the greatest things about this Skyward Sword thing and why I'm kind of interested in it is that it gets rid of that.

274
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I mean, well, I should say get rid of it.

275
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,000
You can actually play a refined version of it, if you will, with the more refined controllers on the Switch.

276
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
But and for a lot of people, this is huge. I already saw it in chat once.

277
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I know for me the fact you can just use the buttons and just play it like, you know, other Zelda and just play it with a controller.

278
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:34,000
That's great for me. So it makes it a huge thing I would like to check out.

279
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
But I think, though, there's still an opportunity to do more stuff like that.

280
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I mean, if you remember for Mario's 35th anniversary, they did a bunch of stuff and they've announced things.

281
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And I don't know if they announced it all at once. Maybe they did, but I think they did.

282
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
There's still time in the year to do that. I mean, true.

283
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:02,000
You know, there's stuff that's going to be coming out around June when they have all the summer announcements for around E3, which is not really a thing anymore.

284
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
But I don't know, I could totally see them doing another collection of some sort.

285
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Just they have plenty of games to work from.

286
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm surprised that we haven't seen some of the DS games come back like as a collection of those.

287
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But I know that it's kind of hard to kind of do that maybe with the Switch, but...

288
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I don't think so. I mean, we've seen how many shooter games that have come out on the Switch now that have a vertical mode.

289
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So you could just play with your Switch vertical and you use the little, you know, you can mount it up and then, you know, just take one of the controllers off and you play with that.

290
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
The pinball games do this too. You can play a vertical mode.

291
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And I think a DS thing would work fine in vertical mode, but for whatever reason they don't want to do it.

292
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Maybe because they don't like the idea of being separated from the TV like that.

293
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Although, why not just have a DS image on your TV?

294
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You just, sure, you lose a lot of real estate on the sides, but I bet people would still play it.

295
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I don't know.

296
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Yeah, I mean, it's touchscreen functionality, I think is probably why they didn't.

297
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:12,000
But there's some of those things, I think, with even like, Zelda and stuff, the control scheme, they could probably adapt it to work because they had it using touchscreen.

298
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And it worked great for that, but they could probably adapt it with traditional controls, or they can go the lazy route and just put the Nintendo 64 versions out.

299
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Yeah, that's what I would expect.

300
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And put Wind Waker in there or something like that.

301
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I mean, they've already remastered Wind Waker once, just ported over.

302
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I mean, there's easy ways out to do all that stuff.

303
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Yeah. Well, let's talk a little more about that Nintendo Direct and some of the things that were talked about.

304
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Obviously, as we've mentioned quite extensively already, we know one of the big, big headlines out of that was that they're going to be making a Skyward Sword kind of redo on the Nintendo Switch.

305
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And Bobby's actually correcting kind of what I said earlier, saying it's not really button controls because you still have to identify the direction of your slashes.

306
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So you use the right stick to swing instead of hitting A. But that's, it's still, you know, I don't have to jump around.

307
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I can, if I want to lay back on my couch and be like that, you know, and just have the, you know, I can still kind of play that way.

308
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I don't actually have to get up and move around and all that stuff.

309
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So I do like that. But sure, I get what you're saying. It's not really a button.

310
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
But OK, it's a flick of the thumb either way.

311
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Yeah.

312
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
But anyway, what were some of the, obviously I have some opinions on the direct as a whole, and I'm sure you guys do too.

313
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And I mean, chat as well with that. But why don't we go through some of the headlines just to kind of refresh our memory with what all they showed us.

314
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Loki, I know you had something cued up for that.

315
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Sure. Yes. So, I mean, some of the big stuff, obviously, we just talked about Skyward Sword, which is getting an HD port on the Switch coming out July 16th.

316
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,000
They made the announcement of Splatoon 3, which is really big, kind of a tease, but still not coming out until next year.

317
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It was also one of those things where it was like, we've been talking about this for how long and how did we not see this coming today?

318
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You know, like when they played the Splatoon 3 trailer, my mind kind of went, oh, of course.

319
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Oh, of course. That was kind of like where, oh, of course.

320
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Of course they're going to do something here.

321
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:21,000
They showed off because we had gotten a tease. This was during the Mario 35th anniversary stream that they did, like back in September, I think, or maybe even before that.

322
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Talking about like the Animal Crossing stuff that was coming out.

323
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
So that's going to be coming out March 1st with a free update and they kind of showed off some of the items.

324
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
One of the cool, unique things in there is you can actually get warp pipe to be able to move around your island, which is awesome.

325
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And I think a lot of the stuff that they have, especially like with the Thwomps and the coins and stuff like that, pretty cool to see it all very interactive.

326
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Somebody pointed out on social media that those warp pipes are some of the first items that expand, that actually give additional functionality to the island.

327
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I don't know, Dark Soccer is the expert when it comes to Animal Crossing, but just real quick, picking your brain on what you thought of the warp pipe announcement, because that's more than just a decoration.

328
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:09,000
It's going to go in my town. I'm putting one by my house and one in front of my shops.

329
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Honestly, I wish the island could be bigger now, like so we could decorate and you could have like a whole like second island that you have to use a warp pipe to get.

330
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I guess that's asking a lot. It's asking a lot, but no, it's nice.

331
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Make it happen. Come on.

332
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You could even not that I want to give you ideas, but you could charge a fee for it. I mean, yeah, I don't know.

333
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Yeah.

334
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Anyways, so we got our next big Mario announcement. Mario Golf.

335
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Sorry, just some quick other comments from chat. Vio by Kurt. Hey, Kurt says AC Mario announcement was awesome.

336
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And yeah, I got to say, there's so much that it looks like they're adding. You can really transform the look of your island a lot with that.

337
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And I thought that was pretty cool. So there is that.

338
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Sjoan Hunter Matt says second island, also known as Item Hoarder Island.

339
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Yeah, that's what it would turn out for me. Kurt with another suggestion saying if the warp pipe could be connected to a best friend's island, that would be amazing.

340
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Oh, I like that. That's an interesting thought. Anyway, sorry, Loki.

341
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Other other announcements. You're talking about the golf, right?

342
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yeah. So they have Mario Golf Super Rush, which is a brand new golf game coming out June 25th.

343
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And they're going to have some sort of story mode along with that with your Miis as well. So that's it's neat, I guess.

344
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Not Mario Kart 9, but we'll deal.

345
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I did. I did sense the kind of meh coming from Twitter on that one.

346
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,000
But I feel I feel like these arcade type golf games have an audience. They always seem to sell.

347
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It's like in hot shots, golf on PlayStation has always been a big one.

348
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And I got to say, like for for what it is, it does look neat.

349
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I'm not sure if it's something up my alley where I want to spend 60 bucks on it.

350
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
But I was like, you know, I know there is an audience for these games and it does look like, you know,

351
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Nintendo always puts these unique spins on kind of the golf formula.

352
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And I always think of like the Kirby miniature golf.

353
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I don't think that was the name of the Kirby Superstar course.

354
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Yeah, Air Force that, you know, that was basically a golf game. It was a very unique kind of spin on it.

355
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So, I mean, I expect the game is going to be very interesting and, you know, for that audience will be worth money.

356
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
But I'm just not sure for me specifically.

357
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
It'll be interesting there. The announced fall guys is coming to the switch.

358
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Finally, this summer, we got our new character for Smash Brothers announced, which is Pyre from Xenoblade Chronicles two.

359
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And then she also transforms into some other character as well.

360
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
So she's coming in March.

361
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Then lots of like really old games being announced and brought over.

362
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
So we have Tales from the Borderlands coming, Stubbs the Zombie.

363
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
We've got also the Ninja Gaiden collection, Star Wars Hunters.

364
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Well, actually, that's a newer game now, but it's based.

365
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It's a game developed by Zynga.

366
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So take that as you will.

367
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
You know what? You know, Zynga made that high heels game I was talking about last week.

368
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
So that's what you can. Where's my Switch port of high heels?

369
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And I should be able to play it in vertical mode so my heels can get extra high. Just saying.

370
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:47,000
There's a new game called World Ends Club. World Ends Club is a detective story by the makers of Danganronpa that's coming out May 28th.

371
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,000
We also had a game that looked like it was Octopath Traveler, but it's not.

372
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,000
It's Project Triangle Strategy. I would imagine it's them using that engine for a very different kind of game.

373
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Yeah, it's like a tactics game. So that's kind of cool.

374
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And they had a demo that came out already for that.

375
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
They showed off that they're going to be doing a Miitopia game for the Switch.

376
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
So bringing that over from the 3DS. Where the hell did that come from? Who asked for that?

377
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I mean, I'm not I'm not dogging on it because I know that game has its fans.

378
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I have friends that were very lit up when they saw the announcement.

379
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It was definitely a, of all the games I expected them to bring back, that was not the one I thought.

380
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But I guess that's what makes the announcements kind of fun, I guess.

381
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:42,000
They have announced there was that Capcom Arcade Collection that was coming out. Arcade Stadium.

382
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And tons of games included.

383
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
This was my favorite headline out of the whole thing and I bought it.

384
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And I had $40 to get all of the games, but it's I think it's like 31 games.

385
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
They have a ton of games in there too.

386
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
They really do. And I will say for Dark Sakura, because I'm going to say the magic word that always gets her attention.

387
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Strider is in the collection and it's the arcade version of Strider.

388
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And I have to say, I don't remember the last time I played the arcade version of Strider.

389
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It's been a long time, like since I was like fucking around with Mame a long time ago on a computer that wasn't good enough to run Strider.

390
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
So to be able to play that again has been neat. I'll talk a little more about it in my gaming week.

391
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
But the Capcom Stadium thing was like my favorite thing they announced because I love my retro stuff.

392
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And we have CyberBots.

393
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Don't you know CyberBots is Capcom's number one game?

394
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
It's a quote.

395
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:48,000
There's a real interesting mix of like like very mainstream stuff like Super Street Fighter 2, Street Fighter 2 Turbo, 1943, Ghosts and Goblins.

396
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
You know, there's a mix of that and then like really deep cut stuff in that collection.

397
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
So I thought it was neat.

398
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Yeah, so lots of cool stuff in there.

399
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
So that was pretty exciting. I wish we'd seen more of that kind of stuff.

400
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
More release dates announced.

401
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So No More Heroes 3 is coming August 27th.

402
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
There's a game called Knockout City that's by EA.

403
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
It's like a dodgeball battle royale game that's coming out May 21st.

404
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
What else?

405
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
We've got a shooter that's called Neon White that's going to be coming out.

406
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
It looked kind of cool.

407
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And they showed off The Legend of Mana is getting a Switch port as well.

408
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And so that's coming out June 4th.

409
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I've got something to say. I got something to say.

410
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And this is going to get me in trouble, but I'm going to say it because it's my opinion.

411
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
That's my opinion.

412
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:53,000
The Legend of Mana is probably easily in the top three most disappointing games I've ever played in my life.

413
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And I know that is not going to be a popular opinion.

414
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:06,000
But coming off of playing games like Secret of Mana, Secret of Evermore, and then buying that on the PlayStation, I was so disappointed.

415
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And one of the only Square Enix games to me that's more disappointing than Legend of Mana is Saga Frontier.

416
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
So honestly, I am not feeling the Square remasters right now.

417
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
This is not an era for me.

418
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And that's okay. It doesn't have to be for me.

419
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I know a lot of people that are very excited about that.

420
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And I will say, I'm not even looking at chat because I'm sure they're screaming at me, but I will say this.

421
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Maybe it is a second chance to try the game again and see if maybe something just didn't click the first time.

422
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
You know, because sometimes that's the sort of thing that happens, but I don't know.

423
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I was not feeling the Legend of Mana announcement.

424
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
All right, I'm looking now to see what's going on.

425
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
We had also announced, was it two Famicom Detective Club stories that are getting localized?

426
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I've never heard of that series.

427
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I have. They're supposed to be pretty cute.

428
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I mean, we can get that game localized, but no Earthbound 3, no Mother 3 or whatever.

429
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Nintendo and their priorities. Let's put out another game.

430
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Or hey, I know, let's put out a trailer for DC Super Heroes or Super Hero Girls Teen Power.

431
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
But that has, it has an audience. The audience isn't me.

432
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
But I was kind of like, oh, this is cool that this exists.

433
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
That was pretty much my reaction to that trailer.

434
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I'm happy this exists, even though I'm not going to be buying it for me.

435
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
But I bet other people will be very thrilled with that.

436
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I wanted to mention this because I thought it was a good comment from Bobby in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork says,

437
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I think honestly, this is because it's easier to coordinate development of a remaster over Zoom than a new game right now.

438
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
We've now been out of offices for 11 months. This keeps developers employed.

439
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
True, although there's one game they still can't seem to remaster.

440
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Give you a hint. Logie just mentioned it, Mother 3. Anyway.

441
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Yeah. All right. Anything else to mention?

442
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,000
No, that was it. I mean, they had they showed off Samurai Warriors 5, which it's Samurai Warriors 5.

443
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,000
And also along those lines, apparently Hyrule Warriors, Age of Calamity is getting some DLC.

444
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
They didn't say what it was. They just briefly flashed up.

445
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Hey, you can buy this. Don't know what it is, but.

446
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And Nintendo's DLC is really good usually, so I'm not mad about it.

447
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
But it's not a Nintendo game. It's a Tecmo Koei game.

448
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Yeah, but it's holding a Nintendo name, so it's it's they're still going to have to put a substantial amount into it, I think.

449
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
We'll see. So how did we feel about the direct overall?

450
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So, OK, I'll start. So I I was OK with it.

451
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Like I was kind of ambivalent, which kind of surprised me because it's been so long since we've had a Nintendo direct.

452
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:04,000
But I think I was kind of like, OK, like, you know, I knew we weren't going to get like Metroid Prime 4 game footage or anything like that.

453
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
But I think maybe I was a little bit surprised.

454
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:17,000
And I think this is generally like where Nintendo is at for, I think, a lot of people and why maybe there's like negative reaction there, because there's definitely people that are like, man, that sucked.

455
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
That was a horrible direct. I can't believe they didn't show like anything I was looking for.

456
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And there's another crowd that was like, that was a great presentation. There was something for everybody.

457
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And, you know, obviously the two sides are kind of going at each other. And I really kind of feel like I'm somewhere in the middle.

458
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,000
But I think I understand why folks are upset, you know, at what Nintendo kind of doesn't show.

459
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And let me try to kind of put that into words.

460
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:50,000
So I think a lot of people enjoy Nintendo products and the Nintendo system because Nintendo is probably the best game maker in the biz.

461
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
So people buy Nintendo products to play Nintendo games.

462
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And that particular direct, you had a handful of Nintendo games. You had the Mario Golf, which kind of has a limited audience.

463
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Right. And the golfing thing isn't for everybody.

464
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Again, some people are going to be super into it and excited about it. Cool.

465
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
But there are going to be people to go, meh. OK.

466
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Then we have the Zelda Skyward Sword, kind of a controversial entry in the Zelda series, getting the remaster.

467
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,000
So there's that. And some people are saying, eh, paying 60 bucks for a game I just played and didn't enjoy that much.

468
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I don't know. But then again, there's another crowd that, you know, loves that game and so forth.

469
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And then I think what what really kind of salted people was the Splatoon 3 announcement.

470
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And it's not the fact that Splatoon 3 is coming again.

471
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I think that was actually probably like the least surprising thing they could have said.

472
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And I know that I enjoy. Of course, I'll buy Splatoon 3. I enjoy that series.

473
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I'm not saying it's a negative for me. What the negative is, was the 2022 date at the end of it.

474
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Even though. OK, wait. So this was supposed to be a direct that was going to focus on stuff that's kind of like this year.

475
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
But they're giving us this game that's this far out.

476
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Well, if they're going to be showing us this, like what what about these other Nintendo things?

477
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
What exactly does Nintendo have coming out in 2021?

478
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
OK, they've got a golf game and a Zelda remake.

479
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And I think people are starting to feel like, is is the well dry at Nintendo?

480
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Has the pandemic really affected them like that badly or what's like going on?

481
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And so Nintendo's really had to rely on third parties and especially Square Enix.

482
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
If you look at this direct, like, holy crap, was Square Enix a big part of that job?

483
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
But like when we're talking about third parties, like or even second parties, I don't know.

484
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Like, what's Retro Studios working on? I mean, like, weren't they supposed to have some big thing coming or like.

485
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
What are they doing with Nintendo online? Like.

486
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Are we going to get any more systems on that? Are they going to release any more games on that?

487
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I mean, there's been like hardly anything coming to that.

488
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
And both of those things you just named because Retro is basically Nintendo Studio at this point.

489
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Both those things you just named are, again, Nintendo based updates.

490
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:17,000
And I think that's why this direct left some people a little bit cold is that you got some kind of like take them or leave them for many people.

491
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Nintendo updates, a game announcement for 2022 that anyone could have seen coming.

492
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And that's what Nintendo's got for this year.

493
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And now I imagine there's going to be more in June.

494
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,000
And I'm not again, I'm not trying to sound overly negative on Nintendo, but there is a difference between shitting on Nintendo,

495
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:44,000
which is what I'm not trying to do, and being critical about some of, you know, what they with the cards they choose to and not show.

496
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And I am going to continue to be critical of this because it bugs me.

497
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:55,000
And I know it bugs a lot of you, too, is that Nintendo continues to really sleep on a lot of their back catalog.

498
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Like there's so many people that want to see Nintendo 64, like especially you got a new Pokemon Snap game, which I'm surprised that was missing completely from the presentation.

499
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Although there is a big Pokemon thing going on this next week with the 25th.

500
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So I think all those people that set themselves up for Pokemon Generation 4, I think we're always the remakes and all that.

501
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I think we're always going to be wrong because those Pokemon games almost always have their own announcements and their own thing from the Pokemon company.

502
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
So and that'll all come next week, whatever they're doing there.

503
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
But Pokemon Snap is still a thing Nintendo's been hyping, and I'm really surprised they haven't taken the opportunity to say,

504
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:39,000
and you can check out the original, you know, whether it's 10 bucks or, you know, whether it's through a new Nintendo 64 player or something like that.

505
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I don't know, you know, and obviously no one ever shuts up about Mother 3.

506
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
And spoiler alert, they're not going to until it actually releases.

507
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
And even when it does, it probably still won't be good enough for some people.

508
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:57,000
But, you know, even just the fact that Earthbound is still missing from the Super Nintendo Collection,

509
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:04,000
the fact that the Wii U got that Earthbound Zero, which is still missing from the NES Collection is...

510
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:12,000
My point is, is that there's a lot of Nintendo's library and stuff that fans really want to see Nintendo kind of push more,

511
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
and it's not happening for whatever reason.

512
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
One remake of a controversial Zelda game isn't doing it for people.

513
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
And I think that's what's leaving some people in a weird spot when it comes to Nintendo.

514
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
So I think how you felt about the Direct really boiled down to, how do you feel about Golf?

515
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
How do you feel about Skyward Sword? How do you feel about the third-party releases?

516
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I wasn't really excited about most of the Direct, honestly.

517
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Like, I thought that the Animal Crossing stuff was neat, but I don't really play Animal Crossing.

518
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
My kids do, and my wife does, so I was just like, eh.

519
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I was just surprised, like, I get it, Ninja Gaiden is a great series, but that's an old game.

520
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
That's a really old game that they're porting.

521
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Like, if it was a new Ninja Gaiden game, cool, I'd be all down for that.

522
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
But like, it's an old game.

523
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Like, they're porting some old shit to this system.

524
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Like, Stubbs a Zombie? Who asked for that?

525
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I get that, yes, they need to give a little time to Ninja Gaiden and stuff.

526
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I start to wonder if they maybe give too much time to these releases.

527
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
But here's the why behind that.

528
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:30,000
The Wii U really tripped and fell out the gate because all of the third-party releases that came out for the Wii U were old games.

529
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
They were a year or two old at that point by the time they were hitting the Wii U.

530
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And that's why the third-party stuff really tripped and fell out the gate and it just caused this Wii U to have a sour launch that it never got away from.

531
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Now, the Switch has been in a much stronger position, but I feel like for some people it's almost a little bit like when they see the Tales from the Borderlands and the Ninja Gaiden and they see all that stuff.

532
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:04,000
It's not that those are bad games, but they see Nintendo slipping back into this old habit that years old games finally coming to the Switch are some big deal.

533
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:11,000
When it's not. I guess it depends on the game, but unless it's bringing something really new to the table, it's really not.

534
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And it's not even necessarily Nintendo's fault for any of that stuff, it's just what third-parties are deciding to release on the system.

535
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I guess porting over old stuff is just what they want to do. I don't know. I wish we'd get more from these properties other than just ports of old stuff.

536
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Don't get me wrong, some of these games are pretty good, but Ninja Gaiden came out on the Xbox and then the Xbox 360.

537
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:53,000
And now we're porting that stuff over to the Switch? Who was like, oh my god, I need the... I don't know. I really don't see the point.

538
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I'm pretty sure. Isn't that one of the... Maybe it's one of the free titles with Games Pass right now.

539
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:11,000
That stuff was always synonymous with Xbox at one point, but I don't know. Why waste a direct with that kind of stuff?

540
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Let me get some comments over chat, and then I want to check in with Dark Soccer and see if she has any thoughts about the direct.

541
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Then some comments from chat, sj100matt says, I think you have to couple this with the disappointment that some folks felt about a Switch Pro not happening anytime soon.

542
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Nintendo got a hit with Animal Crossing last year. Folks have been wanting more out of the Switch.

543
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And then MobyBlackWolf says, I think the companies want to make new games, but they want to wait for the pandemic to be over so they can collaborate in person.

544
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And again, I will give everybody involved in these things a little bit of slack because the pandemic has really just changed the world and the way we work and all of this stuff.

545
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:57,000
So I understand things are just... But maybe in that sense, it feels a little weird to have brought out an official direct now, as opposed to these minis they've been doing.

546
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:07,000
But I could see... Hold on, I'm not done. I could see where Nintendo is in a position where it's like, we're damned if we do, we're damned if we don't, when it comes to the direct.

547
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And I get that, and so I'm not going to fault them for it. And I'll make my last point, and then I'll get your follow-up, Loki, and then I'll go to Dark Soccer.

548
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Is that... Now I forgot my last point because I was trying to set all that up. With Nintendo... Dang it. Well, my train derailed. Go ahead, Loki. What was your thought?

549
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I was going to say, there's better games that they could be porting if they're looking to do ports of stuff. Like, I don't know, bring over some of the NES remix stuff. That was pretty cool.

550
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:52,000
There's... I don't know, they could port over a bunch of older NES titles or something and put it in a collection or something. I don't know, there's better stuff to port over. I don't really know what to say.

551
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I mean, we've been getting, like, really old stuff. And it's not necessarily just a Nintendo problem. It's a lot of just developers out there, like, even, like, EA publishing some, like, bringing back Burnout Paradise again. Like, okay, that's a super old game. I mean, it's a fun game, but it's just, it's super old. All it does is make me want a brand new game.

552
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:22,000
That being said, though, I'd totally take a collection of old Ridge Racer games, Namco, if, you know, you're up to it. But that's something we haven't gotten forever. Geez, a new Ridge Racer game.

553
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:35,000
My final thought was, even if the Direct hadn't been, or even if the Direct had been that bad or a bad Direct, which I don't think it was, I think it was just kind of, like, average, it doesn't tarnish that the Switch is still a great system.

554
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Because there are so many great games that are on the Switch, you know, and the fact that 2021 is clearly going to be a little bit of a slower year for the Switch, probably because of the pandemic, doesn't take away from the fact that the Switch is the only place you're gonna be able to play Animal Crossing, Breath of the Wild, you know, and a lot of the games that are very strong in Nintendo's library.

555
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:10,000
So I think that's something to keep in mind, too, is that while maybe this Direct didn't, you know, maybe didn't like get people screaming about the future and so forth, I don't think it necessarily tarnishes the Switch as a system and something that people should consider adding to their library if they somehow don't already have one.

556
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Anyway, Dark Soccer, I'm sorry to make you wait, but I want to ask you, you know, do you play Switch, obviously, Animal Crossing a lot? What were your thoughts about the Direct?

557
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I'm happy about the Animal Crossing stuff. I mean, that's really the thing I cared the most about. There's definitely a few games on there. Like, I'm really curious to see what Neon White is like. I like the art style of it.

558
00:51:34,000 --> 00:52:03,000
I, of course, Capcom Arcade Stadium. I know that there's going to be a lot of play from, you know, that in my house. I did want to play Legend of Mana because I didn't before. So, I mean, I'm looking forward to it. I mean, I'll put it this way. I had, yeah, I think it was Legend of Mana that I had on PS1, but I had an import of it.

559
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:16,000
So, it was very text heavy and I couldn't read very well at the time in Japanese. So, it'd be nice to actually see what it was they were there talking about.

560
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:23,000
There's just really not, though, a lot other than the few things here and there that I'm really overly excited about.

561
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I mean, World's End Club is definitely something I'm interested in because, I mean, it's Spike Chunsoft, isn't it?

562
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I think so, yeah.

563
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Yeah. I love a lot of the games that they've put out. I really love Danganronpa. Hopefully, it might be kind of similar, at least stylistically or in the feel of it. So, I would enjoy playing that.

564
00:52:49,000 --> 00:53:06,000
And, I mean, we were interested in playing Skyward Sword. So, that's happy news. I'm really disappointed, though, that some of the other games were overlooked for either remakes or upscaled versions.

565
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:13,000
All right. Well, we could probably spend a whole three hours talking about Nintendo Directs. I'm sure there's going to be many YouTubes of that length that are doing that.

566
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:22,000
However, we still have some other headlines to cover. I want to talk about the other company that spent an hour talking about their upcoming releases, and I want to talk a little bit about BlizzConline.

567
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Now, BlizzCon usually happens in, what, like October, maybe November? Obviously, it didn't happen in 2020. We all know the reason.

568
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:41,000
But they weren't able to kind of pivot to an online forum fast enough, so they kind of did the online announcements thing now in February.

569
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:54,000
So, we kind of got like October's BlizzCon this past weekend, and there were quite a few things announced. I'll have Loki in a minute give the rundown, but Dark Soccer, I know one thing in particular caught your eye when it came to BlizzCon.

570
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Yeah, I mean, I was a big fan of The Lost Vikings, and I even remember playing World of Warcraft and being really excited to find them in one of the instances.

571
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:16,000
So, that's really fun to me. Dan is super excited about rock and roll racing. He loves that game so much.

572
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And all of that, of course, is in the Blizzard Arcade Collection, which is going to put together those classics that just came out.

573
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:35,000
But the other thing I think is cool, which might actually get me a little bit into the WoW classic, is Burning Crusade, because that's when they started fixing how fucking terrible the game playing was.

574
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:50,000
It would be kind of nice to experience some of those things for the first time, because I didn't play that long. Then again, knowing me, I'd probably go, oh yeah, this is why I didn't like it and not play.

575
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I'm completely uninterested in Shadowlands. Completely uninterested, because they fucked up Sylvanas.

576
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Yeah, the story is very controversial in that regard, yeah.

577
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:11,000
They fucked up one of my favorite characters, so I'm done. I'll be honest, they haven't had a good storyline since Legion.

578
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
And that was the last one I enjoyed playing. So, no.

579
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Back on the classic though, Burning Crusade was really the first one. I did have an account during Vanilla, and I think I played for a couple months.

580
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
But I didn't really get sucked in until Burning Crusade. That was the one.

581
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Remember the computer you gave me?

582
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Yeah, we were raiding during Burning Crusade.

583
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
It was installed on that computer, and it still ran.

584
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Yeah, yeah. That's right. I had it on that little left that's right, because Blizzard's been supporting Macs for the longest time.

585
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Macbook G4.

586
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Yeah, WoW was on that, yeah. I think I played Wrath of the Lich King on that. I don't think it had a great framerate, but it was there.

587
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:59,000
But anyway, I do love that that's coming to WoW Classic, and I think it's very interesting too, because there are probably going to be some people that are like, no, I want WoW Classic.

588
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I don't ever want to go to Burning Crusade. But they're going to give people the option. You can either keep your character on a Vanilla server.

589
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:12,000
No, I think you can keep it on the server it's on, and that server is going to progress into Burning Crusade.

590
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Or you can transfer it to a Vanilla Forever server. So it is interesting they're giving people the choice.

591
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And I wonder, I was just gonna say, I wonder if there won't be a Wrath of the Lich King, because that was really when WoW peaked for a lot of people.

592
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I wonder if that won't be a thing in another year or two, that they'll put the classic servers to that and then that's kind of where they will stop.

593
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Probably.

594
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Yeah. Anyway, sorry, Jamie?

595
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:53,000
No, I honestly enough, I wish that there was something like if you have an active subscription to like just the main game, that you had the full access to all of those varieties of servers.

596
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
You do.

597
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:03,000
If you do, if you subscribe to main WoW, Classic is included with that. And there is no separate classic. It's just a WoW sub and WoW gets you access.

598
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
You just pick the server then.

599
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Yeah.

600
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I thought that it was like a separate install or something.

601
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:18,000
It is a separate install, but you don't have to pay a separate fee. As far as the money is concerned, the money is, it's a WoW sub and it's a little drop down in the Battle.net client.

602
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Kind of like when you're switching to Public Test Realm, you can use a drop down to play WoW Classic as opposed to WoW Current.

603
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Gotcha. Well, neither of them are worth it for me unless I can just play, you know, Cataclysm again and then I can play Legion again.

604
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
And it'll be happy because those were the two good ones.

605
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
So it'll be interesting to see if they do some servers frozen in time for all those expansions. We'll see.

606
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,000
OK, so Blizzard Arcade, Burning Crusade, Loki, what else came out of BlizzCon?

607
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:55,000
All right. So they also had talked about that they're remaking Diablo 2, which had been like kind of rumored for the longest time now.

608
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,000
So better, you know, fully 3D graphics now.

609
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,000
They're going to have cross progression against both PC and console.

610
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:13,000
And they're also doing a remaster of the original game, the expansion Lord of Destruction as well.

611
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,000
And all cinematics will be recreated and updated shot for shot.

612
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Hopefully that's that's actually being done in like Warcraft 3 where they said they were going to do that and didn't.

613
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Yeah, I'm super excited about this, by the way. I'm really excited to jump back into the world of Diablo 2.

614
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I think it's interesting that it's PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and not the last generation.

615
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
They're making it for the newer consoles. I find that interesting.

616
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Well, it still may be compatible with the other systems.

617
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I also kind of wonder what cross progression really means.

618
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Like, OK, if I make a character on PC, then I guess I can use that character on console.

619
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:01,000
But can I play with my friends, like in real time, or is that still going to be separated like it is in Diablo 3?

620
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Yeah. So there's still some questions I have with that.

621
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Even the cross progression is interesting, although does that mean I have to buy the game three times if I want to play on all my systems?

622
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
You know, little things like that, I'd still kind of like to know.

623
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:22,000
But in general, I will buy the Diablo 2 remaster at least once, because that was a great game and I'm excited to see what they do with it.

624
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:32,000
And then along the lines of Diablo, they talked about Diablo 4 as well, showed off the rogue class, so that's something.

625
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And then there was some gameplay with that, too, and it looks really hot. I'm into it.

626
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Yeah. And then talked about, was it Shadowlands Chains of Dominion?

627
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,000
And what else? We talked about the Burning Crusade expansion for WoW Classic.

628
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Hearthstone's getting a new expansion called Forged in the Barrens.

629
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:58,000
The Blizzard Arcade Collection, which is pretty awesome.

630
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,000
And Lost Vikings, Rock and Roll Racing and Blackthorn.

631
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I've only played two of those. I haven't played Blackthorn.

632
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Yeah. And then, was there anything about Overwatch 2?

633
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Okay, so here's what happened with that. In the keynote, their hour-long opening ceremonies, they didn't really mention Overwatch at all.

634
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I mean, they name checked the Overwatch League and Overwatch stuff was still in the sizzle reels and all that stuff, but they really kind of left it out.

635
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:36,000
So a lot of Overwatch fans after the keynote were kind of like, the fuck? Like, where's our update?

636
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:44,000
What happened is that then they continued, like BlizzCon wasn't just an hour long, they continued with panels throughout the weekend.

637
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:52,000
And if you went right on over to Overwatch, that channel, and started watching there, which I think is what they carried on the main channel,

638
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,000
because probably they knew it would be probably the beefiest thing, they did go into some more detail for Overwatch 2.

639
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
And they showed off some new maps. They showed off that there's going to be like PvE with talent trees.

640
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,000
They showed off that there was going to be, that the characters had aged.

641
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,000
So like Soldier 76 and Reinhardt have beards now. What? Or all these other characters have beards.

642
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Oh my goodness, so different.

643
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Oh my gosh, they're so old. So there's that.

644
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:24,000
But it is a little weird to me that they didn't say any of that in the keynote when they really had everybody's attention.

645
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I think that was a real misstep about the keynote, and to kind of, like, well I should let you finish.

646
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
There weren't any other updates though, right? I think you hit everything.

647
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
No, that was it.

648
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:47,000
So, the only thing with the thing overall is that, now, you have to remember, usually these presentations are done with a lot of screaming fans in the Anaheim Convention Center.

649
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:57,000
So obviously something always felt a little bit off with that. Although, I don't know, I think they did the best they could as far as that went in the pandemic kind of situation.

650
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:03,000
But I was watching it along here at VOG Network. We were hosting it and I was commenting in chat.

651
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And one thing I noticed, it kicked off and they had this nice little company love reel going on thing.

652
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Ten minutes into their hour-long presentation, one sixth of the way into their hour-long presentation, they still had not named a single game or product that was new or upcoming or anything.

653
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Because that whole ten minutes had been kind of like, yay Blizzard, yay community, yay our fans, we miss you, and all that kind of fluff.

654
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I understand why they have to do that. Blizzard does have a great community and all that stuff.

655
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:48,000
But do you think maybe you could have given two of those minutes to just say, we do have some more information coming for Overwatch 2 throughout the weekend, including some new map reveals and what are these talent trees?

656
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Stay tuned to the Overwatch panel coming up next for more information.

657
01:02:52,000 --> 01:03:07,000
That's all they had to do, I think, to really kind of quench the Overwatch people who really felt like through that whole Metallica concert, looking on Twitter and stuff, the Overwatch fans were pissed.

658
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:15,000
And I understand. I've been there. I've been the Diablo fan that got nothing at a prior BlizzCon and it sucks.

659
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:21,000
But, well hey, at least you're not Starcraft because they really got nothing.

660
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:28,000
But I also thought, and I thought the way it ended was kind of, eh, that's it.

661
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:36,000
He did, Jay Allard did a lot of like talking up of like, and we've got some other things to show you even in some new worlds.

662
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
We're going to take you to some new places and things you've never been or done.

663
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Like almost like they're getting ready to announce a new IP, which would be a great thing for Blizzard right now.

664
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,000
And then they didn't, not even a frame, not even a picture, nothing.

665
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Now, I understand Blizzard is maybe hopeful that they're going to have a convention this fall.

666
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Although, you know, again, I'm not going to try to predict the state of the world.

667
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
You, you, you, you guess whatever you want.

668
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:09,000
But Blizzard assumes they're going to do some type of announcements again in the fall and maybe they're saving their new IP for that.

669
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Okay, but did you have to give us that dirty of a tease there at the end to lead to a big nothing burger?

670
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Like again, couldn't you have just used that time instead to say, we have some exciting additions coming to Overwatch 2 as well.

671
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Although we're not going to be able to release the game in 2021, we want to update our fans on the latest of what's going on in the Overwatch world.

672
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Like how fucking difficult is that?

673
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,000
So I, I don't understand their logic and how they plan that out.

674
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Because I'll tell you, you know, maybe the Overwatch fans at the end when all was said and done were okay.

675
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:53,000
But there's a lot of people like me who only watch the keynote and then had to kind of like get back to their other stuff that they had going on, like work or whatever.

676
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:59,000
So they missed an opportunity to still not kind of put that stuff in front of me and many people like me.

677
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
So that's my thought on that.

678
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,000
TigerConChat says, so no jaw dropping announcement at this year's BlizzCon?

679
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Confirmation of the Diablo 2 remaster I think is probably their big thing.

680
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I actually think the Blizzard Arcade and the surprise that's out today.

681
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:25,000
And the fact that it's not just like a port of those games, but they really kind of went in and touched them up.

682
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Did some quality of life things, the interviews, the widescreen support, the actual music in rock and roll racing if you want it.

683
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Even though don't stream it that way.

684
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:50,000
But like all of that, I thought as far as like what they announced, they had a better year this year than, was it two years ago when they, or was it, no I guess it was 20, was it just 2019?

685
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:57,000
That they announced Diablo Immortal and then they got, they got, they got dragged on that one.

686
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Like this was a better BlizzCon than that.

687
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,000
And they had some announcements and they had a product that was, it's out now.

688
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:09,000
So there's that. And it's even something Bobby Blackwolf is interested in, the rock and roll racing.

689
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:17,000
So anyway, I actually think when all is said and done, despite the fact I'm nitpicking a little bit when it comes to, you know, what they could have done better.

690
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I think it was probably a better keynote than some of the ones they've had in person.

691
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:27,000
How about that, how about that BlizzCon where the big announcement was the Demon Hunter is coming to Diablo.

692
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Was that 20, I don't remember when that was, but that was a rough year.

693
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Was it 2013? No, it had to be before that.

694
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Diablo 3 has been out a while.

695
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
But yeah, anyway.

696
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Alright, so there you go for BlizzCon.

697
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:50,000
We've had a lot of kickoff topics tonight, but there's just, there's just so many things going on in the gaming world that are all fighting for our attention.

698
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
We do have some more headlines to get into, but I did want to take a minute to do our traditional,

699
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,000
How was your gaming week and talk about some of the video games that we have been playing this week.

700
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
So DarkSakura, why don't we start with you? How was your gaming week?

701
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Animal Crossing.

702
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Well, I mean, and I borrowed your Ring Fit Adventure. I haven't started it yet.

703
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Yesterday I had thrown out my back working on something, so I was like, yeah, maybe I should rest that first.

704
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
But you are in possession of the Ring Fit Adventure. That did happen this week.

705
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I am, yes.

706
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

707
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
And you were in possession of cookies.

708
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
And the cookies were great. Alan and I both enjoyed them.

709
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I made black sesame cookies, which taste vaguely peanut butter-like.

710
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
And they're dark and goth and delicious.

711
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Anyway.

712
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:45,000
We really haven't done a whole bunch of play of anything because we're going to be starting some of the Capcom stuff when Dan gets home.

713
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:50,000
So we've just really kind of had a slacker week for playing much of anything.

714
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I'm still playing word scapes.

715
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I made a 25th place in the last tournament.

716
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Good job.

717
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Word scapes.

718
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:03,000
And I like to come up with words that I know that they won't let me pick.

719
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Like, you know, anal.

720
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:14,000
They never let you play anal or like urea or bones or body parts that are actual real words.

721
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I'm pretty sure I put dyke in one of them.

722
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
And I think it went I think it went to the bonus list.

723
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I don't remember.

724
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
I just played lube.

725
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
It's a word.

726
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
You could be talking about WD40.

727
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
You don't have to be talking about, you know.

728
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,000
But I mean, it's just it's just pretty funny for me.

729
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
It's sort of like, how can I flex my vocabulary?

730
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,000
It's like what I do to wake up in the morning to get my brain to wake up.

731
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
It's a nice little mental exercise.

732
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Yeah. So it's really fun.

733
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:51,000
You know, people want kind of a neat word game and check their spelling ability and.

734
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
What words they know, then try it.

735
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,000
So right after I played lube, I played rub.

736
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
All right.

737
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
If that's it for your gaming week, I will go to Loki.

738
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,000
How is your gaming week now that your game is out there and you don't have to worry about that?

739
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
The pressure of that?

740
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Well, I didn't play a whole ton of games.

741
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I played some Minecraft during the week, just kind of relax to that.

742
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I mainly was just taking a break from computer stuff during the week, trying to watch more TV.

743
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:30,000
But yeah, so I was also trying to promote the game during the week, but, you know, little luck there.

744
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
But keep at it.

745
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
All right. My gaming week, I played I played quite a bit.

746
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I played, as I was talking about a little earlier, I was playing that Capcom arcade stadium.

747
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I did pick that up as soon as I heard the announcement.

748
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:50,000
If you aren't already aware, you can get it on switch and you get it with nineteen forty three for free.

749
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,000
And you may not realize this, but if you go in the store, you can also get ghosts and goblins for free right now.

750
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I think that's a limited time thing to like maybe March 1st.

751
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
There's actually two free games available right now.

752
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
I went all in and just bought them all.

753
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I was like, fuck it. Why not? I like a lot of these old Capcom classics.

754
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I'm going to buy it.

755
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I think the stadium is a pretty well together, well put together collection.

756
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:16,000
You know, they kind of theme it like you're in this old arcade with all the little like little sit down cabinets and, you know, so forth.

757
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
And you can actually play the game like it's being projected on one of those cabinets.

758
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
I don't like those over the top graphic filters myself.

759
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I understand the place for them, though. Some people enjoy them.

760
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,000
But the nice thing is you can just play normal fucking on your TV like it's fine.

761
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:36,000
So I played a little bit of Strider I was talking about, which boy, I'm fucking terrible at that game.

762
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
That's one thing I learned. I'm very, very bad. Huh?

763
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Everyone is.

764
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I know it's hard. It's a hard game.

765
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I played that. I played a little bit of Super Street Fighter, which I'm also apparently really bad at.

766
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
So I think I need to turn down the difficulty or something.

767
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
So, yeah, I was playing some of the games that collection.

768
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
It's interesting because they have like a little like tournament modes like you can actually play.

769
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
So I did the one for ghosts and goblins.

770
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:06,000
And it was basically like for this week, you're going to do this and you're trying to get the high score you can at like three times speed.

771
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:11,000
So you have to play the game at triple speed, which I mean, that game is impossible as it is already.

772
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
But try playing it on triple speed and then you get like these.

773
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I think they're like Capcom points. I don't know what they're called.

774
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,000
They have a name to them like these these little pink numbers that appear in the upper right hand corner.

775
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:29,000
And they unlock things like additional frames that you can put around the screens as you're playing them and things like that.

776
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:35,000
So I think it's it's cute. It was a little more than just, you know, pick a game from the menu and play it.

777
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:44,000
They really made sure the games are very customizable, that there's online modes where you can do different things and kind of mess with the game, I guess.

778
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Oh, and this is cool. The shooter games like 1943, you can play them sideways.

779
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:56,000
You can even do it on a TV, but it's great for when your switch is undocked because you can play a shooter game.

780
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,000
You can actually play it vertically or any of those Capcom games. That's pretty cool, too.

781
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:09,000
So, yeah, I recommend check out the collection. You can just play the free games that are out right now and then decide if, you know, it's worth more money to you for the other games that are in there.

782
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
So it's kind of fun. I enjoyed it.

783
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I've been continuing, of course, Final Fantasy 14. But what else is new? I play that game all the time.

784
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I've also been playing Final Fantasy 12. A lot of that. I talked about that a little bit last week. It's on Xbox Game Pass now.

785
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I am now past the point in 12. That's like the furthest point I've gotten to before.

786
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I got to Mount Buromis, I think is what it's called. And that is the point that I was left off at on a prior playthrough.

787
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:43,000
I'm really enjoying it. I feel like the story and the mechanics have really aged well.

788
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I think there's so much, especially being a longtime 14 player, there's so much in 12 that 14 took influence from, which of course makes sense.

789
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I mean, I've always said 14 is an evil-ese game, whether they want to admit it or not.

790
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:02,000
But also a lot of the development team from 12 worked on 14. It's very, very obvious.

791
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,000
So I just, I love 12. There's so many great things in it.

792
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:13,000
But I also played, so this weekend, Xbox was doing like a free Fusor weekend.

793
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
So the Harmonix game Fusor has been available this weekend for free.

794
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Time's almost up though, so if you haven't picked it up by now, I think you're kind of out of luck because probably at midnight Eastern is when it goes away.

795
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
But I don't know, somebody might know the exact time.

796
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,000
But basically if you have Xbox Gold, you can play Fusor for free over the weekend.

797
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
And so I finally checked it out.

798
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:40,000
And that is the music game where you're basically taking different tracks from different songs and overlaying them over each other.

799
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
And you want to do things on the downbeat.

800
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:51,000
And then as you progress, you learn like, oh, but certain, sometimes you want to do it kind of in the middle because that's the point when like the vocals really kick in.

801
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
So you get like a bonus for that.

802
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:59,000
If you can time when you're going to drop that Rick Astley record right so he can go, never going to give you up, you know.

803
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,000
I will say, and also it's drop mix, but it's a game.

804
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,000
I will say the technology of making your own mixes is a lot of fun.

805
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
And I think especially like the freestyle mode is a lot of fun.

806
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,000
The game is OK.

807
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:22,000
But like, you know, OK, I'm mixing in requests from the audience and I'm trying to time things perfectly on the beat.

808
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:37,000
It doesn't really have that same satisfaction, I guess, that something like playing amplitude or rock band rivals or something like it doesn't really give the same, I guess, satisfaction that some of those games bring.

809
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,000
But I really do love some of the creations that I've made in the game.

810
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Like I've really learned like, wow, Pump It Up or Pump It Up, Push It has a really great bass line that mixes with almost every song.

811
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:55,000
And like every single part of Donna Summer's Hot Stuff is great.

812
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
And you can mix it with literally anything and it sounds good.

813
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
So Donna Summer is a goddess.

814
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Yes, that is true.

815
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:11,000
That is true. And there's there's I will say the song list, even though when I looked at it, I was kind of it has been curated very specifically for songs that really work like that.

816
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
And I think that's done very well for them.

817
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:19,000
All of that being said, 60 dollars.

818
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
I get making games is expensive and licensing the music.

819
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,000
And it's not just licensing the music because they have stripped these songs.

820
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:34,000
I mean, you know, you have just the vocals, you have just the keyboard part and all this stuff like.

821
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I get that there's stuff with that. That being said, the game they are giving at the end of the day, I don't think I can justify 60 bucks for it.

822
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:51,000
It's too much. And then they have DLC and then they have these, you know, one hundred dollar editions with all these other songs and so forth.

823
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,000
It's just. It's too much. Sorry.

824
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:02,000
It's too much of a premium for what it is. I think once the game comes down to 20 bucks, I'll buy it for sure.

825
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:09,000
But I think this is where something like drop mix that was actually tangible, I can pick it up and take it to a friend's house.

826
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,000
It's a physical thing. You know, the card mechanic is really interesting.

827
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I think that's where the high premium cost lends itself a lot better when it's actually a physical thing.

828
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:28,000
So, yeah, I like Fuser, but I don't like it. Sixty dollars. I get that it's on sale right now for like 40.

829
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Still a little high for me for what it is. Yeah.

830
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:40,000
So fifth dream in chat says, I love the idea of the game, but the chances of them ever having a song I listen to it.

831
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Well, I will say, though, there's a lot of songs in it that maybe wouldn't be on my playlist of music,

832
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
but they're songs that I recognize.

833
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:57,000
And when you break them down and put them back together into new songs, I do have that whole reaction of, huh, that sounds really neat.

834
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Some of them have been garbage. I put together some real garbage songs, but I've put together some songs where I was like, I really like that.

835
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Loki, you especially. What's that? Can you save them?

836
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:16,000
You can. I haven't played around a lot with that, but I know there is like a big community presence in there.

837
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:24,000
And if you have your deck loaded a certain way, you can save it to a favorites thing so you can pop all the records in there automatically at some point.

838
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:31,000
So there are some little techniques they have for macro. But I was going to say, Loki, I know you did a lot of mixing and stuff back in the day.

839
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,000
I think you'd get a kick out of this game if you haven't played it yet. Again, I don't think I have.

840
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
You'd be pissed if you paid 60 for it. But yeah, I didn't want to pay 60 bucks for it.

841
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I think if they do another free weekend or it comes down in price, you should really check it out. I think you'd have fun with it.

842
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,000
All right. Yeah, let's check it out. So that was my gaming week. All right.

843
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:57,000
So let's get into some headlines. We've got a lot of stories to cover still, and we're an hour and a half in.

844
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,000
So we should get to these stories. So, Loki, I'll start with you.

845
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:11,000
So Microsoft has this brand new feature for some of the backwards compatibility games called Frame Rate Boost or FPS Boost, I guess is what it's called.

846
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:22,000
And it is right now supporting about five games. Far Cry 4, New Super Lucky's Tale, Sniper Elite 4, UFC 4 and Watch Dogs 2.

847
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:29,000
And they're going to be adding more games to that. Now, what that does is it allows certain games to run at a higher frame rate.

848
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:35,000
So, for example, some games that were previously 30 FPS are now 60 FPS.

849
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Or in the case of New Super Lucky's Tale, it actually runs at 120 FPS.

850
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:49,000
So apparently this is also something that's compatible with the Xbox Series S as well.

851
01:18:49,000 --> 01:19:00,000
So pretty awesome. They found some new techniques, I guess, with the DirectX part of that to be able to push higher frame rates at not much of a system cost.

852
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:07,000
So pretty cool to see some of that being added to some of these games. 60 FPS always makes things better.

853
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And I know like certain games like Watch Dogs 2, that looks pretty nice.

854
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:18,000
You know, one thing I didn't talk about during my gaming week is Pokémon GO because they had a huge event on Saturday.

855
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
And I am tying this to what you just said, Loki. I'm not changing the subject suddenly.

856
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:26,000
But I played Pokémon GO on Saturday because they had a huge event.

857
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:36,000
And it was a really good motivating event for me to like get out and go around town and drive around and walk around and really try to collect a lot of Pokémon really fast for all the collection challenges.

858
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:47,000
But one of the challenges because it was set up like the original Pokémon game where only some Pokémon were for the red people and some Pokémon were for the green people, you had to do some trading.

859
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:54,000
So I did some trading with Alan because it turns out you didn't have to get the Pokémon during the event to get credit for them.

860
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,000
So Alan hasn't really played Pokémon GO in a while, but he has a lot of old Pokémon on his account.

861
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:04,000
So I got to play Pokémon GO on his phone for just a little bit because I hadn't really seen it on his newest phone.

862
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:10,000
And I was like, the frame rate on your phone is so much better than what I'm getting.

863
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:19,000
And I'd heard something about for whatever reason the iOS version is frame blocked or whatever. I guess maybe it had optimization problems or whatever.

864
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:26,000
But I noticed it. So that is the part that ties into what you're saying. When you have like that higher frame rate and everything, you really do notice it.

865
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:35,000
It plays so smoothly. And I was like, man, I hope they figure it out on the other side so I can get the game this smooth because I know it's capable.

866
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:40,000
So Act Def says it's 120 hertz. Wow.

867
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Oh, wow. Anyway, I'm sorry. I don't know if you had anything else to say to that story, but I want to know that really.

868
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Yeah, that's about it. Yeah.

869
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Yeah. Microsoft isn't. You know, it's funny, especially considering there was a time when Microsoft was like, fuck backwards compatibility.

870
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
No one wants that. You know, that was under one leader.

871
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:05,000
And then they had a new leader who's paid a lot of attention to backwards compatibility and really kind of making the old stuff stronger.

872
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:12,000
And then even even things that are relatively newer, kind of, you know, making them even better through the latest technology,

873
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:24,000
especially when there haven't been a lot of like PlayStation five or Series X exclusive or optimized or whatever you want to call games that have come out yet of these new consoles.

874
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:30,000
It's nice to have these enhancements come out regularly that make the old games feel new again.

875
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:35,000
That makes sense. Yeah. All right.

876
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Act up to saying it's not necessarily the frame rate that's higher, but it's a different hurt setting.

877
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:47,000
It's so smooth. I love it. So the display refresh rate might be one hundred twenty hertz on his phone.

878
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Interesting. I don't even know what kind of phone he has. We're we're we're a bi-phonal household.

879
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I have an Apple phone. He has a Samsung phone. So we we love all types here in this house.

880
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Do you have a good phone? I like my phone. Fine.

881
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:05,000
So I'm saying you have a good phone. Yeah. Well, Alan would say he has a good phone, too.

882
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:10,000
He likes what he likes. I like what I like. All right. Anyway, let's move on.

883
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Let's talk let's talk about a good classic franchise. Let's talk about Silent Hill.

884
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Sadly, I have no news on Silent Hill, but I have news about the creator of Silent Hill, Kichiro Toyama, who created Silent Hill, Siren, Gravity Rush.

885
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:34,000
You may not realize he was involved with that, too. But of course, he left Sony in 2020 and he started his own company, Bokeh Game Studio.

886
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:39,000
And a little bit more information has come out about the first project.

887
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:46,000
And he says it is inspired by his past as a horror game designer. A video came out called Focus.

888
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,000
And in this video is kind of an interview and he talks about the creative process.

889
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:58,000
And there are some concept art that's shown for this untitled debut game coming from Bokeh Game Studios.

890
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:05,000
And so if you were into Siren or Silent Hill, you're probably going to be into what these guys are cooking up.

891
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Now, of course, some people are saying, well, is it Silent Hill they're making?

892
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:21,000
I'm not sure. I don't I almost wonder if it's a little bit like Igarashi and Bloodstained where it's like, we're not making Silent Hill wink.

893
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:29,000
We're making Loud Valley. Yeah, Loud Valley. Exactly. Or Quiet Mountain.

894
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:34,000
You know, it's going to be something, you know, very, very similar. But we'll see.

895
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I also, because I know this is another series, you talk a lot about Dark Sakura.

896
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:51,000
As part of the interview, Toyama talked about being interested in the trend of death game entertainment like Danganronpa or the anime franchise Mirai Nikki as being an inspiration for this.

897
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
So there could be some Danganronpa in your Quiet Mountain.

898
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:04,000
So interesting. The idea, the idea of regular people driven into irrational situations will likely show up in the game.

899
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Hmm. By the way, there was a rumor that Akira Yamaoka was making music for an upcoming game.

900
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Hmm. Hmm. Again, I have a feeling they're not making Silent Hill, but they're probably making Quiet Mountain.

901
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:26,000
So something to think about. Hmm. Anyway, of course, now, now everybody in chat has their own names.

902
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Sia Diberi says, Shh, Savannah.

903
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I picked Loud Valley because it's a quiet, it's opposite of Silent Hill.

904
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:41,000
I know, but I, I love, come on, tell me the name. Shh, Savannah isn't fucking funny. That's funny.

905
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
And it's kind of funny.

906
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:50,000
What was the other name? Moderately Loud Mesa. That's a good one, too. Quiet Country.

907
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:55,000
I love that you guys are all just lighting up with your knockoff names.

908
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:03,000
It's great. What I ordered online versus when it arrived. No, I know that that particular analogy isn't appropriate here because I'm sure the game will be fine.

909
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Are we making the Wish version of Silent Hill?

910
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:10,000
No, I don't want to put that label on it because, A, we haven't seen a frame of gameplay. We've only seen concept art.

911
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:19,000
And B, it might be really good, like bloodstains pretty good. So I, I don't want to necessarily say this is going to be a cheap ass version of Silent Hill.

912
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:26,000
It actually, it could be better. Let's give it that opportunity.

913
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Hushed Hollow. Sanctuary of Silence. Oh, good question.

914
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I play that.

915
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Orange Right in chat says, I'm sorry, I didn't credit Pod Culture for Hushed Hollow, Phoenix 7726 for Sanctuary of Silence.

916
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Orange Right is bringing up the cat ending. Yes. Well, here's the thing. In Savannah, you get a dog ending.

917
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:53,000
No, wait, no, the dog ending is Silent Hill. I'm sorry, cat ending is, never mind, I screwed that up. I get it.

918
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,000
And instead of a UFO ending, you get like a ghost ending.

919
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
You get a paranormal ending.

920
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,000
You get a werewolf ending.

921
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Sacred Jade. Pipe down planes.

922
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
All right.

923
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Sia Tabiri brings up, no, but apparently there's a Five Nights at Freddy's knockoff movie that just came out with Nicolas Cage.

924
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:23,000
And I watched it and it was awesome. You saw the movie? Really? I did watch it, yeah.

925
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Oh, wow. Now that looked like the Wish version, but like in the good way, where like Showgirls is unironically good.

926
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:35,000
It was, it was OK. It wasn't like.

927
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
It was, it was cheesy.

928
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I don't know. They had parts that were really good.

929
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:51,000
And then parts like, it's not a complete ripoff. It's, it's similar, but it's not the same.

930
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Sia Tabiri in chat says that Savannah has a guinea pig ending.

931
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,000
I know how to get Dark Soccer on board. How about a possum ending?

932
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Yes, it needs a possum ending. I'll play that.

933
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Yeah. So you can watch the movie. They have it available like through, I think, Voodoo right now.

934
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I think that's where I rented it. And it's like 20 bucks to watch Willy's Wonderland.

935
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Yeah. I'm waiting for those premium fees to fade a little bit because I want to see.

936
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Everybody is telling me because I love movies like cheesy comedies like Romy Michelle's High School.

937
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Everybody's telling me that I would love that Kristen Wiig movie. The Barb and Star go to Vista Del Mar or something like that.

938
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Speaking of movies, did you want to catch the trailer for Mortal Kombat?

939
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Oh, good question. Good aside here before we get to the next story. Yes, I did.

940
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:44,000
And it looks pretty cool. I mean, obviously you didn't like it.

941
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Ava and Melina. Oh, yeah. Where's your fights?

942
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Yeah, but they apparently they do have more for Melina. It's just they haven't shown that stuff yet.

943
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
But apparently she does look like the original.

944
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:02,000
That's why I'm trying to cut him some slack on two is that maybe there's more to it than just the one scene we saw.

945
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:08,000
But I'm not a big violent person, though, but whatever.

946
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Moral Kombat is so over the top. It's a little. But even like that scene with like Sub-Zero and Jax's arms, I was like, oh, God, that's too much.

947
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:21,000
You know, like, wow. But it looks good when they do a better trailer.

948
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I might be a little bit more excited about it. But the only thing that really looks exciting to me was them going into I mean,

949
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:35,000
it's clearly the original Sub-Zero, the one who was an asshole.

950
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:42,000
But I think I don't like the the audience insertion character call or whatever his name.

951
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Oh, yeah. Like what the deal is, they're fucking unnecessary.

952
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:54,000
We don't need it. We don't need a character insertion, you know, an audience representative in it,

953
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,000
because the people who are going to see Mortal Kombat, no fucking Mortal Kombat.

954
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Mortal Kombat. We don't need it.

955
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,000
They said they wanted to make a new character because they always introduce new characters in Mortal Kombat games.

956
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:10,000
I don't think. Yeah, I get it. Yeah, I agree with you. It's kind of stupid.

957
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
And where's Johnny Cage? They're saving Johnny Cage for the sequel.

958
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
They didn't want it. They wouldn't want to burn every character right away.

959
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I think that's what the deal is with Johnny Cage. Maybe Cole is new Sub-Zero.

960
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,000
I bet I bet there's a twist like that that happens. But obviously, I don't know.

961
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Obviously, I don't know anything. But but if they're sticking to any resemblance of canon,

962
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:39,000
then it's somebody else who's a different Sub-Zero. It would be another Lin Kuei.

963
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
So, oh, we'll see. No, it's just it's just terrible. Yeah.

964
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:48,000
And like Sacred Jade said, Sub-Zero becomes Bihan. Well, Bihan is Sub-Zero, but who also later becomes Noob Saibot.

965
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:56,000
So don't don't get me started on. I'm still pissed off about Sindel, OK?

966
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Yeah. Where was Sindel in that trailer? No, I'm pissed off about what the last game did to her.

967
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Oh, yeah. All right. Let's move on, though. Sorry, we had a quick aside, but that was worth bringing up because you're right.

968
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:11,000
I didn't have the trailer in a story slot. So. All right. Let's talk about game leaks.

969
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Well, Rare, I know a lot of folks here know about the origins of games and we all know that.

970
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,000
And if you don't know it, then you're about to learn a thing.

971
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Star Fox Adventures began as a game called Dinosaur Planet for the Nintendo 64, of course, by Rare.

972
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:40,000
And a game preservationist, Forest of Illusion, obtained a copy of the game fully playable.

973
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:49,000
I mean, some of the stuff is glitchy and doesn't necessarily play well, but it is the build from December 1st, 2000.

974
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:54,000
So it's a late build of the game and it needed a little work to be playable to the end.

975
01:30:54,000 --> 01:31:04,000
And so they actually have the ROM available for download through their Twitter.

976
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Actually, their main link on their website went down, so they put up another one, but it's available through their Twitter account.

977
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:20,000
But it was supposed to be like the big ending, you know, for the N64 was to have this game come out.

978
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:26,000
It had environments and dialogue that used the RAM expansion pack and it was a 512 megabyte cartridge.

979
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Would have been the biggest on the console. And, yeah, no.

980
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:38,000
This is, by the way, the same group that did the Zelda 64 beta earlier this year.

981
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Oh, OK.

982
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:49,000
I downloaded it, so we'll see how that goes. I don't have an EverDrive for my N64, but, you know, with a little bit of work, I could probably play it on my emulator.

983
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Yeah. It's interesting to see these relics from the past kind of show up, even though, you know, I know we get into dicey territory with what should we be looking at versus what shouldn't we.

984
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:05,000
But, you know, especially since this did kind of end up becoming something else anyway, I think it's an interesting part of gaming's history.

985
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
So I'm kind of glad it's at least preserved, if nothing else.

986
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:14,000
And the bits that I've seen of it, I thought it was going to be a great game.

987
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,000
I mean, it looks like it was supposed to be pretty good.

988
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:38,000
I mean, and the thing is, is that when the legend said that Miyamoto saw the footage and thought that it should be remade into a game with Fox McCloud, and that basically the team didn't really care for that idea a lot because they had to rewrite different places to accommodate Star Fox.

989
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:51,000
And then they had to change a lot of the game structure. But basically, you know, they were all really attached to Dinosaur Planet and had to change gears to put it in Star Fox.

990
01:32:51,000 --> 01:33:01,000
But to be able to go back and play what would have been the original game would have been great.

991
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:06,000
So I'm actually pretty excited about this.

992
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:17,000
You know, there were characters that were kind of small characters in Star Fox 64 that had bigger roles in Dinosaur Planet.

993
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:26,000
And then, you know, so you can play through it and see elements that made it into Star Fox 64.

994
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:31,000
But honestly, I think Dinosaur Planet would have just been fun on its own.

995
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:40,000
It was pretty annoying, pretty annoying, pretty annoyed that, you know, it was something that didn't come out.

996
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:51,000
And of course, there was also that playable build that they found of Goldeneye Xbox Live Arcade. So another leak.

997
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Yeah. All coming from the rare stuff. So, yeah.

998
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:02,000
All right. Well, let's move on with another story. Classic Game of the Week coming up. But first, Loki.

999
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Yeah. So there was this big Skyrim mod called Wormstooth that was developed back in actually quite a while ago.

1000
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:17,000
It was removed from Nexus mods back in 2016, apparently by the original author.

1001
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Now he has brought it back and has brought it back with a brand new trailer, which is pretty awesome.

1002
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:29,000
So one of the things I thought was actually kind of unique about this is the actual trailer itself.

1003
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:34,000
So he uses a text to speech A.I. to recreate the Skyrim voice actors.

1004
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:42,000
And it sounds really cool, which makes me think, you know, hey, when people are putting together these new expansions to the game,

1005
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:47,000
a lot of times they will have their own voice actors come in and do the lines.

1006
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Well, now they could just use this A.I. to generate basically the dialogue for the game using the original voice actors,

1007
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:04,000
which may get them in some hot water or not. Who knows? But it's pretty cool.

1008
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:10,000
So it's available now if you want to check it out on Nexus mods.

1009
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:15,000
All right. I have to get Alan's impressions on that because he loves the Skyrim mod stuff.

1010
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
So I don't know. That has to be on his radar. Yeah.

1011
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Wormstooth adds a whole new like island to basically explore and there's a bunch of side quests and stuff in there.

1012
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:32,000
They have new companions. You can get like a wolf follower and lots of cool stuff to go along with that.

1013
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:39,000
So it looks cool. I have to really go back in the more Skyrim again.

1014
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,000
It's been fun. My kid actually wanted me to get it for him.

1015
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:48,000
So I picked up a switch version as well. So they're going to be playing Skyrim.

1016
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:53,000
All right. Well, moving on to a story that's pretty frustrating.

1017
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Honestly, it's another Stadia story. I'm sorry, but they keep they keep taking headlines.

1018
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:07,000
What can I say? Apparently, the folks at Google that were laid off from Stadia were pretty shocked by the news because just the week prior,

1019
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:12,000
vice president and general manager Phil Harrison had sent out an email to everybody that said,

1020
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:19,000
great progress that the studios have made so far. And then the mass layoffs came just a few days later.

1021
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:30,000
An email that was sent by Phil Harrison said, Stadia Games Entertainment has made great progress building a diverse and talented team and establishing a strong lineup of Stadia exclusive games.

1022
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:41,000
We will confirm the SG&E, Stadia Games Entertainment, investment envelope shortly, which will in turn inform the SG&E strategy and 2021 objectives and key results.

1023
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Of course, five days later, they were all gone.

1024
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
No comment from Google on this whole thing as well.

1025
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:56,000
But I mean, it does also just bring add fuel to the fire where, you know, how the fuck does Phil Harrison still have a job right now?

1026
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:00,000
I'm just going to be blunt. How does Phil Harrison still have a job right now at Google?

1027
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Because if everybody else was getting cut, cut, he should have got cut, too.

1028
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Sorry about it, but this just kind of adds fuel to that fire as far as I'm concerned.

1029
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,000
So it'll be interesting to see what ends up in the coming months that come from this.

1030
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:23,000
So Jade Raymond also had said in a statement, by the way, after the layoffs, you know, kind of the nice PR thing.

1031
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
I don't think she said anything that you can read too much into.

1032
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:32,000
But I am proud of the team we built at Stadia Games Entertainment and the groundbreaking work on exclusive games to the platform.

1033
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:40,000
It was a difficult decision to take on a new opportunity, and I will be forever grateful to this team for everything we learned and achieved together.

1034
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Yeah. So that is unfortunate how that all went down.

1035
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Yeah. Actdeft in chat says, hey, you're doing great. Keep it up. Just not here.

1036
01:37:50,000 --> 01:38:00,000
That's unfortunate. All right. Hope those folks are able to find work that they enjoy within Google or somewhere else like Jade Raymond.

1037
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,000
All right. Moving on. And excellent counterpoint.

1038
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Sorry, I guess not moving on, but excellent counterpoint by Phoenix7726 in chat saying, how does Eves at Ubisoft still have a job after the sexual harassment scandals he covered up?

1039
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:20,000
And how did the CEOs at CD Projekt Red still have a job right now? I thought for sure one of them would be gone by this point.

1040
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Isn't that isn't that shitty how all the people in power just never want to leave power?

1041
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Because the shareholders like money and they don't really care about people.

1042
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Well, the thing is, Stadia is not making money.

1043
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Well, that's true. It's Google, though. So you don't invest directly in the stadium, invest in Google as a whole.

1044
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,000
And true, they're making money. It's just.

1045
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:52,000
They just spread themselves too thin with some of this stuff and do a half-assed job about it.

1046
01:38:52,000 --> 01:39:00,000
All right. Well, let's take a trip down memory lane to a time when development was a little bit simpler and at least it was a little more innocent, maybe.

1047
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:09,000
It's classic game of the week. And every week, dark soccer steps into the vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, maybe you kids should be playing this game this week.

1048
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Dark Sakura, what classic? Well, actually, I already know.

1049
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:20,000
So I can say you picked a classic among classics that I'm kind of surprised wasn't in your modern list earlier, actually.

1050
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:26,000
I seriously thought I had done this one to meet like I checked the classic game list.

1051
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,000
I don't know if you did. Yes, I double checked.

1052
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:33,000
I yeah, I'm usually fine with whatever you say.

1053
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,000
But then sometimes I'll have that nagging voice that is like, I swear we did this.

1054
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:46,000
And this one somehow wasn't there. Game is portal portal.

1055
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:51,000
And I even checked to see if I had just done the orange box, you know? No, no.

1056
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:55,000
But I did think I did. Narbacular drop. You did.

1057
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:00,000
So maybe that's what I was thinking of, which Narbacular drop is is pretty fun.

1058
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:11,000
But anyway, to go back into portal portal basically was a game that was developed and published by Valve in 2007 that was released with the orange box.

1059
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Came out on Windows, Xbox 360 and PS3.

1060
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:20,000
And of course, there's been other ports, including Mac OS, Linux and Android.

1061
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:29,000
It is a series of puzzles that have to be solved by teleporting through the game using the Aperture Science handheld portal device.

1062
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:40,000
And you get a talk to by GLaDOS, who is definitely, well, motivating, I guess.

1063
01:40:40,000 --> 01:41:02,000
I don't know. Chell is, and it's not Chell, it's Chell, as we've heard in various makings of, who is taunted by GLaDOS and still must go through the game and make it to the end through clever use of portals.

1064
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:07,000
But going back to a little bit of history of the game.

1065
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:25,000
The game was based on a concept from a game called Narbacular Drop that was created by members, by people at DigiPen Institute of Technology, and they were hired by Valve to make Portal.

1066
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:30,000
So Portal is actually the spiritual successor to Narbacular Drop.

1067
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
You can still play Narbacular Drop, by the way.

1068
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:49,000
So it was really lauded as one of the most original games to come out, which really says something because we don't really get a lot of people talking about originality.

1069
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:56,000
GLaDOS was voiced by Ella McLean, who is absolutely delightful and talented.

1070
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:05,000
And then, of course, we had one of my favorite hilarious singers, Jonathan Coulton, do the end song, Still Alive.

1071
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:11,000
I've always been a big fan of Jonathan Coulton, so of course I was really, really tickled.

1072
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:16,000
And I got to meet him. Remember when we went to PAX?

1073
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,000
He let me take all kinds of pictures with him. He was a really nice guy.

1074
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Anyway, so Portal has been even cited as one of the greatest games of all times.

1075
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Outside of Steam downloads, over 4 million copies of the game have been sold since its release.

1076
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:45,000
And there's merchandise, plus weighted companion cubes, and fans making the Black Forest cake because the cake is a lie.

1077
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Portal guns, and then there is a standalone called Portal Still Alive that was released on Xbox Live Arcade service in 2008 that had 14 more puzzles.

1078
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:01,000
And of course, Portal 2 in 2011, which we will talk about at another time.

1079
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Anyway, basically, like I said, you play Chell, you play first person, and you have to use the Portal gun to open an orange and a blue portal in different locations.

1080
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:23,000
So one, you know, you exit through whichever one and exit through the other.

1081
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:28,000
It's basically moving through three-dimensional space, but you also have physics to play along with it.

1082
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:41,000
For example, you know, if you want to fling yourself across a room, you can throw a portal on the top of the wall, like way above you,

1083
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:48,000
and then put a portal on the ground and jump into it, which would give you forward momentum to cover a large gap.

1084
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
They do call that flinging.

1085
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:58,000
And then, of course, you get reoriented because of gravity when you go into the right-hand portal.

1086
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:10,000
So you cannot pass one shot through an open portal. It will deactivate it, and then you have to create a new portal and a new offset.

1087
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:23,000
So basically, you can do things like move objects, and you have different wall services, and you can anchor in different places.

1088
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Sometimes they won't link to certain walls, so you have that to deal with.

1089
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:38,000
And then you're also given these little cubes that you can use to press down buttons and levers and, you know, use it to activate different mechanisms.

1090
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:43,000
And then when you're done, you have this particle field called the Emancipation Grill.

1091
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Actually, in the developer commentary, they called it Fizzlers.

1092
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:59,000
That would allow anything that you carry with you apart from, you know, yourself and the portal gun, and deactivate the portals in the previous room.

1093
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:04,000
They also will block any attempt to fire a portal through them.

1094
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:18,000
So Chell also wears these heel springs to keep from falling, which I believe they were called the Longfall Boots, or maybe the Longfallboots or Portal 2.

1095
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
No, they're Longfallboots.

1096
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Okay. And she, you know, she won't die from falling from a great height or anything, but there are other things that can kill you.

1097
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Balancing balls of energy, toxic liquid, deadly neurotoxin, and the turret guns.

1098
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Turret guns are hilarious and adorable, and I love them.

1099
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
I have a couple of little ones.

1100
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:52,000
And true story, when I was learning Maya in college, my final presentation was a portal turret.

1101
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:57,000
And my teacher liked it so much that he made me shaders and light sources for it.

1102
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
So I was pretty happy.

1103
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:08,000
So basically if Chell gets a certain amount of damage in a short period of time, she will die.

1104
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,000
But she does restore her health fairly quickly.

1105
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:16,000
And there are multiple solutions to the puzzles.

1106
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:25,000
I mean, yeah, you've got a main way to do it, but sometimes the fun of it is deciding on different ways to solve those puzzles.

1107
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:33,000
And then as you keep going, you'll get some different challenge maps.

1108
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Advanced chambers, you get when the game is completed.

1109
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:46,000
You have challenge mode, so you have to complete, like, test chambers with as little time as possible, or the fewest portals, or the fewest footsteps.

1110
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:50,000
The advanced mode are a lot more complicated.

1111
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:58,000
So basically you have your two characters, like I said before, and Chell is the silent protagonist.

1112
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:07,000
And then there's GLaDOS, that stands for Genetic Life Form and Disk Operating System, who is an AI who is obsessed with testing.

1113
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
And you must test. You have to test.

1114
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
And GLaDOS is also a liar.

1115
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Basically has just made up a lot of crazy backstory that may or may not be facts, such as Chell being adopted, an orphan, having no friends, and questionable.

1116
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:32,000
There is also a comic, which I actually super like, called Lab Rat, that talks about the gap between Portal and Portal 2.

1117
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:39,000
That basically where Chell was rejected as a test subject for having too much tenacity.

1118
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:48,000
And so they used Doug Rattmann. Then you actually get stuff for Rattmann in the second game, but he moved Chell to the top of the test queue.

1119
01:47:50,000 --> 01:48:00,000
So you're in this research facility, and in Portal 2 they said that it's in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

1120
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:08,000
And the lab is for Aperture Science, which was a competitor with Black Mesa.

1121
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Except that Kave Johnson, their founder, was crazy. He was supposed to make shower curtains for the US military, and he became mentally unstable for moon rock poisoning.

1122
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:28,000
And we'll get into more of that, because that's all backstory on there, but yeah. They were complete competitors with Black Mesa.

1123
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:36,000
And for the record, Pod Culture. Portal, that is not exactly how the line went. I'm a potato.

1124
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,000
I think it's, how are you doing? Because I'm a potato.

1125
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Because, anyway.

1126
01:48:44,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Anyway, so moving forward. As you keep going through the test, you come across a cube that has a heart on it, and it's the Weighted Companion Cube.

1127
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:11,000
And it has a heart on it, and it's your friend, but GLaDOS tells you it has to be euthanized through an emergency intelligence incinerator before Chell can continue.

1128
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:20,000
And then there's, you know, the turrets have these cute little voices, I don't hate you, you know. And then they're sympathetic when you kill them.

1129
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:30,000
And then the final chamber, this is the part where she kills you. Which was actually in Portal 2, there was a part called, this is the part where he kills you.

1130
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:39,000
So anyway, you keep having these signs for cake, and GLaDOS talks about cake, but the cake is really a lie.

1131
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:48,000
And you get to see graffiti as you're going through the game that has the statements such as, the cake is a lie.

1132
01:49:48,000 --> 01:50:05,000
You have pastiches of the Chariot by Emily Dickinson, and the Reaper in Flowers by Longfellow, and Emily Bronte's No Coward Soul is Mine, but referring to the death of the Companion Cube.

1133
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:16,000
So at any rate, you eventually escape through some clever use of portals, and you're playing behind the scenes, which is actually my favorite part of the game.

1134
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:28,000
I love going, I have this thing about games where I want to go to the places I'm not supposed to, and in this case the places I'm not supposed to go to are actually the places that you're supposed to go to in the game.

1135
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:47,000
So basically, spoiler alert, when you defeat GLaDOS, you're escaped, and then you get dragged away by an unseen entity in a robotic voice that thanks you for assuming the party escort submission position.

1136
01:50:48,000 --> 01:51:06,000
And then the final, final scene is you see the Black Forest cake, and the Weighted Companion Cube, and a mix of inactive personality cores, and then the cake gets, the candle on the cake gets snuffed. Just like that. Just like that.

1137
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,000
I like the speed runs where they actually get to the cake.

1138
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Valve became interested in it at the DigiPen annual career fair, and really wanted to bring them in and have them do work on it.

1139
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:58,000
So a lot of really crazy development went into it, and they were given pretty much free reign to make the game as they wanted to, basically without constraints.

1140
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:12,000
So they basically worked on gameplay without any narrative. They just wanted to have fun, but they wanted to know what the test chambers were leaning toward when people were playing it, so they came up with a narrative for it.

1141
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:27,000
And basically the game has this very clear beginning, clear middle, clear end with GLaDOS narrating the entire way as you go through it.

1142
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:36,000
And then they used the cake just as, you know, part of the developer process and just threw that in there because people like cake. As a joke.

1143
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:58,000
So they kept the settings very austere because they wanted to do the puzzles. They wanted there to be able to complete the puzzles without having too much decoration or anything nonfunctional.

1144
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:15,000
So they kept it pretty minimalist. I'll be honest, there are certain parts of Portal, even though they're not perfectly cubed out rooms, that kind of make me think of Cube. Have you seen that movie, Rob?

1145
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Oh yes I have. It's been a long time.

1146
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:36,000
But you know how in the different rooms in Cube, each of them will have their own little trap or challenge or something? And for the record, Hypercube is my favorite in that trilogy. The third one was shit and the first one was great, but I prefer Hypercube.

1147
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:42,000
I hear they remade the first one. They have a Japanese movie now. There's a Japanese version now.

1148
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:53,000
I'll have to look for it. I also liked Cube because it had Nicole DeBoer in it who was Esri Dax.

1149
01:53:53,000 --> 01:54:18,000
But anyway, I'm not going to get too much more into a lot of the development of the game. There is actually a walkthrough version with development points that you can hear commentary from the developers.

1150
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Basically, the Aperture Science Handheld Portal device, abbreviated as ASHPD, is also a shortening of the name Adrian Shepard, who is the protagonist of Half-Life Opposing Force. So that's kind of funny.

1151
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:47,000
And then the Black Forest Cake was chosen based on a Black Forest Cake at Regent Bakery and Cafe in Redmond, Washington as an easter egg in the game.

1152
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:55,000
And then the Regent Bakery since then stated that their Black Forest Cake has become their best-selling item.

1153
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:08,000
So it has a lot of music and it's very ambient, kind of mysterious, and it really just adds to the technical feel of the game like you're in a lab.

1154
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:13,000
And then, of course, Still Alive by Jonathan Colton was sung by Ella McLean.

1155
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:27,000
She's classically trained a pratic soprano. I've heard interviews of her doing actual opera, and I think that in the end of Portal 2 that was her singing as well.

1156
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:37,000
But you also get sort of up-tempo Latin versions of Still Alive playing over through radios and everything.

1157
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:46,000
And so you can get the soundtrack with the Portal 2 soundtrack. It's Portal 2 songs to test by.

1158
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:52,000
And you can get that via Steam Music or if you can find it to buy.

1159
01:55:52,000 --> 01:56:02,000
So basically, like I said, it was released with the Orange Box for Windows and Xbox 360 on October 10th, 2007, and a PS3 version on December 11th the same year.

1160
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:11,000
You could also just get the Windows version separately through Valve's service theme, and then they had a standalone retail one.

1161
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:19,000
In addition to Portal, the Orange Boxes included Half-Life 2, the two add-on episodes, and Team Fortress 2.

1162
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:29,000
And basically, no one knew what people were going to think of Portal. It was pretty safe to have it on there, but it was really popular.

1163
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:40,000
And then there was a demo version in January 2008 called Portal The First Slice that was free for any Steam user who was using NVIDIA graphics hardware.

1164
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:50,000
So it was like a little collaboration. And then there were test chambers 0 to 10, so there were 11 total.

1165
01:56:51,000 --> 01:57:01,000
And then it was also the first Valve game to be added to the OS X compatible list of games on the Steam client for Steam Play.

1166
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:11,000
So that was also very good. It was a free play title for Steam users during the first two weeks following the Mac client launch, so there was that.

1167
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:19,000
And then Portal Still Alive, I brought that up earlier. It had the original game, 14 new challenges, and different achievements available.

1168
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:26,000
And then, you know, don't forget, there's also been some Portal collaborations. Like, what was the Bridge Builder game that had a Portal version?

1169
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Oh, yeah, yeah. Bridge Simulator or something like that.

1170
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Yeah, Bridge Simulator or something like that.

1171
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Bridge Constructor.

1172
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:39,000
And at any rate, the game has been just absolutely adored. It got great ratings.

1173
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Metacritic gives it an aggregate score of 90 of 100. It's got 9s out of 10, 9 out of 10, 4.5 out of 5, you know, so it's been really just well received.

1174
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:59,000
And it's won many awards. I knew this one was going to be a long segment.

1175
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:09,000
It won the Game of the Year award, also Innovation Award and Best Game Design Award at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2008.

1176
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Glad I got Most Memorable Villain from GamePro. It's just, it's basically, it won a bunch of awards.

1177
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:27,000
And Time Magazine ranked it in 2012 as one of the top 100 video games of all time.

1178
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:33,000
And Wired considered it to be one of the most influential games of the first decade of the 21st century.

1179
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:42,000
So, stuff. I don't know what happened to my Weighted Companion Cube Fuzzy Dice. I know I had a pair.

1180
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:51,000
But there's so much merchandise. Like, I have a Weighted Companion Cube plush somewhere behind me. I have a...

1181
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
We don't have your cam up right now. We're still looking at the game.

1182
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Oh, well, I have one. My dice are somewhere. I have Weighted Companion Cube dice.

1183
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:08,000
You could get, like, Aperture Science mugs and stickers and all kinds of stuff.

1184
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,000
But you know what you can't get is Portal 3.

1185
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Hey, that's because Valve can't count to three.

1186
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Then again, Capcom eventually learned how to.

1187
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:26,000
But, you know, the cake is a lie has become, like, even people who never played it pretty much know what the cake is a lie is.

1188
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:32,000
There's a modding community around Portal that did their own test chambers and modifications.

1189
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:37,000
There's a group called We Create Stuff that had an Adobe Flash version of Portal called Portal the Flash version.

1190
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:45,000
It came out just before the orange box. And it actually was converted to a map pack for the final game.

1191
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:54,000
There is a mod called Portal Prelude that focuses on the pre-GlaDOS era of Aperture Science with crafty and challenging test chambers.

1192
01:59:54,000 --> 02:00:01,000
There's an ASCII portal. There is an unofficial port to the iPhone using Unity, but it only has one room.

1193
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:11,000
There's Mario that's with a Zero, which is a fan-made four-player co-op of... mashup of Super Mario Bros. and Portal.

1194
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:14,000
It's gonna be a six-hour show tonight if we cover all the mods.

1195
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,000
I know, I know, I know. I'm just going over some of the major ones.

1196
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:24,000
But basically, the original game had Chell just left in that parking lot.

1197
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:31,000
But the update had Chell being pulled back in by a party escort bot for the Portal 2 release.

1198
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
And you want to know what's great about Portal 2?

1199
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:36,000
It was released on my birthday in 2011.

1200
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:40,000
That's right. But you know what they haven't released is Portal 3.

1201
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Rob, because Valve can't count to three.

1202
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Well, it's just unfortunate.

1203
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:55,000
They're gonna have to talk to whoever helped Capcom with their developmental skills to teach them how to count to three.

1204
02:00:55,000 --> 02:01:05,000
I wanna know. Then we'll get Super Portal 2 Dreams Come True edition for matching service and all that stuff.

1205
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
What about Team Fortress 3?

1206
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Alright. I think we've covered all the angles of Portal.

1207
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:16,000
The classic game of the week. A real classic.

1208
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
I remember when this game first came out.

1209
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:22,000
And I think we kind of missed the orange box when it first, first came out.

1210
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:25,000
But then we started hearing all the hype about Portal.

1211
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:30,000
And we kind of went back and experienced Portal and it's pretty amazing.

1212
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
It's a wonderful game.

1213
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Alright.

1214
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Well, you know what's funny is that I had Becky over one time to play that one scene with the Lemons in Portal 2.

1215
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Oh yeah.

1216
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:52,000
But it's actually led to one of my favorite songs called the Ambition Song.

1217
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Where basically it sounds kind of like, oh crap, what's that name?

1218
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Oh, I can't think of his name. The dude that did Uptown Funk?

1219
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:12,000
No. And I'm thinking of Mark Ronson because he's also worked with him.

1220
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:17,000
But anyway, he had Bruno Mars. Thank you.

1221
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Bruno Mars. It's like I can sing it and I can't name the guy.

1222
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,000
He did that Lazy Song. You know, today I don't want to do anything.

1223
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:30,000
But they took kind of a mashup of that and the radio version of Still Alive, you know, with the horns and everything.

1224
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:35,000
And made a song that's nothing but Cave Johnson ranting, but rhyming.

1225
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:40,000
And that song is fantastic. It is one of my favorite things to come out of Portal.

1226
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,000
And I think, did Pod Culture just link it for us?

1227
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:47,000
So don't listen to it now. Listen to us. But that's the Lemons speech.

1228
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
I'll have to find the Ambition Song for everybody later.

1229
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:55,000
All right. All right. A longer segment than some runs of the game.

1230
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:58,000
But it is one of our all time favorites after all here at Orange Dance Radio.

1231
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:01,000
It's Portal, the classic game of the week.

1232
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Good, good, good, good pick. Again, surprised we haven't picked that one before.

1233
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:10,000
All right. Let's quickly travel around the world and check out some other quick headlines in rapid fire news.

1234
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Loki, we'll start with you.

1235
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:15,000
So For Honor is getting some Shovel Knight content.

1236
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Unfortunately, not Shovel Knight himself, but outfits and emotes, which I guess is kind of cool.

1237
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Those are going to be available in For Honor until March 4th.

1238
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:31,000
It's a limited time thing. So check it out.

1239
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:41,000
And then also, the company behind the game Minute is doing a kind of a racer spinoff of it.

1240
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:46,000
And it's for charity, which is pretty awesome. So you can check that out.

1241
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:53,000
I believe that's on itch.io called Minute Fun Racer.

1242
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:57,000
And it looked kind of cool. So 100 percent of the proceeds are going to charity.

1243
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Minute's a cool little title.

1244
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:04,000
It is. And the game looked pretty fun in the little racer as well. So check it out.

1245
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:07,000
All right. Going on to some headlines I have.

1246
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:10,000
I honestly thought this game had been canceled at this point, but it hasn't.

1247
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:15,000
It's New World, the MMO coming from Amazon Game Studios.

1248
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:25,000
This game was originally supposed to be out in May of 2020, and now it's slipped all the way to August 31st, 2021, a closed beta starting on July 20th.

1249
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Obviously, a lot went wrong with 2020.

1250
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:34,000
So I understand the multiple delays, but I thought the Amazon internal developments were having a lot of problems.

1251
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:37,000
But we'll see how the game turns out at the end of the day.

1252
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:43,000
So there's YouTube if you want to see a new interview with the game director, Scott Lane.

1253
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:47,000
But anyway, I might check that out when the beta starts. Well, it's a closed beta.

1254
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Maybe I'll get in it somehow, but I can always check out the full version when that releases in August.

1255
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Could be interesting.

1256
02:04:55,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Jason mentioned this in the intro tonight, but more media coming from more games.

1257
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:03,000
This one's a little surprising, though. Dota 2.

1258
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Speaking of Valve, and there'll never be a Dota 3, because why would there be? There's a Dota 2.

1259
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Defense of the Ancients, of course. Of course, this game is still huge.

1260
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:15,000
I mean, you know, so many people everywhere around the world playing this game.

1261
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Dota 2 is getting an anime series from Netflix. It's called Dota Dragon's Blood.

1262
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:27,000
This is the same studio animating it that did Voltron Legacy Defender, or excuse me, Voltron Legendary Defender.

1263
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:32,000
So that's kind of neat. It's an eight episode series, and it's going to come out worldwide on March 25th.

1264
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:38,000
So more gaming stuff on Netflix. Not that I think any of us are complaining.

1265
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

1266
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:45,000
There's a game actually that I was really into called Firewatch. It's a really good game.

1267
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:52,000
So on the Switch version, there's actually a little hidden secret game on it.

1268
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:59,000
And it's only on this one. So for the fifth anniversary of Firewatch,

1269
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Cable Sasser, who was the co-founder of Panic, shared a secret that has a note that was stuck to a random sign in the game.

1270
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:15,000
In which if you find it, you get a new location on the map that follows through,

1271
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:21,000
unlocks a game called Forest 64, which is a hidden N64 inspired platformer.

1272
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:26,000
And it looks like you play as a little bear, just like running around collecting stuff. It's pretty cute.

1273
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:29,000
You actually even get an achievement for it.

1274
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:34,000
That's crazy that this was in the game the whole time and nobody ever found it until now.

1275
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Only in the Switch version.

1276
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Yeah, only in the Switch version, which maybe is why people didn't find it,

1277
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:42,000
because they weren't expecting the Switch to have anything special for it. So who knows?

1278
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:49,000
And it is pretty convoluted the way to find it, but it's always neat to find these little treasures way after the fact.

1279
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Yeah, and also SNK is working on a Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Switch compilation.

1280
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:07,000
So that'll be cool. I mean, we would have, why can't I make words happen?

1281
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:13,000
SNK versus Capcom, match of the millennium. Hopefully we'll get a few other things.

1282
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:17,000
I mean, there's also going to be King of Fighters R2 and Samurai Shodown 2.

1283
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Last Blade Beyond Destiny, Fatal Fury First Contact, which I think I have all of those, I want to say.

1284
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:33,000
I know I have King of Fighters R2 and Samurai Shodown 2, and I know I have Last Blade because I fucking love Last Blade.

1285
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:39,000
But it'll be really cool to see those and I won't have to dig out my system to play it. So there you go.

1286
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:42,000
All right. Lots of good retro stuff there.

1287
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:51,000
All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some things that are coming out a little sooner than that Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection.

1288
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:55,000
World release dates. Let's start with Loki in the US.

1289
02:07:55,000 --> 02:08:01,000
So we've got Curse of the Dead Gods on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1290
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Horned Knight on PlayStation 4, Persona 5 Strikers on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

1291
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:17,000
Rogue Heroes, Ruins of Tasos, and that's on PC and Nintendo Switch.

1292
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:23,000
We Were Here series on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

1293
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Horn Knight also coming to Xbox One.

1294
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:33,000
We've got Cotton Reboot on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

1295
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Darius Cosmic Revelation on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

1296
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Forward to the Sky on Nintendo Switch.

1297
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Ghosts and Goblins Resurrection on Nintendo Switch.

1298
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Hellpoint on Nintendo Switch.

1299
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Wrath of the Aeon of Ruin.

1300
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
We've got that on PC, Mac and Linux.

1301
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1302
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Yakuza Like a Dragon on PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X, which is weird because I swear to God that was already there and I already have it.

1303
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:09,000
But apparently maybe a different version of that's coming out.

1304
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Bravely Default 2 on Nintendo Switch.

1305
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:17,000
And let's see.

1306
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:23,000
And finally, Horned Knight also coming out on PC and Nintendo Switch.

1307
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
I like how they staggered out throughout the week.

1308
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
And the Yakuza Like a Dragon thing, that's confusing.

1309
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Oh, that's for Japan.

1310
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,000
All right.

1311
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Which is weird. You would think they would have already have that.

1312
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Well, let's get to the Japanese release dates.

1313
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:39,000
Yeah, it's a busy week in Japan this week. There's a lot of stuff coming out.

1314
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:42,000
A lot of overlap with some of the things Loki just mentioned.

1315
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:45,000
On the Switch, Darius Cosmic Revolution comes out.

1316
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
One Step from Eden is also out this week.

1317
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Code Realize Wintertide Miracles in a regular and limited edition.

1318
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:54,000
The Cotton Reboot in a regular and limited edition.

1319
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:57,000
And yes, that's the same Cotton series that Dark Soccer has brought up a lot.

1320
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,000
So it looks like a new game in the series.

1321
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
It's got the X68000 version in it.

1322
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Oh, that's pretty cool.

1323
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
That makes me so freaking happy.

1324
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
I love Cotton.

1325
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,000
You might have to pick that up.

1326
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:07,000
All right.

1327
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:08,000
No, it's on my list to pick up.

1328
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,000
If you're going to buy a physical copy, though, it's through Strictly Limited Games.

1329
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Got it.

1330
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Also on the Switch, Forward to the Sky in a regular and limited edition.

1331
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:19,000
The Legend of Heroes.

1332
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Story of Seasons, Pioneers of Olive Town.

1333
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:26,000
And Kineiro Lovereach comes out.

1334
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
And Jinky Resurrection.

1335
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
That is just the Switch.

1336
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Going to the PlayStation 5.

1337
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Nothing this week in Japan, so it's a quiet week on the PlayStation 5.

1338
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Let me check the PlayStation 4, though.

1339
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Yeah, a lot of overlap there.

1340
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
The Cotton Reboot is out on PS4.

1341
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Darius Cosmic Revelation.

1342
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:48,000
There's a Kemco RPG selection, Volume 6.

1343
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:52,000
So yet another bundled collection of old RPGs in Kemco.

1344
02:10:52,000 --> 02:11:00,000
This includes Dragon Lapis, Lost Dragon, Alfadia Genesis, and Azdivine Kamura are all in that collection.

1345
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:03,000
We don't get any of those over here, I don't think.

1346
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:06,000
And then Jinky Resurrection.

1347
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Kineiro Lovereach is out as well.

1348
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Empire of Sin.

1349
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Yeah, busy week in Japan.

1350
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Lots of releases.

1351
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
How about the UK, Dark Soccer?

1352
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,000
A few things.

1353
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:20,000
On the 23rd, we have Persona 5 Strikers.

1354
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:24,000
We have Werewolf the Apocalypse, Earthblood.

1355
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:28,000
On the 25th, we have On the Road Truck Simulator.

1356
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
The Catch, Carp, and Course.

1357
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:33,000
On the 26th, Vetronom.

1358
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:34,000
That's on Switch.

1359
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Evoland, a Legendary Edition.

1360
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Aeternium X.

1361
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Dex, made of Scar, S-K-E-R.

1362
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Bravely Default 2.

1363
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Hellpoint Theme Park Simulator.

1364
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Balbabs Mausoleum, and Do Not Feed the Monkeys.

1365
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Alright.

1366
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Let's move on, and we will get a few more headlines for you guys before we get to the listener roundtable and the mailbag, which I think we have one extremely short email tonight.

1367
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:10,000
We'll see, though. I'll have Dark Soccer check that out.

1368
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Alright, meanwhile.

1369
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Loki, what do you have for us?

1370
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:23,000
So apparently, the Grand Theft Auto 3 and Grand Theft Auto Vice City games have had their source code revealed, or just say reverse engineered.

1371
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:29,000
So there's been a team that's been working on that for quite a while, and they finally have taken care of that.

1372
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:36,000
With that now, they've been able to port the games to several different platforms, including the Nintendo Switch.

1373
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Also, the Vita and Wii U, and so basically running those natively instead of via emulation.

1374
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Also, it's been ported to the PC, and then they're working on getting ported the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

1375
02:12:50,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Along with that, though, of course, in typical fashion, Take-Two has filed a DMCA takedown notice to GitHub to remove the reverse engineered games.

1376
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:11,000
I thought reverse engineering was legal, but they did the same thing with Mario 64 as well.

1377
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:17,000
But it's already on the internet, so it's always on the internet. It'll never go away. It's too late.

1378
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:27,000
That's pretty scary, though, that these games get their source code reverse engineered. What are they going to do next?

1379
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:38,000
I don't know, but it's interesting to see what they've been able to do with this.

1380
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:46,000
I'm curious to see what kind of upgrades we're going to get with these, because I know with Mario 64, people have added ray tracing into it, and all sorts of craziness.

1381
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:49,000
It'll be interesting to see what they do with this.

1382
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:58,000
One game that just doesn't stop getting updated is No Man's Sky. Of course, this is a game I've talked fondly about on this show before.

1383
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:04,000
It's a game I've really enjoyed, especially because they've really transformed it from what it was when it originally released.

1384
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Now they've put out yet another update, and this update is all about companions.

1385
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:19,000
Now you can befriend the little alien creatures on the planet. Before, you could at least feed them and ride them around on the planet a little bit.

1386
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Now you can go even further. The alien creatures that you meet, you can actually turn them into companions that will join you, I believe, off the planet as well.

1387
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:36,000
You don't just screenshot them and go to the next planet. You actually have them accompany you.

1388
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:47,000
You can train them to aid in exploration. You can have them find specific resources, provide light, find settlements, or even hunt some of the dangerous creatures.

1389
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:55,000
They can basically be your bitch in fighting some of the dangerous creatures on the planet, so it's a lot of stuff.

1390
02:14:55,000 --> 02:15:02,000
That just all came out for No Man's Sky, and like all the other updates, it's been free. Just another patch for the game.

1391
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:11,000
So, yet more to explore. Another reason for me to start from scratch. Can't wait. Alright. Moving on, DarkSakura.

1392
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Well, Bungie got themselves in some hot water for Destiny 2 Beyond Light's Season of the Chosen.

1393
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:38,000
They had a phrase being used in it that actually goes back to a slogan used in Nazi Germany, which I'll go ahead and say what it is, blood and honor.

1394
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:52,000
And they thought it would work for the game, and a lot of people were really, really put off by it.

1395
02:15:52,000 --> 02:16:00,000
So, yeah, they apologized for it. They immediately did that and removed it from the game.

1396
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Serious question. Don't the orcs in Warcraft say something like that too? I thought they did. I could be wrong.

1397
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:16,000
And I think there was something that this was in tandem with in Destiny 2 where the optics were really not good.

1398
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:20,000
It was on a completion banner.

1399
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Yeah, and it had to do with something else called the cleansing, where the optics of that was really, I mean, I'm sure they just made a horrible mistake.

1400
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:36,000
But, yeah, that's just, yeah.

1401
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:48,000
As SjoernerMatt says, someone didn't do their homework when they came up with it. At least they fixed it and didn't try to be all like, well, it wasn't what, you know, they just, it was pointed out.

1402
02:16:48,000 --> 02:17:01,000
It was fixed. Yeah, no, I don't, I really don't think it was done on purpose, but I think that people still need to be better educated on history in general.

1403
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:11,000
So that's a good point. If they didn't know anything about, they did this because they were ignorant to the situation and education would have helped prevent that.

1404
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:20,000
True, true, very true. All right, let's move on just a couple more stories before we get to the roundtable. But first, a story from Loki.

1405
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Yeah, I don't know why I didn't think of this myself, but apparently there's a developer that's out there that tried to put out some games on Steam, one of these being Emoji Evolution.

1406
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:46,000
And they decided to name their company on Steam as Very Positive. So, you know, the developer name happens to appear right above the review scores.

1407
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:58,000
And so you may see Very Positive and think, oh, Very Positive Reviews. But no, that's not the case. It's just that's the name of the actual, the company is Very Positive.

1408
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:06,000
And Valve was not too keen about them trying to be tricky like that. And so they banned them off Steam.

1409
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Did they prove that it was, I'm kind of team Very Positive on this. Like this is Valve's, why does it, why is it so easy to just put a name there? It's that's kind of Valve's bad design.

1410
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:34,000
Like, yeah, I'm not sure I am totally with the whole like, yeah, get them off of Steam. They exploited it. Maybe they wanted to name their company Very Positive Games. What's wrong with that? That's Steam's fault.

1411
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Yeah. And according to the developer, they said Valve fully understands how minor this trick is. It's more important to have a famous brand name like Obsidian there.

1412
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:56,000
They didn't think that there was actually going to be an issue with naming it that, but they said that they banned them due to review manipulations was the reasoning.

1413
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:06,000
So, yeah, I don't know. I mean, it's just interesting.

1414
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:16,000
It's like how when my siblings were doing video reports for school, they ended with, this has been an A plus production. Perfect.

1415
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:32,000
And ironically, ironically, though, like, so very, it's very positive, you know, this emoji evolution game, you know, even though I was kind of dogging on it, has mostly positive reviews, which is kind of funny.

1416
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:46,000
But I don't know, apparently they thought is, you know, it got pointed out. So, you know, maybe they could change it to Mostly Positive Games or something like that instead of just very positive as the name of the studio.

1417
02:19:46,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Seriously, very positive. I don't know. Anyway. All right. Well, something I'm not sure I'm meeting with positive thoughts is this news that Fortnite is now getting more characters, this time from Street Fighter.

1418
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:05,000
That's right. Favorites Ryu.

1419
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:06,000
My heart's broken.

1420
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,000
Favorites Ryu.

1421
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Skins.

1422
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:24,000
And Chun-Li are joining the Fortnite item shop so that you can dress your character like Chun-Li or Ryu. You know, since Chun-Li isn't going to be in Mortal Kombat at all, which by the way, I'll just quickly say on that article, that website knew exactly what it was doing.

1423
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:37,000
And every time you share that article, you're buying into it. That's all I'm going to say. There's, and I'm not saying that makes it right. That's just some of the like garbage stuff that makes the internet so broken right now.

1424
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:48,000
But I must say that website knows exactly what was doing that story. That was that was not somebody. If you actually kind of go through and read the article, there's coded little gags in it where they actually talk about.

1425
02:20:49,000 --> 02:21:00,000
It's the biggest street fighting championship when they're talking about Mortal Kombat. Like there's there's all sorts of code in it where they knew damn well what they were doing by getting gamers to rage retweet that.

1426
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:12,000
So stop and think about that a little bit next time again. And I'm not perfect with this. I have to remind myself, there's been articles I've retweeted that I probably shouldn't have. But I let things like this be a little bit of a lesson.

1427
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Anyway, sorry, I had to do that quick aside because it of course, the doc of Chun Li doesn't just bring to mind a great Nicki Minaj song, but it also brings to mind this article that was out there last week.

1428
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Anyhow, Chun Li in all her glory and Ryu will be coming to Fortnite. And yeah, I mean, it's not the first time we've had gamer characters from other games in Fortnite. Kratos, of course, and Master Chief, both already in Fortnite when the PS5 got their version and the Xbox Series X got their version.

1429
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
And so on. So.

1430
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
And that's not all, right?

1431
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Oh, did I miss something?

1432
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Yes.

1433
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Go ahead.

1434
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,000
So you know what else is coming to Fortnite?

1435
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Oh, no.

1436
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,000
This might get your attention a little bit more.

1437
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
Yeah, I heard. Okay. Yeah, go ahead.

1438
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Tron outfits.

1439
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Yeah. That was that was in last week's news. I thought I had mentioned at some point. But yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Tron is coming as well. And I just kind of let out this big sigh.

1440
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:11,000
I think the sigh that Dark Soccer just put out, I've kind of matched that with the Tron news.

1441
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
Yeah.

1442
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:17,000
All right. Whatever. It's what the kids are into. You know what?

1443
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:28,000
You know what? I'm going to I'm going to just suck it up and take the high road if it gets one more kid out there to want to watch the Tron movies.

1444
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:34,000
And I would say really the old one. But you know what? The new one's great, too. The newer one is great, too. The one from 2010, Tron legacy.

1445
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:41,000
If it gets more kids to watch those movies, you know what? Okay. Okay. I'll accept it.

1446
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:47,000
So. All right. S2100 Matt says apparently Peter Griffin is coming as well. Is it for real?

1447
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:48,000
No one cares.

1448
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:51,000
That would be hilarious.

1449
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
Fortnite is a very interesting pop culture blender.

1450
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
I would totally watch that.

1451
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:59,000
I want Beavis and Butthead at this point. Why not put parody and parody?

1452
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:02,000
All right. Yes, absolutely.

1453
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:07,000
All right. That is it for the news that we have scheduled. How about the roundtable?

1454
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:13,000
I'd like to open it up to our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network for any questions that they might have.

1455
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:19,000
But also open it up to our email every week. We invite your emails at participate at orange lounge radio dot com.

1456
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:23,000
And we'd like to read our favorites here on the air. How many do we have tonight?

1457
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Dark soccer one. It's it's and it's it's you read it in one breath, but that's okay.

1458
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:31,000
I actually actually I love the question. So let's get to it.

1459
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Well, it's one that's definitely going to send me on a journey.

1460
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:41,000
I'm excited. So what is the best video game font? And this comes from D.

1461
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:46,000
You forgot where D is from Waterloo. I was defeated.

1462
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:49,000
You won the war. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

1463
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:54,000
I have to. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not sorry, but I'm sorry. All right.

1464
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:59,000
So, OK, D, I actually I actually legit love this question, though.

1465
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:03,000
And dark soccer, you are the one who, you know, went to school for this.

1466
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:07,000
So, of course, I'm going to start with you. What is the best video game font or what?

1467
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:11,000
I'm sorry. What what video game has the best font? I think was the question.

1468
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Well, see, this is still loaded question because a lot of video games will use multiple typefaces.

1469
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:20,000
There's title faces. There's in-game dialog faces. There's all kinds of things.

1470
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Now, one of my favorite dialog faces is called Humming.

1471
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:31,000
And it is the typeface that has been used in the Animal Crossing series.

1472
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:37,000
I think since Wild World, I want to say. And I actually have this fun.

1473
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:43,000
I mean, it's a legit, you know, real typeface. And it's it's really beautiful to type with, really beautiful to lay out with.

1474
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:50,000
I really enjoy that one. The title font that they use is.

1475
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:57,000
It's very similar or maybe a modification of one called Think Heavy, F-I-N-K,

1476
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:04,000
and just has a lot of personality, but Think Heavy is a true type font.

1477
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Still, they're charging for it. So as far as other ones, like for titles,

1478
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:21,000
some of them are just like so fucking generic, you know, like I like the the PlayStation font,

1479
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:27,000
but there are some games that will do like the movie thing and try to go with like Trajan,

1480
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:34,000
which is on like the cover of almost every I'd say movie from before five years ago,

1481
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:39,000
I would say there's actually a video on YouTube called Trajan is the movie font.

1482
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:45,000
But I like when they go with something that isn't too generic, like I like a Helvetica,

1483
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:48,000
but I like when they do something that's got a little bit more personality to it.

1484
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:55,000
You know, that's why I've always really liked the the the humming font for Animal Crossing.

1485
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:59,000
I just always have thought it was a really enjoyable font to use.

1486
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:04,000
So this is to say, you know, whenever you bring up fonts, somebody is going to make a joke.

1487
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:07,000
And Phoenix 7726, of course, says Comic Sans.

1488
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:10,000
But let me ask this question. I ignored it on purpose.

1489
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Has any video game actually tried to use Comic Sans or Papyrus?

1490
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Not to my knowledge, at least.

1491
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Well, I'm sure indie games have, but like published games, I don't think they have.

1492
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
I don't know. Off the top of my head.

1493
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Oh, Pixelbook says The Sims used Comic Sans and Undertale had a character named Sans and Papyrus.

1494
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.

1495
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:38,000
But Capcom's font is ITC Corinna, K-O-R-I-N-N-A.

1496
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:41,000
I've always liked Fares.

1497
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:52,000
There's also Eurostyle, which is one that the VOG font is based out of, was used in a few different games, too.

1498
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:59,000
There's also the Mega Drive font that Sega used was Corporate IMG.

1499
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:04,000
I was just saying, because you're getting into where my answer to this question would go,

1500
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:10,000
is like, I don't necessarily think of just one game, but there's something about, especially in the classic 8-bit era,

1501
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:14,000
there were a lot of games that shared fonts, usually from the same company.

1502
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:17,000
For example, you play Konami games back in the day.

1503
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Whether it was Simon's Quest, whether it was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, whether it was Metal Gear,

1504
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:25,000
they all used like the same font.

1505
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Capcom games all shared the same font in the 8-bit era, and I think Tecmo had a very unique font

1506
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:37,000
that was very representative of, like, you're playing a Tecmo game when you see this.

1507
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:45,000
There's one in particular, though, that's been used by many games, both Japanese and English, called Cartoon 12.

1508
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Cartoon 12 is a bitmap font that was designed by Steve Capps, his Apple programmer,

1509
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:56,000
first used in the Mac game through the Looking Glass in 1984.

1510
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:00,000
It was never officially released. There were shareware versions of it,

1511
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:08,000
and then there was a version in DOS Deluxe Paint 2 by EA, where it was just called Comix, C-O-M-I-X,

1512
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:12,000
and it's been used in, actually it was used in Mortal Kombat.

1513
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:19,000
It was used in Puyo Puyo, I think Puyo Puyo Pocket.

1514
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:26,000
I'm just trying to think of a few other games, I mean a bunch of games fucking used it.

1515
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:36,000
I'm trying to think of, yeah, actually I think that the handheld versions of Samurai Shodown used it, I think.

1516
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Some of the Disney games used it.

1517
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:51,000
The Qbert logo was done in Cooper Black, which Cooper's like the font that they would always use on the back of team jerseys,

1518
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:54,000
like the FamA team jerseys.

1519
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:59,000
The Othello font was used for the Famicom Disk System.

1520
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:06,000
I'm trying to think what else, I mean there's like a few regular fonts that you'd see in the last stuff,

1521
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:13,000
like Coleco used Optima for their video game system.

1522
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:19,000
Optima is another one that I love using, but it's kind of an expensive one if you're just going to go flat out and buy it.

1523
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:28,000
Overwatch used Futura in some of their text on there, which is a font that I lay out stuff in all the time.

1524
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Obviously, again, Darcyra, I knew you would have a lot to say on this question because there's a lot of different,

1525
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:39,000
you've kind of really studied a lot of this stuff, but I actually want to check in with Loki real quick on this question,

1526
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:45,000
see if you have an answer, but I want to ask a second part for you, Loki, because we're talking about all these companies that have used stuff.

1527
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Well, now you get to speak from the perspective of Game Designer, and I'm curious, how did you choose the look for Pixel Poops number two?

1528
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:59,000
And because obviously you do have things like in the interface, you know, in a certain font, how did you pick that?

1529
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:05,000
So two-parter, do you have any, you know, again for the emailer, do you have any favorite fonts yourself?

1530
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:08,000
But how did you pick what you would go with for Pixel Poops 2, Loki?

1531
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:13,000
I just was looking at arcade fonts and I made something kind of similar to that.

1532
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:22,000
As far as, yeah, there wasn't really much choice because it's an 8x8 font, so you're kind of limited to what you can do with 8x8.

1533
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:23,000
True.

1534
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:31,000
I'd say my favorite one is probably, I don't know what the actual font name is called, but it's Pricedown.

1535
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:36,000
It's the Grand Theft Auto logo or the Price is Right logo.

1536
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
Oh, okay.

1537
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Yeah, that'd be my favorite.

1538
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:44,000
I never, it never really clicked for me that those two things use the same font, but you're right.

1539
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:47,000
The Price is Right and Grand Theft Auto are like in the same font.

1540
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:48,000
Yeah.

1541
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:49,000
It's funny.

1542
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:50,000
Okay.

1543
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Sorry, Dark Soccer, but I had to get, I had to get that perspective too.

1544
02:30:52,000 --> 02:31:01,000
But any, any other little information nuggets for our emailer?

1545
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:15,000
I'm still a big fan of Carina, but that one also has a lot of history for it because the, the original type version was invented in 1904 and Capcom has been using it for some time.

1546
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Ooh, I know what's iconic and I don't know what the font is, but it's iconic is the font that Activision used on all of their Atari 2600 games, not the games themselves, but the box art.

1547
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:31,000
The box art all had the title in this very bold font.

1548
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:39,000
The cartridge labels were all in the same font and like in a very, like it was like always like white text on a very colorful background.

1549
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:44,000
So if you had them all like stacked up on the shelves, like you knew these are the Activision games because they all look similar.

1550
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:51,000
I mean, the Atari games had a font too, but they didn't look as good cause they always put like dark on dark, but the Activision stuff really stood out.

1551
02:31:51,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Um, it was, there's was a custom font, um, but it was modified from another one and for the life of me, I can't remember what it was.

1552
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:01,000
That's okay.

1553
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:12,000
We've given this emailer like way so much information, but I'd like, I knew this, it would spark this kind of discussion and like, I'm like, dang, that is a question no one's asked in 857 episodes.

1554
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:13,000
So it's good job.

1555
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
Like that's a really good question.

1556
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:16,000
Oh yeah.

1557
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
But no, there, that was a pretty classic one.

1558
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:21,000
Gosh, I wish I could, I know people have done versions of it.

1559
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:22,000
Yeah.

1560
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Um, probably at dafont or something.

1561
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:25,000
Yeah.

1562
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:26,000
Yeah.

1563
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:27,000
But, um, but yeah.

1564
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:28,000
All right.

1565
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:29,000
All right.

1566
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Well, okay.

1567
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:41,000
So for the record there, I just found a page called the game font database and it got apparently a lot of, uh, fonts used by different companies.

1568
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:42,000
That's cool.

1569
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:43,000
I'll link it in chat.

1570
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:44,000
Nice.

1571
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:45,000
All right.

1572
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Well, thanks for the email.

1573
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:50,000
And if you can think of a good question, we haven't been asked in 857 episodes or you know what?

1574
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:51,000
It's fine.

1575
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:54,000
If you ask one that we got asked a hundred episodes ago, we probably won't remember.

1576
02:32:54,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Uh, send us an email, participate at, uh, orange lounge, radio.com and Phoenix 77 26 says dark soccer is a fountain of knowledge, but I'm bump.

1577
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:09,000
You know what?

1578
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:10,000
What?

1579
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
I'm a typography nerd.

1580
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
I like big fonts and I cannot lie.

1581
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:15,000
All right.

1582
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:19,000
Uh, but an ultra light's okay too.

1583
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:20,000
Uh, all right.

1584
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:26,000
Um, as the show and her mat says, how do you type with boxing gloves on your hands?

1585
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
Very difficult, very difficultly.

1586
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:31,000
You don't, uh, or with a very big keyboard.

1587
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
It's a strong, bad thing.

1588
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:36,000
Oh, that was a strong, bad thing.

1589
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:37,000
Totally missed the reference.

1590
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:38,000
Yeah.

1591
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:40,000
All right.

1592
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:44,000
Um, I think that is probably about it for everyone that we know.

1593
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:49,000
We don't have any other emails and outside of that question, that was just a strong bag joke in disguise.

1594
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
I didn't see any others pop up in chat.

1595
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:52,000
You have a couple other minutes.

1596
02:33:52,000 --> 02:34:00,000
So if you have something you want to get out there, cause I will ask Loki if there are and dark soccer, if there's any other last minute stories they want to get into for tonight.

1597
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:01,000
Not me.

1598
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Um, sure.

1599
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:16,000
So apparently like, like a Phoenix rising from the ashes, uh, soldier boy has posted yet another game console concept on his Instagram.

1600
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:21,000
I can only assume it's another Chinese clone console because it looks like a Chinese clone console.

1601
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:25,000
So I guess we'll just have to wait and see until someone recognizes it.

1602
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:32,000
But he claims it's a building, a brand new console from scratch, all new design, all new games, all new deals.

1603
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:36,000
Let's make history girls like all the other ones.

1604
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:37,000
Girls stop.

1605
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:38,000
That's all I have to say about that ever happened.

1606
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:39,000
Girls stop.

1607
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:42,000
So yay.

1608
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Something to look forward to.

1609
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:47,000
Um, Bobby Black Wolf is bringing up in chat by the way.

1610
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
Did y'all cover that in television?

1611
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:52,000
Amico got delayed from April to October.

1612
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
It probably didn't hit any news sites.

1613
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:59,000
Now from, well, I got the email cause I, I, I pre-ordered, bought, prepaid, whatever.

1614
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Uh, one of those, uh, now from April 3rd, 2021 or four, three, two, one, two, 10, 10, 21.

1615
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:07,000
Yeah. Um, thanks for bringing it up.

1616
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:08,000
You're right.

1617
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:15,000
It didn't, it didn't make the show roll because honestly they just delayed it and that YouTube they put out was a lot.

1618
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Um, they didn't really show any games.

1619
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:25,000
Um, I, I still think there's a market for the Amico and I think there's a lot of people dunking on it that, um, probably don't need to be.

1620
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Um, and I think there could be some really good stuff that I think a lot of, and I've told Aaron, he should look into or why we are, he should look into developing for Amico.

1621
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:43,000
I don't know if anything ever came of that, but, um, and I don't know how kindly they would take to pixel poops, but obviously he's made other games like super multitasking and that stuff that would be great for it.

1622
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:52,000
But that aside, I mean, and I would encourage not just, you know, why we are, but maybe other indie developers who are having a problem, maybe getting noticed on the steam marketplace.

1623
02:35:52,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Um, you know, say what you will about Amico and Intellivision, but you know, having a personality like Tommy Tallarico behind it knows how to kind of talk up and hype up the product.

1624
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:06,000
So it could be, it could be a chance to, you know, get things seen.

1625
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Um, obviously the delay is disappointing, but I also kind of start to wonder because we've been seeing a lot of the same games and the footage for those.

1626
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:26,000
I almost wonder if they had released 10, 10, 20, would they have had the games coming out to really carry them through the next year?

1627
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Maybe this is going to better position themselves, but I know, especially for being such a small company, the pandemic's probably hit them pretty hard in the development.

1628
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:46,000
And of course, you know, obviously they're, they're having problems making PlayStation fives and series X's with all these chips, obviously, you know, it's not all the same chips, obviously, but they're going to have problems supply when it comes to the Amico.

1629
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:57,000
So like, I get the delay from that perspective. I'm not an angry customer or anything. The pandemic has fucked everything and everyone. Like it's just, you know, things are going to get delayed.

1630
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:16,000
I just hope it positions in television for longer success and the long game and a stream of newer games that come out because without it, that thing is going to, you know, it's, it's not going to do well if they don't continuously have new games to put out there and talk about in the news and all that stuff.

1631
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:28,000
So, all right. Anyway, Bobby does say they've been showing new games every week on their YouTube channel. The only ones I've seen that ended up catching my eye break out, I've seen like three different times now.

1632
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:37,000
And then there was that platformer game that was a revival of an old title where the whole trick was you flipped it from night to day and stuff.

1633
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:48,000
I can't remember the name, but it looked cute, but it did look like a mobile phone game on your TV a little bit, but I don't know if that's necessarily a bad thing.

1634
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:59,000
I know that sounds very sacrilegious, but one game we all never shut up about is Pokemon Go. That's a mobile phone game. Now, I wouldn't want to play that on my TV, but they make decent games.

1635
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:08,000
They make decent games for the phone. Like that Sayonara Wild Hearts was started as a phone game and ended up on Switch and all this other stuff. So we'll see. We'll see.

1636
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:11,000
Anyway, sorry. Go ahead, Loki.

1637
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:24,000
No, I was going to say, I, while, yeah, that looks, it's all about the art style. Like, I don't know, I, the motion graphics stuff that they kind of do nowadays, you know, with kind of tweaking sprites.

1638
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:33,000
Like I know the style that it looks, it's very much like a mobile game, especially when you're talking about advertisement stuff. It's all about really the gameplay though on those.

1639
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:50,000
Um, and I haven't really seen a whole lot yet. They get me super excited about the, um, the new console, but yeah, I'd be curious to see how to develop for it, but I don't know whenever it would happen, if it would ever happen.

1640
02:38:51,000 --> 02:39:01,000
All right. Well, let's note the date and time. Loki said he's curious about developing for Amico. All right. Anyhow, any other last minute stories?

1641
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:03,000
No, that's it.

1642
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:17,000
All right. Then I think it is about time we end the show, but not before I thank all of you for tuning in tonight. Thank you for, uh, tuning into Orange Lounge Radio, whether you were here live at twitch.tv slash vog network, or you were listening on our podcast feed.

1643
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:30,000
We appreciate you guys being here with us every week. Um, we, you don't have to give us money for, uh, I mean, but if you want to three via bits and subs or shopping in our shop over at vog network.com slash shop and buying some merch.

1644
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:39,000
We would suit. We're not going to say no to that. We'd appreciate it, but all we really want is, uh, tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

1645
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:50,000
But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, then what, what can we do? Um, speaking of shopping, kind of, I should give a shout out here for, um, the, on, on the Twitch channel.

1646
02:39:50,000 --> 02:40:03,000
Uh, when there's a stream going on, you can actually donate, uh, the vog points or the points on Twitch. You can actually donate right now to Bobby is trying to put on a VHS gaming tape stream.

1647
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:18,000
So he found like a bunch of old tapes from the nineties. Um, and if we can get a hundred thousand points raised, which is, is, is not as hard as you think, um, he's gonna, uh, put those, uh, an air, some of the content from like old and stuff.

1648
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:30,000
We're already up to 74 K. So, um, we're looking good. Um, if you click on the little icon that has the points, it looks like a little bubble, I guess next to the, you click on it.

1649
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:41,000
And then like the very first option will say the gaming tape stream 23 days left, and then you can donate a, however many points you want a maximum of 200 points. So, Oh, you figured it out.

1650
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:53,000
You figured it out. Loki now we're at 76,000. There you go. So, all right. Um, so hopefully look forward to that stream soon. So, and we're trying to come up with other ways that you guys can spend your points.

1651
02:40:53,000 --> 02:41:03,000
Uh, so stay tuned for all that good stuff as well. So, all right. Um, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts and I will go to dark Sakura for your final thought first.

1652
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:10,000
Um, I am in one of those moods where I want to watch mid Samara again and drink.

1653
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:13,000
That movie is great.

1654
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:17,000
My, oh, go ahead. Loki. I'll have you go next.

1655
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:35,000
Um, my final thought is I'm, I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do next. So I have a few ideas, but I may, I may actually just go back to working on a pixel poops number two and to get ready for the console version or the cartridge version of that.

1656
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:50,000
All right. And my final thought, um, my mom's 80th birthday would have been this upcoming Tuesday. So obviously she's on my mind a lot this last week and honest, not just this last week but always, especially ever since she passed.

1657
02:41:50,000 --> 02:42:02,000
But just wanted to acknowledge that and just dedicate the work that I'm doing here on OLR tonight and pretty much every night to her memory. So that's it.

1658
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:17,000
Um, I hope that doesn't end it on a downer though. It's not a downer. I'm actually trying to look at that as a very positive thing. So I hope you guys all have an amazing week and, uh, place a lot of games, um, and have a lot of fun online and, uh, don't go crazy though.

1659
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:27,000
Okay. Cause those are real people that you're playing against and we'll see you in seven days to talk when it will be March again, but for real this time and we can talk all of, Oh no, I'm sorry.

1660
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:38,000
Actually, I'm sorry. We have one more show because it'd be the 28th. So in two weeks we'd be in March. So next week we'll still be in February and we can think about how March is coming so quickly again, but this time in 2021.

1661
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:42,000
Have a wonderful week, everybody. We'll see you in seven days. Good night.
