00:00.000 --> 00:13.720
Last week's article about the rumored shuttering of Konami's games division, called a re-shuffle,

00:13.720 --> 00:17.080
was an interesting one, especially in the face of their ongoing Pockyslot and Bimani

00:17.080 --> 00:18.080
series.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.320
And pro-evolution soccer staying power, I suppose.

00:20.320 --> 00:24.280
Calling all keyboard enthusiasts, get those MIDI keyboards out of storage and play nostalgia,

00:24.280 --> 00:26.880
if you live in Japan or otherwise know what you're doing.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.320
This has been your Bimani News Update for February 2021.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.440
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to bring you more

00:32.440 --> 00:35.160
on this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where

00:35.160 --> 00:37.160
every gamer has a voice.

00:37.160 --> 00:44.720
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

00:44.720 --> 00:46.840
every gamer has a voice.

00:46.840 --> 00:52.560
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and Bimani updates are always welcome here, just for the record,

00:52.560 --> 00:55.860
because that is of course where the show has its roots.

00:55.860 --> 01:00.820
Where myself, Dark Sakura, and Loki got our start playing Dance Dance Revolution at the

01:00.820 --> 01:05.700
local arcade many many years ago, about 20 years ago at this point.

01:05.700 --> 01:06.700
Anyway, hi.

01:06.700 --> 01:11.540
Welcome, I'm Rob Roberts and it's episode number 855 of our show for this February the

01:11.540 --> 01:14.580
7th of 2021.

01:14.580 --> 01:18.820
Not joining me tonight unfortunately, Dark Sakura or Jamie Sommers, she has the night

01:18.820 --> 01:22.700
off, she was feeling a little bit under the weather, so she'll be in a pre-recorded segment

01:22.700 --> 01:26.500
a little later on, but we will not be hearing from her live sadly.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.380
But she'll be here with us next week.

01:28.380 --> 01:34.100
But who is joining us live tonight is our good old pal Loki, who I think has been having

01:34.100 --> 01:35.340
a very busy week.

01:35.340 --> 01:36.340
Hi Loki.

01:36.340 --> 01:38.220
Yeah, it's been busy.

01:38.220 --> 01:44.600
I keep seeing your Twitter, and you're like, I'm giving myself crunch day, I'm taking a

01:44.600 --> 01:48.260
day off of work to work on Friday.

01:48.260 --> 01:53.500
And I did, and Saturday, and pretty much mostly today.

01:53.500 --> 01:59.980
Wow, so yeah, and I didn't realize until kind of the middle of the week that you and Aaron

01:59.980 --> 02:06.780
or YYR were really committed to the February 10th release date for Pixel Poops, which we've

02:06.780 --> 02:09.500
been hyping up for the last few weeks on this show.

02:09.500 --> 02:13.020
For whatever reason, this is your first Orange Lounge radio.

02:13.020 --> 02:17.740
This long running gag here on the show are these dream games, like we'll throw out this

02:17.740 --> 02:20.740
crazy idea and be like, that should be a game.

02:20.740 --> 02:26.140
And well, one of them became a game on the PlayStation Vita, it's called Pixel Poops.

02:26.140 --> 02:31.980
And yes, you go to the little taco stand and eat tacos, and then you stop joggers from

02:31.980 --> 02:35.940
running through the park by, well, it's in the title.

02:35.940 --> 02:42.820
So this game came out on the Vita, why Aaron or YYR did it, obviously can't get it anymore,

02:42.820 --> 02:47.460
because they kind of closed that part of the Vita shop down.

02:47.820 --> 02:53.980
He's now re-realizing Pixel Poops through a Steam release, which is coming out in just

02:53.980 --> 02:55.580
a few days, like three more days.

02:55.580 --> 02:58.420
So by the time some of you hear this, it will already be out.

02:58.420 --> 03:02.780
But he didn't just decide to release Pixel Poops, oh no, he decided he was going to do

03:02.780 --> 03:09.060
a Commodore 64 version of the game as well, as well as releasing sound samples, souping

03:09.060 --> 03:13.680
up the game with some extra modes that are very reminiscent of like the game switch on

03:13.680 --> 03:15.100
an Atari 2600.

03:15.740 --> 03:20.780
As silly as the idea sounds, and as much as when I say Pixel Poops, and you probably go,

03:20.780 --> 03:24.260
that sounds stupid, yeah, but it's fun.

03:24.260 --> 03:28.300
Like a lot of old videos, like, have you ever looked at Atari 2600 box art?

03:28.300 --> 03:29.940
It's pretty stupid.

03:29.940 --> 03:30.940
And I mean that with love.

03:30.940 --> 03:35.660
A lot of the games are like weird, like, I mean, look at the premise of like, it's Pac-Man,

03:35.660 --> 03:40.660
you're a thing that eats dots and getting chased by ghosts for some reason, it's like,

03:40.660 --> 03:41.660
what's the story there?

03:41.660 --> 03:43.780
I don't know, there is no story.

03:43.780 --> 03:44.780
Exactly.

03:45.460 --> 03:50.460
So not only has Aaron got all this going on and takes all this on, but then Loki's like,

03:50.460 --> 03:55.320
you know what, I want to sign up for Punishment 2, I'm going to do an NES version of Pixel

03:55.320 --> 03:56.320
Poops.

03:56.320 --> 04:01.380
And you know what, I guess we'll just release it all on the same day, because it's going

04:01.380 --> 04:06.440
to be free on Steam, so Pixel Poops, the base game is free on Steam, so you can go check

04:06.440 --> 04:10.380
that out, because you can actually, I think you can play it on Aaron's website anyway,

04:10.380 --> 04:13.860
I think it's been there the whole time, so you can play it for free there, and you can

04:13.860 --> 04:18.140
play it for free on Steam, but then there's going to be like DLC that's going to cost

04:18.140 --> 04:19.140
$2.99?

04:19.140 --> 04:20.140
$1.99?

04:20.140 --> 04:21.140
$2.99?

04:21.140 --> 04:22.140
$1.99?

04:22.140 --> 04:25.660
It's going to cost less than a fucking latte, okay?

04:25.660 --> 04:29.100
It's going to be cheap, and you can go buy it, and that's going to give you the Commodore

04:29.100 --> 04:35.120
64 version, the soundtrack, and, or I shouldn't say soundtrack, but the authentic sample pack

04:35.120 --> 04:41.020
and all that stuff, and Loki's game, Pixel Poops number 2, which, he's crunching this

04:41.020 --> 04:42.620
weekend because he hasn't finished.

04:43.180 --> 04:46.260
So Pixel Poops number 2 will be a separate piece of DLC.

04:46.260 --> 04:48.300
Oh, okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

04:48.300 --> 04:49.980
It's not included in the $5.

04:49.980 --> 04:50.980
Oh, my bad.

04:50.980 --> 04:52.340
So that is separate.

04:52.340 --> 04:55.380
Still, still, it's like $5, that's nothing.

04:55.380 --> 05:02.180
Yeah, I think for my game, I was going to charge right now, like, I was going to do

05:02.180 --> 05:06.880
$8, but I mean, we've got like 32 levels in it, well, it's going to have like at least

05:06.880 --> 05:16.600
40 levels, and it's pretty hard, and I've redone a lot of the, I'm still drawing stuff

05:16.600 --> 05:23.560
for it right now, so there's a lot of content in there, because I wanted it to be on par

05:23.560 --> 05:27.480
with, like, I was looking at, like, okay, what are some of these other puzzle action

05:27.480 --> 05:33.280
games, how many levels do they have, oh, 50, okay, we'll see if we can get up to 50, but

05:33.280 --> 05:40.080
it's probably going to be 40, because I have five worlds, and each one has eight levels,

05:40.080 --> 05:44.520
so it's probably going to be there, unless I decide to cram in a few more levels, which

05:44.520 --> 05:45.640
I still could.

05:45.640 --> 05:51.080
I just love that you're releasing a game on, what, Wednesday, and it's still not done.

05:51.080 --> 05:57.640
Well, technically, it doesn't need to be done, even when it comes to Wednesday, because we

05:57.640 --> 06:03.200
do live in that modern age where we can catch stuff, but like, yeah, it'll be done by then.

06:04.120 --> 06:08.160
So, and going to our chat room, because of course, we do tape live every Sunday night

06:08.160 --> 06:13.080
at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock

06:13.080 --> 06:17.160
Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, and Fifth Dream is asking, any news

06:17.160 --> 06:19.360
on the physical, because do what?

06:19.360 --> 06:21.280
Well, I'm going to help answer that.

06:21.280 --> 06:25.640
First, Loki needs to finish the game, then he can worry about the physical version.

06:25.640 --> 06:30.240
Yeah, so the physical version will be coming at some point, so like, what I want to do

06:30.280 --> 06:35.040
with that, I may end up doing, because like I said, there's a lot of stuff I wanted to

06:35.040 --> 06:40.360
do, but time, you know, may not be necessarily on my side to do all the things I want to

06:40.360 --> 06:41.360
do.

06:41.360 --> 06:48.880
So what we may end up doing is like releasing a finished version of the game on Wednesday,

06:48.880 --> 06:54.460
and then coming back to do like a special edition that will be the physical version

06:54.460 --> 06:58.080
and will be a free upgrade to the DLC, whatever.

06:58.080 --> 07:01.160
So that may be what I end up doing, because I still want to see if there's, I've got a

07:01.160 --> 07:06.040
lot of space in different, because the way it's banked in there, the way the memories

07:06.040 --> 07:10.200
split up, I have a lot of space in there, and I want to cram more music and stuff like

07:10.200 --> 07:13.600
that in there and more levels as well.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.000
And my kids keep asking me for like boss fights and stuff.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.720
So I had some silly ideas regarding that.

07:19.720 --> 07:26.160
So I want to cram all that stuff in there as well, if possible, to really like maximize

07:26.160 --> 07:27.160
everything.

07:27.240 --> 07:32.400
And then the next day, you know, we'll just, you know, charge the $8 initially.

07:32.400 --> 07:35.800
And then if we bump it, the special edition will be $10 total.

07:35.800 --> 07:40.080
So if you bought in at the $8 version, then you get the special edition for free type

07:40.080 --> 07:41.080
thing.

07:41.080 --> 07:42.080
Yeah.

07:42.080 --> 07:44.360
So that's, that's the initial idea I have.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.360
We'll see.

07:45.360 --> 07:48.560
I mean, we may just leave it at eight bucks and call it a day.

07:48.560 --> 07:49.560
Well, I do like this.

07:49.560 --> 07:54.720
SSJ 100 Matt in chat says, Loki already more transparent than CD Projekt Red about the

07:54.720 --> 07:55.720
process.

07:55.720 --> 07:56.720
No.

07:56.720 --> 07:57.720
Yes.

07:57.720 --> 07:58.720
Yes.

07:58.720 --> 07:59.720
I understand.

07:59.720 --> 08:00.720
It's called scope creep.

08:00.720 --> 08:04.600
I am very familiar with scope creep and that, that is, that is the whole reason I did it

08:04.600 --> 08:08.880
on the NES because I can't implement a lot of the stuff I would like to implement on

08:08.880 --> 08:14.160
it because it just, it just physically can't be done because it's, you know, limited in

08:14.160 --> 08:19.000
space and, um, what the engine can handle and stuff like that.

08:19.000 --> 08:26.680
So that was on purpose because, and it worked because I've finished, I'm about to finish

08:26.680 --> 08:27.680
something.

08:27.680 --> 08:30.600
So, uh, that was the intent, but we'll see.

08:30.600 --> 08:31.600
Yeah.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.560
So I was looking in chat and there was a little bit of discussion about the price and, you

08:34.560 --> 08:39.000
know, uh, set it at 10 bucks and then just have it go on sale a lot cause you know, sales,

08:39.000 --> 08:42.960
you know, and honestly, like I was going to say, I think when I was on YYR site this week,

08:42.960 --> 08:46.880
uh, he actually said that the price of a couple of his games are going to go up this month.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.760
And honestly, my reaction was good.

08:48.760 --> 08:49.760
You deserve it.

08:49.760 --> 08:53.720
Like you guys, well, YYR specifically in this case deserves a bigger cut.

08:53.720 --> 08:58.020
Like these games are great and it's unfortunate, unfortunate that, you know, there's just so

08:58.020 --> 09:02.600
many games on steam that you have to have that viral moment to really get discovered

09:02.600 --> 09:03.600
sometimes.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.720
I may end up doing 10 bucks.

09:05.720 --> 09:11.520
I remember having 99 or whatever I was, cause I was looking at like other games, like, Oh,

09:11.520 --> 09:13.960
my game, it doesn't, it's not as good as that.

09:13.960 --> 09:14.960
You know?

09:14.960 --> 09:18.620
So I was like, eh, no people are going to pay $10 for this.

09:18.620 --> 09:22.260
So I may just end up doing 10 bucks and then we'll just do the free upgrade later.

09:22.260 --> 09:23.700
Um, we'll see.

09:23.700 --> 09:27.960
I don't know, but you need to go on other podcasts to promote, by the way, you, you

09:27.960 --> 09:30.620
should be booking a bunch of podcasts this month.

09:30.620 --> 09:35.820
Well, I don't, yeah, I don't have time yet to advertise and that's probably a big mistake,

09:35.820 --> 09:41.080
but, um, I do want to like definitely get it out there because just the premise of a

09:41.080 --> 09:44.960
game in an NES game and stuff like that, I think that should be able to get some quick

09:44.960 --> 09:46.840
bait articles on some sites.

09:46.840 --> 09:50.680
So we can see if I can put together like something like that.

09:50.680 --> 09:54.600
Well, you had that YouTube that was like, you're not going to believe this one dude,

09:54.600 --> 10:00.800
but still, but still it shows that, yeah, you know, as people that think it's so weird

10:00.800 --> 10:02.960
in a good way that they, they want to highlight it.

10:02.960 --> 10:08.560
So yeah, so, so, so far we've got, was it, we've got the, the park level, we've got a

10:08.560 --> 10:15.280
cemetery levels, uh, snowy mountains and then like sort of a Western theme.

10:15.280 --> 10:21.480
So that, that's what we've got done so far and now I'm working on, um, it's a inside

10:21.480 --> 10:23.840
of the Nintendo type level.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.620
So it's all circuit boards and stuff.

10:25.620 --> 10:28.520
So that's what I'm working on artwork for right now.

10:28.520 --> 10:33.200
And that's just going to be like an amalgamation of all the different things in the game.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.080
But yeah, it, it's going to get pretty hard.

10:36.080 --> 10:40.920
And um, I was telling the originals pretty difficult, which, but by the way I did play,

10:40.920 --> 10:45.040
so not to get too far into my gaming week, but oops, I did play some pixel poops the

10:45.040 --> 10:48.000
other night just because, you know, it's a, it's a fun little game to sit down and

10:48.000 --> 10:49.280
play for a little bit.

10:49.280 --> 10:52.540
And um, I got, I broke Aaron's score.

10:52.540 --> 10:57.000
So I have the number one score right now in the, in the base, like default mode, basically

10:57.000 --> 10:58.300
I have the number one score.

10:58.300 --> 11:02.560
And the only reason it didn't get higher, I was trying to go in and screenshot when

11:02.560 --> 11:06.660
I hit 666 because you know, LOL.

11:06.660 --> 11:11.360
And then of course I was so focused on getting the screenshot at 66, 66.

11:11.360 --> 11:12.360
When did I lose?

11:12.360 --> 11:15.840
667.

11:15.840 --> 11:21.520
So that's, that's the current high score in the world world world for a pixel poops.

11:21.520 --> 11:22.520
So yeah.

11:22.520 --> 11:23.520
So yeah.

11:23.520 --> 11:27.360
And basically once, once I do have the game done, like I am still looking at physical

11:27.360 --> 11:28.640
like versions of that.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.480
I don't know how I want to do that yet.

11:30.480 --> 11:34.240
If that involves like a Kickstarter and then with Kickstarter, it's like, okay, well, what

11:34.240 --> 11:38.800
do I actually need the fund because you know, how much is going to go to Kickstarter then

11:38.800 --> 11:42.000
taxes and costs and you got to make something off of it.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.080
So, you know, it's all of that stuff involved.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.000
That's like, I don't know, cause I've never run a Kickstarter.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
So who knows?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.360
That's a interesting way thing to look into.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.520
You can also, there's alternate crown fundings too.

11:52.520 --> 11:56.440
Um, but that might be an interesting way to do it because at least you have a finished

11:56.440 --> 12:00.120
product and you'll be able to say, here is the game on steam right here.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.680
This is to produce a physical version of said game and you're not going to have to worry

12:03.680 --> 12:07.240
about the whole like, well, I don't know if I want to buy it cause I don't know if it'll

12:07.240 --> 12:09.320
actually happen cause it's done.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.320
Like you just, you're trying to get the publishing stuff.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.040
And I think that's a good way to do it.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.040
So I may do that.

12:14.040 --> 12:18.160
Um, the other thing I did want to do as well is I have got that nice cover artwork once

12:18.160 --> 12:20.960
I get the logo added onto it as well.

12:20.960 --> 12:26.960
I'm going to make a t-shirt, t-shirts, I'll have that at some point too.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.000
So you'll be able to buy shirts for that kind of stuff.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.280
But yeah, I know a place that has a growing store, but now I'm sure you want to make your

12:33.280 --> 12:34.280
own coin off it.

12:34.280 --> 12:35.280
I gotcha.

12:35.280 --> 12:36.280
But yeah, go for it.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.280
So, yeah.

12:37.280 --> 12:38.280
All right.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.440
Um, Bobby is that now I don't want to turn this into the pixel poop show because we are

12:41.440 --> 12:44.160
going to talk about other gaming, but this is a, this is kind of a big deal.

12:44.160 --> 12:47.220
Like the game that Loki's been talking about for a year and a half is finally releasing

12:47.220 --> 12:48.220
this week.

12:48.220 --> 12:49.840
You can go wishlist it on steam.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.560
It hasn't even been a year and a half.

12:51.560 --> 12:52.920
It's only been six months.

12:52.920 --> 12:53.920
Yeah.

12:53.920 --> 12:54.920
Hard to believe.

12:54.920 --> 12:57.920
I guess I'm adding the time to car stuff I think just in my mind.

12:57.920 --> 12:58.920
Yeah.

12:58.920 --> 12:59.920
That's been a while.

12:59.920 --> 13:00.920
Yeah.

13:00.920 --> 13:04.080
So, um, I, I would go wishlist the game on steam right now if you haven't already.

13:04.080 --> 13:07.640
Um, I'm sorry, I don't have a link available, but you guys are smart in chat.

13:07.640 --> 13:09.960
Somebody will find that link in five seconds and post it.

13:09.960 --> 13:14.280
So, uh, go wishlist it right now because the more that have it wishlisted, of course, the

13:14.280 --> 13:15.880
more people that might see it and all that good stuff.

13:15.880 --> 13:19.400
Um, and we want to make sure why we are low key get views and it is, remember the base

13:19.400 --> 13:20.400
is going to be free.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.640
So you're not like committing to buy anything or whatever.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.840
If you don't want to get the DLC, you don't have to.

13:24.840 --> 13:28.600
Um, but, uh, the base thing will be free and you should definitely grab that.

13:28.600 --> 13:29.600
I encourage that.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.600
So, uh, cool.

13:30.600 --> 13:31.600
All right.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.600
Anyway.

13:32.600 --> 13:33.600
Okay.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.600
Sorry.

13:34.600 --> 13:35.600
Lots of stuff, but it's important.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.920
There's a long running OLR joke that's climaxing this week.

13:38.920 --> 13:41.020
So let's check that out on steam.

13:41.020 --> 13:45.700
It's important for us to talk about, uh, let's get into, um, by the way, I love that behind

13:45.700 --> 13:50.200
you tonight, you have, that's either the arcade version of moonwalker or the Genesis version

13:50.200 --> 13:51.960
of the arcade playing behind you.

13:51.960 --> 13:55.920
I've never played the arcade version that they was the same as the, uh, I have just

13:55.920 --> 13:56.920
a couple of times.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.400
I have just a couple of times.

13:58.400 --> 13:59.400
It's awesome.

13:59.400 --> 14:03.720
Uh, it was, it was a great, great game and I'm assuming this is your continued, uh, to

14:03.720 --> 14:05.180
the moon talk.

14:05.180 --> 14:11.140
You must have because I just was thinking, I saw, um, like before the show, it was on

14:11.140 --> 14:13.060
the scroll and Bobby's show talking about end Walker.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.060
I was like, Oh yeah.

14:14.060 --> 14:15.060
Moonwalker.

14:15.060 --> 14:16.060
I could do that.

14:16.060 --> 14:17.060
Okay.

14:17.060 --> 14:18.060
Okay.

14:18.060 --> 14:19.060
Okay.

14:19.060 --> 14:20.060
Clever.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.060
Clever.

14:21.060 --> 14:22.060
Speaking of to the moon, doge coin.

14:22.060 --> 14:23.060
Glad I got in what I did.

14:23.060 --> 14:24.060
Did you get in a doge coin?

14:24.060 --> 14:25.060
Good for you.

14:25.060 --> 14:26.060
Yeah.

14:26.060 --> 14:29.180
It's I didn't get in much like 50 bucks, but it's already doubled.

14:29.180 --> 14:32.100
So you know, that's better than nothing.

14:32.100 --> 14:37.180
And I guess I put 50 bucks on Ethereum just out of the blue last week and it got to 60.

14:37.180 --> 14:40.460
I think now it's around like 58, but I'm just going to let it sit for a little bit.

14:40.460 --> 14:42.100
See what happens.

14:42.100 --> 14:47.980
It's money that would have been like a lotto ticket or a slot machine, like, you know,

14:47.980 --> 14:52.860
in the real, in a non COVID world, you know, and still like with the GameStop and like

14:52.860 --> 14:57.340
AMC still holding on that stuff for now, cause it's already dropped in price.

14:58.340 --> 15:03.260
It may come back next week, never know, or make bump up a little bit.

15:03.260 --> 15:07.420
And if not, I just dump it and buy more doge coin.

15:07.420 --> 15:12.660
I'm going to our chat, fifth dream props to you cause you found the links to the steam

15:12.660 --> 15:13.660
store first.

15:13.660 --> 15:14.660
So thank you for that.

15:14.660 --> 15:15.660
All right.

15:15.660 --> 15:18.100
Let's get to our kickoff topic tonight.

15:18.100 --> 15:19.620
We want to talk about this.

15:19.620 --> 15:23.380
Some big gaming news that came out early this week, and I'm sure you all have a lot of feelings

15:23.380 --> 15:24.380
on it.

15:24.420 --> 15:25.420
It's fine.

15:25.420 --> 15:29.820
It's well, there is, there's what this is and what this isn't.

15:29.820 --> 15:30.820
Let's get into it.

15:30.820 --> 15:31.820
Loki.

15:31.820 --> 15:32.820
I got it.

15:32.820 --> 15:39.860
So what, what it is is basically so stadia, the, you know, and to any console really,

15:39.860 --> 15:43.860
you know, the console is only as strong as the games that are on it.

15:43.860 --> 15:48.980
And you know, really when it comes to stadia, it was like, okay, what are the killer apps?

15:48.980 --> 15:53.900
What is the exclusive game that I got to play on stadia?

15:53.900 --> 15:55.620
That's really going to drive me to that platform.

15:55.620 --> 16:00.780
Well, now there's not going to be any because Google stadia has announced that they are

16:00.780 --> 16:05.860
no longer going to be pursuing internal development on their own games.

16:05.860 --> 16:11.900
So they've closed its two game studios in Montreal and Los Angeles.

16:11.900 --> 16:15.300
And apparently that is impacting about 150 developers.

16:15.300 --> 16:24.260
So no new game from Jade Raymond, you know, now it's just going to continue to operate

16:24.260 --> 16:29.980
its service and it's a $10 monthly stadia pro service as well.

16:29.980 --> 16:35.780
I mean, I gotta be honest, like this is definitely the writing on the wall.

16:35.780 --> 16:42.860
Like I would be very wary to buy anything on stadia purchasing any games because I mean,

16:42.860 --> 16:45.380
we could be talking about next year, this could be shutting down.

16:45.380 --> 16:49.900
I mean, it's, I don't know, they're already cutting their losses.

16:49.900 --> 16:56.180
So it seems to be that this is just kind of one step into that direction of actually shutting

16:56.180 --> 16:57.180
the whole service down.

16:57.180 --> 17:02.220
Well, and to be clear, because I said, there's what this news is and what this news isn't,

17:02.220 --> 17:06.580
this is not that news that stadia is shutting down, which I think a lot of people were kind

17:06.580 --> 17:08.300
of reading into it that way.

17:08.300 --> 17:12.300
This is not that this is Google saying that they're essentially refocusing.

17:12.300 --> 17:16.540
But it's, it's all kind of PR speak that we can see right through for that they didn't

17:16.540 --> 17:22.100
see the need to continue developing the games in house, whether the games just weren't turning

17:22.100 --> 17:25.820
out at the level they were hoping or what it was, if that had to do with some of the

17:25.820 --> 17:29.980
response to stadia, I don't know if we'll know, unfortunately, and I've said this a

17:29.980 --> 17:36.500
million times on the show, and I don't think we say it enough, is that a lot of times in

17:36.500 --> 17:41.700
fandom press, which is, you know, what a lot of gaming blogs and stuff is, especially when

17:41.700 --> 17:44.980
it comes to social media, especially when it comes to social media.

17:44.980 --> 17:51.060
The reality is, the truth, and what Google's intentions are, and what Google is trying

17:51.060 --> 17:55.660
to do and what Google might have been doing, the truth doesn't matter.

17:55.660 --> 17:58.660
And I know that sounds like a really stupid thing to say.

17:58.660 --> 17:59.660
But that is the reality.

17:59.660 --> 18:01.860
The truth doesn't matter.

18:01.860 --> 18:03.300
What matters?

18:03.300 --> 18:04.660
Perception.

18:04.660 --> 18:06.700
Perception is what matters.

18:06.700 --> 18:09.800
How is news perceived?

18:09.800 --> 18:15.920
And gotta be honest, when Google first announced stadia, what were several people in our chat

18:15.920 --> 18:16.920
room saying?

18:16.920 --> 18:18.920
What were several people on social media saying?

18:18.920 --> 18:21.560
What were a lot of people out there saying?

18:21.560 --> 18:25.780
Well, Google's getting into this, but Google doesn't have the greatest track record at

18:25.780 --> 18:27.720
supporting the stuff they put out there.

18:27.720 --> 18:31.560
I give it a couple years, and now what happens?

18:31.560 --> 18:33.460
Google's slowly yanking that support.

18:33.460 --> 18:34.920
At least that's the perception.

18:34.920 --> 18:37.440
And that's all that matters.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.640
So that's why this is...

18:40.640 --> 18:43.720
It's unfortunate, because I know people who like stadia.

18:43.720 --> 18:48.520
I know people who really fan for stadia and want to see stadia do better.

18:48.520 --> 18:54.160
And I'm trying to be very cautious to not rain on the parade, because I'm sure they're

18:54.160 --> 18:58.160
already feeling crappy enough after this week and so forth.

18:58.160 --> 19:01.200
Good for you for sticking by it and what you believe in.

19:01.200 --> 19:04.000
And I don't think cloud gaming is going to be...

19:04.000 --> 19:13.960
I'm not even sure stadia is really super duper done, but I think the imagining scenario

19:13.960 --> 19:20.360
that Google painted for us is that stadia is going to be an invisible console that competes

19:20.360 --> 19:24.360
right up there with Xbox One and PlayStation 5 and all.

19:24.360 --> 19:25.360
Eh, no.

19:25.360 --> 19:26.360
You know what?

19:26.360 --> 19:28.280
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

19:28.280 --> 19:32.280
And Google has now just said, we're not interested in developing our own games anymore.

19:32.320 --> 19:37.000
So that whole thing, I think, is gone.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.480
So now it's just about, how else can stadia be leveraged?

19:42.480 --> 19:49.160
Who can insert stadia into that magic winning formula where maybe stadia comes back as something

19:49.160 --> 19:52.040
else and not that imaginary fourth console?

19:52.040 --> 19:54.040
Loki, I want to let you have a say.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.540
No, I was going to say, yeah, exactly that.

19:56.540 --> 19:59.880
It's just, I don't know.

19:59.880 --> 20:07.640
Your whole business model is just kind of not as appealing as something else, like where

20:07.640 --> 20:12.000
you have that kind of Netflix model where you just basically pay a fee and you can have

20:12.000 --> 20:14.040
access to a library of games.

20:14.040 --> 20:18.440
And again, that's perception fucking stadia, I'm sorry to interrupt, but that's perception

20:18.440 --> 20:22.820
fucking stadia again, because when it was announced, oh, Google's putting out this service

20:22.820 --> 20:29.060
and you pay $10 a month and you get some games, everybody's kind of thinking, oh, Google's

20:29.100 --> 20:30.900
going to do the Netflix things for game.

20:30.900 --> 20:33.780
Great. And that's that's the perception people have.

20:33.940 --> 20:37.860
Right. Oh, if Google's charging 10 bucks a month, which is what they were out there doing

20:37.860 --> 20:40.540
with pro and all that, then I must be able to get in there and play all those games for

20:40.540 --> 20:44.380
free. And then it was like, oh, you can play some games for free.

20:44.620 --> 20:47.860
You can play these games that we have the arrangement, but you don't get to play everything

20:47.860 --> 20:50.460
for free. In fact, you have to pay $60 if you want to play like cyberpunk and stuff.

20:50.580 --> 20:52.060
And I think that's where the public went.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.420
Oh, never mind.

20:55.420 --> 20:59.140
And I think that's a big part of what has hurt Stadia from the beginning.

20:59.860 --> 21:01.940
So it's yeah, it's.

21:04.500 --> 21:11.380
It's just it's it's not helping at all, and it's going to be hard to see them already,

21:11.380 --> 21:16.020
even like we've had some stuff where, you know, stuff that you think should have supported

21:16.020 --> 21:21.220
it, like I don't even know if like their plate, their Google TV stuff supports Stadia.

21:21.780 --> 21:27.220
I don't believe it does, which is kind of seems to be a big miss right there as well.

21:27.220 --> 21:31.460
It's just like half half assed kind of support from Google for it.

21:31.700 --> 21:35.940
And there was a lot of confusion, like I didn't even realize until this week that you

21:35.940 --> 21:40.540
didn't need a Stadia pro account to play Stadia games in the browser now that at some

21:40.540 --> 21:42.060
point they flip the switch for that.

21:42.060 --> 21:46.940
I didn't even realize that, like Google's had a big problem with messaging now for it

21:46.940 --> 21:52.300
to their credit during this whole pandemic and the fact that it's killed all these

21:52.300 --> 21:56.500
conventions and the opportunity for them to go show the public a little more about this

21:56.500 --> 22:02.820
stuff. I will I will allow them to shift some blame on that, that, you know, they had a

22:02.820 --> 22:05.140
hard time getting the messaging out because of the pandemic.

22:05.380 --> 22:06.460
I get that.

22:06.460 --> 22:11.900
I understand that. But I still wish they would have invested another year in trying to

22:11.900 --> 22:14.580
get the right messaging out if they really wanted this to be successful.

22:15.260 --> 22:19.380
But, you know, maybe they just have to take some time to use the rest of this pandemic to

22:19.380 --> 22:22.900
figure out what that thing is and then go with it, because, you know, there's lots of

22:23.020 --> 22:25.980
still great ideas and I think uses for cloud gaming out there.

22:25.980 --> 22:30.540
You know, I think it would be brilliant if Google partnered up with Valve or something so

22:30.540 --> 22:34.220
that when you buy a game on Steam, you can either install it to your computer or you can

22:34.220 --> 22:39.700
play in the cloud. And imagine imagine if like demos were available through the cloud.

22:39.700 --> 22:44.340
I think so many people want to be doing demos in the cloud where you don't have to wait

22:44.340 --> 22:45.380
and download all this stuff.

22:45.380 --> 22:49.740
And again, look at a place like Steam when they do like the developer days where they

22:49.740 --> 22:52.540
fill up the front page with like 40 different demos.

22:52.700 --> 22:54.900
And it's like they all look neat and you want to try them.

22:54.900 --> 22:58.660
But like click, download, wait, start.

22:58.660 --> 23:00.900
OK, I didn't I didn't care for that one.

23:00.900 --> 23:04.660
Uninstalled. Why can't you just click a fucking button and play the game?

23:06.820 --> 23:12.420
I don't know. Amazon has it where you can click a button and you can get Tide Pod sent

23:12.420 --> 23:13.460
to your house tomorrow.

23:14.020 --> 23:15.500
Why don't we have that for games?

23:16.740 --> 23:20.420
I think we do have it in certain places, but Google should be enabling that here.

23:20.580 --> 23:27.300
You know, so I feel like there are still places where Stadia could kind of carve a niche

23:27.300 --> 23:31.660
for itself, but it's just it's not going to be the fourth console or whatever.

23:32.900 --> 23:38.420
So. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, because it's patented, I don't know if the game

23:38.420 --> 23:41.500
delivery thing is maybe that is patented, I don't know.

23:41.900 --> 23:45.300
The Amazon thing, though, you went over that on your show last week and that patent

23:45.300 --> 23:46.580
expired a couple of years ago.

23:46.580 --> 23:49.540
I do believe you recapped at the end there.

23:49.540 --> 23:52.380
So one click ordering is is open.

23:52.380 --> 23:55.100
So I don't know about I don't know if there's a patent for one click gaming.

23:55.100 --> 23:59.660
You're right. Maybe somebody's patented that already, which is a whole other issue.

24:00.300 --> 24:02.900
But I don't have time to get into that on this three hour show.

24:02.900 --> 24:12.260
So SSU 100 Matt in chat says, could they just be looking to go the epic route and pay

24:12.260 --> 24:14.940
loads for exclusives, exclusive games?

24:15.260 --> 24:17.540
I don't want to see that happen, but it's possible.

24:17.820 --> 24:19.460
You're right. It's possible.

24:19.460 --> 24:23.380
And if Google is going to do that, they should probably make that they should have made

24:23.380 --> 24:29.580
that move with this announcement and and kind of I get you don't want to see it.

24:29.580 --> 24:34.260
But if Google wanted to show they were serious with this whole we're changing our model

24:34.260 --> 24:39.020
or whatever, then they would have announced whatever game, even though we are developing

24:39.020 --> 24:44.420
our own game anymore. We have obtained the exclusive rights to distribute that whatever

24:44.420 --> 24:47.860
title they come up with to kind of immediately fill in the gap.

24:47.900 --> 24:50.060
They didn't do that. And I don't think that was a great idea.

24:50.740 --> 24:54.220
I'm not sure Stadia was incredibly well managed as it is.

24:54.780 --> 24:57.140
And then we have to remember Phil Harrison's in charge.

24:57.220 --> 25:00.380
And what what what has Phil Harrison done for gaming?

25:01.020 --> 25:05.940
Like, if you look at his resume, he was in a lot of companies during their low points.

25:06.740 --> 25:07.980
Sorry, not sorry.

25:07.980 --> 25:10.660
I let the facts speak for themselves.

25:10.900 --> 25:14.700
So maybe Stadia just needs somebody else running it.

25:15.220 --> 25:22.420
Sorry. So, yeah, anyway, cloud gaming, I'm sure is not done for.

25:22.420 --> 25:27.500
In fact, we're a long way from that because, you know, Nvidia, I like the Nvidia thing

25:27.500 --> 25:30.780
that I kind of messed around with once because you can kind of use it for free and you can

25:30.780 --> 25:32.060
use it with your Steam library.

25:32.500 --> 25:34.060
And No Man's Sky was on there.

25:34.180 --> 25:38.300
I didn't feel like No Man's Sky looked any better than it did if I'm running it on my own

25:38.300 --> 25:42.140
computer. But it was a neat little experiment.

25:42.140 --> 25:45.020
So, you know, there's that Amazon had their own.

25:45.020 --> 25:48.460
But then, you know, Amazon is having a lot of struggles making their own game as well.

25:48.460 --> 25:52.300
We all know that. I just I just again, I would love to see.

25:52.300 --> 25:57.460
Like in the PlayStation stores, I want Sony to to get this technology or something because

25:57.460 --> 26:03.340
we know Microsoft's got it because Microsoft is I still kind of like that cloud thing is

26:03.340 --> 26:07.340
coming. Yes, I know they are still you can do it with your phones and controller and

26:07.340 --> 26:15.500
stuff. But I think when it arrives where on my Xbox 360, I can run a cloud X cloud app

26:15.500 --> 26:19.340
and play Halo Master Chief collection through the cloud or so.

26:19.340 --> 26:25.220
I think that will be a great use case argument by Microsoft, but we're not not just there

26:25.220 --> 26:27.220
yet, but maybe by the end of the year.

26:27.220 --> 26:33.740
We'll see. And then Microsoft will have the ability to say, OK, well, for your, you know,

26:33.740 --> 26:37.900
fifteen dollar a month or whatever they're charging for now for Microsoft Game Pass.

26:38.100 --> 26:43.420
Yes, you get all these games in the cloud because a lot of Game Pass games are also tied

26:43.420 --> 26:44.940
into X Cloud right now.

26:45.100 --> 26:49.860
And so Microsoft will be able to deliver that Netflix perception that the audience was

26:49.860 --> 26:51.300
associating with Google Stadia.

26:52.700 --> 26:54.220
There is that so.

26:54.740 --> 26:58.860
All right, well, if we got nothing else to say on Stadia, if you want to email us and

26:58.860 --> 27:04.940
give us your thoughts on all of this, you sure can participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

27:05.220 --> 27:10.380
SSJ 100 Matt says, I mean, it's still the best and most stable place to play cyberpunk.

27:11.060 --> 27:15.900
Why Google is not able to better leverage that, I'll never understand.

27:17.140 --> 27:20.620
Again, it's all adding up to part of the thing where I'm like, I just think Stadia just in

27:20.620 --> 27:22.220
general just isn't being run well.

27:23.660 --> 27:27.780
All right, moving on, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we've

27:27.780 --> 27:28.860
been playing this week.

27:29.100 --> 27:33.620
Loki, I feel like we kind of covered it, but did you get a chance to play any games besides

27:33.620 --> 27:34.420
developing your own?

27:35.260 --> 27:44.580
I played a little bit of Orna and a little bit of Pokemon Go as well.

27:45.260 --> 27:47.940
That was a very, very minimal.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.980
It's been mostly just working on my game this week.

27:50.660 --> 27:51.660
I figured as much.

27:51.660 --> 27:54.220
It's probably been taking up most of your week.

27:54.500 --> 27:58.620
Well, I look forward to your game releasing so you can actually play some other games this

27:58.620 --> 27:59.060
next year.

27:59.500 --> 28:00.180
Yes, me too.

28:01.140 --> 28:04.300
All right, going back to the last story a little bit to get a comment here.

28:04.300 --> 28:08.700
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says they did mention cyberpunk in the first paragraph of their

28:08.700 --> 28:10.980
blog, so they're trying to reference it.

28:11.220 --> 28:15.940
I think that's probably the worst place they could reference it if they want me to take it

28:15.940 --> 28:16.700
seriously.

28:16.900 --> 28:18.860
And maybe they've done this.

28:18.860 --> 28:20.540
I don't know, but I haven't seen it.

28:21.220 --> 28:26.700
Buy a Twitch ad, buy a pre-roll Twitch ad that says cyberpunk on Stadia, best place to play

28:26.700 --> 28:30.820
with the quotes, best place to experience cyberpunk, smoothest experience.

28:31.020 --> 28:33.100
I don't use the pull quotes.

28:33.260 --> 28:34.860
It should be on Twitch pre-roll ads.

28:34.860 --> 28:39.300
It should be on a commercial on TV during that little little dog and pony show they got

28:39.300 --> 28:40.020
going right now.

28:40.220 --> 28:43.900
That should be an ad, although, of course, it costs millions of dollars.

28:44.100 --> 28:48.900
So maybe they'll have to go to the network that literally has the dog and pony show with

28:48.900 --> 28:51.820
the cheaper ads right now, the counterprogramming.

28:51.940 --> 28:54.500
But they should be putting that stuff out there.

28:54.740 --> 29:01.100
So it's, you know, burying it in a press release isn't exactly informing the public and

29:01.100 --> 29:02.580
trying to shift the perception.

29:02.620 --> 29:03.980
That's just my thing.

29:04.500 --> 29:10.420
All right. Black Compat in chat says, I'm currently playing God of War again, but this

29:10.420 --> 29:11.820
time on my PlayStation 5.

29:11.820 --> 29:12.700
It's so pretty.

29:12.940 --> 29:17.980
Yeah, because they went back and they did like a little upgrade patch, didn't they, on

29:17.980 --> 29:21.340
that? Like they did like a whole like PS5 kind of patching for that.

29:21.340 --> 29:23.980
So if you're you're playing it on your PlayStation 5, you get a little something,

29:23.980 --> 29:26.620
something extra. I hope we see that for some more games.

29:27.020 --> 29:28.220
So I do.

29:28.260 --> 29:29.220
I do hope so.

29:29.220 --> 29:33.580
You know, I do hope Sony starts to get into this cloud stuff, too.

29:34.260 --> 29:35.580
But we'll see. We'll see.

29:36.260 --> 29:37.900
All right. Moving on.

29:38.660 --> 29:39.980
Let's talk about my gaming week.

29:40.340 --> 29:44.220
So honestly, I've continued to play a lot of Final Fantasy 14.

29:44.500 --> 29:48.460
In fact, I even did a whole stream about Final Fantasy 14 on Friday here at VOG Network.

29:48.700 --> 29:50.700
But we'll get into that story in a little bit.

29:50.700 --> 29:52.820
I mean, see, it's coming up here on the show.

29:53.060 --> 29:54.620
So we'll talk about that a little bit.

29:55.060 --> 29:57.860
Outside of Final Fantasy 14, I've been playing a lot, a lot.

29:57.860 --> 30:01.540
I've been, of course, playing, you know, the GPS games, Pokemon Go.

30:01.660 --> 30:06.460
I was able to catch a lot of the Rosalie's today, the shiny ones.

30:06.460 --> 30:11.060
I got like 12 of them, kind of more than I usually get on a shiny day.

30:11.060 --> 30:12.740
I think I might have been like 15.

30:12.860 --> 30:14.660
I lost count. That's how many I got.

30:15.420 --> 30:18.580
So and that's that's one of my favorite Pokemon, actually.

30:18.620 --> 30:21.620
So I'm glad I got a lot of shinies of that one.

30:22.380 --> 30:24.100
So that was that was fun.

30:24.100 --> 30:27.620
As far as like other games I've been playing, there is a new game

30:27.620 --> 30:30.420
I checked out this week, thanks to Xbox Game Pass.

30:31.180 --> 30:33.460
It's called Cyber Shadow.

30:33.460 --> 30:36.660
That's Cyber something Cyber Shadow I checked out this week.

30:36.660 --> 30:39.700
So Cyber Shadow is by Yacht Club Games,

30:40.060 --> 30:42.580
which was the company that brought a Shovel Knight.

30:42.900 --> 30:45.780
So this is kind of like their next game.

30:45.980 --> 30:49.340
So Shovel Knight, of course, was a very retro inspired game

30:49.340 --> 30:52.860
that really invoked kind of a lot of the old Capcom classic

30:53.100 --> 30:55.180
carts like DuckTales and things like that.

30:55.180 --> 30:57.220
Of course, Shovel Knight kind of put its own spin on it.

30:57.980 --> 31:00.140
So Cyber Shadow is kind of that.

31:00.140 --> 31:03.580
But for Ninja Gaiden, which

31:04.620 --> 31:07.220
but but to just say very much Ninja Gaiden

31:07.940 --> 31:12.620
to just say it's a clone of that, though, I don't think is accurate.

31:12.620 --> 31:17.420
It definitely has like the play feel of it is very that.

31:17.700 --> 31:20.140
But a lot of the boss design is very different.

31:20.140 --> 31:23.580
A lot of the level design is different because I noticed this

31:23.580 --> 31:24.500
a little ways into it.

31:24.500 --> 31:27.860
There are like secret areas and places where there's blocks

31:27.860 --> 31:30.260
that you can crush to kind of find a whole other area.

31:30.460 --> 31:34.420
And I after like admittedly, I've only played a couple of stages into it.

31:34.580 --> 31:38.300
But looking at the map, it looks like you might have to backtrack

31:38.300 --> 31:42.380
Blaster Master style to kind of go visit other areas.

31:42.620 --> 31:44.380
Like it's not just linear.

31:44.380 --> 31:46.140
It seems like there might be power ups

31:46.140 --> 31:48.580
and things that allow you to carve out a different path.

31:49.540 --> 31:52.260
So I think there might be a little bit of like Ninja Gaiden

31:52.260 --> 31:55.260
meets Master Blaster in that.

31:55.260 --> 31:58.500
So I think and that's that's fine by me.

32:00.380 --> 32:03.940
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, yeah, feels very Ninja Gaiden

32:03.940 --> 32:05.620
inspired and super tough.

32:05.620 --> 32:09.380
It is definitely there is no Bobby Black Wolf mode, I'm sorry to say.

32:10.060 --> 32:11.460
It is a challenging game.

32:11.460 --> 32:14.460
However, it does appear you have infinite lives.

32:14.660 --> 32:17.780
And so it's not like Ninja Gaiden where like you lose three lives

32:17.780 --> 32:20.060
and you have to go all the way back to the beginning of the act.

32:20.380 --> 32:23.340
You just every time you die, you just respond at a save point.

32:23.540 --> 32:25.540
So there is that.

32:25.540 --> 32:28.700
So it feels a little more like maybe Super Meat Boy in that sense,

32:28.700 --> 32:31.860
because you're playing relatively short little bursts

32:32.020 --> 32:33.660
to get to the next save point.

32:33.660 --> 32:35.620
And you don't have to go like all the way back,

32:35.620 --> 32:38.420
which was the thing that was really tough about something like Ninja Gaiden.

32:39.220 --> 32:42.140
So, you know, again, that's another way that it's kind of different

32:42.620 --> 32:45.420
from the Ninja Gaiden formula where I don't want to say, oh,

32:45.420 --> 32:48.900
this is just a clone of that game, because it definitely has

32:49.540 --> 32:53.060
its own differences that make even a nails

32:53.060 --> 32:55.540
tough game a little bit.

32:56.780 --> 32:59.260
Easier to stomach, if that makes sense.

32:59.660 --> 33:02.220
So but I'm enjoying it, I want to play more of it.

33:02.220 --> 33:04.420
And I even got some achievements.

33:04.420 --> 33:06.340
Bobby in chat is like, no, me mode.

33:06.820 --> 33:07.900
I'm going to tell you, Bobby,

33:07.900 --> 33:11.140
why this mode is or why this game is not going to make you happy,

33:11.380 --> 33:13.580
because I popped two achievements.

33:14.180 --> 33:19.060
One of them was worth 16 points and the other one was worth, I think, 31 points.

33:19.420 --> 33:22.180
So it violates Bobby's multiple of five thing

33:23.580 --> 33:26.660
where, you know, and maybe other people have this, too,

33:26.660 --> 33:31.380
where you get a little about my gamer score must end in zero or five.

33:31.380 --> 33:35.580
I have I have no place for a 16 or 31 or whatever it is.

33:35.900 --> 33:40.340
So I think on that principle, it's going to lose Bobby support.

33:40.900 --> 33:44.220
But if you don't, if you're if your gamer score has already been ruined

33:44.220 --> 33:48.340
by something else or you really don't give a rat's ass about it like me,

33:49.100 --> 33:52.660
it's on Game Pass for PC and Xbox.

33:52.860 --> 33:54.620
So if you're on that Game Pass thing,

33:54.620 --> 33:57.620
you really should just go check it out because you're already paying for it.

33:57.780 --> 33:59.780
So go make use of what you're paying for.

33:59.780 --> 34:01.820
It's a good game in that regard.

34:01.820 --> 34:04.300
So have you you know about it, Loki, right?

34:04.300 --> 34:05.700
But you just haven't played it.

34:05.700 --> 34:08.900
Yeah, I'm well aware of it because, you know, it looked very much

34:08.900 --> 34:12.140
like Ninja Gaiden, like even down to the sprites and everything.

34:13.820 --> 34:16.220
So, yeah, very, very aware of it.

34:16.220 --> 34:20.140
Yeah. Even the first boss was like not even like Ninja Gaiden's

34:20.140 --> 34:23.300
first boss was like like you just duck and attack a bunch.

34:23.300 --> 34:26.620
You win. This one was way it was like a three pronged thing

34:26.620 --> 34:29.380
where you kind of had to like hit the middle when it came down

34:29.380 --> 34:31.060
and then dodge the guns on the other two.

34:31.060 --> 34:33.140
It was much more complicated.

34:33.140 --> 34:36.580
Like so it is interesting how even something that's retro

34:36.580 --> 34:40.580
inspired can kind of do things that they just really didn't do a lot

34:40.580 --> 34:44.580
on eight bit hardware, whether it's the limitations or whatever it is.

34:45.260 --> 34:50.340
Can you imagine, Loki, if you had made Pixel Poops 2 just retro inspired,

34:50.340 --> 34:54.460
but you made it for like the Xbox where you don't have to worry about the space.

34:54.820 --> 34:56.260
You can do whatever you want.

34:56.260 --> 35:00.500
Yeah. So now you have to go back to a remaster or something like that.

35:00.700 --> 35:03.020
Now you have to go back and make it all 16 by nine.

35:03.140 --> 35:07.700
Just make the play fields bigger.

35:07.740 --> 35:10.940
Yeah, that would be nice, you know, having, you know,

35:11.340 --> 35:14.540
not to adhere to the NES stuff.

35:15.220 --> 35:18.620
But Pixel Poops, Pixel Poops 3, please look forward to it.

35:18.620 --> 35:24.020
All right. Well, Pixel Poops 3 is going to be Pixel Poops 3D at that point.

35:25.140 --> 35:26.900
Oh, Virtual Boy game. Awesome.

35:26.900 --> 35:29.380
I can't wait. Yeah, there you go. Yeah.

35:29.380 --> 35:32.100
All right. Let's get into some gaming news.

35:32.100 --> 35:34.700
What else has been going on around the gaming world this week?

35:34.700 --> 35:36.700
Loki, what do you got for us?

35:36.700 --> 35:39.340
All right. So let's see.

35:39.340 --> 35:42.180
We've got this is kind of unique.

35:42.940 --> 35:46.220
There's a PlayStation game coming to the Xbox.

35:46.740 --> 35:51.380
So much like dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria.

35:52.020 --> 35:56.300
So like much like how we have, you know, Microsoft publishing,

35:56.500 --> 35:58.700
you know, Minecraft on other platforms.

35:58.940 --> 36:02.260
Mario and Sonic at the at the Olympics that never happened.

36:03.300 --> 36:09.700
Yes. And then also we have now MLB The Show 21,

36:09.700 --> 36:14.060
which is a PlayStation Studios title now coming to the Xbox

36:14.060 --> 36:18.340
one and Xbox Series X starting this April.

36:18.820 --> 36:22.380
So that is the first that used to be a PlayStation exclusive.

36:22.380 --> 36:26.100
And well, you know, I guess we just need more baseball out there

36:26.100 --> 36:30.060
because honestly, I think aside from MLB 2K,

36:30.060 --> 36:31.940
which I don't think even exists anymore,

36:33.580 --> 36:36.460
PlayStation was like the only place you can get a baseball game.

36:36.460 --> 36:40.740
So it's nice to see that that is multi platform now.

36:40.780 --> 36:44.340
I believe we had a story several months ago.

36:44.340 --> 36:45.740
We knew this was coming

36:45.740 --> 36:49.140
because it had something to do with retaining the license.

36:49.180 --> 36:53.020
Like Sony would not be able to continue to hold the license for that

36:53.260 --> 36:55.220
if they didn't put the game out on other consoles.

36:55.220 --> 36:57.260
I want to say that's what was playing up.

36:57.260 --> 36:59.100
Yep. And I'm looking in chat. There it is.

36:59.100 --> 37:02.500
Bobby in chat says MLB mandated this or else they were going to pull the license.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.780
They wanted a sim game on all consoles.

37:04.780 --> 37:06.700
They had the exclusive sim license.

37:06.700 --> 37:07.980
Yeah, I remember.

37:07.980 --> 37:12.500
See, I remember something from a few months ago where we actually knew

37:12.500 --> 37:14.700
this was coming. It's just it's finally here.

37:14.700 --> 37:19.100
And it's it's that shock of seeing a Sony PlayStation

37:19.100 --> 37:21.020
studio logo on an Xbox.

37:21.020 --> 37:22.180
You think it'll come to Game Pass?

37:23.020 --> 37:25.820
Mm hmm. I doubt it.

37:26.980 --> 37:28.580
We'll see. I don't know.

37:28.580 --> 37:29.580
As soon as possible.

37:29.580 --> 37:30.900
As soon as Matt is pointing out,

37:30.900 --> 37:34.060
EA lost the license or really let it go years ago.

37:34.060 --> 37:37.780
So this is, you know, even though, yes, there's other baseball sims,

37:38.260 --> 37:41.220
this is the only, you know, MLB

37:41.220 --> 37:43.940
endorsed one that actually has MLB players in it.

37:45.500 --> 37:49.660
Does Konami make a why do I feel like Konami makes a baseball game?

37:50.580 --> 37:52.780
I don't know why my brain is.

37:52.780 --> 37:55.580
Well, they have the power of pro like baseball game.

37:55.620 --> 37:58.460
It's like the kind of anime.

37:58.460 --> 38:00.420
This was not real, but it's not MLB.

38:00.420 --> 38:01.780
It's just fantasy.

38:01.780 --> 38:04.540
MLB. So it's like baseball stars or something. Yeah.

38:05.180 --> 38:07.620
Yeah. Yeah. MLB 2K.

38:08.100 --> 38:11.940
Back in the day, like way back in the day, EA had an MLB game.

38:13.900 --> 38:17.020
I think even they have like

38:17.020 --> 38:19.220
I don't know if they had college baseball as well.

38:19.220 --> 38:22.900
EA used to have a ton of sports games and they kind of slimmed it down a bit.

38:22.900 --> 38:25.980
But I mean, oh, I forgot about that.

38:25.980 --> 38:27.420
That's going back as a 200.

38:27.420 --> 38:32.300
Matt says they do have RBI baseball, but that game is more made in house by MLB.

38:33.100 --> 38:37.420
Sean 322 clarifies has real players, but it's more animated.

38:37.700 --> 38:41.060
And Bobby kind of clarifies that as arcadey. So.

38:43.980 --> 38:46.300
So it's still it's still going to be that shock.

38:46.540 --> 38:51.740
Do you think Sony may experiment putting anything else out on Microsoft's consoles?

38:51.740 --> 38:55.540
Probably not unless they're forced to. No, I doubt it. Yeah, I doubt it, too.

38:57.100 --> 38:58.900
But what about you know, there's always that rumor

38:58.900 --> 39:01.620
about Microsoft trying to put their stuff on other consoles, too.

39:02.180 --> 39:04.700
Do you think we might see some of their studios open up?

39:05.100 --> 39:07.980
I think it's certainly possible, especially when we're talking about

39:07.980 --> 39:11.100
things like Bethesda, which Microsoft now owns.

39:11.340 --> 39:14.700
Like, I think a lot of those games are still going to come out on Sony

39:14.700 --> 39:18.180
and even whatever works for the Nintendo switch, they'll put out

39:18.180 --> 39:19.500
on the Nintendo switch.

39:19.500 --> 39:21.900
So it is interesting that we're all kind of losing our shit

39:21.900 --> 39:24.420
overseeing a Sony logo on a Microsoft box.

39:24.700 --> 39:29.260
But like, I think we're all kind of prepared for at least Microsoft assets

39:29.580 --> 39:31.580
to show up on other consoles.

39:31.580 --> 39:33.980
It may just not have a Microsoft logo on it.

39:33.980 --> 39:37.140
It may have Bethesda's logo, but that's going to happen.

39:37.860 --> 39:41.100
So, yeah, it's kind of interesting. So

39:42.060 --> 39:43.460
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says

39:43.460 --> 39:46.580
the new Bethesda games will not go to switch or PS5.

39:46.820 --> 39:49.820
There's no way the Elder Scrolls six will be on any console,

39:49.820 --> 39:52.060
not in the Xbox ecosystem.

39:52.540 --> 39:56.580
Have they I have they clarified that because I thought they said

39:56.580 --> 39:59.460
they did interviews where they were actually pushing the opposite narrative

39:59.700 --> 40:03.260
where the guy was saying, well, we haven't made any decisions on that yet.

40:03.260 --> 40:04.420
You know, and you can you know,

40:04.420 --> 40:07.100
you can maybe read the tea leaves where it's going to go that way.

40:07.500 --> 40:10.860
I feel like it might happen.

40:10.980 --> 40:14.020
But and this is a big but.

40:14.020 --> 40:16.700
Microsoft's going to have the must have version.

40:16.900 --> 40:20.020
There's going to be a bunch of shit that's cut out for the other stuff.

40:20.060 --> 40:22.420
It's going to be like

40:22.940 --> 40:25.700
when Destiny first came out.

40:26.180 --> 40:29.500
It had like a whole extra zone on PlayStation

40:29.500 --> 40:31.500
that wasn't even on the Microsoft version.

40:31.500 --> 40:35.540
And Sony was like pushing it almost like it was one of their own exclusive games

40:35.900 --> 40:40.580
because they had such a great deal with Activision to get all this exclusive stuff.

40:40.860 --> 40:43.900
I feel like that could be kind of a middle ground

40:44.220 --> 40:47.220
where Microsoft still has like the must have version.

40:47.420 --> 40:51.900
But they they they give a little little pittance to the other ecosystems.

40:52.340 --> 40:53.780
So we'll see.

40:55.540 --> 40:59.220
Bobby says, but if you want to play Elder Scrolls six, you'll need an Xbox.

40:59.420 --> 41:02.980
Just like if you want to play God of War, you need a PlayStation or a PC.

41:03.980 --> 41:07.700
Or a PC for probably either of those games,

41:07.700 --> 41:11.620
eventually, the way some of the other Sony things have been going as of late.

41:11.620 --> 41:15.100
So we'll we'll give that one to the PC fanboys.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.020
All right.

41:16.020 --> 41:19.420
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about some other news that came out this week.

41:19.420 --> 41:21.580
And this news is very exciting for me,

41:22.260 --> 41:26.260
which was the new Final Fantasy 14 expansion that was announced.

41:26.460 --> 41:30.340
And of course, I talk a lot in my gaming weeks about how I play a lot

41:30.340 --> 41:31.820
of Final Fantasy 14.

41:31.820 --> 41:35.980
So, of course, I was very excited to watch this announcement showcase

41:35.980 --> 41:37.220
that they did on Friday,

41:37.220 --> 41:41.820
because essentially this was the event that I'd gone to in Vegas three times.

41:42.020 --> 41:44.820
Now, we all know why it didn't happen in person this time

41:44.820 --> 41:47.020
and why it was delayed a few months. Hello, Covid.

41:47.820 --> 41:51.220
But they finally kind of gave us the information

41:51.420 --> 41:53.460
that we would have got at the scheduled.

41:53.460 --> 41:55.700
Actually, they were going to move it this year to San Diego.

41:55.940 --> 41:59.980
They had announced that just before the pandemic started was that, oh, yeah,

41:59.980 --> 42:03.420
we're going to do Fan Fest in October, but it's in San Diego this time.

42:03.420 --> 42:05.300
So for whatever reason, they were moving it.

42:05.300 --> 42:07.780
And then, of course, they they called it off altogether.

42:08.860 --> 42:11.300
So we got some of the information about the new expansion.

42:11.500 --> 42:15.580
And as Loki kind of referred to earlier in the show, it is called Endwalker,

42:15.820 --> 42:19.100
which I love it because you can abbreviate it as Ew for short.

42:19.140 --> 42:20.740
Ew, David.

42:20.740 --> 42:24.100
But now it's Ew. Ew, Yoshi P.

42:24.500 --> 42:28.300
Anyway, it's going to be coming out this fall, so it will be out this year.

42:28.540 --> 42:30.420
One of the things that they showcased

42:30.420 --> 42:35.580
as part of the event was a new healer job, which is the first healer job

42:35.580 --> 42:38.100
they've put in the game since Astrologian,

42:38.500 --> 42:42.140
which, if I remember right, would have been 2018,

42:42.460 --> 42:48.340
2015 was when Heaven's Word came out and the Astrologian.

42:49.620 --> 42:52.340
So it's been a little while since we had a healer in the game, so Sage

42:52.660 --> 42:54.660
and Sage is a barrier healer.

42:54.700 --> 42:58.420
There will be a melee DPS, but we don't know what it is yet.

42:58.620 --> 43:01.420
A lot of sleuths on Reddit and people that I know

43:01.980 --> 43:05.620
are trying to figure it out from some of the things that were in the trailer.

43:05.980 --> 43:11.820
It is believed that there is multiple cases where a scythe has been visible

43:11.820 --> 43:15.300
and some of the T-shirts that Yoshi P was wearing

43:15.300 --> 43:18.820
have referenced a reaper or a scythe type of character.

43:19.020 --> 43:21.500
So people are kind of going that direction with it,

43:21.500 --> 43:23.900
that it will be some type of DPS that wields a scythe.

43:24.500 --> 43:27.580
It was also clarified in a Japanese interview that Yoshi P did.

43:28.460 --> 43:31.580
The class will share gear with Dragoon,

43:31.820 --> 43:34.100
which means it's going to be a strength based class,

43:34.100 --> 43:36.500
not a dexterity based class like Ninja would use.

43:36.500 --> 43:38.620
So there is all of that coming into it.

43:38.860 --> 43:41.060
A lot of people thinking we're getting some type of,

43:41.180 --> 43:44.500
some people are saying necromancer, some people are saying like a reaper.

43:44.700 --> 43:47.900
I think Final Fantasy 14 has done this very well,

43:47.900 --> 43:52.660
where they've kind of invented their own classes based around Final Fantasy history.

43:52.740 --> 43:56.380
So I think we're going to get some type of scythe based melee class

43:57.180 --> 43:59.900
that will be the class that people thought Dark Knight would be.

44:00.900 --> 44:01.700
So there will be that.

44:02.260 --> 44:06.460
So let's see some other things that they announced.

44:06.780 --> 44:09.260
This will be the end of the story.

44:09.260 --> 44:13.140
They have started the story with Zodiark and Hydaelyn

44:13.460 --> 44:16.260
all the way back in 1.0 and Realm Reborn, really.

44:16.780 --> 44:17.740
This will be the end of that.

44:17.740 --> 44:20.820
However, and they stress this many times, many times,

44:21.020 --> 44:23.460
this will not be the end of Final Fantasy 14.

44:23.820 --> 44:26.460
This will not be the end of Yoshi P's involvement.

44:27.260 --> 44:31.100
I think one way to kind of equate it is that this is the end of Marvel

44:31.100 --> 44:35.060
Cinematic Universe Part One, and then Marvel Cinematic Universe

44:35.060 --> 44:37.260
Part Two will begin in patch 6.1.

44:37.420 --> 44:38.820
So this is this.

44:38.820 --> 44:43.100
This is end game coming out and Walker and game, huh?

44:43.100 --> 44:45.740
Huh? OK, so there's that.

44:45.940 --> 44:50.460
So and then after this will be like a new kind of Final Fantasy 14 era.

44:50.700 --> 44:51.780
I thought it was very neat

44:51.780 --> 44:55.340
that Yoshi P came out and said, I see this as my life's work

44:57.300 --> 45:00.460
because, you know, with his involvement producing, but not directing

45:00.700 --> 45:04.740
Final Fantasy 16, some folks have kind of wondered what his future is.

45:04.740 --> 45:07.540
And I would assume it's inevitable

45:07.540 --> 45:11.660
that Final Fantasy 17 or 18 is another MMO.

45:11.900 --> 45:13.180
Why wouldn't they?

45:13.180 --> 45:16.220
And why wouldn't they want Yoshi P to be involved somehow?

45:16.820 --> 45:18.780
But it's not happening yet.

45:18.820 --> 45:21.940
So Yoshi P is staying with Final Fantasy 14.

45:22.780 --> 45:24.660
The other big news that was announced,

45:24.660 --> 45:27.180
a PlayStation five version of the game will be coming out

45:27.540 --> 45:30.820
and it will begin in a beta on April 13th.

45:30.820 --> 45:32.500
And this is the best news.

45:32.500 --> 45:35.340
You don't have to buy the PlayStation five version

45:35.340 --> 45:38.660
if you already own the PlayStation four version.

45:39.380 --> 45:42.420
Yeah, you can just roll over that license to PlayStation five.

45:42.860 --> 45:45.220
Actually, no, you don't even have to roll over a license.

45:45.220 --> 45:48.340
It just is looking for your PS4 license, basically, which is great.

45:49.020 --> 45:53.140
Some may recall when the game first came out, Realm Reborn

45:53.140 --> 45:56.660
and I think the first expansion Heavensward were on PlayStation three.

45:56.900 --> 45:59.780
When they finally sunset it, you can no longer play Realm Reborn

45:59.900 --> 46:02.180
or excuse me, Final Fantasy 14 on PlayStation three.

46:02.420 --> 46:05.540
They terminated that support, but they gave you a year,

46:05.540 --> 46:09.020
maybe a year and a half, where they said you can convert

46:09.020 --> 46:11.820
your PlayStation three license to a PlayStation four license.

46:12.020 --> 46:14.780
But once you do it, you can't go back to PlayStation three.

46:14.980 --> 46:17.980
So this is but they didn't really put that same quantifier

46:17.980 --> 46:19.940
on this PS5 rollover.

46:19.940 --> 46:22.620
But if you own a PlayStation five,

46:23.180 --> 46:25.940
why would you want to go back and play this on PlayStation four?

46:26.140 --> 46:27.780
Play it on PlayStation five.

46:27.780 --> 46:30.700
I I suppose everybody's situation is unique

46:30.860 --> 46:33.780
and maybe the PlayStation five isn't in the place that you want to play.

46:33.780 --> 46:34.620
I don't know.

46:34.620 --> 46:38.340
But I think for most people, they're going to be very happy with this news.

46:38.700 --> 46:42.780
There will be a virtual fan fest coming up in May 15th and 16th,

46:42.980 --> 46:47.140
where the rest of the expansion's details will be unearthed.

46:47.380 --> 46:50.580
And they didn't stop there because they still have a whole nother patch

46:50.580 --> 46:53.620
for the current expansion, Shadowbringers, that they went on

46:53.620 --> 46:55.340
and detailed later that night.

46:55.340 --> 46:57.140
We didn't stream that one

46:57.140 --> 47:00.540
because as I figured, it was mostly stuff we were expecting.

47:00.740 --> 47:02.740
It was here's a new dungeon.

47:02.900 --> 47:04.940
We're adding story content here.

47:04.940 --> 47:09.260
It's kind of the only maybe thing you could say about Final Fantasy 14.

47:09.260 --> 47:12.100
I think it's they've supported it very well.

47:13.140 --> 47:15.340
The game gets regular patches.

47:15.340 --> 47:18.700
But I think one of the ways they're able to make the game regular

47:18.700 --> 47:20.780
is it's very formulaic.

47:20.780 --> 47:24.740
Like the odd number patch is when you get the new 24 man raid

47:24.740 --> 47:27.860
and you get one new dungeon and you get this amount of story.

47:27.980 --> 47:30.420
The even numbered patch, you get the new eight man raid

47:30.420 --> 47:31.620
and you might get one trial.

47:31.620 --> 47:35.220
And so it's it's it's like we kind of all knew what was coming

47:35.220 --> 47:36.220
before we watched it.

47:36.220 --> 47:37.700
So there was that.

47:37.700 --> 47:39.700
But you know what? It's Final Fantasy 14.

47:39.860 --> 47:41.940
The story is great. I love the game.

47:42.900 --> 47:43.860
I'm still eating it up.

47:43.860 --> 47:46.500
Even if I'm saying that's it.

47:46.500 --> 47:49.300
So. All right.

47:49.300 --> 47:51.580
So, yeah, looking forward to the Final Fantasy 14 expansion

47:51.580 --> 47:52.900
coming out later this year.

47:52.900 --> 47:56.140
I'm sure I will talk plenty more about it because it is one of my favorite games.

47:56.500 --> 47:58.940
Oh, I have to say this, too.

47:58.940 --> 48:04.140
Loved that there was so much Final Fantasy four inspiration in the game.

48:04.660 --> 48:07.900
It's the one Final Fantasy that I feel like doesn't have a lot of representation

48:07.900 --> 48:09.860
in the game right now, and it's one of my favorites.

48:09.860 --> 48:13.180
And so I love that they're really going full tilt with this.

48:13.540 --> 48:16.740
You can get a lunar whale mount, an eight person mount

48:17.020 --> 48:20.820
if you get like a fan fest ticket.

48:20.820 --> 48:22.980
So you have to pay money for it. But still.

48:22.980 --> 48:25.100
And they played some of the music.

48:25.100 --> 48:30.140
So their music guy, Soken, who is like the Final Fantasy 14 soundtrack is stunning.

48:30.380 --> 48:33.300
If you've never heard it, you really owe it to yourself to listen to some tracks

48:33.300 --> 48:38.940
from Final Fantasy 14 soundtrack, because Soken is is proving himself

48:39.300 --> 48:43.500
in every way to be an heir to that legacy's music

48:43.500 --> 48:47.060
and what Nobui Matsu started many, many, many years ago.

48:47.060 --> 48:49.100
Soken is really fucking good.

48:49.100 --> 48:53.300
And he reinterpreted the Final Fantasy four like moon theme

48:53.300 --> 48:54.900
or like the lunar whale theme.

48:54.900 --> 48:56.420
It's so good. You have to hear it.

48:56.420 --> 48:58.540
So I'm really excited about that.

48:58.540 --> 48:59.940
And of course, you know, you're going to the moon.

48:59.940 --> 49:03.300
They're putting out minions for Rosa, Edge and Rydia

49:03.580 --> 49:06.020
that are going to be part of the virtual fan fest.

49:06.020 --> 49:07.500
I'm really excited about all of that.

49:07.500 --> 49:09.940
So loving the Final Fantasy four love.

49:09.940 --> 49:11.100
Thank you very much.

49:11.100 --> 49:13.260
OK, now I'm done talking about Final Fantasy 14.

49:13.260 --> 49:14.820
We can talk about other video games.

49:14.820 --> 49:17.060
Loki, what do you have for us?

49:17.460 --> 49:20.260
It's finishing up some some editing anyways.

49:20.300 --> 49:22.980
Are you working on your game now during the show?

49:24.060 --> 49:25.300
Of course you are.

49:25.300 --> 49:27.580
I was just making some changes to Wikipedia, that's all.

49:28.260 --> 49:31.220
Anyways. Oh, doing some marketing, I see.

49:32.140 --> 49:34.060
Yeah. So anyways,

49:34.980 --> 49:38.620
we've got news about what might have been.

49:38.620 --> 49:44.300
So Netflix was originally going to have a Zelda show,

49:44.300 --> 49:50.380
but it then pulled it back because it leaked out that it was coming out.

49:50.700 --> 49:54.460
So apparently this was a while ago and back in 2015.

49:55.340 --> 49:59.020
It was that long ago because I remember these rumors like they were the other day.

49:59.900 --> 50:01.300
I thought it was like two years ago.

50:01.300 --> 50:03.300
Anyway, it was it was a long time ago.

50:03.540 --> 50:05.060
Actually, probably even before that.

50:05.060 --> 50:08.660
So they said that during this was kind of

50:09.780 --> 50:12.020
that came out when they were talking about,

50:12.460 --> 50:16.780
I guess, this College Humor stop motion Star Fox thing that they were working on.

50:16.980 --> 50:19.100
The fantastic Mr. Star Fox.

50:19.100 --> 50:20.940
It came out in 2011.

50:20.940 --> 50:24.380
And so apparently because around that time

50:25.180 --> 50:28.220
there was reports that Netflix wasn't going to do Legends of Zelda anymore

50:28.820 --> 50:33.220
because basically that it had leaked out that they were going to be doing

50:33.220 --> 50:39.420
the Legend of Zelda show and that kind of, I don't know, spooked Nintendo,

50:39.420 --> 50:41.700
but basically say, hey, listen, we're not going to do it anymore

50:41.700 --> 50:44.140
now that it's leaked out that we were going to do that.

50:44.140 --> 50:47.780
Seems silly to me that that would be a thing. But.

50:48.820 --> 50:51.580
Nintendo be Nintendo, I guess so.

50:52.340 --> 50:53.540
We can't have Zelda.

50:53.540 --> 50:56.780
We can't have nice things because you guys won't stop leaking information about it.

50:57.820 --> 51:01.060
Maybe they were worried that a lot more was going to leak out before it was ready.

51:01.060 --> 51:04.740
It does seem like an odd reason to pull the plug completely on a project as well.

51:04.940 --> 51:09.900
In fact, usually usually the hype machine is kind of a big deal in Hollywood.

51:09.900 --> 51:13.660
I don't know if this is just I admit I'm a little ignorant to this, so I apologize.

51:13.660 --> 51:17.780
But I don't know if this may be a culture thing around like Japanese culture

51:17.780 --> 51:22.420
and the hype for cinema and TV and projects around there and our culture,

51:22.420 --> 51:26.740
because like we find out about projects before somebody's ever even been cast.

51:27.100 --> 51:29.820
You know, Marvel gets out there on stage and says,

51:29.940 --> 51:34.740
here's the roadmap for Marvel Cinematic Universe phase two all the way through 2025

51:35.100 --> 51:38.540
before we've even like inked a deal to write a fucking script.

51:38.820 --> 51:40.700
Like that's just part of the height.

51:40.700 --> 51:43.300
Like y'all think video games are announced too early.

51:43.460 --> 51:45.380
Look at fucking movies, OK?

51:45.380 --> 51:46.980
Like we find out about this.

51:46.980 --> 51:51.500
So to find out that a project is being started years before they've even shot

51:51.500 --> 51:55.340
one frame or anything is very much a part of like the Hollywood Entertainment

51:55.340 --> 52:00.660
Tonight, Access Hollywood variety deadline and all that type of culture.

52:01.180 --> 52:04.580
I wonder if it's just and I again, I'm saying I am ignorant.

52:04.580 --> 52:08.500
I don't know how this works in Japan because I haven't lived there

52:08.500 --> 52:12.260
or followed enough of their culture there where maybe it is not

52:12.260 --> 52:14.180
the same type of hype machine.

52:14.180 --> 52:17.780
So when Nintendo kind of heard that this was going on,

52:17.820 --> 52:20.940
they saw it as a threat and they pulled the plug.

52:21.940 --> 52:23.180
That's my only that's all.

52:23.180 --> 52:25.060
That's all I've got to go off of, honestly,

52:25.060 --> 52:29.460
because you just don't usually hear about these things stopping because of leaks.

52:29.460 --> 52:32.420
But also, Nintendo is fiercely protective of its properties

52:33.140 --> 52:34.740
for better and for worse.

52:34.740 --> 52:36.380
So. Yeah.

52:36.380 --> 52:38.860
So, I mean, it's unfortunate.

52:39.180 --> 52:42.500
Does this mean we're not getting the Switch Pro anymore because it's leaked out?

52:42.500 --> 52:46.820
You know that there are lots of information allegedly has leaked out about it.

52:46.820 --> 52:48.060
You know that it's coming.

52:48.060 --> 52:50.260
So does that mean we're not getting that anymore?

52:50.740 --> 52:52.300
I doubt it.

52:52.300 --> 52:55.820
Tiger Con Chat says also Nintendo is banking on that Super Mario

52:55.820 --> 52:57.260
Brothers animated movie.

52:57.260 --> 53:01.260
It could make or break them in terms of making movies from some of their IPs.

53:01.620 --> 53:05.260
Could you could Universal have approached them when the rumor came out and said,

53:05.460 --> 53:09.100
hey, we can do something better, but you've got to call this deal off?

53:09.140 --> 53:13.220
I don't know. Maybe I'm no, I'm adding I'm adding too much drama into it.

53:14.260 --> 53:16.220
I don't I don't think that was.

53:16.220 --> 53:19.860
Yeah, I don't think that's going to be a anything has to do with it.

53:20.260 --> 53:24.300
I think if anything now, I mean, because I mean, granted, this took place

53:24.300 --> 53:28.820
like years ago, I mean, look at like what we have on Netflix now.

53:28.820 --> 53:33.100
There's like so many series based off of video games that done really well.

53:33.420 --> 53:36.660
So I would think that they'd be less hesitant to put out something now.

53:38.420 --> 53:40.180
Maybe there's something in development

53:40.180 --> 53:43.020
and just hasn't been leaked out because they learned the lesson the first time.

53:43.020 --> 53:43.620
I don't know.

53:43.620 --> 53:49.420
So it's I doubt that now if something like that were to happen,

53:49.420 --> 53:52.620
I would think that they would be ahead of it, kind of trying to promote it a bit.

53:53.660 --> 53:55.500
Then again, Nintendo's weird.

53:55.500 --> 53:57.980
And so who knows? Who knows?

53:57.980 --> 54:00.740
All right. What else you have for us, Loki?

54:00.740 --> 54:03.700
All right. So apparently,

54:04.140 --> 54:09.460
you know, we had the Mario sets come out for Lego now, and technically we had a

54:09.700 --> 54:15.980
Sonic the Hedgehog set come out in the form of a pack for Lego dimensions.

54:16.220 --> 54:19.580
But now, thanks to the whole,

54:21.180 --> 54:25.620
you know, fan submission process that they have available for Lego ideas,

54:25.900 --> 54:30.380
it's there is a set that reached 10,000 fan supporters,

54:30.380 --> 54:33.100
which means it goes through the Lego review process.

54:33.380 --> 54:37.380
And Lego has decided that, yes, we will go ahead and make a Sonic

54:37.700 --> 54:40.820
Green Hills set for Lego.

54:40.820 --> 54:44.460
So it's got right now based on the initial prototype

54:44.460 --> 54:49.300
was like this giant Eggman robot, Sonic the Hedgehog minifigs

54:49.300 --> 54:54.140
and, you know, some stuff that you would see in Green Hill Zone.

54:54.500 --> 54:59.140
But I would imagine we might see some more sets based on that if it sells well.

54:59.140 --> 55:01.900
But it's still pretty cool that that's going to be a thing.

55:01.940 --> 55:06.020
No word on necessarily when it's coming, but I'd expect sometime later this year.

55:07.460 --> 55:08.580
That's pretty exciting.

55:08.580 --> 55:10.060
I think it makes sense.

55:10.060 --> 55:12.740
They've already had that mold for the Sonic character already.

55:12.740 --> 55:14.540
So that's kind of half the battle right there.

55:16.780 --> 55:20.140
Yeah, it'll be interesting to check it out.

55:20.580 --> 55:24.180
I'm curious to see if they'll gamify it at all, kind of like the Mario one.

55:24.860 --> 55:27.580
Well, there's some impressive technology there.

55:27.580 --> 55:29.500
I mean, yeah, that would be cool. They did that.

55:29.500 --> 55:30.380
I don't think so.

55:30.380 --> 55:33.140
In this case, I think it'll just be like a set,

55:33.300 --> 55:36.220
kind of like how the Minecraft sets aren't really gamified.

55:36.420 --> 55:39.820
It's just, you know, Lego set.

55:40.380 --> 55:44.580
I mean, it would be cool to have some more game type stuff with it.

55:44.580 --> 55:47.380
I mean, Dimensions was pretty cool, but.

55:47.380 --> 55:51.140
You know, I don't know, they don't sell that stuff anymore,

55:51.500 --> 55:55.100
but at least, you know, they have the mold, so that saves them some time, I guess.

55:55.300 --> 55:57.460
True. If they didn't destroy those.

55:58.500 --> 56:00.740
No, they don't destroy that stuff.

56:00.740 --> 56:04.100
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I mean, you can still play the Mario set with it.

56:04.340 --> 56:05.180
You know, true.

56:05.180 --> 56:09.060
You can make Mario versus Sonic happen in your imagination, in your house

56:09.060 --> 56:11.260
with the dueling Lego sets.

56:11.260 --> 56:15.540
Except Mario is going to be super huge compared to, you know, Sonic the Hedgehog.

56:15.660 --> 56:19.460
Sonic is minifig size and Mario is much larger than that.

56:19.460 --> 56:22.420
So I'm sure your imagination can make up the difference.

56:22.420 --> 56:23.940
I have no imagination.

56:23.940 --> 56:26.460
Sizes must be accurate.

56:27.060 --> 56:28.980
I don't know. We'll see.

56:28.980 --> 56:30.500
Yeah, I'm with Orange, right?

56:30.500 --> 56:32.620
Mario just ate a mega mushroom. That's all.

56:33.500 --> 56:35.540
All right. All right.

56:35.540 --> 56:38.820
But Sonic goes fast. All right.

56:38.860 --> 56:41.700
Let's move on and talk about a PlayStation 5 game

56:42.060 --> 56:45.540
that's getting a surprising kind of little change here before it's out.

56:46.700 --> 56:51.420
Destruction All-Stars has actually I'm sorry, it just recently released.

56:51.420 --> 56:52.740
I didn't realize this actually came out.

56:52.740 --> 56:56.460
Destruction All-Stars, the developer behind the game, Lucid Games,

56:56.460 --> 57:01.340
has put out an update for the game and it disables voice chat by default.

57:01.940 --> 57:07.540
In a tweet, they wrote, Lucid Games put All-Stars Hotfix 1.2.2 is live.

57:07.700 --> 57:11.900
Hotfix note threads disabled multiplayer lobby voice communications

57:11.900 --> 57:14.020
by default for all players.

57:14.260 --> 57:16.900
We are actively working on longer term enhancements

57:16.900 --> 57:18.940
to the voice communication system.

57:18.940 --> 57:22.180
So apparently the way it was before

57:22.780 --> 57:27.140
voice was on by default and it wasn't exactly easy to just mute everybody.

57:27.380 --> 57:31.700
You had to go into your PlayStation 5 menu and disable voice chat there.

57:32.380 --> 57:35.220
Otherwise, it would because even if you turned it off for your headset,

57:35.260 --> 57:39.020
you would still get voices through the DualSense controller speaker.

57:39.260 --> 57:43.980
And I'm sure there were no problems at all.

57:43.980 --> 57:46.340
Are you saying people were saying naughty words through that?

57:46.340 --> 57:49.660
You mean if you put a microphone and no accountability in front of somebody,

57:49.660 --> 57:52.260
they're going to say some really shitty things you don't say.

57:52.420 --> 57:54.940
But it wasn't just that.

57:54.940 --> 57:57.500
But a lot of people don't even know that, like,

57:57.500 --> 57:59.860
the DualSense has like a mic thing built in.

58:00.100 --> 58:03.500
So some people didn't even know that they were transmitting.

58:03.700 --> 58:06.020
So they would get background noise

58:06.260 --> 58:09.540
that would come through, like the shifting around to the controller or the,

58:09.740 --> 58:13.660
you know, you know, have you ever played like Mario Kart online or something?

58:13.660 --> 58:15.860
And somebody blue shells you and you're like, fuck that guy.

58:16.060 --> 58:20.180
And if you don't know that you're muted, it's going to come or not muted.

58:20.180 --> 58:21.860
It's going to come through. Right.

58:21.860 --> 58:25.260
Or the or here's here's the classic one, too.

58:25.420 --> 58:29.260
You're playing a game and you're getting your ass kicked by somebody online.

58:29.340 --> 58:31.580
And then all of a sudden you just hear coming through the speaker.

58:31.820 --> 58:37.140
Mom, mom, I want the pizza rolls, mom.

58:38.340 --> 58:42.700
Right. And again, somebody doesn't know

58:43.060 --> 58:45.780
that their voice is being transmitted through the speaker.

58:46.180 --> 58:49.980
So now you just found out you're getting your butt kicked by a little kid

58:51.020 --> 58:53.940
who's waiting on pizza rolls.

58:55.660 --> 58:58.700
However, unfortunately, the really shitty stuff online

58:58.700 --> 59:03.100
was also making its way through a review on Ars Technica of the game

59:03.100 --> 59:09.180
actually called out obscenities, racist slurs and an alt right podcast

59:09.180 --> 59:13.140
featuring dark web and QAnon content that was played on replay,

59:13.420 --> 59:17.380
because that's what you want to hear when you're trying to do your escapism.

59:17.380 --> 59:19.580
Video games, I'm so sure.

59:19.940 --> 59:23.780
So they they removed voice chat by default.

59:23.780 --> 59:27.860
And actually, in this day and age, that's what most games do.

59:27.860 --> 59:30.740
So it's a little surprising they didn't do that that way to start.

59:31.300 --> 59:33.100
It's a very tough lesson to learn.

59:33.100 --> 59:37.060
But I will tell you what, I don't voice chat on games, period,

59:37.420 --> 59:40.620
unless I am playing a private game with people I know. That's it.

59:41.140 --> 59:43.900
And then even then, it's usually not through the game.

59:44.100 --> 59:47.660
It's usually through Discord, like just to make sure it's even

59:48.100 --> 59:50.540
under a separate set up and because you never know.

59:50.540 --> 59:52.220
Like it might be a PvP thing.

59:52.220 --> 59:55.140
You don't even want your voice going over to the other team. So

59:56.140 --> 59:59.260
see a Tiberian chat saying of my yelling.

59:59.420 --> 01:00:01.860
I thought that was toad. It might have been.

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:05.300
It very well might have been.

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:08.020
All right. Moving on, Loki,

01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:10.860
you got a story on something I'm very excited about.

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.500
You're excited about corrupted source code,

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.940
so you're not going to be able to get some of the DLC from Mass Effect.

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:17.860
That's a weird thing to be excited about.

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:20.420
I'm not that. All right. Shut up. Shut up.

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:24.900
But yeah, unfortunately, that tends to happen sometimes.

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:28.500
You know, you have something you want to re-release in like a 4K

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:33.580
legendary edition, you go back and up the source codes corrupted. Oh, no.

01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:39.060
So apparently there is going to be some DLC missing.

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:42.140
So Pinnacle Station,

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:46.620
which I guess is the third of the Citadel DLC.

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:52.100
And I'm not sure, are they going to try to remake it?

01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:56.100
Maybe not. No, it's Citadel's different.

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.380
Citadel's different DLC for part three.

01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:01.020
Pinnacle Station was the third, I think,

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:03.740
DLC that they did for the first game.

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:10.260
And honestly, like, you know, some of the hardcore fans and stuff are like,

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:11.820
oh, it's a good.

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:14.820
But I'm like, honestly, there's so much fucking content.

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:16.620
You're not missing that much.

01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:18.100
Like, calm down.

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.420
You're getting more.

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:22.300
You're getting more than the Wii U players got, OK?

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:25.860
The Wii U players for Mass Effect 3 got the first DLC

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:27.940
and then the entire development.

01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:29.460
Fuck it. We're not doing the rest of it.

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:32.620
So I couldn't reverse engineer some of that stuff.

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:33.700
Maybe just don't want to.

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:37.660
But yeah, the reason why that this is not necessarily

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:41.140
something that's recoverable versus some of the other stuff is because it was based

01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:44.500
or wasn't actually developed in the house by Bioware.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:47.060
But is actually outsourced to demurge studios.

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:51.580
And I guess they don't have the original files

01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:53.860
that are in an uncorrupted state.

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:56.660
So that's unfortunate.

01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:59.420
But they said that, you know, they could bring it back.

01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:03.060
But it'd take another six months just to do this with most of the team

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:03.700
that we've got.

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:07.220
And I wish we could do it, but we're not going to be able to.

01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:10.780
So there's going to be so much like I'm telling you, those games take

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:13.940
like 30 to 40 hours to get through just the base content.

01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:15.260
And you're getting three of them.

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:17.900
And then they're going to be adding a lot of DLC

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:20.820
that can be like six or seven hours on their own.

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:24.060
Like there's several of them for part two and three.

01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:26.180
You're going to have plenty of content for these games.

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:29.660
Don't worry about this one little piece that's missing.

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:33.380
And I'm with She-Hulk in our chat who says Mass Effect one is going to be fun.

01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:35.020
Anyway, they're doing a lot.

01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:38.140
I mean, they have gone back and changed a lot with one there.

01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:41.340
The interface looks a lot more like two and three now.

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.500
Like they totally changed the interface.

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.580
They've obviously gone back and done some of the graphics.

01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:48.860
There's some controversy around what they've done with some of the graphics.

01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:52.380
Some people did not like the look that Eden Prime had

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.980
because it kind of changed the vibe a little bit on the planet.

01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:59.060
I'm I want to you know, we've had such a short trailer.

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:01.300
I'm taking much more of a wait and see approach.

01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:04.380
And my honest response to a lot of the people that are criticizing

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:07.500
that is like you are free to, you know, have your criticisms,

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.660
but you're going to buy the game anyway.

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:11.540
Don't act like you're not going to.

01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:13.860
Like if you are that level of fan

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:17.020
where you're criticizing those sorts of things, I'm like, don't kid yourself.

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:18.900
You're going to buy the game.

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:22.020
And then at least once you've kind of actually like played through

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:23.780
the whole thing outside of just the trailer,

01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:26.100
then you can kind of formulate your long term opinion.

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:29.060
And either you didn't like it or you didn't or you liked it or you didn't,

01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:31.420
you know? Yeah, so.

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:36.660
But I'm sure you all want to know, since I've effectively bought Mass Effect

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:43.100
3 on the PC, the Xbox 360, the PlayStation 3 and the Wii U,

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:44.820
I even bought the Wii U version when it was on sale.

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:48.780
Will I be buying Mass Effect 3 a fifth time through this?

01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:51.660
And the answer is, of course, I will be.

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:54.300
Of course, I will be picking this up.

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:56.060
I haven't decided yet, though.

01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:59.540
I think I'm going to get it on Series X.

01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:03.900
But there's a part of my brain that thinks I might finally buy

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:06.180
into PlayStation five before then.

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:10.500
And if I do, I might get it on PlayStation five only because

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:17.940
the inevitable day that this goes over to play and thus Microsoft Game Pass,

01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:24.380
I will then have it a sixth time if I buy it on the PlayStation first.

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:26.500
But that's only if I get a PlayStation five,

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:29.340
which I actually don't think I'm going to be able to do by the time this is out.

01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:33.460
So I will probably realistically end up getting it on my Series X.

01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:34.740
So.

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:37.220
There is that.

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:41.460
SSG100 Matt in chat says, Rob, smart thinking, diversifying.

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:44.460
I know I got to think I got to think about how can I own this

01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:46.780
in as many places as possible?

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:48.860
All right. Moving on.

01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:51.140
Loki, what else you have for us?

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:53.780
So apparently Activision has been accused

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:58.580
of stealing the concept for a Call of Duty character.

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:00.980
So there's this character

01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:06.380
that was created called K Janice, who was part of a film pitch.

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:13.220
And apparently somehow they got Activision

01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:17.380
got a hold of this character, figured out, you know, the likeness of this.

01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:20.780
And they decided to use it in a Call of Duty game.

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:25.020
And they went to such extents to actually use

01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:29.340
the same photographer that they use for this pitch for a movie,

01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:33.300
use the same makeup artist, the same person

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:36.260
that was in those photography sessions as well.

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:41.300
And basically almost the same design for hair and costume.

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:47.740
But allegedly, you know, very they didn't steal anything.

01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:49.820
But apparently this

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:53.220
the original guy that pitched this

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:57.500
to the movie studio actually had copyrighted his story

01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:02.140
and characters back in 2012 and 2012, 2013.

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:06.940
But the photography and the photographs were a little bit more recent in 2020.

01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:10.740
But still, I mean, it it's hard to say, like, I mean,

01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:14.060
because a lot of this is just the person that they have playing this part,

01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:17.540
which is actually a streamer by the name of Alex Ziedra.

01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:21.180
But I don't know.

01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:24.740
At the same time, that's kind of like.

01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:29.540
It's it's awfully close, like I get it, if it's based off the same person,

01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:31.940
but like they look pretty identical.

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:36.100
I mean, because it's the same person, but I don't know.

01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:38.900
So anyways, that's a lawsuit that we're going to hear about for a while, I guess.

01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:42.540
Until they settle out of court and then we don't get any of the details,

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:44.660
because when they settle out of court, we never get the details.

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:47.740
That's just the way it goes. Yes. Yeah. All right.

01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:51.460
Well, I know nothing about the character.

01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:53.820
I have nothing to say about this because I really don't know.

01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:56.420
So, look, I kind of have to go with your opinion if you think it's

01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:59.460
if there's any merit to this or not, or if it's a little more.

01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:02.380
It's hard to say because all they're they're showing like photographs

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:04.540
with like the promotional materials,

01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:07.940
which basically looks like a photograph of the same person.

01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:12.140
But I mean, they're dressed up in a very similar like military fatigues

01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:16.500
and everything, the same like loadout and the same hair and everything, which is

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.620
like if it's the same person, I get that.

01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:22.660
But the same hair and makeup and the same kind of outfit,

01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:24.460
that's a little questionable.

01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:30.020
I don't know. It just especially if if they allegedly use those

01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:33.820
original photographs as kind of a base to build the character off of

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:38.860
and like modeled off of that, that is also questionable. All right.

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:42.620
Well, let's move on and talk about another story here

01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:45.020
before we get to the classic game of the week.

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:47.700
And this has to do with the delay for an older game

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:50.940
that was being remade, but apparently ran into some problems.

01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:54.300
I'm talking, of course, about Prince of Persia, The Sands of Time.

01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:59.300
If you weren't already aware, they are remaking this game for current consoles,

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:03.940
and they've decided to bump it back a little bit, saying in a statement,

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:06.780
we have made the decision to shift the release for Prince of Persia,

01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:10.300
The Sands of Time, Sands of Time remake to a later date.

01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:14.060
This extra development time will enable our teams to deliver a remake

01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:17.100
that feels fresh while remaining faithful to the original.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:20.980
It should be noted they don't give a target window in this update,

01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:23.420
which is fine because they probably don't know it yet,

01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:26.060
especially with everything pandemic going on right now.

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:28.020
They probably have no idea how long it's going to take

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:31.100
to fix some of the issues that they have been having.

01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:34.180
And apparently some folks were kind of in some of the like pre footage

01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:36.460
and stuff where we're seeing that there were some issues.

01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:39.660
So it sounds like they've definitely made the right call here and bumping it back.

01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:42.860
It'll be interesting to see, like, is this what is this mean a holiday?

01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:44.260
Does this mean like a year?

01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:46.820
How long is it going to be? Who knows?

01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:48.620
So, by the way, it should also be noted.

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:51.940
We just like we just talked about this game getting delayed not that long ago.

01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:54.420
It was supposed to originally come out in January.

01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:56.420
Then they delayed it back to March.

01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:59.100
Now they're delaying it. Tell who knows when.

01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:02.540
So this game will be out for PlayStation 4, Xbox

01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:09.020
one and PC via Epic Games Store and Ubisoft's own Uplay when it does come out.

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:12.140
So we will see the original, of course, came out in 2003.

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:16.180
Who knows? Maybe recent spotlights on buggy games that have come out,

01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:18.100
scared them off, I don't know.

01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:19.980
But there's that.

01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:23.380
SG100Matt in our chat says, whatever, get it done when it's done.

01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:27.220
Sands of Time was a great game and messing up this remake would suck.

01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:30.980
Yes, I know there were some people that I know that really love

01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:33.060
the Prince of Persia games that were kind of saying like,

01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:34.980
why haven't we had a new Prince of Persia game in a while?

01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:38.060
So this will definitely be something to hold it over,

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:41.420
but it's got to be done right or else, you know.

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:45.220
People will be very upset, won't they?

01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:48.340
All right. Well, let's people know, of course not.

01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:52.620
All right, let's get to a segment then where we spotlight a game

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:55.660
that is bug free, a classic game, shall we?

01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:00.500
All right. So now we're going to use the magic of Internet radio

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:05.220
and discord and all of that to get the classic game of the week,

01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:08.340
where every week here on the show, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault

01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:12.060
to find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking this game out.

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:13.620
Not that newfangled stuff.

01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:17.940
And I say magical because we actually have Dark Soccer here with us,

01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:20.180
even though she is not on the show tonight.

01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:22.100
Hi, Jamie, how are you?

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:27.340
Well, I'm sick of the sinus infection, so we'll see once I talk to the doctor tomorrow.

01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:31.220
Boo, I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm glad you're able to spare a few minutes here

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:36.100
before the show tonight to still walk us through the classic game of the week.

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:39.540
So without further fanfare, what is the classic game of the week?

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:44.420
The classic game of the week is known in America as Sorcer Stryker,

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:50.260
S-O-R-C-E-R Stryker, and it's a vertically scrolling shooter game

01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:51.580
that came out in 1993.

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:54.820
It was developed by Rising, which is now called Aiding,

01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:58.700
published by the Able Corp in Japan and in Europe.

01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:03.500
So basically, you are playing one of four bounty hunters

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:06.020
who has to overthrow the goblin empire

01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:12.420
and reclaim a bounty that was placed on King Cadwena, a violent kingdom.

01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:18.300
So the series is actually the Maho Daisakusen series.

01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:22.020
So the first game really was known as Maho Daisakusen.

01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:27.540
It also includes in that trilogy Kingdom Grand Prix and Daimaho.

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:31.340
It's also the first game that was made by Rising.

01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:38.940
So at any rate, the company was founded actually by former Naxatsoft

01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:42.780
and Compile staff, folks who worked on the Alest series.

01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:44.780
And we all know how great those shooters are.

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:49.340
And I know Compile from, you know, Gardic and all that stuff.

01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:50.980
Yeah, for sure.

01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:54.780
Well, Compile also gave us P.O.P.O., remember?

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:56.940
That's true. Great company.

01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:00.980
Probably every game of theirs has been a classic game at some point or another.

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:02.980
Well, that remains to be seen.

01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:06.780
But at any rate, the game first had an arcade release.

01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:10.220
It came out in May 1993.

01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:15.460
It did later get other ports and we can talk about that a bit later.

01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:19.420
So at any rate, it is a science fantasy theme.

01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:20.980
So it's a shooter up.

01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:26.380
It's very similar to Spriggan, where you play one of four characters

01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:28.260
through six different stages.

01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:30.700
I just love that you're in the violent kingdom.

01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:35.420
And it does have different elements from other Compile shooters.

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:39.340
So like, you know, the scrolling background until you reach the boss

01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:43.100
and all that and your different weapons, your main weapon and your sub weapon.

01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:47.380
And you have bombs to clean off the screen.

01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:50.340
But it also has some other stuff in common with M.U.S.H.A.

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:55.900
where you fight different mini bosses at certain stage stages of the game.

01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:59.500
You have a respawn system where you immediately start where you died.

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:06.460
You can get hit by an enemy or collide with stage objects to lose a life

01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:09.100
or lose your firepower as you go along.

01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:13.060
So basically, you have two loops of the game.

01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:15.940
You have to complete the first loop and then you start over

01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:19.260
and you get the true ending when you finish the second loop.

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:27.260
So the plot of the game actually comes a bit more through

01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:29.820
its supplementary materials with it.

01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:34.140
So, you know, there were different

01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:39.100
things that were released with it that would outline a little bit more of the story.

01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:45.580
So anyway, a little bit more about about the development of the game.

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:51.220
It was developed by a crew of about four members,

01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:55.780
including actually with designer Nakashima Kazuyuki

01:13:56.740 --> 01:14:01.060
and the programmer of the Spriggan game, Toyama Ichi,

01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:08.100
Yoko Kenichi and a freelance composer, Motoyama Atsuhiro.

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:12.060
And so they worked on this one.

01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:15.860
Actually, it came, Toyama was working right after the arcade

01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:18.460
release of both Spriggan and Spriggan Mark II.

01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:21.900
Those are games I might be bringing up later, too.

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:25.820
And so they were they founded Rising right after that

01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:28.420
with the desire to make a new a new game.

01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:33.860
And in fact, they also had connections to Toaplan,

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:36.180
you know, another game that did some amazing tutors.

01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:40.980
So they worked with Toaplan as the consultant.

01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:43.340
Toaplan was their consultant for it.

01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:47.220
And so the game started in development March 1992,

01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:49.780
and the staff was working out of the bedroom of an apartment

01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:52.780
using development tools provided by Toaplan.

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:56.940
And it was going to start off as a Chinese martial arts

01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:00.340
shooter called Hago Gekiren Saifu.

01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:04.620
However, it went a little bit different

01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:08.180
because they wanted to add worldwide appeal to it.

01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:10.820
And so they took things from different

01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:13.780
games that the others worked on.

01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:16.740
I mean, like I said, Musha, many of the other compile games

01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:20.340
and wanted to make it a little bit more fantasy,

01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:22.460
kind of a steampunk aesthetic to it.

01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:25.420
So they changed the whole kind of concept of the game

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:28.420
and they developed it in an apartment. That's nuts. Yeah.

01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:32.820
Well, I mean, think about what people do with games now.

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:34.620
Oh, yeah, no, I know, especially, you know,

01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:37.500
you have to remember it was a very different industry in the 90s

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.900
and teams were generally smaller as well.

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:41.940
But still, I mean,

01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:44.940
and they also did have support from Toaplan.

01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:47.780
So they had development tools, like really good development tools.

01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:53.180
So they they did some special designs

01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:57.220
with the ships to give them like these hand-like extremities

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.540
to give them character.

01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:03.460
But the designs were also an experiment to see if they could give

01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:06.860
operability and personality to keep it from

01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:09.140
but have it not interfere with their hitbox.

01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:12.820
So, you know, they they wanted to give a sense of story.

01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:14.220
They wanted to be a little bit different.

01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:21.500
So at any rate, you know, they even tried to put in like their

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:25.540
their muscular dude and then their little moe girl,

01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:28.500
you know, like an idol singer type girl, you know.

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:33.180
But they didn't really have, you know, all the appeal they quite wanted,

01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:37.300
but they were able to get get things to where they wanted to.

01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:40.180
And also, some of the characters were based off of Wizardry,

01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:43.380
the game, the game series, Wizardry. Oh, yeah.

01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:46.300
So they had some difficulty

01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:49.140
deciding on a name.

01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:52.180
It was first titled Mahou Daisensou.

01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:56.060
And then they with a little bit more brainstorming,

01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:58.100
it came out as Mahou Daisakusen.

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:03.660
So and that's where they, you know, kind of went through

01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:06.660
to produce this colorful, this vivid game.

01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:10.580
So it was first released into arcades by the Able Corporation

01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:14.340
across Europe and Japan, May 1993.

01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:16.540
And they used a TOA plan licensed arcade board.

01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:20.020
There was a CD music album out in 1994

01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:24.340
that was published in Japan by Shin Seisha.

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:27.620
And then there was a manga adaptation.

01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:30.180
Remember, I said there was more material that came with it.

01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:34.460
The first port of the game was, of course, on the X68000,

01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:36.700
published by E.A. Victor.

01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:39.140
And that came out on December 16th, 1994,

01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:41.100
and had a lot of different options,

01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:42.860
including different MIDI support.

01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:45.020
Then it came out on FM Towns,

01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:49.340
also again by Electric Arts and Victor in February 1995.

01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:53.300
And it had the Redbook audio from the X68000 version,

01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:56.140
but it also ran at a lower frame rate

01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:58.300
and had missing special effects.

01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:00.820
There was a mobile phone version by EasyWeb

01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:03.340
that was developed by Aiding once they were no longer rising.

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:07.740
And on November 2017,

01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:12.260
M2 released a new version of Sorcerer Striker

01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:16.300
as part of their M2 shot triggers for PS4.

01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:18.340
And it had exclusive additions,

01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:20.300
including an easier difficulty setting

01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:25.300
and two aircraft simultaneously in single player.

01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:31.860
As of August 1st, 1983,

01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:33.740
in Japan, Game Machine listed

01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:36.380
as their seventh most popular arcade game at the time.

01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:41.140
There were plenty of comparisons with Truxton made.

01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:44.860
The X68000 version had a lot of positive reception.

01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:45.860
I've seen it in hand,

01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:48.940
and it actually is a pretty damn good version.

01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:52.500
A few people were like, eh, it doesn't have what Alest had.

01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:56.740
But, you know, different people

01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:58.060
have just come out on the limit,

01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:01.380
since this is actually one of their favorite shooter games.

01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:03.740
And it says it tends to be for,

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:07.820
actually Kurt Kalata for Hardcore Gaming 101 said,

01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:08.900
it's an excellent game,

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:10.460
though one that tends to be forgotten

01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:14.300
in favor of Rising's more innovative and ambitious titles.

01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:17.260
Famitsu gave the PS4 version 25 out of 40.

01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:19.620
We know how tough Famitsu is.

01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:23.900
So it is the first one in the Mahou Daisakusen trilogy.

01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:26.540
There was a sequel called Kingdom Grand Prix,

01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:28.140
came out in arcades in 84,

01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:33.140
and then came out on Sega Saturn by Gaga Communications.

01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:34.780
It's a different kind of game though.

01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:36.140
And then there was Daimaho,

01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:39.940
which was released for arcades by Capcom in 2000.

01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:44.940
So I actually think it's a Capcom CPS1, I wanna say.

01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:45.820
Don't quote me yet.

01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:47.140
I think it's a CPS1.

01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:51.060
And then the characters that were in there,

01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:54.060
their names are Gain, Chita, Miyamoto, and Bonem,

01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:57.020
are guest characters in Battle Garaga

01:19:57.020 --> 01:19:59.380
and Armed Police Batrider.

01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:01.860
Battle Garaga is one I'm probably gonna do again

01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:02.700
in the future,

01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:05.340
because it's one of those iconic shooters.

01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:07.300
Now don't go spoiling it at all.

01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:08.940
No, I just said I might do it.

01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:13.000
But I mean, this game is, I've played it a couple of times.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.980
I mean, I'm not super great at shooters,

01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:15.820
but it's a fun one.

01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:20.820
I mean, it definitely has kind of that mix of compile meets,

01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:24.500
you know, compile shooter meets a last.

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:26.660
So it's pretty, pretty cool.

01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:28.460
And it's not every day you hear about wizardry

01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:30.940
inspiring a shooter, that's for sure.

01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:32.900
Yeah, I mean, it was just a couple of characters

01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:35.540
that were inspired by wizardry.

01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:36.380
But still.

01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:41.380
So, but it's, you know, it's a worthwhile game, you know,

01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:43.820
and hold on, I'm gonna real quick confirm

01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:45.940
what Daima-ho was released on.

01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:49.820
I wanna say that it was a CPS,

01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:53.720
sorry, it was a CPS2, my apologies.

01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:59.640
Yeah, I knew it was like an earlier though one,

01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:00.860
so there you go.

01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:04.460
I mean, even the sequels are really great games.

01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:09.460
I played Daima-ho before I played the first one, so.

01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:10.860
All right.

01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:12.620
Well, thank you for walking us through

01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:16.460
your classic game of the week, Sorcerer Striker.

01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:17.280
Sorcerer.

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:18.380
Sorcerer, excuse me.

01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:20.720
I keep wanting to say, it's the wizardry on the brain.

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:21.660
I keep wanting to say sorcerer.

01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:22.900
Okay, Sorcerer Striker.

01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:25.620
It's a magic related game, so.

01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:27.140
Yeah.

01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:29.980
All right, well, before we go back to the studio live,

01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:34.100
Dark Sakura, any parting words for the folks tonight?

01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:38.700
I would like for my sinuses to be drilled out

01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:41.000
and inflated so that they don't feel like my face

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.740
is going to crush itself.

01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:43.580
That's all.

01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:44.900
Well, you should let your doctor know.

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:45.740
All right.

01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:46.560
I am.

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.660
Take care of Dark Sakura, we'll see you next week.

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:49.660
All right, bye.

01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:53.740
All right, thanks to Jamie, Dark Sakura,

01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:55.660
for filling in there earlier today.

01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:57.500
So we still got to have her voice on the show this week

01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:00.420
with the classic game of the week, Sorcerer Striker,

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:03.740
which I have to admit, not a title I was super familiar with

01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:05.260
and this happens with her pick sometimes.

01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:06.380
I'm like, I don't remember this one.

01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:08.620
And I was watching chat during that segment

01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:10.940
and there was several people in chat kind of having it,

01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:13.020
like, I swear I've played something like this,

01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:15.180
but I don't think it was this.

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:17.100
The closest thing I can think of is Dragon Spirit,

01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:18.940
but that's really like actually playing a dragon,

01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:20.660
but it would still have like that same kind of like,

01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:21.840
like wizardry type of thing.

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:24.820
But I can't think of what it is that's really like this,

01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:26.020
but that was a good pick.

01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:27.480
It was fun to check out.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.440
Speaking of classics, by the way,

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:34.580
Loki, sorry, Mr. Smoosh just ran right under this table here.

01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:35.960
You can't see it on stream.

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.780
He's got a case of the zoomies right now.

01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:39.280
So I'm a little bit distracted.

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:41.400
Mr. Smoosh, of course, my kitty.

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:45.200
So Loki, you know how there's,

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.660
I drive down J Street downtown a lot

01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:49.720
to refill up on my Pokeballs.

01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:52.080
I use Bluetooth, so I'm not trying to spin

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.480
Pokestops and all that.

01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:55.720
There's that little retro gaming store.

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:56.640
Have you ever seen that?

01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:57.480
It's brand new.

01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:58.300
They just put-

01:22:58.300 --> 01:22:59.140
I know what you're talking about, yeah.

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:01.720
I finally went today and to check it out.

01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:04.860
So, and I bought something while I was there.

01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:06.240
And it's, I don't know if anyone noticed,

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:08.360
we have a new decoration in the studio.

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:10.220
I'll try to take it down from the hook here.

01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:12.560
It's a little hard to see, but it's a little,

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.520
it's one of those like 3D frames.

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:16.560
If I tilt it a little bit, you can see some of the 3D,

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:20.760
but you can maybe see what screen it is representing there.

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:22.520
Hopefully you can kind of tell, sorry.

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:25.200
I know it's on Twitch and sorry to the podcast folks.

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.600
What's that, Loki?

01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:28.280
I said, that's pretty cool.

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.100
Yeah.

01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:29.940
I liked this.

01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:30.760
It was only 20 bucks.

01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:32.360
So I was like, all right, I'm kind of into that.

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:35.400
And of course the game, it's Castlevania is the game

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:39.480
that's Simon kind of going at the Reaper there and that.

01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:40.620
So I thought that was really cool.

01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:41.680
So I picked that up.

01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:45.120
So yeah, little, speaking of classic games,

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.760
a little trinket I picked up this week.

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:49.240
So that's dangerous because they have more of them.

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:52.200
There was one for Contra and there was one for Sonic.

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:54.160
And I was like, I kind of want them all.

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:55.880
I think that would be fun little decoration

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.440
for the new studio whenever we get there.

01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:00.520
So SGO and Hunter Matt says, oh, those things are cool.

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:01.800
See them at cons a bunch.

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:04.280
Yeah, I think, so one thing I noticed about this place,

01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:06.080
they definitely don't just have games.

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:09.040
They're very, they're leaning hard into like gaming culture,

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:12.600
you know, hats, lamps, you know,

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:14.520
the kind of like Game Stops have to do too,

01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:15.840
is, you know, you can't just make your money

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:16.920
off the games alone.

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:18.320
It's kind of the gaming culture stuff,

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:19.840
but I saw this and I thought it was cute.

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:20.920
No, I love Castlevania.

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:21.760
So I had to pick that.

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:24.520
And plus this is like my favorite stage

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:25.840
and music in Castlevania.

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:26.840
So it's a good pick.

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:27.720
So there you go.

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:31.080
Anyway, all right, let's do some rapid fire news, shall we?

01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:33.320
Where we quickly talk about some other things going on

01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:34.760
in the gaming world this week.

01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:36.280
Loki.

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:39.840
Yes, so apparently because it's gotten a lot of attention

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:44.440
about how tall is that very large woman or vampire

01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:48.000
in the new Resident Evil Village game.

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:53.960
So Lady Dimitrescu, she is now officially

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:59.200
according to Capcom, nine foot six.

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:03.520
So if you need to, you know, need that for some reason,

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:06.560
I don't know, but people were fawning over

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:10.680
and now you know, 2.9 meters or 9.6 feet.

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:13.120
Thank you, Capcom, for legitimizing all of that.

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:13.960
Thanks.

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:16.040
Nine foot six inches, I guess nine and a half inch

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:17.240
or nine and a half feet.

01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:22.960
And then we have Final Fantasy XII, the Zodiac Age,

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.640
finally heading to Games Pass.

01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:28.200
So that's gonna be coming out very soon.

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:30.400
I don't know the exact date yet,

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.560
but right around the corner.

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:33.440
Oh, here we go.

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.800
So it's gonna be coming out February 11th

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:39.800
and along with it, Jurassic World Evolution,

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:43.880
The Falconer, Project Winter, Ghosts of a Tale,

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.280
Stealth Inc. 2, A Game of Clones

01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:48.640
and Wolfenstein Youngblood.

01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:52.560
So coming out early this month.

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:54.560
All right.

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.600
Well, I wanna talk a little bit about Ingress

01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:59.600
cause I play that game a little bit, as you guys know.

01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:02.320
And I don't often talk about the news and updates for this,

01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:04.360
but this one kind of also goes out to my pals

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:07.500
who also play Pokemon Go, another Niantic game,

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:11.040
because a lot of times where Ingress tends to go,

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:12.760
Pokemon Go tends to follow.

01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:14.880
And I'm gonna talk about a monthly sub

01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:16.520
that they have announced that's coming to Ingress

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:19.360
where you will actually be able to give them money

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:22.180
on a monthly basis for some additional perks.

01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:24.200
I should point out though, because you guys,

01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:27.480
I know a lot more people play Pokemon Go than play Ingress.

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:31.440
But one thing that's finally came to Ingress this week

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.440
after like years of asking,

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:36.220
and this has been in Pokemon Go forever.

01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:38.480
When you go to the, well, in Pokemon Go,

01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:41.900
you can see if you've spun a Poke Stop or not, right?

01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:44.000
If there's a little white ring around the Poke Stop,

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.080
then you've never visited it.

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:47.120
And once you spin it, then that white ring goes away,

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:48.000
right?

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.700
Well, in Ingress, there are specific achievements

01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:53.000
for visiting unique places and hacking stuff

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:53.920
and capturing stuff.

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:56.600
And we have never been able to see if we've ever hacked

01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.200
or captured a portal before.

01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:00.940
But now on the Ingress Intel Map, as of this week,

01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:02.760
you can actually have a display.

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:04.480
These are portals you've hacked.

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:06.100
These are portals you've captured

01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:08.760
to make the hunt for unique portals a lot easier.

01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:10.380
And they say that they are bringing this

01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:12.820
to the in-game client as well.

01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:14.760
So that is very exciting.

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.120
It was really fun for me to go and look at a city

01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:20.000
like Chicago that I visited a couple times

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.960
and I did an Ingress anomaly there years ago.

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:24.080
You may remember, I've talked about it on this show.

01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:27.060
It was really fun to see, like, here are the parts of town

01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:28.880
that I hacked up and down the street.

01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:31.900
Here's the parts where I must've just done a couple hacks

01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:35.120
driving by in a Lyft or Uber or whatever.

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:37.080
And here are places with tons of portals

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:37.920
I didn't touch at all.

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:38.960
It was kind of fun to me.

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:41.520
I like the whole, like, here's how to track

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:42.880
where I've been in the world.

01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:44.480
Anyway, I'm digressing a little bit,

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:47.280
but I'm just kind of showing, like, Ingress, Pokemon Go.

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:49.260
They're tied together a little bit sometimes.

01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:51.080
And Niantic announced this week

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:53.840
that there will be a monthly subscription coming to Ingress

01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:55.820
called CORE, which stands for

01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:58.920
Community Offers Recognition and Expansion.

01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:03.920
They say that it will be $5 a month, $4.99, but $5, come on.

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:06.240
And the rewards you will get,

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:10.880
you will get a 500 slot expansion to your inventory.

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:12.920
That's huge, let me tell you, right there.

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:14.600
There are people that will be willing to pay it

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:15.720
just for that alone,

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:18.720
because your inventory is so limited in that game.

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:21.720
And you are limited to 2,000 items,

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:23.300
and then you have an additional five,

01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:24.560
what they call key lockers,

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:25.800
where you can put keys to portals

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:28.440
up to 500 of them in those lockers, 600, I think,

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:29.960
actually now.

01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:32.320
But there's, like, your basic inventory,

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.120
bursters and rosa, is limited to 2,000.

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.240
You cannot expand that.

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:37.980
So the fact that this is happening is a huge deal.

01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:40.040
You will also get a special medal,

01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:42.120
special code name flare, whatever.

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:45.100
You get some monthly in-game currency,

01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:47.040
2,500 what they call CMUs,

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:48.520
and you get a loadout kit,

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.780
which I assume is gonna be, you know, some gear.

01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:55.180
And then you will be able to, also on the Intel map,

01:28:55.180 --> 01:29:00.180
you can go and see your inventory and your portal keys.

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:04.000
That's huge for planning big fields.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.440
There's gonna be some people that will love that for,

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.480
oh, I've got a key to that, I got a key to that.

01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:10.760
So it's gonna be interesting.

01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:12.560
Five bucks a month, that's a lot.

01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:14.880
But again, I know people that,

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:16.580
I will probably do it, honestly.

01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:17.800
I play enough of that game.

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:20.780
You know, I probably play almost as much of that

01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:22.520
as I do something like Final Fantasy XIV,

01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:24.820
and I pay three times as much as Final Fantasy XIV.

01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:27.000
So I'll probably do it.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.200
Loki, you probably won't do it

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:30.000
because you don't play enough Ingress, right?

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.720
I don't play any Ingress, so that's a definite,

01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:34.840
that's a hard no.

01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:37.720
ActDeftInChat says,

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:40.280
I do wonder if they plan to implement this for Go.

01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:43.000
I mean, we already pay for events in Pogo.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.440
That comment, of course, coming from our chat room.

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:47.000
That's exactly why I brought it up.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.680
I don't think we have a lot of listeners

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:49.880
who even know what Ingress is,

01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:52.120
but I bet there's a lot of you that do play Pokemon Go.

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:54.800
And I just kind of wanted to say, oh, look at this,

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:57.160
because this might be what, you know,

01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:59.320
again, we don't know until they make an official announcement

01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:01.120
but it's interesting, isn't it?

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:04.320
Here's a game that admittedly I've never played

01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:08.360
but always comes up because it was in the release dates once

01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:09.320
and we couldn't stop laughing.

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:11.200
It's AlpacaBall.

01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:13.160
Did you know AlpacaBall All-Stars

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:14.720
is a game that's out there right now?

01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:16.720
Well, you can get a free update to the game

01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:18.520
if you're somebody that's playing this game right now.

01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.880
It is a Lunar New Year update.

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:22.520
So you can actually get in there

01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:25.360
and it's a free update that's coming out February 5th.

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:30.360
So it's already come out and you will get a new pitch

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:35.480
and there is a new stage, I guess, called Chinatown

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:37.320
that is decked out with decorations

01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:38.760
to welcome the Lunar New Year.

01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:40.560
And there is a dragon in there

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:44.480
that will toss the soccer ball and the alpacas into the air,

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:46.600
just flinging that alpaca.

01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:50.320
All right, so check that out if you're a fan of AlpacaBall.

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:51.760
Loki, a couple more for us.

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:58.920
All right, so we've got Akira Yamaoka teasing something

01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:03.760
that he says is gonna be announced by the summer,

01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:08.400
something that I'm quite sure it will be the one

01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:10.840
that you've been waiting for, he says.

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:13.880
Oh, interesting.

01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:14.700
Oh, him.

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:18.120
He just had a birthday a couple of days ago.

01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:20.600
Yeah, and so apparently, you know,

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:23.080
he was like teasing something that this is part

01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:26.640
of an interview that he did with AI Hub.

01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:31.640
And since then they have pulled the interview

01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:35.400
by the request of an unspecified party.

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:36.680
Oh, yikes.

01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:39.840
Okay, hmm, the plot thickens.

01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:43.000
I guess we'll wait and see what that might mean.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.440
All right, let's not get too excited, but maybe a little.

01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:50.040
Yeah, I can think of at least one franchise

01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:51.000
he's involved with.

01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:54.240
All right, and of course, if you're not already aware,

01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:55.600
Silent Hill is what we're talking about,

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:58.320
but let's not set our expectations too high

01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:00.360
because that's only gonna lead to disappointment.

01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:03.380
Yeah. Yeah, and what else?

01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:05.940
And then we've got a,

01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:12.740
this Bimani piano game, Nostalgia, is now on PC.

01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:14.620
So you can check that out.

01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:18.180
It's, I don't know, I guess it's part

01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:21.020
of the economy amusement game station platform

01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:22.140
that they have.

01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:25.060
So it apparently is also going to support

01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:26.980
MIDI keyboards as well.

01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:27.820
Oh, cool.

01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:30.540
And you can play it, of course, like anything else

01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:34.460
that's on there with a basic core subscription

01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:39.460
of 1,628 yen a month or about 1,550.

01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:44.300
And you'll have access to every piece of content

01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:45.820
in the game.

01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:48.940
So I am not familiar with this game,

01:32:48.940 --> 01:32:52.320
but I mean, it looks like keyboard mania.

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:53.620
It's come up on the show before

01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:56.180
and I think I've seen, it looks like a lot of fun.

01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:58.620
Again, I'm kind of waiting to see

01:32:58.620 --> 01:33:03.420
if they will put out an official English support translation

01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:06.260
and localized support for the game.

01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:07.400
But I think it's really cool.

01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:09.300
It's neat that Bimani's still kind of kicking

01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:10.700
in these different ways.

01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:12.340
So.

01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:14.980
Yeah, I'm surprised we haven't heard anything else of like,

01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:16.460
because I know that you were doing the alpha test

01:33:16.460 --> 01:33:18.300
for like Dance Dance Revolution

01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:21.260
and then they have like 2DX and all that stuff.

01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:22.100
I'm wondering.

01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:26.220
Well, the pandemic happens and it's probably coming into it.

01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:27.960
Yeah, I guess.

01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:29.120
For DDR anyway.

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:30.520
All right.

01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:31.640
Let's travel around the world

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:33.120
and check out some release dates

01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:35.160
and some games that are coming out very soon.

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:37.320
I know we at least have one big one in the US this week.

01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:38.640
Right, Loki?

01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:39.480
Yeah.

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:40.320
So we've got a,

01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:42.360
it looks like Def Crown coming out of Nintendo Switch,

01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:44.520
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:46.640
Little Nightmares II on PC,

01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:50.040
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:53.600
Galgun Returns on PC and Nintendo Switch,

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.640
Super Mario 3D World,

01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:58.960
plus Bowser's Fury on Nintendo Switch.

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:03.960
And then we've got the three that we're releasing this week,

01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:08.600
Pixel Poops, Pixel Poops 64 and Pixel Poops number two.

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:13.120
PC, Commodore 64 and NES for those.

01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:16.840
How convenient that that's on the list.

01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:17.680
I love that.

01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:19.080
It's on there.

01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:22.880
Like, I mean, Wikipedia had it, so it must be official.

01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:26.520
Is that Mario 3D Worlds this week, isn't it?

01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:27.360
Yes, it is.

01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:28.200
Oh, I missed it.

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:29.040
Sorry.

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:31.560
It's on Friday, 3D World plus Bowser's Fury.

01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:32.400
All right.

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:33.240
I know I'm picking that one up.

01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:34.520
So I'm excited about that.

01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:35.360
All right.

01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:36.200
Let's travel over to Japan

01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:38.800
and check out what's coming out over there in Japan.

01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:40.960
Of course, Super Mario 3D World and Bowser's Fury

01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:42.920
also out in Japan this week on the 12th.

01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:44.840
That's kind of a worldwide release,

01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:46.960
which I'm sure doesn't surprise anyone.

01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:47.800
That is out on the Switch.

01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:50.680
And then a Fate Xstella celebration.

01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:53.800
Switch and then a Fate Xstella celebration box

01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:56.600
for the Switch is also out on the 11th this week.

01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:59.560
And those are pretty much your big releases on the Switch.

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:01.640
Checking the PlayStation 5.

01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:04.040
No, there's a third party putting out a headset,

01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:06.280
but we don't get any new games until next week.

01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:08.480
We get a new game on PlayStation 5.

01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:10.200
PlayStation 4 does have

01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:12.600
that same Fate Xstella celebration box

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:14.240
that I talked about on the Switch.

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:18.200
Otherwise, Little Nightmares II is coming out over there.

01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:19.560
So you can check that out.

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:21.440
And that's it for Japanese releases.

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:24.760
How about the UK, Loki, with Dark Sakura out tonight?

01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:27.040
We have Little Nightmares II coming out

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:31.320
on PlayStation 5 and 4.

01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:35.280
And it looks like Xbox One and Switch and PC.

01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:39.240
We've got Evoland on PlayStation 4.

01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:43.160
Eternam EX on Switch.

01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:46.160
We have Dex on Switch.

01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:47.640
And then they're getting also

01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:52.640
the Mario Red and Blue Edition Switch bundle

01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:55.960
and accessories.

01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:59.520
So that's gonna be bundled with that Super Mario 3D World.

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:04.520
And we've got Galgun Returns on Nintendo Switch.

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:09.080
They're also doing the standalone Super Mario 3D World

01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:11.320
and Bowser's Fury as well.

01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:12.880
And that's it.

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.000
All right.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.840
We've got a few more stories for you guys.

01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:19.040
And then we're gonna get to your questions in our chat room

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:19.920
as well as your emails.

01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:21.000
We have a couple of emails tonight.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.440
So we'll get to those shortly.

01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:25.440
But first, some more stories for you.

01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:29.160
Loki, this game that just will not leave the news.

01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:31.480
Every week, it's something.

01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:33.280
And you thought mods were problems

01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:36.160
when they were romancing Keanu Reeves.

01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:38.400
But now, apparently all mods are problems

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:42.440
because come to find out,

01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:44.840
in Cyberpunk, specifically.

01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:46.520
Yes, in Cyberpunk.

01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:51.160
There's a security exploit apparently in Cyberpunk

01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:53.200
when they added mod support.

01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:54.480
So they're saying,

01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:58.560
hey, be cautious because we have been made aware

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:02.400
that there is a vulnerability allows external DLL files

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:06.760
and in the game or vulnerability and external DLL files

01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:11.160
the game uses, which can be used to execute code on PCs.

01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:16.320
This is gonna be patch ASAP, but for now be cautious.

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:21.320
However, it has been patched as of Friday, so that is good.

01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:23.960
But just be aware that this stuff

01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:28.960
kind of pops up once in a while and it is Cyberpunk.

01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:31.200
So I mean, they're still working on it.

01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:34.640
Still trying to make sure the game works for everybody.

01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:35.920
Exactly.

01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:38.440
All right, well, this news came out this week

01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:40.320
and it's disappointing to some individuals.

01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:42.880
Although I have to say it's not incredibly surprising,

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:45.000
but Blizzard has basically confirmed

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.440
that Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4

01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:49.320
will not be happening this year.

01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:51.680
Which is interesting because they're doing

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:55.560
their own type of like online BlizzCon soon.

01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:57.320
I think it's in the next couple of weeks.

01:37:57.320 --> 01:37:59.120
I don't remember the exact day,

01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:00.280
but I think it's coming up real soon.

01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:01.280
It might even be this week.

01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:02.560
I just forget.

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:04.840
If somebody in chat knows, let me know.

01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:08.640
But this news came out during a earnings call.

01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:11.240
So they did their fourth quarter 2020 earnings call.

01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:15.320
And they basically said that Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2

01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:17.120
are not gonna be happening right now.

01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:19.960
I think some folks thought that maybe Diablo 4

01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:22.760
might make this year or even maybe Overwatch 2

01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:25.920
because it seems to build a lot on Overwatch 1.

01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:27.720
So it might be a little bit surprising.

01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:32.680
Again, knowing that Blizzard is headquartered in California

01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:37.200
and California has had a lot of the stringent shutdown laws

01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:41.520
and the fact that working from home

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:43.280
has probably put some bumps in the road,

01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:46.040
I'm not incredibly surprised.

01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:49.320
But it does leave me wondering what Blizzard plans

01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:52.320
to hype up or what they have coming this year.

01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:56.640
My concern is it's that Diablo phone game.

01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:59.360
Although everybody I've heard that's tried it

01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:01.160
says it's not bad.

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:02.800
Like a lot of people are writing it off

01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:04.000
because it's a mobile phone game,

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.920
but it actually is a pretty decent Diablo game.

01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:09.880
I wanna try it for myself before I really know

01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:12.480
because that's coming from fanboys at the fair.

01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:16.400
But that must be a thing for this year.

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:19.800
But again, after what happened a couple of Blizzcons ago,

01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:21.480
with that being the key announcement,

01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:23.960
I can't believe that that would be their key announcement

01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:24.800
for this year.

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:28.680
Now we've had the rumors about Diablo 2 getting remastered.

01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:30.920
Remember that whole thing where they picked up

01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:32.800
the studio back East and everything.

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:35.920
So maybe that's the thing they're gonna lean on this year.

01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:38.400
Maybe that's something they can get done a little faster.

01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:39.240
I don't know.

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:40.240
Anyway, oh, I found the dates for the event.

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:42.040
It's February 19th and 20th.

01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:44.480
So it is this month, it's coming up pretty soon.

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:47.480
So there you go, that's happening.

01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:51.400
So we'll see if they decide to give them a better date then.

01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:53.240
But for right now in their earnings report,

01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:55.360
they said we are making significant progress

01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:56.880
against our development pipeline

01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:59.120
for other key intellectual properties,

01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:03.140
which we expect to fuel further growth in 2022 and beyond.

01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:07.180
Well, we'll see what they've got.

01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:09.060
All right, moving on.

01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:11.180
Loki to something we never got.

01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:15.940
Yes, so there is a prototype of DuckTales

01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:17.140
that has been found.

01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:20.260
And one of the things that was discovered in the game,

01:40:20.260 --> 01:40:25.260
which is a unused soundtrack or yeah,

01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:27.700
unused song from the game

01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:29.620
that was originally supposed to be intended

01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:33.220
for the map screen, but they cut it out.

01:40:33.220 --> 01:40:35.860
So that was kind of cool that we got to hear that.

01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:36.700
Yeah.

01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:39.780
Yeah, and so this prototype was from,

01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:42.740
looks like February 5th, 1989.

01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:46.400
Wow, 22 years ago.

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:48.300
No, I can't math today.

01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:50.000
That would be 32 years ago.

01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:52.160
Wow, yeah.

01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:58.340
So that's pretty neat that they have that available

01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:00.580
to hear what might've been.

01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:02.820
Wasn't as good as some of the other music in the game,

01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:04.840
but it was still neat to hear it.

01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:07.820
Yeah, it's almost, I love the site

01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:09.880
that gets all the prototypes

01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:11.420
and all the differences and things.

01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:13.680
It's so neat to see the stuff that changed

01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:15.780
for whatever reason and just to kind of theorize

01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:17.160
like why would they have changed this

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:18.380
or done this a little differently?

01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:20.900
And like you said, maybe they just didn't receive

01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:22.540
the map song as well internally.

01:41:22.540 --> 01:41:25.260
So they decided to put a different song in instead.

01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:28.900
So, dark to see in chat says over at twitch.tv

01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:30.060
slash vog network.

01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:31.580
I definitely recommend looking up

01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:33.740
the alternative Transylvania music.

01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:36.340
I almost like it more than the one we got.

01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:40.580
So yeah, art is all in the eye of the beholder.

01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:42.180
So cool, I'll have to check.

01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:43.180
I haven't heard the song yet,

01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:44.940
so I'll have to check it out after the show.

01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:47.880
So, all right, well, meanwhile, another story from Loki.

01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:52.160
Yeah, and then I think we talked a little bit

01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:56.600
about how Valve is gonna be getting the receiving end

01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:59.560
of a lawsuit regarding patent infringement

01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:00.400
with their controller.

01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:04.400
Well, they have now been fined over 4 million

01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:07.240
for that patent infringement.

01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:12.080
This is coming from the, let's see,

01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:16.640
the company was Scuf, I guess, or S-C-U-F,

01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:20.320
and they're owned now by Corsair.

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:25.320
So they apparently, they found that they did impede

01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:30.940
on their patent and now they owe them that kind of money.

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:35.080
Yeah, I mean, I'm kind of surprised,

01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:39.280
but just kind of sucks for Valve.

01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:41.080
They can't catch a break with anything,

01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:42.600
any of the brick rules that they're releasing,

01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:45.400
but I don't know, what are you gonna do?

01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:47.040
At least it's not being produced anymore.

01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:50.560
So, keep the damages to a minimum.

01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:53.120
Well, one thing they could do is show up to court,

01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:57.960
although that was a different case, but still, still.

01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:00.960
All right, ending on a bit of a downer tonight, sorry,

01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:02.980
but it should definitely be brought up

01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:05.140
because unfortunately we lost somebody this week

01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:09.160
who is huge in gaming culture, and that is Robert A. Altman,

01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:12.560
who is the co-founder and CEO of ZeniMax.

01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:16.080
Bethesda in a statement saying he was a true visionary friend

01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:17.720
and believer in the spirit of people

01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:19.800
and the power of what they could accomplish together.

01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:21.440
He was an extraordinary leader

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:23.720
and an even better human being.

01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:25.800
There's a lot of stuff on Twitter,

01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:27.880
a lot of people talking about their reflections

01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:30.400
on having met Robert Altman and so forth

01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:32.400
and some of the things he kind of did with the company.

01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:34.800
I even know a couple of people that work over there

01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:36.080
and we're talking about some of the things

01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:38.540
that he did with the company and so forth.

01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:42.640
And it's sad, and obviously a lot of folks that work there

01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:45.600
are kind of mourning this.

01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:49.440
This is, I did not catch that there was a reason,

01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:51.320
not that it's any of our business,

01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:52.920
but I know in the year 2021,

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:55.480
a lot of people want to know, is it COVID?

01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:58.720
I don't know, and I don't know how much notice they had

01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:01.040
that if he was sick for a while or something like that,

01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:04.280
but the reality is that unfortunately he's passed away

01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:07.560
and now somebody else will become the CEO of Bethesda

01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:09.120
when the board meets next.

01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:11.600
So if you do want more information,

01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:15.100
including there's a nice little letter from his son

01:44:15.460 --> 01:44:18.100
that is available, twitter.com slash Bethesda,

01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:20.460
and there are some tweets from February 4th

01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:21.820
when this occurred.

01:44:21.820 --> 01:44:23.340
So you can check that out.

01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:25.400
All right.

01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:29.700
Ooh, SH100Matt bringing it back to a happier note.

01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:31.380
We'll kind of start our listener round table with this

01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:34.580
cause I can't believe I forgot to include this tonight.

01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:37.500
Meanwhile, the data miners finding the original code

01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:40.620
for the Super Mario Brothers Super Mario World soundtrack

01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:44.020
and folks recreating it in its uncompressed form

01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:45.500
sounds really cool.

01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:47.980
Yeah, I wish I'd prepped that to play on the show tonight.

01:44:47.980 --> 01:44:50.100
Sorry guys, but check it out on YouTube.

01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:52.140
I tweeted about it a few days ago.

01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:53.340
Loki, did you hear these?

01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:54.340
It was-

01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:56.060
I did, and it was probably a good thing

01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:57.740
that we didn't play any of that.

01:44:58.820 --> 01:44:59.660
I liked it.

01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:00.580
It was, oh yeah, you're right.

01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:01.660
We might get shut down or something.

01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:02.500
Yeah, you're right.

01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:04.460
Cease and desist, happy and all that, you're right.

01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:06.020
So we probably shouldn't play it, but still,

01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:07.940
I can still tell you to go seek it out on YouTube

01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:09.260
cause I believe it's still up there.

01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:10.540
So basically what they did,

01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:13.420
they found the uncompressed samples

01:45:13.420 --> 01:45:15.300
before they went into the cartridge.

01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:17.220
And then obviously you have to compress stuff down a lot

01:45:17.220 --> 01:45:19.660
to fit into 16-bit cartridge, right?

01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:22.060
So the song sounded one way to us

01:45:22.060 --> 01:45:23.660
because we heard the compressed audio,

01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:27.340
but somebody rebuilt the music with the uncompressed audio

01:45:27.340 --> 01:45:29.420
and it sounds different because they don't,

01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:31.980
it doesn't sound so like tin can, I guess,

01:45:31.980 --> 01:45:34.460
because it's compressed and it's really different.

01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:36.420
So you should really check that out.

01:45:36.420 --> 01:45:39.420
And SSJ100Matt's given you a convenient link in the chat

01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:41.660
there for those that are listening live.

01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:43.940
For those that are on the podcast,

01:45:43.940 --> 01:45:45.340
I would just encourage you to go to YouTube

01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:48.940
and look for, you know, Super Mario Brothers Uncompressed

01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:50.860
or look for it on Google News

01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:52.260
cause a lot of sites were covering this

01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:54.620
cause it's very much like, wow,

01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:56.140
like difference with the sound.

01:45:56.140 --> 01:45:58.700
I don't know if, yeah, it's pretty cool.

01:45:58.700 --> 01:46:00.380
Oh yeah, ACT-F points out it's on Discord.

01:46:00.380 --> 01:46:01.500
Thank you, you're right.

01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:03.740
Somebody posted a tweet and it wasn't my tweet,

01:46:03.740 --> 01:46:05.860
somebody else's tweet over in Discord.

01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:08.220
So a good cheap plug for our Discord

01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:10.500
if you wanna join us over at vognetwork.com,

01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:13.660
vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:46:13.660 --> 01:46:15.600
Dr. Tsuya is saying I saw something similar

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:17.620
for the Donkey Kong Country OST.

01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:19.220
I think I remember seeing that too.

01:46:19.220 --> 01:46:20.220
That was pretty wild.

01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:23.500
All right, before we get to last minute stories

01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:25.860
or any further questions, let's get to the mailbag.

01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:27.620
We have a couple of emails tonight.

01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:31.300
So let's start with another quick one.

01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:32.660
I think this is from the same one

01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:34.340
who sent the quick email last week,

01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:37.740
but this time it's signed so I can give credit.

01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:39.580
So here's our first email for tonight.

01:46:39.580 --> 01:46:40.620
If you wanna email us,

01:46:40.620 --> 01:46:42.980
participate at orangelaungeradio.com

01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:44.300
is the place to send it.

01:46:44.300 --> 01:46:46.740
So the email tonight goes,

01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:50.440
what is the most boring video game you have ever played?

01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:53.320
And it's signed D from Waterloo, Iowa.

01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:57.980
I'm laughing cause I can't help but think of the ABBA song.

01:46:57.980 --> 01:47:00.840
I'm sure you're, if you really are from Waterloo, Iowa,

01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:02.520
you're probably sick as hell of that joke,

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:05.600
but I can't help it, it's a good song, it's a bop.

01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:07.340
All right, back to the question though.

01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:10.300
What is the most boring video game you've ever played?

01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:12.700
I don't even know.

01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:16.920
I'm trying to think of something that's incredibly boring.

01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:24.220
I get very bored with tactical games.

01:47:24.220 --> 01:47:26.600
So I'm not gonna make a lot of friends with this answer,

01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:28.660
but I'm gonna say Disgaea.

01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:29.740
Sorry.

01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:32.220
I just cannot get into those tactical games,

01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:35.340
try as I might, except for some reason,

01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:37.260
Final Fantasy Tactics, exception to the rule.

01:47:38.020 --> 01:47:38.860
I can play that and I love that game.

01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:41.620
Maybe it's just because I've always been kind of a,

01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:43.380
you know, Final Fantasy fan boy,

01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:44.380
and I'm willing to admit that.

01:47:44.380 --> 01:47:46.020
So maybe I kind of cut that game a break

01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:47.700
where I didn't a lot of other games,

01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:50.100
but I just, I could not get into like

01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:53.420
the really hardcore tactical stuff like Disgaea,

01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:55.020
or even when it comes to like Advance Wars,

01:47:55.020 --> 01:47:56.500
I can't get into that either.

01:47:56.500 --> 01:48:00.020
And so I just, I don't get very excited playing those games

01:48:00.020 --> 01:48:02.440
and they don't hold my attention very long.

01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:04.220
I know that answer is not gonna be popular.

01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:05.820
I'm not saying they're bad games.

01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:07.780
I'm just saying they're not for me.

01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:12.060
So Bobby Black Wolf in chat says desert bus.

01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:12.900
DJ Rama S says-

01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:14.780
I mean, that's the obvious one.

01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:18.500
DJ Rama S says Final Fantasy VIII game was trash.

01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:21.800
TigerClownChat says a game can get boring

01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:23.620
when the action becomes repetitive.

01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:24.900
That's true too.

01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:27.940
What do you think, Loki?

01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:29.240
Did you think of anything?

01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:34.620
No, I mean, typically I'm not playing boring games.

01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:36.820
Why would I subject myself through all that?

01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:37.660
Yeah.

01:48:39.460 --> 01:48:42.900
I know there's been things I've subjected myself to.

01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:45.840
Usually it's when it becomes like a grind

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:47.140
that it gets kind of boring.

01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:51.300
I guess like, I don't know if I'm like

01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:54.700
trying to like a hundred percent something,

01:48:54.700 --> 01:48:57.020
I would think that sometimes it might be boring,

01:48:57.020 --> 01:49:00.020
but like typically I just don't spend time

01:49:00.020 --> 01:49:01.640
playing boring games.

01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:03.580
I don't have enough time as it is.

01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:05.220
I'm not going to just spend time

01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:06.960
playing all these boring games.

01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:13.960
Harry Potter, the Harry Potter game on mobile,

01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:17.600
the Niantic game, that's pretty boring.

01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:19.500
TigerClownChat says the type of games

01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:22.120
where you only do a single thing the entire game

01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:24.340
can get boring when there isn't variety.

01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:26.640
You know, TigerClown, I see that,

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:28.820
and I know there are games that exhibit that,

01:49:28.820 --> 01:49:32.180
but I also think that there have been some incredible games

01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:33.460
that are simple.

01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:36.980
I think of a game like Kaboom, there's not a lot to it.

01:49:36.980 --> 01:49:40.700
You catch bombs in the little water wells, that's it.

01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:43.340
You spend a little, but something about,

01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:46.360
in like a lot of those older games on the Atari 2600

01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:49.620
had incredibly simple themes and could be repetitive,

01:49:49.620 --> 01:49:52.300
but if it was the right mix,

01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:54.300
then it actually was a lot of fun.

01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:57.060
But I will say, and to your credit, TigerClaw,

01:49:57.060 --> 01:49:59.140
there were a lot of Atari 2600 games

01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:02.500
that were also very boring and got old very fast

01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:03.860
for a very similar reason.

01:50:03.860 --> 01:50:05.260
In fact, here's another, you know what,

01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:07.680
is another great answer to this question, in my opinion,

01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:09.260
if you wanna go back to Atari 2600,

01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:11.500
and again, you're not gonna like it

01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:13.920
because a lot of people put this game up on a pedestal,

01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:17.300
and I'm not sure why, Sword Quest.

01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:18.820
You remember those games, Sword Quest Fire,

01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:20.380
Sword Quest Earth, Sword Quest,

01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:22.900
I think they only ever really finished two of them.

01:50:22.900 --> 01:50:24.900
I'm sorry, they're not, like,

01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:26.560
they're not that great of games

01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:29.860
because they just try to kinda do a lot,

01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:31.860
and it's excruciatingly hard,

01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:33.380
and if you don't have the manual,

01:50:33.380 --> 01:50:35.780
you don't know what the hell you're doing,

01:50:35.780 --> 01:50:37.660
I get that some people ate that shit up

01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:40.420
when they were a kid, and the whole contest around it,

01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:42.540
and they wanna see that fourth game released,

01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:45.300
I'm sorry, that is a 2600 game I couldn't get into,

01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:48.380
and I find it to be, quite frankly, a little bit boring.

01:50:48.380 --> 01:50:51.900
Pod Culture in Chat says, ET, that could be two, yeah.

01:50:53.300 --> 01:50:54.360
As Joan Hunter-Matt says,

01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:57.480
Dynasty Warriors has made a genre out of endlessly hacking

01:50:57.480 --> 01:50:59.220
and slashing a large group of enemies.

01:50:59.220 --> 01:51:01.060
See the Zelda, Gundam, and so forth.

01:51:01.100 --> 01:51:01.940
You know what, though?

01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:03.540
But I think that Zelda, the Zelda version,

01:51:03.540 --> 01:51:05.340
the Hyrule Warriors was a lot of fun.

01:51:05.340 --> 01:51:08.380
So, you know, I can, I get that.

01:51:08.380 --> 01:51:12.540
You know, 99 Nights, eh, it got a little boring,

01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:16.620
but, you know, I love the Hyrule Warriors, at least,

01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:18.220
so is that, so.

01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:19.460
Anyway, something to think about,

01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:21.540
and again, I also bring up the whole, like,

01:51:21.540 --> 01:51:23.220
you know, simple, repetitive thing,

01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:25.680
because as I was saying at the top of the show,

01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:27.820
this whole Pixel Poops thing, you know,

01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:29.760
as much as you might giggle and laugh

01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:32.480
at the name and the silly concept,

01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:36.500
it's actually, like, the simplicity of it is a lot of fun,

01:51:36.500 --> 01:51:40.600
and it is a great Atari 2600-esque kind of game.

01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:43.700
I haven't played Loki's interpretation of it enough yet,

01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:44.760
but I'm imagining it's gonna be

01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:45.920
a very similar type of thing.

01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:47.260
Yours is probably gonna be more of, like,

01:51:47.260 --> 01:51:50.040
a puzzle type of thing, it really sounds like.

01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:52.520
Is that you have to get the poop in the right place.

01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:54.560
Well, not necessarily.

01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:56.800
I mean, it's just a puzzle.

01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:59.480
It's not, I hardly call it a puzzle game.

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:03.520
I mean, it's like an old arcade game.

01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:05.840
I mean, that's kind of what it's based on.

01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:09.760
So, like, you know, you just have a simple goal,

01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:12.680
and you just have to, you have to strategize a little bit,

01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:14.720
because you don't wanna be,

01:52:16.220 --> 01:52:17.680
because of some of the level design,

01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:20.380
you have to think about where stuff's going,

01:52:20.380 --> 01:52:23.560
and, you know, try not to get too far away,

01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:27.000
and manage how much, you know, food you have,

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:27.840
and all that stuff.

01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:29.840
There's a little bit of thought into it,

01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:34.660
but I don't know, stop solving puzzles.

01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:35.960
I've mentioned this on a show before,

01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:39.440
in Aaron's Atari-inspired Pixel Poops,

01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:40.880
there's, like, a few things,

01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:42.240
there's a few twists that you might not expect.

01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:44.020
Like, when the score reaches a certain limit,

01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:45.600
some other stuff starts happening,

01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:48.160
and that's very Atari 2600-esque,

01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:50.440
that, like, it just instinctively gets harder

01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:51.260
at a certain point.

01:52:51.260 --> 01:52:53.160
And I discovered in the game last night, you guys,

01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:54.360
I didn't know this before.

01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:56.760
You ready for a Pixel Poops hot tip, okay?

01:52:56.760 --> 01:52:57.840
You ready for this?

01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:00.200
I did not realize until last night,

01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:02.660
if you walk through the door,

01:53:02.660 --> 01:53:05.860
it automatically ports you to that little white line

01:53:05.860 --> 01:53:07.640
where you refill the tacos.

01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:09.140
I didn't know that until last night,

01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:10.840
and maybe I'm not supposed to be saying that,

01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:13.440
but that's my hot tip, my YouTube tip.

01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:14.900
Number two will shock you.

01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:17.560
That is, literally, that is my little tip

01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:19.380
I learned about the game, and I didn't realize that.

01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:22.800
And just being able to save, like, five squares of movement

01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:25.780
by doing that, let me tell you, game changer.

01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:28.480
All right.

01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:31.440
Anyhow, YYR's in chat, by the way.

01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:33.220
I think he missed the plugs in the beginning of the show,

01:53:33.220 --> 01:53:34.360
but he's here now, and he says,

01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:36.520
I can vouch for Pixel Poops number two.

01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:38.560
It's definitely a different, deeper,

01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:41.060
and more challenging game than the original.

01:53:41.060 --> 01:53:43.640
If you buy it, you will find it to be worth your money.

01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:46.160
So he's saying it's some deep shit.

01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:49.000
All right.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.940
All right, enough plugs, enough plugs.

01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:54.520
Let's get into one more email here.

01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:57.220
Thank you, Dee, for the email.

01:53:57.220 --> 01:53:59.400
Next email, Fabrice from Belgium.

01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:01.780
We haven't heard from this individual in a very long time.

01:54:01.780 --> 01:54:04.220
Good to hear you from you again, my friend.

01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:05.260
Hello, everyone.

01:54:05.260 --> 01:54:06.740
It's been a while since I wrote in,

01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:10.300
but I'm still loyally listening since 2006.

01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:12.280
Wow, that means, that's 15 years.

01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:13.940
Thank you so much for that.

01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:16.400
I was wondering what you think Sega's place

01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:19.300
in video game history is and will be.

01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:21.520
Sega made four main consoles,

01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:26.080
and they are now longer out of hardware

01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:27.940
than they were in it.

01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:29.300
Ah, interesting point.

01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:32.660
So yes, the Dreamcast was discontinued 20 years ago.

01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:35.640
Also, Sony made five main consoles.

01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:38.220
Microsoft now has four too.

01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:40.800
Although I still think Sega remains legendary,

01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:42.580
but that's me since I'm a fan boy.

01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:44.400
The truth is that for a lot of people,

01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:48.440
the PlayStation 2 or the Xbox 360 was their first console.

01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:51.540
For them, Sega is just another game company.

01:54:51.540 --> 01:54:54.240
It feels like the vibe I have about Atari.

01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:56.360
They were an important video game company,

01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:58.400
but to me, they don't mean a lot.

01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:00.860
Well, as always, thank you for making the show.

01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:03.640
You make the mess we are in now a lot more bearable.

01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:04.940
Thank you so much for that.

01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:06.800
Yours truly, Fabrice from Belgium.

01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:10.360
Thank you for that kindhearted sentiment at the end there.

01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:11.620
Let's tackle the question.

01:55:11.620 --> 01:55:15.060
What do you think Sega's place in gaming history will be?

01:55:15.060 --> 01:55:18.740
Loki, you want to take this on, or I have an idea?

01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:24.180
I mean, Sonic, I don't know.

01:55:24.180 --> 01:55:28.020
They have a solid library of stuff

01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:29.900
that they'll be known for.

01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:33.660
And they're still kind of like, even their philosophy

01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:36.820
as far as how they treat fan games, I think,

01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:38.580
is something that I wish would be adopted

01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:42.900
by some other companies, like Nintendo.

01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:45.300
So I don't know.

01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:50.340
I think there's still just plenty to remember them by.

01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:51.780
Yeah.

01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:52.700
Some comments in chat.

01:55:52.700 --> 01:55:55.480
Quest Buster says, Sega's iconic and one of the greats.

01:55:55.480 --> 01:55:57.340
Whatever happens to it now can't take away

01:55:57.340 --> 01:55:59.180
its impact on game history.

01:55:59.180 --> 01:56:01.220
I think to find the answer to your question, Fabrice,

01:56:01.220 --> 01:56:02.780
I think we would have to do something

01:56:02.780 --> 01:56:05.100
that we do a lot in gaming, and that

01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:09.540
is look at the parallels in other entertainment venues,

01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:11.420
namely movies.

01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:12.940
Let's look at the movie industry.

01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:18.460
And there are a lot of movies that came out a long time ago

01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:22.180
from studios and companies that are no longer around.

01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:24.300
And kind of like you say in the email

01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:26.780
when you talk about Atari and so forth,

01:56:26.780 --> 01:56:30.340
there are some movies that people today don't necessarily

01:56:30.340 --> 01:56:32.260
care about, right?

01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:36.260
And I mean older movies, like an old musical.

01:56:36.260 --> 01:56:37.860
Say The Wizard of Oz.

01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:39.560
There are some people that will tell you,

01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:40.980
I love The Wizard of Oz.

01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:43.340
I love this movie so much because I

01:56:43.340 --> 01:56:45.020
used to watch it when I was a kid,

01:56:45.020 --> 01:56:46.980
and it was on TV at Thanksgiving.

01:56:46.980 --> 01:56:48.340
And my family would get together,

01:56:48.340 --> 01:56:51.420
and we'd love The Wizard of Oz, or replace that

01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:53.740
with The Sound of Music.

01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:55.540
That's my favorite musical of all time,

01:56:55.540 --> 01:56:59.380
even though these things were out a generation ago, right?

01:56:59.380 --> 01:57:01.140
So there's some people that look back on it

01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:02.880
and remember it very fondly, but there's

01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:06.420
other people that go, those movies are so hard to watch.

01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:08.540
They just they look so bad.

01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:09.980
They're grainy.

01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:12.460
They're musicals.

01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:14.820
All the movies, they're older musicals,

01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:18.780
and I don't like musicals, and so on and so on.

01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:22.100
Or you take another movie from the past

01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:24.700
that maybe just doesn't hold up well over time,

01:57:24.700 --> 01:57:28.380
where it's really hard to look at it through a 2021 lens

01:57:28.380 --> 01:57:31.260
because culture has shifted so much.

01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:37.460
So my point is, I think Sega has a place in that part of history

01:57:37.460 --> 01:57:40.700
where it's like they are what a classic movie studio was,

01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:44.740
what maybe like an MGM or something was back in the day.

01:57:44.740 --> 01:57:46.540
That's where Sega holds up.

01:57:46.540 --> 01:57:48.380
And there's going to be some people till the end of time

01:57:48.380 --> 01:57:50.140
that are like, I love Sonic.

01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:52.380
I played Sonic the Hedgehog growing up,

01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:56.940
or my dad made me play Sonic because he played it growing up

01:57:56.940 --> 01:57:58.140
and this was a thing.

01:57:58.140 --> 01:58:00.580
And I think it'll be a thing that gets brought out

01:58:00.580 --> 01:58:02.020
once in a while.

01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:05.500
Like, oh, remember this old game that we grew up with?

01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:06.020
It's funny.

01:58:06.020 --> 01:58:09.060
Actually, I talked about the classic gaming store visit

01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:11.660
earlier today, right?

01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:13.940
When I was there, it was just me in there

01:58:13.940 --> 01:58:15.500
and a couple of the employees.

01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:18.860
And at some point, a family came in, and they were looking at,

01:58:18.860 --> 01:58:21.260
they have Nintendo old 8-bit cartridges

01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:22.740
that are in the glass case.

01:58:22.740 --> 01:58:26.100
And there was a kid, like six or seven years old,

01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:28.540
that was very fascinated with the cartridges.

01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:31.220
They were something he'd seen in a textbook somewhere

01:58:31.220 --> 01:58:32.860
or in a movie he was fascinated with.

01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:35.700
He's like, wow, look at all these old games.

01:58:35.700 --> 01:58:37.300
Look at all these games.

01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:38.180
He's very fascinated.

01:58:38.180 --> 01:58:40.860
And the dad was there, and the mom was there too,

01:58:40.860 --> 01:58:42.580
although it was kind of a family of four.

01:58:42.580 --> 01:58:44.020
And the mom kind of went off to another part

01:58:44.020 --> 01:58:45.300
of the store with a girl.

01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:47.320
So it was just the dad and the little boy.

01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:49.380
And the dad was saying, yeah, these

01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:50.860
are the games that I grew up on.

01:58:50.860 --> 01:58:53.420
Can you guess which one I like to play a lot?

01:58:53.420 --> 01:58:56.740
And I remember the girl saying something about Donkey Kong

01:58:56.740 --> 01:58:57.380
or something.

01:58:57.380 --> 01:58:59.580
So they were kind of having a discussion like that.

01:58:59.580 --> 01:59:02.620
So I mean, that's, again, even though they

01:59:02.620 --> 01:59:04.900
don't make Nintendo games and NES cartridges anymore,

01:59:04.900 --> 01:59:07.180
and I wasn't nosy enough to hear whatever the game really

01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:10.000
was that he played a lot of, it's

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:11.700
probably by a company that doesn't really

01:59:11.700 --> 01:59:13.140
exist in the same way anymore.

01:59:13.140 --> 01:59:15.540
For all I know, that man said the correct answer, which

01:59:15.540 --> 01:59:16.880
would be The Guardian legend.

01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:17.380
Just kidding.

01:59:17.380 --> 01:59:18.300
It wasn't in the case.

01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:20.700
I looked.

01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:23.460
And that's from a company that no longer exists,

01:59:23.460 --> 01:59:26.280
but it doesn't negate that they made a great piece of art that

01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:27.420
still holds up.

01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:31.100
So let me get some more comments from chat.

01:59:31.100 --> 01:59:34.480
SSG100Matt says, also, Sega has the most brilliant ad

01:59:34.520 --> 01:59:36.760
campaign in gaming history.

01:59:36.760 --> 01:59:39.080
They spent a lot of money and geared the genesis

01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:42.480
to teens, which went against Nintendo's family model.

01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:44.620
As SSG100Matt continues, I think Sega

01:59:44.620 --> 01:59:46.000
opened the door for a company that

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.720
can take on the big names like Nintendo, Atari, et cetera,

01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:49.800
in their own game.

01:59:49.800 --> 01:59:52.600
They went the distance, and we enjoyed the ride.

01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:55.720
Tigerclaw on chat was talking about my parallels there,

01:59:55.720 --> 01:59:58.840
saying, as much as I like the old movies from my childhood,

01:59:58.840 --> 02:00:00.800
I don't really go back to watching them again,

02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:02.080
because I've already seen them.

02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:04.040
When I see a movie, it's about the first time

02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:05.600
I've seen something new.

02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:07.440
It's hard to go back and watch them again,

02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:08.920
knowing how they begin and end.

02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:11.400
See, that is so not like me, Tigerclaw.

02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:13.400
You guys know I've seen The Rocky Horror Picture

02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:16.620
Show probably 500 times, easily, easily, in a theater,

02:00:16.620 --> 02:00:17.440
nonetheless.

02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:18.400
Not even that.

02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:20.840
A movie like Clue, easily 100 times.

02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:24.080
Showgirls, easily 50 times.

02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:26.040
Those are cult movies, of course,

02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:29.880
that are kind of meant to be watched or rewatched.

02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:33.640
But even sometimes there's like comfort food for movies.

02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:36.520
I was just browsing around Peacock on the Xbox.

02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:37.920
I was like, oh, what'd they put on the service?

02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:39.840
And I was like, Mama Mia.

02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:42.520
And I watched Mama Mia start to finish on Peacock.

02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:43.560
I didn't even need to watch that.

02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:45.560
I have the fucking Blu-ray somewhere,

02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:46.840
but I was just feeling lazy.

02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:47.920
It's literally right in front of me.

02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:50.160
Push A to play, okay.

02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:52.120
Maybe it's in 4K, I don't know.

02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:54.160
And they even fucking put commercials in it,

02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:55.640
but I was like, whatever.

02:00:55.640 --> 02:00:56.680
It's kind of like watching a TV.

02:00:56.680 --> 02:00:58.920
I wasn't like actively watching it.

02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:01.800
I was kind of playing around on my phone,

02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:03.540
kind of like it's on in the background.

02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:06.780
But that movie, as cheesy as it,

02:01:06.780 --> 02:01:10.120
I admit is a cheesy, ridiculous movie,

02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:13.720
but it is so comfort food for me because I love the music.

02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:17.840
I love ABBA, you know, whatever.

02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:20.480
It's just, it's a group I grew up with for a long time.

02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:23.580
So that movie's comfort food for me.

02:01:23.580 --> 02:01:25.660
And I think, again,

02:01:25.660 --> 02:01:28.960
that's what Sega games are gonna be for a lot of people.

02:01:30.860 --> 02:01:32.020
Quest Buster in chat says,

02:01:32.060 --> 02:01:35.780
and thank you Sega for bringing Valkyria Chronicles 4 over

02:01:35.780 --> 02:01:38.220
for taking risks like that for the fans.

02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:39.140
Pod Culture says,

02:01:39.140 --> 02:01:42.540
I've probably seen Serenity about 20 times in the theater.

02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:43.500
DJ Rama S says,

02:01:43.500 --> 02:01:46.060
I feel the same way when I watch anime on Funimation,

02:01:46.060 --> 02:01:47.260
Hulu, and Crunchyroll.

02:01:47.260 --> 02:01:48.740
Yeah, I have the DVD or Blu-ray,

02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:50.020
but dammit it's right there

02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:51.540
and I'm gonna watch and enjoy it.

02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:52.460
Thank you.

02:01:52.460 --> 02:01:53.700
You understand what I mean.

02:01:53.700 --> 02:01:55.860
And someday,

02:01:55.860 --> 02:01:59.780
someday those Sega games are just gonna be in the cloud.

02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:01.660
In fact, many of them already are.

02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:03.460
Push A to start, you know,

02:02:03.460 --> 02:02:05.780
and that's the way it's gonna be.

02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:08.540
So that's my long-winded answer to your question, Fabrice.

02:02:08.540 --> 02:02:11.100
I think Sega, there's always gonna be a place for Sega.

02:02:11.100 --> 02:02:12.940
Sega will always have a corner

02:02:12.940 --> 02:02:15.140
in any video game history museum.

02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:19.420
But as far as do people hold it fondly or what,

02:02:19.420 --> 02:02:22.680
that's just gonna depend on their culture.

02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:25.280
And I'm not talking about like where somebody is,

02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:27.520
I'm talking about what they're surrounded with,

02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:28.920
their family's influence,

02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:31.300
their friends' influence and all of that.

02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:33.140
That's what's gonna really play into

02:02:33.140 --> 02:02:34.420
what somebody kind of thinks of Sega.

02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:35.340
And like you said,

02:02:35.340 --> 02:02:38.340
you don't really think a lot about Atari.

02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:40.060
Realize there's gonna be some people,

02:02:40.060 --> 02:02:42.540
especially now that Sega has been out of the business

02:02:42.540 --> 02:02:45.380
20 years, that means somebody could have been born

02:02:45.380 --> 02:02:48.160
after Sega was out of the business and is now an adult.

02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:49.740
So you're gonna have to get used to the idea

02:02:49.740 --> 02:02:51.220
that there's gonna be some,

02:02:51.220 --> 02:02:54.420
I can't even say kids, adults, young adults now

02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:55.260
who are gonna be like,

02:02:55.260 --> 02:02:56.940
oh, I never really played a Sega game

02:02:56.940 --> 02:02:58.980
cause they weren't really around.

02:02:58.980 --> 02:03:00.460
Or, oh yeah, Sonic.

02:03:00.500 --> 02:03:03.280
Yeah, I remember the Wii game that had him in it.

02:03:04.620 --> 02:03:05.500
You know?

02:03:05.500 --> 02:03:07.240
So it's just gonna be a little different.

02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:08.700
So, all right.

02:03:08.700 --> 02:03:09.740
Anyway, great question.

02:03:09.740 --> 02:03:11.580
You mean that character from Smash Brothers?

02:03:11.580 --> 02:03:12.420
Yeah, right?

02:03:12.420 --> 02:03:13.440
Yeah, so.

02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:18.220
Actually, one more thought, I'm sorry.

02:03:18.220 --> 02:03:20.080
Fabrice, one more thought.

02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:21.820
If you want more people to,

02:03:21.820 --> 02:03:24.300
you have to educate the future.

02:03:24.300 --> 02:03:27.380
You have to educate the children about Sega

02:03:27.380 --> 02:03:28.860
and why you love them so much.

02:03:28.860 --> 02:03:30.900
So, especially in your own family

02:03:30.900 --> 02:03:32.900
and the people around you.

02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:34.540
Even if you don't have kids of your own,

02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:36.500
you probably know somebody with kids

02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:39.540
and you can sure bring over that, you know,

02:03:39.540 --> 02:03:41.040
Sega Dreamcast.

02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:43.240
So, anyway, that's my thought.

02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:46.020
All right.

02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:48.140
That's it for emails.

02:03:48.140 --> 02:03:49.700

02:03:53.580 --> 02:03:57.340
YYR in chat says, oof, that character from Smash Brothers,

02:03:57.340 --> 02:03:59.180
that just makes me sad.

02:03:59.180 --> 02:04:00.680
But you know what?

02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:02.880
As much as it might make you sad,

02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:07.080
somebody is gonna go, what game is this character from?

02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:09.060
I don't, he looks familiar.

02:04:09.060 --> 02:04:09.900
What is this?

02:04:09.900 --> 02:04:11.260
And might actually do some research.

02:04:11.260 --> 02:04:13.060
There's gonna be some people that discover the game

02:04:13.060 --> 02:04:14.660
because of Smash Brothers.

02:04:14.660 --> 02:04:16.460
But I get it, it makes you feel old.

02:04:16.460 --> 02:04:17.840
Believe me, I hear it.

02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:19.260
All right.

02:04:19.260 --> 02:04:22.140
Loki, any last minute stories for our audience tonight?

02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:24.460
While I ask Chad if they have any other comments

02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:25.300
or questions.

02:04:26.180 --> 02:04:29.580
Yeah, so there was some leaks coming out

02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:32.780
about the Sonic 30th anniversary.

02:04:33.700 --> 02:04:38.700
So this is coming from a apparently credible leaker,

02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:41.740
a Nintendo leaker, Zippo.

02:04:41.740 --> 02:04:44.460
And so it's talking about, aside from, you know,

02:04:44.460 --> 02:04:46.460
the voice cast has left Sonic,

02:04:46.460 --> 02:04:49.540
so the voice of Sonic, Roger Craig Smith,

02:04:49.540 --> 02:04:51.180
Sidney Robinson, the voice of Amy,

02:04:51.180 --> 02:04:54.140
and Colleen, oh, I can't even pronounce her last name,

02:04:54.140 --> 02:04:56.980
voice of Tails, all have departed.

02:04:56.980 --> 02:04:59.140
And they're saying that the rest of the current voice cast

02:04:59.140 --> 02:05:01.420
will be following them as well and leaving.

02:05:02.820 --> 02:05:07.820
Apparently the Warren Graff and Ken Pontic

02:05:08.020 --> 02:05:09.940
are no longer writing for the game.

02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:14.860
And they're saying that the 30th anniversary

02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:17.700
will be described as a new era for Sonic,

02:05:17.700 --> 02:05:20.340
that the modern Sonic will focus on the franchise

02:05:20.340 --> 02:05:22.720
going forward, both in 2D and 3D games.

02:05:22.760 --> 02:05:25.840
Apparently Mania was a one-off,

02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:30.240
and fans of the classic era should look to fan games

02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:31.600
for further installments.

02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:34.120
Wow.

02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:38.640
The next 3D game apparently will be, you know,

02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:42.720
full 3D games, you know, 3D spin dashing.

02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:45.840
There's gonna be, you know, multiple playable characters.

02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:48.320
Supposed to be out by holiday,

02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:51.300
assuming it doesn't get delayed.

02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:54.420
And with characters appearing,

02:05:54.420 --> 02:05:58.260
more guest appearances in other games.

02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:01.540
And then-

02:06:01.540 --> 02:06:02.380
I hate to say it,

02:06:02.380 --> 02:06:04.020
but this sounds like a recipe for disaster.

02:06:04.020 --> 02:06:05.880
I mean, prove me wrong, prove me wrong.

02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:07.420
But this whole, like,

02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:09.700
if you wanna remember the classic Sonic games,

02:06:09.700 --> 02:06:10.700
go play fan games.

02:06:10.700 --> 02:06:13.620
I mean, it's great that Sega embraces that, I'm happy.

02:06:13.620 --> 02:06:17.180
But at the same time, it's like, remember Sonic 4?

02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:19.140
Ooh.

02:06:19.140 --> 02:06:20.660
Yeah.

02:06:21.580 --> 02:06:22.420
Apparently though,

02:06:22.420 --> 02:06:27.420
they're also supposed to be working on a 2D game as well.

02:06:27.420 --> 02:06:29.100
Someone's working on one of those.

02:06:29.100 --> 02:06:31.300
So there's a new Sonic collection.

02:06:31.300 --> 02:06:32.860
Remember, they'll be coming out in June.

02:06:32.860 --> 02:06:37.860
It's gonna feature, you know, majority of the classic games.

02:06:40.060 --> 02:06:42.160
Yeah, so I guess we'll have to wait and see

02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:44.100
when any of this stuff gets announced.

02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:46.500
All right.

02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:48.980
That's pretty much it.

02:06:49.020 --> 02:06:49.860
That's it.

02:06:49.860 --> 02:06:50.700
All right.

02:06:50.700 --> 02:06:52.740
Well, I guess we're gonna wrap up then.

02:06:52.740 --> 02:06:54.140
I know it's only just after eight,

02:06:54.140 --> 02:06:57.300
but we don't have Jamie here tonight to get opinions from.

02:06:57.300 --> 02:06:59.500
So, but she'll be back next week.

02:06:59.500 --> 02:07:00.340
Assumable.

02:07:00.340 --> 02:07:01.500
Oh, I was gonna say,

02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:02.980
I don't know if we didn't talk about it,

02:07:02.980 --> 02:07:07.980
but they're so, they have had the like a preview of,

02:07:08.620 --> 02:07:11.380
or I don't know if it's, it's sort of open,

02:07:11.380 --> 02:07:14.020
but the new Super Nintendo World,

02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:16.260
they've have video now of all the rides.

02:07:16.260 --> 02:07:17.100
Yeah.

02:07:17.140 --> 02:07:19.300
Come out and stuff like that.

02:07:19.300 --> 02:07:21.460
What have your thoughts been on that?

02:07:21.460 --> 02:07:26.300
Like is Mario Kart rides kind of a little,

02:07:26.300 --> 02:07:29.180
not what I was hoping it would be.

02:07:29.180 --> 02:07:30.540
It looks fun.

02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:34.860
It looks kind of like a midway mania or something like that,

02:07:34.860 --> 02:07:37.440
but more AR, which is cool.

02:07:38.380 --> 02:07:40.700
But normally when I think of Mario Kart,

02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:44.300
I think of much faster than that.

02:07:44.300 --> 02:07:47.380
And that's not a very fast ride.

02:07:47.380 --> 02:07:51.140
The videos never are as good of an experience

02:07:51.140 --> 02:07:52.320
as the real thing.

02:07:54.740 --> 02:07:59.580
And I wanna see what it looks like out after the pandemic

02:07:59.580 --> 02:08:01.620
and what it looks like in America.

02:08:01.620 --> 02:08:03.520
Not that those things are necessarily gonna suddenly

02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:04.680
make that ride any different,

02:08:04.680 --> 02:08:06.740
but they may be holding back on some effects

02:08:06.740 --> 02:08:09.500
and some things because they don't want the air

02:08:09.500 --> 02:08:11.980
to circulate a certain way or what have you.

02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:15.940
And in Japan, the size of things tends to be

02:08:15.940 --> 02:08:16.780
a little bit smaller

02:08:16.780 --> 02:08:19.500
because they don't have as much space to work with.

02:08:19.500 --> 02:08:21.260
That's what happened with DisneySea, I think,

02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:23.180
is actually a relatively small Disney property

02:08:23.180 --> 02:08:25.060
because they didn't have a lot of space to build with.

02:08:25.060 --> 02:08:27.380
So I'm just a little curious to see what it looks like.

02:08:27.380 --> 02:08:30.400
But I mean, again, I could watch those videos and go,

02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:31.560
I didn't really care for that.

02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:34.260
And I kind of don't know, but I was like,

02:08:34.260 --> 02:08:35.420
I just wanna see it in person.

02:08:35.420 --> 02:08:37.220
I just feel like I'm gonna give it,

02:08:37.220 --> 02:08:40.220
like I could sit here and go, it didn't look fun at all.

02:08:40.260 --> 02:08:42.900
Like hell, I'm not gonna be going there

02:08:42.900 --> 02:08:45.180
in the first couple months after it opens

02:08:45.180 --> 02:08:48.360
to take it all in for myself

02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:51.560
and get a thousand billion selfies for Instagram

02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:52.980
with everything that's there.

02:08:52.980 --> 02:08:55.980
So like, you know, the videos, they're interesting,

02:08:55.980 --> 02:08:58.340
but let's see what it looks like

02:08:58.340 --> 02:09:00.120
when the world's back to normal a little bit

02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:02.380
and what it looks like here in the States.

02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:05.380
That's my thought.

02:09:05.380 --> 02:09:07.580
Orange right in chat says,

02:09:07.580 --> 02:09:09.300
yeah, I was thinking it would be a lot faster,

02:09:09.340 --> 02:09:10.780
but it looks like it's pretty slow.

02:09:10.780 --> 02:09:13.060
Pixelpaca says, even if Disney C is small,

02:09:13.060 --> 02:09:14.020
it's utterly gorgeous.

02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:16.780
Oh yeah, but Disney and all these companies,

02:09:16.780 --> 02:09:18.880
they are very good at playing optical illusions.

02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:23.500
Very good with making your eyes believe certain things

02:09:23.500 --> 02:09:24.900
that may or may not be true.

02:09:24.900 --> 02:09:26.260
And I'll kind of leave it at that.

02:09:26.260 --> 02:09:27.980
But that's part of the Disney magic.

02:09:27.980 --> 02:09:29.620
That's what makes a company like Disney

02:09:29.620 --> 02:09:32.140
and Universal is very good at theme park stuff too.

02:09:32.140 --> 02:09:34.140
That's what makes these companies do well

02:09:34.140 --> 02:09:35.840
in the theme park business is that,

02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:38.940
you know, they know what the F they're doing.

02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:40.300
That's for sure.

02:09:40.300 --> 02:09:42.900
So anything else, Logie?

02:09:42.900 --> 02:09:43.840
No, that's it.

02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:44.680
All right.

02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:47.340
Well, let's get final thoughts then before we wrap it up,

02:09:47.340 --> 02:09:48.660
I do want to say thank you guys so much

02:09:48.660 --> 02:09:50.460
for listening to Orange Launch Radio this week.

02:09:50.460 --> 02:09:52.360
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio,

02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:54.060
please tell a friend or two about the show.

02:09:54.060 --> 02:09:55.820
Help us spread the word because we are the show

02:09:55.820 --> 02:09:57.160
where every gamer has a voice,

02:09:57.160 --> 02:09:59.060
but if the voices aren't here to put out on air,

02:09:59.060 --> 02:10:00.320
then what can we do?

02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:04.860
So please tell a friend a nice five star review

02:10:04.860 --> 02:10:05.940
on a site like iTunes

02:10:05.940 --> 02:10:08.660
or wherever you found this podcast goes a long way.

02:10:09.260 --> 02:10:11.460
Auto hosts, a VOG network on Twitch

02:10:11.460 --> 02:10:12.820
are one of the best things you can do.

02:10:12.820 --> 02:10:15.300
So thank you, thank you to those of you that do that.

02:10:15.300 --> 02:10:16.900
Unfortunately, I don't have a list in front of me,

02:10:16.900 --> 02:10:20.140
but just know if you're doing that, I really appreciate it.

02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:23.020
So those go a long way as well.

02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:24.260
Thank you for being here tonight.

02:10:24.260 --> 02:10:25.740
I know there's a lot of, you know,

02:10:25.740 --> 02:10:27.560
big stuff going on in the world.

02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:29.380
So just appreciate you spending a little extra time

02:10:29.380 --> 02:10:30.220
with us tonight.

02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:31.700
Even if you're on the podcast feed,

02:10:31.700 --> 02:10:33.140
hey, I appreciate you taking the time out

02:10:33.140 --> 02:10:36.380
to listen to the podcast like Fabrice has since 2006.

02:10:36.420 --> 02:10:37.860
Really appreciate that.

02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:41.380
And everybody out there listening, thank you so much.

02:10:41.380 --> 02:10:43.940

02:10:47.700 --> 02:10:49.900

or some VOG network branded merchandise, check it out.

02:10:54.300 --> 02:10:57.020
There's some cute little things on there.

02:10:57.020 --> 02:10:58.260
Check that out.

02:10:58.260 --> 02:10:59.820
So I think that's it.

02:10:59.820 --> 02:11:01.320
Now we can get everybody's final thoughts

02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:02.160
and then we'll be out of here.

02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:03.660
So Loki, I'll start with you.

02:11:03.660 --> 02:11:05.280
You got a big week ahead of you.

02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:07.240
Yeah, just rushing, rushing, rushing,

02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:10.080
trying to get stuff done, so yeah.

02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:15.220
And my final thought is I have some more project ideas

02:11:15.220 --> 02:11:17.360
of my own stewing, but I just have to, you know,

02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:18.540
be able to stick with something.

02:11:18.540 --> 02:11:22.520
And it's been a little crazy in these pandemic times,

02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:25.800
but I'm hoping there'll be more creative stuff real soon.

02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:28.120
So anyway, we will see you in seven days.

02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:31.320
Happy gaming, have a wonderful night everybody

02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:33.540
and stay safe out there.

02:11:33.540 --> 02:11:34.380
We'll see you next week.

02:11:34.380 --> 02:11:35.200
Bye.
