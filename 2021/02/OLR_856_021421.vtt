00:00.000 --> 00:13.280
It feels like the PC gaming world has been having a resurgence of variety.

00:13.280 --> 00:16.340
Games that felt like they would have always been console exclusives are coming or already

00:16.340 --> 00:17.340
on the PC.

00:17.340 --> 00:20.840
I suppose that has to do with the fact that consoles are even more PC like now, similar

00:20.840 --> 00:24.480
CPU, specs and technologies, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB, etc.

00:24.480 --> 00:27.700
No matter the cause, it's a win for gamers to have to buy into fewer silos to play the

00:27.700 --> 00:28.880
games they love.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.560
This is my 33 second commentary.

00:30.560 --> 00:33.800
It's time for the details with your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki starting

00:33.800 --> 00:36.400
right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.400 --> 00:44.720
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:44.720 --> 00:52.700
where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again tonight

00:52.700 --> 00:58.100
on Valentine's Day, February the 14th of 2021.

00:58.100 --> 01:05.040
My name is Rob Roberts, and it's episode number 856 of our show, and not joining us

01:05.040 --> 01:08.820
at the moment, but will be here shortly is Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:08.820 --> 01:13.620
Unfortunately, she had a little, she had a computer crash right before we went live.

01:13.620 --> 01:17.020
And so she's a little frustrated, but she's making her way back.

01:17.020 --> 01:18.860
So she'll be joining us here shortly.

01:18.860 --> 01:22.500
But who we do have here live with us is Techmaster Loki.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.580
Hey, Loki.

01:24.580 --> 01:25.780
And you're muted.

01:25.780 --> 01:28.860
We're having all sorts of errors and problems tonight.

01:28.860 --> 01:29.860
What is going on?

01:29.860 --> 01:33.060
I just wanted to be muted when the intro is going.

01:33.060 --> 01:34.060
It's fine.

01:34.060 --> 01:35.060
It's fine.

01:35.060 --> 01:38.540
I'm editing and voila while I, you know, do the show.

01:38.540 --> 01:39.540
Yeah, right.

01:39.540 --> 01:44.060
Pixel Pacas in chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network,

01:44.060 --> 01:48.980
twitch.tv slash VOG Network, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby

01:48.980 --> 01:53.540
Blackwell show, Pixel Pacas in chat says, amazing start tonight, right?

01:53.540 --> 01:56.140
This is the one I'm going to submit to the award show reel.

01:56.140 --> 01:57.140
That's for sure.

01:57.140 --> 01:58.140
Definitely.

01:58.140 --> 01:59.140
Right.

01:59.140 --> 02:03.980
Anyway, the podcast folks won't realize, but we had like two fault starts on Twitch as

02:03.980 --> 02:08.180
well, just because either I hit the wrong button or I started choking while I was trying

02:08.180 --> 02:09.180
to do the intro.

02:09.180 --> 02:11.060
So it's just, it's just one of those nights.

02:11.060 --> 02:19.660
Well, at least there's some success story this week because Loki, you released a game.

02:19.660 --> 02:24.940
I feel like there should be streamers and balloons and you know, dude, dude, like, yay,

02:24.940 --> 02:25.940
you do.

02:25.940 --> 02:26.940
We are the champions.

02:26.940 --> 02:27.940
Okay.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.620
I don't want to get muted, but you did it.

02:29.620 --> 02:32.380
So yeah, finally, congratulations.

02:32.380 --> 02:33.700
So all right.

02:33.700 --> 02:36.940
So since I know you're going to have to do a lot of promo now to actually sell copies

02:36.940 --> 02:39.820
of your game, let's hear the elevator pitch.

02:39.820 --> 02:41.820
Tell us all about Loki.

02:41.820 --> 02:47.180
Loki's here on my wacky gaming podcast and I want to know you've got this new game, Pixel

02:47.180 --> 02:51.260
Poops, number two, who makes games for Nintendo anymore?

02:51.260 --> 02:53.660
Tell us about Pixel Poops, number two.

02:53.660 --> 03:00.820
Well, it's a puzzle action game that features eating lots of tacos and making large amounts

03:00.820 --> 03:04.060
of poop to trap joggers and other things.

03:04.060 --> 03:09.820
And so it got 40 levels over the course of five different worlds, two player co-op and

03:09.820 --> 03:10.820
great music.

03:10.820 --> 03:11.820
Good.

03:11.820 --> 03:12.820
Well done.

03:12.820 --> 03:13.820
Good.

03:13.820 --> 03:17.340
Tell us where we can play this game.

03:17.340 --> 03:21.300
It's available on itch.io and Steam right now.

03:21.300 --> 03:22.780
So yeah, you can check it out there.

03:22.780 --> 03:24.020
Physical release is coming soon.

03:24.020 --> 03:25.900
I had my cartridge around here somewhere.

03:25.900 --> 03:29.460
I think it's actually in the Nintendo because the kids are playing it, but I'll get that

03:29.460 --> 03:30.460
later.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.900
I had the box art mocked up already.

03:32.900 --> 03:35.540
So oh, the box art's amazing.

03:35.540 --> 03:36.540
It's on your Twitter.

03:36.540 --> 03:37.540
If people...

03:37.540 --> 03:38.540
I saw the mock up of the cartridge.

03:38.540 --> 03:39.540
Yeah.

03:39.540 --> 03:40.540
Yeah, it is.

03:41.260 --> 03:50.780
Actually, right now I'm working on putting together box art for that IGDB page so that

03:50.780 --> 03:52.580
we can put that on Twitch as well.

03:52.580 --> 03:58.540
So I'm working on that right now because apparently my box art is not of the ratio three by four.

03:58.540 --> 04:05.060
So I need to redo it, which is fine because my box originally had this like kind of a

04:05.060 --> 04:10.580
paper texture on it that the guy that made it had put on there, but I just turned that

04:10.580 --> 04:12.780
off and it's much clearer now.

04:12.780 --> 04:15.980
So it'll look nicer when I put it on there.

04:15.980 --> 04:16.980
I also want to make sure...

04:16.980 --> 04:17.980
That'll be done tonight.

04:17.980 --> 04:23.660
I also want to make sure I give a shout out to Yyr without whom Pixel Poops number anything

04:23.660 --> 04:24.660
would be...

04:24.660 --> 04:30.460
If we didn't have him, that wouldn't be possible because he also had basically the main Pixel

04:30.460 --> 04:34.060
Poops game, the one that's playing behind you on stream tonight for those watching live

04:34.060 --> 04:38.840
on Twitch, the Atari 2600 influence version, that is free to play on Steam.

04:38.840 --> 04:43.180
So even if you don't want to spend the money on Loki's version or you don't want to spend

04:43.180 --> 04:48.180
other money on a Commodore 64 version that Yyr also did, you can at least play the base

04:48.180 --> 04:50.060
Atari 2600 game for free.

04:50.060 --> 04:53.140
Although I would encourage you, it's not that expensive.

04:53.140 --> 04:54.140
Throw the extra coin.

04:54.140 --> 04:58.420
I played all three of them this week and I had fun.

04:58.420 --> 04:59.640
They're all different too.

04:59.640 --> 05:03.780
That's the kind of interesting part about it is that the Atari 2600 version is very

05:03.780 --> 05:10.400
Atari 2600, simple kind of game, but has that replayability kind of charm and high score

05:10.400 --> 05:11.620
chase potential.

05:11.620 --> 05:16.980
And then the Commodore 64 is almost more, you have to really think because the joggers

05:16.980 --> 05:20.440
only go left and right, but there's no taco stand.

05:20.440 --> 05:24.420
They drop food that you have to refill your meter with and you kind of have to think through

05:24.420 --> 05:28.780
it carefully because you might not...

05:28.780 --> 05:32.300
There's only certain joggers that actually create the food and you want to make sure

05:32.300 --> 05:35.700
you don't eliminate them from the screen before they make food or yeah.

05:35.700 --> 05:38.420
So you have to do a little more thinking in the Commodore 64 version.

05:38.420 --> 05:43.100
And then yours is very like, it's a lot more like fast paced, like it plays like an NES

05:43.100 --> 05:44.780
game and it's a little bit different.

05:44.780 --> 05:47.100
Well let me ask you that wacky DJ question.

05:47.100 --> 05:51.740
How is your game different from the other two Pixel Poops games?

05:51.740 --> 05:56.340
So it's more of like, I was trying to be a little bit more faster paced.

05:56.340 --> 06:01.340
It is different in the sense that there's a lot more challenges that you may face.

06:01.380 --> 06:05.860
So instead of just joggers walking across the screen and slowly getting faster, there's

06:05.860 --> 06:08.480
kind of twists to each of the different enemies of the game.

06:08.480 --> 06:12.420
So the joggers will walk across the screen, but then if they hit a wall, they'll randomly

06:12.420 --> 06:13.420
turn.

06:13.420 --> 06:20.120
And then also there's ghosts that will, if you make smaller poops and they disappear,

06:20.120 --> 06:22.500
the ghosts do, they will float over them.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.600
And so they won't actually get caught by them.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.880
There's dogs that will eat the smaller poops.

06:27.880 --> 06:32.520
And so they will just chew through the whole thing.

06:32.520 --> 06:37.540
There was, there's a Yeti that runs a little bit faster than the other joggers.

06:37.540 --> 06:42.600
And then there's, there's other like special things towards the last few levels as well

06:42.600 --> 06:47.720
that it gets weird, but it's fun.

06:47.720 --> 06:50.560
I want to ask you a little bit about this because, you know, we've talked about Pixel

06:50.560 --> 06:54.600
Poops at length on this show, and if people aren't going to try it out by this point,

06:54.600 --> 06:57.840
they're just not going to, and that's fine, you know, spend your time how you want.

06:57.840 --> 07:01.360
But I'm kind of curious because this could apply for a lot of games or a lot of people

07:01.360 --> 07:03.360
that are thinking about making a game.

07:03.360 --> 07:07.840
How did it go from, okay, so you made what you used NES Maker or something like that?

07:07.840 --> 07:10.680
You used a tool called that?

07:10.680 --> 07:17.520
So Nest Maker is basically, it's not something, you can make games completely out of that,

07:17.520 --> 07:25.340
but it's more of just a front end for setting up your code and setting up sprites and everything.

07:25.340 --> 07:31.620
So normally if you're making an NES game from scratch, you would have to create your

07:31.620 --> 07:36.300
CHR files or the basically the tile files that you use in the game.

07:36.300 --> 07:40.740
And so this kind of simplifies it where you can set up your animations, you can set up

07:40.740 --> 07:43.060
some sort of scripting and everything.

07:43.060 --> 07:48.220
But when it gets down to it though, that'll just get you the, the bare minimum basics.

07:48.220 --> 07:54.080
Like you could barely cobble together a game with that, the simplest of simple things.

07:54.120 --> 08:00.080
So it just came down to straight up learning how to write assemblers.

08:00.080 --> 08:05.440
So I had to learn how to program an assembly language and being able to rewrite code and

08:05.440 --> 08:08.680
everything to do what I wanted it to do.

08:08.680 --> 08:14.500
So I had to create a random spawn system, which was interesting to try to do that.

08:14.500 --> 08:21.080
I had to rewrite the, right now, like with NES Maker, there's not really two player modules

08:21.080 --> 08:22.240
at all.

08:22.600 --> 08:27.400
There used to be, and it was some basic stuff, but like there isn't anything right now that

08:27.400 --> 08:28.800
supports two players.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.280
So I had to write that from scratch.

08:32.400 --> 08:36.160
And then just like, you know, the animations, everything I had to kind of come up with that,

08:36.160 --> 08:39.720
but it gives you the framework, like to be able to set up, okay, I want this enemy to

08:39.720 --> 08:44.960
have, you know, two frames of animation and I'm going to select the tiles from my tile

08:44.960 --> 08:50.080
set, you know, that are going to go to make up one of the enemies or something.

08:50.080 --> 08:55.240
So it does ease you through that, but basically it just links to different program files and

08:55.240 --> 08:57.520
then you have to like code everything.

08:57.520 --> 08:58.520
So it's not like...

08:58.520 --> 09:03.040
So how do you, I was just going to say, how do you go from that, like, okay, so you coded

09:03.040 --> 09:04.880
everything and you got your game together.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.200
How do you go from that to, I'm selling it on Steam?

09:08.200 --> 09:09.640
That's kind of the part I'm curious about.

09:09.640 --> 09:12.280
Like how did you, how does that part happen?

09:12.280 --> 09:15.600
Like how did you get listed on Steam and all that?

09:15.600 --> 09:18.480
Well thanks to YYR for that.

09:18.480 --> 09:24.160
So basically it's, it's just kind of trying to polish it, put it all together and get

09:24.160 --> 09:25.560
like a complete game.

09:25.560 --> 09:31.320
So this time around, the whole reason why I made an NES game in the first place with

09:31.320 --> 09:37.040
Nest Makers, because I know, I know with the NES, it's very limited on what you can do.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.320
Like artwork, it's very limited to space.

09:40.320 --> 09:47.440
You're limited on what you can do with processing and just in general what you can do with it.

09:47.440 --> 09:52.740
And so I knew because I have a problem with scope creep and I can't possibly like under

09:52.740 --> 09:58.480
scope stuff, that this is the only way that I can do it right now is so something that

09:58.480 --> 10:02.880
actually forced my scope down to the point where I could finish something.

10:02.880 --> 10:07.680
And so that's kind of what it ended up being is, you know, I took that and I had to come

10:07.680 --> 10:11.920
up with, you know, what do I want to do to, what do I want to make in this?

10:11.920 --> 10:14.920
You know, there's a lot of different things I could make.

10:14.920 --> 10:19.840
And so one of the first like kind of tutorials I went through on there, they have like these

10:19.840 --> 10:23.920
different modules you can do and one of them is called this like maze tutorial.

10:23.920 --> 10:30.240
So it's like a kind of collect things and like shoot enemies and stuff, but it's basically

10:30.240 --> 10:35.600
just a one screen game and you can teleport from screen to screen.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.000
So I was like, Oh, okay, that's kind of cool.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.160
I'm like, Hey, you know what?

10:39.160 --> 10:43.800
I bet I can make something like Pixel Poops with this.

10:43.800 --> 10:46.160
And you know, that kind of just, it went from there.

10:46.160 --> 10:49.920
So like that's, I saw that and I was like, okay, I probably could make a game like Pixel

10:49.920 --> 10:50.920
Poops with that.

10:50.920 --> 10:55.480
And then it just fun off into like all these crazy directions.

10:55.480 --> 11:01.120
Like I tried to figure out like a storyline for it, which I never ended up doing.

11:01.120 --> 11:06.200
Like I just got too far into it and I was like, I don't know, you know, it is what it

11:06.200 --> 11:07.200
is.

11:07.200 --> 11:12.400
It's like, I could come up with a storyline for it.

11:12.400 --> 11:17.760
Like, I don't know why they're doing what they're doing, but like, and I was like, well,

11:17.760 --> 11:19.000
why do I have to do that?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.640
Like, you know, you have like games like Pac-Man and stuff like that.

11:21.640 --> 11:27.440
It's like, it's this, it's this thing getting like chased by, you know, it's like there,

11:27.440 --> 11:31.240
there is no story, but the, but the part I'm curious about is like, how did you get it

11:31.240 --> 11:34.800
listed on steam or is that, is that because YYR was already there?

11:34.800 --> 11:38.240
So it was just kind of like you send it to him and he kind of helped you out.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.240
Okay.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.400
So yeah, he, he did the publishing on that and he got it.

11:41.400 --> 11:45.520
I mean, I don't know how they feel about like having NES games on steam.

11:45.520 --> 11:49.400
But since he did like DLC and stuff, so that's how he got it on there.

11:49.400 --> 11:54.040
And then itch, you know, I was able to publish that myself, but like he got it on steam because

11:54.040 --> 11:55.280
he's already on there.

11:55.280 --> 12:00.880
I probably could have gone on steam, but like they have like ways to actually publish a

12:00.880 --> 12:01.880
NES games.

12:01.880 --> 12:05.600
There's a thing called NES tech that it can actually use that it's kind of like its own

12:05.600 --> 12:08.180
built-in emulator.

12:08.180 --> 12:10.040
So I could have done that.

12:10.040 --> 12:13.360
That's how this one game flea has done it.

12:13.360 --> 12:17.240
So they've used that, that software before, but I don't know.

12:17.240 --> 12:21.200
It was just that it was, you know, when I told him about it, he's like, Oh yeah, I'm

12:21.200 --> 12:22.480
working on this version as well.

12:22.480 --> 12:26.480
And so we just kind of decided to work together as far as releasing the games towards the

12:26.480 --> 12:27.480
same time.

12:27.480 --> 12:32.480
And then he helped out a lot on last week with testing as well, because, you know, it

12:32.480 --> 12:38.120
was kind of getting down to the end of the wire there and there was a lot of tests.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.120
Yeah.

12:39.200 --> 12:42.560
So it worked out a matter of time, like lots of balancing, you know, difficulties and everything

12:42.560 --> 12:43.560
like that.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.680
And so he was a great help with that.

12:45.680 --> 12:49.080
Now Bobby Blackwolf and Chad is asking how much is YYR's take?

12:49.080 --> 12:50.080
Now that's none of your business.

12:50.080 --> 12:52.600
That's always, I'm not going to make you answer that because that's nobody's business.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.560
I mean, I don't think he's taking anything.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.820
I mean, he can, I don't care, but yeah.

12:56.820 --> 12:58.740
What a nice guy.

12:58.740 --> 13:01.280
So how much does steam's take?

13:01.280 --> 13:03.760
I think that's a legit, cause that's for everybody's the same.

13:03.760 --> 13:04.760
There's that.

13:04.760 --> 13:05.760
Do they take 30%?

13:05.760 --> 13:06.760
30% I think.

13:06.760 --> 13:07.760
Yeah.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.400
Itch is 10.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.400
So that's not bad.

13:10.400 --> 13:11.400
Yeah.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.400
Okay.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.400
So yeah.

13:13.400 --> 13:14.400
And yes, thank you for reminding me.

13:14.400 --> 13:17.240
We want to make sure it's promoted on itch.io as well, but I kind of, I know itch.io is

13:17.240 --> 13:21.220
way easier to self publish on because it is very much for the indie crowd.

13:21.220 --> 13:25.660
So I kind of like, I'm not as curious about how you do it on that site, but I certainly

13:25.660 --> 13:30.240
don't want to ignore the fact that the game is on itch.io and you get a bigger cut if

13:30.240 --> 13:31.900
they buy it there.

13:31.900 --> 13:34.520
So that is, it is there as well.

13:35.280 --> 13:38.560
At the end of the day, like somewhat like it was ridiculous cause I've been trying to

13:38.560 --> 13:39.560
promote it like crazy.

13:39.560 --> 13:44.240
So I've been trying to like post wherever, like in Reddit and stuff like that.

13:44.240 --> 13:48.000
And there's someone that said, I remember when homebrew used to be free.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.120
I'm like, dude, it's like, then don't buy it.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.120
Like I don't know.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.120
Okay.

13:53.120 --> 13:57.000
So I remember when people used to just do it for fun and not for profit.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.520
I'm like, you think I'm going to make a profit on this?

14:00.520 --> 14:04.440
Well, that that's funny, but like, it's, it's like, honestly, like,

14:04.440 --> 14:08.240
But isn't there an interesting kind of, I don't know if you call it Shez and Freud

14:08.240 --> 14:13.760
or whatever going on here where now you're on the other side of this because, you know,

14:13.760 --> 14:18.120
not that I'm saying you've ever been like anti-developer or whatever, but you do talk

14:18.120 --> 14:22.520
a lot about hacking and modding and like that whole scene and everything.

14:22.520 --> 14:26.480
But now you're on the other side of this, having to bear some of these comments.

14:26.480 --> 14:31.240
So I'm kind of curious, like, has this whole, has reading a comment like that.

14:31.240 --> 14:32.880
And obviously internet comments are trash.

14:32.880 --> 14:33.880
You know that.

14:34.160 --> 14:39.440
Don't read too much into it, but did you, did you, did you think about maybe past things

14:39.440 --> 14:41.200
that you've said in a different light now?

14:41.200 --> 14:44.560
No, cause I've never said something stupid like that.

14:44.560 --> 14:49.760
So you know what I did, all I did was I just, I just took it like, okay, you know, Hey,

14:49.760 --> 14:50.760
that's understandable.

14:50.760 --> 14:54.640
I just joke, like kind of said, yeah, I'm never, I'm not really expecting to make any

14:54.640 --> 14:56.440
money off this and like, well, Hey, you know what?

14:56.440 --> 14:57.440
I get it.

14:57.440 --> 14:58.440
If you don't want to pay for it, that's fine.

14:58.440 --> 15:02.720
I'm like, Hey, I put out a free demo, you know, a few, a couple months ago, if you want

15:02.720 --> 15:04.280
to check that out instead, that's free.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.920
So you can go do that.

15:05.920 --> 15:08.360
And I mean, it seemed kind of positive about that.

15:08.360 --> 15:09.360
Yeah.

15:09.360 --> 15:10.800
Oh, that's right.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.400
You put out a demo as well.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.400
I remember.

15:13.400 --> 15:18.120
So there is a way to play a free version of it and get a sense of the game.

15:18.120 --> 15:22.280
And I do also kind of like that answer is this is kind of like, okay, well then, you

15:22.280 --> 15:23.800
know, don't play.

15:23.800 --> 15:28.800
You know, it's kind of like one of those, like I don't know, but I can't help, but think

15:28.800 --> 15:34.240
of like, when I see these Twitter threads where like artists who do drawings, get people

15:34.240 --> 15:38.720
going into their DMS asking for a sale cut and the artist is like, no.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.200
And you know, the person will be like throwing a fit or whatever.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.960
And the artist is like, okay, then don't do it.

15:43.960 --> 15:47.160
You know, like they're, they're hashtag unbothered.

15:47.160 --> 15:48.160
By that whole thing.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.160
Oh, hi Jamie.

15:49.160 --> 15:50.160
You're here.

15:50.160 --> 15:51.160
Hi.

15:51.160 --> 15:52.160
I'll be right back.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.160
Okay.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.160
You can die of exposure.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.160
What's that?

15:55.160 --> 15:56.160
Say that again.

15:56.520 --> 15:57.960
People, artists die of exposure.

15:57.960 --> 15:58.960
Uh, anyway.

15:58.960 --> 15:59.960
Okay.

15:59.960 --> 16:03.760
Well then while Loki stepped away, let me say hello to dark soccer or Jamie Summers

16:03.760 --> 16:10.720
who made it through the whole crappy tech issues on that end, but you're here.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.480
This computer is ancient.

16:12.480 --> 16:15.400
You're here and this is a day of love and we love you.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.840
We're glad you're back this week.

16:16.840 --> 16:17.840
Can you hear me?

16:17.840 --> 16:18.840
Yeah, I can hear you.

16:18.840 --> 16:19.840
Okay.

16:19.840 --> 16:22.800
Cause I've been saying stuff and there was, you didn't say anything.

16:22.800 --> 16:23.800
Oh, sorry.

16:24.440 --> 16:25.440
Sorry.

16:25.440 --> 16:29.040
I was trying to get a certain thought out, but anyway, um, what, uh, we were talking

16:29.040 --> 16:33.760
before the show about your do tonight, your getup, your, we're wearing a new wig for the

16:33.760 --> 16:34.760
show tonight.

16:34.760 --> 16:35.760
Well, the wig.

16:35.760 --> 16:36.760
Yeah.

16:36.760 --> 16:37.760
But it's the makeup.

16:37.760 --> 16:38.760
That's the important thing.

16:38.760 --> 16:39.760
Yes.

16:39.760 --> 16:40.760
So let's talk about that makeup.

16:40.760 --> 16:46.040
I wish I actually, I should go get it, but, um, I was only able to get two of the pieces,

16:46.040 --> 16:53.920
but, um, ColourPop and Animal Crossing had a, uh, a collaboration.

16:53.920 --> 16:58.080
So today I am wearing the, the Tom Nook eyeshadow collection.

16:58.080 --> 17:04.640
I also have, uh, the, uh, Celeste and Blathers one.

17:04.640 --> 17:10.560
That's the, the more earthy golden reddish tones.

17:10.560 --> 17:16.520
So for those who are watching, I will lean forward and show off my shadow.

17:16.520 --> 17:20.880
So now we're not just indie game development, but we're makeup tutorial blogs.

17:20.880 --> 17:24.280
So we've, we're covering all the bases here on our website.

17:24.280 --> 17:29.320
Actually your, your face looks great, which is a weird compliment, but I'm sorry.

17:29.320 --> 17:30.320
It's true.

17:30.320 --> 17:31.320
Your face looks great.

17:31.320 --> 17:38.560
Well, I kind of did a little bit of that half daytime drag look, you know, I, I, I contorted

17:38.800 --> 17:41.880
I busted out some of my sister makeup, actually, it was kind of funny.

17:41.880 --> 17:46.440
Um, but because I don't have any lipstick that matches, I actually found an eyeshadow,

17:46.440 --> 17:52.520
an eyeliner that was the Pantone color from like four years ago that actually goes quite

17:52.520 --> 17:57.720
well with the rest of the, it's like the Pantone Emerald that, uh, Sephora had a few years

17:57.720 --> 18:03.840
ago and it fits very well with the rest of the, uh, the, um, Animal Crossing colors.

18:03.840 --> 18:08.080
But, um, I, yeah, I, they were way sold out by the time I got to it.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.320
But I, those were the two palettes that I wanted.

18:10.320 --> 18:16.960
Um, there's another like Isabelle one and they have like some, you know, some other

18:16.960 --> 18:22.200
like a lip pencils or something, but really what I wanted was, were these two eyeshadows

18:22.200 --> 18:27.600
cause I wanted the nice greens and I wanted the earth tones and they're supposed to have

18:27.600 --> 18:30.840
them out, I think again on the 17th.

18:30.840 --> 18:34.600
So in two days, three days from today.

18:34.600 --> 18:39.560
Um, but I mean, it was, I don't know.

18:39.560 --> 18:42.120
I'm usually not one like for collabs like that.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.120
I'm like, Oh, okay.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.120
Hello Kitty.

18:44.120 --> 18:45.120
Kind of cute.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.520
I did get the Hello Kitty sugar pill one.

18:46.520 --> 18:47.520
Nope.

18:47.520 --> 18:48.520
Not sugar pill.

18:48.520 --> 18:49.840
Was it, was it sugar pill?

18:49.840 --> 18:51.400
It was the little twin stars one.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.760
I think it was sugar pill cause I got it at a drag con.

18:53.760 --> 18:57.760
You can, there's always that thing though where you're like, not you specifically, but

18:57.760 --> 19:01.060
we as people are always like, I'm not really into that.

19:01.060 --> 19:05.800
But then that certain like team up happens and you're like, Ugh, I might have to get

19:05.800 --> 19:06.860
into this.

19:06.860 --> 19:09.820
Like big example, Fortnite and Tron.

19:09.820 --> 19:11.300
That was news this week.

19:11.300 --> 19:13.020
So I don't like Fortnite really.

19:13.020 --> 19:16.660
Um, but now it's got a Tron thing and I'm like, Ugh, I guess I'm going to have to try

19:16.660 --> 19:17.660
it again.

19:17.660 --> 19:18.660
Oh yeah.

19:18.660 --> 19:24.140
I, I saw that, but I mean, it's just like, I, and normally I'll, I'll even put it this

19:24.140 --> 19:25.140
way.

19:25.140 --> 19:30.140
I haven't in the past been happy with ColourPop's eyeshadows.

19:30.180 --> 19:33.980
But since these pallets are just really, they're, they're kind of even tiny.

19:33.980 --> 19:37.020
I figured they wouldn't dry out by the time I've used them up.

19:37.020 --> 19:40.260
Um, cause that's kind of what happens with some of their stuff is that they dry up a

19:40.260 --> 19:42.140
little bit and lose pigment.

19:42.140 --> 19:46.140
Um, but, uh, but I really actually like these.

19:46.140 --> 19:47.140
The pigmenting is good.

19:47.140 --> 19:51.820
I mean, I do have to work it a little harder cause I mean, like I said, ColourPop's eyeshadows

19:51.820 --> 19:56.020
are really not the best, but I do really enjoy the colors.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.500
I was able to blend it nicely.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.260
The glitters actually stay in place.

19:59.260 --> 20:03.940
So, um, it's, it's, it's not very expensive either.

20:03.940 --> 20:08.380
ColourPop has, um, uh, kind of a reputation for some of their stuff not being too expensive.

20:08.380 --> 20:13.100
So these little four color, um, pallets are like 12 bucks a pop, I think.

20:13.100 --> 20:14.100
Hmm.

20:14.100 --> 20:15.100
Nice.

20:15.100 --> 20:18.620
I'll have to check your website again, but, um, I'll, I'll find it and link it in chat.

20:18.620 --> 20:21.660
But if you just go to ColourPop and look up their Animal Crossing collab, it's like one

20:21.660 --> 20:23.020
of the first things on there.

20:23.020 --> 20:25.000
So, and it's color with a U.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
ColourPop.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
ColourPop.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Very Canadian or British.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.880
Well, I, I love it.

20:30.880 --> 20:34.400
So dark soccer really worked hard on her hair and makeup tonight.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.240
Logie worked hard releasing a game on steam this week.

20:37.240 --> 20:39.680
I shook this wig out of the bag really nicely.

20:39.680 --> 20:42.800
I'm wearing pajama bottoms tonight.

20:42.800 --> 20:43.800
So am I.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.800
Which you can't see on TV.

20:45.800 --> 20:50.760
So I just ruined the illusion because for all you know, I'm wearing normal bottoms,

20:50.760 --> 20:52.800
but tonight I'm lazy.

20:53.600 --> 20:57.320
Well, I put on a bra for y'all.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.360
I will, I will tell you, thank you.

20:59.360 --> 21:04.120
I will tell you this from, uh, the, the short time I was interning at the, the nightly news,

21:04.120 --> 21:09.400
uh, at one of our local stations is that most of the anchors you see on TV, they are wearing

21:09.400 --> 21:10.400
pants.

21:10.400 --> 21:13.760
That's not the gag, but many of them are not wearing like suit pants.

21:13.760 --> 21:16.920
A lot of them wear jeans underneath, like there'll be really dressed.

21:16.920 --> 21:19.320
You know how like news anchors always like suit and tie.

21:19.360 --> 21:23.720
They're almost all wearing jeans underneath, unless it's like a lady who's wearing a dress

21:23.720 --> 21:28.360
and you know, you can't really, you know, there's no other bot, but, um, if chances

21:28.360 --> 21:33.520
are if they can wear some type of comfortable bottom, they are so, and that's, that's probably

21:33.520 --> 21:35.840
true of a lot of things you see on Twitch.

21:35.840 --> 21:36.840
I see.

21:36.840 --> 21:41.640
I'm, I'm kind of annoyed that guys don't wear kilts and skirt long skirts more often.

21:41.640 --> 21:45.640
Cause that seems to me like it would be a lot more comfortable on, you know, the crotch

21:45.640 --> 21:46.640
region.

21:46.640 --> 21:51.080
Well, buy me one for my birthday and I will.

21:51.080 --> 21:55.320
I wasn't meaning you in particular, I was just meaning a bunch of dudes.

21:55.320 --> 22:01.200
I think, and, uh, some folks in chat saying, uh, Bobby Blackwell saying, I'm always wearing

22:01.200 --> 22:02.960
sweat pants in the winter time.

22:02.960 --> 22:08.240
Uh, and fifth dream says at least you guys are wearing pants, why I can't afford a Twitch

22:08.240 --> 22:09.240
screw up.

22:09.240 --> 22:13.600
So I have to make sure, you know, we're, we're all covered in that aspect.

22:13.600 --> 22:20.320
But, um, I really think my pajama top to one of my sports bras in a nicer tank top.

22:20.320 --> 22:27.200
I think in this zoom culture that we're in now, I think a lot of like, I think that whole,

22:27.200 --> 22:30.960
you know, thing I kind of told you about most people don't wear pants on TV or they're wearing

22:30.960 --> 22:31.960
jeans.

22:31.960 --> 22:36.260
Um, like people that might've shocked people a couple of years ago, but now that zoom culture

22:36.260 --> 22:38.680
is like such a thing, I think we all do it.

22:38.680 --> 22:43.720
I think we've all done that work or even school call where we're wearing pajama bottoms, you

22:43.720 --> 22:49.320
know, or, you know, gym shorts is another one for me, onesie to work meetings and they

22:49.320 --> 22:54.120
don't care cause no one sees us, but you know, but my boss laughs at it.

22:54.120 --> 22:56.960
He thinks it's hilarious that I wear a red Panda onesie.

22:56.960 --> 23:02.840
Um, I mean, I was actually reading, um, you know, cause I would just like to look at,

23:02.840 --> 23:07.080
I read Forbes and I read a few, you know, of the financial things and they, um, I think

23:07.080 --> 23:10.880
it was Forbes that had, uh, a fashion industry report.

23:10.880 --> 23:19.680
It talks about the declining sales of a high heels and, um, and the change in women's professional

23:19.680 --> 23:20.680
wear.

23:20.680 --> 23:21.680
Interesting.

23:21.680 --> 23:30.520
They're going more toward, uh, casual classy, I guess casual classy was, I thought what

23:30.520 --> 23:37.040
the term that they used was, um, but just something, something more, you know,

23:37.040 --> 23:41.320
comfortable, something that's easier for staying in the house, you know, nice looking,

23:41.320 --> 23:47.820
but not slouchy, not like pajamas, but comfortable like that, like, uh, investing in more linens

23:47.820 --> 23:54.280
and softer materials and wide legs and no heels because heels are the devil.

23:54.280 --> 23:59.040
Um, I want to get into the kickoff topic here in a moment, but I do want to, uh, address

23:59.040 --> 24:03.400
a kind of going back to pixel poops for a minute, uh, Loki Bobby Blackwolf in chat over

24:03.400 --> 24:08.320
twitch.tv slash vog network says, by the way, I will say that I just put my money where

24:08.320 --> 24:13.920
my mouth was and double dipped on pixel poops number two to support Loki since I gave him

24:13.920 --> 24:15.840
so much shit for years.

24:15.840 --> 24:16.920
So I appreciate it.

24:16.920 --> 24:17.920
There you go.

24:17.920 --> 24:20.320
I bought a copy for Gwen and myself.

24:20.320 --> 24:21.320
Nice.

24:21.320 --> 24:22.320
Yeah.

24:22.320 --> 24:23.680
I might, I might give some copies too.

24:23.680 --> 24:24.680
We'll see.

24:24.680 --> 24:27.920
So Loki, I hope you make a little bit of coin off of it.

24:27.920 --> 24:33.240
Obviously it's none of our business, but I would be curious if you do end up selling,

24:33.240 --> 24:40.040
you know, enough to, I don't know, like just pay the mortgage for one month maybe.

24:40.040 --> 24:41.040
We'll see.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.040
I don't know.

24:42.040 --> 24:43.040
I'd be, I'd be curious.

24:43.040 --> 24:44.040
I'm going to use to hold my breath.

24:44.040 --> 24:45.040
Yeah, that's fair.

24:45.040 --> 24:46.040
That's fair.

24:46.040 --> 24:49.120
I mean, I don't know what, I don't know what it's selling on steam, but on itch, I'm not

24:49.120 --> 24:50.560
holding my breath.

24:50.560 --> 24:51.560
That's fine.

24:51.560 --> 24:52.560
That's fine.

24:52.560 --> 24:53.560
I owe you a pizza.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.160
Oh, that's right.

24:55.160 --> 24:59.080
The monumental challenge has come to a conclusion.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.400
I'll tell you what, I'll make it from scratch.

25:02.400 --> 25:04.520
I have a pizza oven now.

25:04.520 --> 25:05.520
I'll make it calzone.

25:05.520 --> 25:06.520
Yes.

25:06.520 --> 25:08.360
Look, Loki has won a pizza.

25:08.360 --> 25:10.320
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

25:10.320 --> 25:13.400
You win because you made a game.

25:13.400 --> 25:14.400
I promised.

25:14.400 --> 25:15.400
That's right.

25:15.400 --> 25:16.400
I forgot about that bet.

25:16.400 --> 25:17.400
That was like a year ago.

25:17.400 --> 25:18.400
I love it.

25:18.400 --> 25:21.400
Maybe I'll just deliver it, have it delivered and then I'll, I'll make pizzas when we can

25:21.400 --> 25:22.400
all get together again.

25:22.400 --> 25:23.400
There you go.

25:23.400 --> 25:24.400
I like that.

25:24.400 --> 25:25.400
Okay.

25:25.400 --> 25:29.080
That's even better if I get pizza because Loki made a game, that's the best and I'll,

25:29.080 --> 25:32.000
I'll continue to wear sweatpants.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.040
You're getting something else tomorrow, Rob.

25:34.040 --> 25:35.040
Oh, okay.

25:35.040 --> 25:39.480
Remember, I'm baking and I'm stealing your ring fit.

25:39.480 --> 25:44.360
All right, let's get into, we were like 30 minutes in and we have yet to talk about the

25:44.360 --> 25:45.360
news.

25:45.360 --> 25:46.360
We got to get into our kickoff topic tonight.

25:46.360 --> 25:47.360
Hey, I just got here.

25:47.360 --> 25:48.360
That's fine.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.160
The show doesn't start until I get here.

25:50.160 --> 25:54.380
We had like three false starts tonight, so I swear we did everything possible to delay

25:54.380 --> 25:56.800
the start tonight, but oh well.

25:56.800 --> 25:57.800
Okay.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.440
Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.

25:59.440 --> 26:03.760
We have some conventions that are making a digital transition.

26:03.760 --> 26:06.280
One of them is coming up this weekend.

26:06.280 --> 26:12.640
This is a convention that's usually in the fall and that's Blizzcon, excuse me, I actually

26:12.640 --> 26:14.200
went to Blizzcon one fall.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.200
Oh, golly.

26:15.200 --> 26:18.440
It was probably like a good five years ago at this point, but I'm, I had a lot of fun

26:18.440 --> 26:24.480
when I went, obviously they didn't have the event in person in the fall because you know,

26:24.480 --> 26:28.120
it's not going to let them do that, but they didn't even really have a virtual event at

26:28.120 --> 26:29.120
that point.

26:29.120 --> 26:32.920
So what happened is that they kind of took a little time to get together the virtual

26:32.920 --> 26:39.020
event that they wanted and Blizzcon 2021 is going to be happening online later this week.

26:39.020 --> 26:43.800
So the schedule has gone up and they're going to be running multiple channels basically

26:43.800 --> 26:45.480
over on Twitch.

26:45.480 --> 26:48.780
They're not going to run all day long, but a good chunk of the day.

26:48.780 --> 26:53.140
It's going to kick off on Friday at 5 PM Eastern, that would be 2 PM Pacific.

26:53.140 --> 26:56.580
And that's going to be basically their keynote type of presentation, where they're going

26:56.580 --> 27:01.460
to tell us all the latest and greatest what's going on with Blizzard games.

27:01.460 --> 27:05.860
Co-streaming is allowed and I would have loved to have done a co-stream, but unfortunately

27:05.860 --> 27:10.740
that time during the day, I'm still working, I'm not going to be able to make that work.

27:10.740 --> 27:15.300
But I'm sure many folks will be watching at 2 PM Pacific, 5 PM Eastern, and we're going

27:15.300 --> 27:19.880
to get updates on Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2, although we know neither of those games are

27:19.880 --> 27:22.300
releasing this year.

27:22.300 --> 27:23.780
Maybe there will be some surprises.

27:23.780 --> 27:28.500
I would imagine we're getting a lot closer to that Diablo mobile phone game launching,

27:28.500 --> 27:32.460
although I'm sure Blizzard is going to be very cautious at how much time and focus they

27:32.460 --> 27:37.020
give that game after what happened to them a couple Blizzcons ago.

27:37.020 --> 27:41.820
If the rumors are true about a Diablo 2 remaster, I think a lot of people are going to be happy

27:41.820 --> 27:43.260
about that.

27:43.260 --> 27:50.260
And this might be a real kind of pie in the sky kind of idea, but Blizzard has kind of

27:50.260 --> 27:54.780
been hinting that they might be working on some new things and new IPs.

27:54.780 --> 28:00.100
I don't want to set the bar too high, but maybe, especially because they're doing this

28:00.100 --> 28:05.280
whole virtual convention at this time, maybe we're going to hear about something new.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.840
And that would be very exciting, I think.

28:07.840 --> 28:09.180
So we'll see.

28:09.180 --> 28:15.220
Otherwise we're going to see some other, they're kind of doing like one kind of, excuse me,

28:15.820 --> 28:21.100
they're going to do like one game kind of focused on each channel that they're running

28:21.100 --> 28:25.740
through the weekend, or Friday and Saturday really, just they're not doing Sunday programming.

28:25.740 --> 28:30.080
So they'll give updates on all sorts of things and you know what's going to be coming to

28:30.080 --> 28:32.100
a Warcraft patch and things like that.

28:32.100 --> 28:35.380
I doubt they'll announce an expansion, but you never know.

28:35.380 --> 28:40.740
So we will bring you all the updates we hear about on next Sunday's show.

28:40.740 --> 28:44.340
I'm curious if any of you guys out there in chat are going to be checking this out this

28:44.340 --> 28:45.340
weekend.

28:45.340 --> 28:49.220
The nice thing about it being all virtual is that it's going to be free.

28:49.220 --> 28:54.380
So that's going to be easy.

28:54.380 --> 28:57.940
Any of you guys interested in watching the virtual BlizzCon at all?

28:57.940 --> 28:58.940
No.

28:58.940 --> 29:01.340
And that's fair to me.

29:01.340 --> 29:05.180
I'm really interested in a lot of the Blizzard products.

29:05.180 --> 29:11.740
I mean, I'm curious to see what Overwatch 2 does, but I don't know.

29:11.740 --> 29:16.060
I quit playing WoW and that was really all I played, you know?

29:16.060 --> 29:24.280
So I don't know, I mean, they just really haven't been doing many interesting things

29:24.280 --> 29:25.280
to me.

29:25.280 --> 29:28.560
So I haven't really felt like paying attention to them.

29:28.560 --> 29:33.340
They haven't really done a lot in the past couple of years, to be honest.

29:33.340 --> 29:38.340
They did release that Warcraft 3 remaster, which didn't go over that well.

29:38.340 --> 29:41.700
They released Warcraft Classic, or World of Warcraft Classic, which went over a little

29:41.700 --> 29:42.700
bit better.

29:42.700 --> 29:43.700
I think there's some people that are into that.

29:43.700 --> 29:45.980
I played it for a hot minute, it was cool.

29:45.980 --> 29:49.620
And then I know some people that love the Warcraft expansion, I know some people that

29:49.620 --> 29:51.220
don't love the Warcraft expansion.

29:51.220 --> 29:54.540
So just kind of, you know, it's a matter of taste at that point.

29:54.540 --> 30:00.140
I'm curious enough though about, I think especially when it comes to like Overwatch 2, I'm kind

30:00.140 --> 30:04.200
of curious if we're going to get a look at the game that maybe distances it a little

30:04.200 --> 30:05.880
more from Overwatch 1.

30:05.880 --> 30:09.280
I'm kind of curious, even though I know they didn't want to dilute things too much when

30:09.280 --> 30:13.380
it comes to Overwatch League, I'm kind of curious what other kind of change, I'm kind

30:13.380 --> 30:20.640
of curious why Overwatch 2 is taking so long, if it's just like an Overwatch 1 plus kind

30:20.640 --> 30:21.640
of thing.

30:21.640 --> 30:26.400
So I really want to see like, what is that plus that really takes us further.

30:26.400 --> 30:29.900
And I imagine that's going to be, you know, things that play into PlayStation 5 and Xbox

30:29.900 --> 30:32.160
Series X and all that stuff.

30:32.160 --> 30:34.160
So I'll be curious.

30:35.160 --> 30:39.860
SSG100Matt says, I hope they take some steps to resort their image.

30:39.860 --> 30:43.120
I think maybe like rehab their images is what he means there.

30:43.120 --> 30:46.760
Because you know, they've had a rough couple of years ever since Mike Morheim left.

30:46.760 --> 30:51.480
So it'll be interesting to see what happens with that.

30:51.480 --> 30:56.680
Let's talk about another convention that was confirmed going digital this week.

30:56.680 --> 30:59.480
Loki, do you want to talk about this one?

30:59.480 --> 31:00.480
You want me to talk about it?

31:00.480 --> 31:01.480
Sure.

31:01.800 --> 31:07.240
So E3, because E3 is just not knowing what E3 is going to be anymore, I think so.

31:07.240 --> 31:10.280
The ESA says that they're transforming the gaming showcase.

31:10.280 --> 31:13.880
It sounds like though, it's going to be kind of similar to what it was last year.

31:13.880 --> 31:17.840
Actually, did they really, is it even considered E3 last year?

31:17.840 --> 31:22.280
I don't know what the Jeff Keighley thing was, but I guess it was the IGM thing they

31:22.280 --> 31:23.280
did last year.

31:23.280 --> 31:26.140
Yeah, there really wasn't an E3 last year.

31:26.140 --> 31:29.200
There was just kind of like substitute teach 3.

31:29.200 --> 31:32.400
Yeah, the Summer Games Fest thing.

31:32.400 --> 31:40.160
So basically, they said that right now that they're looking at doing some broadcast events,

31:40.160 --> 31:44.720
it sounds like kind of similar what they did with the Summer Games Fest last year.

31:44.720 --> 31:49.100
And I don't even know if necessarily, I think that's probably still happening.

31:49.100 --> 31:57.320
So no word exactly, nothing set in stone of what it is exactly going to be.

31:57.320 --> 32:02.280
But right now that they are changing what they're doing, obviously, I mean, COVID and

32:02.280 --> 32:05.520
the fact that I don't think anything's going to be opened up, they're not going to want

32:05.520 --> 32:09.060
to have large events like that, you know, even come June.

32:09.060 --> 32:11.940
So they'll still be vaccinating people in June.

32:11.940 --> 32:17.360
So we'll be getting closer, hopefully, like, you know, maybe like, like in California,

32:17.360 --> 32:21.080
we have that tier system with closure, we might be getting closer to like yellow tier

32:21.080 --> 32:24.000
type of stuff, because more people are getting vaccinated.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.880
But these huge shows that draw thousands of people, those are gonna be the last things

32:27.880 --> 32:28.940
to come back.

32:28.940 --> 32:33.480
We'll be lucky if there's a dragon con this year, I'm still holding out hope, though,

32:33.480 --> 32:37.120
you know, especially for people who have been vaccinated, at least, but we'll see.

32:37.120 --> 32:39.580
I mean, we just don't know.

32:39.580 --> 32:45.000
Their plan is to hold multiple two hour keynote sessions from games partners and award show

32:45.000 --> 32:47.240
a preview night on June 14.

32:47.240 --> 32:52.360
And smaller streams of various games publishers, influencers and media partners.

32:52.400 --> 32:55.680
So basically, what they did last year for summer's game, Summer Games Fest, they're

32:55.680 --> 32:58.040
like, okay, I'm gonna copy exactly that.

32:58.040 --> 33:03.560
So whatever, as long as I get my information, I don't care who it comes from.

33:03.560 --> 33:07.640
You just want the information.

33:07.640 --> 33:08.640
You don't care.

33:08.640 --> 33:09.640
I just don't care.

33:09.640 --> 33:13.220
I don't care if he's putting on the event, I don't care if IGN is putting on the event

33:13.220 --> 33:19.200
or if it's Jeff Keeley or, or whoever, you know, I just want to see the information.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.200
That's it.

33:20.360 --> 33:21.360
I don't care.

33:23.360 --> 33:24.360
All right.

33:24.360 --> 33:25.360
Yeah.

33:25.360 --> 33:26.360
Um, how do you feel?

33:26.360 --> 33:29.840
Well, so I was gonna ask, how do you feel about E3 going virtual?

33:29.840 --> 33:32.040
But I guess you kind of answered it.

33:32.040 --> 33:37.000
And I got to admit, I'm kind of with you on that is it's more like, you know, honestly,

33:37.000 --> 33:43.600
like what if what has been one of my biggest criticisms, excuse me, I'm coughing choking

33:43.600 --> 33:44.600
tonight.

33:44.600 --> 33:48.200
Um, what has been one of my biggest criticisms about E3?

33:48.200 --> 33:53.840
The last time I actually went was that everything I was experiencing in person, I could just

33:53.840 --> 33:55.320
go get online.

33:55.320 --> 34:00.200
You know, I was waiting in line to see things that I would just end up watching on YouTube.

34:00.200 --> 34:05.280
And there was a lot less stuff to really get your hands on and play and a lot more where

34:05.280 --> 34:11.080
it was like, here is a rendered conception thing or here is a somebody else is going

34:11.080 --> 34:14.280
to play through it and you can watch type of video and it's all the stuff that was just

34:14.280 --> 34:16.840
on YouTube and whatever else.

34:17.480 --> 34:21.160
So in a way, I'm kind of like a digital transition.

34:21.160 --> 34:26.560
For me and for a lot of us, isn't that just what E3 was anyway?

34:26.560 --> 34:30.520
The only people this really affects are the people that were going in person.

34:30.520 --> 34:36.080
And as someone who used to go in person, I kind of started to prefer the digital version.

34:36.080 --> 34:37.080
So maybe...

34:37.080 --> 34:38.080
Exactly.

34:38.080 --> 34:43.240
It's like, I don't know, it's not a big deal that whatever they're doing, I just think

34:43.240 --> 34:47.480
we'll see what it comes, what they actually do, if it's anything unique.

34:47.480 --> 34:48.480
Yeah.

34:48.480 --> 34:51.280
Dr. Sakra, I'm curious about your thoughts on E3.

34:51.280 --> 34:52.680
You've gone to E3 before.

34:52.680 --> 34:53.840
What do you think about the whole digital?

34:53.840 --> 34:57.040
I mean, not the part about the decision to go digital.

34:57.040 --> 35:00.920
We all know why they're doing it, but how do you think digital is going to compare to

35:00.920 --> 35:01.920
being in person?

35:01.920 --> 35:06.680
I think people are going to make it work one way or another.

35:06.680 --> 35:16.380
You know, honestly enough, I really like a digital option, even if there wasn't a big

35:16.380 --> 35:22.320
thing going on right now, a pandemic, because it gives people who can't easily get out there

35:22.320 --> 35:25.160
a chance to attend.

35:25.160 --> 35:30.560
So I think that what they would lack for the in-person, they would make up for in other

35:30.560 --> 35:32.360
virtual attendees.

35:32.360 --> 35:39.120
You know, you bring up a great idea on how E3 can kind of be a big deal again.

35:39.120 --> 35:42.200
You know, E3's lost a lot of, even before the pandemic.

35:42.200 --> 35:46.360
I think a lot of us had kind of had it with a lot of the ESA decisions, weren't thrilled

35:46.360 --> 35:48.400
with the direction ESA is going.

35:48.400 --> 35:55.240
But this idea of maybe even once the pandemic is over, that there's maybe like a digital

35:55.240 --> 35:58.480
access kind of E3.

35:58.640 --> 36:03.200
I think this is a thing post-pandemic, a lot of like conventions and big things are going

36:03.200 --> 36:04.200
to be thinking of.

36:04.200 --> 36:05.200
Go ahead.

36:05.200 --> 36:08.160
So I need to point out one thing actually.

36:08.160 --> 36:15.520
It has actually been released just like within recent weeks that this disease is going nowhere.

36:15.520 --> 36:20.080
And they're even saying that there will be seasonal mutations that are going to be going

36:20.080 --> 36:24.960
on for pretty much the rest of forever.

36:24.960 --> 36:27.440
So the pandemic is going nowhere.

36:27.920 --> 36:30.560
Well, it may turn endemic, but yes.

36:30.560 --> 36:31.560
Exactly.

36:31.560 --> 36:32.560
Yeah.

36:32.560 --> 36:41.600
But I'm saying that I think people need to start putting more investment into virtual

36:41.600 --> 36:42.600
gatherings instead.

36:42.600 --> 36:43.600
Right.

36:43.600 --> 36:50.960
Because I think that, I think it's way too premature to think that this year it's going

36:50.960 --> 36:52.960
to be over.

36:52.960 --> 36:53.960
Yeah.

36:54.360 --> 36:59.080
Well, I mean, this starts to delve into another issue because I really do see like what's

36:59.080 --> 37:02.760
going to happen is that even and you're already seeing it happening.

37:02.760 --> 37:08.520
Even if the disease is not gone, people have hit their limit with it and they're just going

37:08.520 --> 37:12.640
to act like everything's OK, whether that's a good idea or a bad idea.

37:12.640 --> 37:15.800
It doesn't matter because, again, it's people's perception that really dictates what's going

37:15.800 --> 37:17.840
to happen.

37:17.840 --> 37:24.880
And I think even if we're looking at an endemic type of COVID in 2022, there's going to be

37:24.880 --> 37:28.040
a push to have all these cons in person again, because there's going to be a lot of people

37:28.040 --> 37:30.280
that are just like, I've had it.

37:30.280 --> 37:32.720
I'm not like I'm not able to live my life.

37:32.720 --> 37:34.280
So people are idiots.

37:34.280 --> 37:35.400
I'm going to say it right now.

37:35.400 --> 37:37.880
Those people are stupid.

37:37.880 --> 37:42.280
Selfish and stupid.

37:42.280 --> 37:45.160
I think you know a lot of people like that.

37:45.160 --> 37:47.040
I think we all do.

37:47.040 --> 37:48.040
I do.

37:48.040 --> 37:49.620
And I told them to their face.

37:49.620 --> 37:55.160
So the but the reality is it's so what I'm saying is that they're still going to be these

37:55.160 --> 37:57.680
types of conventions and things that happen.

37:57.680 --> 38:00.700
So whether there's a pandemic endemic or not.

38:00.700 --> 38:07.880
So I think a virtual option is something that kind of has to be there after, you know, it

38:07.880 --> 38:13.240
goes endemic, I guess we'll say, because there are still going to be plenty of people.

38:13.240 --> 38:15.400
I think you're going to see there's going to be people that are comfortable doing that

38:15.400 --> 38:16.400
type of stuff.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.840
There's going to be people that are not comfortable doing that type of stuff.

38:18.840 --> 38:23.360
And I think the virtual option is the only way you're going to cater to a crowd that

38:23.360 --> 38:28.680
doesn't necessarily feel comfortable attending in-person events for a long time.

38:28.680 --> 38:29.680
That makes sense.

38:29.680 --> 38:34.320
The only people who are going to be safe at any of these are going to be the vaccinated.

38:34.320 --> 38:35.320
Yeah.

38:35.320 --> 38:45.480
So, you know, I, I do not feel like I would feel like I would be completely irresponsible

38:45.480 --> 38:51.480
if I went out and put somebody else at risk.

38:51.480 --> 38:56.520
So maybe I'm not, okay, so stupid is not the best word for it, but I'm going to say irresponsible

38:56.520 --> 38:57.960
and I'm going to die on that mountain.

38:57.960 --> 39:00.000
I think it's irresponsible.

39:00.000 --> 39:05.120
I'm waiting to see what the CDC has to say after the vaccine rolls out more and all this

39:05.120 --> 39:06.120
stuff.

39:06.120 --> 39:11.560
You know, I think, I think it's just too early to predict either way, but we'll see.

39:11.560 --> 39:15.000
I'm choosing to believe in science and the science right now tells me that gatherings

39:15.000 --> 39:16.480
are still irresponsible.

39:16.480 --> 39:17.480
Right.

39:17.480 --> 39:21.720
Now, but we don't know what it's going to look like in six to nine months.

39:21.720 --> 39:27.200
So, but I think, again, I think some people's perception of big gatherings is going to be

39:27.200 --> 39:30.800
kind of like permanently kind of changed.

39:30.800 --> 39:34.260
So a virtual option like what's happening with E3.

39:34.260 --> 39:43.480
And I think just to keep E3 something that, you know, is of the importance that it is,

39:43.480 --> 39:46.240
you know, E3 has always kind of been that, oh, it's gamer Christmas and all that.

39:46.240 --> 39:49.640
I think like a virtual option is a good way to kind of keep that relevancy.

39:49.640 --> 39:50.640
There's the word I'm looking for.

39:50.640 --> 39:52.500
I think it's a good way for them to do that.

39:52.500 --> 39:56.640
So anyway, all right.

39:56.640 --> 40:02.520
Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have

40:02.520 --> 40:03.660
been playing this week.

40:03.660 --> 40:05.060
So Dark Soccer, I'll start with you.

40:05.060 --> 40:06.560
How was your gaming week?

40:06.560 --> 40:07.960
I did play Animal Crossing.

40:07.960 --> 40:11.880
I played pinball today.

40:11.880 --> 40:15.880
I played actually a little bit of Twilight Zone.

40:15.880 --> 40:26.500
I also played Kirby's Dreamland 3 on Super Nintendo and I forgot how slow that game is.

40:26.500 --> 40:29.280
So it was pretty slow.

40:29.280 --> 40:35.540
I've also played, well, I started playing Mark of the Ninja.

40:35.540 --> 40:41.060
I got through it a little bit and then I had to stop playing, so I actually lost my progress

40:41.060 --> 40:44.100
in it and I played some Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.

40:44.100 --> 40:45.780
So that was pretty fun.

40:45.780 --> 40:48.600
Just tried to play some different stuff.

40:48.600 --> 40:51.100
So that's all.

40:51.100 --> 40:52.980
All right.

40:52.980 --> 40:58.020
Did that event with the fancy bird start today?

40:58.020 --> 41:00.020
Was that a Valentine's thing in Animal Crossing?

41:00.020 --> 41:01.020
I can't remember his name.

41:01.020 --> 41:02.020
No, it's tomorrow.

41:02.020 --> 41:03.020
I'm sorry.

41:03.020 --> 41:04.020
Oh, it's tomorrow.

41:04.020 --> 41:05.020
Pave for Festivale.

41:05.020 --> 41:06.020
Pave, that's it.

41:06.020 --> 41:07.020
So, okay.

41:07.020 --> 41:09.740
Because I knew it was like really closely aligned with Valentine's Day.

41:09.740 --> 41:10.740
Okay.

41:11.420 --> 41:12.420
All right.

41:12.420 --> 41:17.020
Loki, I mean, I know you released a game this week, but maybe finally after getting your

41:17.020 --> 41:20.740
game on Steam and Itch, you got to play your own game.

41:20.740 --> 41:23.420
So how was your gaming week?

41:23.420 --> 41:24.960
I did play my own game actually.

41:24.960 --> 41:34.060
So we had, I bought an NES a couple weeks ago in anticipation of having to test my cartridges

41:34.060 --> 41:40.300
when I burned them, which I must say scared me a little bit.

41:40.300 --> 41:42.260
The burning process is actually pretty fast.

41:42.260 --> 41:44.500
24 seconds it takes to actually burn a cartridge.

41:44.500 --> 41:45.500
It's pretty great.

41:45.500 --> 41:46.500
Wow.

41:46.500 --> 41:47.500
That's awesome.

41:47.500 --> 41:53.700
But the thing is that they have these special security chips inside of them that it's for

41:53.700 --> 41:56.700
all regions because you may remember the original Nintendo.

41:56.700 --> 42:03.820
You can't play games from other regions without having that appropriate NES because they have

42:03.820 --> 42:04.820
lockout chips.

42:04.820 --> 42:09.760
Well, there's a special lockout chips in these where you can.

42:09.760 --> 42:15.280
But what happens is if you don't, if they're in a different region, if it's set up in a

42:15.280 --> 42:18.640
different region, it doesn't work right away.

42:18.640 --> 42:23.520
So I burned one of them and I put it in my NES and it just kept flashing the red light

42:23.520 --> 42:26.500
and like, Oh, that's not good.

42:26.500 --> 42:30.080
So I burned it a couple more times and tried a few different boards and it kept doing the

42:30.080 --> 42:31.080
same thing.

42:31.080 --> 42:35.520
Come to find out you have to hit reset a few times and it automatically switches the chip

42:35.520 --> 42:36.860
to your region.

42:36.860 --> 42:42.460
So it'll be something I'll have to like preface when people do end up purchasing physical

42:42.460 --> 42:43.540
versions of it.

42:43.540 --> 42:46.360
But thankfully all of the boards have worked, so it's great.

42:46.360 --> 42:51.280
So with that said, I actually did get to play my game on a TV with actual NES hardware and

42:51.280 --> 42:52.280
it's awesome.

42:52.280 --> 42:54.080
My kids played it for a long time too.

42:54.080 --> 42:55.240
They had a really great time.

42:55.240 --> 42:59.700
So you know, that's pretty cool to see.

42:59.700 --> 43:06.140
Aside from the Pixel Poop stuff, even though that was the, I did end up playing some Minecraft.

43:06.140 --> 43:12.320
We have one of our friends, a member of her punk night, uh, his daughter Hazel, she's

43:12.320 --> 43:16.060
been looking for some people to play Minecraft.

43:16.060 --> 43:19.360
I've seen this really cute exchange on, it was either Twitch or Facebook.

43:19.360 --> 43:21.020
I kind of saw you guys talking about this.

43:21.020 --> 43:22.020
Sorry.

43:22.020 --> 43:23.020
Go ahead.

43:23.020 --> 43:24.020
Yeah.

43:24.020 --> 43:27.220
So she's been looking for people to play Minecraft with and I said, well, you know, you can just

43:27.220 --> 43:31.040
come to our realm and you know, the kids will play with you.

43:31.040 --> 43:35.580
So that's why I did, we invited her in there and she, she created her house up on a hill

43:35.780 --> 43:40.140
and she, she was going to create a shop to sell dogs, but then she didn't realize that

43:40.140 --> 43:42.700
all the dogs that she tamed are all hers.

43:42.700 --> 43:46.420
So now she has like 13 dogs, but it's kind of funny.

43:46.420 --> 43:48.380
So you have the puppy cafe.

43:48.380 --> 43:49.380
Exactly.

43:49.380 --> 43:53.660
So I was like, well, now you have all these, all these dogs, uh, the ranch, but the good

43:53.660 --> 43:54.660
guys.

43:54.660 --> 43:55.660
The good kind.

43:55.660 --> 43:56.660
Yeah.

43:56.660 --> 43:57.660
So she's just building, you know, a bunch of stuff.

43:57.660 --> 43:58.660
She's having a good time with that.

43:58.660 --> 43:59.660
So I played a little bit of that.

43:59.660 --> 44:01.700
I probably used some more Minecraft this week.

44:01.700 --> 44:05.540
My kids have been bugging me for a while to, uh, well, I should say my youngest son's been

44:05.540 --> 44:10.740
bugging me a while at my oldest son's doing Roblox stuff now, but, um, so that's what

44:10.740 --> 44:12.100
I've really been kind of doing.

44:12.100 --> 44:13.100
I didn't play too much.

44:13.100 --> 44:19.220
I've worn a little bit, um, yeah, it's mainly just been, you know, cramming this week to

44:19.220 --> 44:20.480
get the release out.

44:20.480 --> 44:24.340
So now that that's done, I can kind of relax a little bit cause they, Oh my God is some

44:24.340 --> 44:27.360
stress nights, 1am for three days straight.

44:27.360 --> 44:33.840
So during the work week, uh, um, but yeah, it was a lot of work and it's not over either

44:33.840 --> 44:39.640
because, um, I still want to do an updated demo, so I got to, I've got to put one of

44:39.640 --> 44:40.920
those together.

44:40.920 --> 44:45.920
And then, um, eventually when we get to the physical release, I'm going to do be doing

44:45.920 --> 44:47.480
like a special edition.

44:47.480 --> 44:51.080
So I still have room on the cart to put more things.

44:51.080 --> 44:56.240
And I did have some stuff I was trying to implement at the 11th hour, but I didn't get

44:56.240 --> 45:02.000
a chance to, um, so one of the things I was actually going to implement was the option

45:02.000 --> 45:05.200
to choose between male and female characters.

45:05.200 --> 45:10.520
Um, I have the sprites in there already and it's pretty much hooked up.

45:10.520 --> 45:17.360
It's just, it, there's something, I don't know, um, what's bugged out about it, but

45:17.360 --> 45:21.800
there's something that's not exactly the same as I set up the second player.

45:21.800 --> 45:27.800
And so you, when you push a direction, it moves a block or it moves one tile and it

45:27.800 --> 45:31.300
stops and you have to keep pushing the button in order to do that.

45:31.300 --> 45:36.060
So I think it's something in one of my physics scripts or something that's looking specifically

45:36.060 --> 45:39.240
for the, uh, characters that are player one and player two.

45:39.240 --> 45:41.080
And so I just need to alter those.

45:41.080 --> 45:46.200
So eventually you'll be able to select gender sort of, or at least one has a ponytail.

45:46.200 --> 45:51.760
One has another hairstyle that's as far as you get, you know, with, uh, you know, gender

45:51.800 --> 45:54.280
options and so whatever.

45:54.280 --> 45:59.640
Um, so that'll be something that'll be in the, and you, you did commit that, that you're

45:59.640 --> 46:02.360
not going to charge again for special edition, right?

46:02.360 --> 46:03.360
Right.

46:03.360 --> 46:04.360
Yeah, no, no, no.

46:04.360 --> 46:07.080
It'll be just a free up update to the game.

46:07.080 --> 46:12.360
Whenever we do that, it'll be, that'll be good guy, Loki.

46:12.360 --> 46:15.080
It'll be the only version that's available on cartridge.

46:15.080 --> 46:19.840
So once they get to the cartridges, um, they it'll be, cause I want to pack those things

46:19.840 --> 46:20.840
full ever.

46:20.840 --> 46:22.560
You have 40 levels in there.

46:22.560 --> 46:24.520
Um, I don't know.

46:24.520 --> 46:26.000
I could add more, I guess.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
We'll, we'll see.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
I don't know.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
It's, it's long as it is.

46:29.000 --> 46:34.280
And I mean, we had people beat it in one day, so apparently it's not hard enough.

46:34.280 --> 46:36.520
Always going to be that there's always going to be that.

46:36.520 --> 46:39.240
Um, Bobby black was asking what about the physical edition?

46:39.240 --> 46:43.400
So to be clear, this definitive edition, when you are going to be done, done, that is the

46:43.400 --> 46:44.760
one that's going to the cartridge.

46:44.760 --> 46:49.000
So there will be no, like you're missing out cause you got the cartridge version.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
Once you put, once you've put a version on cartridge, you're done.

46:52.000 --> 46:57.680
Everybody that bought the game on steam itch IO gets the free, uh, director's cut directors

46:57.680 --> 46:59.600
for whatever you're calling it.

46:59.600 --> 47:00.600
Yeah.

47:00.600 --> 47:01.600
Fair.

47:01.600 --> 47:02.600
All right.

47:02.600 --> 47:03.600
Awesome.

47:03.600 --> 47:04.600
I like that.

47:04.600 --> 47:05.600
All right.

47:05.600 --> 47:06.600
I don't know.

47:06.600 --> 47:10.200
We'll, we'll have to workshop that Loki, my, my rates for think tanking are very low.

47:10.200 --> 47:11.200
All right.

47:11.200 --> 47:12.200
Anyway.

47:12.200 --> 47:13.860
Um, let's talk about, uh, my gaming week.

47:13.860 --> 47:15.360
So I don't have a lot to talk about.

47:15.360 --> 47:20.160
I played a lot of the usual stuff, Ingress, Orna, Pokemon go.

47:20.160 --> 47:25.240
Uh, I did, I just barely finished that lunar new year event today because you have to like

47:25.240 --> 47:26.360
catch all the fire types.

47:26.360 --> 47:30.960
I like went downtown and did it earlier today because I was having a hard time finding fire

47:30.960 --> 47:31.960
types.

47:31.960 --> 47:34.280
But once I went downtown and started driving around, it was really easy.

47:34.280 --> 47:38.000
I think I like did a raid to finish one and now they just started the Valentine's event

47:38.000 --> 47:41.480
today and the collection challenge is kind of a beast.

47:41.480 --> 47:45.160
Like there's like five Pokemon in there you have to get in raids or no four of them are

47:45.160 --> 47:49.160
raids and one of them is like field tasks or something like that.

47:49.160 --> 47:50.160
I don't remember.

47:50.160 --> 47:51.160
Maybe it's also a raid.

47:51.160 --> 47:52.160
I don't remember.

47:52.160 --> 47:54.160
Um, so there's a lot to do in that game.

47:54.160 --> 47:59.000
So, uh, working on that, but, uh, also still playing Final Fantasy 14 cause I play that

47:59.000 --> 48:04.720
game a lot, but I also did play some other games this week, including namely another

48:04.720 --> 48:06.080
Final Fantasy game.

48:06.080 --> 48:10.600
I played quite a bit of Final Fantasy 12, um, because as I'm sure some of you have been

48:10.600 --> 48:14.900
following Final Fantasy 12 just hit Xbox game pass this week.

48:14.900 --> 48:21.340
So, you know, even though I already own the game on PlayStation four, three question mark,

48:21.340 --> 48:25.140
whichever I think it was on four only, uh, zodiac age, of course.

48:25.140 --> 48:29.300
Uh, even though I already bought it there, you know, it's kind of nice because it's basically

48:29.300 --> 48:32.940
like free and I'm using my quotey fingers cause you know, nothing's free.

48:32.940 --> 48:39.940
Um, but because I pay for Xbox game pass, um, I, you know, I'm able to play it without

48:39.940 --> 48:41.680
an additional charge we'll say.

48:41.680 --> 48:43.340
And so I've been kind of playing through it again.

48:43.340 --> 48:48.540
Obviously loading times great, uh, and nothing is really suffering kind of like in Dragon

48:48.540 --> 48:52.820
Quest 11, you can't read some things in the loading screens cause it's too fast.

48:52.820 --> 48:58.060
Um, but there really is like Final Fantasy 12 just use a regular stuff in the cut scenes.

48:58.060 --> 49:01.940
This time I'm playing almost exclusively at double speed.

49:01.940 --> 49:03.460
Technically you could go up to quad speed.

49:03.460 --> 49:06.620
That's a bit much for me, but I'm playing almost exclusively in double speed and it

49:06.620 --> 49:09.060
is such a nice quality of life increase.

49:09.060 --> 49:13.020
And I always, I just always forget until I go back and visit what a great, um, you know,

49:13.020 --> 49:14.660
story, especially in the opening moments.

49:14.660 --> 49:19.060
I know later in the game it starts to drag a little, but like Final Fantasy 12, I think

49:19.060 --> 49:23.460
Final Fantasy 12 is aged better than most Final Fantasy games do.

49:23.460 --> 49:24.460
I don't know.

49:24.460 --> 49:27.860
Maybe I'm wrong in that, but I think 12 is really aged well compared to the other Final

49:27.860 --> 49:28.860
Fantasy games.

49:28.860 --> 49:30.300
So I think it's a fun one to play.

49:30.300 --> 49:35.980
So, um, uh, yeah, so that's one way I've been sinking lots of hours this week.

49:35.980 --> 49:41.420
Um, I mentioned that I'm paying for game pass, which I am, but, um, if you didn't know

49:41.420 --> 49:49.540
about this, there's an app on your, uh, Xbox one, the Microsoft or your Xbox one X, whatever

49:49.540 --> 49:53.620
there's a series X there's a Microsoft rewards app.

49:53.620 --> 49:59.260
Um, and again, you know, when you're opting into the rewards program, you're usually kind

49:59.260 --> 50:01.820
of opting into data collection and things like that.

50:01.820 --> 50:05.660
So you may not be comfortable with this whole thing, you know, read the fine print.

50:05.660 --> 50:09.180
I figure Microsoft knows all about me anyway, so whatever.

50:09.180 --> 50:10.900
So I do the Microsoft rewards thing.

50:10.900 --> 50:15.420
And honestly, if you use game pass and have that, you really start to rack up points.

50:15.420 --> 50:20.180
And if you pay attention to that rewards app, when you earn an achievement, once a day,

50:20.180 --> 50:22.100
you can turn that into 50 points.

50:22.100 --> 50:26.260
Um, there's usually like things you can do to get like a thousand points, or I think

50:26.260 --> 50:30.980
it's like even 2000 points and you donate a thousand of it to charity and all this stuff.

50:30.980 --> 50:35.000
So my point is, if you really pay attention to that stuff and the rewards, um, your points

50:35.040 --> 50:36.080
can start to add up.

50:36.080 --> 50:40.280
And what I did this week, I had 12,000 points or something like that.

50:40.280 --> 50:43.800
So I turned that into one month of game pass ultimate.

50:43.800 --> 50:48.400
So there's going to be this, this upcoming, cause I think my, I was paid through March

50:48.400 --> 50:49.400
3rd.

50:49.400 --> 50:53.860
So March I will have game pass and I didn't pay any extra for it.

50:53.860 --> 50:55.080
So that's kind of neat.

50:55.080 --> 50:58.220
So I just really, if you didn't know that that's a thing, the Microsoft has all those

50:58.220 --> 51:02.360
quests and stuff and you get points and you can actually being as well, I think you can,

51:02.360 --> 51:05.560
yeah, you can like, they do, it's all tied together.

51:05.560 --> 51:10.480
Like if you have the, the edge browser and you're using that with the rewards plugin

51:10.480 --> 51:12.440
and all that, it all adds up.

51:12.440 --> 51:16.440
But again, I completely understand why not everybody is comfortable with this.

51:16.440 --> 51:19.280
So I don't want to just jump out there and say, Oh, you should be using this.

51:19.280 --> 51:21.440
I'm just saying this is an option.

51:21.440 --> 51:25.440
And if you're comfortable with it, I just redeemed a month of free game pass ultimate.

51:25.440 --> 51:26.720
So I don't have to pay for it.

51:26.720 --> 51:29.200
So um, you decide what's best for you.

51:29.200 --> 51:32.600
But I feel like there's a lot of people that don't even know it's a thing.

51:32.600 --> 51:36.200
Um, and especially if you're already playing games on game pass, even just turning those

51:36.200 --> 51:41.240
into points, you can get like a dollar in Xbox live credit.

51:41.240 --> 51:46.400
It's just a dollar, but that's a dollar off whatever you buy digitally next.

51:46.400 --> 51:50.440
It's a free and it, you know what, if you can do it three times in a month, that's $3.

51:50.440 --> 51:52.720
If you buy a $10 game, that's 30% off.

51:52.720 --> 51:55.640
So it's, um, it's something to look into.

51:55.640 --> 51:58.480
So anyway, um, that was my gaming week.

51:58.480 --> 52:03.680
So let's get into some news, shall we, and we'll start off with a story from Loki.

52:03.680 --> 52:04.680
Yeah.

52:04.680 --> 52:10.080
So EA has acquired glue mobile for $2.1 billion.

52:10.080 --> 52:14.000
So you could say they're huffing glue.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.920
Sure.

52:15.920 --> 52:25.880
Um, they, they have done such games as diner dash cooking dash restaurant dash Gordon Ramsey

52:25.880 --> 52:34.320
and Kim Kardashian, Hollywood dashed, um, they've also, I guess they're doing some other

52:34.320 --> 52:41.360
games including Disney sorcerers arena and a deer Hunter.

52:41.360 --> 52:46.600
So so yes, Kim Kardashian is now an EA license.

52:46.600 --> 52:47.600
Yeah.

52:47.600 --> 52:48.600
Yay.

52:48.600 --> 52:49.600
Yay.

52:49.600 --> 52:53.240
Likes that, you know, mobile, uh, format for even their name.

52:53.240 --> 52:54.240
Yeah.

52:54.600 --> 52:55.600
Yeah.

52:55.600 --> 52:56.600
It's another thing with dash in the name.

52:56.600 --> 52:58.120
You're right.

52:58.120 --> 53:00.120
Do they have rainbow dash too?

53:00.120 --> 53:01.800
No, they do not.

53:01.800 --> 53:07.480
But uh, should we expect Madden dash pretty soon or, uh, who knows?

53:07.480 --> 53:08.480
Or FIFA dash?

53:08.480 --> 53:09.480
Well, man, I'm curious.

53:09.480 --> 53:10.480
What do you think?

53:10.480 --> 53:13.880
I mean, we can make all the Kim Kardashian jokes and we will, but what do you think EA

53:13.880 --> 53:14.880
is trying to do with this?

53:14.880 --> 53:20.120
Do you think that maybe that is actually you joke, but maybe a casual Madden type of thing

53:20.120 --> 53:21.840
on mobiles in the mobile space?

53:21.840 --> 53:23.920
I think they already have a casual Madden game on mobile.

53:24.600 --> 53:32.000
I guess it's just money they, they got, they've got money to buy developers and mobiles still

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
hot.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.360
I mean, why not?

53:35.360 --> 53:36.400
They want all the money.

53:36.400 --> 53:38.480
So it makes sense.

53:38.480 --> 53:42.760
Do you think we can get Kim Kardashian Hollywood on switch?

53:42.760 --> 53:47.680
I actually played that game for a hot minute when it was first EA doesn't know what switch

53:47.680 --> 53:48.680
is.

53:48.920 --> 53:53.800
They're only, they're only willing to put old versions of, uh, their, you know, soccer

53:53.800 --> 53:54.800
games on there.

53:54.800 --> 53:57.120
They, they don't put anything new on there.

53:57.120 --> 54:02.840
Um, did you play that Kim Kardashian Hollywood ever dark soccer, like when it was first out?

54:02.840 --> 54:04.960
Cause we've played some dumb games online.

54:04.960 --> 54:07.200
I thought that was one of them, but maybe not.

54:07.200 --> 54:08.200
No.

54:08.200 --> 54:09.200
No.

54:09.200 --> 54:10.200
All right.

54:10.200 --> 54:15.220
I will say, okay, do you want to know a really dumb mobile phone game I'm playing right now?

54:15.220 --> 54:18.940
And I'm actually going to expressly tell you guys, do not download this game.

54:18.940 --> 54:24.820
It is full of ads and it's very annoying, but like, yes, it's the one with the high

54:24.820 --> 54:27.520
heels for the five seconds that you're playing.

54:27.520 --> 54:28.520
It's actually really fun.

54:28.520 --> 54:29.520
It's a Zynga game.

54:29.520 --> 54:30.520
Did you know that?

54:30.520 --> 54:33.900
Um, for the five seconds that you're playing, it's actually really funny and it's actually

54:33.900 --> 54:35.520
just called high heels.

54:35.520 --> 54:39.940
And all you're doing is you're, it's like you're walking down and you're strutting in

54:39.940 --> 54:43.500
high heels and you're trying to avoid obstacles.

54:43.500 --> 54:47.960
And at the very end, if your heels are tall enough, um, you actually get to strut the

54:47.960 --> 54:51.420
runway and your, your little character sashay is down the runway.

54:51.420 --> 54:54.020
It's really, and the great thing is there's all these different characters.

54:54.020 --> 54:57.940
Um, there's actually, they actually have like a plus size character.

54:57.940 --> 55:02.580
They have, you know, lots of, you know, women that you would expect would be parading around

55:02.580 --> 55:03.580
in high heels.

55:03.580 --> 55:08.080
They have a, actually two dude characters in high heels that I've seen so far.

55:08.080 --> 55:09.980
So high heels are for everyone.

55:09.980 --> 55:12.060
And I think, uh, the game cracks me up.

55:12.060 --> 55:16.140
But again, please do not download this game because it is full of spammy ads.

55:16.140 --> 55:22.340
It's it's a lot like, it's a lot like I played it for a little bit and I got, they do, they

55:22.340 --> 55:27.700
have an ad free version and maybe I just need to suck it up and pay the three, but I feel

55:27.700 --> 55:30.540
like I still won't get around some ads with that though.

55:30.540 --> 55:33.660
Cause like you can watch ads to unlock characters and stuff.

55:33.660 --> 55:36.100
I'm telling you ads are everywhere in that game.

55:36.100 --> 55:40.700
And if you, if you pay for it, then a lot of those will just give you the unlocks or

55:40.700 --> 55:46.380
you can pay like, like, uh, an in-app purchase or something.

55:46.380 --> 55:47.380
Yeah.

55:47.380 --> 55:50.700
Um, pixel pockets and chat says I played that high heels game.

55:50.700 --> 55:55.140
It amuses me how the chick claps her hands over her head when she does the splits.

55:55.140 --> 55:56.420
The guys do it too.

55:56.420 --> 56:04.040
When they're going down the ramps, they go, it's so ridiculous.

56:04.040 --> 56:05.040
I love it.

56:05.040 --> 56:09.460
Like, you know, who would love this game is your wife, Loki.

56:09.460 --> 56:15.980
I feel like she'd crack up maybe just show her the part where the guy's going down the

56:15.980 --> 56:21.140
ramp and the splits going, she might, yeah, she might check it out.

56:21.140 --> 56:23.140
I don't know.

56:23.140 --> 56:27.620
Uh, pixel pocket says I didn't unlock any guys yet.

56:27.620 --> 56:32.700
There's one in the, um, the, the guy wearing the suit is three videos.

56:32.700 --> 56:34.060
You have to look in the little shot.

56:34.060 --> 56:35.940
I can't believe, wow.

56:35.940 --> 56:36.940
Orange orange radio.

56:36.940 --> 56:38.220
We give tips on high heels.

56:38.220 --> 56:39.220
The game.

56:39.220 --> 56:40.220
Anyway.

56:40.220 --> 56:41.220
That's what it is.

56:41.220 --> 56:46.580
It's a high heel game podcast now.

56:46.580 --> 56:47.580
I quit.

56:47.580 --> 56:48.580
All right.

56:48.580 --> 56:56.060
Get all your, get all your high heel hacks and tips right here.

56:56.060 --> 56:58.300
Just wait until we get to our games of the year.

56:58.300 --> 56:59.660
All right.

56:59.660 --> 57:05.620
Anyway, how we got from EA and glue to that, who knows, but anyway, let's talk about another

57:05.620 --> 57:10.460
game that gets me excited where I go, whoa, a crash bandicoot crash bandicoot.

57:10.460 --> 57:11.660
That series is a lot of fun.

57:11.660 --> 57:14.940
And of course, crash bandicoot part four recently came out.

57:14.940 --> 57:20.800
It came out on PlayStation and Xbox anyway, but it's also going to be coming to the switch

57:20.800 --> 57:23.660
and at some point the PC.

57:23.660 --> 57:30.660
So a Activision said this week that crash four will be coming to switch on March 12th

57:30.660 --> 57:35.300
as well as PlayStation five and Xbox series X.

57:35.300 --> 57:38.520
There will be a PC version in the future.

57:38.520 --> 57:43.620
So you know, you can get your mods, which user generated levels, I bet will show up

57:43.620 --> 57:44.620
too.

57:44.620 --> 57:45.620
So that'll be a lot of fun.

57:45.620 --> 57:47.080
So that's pretty cool.

57:47.080 --> 57:50.300
Can't wait for all the nude mods.

57:50.300 --> 57:51.300
Let's not.

57:51.300 --> 57:56.980
So anyway, the PS five and Xbox series X versions will be 60 bucks.

57:56.980 --> 58:00.740
The switch and the PC versions only 40 bucks.

58:00.740 --> 58:03.580
So I guess it costs money to print them disks.

58:03.580 --> 58:04.580
I don't know.

58:04.580 --> 58:05.940
Or maybe it's the higher graphics.

58:05.940 --> 58:10.340
I would imagine the switch version is more of a port of the existing PlayStation four

58:10.340 --> 58:11.940
and Xbox one versions.

58:11.940 --> 58:20.180
And then the PlayStation five and series X and S versions will be more refined.

58:20.180 --> 58:23.140
They don't really say exactly what the whole thing.

58:23.140 --> 58:24.140
Oh, well.

58:24.140 --> 58:25.140
Oh, yeah.

58:25.140 --> 58:26.140
I'm sorry.

58:26.140 --> 58:35.020
The 60 frame a second visual is what you'd expect with the upgrade to PlayStation five

58:35.020 --> 58:40.780
and the series X and S. So, all right.

58:40.780 --> 58:41.780
Let's move on.

58:41.780 --> 58:44.580
Dark Sakura.

58:44.580 --> 58:51.580
There's a company that's basically telling Sony, fuck you, sue us.

58:51.580 --> 58:54.260
It's a Canadian company called dbrand.

58:54.260 --> 58:59.060
They're doing replacement PS five plates that they've called dark plates.

58:59.060 --> 59:02.060
And they're just basically like, we're going to sell them.

59:02.060 --> 59:03.060
Don't worry.

59:03.060 --> 59:10.300
They're forty nine dollars, I guess, forty nine US without the cost of shipping.

59:10.300 --> 59:14.420
And on their website, I'm just going to read the quote with the release of dark plates.

59:14.420 --> 59:15.900
The unthinkable has happened.

59:15.900 --> 59:20.860
We've taken Sony's monumental achievement in bad design and fixed it.

59:20.860 --> 59:25.900
We can only assume that our prizes are in the mail.

59:25.900 --> 59:29.140
So it's.

59:29.140 --> 59:30.140
It's interesting.

59:30.140 --> 59:34.060
I mean, especially since, you know, there's other companies that try to do it and one

59:34.060 --> 59:39.260
of them, which is PlayStation five dot com, had to change their name and remove the imagery

59:39.260 --> 59:43.860
when Sony threatened them.

59:43.860 --> 59:50.620
And I mean, and basically the plates are actually a little bit difficult to get off and it looks

59:50.620 --> 59:54.540
like Sony was actually going to try to be doing their own, even though they haven't

59:54.540 --> 59:56.220
made an announcement on it.

59:56.220 --> 01:00:01.300
But I mean, the the dbrand ones look cool, I mean, but they are what they are.

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:02.900
And they're right on the top of the website.

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:06.100
It says, go ahead, sue us.

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:13.580
Why are they so I mean, maybe someone will like why are they so confident that there's

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:14.580
lawsuit proof?

01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:18.340
Are they in another country or something where they're in Canada?

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:19.860
Well.

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:24.340
I don't think I mean, I feel like there's been Canadian companies and things that have

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:29.660
been shut down, like that's not usually distance enough, I think, from the US, I guess.

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:33.300
You know, usually you have to you have to go somewhere that gets a little more competitive

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:38.300
with the US sometimes, things like China or Russia or things like that to have a website

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:44.020
that can really just, you know, not give a hoot about trademarks and things like that.

01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:48.300
So it's interesting to me that they're being so bold about come for us, Sony.

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:51.140
But I mean, could they potentially be right?

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:53.400
Like what what are they really selling?

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:56.020
They're selling some plastic, right?

01:00:56.020 --> 01:01:01.880
That just so conveniently copyrighted, though the shape of the plastic is is a copyrighted

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:02.880
thing.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.420
That actual shape is wow.

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:05.420
Okay.

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:10.020
I mean, I guess I mean, that's what I thought when the initial lawsuit was that they're

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:12.800
saying that, listen, that's intellectual property.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.460
You can't do that.

01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:20.620
More like, I don't know, like, there's lots of things that they've had that like, people

01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:26.740
have made designs for remember when we used to have like faceplates for the Xbox 360?

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:31.100
I don't know if those were necessarily licensed from Microsoft.

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:32.660
I don't know.

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:38.580
It seems silly, but there's a little bit more for that they they have a different texture

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:41.580
on it than the official ones.

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:44.440
And their face button designs are a little different.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:51.400
So I think that they're relying on that 50 percent difference thing to bypass the copyright.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.400
I see.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.400
So we'll see.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:54.400
Interesting.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.400
Yeah.

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:59.960
S.J. 100 Matt in our chat at Twitch.TV slash Vogue Network says doesn't seem very friendly

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.160
reaction by them.

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:02.600
Not really Canadian.

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.600
That's true.

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:06.880
This is a very this is a very this is very aggressive for Canadians.

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:11.200
I'm just pointing out, you know, I think it's very clearly Canadian.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.640
Yeah, I get it.

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:14.640
I get it.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.320
This pandemic has clearly changed us all.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.320
All right.

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.320
I've been watching way too much Fuzzy Bear.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.320
Waka waka.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.320
All right.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:22.320
Next story, Loki.

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.320
All right.

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:30.840
So I don't remember if we talked about this last week, but CG product red had been hacked

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:38.000
and hackers had stolen the source code for several games, including Witcher three, Cyberpunk

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.160
2077.

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:43.240
There is also a Witcher three.

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:47.080
I think an RTX version of Witcher three or something like that that hasn't been released

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:50.720
yet and some other stuff.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:57.840
So yeah, along with that, there was also investor information, H.R. information, stuff like

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:58.840
that.

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:03.480
They had originally made the threat that to see your product read that if you don't pay

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:10.160
us the money that we're asking for, we're going to sell it the black market basically.

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:13.440
And CG product red said, nope, we're not paying you.

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:16.640
And so they went ahead and sold it on the black market.

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:24.800
So apparently through this exploit forum posts, they were asking for a starting bid of $1

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:31.480
million and a otherwise a kind of a bite now price of 7 million.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:37.560
But apparently, though, based on some of the posts there, they have a buyer that they found.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:46.120
And so someone did purchase the information for apparently a decent price, according to

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.960
the person that posted it on there.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:56.080
So we'll see what that was one of the Project Red people that did it like in disguise or

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:57.080
something.

01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.080
One of the CEOs.

01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:59.080
I don't know that.

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:03.800
So they basically said that they're not going to be posting, they're not going to be leaking

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.560
out any of the source code or anything.

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:11.360
Whoever bought it is going to be the one that basically gets the source code.

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:15.320
I don't know what they're going to do with it or who would have bought it, but I don't

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.320
know.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:23.760
Well, I'm saying if they had an employee or something with their funds earmarked for it,

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:34.520
they could in theory make the purchase, retain their information and still have stuck to

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:35.520
their guns.

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.520
Make sense?

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.520
Yeah, maybe.

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:42.720
But it'd be weird, though, if they did purchase it and then but said that they weren't going

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.720
to deal with them.

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:44.720
I don't know.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:45.720
It's kind of weird.

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.680
Technically, the company is not dealing with them.

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:53.520
Somebody for them is dealing with them, just to think of it.

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:56.840
There's actually an Internet conspiracy theory that goes even further.

01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:59.720
Bobby Blackwilven's chat says, read the ransom note, lol.

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:03.180
You did such a good job, Bobby, on your show tonight that I don't feel the need to try

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:04.180
to one up it.

01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:06.000
Go check out the clip.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.240
But one kind of like Internet conspiracy theory that Bobby kind of went into on his show a

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:16.080
little bit is the thought that CD Projekt Red may have made this whole thing up.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:22.960
Now this meaning that they essentially never lost their code and that they set this whole

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.640
thing up start to finish.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:29.860
Now this gets a little bit dicey because if law enforcement is involved and they made

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:36.600
it up, then they're probably breaking a much bigger law by doing that than having their

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:39.440
source code out there.

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:44.480
But I don't think I mean, kind of like where Dark Soccer was going, where like an employee

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:48.440
could kind of do it and then it's not actually CD Projekt Red.

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:51.360
I really don't think that's outside the realm of possibility at all.

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:56.400
I think one of the CEOs could have done it if it's legit.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.960
But there's there's the Internet conspiracy theory that the whole thing's alive.

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:04.920
Just like make us like, oh, we'll forgive Cyberpunk being, you know, the way it is right

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:08.720
now because you had your stuff, you know, stolen.

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.880
Oh, we feel bad for you.

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.880
All is forgiven.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.800
No, no.

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:19.300
It could be one of those you have to go down to go up sort of things.

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:23.460
And if the hacking or whatever, the stealing of the source code caused the stock price

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:29.340
to go down, then the news that somebody has saved the source code and prevented it from

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:33.300
being leaked is going to cause the stock to go up.

01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:34.460
Just a thought.

01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:35.580
I kind of agree.

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:38.860
I don't know what the angle really is to make the whole thing up.

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:42.380
Wall Street Bets is behind it the whole time.

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:44.800
Except I don't think CD Projekt Red is on Wall Street.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.580
It's a different stock market.

01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:51.760
They're using their GameStop tendies to buy black market source code.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:54.180
How much have you lost on the GameStop game, Loki?

01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:55.180
50 bucks.

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:56.820
No, that's not too bad.

01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:58.140
I only bought one share.

01:06:58.140 --> 01:06:59.140
It's fine.

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.580
I haven't lost anything because I haven't sold it yet.

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:06.100
So it's all theoretical losses at the moment.

01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:09.540
Hopefully you'll make that money back on Pixel Poop's number two sales.

01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:13.380
Well, I made that money back on Bitcoin.

01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:16.420
No, not Bitcoin, but Dogecoin.

01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:19.420
I've already made that money back on Dogecoin, so it's fine.

01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:24.340
But I wasn't playing it to make, I mean, I was playing the stock market to make some

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:28.580
money, but I wasn't like, if I lose this money, it's like, oh, whatever, you know, gambling

01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:29.580
basically.

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:30.580
Yeah.

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:31.580
All right.

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.140
Well, moving on.

01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:38.420
We talked earlier in the show about how Crash Bandicoot number four is coming to PC at

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:39.420
some point.

01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:43.940
Well, there was a pretty big announcement about another big franchise coming to PC,

01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:46.140
and I'm not sure a lot of people saw this coming.

01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:51.100
I don't think people really expected that this was a series that was kind of targeting

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.820
PC, but it's going to happen.

01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:56.600
And that is Kingdom Hearts is coming to PC.

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:58.220
Which Kingdom Hearts?

01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:05.100
Pretty much all of them are coming to PC, meaning Kingdom Hearts, the HD 1.5 and 2.5

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:10.340
remix, that jumbo collection that has like all the early Kingdom Hearts games, Kingdom

01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:18.300
Hearts HD 2.8 final chapter prologue, the Kingdom Hearts 3 and the Remind DLC also coming

01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:23.780
to PC, and the recent Kingdom Hearts Melody of Memory also, I'm sorry, not Steam, coming

01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:26.180
to PC, actually very different.

01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:31.740
They are going to be Epic Game Store exclusives when they come out, and that's the other big

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:38.220
surprise behind this, is that they are going to be exclusive on the Epic Store March 30th

01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:40.820
when they all come out.

01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:47.700
The 1.5 and 2.5 remix will cost 50 bucks, the rest will cost 60 bucks, and of course

01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:53.300
due to the needs on the PC of some of these games, they will vary in what they're going

01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:58.100
to require graphically in order for them to work, especially when you consider the older

01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:07.620
games were out a couple years ago, and Kingdom Hearts 3 is as recent as 2019, so yeah, big

01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:08.620
surprise there.

01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:13.980
I don't know if anyone's interested in playing that on PC again, but I think it's interesting

01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:20.620
that, again, we joke about the mods and how people kind of rip into the PC games that

01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:26.620
way, but we now have Kingdom Hearts, a Disney property that is going to, I mean it's not

01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:31.580
like it's the first Disney thing to ever be on PC, but I think of something at this level,

01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:37.260
it's kind of surprising a little bit, but I think it also just goes to show that there's

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:39.660
a lot of money to be made on PC game sales.

01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:45.340
I think especially in, and I think this is always something important to consider, especially

01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:53.340
in territories outside the big ones we usually talk about, the US, Canada, and the big countries

01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:57.740
in Europe that are big video game countries, I think outside of that, especially when you

01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:03.500
get into countries like South America and so forth, you get a lot of PC gamers because

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:09.220
consoles may not be as readily available, so I think that's, I think it's interesting

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:11.900
because it allows the game to reach a wider audience.

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:15.060
I'm curious what you think about that, Loki.

01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:20.360
I think it's exciting that they're coming to PC, mainly because I, well, I have a lot

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:25.360
of these, at least I have Kingdom Hearts 3, I think I have the other ones as well on PlayStation

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:31.720
right now, but I just haven't gotten around to playing them, but maybe I'll play them

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:37.180
on PC if I buy them again, or maybe I won't because I'll just own another copy, it'll

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:42.080
rot away in your library, go into my library, hey, maybe I can use this free time to play

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.080
all these games I haven't played yet.

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.080
What?

01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:48.160
You haven't thought about your next game?

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:52.560
I have so many next games, it's not even funny.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:58.520
Phoenix7726 in chat says, 60 bucks was way too much for 2.8 on PS4 and it still is on

01:10:58.520 --> 01:10:59.520
PC.

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:01.240
I'm kind of of that mindset.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:05.200
These games have been on sale, I don't know how many times at this point, I'm not gonna

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:11.840
pay full price for these games on PC, but by the time, you know, the holidays come around,

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:16.600
they'll all be half off, so I might dip into one of them at that point.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:21.440
I don't know, I need to spend some money on upgrading my PC, I think, just because it's

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:24.720
a few years old at this point and I don't see something like Kingdom Hearts 3 running

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:28.140
very well on it at all, so we'll see.

01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:31.680
But I find the news fascinating, because it's one of those things where it's like, I don't

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:35.120
think there were a lot of people asking for this, but then again, maybe I'm just spoiled

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:40.360
because okay, I have Xbox, I have PlayStation, maybe there were gamers in other places that

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:45.120
were asking for this that only game on PC and they got it.

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.400
It was just a surprise that it actually happened, I think.

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:51.320
So anyway, that'll be in March.

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.800
Let's move on to our next story, Dark Sakura.

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:59.720
There have been some interesting trademarks that have shown up recently.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:04.320
It was actually earlier this week, there is a trademark for The Legend of Zelda Phantom

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:13.880
Hourglass, and then we also have for Ocarina of Time and Wind Waker.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:19.640
So maybe we are getting updated versions of those games, especially for the 35th anniversary

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:21.840
of The Legend of Zelda.

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:25.160
They're going to do the same thing they did with All-Stars on the Switch, but just do

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:26.680
it with Zelda.

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:27.680
They better not.

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:29.320
That's going to be terrible.

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:33.440
They are, because I totally get it called up they are, because they already have the

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:36.440
emulators built for those other systems.

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:39.520
That's why you have All-Stars the way it is right now.

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:42.080
I think it was emulating those older games.

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:46.040
So now we just pop some Zelda games in there, run them off the same emulators.

01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:48.000
Makes perfect sense to me.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.920
And they're going to do the limited time thing again, you think?

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:51.920
Yes.

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:55.600
That would be foolish.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:01.920
It would be foolish, but it would be the Nintendo way, because when something can't have a shortage

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:05.320
or an artificial shortage, create an artificial shortage.

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:09.680
In the case of digital goods, where there literally isn't infinite supply, but we're

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:14.800
going to make it short for some reason.

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.800
That Mario 3D is in the top selling list.

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:18.960
I don't like it either.

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:26.640
I don't think it's in the top selling because of the fact that it's not artificially scarce.

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:31.320
I think people are going to buy it anyways, but it's stupid.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:32.320
It really is.

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:37.720
If they think that's just going to drive the price up, I mean, I guess, but it's not like

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.320
it's going to come down in price anyways.

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:42.760
They don't drop the price of any of their games, like hardly ever.

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:46.960
So that's why they're pulling it.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:50.360
We'd rather pull it than see it go on sale.

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:54.080
It doesn't go on sale, even if they weren't going to pull it.

01:13:54.080 --> 01:14:03.200
I think just recently, Splatoon 2 had come down to $49.99, and I think that was just

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:04.560
a limited time sale.

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:08.680
I mean, they never put their games on sale anyways.

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:13.280
I don't think that there would be any risk of this, whatever.

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:18.480
I'm not even going to try to guess what Nintendo's thinking because it's going to hurt my brain.

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:23.000
Dr. Tetsuya in chat says, my theory is that the Mario stuff ends in March, right?

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.520
Maybe they'll move on to Zelda after it's all done, and there might be another collection

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:29.920
involved.

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:31.280
It would make sense.

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:35.640
Again, as much as I also hate the limited time thing, it just seems like a very Nintendo

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:36.640
thing to do.

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:43.640
And I think the story Dark Soccer just reported on, it's one of those where there's smoke,

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:46.120
there's fire type of things, but we'll see.

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:49.000
We haven't really had any updates from Nintendo in quite some time.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.560
So I think most of us are just looking forward to some type of official Nintendo update.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:59.160
I mean, we haven't had a legitimate Nintendo Direct since the pandemic began.

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.160
Am I right?

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.840
We've had some minis, we've had some indie showcases.

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:07.520
I don't think we've had a full-on Nintendo Direct since the pandemic began.

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:12.160
It's been a long time.

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:19.000
We had one since the pandemic because we had one during their E3 time.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.640
Didn't we have something around that time, I thought?

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:25.120
I thought we didn't even get that, to be honest, but I think you're right.

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:28.040
I think we did get some type of little mini showcase right around in there.

01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:29.040
You're right.

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.040
You're right.

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:32.080
Still, even then, that's like six months ago.

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:33.920
I don't think there's been anything since then.

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:39.000
Well, they dropped, I remember that was one of the things where they dropped Paper Mario

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000
on us.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.880
Like, hey, by the way, it's coming out next month type of thing.

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:48.000
I don't know why they don't do a Direct.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000
All right.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:55.080
Well, moving on, let's talk about not a Direct, but a Drift.

01:15:55.080 --> 01:16:01.600
Yeah, you know, I don't understand why these companies can't get their hardware right.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:10.120
Like if you're a company like Sony and you saw that, hey, Nintendo released these Joy-Cons

01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:13.680
and they're having issues with their analog sticks drifting.

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:14.680
Let's use the same parts.

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:16.440
That'd be a great idea.

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:21.520
So like apparently now they're having the same issue with drifting.

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:27.840
I'm assuming it's coming from the analog sticks, the same parts with that.

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:33.760
It's just beyond stupid at this point and I'm sure they're going to play it down.

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:38.920
But apparently people complained and you can get it fixed, but it is a pain in the ass

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:43.080
to do it.

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:46.620
I just wish that they would just do some damn research.

01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:49.300
What is wrong with the analog sticks we used to have?

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:52.220
Like the ones from like the Xbox 360.

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:54.220
Never had really drifting issues with that.

01:16:54.220 --> 01:17:00.260
I had a couple die, but they never got to the point where like it was drifting or we

01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:05.660
had it, was it with the PlayStation 4 where the rubber on them would just disintegrate.

01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:10.060
Like stop using cheap shit in your expensive consoles.

01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:13.820
I mean, come on, just fix this shit.

01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:19.940
If I'm paying like, what is this, controllers probably like at least like $60, $70, if I'm

01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:28.100
paying $70 for this crap, put some damn analog sticks in it that are actually going to last.

01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:33.260
Or is this on purpose so I have to buy more of your damn controllers?

01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:34.660
Absolutely on purpose.

01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:39.820
Well, that's how you get class action lawsuits and then nobody wins.

01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:45.540
But seriously, you don't want to be known as a company that puts out like fucking cheap

01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:46.540
shit.

01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:51.580
I mean, seriously, this is annoying.

01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:55.340
It's hard for me to comment because I still don't have a PlayStation 5.

01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:59.460
When I hear kind of news like this, I kind of go, oh, maybe it's a good thing I waited.

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:03.060
Maybe they'll be able to work this out before I decide to jump on board with the PlayStation

01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:05.060
5 finally.

01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:07.700
The chat is lighting up about this a little bit.

01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:11.780
Sia Tabiri in chat says, didn't it take almost a year for Joy-Con Drift to be a thing?

01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:14.620
I think maybe for people to discover that.

01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:19.540
I don't think it took a year, but it's a similar kind of length of time, I think.

01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:20.540
S.G.O.

01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:24.820
and Hunter Matt says they cut corners to save as much as they can on the console or controller.

01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:27.620
Quest Buster says two words, cost savings.

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:31.020
So a lot of people saying that even though it's an expensive console, it doesn't mean

01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:35.800
they still don't nickel and dime where they can to produce it cheaply so they don't lose

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:40.040
as much money with every console that they sell.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.680
All right.

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:44.560
Let's move on to a follow up from something last week.

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:49.760
So we talked a little bit about Google Stadia last week and how they were no longer going

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.840
to be making first party games or exclusives.

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:57.000
And a lot of people, including us to an extent, were kind of saying, well, this is the beginning

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.300
of the end for Stadia because a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:05.280
And if Google is not going to make their own games anymore to push their own console or

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:08.960
you know, cloud console, whatever you want to call it, then the idea is pretty much dead

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:09.960
in the water.

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:15.320
Well, I think Google is seeing the way that people online are reacting to this.

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:20.240
So they decided to put out a statement this week, an announcement that said there are

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:23.900
over 100 games coming to Stadia this year.

01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:26.720
So that's what they said in their post.

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:29.380
They even dated some of the games.

01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:36.060
FIFA 21 on March 17th, an action RPG title called Judgment on April 23rd by the folks

01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:41.540
behind Yakuza, Shantae Half Genie Hero Ultimate Edition, as well as Grisky Revenge.

01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:47.340
Anyway, obviously I can't read all 100 games on air, but Google is kind of going out there

01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:52.220
to say, hey, you know, there's still all of this that is coming to Stadia.

01:19:52.220 --> 01:20:00.100
So it was interesting that they kind of put that out there after they see again, I don't

01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:04.660
know if I were managing the company, I would have put this out at the same time as the

01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:05.980
prior announcement.

01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:09.700
I don't know why the way that they announced that they have 100 games coming out because

01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:14.760
even still, you're going to have who cares if you still have to purchase those games

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:15.760
on those platforms.

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:20.060
And it's not that I don't trust that there's going to be games on time script.

01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:22.020
First off, none of those are exclusive to Stadia.

01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:23.020
None of them are exclusive.

01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:24.020
Yeah.

01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:25.020
Like, why do I even bother?

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:26.900
And second, it's Google is the one running it.

01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:31.980
So you know that if they're not backing it up, then that's it.

01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:33.220
They can pull the plug in any time.

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:36.640
It doesn't matter how many games they have on the platform.

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:40.820
If Google themselves isn't interested in it and they go to something else that's shiny

01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:43.820
instead, then it's gone.

01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:47.700
All those games you purchased, well, too bad.

01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:49.980
I mean, like, I don't know.

01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:51.540
Like it's, it's silly.

01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:55.380
So like, I would think if I'm going to purchase those games in particular, and especially

01:20:55.380 --> 01:21:00.620
some of those I've already been on other platforms, um, I'm just going to purchase those on PC

01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:06.100
or another platform that has those because I know that those platforms aren't going away.

01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:07.860
It just seems very risky.

01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:10.540
I'll tell you one game that's not coming to Stadia.

01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:12.820
Some of you may have heard about this as well.

01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:18.200
So the game Terraria, which is kind of like a 2D version of Minecraft, uh, this game's

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:19.200
pretty old.

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:21.400
It's been out a long time.

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:22.400
Yeah.

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:23.400
Yeah.

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:24.400
Oh yeah.

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:25.400
It's very popular.

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:27.720
It's on a lot of console at pretty much every console out there, but it will not be going

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:28.720
to Stadia.

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:30.440
And why is that happening?

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:37.200
Because the, uh, CEO behind, uh, re logic, who is the Terraria co-creator Andrew Spinks

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:40.000
went up, popped off as they say on Twitter.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.200
But honestly, I, you know, hearing this side of the story, I get where he's coming from,

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.780
uh, apparently, and I'll just read the tweets.

01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:50.460
My phone has lost access to thousands of dollars in apps on Google play.

01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:54.660
I had just bought LOTR Lord of the rings 4k and I can't finish it.

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.420
My Google drive data is completely gone.

01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:58.320
I can't access my YouTube channel.

01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:02.100
The worst of all is losing access to my Gmail address of over 15 years.

01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:06.860
I absolutely have not done anything to violate your terms of service so I can take this no

01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:09.700
other way than you deciding to burn this bridge.

01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:13.140
Consider it burned Terraria for Google Stadia is canceled.

01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:16.760
My company will no longer support any of your platforms moving forward.

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:24.220
So essentially this guy got some type of ban on a Google product, which I think they're

01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:26.360
saying was a YouTube thing.

01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:33.080
Uh, demi logic, which is the, uh, parent account for re logic, got a notice from YouTube saying

01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:35.760
it was in violation of the site's policies.

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:40.120
But of course they don't know what it is and they hadn't uploaded anything in three months

01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:45.480
and it's not like they're producing, you know, R rated content and things like this.

01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:48.480
Like there really is no explanation for the ban.

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:53.520
And this plays into the scary reality, you know, and I'm one of those people that I have

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:54.880
a lot invested in Google.

01:22:54.880 --> 01:23:00.240
I've been using Gmail as, as one of my main emails for a very long time.

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:05.560
And you know, it is scary if I were to, you know, put up a YouTube that got myself banned

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:07.580
or something, I would lose access to all this stuff.

01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:08.760
And it's kind of scary.

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:13.240
And what's really scary about it is that there's no fucking human being at Google.

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:15.120
That's willing to answer these questions.

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:19.680
Or if there is a fucking human being, it's not one that has any fucking compassion or

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:22.880
one that can go off of a script whatsoever.

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:31.240
It is a, all you, I guarantee it an outsourced, lower than minimum wage person that is paid

01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:36.920
to stick to a script and can't do anything outside of that script.

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:42.940
And that is the behavior from Google that I really should change.

01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:47.140
You know, these whole like, well, you got banned, can't do anything about it.

01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:52.060
Like there needs to be real people to talk through these issues with.

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:57.640
It's horrible customer service to do the alternative.

01:23:57.640 --> 01:23:59.580
And that's what's happening.

01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:01.740
And it's, it's kind of not just Google.

01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:06.560
And again, I'm deferring to something that came up on Bobby's show because he gets to

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:07.560
go before us.

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.900
So sometimes he beats us to some points.

01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:15.280
He talks about Facebook and Oculus and why a lot of people are turned off from the new

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:20.780
Oculus Rift devices, because in order to use them, you have to have a Facebook account.

01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:23.580
And if your Facebook account gets banned, guess what?

01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:29.860
And Dark Sakura, I saw you playing around on Facebook earlier, kind of trying to get

01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:32.180
banned doing stuff.

01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:34.020
So I'm trying to see where the limit is.

01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:39.880
So basically you're trying to challenge the bot on Facebook that bans things for just

01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:41.360
saying certain phrases.

01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:42.360
Yeah.

01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:45.240
I went to, cause I tried whore.

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:50.400
One of my friends got a ban for saying, for saying that they were a whore for something.

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:51.400
So I did whore.

01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:52.400
I did slut.

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:53.560
I did man slut.

01:24:53.560 --> 01:25:01.080
I'm not going to do child porn just because that makes me feel disgusting, but, hold on.

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:02.080
I did another one.

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:03.080
Let me see.

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:06.680
Well, and you should stick to things that have legitimate reasons for talking about

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:07.680
them.

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:09.680
Like whore, you know, there might be a little bit.

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:17.600
You know, and honest, you know, and, and the, the phrase die bitch, while it might sound

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:22.040
harsh, you know, if I'm talking to my friend or something, if we're being catty, if we've

01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:23.040
had a company.

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:24.040
No, bye.

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:25.040
B-Y-E.

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:26.040
Oh, bye bitch.

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.040
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:28.040
I thought you said die bitch.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.040
Well.

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:30.040
No.

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:31.040
I mean, I tell people that.

01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.240
I don't tell people that because I take like suicide stuff.

01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:34.440
I don't joke about that.

01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:35.440
Yeah.

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:39.080
But you know, if it, but I could see other people like that are friends and if they're

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:44.000
just being catty with each other, you know, and somebody says like, you know, oh, I get

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:49.560
the whole week off work because die bitch, you know, like I'm so jealous, you know, like

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:53.240
that's between them and that shouldn't get them banned from Facebook for doing something

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:54.520
like that.

01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:59.240
Especially not bye bitch because I probably said that myself on January 20th.

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:05.800
But anyway, I'm going to chat for some other comments.

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:09.480
Tiger Claw says, Google does not have a good track record when they create new services.

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:11.920
They ultimately, at some point, get shut down.

01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:14.860
As 200 Matt says, my work uses a lot of Google workspace stuff.

01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:17.940
We use it for two-factor auth, sheets, doc, drive, email.

01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:23.040
If we were to lose that, then we would, they'd be very challenged to do their work.

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:27.320
Unfortunately, it's a corporate decision, but we're forever beholden to Google.

01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:32.920
So I think this, if nothing else, this Terraria news should really make a lot of people kind

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:38.320
of go like, maybe I need to reevaluate this Google thing.

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:43.680
You know, Google's done a lot of great stuff, but as we're starting to peel back some of

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:48.040
the layers here, especially with how they've botched Stadia, and now we have this news

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:53.720
and everything, like you find that Google is not always a well-run company.

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:58.360
And there's very, I mean, there's lots of people that work at Google, very few who can

01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:00.520
help you out with these types of issues.

01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:01.880
And that's a problem.

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:05.840
You know, and they lost the guy who made Terraria as a result.

01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:10.240
So yeah, and Bobby Blackwell for the great point, Google used to have the motto, don't

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:11.240
be evil.

01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:13.760
They removed that motto about 10 years ago.

01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:15.280
So evil is okay.

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:22.920
Yeah, I remember that they did that because they were a lot of staff contesting some of

01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:25.960
the military contracts that they were taking or not taking.

01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:29.760
I don't remember what exactly, I think they denied taking some of those.

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:30.840
Yeah.

01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:34.960
So anyway, they lost Terraria.

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:38.520
I mean, I don't think there were a lot of people lining up to play Terraria on Stadia

01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:43.160
and that's no disrespect to Terraria, but I just think that game is on so many other

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.160
platforms.

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:46.280
You can very easily play it.

01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:48.040
It's on Android devices already.

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:49.040
It's on mobile.

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:50.040
It's on iOS.

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:57.080
I mean like, I would never like even like on like, say like a Chromebook or something

01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:01.360
like that, like let's just take the least powerful thing.

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:04.360
I think those could still run Terraria.

01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:08.960
Like there's literally no reason to play it on Stadia and a lot of these, like even Shantae

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:13.760
and stuff, there's no reason for me to buy it on that platform, like, cause that I don't

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:16.800
think you're going to need a very powerful PC to run that.

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:21.440
It just doesn't make sense as an offering on that platform.

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:25.520
Cyberpunk makes sense cause you need a beefy PC to be able to run that good.

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:30.080
And that's a good use case for it, but all this other stuff makes no sense.

01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:34.480
And the fact that they've pulled their own internal support so there's no exclusive content

01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:39.160
on those platforms, that shows me how much faith they have in that platform.

01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:40.160
Not very much.

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:44.280
And so I would not be wanting to throw my money behind it.

01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:48.840
Bobby in chat says a Chromecast Ultra is still cheaper than a low-end PC to run Terraria.

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:49.840
True.

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:54.120
And this could be about, you know, gaming in other places where the electronics are

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:59.640
harder to come by sometimes, but we could talk all sorts of ways about this, like who

01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:01.280
really wanted to play this or not.

01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:06.280
The point is it's not happening and it's because Google is not well run as a company in some

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:07.280
areas.

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:08.280
And Bobby also says...

01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:15.540
You can get an Xbox 360 for less than, I get better, Chromecast Ultra, that can run Terraria.

01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:19.960
And Bobby says a point I agree with in chat, as much shit as I give Apple, at least you

01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:22.280
can get in touch with an actual human there.

01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:25.640
So Apple is greater than Google ecosystem in that regard.

01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:31.400
And yes, and Google should probably take some notes that if they want to stop burning bridges

01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:36.760
with very important people by letting bots do that, they should take some notes here

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:41.560
and consider setting up some type of customer service and they would create some jobs in

01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:42.560
the process.

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:46.120
So, but I mean, it's all about pension pennies.

01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:51.560
And into what Bobby was saying about being available in areas where they may not have

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:53.340
access to that stuff.

01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:57.100
I don't think it's available in very many countries that begin with.

01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:59.640
So like, I don't know.

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:00.640
That's right.

01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:01.640
Stadia isn't available everywhere.

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:02.640
You're right.

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:03.640
You're right.

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:04.640
It's limited.

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:05.640
It doesn't have a point to me.

01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:06.640
I don't know.

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:10.520
Let's move on to a much simpler time when we weren't...

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.000
We didn't game in the cloud.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000
All right.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.280
We gamed on cartridge.

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:15.280
All right.

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:16.880
Or maybe a CD.

01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:17.880
I don't know.

01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:18.920
It's a classic game of the week.

01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:23.160
And dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:25.800
Hey, nerds, check this game out.

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:29.400
You don't need, you don't need to be playing those newfangled Terraria games, even though

01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:32.960
it's actually probably eligible for classic game of the week at this point, but I digress

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:38.520
because once a month dark soccer says, Oh, Oh, you get, you were getting comfortable

01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:40.280
with games every week, huh?

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:47.120
Well, in a 2021 twist, dark soccer decides to find a flag.

01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:54.480
I said, F W A G a fucking weird arcade, a flag and a fucking weird arcade game to highlight.

01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:59.160
I'm excited because we've only had one of these so far this year, but now we're in February

01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:01.640
and we get to have our second flag.

01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:08.800
Well, our second flag, if you're ready for it, um, comes from Namco.

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:13.400
So we're now getting into some of our, uh, popular vendors here.

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:18.360
Um, so there's a game called, um, it's call me, you'll say gets nice.

01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:19.640
It's call me.

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:26.440
Um, and the game is actually based off of Monzai, which is a kind of comedy routine.

01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:32.440
Um, and Monzai has existed in Japan since the Haeon period.

01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:37.560
Um, so, I mean, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just want to state for the podcast listeners,

01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:42.720
there is no audio on the video this week because this is like the, the, it's very hard to find

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:44.840
a video of some of these flags.

01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:48.440
So this is like some dude who has a ton of these games in a warehouse somewhere and he's

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:50.320
showing this off and he's doing a lot of chatting.

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:54.080
So just wanted to make sure you understand why you're not hearing this one, but Twitch

01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:55.080
can see it.

01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:59.840
Sorry, Jamie, but important to note, well, to put this into perspective, the Haeon period

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:07.920
was between like 794 to 1185, um, uh, AE.

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:13.800
So this is, this is a very, very old style of, uh, of, uh, comedy.

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:18.440
Um, and basically the way that I have to give an explanation about the comedy first.

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:25.000
So you have two performers called, um, Monzaishi, you have the straight guy, the tsukomi, and

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.920
you have a funny guy who's bokeh.

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:34.280
And they do these jokes back and forth really fast, including, uh, puns, uh, different kinds

01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:37.680
of double talk, uh, different type of verbal gags.

01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:45.840
And if you saw, um, uh, Kill Bill, I think it was volume, was it volume two or volume

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:49.080
one when she got the Hanzo sword, I think it was the first one.

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:54.520
Um, but that's kind of what Sony Chiba and the other guy, that's kind of the type of

01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:56.520
joking that they're doing with each other.

01:32:56.520 --> 01:33:04.240
Um, but at any rate, um, so a lot of the physical puns that go on with Monzai, they basically

01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:10.360
have taken some of that and, uh, put it into a game.

01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:17.680
So basically what this, this game is, is that you have to listen to, uh, the instructions

01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:19.480
in the game and you hit a color of text.

01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:24.360
So the text will have you hit a foot pedal to keep going to the next part of the act.

01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:29.520
And, um, and then there's like red text tells you to strike the bokeh, which is the dummy

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:30.720
that's in front of the game.

01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:34.560
So you basically have to beat up a dummy for comedy points.

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:39.560
Um, so you're graded on your timing and your accuracy.

01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:45.800
Um, and because this actually relies on, you know, different puns and Japanese verbal cues,

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:50.160
you have to be pretty damn fluent to play, to play.

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:51.160
Okay.

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:56.920
Um, so basically you are playing the tsukomi and the dummy is the bokeh.

01:33:56.920 --> 01:34:02.920
So you have to, you know, trade those jokes and hit the dummy at the right time sometimes

01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:06.960
by smacking him or punching him or kicking him in the ass or something.

01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:11.240
So it's a physical comedy game.

01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:17.520
Um, at any rate, the game came out in 2002 in Japan.

01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:21.640
It was developed by Metro, um, and published by Namco.

01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:26.020
Um, the website for the game is actually still up.

01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:31.460
It looks like it's though, like meant for like a cell phone or some kind of tablet,

01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:34.860
but, um, it's, it's there.

01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:43.660
I haven't seen, I only found very limited information about it, but, um, I w for, for,

01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:49.580
um, the people in the chat, I'm listing the, uh, uh, what's the word I'm thinking of the

01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:52.220
URL, but I'll read it aloud.

01:34:52.220 --> 01:35:00.860
That's a Metro doc, uh, sorry, Metro dash japan.com slash game slash log slash O Y I

01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:06.180
underscore H P that's O W a R a I slash index.html.

01:35:06.180 --> 01:35:09.540
All right.

01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:10.540
That's it.

01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:11.540
Yeah.

01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:16.980
I mean, it's just, I mean a little bit more, it does run on the Namco system 10 hardware.

01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:25.300
Um, it, uh, uses the PlayStation S P U, uh, for their sound chips.

01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:34.140
Um, it's two mega Ram to make video Ram 50, uh, 512 KB sound Ram.

01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:43.860
I mean, it's, it's older, definitely older technology, but the, the system is definitely,

01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:48.060
it's dated of course, I mean by today's standards, but it is still, I mean, pretty, pretty interesting

01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:49.060
that it exists.

01:35:49.060 --> 01:35:54.540
I, I had never seen or heard of this and I thought I've seen a lot of wacky stuff.

01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:58.300
I did not know there was a game where like the whole point is to just slap somebody basically.

01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:00.460
And that's what you do is slap the dummy.

01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:04.100
Like when the dummy says something, you're listening for visual clues.

01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:11.060
I mean, basically it's interactive comedy where you are one of the comedians.

01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:16.540
I mean, in its most base form.

01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:17.540
That's what it is.

01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:18.540
Yeah.

01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:23.140
And Bobby Blackwell says, I can't believe there's an entire game about pooping.

01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:24.140
Yep.

01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:25.900
People, people make games about weird stuff.

01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:29.140
All it's, it's, I guess one of the big rules of the internet.

01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:30.140
Yeah.

01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:37.580
Well at any rate, um, so that's what, what I have chosen for the game.

01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:41.380
Uh, uh, it's call me, you'll say gips.

01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:44.340
Nice call me.

01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:45.340
All right.

01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:46.340
There it is.

01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:50.320
Not just your classic game of the week, but your fucking weird arcade game of the month.

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:51.540
It is pretty fucking weird.

01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:52.540
I mean, it's interesting.

01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:56.980
It's, it's really novel concept, but yeah, there wouldn't be a way to make that work

01:36:56.980 --> 01:36:57.980
in America.

01:36:57.980 --> 01:36:59.060
How did you even think of that one?

01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:00.780
Did you see it somewhere once?

01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:07.060
Um, yeah, I had seen it, uh, a video about it a while back.

01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:08.820
And it just sort of stuck in my head.

01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:14.660
So I basically just looked up like Japanese comedy punching game.

01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:15.660
Okay.

01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:20.140
Um, and that's how I found the game because I couldn't remember the, the name of it, you

01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:21.140
know?

01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:22.140
Well, yeah.

01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:27.460
So, but Hey, you know, it's, it's definitely, definitely interesting.

01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:35.260
And most importantly, for the record, it's to call me T S U K K O M I when Romanized.

01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:36.260
All right.

01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:37.460
All right.

01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:38.460
Good pick.

01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:41.100
So it has nothing to do with scum, orange, right?

01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:47.140
I like, I like these ones, uh, where it's a game I have literally never heard of and

01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:48.380
I learned something a little bit.

01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:52.900
So I feel like these flags, the fucking weird arcade games, I feel like a lot of these are

01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:54.140
going to deliver on that.

01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:57.700
So looking forward to seeing what else you have in store.

01:37:57.700 --> 01:38:02.100
It's definitely to expand our horizons just a little bit.

01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:04.700
Sometimes when to places we don't need them to go.

01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:06.140
All right.

01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:07.140
Whether you want it to or not.

01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:08.140
Yeah.

01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:09.140
All right.

01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:13.180
Let's do some news, rapid fire style and travel around and check out some other headlines

01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:14.180
real quick.

01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:15.860
Uh, Loki, we'll start with you.

01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:16.860
Yeah.

01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:21.140
So we have a release date now for the new ratchet and clank game rip the part, which

01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:25.060
is going to be coming out in June on the 11th.

01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:30.140
And that was announced on the PlayStation blog, uh, by Insomniac games.

01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:31.140
So pretty awesome.

01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:36.020
And they said, in addition, the game will feature a few graphic modes as well.

01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:38.660
They're going to have a four K 30 FPS mode.

01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:43.420
And then of course one that's at 60 FPS running at lower resolution, that's kind of similar

01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:45.900
to what they had like Spiderman miles Morales.

01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:49.060
Uh, so yeah, that's pretty cool.

01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:53.060
And then, um, Minecraft dungeons is still doing incredibly well.

01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:59.220
They just hit 10 million players and it's expected to get some more DLC as well.

01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:05.180
Um, admittedly I have this game and have not played it yet, so I need to go and actually

01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:07.660
check it out because it's cute.

01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:11.180
It really invokes like an old Diablo kind of style.

01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:13.660
I enjoy, I need to go back and play it again.

01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:16.060
Um, but I enjoyed when I played a bit.

01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:17.060
It's cute.

01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:18.060
Yeah.

01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:20.180
So I'll have to definitely check it out.

01:39:20.180 --> 01:39:22.180
All right.

01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:27.420
Well let's travel on to some other headlines here, including a new classic games announced

01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:29.180
for Nintendo switch online.

01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:36.460
Uh, there will be some new additions for the super Nintendo and Nintendo, uh, uh, collections

01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:37.460
for the super Nintendo.

01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:42.580
We're going to get doomsday warrior prehistoric man, psycho dream.

01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:45.260
And for the NES, we get fire and ice.

01:39:45.260 --> 01:39:49.140
And those are all being added in just a few days, February 17th.

01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:53.120
And I got to say, we're really reaching here at this point.

01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:57.180
Like honestly, no guardian legend.

01:39:57.820 --> 01:39:58.820
What's that?

01:39:58.820 --> 01:39:59.820
Psycho dream.

01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:00.820
Isn't a bad game.

01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:01.820
Oh, I see.

01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:05.460
I was, I was going to say, if I remember, and I remember a little bit of prehistoric

01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:09.620
man, just, I think I played that once, but I don't remember it being that good.

01:40:09.620 --> 01:40:10.620
What did you tell?

01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:11.620
Tell a little more about psycho dream.

01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:12.620
Oh gosh.

01:40:12.620 --> 01:40:15.500
I haven't played this game in like for freaking ever.

01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:20.140
So I, I just remember that it was really, that it wasn't too bad.

01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:23.140
Um, and who knows, maybe I was going to do it for a classic game.

01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:27.940
Well, and what's interesting is that it's, um, it's also bearing the Famicom logo.

01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:30.100
So is this one of those games that was never actually.

01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:36.540
Yeah, it was Japan only there had been a, um, a, uh, uh, fan translation, of course,

01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:42.340
but basically you're playing as this character, either named Leo or Maria.

01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:47.900
And so Rio is like a, like a swordsman and she's like an angel with a whip.

01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:51.860
So um, so basically it's just like an, uh, an action game.

01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:57.220
Um, so you're, um, you just have to go through the game.

01:40:57.220 --> 01:40:58.940
You have a time limit to defeat enemies.

01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:03.020
Um, and it's set in like modern day Japan.

01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:08.140
So kind of, it's, it's got a weird story to it.

01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:12.780
I will admit that, that it's sort of like a virtual reality based story, but there's,

01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:14.340
it's, it's weird, but it's not bad.

01:41:14.380 --> 01:41:14.980
It's not bad.

01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:18.860
I mean, it wasn't a great game, but I thought it was fun.

01:41:18.900 --> 01:41:19.420
I mean,

01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:24.660
well, on your recommendation, I will check it out when these, uh, uh, hit the Nintendo

01:41:24.660 --> 01:41:29.900
switch online on February 17th, I will say fire and ice groundbreaking, you know, it's

01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:35.100
not like florals for spring, but it is, it is, it is an intro, you know, I do enjoy when

01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:38.580
we get the games that were never released here, kind of like the Mario P cross in the

01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:39.260
last update.

01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:42.220
So, you know, I'll, I'll, I'll check it out.

01:41:42.220 --> 01:41:42.660
Why not?

01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:44.060
I'm paying for Nintendo online anyway.

01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:48.540
I will say though, um, fire and ice, if you didn't already know, um, out there, um, is

01:41:48.540 --> 01:41:52.220
actually Solomon's key to basically, um, in fact, I believe that's what it was called

01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:52.740
in Japan.

01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:57.380
Um, actually, yes, because, uh, Japan also is getting their updates.

01:41:57.580 --> 01:42:01.260
So what's interesting, Japan is now getting Mario's super P cross, even though we already

01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:01.660
got it.

01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:03.860
They're also getting sire psycho dream.

01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:08.620
They're getting Solomon's key to which same thing as fire and ice, but the third one,

01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:12.020
instead of prehistoric man, they're getting shimagami tensei too.

01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:18.260
I want, yeah, well, you, it's very easy to, uh, make a Japanese account and

01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:19.300
download that client.

01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:22.620
And, uh, you don't have to pay like for a Japanese online.

01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:23.380
You don't have to do all you do.

01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:26.380
All you're doing is going in to get the client and then you play the client on your

01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:27.460
American account and it's fine.

01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:29.540
Except I don't read that well.

01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:33.220
Oh, and it's going to require, uh, gotcha.

01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:33.620
Gotcha.

01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:34.060
Yeah.

01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:38.220
Well, I am maybe a third through my kanji course.

01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:38.660
Got it.

01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:43.380
Well, you're going to have to sit there with your, uh, FAQ that's translated.

01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:43.740
All right.

01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:47.060
My, with my translation app that I can use my camera for.

01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:47.900
All right.

01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:53.300
Uh, and one other quick, uh, kind of story here has to do with the upcoming Mario

01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:55.180
brothers movie that we know is happening.

01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:59.300
And folks are wondering, will the definitive voice of Charles Martinet

01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:01.980
actually be voicing Mario in the movie?

01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:06.500
Well, um, Charles Martinet actually did a convention that was virtual this weekend

01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:08.540
called galaxy con live.

01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:12.180
Uh, and he was asked about his thoughts on the movie.

01:43:12.380 --> 01:43:17.580
And some of the comment was, if they invite me to play, I'll go in and play

01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:20.580
with great joy and happiness now.

01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:22.180
Who knows?

01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:23.820
Some wonder.

01:43:23.860 --> 01:43:24.220
Okay.

01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:28.940
Well, if they haven't asked him by now, that's not a great sign, but he could be

01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:29.500
faking it.

01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:33.980
However, I think the reality is I love Charles Martinet.

01:43:33.980 --> 01:43:34.500
I do.

01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:39.300
And I would love to see him actually be the voice of Mario, but I think since they

01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:45.740
plan to have Mario speaking fluent, fluent language, cause we know that the voice

01:43:45.740 --> 01:43:48.260
that Charles Martinet gives Mario, which is iconic.

01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:52.140
Again, I will not say anything bad about Charles Martinet, but he, he brings to the

01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:57.220
table the, you know, he, he does a lot of the emotional types of responses.

01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:02.540
You never see Mario going and I think the only thing he says, like he doesn't say

01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:05.300
anything like full phrases, right?

01:44:05.340 --> 01:44:08.500
Maybe like very, very short phrases in the movie.

01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:12.060
I imagine Mario is going to speak more than that and they will probably want a

01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:16.300
stunt cast and they're probably going to bring somebody a list from Hollywood to

01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:16.860
voice it.

01:44:16.860 --> 01:44:19.220
And I think we need to be prepared for that reality.

01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:23.660
Now, the nice thing would be to allow Charles Martinet to still voice a

01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:25.500
significant character in the game.

01:44:25.780 --> 01:44:32.220
Like Wario, I think would be let him voice Wario, but I don't, I don't see it.

01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:34.180
Is it animated or live action?

01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:34.860
It's animated.

01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:35.500
Animated.

01:44:35.820 --> 01:44:36.140
Okay.

01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:36.980
I was going to say.

01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:41.460
The same studio that did like the minions and Despicable Me and that stuff are doing

01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:42.060
the Mario movie.

01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:42.420
Yeah.

01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:45.220
So, um, you know what I want?

01:44:45.340 --> 01:44:45.660
What?

01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:49.580
I think it would be hilarious if John Leguizamo did a voice.

01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:50.340
Me too.

01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:51.100
I think that's funny.

01:44:51.140 --> 01:44:51.380
Yeah.

01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:53.100
Yeah.

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:54.740
No, have him be Luigi.

01:44:55.540 --> 01:44:55.940
Why not?

01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:59.140
SDG100 Matt says he was in the other live action movie, right?

01:44:59.260 --> 01:44:59.740
Yeah.

01:45:00.020 --> 01:45:02.020
SDG100 Matt says Papa Mario.

01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:02.260
Yeah.

01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:02.580
Why not?

01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:05.940
Why not have like a grandpa Mario that's in it and Charles Martinet gets to play that

01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:06.220
part.

01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:11.260
I hope they, they do something nice for him because you know, he is part of what

01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:14.660
brings Mario's iconicness to the table.

01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:19.860
So anyway, I'm making this rapid fire news segment way too long, but I just had to get

01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:20.220
that out.

01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:22.060
So let me move on to Dark Sakura.

01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:28.900
Well, for anyone who wants to follow in Loki's footsteps, making a game, there is

01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:31.700
a unity training bundle that's out.

01:45:31.780 --> 01:45:35.780
Um, it is $44.99 right now.

01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:41.060
Um, for the, uh, 2021 premium unity game developer certification bundle.

01:45:41.340 --> 01:45:43.820
That's 98% off.

01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:46.820
So, I mean, this shit ain't cheap.

01:45:47.940 --> 01:45:55.380
So, um, it's, I mean, basically has a lot of different tools, tutorials, um, walks

01:45:55.380 --> 01:45:58.300
you through, uh, some basic creation.

01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:03.700
Um, and it's actually, uh, led with training on both unity and blender by

01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:09.700
John Bura, um, who is a developer, many games that came out on the app store are

01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:14.980
doing really good, um, also owns mammoth interactive, uh, worked with Nintendo.

01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:21.060
So, I mean, so basically you're getting a $3,000 gaming suite for like less than 50

01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:21.460
bucks.

01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:22.900
I'm actually thinking about it.

01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:25.780
They grossly overpriced those though.

01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:31.020
I mean, it's just like Udemy where they say, Oh yeah, this is a $200 course, but

01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:32.380
it's never over $20.

01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:36.020
Um, just be careful with a lot of those courses, especially when they're bundled

01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:39.100
like that, because a lot of that information's really old.

01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:41.700
And especially with unity, it updates all the time.

01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:45.940
Uh, honestly, like there's a lot of free court.

01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:47.420
There's a lot of free material out there.

01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:53.060
Unity has like courses in everything, like the entire suite of stuff for free.

01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:57.660
Uh, Udemy has some courses that are a little bit smaller and those are like,

01:46:57.700 --> 01:46:59.740
you know, just keep watching it.

01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:02.340
Usually they go down to like $10.

01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:04.900
You know, it's really cheap right now on humble bundle.

01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:10.780
They have a unity, uh, learn unity course thing that you can get a bundle of those

01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:14.380
for, and some assets for like, you know, really cheap as well.

01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:15.860
So just keep an eye on that.

01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:20.500
Um, you know, like a lot of these I've seen these before, like with, uh, was it,

01:47:20.540 --> 01:47:26.940
there's a lot through Zenva, which a lot of that stuff is offered on, um, Humble

01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:31.180
bundle every like month or so they have like a bunch of these courses.

01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:32.900
So just be careful.

01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:35.940
Uh, you know, just like looking at what's included with that.

01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:39.260
Cause like, for example, they have construct three tutorials in here.

01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:40.420
Well, this is a unity course.

01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:43.740
Construct three is not going to really help you out with that stuff.

01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:47.780
Um, some of it might be helpful, but like if you're looking for more specific

01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:51.900
things, I'd definitely start with the unity, uh, tutorials themselves,

01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:52.940
or just go on YouTube.

01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:54.860
There's so many out there.

01:47:54.860 --> 01:48:00.460
There's, uh, you know, uh, Braxis, which is not, um, publishing anymore,

01:48:00.460 --> 01:48:02.380
but he had a ton of stuff on there.

01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:05.340
Kenny's got a lot of like free assets out there.

01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:07.580
There's so much content.

01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:10.060
That's free that you don't have to even pay for.

01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:11.580
It ends up being a lot better.

01:48:11.620 --> 01:48:15.900
Like sometimes I've done some of the, uh, some of the Udemy courses and they've

01:48:15.900 --> 01:48:18.940
helped out with like learning specific things.

01:48:18.980 --> 01:48:22.820
Um, but a lot of it tends, you have to be careful cause a lot of it tends to be

01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:25.300
very dated by the time you get in there.

01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:28.860
Um, and since they don't specifically rapid fire,

01:48:29.860 --> 01:48:31.020
yes, please.

01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:32.900
Cause I have another story to do.

01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:34.220
All right, fine.

01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:36.620
I'm not trying to be rude, but we get it.

01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:40.020
Go ahead, Jamie.

01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:40.340
Sorry.

01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:46.020
Um, at any rate, um, so for more freebies, uh, in this case actually,

01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:51.060
um, uh, Assassin's Creed, uh, Chronicles China is free.

01:48:51.540 --> 01:48:57.340
So you can get that from, um, the Ubisoft website, uh, through actually tomorrow.

01:48:57.380 --> 01:48:59.020
So if you're going to get it, get it now.

01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:04.100
Um, but I think you have to have an account set up for Ubisoft connect.

01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:08.220
So, but Hey, I mean, let's hear it for a free game that you get to keep forever.

01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:09.260
Yeah.

01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:10.060
Get on that.

01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:11.660
If, uh, yeah, you're right.

01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:15.020
By the time most podcast folks hear this, unfortunately it's probably gone unless

01:49:15.020 --> 01:49:16.260
you listen Monday morning maybe.

01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:17.580
So, yeah.

01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:18.140
All right.

01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:22.740
Well, and I'm, I'm, uh, I'm actually, cause I'd forgotten to do this earlier.

01:49:22.740 --> 01:49:23.740
I'm going to get it right now.

01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:27.220
Uh, pixel pockets and chat says, what was that again?

01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:29.460
It's Assassin's Creed, China.

01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:32.780
It's Chronicles, Assassin's Creed Chronicles, Chronicles China.

01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:33.220
Yes.

01:49:34.820 --> 01:49:35.220
All right.

01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:40.220
Let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out real

01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:42.980
soon as we do some world release dates.

01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:44.580
And Loki, we'll start with you in the US.

01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:45.700
Yep.

01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:51.580
So we've got a few things coming out this week, starting off with, uh, Azure

01:49:51.580 --> 01:49:56.100
lane cross wave, uh, that's coming out on Nintendo switch.

01:49:56.140 --> 01:50:00.340
Uh, we've got fallen Legion, revenants on into the switch and PlayStation four.

01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:03.660
Speed limit on PlayStation four.

01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:08.820
Uh, we have SNK versus Capcom, the match of the millennium on Nintendo switch.

01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:13.340
Uh, we have also speed limit coming out on PC as well.

01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:21.500
The 25th ward, a silver case on Nintendo switch, uh, anodyne to return to dust on

01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:26.500
Nintendo switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series X.

01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:31.900
Um, speed limit also coming out throughout the week, I guess, on multiple systems

01:50:32.260 --> 01:50:34.460
on Nintendo switch on that as well.

01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:40.540
Um, also have looks like the silver case coming out on the Nintendo switch.

01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:46.020
I think that's different from the 25th ward, the silver case, uh, void terrarium

01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:53.460
plus on PlayStation five and Thomas was alone on Nintendo switch and that's it.

01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:55.140
All right.

01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:59.020
Traveling to Japan and looking at some of the releases there, uh, a little slower

01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:01.620
this week, but there's still a couple of things to mention, including on the

01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:06.980
Nintendo switch, a game called the silver 24, 25 is coming out on the Nintendo

01:51:06.980 --> 01:51:10.020
switch on the PlayStation five this week.

01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:14.020
That void terrarium plus that Loki just mentioned for the U S is also out in

01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:18.620
Japan this week and going to the PlayStation four kingdom come deliverance

01:51:18.620 --> 01:51:22.540
gets like a Royal edition, uh, as, when it gets a price reduction as well.

01:51:22.740 --> 01:51:24.460
So you have that to check out.

01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:26.500
Um, that's, that's really it.

01:51:26.660 --> 01:51:28.340
Otherwise it's pretty quiet week in Japan.

01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:29.220
How about the UK?

01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:29.740
Dark Sakura?

01:51:30.740 --> 01:51:33.740
Um, nothing, literally nothing.

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:34.340
All right.

01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:35.060
It happens.

01:51:35.340 --> 01:51:37.540
It's still first quarter is usually a little slow.

01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:41.060
You might have a couple of big titles, but it won't really start to ramp up

01:51:41.060 --> 01:51:43.060
until like, you know, the new finance.

01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:43.620
I don't know.

01:51:43.620 --> 01:51:46.020
You get some titles that try to get in there right at the end of the

01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:48.700
fiscal year and then, uh, some that get in there at the beginning.

01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:52.980
So it just kind of depends, but it's going to be some slow weeks sometimes.

01:51:53.420 --> 01:51:53.980
All right.

01:51:53.980 --> 01:51:57.100
We still have some new story stories for you guys.

01:51:57.100 --> 01:52:00.940
And then we'll get to the round table, which include a couple of emails tonight.

01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:04.260
So let's get to some Hollywood news, right?

01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:04.620
Loki.

01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:06.140
Yeah.

01:52:06.140 --> 01:52:11.460
So we were just talking about, you know, voice cast decisions made by studios

01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:15.060
that may not necessarily jive with the video games.

01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:20.100
So, um, some of the casts that we have now, we're learning about more folks,

01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:23.500
um, cast for the new Borderlands movie.

01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:29.140
So starting off, we have Jack Black as Claptrap.

01:52:30.260 --> 01:52:31.340
I can see that.

01:52:31.380 --> 01:52:32.820
I think that's fine.

01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:38.300
Um, also we have Jamie Lee Curtis now playing Dr.

01:52:38.300 --> 01:52:41.580
Tanis, I could definitely see that as well.

01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:43.660
So I think those are okay.

01:52:44.140 --> 01:52:48.660
Um, I, I do want to, I really want to see this movie.

01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:52.540
So, um, looking forward to that.

01:52:52.580 --> 01:52:55.140
Um, I think, I think Jack Black will be pretty good.

01:52:55.340 --> 01:52:56.100
I get it though.

01:52:56.100 --> 01:53:00.780
Claptrap has a kind of an iconic voice, but I think he'll do it justice.

01:53:01.780 --> 01:53:02.020
Yeah.

01:53:02.020 --> 01:53:02.580
I was kind of curious.

01:53:02.620 --> 01:53:05.500
You're, you're the big Borderlands fan of the three of us Loki.

01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:07.700
So I was kind of curious your sort of take on this.

01:53:07.700 --> 01:53:09.020
I mean, I love Jamie Lee Curtis.

01:53:09.220 --> 01:53:12.580
I don't particularly care for Kevin Hart after what he pulled a couple of years

01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:15.420
ago, but Jamie Lee Curtis is such an icon.

01:53:15.420 --> 01:53:16.980
It kind of balances out at least.

01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:21.940
Well, Kevin Hart out of all of those as the least kind of appropriate, I think

01:53:21.940 --> 01:53:28.020
for the cast, cause like the, the main character Roland, isn't so, he's more of

01:53:28.020 --> 01:53:31.980
a serious character, not like Kevin Hart at all.

01:53:31.980 --> 01:53:34.180
Like I really don't think that's cast well.

01:53:34.180 --> 01:53:36.820
But funny guys go serious sometimes though.

01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:41.460
Like, you know, I'll give that a shot that caught that comedic actors make

01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:43.060
some of the best dramatic actors.

01:53:43.180 --> 01:53:46.620
They're like Ronald Williams when he was around Tom Hanks.

01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:50.740
And I guess it depends on when, when in the timeline we're talking about here.

01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:54.740
Cause if like, if this is like around like the first game, he like Roland,

01:53:54.740 --> 01:53:58.740
you know, kind of, he goes through like a character, a lot of character

01:53:58.740 --> 01:54:03.180
development, um, between games because of, you know, certain people dying.

01:54:03.580 --> 01:54:06.780
Um, so I don't know.

01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:07.900
We'll see.

01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:10.940
I don't, I don't know.

01:54:10.940 --> 01:54:12.260
I'm not a huge fan of Kevin Hart.

01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:16.860
So, but there's a lot of other people in the movie where I'm kind of like, you

01:54:16.860 --> 01:54:21.460
know, like again, Jamie Lee Curtis kind of an icon, so, but I'm, I'm not really

01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:24.020
like huge on Borderlands lore.

01:54:24.020 --> 01:54:25.100
So I don't know.

01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:26.540
We'll see right now.

01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:31.380
I'm kind of like, I'll, I'll rent it when it comes to comes to home.

01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:36.060
I mean, it's, it's hard to imagine the theater again, uh, anytime soon anyway,

01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:40.420
but also this movie hasn't shot a single frame, so it will also not be out anytime

01:54:40.420 --> 01:54:40.700
soon.

01:54:42.900 --> 01:54:43.260
Right.

01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:44.980
All right.

01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:47.220
Um, wasn't there another one too?

01:54:47.260 --> 01:54:48.300
Another casting this week?

01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:48.740
Oh, yes.

01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:49.020
Yes.

01:54:49.020 --> 01:54:49.420
Sorry.

01:54:49.420 --> 01:54:49.700
Yes.

01:54:49.740 --> 01:54:54.580
Outside of Borderlands, uh, for HBO's Last of Us series, uh, we have Pedro

01:54:54.580 --> 01:55:00.700
Pascal now in the role of Joe, um, Joel, I should say so that should be pretty good.

01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:05.540
I mean, he's been great in Mandalorian, so I'm looking forward to that.

01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:06.780
I'm sure he'll be great.

01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:09.300
Did they say who they had as Ellie?

01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:10.540
They did.

01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:19.020
Um, so just for game of Thrones, I think, uh, yeah, I don't remember who's

01:55:19.020 --> 01:55:21.300
going to portray Ellie, unfortunately.

01:55:21.340 --> 01:55:24.740
Um, chat, you're going to have to help us out here at twitch.tv slash

01:55:25.420 --> 01:55:26.860
remember who it was.

01:55:27.180 --> 01:55:27.420
Hmm.

01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:30.860
Uh, Bella Ramsey.

01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:31.740
That sounds right.

01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:33.140
Yeah.

01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:34.900
She played a Leanna Mormont.

01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:38.980
Ah, yeah, actually, poor Leanna Mormont.

01:55:39.020 --> 01:55:39.580
Oh my God.

01:55:40.180 --> 01:55:42.340
So she's going to play Ellie.

01:55:42.980 --> 01:55:44.860
Um, cool.

01:55:44.940 --> 01:55:46.980
I mean, I'm sure that'll be great.

01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:55.940
I, I haven't played the game, so I don't, yeah, I, it'll be interesting.

01:55:56.900 --> 01:55:59.940
Someone will need to screen that for me to let me know how violent it is.

01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:04.340
I'm going to be able to watch probably incredibly violent.

01:56:04.780 --> 01:56:09.340
I mean, it's the last of us be ready to just, you know, watch death and cry.

01:56:09.860 --> 01:56:10.580
No, thanks.

01:56:11.020 --> 01:56:11.500
All right.

01:56:12.580 --> 01:56:13.540
Can I watch a story?

01:56:13.620 --> 01:56:14.540
Can I watch a comedy?

01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:15.340
All right.

01:56:15.580 --> 01:56:20.780
Uh, moving on, let's talk about, uh, steam launching in another new country.

01:56:20.780 --> 01:56:23.540
And this is a pretty big deal because that country is China.

01:56:23.540 --> 01:56:27.380
So steam is launching in China, uh, or has launched, I should say they've

01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:28.860
officially had their launch in China.

01:56:29.180 --> 01:56:32.660
Uh, and it's, you know, one of the, the, the world's biggest

01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:33.900
gaming market, actually.

01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:37.340
We often forget, um, because, uh, you know, where our show is based and where

01:56:37.340 --> 01:56:40.860
most people are checking out our show from that there is a whole lot of people

01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:43.100
in China and a lot of them play video games.

01:56:43.340 --> 01:56:48.820
So steam is finally there now because, you know, it's a little bit different

01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:53.980
in China and there is, you know, a lot of, um, censorship basically.

01:56:53.980 --> 01:56:56.780
And, you know, a lot of things that you're not allowed to do in video games.

01:56:57.060 --> 01:57:00.820
Um, Valve has done this through a local publisher.

01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:04.540
So perfect world who you might know from some of their MMOs is the one

01:57:04.540 --> 01:57:07.180
that they've kind of teamed up with in order to make this happen.

01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:11.500
Only 41 titles are available in steam China right now.

01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:12.780
I'm assuming pixel poops.

01:57:12.780 --> 01:57:14.300
Number two is not one of them.

01:57:14.580 --> 01:57:16.500
And probably not planned to be out there anytime soon.

01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:20.900
What are their thoughts on, on large amounts of feces in video games?

01:57:20.980 --> 01:57:23.140
Um, appropriate for challenge.

01:57:23.220 --> 01:57:26.180
I can tell you the zombies and there's not a spoiler alert, but the

01:57:26.180 --> 01:57:29.020
zombies and the zombie level would be, and it's just no zombies.

01:57:29.020 --> 01:57:29.900
There's ghosts.

01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:31.780
There's no zombies in the game.

01:57:32.300 --> 01:57:35.900
I can't remember what the rule is on ghosts, but I know there was a problem

01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:37.980
with the undead in world of Warcraft.

01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:40.340
So they changed it to something else.

01:57:40.380 --> 01:57:44.060
Um, that was similar, but, uh, it didn't have like the flesh

01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:44.980
falling off like ghosts.

01:57:44.980 --> 01:57:46.260
It's a cartoon ghost.

01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:47.020
I don't think.

01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:51.060
What, what do I have to do to get my game approved for China?

01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:53.340
Uh, let us know.

01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:55.140
Okay.

01:57:55.380 --> 01:57:58.980
But yeah, steam says that every game on the service is vetted for

01:57:58.980 --> 01:58:00.660
approval by the country's government.

01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:03.460
And once it gets the green light, it gets an ISBN number that's

01:58:03.460 --> 01:58:06.980
delayed or excuse me, displayed on the steam product page.

01:58:07.060 --> 01:58:11.780
So kind of interesting, but yeah, I mean, you know, uh, again, even

01:58:11.780 --> 01:58:13.900
though that might not be something right in front of our face here in

01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:17.300
the States, or even those you in places like Canada, Mexico, Europe,

01:58:17.540 --> 01:58:20.380
Australia, wherever it is, you are in the world listening to this show,

01:58:20.700 --> 01:58:22.860
um, steam launching in China.

01:58:22.860 --> 01:58:25.340
That's still, that's a huge market and a huge deal.

01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:29.500
Um, but not, not, not nearly the same amount of games are

01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:30.380
going to be available on it.

01:58:30.420 --> 01:58:31.420
I bet perfect worlds.

01:58:31.420 --> 01:58:35.380
MMOs are on it though, since, you know, they're the partner.

01:58:35.780 --> 01:58:37.980
All right, let's move on dark soccer.

01:58:38.980 --> 01:58:45.660
Well, um, there is, uh, uh, a book coming out that I'm

01:58:45.660 --> 01:58:47.300
actually kind of excited about.

01:58:47.660 --> 01:58:50.540
Um, we all know Howard and Howard Phillips were, he was a big

01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:52.260
spokesperson for Nintendo, you know,

01:58:53.780 --> 01:58:54.540
yeah, yeah.

01:58:54.700 --> 01:58:58.060
Well, um, that was Nestor.

01:58:59.620 --> 01:59:01.620
They should have a cameo in the Mario movie.

01:59:02.540 --> 01:59:03.020
You're right.

01:59:03.020 --> 01:59:03.660
Howard and Nestor.

01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:04.140
I'm sorry.

01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:05.220
I, I messed it up.

01:59:05.220 --> 01:59:05.500
Yeah.

01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:10.500
Although the, uh, it looks like that the cover for it has like

01:59:10.660 --> 01:59:13.100
kind of someone who looks like Nestor in the background, following

01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:19.380
them around, but, um, basically it's going to be the inside stories

01:59:19.380 --> 01:59:22.620
from Nintendo's history called game master classified.

01:59:23.340 --> 01:59:25.780
So, um, that'd be pretty interesting.

01:59:25.780 --> 01:59:28.060
Um, uh, it was a successful Kickstarter.

01:59:28.260 --> 01:59:31.140
I already reached its goal, but you can, uh, throw in some cash

01:59:31.140 --> 01:59:32.620
yourself if you want your copy.

01:59:32.900 --> 01:59:34.420
So cool.

01:59:35.540 --> 01:59:40.060
I'm kind of curious what sorts of insights, especially on the, uh, you

01:59:40.060 --> 01:59:43.780
know, Nintendo versus Sega years and some of that interesting insight on some of

01:59:43.780 --> 01:59:49.540
those meetings that probably happened there, so, all right, um, act deaf to

01:59:49.540 --> 01:59:52.820
saying Matthew Taranto, I hope I said that last name, right.

01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:53.860
Is helping with that book.

01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:56.820
If I recall correctly, what else might we know him from?

01:59:57.340 --> 02:00:00.100
Um, SSG100 Matt says, uh, Howard and Nestor should be a

02:00:00.100 --> 02:00:01.580
shop or something in the movie.

02:00:01.580 --> 02:00:02.220
Well, let's hope.

02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:07.300
I think a cameo would be very cute, but the problem is like in that

02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:12.100
comic, you know, Howard and Nestor Howard had Howard Phillips likeness.

02:00:12.340 --> 02:00:16.500
And so that probably is something they would have to go back to Howard Phillips

02:00:16.500 --> 02:00:20.740
to get, and if he's about to write, tell all books about Nintendo, I'm not sure

02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:22.580
they have that type of relationship right now.

02:00:22.580 --> 02:00:23.100
I don't know.

02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:23.380
I don't know.

02:00:23.380 --> 02:00:24.100
It's hard to say.

02:00:24.500 --> 02:00:30.220
So, um, act deaf to saying the, uh, person helping with the book, uh, brawl in the

02:00:30.220 --> 02:00:35.220
family comics and tadpole treble, which was on switch not too long ago.

02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:35.820
Interesting.

02:00:36.260 --> 02:00:36.580
All right.

02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:37.260
Cool.

02:00:38.580 --> 02:00:38.860
All right.

02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:42.020
Just a few more stories and then we'll get to the mailbag and your

02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:43.260
other questions in our chat.

02:00:43.340 --> 02:00:43.780
Loki.

02:00:44.900 --> 02:00:45.300
Yes.

02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:50.180
So we had hackers bringing Android to the Nintendo switch and now they're bringing

02:00:50.180 --> 02:00:54.900
a newer version of Android to the Nintendo switch, so now we have, um,

02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:57.740
Android 10 coming to the switch.

02:00:58.060 --> 02:01:01.620
Apparently it's a little bit faster and more responsive.

02:01:01.660 --> 02:01:08.460
And they said that they're using a, um, an Android TV build to port that over.

02:01:08.820 --> 02:01:09.700
Uh, cool.

02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:13.220
I have the tools to do that.

02:01:13.580 --> 02:01:16.980
I just probably will never do that cause I don't want to brick my switch.

02:01:17.020 --> 02:01:21.700
So I was going to ask if that's something you've played around with at all, but

02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:26.460
I just didn't really, I don't know.

02:01:26.460 --> 02:01:28.940
I just, I kind of lost interest in it pretty fast.

02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:32.700
Like I, once I saw what you could do with, I was like, eh, there's a good

02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:35.420
chance they'll get it banned and I just don't want to do that.

02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:37.780
So I said, forget it.

02:01:37.820 --> 02:01:41.420
I don't need to put like, you know, NES games on there or something.

02:01:41.940 --> 02:01:44.860
But for those that like to live dangerously, have fun.

02:01:45.300 --> 02:01:48.260
And so that if you have a second one that you want to keep offline and

02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:53.620
just use it specifically for hacking stuff and by all means, go right ahead.

02:01:54.220 --> 02:01:57.980
That would be a fun way to, uh, I like the idea of trying to get the emulator

02:01:57.980 --> 02:02:01.780
running to play pixel poops, number two on the switch switch version confirmed.

02:02:03.580 --> 02:02:05.180
I still need to work out.

02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:09.540
There is a way to supposedly that you can, uh, change the, the format to

02:02:09.540 --> 02:02:13.700
a mapper too, which will allow you to put it on the, uh, NES classic

02:02:13.780 --> 02:02:15.540
edition and the SNES classic.

02:02:15.860 --> 02:02:20.860
So I need to try doing that as well to try to, um, see if I can get it in,

02:02:20.940 --> 02:02:22.860
in there, um, that'd be pretty cool.

02:02:23.620 --> 02:02:23.980
All right.

02:02:24.940 --> 02:02:28.380
Well, uh, we've had a bit of news tonight where it's like, well,

02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:29.900
I didn't see that one coming.

02:02:29.980 --> 02:02:32.980
And I think this last official story we have slotted for the night

02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:35.140
probably fits into that category.

02:02:35.420 --> 02:02:38.820
You know, Pokemon is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, and

02:02:38.820 --> 02:02:42.820
they're doing a lot of, you know, team ups and things, uh, and, uh, special

02:02:42.820 --> 02:02:45.540
events to celebrate their 25th anniversary.

02:02:45.820 --> 02:02:50.260
Well, I can say I definitely didn't see this one coming on February 27th.

02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:54.100
The Pokemon company will have a virtual concert that will be

02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:56.340
headlined by Post Malone.

02:02:56.740 --> 02:02:57.260
That's right.

02:02:57.460 --> 02:03:01.540
Post Malone is headlining the Pokemon 25th anniversary concert.

02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:05.620
Apparently there will be some type of contribution from Katy Perry here as well.

02:03:05.620 --> 02:03:08.260
I don't know if that just means a video of her singing in her house.

02:03:08.260 --> 02:03:08.780
I don't know.

02:03:09.140 --> 02:03:13.140
Um, but you can find this whole event at seven o'clock Eastern.

02:03:13.140 --> 02:03:17.340
That would be four o'clock Pacific again on February 27th on YouTube and

02:03:17.340 --> 02:03:19.660
their official Twitch channel, which is just Pokemon.

02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:23.860
This is just the main Pokemon channel and they are saying watch until the

02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:28.620
end because we will have some more Pokemon 25 music announcements then.

02:03:28.860 --> 02:03:33.860
They're not saying game announcements, so cool your hype for gen four remakes.

02:03:34.460 --> 02:03:39.620
And if that's coming or not this year, um, anyhow, I think that's interesting.

02:03:39.620 --> 02:03:40.140
That's happened.

02:03:40.380 --> 02:03:44.180
This story also brings up something that, um, I was texting with Jason

02:03:44.180 --> 02:03:46.860
about earlier, and that is the whole, I don't know if you guys know about this,

02:03:46.900 --> 02:03:51.660
but did you know that there is a Pokemon and McDonald's promotion going on right now?

02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:55.300
Um, and what's happening right now is that there are certain Pokemon cards

02:03:55.300 --> 02:04:00.140
that are exclusive to McDonald's right now, and you have to get them in Happy Meals.

02:04:00.340 --> 02:04:04.620
And yes, I talked to Shane about it and he bought a few Happy, he didn't buy a ton,

02:04:04.860 --> 02:04:08.940
but I guess some scalpers and some YouTubers are buying a shit ton of Happy

02:04:08.940 --> 02:04:12.180
Meals to sell the cards because that's the only way you can get them.

02:04:12.380 --> 02:04:16.380
But I talked to Shane and he only wants Oshawa basically.

02:04:16.420 --> 02:04:19.700
And I guess there's two versions and he got them both after like four or five

02:04:19.700 --> 02:04:20.900
Happy Meals, so he's fine.

02:04:21.300 --> 02:04:22.740
Uh, and he went multiple times.

02:04:23.140 --> 02:04:27.140
Uh, but I guess the whole trading card thing and the Happy Meal thing is like,

02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:27.740
what is this?

02:04:27.740 --> 02:04:30.140
Is this, is this Beaty Babies or whatever?

02:04:30.540 --> 02:04:32.140
Oh, Shane is in chat.

02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:33.020
How fortunate.

02:04:33.540 --> 02:04:35.620
Oh, he's saying you don't need Happy Meals.

02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:37.300
I never bought a Happy Meal.

02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:40.820
Oh, I thought you had to buy, that's why they were limiting how many you could buy.

02:04:41.660 --> 02:04:43.020
I thought that was the whole thing.

02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:44.580
Do they not come free?

02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:47.540
Are you able to just buy them separately outside the Happy Meal?

02:04:48.020 --> 02:04:51.420
Uh, Shane is saying it depends on what store, what they do.

02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:53.060
So, hmm.

02:04:54.300 --> 02:04:56.660
Act F is saying you now have to buy a Happy Meal.

02:04:56.660 --> 02:04:58.500
Again, it probably just depends on the store.

02:04:58.860 --> 02:05:02.020
Like if the person selling it to you doesn't give a crap, then you can, that's

02:05:02.020 --> 02:05:05.100
probably how some of these scalpers and YouTubers are buying hundreds of them.

02:05:05.460 --> 02:05:09.140
So, cause you know, there's so many McDonald's everywhere.

02:05:09.340 --> 02:05:11.700
It's probably hard to do anything consistently with that.

02:05:12.020 --> 02:05:13.980
So there you go.

02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:15.220
All right.

02:05:16.260 --> 02:05:17.380
Oh, is that Midna?

02:05:18.820 --> 02:05:19.540
Hi kitty.

02:05:21.420 --> 02:05:27.580
Oh, I wish we could get, um, Smush to come on stream sometimes, but I will give a

02:05:27.580 --> 02:05:29.980
cheap plug cause I have to do this at some point.

02:05:30.260 --> 02:05:34.380
So I talk about my husband, Alan, a lot on this show and I've been saying for like

02:05:34.380 --> 02:05:39.540
the past couple of years, he should really get into streaming and he has, he did his

02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:41.620
first live stream last night.

02:05:41.940 --> 02:05:46.820
He played, um, uh, Dead by Daylight and Dark Souls, a little bit of that.

02:05:46.980 --> 02:05:51.300
And he did get Smush to come cause Smush always sits by him in the office.

02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:53.140
So he did get Smush to come on cam.

02:05:53.340 --> 02:05:57.660
So anyway, I have to, um, you know, be a good husband and tell you all to go

02:05:57.660 --> 02:05:59.300
follow him at Alan Alchemy.

02:05:59.580 --> 02:06:03.580
So, and for those watching live on Twitch, he might be doing something tonight.

02:06:03.580 --> 02:06:04.380
So stay tuned.

02:06:04.740 --> 02:06:07.540
Um, but, uh, yeah, so I have to give him a shout out.

02:06:08.540 --> 02:06:12.660
I think she got stuck in here when I locked the door to lock her out.

02:06:12.660 --> 02:06:14.020
She's just been in here quietly.

02:06:14.420 --> 02:06:15.860
Oh, Oh, how funny.

02:06:15.860 --> 02:06:17.700
So you accidentally shut her in and said, shut her out.

02:06:17.860 --> 02:06:19.060
We did that to Smush once.

02:06:19.060 --> 02:06:21.620
Cause usually we don't let him in the bedroom at night cause he likes to jump

02:06:21.620 --> 02:06:22.780
on the windowsill at 3 AM.

02:06:23.180 --> 02:06:28.820
Um, but you know, one time I think we shut the door and he was hiding under the bed.

02:06:28.980 --> 02:06:32.660
And so instead we got woken up with that at 3 AM.

02:06:33.380 --> 02:06:33.900
All right.

02:06:34.140 --> 02:06:34.580
All right.

02:06:35.060 --> 02:06:39.500
Well, I hate to interrupt Midna time, but this is the part of the show where we go

02:06:39.500 --> 02:06:43.740
to our mailbag because every week you can send us emails, participate

02:06:43.780 --> 02:06:48.020
at orange lounge, radio.com, uh, is the place to send us emails.

02:06:48.060 --> 02:06:50.180
And we re like to read some on air.

02:06:50.620 --> 02:06:53.420
Um, let me read this quick comment from chat.

02:06:53.420 --> 02:06:56.820
W O four in chat says option to donate a happy meal.

02:06:57.020 --> 02:07:00.680
You know, I have heard with the Pokemon thing that there were some like

02:07:00.680 --> 02:07:04.320
YouTubers that were doing that, where they bought the happy meal with the cards.

02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:09.520
And then they donated the happy meals to like a, uh, like a homeless foundation

02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:12.440
or charity or something like that, uh, providing meals.

02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:14.960
So I thought, I thought that wasn't a nice way to do it.

02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:18.120
I guess if you're going to hoard those Pokemon cards, that's a

02:07:18.120 --> 02:07:19.840
nice way to give back, I suppose.

02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:21.720
So, all right.

02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:23.920
Anyway, if Jamie's ready, we'll go to emails.

02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:25.280
I'm just joking.

02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:25.800
My pussy.

02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:29.200
Please don't clip that.

02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:29.640
All right.

02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:32.680
Hi, OLR.

02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:35.360
I just built a PC for the first time this weekend.

02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:36.680
I have a simple question.

02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:40.080
What PC exclusive games would you recommend to be played on it?

02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:40.560
Thanks.

02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:41.440
Pixel pockets.

02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:48.120
Um, I don't really know of any exclusives, but, um, mass effect, all of them.

02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:50.360
Dragon age hush.

02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:52.840
You're the one who got yourself stuck in here.

02:07:52.840 --> 02:07:53.640
You're going to be quiet.

02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:54.800
Sorry.

02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:56.520
I'm disciplining my child.

02:07:56.520 --> 02:07:58.080
Um, satisfactory.

02:08:00.120 --> 02:08:01.440
Oh, that is, that is a game.

02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:03.080
It is a game.

02:08:05.160 --> 02:08:07.960
It's a factory building FPS.

02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:11.800
Well, Minecraft is technically not, you know, exclusive Java

02:08:11.800 --> 02:08:15.400
version of Minecraft, I guess, but, um, yeah, satisfactory is pretty good.

02:08:15.800 --> 02:08:21.040
Or was it phantasmophobia is another fun one that people are playing a lot of now.

02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:24.120
I got to check out there's this new game that I keep playing.

02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:30.840
Like, um, it's like a Viking, was it Valorant, like a, uh, maybe not Valorant.

02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:31.920
No, it's a different game.

02:08:31.960 --> 02:08:33.080
I think Valorant is a different game.

02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:38.200
Yeah, it's, uh, there's another, there's like a Viking, um, survival game.

02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:40.680
Now Valheim is what questmaster is saying.

02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:41.160
Yes.

02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:42.200
Yes.

02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:42.680
Yes.

02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:44.720
Um, that looked pretty cool.

02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:50.320
Uh, and pixel pockets is in chat and is clarifying games that are best played on PC.

02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:54.160
Well, I was going to go the civilization route and say civilization six.

02:08:54.160 --> 02:08:58.200
Like, I know those games are on console, but I just feel like there's

02:08:58.200 --> 02:09:00.400
something that's really rooted in PC.

02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:05.920
Um, if you feel like playing an MMO or really any of the blizzard games, I think

02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:09.800
play better on PC and I know they've ported some of them to console, like

02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:14.200
Overwatch, of course, and the new Diablo, but things like Warcraft, World of

02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:16.400
Warcraft, those don't exist on console.

02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:19.160
Um, if you're into those, you know, technical kind of game heroes of the

02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:21.920
storm, all of that really only exists on the PC.

02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:26.480
And so I think, you know, blizzard, um, you know, it has a history.

02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:29.000
We'll say, I know they've done some weird things in the past couple of years, but

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:32.280
we'll say they have a history really rooted in PC games, uh, and they've

02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:33.440
done a lot of strong stuff.

02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:35.280
So, um, that's worth checking out too.

02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:35.800
I think.

02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:39.200
Well, last email.

02:09:39.720 --> 02:09:40.280
Um, sure.

02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:41.800
Let me do just a couple of quick things.

02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:46.360
Um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um,

02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:50.680
quick, uh, comments from chat to, uh, DJ Roma S says, friends of mine were trying

02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:54.600
to get me to play, uh, Phasmo, Phasmophobia, uh, with them.

02:09:54.600 --> 02:09:57.360
I told them they'd have to drive out here and put a gun to my head.

02:09:57.360 --> 02:09:58.400
I wouldn't play.

02:09:58.720 --> 02:09:59.080
Yeah.

02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:02.960
Scary games can be a little, Hey, Alan likes to play dead by daylight.

02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:03.440
I.

02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:07.960
It's not, and you know, honestly, in watching him and hearing him explain it,

02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:12.720
it's not really a scary game, but, um, I it's, it's interesting how

02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:14.640
popular that game is on Twitch.

02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:15.480
My God.

02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:18.440
So anyway, pretty much so.

02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:18.800
Yeah.

02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:19.520
All right.

02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:20.160
Sorry, Jamie.

02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:21.240
You can go on with the next email.

02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:23.400
Seeing if Dan will come get Midna.

02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:25.480
Um,

02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:27.600
I was sorry.

02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:28.560
I was gonna say it funny.

02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:31.200
No, I mentioned Valheim and satisfactory.

02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:32.640
Those are all the same publisher.

02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:33.880
That's coffee stain actually.

02:10:33.880 --> 02:10:37.160
And they did the, you know, uh, the goat simulator games as well.

02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:39.080
So I guess I'm a fan.

02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:39.720
All right.

02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:41.400
Cool.

02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:42.880
Next email.

02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:43.320
Yep.

02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:45.160
Hello, LR.

02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:49.920
I was catching up on a slightly out of date episode from the end of January

02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:53.480
where a listener emailed asking about the best song and video games.

02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:57.400
During the discussion that followed, Rob mentioned electronic artist,

02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:02.040
Porter Robinson, and mentioned that he'd been influenced by BeatMania 2DX.

02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:07.360
Well, did you know that he has now appeared in BeatMania 2DX and BeatMania

02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:12.600
2DX 26 rootage, he appears as a virtual self with some particle arts.

02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:16.680
The genre is listed neo-trans and well, I'm not going to mince word.

02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:18.400
Song is a fucking amazing.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.680
Uh, he, he gave us a YouTube link.

02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:23.800
Um, this feels right at home in 2DX.

02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:24.680
That's for sure.

02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:27.160
I hope we can see more from him in the future.

02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:30.040
Um, I don't know if you got the link, Rob.

02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:33.000
I do, but I can't, I can't put it on on air.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:36.120
So, um, but you can, you could easily search for it on YouTube if

02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:37.000
you're curious what that sounds.

02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:38.360
So he's under another name.

02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:39.280
That's how I didn't catch it.

02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:41.200
He's on virtual self was the name.

02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:41.560
Yeah.

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:43.720
A virtual self now out of curiosity.

02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:46.600
And if Shane is still listening, I know he's the DJ max expert.

02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:50.680
At least that I know is because I know Porter Robinson has a song and DJ max.

02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:54.880
Is that, does he show up under virtual self in that game as well?

02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:57.240
Cause I don't know why that name sounds familiar.

02:11:57.240 --> 02:11:58.360
Like I've heard it before.

02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:00.040
Okay.

02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:01.800
Okay.

02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:04.720
So Shane says that's under virtual self ghost voices.

02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:05.200
Okay.

02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:07.840
I was like, I swear I've heard that name.

02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:08.320
All right.

02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:08.800
Got it.

02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:10.240
All right.

02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:12.840
So to continue that said, I have a question.

02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:16.600
What is the best video game song and why is it super, uh, super street

02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:18.080
fighter two version of guile's theme?

02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:25.560
So, so, you know, true, um, lies, it may be versatile, but it is not the best.

02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:30.880
I have always been a bigger fan of reuse theme anyway.

02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:36.880
Lastly, I would say this on air, even if it's vicariously through the person

02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:42.480
reading this email, congratulations, Loki on not only releasing a game, but

02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:44.320
also releasing a really fun game.

02:12:44.680 --> 02:12:49.960
It's my pleasure to have had a hand in well to be, uh, associated

02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:50.920
with pixel poops.

02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:55.480
Number two, I am definitely looking forward to more news about the physical

02:12:55.480 --> 02:12:59.600
release, me too, as I'm sure many of the listeners are, but I also want to

02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:04.200
encourage everyone listening to check the game out either on steam or on itch.io.

02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:05.960
It's definitely worth your time and money.

02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:10.440
Anyway, thanks again for the show, of course, and to those who enjoy my

02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:14.280
games, please look forward to what's next, the final expansion of super multitasking.

02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:18.680
See you later, Aaron, Y Y R thanks for the email Y Y R.

02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:22.000
Um, I don't want to ignore the question about favorite video game song, although

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:25.520
it sounds like you're catching up on back episodes, O L R and I want to say this

02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:31.240
came up in chat just like two weeks ago, if that, so we are, this is a little bit

02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:35.280
of a retread, but I'll quickly ask if anyone wants to kind of talk about, or at

02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:37.280
mention their favorite video game song.

02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:40.720
And I think when I had answered this question before, um, I said something a

02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:42.280
lot about like scars of time.

02:13:42.520 --> 02:13:46.200
I think the question was slightly different that was in chat.

02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:49.560
Cause I think if you were to say like, just like favorite video game song,

02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:51.720
Ooh, that is a toughie.

02:13:51.760 --> 02:13:58.600
Um, probably, I don't even know how to like, there's so many, probably

02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:06.360
probably Tara's theme from final fantasy six for me, but there's so many.

02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:11.600
I'm still going to probably stick with shallow's theme from Chrono Trigger.

02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:12.440
Okay.

02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:15.560
Okay.

02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:19.360
And act deaf said it was, he asked it and it was what song made you appreciate

02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:20.680
or notice video game music.

02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:20.840
Okay.

02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:26.200
So it was slightly different, but still, um, Loki, you have a favorite track.

02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:28.040
I don't even know.

02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:28.760
There's so many.

02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:32.600
Um, I like a lot of the stuff from DJ hero.

02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:38.560
Like, um, there was the remix that they did between, um, shout

02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:39.400
and piano.

02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:40.080
That was awesome.

02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:45.240
Um, outside of like DJ hero, I would say, I mean, I don't know.

02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:46.920
There's so many DDR songs.

02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:54.120
I mean, outside of like music games, maybe like some of the Katamari music

02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:59.960
or, um, you know, buggy running beats from rez.

02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:01.320
Oh yeah.

02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:01.720
Rez.

02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:04.360
I don't know.

02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:06.600
There's just, there's too much to choose from.

02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:13.480
There is, I think we have to exclude those stuff in, uh, in a, uh, rock band.

02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:15.640
Uh, as Bobby was suggesting, Tom Sawyer.

02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:18.440
All right.

02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:23.280
Well, besides that, I'd prefer working man to sing it all depends on

02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:25.160
how you want to interpret the question, but there you go.

02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:25.680
There you go.

02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:27.280
So, all right.

02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:28.800
I think that was it for emails.

02:15:28.880 --> 02:15:32.640
So a reminder, if you want to send us an email, that was it.

02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:33.200
All right.

02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:36.320
Participate at orange on trader.com is the place where you can send an

02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:37.920
email and get read on air as well.

02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:41.800
Um, I want to ask in chat, is there anything you guys want us to bring up

02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:43.560
or talk about here before we wrap it up?

02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:47.760
Otherwise I'm going to kick it over to Loki to see if he has any last minute

02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:51.040
stories, because I do feel like there was a ton of stuff you submitted that it

02:15:52.040 --> 02:15:56.240
was just like a lot of little things this week, but I don't know if there's

02:15:56.240 --> 02:15:57.200
anything you want to mention.

02:15:58.080 --> 02:16:02.680
There is a mod for Tekken to add Tifa into it, which makes me wish that they

02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:04.320
would just do a new Ergites game.

02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:04.920
Right.

02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:06.640
But it looked awesome.

02:16:06.680 --> 02:16:10.120
Like they have, they took Tifa from the new, uh, the, the final

02:16:10.120 --> 02:16:13.320
fantasy seven remake and just looks amazing.

02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:15.920
I mean, just like, give me a new, like.

02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:20.880
Ergits I would like that, or not even necessarily that like more

02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:21.800
of that crossover stuff.

02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:25.600
I could always use more crossover stuff in like different

02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:27.760
fighting games, um, would be amazing.

02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:30.960
Um, hell it'd be awesome.

02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:34.000
It's like having some of like the characters from the boys appear in

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:37.080
like some of these fighting games, you know, like kind of, kind of like

02:16:37.080 --> 02:16:40.760
what they did with, um, Injustice and stuff like that.

02:16:41.360 --> 02:16:43.360
Um, gosh, I don't know.

02:16:45.560 --> 02:16:46.760
Yeah, it looks really good.

02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:48.640
Like it is surprisingly good.

02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:52.760
Um, let's see, let me try to see what else I had in there.

02:16:54.200 --> 02:17:01.080
Um, uh, six days in, uh, Flugia is coming back.

02:17:01.440 --> 02:17:06.880
So that was a shooter that was set in, uh, the, I, it was set in Iraq.

02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:11.760
And I know that was something we talked about years ago, but apparently

02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:16.240
now they're supposed to be like starting development on that again.

02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:20.240
So it'd be interesting to see if that ends up coming out at some point.

02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:24.280
Um, but yeah, um, interesting.

02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:26.440
And then what else?

02:17:26.480 --> 02:17:32.240
Uh, this weird, like concierge service that switch has now, where they're

02:17:32.240 --> 02:17:38.480
basically going to, um, kind of like walk you through like some of the features

02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:42.560
of the Nintendo switch and also do some sort of like, I guess, maybe

02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:44.800
recommendations for games as well.

02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:46.600
Um, so that's kind of interesting.

02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:51.440
And there's six, I guess, there's six half hour sessions to choose from.

02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:56.360
They have a switch one a one games, games, what to play next, security and

02:17:56.360 --> 02:17:59.080
privacy and head to account customization.

02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:03.480
And so it's kind of like a tutorial for the switch platform.

02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:07.400
So that's interesting, I guess, kind of going towards

02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:08.920
their like family friendly stuff.

02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:14.200
Um, here's one, actually, they didn't put in the show role, but I was going

02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:18.120
to mention anyways, it was because it brought me back to like Roosevelt

02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:24.920
golf land, um, where there was an arcade, uh, like some teenager got arrested

02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:27.000
for kicking an arcade machine.

02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:31.120
So it was one of those ones where you actually like have to punch it, like it,

02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:34.440
it, uh, registered, like how hard do you hit something?

02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:38.400
But, um, he had kicked the machine because it took a while to get to the

02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:39.720
machine because it took his money.

02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:42.760
And so they arrested him like, man, why can't they do that here?

02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:48.960
I guess we might have to rethink our, uh, ultra Cade thing from like 15 years.

02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:50.240
Well, it wasn't an ultra Cade.

02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:53.640
It was, it was something else, but yeah, it's, yeah, yeah, we're going to

02:18:53.640 --> 02:18:55.120
be in charges inciting violence.

02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:57.920
The chat just lit up about the ultra Cade thing too.

02:18:57.920 --> 02:18:58.440
I'm sorry.

02:18:58.600 --> 02:19:01.320
Some of you remember we talked, I don't even remember why it

02:19:01.320 --> 02:19:02.720
was kick an ultra Cade machine.

02:19:02.920 --> 02:19:04.240
I think they did something shady.

02:19:04.920 --> 02:19:10.720
And I think they were trying to trademark or a copyright maim is what it was.

02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:17.080
I remember taking a picture of dark soccer, kicking the cabinet at

02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:20.880
Roseville golf land and like putting it on either our website or whatever.

02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:23.800
So live journal, whatever social media we were using at the time.

02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:24.920
Um, dark soccer.

02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:25.560
Do you remember that?

02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:27.120
Me taking a picture of you kicking an ultra Cade?

02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:28.520
Yeah.

02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:30.840
So, um, what was that?

02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:32.920
Yeah, I do.

02:19:33.240 --> 02:19:33.760
Oh yeah.

02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:36.480
Um, so yeah, dark tissue says, yeah, I remember that too.

02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:36.760
Yeah.

02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:41.480
So, um, so basically I took pictures of dark soccer, committing a crime.

02:19:41.560 --> 02:19:42.400
That's so cool.

02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:46.240
They're going to such a rebel mayor.

02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:47.080
Put you in jail.

02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:49.520
Jail.

02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:54.560
This, uh, DJ says, I also sent a photo of me kicking an ultra Cade machine.

02:19:54.760 --> 02:19:57.320
Oh, that was probably back when the website, you could submit your own

02:19:57.320 --> 02:19:59.440
pictures and they'd show up at the challenge.

02:19:59.800 --> 02:20:00.120
Yeah.

02:20:00.120 --> 02:20:00.840
It was like a challenge.

02:20:00.840 --> 02:20:03.240
And I think we, like, we had a thing where you could send a picture to an

02:20:03.240 --> 02:20:04.480
email and it would show up on the website.

02:20:04.760 --> 02:20:08.160
And then of course, one of those shitposting sites found it and we had to

02:20:08.160 --> 02:20:10.680
take it down cause it just became obnoxious.

02:20:10.960 --> 02:20:13.560
So, but when it was working, it worked.

02:20:13.600 --> 02:20:14.640
It was a lot of fun.

02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:15.880
That memories.

02:20:17.920 --> 02:20:18.360
All right.

02:20:18.400 --> 02:20:18.720
Yeah.

02:20:18.760 --> 02:20:20.040
Is that it for last minute stories?

02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:21.320
Yeah, that's it.

02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:21.920
All right.

02:20:22.160 --> 02:20:26.480
Well, I'm not seeing a lot of comments in chat, so I think it is about time to wrap

02:20:26.480 --> 02:20:29.800
up, but I do want to thank everybody who's listening live tonight, whether you're

02:20:29.800 --> 02:20:34.960

02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:39.440
podcast, we really appreciate you being here and listening this week.

02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:42.600
Hope you all had a good Valentine's day.

Those that are live are on podcast.

02:20:45.120 --> 02:20:48.040
And I hope you've had, have a great week with gaming.

02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:51.240
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend

02:20:51.240 --> 02:20:52.200
or two about the show.

02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:55.520
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:20:55.520 --> 02:20:59.440
But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, then we don't have those voices.

02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:03.160
Um, if you feel like supporting the show financially, which you don't have to do,

02:21:03.160 --> 02:21:04.200
but we really appreciate it.

02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:07.920
Uh, check out our shop over at vog network.com slash shop.

02:21:08.120 --> 02:21:11.640
You can buy yourself a t-shirt or some other, like a sticker and some other stuff

02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:12.440
that's on there.

02:21:12.720 --> 02:21:15.880
And again, we're hoping to add to that in the coming months, but we're just, you

02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:18.000
know, we just haven't gotten to making the new products yet.

02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:21.480
Um, and, uh, what else do I want to say?

02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:23.880
Um, I forget.

02:21:23.880 --> 02:21:24.920
Oh, an auto host.

02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:25.640
What's that?

02:21:26.560 --> 02:21:26.960
Words.

02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:29.040
You were going to say some words and I remembered.

02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:31.280
Uh, an auto host here at Twitch.

02:21:31.320 --> 02:21:33.080
Those go a long way as well.

02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:37.760
So I really want to thank those that go out of your way to a host us here on Twitch TV.

02:21:38.040 --> 02:21:38.720
Um, thank you.

02:21:38.720 --> 02:21:43.360
Thank you so much for all of the support and helping us grow and continuing to do so in

02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:44.960
2021 as well.

02:21:45.240 --> 02:21:49.000
So, uh, with that, I think we are on final thoughts.

02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:51.920
So, um, dark soccer, I'll start with you.

02:21:51.920 --> 02:21:52.560
Your final thought.

02:21:53.480 --> 02:21:56.520
Um, I hate sinus infections.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:03.720
I'm glad I only have to take doxy one more day and my head feels like it's exploding from the

02:22:03.720 --> 02:22:04.080
inside.

02:22:04.600 --> 02:22:04.840
All right.

02:22:04.840 --> 02:22:05.480
Well, feel better.

02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:06.520
We missed you last week.

02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:11.280
I had an F you that I didn't, that I didn't get a chance to do, and I've brought to tell you about

02:22:11.280 --> 02:22:11.440
it.

02:22:11.640 --> 02:22:12.280
Go ahead.

02:22:13.120 --> 02:22:23.120
Fuck you to see a stupid black face in your movie for your stupid having a neurotypical actress play

02:22:23.160 --> 02:22:24.320
an autistic woman.

02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:25.080
Fuck you.

02:22:25.080 --> 02:22:25.840
Fuck your movie.

02:22:25.840 --> 02:22:27.240
Fuck everything about you.

02:22:27.240 --> 02:22:29.680
I don't ever want to hear from you ever again.

02:22:29.720 --> 02:22:30.640
I hope that you die.

02:22:30.640 --> 02:22:31.520
Penny, listen to gutter.

02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:37.320
Well, Loki, I don't know how you can follow that, but I'll ask you for your final thought anyway.

02:22:38.120 --> 02:22:44.160
Um, well, I'm going to take a break and if you haven't checked that pixel whoops number two, check

02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:44.480
it out.

02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:48.360
Same with the original and the Commodore 64 version as well.

02:22:48.360 --> 02:22:49.920
So go check those out.

02:22:50.800 --> 02:22:57.480
Like I said, I put it in the, um, that was at the, that independent game database.

02:22:57.720 --> 02:23:02.120
So hopefully that'll be up on Twitch eventually as a selectable option.

02:23:02.480 --> 02:23:04.160
And they say it takes 24 hours to update.

02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:04.600
So we'll see.

02:23:05.480 --> 02:23:08.640
Um, and Loki, get yourself out there, promote your game.

02:23:08.640 --> 02:23:10.800
I know you want to take a break, but I've been trying.

02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:12.920
No one has like story submissions.

02:23:12.920 --> 02:23:15.600
They get to like register for their website and stuff.

02:23:15.600 --> 02:23:23.720
And I've said stuff like to different publishing or like different sites, but it's just, it's a nothing game.

02:23:23.720 --> 02:23:25.240
I just thought, Hey, ha ha.

02:23:25.240 --> 02:23:26.720
And NES game is pooping.

02:23:26.720 --> 02:23:28.800
You know, you just click bait enough.

02:23:28.840 --> 02:23:33.240
You need one site to pick it up and then everybody else will copy paste it.

02:23:33.960 --> 02:23:34.600
Exactly.

02:23:34.800 --> 02:23:35.520
So good luck.

02:23:36.200 --> 02:23:38.400
Well, don't forget podcasts and things like that as well.

02:23:38.440 --> 02:23:42.480
You know, hit up some other gaming podcasters that we know, see what you can do.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:43.400
All right.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:50.800
Um, and then my final thought is, um, just I, how great that things have come full circle.

02:23:50.800 --> 02:24:00.680
I mean, we, of course have, thanks to YYR had an OLR joke game kind of become a real game before, uh, with Bungie ferret tossing and all that stuff.

02:24:00.680 --> 02:24:11.880
But for, for Loki to now kind of bring that to us and bring that full circle where it's like, not, not only did we think of the game or dark soccer thought of the game, but then Loki made the game.

02:24:12.040 --> 02:24:26.760
And I, well, it's shake and bake and I helped, um, that's pretty much it, but, um, but the fact that that's really come full circle where now OLR has, has impacted games like that, I think is a really awesome thing.

02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:34.480
So keep gaming, keep making, keep creating, whether it be games or whatever art you're into and just have yourself a wonderful week.

02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:36.400
Everybody we'll see you in seven days.

02:24:36.680 --> 02:24:37.160
Good night.

02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:38.120
Bye.

02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:41.760
