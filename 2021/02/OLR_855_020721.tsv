0	13720	Last week's article about the rumored shuttering of Konami's games division, called a re-shuffle,
13720	17080	was an interesting one, especially in the face of their ongoing Pockyslot and Bimani
17080	18080	series.
18080	20320	And pro-evolution soccer staying power, I suppose.
20320	24280	Calling all keyboard enthusiasts, get those MIDI keyboards out of storage and play nostalgia,
24280	26880	if you live in Japan or otherwise know what you're doing.
26880	29320	This has been your Bimani News Update for February 2021.
29320	32440	Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to bring you more
32440	35160	on this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where
35160	37160	every gamer has a voice.
37160	44720	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where
44720	46840	every gamer has a voice.
46840	52560	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and Bimani updates are always welcome here, just for the record,
52560	55860	because that is of course where the show has its roots.
55860	60820	Where myself, Dark Sakura, and Loki got our start playing Dance Dance Revolution at the
60820	65700	local arcade many many years ago, about 20 years ago at this point.
65700	66700	Anyway, hi.
66700	71540	Welcome, I'm Rob Roberts and it's episode number 855 of our show for this February the
71540	74580	7th of 2021.
74580	78820	Not joining me tonight unfortunately, Dark Sakura or Jamie Sommers, she has the night
78820	82700	off, she was feeling a little bit under the weather, so she'll be in a pre-recorded segment
82700	86500	a little later on, but we will not be hearing from her live sadly.
86500	88380	But she'll be here with us next week.
88380	94100	But who is joining us live tonight is our good old pal Loki, who I think has been having
94100	95340	a very busy week.
95340	96340	Hi Loki.
96340	98220	Yeah, it's been busy.
98220	104600	I keep seeing your Twitter, and you're like, I'm giving myself crunch day, I'm taking a
104600	108260	day off of work to work on Friday.
108260	113500	And I did, and Saturday, and pretty much mostly today.
113500	119980	Wow, so yeah, and I didn't realize until kind of the middle of the week that you and Aaron
119980	126780	or YYR were really committed to the February 10th release date for Pixel Poops, which we've
126780	129500	been hyping up for the last few weeks on this show.
129500	133020	For whatever reason, this is your first Orange Lounge radio.
133020	137740	This long running gag here on the show are these dream games, like we'll throw out this
137740	140740	crazy idea and be like, that should be a game.
140740	146140	And well, one of them became a game on the PlayStation Vita, it's called Pixel Poops.
146140	151980	And yes, you go to the little taco stand and eat tacos, and then you stop joggers from
151980	155940	running through the park by, well, it's in the title.
155940	162820	So this game came out on the Vita, why Aaron or YYR did it, obviously can't get it anymore,
162820	167460	because they kind of closed that part of the Vita shop down.
167820	173980	He's now re-realizing Pixel Poops through a Steam release, which is coming out in just
173980	175580	a few days, like three more days.
175580	178420	So by the time some of you hear this, it will already be out.
178420	182780	But he didn't just decide to release Pixel Poops, oh no, he decided he was going to do
182780	189060	a Commodore 64 version of the game as well, as well as releasing sound samples, souping
189060	193680	up the game with some extra modes that are very reminiscent of like the game switch on
193680	195100	an Atari 2600.
195740	200780	As silly as the idea sounds, and as much as when I say Pixel Poops, and you probably go,
200780	204260	that sounds stupid, yeah, but it's fun.
204260	208300	Like a lot of old videos, like, have you ever looked at Atari 2600 box art?
208300	209940	It's pretty stupid.
209940	210940	And I mean that with love.
210940	215660	A lot of the games are like weird, like, I mean, look at the premise of like, it's Pac-Man,
215660	220660	you're a thing that eats dots and getting chased by ghosts for some reason, it's like,
220660	221660	what's the story there?
221660	223780	I don't know, there is no story.
223780	224780	Exactly.
225460	230460	So not only has Aaron got all this going on and takes all this on, but then Loki's like,
230460	235320	you know what, I want to sign up for Punishment 2, I'm going to do an NES version of Pixel
235320	236320	Poops.
236320	241380	And you know what, I guess we'll just release it all on the same day, because it's going
241380	246440	to be free on Steam, so Pixel Poops, the base game is free on Steam, so you can go check
246440	250380	that out, because you can actually, I think you can play it on Aaron's website anyway,
250380	253860	I think it's been there the whole time, so you can play it for free there, and you can
253860	258140	play it for free on Steam, but then there's going to be like DLC that's going to cost
258140	259140	$2.99?
259140	260140	$1.99?
260140	261140	$2.99?
261140	262140	$1.99?
262140	265660	It's going to cost less than a fucking latte, okay?
265660	269100	It's going to be cheap, and you can go buy it, and that's going to give you the Commodore
269100	275120	64 version, the soundtrack, and, or I shouldn't say soundtrack, but the authentic sample pack
275120	281020	and all that stuff, and Loki's game, Pixel Poops number 2, which, he's crunching this
281020	282620	weekend because he hasn't finished.
283180	286260	So Pixel Poops number 2 will be a separate piece of DLC.
286260	288300	Oh, okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
288300	289980	It's not included in the $5.
289980	290980	Oh, my bad.
290980	292340	So that is separate.
292340	295380	Still, still, it's like $5, that's nothing.
295380	302180	Yeah, I think for my game, I was going to charge right now, like, I was going to do
302180	306880	$8, but I mean, we've got like 32 levels in it, well, it's going to have like at least
306880	316600	40 levels, and it's pretty hard, and I've redone a lot of the, I'm still drawing stuff
316600	323560	for it right now, so there's a lot of content in there, because I wanted it to be on par
323560	327480	with, like, I was looking at, like, okay, what are some of these other puzzle action
327480	333280	games, how many levels do they have, oh, 50, okay, we'll see if we can get up to 50, but
333280	340080	it's probably going to be 40, because I have five worlds, and each one has eight levels,
340080	344520	so it's probably going to be there, unless I decide to cram in a few more levels, which
344520	345640	I still could.
345640	351080	I just love that you're releasing a game on, what, Wednesday, and it's still not done.
351080	357640	Well, technically, it doesn't need to be done, even when it comes to Wednesday, because we
357640	363200	do live in that modern age where we can catch stuff, but like, yeah, it'll be done by then.
364120	368160	So, and going to our chat room, because of course, we do tape live every Sunday night
368160	373080	at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock
373080	377160	Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, and Fifth Dream is asking, any news
377160	379360	on the physical, because do what?
379360	381280	Well, I'm going to help answer that.
381280	385640	First, Loki needs to finish the game, then he can worry about the physical version.
385640	390240	Yeah, so the physical version will be coming at some point, so like, what I want to do
390280	395040	with that, I may end up doing, because like I said, there's a lot of stuff I wanted to
395040	400360	do, but time, you know, may not be necessarily on my side to do all the things I want to
400360	401360	do.
401360	408880	So what we may end up doing is like releasing a finished version of the game on Wednesday,
408880	414460	and then coming back to do like a special edition that will be the physical version
414460	418080	and will be a free upgrade to the DLC, whatever.
418080	421160	So that may be what I end up doing, because I still want to see if there's, I've got a
421160	426040	lot of space in different, because the way it's banked in there, the way the memories
426040	430200	split up, I have a lot of space in there, and I want to cram more music and stuff like
430200	433600	that in there and more levels as well.
433600	436000	And my kids keep asking me for like boss fights and stuff.
436000	439720	So I had some silly ideas regarding that.
439720	446160	So I want to cram all that stuff in there as well, if possible, to really like maximize
446160	447160	everything.
447240	452400	And then the next day, you know, we'll just, you know, charge the $8 initially.
452400	455800	And then if we bump it, the special edition will be $10 total.
455800	460080	So if you bought in at the $8 version, then you get the special edition for free type
460080	461080	thing.
461080	462080	Yeah.
462080	464360	So that's, that's the initial idea I have.
464360	465360	We'll see.
465360	468560	I mean, we may just leave it at eight bucks and call it a day.
468560	469560	Well, I do like this.
469560	474720	SSJ 100 Matt in chat says, Loki already more transparent than CD Projekt Red about the
474720	475720	process.
475720	476720	No.
476720	477720	Yes.
477720	478720	Yes.
478720	479720	I understand.
479720	480720	It's called scope creep.
480720	484600	I am very familiar with scope creep and that, that is, that is the whole reason I did it
484600	488880	on the NES because I can't implement a lot of the stuff I would like to implement on
488880	494160	it because it just, it just physically can't be done because it's, you know, limited in
494160	499000	space and, um, what the engine can handle and stuff like that.
499000	506680	So that was on purpose because, and it worked because I've finished, I'm about to finish
506680	507680	something.
507680	510600	So, uh, that was the intent, but we'll see.
510600	511600	Yeah.
511600	514560	So I was looking in chat and there was a little bit of discussion about the price and, you
514560	519000	know, uh, set it at 10 bucks and then just have it go on sale a lot cause you know, sales,
519000	522960	you know, and honestly, like I was going to say, I think when I was on YYR site this week,
522960	526880	uh, he actually said that the price of a couple of his games are going to go up this month.
526880	528760	And honestly, my reaction was good.
528760	529760	You deserve it.
529760	533720	Like you guys, well, YYR specifically in this case deserves a bigger cut.
533720	538020	Like these games are great and it's unfortunate, unfortunate that, you know, there's just so
538020	542600	many games on steam that you have to have that viral moment to really get discovered
542600	543600	sometimes.
543600	545720	I may end up doing 10 bucks.
545720	551520	I remember having 99 or whatever I was, cause I was looking at like other games, like, Oh,
551520	553960	my game, it doesn't, it's not as good as that.
553960	554960	You know?
554960	558620	So I was like, eh, no people are going to pay $10 for this.
558620	562260	So I may just end up doing 10 bucks and then we'll just do the free upgrade later.
562260	563700	Um, we'll see.
563700	567960	I don't know, but you need to go on other podcasts to promote, by the way, you, you
567960	570620	should be booking a bunch of podcasts this month.
570620	575820	Well, I don't, yeah, I don't have time yet to advertise and that's probably a big mistake,
575820	581080	but, um, I do want to like definitely get it out there because just the premise of a
581080	584960	game in an NES game and stuff like that, I think that should be able to get some quick
584960	586840	bait articles on some sites.
586840	590680	So we can see if I can put together like something like that.
590680	594600	Well, you had that YouTube that was like, you're not going to believe this one dude,
594600	600800	but still, but still it shows that, yeah, you know, as people that think it's so weird
600800	602960	in a good way that they, they want to highlight it.
602960	608560	So yeah, so, so, so far we've got, was it, we've got the, the park level, we've got a
608560	615280	cemetery levels, uh, snowy mountains and then like sort of a Western theme.
615280	621480	So that, that's what we've got done so far and now I'm working on, um, it's a inside
621480	623840	of the Nintendo type level.
623840	625620	So it's all circuit boards and stuff.
625620	628520	So that's what I'm working on artwork for right now.
628520	633200	And that's just going to be like an amalgamation of all the different things in the game.
633200	636080	But yeah, it, it's going to get pretty hard.
636080	640920	And um, I was telling the originals pretty difficult, which, but by the way I did play,
640920	645040	so not to get too far into my gaming week, but oops, I did play some pixel poops the
645040	648000	other night just because, you know, it's a, it's a fun little game to sit down and
648000	649280	play for a little bit.
649280	652540	And um, I got, I broke Aaron's score.
652540	657000	So I have the number one score right now in the, in the base, like default mode, basically
657000	658300	I have the number one score.
658300	662560	And the only reason it didn't get higher, I was trying to go in and screenshot when
662560	666660	I hit 666 because you know, LOL.
666660	671360	And then of course I was so focused on getting the screenshot at 66, 66.
671360	672360	When did I lose?
672360	675840	667.
675840	681520	So that's, that's the current high score in the world world world for a pixel poops.
681520	682520	So yeah.
682520	683520	So yeah.
683520	687360	And basically once, once I do have the game done, like I am still looking at physical
687360	688640	like versions of that.
688640	690480	I don't know how I want to do that yet.
690480	694240	If that involves like a Kickstarter and then with Kickstarter, it's like, okay, well, what
694240	698800	do I actually need the fund because you know, how much is going to go to Kickstarter then
698800	702000	taxes and costs and you got to make something off of it.
702000	705080	So, you know, it's all of that stuff involved.
705080	707000	That's like, I don't know, cause I've never run a Kickstarter.
707000	708000	So who knows?
708000	710360	That's a interesting way thing to look into.
710360	712520	You can also, there's alternate crown fundings too.
712520	716440	Um, but that might be an interesting way to do it because at least you have a finished
716440	720120	product and you'll be able to say, here is the game on steam right here.
720120	723680	This is to produce a physical version of said game and you're not going to have to worry
723680	727240	about the whole like, well, I don't know if I want to buy it cause I don't know if it'll
727240	729320	actually happen cause it's done.
729320	731320	Like you just, you're trying to get the publishing stuff.
731320	733040	And I think that's a good way to do it.
733040	734040	So I may do that.
734040	738160	Um, the other thing I did want to do as well is I have got that nice cover artwork once
738160	740960	I get the logo added onto it as well.
740960	746960	I'm going to make a t-shirt, t-shirts, I'll have that at some point too.
746960	749000	So you'll be able to buy shirts for that kind of stuff.
749000	753280	But yeah, I know a place that has a growing store, but now I'm sure you want to make your
753280	754280	own coin off it.
754280	755280	I gotcha.
755280	756280	But yeah, go for it.
756280	757280	So, yeah.
757280	758280	All right.
758280	761440	Um, Bobby is that now I don't want to turn this into the pixel poop show because we are
761440	764160	going to talk about other gaming, but this is a, this is kind of a big deal.
764160	767220	Like the game that Loki's been talking about for a year and a half is finally releasing
767220	768220	this week.
768220	769840	You can go wishlist it on steam.
769840	771560	It hasn't even been a year and a half.
771560	772920	It's only been six months.
772920	773920	Yeah.
773920	774920	Hard to believe.
774920	777920	I guess I'm adding the time to car stuff I think just in my mind.
777920	778920	Yeah.
778920	779920	That's been a while.
779920	780920	Yeah.
780920	784080	So, um, I, I would go wishlist the game on steam right now if you haven't already.
784080	787640	Um, I'm sorry, I don't have a link available, but you guys are smart in chat.
787640	789960	Somebody will find that link in five seconds and post it.
789960	794280	So, uh, go wishlist it right now because the more that have it wishlisted, of course, the
794280	795880	more people that might see it and all that good stuff.
795880	799400	Um, and we want to make sure why we are low key get views and it is, remember the base
799400	800400	is going to be free.
800400	802640	So you're not like committing to buy anything or whatever.
802640	804840	If you don't want to get the DLC, you don't have to.
804840	808600	Um, but, uh, the base thing will be free and you should definitely grab that.
808600	809600	I encourage that.
809600	810600	So, uh, cool.
810600	811600	All right.
811600	812600	Anyway.
812600	813600	Okay.
813600	814600	Sorry.
814600	815600	Lots of stuff, but it's important.
815600	818920	There's a long running OLR joke that's climaxing this week.
818920	821020	So let's check that out on steam.
821020	825700	It's important for us to talk about, uh, let's get into, um, by the way, I love that behind
825700	830200	you tonight, you have, that's either the arcade version of moonwalker or the Genesis version
830200	831960	of the arcade playing behind you.
831960	835920	I've never played the arcade version that they was the same as the, uh, I have just
835920	836920	a couple of times.
836920	838400	I have just a couple of times.
838400	839400	It's awesome.
839400	843720	Uh, it was, it was a great, great game and I'm assuming this is your continued, uh, to
843720	845180	the moon talk.
845180	851140	You must have because I just was thinking, I saw, um, like before the show, it was on
851140	853060	the scroll and Bobby's show talking about end Walker.
853060	854060	I was like, Oh yeah.
854060	855060	Moonwalker.
855060	856060	I could do that.
856060	857060	Okay.
857060	858060	Okay.
858060	859060	Okay.
859060	860060	Clever.
860060	861060	Clever.
861060	862060	Speaking of to the moon, doge coin.
862060	863060	Glad I got in what I did.
863060	864060	Did you get in a doge coin?
864060	865060	Good for you.
865060	866060	Yeah.
866060	869180	It's I didn't get in much like 50 bucks, but it's already doubled.
869180	872100	So you know, that's better than nothing.
872100	877180	And I guess I put 50 bucks on Ethereum just out of the blue last week and it got to 60.
877180	880460	I think now it's around like 58, but I'm just going to let it sit for a little bit.
880460	882100	See what happens.
882100	887980	It's money that would have been like a lotto ticket or a slot machine, like, you know,
887980	892860	in the real, in a non COVID world, you know, and still like with the GameStop and like
892860	897340	AMC still holding on that stuff for now, cause it's already dropped in price.
898340	903260	It may come back next week, never know, or make bump up a little bit.
903260	907420	And if not, I just dump it and buy more doge coin.
907420	912660	I'm going to our chat, fifth dream props to you cause you found the links to the steam
912660	913660	store first.
913660	914660	So thank you for that.
914660	915660	All right.
915660	918100	Let's get to our kickoff topic tonight.
918100	919620	We want to talk about this.
919620	923380	Some big gaming news that came out early this week, and I'm sure you all have a lot of feelings
923380	924380	on it.
924420	925420	It's fine.
925420	929820	It's well, there is, there's what this is and what this isn't.
929820	930820	Let's get into it.
930820	931820	Loki.
931820	932820	I got it.
932820	939860	So what, what it is is basically so stadia, the, you know, and to any console really,
939860	943860	you know, the console is only as strong as the games that are on it.
943860	948980	And you know, really when it comes to stadia, it was like, okay, what are the killer apps?
948980	953900	What is the exclusive game that I got to play on stadia?
953900	955620	That's really going to drive me to that platform.
955620	960780	Well, now there's not going to be any because Google stadia has announced that they are
960780	965860	no longer going to be pursuing internal development on their own games.
965860	971900	So they've closed its two game studios in Montreal and Los Angeles.
971900	975300	And apparently that is impacting about 150 developers.
975300	984260	So no new game from Jade Raymond, you know, now it's just going to continue to operate
984260	989980	its service and it's a $10 monthly stadia pro service as well.
989980	995780	I mean, I gotta be honest, like this is definitely the writing on the wall.
995780	1002860	Like I would be very wary to buy anything on stadia purchasing any games because I mean,
1002860	1005380	we could be talking about next year, this could be shutting down.
1005380	1009900	I mean, it's, I don't know, they're already cutting their losses.
1009900	1016180	So it seems to be that this is just kind of one step into that direction of actually shutting
1016180	1017180	the whole service down.
1017180	1022220	Well, and to be clear, because I said, there's what this news is and what this news isn't,
1022220	1026580	this is not that news that stadia is shutting down, which I think a lot of people were kind
1026580	1028300	of reading into it that way.
1028300	1032300	This is not that this is Google saying that they're essentially refocusing.
1032300	1036540	But it's, it's all kind of PR speak that we can see right through for that they didn't
1036540	1042100	see the need to continue developing the games in house, whether the games just weren't turning
1042100	1045820	out at the level they were hoping or what it was, if that had to do with some of the
1045820	1049980	response to stadia, I don't know if we'll know, unfortunately, and I've said this a
1049980	1056500	million times on the show, and I don't think we say it enough, is that a lot of times in
1056500	1061700	fandom press, which is, you know, what a lot of gaming blogs and stuff is, especially when
1061700	1064980	it comes to social media, especially when it comes to social media.
1064980	1071060	The reality is, the truth, and what Google's intentions are, and what Google is trying
1071060	1075660	to do and what Google might have been doing, the truth doesn't matter.
1075660	1078660	And I know that sounds like a really stupid thing to say.
1078660	1079660	But that is the reality.
1079660	1081860	The truth doesn't matter.
1081860	1083300	What matters?
1083300	1084660	Perception.
1084660	1086700	Perception is what matters.
1086700	1089800	How is news perceived?
1089800	1095920	And gotta be honest, when Google first announced stadia, what were several people in our chat
1095920	1096920	room saying?
1096920	1098920	What were several people on social media saying?
1098920	1101560	What were a lot of people out there saying?
1101560	1105780	Well, Google's getting into this, but Google doesn't have the greatest track record at
1105780	1107720	supporting the stuff they put out there.
1107720	1111560	I give it a couple years, and now what happens?
1111560	1113460	Google's slowly yanking that support.
1113460	1114920	At least that's the perception.
1114920	1117440	And that's all that matters.
1117440	1120640	So that's why this is...
1120640	1123720	It's unfortunate, because I know people who like stadia.
1123720	1128520	I know people who really fan for stadia and want to see stadia do better.
1128520	1134160	And I'm trying to be very cautious to not rain on the parade, because I'm sure they're
1134160	1138160	already feeling crappy enough after this week and so forth.
1138160	1141200	Good for you for sticking by it and what you believe in.
1141200	1144000	And I don't think cloud gaming is going to be...
1144000	1153960	I'm not even sure stadia is really super duper done, but I think the imagining scenario
1153960	1160360	that Google painted for us is that stadia is going to be an invisible console that competes
1160360	1164360	right up there with Xbox One and PlayStation 5 and all.
1164360	1165360	Eh, no.
1165360	1166360	You know what?
1166360	1168280	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
1168280	1172280	And Google has now just said, we're not interested in developing our own games anymore.
1172320	1177000	So that whole thing, I think, is gone.
1177000	1182480	So now it's just about, how else can stadia be leveraged?
1182480	1189160	Who can insert stadia into that magic winning formula where maybe stadia comes back as something
1189160	1192040	else and not that imaginary fourth console?
1192040	1194040	Loki, I want to let you have a say.
1194040	1196540	No, I was going to say, yeah, exactly that.
1196540	1199880	It's just, I don't know.
1199880	1207640	Your whole business model is just kind of not as appealing as something else, like where
1207640	1212000	you have that kind of Netflix model where you just basically pay a fee and you can have
1212000	1214040	access to a library of games.
1214040	1218440	And again, that's perception fucking stadia, I'm sorry to interrupt, but that's perception
1218440	1222820	fucking stadia again, because when it was announced, oh, Google's putting out this service
1222820	1229060	and you pay $10 a month and you get some games, everybody's kind of thinking, oh, Google's
1229100	1230900	going to do the Netflix things for game.
1230900	1233780	Great. And that's that's the perception people have.
1233940	1237860	Right. Oh, if Google's charging 10 bucks a month, which is what they were out there doing
1237860	1240540	with pro and all that, then I must be able to get in there and play all those games for
1240540	1244380	free. And then it was like, oh, you can play some games for free.
1244620	1247860	You can play these games that we have the arrangement, but you don't get to play everything
1247860	1250460	for free. In fact, you have to pay $60 if you want to play like cyberpunk and stuff.
1250580	1252060	And I think that's where the public went.
1252400	1254420	Oh, never mind.
1255420	1259140	And I think that's a big part of what has hurt Stadia from the beginning.
1259860	1261940	So it's yeah, it's.
1264500	1271380	It's just it's it's not helping at all, and it's going to be hard to see them already,
1271380	1276020	even like we've had some stuff where, you know, stuff that you think should have supported
1276020	1281220	it, like I don't even know if like their plate, their Google TV stuff supports Stadia.
1281780	1287220	I don't believe it does, which is kind of seems to be a big miss right there as well.
1287220	1291460	It's just like half half assed kind of support from Google for it.
1291700	1295940	And there was a lot of confusion, like I didn't even realize until this week that you
1295940	1300540	didn't need a Stadia pro account to play Stadia games in the browser now that at some
1300540	1302060	point they flip the switch for that.
1302060	1306940	I didn't even realize that, like Google's had a big problem with messaging now for it
1306940	1312300	to their credit during this whole pandemic and the fact that it's killed all these
1312300	1316500	conventions and the opportunity for them to go show the public a little more about this
1316500	1322820	stuff. I will I will allow them to shift some blame on that, that, you know, they had a
1322820	1325140	hard time getting the messaging out because of the pandemic.
1325380	1326460	I get that.
1326460	1331900	I understand that. But I still wish they would have invested another year in trying to
1331900	1334580	get the right messaging out if they really wanted this to be successful.
1335260	1339380	But, you know, maybe they just have to take some time to use the rest of this pandemic to
1339380	1342900	figure out what that thing is and then go with it, because, you know, there's lots of
1343020	1345980	still great ideas and I think uses for cloud gaming out there.
1345980	1350540	You know, I think it would be brilliant if Google partnered up with Valve or something so
1350540	1354220	that when you buy a game on Steam, you can either install it to your computer or you can
1354220	1359700	play in the cloud. And imagine imagine if like demos were available through the cloud.
1359700	1364340	I think so many people want to be doing demos in the cloud where you don't have to wait
1364340	1365380	and download all this stuff.
1365380	1369740	And again, look at a place like Steam when they do like the developer days where they
1369740	1372540	fill up the front page with like 40 different demos.
1372700	1374900	And it's like they all look neat and you want to try them.
1374900	1378660	But like click, download, wait, start.
1378660	1380900	OK, I didn't I didn't care for that one.
1380900	1384660	Uninstalled. Why can't you just click a fucking button and play the game?
1386820	1392420	I don't know. Amazon has it where you can click a button and you can get Tide Pod sent
1392420	1393460	to your house tomorrow.
1394020	1395500	Why don't we have that for games?
1396740	1400420	I think we do have it in certain places, but Google should be enabling that here.
1400580	1407300	You know, so I feel like there are still places where Stadia could kind of carve a niche
1407300	1411660	for itself, but it's just it's not going to be the fourth console or whatever.
1412900	1418420	So. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, because it's patented, I don't know if the game
1418420	1421500	delivery thing is maybe that is patented, I don't know.
1421900	1425300	The Amazon thing, though, you went over that on your show last week and that patent
1425300	1426580	expired a couple of years ago.
1426580	1429540	I do believe you recapped at the end there.
1429540	1432380	So one click ordering is is open.
1432380	1435100	So I don't know about I don't know if there's a patent for one click gaming.
1435100	1439660	You're right. Maybe somebody's patented that already, which is a whole other issue.
1440300	1442900	But I don't have time to get into that on this three hour show.
1442900	1452260	So SSU 100 Matt in chat says, could they just be looking to go the epic route and pay
1452260	1454940	loads for exclusives, exclusive games?
1455260	1457540	I don't want to see that happen, but it's possible.
1457820	1459460	You're right. It's possible.
1459460	1463380	And if Google is going to do that, they should probably make that they should have made
1463380	1469580	that move with this announcement and and kind of I get you don't want to see it.
1469580	1474260	But if Google wanted to show they were serious with this whole we're changing our model
1474260	1479020	or whatever, then they would have announced whatever game, even though we are developing
1479020	1484420	our own game anymore. We have obtained the exclusive rights to distribute that whatever
1484420	1487860	title they come up with to kind of immediately fill in the gap.
1487900	1490060	They didn't do that. And I don't think that was a great idea.
1490740	1494220	I'm not sure Stadia was incredibly well managed as it is.
1494780	1497140	And then we have to remember Phil Harrison's in charge.
1497220	1500380	And what what what has Phil Harrison done for gaming?
1501020	1505940	Like, if you look at his resume, he was in a lot of companies during their low points.
1506740	1507980	Sorry, not sorry.
1507980	1510660	I let the facts speak for themselves.
1510900	1514700	So maybe Stadia just needs somebody else running it.
1515220	1522420	Sorry. So, yeah, anyway, cloud gaming, I'm sure is not done for.
1522420	1527500	In fact, we're a long way from that because, you know, Nvidia, I like the Nvidia thing
1527500	1530780	that I kind of messed around with once because you can kind of use it for free and you can
1530780	1532060	use it with your Steam library.
1532500	1534060	And No Man's Sky was on there.
1534180	1538300	I didn't feel like No Man's Sky looked any better than it did if I'm running it on my own
1538300	1542140	computer. But it was a neat little experiment.
1542140	1545020	So, you know, there's that Amazon had their own.
1545020	1548460	But then, you know, Amazon is having a lot of struggles making their own game as well.
1548460	1552300	We all know that. I just I just again, I would love to see.
1552300	1557460	Like in the PlayStation stores, I want Sony to to get this technology or something because
1557460	1563340	we know Microsoft's got it because Microsoft is I still kind of like that cloud thing is
1563340	1567340	coming. Yes, I know they are still you can do it with your phones and controller and
1567340	1575500	stuff. But I think when it arrives where on my Xbox 360, I can run a cloud X cloud app
1575500	1579340	and play Halo Master Chief collection through the cloud or so.
1579340	1585220	I think that will be a great use case argument by Microsoft, but we're not not just there
1585220	1587220	yet, but maybe by the end of the year.
1587220	1593740	We'll see. And then Microsoft will have the ability to say, OK, well, for your, you know,
1593740	1597900	fifteen dollar a month or whatever they're charging for now for Microsoft Game Pass.
1598100	1603420	Yes, you get all these games in the cloud because a lot of Game Pass games are also tied
1603420	1604940	into X Cloud right now.
1605100	1609860	And so Microsoft will be able to deliver that Netflix perception that the audience was
1609860	1611300	associating with Google Stadia.
1612700	1614220	There is that so.
1614740	1618860	All right, well, if we got nothing else to say on Stadia, if you want to email us and
1618860	1624940	give us your thoughts on all of this, you sure can participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1625220	1630380	SSJ 100 Matt says, I mean, it's still the best and most stable place to play cyberpunk.
1631060	1635900	Why Google is not able to better leverage that, I'll never understand.
1637140	1640620	Again, it's all adding up to part of the thing where I'm like, I just think Stadia just in
1640620	1642220	general just isn't being run well.
1643660	1647780	All right, moving on, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we've
1647780	1648860	been playing this week.
1649100	1653620	Loki, I feel like we kind of covered it, but did you get a chance to play any games besides
1653620	1654420	developing your own?
1655260	1664580	I played a little bit of Orna and a little bit of Pokemon Go as well.
1665260	1667940	That was a very, very minimal.
1668100	1669980	It's been mostly just working on my game this week.
1670660	1671660	I figured as much.
1671660	1674220	It's probably been taking up most of your week.
1674500	1678620	Well, I look forward to your game releasing so you can actually play some other games this
1678620	1679060	next year.
1679500	1680180	Yes, me too.
1681140	1684300	All right, going back to the last story a little bit to get a comment here.
1684300	1688700	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says they did mention cyberpunk in the first paragraph of their
1688700	1690980	blog, so they're trying to reference it.
1691220	1695940	I think that's probably the worst place they could reference it if they want me to take it
1695940	1696700	seriously.
1696900	1698860	And maybe they've done this.
1698860	1700540	I don't know, but I haven't seen it.
1701220	1706700	Buy a Twitch ad, buy a pre-roll Twitch ad that says cyberpunk on Stadia, best place to play
1706700	1710820	with the quotes, best place to experience cyberpunk, smoothest experience.
1711020	1713100	I don't use the pull quotes.
1713260	1714860	It should be on Twitch pre-roll ads.
1714860	1719300	It should be on a commercial on TV during that little little dog and pony show they got
1719300	1720020	going right now.
1720220	1723900	That should be an ad, although, of course, it costs millions of dollars.
1724100	1728900	So maybe they'll have to go to the network that literally has the dog and pony show with
1728900	1731820	the cheaper ads right now, the counterprogramming.
1731940	1734500	But they should be putting that stuff out there.
1734740	1741100	So it's, you know, burying it in a press release isn't exactly informing the public and
1741100	1742580	trying to shift the perception.
1742620	1743980	That's just my thing.
1744500	1750420	All right. Black Compat in chat says, I'm currently playing God of War again, but this
1750420	1751820	time on my PlayStation 5.
1751820	1752700	It's so pretty.
1752940	1757980	Yeah, because they went back and they did like a little upgrade patch, didn't they, on
1757980	1761340	that? Like they did like a whole like PS5 kind of patching for that.
1761340	1763980	So if you're you're playing it on your PlayStation 5, you get a little something,
1763980	1766620	something extra. I hope we see that for some more games.
1767020	1768220	So I do.
1768260	1769220	I do hope so.
1769220	1773580	You know, I do hope Sony starts to get into this cloud stuff, too.
1774260	1775580	But we'll see. We'll see.
1776260	1777900	All right. Moving on.
1778660	1779980	Let's talk about my gaming week.
1780340	1784220	So honestly, I've continued to play a lot of Final Fantasy 14.
1784500	1788460	In fact, I even did a whole stream about Final Fantasy 14 on Friday here at VOG Network.
1788700	1790700	But we'll get into that story in a little bit.
1790700	1792820	I mean, see, it's coming up here on the show.
1793060	1794620	So we'll talk about that a little bit.
1795060	1797860	Outside of Final Fantasy 14, I've been playing a lot, a lot.
1797860	1801540	I've been, of course, playing, you know, the GPS games, Pokemon Go.
1801660	1806460	I was able to catch a lot of the Rosalie's today, the shiny ones.
1806460	1811060	I got like 12 of them, kind of more than I usually get on a shiny day.
1811060	1812740	I think I might have been like 15.
1812860	1814660	I lost count. That's how many I got.
1815420	1818580	So and that's that's one of my favorite Pokemon, actually.
1818620	1821620	So I'm glad I got a lot of shinies of that one.
1822380	1824100	So that was that was fun.
1824100	1827620	As far as like other games I've been playing, there is a new game
1827620	1830420	I checked out this week, thanks to Xbox Game Pass.
1831180	1833460	It's called Cyber Shadow.
1833460	1836660	That's Cyber something Cyber Shadow I checked out this week.
1836660	1839700	So Cyber Shadow is by Yacht Club Games,
1840060	1842580	which was the company that brought a Shovel Knight.
1842900	1845780	So this is kind of like their next game.
1845980	1849340	So Shovel Knight, of course, was a very retro inspired game
1849340	1852860	that really invoked kind of a lot of the old Capcom classic
1853100	1855180	carts like DuckTales and things like that.
1855180	1857220	Of course, Shovel Knight kind of put its own spin on it.
1857980	1860140	So Cyber Shadow is kind of that.
1860140	1863580	But for Ninja Gaiden, which
1864620	1867220	but but to just say very much Ninja Gaiden
1867940	1872620	to just say it's a clone of that, though, I don't think is accurate.
1872620	1877420	It definitely has like the play feel of it is very that.
1877700	1880140	But a lot of the boss design is very different.
1880140	1883580	A lot of the level design is different because I noticed this
1883580	1884500	a little ways into it.
1884500	1887860	There are like secret areas and places where there's blocks
1887860	1890260	that you can crush to kind of find a whole other area.
1890460	1894420	And I after like admittedly, I've only played a couple of stages into it.
1894580	1898300	But looking at the map, it looks like you might have to backtrack
1898300	1902380	Blaster Master style to kind of go visit other areas.
1902620	1904380	Like it's not just linear.
1904380	1906140	It seems like there might be power ups
1906140	1908580	and things that allow you to carve out a different path.
1909540	1912260	So I think there might be a little bit of like Ninja Gaiden
1912260	1915260	meets Master Blaster in that.
1915260	1918500	So I think and that's that's fine by me.
1920380	1923940	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, yeah, feels very Ninja Gaiden
1923940	1925620	inspired and super tough.
1925620	1929380	It is definitely there is no Bobby Black Wolf mode, I'm sorry to say.
1930060	1931460	It is a challenging game.
1931460	1934460	However, it does appear you have infinite lives.
1934660	1937780	And so it's not like Ninja Gaiden where like you lose three lives
1937780	1940060	and you have to go all the way back to the beginning of the act.
1940380	1943340	You just every time you die, you just respond at a save point.
1943540	1945540	So there is that.
1945540	1948700	So it feels a little more like maybe Super Meat Boy in that sense,
1948700	1951860	because you're playing relatively short little bursts
1952020	1953660	to get to the next save point.
1953660	1955620	And you don't have to go like all the way back,
1955620	1958420	which was the thing that was really tough about something like Ninja Gaiden.
1959220	1962140	So, you know, again, that's another way that it's kind of different
1962620	1965420	from the Ninja Gaiden formula where I don't want to say, oh,
1965420	1968900	this is just a clone of that game, because it definitely has
1969540	1973060	its own differences that make even a nails
1973060	1975540	tough game a little bit.
1976780	1979260	Easier to stomach, if that makes sense.
1979660	1982220	So but I'm enjoying it, I want to play more of it.
1982220	1984420	And I even got some achievements.
1984420	1986340	Bobby in chat is like, no, me mode.
1986820	1987900	I'm going to tell you, Bobby,
1987900	1991140	why this mode is or why this game is not going to make you happy,
1991380	1993580	because I popped two achievements.
1994180	1999060	One of them was worth 16 points and the other one was worth, I think, 31 points.
1999420	2002180	So it violates Bobby's multiple of five thing
2003580	2006660	where, you know, and maybe other people have this, too,
2006660	2011380	where you get a little about my gamer score must end in zero or five.
2011380	2015580	I have I have no place for a 16 or 31 or whatever it is.
2015900	2020340	So I think on that principle, it's going to lose Bobby support.
2020900	2024220	But if you don't, if you're if your gamer score has already been ruined
2024220	2028340	by something else or you really don't give a rat's ass about it like me,
2029100	2032660	it's on Game Pass for PC and Xbox.
2032860	2034620	So if you're on that Game Pass thing,
2034620	2037620	you really should just go check it out because you're already paying for it.
2037780	2039780	So go make use of what you're paying for.
2039780	2041820	It's a good game in that regard.
2041820	2044300	So have you you know about it, Loki, right?
2044300	2045700	But you just haven't played it.
2045700	2048900	Yeah, I'm well aware of it because, you know, it looked very much
2048900	2052140	like Ninja Gaiden, like even down to the sprites and everything.
2053820	2056220	So, yeah, very, very aware of it.
2056220	2060140	Yeah. Even the first boss was like not even like Ninja Gaiden's
2060140	2063300	first boss was like like you just duck and attack a bunch.
2063300	2066620	You win. This one was way it was like a three pronged thing
2066620	2069380	where you kind of had to like hit the middle when it came down
2069380	2071060	and then dodge the guns on the other two.
2071060	2073140	It was much more complicated.
2073140	2076580	Like so it is interesting how even something that's retro
2076580	2080580	inspired can kind of do things that they just really didn't do a lot
2080580	2084580	on eight bit hardware, whether it's the limitations or whatever it is.
2085260	2090340	Can you imagine, Loki, if you had made Pixel Poops 2 just retro inspired,
2090340	2094460	but you made it for like the Xbox where you don't have to worry about the space.
2094820	2096260	You can do whatever you want.
2096260	2100500	Yeah. So now you have to go back to a remaster or something like that.
2100700	2103020	Now you have to go back and make it all 16 by nine.
2103140	2107700	Just make the play fields bigger.
2107740	2110940	Yeah, that would be nice, you know, having, you know,
2111340	2114540	not to adhere to the NES stuff.
2115220	2118620	But Pixel Poops, Pixel Poops 3, please look forward to it.
2118620	2124020	All right. Well, Pixel Poops 3 is going to be Pixel Poops 3D at that point.
2125140	2126900	Oh, Virtual Boy game. Awesome.
2126900	2129380	I can't wait. Yeah, there you go. Yeah.
2129380	2132100	All right. Let's get into some gaming news.
2132100	2134700	What else has been going on around the gaming world this week?
2134700	2136700	Loki, what do you got for us?
2136700	2139340	All right. So let's see.
2139340	2142180	We've got this is kind of unique.
2142940	2146220	There's a PlayStation game coming to the Xbox.
2146740	2151380	So much like dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria.
2152020	2156300	So like much like how we have, you know, Microsoft publishing,
2156500	2158700	you know, Minecraft on other platforms.
2158940	2162260	Mario and Sonic at the at the Olympics that never happened.
2163300	2169700	Yes. And then also we have now MLB The Show 21,
2169700	2174060	which is a PlayStation Studios title now coming to the Xbox
2174060	2178340	one and Xbox Series X starting this April.
2178820	2182380	So that is the first that used to be a PlayStation exclusive.
2182380	2186100	And well, you know, I guess we just need more baseball out there
2186100	2190060	because honestly, I think aside from MLB 2K,
2190060	2191940	which I don't think even exists anymore,
2193580	2196460	PlayStation was like the only place you can get a baseball game.
2196460	2200740	So it's nice to see that that is multi platform now.
2200780	2204340	I believe we had a story several months ago.
2204340	2205740	We knew this was coming
2205740	2209140	because it had something to do with retaining the license.
2209180	2213020	Like Sony would not be able to continue to hold the license for that
2213260	2215220	if they didn't put the game out on other consoles.
2215220	2217260	I want to say that's what was playing up.
2217260	2219100	Yep. And I'm looking in chat. There it is.
2219100	2222500	Bobby in chat says MLB mandated this or else they were going to pull the license.
2222500	2224780	They wanted a sim game on all consoles.
2224780	2226700	They had the exclusive sim license.
2226700	2227980	Yeah, I remember.
2227980	2232500	See, I remember something from a few months ago where we actually knew
2232500	2234700	this was coming. It's just it's finally here.
2234700	2239100	And it's it's that shock of seeing a Sony PlayStation
2239100	2241020	studio logo on an Xbox.
2241020	2242180	You think it'll come to Game Pass?
2243020	2245820	Mm hmm. I doubt it.
2246980	2248580	We'll see. I don't know.
2248580	2249580	As soon as possible.
2249580	2250900	As soon as Matt is pointing out,
2250900	2254060	EA lost the license or really let it go years ago.
2254060	2257780	So this is, you know, even though, yes, there's other baseball sims,
2258260	2261220	this is the only, you know, MLB
2261220	2263940	endorsed one that actually has MLB players in it.
2265500	2269660	Does Konami make a why do I feel like Konami makes a baseball game?
2270580	2272780	I don't know why my brain is.
2272780	2275580	Well, they have the power of pro like baseball game.
2275620	2278460	It's like the kind of anime.
2278460	2280420	This was not real, but it's not MLB.
2280420	2281780	It's just fantasy.
2281780	2284540	MLB. So it's like baseball stars or something. Yeah.
2285180	2287620	Yeah. Yeah. MLB 2K.
2288100	2291940	Back in the day, like way back in the day, EA had an MLB game.
2293900	2297020	I think even they have like
2297020	2299220	I don't know if they had college baseball as well.
2299220	2302900	EA used to have a ton of sports games and they kind of slimmed it down a bit.
2302900	2305980	But I mean, oh, I forgot about that.
2305980	2307420	That's going back as a 200.
2307420	2312300	Matt says they do have RBI baseball, but that game is more made in house by MLB.
2313100	2317420	Sean 322 clarifies has real players, but it's more animated.
2317700	2321060	And Bobby kind of clarifies that as arcadey. So.
2323980	2326300	So it's still it's still going to be that shock.
2326540	2331740	Do you think Sony may experiment putting anything else out on Microsoft's consoles?
2331740	2335540	Probably not unless they're forced to. No, I doubt it. Yeah, I doubt it, too.
2337100	2338900	But what about you know, there's always that rumor
2338900	2341620	about Microsoft trying to put their stuff on other consoles, too.
2342180	2344700	Do you think we might see some of their studios open up?
2345100	2347980	I think it's certainly possible, especially when we're talking about
2347980	2351100	things like Bethesda, which Microsoft now owns.
2351340	2354700	Like, I think a lot of those games are still going to come out on Sony
2354700	2358180	and even whatever works for the Nintendo switch, they'll put out
2358180	2359500	on the Nintendo switch.
2359500	2361900	So it is interesting that we're all kind of losing our shit
2361900	2364420	overseeing a Sony logo on a Microsoft box.
2364700	2369260	But like, I think we're all kind of prepared for at least Microsoft assets
2369580	2371580	to show up on other consoles.
2371580	2373980	It may just not have a Microsoft logo on it.
2373980	2377140	It may have Bethesda's logo, but that's going to happen.
2377860	2381100	So, yeah, it's kind of interesting. So
2382060	2383460	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says
2383460	2386580	the new Bethesda games will not go to switch or PS5.
2386820	2389820	There's no way the Elder Scrolls six will be on any console,
2389820	2392060	not in the Xbox ecosystem.
2392540	2396580	Have they I have they clarified that because I thought they said
2396580	2399460	they did interviews where they were actually pushing the opposite narrative
2399700	2403260	where the guy was saying, well, we haven't made any decisions on that yet.
2403260	2404420	You know, and you can you know,
2404420	2407100	you can maybe read the tea leaves where it's going to go that way.
2407500	2410860	I feel like it might happen.
2410980	2414020	But and this is a big but.
2414020	2416700	Microsoft's going to have the must have version.
2416900	2420020	There's going to be a bunch of shit that's cut out for the other stuff.
2420060	2422420	It's going to be like
2422940	2425700	when Destiny first came out.
2426180	2429500	It had like a whole extra zone on PlayStation
2429500	2431500	that wasn't even on the Microsoft version.
2431500	2435540	And Sony was like pushing it almost like it was one of their own exclusive games
2435900	2440580	because they had such a great deal with Activision to get all this exclusive stuff.
2440860	2443900	I feel like that could be kind of a middle ground
2444220	2447220	where Microsoft still has like the must have version.
2447420	2451900	But they they they give a little little pittance to the other ecosystems.
2452340	2453780	So we'll see.
2455540	2459220	Bobby says, but if you want to play Elder Scrolls six, you'll need an Xbox.
2459420	2462980	Just like if you want to play God of War, you need a PlayStation or a PC.
2463980	2467700	Or a PC for probably either of those games,
2467700	2471620	eventually, the way some of the other Sony things have been going as of late.
2471620	2475100	So we'll we'll give that one to the PC fanboys.
2475140	2476020	All right.
2476020	2479420	Anyhow, let's move on and talk about some other news that came out this week.
2479420	2481580	And this news is very exciting for me,
2482260	2486260	which was the new Final Fantasy 14 expansion that was announced.
2486460	2490340	And of course, I talk a lot in my gaming weeks about how I play a lot
2490340	2491820	of Final Fantasy 14.
2491820	2495980	So, of course, I was very excited to watch this announcement showcase
2495980	2497220	that they did on Friday,
2497220	2501820	because essentially this was the event that I'd gone to in Vegas three times.
2502020	2504820	Now, we all know why it didn't happen in person this time
2504820	2507020	and why it was delayed a few months. Hello, Covid.
2507820	2511220	But they finally kind of gave us the information
2511420	2513460	that we would have got at the scheduled.
2513460	2515700	Actually, they were going to move it this year to San Diego.
2515940	2519980	They had announced that just before the pandemic started was that, oh, yeah,
2519980	2523420	we're going to do Fan Fest in October, but it's in San Diego this time.
2523420	2525300	So for whatever reason, they were moving it.
2525300	2527780	And then, of course, they they called it off altogether.
2528860	2531300	So we got some of the information about the new expansion.
2531500	2535580	And as Loki kind of referred to earlier in the show, it is called Endwalker,
2535820	2539100	which I love it because you can abbreviate it as Ew for short.
2539140	2540740	Ew, David.
2540740	2544100	But now it's Ew. Ew, Yoshi P.
2544500	2548300	Anyway, it's going to be coming out this fall, so it will be out this year.
2548540	2550420	One of the things that they showcased
2550420	2555580	as part of the event was a new healer job, which is the first healer job
2555580	2558100	they've put in the game since Astrologian,
2558500	2562140	which, if I remember right, would have been 2018,
2562460	2568340	2015 was when Heaven's Word came out and the Astrologian.
2569620	2572340	So it's been a little while since we had a healer in the game, so Sage
2572660	2574660	and Sage is a barrier healer.
2574700	2578420	There will be a melee DPS, but we don't know what it is yet.
2578620	2581420	A lot of sleuths on Reddit and people that I know
2581980	2585620	are trying to figure it out from some of the things that were in the trailer.
2585980	2591820	It is believed that there is multiple cases where a scythe has been visible
2591820	2595300	and some of the T-shirts that Yoshi P was wearing
2595300	2598820	have referenced a reaper or a scythe type of character.
2599020	2601500	So people are kind of going that direction with it,
2601500	2603900	that it will be some type of DPS that wields a scythe.
2604500	2607580	It was also clarified in a Japanese interview that Yoshi P did.
2608460	2611580	The class will share gear with Dragoon,
2611820	2614100	which means it's going to be a strength based class,
2614100	2616500	not a dexterity based class like Ninja would use.
2616500	2618620	So there is all of that coming into it.
2618860	2621060	A lot of people thinking we're getting some type of,
2621180	2624500	some people are saying necromancer, some people are saying like a reaper.
2624700	2627900	I think Final Fantasy 14 has done this very well,
2627900	2632660	where they've kind of invented their own classes based around Final Fantasy history.
2632740	2636380	So I think we're going to get some type of scythe based melee class
2637180	2639900	that will be the class that people thought Dark Knight would be.
2640900	2641700	So there will be that.
2642260	2646460	So let's see some other things that they announced.
2646780	2649260	This will be the end of the story.
2649260	2653140	They have started the story with Zodiark and Hydaelyn
2653460	2656260	all the way back in 1.0 and Realm Reborn, really.
2656780	2657740	This will be the end of that.
2657740	2660820	However, and they stress this many times, many times,
2661020	2663460	this will not be the end of Final Fantasy 14.
2663820	2666460	This will not be the end of Yoshi P's involvement.
2667260	2671100	I think one way to kind of equate it is that this is the end of Marvel
2671100	2675060	Cinematic Universe Part One, and then Marvel Cinematic Universe
2675060	2677260	Part Two will begin in patch 6.1.
2677420	2678820	So this is this.
2678820	2683100	This is end game coming out and Walker and game, huh?
2683100	2685740	Huh? OK, so there's that.
2685940	2690460	So and then after this will be like a new kind of Final Fantasy 14 era.
2690700	2691780	I thought it was very neat
2691780	2695340	that Yoshi P came out and said, I see this as my life's work
2697300	2700460	because, you know, with his involvement producing, but not directing
2700700	2704740	Final Fantasy 16, some folks have kind of wondered what his future is.
2704740	2707540	And I would assume it's inevitable
2707540	2711660	that Final Fantasy 17 or 18 is another MMO.
2711900	2713180	Why wouldn't they?
2713180	2716220	And why wouldn't they want Yoshi P to be involved somehow?
2716820	2718780	But it's not happening yet.
2718820	2721940	So Yoshi P is staying with Final Fantasy 14.
2722780	2724660	The other big news that was announced,
2724660	2727180	a PlayStation five version of the game will be coming out
2727540	2730820	and it will begin in a beta on April 13th.
2730820	2732500	And this is the best news.
2732500	2735340	You don't have to buy the PlayStation five version
2735340	2738660	if you already own the PlayStation four version.
2739380	2742420	Yeah, you can just roll over that license to PlayStation five.
2742860	2745220	Actually, no, you don't even have to roll over a license.
2745220	2748340	It just is looking for your PS4 license, basically, which is great.
2749020	2753140	Some may recall when the game first came out, Realm Reborn
2753140	2756660	and I think the first expansion Heavensward were on PlayStation three.
2756900	2759780	When they finally sunset it, you can no longer play Realm Reborn
2759900	2762180	or excuse me, Final Fantasy 14 on PlayStation three.
2762420	2765540	They terminated that support, but they gave you a year,
2765540	2769020	maybe a year and a half, where they said you can convert
2769020	2771820	your PlayStation three license to a PlayStation four license.
2772020	2774780	But once you do it, you can't go back to PlayStation three.
2774980	2777980	So this is but they didn't really put that same quantifier
2777980	2779940	on this PS5 rollover.
2779940	2782620	But if you own a PlayStation five,
2783180	2785940	why would you want to go back and play this on PlayStation four?
2786140	2787780	Play it on PlayStation five.
2787780	2790700	I I suppose everybody's situation is unique
2790860	2793780	and maybe the PlayStation five isn't in the place that you want to play.
2793780	2794620	I don't know.
2794620	2798340	But I think for most people, they're going to be very happy with this news.
2798700	2802780	There will be a virtual fan fest coming up in May 15th and 16th,
2802980	2807140	where the rest of the expansion's details will be unearthed.
2807380	2810580	And they didn't stop there because they still have a whole nother patch
2810580	2813620	for the current expansion, Shadowbringers, that they went on
2813620	2815340	and detailed later that night.
2815340	2817140	We didn't stream that one
2817140	2820540	because as I figured, it was mostly stuff we were expecting.
2820740	2822740	It was here's a new dungeon.
2822900	2824940	We're adding story content here.
2824940	2829260	It's kind of the only maybe thing you could say about Final Fantasy 14.
2829260	2832100	I think it's they've supported it very well.
2833140	2835340	The game gets regular patches.
2835340	2838700	But I think one of the ways they're able to make the game regular
2838700	2840780	is it's very formulaic.
2840780	2844740	Like the odd number patch is when you get the new 24 man raid
2844740	2847860	and you get one new dungeon and you get this amount of story.
2847980	2850420	The even numbered patch, you get the new eight man raid
2850420	2851620	and you might get one trial.
2851620	2855220	And so it's it's it's like we kind of all knew what was coming
2855220	2856220	before we watched it.
2856220	2857700	So there was that.
2857700	2859700	But you know what? It's Final Fantasy 14.
2859860	2861940	The story is great. I love the game.
2862900	2863860	I'm still eating it up.
2863860	2866500	Even if I'm saying that's it.
2866500	2869300	So. All right.
2869300	2871580	So, yeah, looking forward to the Final Fantasy 14 expansion
2871580	2872900	coming out later this year.
2872900	2876140	I'm sure I will talk plenty more about it because it is one of my favorite games.
2876500	2878940	Oh, I have to say this, too.
2878940	2884140	Loved that there was so much Final Fantasy four inspiration in the game.
2884660	2887900	It's the one Final Fantasy that I feel like doesn't have a lot of representation
2887900	2889860	in the game right now, and it's one of my favorites.
2889860	2893180	And so I love that they're really going full tilt with this.
2893540	2896740	You can get a lunar whale mount, an eight person mount
2897020	2900820	if you get like a fan fest ticket.
2900820	2902980	So you have to pay money for it. But still.
2902980	2905100	And they played some of the music.
2905100	2910140	So their music guy, Soken, who is like the Final Fantasy 14 soundtrack is stunning.
2910380	2913300	If you've never heard it, you really owe it to yourself to listen to some tracks
2913300	2918940	from Final Fantasy 14 soundtrack, because Soken is is proving himself
2919300	2923500	in every way to be an heir to that legacy's music
2923500	2927060	and what Nobui Matsu started many, many, many years ago.
2927060	2929100	Soken is really fucking good.
2929100	2933300	And he reinterpreted the Final Fantasy four like moon theme
2933300	2934900	or like the lunar whale theme.
2934900	2936420	It's so good. You have to hear it.
2936420	2938540	So I'm really excited about that.
2938540	2939940	And of course, you know, you're going to the moon.
2939940	2943300	They're putting out minions for Rosa, Edge and Rydia
2943580	2946020	that are going to be part of the virtual fan fest.
2946020	2947500	I'm really excited about all of that.
2947500	2949940	So loving the Final Fantasy four love.
2949940	2951100	Thank you very much.
2951100	2953260	OK, now I'm done talking about Final Fantasy 14.
2953260	2954820	We can talk about other video games.
2954820	2957060	Loki, what do you have for us?
2957460	2960260	It's finishing up some some editing anyways.
2960300	2962980	Are you working on your game now during the show?
2964060	2965300	Of course you are.
2965300	2967580	I was just making some changes to Wikipedia, that's all.
2968260	2971220	Anyways. Oh, doing some marketing, I see.
2972140	2974060	Yeah. So anyways,
2974980	2978620	we've got news about what might have been.
2978620	2984300	So Netflix was originally going to have a Zelda show,
2984300	2990380	but it then pulled it back because it leaked out that it was coming out.
2990700	2994460	So apparently this was a while ago and back in 2015.
2995340	2999020	It was that long ago because I remember these rumors like they were the other day.
2999900	3001300	I thought it was like two years ago.
3001300	3003300	Anyway, it was it was a long time ago.
3003540	3005060	Actually, probably even before that.
3005060	3008660	So they said that during this was kind of
3009780	3012020	that came out when they were talking about,
3012460	3016780	I guess, this College Humor stop motion Star Fox thing that they were working on.
3016980	3019100	The fantastic Mr. Star Fox.
3019100	3020940	It came out in 2011.
3020940	3024380	And so apparently because around that time
3025180	3028220	there was reports that Netflix wasn't going to do Legends of Zelda anymore
3028820	3033220	because basically that it had leaked out that they were going to be doing
3033220	3039420	the Legend of Zelda show and that kind of, I don't know, spooked Nintendo,
3039420	3041700	but basically say, hey, listen, we're not going to do it anymore
3041700	3044140	now that it's leaked out that we were going to do that.
3044140	3047780	Seems silly to me that that would be a thing. But.
3048820	3051580	Nintendo be Nintendo, I guess so.
3052340	3053540	We can't have Zelda.
3053540	3056780	We can't have nice things because you guys won't stop leaking information about it.
3057820	3061060	Maybe they were worried that a lot more was going to leak out before it was ready.
3061060	3064740	It does seem like an odd reason to pull the plug completely on a project as well.
3064940	3069900	In fact, usually usually the hype machine is kind of a big deal in Hollywood.
3069900	3073660	I don't know if this is just I admit I'm a little ignorant to this, so I apologize.
3073660	3077780	But I don't know if this may be a culture thing around like Japanese culture
3077780	3082420	and the hype for cinema and TV and projects around there and our culture,
3082420	3086740	because like we find out about projects before somebody's ever even been cast.
3087100	3089820	You know, Marvel gets out there on stage and says,
3089940	3094740	here's the roadmap for Marvel Cinematic Universe phase two all the way through 2025
3095100	3098540	before we've even like inked a deal to write a fucking script.
3098820	3100700	Like that's just part of the height.
3100700	3103300	Like y'all think video games are announced too early.
3103460	3105380	Look at fucking movies, OK?
3105380	3106980	Like we find out about this.
3106980	3111500	So to find out that a project is being started years before they've even shot
3111500	3115340	one frame or anything is very much a part of like the Hollywood Entertainment
3115340	3120660	Tonight, Access Hollywood variety deadline and all that type of culture.
3121180	3124580	I wonder if it's just and I again, I'm saying I am ignorant.
3124580	3128500	I don't know how this works in Japan because I haven't lived there
3128500	3132260	or followed enough of their culture there where maybe it is not
3132260	3134180	the same type of hype machine.
3134180	3137780	So when Nintendo kind of heard that this was going on,
3137820	3140940	they saw it as a threat and they pulled the plug.
3141940	3143180	That's my only that's all.
3143180	3145060	That's all I've got to go off of, honestly,
3145060	3149460	because you just don't usually hear about these things stopping because of leaks.
3149460	3152420	But also, Nintendo is fiercely protective of its properties
3153140	3154740	for better and for worse.
3154740	3156380	So. Yeah.
3156380	3158860	So, I mean, it's unfortunate.
3159180	3162500	Does this mean we're not getting the Switch Pro anymore because it's leaked out?
3162500	3166820	You know that there are lots of information allegedly has leaked out about it.
3166820	3168060	You know that it's coming.
3168060	3170260	So does that mean we're not getting that anymore?
3170740	3172300	I doubt it.
3172300	3175820	Tiger Con Chat says also Nintendo is banking on that Super Mario
3175820	3177260	Brothers animated movie.
3177260	3181260	It could make or break them in terms of making movies from some of their IPs.
3181620	3185260	Could you could Universal have approached them when the rumor came out and said,
3185460	3189100	hey, we can do something better, but you've got to call this deal off?
3189140	3193220	I don't know. Maybe I'm no, I'm adding I'm adding too much drama into it.
3194260	3196220	I don't I don't think that was.
3196220	3199860	Yeah, I don't think that's going to be a anything has to do with it.
3200260	3204300	I think if anything now, I mean, because I mean, granted, this took place
3204300	3208820	like years ago, I mean, look at like what we have on Netflix now.
3208820	3213100	There's like so many series based off of video games that done really well.
3213420	3216660	So I would think that they'd be less hesitant to put out something now.
3218420	3220180	Maybe there's something in development
3220180	3223020	and just hasn't been leaked out because they learned the lesson the first time.
3223020	3223620	I don't know.
3223620	3229420	So it's I doubt that now if something like that were to happen,
3229420	3232620	I would think that they would be ahead of it, kind of trying to promote it a bit.
3233660	3235500	Then again, Nintendo's weird.
3235500	3237980	And so who knows? Who knows?
3237980	3240740	All right. What else you have for us, Loki?
3240740	3243700	All right. So apparently,
3244140	3249460	you know, we had the Mario sets come out for Lego now, and technically we had a
3249700	3255980	Sonic the Hedgehog set come out in the form of a pack for Lego dimensions.
3256220	3259580	But now, thanks to the whole,
3261180	3265620	you know, fan submission process that they have available for Lego ideas,
3265900	3270380	it's there is a set that reached 10,000 fan supporters,
3270380	3273100	which means it goes through the Lego review process.
3273380	3277380	And Lego has decided that, yes, we will go ahead and make a Sonic
3277700	3280820	Green Hills set for Lego.
3280820	3284460	So it's got right now based on the initial prototype
3284460	3289300	was like this giant Eggman robot, Sonic the Hedgehog minifigs
3289300	3294140	and, you know, some stuff that you would see in Green Hill Zone.
3294500	3299140	But I would imagine we might see some more sets based on that if it sells well.
3299140	3301900	But it's still pretty cool that that's going to be a thing.
3301940	3306020	No word on necessarily when it's coming, but I'd expect sometime later this year.
3307460	3308580	That's pretty exciting.
3308580	3310060	I think it makes sense.
3310060	3312740	They've already had that mold for the Sonic character already.
3312740	3314540	So that's kind of half the battle right there.
3316780	3320140	Yeah, it'll be interesting to check it out.
3320580	3324180	I'm curious to see if they'll gamify it at all, kind of like the Mario one.
3324860	3327580	Well, there's some impressive technology there.
3327580	3329500	I mean, yeah, that would be cool. They did that.
3329500	3330380	I don't think so.
3330380	3333140	In this case, I think it'll just be like a set,
3333300	3336220	kind of like how the Minecraft sets aren't really gamified.
3336420	3339820	It's just, you know, Lego set.
3340380	3344580	I mean, it would be cool to have some more game type stuff with it.
3344580	3347380	I mean, Dimensions was pretty cool, but.
3347380	3351140	You know, I don't know, they don't sell that stuff anymore,
3351500	3355100	but at least, you know, they have the mold, so that saves them some time, I guess.
3355300	3357460	True. If they didn't destroy those.
3358500	3360740	No, they don't destroy that stuff.
3360740	3364100	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I mean, you can still play the Mario set with it.
3364340	3365180	You know, true.
3365180	3369060	You can make Mario versus Sonic happen in your imagination, in your house
3369060	3371260	with the dueling Lego sets.
3371260	3375540	Except Mario is going to be super huge compared to, you know, Sonic the Hedgehog.
3375660	3379460	Sonic is minifig size and Mario is much larger than that.
3379460	3382420	So I'm sure your imagination can make up the difference.
3382420	3383940	I have no imagination.
3383940	3386460	Sizes must be accurate.
3387060	3388980	I don't know. We'll see.
3388980	3390500	Yeah, I'm with Orange, right?
3390500	3392620	Mario just ate a mega mushroom. That's all.
3393500	3395540	All right. All right.
3395540	3398820	But Sonic goes fast. All right.
3398860	3401700	Let's move on and talk about a PlayStation 5 game
3402060	3405540	that's getting a surprising kind of little change here before it's out.
3406700	3411420	Destruction All-Stars has actually I'm sorry, it just recently released.
3411420	3412740	I didn't realize this actually came out.
3412740	3416460	Destruction All-Stars, the developer behind the game, Lucid Games,
3416460	3421340	has put out an update for the game and it disables voice chat by default.
3421940	3427540	In a tweet, they wrote, Lucid Games put All-Stars Hotfix 1.2.2 is live.
3427700	3431900	Hotfix note threads disabled multiplayer lobby voice communications
3431900	3434020	by default for all players.
3434260	3436900	We are actively working on longer term enhancements
3436900	3438940	to the voice communication system.
3438940	3442180	So apparently the way it was before
3442780	3447140	voice was on by default and it wasn't exactly easy to just mute everybody.
3447380	3451700	You had to go into your PlayStation 5 menu and disable voice chat there.
3452380	3455220	Otherwise, it would because even if you turned it off for your headset,
3455260	3459020	you would still get voices through the DualSense controller speaker.
3459260	3463980	And I'm sure there were no problems at all.
3463980	3466340	Are you saying people were saying naughty words through that?
3466340	3469660	You mean if you put a microphone and no accountability in front of somebody,
3469660	3472260	they're going to say some really shitty things you don't say.
3472420	3474940	But it wasn't just that.
3474940	3477500	But a lot of people don't even know that, like,
3477500	3479860	the DualSense has like a mic thing built in.
3480100	3483500	So some people didn't even know that they were transmitting.
3483700	3486020	So they would get background noise
3486260	3489540	that would come through, like the shifting around to the controller or the,
3489740	3493660	you know, you know, have you ever played like Mario Kart online or something?
3493660	3495860	And somebody blue shells you and you're like, fuck that guy.
3496060	3500180	And if you don't know that you're muted, it's going to come or not muted.
3500180	3501860	It's going to come through. Right.
3501860	3505260	Or the or here's here's the classic one, too.
3505420	3509260	You're playing a game and you're getting your ass kicked by somebody online.
3509340	3511580	And then all of a sudden you just hear coming through the speaker.
3511820	3517140	Mom, mom, I want the pizza rolls, mom.
3518340	3522700	Right. And again, somebody doesn't know
3523060	3525780	that their voice is being transmitted through the speaker.
3526180	3529980	So now you just found out you're getting your butt kicked by a little kid
3531020	3533940	who's waiting on pizza rolls.
3535660	3538700	However, unfortunately, the really shitty stuff online
3538700	3543100	was also making its way through a review on Ars Technica of the game
3543100	3549180	actually called out obscenities, racist slurs and an alt right podcast
3549180	3553140	featuring dark web and QAnon content that was played on replay,
3553420	3557380	because that's what you want to hear when you're trying to do your escapism.
3557380	3559580	Video games, I'm so sure.
3559940	3563780	So they they removed voice chat by default.
3563780	3567860	And actually, in this day and age, that's what most games do.
3567860	3570740	So it's a little surprising they didn't do that that way to start.
3571300	3573100	It's a very tough lesson to learn.
3573100	3577060	But I will tell you what, I don't voice chat on games, period,
3577420	3580620	unless I am playing a private game with people I know. That's it.
3581140	3583900	And then even then, it's usually not through the game.
3584100	3587660	It's usually through Discord, like just to make sure it's even
3588100	3590540	under a separate set up and because you never know.
3590540	3592220	Like it might be a PvP thing.
3592220	3595140	You don't even want your voice going over to the other team. So
3596140	3599260	see a Tiberian chat saying of my yelling.
3599420	3601860	I thought that was toad. It might have been.
3603260	3605300	It very well might have been.
3605300	3608020	All right. Moving on, Loki,
3608020	3610860	you got a story on something I'm very excited about.
3611820	3613500	You're excited about corrupted source code,
3613500	3615940	so you're not going to be able to get some of the DLC from Mass Effect.
3616260	3617860	That's a weird thing to be excited about.
3617860	3620420	I'm not that. All right. Shut up. Shut up.
3621420	3624900	But yeah, unfortunately, that tends to happen sometimes.
3624900	3628500	You know, you have something you want to re-release in like a 4K
3628500	3633580	legendary edition, you go back and up the source codes corrupted. Oh, no.
3633860	3639060	So apparently there is going to be some DLC missing.
3639060	3642140	So Pinnacle Station,
3642340	3646620	which I guess is the third of the Citadel DLC.
3647500	3652100	And I'm not sure, are they going to try to remake it?
3653260	3656100	Maybe not. No, it's Citadel's different.
3656100	3658380	Citadel's different DLC for part three.
3658580	3661020	Pinnacle Station was the third, I think,
3661460	3663740	DLC that they did for the first game.
3665100	3670260	And honestly, like, you know, some of the hardcore fans and stuff are like,
3670260	3671820	oh, it's a good.
3671820	3674820	But I'm like, honestly, there's so much fucking content.
3674860	3676620	You're not missing that much.
3676620	3678100	Like, calm down.
3678100	3679420	You're getting more.
3679420	3682300	You're getting more than the Wii U players got, OK?
3682500	3685860	The Wii U players for Mass Effect 3 got the first DLC
3686020	3687940	and then the entire development.
3687940	3689460	Fuck it. We're not doing the rest of it.
3689460	3692620	So I couldn't reverse engineer some of that stuff.
3692620	3693700	Maybe just don't want to.
3693700	3697660	But yeah, the reason why that this is not necessarily
3697660	3701140	something that's recoverable versus some of the other stuff is because it was based
3701540	3704500	or wasn't actually developed in the house by Bioware.
3704500	3707060	But is actually outsourced to demurge studios.
3707460	3711580	And I guess they don't have the original files
3711580	3713860	that are in an uncorrupted state.
3714380	3716660	So that's unfortunate.
3716660	3719420	But they said that, you know, they could bring it back.
3719420	3723060	But it'd take another six months just to do this with most of the team
3723060	3723700	that we've got.
3723700	3727220	And I wish we could do it, but we're not going to be able to.
3727540	3730780	So there's going to be so much like I'm telling you, those games take
3730780	3733940	like 30 to 40 hours to get through just the base content.
3733940	3735260	And you're getting three of them.
3735260	3737900	And then they're going to be adding a lot of DLC
3737900	3740820	that can be like six or seven hours on their own.
3741180	3744060	Like there's several of them for part two and three.
3744060	3746180	You're going to have plenty of content for these games.
3746540	3749660	Don't worry about this one little piece that's missing.
3750060	3753380	And I'm with She-Hulk in our chat who says Mass Effect one is going to be fun.
3753380	3755020	Anyway, they're doing a lot.
3755020	3758140	I mean, they have gone back and changed a lot with one there.
3758420	3761340	The interface looks a lot more like two and three now.
3761340	3763500	Like they totally changed the interface.
3763500	3765580	They've obviously gone back and done some of the graphics.
3765900	3768860	There's some controversy around what they've done with some of the graphics.
3769100	3772380	Some people did not like the look that Eden Prime had
3772900	3774980	because it kind of changed the vibe a little bit on the planet.
3775260	3779060	I'm I want to you know, we've had such a short trailer.
3779060	3781300	I'm taking much more of a wait and see approach.
3781540	3784380	And my honest response to a lot of the people that are criticizing
3784380	3787500	that is like you are free to, you know, have your criticisms,
3787500	3789660	but you're going to buy the game anyway.
3789660	3791540	Don't act like you're not going to.
3791540	3793860	Like if you are that level of fan
3794020	3797020	where you're criticizing those sorts of things, I'm like, don't kid yourself.
3797020	3798900	You're going to buy the game.
3798900	3802020	And then at least once you've kind of actually like played through
3802020	3803780	the whole thing outside of just the trailer,
3803780	3806100	then you can kind of formulate your long term opinion.
3806100	3809060	And either you didn't like it or you didn't or you liked it or you didn't,
3809060	3811420	you know? Yeah, so.
3812900	3816660	But I'm sure you all want to know, since I've effectively bought Mass Effect
3816700	3823100	3 on the PC, the Xbox 360, the PlayStation 3 and the Wii U,
3823100	3824820	I even bought the Wii U version when it was on sale.
3824820	3828780	Will I be buying Mass Effect 3 a fifth time through this?
3829060	3831660	And the answer is, of course, I will be.
3831660	3834300	Of course, I will be picking this up.
3834300	3836060	I haven't decided yet, though.
3836060	3839540	I think I'm going to get it on Series X.
3840220	3843900	But there's a part of my brain that thinks I might finally buy
3843900	3846180	into PlayStation five before then.
3846180	3850500	And if I do, I might get it on PlayStation five only because
3851300	3857940	the inevitable day that this goes over to play and thus Microsoft Game Pass,
3858260	3864380	I will then have it a sixth time if I buy it on the PlayStation first.
3864700	3866500	But that's only if I get a PlayStation five,
3866500	3869340	which I actually don't think I'm going to be able to do by the time this is out.
3869540	3873460	So I will probably realistically end up getting it on my Series X.
3874220	3874740	So.
3875860	3877220	There is that.
3878060	3881460	SSG100 Matt in chat says, Rob, smart thinking, diversifying.
3881700	3884460	I know I got to think I got to think about how can I own this
3884460	3886780	in as many places as possible?
3886780	3888860	All right. Moving on.
3889140	3891140	Loki, what else you have for us?
3891140	3893780	So apparently Activision has been accused
3893780	3898580	of stealing the concept for a Call of Duty character.
3898980	3900980	So there's this character
3900980	3906380	that was created called K Janice, who was part of a film pitch.
3907620	3913220	And apparently somehow they got Activision
3913220	3917380	got a hold of this character, figured out, you know, the likeness of this.
3917820	3920780	And they decided to use it in a Call of Duty game.
3921060	3925020	And they went to such extents to actually use
3925220	3929340	the same photographer that they use for this pitch for a movie,
3930380	3933300	use the same makeup artist, the same person
3933300	3936260	that was in those photography sessions as well.
3936460	3941300	And basically almost the same design for hair and costume.
3943540	3947740	But allegedly, you know, very they didn't steal anything.
3947780	3949820	But apparently this
3949820	3953220	the original guy that pitched this
3953580	3957500	to the movie studio actually had copyrighted his story
3957500	3962140	and characters back in 2012 and 2012, 2013.
3962620	3966940	But the photography and the photographs were a little bit more recent in 2020.
3967340	3970740	But still, I mean, it it's hard to say, like, I mean,
3970780	3974060	because a lot of this is just the person that they have playing this part,
3974260	3977540	which is actually a streamer by the name of Alex Ziedra.
3978980	3981180	But I don't know.
3981220	3984740	At the same time, that's kind of like.
3984740	3989540	It's it's awfully close, like I get it, if it's based off the same person,
3989540	3991940	but like they look pretty identical.
3992420	3996100	I mean, because it's the same person, but I don't know.
3996140	3998900	So anyways, that's a lawsuit that we're going to hear about for a while, I guess.
3999900	4002540	Until they settle out of court and then we don't get any of the details,
4002540	4004660	because when they settle out of court, we never get the details.
4004820	4007740	That's just the way it goes. Yes. Yeah. All right.
4008140	4011460	Well, I know nothing about the character.
4011660	4013820	I have nothing to say about this because I really don't know.
4013820	4016420	So, look, I kind of have to go with your opinion if you think it's
4017260	4019460	if there's any merit to this or not, or if it's a little more.
4019460	4022380	It's hard to say because all they're they're showing like photographs
4022380	4024540	with like the promotional materials,
4024540	4027940	which basically looks like a photograph of the same person.
4028140	4032140	But I mean, they're dressed up in a very similar like military fatigues
4032140	4036500	and everything, the same like loadout and the same hair and everything, which is
4037300	4039620	like if it's the same person, I get that.
4039620	4042660	But the same hair and makeup and the same kind of outfit,
4042660	4044460	that's a little questionable.
4044460	4050020	I don't know. It just especially if if they allegedly use those
4050020	4053820	original photographs as kind of a base to build the character off of
4054100	4058860	and like modeled off of that, that is also questionable. All right.
4059820	4062620	Well, let's move on and talk about another story here
4062620	4065020	before we get to the classic game of the week.
4065020	4067700	And this has to do with the delay for an older game
4067700	4070940	that was being remade, but apparently ran into some problems.
4071180	4074300	I'm talking, of course, about Prince of Persia, The Sands of Time.
4074540	4079300	If you weren't already aware, they are remaking this game for current consoles,
4079700	4083940	and they've decided to bump it back a little bit, saying in a statement,
4083940	4086780	we have made the decision to shift the release for Prince of Persia,
4086780	4090300	The Sands of Time, Sands of Time remake to a later date.
4090580	4094060	This extra development time will enable our teams to deliver a remake
4094060	4097100	that feels fresh while remaining faithful to the original.
4097260	4100980	It should be noted they don't give a target window in this update,
4100980	4103420	which is fine because they probably don't know it yet,
4103420	4106060	especially with everything pandemic going on right now.
4106060	4108020	They probably have no idea how long it's going to take
4108020	4111100	to fix some of the issues that they have been having.
4111100	4114180	And apparently some folks were kind of in some of the like pre footage
4114180	4116460	and stuff where we're seeing that there were some issues.
4116780	4119660	So it sounds like they've definitely made the right call here and bumping it back.
4119820	4122860	It'll be interesting to see, like, is this what is this mean a holiday?
4122860	4124260	Does this mean like a year?
4124260	4126820	How long is it going to be? Who knows?
4126820	4128620	So, by the way, it should also be noted.
4128620	4131940	We just like we just talked about this game getting delayed not that long ago.
4132180	4134420	It was supposed to originally come out in January.
4134620	4136420	Then they delayed it back to March.
4136420	4139100	Now they're delaying it. Tell who knows when.
4139540	4142540	So this game will be out for PlayStation 4, Xbox
4142540	4149020	one and PC via Epic Games Store and Ubisoft's own Uplay when it does come out.
4149100	4152140	So we will see the original, of course, came out in 2003.
4152460	4156180	Who knows? Maybe recent spotlights on buggy games that have come out,
4156180	4158100	scared them off, I don't know.
4158100	4159980	But there's that.
4159980	4163380	SG100Matt in our chat says, whatever, get it done when it's done.
4163580	4167220	Sands of Time was a great game and messing up this remake would suck.
4167420	4170980	Yes, I know there were some people that I know that really love
4170980	4173060	the Prince of Persia games that were kind of saying like,
4173060	4174980	why haven't we had a new Prince of Persia game in a while?
4174980	4178060	So this will definitely be something to hold it over,
4178060	4181420	but it's got to be done right or else, you know.
4183020	4185220	People will be very upset, won't they?
4185220	4188340	All right. Well, let's people know, of course not.
4188340	4192620	All right, let's get to a segment then where we spotlight a game
4192620	4195660	that is bug free, a classic game, shall we?
4197140	4200500	All right. So now we're going to use the magic of Internet radio
4200500	4205220	and discord and all of that to get the classic game of the week,
4205220	4208340	where every week here on the show, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault
4208340	4212060	to find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking this game out.
4212060	4213620	Not that newfangled stuff.
4213620	4217940	And I say magical because we actually have Dark Soccer here with us,
4217940	4220180	even though she is not on the show tonight.
4220180	4222100	Hi, Jamie, how are you?
4222100	4227340	Well, I'm sick of the sinus infection, so we'll see once I talk to the doctor tomorrow.
4227620	4231220	Boo, I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm glad you're able to spare a few minutes here
4231500	4236100	before the show tonight to still walk us through the classic game of the week.
4236100	4239540	So without further fanfare, what is the classic game of the week?
4240500	4244420	The classic game of the week is known in America as Sorcer Stryker,
4245220	4250260	S-O-R-C-E-R Stryker, and it's a vertically scrolling shooter game
4250260	4251580	that came out in 1993.
4251580	4254820	It was developed by Rising, which is now called Aiding,
4255860	4258700	published by the Able Corp in Japan and in Europe.
4259140	4263500	So basically, you are playing one of four bounty hunters
4263500	4266020	who has to overthrow the goblin empire
4266300	4272420	and reclaim a bounty that was placed on King Cadwena, a violent kingdom.
4273380	4278300	So the series is actually the Maho Daisakusen series.
4278620	4282020	So the first game really was known as Maho Daisakusen.
4283220	4287540	It also includes in that trilogy Kingdom Grand Prix and Daimaho.
4289260	4291340	It's also the first game that was made by Rising.
4291580	4298940	So at any rate, the company was founded actually by former Naxatsoft
4298940	4302780	and Compile staff, folks who worked on the Alest series.
4302780	4304780	And we all know how great those shooters are.
4304900	4309340	And I know Compile from, you know, Gardic and all that stuff.
4309340	4310980	Yeah, for sure.
4312620	4314780	Well, Compile also gave us P.O.P.O., remember?
4315180	4316940	That's true. Great company.
4317420	4320980	Probably every game of theirs has been a classic game at some point or another.
4321700	4322980	Well, that remains to be seen.
4322980	4326780	But at any rate, the game first had an arcade release.
4327140	4330220	It came out in May 1993.
4331380	4335460	It did later get other ports and we can talk about that a bit later.
4335820	4339420	So at any rate, it is a science fantasy theme.
4339820	4340980	So it's a shooter up.
4340980	4346380	It's very similar to Spriggan, where you play one of four characters
4346380	4348260	through six different stages.
4348900	4350700	I just love that you're in the violent kingdom.
4351860	4355420	And it does have different elements from other Compile shooters.
4355460	4359340	So like, you know, the scrolling background until you reach the boss
4359340	4363100	and all that and your different weapons, your main weapon and your sub weapon.
4364900	4367380	And you have bombs to clean off the screen.
4367380	4370340	But it also has some other stuff in common with M.U.S.H.A.
4371100	4375900	where you fight different mini bosses at certain stage stages of the game.
4375900	4379500	You have a respawn system where you immediately start where you died.
4380500	4386460	You can get hit by an enemy or collide with stage objects to lose a life
4386860	4389100	or lose your firepower as you go along.
4390340	4393060	So basically, you have two loops of the game.
4393060	4395940	You have to complete the first loop and then you start over
4396300	4399260	and you get the true ending when you finish the second loop.
4400060	4407260	So the plot of the game actually comes a bit more through
4407740	4409820	its supplementary materials with it.
4410300	4414140	So, you know, there were different
4415740	4419100	things that were released with it that would outline a little bit more of the story.
4420540	4425580	So anyway, a little bit more about about the development of the game.
4426500	4431220	It was developed by a crew of about four members,
4431620	4435780	including actually with designer Nakashima Kazuyuki
4436740	4441060	and the programmer of the Spriggan game, Toyama Ichi,
4441980	4448100	Yoko Kenichi and a freelance composer, Motoyama Atsuhiro.
4449700	4452060	And so they worked on this one.
4452060	4455860	Actually, it came, Toyama was working right after the arcade
4455860	4458460	release of both Spriggan and Spriggan Mark II.
4459380	4461900	Those are games I might be bringing up later, too.
4462220	4465820	And so they were they founded Rising right after that
4465820	4468420	with the desire to make a new a new game.
4468700	4473860	And in fact, they also had connections to Toaplan,
4473860	4476180	you know, another game that did some amazing tutors.
4476700	4480980	So they worked with Toaplan as the consultant.
4480980	4483340	Toaplan was their consultant for it.
4483820	4487220	And so the game started in development March 1992,
4487220	4489780	and the staff was working out of the bedroom of an apartment
4490100	4492780	using development tools provided by Toaplan.
4493740	4496940	And it was going to start off as a Chinese martial arts
4497140	4500340	shooter called Hago Gekiren Saifu.
4501220	4504620	However, it went a little bit different
4504620	4508180	because they wanted to add worldwide appeal to it.
4508180	4510820	And so they took things from different
4512460	4513780	games that the others worked on.
4513780	4516740	I mean, like I said, Musha, many of the other compile games
4516980	4520340	and wanted to make it a little bit more fantasy,
4520580	4522460	kind of a steampunk aesthetic to it.
4522460	4525420	So they changed the whole kind of concept of the game
4525420	4528420	and they developed it in an apartment. That's nuts. Yeah.
4529260	4532820	Well, I mean, think about what people do with games now.
4532820	4534620	Oh, yeah, no, I know, especially, you know,
4534620	4537500	you have to remember it was a very different industry in the 90s
4537500	4539900	and teams were generally smaller as well.
4539900	4541940	But still, I mean,
4541940	4544940	and they also did have support from Toaplan.
4545180	4547780	So they had development tools, like really good development tools.
4549060	4553180	So they they did some special designs
4553180	4557220	with the ships to give them like these hand-like extremities
4557220	4558540	to give them character.
4558540	4563460	But the designs were also an experiment to see if they could give
4563820	4566860	operability and personality to keep it from
4566860	4569140	but have it not interfere with their hitbox.
4569860	4572820	So, you know, they they wanted to give a sense of story.
4572820	4574220	They wanted to be a little bit different.
4575820	4581500	So at any rate, you know, they even tried to put in like their
4582700	4585540	their muscular dude and then their little moe girl,
4585540	4588500	you know, like an idol singer type girl, you know.
4589180	4593180	But they didn't really have, you know, all the appeal they quite wanted,
4593180	4597300	but they were able to get get things to where they wanted to.
4598020	4600180	And also, some of the characters were based off of Wizardry,
4601020	4603380	the game, the game series, Wizardry. Oh, yeah.
4603420	4606300	So they had some difficulty
4608220	4609140	deciding on a name.
4609140	4612180	It was first titled Mahou Daisensou.
4613140	4616060	And then they with a little bit more brainstorming,
4616060	4618100	it came out as Mahou Daisakusen.
4620500	4623660	So and that's where they, you know, kind of went through
4623660	4626660	to produce this colorful, this vivid game.
4627300	4630580	So it was first released into arcades by the Able Corporation
4630580	4634340	across Europe and Japan, May 1993.
4634340	4636540	And they used a TOA plan licensed arcade board.
4637220	4640020	There was a CD music album out in 1994
4640020	4644340	that was published in Japan by Shin Seisha.
4645940	4647620	And then there was a manga adaptation.
4647620	4650180	Remember, I said there was more material that came with it.
4650180	4654460	The first port of the game was, of course, on the X68000,
4654820	4656700	published by E.A. Victor.
4656700	4659140	And that came out on December 16th, 1994,
4659460	4661100	and had a lot of different options,
4661100	4662860	including different MIDI support.
4662860	4665020	Then it came out on FM Towns,
4665020	4669340	also again by Electric Arts and Victor in February 1995.
4669340	4673300	And it had the Redbook audio from the X68000 version,
4673300	4676140	but it also ran at a lower frame rate
4676140	4678300	and had missing special effects.
4678300	4680820	There was a mobile phone version by EasyWeb
4680820	4683340	that was developed by Aiding once they were no longer rising.
4684380	4687740	And on November 2017,
4688580	4692260	M2 released a new version of Sorcerer Striker
4692260	4696300	as part of their M2 shot triggers for PS4.
4696300	4698340	And it had exclusive additions,
4698340	4700300	including an easier difficulty setting
4700300	4705300	and two aircraft simultaneously in single player.
4708260	4711860	As of August 1st, 1983,
4711860	4713740	in Japan, Game Machine listed
4713740	4716380	as their seventh most popular arcade game at the time.
4717260	4721140	There were plenty of comparisons with Truxton made.
4721980	4724860	The X68000 version had a lot of positive reception.
4724860	4725860	I've seen it in hand,
4725860	4728940	and it actually is a pretty damn good version.
4728940	4732500	A few people were like, eh, it doesn't have what Alest had.
4733660	4736740	But, you know, different people
4736740	4738060	have just come out on the limit,
4738060	4741380	since this is actually one of their favorite shooter games.
4741380	4743740	And it says it tends to be for,
4743780	4747820	actually Kurt Kalata for Hardcore Gaming 101 said,
4747820	4748900	it's an excellent game,
4748900	4750460	though one that tends to be forgotten
4750460	4754300	in favor of Rising's more innovative and ambitious titles.
4754300	4757260	Famitsu gave the PS4 version 25 out of 40.
4757260	4759620	We know how tough Famitsu is.
4759620	4763900	So it is the first one in the Mahou Daisakusen trilogy.
4763900	4766540	There was a sequel called Kingdom Grand Prix,
4766540	4768140	came out in arcades in 84,
4768140	4773140	and then came out on Sega Saturn by Gaga Communications.
4773260	4774780	It's a different kind of game though.
4774780	4776140	And then there was Daimaho,
4776140	4779940	which was released for arcades by Capcom in 2000.
4779940	4784940	So I actually think it's a Capcom CPS1, I wanna say.
4784980	4785820	Don't quote me yet.
4785820	4787140	I think it's a CPS1.
4788420	4791060	And then the characters that were in there,
4791060	4794060	their names are Gain, Chita, Miyamoto, and Bonem,
4794060	4797020	are guest characters in Battle Garaga
4797020	4799380	and Armed Police Batrider.
4799380	4801860	Battle Garaga is one I'm probably gonna do again
4801860	4802700	in the future,
4802700	4805340	because it's one of those iconic shooters.
4805340	4807300	Now don't go spoiling it at all.
4807300	4808940	No, I just said I might do it.
4809900	4813000	But I mean, this game is, I've played it a couple of times.
4813000	4814980	I mean, I'm not super great at shooters,
4814980	4815820	but it's a fun one.
4815820	4820820	I mean, it definitely has kind of that mix of compile meets,
4821180	4824500	you know, compile shooter meets a last.
4824500	4826660	So it's pretty, pretty cool.
4826660	4828460	And it's not every day you hear about wizardry
4828460	4830940	inspiring a shooter, that's for sure.
4830940	4832900	Yeah, I mean, it was just a couple of characters
4832900	4835540	that were inspired by wizardry.
4835540	4836380	But still.
4836380	4841380	So, but it's, you know, it's a worthwhile game, you know,
4842180	4843820	and hold on, I'm gonna real quick confirm
4843820	4845940	what Daima-ho was released on.
4845940	4849820	I wanna say that it was a CPS,
4851340	4853720	sorry, it was a CPS2, my apologies.
4855140	4859640	Yeah, I knew it was like an earlier though one,
4859640	4860860	so there you go.
4861820	4864460	I mean, even the sequels are really great games.
4864460	4869460	I played Daima-ho before I played the first one, so.
4869820	4870860	All right.
4870860	4872620	Well, thank you for walking us through
4872620	4876460	your classic game of the week, Sorcerer Striker.
4876460	4877280	Sorcerer.
4877280	4878380	Sorcerer, excuse me.
4878380	4880720	I keep wanting to say, it's the wizardry on the brain.
4880720	4881660	I keep wanting to say sorcerer.
4881660	4882900	Okay, Sorcerer Striker.
4882900	4885620	It's a magic related game, so.
4885620	4887140	Yeah.
4887140	4889980	All right, well, before we go back to the studio live,
4890020	4894100	Dark Sakura, any parting words for the folks tonight?
4895420	4898700	I would like for my sinuses to be drilled out
4898700	4901000	and inflated so that they don't feel like my face
4901000	4902740	is going to crush itself.
4902740	4903580	That's all.
4903580	4904900	Well, you should let your doctor know.
4904900	4905740	All right.
4905740	4906560	I am.
4906560	4908660	Take care of Dark Sakura, we'll see you next week.
4908660	4909660	All right, bye.
4911020	4913740	All right, thanks to Jamie, Dark Sakura,
4913740	4915660	for filling in there earlier today.
4915660	4917500	So we still got to have her voice on the show this week
4917540	4920420	with the classic game of the week, Sorcerer Striker,
4920420	4923740	which I have to admit, not a title I was super familiar with
4923740	4925260	and this happens with her pick sometimes.
4925260	4926380	I'm like, I don't remember this one.
4926380	4928620	And I was watching chat during that segment
4928620	4930940	and there was several people in chat kind of having it,
4930940	4933020	like, I swear I've played something like this,
4933020	4935180	but I don't think it was this.
4935180	4937100	The closest thing I can think of is Dragon Spirit,
4937100	4938940	but that's really like actually playing a dragon,
4938940	4940660	but it would still have like that same kind of like,
4940660	4941840	like wizardry type of thing.
4941840	4944820	But I can't think of what it is that's really like this,
4944820	4946020	but that was a good pick.
4946020	4947480	It was fun to check out.
4948360	4950440	Speaking of classics, by the way,
4950440	4954580	Loki, sorry, Mr. Smoosh just ran right under this table here.
4954580	4955960	You can't see it on stream.
4955960	4957780	He's got a case of the zoomies right now.
4957780	4959280	So I'm a little bit distracted.
4959280	4961400	Mr. Smoosh, of course, my kitty.
4961400	4965200	So Loki, you know how there's,
4965200	4967660	I drive down J Street downtown a lot
4967660	4969720	to refill up on my Pokeballs.
4969720	4972080	I use Bluetooth, so I'm not trying to spin
4972080	4973480	Pokestops and all that.
4973480	4975720	There's that little retro gaming store.
4975720	4976640	Have you ever seen that?
4976640	4977480	It's brand new.
4977480	4978300	They just put-
4978300	4979140	I know what you're talking about, yeah.
4979140	4981720	I finally went today and to check it out.
4981720	4984860	So, and I bought something while I was there.
4984860	4986240	And it's, I don't know if anyone noticed,
4986240	4988360	we have a new decoration in the studio.
4988360	4990220	I'll try to take it down from the hook here.
4990220	4992560	It's a little hard to see, but it's a little,
4992560	4994520	it's one of those like 3D frames.
4994520	4996560	If I tilt it a little bit, you can see some of the 3D,
4996560	5000760	but you can maybe see what screen it is representing there.
5000760	5002520	Hopefully you can kind of tell, sorry.
5002520	5005200	I know it's on Twitch and sorry to the podcast folks.
5005200	5006600	What's that, Loki?
5007440	5008280	I said, that's pretty cool.
5008280	5009100	Yeah.
5009100	5009940	I liked this.
5009940	5010760	It was only 20 bucks.
5010760	5012360	So I was like, all right, I'm kind of into that.
5012360	5015400	And of course the game, it's Castlevania is the game
5015400	5019480	that's Simon kind of going at the Reaper there and that.
5019480	5020620	So I thought that was really cool.
5020620	5021680	So I picked that up.
5021680	5025120	So yeah, little, speaking of classic games,
5025120	5026760	a little trinket I picked up this week.
5026760	5029240	So that's dangerous because they have more of them.
5029240	5032200	There was one for Contra and there was one for Sonic.
5032200	5034160	And I was like, I kind of want them all.
5034160	5035880	I think that would be fun little decoration
5036000	5037440	for the new studio whenever we get there.
5037440	5040520	So SGO and Hunter Matt says, oh, those things are cool.
5040520	5041800	See them at cons a bunch.
5041800	5044280	Yeah, I think, so one thing I noticed about this place,
5044280	5046080	they definitely don't just have games.
5046080	5049040	They're very, they're leaning hard into like gaming culture,
5049040	5052600	you know, hats, lamps, you know,
5052600	5054520	the kind of like Game Stops have to do too,
5054520	5055840	is, you know, you can't just make your money
5055840	5056920	off the games alone.
5056920	5058320	It's kind of the gaming culture stuff,
5058320	5059840	but I saw this and I thought it was cute.
5059840	5060920	No, I love Castlevania.
5060920	5061760	So I had to pick that.
5061760	5064520	And plus this is like my favorite stage
5064520	5065840	and music in Castlevania.
5065840	5066840	So it's a good pick.
5066840	5067720	So there you go.
5067720	5071080	Anyway, all right, let's do some rapid fire news, shall we?
5071080	5073320	Where we quickly talk about some other things going on
5073320	5074760	in the gaming world this week.
5074760	5076280	Loki.
5076280	5079840	Yes, so apparently because it's gotten a lot of attention
5079840	5084440	about how tall is that very large woman or vampire
5084440	5088000	in the new Resident Evil Village game.
5088960	5093960	So Lady Dimitrescu, she is now officially
5094920	5099200	according to Capcom, nine foot six.
5099200	5103520	So if you need to, you know, need that for some reason,
5103520	5106560	I don't know, but people were fawning over
5106560	5110680	and now you know, 2.9 meters or 9.6 feet.
5110680	5113120	Thank you, Capcom, for legitimizing all of that.
5113120	5113960	Thanks.
5113960	5116040	Nine foot six inches, I guess nine and a half inch
5116040	5117240	or nine and a half feet.
5118160	5122960	And then we have Final Fantasy XII, the Zodiac Age,
5123000	5125640	finally heading to Games Pass.
5125640	5128200	So that's gonna be coming out very soon.
5128200	5130400	I don't know the exact date yet,
5130400	5132560	but right around the corner.
5132560	5133440	Oh, here we go.
5133440	5135800	So it's gonna be coming out February 11th
5135800	5139800	and along with it, Jurassic World Evolution,
5139800	5143880	The Falconer, Project Winter, Ghosts of a Tale,
5143880	5146280	Stealth Inc. 2, A Game of Clones
5146280	5148640	and Wolfenstein Youngblood.
5148640	5152560	So coming out early this month.
5153600	5154560	All right.
5154560	5156600	Well, I wanna talk a little bit about Ingress
5156600	5159600	cause I play that game a little bit, as you guys know.
5159600	5162320	And I don't often talk about the news and updates for this,
5162320	5164360	but this one kind of also goes out to my pals
5164360	5167500	who also play Pokemon Go, another Niantic game,
5167500	5171040	because a lot of times where Ingress tends to go,
5171040	5172760	Pokemon Go tends to follow.
5172760	5174880	And I'm gonna talk about a monthly sub
5174880	5176520	that they have announced that's coming to Ingress
5176520	5179360	where you will actually be able to give them money
5179360	5182180	on a monthly basis for some additional perks.
5182180	5184200	I should point out though, because you guys,
5184200	5187480	I know a lot more people play Pokemon Go than play Ingress.
5187480	5191440	But one thing that's finally came to Ingress this week
5191440	5193440	after like years of asking,
5193440	5196220	and this has been in Pokemon Go forever.
5196220	5198480	When you go to the, well, in Pokemon Go,
5198480	5201900	you can see if you've spun a Poke Stop or not, right?
5201900	5204000	If there's a little white ring around the Poke Stop,
5204000	5205080	then you've never visited it.
5205080	5207120	And once you spin it, then that white ring goes away,
5207120	5208000	right?
5208000	5210700	Well, in Ingress, there are specific achievements
5210700	5213000	for visiting unique places and hacking stuff
5213000	5213920	and capturing stuff.
5213920	5216600	And we have never been able to see if we've ever hacked
5216600	5218200	or captured a portal before.
5218200	5220940	But now on the Ingress Intel Map, as of this week,
5220940	5222760	you can actually have a display.
5222760	5224480	These are portals you've hacked.
5224480	5226100	These are portals you've captured
5226100	5228760	to make the hunt for unique portals a lot easier.
5228760	5230380	And they say that they are bringing this
5230380	5232820	to the in-game client as well.
5232820	5234760	So that is very exciting.
5235280	5237120	It was really fun for me to go and look at a city
5237120	5240000	like Chicago that I visited a couple times
5240000	5241960	and I did an Ingress anomaly there years ago.
5241960	5244080	You may remember, I've talked about it on this show.
5244080	5247060	It was really fun to see, like, here are the parts of town
5247060	5248880	that I hacked up and down the street.
5248880	5251900	Here's the parts where I must've just done a couple hacks
5251900	5255120	driving by in a Lyft or Uber or whatever.
5255120	5257080	And here are places with tons of portals
5257080	5257920	I didn't touch at all.
5257920	5258960	It was kind of fun to me.
5258960	5261520	I like the whole, like, here's how to track
5261520	5262880	where I've been in the world.
5262880	5264480	Anyway, I'm digressing a little bit,
5265160	5267280	but I'm just kind of showing, like, Ingress, Pokemon Go.
5267280	5269260	They're tied together a little bit sometimes.
5269260	5271080	And Niantic announced this week
5271080	5273840	that there will be a monthly subscription coming to Ingress
5273840	5275820	called CORE, which stands for
5275820	5278920	Community Offers Recognition and Expansion.
5278920	5283920	They say that it will be $5 a month, $4.99, but $5, come on.
5284880	5286240	And the rewards you will get,
5286240	5290880	you will get a 500 slot expansion to your inventory.
5290880	5292920	That's huge, let me tell you, right there.
5292920	5294600	There are people that will be willing to pay it
5294600	5295720	just for that alone,
5295720	5298720	because your inventory is so limited in that game.
5298720	5301720	And you are limited to 2,000 items,
5301720	5303300	and then you have an additional five,
5303300	5304560	what they call key lockers,
5304560	5305800	where you can put keys to portals
5305800	5308440	up to 500 of them in those lockers, 600, I think,
5308440	5309960	actually now.
5309960	5312320	But there's, like, your basic inventory,
5312320	5314120	bursters and rosa, is limited to 2,000.
5314120	5315240	You cannot expand that.
5315240	5317980	So the fact that this is happening is a huge deal.
5317980	5320040	You will also get a special medal,
5320040	5322120	special code name flare, whatever.
5322160	5325100	You get some monthly in-game currency,
5325100	5327040	2,500 what they call CMUs,
5327040	5328520	and you get a loadout kit,
5328520	5330780	which I assume is gonna be, you know, some gear.
5330780	5335180	And then you will be able to, also on the Intel map,
5335180	5340180	you can go and see your inventory and your portal keys.
5340240	5344000	That's huge for planning big fields.
5344000	5347440	There's gonna be some people that will love that for,
5347440	5349480	oh, I've got a key to that, I got a key to that.
5349480	5350760	So it's gonna be interesting.
5350760	5352560	Five bucks a month, that's a lot.
5352560	5354880	But again, I know people that,
5354880	5356580	I will probably do it, honestly.
5356580	5357800	I play enough of that game.
5357800	5360780	You know, I probably play almost as much of that
5360780	5362520	as I do something like Final Fantasy XIV,
5362520	5364820	and I pay three times as much as Final Fantasy XIV.
5364820	5367000	So I'll probably do it.
5367000	5368200	Loki, you probably won't do it
5368200	5370000	because you don't play enough Ingress, right?
5370000	5373720	I don't play any Ingress, so that's a definite,
5373720	5374840	that's a hard no.
5376680	5377720	ActDeftInChat says,
5377720	5380280	I do wonder if they plan to implement this for Go.
5380680	5383000	I mean, we already pay for events in Pogo.
5383000	5385440	That comment, of course, coming from our chat room.
5385440	5387000	That's exactly why I brought it up.
5387000	5388680	I don't think we have a lot of listeners
5388680	5389880	who even know what Ingress is,
5389880	5392120	but I bet there's a lot of you that do play Pokemon Go.
5392120	5394800	And I just kind of wanted to say, oh, look at this,
5394800	5397160	because this might be what, you know,
5397160	5399320	again, we don't know until they make an official announcement
5399320	5401120	but it's interesting, isn't it?
5402080	5404320	Here's a game that admittedly I've never played
5404320	5408360	but always comes up because it was in the release dates once
5408360	5409320	and we couldn't stop laughing.
5409360	5411200	It's AlpacaBall.
5411200	5413160	Did you know AlpacaBall All-Stars
5413160	5414720	is a game that's out there right now?
5414720	5416720	Well, you can get a free update to the game
5416720	5418520	if you're somebody that's playing this game right now.
5418520	5420880	It is a Lunar New Year update.
5420880	5422520	So you can actually get in there
5422520	5425360	and it's a free update that's coming out February 5th.
5425360	5430360	So it's already come out and you will get a new pitch
5431520	5435480	and there is a new stage, I guess, called Chinatown
5435480	5437320	that is decked out with decorations
5437320	5438760	to welcome the Lunar New Year.
5439240	5440560	And there is a dragon in there
5440560	5444480	that will toss the soccer ball and the alpacas into the air,
5444480	5446600	just flinging that alpaca.
5446600	5450320	All right, so check that out if you're a fan of AlpacaBall.
5450320	5451760	Loki, a couple more for us.
5453920	5458920	All right, so we've got Akira Yamaoka teasing something
5460240	5463760	that he says is gonna be announced by the summer,
5465400	5468400	something that I'm quite sure it will be the one
5468920	5470840	that you've been waiting for, he says.
5472360	5473880	Oh, interesting.
5473880	5474700	Oh, him.
5475600	5478120	He just had a birthday a couple of days ago.
5478120	5480600	Yeah, and so apparently, you know,
5480600	5483080	he was like teasing something that this is part
5483080	5486640	of an interview that he did with AI Hub.
5486640	5491640	And since then they have pulled the interview
5491960	5495400	by the request of an unspecified party.
5495400	5496680	Oh, yikes.
5496680	5499840	Okay, hmm, the plot thickens.
5499840	5503000	I guess we'll wait and see what that might mean.
5503000	5506440	All right, let's not get too excited, but maybe a little.
5506440	5510040	Yeah, I can think of at least one franchise
5510040	5511000	he's involved with.
5512200	5514240	All right, and of course, if you're not already aware,
5514240	5515600	Silent Hill is what we're talking about,
5515600	5518320	but let's not set our expectations too high
5518320	5520360	because that's only gonna lead to disappointment.
5520360	5523380	Yeah. Yeah, and what else?
5523380	5525940	And then we've got a,
5527740	5532740	this Bimani piano game, Nostalgia, is now on PC.
5532900	5534620	So you can check that out.
5534620	5538180	It's, I don't know, I guess it's part
5538180	5541020	of the economy amusement game station platform
5541020	5542140	that they have.
5542140	5545060	So it apparently is also going to support
5545060	5546980	MIDI keyboards as well.
5546980	5547820	Oh, cool.
5547820	5550540	And you can play it, of course, like anything else
5550580	5554460	that's on there with a basic core subscription
5554460	5559460	of 1,628 yen a month or about 1,550.
5560340	5564300	And you'll have access to every piece of content
5564300	5565820	in the game.
5565820	5568940	So I am not familiar with this game,
5568940	5572320	but I mean, it looks like keyboard mania.
5572320	5573620	It's come up on the show before
5573620	5576180	and I think I've seen, it looks like a lot of fun.
5576180	5578620	Again, I'm kind of waiting to see
5578620	5583420	if they will put out an official English support translation
5583420	5586260	and localized support for the game.
5586260	5587400	But I think it's really cool.
5587400	5589300	It's neat that Bimani's still kind of kicking
5589300	5590700	in these different ways.
5590700	5592340	So.
5592340	5594980	Yeah, I'm surprised we haven't heard anything else of like,
5594980	5596460	because I know that you were doing the alpha test
5596460	5598300	for like Dance Dance Revolution
5598300	5601260	and then they have like 2DX and all that stuff.
5601260	5602100	I'm wondering.
5602100	5606220	Well, the pandemic happens and it's probably coming into it.
5606220	5607960	Yeah, I guess.
5608120	5609120	For DDR anyway.
5609120	5610520	All right.
5610520	5611640	Let's travel around the world
5611640	5613120	and check out some release dates
5613120	5615160	and some games that are coming out very soon.
5615160	5617320	I know we at least have one big one in the US this week.
5617320	5618640	Right, Loki?
5618640	5619480	Yeah.
5619480	5620320	So we've got a,
5620320	5622360	it looks like Def Crown coming out of Nintendo Switch,
5622360	5624520	PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,
5624520	5626640	Little Nightmares II on PC,
5626640	5630040	Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,
5630040	5633600	Galgun Returns on PC and Nintendo Switch,
5633600	5635640	Super Mario 3D World,
5635640	5638960	plus Bowser's Fury on Nintendo Switch.
5638960	5643960	And then we've got the three that we're releasing this week,
5645160	5648600	Pixel Poops, Pixel Poops 64 and Pixel Poops number two.
5649600	5653120	PC, Commodore 64 and NES for those.
5655200	5656840	How convenient that that's on the list.
5656840	5657680	I love that.
5657680	5659080	It's on there.
5659080	5662880	Like, I mean, Wikipedia had it, so it must be official.
5663480	5666520	Is that Mario 3D Worlds this week, isn't it?
5666520	5667360	Yes, it is.
5667360	5668200	Oh, I missed it.
5668200	5669040	Sorry.
5669040	5671560	It's on Friday, 3D World plus Bowser's Fury.
5671560	5672400	All right.
5672400	5673240	I know I'm picking that one up.
5673240	5674520	So I'm excited about that.
5674520	5675360	All right.
5675360	5676200	Let's travel over to Japan
5676200	5678800	and check out what's coming out over there in Japan.
5678800	5680960	Of course, Super Mario 3D World and Bowser's Fury
5680960	5682920	also out in Japan this week on the 12th.
5682920	5684840	That's kind of a worldwide release,
5684840	5686960	which I'm sure doesn't surprise anyone.
5686960	5687800	That is out on the Switch.
5687800	5690680	And then a Fate Xstella celebration.
5690680	5693800	Switch and then a Fate Xstella celebration box
5693800	5696600	for the Switch is also out on the 11th this week.
5696600	5699560	And those are pretty much your big releases on the Switch.
5699560	5701640	Checking the PlayStation 5.
5701640	5704040	No, there's a third party putting out a headset,
5704040	5706280	but we don't get any new games until next week.
5706280	5708480	We get a new game on PlayStation 5.
5708480	5710200	PlayStation 4 does have
5710200	5712600	that same Fate Xstella celebration box
5712600	5714240	that I talked about on the Switch.
5714240	5718200	Otherwise, Little Nightmares II is coming out over there.
5718200	5719560	So you can check that out.
5719560	5721440	And that's it for Japanese releases.
5721440	5724760	How about the UK, Loki, with Dark Sakura out tonight?
5724760	5727040	We have Little Nightmares II coming out
5727040	5731320	on PlayStation 5 and 4.
5731320	5735280	And it looks like Xbox One and Switch and PC.
5735280	5739240	We've got Evoland on PlayStation 4.
5739240	5743160	Eternam EX on Switch.
5743160	5746160	We have Dex on Switch.
5746160	5747640	And then they're getting also
5747640	5752640	the Mario Red and Blue Edition Switch bundle
5754520	5755960	and accessories.
5755960	5759520	So that's gonna be bundled with that Super Mario 3D World.
5759520	5764520	And we've got Galgun Returns on Nintendo Switch.
5765040	5769080	They're also doing the standalone Super Mario 3D World
5769080	5771320	and Bowser's Fury as well.
5771320	5772880	And that's it.
5773760	5775000	All right.
5775000	5776840	We've got a few more stories for you guys.
5776840	5779040	And then we're gonna get to your questions in our chat room
5779040	5779920	as well as your emails.
5779920	5781000	We have a couple of emails tonight.
5781000	5783440	So we'll get to those shortly.
5783440	5785440	But first, some more stories for you.
5785440	5789160	Loki, this game that just will not leave the news.
5789160	5791480	Every week, it's something.
5791480	5793280	And you thought mods were problems
5793280	5796160	when they were romancing Keanu Reeves.
5796160	5798400	But now, apparently all mods are problems
5798400	5802440	because come to find out,
5803200	5804840	in Cyberpunk, specifically.
5804840	5806520	Yes, in Cyberpunk.
5806520	5811160	There's a security exploit apparently in Cyberpunk
5811160	5813200	when they added mod support.
5813200	5814480	So they're saying,
5814480	5818560	hey, be cautious because we have been made aware
5818560	5822400	that there is a vulnerability allows external DLL files
5822400	5826760	and in the game or vulnerability and external DLL files
5826760	5831160	the game uses, which can be used to execute code on PCs.
5831400	5836320	This is gonna be patch ASAP, but for now be cautious.
5836320	5841320	However, it has been patched as of Friday, so that is good.
5842120	5843960	But just be aware that this stuff
5843960	5848960	kind of pops up once in a while and it is Cyberpunk.
5849160	5851200	So I mean, they're still working on it.
5852280	5854640	Still trying to make sure the game works for everybody.
5854640	5855920	Exactly.
5855920	5858440	All right, well, this news came out this week
5858440	5860320	and it's disappointing to some individuals.
5860360	5862880	Although I have to say it's not incredibly surprising,
5862880	5865000	but Blizzard has basically confirmed
5865000	5867440	that Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4
5867440	5869320	will not be happening this year.
5869320	5871680	Which is interesting because they're doing
5871680	5875560	their own type of like online BlizzCon soon.
5875560	5877320	I think it's in the next couple of weeks.
5877320	5879120	I don't remember the exact day,
5879120	5880280	but I think it's coming up real soon.
5880280	5881280	It might even be this week.
5881280	5882560	I just forget.
5882560	5884840	If somebody in chat knows, let me know.
5884840	5888640	But this news came out during a earnings call.
5888680	5891240	So they did their fourth quarter 2020 earnings call.
5891240	5895320	And they basically said that Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2
5895320	5897120	are not gonna be happening right now.
5897120	5899960	I think some folks thought that maybe Diablo 4
5899960	5902760	might make this year or even maybe Overwatch 2
5902760	5905920	because it seems to build a lot on Overwatch 1.
5905920	5907720	So it might be a little bit surprising.
5907720	5912680	Again, knowing that Blizzard is headquartered in California
5912680	5917200	and California has had a lot of the stringent shutdown laws
5917200	5921520	and the fact that working from home
5921520	5923280	has probably put some bumps in the road,
5923280	5926040	I'm not incredibly surprised.
5926040	5929320	But it does leave me wondering what Blizzard plans
5929320	5932320	to hype up or what they have coming this year.
5932320	5936640	My concern is it's that Diablo phone game.
5936640	5939360	Although everybody I've heard that's tried it
5939360	5941160	says it's not bad.
5941160	5942800	Like a lot of people are writing it off
5942800	5944000	because it's a mobile phone game,
5944000	5946920	but it actually is a pretty decent Diablo game.
5947880	5949880	I wanna try it for myself before I really know
5949880	5952480	because that's coming from fanboys at the fair.
5953760	5956400	But that must be a thing for this year.
5956400	5959800	But again, after what happened a couple of Blizzcons ago,
5959800	5961480	with that being the key announcement,
5961480	5963960	I can't believe that that would be their key announcement
5963960	5964800	for this year.
5964800	5968680	Now we've had the rumors about Diablo 2 getting remastered.
5968680	5970920	Remember that whole thing where they picked up
5970920	5972800	the studio back East and everything.
5972800	5975920	So maybe that's the thing they're gonna lean on this year.
5975920	5978400	Maybe that's something they can get done a little faster.
5978400	5979240	I don't know.
5979240	5980240	Anyway, oh, I found the dates for the event.
5980240	5982040	It's February 19th and 20th.
5982040	5984480	So it is this month, it's coming up pretty soon.
5984480	5987480	So there you go, that's happening.
5987480	5991400	So we'll see if they decide to give them a better date then.
5991400	5993240	But for right now in their earnings report,
5993240	5995360	they said we are making significant progress
5995360	5996880	against our development pipeline
5996880	5999120	for other key intellectual properties,
5999120	6003140	which we expect to fuel further growth in 2022 and beyond.
6004020	6007180	Well, we'll see what they've got.
6007180	6009060	All right, moving on.
6009060	6011180	Loki to something we never got.
6012140	6015940	Yes, so there is a prototype of DuckTales
6015940	6017140	that has been found.
6017140	6020260	And one of the things that was discovered in the game,
6020260	6025260	which is a unused soundtrack or yeah,
6025500	6027700	unused song from the game
6027700	6029620	that was originally supposed to be intended
6029660	6033220	for the map screen, but they cut it out.
6033220	6035860	So that was kind of cool that we got to hear that.
6035860	6036700	Yeah.
6037540	6039780	Yeah, and so this prototype was from,
6039780	6042740	looks like February 5th, 1989.
6042740	6046400	Wow, 22 years ago.
6046400	6048300	No, I can't math today.
6048300	6050000	That would be 32 years ago.
6051100	6052160	Wow, yeah.
6053820	6058340	So that's pretty neat that they have that available
6058380	6060580	to hear what might've been.
6060580	6062820	Wasn't as good as some of the other music in the game,
6062820	6064840	but it was still neat to hear it.
6064840	6067820	Yeah, it's almost, I love the site
6067820	6069880	that gets all the prototypes
6069880	6071420	and all the differences and things.
6071420	6073680	It's so neat to see the stuff that changed
6073680	6075780	for whatever reason and just to kind of theorize
6075780	6077160	like why would they have changed this
6077160	6078380	or done this a little differently?
6078380	6080900	And like you said, maybe they just didn't receive
6080900	6082540	the map song as well internally.
6082540	6085260	So they decided to put a different song in instead.
6085260	6088900	So, dark to see in chat says over at twitch.tv
6088900	6090060	slash vog network.
6090060	6091580	I definitely recommend looking up
6091580	6093740	the alternative Transylvania music.
6093740	6096340	I almost like it more than the one we got.
6096340	6100580	So yeah, art is all in the eye of the beholder.
6100580	6102180	So cool, I'll have to check.
6102180	6103180	I haven't heard the song yet,
6103180	6104940	so I'll have to check it out after the show.
6104940	6107880	So, all right, well, meanwhile, another story from Loki.
6109020	6112160	Yeah, and then I think we talked a little bit
6112160	6116600	about how Valve is gonna be getting the receiving end
6116600	6119560	of a lawsuit regarding patent infringement
6119560	6120400	with their controller.
6120400	6124400	Well, they have now been fined over 4 million
6124400	6127240	for that patent infringement.
6127240	6132080	This is coming from the, let's see,
6132080	6136640	the company was Scuf, I guess, or S-C-U-F,
6136640	6140320	and they're owned now by Corsair.
6140320	6145320	So they apparently, they found that they did impede
6146320	6150940	on their patent and now they owe them that kind of money.
6152880	6155080	Yeah, I mean, I'm kind of surprised,
6155080	6159280	but just kind of sucks for Valve.
6159280	6161080	They can't catch a break with anything,
6161080	6162600	any of the brick rules that they're releasing,
6162600	6165400	but I don't know, what are you gonna do?
6165400	6167040	At least it's not being produced anymore.
6167040	6170560	So, keep the damages to a minimum.
6170560	6173120	Well, one thing they could do is show up to court,
6173120	6177960	although that was a different case, but still, still.
6177960	6180960	All right, ending on a bit of a downer tonight, sorry,
6180960	6182980	but it should definitely be brought up
6182980	6185140	because unfortunately we lost somebody this week
6185140	6189160	who is huge in gaming culture, and that is Robert A. Altman,
6189160	6192560	who is the co-founder and CEO of ZeniMax.
6192560	6196080	Bethesda in a statement saying he was a true visionary friend
6196120	6197720	and believer in the spirit of people
6197720	6199800	and the power of what they could accomplish together.
6199800	6201440	He was an extraordinary leader
6201440	6203720	and an even better human being.
6203720	6205800	There's a lot of stuff on Twitter,
6205800	6207880	a lot of people talking about their reflections
6207880	6210400	on having met Robert Altman and so forth
6210400	6212400	and some of the things he kind of did with the company.
6212400	6214800	I even know a couple of people that work over there
6214800	6216080	and we're talking about some of the things
6216080	6218540	that he did with the company and so forth.
6218540	6222640	And it's sad, and obviously a lot of folks that work there
6222640	6225600	are kind of mourning this.
6225600	6229440	This is, I did not catch that there was a reason,
6229440	6231320	not that it's any of our business,
6231320	6232920	but I know in the year 2021,
6232920	6235480	a lot of people want to know, is it COVID?
6235480	6238720	I don't know, and I don't know how much notice they had
6238720	6241040	that if he was sick for a while or something like that,
6241040	6244280	but the reality is that unfortunately he's passed away
6244280	6247560	and now somebody else will become the CEO of Bethesda
6247560	6249120	when the board meets next.
6249120	6251600	So if you do want more information,
6251600	6255100	including there's a nice little letter from his son
6255460	6258100	that is available, twitter.com slash Bethesda,
6258100	6260460	and there are some tweets from February 4th
6260460	6261820	when this occurred.
6261820	6263340	So you can check that out.
6264580	6265400	All right.
6266640	6269700	Ooh, SH100Matt bringing it back to a happier note.
6269700	6271380	We'll kind of start our listener round table with this
6271380	6274580	cause I can't believe I forgot to include this tonight.
6274580	6277500	Meanwhile, the data miners finding the original code
6277500	6280620	for the Super Mario Brothers Super Mario World soundtrack
6280620	6284020	and folks recreating it in its uncompressed form
6284060	6285500	sounds really cool.
6285500	6287980	Yeah, I wish I'd prepped that to play on the show tonight.
6287980	6290100	Sorry guys, but check it out on YouTube.
6290100	6292140	I tweeted about it a few days ago.
6292140	6293340	Loki, did you hear these?
6293340	6294340	It was-
6294340	6296060	I did, and it was probably a good thing
6296060	6297740	that we didn't play any of that.
6298820	6299660	I liked it.
6299660	6300580	It was, oh yeah, you're right.
6300580	6301660	We might get shut down or something.
6301660	6302500	Yeah, you're right.
6302500	6304460	Cease and desist, happy and all that, you're right.
6304460	6306020	So we probably shouldn't play it, but still,
6306020	6307940	I can still tell you to go seek it out on YouTube
6307940	6309260	cause I believe it's still up there.
6309260	6310540	So basically what they did,
6310540	6313420	they found the uncompressed samples
6313420	6315300	before they went into the cartridge.
6315300	6317220	And then obviously you have to compress stuff down a lot
6317220	6319660	to fit into 16-bit cartridge, right?
6319660	6322060	So the song sounded one way to us
6322060	6323660	because we heard the compressed audio,
6323660	6327340	but somebody rebuilt the music with the uncompressed audio
6327340	6329420	and it sounds different because they don't,
6329420	6331980	it doesn't sound so like tin can, I guess,
6331980	6334460	because it's compressed and it's really different.
6334460	6336420	So you should really check that out.
6336420	6339420	And SSJ100Matt's given you a convenient link in the chat
6339460	6341660	there for those that are listening live.
6341660	6343940	For those that are on the podcast,
6343940	6345340	I would just encourage you to go to YouTube
6345340	6348940	and look for, you know, Super Mario Brothers Uncompressed
6348940	6350860	or look for it on Google News
6350860	6352260	cause a lot of sites were covering this
6352260	6354620	cause it's very much like, wow,
6354620	6356140	like difference with the sound.
6356140	6358700	I don't know if, yeah, it's pretty cool.
6358700	6360380	Oh yeah, ACT-F points out it's on Discord.
6360380	6361500	Thank you, you're right.
6361500	6363740	Somebody posted a tweet and it wasn't my tweet,
6363740	6365860	somebody else's tweet over in Discord.
6365860	6368220	So a good cheap plug for our Discord
6368220	6370500	if you wanna join us over at vognetwork.com,
6370500	6373660	vognetwork.com slash Discord.
6373660	6375600	Dr. Tsuya is saying I saw something similar
6375600	6377620	for the Donkey Kong Country OST.
6377620	6379220	I think I remember seeing that too.
6379220	6380220	That was pretty wild.
6381100	6383500	All right, before we get to last minute stories
6383500	6385860	or any further questions, let's get to the mailbag.
6385860	6387620	We have a couple of emails tonight.
6387620	6391300	So let's start with another quick one.
6391300	6392660	I think this is from the same one
6392660	6394340	who sent the quick email last week,
6394340	6397740	but this time it's signed so I can give credit.
6398140	6399580	So here's our first email for tonight.
6399580	6400620	If you wanna email us,
6400620	6402980	participate at orangelaungeradio.com
6402980	6404300	is the place to send it.
6404300	6406740	So the email tonight goes,
6406740	6410440	what is the most boring video game you have ever played?
6410440	6413320	And it's signed D from Waterloo, Iowa.
6414580	6417980	I'm laughing cause I can't help but think of the ABBA song.
6417980	6420840	I'm sure you're, if you really are from Waterloo, Iowa,
6420840	6422520	you're probably sick as hell of that joke,
6422520	6425600	but I can't help it, it's a good song, it's a bop.
6425600	6427340	All right, back to the question though.
6427780	6430300	What is the most boring video game you've ever played?
6431860	6432700	I don't even know.
6432700	6436920	I'm trying to think of something that's incredibly boring.
6441040	6444220	I get very bored with tactical games.
6444220	6446600	So I'm not gonna make a lot of friends with this answer,
6446600	6448660	but I'm gonna say Disgaea.
6448660	6449740	Sorry.
6449740	6452220	I just cannot get into those tactical games,
6452220	6455340	try as I might, except for some reason,
6455340	6457260	Final Fantasy Tactics, exception to the rule.
6458020	6458860	I can play that and I love that game.
6458860	6461620	Maybe it's just because I've always been kind of a,
6461620	6463380	you know, Final Fantasy fan boy,
6463380	6464380	and I'm willing to admit that.
6464380	6466020	So maybe I kind of cut that game a break
6466020	6467700	where I didn't a lot of other games,
6467700	6470100	but I just, I could not get into like
6470100	6473420	the really hardcore tactical stuff like Disgaea,
6473420	6475020	or even when it comes to like Advance Wars,
6475020	6476500	I can't get into that either.
6476500	6480020	And so I just, I don't get very excited playing those games
6480020	6482440	and they don't hold my attention very long.
6482440	6484220	I know that answer is not gonna be popular.
6484220	6485820	I'm not saying they're bad games.
6485860	6487780	I'm just saying they're not for me.
6487780	6492060	So Bobby Black Wolf in chat says desert bus.
6492060	6492900	DJ Rama S says-
6492900	6494780	I mean, that's the obvious one.
6494780	6498500	DJ Rama S says Final Fantasy VIII game was trash.
6499820	6501800	TigerClownChat says a game can get boring
6501800	6503620	when the action becomes repetitive.
6503620	6504900	That's true too.
6506900	6507940	What do you think, Loki?
6507940	6509240	Did you think of anything?
6510480	6514620	No, I mean, typically I'm not playing boring games.
6514620	6516820	Why would I subject myself through all that?
6516820	6517660	Yeah.
6519460	6522900	I know there's been things I've subjected myself to.
6522900	6525840	Usually it's when it becomes like a grind
6525840	6527140	that it gets kind of boring.
6527140	6531300	I guess like, I don't know if I'm like
6533020	6534700	trying to like a hundred percent something,
6534700	6537020	I would think that sometimes it might be boring,
6537020	6540020	but like typically I just don't spend time
6540020	6541640	playing boring games.
6541640	6543580	I don't have enough time as it is.
6543620	6545220	I'm not going to just spend time
6545220	6546960	playing all these boring games.
6549660	6553960	Harry Potter, the Harry Potter game on mobile,
6553960	6557600	the Niantic game, that's pretty boring.
6557600	6559500	TigerClownChat says the type of games
6559500	6562120	where you only do a single thing the entire game
6562120	6564340	can get boring when there isn't variety.
6564340	6566640	You know, TigerClown, I see that,
6566640	6568820	and I know there are games that exhibit that,
6568820	6572180	but I also think that there have been some incredible games
6572180	6573460	that are simple.
6574300	6576980	I think of a game like Kaboom, there's not a lot to it.
6576980	6580700	You catch bombs in the little water wells, that's it.
6580700	6583340	You spend a little, but something about,
6583340	6586360	in like a lot of those older games on the Atari 2600
6586360	6589620	had incredibly simple themes and could be repetitive,
6589620	6592300	but if it was the right mix,
6592300	6594300	then it actually was a lot of fun.
6594300	6597060	But I will say, and to your credit, TigerClaw,
6597060	6599140	there were a lot of Atari 2600 games
6599140	6602500	that were also very boring and got old very fast
6602540	6603860	for a very similar reason.
6603860	6605260	In fact, here's another, you know what,
6605260	6607680	is another great answer to this question, in my opinion,
6607680	6609260	if you wanna go back to Atari 2600,
6609260	6611500	and again, you're not gonna like it
6611500	6613920	because a lot of people put this game up on a pedestal,
6613920	6617300	and I'm not sure why, Sword Quest.
6617300	6618820	You remember those games, Sword Quest Fire,
6618820	6620380	Sword Quest Earth, Sword Quest,
6620380	6622900	I think they only ever really finished two of them.
6622900	6624900	I'm sorry, they're not, like,
6624900	6626560	they're not that great of games
6626560	6629860	because they just try to kinda do a lot,
6629860	6631860	and it's excruciatingly hard,
6631940	6633380	and if you don't have the manual,
6633380	6635780	you don't know what the hell you're doing,
6635780	6637660	I get that some people ate that shit up
6637660	6640420	when they were a kid, and the whole contest around it,
6640420	6642540	and they wanna see that fourth game released,
6642540	6645300	I'm sorry, that is a 2600 game I couldn't get into,
6645300	6648380	and I find it to be, quite frankly, a little bit boring.
6648380	6651900	Pod Culture in Chat says, ET, that could be two, yeah.
6653300	6654360	As Joan Hunter-Matt says,
6654360	6657480	Dynasty Warriors has made a genre out of endlessly hacking
6657480	6659220	and slashing a large group of enemies.
6659220	6661060	See the Zelda, Gundam, and so forth.
6661100	6661940	You know what, though?
6661940	6663540	But I think that Zelda, the Zelda version,
6663540	6665340	the Hyrule Warriors was a lot of fun.
6665340	6668380	So, you know, I can, I get that.
6668380	6672540	You know, 99 Nights, eh, it got a little boring,
6672540	6676620	but, you know, I love the Hyrule Warriors, at least,
6676620	6678220	so is that, so.
6678220	6679460	Anyway, something to think about,
6679460	6681540	and again, I also bring up the whole, like,
6681540	6683220	you know, simple, repetitive thing,
6683220	6685680	because as I was saying at the top of the show,
6685680	6687820	this whole Pixel Poops thing, you know,
6687820	6689760	as much as you might giggle and laugh
6689800	6692480	at the name and the silly concept,
6692480	6696500	it's actually, like, the simplicity of it is a lot of fun,
6696500	6700600	and it is a great Atari 2600-esque kind of game.
6700600	6703700	I haven't played Loki's interpretation of it enough yet,
6703700	6704760	but I'm imagining it's gonna be
6704760	6705920	a very similar type of thing.
6705920	6707260	Yours is probably gonna be more of, like,
6707260	6710040	a puzzle type of thing, it really sounds like.
6710040	6712520	Is that you have to get the poop in the right place.
6713440	6714560	Well, not necessarily.
6714560	6716800	I mean, it's just a puzzle.
6716800	6719480	It's not, I hardly call it a puzzle game.
6720080	6723520	I mean, it's like an old arcade game.
6723520	6725840	I mean, that's kind of what it's based on.
6725840	6729760	So, like, you know, you just have a simple goal,
6729760	6732680	and you just have to, you have to strategize a little bit,
6732680	6734720	because you don't wanna be,
6736220	6737680	because of some of the level design,
6737680	6740380	you have to think about where stuff's going,
6740380	6743560	and, you know, try not to get too far away,
6743560	6747000	and manage how much, you know, food you have,
6747000	6747840	and all that stuff.
6748280	6749840	There's a little bit of thought into it,
6749840	6754660	but I don't know, stop solving puzzles.
6754660	6755960	I've mentioned this on a show before,
6755960	6759440	in Aaron's Atari-inspired Pixel Poops,
6759440	6760880	there's, like, a few things,
6760880	6762240	there's a few twists that you might not expect.
6762240	6764020	Like, when the score reaches a certain limit,
6764020	6765600	some other stuff starts happening,
6765600	6768160	and that's very Atari 2600-esque,
6768160	6770440	that, like, it just instinctively gets harder
6770440	6771260	at a certain point.
6771260	6773160	And I discovered in the game last night, you guys,
6773160	6774360	I didn't know this before.
6774360	6776760	You ready for a Pixel Poops hot tip, okay?
6776760	6777840	You ready for this?
6777840	6780200	I did not realize until last night,
6780200	6782660	if you walk through the door,
6782660	6785860	it automatically ports you to that little white line
6785860	6787640	where you refill the tacos.
6787640	6789140	I didn't know that until last night,
6789140	6790840	and maybe I'm not supposed to be saying that,
6790840	6793440	but that's my hot tip, my YouTube tip.
6793440	6794900	Number two will shock you.
6794900	6797560	That is, literally, that is my little tip
6797560	6799380	I learned about the game, and I didn't realize that.
6799380	6802800	And just being able to save, like, five squares of movement
6802800	6805780	by doing that, let me tell you, game changer.
6807200	6808480	All right.
6808480	6811440	Anyhow, YYR's in chat, by the way.
6811440	6813220	I think he missed the plugs in the beginning of the show,
6813220	6814360	but he's here now, and he says,
6814360	6816520	I can vouch for Pixel Poops number two.
6816520	6818560	It's definitely a different, deeper,
6818560	6821060	and more challenging game than the original.
6821060	6823640	If you buy it, you will find it to be worth your money.
6823640	6826160	So he's saying it's some deep shit.
6826160	6829000	All right.
6830000	6831940	All right, enough plugs, enough plugs.
6831940	6834520	Let's get into one more email here.
6834520	6837220	Thank you, Dee, for the email.
6837220	6839400	Next email, Fabrice from Belgium.
6839400	6841780	We haven't heard from this individual in a very long time.
6841780	6844220	Good to hear you from you again, my friend.
6844220	6845260	Hello, everyone.
6845260	6846740	It's been a while since I wrote in,
6846740	6850300	but I'm still loyally listening since 2006.
6850300	6852280	Wow, that means, that's 15 years.
6852280	6853940	Thank you so much for that.
6853940	6856400	I was wondering what you think Sega's place
6856400	6859300	in video game history is and will be.
6859300	6861520	Sega made four main consoles,
6861520	6866080	and they are now longer out of hardware
6866080	6867940	than they were in it.
6867940	6869300	Ah, interesting point.
6869300	6872660	So yes, the Dreamcast was discontinued 20 years ago.
6872660	6875640	Also, Sony made five main consoles.
6875640	6878220	Microsoft now has four too.
6878220	6880800	Although I still think Sega remains legendary,
6880800	6882580	but that's me since I'm a fan boy.
6882580	6884400	The truth is that for a lot of people,
6884400	6888440	the PlayStation 2 or the Xbox 360 was their first console.
6888440	6891540	For them, Sega is just another game company.
6891540	6894240	It feels like the vibe I have about Atari.
6894240	6896360	They were an important video game company,
6896360	6898400	but to me, they don't mean a lot.
6898400	6900860	Well, as always, thank you for making the show.
6900860	6903640	You make the mess we are in now a lot more bearable.
6903640	6904940	Thank you so much for that.
6904940	6906800	Yours truly, Fabrice from Belgium.
6906800	6910360	Thank you for that kindhearted sentiment at the end there.
6910360	6911620	Let's tackle the question.
6911620	6915060	What do you think Sega's place in gaming history will be?
6915060	6918740	Loki, you want to take this on, or I have an idea?
6918740	6924180	I mean, Sonic, I don't know.
6924180	6928020	They have a solid library of stuff
6928020	6929900	that they'll be known for.
6929900	6933660	And they're still kind of like, even their philosophy
6933660	6936820	as far as how they treat fan games, I think,
6936820	6938580	is something that I wish would be adopted
6938580	6942900	by some other companies, like Nintendo.
6942900	6945300	So I don't know.
6945300	6950340	I think there's still just plenty to remember them by.
6950340	6951780	Yeah.
6951780	6952700	Some comments in chat.
6952700	6955480	Quest Buster says, Sega's iconic and one of the greats.
6955480	6957340	Whatever happens to it now can't take away
6957340	6959180	its impact on game history.
6959180	6961220	I think to find the answer to your question, Fabrice,
6961220	6962780	I think we would have to do something
6962780	6965100	that we do a lot in gaming, and that
6965100	6969540	is look at the parallels in other entertainment venues,
6969540	6971420	namely movies.
6971420	6972940	Let's look at the movie industry.
6972940	6978460	And there are a lot of movies that came out a long time ago
6978460	6982180	from studios and companies that are no longer around.
6982180	6984300	And kind of like you say in the email
6984300	6986780	when you talk about Atari and so forth,
6986780	6990340	there are some movies that people today don't necessarily
6990340	6992260	care about, right?
6992260	6996260	And I mean older movies, like an old musical.
6996260	6997860	Say The Wizard of Oz.
6997860	6999560	There are some people that will tell you,
6999560	7000980	I love The Wizard of Oz.
7000980	7003340	I love this movie so much because I
7003340	7005020	used to watch it when I was a kid,
7005020	7006980	and it was on TV at Thanksgiving.
7006980	7008340	And my family would get together,
7008340	7011420	and we'd love The Wizard of Oz, or replace that
7011420	7013740	with The Sound of Music.
7013740	7015540	That's my favorite musical of all time,
7015540	7019380	even though these things were out a generation ago, right?
7019380	7021140	So there's some people that look back on it
7021140	7022880	and remember it very fondly, but there's
7022880	7026420	other people that go, those movies are so hard to watch.
7026420	7028540	They just they look so bad.
7028540	7029980	They're grainy.
7030380	7032460	They're musicals.
7032460	7034820	All the movies, they're older musicals,
7034820	7038780	and I don't like musicals, and so on and so on.
7038780	7042100	Or you take another movie from the past
7042100	7044700	that maybe just doesn't hold up well over time,
7044700	7048380	where it's really hard to look at it through a 2021 lens
7048380	7051260	because culture has shifted so much.
7051260	7057460	So my point is, I think Sega has a place in that part of history
7057460	7060700	where it's like they are what a classic movie studio was,
7060700	7064740	what maybe like an MGM or something was back in the day.
7064740	7066540	That's where Sega holds up.
7066540	7068380	And there's going to be some people till the end of time
7068380	7070140	that are like, I love Sonic.
7070140	7072380	I played Sonic the Hedgehog growing up,
7072380	7076940	or my dad made me play Sonic because he played it growing up
7076940	7078140	and this was a thing.
7078140	7080580	And I think it'll be a thing that gets brought out
7080580	7082020	once in a while.
7082020	7085500	Like, oh, remember this old game that we grew up with?
7085500	7086020	It's funny.
7086020	7089060	Actually, I talked about the classic gaming store visit
7089060	7091660	earlier today, right?
7091660	7093940	When I was there, it was just me in there
7093940	7095500	and a couple of the employees.
7095500	7098860	And at some point, a family came in, and they were looking at,
7098860	7101260	they have Nintendo old 8-bit cartridges
7101260	7102740	that are in the glass case.
7102740	7106100	And there was a kid, like six or seven years old,
7106100	7108540	that was very fascinated with the cartridges.
7108540	7111220	They were something he'd seen in a textbook somewhere
7111220	7112860	or in a movie he was fascinated with.
7112860	7115700	He's like, wow, look at all these old games.
7115700	7117300	Look at all these games.
7117300	7118180	He's very fascinated.
7118180	7120860	And the dad was there, and the mom was there too,
7120860	7122580	although it was kind of a family of four.
7122580	7124020	And the mom kind of went off to another part
7124020	7125300	of the store with a girl.
7125300	7127320	So it was just the dad and the little boy.
7127320	7129380	And the dad was saying, yeah, these
7129380	7130860	are the games that I grew up on.
7130860	7133420	Can you guess which one I like to play a lot?
7133420	7136740	And I remember the girl saying something about Donkey Kong
7136740	7137380	or something.
7137380	7139580	So they were kind of having a discussion like that.
7139580	7142620	So I mean, that's, again, even though they
7142620	7144900	don't make Nintendo games and NES cartridges anymore,
7144900	7147180	and I wasn't nosy enough to hear whatever the game really
7147180	7150000	was that he played a lot of, it's
7150000	7151700	probably by a company that doesn't really
7151700	7153140	exist in the same way anymore.
7153140	7155540	For all I know, that man said the correct answer, which
7155540	7156880	would be The Guardian legend.
7156880	7157380	Just kidding.
7157380	7158300	It wasn't in the case.
7158300	7160700	I looked.
7160700	7163460	And that's from a company that no longer exists,
7163460	7166280	but it doesn't negate that they made a great piece of art that
7166280	7167420	still holds up.
7167420	7171100	So let me get some more comments from chat.
7171100	7174480	SSG100Matt says, also, Sega has the most brilliant ad
7174520	7176760	campaign in gaming history.
7176760	7179080	They spent a lot of money and geared the genesis
7179080	7182480	to teens, which went against Nintendo's family model.
7182480	7184620	As SSG100Matt continues, I think Sega
7184620	7186000	opened the door for a company that
7186000	7188720	can take on the big names like Nintendo, Atari, et cetera,
7188720	7189800	in their own game.
7189800	7192600	They went the distance, and we enjoyed the ride.
7192600	7195720	Tigerclaw on chat was talking about my parallels there,
7195720	7198840	saying, as much as I like the old movies from my childhood,
7198840	7200800	I don't really go back to watching them again,
7200800	7202080	because I've already seen them.
7202080	7204040	When I see a movie, it's about the first time
7204080	7205600	I've seen something new.
7205600	7207440	It's hard to go back and watch them again,
7207440	7208920	knowing how they begin and end.
7208920	7211400	See, that is so not like me, Tigerclaw.
7211400	7213400	You guys know I've seen The Rocky Horror Picture
7213400	7216620	Show probably 500 times, easily, easily, in a theater,
7216620	7217440	nonetheless.
7217440	7218400	Not even that.
7218400	7220840	A movie like Clue, easily 100 times.
7220840	7224080	Showgirls, easily 50 times.
7224080	7226040	Those are cult movies, of course,
7226040	7229880	that are kind of meant to be watched or rewatched.
7229880	7233640	But even sometimes there's like comfort food for movies.
7234240	7236520	I was just browsing around Peacock on the Xbox.
7236520	7237920	I was like, oh, what'd they put on the service?
7237920	7239840	And I was like, Mama Mia.
7239840	7242520	And I watched Mama Mia start to finish on Peacock.
7242520	7243560	I didn't even need to watch that.
7243560	7245560	I have the fucking Blu-ray somewhere,
7245560	7246840	but I was just feeling lazy.
7246840	7247920	It's literally right in front of me.
7247920	7250160	Push A to play, okay.
7250160	7252120	Maybe it's in 4K, I don't know.
7252120	7254160	And they even fucking put commercials in it,
7254160	7255640	but I was like, whatever.
7255640	7256680	It's kind of like watching a TV.
7256680	7258920	I wasn't like actively watching it.
7258920	7261800	I was kind of playing around on my phone,
7261800	7263540	kind of like it's on in the background.
7264300	7266780	But that movie, as cheesy as it,
7266780	7270120	I admit is a cheesy, ridiculous movie,
7270120	7273720	but it is so comfort food for me because I love the music.
7273720	7277840	I love ABBA, you know, whatever.
7277840	7280480	It's just, it's a group I grew up with for a long time.
7280480	7283580	So that movie's comfort food for me.
7283580	7285660	And I think, again,
7285660	7288960	that's what Sega games are gonna be for a lot of people.
7290860	7292020	Quest Buster in chat says,
7292060	7295780	and thank you Sega for bringing Valkyria Chronicles 4 over
7295780	7298220	for taking risks like that for the fans.
7298220	7299140	Pod Culture says,
7299140	7302540	I've probably seen Serenity about 20 times in the theater.
7302540	7303500	DJ Rama S says,
7303500	7306060	I feel the same way when I watch anime on Funimation,
7306060	7307260	Hulu, and Crunchyroll.
7307260	7308740	Yeah, I have the DVD or Blu-ray,
7308740	7310020	but dammit it's right there
7310020	7311540	and I'm gonna watch and enjoy it.
7311540	7312460	Thank you.
7312460	7313700	You understand what I mean.
7313700	7315860	And someday,
7315860	7319780	someday those Sega games are just gonna be in the cloud.
7319780	7321660	In fact, many of them already are.
7322180	7323460	Push A to start, you know,
7323460	7325780	and that's the way it's gonna be.
7325780	7328540	So that's my long-winded answer to your question, Fabrice.
7328540	7331100	I think Sega, there's always gonna be a place for Sega.
7331100	7332940	Sega will always have a corner
7332940	7335140	in any video game history museum.
7335140	7339420	But as far as do people hold it fondly or what,
7339420	7342680	that's just gonna depend on their culture.
7342680	7345280	And I'm not talking about like where somebody is,
7345280	7347520	I'm talking about what they're surrounded with,
7347520	7348920	their family's influence,
7348920	7351300	their friends' influence and all of that.
7351820	7353140	That's what's gonna really play into
7353140	7354420	what somebody kind of thinks of Sega.
7354420	7355340	And like you said,
7355340	7358340	you don't really think a lot about Atari.
7358340	7360060	Realize there's gonna be some people,
7360060	7362540	especially now that Sega has been out of the business
7362540	7365380	20 years, that means somebody could have been born
7365380	7368160	after Sega was out of the business and is now an adult.
7368160	7369740	So you're gonna have to get used to the idea
7369740	7371220	that there's gonna be some,
7371220	7374420	I can't even say kids, adults, young adults now
7374420	7375260	who are gonna be like,
7375260	7376940	oh, I never really played a Sega game
7376940	7378980	cause they weren't really around.
7378980	7380460	Or, oh yeah, Sonic.
7380500	7383280	Yeah, I remember the Wii game that had him in it.
7384620	7385500	You know?
7385500	7387240	So it's just gonna be a little different.
7387240	7388700	So, all right.
7388700	7389740	Anyway, great question.
7389740	7391580	You mean that character from Smash Brothers?
7391580	7392420	Yeah, right?
7392420	7393440	Yeah, so.
7393440	7395740	Participate at orangesloungetrady.com
7395740	7397020	if you wanna send us an email.
7397020	7398220	Actually, one more thought, I'm sorry.
7398220	7400080	Fabrice, one more thought.
7400080	7401820	If you want more people to,
7401820	7404300	you have to educate the future.
7404300	7407380	You have to educate the children about Sega
7407380	7408860	and why you love them so much.
7408860	7410900	So, especially in your own family
7410900	7412900	and the people around you.
7412900	7414540	Even if you don't have kids of your own,
7414540	7416500	you probably know somebody with kids
7416500	7419540	and you can sure bring over that, you know,
7419540	7421040	Sega Dreamcast.
7421040	7423240	So, anyway, that's my thought.
7425180	7426020	All right.
7427300	7428140	That's it for emails.
7428140	7429700	If you wanna send us an email in a future week,
7429700	7433580	participate at orangesloungetrady.com.
7433580	7437340	YYR in chat says, oof, that character from Smash Brothers,
7437340	7439180	that just makes me sad.
7439180	7440680	But you know what?
7440680	7442880	As much as it might make you sad,
7442880	7447080	somebody is gonna go, what game is this character from?
7447080	7449060	I don't, he looks familiar.
7449060	7449900	What is this?
7449900	7451260	And might actually do some research.
7451260	7453060	There's gonna be some people that discover the game
7453060	7454660	because of Smash Brothers.
7454660	7456460	But I get it, it makes you feel old.
7456460	7457840	Believe me, I hear it.
7457840	7459260	All right.
7459260	7462140	Loki, any last minute stories for our audience tonight?
7462140	7464460	While I ask Chad if they have any other comments
7464460	7465300	or questions.
7466180	7469580	Yeah, so there was some leaks coming out
7469580	7472780	about the Sonic 30th anniversary.
7473700	7478700	So this is coming from a apparently credible leaker,
7479660	7481740	a Nintendo leaker, Zippo.
7481740	7484460	And so it's talking about, aside from, you know,
7484460	7486460	the voice cast has left Sonic,
7486460	7489540	so the voice of Sonic, Roger Craig Smith,
7489540	7491180	Sidney Robinson, the voice of Amy,
7491180	7494140	and Colleen, oh, I can't even pronounce her last name,
7494140	7496980	voice of Tails, all have departed.
7496980	7499140	And they're saying that the rest of the current voice cast
7499140	7501420	will be following them as well and leaving.
7502820	7507820	Apparently the Warren Graff and Ken Pontic
7508020	7509940	are no longer writing for the game.
7511760	7514860	And they're saying that the 30th anniversary
7514860	7517700	will be described as a new era for Sonic,
7517700	7520340	that the modern Sonic will focus on the franchise
7520340	7522720	going forward, both in 2D and 3D games.
7522760	7525840	Apparently Mania was a one-off,
7525840	7530240	and fans of the classic era should look to fan games
7530240	7531600	for further installments.
7533080	7534120	Wow.
7534120	7538640	The next 3D game apparently will be, you know,
7538640	7542720	full 3D games, you know, 3D spin dashing.
7542720	7545840	There's gonna be, you know, multiple playable characters.
7545840	7548320	Supposed to be out by holiday,
7548320	7551300	assuming it doesn't get delayed.
7551300	7554420	And with characters appearing,
7554420	7558260	more guest appearances in other games.
7560300	7561540	And then-
7561540	7562380	I hate to say it,
7562380	7564020	but this sounds like a recipe for disaster.
7564020	7565880	I mean, prove me wrong, prove me wrong.
7565880	7567420	But this whole, like,
7567420	7569700	if you wanna remember the classic Sonic games,
7569700	7570700	go play fan games.
7570700	7573620	I mean, it's great that Sega embraces that, I'm happy.
7573620	7577180	But at the same time, it's like, remember Sonic 4?
7578060	7579140	Ooh.
7579140	7580660	Yeah.
7581580	7582420	Apparently though,
7582420	7587420	they're also supposed to be working on a 2D game as well.
7587420	7589100	Someone's working on one of those.
7589100	7591300	So there's a new Sonic collection.
7591300	7592860	Remember, they'll be coming out in June.
7592860	7597860	It's gonna feature, you know, majority of the classic games.
7600060	7602160	Yeah, so I guess we'll have to wait and see
7602160	7604100	when any of this stuff gets announced.
7605660	7606500	All right.
7607860	7608980	That's pretty much it.
7609020	7609860	That's it.
7609860	7610700	All right.
7610700	7612740	Well, I guess we're gonna wrap up then.
7612740	7614140	I know it's only just after eight,
7614140	7617300	but we don't have Jamie here tonight to get opinions from.
7617300	7619500	So, but she'll be back next week.
7619500	7620340	Assumable.
7620340	7621500	Oh, I was gonna say,
7621500	7622980	I don't know if we didn't talk about it,
7622980	7627980	but they're so, they have had the like a preview of,
7628620	7631380	or I don't know if it's, it's sort of open,
7631380	7634020	but the new Super Nintendo World,
7634020	7636260	they've have video now of all the rides.
7636260	7637100	Yeah.
7637140	7639300	Come out and stuff like that.
7639300	7641460	What have your thoughts been on that?
7641460	7646300	Like is Mario Kart rides kind of a little,
7646300	7649180	not what I was hoping it would be.
7649180	7650540	It looks fun.
7650540	7654860	It looks kind of like a midway mania or something like that,
7654860	7657440	but more AR, which is cool.
7658380	7660700	But normally when I think of Mario Kart,
7660700	7664300	I think of much faster than that.
7664300	7667380	And that's not a very fast ride.
7667380	7671140	The videos never are as good of an experience
7671140	7672320	as the real thing.
7674740	7679580	And I wanna see what it looks like out after the pandemic
7679580	7681620	and what it looks like in America.
7681620	7683520	Not that those things are necessarily gonna suddenly
7683520	7684680	make that ride any different,
7684680	7686740	but they may be holding back on some effects
7686740	7689500	and some things because they don't want the air
7689500	7691980	to circulate a certain way or what have you.
7691980	7695940	And in Japan, the size of things tends to be
7695940	7696780	a little bit smaller
7696780	7699500	because they don't have as much space to work with.
7699500	7701260	That's what happened with DisneySea, I think,
7701260	7703180	is actually a relatively small Disney property
7703180	7705060	because they didn't have a lot of space to build with.
7705060	7707380	So I'm just a little curious to see what it looks like.
7707380	7710400	But I mean, again, I could watch those videos and go,
7710400	7711560	I didn't really care for that.
7711560	7714260	And I kind of don't know, but I was like,
7714260	7715420	I just wanna see it in person.
7715420	7717220	I just feel like I'm gonna give it,
7717220	7720220	like I could sit here and go, it didn't look fun at all.
7720260	7722900	Like hell, I'm not gonna be going there
7722900	7725180	in the first couple months after it opens
7725180	7728360	to take it all in for myself
7728360	7731560	and get a thousand billion selfies for Instagram
7731560	7732980	with everything that's there.
7732980	7735980	So like, you know, the videos, they're interesting,
7735980	7738340	but let's see what it looks like
7738340	7740120	when the world's back to normal a little bit
7740120	7742380	and what it looks like here in the States.
7743480	7745380	That's my thought.
7745380	7747580	Orange right in chat says,
7747580	7749300	yeah, I was thinking it would be a lot faster,
7749340	7750780	but it looks like it's pretty slow.
7750780	7753060	Pixelpaca says, even if Disney C is small,
7753060	7754020	it's utterly gorgeous.
7754020	7756780	Oh yeah, but Disney and all these companies,
7756780	7758880	they are very good at playing optical illusions.
7758880	7763500	Very good with making your eyes believe certain things
7763500	7764900	that may or may not be true.
7764900	7766260	And I'll kind of leave it at that.
7766260	7767980	But that's part of the Disney magic.
7767980	7769620	That's what makes a company like Disney
7769620	7772140	and Universal is very good at theme park stuff too.
7772140	7774140	That's what makes these companies do well
7774140	7775840	in the theme park business is that,
7775840	7778940	you know, they know what the F they're doing.
7779460	7780300	That's for sure.
7780300	7782900	So anything else, Logie?
7782900	7783840	No, that's it.
7783840	7784680	All right.
7784680	7787340	Well, let's get final thoughts then before we wrap it up,
7787340	7788660	I do want to say thank you guys so much
7788660	7790460	for listening to Orange Launch Radio this week.

7809260	7811460	Auto hosts, a VOG network on Twitch
7811460	7812820	are one of the best things you can do.
7812820	7815300	So thank you, thank you to those of you that do that.
7815300	7816900	Unfortunately, I don't have a list in front of me,
7816900	7820140	but just know if you're doing that, I really appreciate it.
7820140	7823020	So those go a long way as well.
7823020	7824260	Thank you for being here tonight.
7824260	7825740	I know there's a lot of, you know,
7825740	7827560	big stuff going on in the world.
7827560	7829380	So just appreciate you spending a little extra time
7829380	7830220	with us tonight.
7830220	7831700	Even if you're on the podcast feed,
7831700	7833140	hey, I appreciate you taking the time out
7833140	7836380	to listen to the podcast like Fabrice has since 2006.
7836420	7837860	Really appreciate that.
7837860	7841380	And everybody out there listening, thank you so much.

7858260	7859820	So I think that's it.
7859820	7861320	Now we can get everybody's final thoughts
7861320	7862160	and then we'll be out of here.
7862160	7863660	So Loki, I'll start with you.
7863660	7865280	You got a big week ahead of you.
7865280	7867240	Yeah, just rushing, rushing, rushing,
7867240	7870080	trying to get stuff done, so yeah.
7870960	7875220	And my final thought is I have some more project ideas
7875220	7877360	of my own stewing, but I just have to, you know,
7877360	7878540	be able to stick with something.
7878540	7882520	And it's been a little crazy in these pandemic times,
7882520	7885800	but I'm hoping there'll be more creative stuff real soon.
7885800	7888120	So anyway, we will see you in seven days.
7888120	7891320	Happy gaming, have a wonderful night everybody
7891320	7893540	and stay safe out there.
7893540	7894380	We'll see you next week.
