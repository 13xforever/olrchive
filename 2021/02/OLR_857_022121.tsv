0	30000	Years ago I was watching a compilation of best video game trailers, and all the best ones were for games I've never played and don't have any interest in and I was disappointed about that. Fast forward just a bit and we finally reach the part of the timeline where game universes and other forms of media are getting good. While I'm not a mobile player, I am still delighted to see that Dota 2 is getting its own animated series this year. This is my favorite headline of the night, now it's time for your host,
30000	37000	Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring you detail on this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
60000	67000	I'm Rob Roberts and I'm joined virtually via the magic of Discord with my co-hosts. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
67000	69000	Hi, how are you?
69000	73000	I don't...
73000	79000	Your internet is a little bit choppy, I think, because you're cutting out a little bit, but that's alright.
79000	84000	It's like having a Zoom call during work. Are you there? Are you on mute?
84000	96000	Oh my god, I don't even know what's going on because it was affecting work yesterday and my speeds and everything are great, so I think that it's just time to replace this dinosaur.
96000	101000	Well the good news is the complaining is coming through loud and clear, so I think we have you back.
101000	105000	All I need to do is bitch about everything then, for fuck's sake.
105000	109000	When life gives you lemons, ask to speak to life's manager.
109000	129000	Alright, anyway, we were doing a little show and tell before the show tonight and I thought maybe you'd want to show some of our Twitch listeners, or yeah, Twitch viewers of course, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network over at twitch.tv slash vog network, that's VOG Network, at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
129000	144000	But don't worry, for the podcast folks, I'm not just going to make you sit there in silence. If you subscribe to us on a popular platform like Spotify or iTunes or whatever, Google Podcasts, whatever it is you used to listen to us, I know you can't see, but I'll talk you through it here.
144000	157000	So Dark Sakura has some things. So like, you know, as if this vault, which is more of a metaphorical vault at this point, it's not an actual vault anymore, but we have some new things, right?
157000	162000	So Dark Sakura, talk us through some of these, these things you've added to your collection, and where did you get this from?
162000	179000	Well, and right now, I guess my office here is like my nerd cave officially. So back in the day, of course, you know, my husband used to work at a GameStop and GameCrazy, that was the Hollywood video one, and we would acquire some of their advertisement products.
179000	186000	So I'll hold up the first one. It is a ginormous PS2 box for a Parappa the Rapper 2.
186000	201000	I love the giant oversized game boxes. I don't know what it is about them. I like just like fake giant oversized product in general. I guess it reminds me of Supermarket Sweep when they have to grab the large inflatable thing. I don't know. Anyway, what else you got?
201000	202000	So that was Parappa.
202000	203000	You ready for number two?
203000	205000	Yes, I am.
205000	210000	Oh, what a cool it's a blow up of Busta is that it's Busta Groove, right?
210000	217000	Yeah, it's the US one, of course, because I don't know that. Did they do these in Japan? I don't know. But at any rate, you know, like I was going to pass that shit up.
217000	226000	Oh, yeah, that's that's a keeper right there. I love that one. So it's a giant oversized of that. And then here we go. Maximo.
226000	235000	Yeah, and like Maximo is kind of the maybe a spiritual successor to Ghosts and Goblins, Ghouls and Ghosts.
235000	242000	Which those games are back in the news this week. We'll get into that in just a little bit. We have a very busy intro to our show tonight.
242000	247000	I love that now. Now give us. So that's the Final Fantasy 10 box for those listening on the podcast.
247000	252000	And I love that they have the front and the back so somebody could pick that up and pick the giant box up and read the back.
252000	255000	Now you have to give us your best Titus laugh.
255000	258000	No.
258000	263000	Jamie's like, I don't have to do anything.
263000	267000	Perfect. Or should I say all right.
267000	272000	Oh, Kingdom Hearts. Is that one or two? It's Kingdom Hearts one, right? Kingdom hearts. Love it.
272000	277000	Yep. That's awesome. That game was like brand new the very first week we did.
277000	281000	Oh, well, I remember that there were some people that were playing through that for the first time. So you ready for the last one?
281000	288000	All right. Yes, I am. Because we've got to introduce. Oh, yes. Final Fantasy seven, the original on PlayStation complete.
288000	292000	This is probably my most munched one.
292000	299000	But this is, I think, one of the first ones we ever acquired. And it's these are going nowhere except on my wall.
299000	307000	You know, I was going to say, if we are ever able to get back together in person again, hopefully, hopefully the vaccine won't take.
307000	313000	You're not going on your wall. These are going on my wall. It doesn't have to be on my wall, but we can maybe borrow them for a photo shoot or something.
313000	322000	Yeah, I would do that. You know, Rob, I would gladly lend these to whatever new studio happens to come into the future.
322000	328000	I think the last actual photo shoot we did with the three of us was like a lot.
328000	336000	It was like 10 years ago. Like I, I, I look great with all my hair, but it was a long time ago.
336000	342000	Well, my hair was when I was dying it myself.
342000	348000	Oh, yeah. And there was a little bit more of me at the time. So we've all we've all changed a little bit.
348000	352000	All right. Well, let's also say hello to Tech Master Loki.
352000	361000	Hello. Who's also changed in 10 years because now he's I don't know, maybe I need to stop calling him Tech Master Loki and call him Game Developer Loki.
361000	365000	It doesn't have the same ring to it. OK, I guess. Yeah, it's true. It doesn't have the same ring to it.
365000	373000	I guess I guess you're stuck with the old name. So how are sales of pixel poops going through the roof?
373000	377000	No. All right.
377000	385000	Well, you know, you just make sure you get out there and promote and do all that good stuff, you know, because it's it's going to be hard after the first week.
385000	388000	You know, it is what it is. All right.
388000	395000	Well, we hope most of our listeners have checked that out by now over on itch.io or steam pixel poops number two.
395000	402000	And on steam, you have to look up the main pixel poops game. But I would also recommend that to all all of our listeners here at Orange Lounge Radio.
402000	408000	But we've talked at length about that. So my question to this for you this week is what now?
408000	411000	Like, obviously, we'll get into your gaming week a little later in the show.
411000	415000	So I'm talking about what you played, but like what's going through your mind now about what you want to do next?
415000	422000	Or you focus now on, oh, I got to go back and I got to upgrade pixel poops, too, for that physical release that everybody's asking about.
422000	432000	So I've been working on like a few things, just like I purchase a few more boards to come inside, seven more coming in.
432000	441000	So I have like a total of 12 cartridges now because just the supply is not there's not a lot of supply out there for that stuff.
441000	446000	So I got what I could with that. I have been looking at what I'm going to do next.
446000	453000	I wasn't really sure. There's an NES game jam that's in March.
453000	460000	They may do. I don't know. But yeah, I have lots of ideas of things I could work on.
460000	466000	I may do another NES game. I have an idea for one, so I may do that.
466000	470000	All right. Go into our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
470000	475000	Zen Monkey regarding your name is suggesting Game Master Loki.
475000	478000	I don't know. That might be too much for the ego, Zen Monkey. I like the name.
478000	480000	It does have a much better ring to it. Game Master Loki.
480000	487000	But I like I imagine like Loki probably would get his butt whooped at most video games by a lot of people out there on the Internet.
487000	494000	Yeah, we're probably we're in our 40s now, like.
494000	501000	I don't know if we're going to call ourselves the game master, but I I appreciate the thought and I do agree it has a better ring to it.
501000	504000	All right. I am the game mistress, the game mistress.
504000	511000	See, I I kind of like that in a way, but I think when I think game mistress, it's got to be more like Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.
511000	517000	That's that's the Jamie vibe I get. So, you know, yours, Cruelly.
517000	522000	Hi. Yes. Our Zoom meeting is still connected.
522000	528000	And I'm just like whatever about it right now. So I understand. All right.
528000	532000	Well, let's talk a little bit. You know what? Since we are joking about age and things like that.
532000	538000	And for the folks watching on Twitch tonight, we had a little parody at the beginning that was poking fun at age a little bit.
538000	547000	But, you know, this is this is the reality is that today one of the all time greatest franchises is turning 35 years old.
547000	562000	So today, February the 21st of 1986, is when the Famicom version of The Legend of Zelda released on the Famicom, which was actually the disk system at the time.
562000	571000	And you can play that original Japanese version of the game if you are a Nintendo Switch Pro person, because you can actually download it.
571000	575000	You just make a Japanese account on your Switch, which doesn't cost you any money to do.
575000	580000	And you just use that to get into the e-shop and download the Famicom player.
580000	584000	And then you can log into the Famicom player in your U.S. account that actually pays for the service.
584000	587000	And I imagine this works, you know, UK and other regions as well.
587000	590000	And then you can actually play the original.
590000	597000	So you get that little extra sound chip that the Famicom disk system had that didn't translate over to the Nintendo.
597000	603000	Really extra as much as different because the cartridges had were the ones that could get the extra chip.
604000	617000	True. But it did seem like games, there were a handful like that one, Metroid, Castlevania, you know, that sacrificed a little something as opposed to trying to, you know, because they couldn't really bring it over one for one.
617000	627000	One of the big things, though, is that actually Castlevania 3, when it came out, it had that extra chip that gave it another, I think, layer of sound.
627000	630000	Oh, right. Because it wasn't a disk game, of course. Right, right.
630000	636000	Exactly. And it also had extra animations and like a different attack for Grant. There were a few things.
636000	640000	Yeah. But anyway, this isn't about Castlevania, it's about Zelda.
640000	642000	It could be.
642000	650000	We love all the games, but I'm kind of curious, you know, because I know for me, this series has been hugely impactful.
650000	658000	And I guess I guess maybe I'll start first and talk a little bit about my memories of Zelda, because, you know, playing the very first original Legend of Zelda game.
658000	666000	Obviously, we got it a little bit later, but that was really the first game that I remember really wanting a Nintendo for.
666000	671000	Like, I liked playing Super Mario Brothers in the arcade, and I liked playing things like Ice Climbers and stuff like that, too.
671000	679000	And I remember playing some things at friends' houses, like my friend even had the Rob the Robot, and we tried to play, I think it was Stack'em, even though we didn't understand what the hell we were doing.
679000	684000	But, oh, and Hogan's Alley. I remember that one, too, because that was a game I really liked in the arcade.
684000	695000	But I remember that when I saw, like, the Legend of Zelda, that was the moment, and I would have been like eight or nine years old when I saw it, where I was like, oh, I've got to have this.
695000	704000	Like, this game is amazing, and I want to play this. I want this in my house. Mommy, Mommy, can I have an NES? Okay, we'll get straight A's.
704000	711000	And I did. I got straight A's. So, you know, I got a Nintendo, and that was pretty much the first game we bought.
711000	720000	Outside of, of course, it comes with, most of them came with Mario Brothers and Duck Hunt and all that, but Zelda was, like, the first game we bought.
720000	734000	And then I became so obsessed with that game, like, not just playing through the first quest, but playing through the second quest, that even though I got picked on a lot in school when I was growing up, because, you know, I was, you know, a little different,
735000	744000	the bullies would then want to talk to me more one-on-one to ask me things like, so where is, like, level seven in the second quest of Legend of Zelda, because I can't find it.
744000	760000	So it was a very interesting kind of, like, dynamic that played out there, but that was really the game that led to me becoming, like, the, and I'm using my quotey fingers, video game expert when I was younger, you know, the one in the class who, who knew everything about the games and read all the magazines and all that stuff.
760000	772000	So, yeah, that, and, you know, obviously from there, I, I, I still love Zelda 2. I got that the Christmas or holiday when that first came out, and I played the crap out of that.
772000	781000	I wasn't bothered by the changes. It was just a little different to me, but I really enjoyed the game. Of course, I loved A Link to the Past on Super Nintendo and on and on.
781000	790000	I, I did, I did lose the series a little bit because in college I fell out of gaming a little bit, and so I didn't transition to Nintendo 64.
790000	797000	When I did finally go to a new console, I went to PlayStation because that's where Final Fantasy was at, and that's, like, the, the big series.
797000	805000	So I kind of fell out of Zelda at that point, which I know, because Ocarina of Time is, like, the Zelda game for many, many people, but for, I had a different trajectory.
805000	813000	I kind of fell out at that point, and, you know, obviously I've rediscovered a lot of the love through more recent releases like Twilight Princess and so forth.
813000	821000	So, yeah, I mean, it's, it's just an all-time great series, but especially that original game has a real special place in my heart.
821000	831000	So I'm kind of curious about you guys and your memories of Zelda back in the day. Now, Jamie, how were, how were your thoughts on Zelda?
832000	840000	I played that when it came out more times than I can count because I played, you know, both quests and then I would play them again, and then I would play them again.
840000	849000	And, like, I wouldn't even bother getting, like, the, the red bracelet, I would just play through and, you know, I, it was just something I did.
849000	856000	And then I didn't like Zelda 2, you know, had good music, wasn't my favorite, although I like watching Dan play it.
856000	866000	And I mean, I, oh yeah, I remember that, you know, kind of thing. I really liked it. I had, I had the gold cartridge.
866000	875000	Um, gosh, I mean, the only thing that toppled it in my gaming esteem was the Guardian Legend.
875000	881000	And that takes a lot to topple, at the time, to topple that.
881000	894000	Even the Guardian Legend kind of owes a little bit to Zelda. And I think part of the reason why that game, you know, at least why I'm a fan of that game is because it's not just some of the best parts of Zelda, but then it's like a shooter 2.
894000	901000	You know, it's like the best part of both of those kind of coming together. And I think that's what that made, that made that game very special in many ways.
901000	911000	Well, and then there's other games that I really like that, of course, were influenced by that, like Newtopia and Newtopia 2 that were on the PC Engine or TurboGrafx.
911000	913000	Sure. I think a lot of...
913000	916000	So, a good number of...
916000	917000	Go ahead.
917000	928000	Oh, there's a good number of games that I like that were influenced by the first one, most of the top down games, you know, but I, I want to say that Legend of the Valkyrie came out before Legend of Zelda.
928000	936000	I have to double check that. So I also see some other games that I like influenced the Legend of Zelda.
936000	947000	That's true. Games that actually influenced the Legend of Zelda kind of going the other way. You know, I would think certainly something like Adventure on the Atari 2600 was kind of like an early, early, early kind of precursor to that style.
947000	957000	Like, obviously it's different. And obviously with the, you know, Atari 2600 is a very kind of, you know, I don't think it necessarily had the same leverage in Japan where obviously Zelda came from.
957000	958000	Go ahead, Jamie.
958000	962000	You remember though, before I had a NES, I had a ColecoVision.
962000	963000	Yep.
963000	967000	And my favorite game to play on ColecoVision was Venture.
967000	972000	You know, very top down adventure, dash in, grab the thing, dash out.
972000	980000	And I saw the Legend of Zelda as a very logical evolution of that scenario with more story.
980000	987000	And so that was also, you know, one of, you know, it probably even took some influences from Rogue. I mean, if you think about it.
987000	989000	Oh, sure. Yeah, that's a good one.
989000	990000	Yeah.
990000	997000	Bobby Blackwolf in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network points out Intellivision had the AD&D games that were top down dungeon crawlers.
997000	1006000	So it's kind of like there was kind of like a dungeon-y game on whatever you were playing at the time, but it just kind of depended on how they did it.
1006000	1008000	You know, they all did it a little differently.
1008000	1012000	I would probably say that Rogue would have been its great granddaddy.
1012000	1016000	Yeah, I think that's... did you just call Zelda a roguelike?
1016000	1018000	I did.
1018000	1019000	If you think about it.
1019000	1025000	Actually, I would say a lot of people are super into the Zelda randomizer stuff.
1025000	1028000	That is a roguelike. Absolutely.
1028000	1029000	That's the only kind of...
1029000	1031000	I'm more referring to the overall...
1031000	1033000	Oh, I get it. No, I get it.
1033000	1043000	The mythology of it where you have exploration that you do, you find secret panels, you have enemies to fight, you move your way through it, you map as you go.
1043000	1044000	Yeah.
1044000	1057000	So I think that I would even go on a limb and say that Rogue is probably one of our... Rogue and the tech space games married together, created our adventure RPG series.
1057000	1060000	As far as video games go.
1060000	1066000	How have you been with Zelda in the later years? Do you still try to play all the games that come out or have you fallen out a little bit?
1066000	1074000	I never could get into Majora's Mask because the moon thing creeped me the fuck out.
1074000	1078000	But I've beaten Ocarina of Time several times.
1078000	1081000	Link to the Past is my favorite ever.
1081000	1083000	I played the sequel to it.
1083000	1086000	Didn't really get too much into it.
1086000	1089000	We didn't play many of the...
1089000	1094000	I mean, I played Link's Awakening on Game Boy back in the day.
1094000	1098000	And of course, we have the remake on Switch.
1098000	1102000	Dan and I did Twilight Princess together.
1102000	1106000	And I fucking love Breath of the Wild. Don't even get me started on how much I loved it.
1106000	1114000	But we didn't play Skyward Sword for reasons, I think.
1114000	1117000	We just really didn't have a reason. It just didn't happen.
1117000	1121000	You're gonna get another chance not to get too far ahead, but we'll get to it.
1121000	1123000	Right. We're getting it. We are getting it.
1123000	1126000	Because Dan and I have been talking about, are we gonna get it? Are we gonna wait?
1126000	1129000	And then the announcement came, so yeah.
1129000	1133000	I think most people listening know it's coming, but we'll talk about that in a little bit.
1133000	1137000	Dan really enjoyed Four Swords Adventures. I didn't get into it that much.
1137000	1139000	Oh yeah, I liked that one too.
1139000	1142000	Man, those games that kind of utilized the Game Boy Advance and the GameCube.
1142000	1145000	There was only a couple of them, but they were all done so well.
1145000	1149000	Minish Cap was really cute, and I regret having not played more of that.
1149000	1155000	It was when I was going through a lot of video game ADD.
1155000	1161000	You were talking about the Link to the Past being one of the all-time greats.
1161000	1163000	And I totally agree.
1163000	1164000	It was my favorite.
1164000	1166000	I think it's my favorite Zelda 2 at the end of the day as well.
1166000	1170000	And honestly, one of my favorite video games in my top ten, like overall, ever, easily.
1170000	1173000	Maybe even top five. I have to really sit down and think about it.
1173000	1178000	But it is so many elements in it that just make it the perfect adventure game.
1178000	1179000	And it's so replayable.
1179000	1184000	But I think that's also why I really loved the Link Between Two Worlds that came out.
1184000	1185000	The Link Between Worlds.
1185000	1191000	Yeah, because that brought a lot of that same kind of style to it.
1191000	1194000	Well, I actually have to tell you something.
1194000	1198000	You know how steadfast my top three games have always been?
1198000	1199000	Right.
1199000	1201000	My top three games list has changed.
1201000	1203000	Ooh, how so?
1203000	1207000	Because I've been going back to play A Link to the Past.
1207000	1213000	And so I'm still going to say The Guardian Legend is number one, but A Link to the Past is number three now.
1213000	1214000	Fantasy Zone is number two.
1214000	1215000	Okay.
1215000	1219000	Space Harrier, I've decided it's more fun to watch people play it than actually play it.
1219000	1220000	Okay.
1220000	1222000	I love Space Harrier, don't get me wrong.
1222000	1228000	But number four is not a bad place to be of the millions of video games that have ever been made.
1228000	1232000	Well, I was actually going to say number four, Super Metroid.
1232000	1237000	Oh, well, hey, I'm okay with that choice.
1237000	1239000	That's my number one.
1239000	1242000	And guess what number five is that isn't Space Harrier?
1242000	1245000	Ooh, you've really demoted Space Harrier over time.
1245000	1248000	I have, because I enjoy watching other people play it more than actually playing it myself.
1248000	1254000	I would be shocked if Mass Effect isn't up there, just with how much that trilogy has done.
1254000	1266000	And actually it is a cross, probably a toss up between the Mass Effect as a series, because I consider all three of them basically one game in my heart.
1266000	1267000	Yeah, of course.
1267000	1278000	Or, I mean, I've got like a big tie list because I put the Mass Effect series and Dragon Age as, I guess, more of my modern favorites.
1278000	1280000	Like I have two lists of favorites.
1280000	1283000	I have my classic favorites and I have my more modern favorites.
1283000	1285000	You don't have to rank everything either, you know?
1285000	1286000	Divided by...
1286000	1288000	It's hard to rank art.
1288000	1292000	Divided by maybe the year 2000 gap.
1292000	1293000	Okay.
1293000	1296000	So my pre-California and my post-California.
1296000	1300000	Okay. Well, was that your five? Was Mass Effect slash Dragon Age?
1300000	1305000	I'm actually going to say Chrono Trigger and keep that as my favorite classics.
1305000	1314000	But for my modern favorites, Mass Effect goes on the top of the list and specifically Dragon Age Inquisition would be right under the Mass Effect series.
1314000	1315000	Okay.
1315000	1317000	I played so much of that shit. It was great.
1317000	1318000	All right.
1318000	1319000	I got to hear from Loki.
1319000	1324000	Loki, your reflections on Zelda's birthday as it turns 35.
1324000	1328000	Well, Zelda was one of the first games I had for the NES.
1328000	1332000	So that was kind of how the NES was presented to me.
1332000	1339000	When like we... I remember we had played, you know, different games at friends houses and stuff like that.
1339000	1344000	But like when my parents surprised me with the NES, they had Zelda booted up on it.
1344000	1347000	And so that was kind of like my first game anyways.
1347000	1352000	So yeah, it definitely does have a special place in my heart, you know, for it.
1353000	1354000	And I played a ton of it.
1354000	1355000	So.
1356000	1357000	Yeah.
1357000	1366000	And in all of the others, all this except several of the 3D ones, really the only thing 3D that played was probably Wind Waker.
1366000	1372000	I didn't really play... I guess the 3DS stuff is sort of 3D, I guess.
1372000	1374000	So I did those as well.
1374000	1379000	And also the DS stuff, but not really any like Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask,
1380000	1382000	Skyward Sword did not play that.
1382000	1385000	Haven't really even played much of Breath of the Wild.
1385000	1387000	So I don't know.
1387000	1389000	It was just hard getting into those.
1390000	1396000	Are we surprised, you know, obviously we're going to kind of roll into the Nintendo Direct Talk here in a moment,
1396000	1398000	which is, you know, another big headline from the week.
1398000	1405000	But are we kind of surprised that Nintendo didn't try to do like a classics type of thing for...
1405000	1412000	I mean, to be fair, well, to be fair, let's make sure we state if you have the Switch online,
1412000	1419000	you already do have the original Legend of Zelda, Zelda 2, the Adventures of Link and Dark Soccer's favorite game,
1419000	1425000	A Link to the Past are all available in those two libraries.
1425000	1429000	So they didn't have any need to repackage those games because they're already there on the Switch.
1429000	1434000	But are we surprised they didn't try to do, you know, Ocarina of Time, you know, or some of the other,
1434000	1438000	you know, maybe like Ocarina of Time slash Majora's Mask kind of combo thing,
1438000	1442000	even though, you know, it's not just for Jamie that Majora's Mask is a little bit controversial,
1442000	1444000	but some people love it, some people don't like it.
1444000	1447000	I'm kind of in the middle with it.
1447000	1449000	I honestly don't think I really spent enough time with it.
1449000	1453000	And I think a collection like that would have really kind of given me a chance to revisit that again.
1453000	1456000	Are we kind of surprised Nintendo didn't go that direction?
1456000	1459000	I still think that they have time to do that.
1459000	1462000	We only know some of the announcements so far this year.
1462000	1470000	I don't think that it's out of the realm of possibility for them to do some sort of collection outside of Skyward Sword.
1470000	1476000	I think that it's been rumored for a while that they're going to do something like that with Ocarina of Time
1476000	1479000	and maybe even throw some of the other Wii games on there.
1479000	1484000	You know, there could be Twilight Princess or, you know, they could do Majora's Mask.
1484000	1490000	I mean, they've remastered both of those sort of for 3DS.
1490000	1493000	And I mean, emulating the Wii is pretty easy.
1493000	1499000	I don't know if they want to necessarily dive into the Wii too much because, you know, with motion controls and everything,
1499000	1503000	they do have to kind of work around that a little bit.
1503000	1509000	That's one of the greatest things about this Skyward Sword thing and why I'm kind of interested in it is that it gets rid of that.
1509000	1511000	I mean, well, I should say get rid of it.
1511000	1518000	You can actually play a refined version of it, if you will, with the more refined controllers on the Switch.
1518000	1521000	But and for a lot of people, this is huge. I already saw it in chat once.
1521000	1527000	I know for me the fact you can just use the buttons and just play it like, you know, other Zelda and just play it with a controller.
1527000	1534000	That's great for me. So it makes it a huge thing I would like to check out.
1534000	1537000	But I think, though, there's still an opportunity to do more stuff like that.
1537000	1543000	I mean, if you remember for Mario's 35th anniversary, they did a bunch of stuff and they've announced things.
1543000	1547000	And I don't know if they announced it all at once. Maybe they did, but I think they did.
1547000	1551000	There's still time in the year to do that. I mean, true.
1551000	1562000	You know, there's stuff that's going to be coming out around June when they have all the summer announcements for around E3, which is not really a thing anymore.
1562000	1568000	But I don't know, I could totally see them doing another collection of some sort.
1568000	1570000	Just they have plenty of games to work from.
1570000	1575000	I'm surprised that we haven't seen some of the DS games come back like as a collection of those.
1575000	1580000	But I know that it's kind of hard to kind of do that maybe with the Switch, but...
1580000	1586000	I don't think so. I mean, we've seen how many shooter games that have come out on the Switch now that have a vertical mode.
1586000	1595000	So you could just play with your Switch vertical and you use the little, you know, you can mount it up and then, you know, just take one of the controllers off and you play with that.
1595000	1599000	The pinball games do this too. You can play a vertical mode.
1599000	1604000	And I think a DS thing would work fine in vertical mode, but for whatever reason they don't want to do it.
1604000	1608000	Maybe because they don't like the idea of being separated from the TV like that.
1608000	1612000	Although, why not just have a DS image on your TV?
1612000	1617000	You just, sure, you lose a lot of real estate on the sides, but I bet people would still play it.
1617000	1618000	I don't know.
1618000	1624000	Yeah, I mean, it's touchscreen functionality, I think is probably why they didn't.
1624000	1632000	But there's some of those things, I think, with even like, Zelda and stuff, the control scheme, they could probably adapt it to work because they had it using touchscreen.
1632000	1642000	And it worked great for that, but they could probably adapt it with traditional controls, or they can go the lazy route and just put the Nintendo 64 versions out.
1642000	1643000	Yeah, that's what I would expect.
1643000	1645000	And put Wind Waker in there or something like that.
1645000	1649000	I mean, they've already remastered Wind Waker once, just ported over.
1649000	1654000	I mean, there's easy ways out to do all that stuff.
1654000	1659000	Yeah. Well, let's talk a little more about that Nintendo Direct and some of the things that were talked about.
1659000	1670000	Obviously, as we've mentioned quite extensively already, we know one of the big, big headlines out of that was that they're going to be making a Skyward Sword kind of redo on the Nintendo Switch.
1670000	1676000	And Bobby's actually correcting kind of what I said earlier, saying it's not really button controls because you still have to identify the direction of your slashes.
1676000	1683000	So you use the right stick to swing instead of hitting A. But that's, it's still, you know, I don't have to jump around.
1683000	1689000	I can, if I want to lay back on my couch and be like that, you know, and just have the, you know, I can still kind of play that way.
1689000	1692000	I don't actually have to get up and move around and all that stuff.
1692000	1696000	So I do like that. But sure, I get what you're saying. It's not really a button.
1696000	1700000	But OK, it's a flick of the thumb either way.
1700000	1701000	Yeah.
1701000	1707000	But anyway, what were some of the, obviously I have some opinions on the direct as a whole, and I'm sure you guys do too.
1707000	1714000	And I mean, chat as well with that. But why don't we go through some of the headlines just to kind of refresh our memory with what all they showed us.
1714000	1716000	Loki, I know you had something cued up for that.
1716000	1728000	Sure. Yes. So, I mean, some of the big stuff, obviously, we just talked about Skyward Sword, which is getting an HD port on the Switch coming out July 16th.
1728000	1735000	They made the announcement of Splatoon 3, which is really big, kind of a tease, but still not coming out until next year.
1735000	1742000	It was also one of those things where it was like, we've been talking about this for how long and how did we not see this coming today?
1742000	1747000	You know, like when they played the Splatoon 3 trailer, my mind kind of went, oh, of course.
1747000	1750000	Oh, of course. That was kind of like where, oh, of course.
1750000	1752000	Of course they're going to do something here.
1752000	1761000	They showed off because we had gotten a tease. This was during the Mario 35th anniversary stream that they did, like back in September, I think, or maybe even before that.
1761000	1764000	Talking about like the Animal Crossing stuff that was coming out.
1764000	1769000	So that's going to be coming out March 1st with a free update and they kind of showed off some of the items.
1769000	1774000	One of the cool, unique things in there is you can actually get warp pipe to be able to move around your island, which is awesome.
1774000	1782000	And I think a lot of the stuff that they have, especially like with the Thwomps and the coins and stuff like that, pretty cool to see it all very interactive.
1782000	1793000	Somebody pointed out on social media that those warp pipes are some of the first items that expand, that actually give additional functionality to the island.
1793000	1802000	I don't know, Dark Soccer is the expert when it comes to Animal Crossing, but just real quick, picking your brain on what you thought of the warp pipe announcement, because that's more than just a decoration.
1802000	1809000	It's going to go in my town. I'm putting one by my house and one in front of my shops.
1809000	1817000	Honestly, I wish the island could be bigger now, like so we could decorate and you could have like a whole like second island that you have to use a warp pipe to get.
1817000	1821000	I guess that's asking a lot. It's asking a lot, but no, it's nice.
1821000	1824000	Make it happen. Come on.
1824000	1832000	You could even not that I want to give you ideas, but you could charge a fee for it. I mean, yeah, I don't know.
1832000	1834000	Yeah.
1834000	1839000	Anyways, so we got our next big Mario announcement. Mario Golf.
1839000	1845000	Sorry, just some quick other comments from chat. Vio by Kurt. Hey, Kurt says AC Mario announcement was awesome.
1845000	1852000	And yeah, I got to say, there's so much that it looks like they're adding. You can really transform the look of your island a lot with that.
1852000	1855000	And I thought that was pretty cool. So there is that.
1855000	1859000	Sjoan Hunter Matt says second island, also known as Item Hoarder Island.
1859000	1868000	Yeah, that's what it would turn out for me. Kurt with another suggestion saying if the warp pipe could be connected to a best friend's island, that would be amazing.
1868000	1873000	Oh, I like that. That's an interesting thought. Anyway, sorry, Loki.
1873000	1877000	Other other announcements. You're talking about the golf, right?
1877000	1885000	Yeah. So they have Mario Golf Super Rush, which is a brand new golf game coming out June 25th.
1885000	1893000	And they're going to have some sort of story mode along with that with your Miis as well. So that's it's neat, I guess.
1893000	1896000	Not Mario Kart 9, but we'll deal.
1896000	1901000	I did. I did sense the kind of meh coming from Twitter on that one.
1901000	1908000	But I feel I feel like these arcade type golf games have an audience. They always seem to sell.
1908000	1913000	It's like in hot shots, golf on PlayStation has always been a big one.
1913000	1918000	And I got to say, like for for what it is, it does look neat.
1918000	1922000	I'm not sure if it's something up my alley where I want to spend 60 bucks on it.
1922000	1928000	But I was like, you know, I know there is an audience for these games and it does look like, you know,
1928000	1932000	Nintendo always puts these unique spins on kind of the golf formula.
1932000	1936000	And I always think of like the Kirby miniature golf.
1936000	1939000	I don't think that was the name of the Kirby Superstar course.
1939000	1944000	Yeah, Air Force that, you know, that was basically a golf game. It was a very unique kind of spin on it.
1944000	1952000	So, I mean, I expect the game is going to be very interesting and, you know, for that audience will be worth money.
1952000	1955000	But I'm just not sure for me specifically.
1955000	1960000	It'll be interesting there. The announced fall guys is coming to the switch.
1960000	1970000	Finally, this summer, we got our new character for Smash Brothers announced, which is Pyre from Xenoblade Chronicles two.
1970000	1975000	And then she also transforms into some other character as well.
1975000	1979000	So she's coming in March.
1979000	1984000	Then lots of like really old games being announced and brought over.
1984000	1990000	So we have Tales from the Borderlands coming, Stubbs the Zombie.
1990000	1996000	We've got also the Ninja Gaiden collection, Star Wars Hunters.
1996000	1999000	Well, actually, that's a newer game now, but it's based.
1999000	2003000	It's a game developed by Zynga.
2003000	2005000	So take that as you will.
2005000	2009000	You know what? You know, Zynga made that high heels game I was talking about last week.
2009000	2013000	So that's what you can. Where's my Switch port of high heels?
2013000	2018000	And I should be able to play it in vertical mode so my heels can get extra high. Just saying.
2018000	2027000	There's a new game called World Ends Club. World Ends Club is a detective story by the makers of Danganronpa that's coming out May 28th.
2027000	2033000	We also had a game that looked like it was Octopath Traveler, but it's not.
2033000	2040000	It's Project Triangle Strategy. I would imagine it's them using that engine for a very different kind of game.
2040000	2044000	Yeah, it's like a tactics game. So that's kind of cool.
2044000	2047000	And they had a demo that came out already for that.
2047000	2052000	They showed off that they're going to be doing a Miitopia game for the Switch.
2052000	2057000	So bringing that over from the 3DS. Where the hell did that come from? Who asked for that?
2057000	2061000	I mean, I'm not I'm not dogging on it because I know that game has its fans.
2061000	2064000	I have friends that were very lit up when they saw the announcement.
2064000	2070000	It was definitely a, of all the games I expected them to bring back, that was not the one I thought.
2070000	2074000	But I guess that's what makes the announcements kind of fun, I guess.
2074000	2082000	They have announced there was that Capcom Arcade Collection that was coming out. Arcade Stadium.
2082000	2084000	And tons of games included.
2084000	2088000	This was my favorite headline out of the whole thing and I bought it.
2088000	2094000	And I had $40 to get all of the games, but it's I think it's like 31 games.
2094000	2096000	They have a ton of games in there too.
2096000	2102000	They really do. And I will say for Dark Sakura, because I'm going to say the magic word that always gets her attention.
2102000	2107000	Strider is in the collection and it's the arcade version of Strider.
2107000	2110000	And I have to say, I don't remember the last time I played the arcade version of Strider.
2110000	2117000	It's been a long time, like since I was like fucking around with Mame a long time ago on a computer that wasn't good enough to run Strider.
2117000	2121000	So to be able to play that again has been neat. I'll talk a little more about it in my gaming week.
2121000	2126000	But the Capcom Stadium thing was like my favorite thing they announced because I love my retro stuff.
2126000	2128000	And we have CyberBots.
2128000	2132000	Don't you know CyberBots is Capcom's number one game?
2132000	2134000	It's a quote.
2134000	2148000	There's a real interesting mix of like like very mainstream stuff like Super Street Fighter 2, Street Fighter 2 Turbo, 1943, Ghosts and Goblins.
2148000	2154000	You know, there's a mix of that and then like really deep cut stuff in that collection.
2154000	2158000	So I thought it was neat.
2158000	2160000	Yeah, so lots of cool stuff in there.
2160000	2164000	So that was pretty exciting. I wish we'd seen more of that kind of stuff.
2164000	2167000	More release dates announced.
2167000	2170000	So No More Heroes 3 is coming August 27th.
2170000	2175000	There's a game called Knockout City that's by EA.
2175000	2179000	It's like a dodgeball battle royale game that's coming out May 21st.
2179000	2181000	What else?
2181000	2187000	We've got a shooter that's called Neon White that's going to be coming out.
2187000	2189000	It looked kind of cool.
2189000	2195000	And they showed off The Legend of Mana is getting a Switch port as well.
2195000	2197000	And so that's coming out June 4th.
2197000	2200000	I've got something to say. I got something to say.
2200000	2204000	And this is going to get me in trouble, but I'm going to say it because it's my opinion.
2204000	2206000	That's my opinion.
2206000	2213000	The Legend of Mana is probably easily in the top three most disappointing games I've ever played in my life.
2213000	2216000	And I know that is not going to be a popular opinion.
2216000	2226000	But coming off of playing games like Secret of Mana, Secret of Evermore, and then buying that on the PlayStation, I was so disappointed.
2226000	2233000	And one of the only Square Enix games to me that's more disappointing than Legend of Mana is Saga Frontier.
2233000	2237000	So honestly, I am not feeling the Square remasters right now.
2237000	2239000	This is not an era for me.
2239000	2241000	And that's okay. It doesn't have to be for me.
2241000	2243000	I know a lot of people that are very excited about that.
2243000	2249000	And I will say, I'm not even looking at chat because I'm sure they're screaming at me, but I will say this.
2249000	2255000	Maybe it is a second chance to try the game again and see if maybe something just didn't click the first time.
2255000	2259000	You know, because sometimes that's the sort of thing that happens, but I don't know.
2259000	2261000	I was not feeling the Legend of Mana announcement.
2261000	2264000	All right, I'm looking now to see what's going on.
2264000	2270000	We had also announced, was it two Famicom Detective Club stories that are getting localized?
2270000	2272000	I've never heard of that series.
2272000	2274000	I have. They're supposed to be pretty cute.
2276000	2281000	I mean, we can get that game localized, but no Earthbound 3, no Mother 3 or whatever.
2283000	2286000	Nintendo and their priorities. Let's put out another game.
2286000	2293000	Or hey, I know, let's put out a trailer for DC Super Heroes or Super Hero Girls Teen Power.
2293000	2297000	But that has, it has an audience. The audience isn't me.
2297000	2301000	But I was kind of like, oh, this is cool that this exists.
2301000	2303000	That was pretty much my reaction to that trailer.
2303000	2307000	I'm happy this exists, even though I'm not going to be buying it for me.
2307000	2310000	But I bet other people will be very thrilled with that.
2310000	2317000	I wanted to mention this because I thought it was a good comment from Bobby in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork says,
2317000	2324000	I think honestly, this is because it's easier to coordinate development of a remaster over Zoom than a new game right now.
2324000	2328000	We've now been out of offices for 11 months. This keeps developers employed.
2328000	2332000	True, although there's one game they still can't seem to remaster.
2333000	2337000	Give you a hint. Logie just mentioned it, Mother 3. Anyway.
2339000	2342000	Yeah. All right. Anything else to mention?
2343000	2349000	No, that was it. I mean, they had they showed off Samurai Warriors 5, which it's Samurai Warriors 5.
2349000	2355000	And also along those lines, apparently Hyrule Warriors, Age of Calamity is getting some DLC.
2355000	2358000	They didn't say what it was. They just briefly flashed up.
2358000	2362000	Hey, you can buy this. Don't know what it is, but.
2363000	2367000	And Nintendo's DLC is really good usually, so I'm not mad about it.
2367000	2371000	But it's not a Nintendo game. It's a Tecmo Koei game.
2371000	2377000	Yeah, but it's holding a Nintendo name, so it's it's they're still going to have to put a substantial amount into it, I think.
2377000	2382000	We'll see. So how did we feel about the direct overall?
2383000	2388000	So, OK, I'll start. So I I was OK with it.
2388000	2395000	Like I was kind of ambivalent, which kind of surprised me because it's been so long since we've had a Nintendo direct.
2395000	2404000	But I think I was kind of like, OK, like, you know, I knew we weren't going to get like Metroid Prime 4 game footage or anything like that.
2404000	2407000	But I think maybe I was a little bit surprised.
2407000	2417000	And I think this is generally like where Nintendo is at for, I think, a lot of people and why maybe there's like negative reaction there, because there's definitely people that are like, man, that sucked.
2417000	2421000	That was a horrible direct. I can't believe they didn't show like anything I was looking for.
2421000	2426000	And there's another crowd that was like, that was a great presentation. There was something for everybody.
2426000	2432000	And, you know, obviously the two sides are kind of going at each other. And I really kind of feel like I'm somewhere in the middle.
2432000	2439000	But I think I understand why folks are upset, you know, at what Nintendo kind of doesn't show.
2439000	2441000	And let me try to kind of put that into words.
2441000	2450000	So I think a lot of people enjoy Nintendo products and the Nintendo system because Nintendo is probably the best game maker in the biz.
2450000	2454000	So people buy Nintendo products to play Nintendo games.
2454000	2463000	And that particular direct, you had a handful of Nintendo games. You had the Mario Golf, which kind of has a limited audience.
2463000	2465000	Right. And the golfing thing isn't for everybody.
2465000	2468000	Again, some people are going to be super into it and excited about it. Cool.
2468000	2471000	But there are going to be people to go, meh. OK.
2471000	2479000	Then we have the Zelda Skyward Sword, kind of a controversial entry in the Zelda series, getting the remaster.
2479000	2485000	So there's that. And some people are saying, eh, paying 60 bucks for a game I just played and didn't enjoy that much.
2485000	2489000	I don't know. But then again, there's another crowd that, you know, loves that game and so forth.
2489000	2496000	And then I think what what really kind of salted people was the Splatoon 3 announcement.
2496000	2499000	And it's not the fact that Splatoon 3 is coming again.
2499000	2502000	I think that was actually probably like the least surprising thing they could have said.
2502000	2507000	And I know that I enjoy. Of course, I'll buy Splatoon 3. I enjoy that series.
2507000	2514000	I'm not saying it's a negative for me. What the negative is, was the 2022 date at the end of it.
2514000	2520000	Even though. OK, wait. So this was supposed to be a direct that was going to focus on stuff that's kind of like this year.
2520000	2523000	But they're giving us this game that's this far out.
2523000	2529000	Well, if they're going to be showing us this, like what what about these other Nintendo things?
2529000	2533000	What exactly does Nintendo have coming out in 2021?
2533000	2537000	OK, they've got a golf game and a Zelda remake.
2537000	2542000	And I think people are starting to feel like, is is the well dry at Nintendo?
2542000	2547000	Has the pandemic really affected them like that badly or what's like going on?
2547000	2552000	And so Nintendo's really had to rely on third parties and especially Square Enix.
2552000	2556000	If you look at this direct, like, holy crap, was Square Enix a big part of that job?
2556000	2560000	But like when we're talking about third parties, like or even second parties, I don't know.
2560000	2568000	Like, what's Retro Studios working on? I mean, like, weren't they supposed to have some big thing coming or like.
2568000	2572000	What are they doing with Nintendo online? Like.
2572000	2577000	Are we going to get any more systems on that? Are they going to release any more games on that?
2577000	2581000	I mean, there's been like hardly anything coming to that.
2581000	2585000	And both of those things you just named because Retro is basically Nintendo Studio at this point.
2585000	2589000	Both those things you just named are, again, Nintendo based updates.
2589000	2597000	And I think that's why this direct left some people a little bit cold is that you got some kind of like take them or leave them for many people.
2597000	2604000	Nintendo updates, a game announcement for 2022 that anyone could have seen coming.
2604000	2607000	And that's what Nintendo's got for this year.
2607000	2610000	And now I imagine there's going to be more in June.
2610000	2617000	And I'm not again, I'm not trying to sound overly negative on Nintendo, but there is a difference between shitting on Nintendo,
2617000	2624000	which is what I'm not trying to do, and being critical about some of, you know, what they with the cards they choose to and not show.
2624000	2627000	And I am going to continue to be critical of this because it bugs me.
2627000	2635000	And I know it bugs a lot of you, too, is that Nintendo continues to really sleep on a lot of their back catalog.
2635000	2644000	Like there's so many people that want to see Nintendo 64, like especially you got a new Pokemon Snap game, which I'm surprised that was missing completely from the presentation.
2644000	2648000	Although there is a big Pokemon thing going on this next week with the 25th.
2648000	2655000	So I think all those people that set themselves up for Pokemon Generation 4, I think we're always the remakes and all that.
2655000	2663000	I think we're always going to be wrong because those Pokemon games almost always have their own announcements and their own thing from the Pokemon company.
2663000	2666000	So and that'll all come next week, whatever they're doing there.
2666000	2671000	But Pokemon Snap is still a thing Nintendo's been hyping, and I'm really surprised they haven't taken the opportunity to say,
2671000	2679000	and you can check out the original, you know, whether it's 10 bucks or, you know, whether it's through a new Nintendo 64 player or something like that.
2679000	2683000	I don't know, you know, and obviously no one ever shuts up about Mother 3.
2683000	2686000	And spoiler alert, they're not going to until it actually releases.
2686000	2690000	And even when it does, it probably still won't be good enough for some people.
2690000	2697000	But, you know, even just the fact that Earthbound is still missing from the Super Nintendo Collection,
2697000	2704000	the fact that the Wii U got that Earthbound Zero, which is still missing from the NES Collection is...
2704000	2712000	My point is, is that there's a lot of Nintendo's library and stuff that fans really want to see Nintendo kind of push more,
2712000	2714000	and it's not happening for whatever reason.
2714000	2719000	One remake of a controversial Zelda game isn't doing it for people.
2719000	2724000	And I think that's what's leaving some people in a weird spot when it comes to Nintendo.
2724000	2728000	So I think how you felt about the Direct really boiled down to, how do you feel about Golf?
2728000	2732000	How do you feel about Skyward Sword? How do you feel about the third-party releases?
2732000	2736000	I wasn't really excited about most of the Direct, honestly.
2736000	2740000	Like, I thought that the Animal Crossing stuff was neat, but I don't really play Animal Crossing.
2740000	2744000	My kids do, and my wife does, so I was just like, eh.
2744000	2751000	I was just surprised, like, I get it, Ninja Gaiden is a great series, but that's an old game.
2751000	2754000	That's a really old game that they're porting.
2754000	2758000	Like, if it was a new Ninja Gaiden game, cool, I'd be all down for that.
2758000	2761000	But like, it's an old game.
2761000	2764000	Like, they're porting some old shit to this system.
2764000	2767000	Like, Stubbs a Zombie? Who asked for that?
2767000	2774000	I get that, yes, they need to give a little time to Ninja Gaiden and stuff.
2774000	2777000	I start to wonder if they maybe give too much time to these releases.
2777000	2780000	But here's the why behind that.
2780000	2790000	The Wii U really tripped and fell out the gate because all of the third-party releases that came out for the Wii U were old games.
2790000	2794000	They were a year or two old at that point by the time they were hitting the Wii U.
2794000	2804000	And that's why the third-party stuff really tripped and fell out the gate and it just caused this Wii U to have a sour launch that it never got away from.
2804000	2815000	Now, the Switch has been in a much stronger position, but I feel like for some people it's almost a little bit like when they see the Tales from the Borderlands and the Ninja Gaiden and they see all that stuff.
2815000	2824000	It's not that those are bad games, but they see Nintendo slipping back into this old habit that years old games finally coming to the Switch are some big deal.
2824000	2831000	When it's not. I guess it depends on the game, but unless it's bringing something really new to the table, it's really not.
2831000	2838000	And it's not even necessarily Nintendo's fault for any of that stuff, it's just what third-parties are deciding to release on the system.
2838000	2853000	I guess porting over old stuff is just what they want to do. I don't know. I wish we'd get more from these properties other than just ports of old stuff.
2853000	2865000	Don't get me wrong, some of these games are pretty good, but Ninja Gaiden came out on the Xbox and then the Xbox 360.
2865000	2873000	And now we're porting that stuff over to the Switch? Who was like, oh my god, I need the... I don't know. I really don't see the point.
2873000	2881000	I'm pretty sure. Isn't that one of the... Maybe it's one of the free titles with Games Pass right now.
2881000	2891000	That stuff was always synonymous with Xbox at one point, but I don't know. Why waste a direct with that kind of stuff?
2892000	2897000	Let me get some comments over chat, and then I want to check in with Dark Soccer and see if she has any thoughts about the direct.
2897000	2905000	Then some comments from chat, sj100matt says, I think you have to couple this with the disappointment that some folks felt about a Switch Pro not happening anytime soon.
2905000	2910000	Nintendo got a hit with Animal Crossing last year. Folks have been wanting more out of the Switch.
2910000	2917000	And then MobyBlackWolf says, I think the companies want to make new games, but they want to wait for the pandemic to be over so they can collaborate in person.
2917000	2928000	And again, I will give everybody involved in these things a little bit of slack because the pandemic has really just changed the world and the way we work and all of this stuff.
2928000	2937000	So I understand things are just... But maybe in that sense, it feels a little weird to have brought out an official direct now, as opposed to these minis they've been doing.
2938000	2947000	But I could see... Hold on, I'm not done. I could see where Nintendo is in a position where it's like, we're damned if we do, we're damned if we don't, when it comes to the direct.
2947000	2953000	And I get that, and so I'm not going to fault them for it. And I'll make my last point, and then I'll get your follow-up, Loki, and then I'll go to Dark Soccer.
2954000	2967000	Is that... Now I forgot my last point because I was trying to set all that up. With Nintendo... Dang it. Well, my train derailed. Go ahead, Loki. What was your thought?
2967000	2976000	I was going to say, there's better games that they could be porting if they're looking to do ports of stuff. Like, I don't know, bring over some of the NES remix stuff. That was pretty cool.
2977000	2992000	There's... I don't know, they could port over a bunch of older NES titles or something and put it in a collection or something. I don't know, there's better stuff to port over. I don't really know what to say.
2992000	3011000	I mean, we've been getting, like, really old stuff. And it's not necessarily just a Nintendo problem. It's a lot of just developers out there, like, even, like, EA publishing some, like, bringing back Burnout Paradise again. Like, okay, that's a super old game. I mean, it's a fun game, but it's just, it's super old. All it does is make me want a brand new game.
3012000	3022000	That being said, though, I'd totally take a collection of old Ridge Racer games, Namco, if, you know, you're up to it. But that's something we haven't gotten forever. Geez, a new Ridge Racer game.
3022000	3035000	My final thought was, even if the Direct hadn't been, or even if the Direct had been that bad or a bad Direct, which I don't think it was, I think it was just kind of, like, average, it doesn't tarnish that the Switch is still a great system.
3035000	3053000	Because there are so many great games that are on the Switch, you know, and the fact that 2021 is clearly going to be a little bit of a slower year for the Switch, probably because of the pandemic, doesn't take away from the fact that the Switch is the only place you're gonna be able to play Animal Crossing, Breath of the Wild, you know, and a lot of the games that are very strong in Nintendo's library.
3053000	3070000	So I think that's something to keep in mind, too, is that while maybe this Direct didn't, you know, maybe didn't like get people screaming about the future and so forth, I don't think it necessarily tarnishes the Switch as a system and something that people should consider adding to their library if they somehow don't already have one.
3070000	3078000	Anyway, Dark Soccer, I'm sorry to make you wait, but I want to ask you, you know, do you play Switch, obviously, Animal Crossing a lot? What were your thoughts about the Direct?
3079000	3094000	I'm happy about the Animal Crossing stuff. I mean, that's really the thing I cared the most about. There's definitely a few games on there. Like, I'm really curious to see what Neon White is like. I like the art style of it.
3094000	3123000	I, of course, Capcom Arcade Stadium. I know that there's going to be a lot of play from, you know, that in my house. I did want to play Legend of Mana because I didn't before. So, I mean, I'm looking forward to it. I mean, I'll put it this way. I had, yeah, I think it was Legend of Mana that I had on PS1, but I had an import of it.
3125000	3136000	So, it was very text heavy and I couldn't read very well at the time in Japanese. So, it'd be nice to actually see what it was they were there talking about.
3136000	3143000	There's just really not, though, a lot other than the few things here and there that I'm really overly excited about.
3144000	3154000	I mean, World's End Club is definitely something I'm interested in because, I mean, it's Spike Chunsoft, isn't it?
3154000	3155000	I think so, yeah.
3155000	3168000	Yeah. I love a lot of the games that they've put out. I really love Danganronpa. Hopefully, it might be kind of similar, at least stylistically or in the feel of it. So, I would enjoy playing that.
3169000	3186000	And, I mean, we were interested in playing Skyward Sword. So, that's happy news. I'm really disappointed, though, that some of the other games were overlooked for either remakes or upscaled versions.
3186000	3193000	All right. Well, we could probably spend a whole three hours talking about Nintendo Directs. I'm sure there's going to be many YouTubes of that length that are doing that.
3193000	3202000	However, we still have some other headlines to cover. I want to talk about the other company that spent an hour talking about their upcoming releases, and I want to talk a little bit about BlizzConline.
3202000	3211000	Now, BlizzCon usually happens in, what, like October, maybe November? Obviously, it didn't happen in 2020. We all know the reason.
3211000	3221000	But they weren't able to kind of pivot to an online forum fast enough, so they kind of did the online announcements thing now in February.
3221000	3234000	So, we kind of got like October's BlizzCon this past weekend, and there were quite a few things announced. I'll have Loki in a minute give the rundown, but Dark Soccer, I know one thing in particular caught your eye when it came to BlizzCon.
3234000	3248000	Yeah, I mean, I was a big fan of The Lost Vikings, and I even remember playing World of Warcraft and being really excited to find them in one of the instances.
3248000	3256000	So, that's really fun to me. Dan is super excited about rock and roll racing. He loves that game so much.
3256000	3264000	And all of that, of course, is in the Blizzard Arcade Collection, which is going to put together those classics that just came out.
3264000	3275000	But the other thing I think is cool, which might actually get me a little bit into the WoW classic, is Burning Crusade, because that's when they started fixing how fucking terrible the game playing was.
3275000	3290000	It would be kind of nice to experience some of those things for the first time, because I didn't play that long. Then again, knowing me, I'd probably go, oh yeah, this is why I didn't like it and not play.
3290000	3299000	I'm completely uninterested in Shadowlands. Completely uninterested, because they fucked up Sylvanas.
3299000	3303000	Yeah, the story is very controversial in that regard, yeah.
3304000	3311000	They fucked up one of my favorite characters, so I'm done. I'll be honest, they haven't had a good storyline since Legion.
3312000	3316000	And that was the last one I enjoyed playing. So, no.
3316000	3323000	Back on the classic though, Burning Crusade was really the first one. I did have an account during Vanilla, and I think I played for a couple months.
3323000	3327000	But I didn't really get sucked in until Burning Crusade. That was the one.
3327000	3329000	Remember the computer you gave me?
3329000	3331000	Yeah, we were raiding during Burning Crusade.
3331000	3333000	It was installed on that computer, and it still ran.
3333000	3341000	Yeah, yeah. That's right. I had it on that little left that's right, because Blizzard's been supporting Macs for the longest time.
3341000	3342000	Macbook G4.
3342000	3349000	Yeah, WoW was on that, yeah. I think I played Wrath of the Lich King on that. I don't think it had a great framerate, but it was there.
3349000	3359000	But anyway, I do love that that's coming to WoW Classic, and I think it's very interesting too, because there are probably going to be some people that are like, no, I want WoW Classic.
3359000	3365000	I don't ever want to go to Burning Crusade. But they're going to give people the option. You can either keep your character on a Vanilla server.
3365000	3372000	No, I think you can keep it on the server it's on, and that server is going to progress into Burning Crusade.
3372000	3378000	Or you can transfer it to a Vanilla Forever server. So it is interesting they're giving people the choice.
3378000	3388000	And I wonder, I was just gonna say, I wonder if there won't be a Wrath of the Lich King, because that was really when WoW peaked for a lot of people.
3388000	3396000	I wonder if that won't be a thing in another year or two, that they'll put the classic servers to that and then that's kind of where they will stop.
3396000	3397000	Probably.
3397000	3398000	Yeah. Anyway, sorry, Jamie?
3399000	3413000	No, I honestly enough, I wish that there was something like if you have an active subscription to like just the main game, that you had the full access to all of those varieties of servers.
3413000	3414000	You do.
3414000	3423000	If you do, if you subscribe to main WoW, Classic is included with that. And there is no separate classic. It's just a WoW sub and WoW gets you access.
3423000	3424000	You just pick the server then.
3424000	3425000	Yeah.
3425000	3428000	I thought that it was like a separate install or something.
3428000	3438000	It is a separate install, but you don't have to pay a separate fee. As far as the money is concerned, the money is, it's a WoW sub and it's a little drop down in the Battle.net client.
3438000	3446000	Kind of like when you're switching to Public Test Realm, you can use a drop down to play WoW Classic as opposed to WoW Current.
3446000	3452000	Gotcha. Well, neither of them are worth it for me unless I can just play, you know, Cataclysm again and then I can play Legion again.
3452000	3455000	And it'll be happy because those were the two good ones.
3455000	3460000	So it'll be interesting to see if they do some servers frozen in time for all those expansions. We'll see.
3460000	3466000	OK, so Blizzard Arcade, Burning Crusade, Loki, what else came out of BlizzCon?
3466000	3475000	All right. So they also had talked about that they're remaking Diablo 2, which had been like kind of rumored for the longest time now.
3475000	3480000	So better, you know, fully 3D graphics now.
3480000	3485000	They're going to have cross progression against both PC and console.
3485000	3493000	And they're also doing a remaster of the original game, the expansion Lord of Destruction as well.
3493000	3498000	And all cinematics will be recreated and updated shot for shot.
3498000	3505000	Hopefully that's that's actually being done in like Warcraft 3 where they said they were going to do that and didn't.
3505000	3511000	Yeah, I'm super excited about this, by the way. I'm really excited to jump back into the world of Diablo 2.
3511000	3517000	I think it's interesting that it's PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and not the last generation.
3517000	3521000	They're making it for the newer consoles. I find that interesting.
3521000	3525000	Well, it still may be compatible with the other systems.
3525000	3528000	I also kind of wonder what cross progression really means.
3528000	3534000	Like, OK, if I make a character on PC, then I guess I can use that character on console.
3534000	3541000	But can I play with my friends, like in real time, or is that still going to be separated like it is in Diablo 3?
3541000	3544000	Yeah. So there's still some questions I have with that.
3544000	3550000	Even the cross progression is interesting, although does that mean I have to buy the game three times if I want to play on all my systems?
3550000	3553000	You know, little things like that, I'd still kind of like to know.
3553000	3562000	But in general, I will buy the Diablo 2 remaster at least once, because that was a great game and I'm excited to see what they do with it.
3562000	3572000	And then along the lines of Diablo, they talked about Diablo 4 as well, showed off the rogue class, so that's something.
3572000	3577000	And then there was some gameplay with that, too, and it looks really hot. I'm into it.
3577000	3582000	Yeah. And then talked about, was it Shadowlands Chains of Dominion?
3582000	3588000	And what else? We talked about the Burning Crusade expansion for WoW Classic.
3588000	3592000	Hearthstone's getting a new expansion called Forged in the Barrens.
3592000	3598000	The Blizzard Arcade Collection, which is pretty awesome.
3598000	3603000	And Lost Vikings, Rock and Roll Racing and Blackthorn.
3603000	3607000	I've only played two of those. I haven't played Blackthorn.
3607000	3614000	Yeah. And then, was there anything about Overwatch 2?
3614000	3622000	Okay, so here's what happened with that. In the keynote, their hour-long opening ceremonies, they didn't really mention Overwatch at all.
3622000	3630000	I mean, they name checked the Overwatch League and Overwatch stuff was still in the sizzle reels and all that stuff, but they really kind of left it out.
3630000	3636000	So a lot of Overwatch fans after the keynote were kind of like, the fuck? Like, where's our update?
3636000	3644000	What happened is that then they continued, like BlizzCon wasn't just an hour long, they continued with panels throughout the weekend.
3644000	3652000	And if you went right on over to Overwatch, that channel, and started watching there, which I think is what they carried on the main channel,
3652000	3657000	because probably they knew it would be probably the beefiest thing, they did go into some more detail for Overwatch 2.
3657000	3662000	And they showed off some new maps. They showed off that there's going to be like PvE with talent trees.
3662000	3667000	They showed off that there was going to be, that the characters had aged.
3667000	3672000	So like Soldier 76 and Reinhardt have beards now. What? Or all these other characters have beards.
3672000	3673000	Oh my goodness, so different.
3673000	3676000	Oh my gosh, they're so old. So there's that.
3676000	3684000	But it is a little weird to me that they didn't say any of that in the keynote when they really had everybody's attention.
3684000	3691000	I think that was a real misstep about the keynote, and to kind of, like, well I should let you finish.
3691000	3693000	There weren't any other updates though, right? I think you hit everything.
3693000	3694000	No, that was it.
3694000	3707000	So, the only thing with the thing overall is that, now, you have to remember, usually these presentations are done with a lot of screaming fans in the Anaheim Convention Center.
3707000	3717000	So obviously something always felt a little bit off with that. Although, I don't know, I think they did the best they could as far as that went in the pandemic kind of situation.
3717000	3723000	But I was watching it along here at VOG Network. We were hosting it and I was commenting in chat.
3723000	3730000	And one thing I noticed, it kicked off and they had this nice little company love reel going on thing.
3731000	3743000	Ten minutes into their hour-long presentation, one sixth of the way into their hour-long presentation, they still had not named a single game or product that was new or upcoming or anything.
3743000	3750000	Because that whole ten minutes had been kind of like, yay Blizzard, yay community, yay our fans, we miss you, and all that kind of fluff.
3750000	3754000	I understand why they have to do that. Blizzard does have a great community and all that stuff.
3755000	3768000	But do you think maybe you could have given two of those minutes to just say, we do have some more information coming for Overwatch 2 throughout the weekend, including some new map reveals and what are these talent trees?
3768000	3772000	Stay tuned to the Overwatch panel coming up next for more information.
3772000	3787000	That's all they had to do, I think, to really kind of quench the Overwatch people who really felt like through that whole Metallica concert, looking on Twitter and stuff, the Overwatch fans were pissed.
3787000	3795000	And I understand. I've been there. I've been the Diablo fan that got nothing at a prior BlizzCon and it sucks.
3795000	3801000	But, well hey, at least you're not Starcraft because they really got nothing.
3801000	3808000	But I also thought, and I thought the way it ended was kind of, eh, that's it.
3808000	3816000	He did, Jay Allard did a lot of like talking up of like, and we've got some other things to show you even in some new worlds.
3816000	3819000	We're going to take you to some new places and things you've never been or done.
3819000	3825000	Like almost like they're getting ready to announce a new IP, which would be a great thing for Blizzard right now.
3825000	3830000	And then they didn't, not even a frame, not even a picture, nothing.
3830000	3836000	Now, I understand Blizzard is maybe hopeful that they're going to have a convention this fall.
3836000	3839000	Although, you know, again, I'm not going to try to predict the state of the world.
3839000	3842000	You, you, you, you guess whatever you want.
3842000	3849000	But Blizzard assumes they're going to do some type of announcements again in the fall and maybe they're saving their new IP for that.
3849000	3856000	Okay, but did you have to give us that dirty of a tease there at the end to lead to a big nothing burger?
3856000	3863000	Like again, couldn't you have just used that time instead to say, we have some exciting additions coming to Overwatch 2 as well.
3863000	3870000	Although we're not going to be able to release the game in 2021, we want to update our fans on the latest of what's going on in the Overwatch world.
3870000	3872000	Like how fucking difficult is that?
3872000	3877000	So I, I don't understand their logic and how they plan that out.
3877000	3883000	Because I'll tell you, you know, maybe the Overwatch fans at the end when all was said and done were okay.
3883000	3893000	But there's a lot of people like me who only watch the keynote and then had to kind of like get back to their other stuff that they had going on, like work or whatever.
3893000	3899000	So they missed an opportunity to still not kind of put that stuff in front of me and many people like me.
3899000	3902000	So that's my thought on that.
3903000	3908000	TigerConChat says, so no jaw dropping announcement at this year's BlizzCon?
3908000	3914000	Confirmation of the Diablo 2 remaster I think is probably their big thing.
3914000	3919000	I actually think the Blizzard Arcade and the surprise that's out today.
3919000	3925000	And the fact that it's not just like a port of those games, but they really kind of went in and touched them up.
3925000	3933000	Did some quality of life things, the interviews, the widescreen support, the actual music in rock and roll racing if you want it.
3933000	3935000	Even though don't stream it that way.
3935000	3950000	But like all of that, I thought as far as like what they announced, they had a better year this year than, was it two years ago when they, or was it, no I guess it was 20, was it just 2019?
3950000	3957000	That they announced Diablo Immortal and then they got, they got, they got dragged on that one.
3957000	3959000	Like this was a better BlizzCon than that.
3959000	3963000	And they had some announcements and they had a product that was, it's out now.
3963000	3969000	So there's that. And it's even something Bobby Blackwolf is interested in, the rock and roll racing.
3969000	3977000	So anyway, I actually think when all is said and done, despite the fact I'm nitpicking a little bit when it comes to, you know, what they could have done better.
3977000	3981000	I think it was probably a better keynote than some of the ones they've had in person.
3981000	3987000	How about that, how about that BlizzCon where the big announcement was the Demon Hunter is coming to Diablo.
3987000	3992000	Was that 20, I don't remember when that was, but that was a rough year.
3992000	3995000	Was it 2013? No, it had to be before that.
3995000	3997000	Diablo 3 has been out a while.
3997000	3999000	But yeah, anyway.
3999000	4002000	Alright, so there you go for BlizzCon.
4003000	4010000	We've had a lot of kickoff topics tonight, but there's just, there's just so many things going on in the gaming world that are all fighting for our attention.
4010000	4014000	We do have some more headlines to get into, but I did want to take a minute to do our traditional,
4014000	4018000	How was your gaming week and talk about some of the video games that we have been playing this week.
4018000	4021000	So DarkSakura, why don't we start with you? How was your gaming week?
4021000	4024000	Animal Crossing.
4024000	4028000	Well, I mean, and I borrowed your Ring Fit Adventure. I haven't started it yet.
4028000	4034000	Yesterday I had thrown out my back working on something, so I was like, yeah, maybe I should rest that first.
4034000	4038000	But you are in possession of the Ring Fit Adventure. That did happen this week.
4038000	4039000	I am, yes.
4039000	4040000	I look forward to hearing your thoughts.
4040000	4041000	And you were in possession of cookies.
4041000	4044000	And the cookies were great. Alan and I both enjoyed them.
4044000	4048000	I made black sesame cookies, which taste vaguely peanut butter-like.
4048000	4052000	And they're dark and goth and delicious.
4052000	4055000	Anyway.
4055000	4065000	We really haven't done a whole bunch of play of anything because we're going to be starting some of the Capcom stuff when Dan gets home.
4065000	4070000	So we've just really kind of had a slacker week for playing much of anything.
4070000	4072000	I'm still playing word scapes.
4072000	4076000	I made a 25th place in the last tournament.
4076000	4077000	Good job.
4077000	4078000	Word scapes.
4078000	4083000	And I like to come up with words that I know that they won't let me pick.
4083000	4086000	Like, you know, anal.
4086000	4094000	They never let you play anal or like urea or bones or body parts that are actual real words.
4094000	4097000	I'm pretty sure I put dyke in one of them.
4097000	4100000	And I think it went I think it went to the bonus list.
4100000	4101000	I don't remember.
4101000	4103000	I just played lube.
4103000	4105000	It's a word.
4105000	4107000	You could be talking about WD40.
4107000	4109000	You don't have to be talking about, you know.
4109000	4113000	But I mean, it's just it's just pretty funny for me.
4113000	4116000	It's sort of like, how can I flex my vocabulary?
4116000	4121000	It's like what I do to wake up in the morning to get my brain to wake up.
4121000	4123000	It's a nice little mental exercise.
4123000	4124000	Yeah. So it's really fun.
4124000	4131000	You know, people want kind of a neat word game and check their spelling ability and.
4131000	4134000	What words they know, then try it.
4134000	4139000	So right after I played lube, I played rub.
4139000	4140000	All right.
4140000	4142000	If that's it for your gaming week, I will go to Loki.
4142000	4147000	How is your gaming week now that your game is out there and you don't have to worry about that?
4147000	4149000	The pressure of that?
4149000	4152000	Well, I didn't play a whole ton of games.
4152000	4155000	I played some Minecraft during the week, just kind of relax to that.
4155000	4163000	I mainly was just taking a break from computer stuff during the week, trying to watch more TV.
4163000	4170000	But yeah, so I was also trying to promote the game during the week, but, you know, little luck there.
4170000	4172000	But keep at it.
4172000	4176000	All right. My gaming week, I played I played quite a bit.
4176000	4182000	I played, as I was talking about a little earlier, I was playing that Capcom arcade stadium.
4182000	4184000	I did pick that up as soon as I heard the announcement.
4184000	4190000	If you aren't already aware, you can get it on switch and you get it with nineteen forty three for free.
4190000	4195000	And you may not realize this, but if you go in the store, you can also get ghosts and goblins for free right now.
4195000	4198000	I think that's a limited time thing to like maybe March 1st.
4198000	4200000	There's actually two free games available right now.
4200000	4202000	I went all in and just bought them all.
4202000	4205000	I was like, fuck it. Why not? I like a lot of these old Capcom classics.
4205000	4206000	I'm going to buy it.
4206000	4210000	I think the stadium is a pretty well together, well put together collection.
4210000	4216000	You know, they kind of theme it like you're in this old arcade with all the little like little sit down cabinets and, you know, so forth.
4216000	4220000	And you can actually play the game like it's being projected on one of those cabinets.
4220000	4223000	I don't like those over the top graphic filters myself.
4223000	4226000	I understand the place for them, though. Some people enjoy them.
4226000	4231000	But the nice thing is you can just play normal fucking on your TV like it's fine.
4231000	4236000	So I played a little bit of Strider I was talking about, which boy, I'm fucking terrible at that game.
4236000	4239000	That's one thing I learned. I'm very, very bad. Huh?
4239000	4240000	Everyone is.
4240000	4242000	I know it's hard. It's a hard game.
4242000	4248000	I played that. I played a little bit of Super Street Fighter, which I'm also apparently really bad at.
4248000	4250000	So I think I need to turn down the difficulty or something.
4250000	4252000	So, yeah, I was playing some of the games that collection.
4252000	4256000	It's interesting because they have like a little like tournament modes like you can actually play.
4256000	4258000	So I did the one for ghosts and goblins.
4258000	4266000	And it was basically like for this week, you're going to do this and you're trying to get the high score you can at like three times speed.
4266000	4271000	So you have to play the game at triple speed, which I mean, that game is impossible as it is already.
4271000	4274000	But try playing it on triple speed and then you get like these.
4274000	4277000	I think they're like Capcom points. I don't know what they're called.
4277000	4282000	They have a name to them like these these little pink numbers that appear in the upper right hand corner.
4282000	4289000	And they unlock things like additional frames that you can put around the screens as you're playing them and things like that.
4289000	4295000	So I think it's it's cute. It was a little more than just, you know, pick a game from the menu and play it.
4296000	4304000	They really made sure the games are very customizable, that there's online modes where you can do different things and kind of mess with the game, I guess.
4304000	4311000	Oh, and this is cool. The shooter games like 1943, you can play them sideways.
4311000	4316000	You can even do it on a TV, but it's great for when your switch is undocked because you can play a shooter game.
4316000	4320000	You can actually play it vertically or any of those Capcom games. That's pretty cool, too.
4320000	4329000	So, yeah, I recommend check out the collection. You can just play the free games that are out right now and then decide if, you know, it's worth more money to you for the other games that are in there.
4329000	4332000	So it's kind of fun. I enjoyed it.
4332000	4337000	I've been continuing, of course, Final Fantasy 14. But what else is new? I play that game all the time.
4337000	4343000	I've also been playing Final Fantasy 12. A lot of that. I talked about that a little bit last week. It's on Xbox Game Pass now.
4343000	4348000	I am now past the point in 12. That's like the furthest point I've gotten to before.
4348000	4357000	I got to Mount Buromis, I think is what it's called. And that is the point that I was left off at on a prior playthrough.
4357000	4363000	I'm really enjoying it. I feel like the story and the mechanics have really aged well.
4363000	4372000	I think there's so much, especially being a longtime 14 player, there's so much in 12 that 14 took influence from, which of course makes sense.
4372000	4377000	I mean, I've always said 14 is an evil-ese game, whether they want to admit it or not.
4377000	4382000	But also a lot of the development team from 12 worked on 14. It's very, very obvious.
4382000	4386000	So I just, I love 12. There's so many great things in it.
4386000	4393000	But I also played, so this weekend, Xbox was doing like a free Fusor weekend.
4393000	4397000	So the Harmonix game Fusor has been available this weekend for free.
4397000	4404000	Time's almost up though, so if you haven't picked it up by now, I think you're kind of out of luck because probably at midnight Eastern is when it goes away.
4404000	4406000	But I don't know, somebody might know the exact time.
4406000	4411000	But basically if you have Xbox Gold, you can play Fusor for free over the weekend.
4411000	4413000	And so I finally checked it out.
4413000	4420000	And that is the music game where you're basically taking different tracks from different songs and overlaying them over each other.
4420000	4423000	And you want to do things on the downbeat.
4423000	4431000	And then as you progress, you learn like, oh, but certain, sometimes you want to do it kind of in the middle because that's the point when like the vocals really kick in.
4431000	4433000	So you get like a bonus for that.
4433000	4439000	If you can time when you're going to drop that Rick Astley record right so he can go, never going to give you up, you know.
4439000	4443000	I will say, and also it's drop mix, but it's a game.
4443000	4448000	I will say the technology of making your own mixes is a lot of fun.
4448000	4451000	And I think especially like the freestyle mode is a lot of fun.
4451000	4455000	The game is OK.
4455000	4462000	But like, you know, OK, I'm mixing in requests from the audience and I'm trying to time things perfectly on the beat.
4462000	4477000	It doesn't really have that same satisfaction, I guess, that something like playing amplitude or rock band rivals or something like it doesn't really give the same, I guess, satisfaction that some of those games bring.
4477000	4481000	But I really do love some of the creations that I've made in the game.
4481000	4490000	Like I've really learned like, wow, Pump It Up or Pump It Up, Push It has a really great bass line that mixes with almost every song.
4490000	4495000	And like every single part of Donna Summer's Hot Stuff is great.
4495000	4498000	And you can mix it with literally anything and it sounds good.
4498000	4500000	So Donna Summer is a goddess.
4500000	4501000	Yes, that is true.
4501000	4511000	That is true. And there's there's I will say the song list, even though when I looked at it, I was kind of it has been curated very specifically for songs that really work like that.
4511000	4514000	And I think that's done very well for them.
4514000	4519000	All of that being said, 60 dollars.
4519000	4523000	I get making games is expensive and licensing the music.
4523000	4527000	And it's not just licensing the music because they have stripped these songs.
4527000	4534000	I mean, you know, you have just the vocals, you have just the keyboard part and all this stuff like.
4534000	4543000	I get that there's stuff with that. That being said, the game they are giving at the end of the day, I don't think I can justify 60 bucks for it.
4543000	4551000	It's too much. And then they have DLC and then they have these, you know, one hundred dollar editions with all these other songs and so forth.
4551000	4555000	It's just. It's too much. Sorry.
4555000	4562000	It's too much of a premium for what it is. I think once the game comes down to 20 bucks, I'll buy it for sure.
4562000	4569000	But I think this is where something like drop mix that was actually tangible, I can pick it up and take it to a friend's house.
4569000	4573000	It's a physical thing. You know, the card mechanic is really interesting.
4573000	4580000	I think that's where the high premium cost lends itself a lot better when it's actually a physical thing.
4580000	4588000	So, yeah, I like Fuser, but I don't like it. Sixty dollars. I get that it's on sale right now for like 40.
4588000	4592000	Still a little high for me for what it is. Yeah.
4592000	4600000	So fifth dream in chat says, I love the idea of the game, but the chances of them ever having a song I listen to it.
4600000	4606000	Well, I will say, though, there's a lot of songs in it that maybe wouldn't be on my playlist of music,
4606000	4610000	but they're songs that I recognize.
4610000	4617000	And when you break them down and put them back together into new songs, I do have that whole reaction of, huh, that sounds really neat.
4617000	4624000	Some of them have been garbage. I put together some real garbage songs, but I've put together some songs where I was like, I really like that.
4624000	4629000	Loki, you especially. What's that? Can you save them?
4629000	4636000	You can. I haven't played around a lot with that, but I know there is like a big community presence in there.
4636000	4644000	And if you have your deck loaded a certain way, you can save it to a favorites thing so you can pop all the records in there automatically at some point.
4644000	4651000	So there are some little techniques they have for macro. But I was going to say, Loki, I know you did a lot of mixing and stuff back in the day.
4651000	4655000	I think you'd get a kick out of this game if you haven't played it yet. Again, I don't think I have.
4655000	4659000	You'd be pissed if you paid 60 for it. But yeah, I didn't want to pay 60 bucks for it.
4659000	4665000	I think if they do another free weekend or it comes down in price, you should really check it out. I think you'd have fun with it.
4665000	4670000	All right. Yeah, let's check it out. So that was my gaming week. All right.
4670000	4677000	So let's get into some headlines. We've got a lot of stories to cover still, and we're an hour and a half in.
4677000	4681000	So we should get to these stories. So, Loki, I'll start with you.
4681000	4691000	So Microsoft has this brand new feature for some of the backwards compatibility games called Frame Rate Boost or FPS Boost, I guess is what it's called.
4691000	4702000	And it is right now supporting about five games. Far Cry 4, New Super Lucky's Tale, Sniper Elite 4, UFC 4 and Watch Dogs 2.
4702000	4709000	And they're going to be adding more games to that. Now, what that does is it allows certain games to run at a higher frame rate.
4709000	4715000	So, for example, some games that were previously 30 FPS are now 60 FPS.
4715000	4721000	Or in the case of New Super Lucky's Tale, it actually runs at 120 FPS.
4721000	4729000	So apparently this is also something that's compatible with the Xbox Series S as well.
4729000	4740000	So pretty awesome. They found some new techniques, I guess, with the DirectX part of that to be able to push higher frame rates at not much of a system cost.
4740000	4747000	So pretty cool to see some of that being added to some of these games. 60 FPS always makes things better.
4747000	4752000	And I know like certain games like Watch Dogs 2, that looks pretty nice.
4752000	4758000	You know, one thing I didn't talk about during my gaming week is Pokémon GO because they had a huge event on Saturday.
4758000	4761000	And I am tying this to what you just said, Loki. I'm not changing the subject suddenly.
4761000	4766000	But I played Pokémon GO on Saturday because they had a huge event.
4766000	4776000	And it was a really good motivating event for me to like get out and go around town and drive around and walk around and really try to collect a lot of Pokémon really fast for all the collection challenges.
4776000	4787000	But one of the challenges because it was set up like the original Pokémon game where only some Pokémon were for the red people and some Pokémon were for the green people, you had to do some trading.
4787000	4794000	So I did some trading with Alan because it turns out you didn't have to get the Pokémon during the event to get credit for them.
4794000	4798000	So Alan hasn't really played Pokémon GO in a while, but he has a lot of old Pokémon on his account.
4798000	4804000	So I got to play Pokémon GO on his phone for just a little bit because I hadn't really seen it on his newest phone.
4804000	4810000	And I was like, the frame rate on your phone is so much better than what I'm getting.
4810000	4819000	And I'd heard something about for whatever reason the iOS version is frame blocked or whatever. I guess maybe it had optimization problems or whatever.
4819000	4826000	But I noticed it. So that is the part that ties into what you're saying. When you have like that higher frame rate and everything, you really do notice it.
4826000	4835000	It plays so smoothly. And I was like, man, I hope they figure it out on the other side so I can get the game this smooth because I know it's capable.
4835000	4840000	So Act Def says it's 120 hertz. Wow.
4840000	4846000	Oh, wow. Anyway, I'm sorry. I don't know if you had anything else to say to that story, but I want to know that really.
4846000	4849000	Yeah, that's about it. Yeah.
4849000	4855000	Yeah. Microsoft isn't. You know, it's funny, especially considering there was a time when Microsoft was like, fuck backwards compatibility.
4855000	4858000	No one wants that. You know, that was under one leader.
4858000	4865000	And then they had a new leader who's paid a lot of attention to backwards compatibility and really kind of making the old stuff stronger.
4865000	4872000	And then even even things that are relatively newer, kind of, you know, making them even better through the latest technology,
4872000	4884000	especially when there haven't been a lot of like PlayStation five or Series X exclusive or optimized or whatever you want to call games that have come out yet of these new consoles.
4884000	4890000	It's nice to have these enhancements come out regularly that make the old games feel new again.
4890000	4895000	That makes sense. Yeah. All right.
4895000	4900000	Act up to saying it's not necessarily the frame rate that's higher, but it's a different hurt setting.
4900000	4907000	It's so smooth. I love it. So the display refresh rate might be one hundred twenty hertz on his phone.
4907000	4912000	Interesting. I don't even know what kind of phone he has. We're we're we're a bi-phonal household.
4912000	4917000	I have an Apple phone. He has a Samsung phone. So we we love all types here in this house.
4917000	4920000	Do you have a good phone? I like my phone. Fine.
4921000	4925000	So I'm saying you have a good phone. Yeah. Well, Alan would say he has a good phone, too.
4925000	4930000	He likes what he likes. I like what I like. All right. Anyway, let's move on.
4930000	4935000	Let's talk let's talk about a good classic franchise. Let's talk about Silent Hill.
4935000	4946000	Sadly, I have no news on Silent Hill, but I have news about the creator of Silent Hill, Kichiro Toyama, who created Silent Hill, Siren, Gravity Rush.
4946000	4954000	You may not realize he was involved with that, too. But of course, he left Sony in 2020 and he started his own company, Bokeh Game Studio.
4954000	4959000	And a little bit more information has come out about the first project.
4959000	4966000	And he says it is inspired by his past as a horror game designer. A video came out called Focus.
4966000	4970000	And in this video is kind of an interview and he talks about the creative process.
4970000	4978000	And there are some concept art that's shown for this untitled debut game coming from Bokeh Game Studios.
4978000	4985000	And so if you were into Siren or Silent Hill, you're probably going to be into what these guys are cooking up.
4985000	4989000	Now, of course, some people are saying, well, is it Silent Hill they're making?
4989000	5001000	I'm not sure. I don't I almost wonder if it's a little bit like Igarashi and Bloodstained where it's like, we're not making Silent Hill wink.
5001000	5009000	We're making Loud Valley. Yeah, Loud Valley. Exactly. Or Quiet Mountain.
5009000	5014000	You know, it's going to be something, you know, very, very similar. But we'll see.
5014000	5019000	I also, because I know this is another series, you talk a lot about Dark Sakura.
5019000	5031000	As part of the interview, Toyama talked about being interested in the trend of death game entertainment like Danganronpa or the anime franchise Mirai Nikki as being an inspiration for this.
5031000	5034000	So there could be some Danganronpa in your Quiet Mountain.
5034000	5044000	So interesting. The idea, the idea of regular people driven into irrational situations will likely show up in the game.
5044000	5051000	Hmm. By the way, there was a rumor that Akira Yamaoka was making music for an upcoming game.
5051000	5058000	Hmm. Hmm. Again, I have a feeling they're not making Silent Hill, but they're probably making Quiet Mountain.
5058000	5066000	So something to think about. Hmm. Anyway, of course, now, now everybody in chat has their own names.
5066000	5070000	Sia Diberi says, Shh, Savannah.
5070000	5075000	I picked Loud Valley because it's a quiet, it's opposite of Silent Hill.
5075000	5081000	I know, but I, I love, come on, tell me the name. Shh, Savannah isn't fucking funny. That's funny.
5081000	5083000	And it's kind of funny.
5083000	5090000	What was the other name? Moderately Loud Mesa. That's a good one, too. Quiet Country.
5090000	5095000	I love that you guys are all just lighting up with your knockoff names.
5095000	5103000	It's great. What I ordered online versus when it arrived. No, I know that that particular analogy isn't appropriate here because I'm sure the game will be fine.
5103000	5105000	Are we making the Wish version of Silent Hill?
5105000	5110000	No, I don't want to put that label on it because, A, we haven't seen a frame of gameplay. We've only seen concept art.
5110000	5119000	And B, it might be really good, like bloodstains pretty good. So I, I don't want to necessarily say this is going to be a cheap ass version of Silent Hill.
5119000	5126000	It actually, it could be better. Let's give it that opportunity.
5126000	5132000	Hushed Hollow. Sanctuary of Silence. Oh, good question.
5132000	5133000	I play that.
5133000	5140000	Orange Right in chat says, I'm sorry, I didn't credit Pod Culture for Hushed Hollow, Phoenix 7726 for Sanctuary of Silence.
5140000	5148000	Orange Right is bringing up the cat ending. Yes. Well, here's the thing. In Savannah, you get a dog ending.
5148000	5153000	No, wait, no, the dog ending is Silent Hill. I'm sorry, cat ending is, never mind, I screwed that up. I get it.
5153000	5157000	And instead of a UFO ending, you get like a ghost ending.
5157000	5159000	You get a paranormal ending.
5159000	5162000	You get a werewolf ending.
5162000	5169000	Sacred Jade. Pipe down planes.
5169000	5171000	All right.
5171000	5178000	Sia Tabiri brings up, no, but apparently there's a Five Nights at Freddy's knockoff movie that just came out with Nicolas Cage.
5178000	5183000	And I watched it and it was awesome. You saw the movie? Really? I did watch it, yeah.
5183000	5190000	Oh, wow. Now that looked like the Wish version, but like in the good way, where like Showgirls is unironically good.
5190000	5195000	It was, it was OK. It wasn't like.
5195000	5198000	It was, it was cheesy.
5198000	5202000	I don't know. They had parts that were really good.
5202000	5211000	And then parts like, it's not a complete ripoff. It's, it's similar, but it's not the same.
5211000	5216000	Sia Tabiri in chat says that Savannah has a guinea pig ending.
5216000	5219000	I know how to get Dark Soccer on board. How about a possum ending?
5219000	5222000	Yes, it needs a possum ending. I'll play that.
5222000	5227000	Yeah. So you can watch the movie. They have it available like through, I think, Voodoo right now.
5227000	5232000	I think that's where I rented it. And it's like 20 bucks to watch Willy's Wonderland.
5232000	5236000	Yeah. I'm waiting for those premium fees to fade a little bit because I want to see.
5236000	5241000	Everybody is telling me because I love movies like cheesy comedies like Romy Michelle's High School.
5241000	5247000	Everybody's telling me that I would love that Kristen Wiig movie. The Barb and Star go to Vista Del Mar or something like that.
5247000	5253000	Speaking of movies, did you want to catch the trailer for Mortal Kombat?
5253000	5258000	Oh, good question. Good aside here before we get to the next story. Yes, I did.
5258000	5264000	And it looks pretty cool. I mean, obviously you didn't like it.
5264000	5268000	Ava and Melina. Oh, yeah. Where's your fights?
5268000	5273000	Yeah, but they apparently they do have more for Melina. It's just they haven't shown that stuff yet.
5273000	5276000	But apparently she does look like the original.
5276000	5282000	That's why I'm trying to cut him some slack on two is that maybe there's more to it than just the one scene we saw.
5282000	5288000	But I'm not a big violent person, though, but whatever.
5288000	5296000	Moral Kombat is so over the top. It's a little. But even like that scene with like Sub-Zero and Jax's arms, I was like, oh, God, that's too much.
5296000	5301000	You know, like, wow. But it looks good when they do a better trailer.
5301000	5309000	I might be a little bit more excited about it. But the only thing that really looks exciting to me was them going into I mean,
5309000	5315000	it's clearly the original Sub-Zero, the one who was an asshole.
5315000	5322000	But I think I don't like the the audience insertion character call or whatever his name.
5322000	5327000	Oh, yeah. Like what the deal is, they're fucking unnecessary.
5327000	5334000	We don't need it. We don't need a character insertion, you know, an audience representative in it,
5334000	5338000	because the people who are going to see Mortal Kombat, no fucking Mortal Kombat.
5338000	5340000	Mortal Kombat. We don't need it.
5340000	5345000	They said they wanted to make a new character because they always introduce new characters in Mortal Kombat games.
5345000	5350000	I don't think. Yeah, I get it. Yeah, I agree with you. It's kind of stupid.
5350000	5353000	And where's Johnny Cage? They're saving Johnny Cage for the sequel.
5353000	5356000	They didn't want it. They wouldn't want to burn every character right away.
5356000	5362000	I think that's what the deal is with Johnny Cage. Maybe Cole is new Sub-Zero.
5362000	5366000	I bet I bet there's a twist like that that happens. But obviously, I don't know.
5366000	5372000	Obviously, I don't know anything. But but if they're sticking to any resemblance of canon,
5372000	5379000	then it's somebody else who's a different Sub-Zero. It would be another Lin Kuei.
5379000	5382000	So, oh, we'll see. No, it's just it's just terrible. Yeah.
5382000	5388000	And like Sacred Jade said, Sub-Zero becomes Bihan. Well, Bihan is Sub-Zero, but who also later becomes Noob Saibot.
5388000	5396000	So don't don't get me started on. I'm still pissed off about Sindel, OK?
5396000	5400000	Yeah. Where was Sindel in that trailer? No, I'm pissed off about what the last game did to her.
5400000	5406000	Oh, yeah. All right. Let's move on, though. Sorry, we had a quick aside, but that was worth bringing up because you're right.
5406000	5411000	I didn't have the trailer in a story slot. So. All right. Let's talk about game leaks.
5412000	5419000	Well, Rare, I know a lot of folks here know about the origins of games and we all know that.
5419000	5422000	And if you don't know it, then you're about to learn a thing.
5422000	5430000	Star Fox Adventures began as a game called Dinosaur Planet for the Nintendo 64, of course, by Rare.
5430000	5440000	And a game preservationist, Forest of Illusion, obtained a copy of the game fully playable.
5440000	5449000	I mean, some of the stuff is glitchy and doesn't necessarily play well, but it is the build from December 1st, 2000.
5449000	5454000	So it's a late build of the game and it needed a little work to be playable to the end.
5454000	5464000	And so they actually have the ROM available for download through their Twitter.
5464000	5471000	Actually, their main link on their website went down, so they put up another one, but it's available through their Twitter account.
5471000	5480000	But it was supposed to be like the big ending, you know, for the N64 was to have this game come out.
5480000	5486000	It had environments and dialogue that used the RAM expansion pack and it was a 512 megabyte cartridge.
5486000	5492000	Would have been the biggest on the console. And, yeah, no.
5492000	5498000	This is, by the way, the same group that did the Zelda 64 beta earlier this year.
5498000	5500000	Oh, OK.
5500000	5509000	I downloaded it, so we'll see how that goes. I don't have an EverDrive for my N64, but, you know, with a little bit of work, I could probably play it on my emulator.
5509000	5518000	Yeah. It's interesting to see these relics from the past kind of show up, even though, you know, I know we get into dicey territory with what should we be looking at versus what shouldn't we.
5518000	5525000	But, you know, especially since this did kind of end up becoming something else anyway, I think it's an interesting part of gaming's history.
5525000	5528000	So I'm kind of glad it's at least preserved, if nothing else.
5528000	5534000	And the bits that I've seen of it, I thought it was going to be a great game.
5534000	5538000	I mean, it looks like it was supposed to be pretty good.
5538000	5558000	I mean, and the thing is, is that when the legend said that Miyamoto saw the footage and thought that it should be remade into a game with Fox McCloud, and that basically the team didn't really care for that idea a lot because they had to rewrite different places to accommodate Star Fox.
5558000	5571000	And then they had to change a lot of the game structure. But basically, you know, they were all really attached to Dinosaur Planet and had to change gears to put it in Star Fox.
5571000	5581000	But to be able to go back and play what would have been the original game would have been great.
5581000	5586000	So I'm actually pretty excited about this.
5586000	5597000	You know, there were characters that were kind of small characters in Star Fox 64 that had bigger roles in Dinosaur Planet.
5597000	5606000	And then, you know, so you can play through it and see elements that made it into Star Fox 64.
5606000	5611000	But honestly, I think Dinosaur Planet would have just been fun on its own.
5611000	5620000	It was pretty annoying, pretty annoying, pretty annoyed that, you know, it was something that didn't come out.
5621000	5631000	And of course, there was also that playable build that they found of Goldeneye Xbox Live Arcade. So another leak.
5631000	5636000	Yeah. All coming from the rare stuff. So, yeah.
5636000	5642000	All right. Well, let's move on with another story. Classic Game of the Week coming up. But first, Loki.
5642000	5650000	Yeah. So there was this big Skyrim mod called Wormstooth that was developed back in actually quite a while ago.
5650000	5657000	It was removed from Nexus mods back in 2016, apparently by the original author.
5657000	5664000	Now he has brought it back and has brought it back with a brand new trailer, which is pretty awesome.
5664000	5669000	So one of the things I thought was actually kind of unique about this is the actual trailer itself.
5669000	5674000	So he uses a text to speech A.I. to recreate the Skyrim voice actors.
5674000	5682000	And it sounds really cool, which makes me think, you know, hey, when people are putting together these new expansions to the game,
5682000	5687000	a lot of times they will have their own voice actors come in and do the lines.
5687000	5696000	Well, now they could just use this A.I. to generate basically the dialogue for the game using the original voice actors,
5696000	5704000	which may get them in some hot water or not. Who knows? But it's pretty cool.
5704000	5710000	So it's available now if you want to check it out on Nexus mods.
5710000	5715000	All right. I have to get Alan's impressions on that because he loves the Skyrim mod stuff.
5715000	5718000	So I don't know. That has to be on his radar. Yeah.
5718000	5724000	Wormstooth adds a whole new like island to basically explore and there's a bunch of side quests and stuff in there.
5724000	5732000	They have new companions. You can get like a wolf follower and lots of cool stuff to go along with that.
5732000	5739000	So it looks cool. I have to really go back in the more Skyrim again.
5739000	5742000	It's been fun. My kid actually wanted me to get it for him.
5742000	5748000	So I picked up a switch version as well. So they're going to be playing Skyrim.
5748000	5753000	All right. Well, moving on to a story that's pretty frustrating.
5753000	5758000	Honestly, it's another Stadia story. I'm sorry, but they keep they keep taking headlines.
5758000	5767000	What can I say? Apparently, the folks at Google that were laid off from Stadia were pretty shocked by the news because just the week prior,
5767000	5772000	vice president and general manager Phil Harrison had sent out an email to everybody that said,
5772000	5779000	great progress that the studios have made so far. And then the mass layoffs came just a few days later.
5779000	5790000	An email that was sent by Phil Harrison said, Stadia Games Entertainment has made great progress building a diverse and talented team and establishing a strong lineup of Stadia exclusive games.
5790000	5801000	We will confirm the SG&E, Stadia Games Entertainment, investment envelope shortly, which will in turn inform the SG&E strategy and 2021 objectives and key results.
5801000	5805000	Of course, five days later, they were all gone.
5805000	5808000	No comment from Google on this whole thing as well.
5808000	5816000	But I mean, it does also just bring add fuel to the fire where, you know, how the fuck does Phil Harrison still have a job right now?
5816000	5820000	I'm just going to be blunt. How does Phil Harrison still have a job right now at Google?
5820000	5826000	Because if everybody else was getting cut, cut, he should have got cut, too.
5826000	5831000	Sorry about it, but this just kind of adds fuel to that fire as far as I'm concerned.
5831000	5835000	So it'll be interesting to see what ends up in the coming months that come from this.
5835000	5843000	So Jade Raymond also had said in a statement, by the way, after the layoffs, you know, kind of the nice PR thing.
5843000	5846000	I don't think she said anything that you can read too much into.
5846000	5852000	But I am proud of the team we built at Stadia Games Entertainment and the groundbreaking work on exclusive games to the platform.
5852000	5860000	It was a difficult decision to take on a new opportunity, and I will be forever grateful to this team for everything we learned and achieved together.
5861000	5866000	Yeah. So that is unfortunate how that all went down.
5866000	5870000	Yeah. Actdeft in chat says, hey, you're doing great. Keep it up. Just not here.
5870000	5880000	That's unfortunate. All right. Hope those folks are able to find work that they enjoy within Google or somewhere else like Jade Raymond.
5880000	5884000	All right. Moving on. And excellent counterpoint.
5884000	5894000	Sorry, I guess not moving on, but excellent counterpoint by Phoenix7726 in chat saying, how does Eves at Ubisoft still have a job after the sexual harassment scandals he covered up?
5894000	5900000	And how did the CEOs at CD Projekt Red still have a job right now? I thought for sure one of them would be gone by this point.
5902000	5907000	Isn't that isn't that shitty how all the people in power just never want to leave power?
5907000	5911000	Because the shareholders like money and they don't really care about people.
5911000	5916000	Well, the thing is, Stadia is not making money.
5916000	5923000	Well, that's true. It's Google, though. So you don't invest directly in the stadium, invest in Google as a whole.
5923000	5927000	And true, they're making money. It's just.
5927000	5932000	They just spread themselves too thin with some of this stuff and do a half-assed job about it.
5932000	5940000	All right. Well, let's take a trip down memory lane to a time when development was a little bit simpler and at least it was a little more innocent, maybe.
5940000	5949000	It's classic game of the week. And every week, dark soccer steps into the vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, maybe you kids should be playing this game this week.
5949000	5953000	Dark Sakura, what classic? Well, actually, I already know.
5953000	5960000	So I can say you picked a classic among classics that I'm kind of surprised wasn't in your modern list earlier, actually.
5960000	5966000	I seriously thought I had done this one to meet like I checked the classic game list.
5966000	5969000	I don't know if you did. Yes, I double checked.
5969000	5973000	I yeah, I'm usually fine with whatever you say.
5973000	5977000	But then sometimes I'll have that nagging voice that is like, I swear we did this.
5977000	5986000	And this one somehow wasn't there. Game is portal portal.
5986000	5991000	And I even checked to see if I had just done the orange box, you know? No, no.
5991000	5995000	But I did think I did. Narbacular drop. You did.
5995000	6000000	So maybe that's what I was thinking of, which Narbacular drop is is pretty fun.
6000000	6011000	But anyway, to go back into portal portal basically was a game that was developed and published by Valve in 2007 that was released with the orange box.
6011000	6015000	Came out on Windows, Xbox 360 and PS3.
6015000	6020000	And of course, there's been other ports, including Mac OS, Linux and Android.
6020000	6029000	It is a series of puzzles that have to be solved by teleporting through the game using the Aperture Science handheld portal device.
6029000	6040000	And you get a talk to by GLaDOS, who is definitely, well, motivating, I guess.
6040000	6062000	I don't know. Chell is, and it's not Chell, it's Chell, as we've heard in various makings of, who is taunted by GLaDOS and still must go through the game and make it to the end through clever use of portals.
6062000	6067000	But going back to a little bit of history of the game.
6067000	6085000	The game was based on a concept from a game called Narbacular Drop that was created by members, by people at DigiPen Institute of Technology, and they were hired by Valve to make Portal.
6085000	6090000	So Portal is actually the spiritual successor to Narbacular Drop.
6090000	6093000	You can still play Narbacular Drop, by the way.
6093000	6109000	So it was really lauded as one of the most original games to come out, which really says something because we don't really get a lot of people talking about originality.
6109000	6116000	GLaDOS was voiced by Ella McLean, who is absolutely delightful and talented.
6116000	6125000	And then, of course, we had one of my favorite hilarious singers, Jonathan Coulton, do the end song, Still Alive.
6125000	6131000	I've always been a big fan of Jonathan Coulton, so of course I was really, really tickled.
6131000	6136000	And I got to meet him. Remember when we went to PAX?
6137000	6140000	He let me take all kinds of pictures with him. He was a really nice guy.
6140000	6148000	Anyway, so Portal has been even cited as one of the greatest games of all times.
6148000	6156000	Outside of Steam downloads, over 4 million copies of the game have been sold since its release.
6156000	6165000	And there's merchandise, plus weighted companion cubes, and fans making the Black Forest cake because the cake is a lie.
6165000	6176000	Portal guns, and then there is a standalone called Portal Still Alive that was released on Xbox Live Arcade service in 2008 that had 14 more puzzles.
6176000	6181000	And of course, Portal 2 in 2011, which we will talk about at another time.
6182000	6198000	Anyway, basically, like I said, you play Chell, you play first person, and you have to use the Portal gun to open an orange and a blue portal in different locations.
6198000	6203000	So one, you know, you exit through whichever one and exit through the other.
6203000	6208000	It's basically moving through three-dimensional space, but you also have physics to play along with it.
6208000	6221000	For example, you know, if you want to fling yourself across a room, you can throw a portal on the top of the wall, like way above you,
6221000	6228000	and then put a portal on the ground and jump into it, which would give you forward momentum to cover a large gap.
6229000	6231000	They do call that flinging.
6231000	6238000	And then, of course, you get reoriented because of gravity when you go into the right-hand portal.
6238000	6250000	So you cannot pass one shot through an open portal. It will deactivate it, and then you have to create a new portal and a new offset.
6250000	6263000	So basically, you can do things like move objects, and you have different wall services, and you can anchor in different places.
6263000	6269000	Sometimes they won't link to certain walls, so you have that to deal with.
6269000	6278000	And then you're also given these little cubes that you can use to press down buttons and levers and, you know, use it to activate different mechanisms.
6278000	6283000	And then when you're done, you have this particle field called the Emancipation Grill.
6283000	6287000	Actually, in the developer commentary, they called it Fizzlers.
6287000	6299000	That would allow anything that you carry with you apart from, you know, yourself and the portal gun, and deactivate the portals in the previous room.
6299000	6304000	They also will block any attempt to fire a portal through them.
6305000	6318000	So Chell also wears these heel springs to keep from falling, which I believe they were called the Longfall Boots, or maybe the Longfallboots or Portal 2.
6318000	6320000	No, they're Longfallboots.
6320000	6330000	Okay. And she, you know, she won't die from falling from a great height or anything, but there are other things that can kill you.
6330000	6338000	Balancing balls of energy, toxic liquid, deadly neurotoxin, and the turret guns.
6338000	6341000	Turret guns are hilarious and adorable, and I love them.
6341000	6343000	I have a couple of little ones.
6343000	6352000	And true story, when I was learning Maya in college, my final presentation was a portal turret.
6352000	6357000	And my teacher liked it so much that he made me shaders and light sources for it.
6358000	6360000	So I was pretty happy.
6360000	6368000	So basically if Chell gets a certain amount of damage in a short period of time, she will die.
6368000	6371000	But she does restore her health fairly quickly.
6371000	6376000	And there are multiple solutions to the puzzles.
6376000	6385000	I mean, yeah, you've got a main way to do it, but sometimes the fun of it is deciding on different ways to solve those puzzles.
6386000	6393000	And then as you keep going, you'll get some different challenge maps.
6393000	6397000	Advanced chambers, you get when the game is completed.
6397000	6406000	You have challenge mode, so you have to complete, like, test chambers with as little time as possible, or the fewest portals, or the fewest footsteps.
6406000	6410000	The advanced mode are a lot more complicated.
6411000	6418000	So basically you have your two characters, like I said before, and Chell is the silent protagonist.
6418000	6427000	And then there's GLaDOS, that stands for Genetic Life Form and Disk Operating System, who is an AI who is obsessed with testing.
6427000	6429000	And you must test. You have to test.
6431000	6433000	And GLaDOS is also a liar.
6433000	6443000	Basically has just made up a lot of crazy backstory that may or may not be facts, such as Chell being adopted, an orphan, having no friends, and questionable.
6443000	6452000	There is also a comic, which I actually super like, called Lab Rat, that talks about the gap between Portal and Portal 2.
6452000	6459000	That basically where Chell was rejected as a test subject for having too much tenacity.
6459000	6468000	And so they used Doug Rattmann. Then you actually get stuff for Rattmann in the second game, but he moved Chell to the top of the test queue.
6470000	6480000	So you're in this research facility, and in Portal 2 they said that it's in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
6480000	6488000	And the lab is for Aperture Science, which was a competitor with Black Mesa.
6489000	6500000	Except that Kave Johnson, their founder, was crazy. He was supposed to make shower curtains for the US military, and he became mentally unstable for moon rock poisoning.
6500000	6508000	And we'll get into more of that, because that's all backstory on there, but yeah. They were complete competitors with Black Mesa.
6509000	6516000	And for the record, Pod Culture. Portal, that is not exactly how the line went. I'm a potato.
6516000	6520000	I think it's, how are you doing? Because I'm a potato.
6521000	6523000	Because, anyway.
6524000	6542000	Anyway, so moving forward. As you keep going through the test, you come across a cube that has a heart on it, and it's the Weighted Companion Cube.
6542000	6551000	And it has a heart on it, and it's your friend, but GLaDOS tells you it has to be euthanized through an emergency intelligence incinerator before Chell can continue.
6551000	6560000	And then there's, you know, the turrets have these cute little voices, I don't hate you, you know. And then they're sympathetic when you kill them.
6560000	6570000	And then the final chamber, this is the part where she kills you. Which was actually in Portal 2, there was a part called, this is the part where he kills you.
6570000	6579000	So anyway, you keep having these signs for cake, and GLaDOS talks about cake, but the cake is really a lie.
6579000	6588000	And you get to see graffiti as you're going through the game that has the statements such as, the cake is a lie.
6588000	6605000	You have pastiches of the Chariot by Emily Dickinson, and the Reaper in Flowers by Longfellow, and Emily Bronte's No Coward Soul is Mine, but referring to the death of the Companion Cube.
6606000	6616000	So at any rate, you eventually escape through some clever use of portals, and you're playing behind the scenes, which is actually my favorite part of the game.
6616000	6628000	I love going, I have this thing about games where I want to go to the places I'm not supposed to, and in this case the places I'm not supposed to go to are actually the places that you're supposed to go to in the game.
6628000	6647000	So basically, spoiler alert, when you defeat GLaDOS, you're escaped, and then you get dragged away by an unseen entity in a robotic voice that thanks you for assuming the party escort submission position.
6648000	6666000	And then the final, final scene is you see the Black Forest cake, and the Weighted Companion Cube, and a mix of inactive personality cores, and then the cake gets, the candle on the cake gets snuffed. Just like that. Just like that.
6666000	6669000	I like the speed runs where they actually get to the cake.
6697000	6705000	Valve became interested in it at the DigiPen annual career fair, and really wanted to bring them in and have them do work on it.
6705000	6718000	So a lot of really crazy development went into it, and they were given pretty much free reign to make the game as they wanted to, basically without constraints.
6718000	6732000	So they basically worked on gameplay without any narrative. They just wanted to have fun, but they wanted to know what the test chambers were leaning toward when people were playing it, so they came up with a narrative for it.
6732000	6747000	And basically the game has this very clear beginning, clear middle, clear end with GLaDOS narrating the entire way as you go through it.
6747000	6756000	And then they used the cake just as, you know, part of the developer process and just threw that in there because people like cake. As a joke.
6757000	6778000	So they kept the settings very austere because they wanted to do the puzzles. They wanted there to be able to complete the puzzles without having too much decoration or anything nonfunctional.
6778000	6795000	So they kept it pretty minimalist. I'll be honest, there are certain parts of Portal, even though they're not perfectly cubed out rooms, that kind of make me think of Cube. Have you seen that movie, Rob?
6795000	6798000	Oh yes I have. It's been a long time.
6799000	6816000	But you know how in the different rooms in Cube, each of them will have their own little trap or challenge or something? And for the record, Hypercube is my favorite in that trilogy. The third one was shit and the first one was great, but I prefer Hypercube.
6816000	6822000	I hear they remade the first one. They have a Japanese movie now. There's a Japanese version now.
6822000	6833000	I'll have to look for it. I also liked Cube because it had Nicole DeBoer in it who was Esri Dax.
6833000	6858000	But anyway, I'm not going to get too much more into a lot of the development of the game. There is actually a walkthrough version with development points that you can hear commentary from the developers.
6863000	6877000	Basically, the Aperture Science Handheld Portal device, abbreviated as ASHPD, is also a shortening of the name Adrian Shepard, who is the protagonist of Half-Life Opposing Force. So that's kind of funny.
6877000	6887000	And then the Black Forest Cake was chosen based on a Black Forest Cake at Regent Bakery and Cafe in Redmond, Washington as an easter egg in the game.
6887000	6895000	And then the Regent Bakery since then stated that their Black Forest Cake has become their best-selling item.
6896000	6908000	So it has a lot of music and it's very ambient, kind of mysterious, and it really just adds to the technical feel of the game like you're in a lab.
6908000	6913000	And then, of course, Still Alive by Jonathan Colton was sung by Ella McLean.
6914000	6927000	She's classically trained a pratic soprano. I've heard interviews of her doing actual opera, and I think that in the end of Portal 2 that was her singing as well.
6927000	6937000	But you also get sort of up-tempo Latin versions of Still Alive playing over through radios and everything.
6938000	6946000	And so you can get the soundtrack with the Portal 2 soundtrack. It's Portal 2 songs to test by.
6946000	6952000	And you can get that via Steam Music or if you can find it to buy.
6952000	6962000	So basically, like I said, it was released with the Orange Box for Windows and Xbox 360 on October 10th, 2007, and a PS3 version on December 11th the same year.
6962000	6971000	You could also just get the Windows version separately through Valve's service theme, and then they had a standalone retail one.
6971000	6979000	In addition to Portal, the Orange Boxes included Half-Life 2, the two add-on episodes, and Team Fortress 2.
6979000	6989000	And basically, no one knew what people were going to think of Portal. It was pretty safe to have it on there, but it was really popular.
6990000	7000000	And then there was a demo version in January 2008 called Portal The First Slice that was free for any Steam user who was using NVIDIA graphics hardware.
7000000	7010000	So it was like a little collaboration. And then there were test chambers 0 to 10, so there were 11 total.
7011000	7021000	And then it was also the first Valve game to be added to the OS X compatible list of games on the Steam client for Steam Play.
7021000	7031000	So that was also very good. It was a free play title for Steam users during the first two weeks following the Mac client launch, so there was that.
7031000	7039000	And then Portal Still Alive, I brought that up earlier. It had the original game, 14 new challenges, and different achievements available.
7039000	7046000	And then, you know, don't forget, there's also been some Portal collaborations. Like, what was the Bridge Builder game that had a Portal version?
7046000	7049000	Oh, yeah, yeah. Bridge Simulator or something like that.
7049000	7050000	Yeah, Bridge Simulator or something like that.
7050000	7051000	Bridge Constructor.
7052000	7059000	And at any rate, the game has been just absolutely adored. It got great ratings.
7059000	7074000	Metacritic gives it an aggregate score of 90 of 100. It's got 9s out of 10, 9 out of 10, 4.5 out of 5, you know, so it's been really just well received.
7074000	7079000	And it's won many awards. I knew this one was going to be a long segment.
7079000	7089000	It won the Game of the Year award, also Innovation Award and Best Game Design Award at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2008.
7089000	7098000	Glad I got Most Memorable Villain from GamePro. It's just, it's basically, it won a bunch of awards.
7098000	7107000	And Time Magazine ranked it in 2012 as one of the top 100 video games of all time.
7107000	7113000	And Wired considered it to be one of the most influential games of the first decade of the 21st century.
7113000	7122000	So, stuff. I don't know what happened to my Weighted Companion Cube Fuzzy Dice. I know I had a pair.
7122000	7131000	But there's so much merchandise. Like, I have a Weighted Companion Cube plush somewhere behind me. I have a...
7131000	7133000	We don't have your cam up right now. We're still looking at the game.
7133000	7139000	Oh, well, I have one. My dice are somewhere. I have Weighted Companion Cube dice.
7139000	7148000	You could get, like, Aperture Science mugs and stickers and all kinds of stuff.
7148000	7151000	But you know what you can't get is Portal 3.
7151000	7154000	Hey, that's because Valve can't count to three.
7154000	7157000	Then again, Capcom eventually learned how to.
7158000	7166000	But, you know, the cake is a lie has become, like, even people who never played it pretty much know what the cake is a lie is.
7166000	7172000	There's a modding community around Portal that did their own test chambers and modifications.
7172000	7177000	There's a group called We Create Stuff that had an Adobe Flash version of Portal called Portal the Flash version.
7177000	7185000	It came out just before the orange box. And it actually was converted to a map pack for the final game.
7185000	7194000	There is a mod called Portal Prelude that focuses on the pre-GlaDOS era of Aperture Science with crafty and challenging test chambers.
7194000	7201000	There's an ASCII portal. There is an unofficial port to the iPhone using Unity, but it only has one room.
7201000	7211000	There's Mario that's with a Zero, which is a fan-made four-player co-op of... mashup of Super Mario Bros. and Portal.
7211000	7214000	It's gonna be a six-hour show tonight if we cover all the mods.
7214000	7217000	I know, I know, I know. I'm just going over some of the major ones.
7217000	7224000	But basically, the original game had Chell just left in that parking lot.
7224000	7231000	But the update had Chell being pulled back in by a party escort bot for the Portal 2 release.
7231000	7233000	And you want to know what's great about Portal 2?
7233000	7236000	It was released on my birthday in 2011.
7236000	7240000	That's right. But you know what they haven't released is Portal 3.
7241000	7247000	Rob, because Valve can't count to three.
7247000	7248000	Well, it's just unfortunate.
7248000	7255000	They're gonna have to talk to whoever helped Capcom with their developmental skills to teach them how to count to three.
7255000	7265000	I wanna know. Then we'll get Super Portal 2 Dreams Come True edition for matching service and all that stuff.
7265000	7267000	What about Team Fortress 3?
7268000	7273000	Alright. I think we've covered all the angles of Portal.
7273000	7276000	The classic game of the week. A real classic.
7276000	7278000	I remember when this game first came out.
7278000	7282000	And I think we kind of missed the orange box when it first, first came out.
7282000	7285000	But then we started hearing all the hype about Portal.
7285000	7290000	And we kind of went back and experienced Portal and it's pretty amazing.
7290000	7292000	It's a wonderful game.
7292000	7293000	Alright.
7293000	7305000	Well, you know what's funny is that I had Becky over one time to play that one scene with the Lemons in Portal 2.
7305000	7306000	Oh yeah.
7306000	7312000	But it's actually led to one of my favorite songs called the Ambition Song.
7312000	7319000	Where basically it sounds kind of like, oh crap, what's that name?
7320000	7323000	Oh, I can't think of his name. The dude that did Uptown Funk?
7329000	7332000	No. And I'm thinking of Mark Ronson because he's also worked with him.
7332000	7337000	But anyway, he had Bruno Mars. Thank you.
7337000	7340000	Bruno Mars. It's like I can sing it and I can't name the guy.
7340000	7343000	He did that Lazy Song. You know, today I don't want to do anything.
7343000	7350000	But they took kind of a mashup of that and the radio version of Still Alive, you know, with the horns and everything.
7350000	7355000	And made a song that's nothing but Cave Johnson ranting, but rhyming.
7355000	7360000	And that song is fantastic. It is one of my favorite things to come out of Portal.
7360000	7363000	And I think, did Pod Culture just link it for us?
7363000	7367000	So don't listen to it now. Listen to us. But that's the Lemons speech.
7367000	7369000	I'll have to find the Ambition Song for everybody later.
7370000	7375000	All right. All right. A longer segment than some runs of the game.
7375000	7378000	But it is one of our all time favorites after all here at Orange Dance Radio.
7378000	7381000	It's Portal, the classic game of the week.
7381000	7385000	Good, good, good, good pick. Again, surprised we haven't picked that one before.
7385000	7390000	All right. Let's quickly travel around the world and check out some other quick headlines in rapid fire news.
7390000	7392000	Loki, we'll start with you.
7392000	7395000	So For Honor is getting some Shovel Knight content.
7395000	7402000	Unfortunately, not Shovel Knight himself, but outfits and emotes, which I guess is kind of cool.
7402000	7407000	Those are going to be available in For Honor until March 4th.
7407000	7411000	It's a limited time thing. So check it out.
7411000	7421000	And then also, the company behind the game Minute is doing a kind of a racer spinoff of it.
7421000	7426000	And it's for charity, which is pretty awesome. So you can check that out.
7426000	7433000	I believe that's on itch.io called Minute Fun Racer.
7433000	7437000	And it looked kind of cool. So 100 percent of the proceeds are going to charity.
7437000	7439000	Minute's a cool little title.
7439000	7444000	It is. And the game looked pretty fun in the little racer as well. So check it out.
7444000	7447000	All right. Going on to some headlines I have.
7447000	7450000	I honestly thought this game had been canceled at this point, but it hasn't.
7450000	7455000	It's New World, the MMO coming from Amazon Game Studios.
7455000	7465000	This game was originally supposed to be out in May of 2020, and now it's slipped all the way to August 31st, 2021, a closed beta starting on July 20th.
7465000	7468000	Obviously, a lot went wrong with 2020.
7468000	7474000	So I understand the multiple delays, but I thought the Amazon internal developments were having a lot of problems.
7474000	7477000	But we'll see how the game turns out at the end of the day.
7477000	7483000	So there's YouTube if you want to see a new interview with the game director, Scott Lane.
7483000	7487000	But anyway, I might check that out when the beta starts. Well, it's a closed beta.
7487000	7492000	Maybe I'll get in it somehow, but I can always check out the full version when that releases in August.
7492000	7495000	Could be interesting.
7495000	7500000	Jason mentioned this in the intro tonight, but more media coming from more games.
7500000	7503000	This one's a little surprising, though. Dota 2.
7503000	7508000	Speaking of Valve, and there'll never be a Dota 3, because why would there be? There's a Dota 2.
7508000	7511000	Defense of the Ancients, of course. Of course, this game is still huge.
7511000	7515000	I mean, you know, so many people everywhere around the world playing this game.
7515000	7521000	Dota 2 is getting an anime series from Netflix. It's called Dota Dragon's Blood.
7521000	7527000	This is the same studio animating it that did Voltron Legacy Defender, or excuse me, Voltron Legendary Defender.
7527000	7532000	So that's kind of neat. It's an eight episode series, and it's going to come out worldwide on March 25th.
7532000	7538000	So more gaming stuff on Netflix. Not that I think any of us are complaining.
7538000	7541000	Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
7541000	7545000	There's a game actually that I was really into called Firewatch. It's a really good game.
7545000	7552000	So on the Switch version, there's actually a little hidden secret game on it.
7552000	7559000	And it's only on this one. So for the fifth anniversary of Firewatch,
7559000	7569000	Cable Sasser, who was the co-founder of Panic, shared a secret that has a note that was stuck to a random sign in the game.
7569000	7575000	In which if you find it, you get a new location on the map that follows through,
7575000	7581000	unlocks a game called Forest 64, which is a hidden N64 inspired platformer.
7581000	7586000	And it looks like you play as a little bear, just like running around collecting stuff. It's pretty cute.
7586000	7589000	You actually even get an achievement for it.
7589000	7594000	That's crazy that this was in the game the whole time and nobody ever found it until now.
7594000	7595000	Only in the Switch version.
7595000	7598000	Yeah, only in the Switch version, which maybe is why people didn't find it,
7598000	7602000	because they weren't expecting the Switch to have anything special for it. So who knows?
7602000	7609000	And it is pretty convoluted the way to find it, but it's always neat to find these little treasures way after the fact.
7609000	7619000	Yeah, and also SNK is working on a Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Switch compilation.
7619000	7627000	So that'll be cool. I mean, we would have, why can't I make words happen?
7627000	7633000	SNK versus Capcom, match of the millennium. Hopefully we'll get a few other things.
7633000	7637000	I mean, there's also going to be King of Fighters R2 and Samurai Shodown 2.
7637000	7646000	Last Blade Beyond Destiny, Fatal Fury First Contact, which I think I have all of those, I want to say.
7646000	7653000	I know I have King of Fighters R2 and Samurai Shodown 2, and I know I have Last Blade because I fucking love Last Blade.
7653000	7659000	But it'll be really cool to see those and I won't have to dig out my system to play it. So there you go.
7659000	7662000	All right. Lots of good retro stuff there.
7662000	7671000	All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some things that are coming out a little sooner than that Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection.
7671000	7675000	World release dates. Let's start with Loki in the US.
7675000	7681000	So we've got Curse of the Dead Gods on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7681000	7690000	Horned Knight on PlayStation 4, Persona 5 Strikers on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
7690000	7697000	Rogue Heroes, Ruins of Tasos, and that's on PC and Nintendo Switch.
7697000	7703000	We Were Here series on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
7703000	7708000	Horn Knight also coming to Xbox One.
7708000	7713000	We've got Cotton Reboot on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
7713000	7719000	Darius Cosmic Revelation on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
7719000	7722000	Forward to the Sky on Nintendo Switch.
7722000	7726000	Ghosts and Goblins Resurrection on Nintendo Switch.
7726000	7728000	Hellpoint on Nintendo Switch.
7728000	7731000	Wrath of the Aeon of Ruin.
7731000	7733000	We've got that on PC, Mac and Linux.
7733000	7735000	Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7735000	7745000	Yakuza Like a Dragon on PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X, which is weird because I swear to God that was already there and I already have it.
7745000	7749000	But apparently maybe a different version of that's coming out.
7749000	7754000	Bravely Default 2 on Nintendo Switch.
7754000	7757000	And let's see.
7757000	7763000	And finally, Horned Knight also coming out on PC and Nintendo Switch.
7763000	7765000	I like how they staggered out throughout the week.
7765000	7767000	And the Yakuza Like a Dragon thing, that's confusing.
7767000	7769000	Oh, that's for Japan.
7769000	7770000	All right.
7770000	7773000	Which is weird. You would think they would have already have that.
7773000	7776000	Well, let's get to the Japanese release dates.
7776000	7779000	Yeah, it's a busy week in Japan this week. There's a lot of stuff coming out.
7779000	7782000	A lot of overlap with some of the things Loki just mentioned.
7782000	7785000	On the Switch, Darius Cosmic Revolution comes out.
7785000	7787000	One Step from Eden is also out this week.
7787000	7791000	Code Realize Wintertide Miracles in a regular and limited edition.
7791000	7794000	The Cotton Reboot in a regular and limited edition.
7794000	7797000	And yes, that's the same Cotton series that Dark Soccer has brought up a lot.
7797000	7798000	So it looks like a new game in the series.
7798000	7800000	It's got the X68000 version in it.
7800000	7801000	Oh, that's pretty cool.
7801000	7803000	That makes me so freaking happy.
7803000	7805000	I love Cotton.
7805000	7806000	You might have to pick that up.
7806000	7807000	All right.
7807000	7808000	No, it's on my list to pick up.
7808000	7812000	If you're going to buy a physical copy, though, it's through Strictly Limited Games.
7812000	7814000	Got it.
7814000	7818000	Also on the Switch, Forward to the Sky in a regular and limited edition.
7818000	7819000	The Legend of Heroes.
7819000	7822000	Story of Seasons, Pioneers of Olive Town.
7822000	7826000	And Kineiro Lovereach comes out.
7826000	7828000	And Jinky Resurrection.
7828000	7830000	That is just the Switch.
7830000	7832000	Going to the PlayStation 5.
7832000	7836000	Nothing this week in Japan, so it's a quiet week on the PlayStation 5.
7836000	7839000	Let me check the PlayStation 4, though.
7839000	7840000	Yeah, a lot of overlap there.
7840000	7842000	The Cotton Reboot is out on PS4.
7842000	7844000	Darius Cosmic Revelation.
7844000	7848000	There's a Kemco RPG selection, Volume 6.
7848000	7852000	So yet another bundled collection of old RPGs in Kemco.
7852000	7860000	This includes Dragon Lapis, Lost Dragon, Alfadia Genesis, and Azdivine Kamura are all in that collection.
7860000	7863000	We don't get any of those over here, I don't think.
7863000	7866000	And then Jinky Resurrection.
7866000	7869000	Kineiro Lovereach is out as well.
7869000	7870000	Empire of Sin.
7870000	7873000	Yeah, busy week in Japan.
7873000	7874000	Lots of releases.
7874000	7876000	How about the UK, Dark Soccer?
7876000	7877000	A few things.
7877000	7880000	On the 23rd, we have Persona 5 Strikers.
7880000	7884000	We have Werewolf the Apocalypse, Earthblood.
7884000	7888000	On the 25th, we have On the Road Truck Simulator.
7888000	7890000	The Catch, Carp, and Course.
7890000	7893000	On the 26th, Vetronom.
7893000	7894000	That's on Switch.
7894000	7897000	Evoland, a Legendary Edition.
7897000	7899000	Aeternium X.
7899000	7903000	Dex, made of Scar, S-K-E-R.
7903000	7905000	Bravely Default 2.
7905000	7908000	Hellpoint Theme Park Simulator.
7908000	7912000	Balbabs Mausoleum, and Do Not Feed the Monkeys.
7915000	7916000	Alright.
7916000	7927000	Let's move on, and we will get a few more headlines for you guys before we get to the listener roundtable and the mailbag, which I think we have one extremely short email tonight.
7927000	7930000	We'll see, though. I'll have Dark Soccer check that out.
7930000	7931000	Alright, meanwhile.
7931000	7933000	Loki, what do you have for us?
7933000	7943000	So apparently, the Grand Theft Auto 3 and Grand Theft Auto Vice City games have had their source code revealed, or just say reverse engineered.
7943000	7949000	So there's been a team that's been working on that for quite a while, and they finally have taken care of that.
7949000	7956000	With that now, they've been able to port the games to several different platforms, including the Nintendo Switch.
7956000	7963000	Also, the Vita and Wii U, and so basically running those natively instead of via emulation.
7963000	7970000	Also, it's been ported to the PC, and then they're working on getting ported the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
7970000	7985000	Along with that, though, of course, in typical fashion, Take-Two has filed a DMCA takedown notice to GitHub to remove the reverse engineered games.
7986000	7991000	I thought reverse engineering was legal, but they did the same thing with Mario 64 as well.
7991000	7997000	But it's already on the internet, so it's always on the internet. It'll never go away. It's too late.
8001000	8007000	That's pretty scary, though, that these games get their source code reverse engineered. What are they going to do next?
8008000	8018000	I don't know, but it's interesting to see what they've been able to do with this.
8018000	8026000	I'm curious to see what kind of upgrades we're going to get with these, because I know with Mario 64, people have added ray tracing into it, and all sorts of craziness.
8026000	8029000	It'll be interesting to see what they do with this.
8030000	8038000	One game that just doesn't stop getting updated is No Man's Sky. Of course, this is a game I've talked fondly about on this show before.
8038000	8044000	It's a game I've really enjoyed, especially because they've really transformed it from what it was when it originally released.
8044000	8049000	Now they've put out yet another update, and this update is all about companions.
8049000	8059000	Now you can befriend the little alien creatures on the planet. Before, you could at least feed them and ride them around on the planet a little bit.
8059000	8070000	Now you can go even further. The alien creatures that you meet, you can actually turn them into companions that will join you, I believe, off the planet as well.
8070000	8076000	You don't just screenshot them and go to the next planet. You actually have them accompany you.
8076000	8087000	You can train them to aid in exploration. You can have them find specific resources, provide light, find settlements, or even hunt some of the dangerous creatures.
8087000	8095000	They can basically be your bitch in fighting some of the dangerous creatures on the planet, so it's a lot of stuff.
8095000	8102000	That just all came out for No Man's Sky, and like all the other updates, it's been free. Just another patch for the game.
8102000	8111000	So, yet more to explore. Another reason for me to start from scratch. Can't wait. Alright. Moving on, DarkSakura.
8112000	8120000	Well, Bungie got themselves in some hot water for Destiny 2 Beyond Light's Season of the Chosen.
8120000	8138000	They had a phrase being used in it that actually goes back to a slogan used in Nazi Germany, which I'll go ahead and say what it is, blood and honor.
8138000	8152000	And they thought it would work for the game, and a lot of people were really, really put off by it.
8152000	8160000	So, yeah, they apologized for it. They immediately did that and removed it from the game.
8160000	8168000	Serious question. Don't the orcs in Warcraft say something like that too? I thought they did. I could be wrong.
8168000	8176000	And I think there was something that this was in tandem with in Destiny 2 where the optics were really not good.
8176000	8180000	It was on a completion banner.
8180000	8192000	Yeah, and it had to do with something else called the cleansing, where the optics of that was really, I mean, I'm sure they just made a horrible mistake.
8192000	8196000	But, yeah, that's just, yeah.
8196000	8208000	As SjoernerMatt says, someone didn't do their homework when they came up with it. At least they fixed it and didn't try to be all like, well, it wasn't what, you know, they just, it was pointed out.
8208000	8221000	It was fixed. Yeah, no, I don't, I really don't think it was done on purpose, but I think that people still need to be better educated on history in general.
8221000	8231000	So that's a good point. If they didn't know anything about, they did this because they were ignorant to the situation and education would have helped prevent that.
8231000	8240000	True, true, very true. All right, let's move on just a couple more stories before we get to the roundtable. But first, a story from Loki.
8240000	8254000	Yeah, I don't know why I didn't think of this myself, but apparently there's a developer that's out there that tried to put out some games on Steam, one of these being Emoji Evolution.
8254000	8266000	And they decided to name their company on Steam as Very Positive. So, you know, the developer name happens to appear right above the review scores.
8266000	8278000	And so you may see Very Positive and think, oh, Very Positive Reviews. But no, that's not the case. It's just that's the name of the actual, the company is Very Positive.
8278000	8286000	And Valve was not too keen about them trying to be tricky like that. And so they banned them off Steam.
8286000	8300000	Did they prove that it was, I'm kind of team Very Positive on this. Like this is Valve's, why does it, why is it so easy to just put a name there? It's that's kind of Valve's bad design.
8300000	8314000	Like, yeah, I'm not sure I am totally with the whole like, yeah, get them off of Steam. They exploited it. Maybe they wanted to name their company Very Positive Games. What's wrong with that? That's Steam's fault.
8314000	8324000	Yeah. And according to the developer, they said Valve fully understands how minor this trick is. It's more important to have a famous brand name like Obsidian there.
8324000	8336000	They didn't think that there was actually going to be an issue with naming it that, but they said that they banned them due to review manipulations was the reasoning.
8336000	8346000	So, yeah, I don't know. I mean, it's just interesting.
8347000	8356000	It's like how when my siblings were doing video reports for school, they ended with, this has been an A plus production. Perfect.
8357000	8372000	And ironically, ironically, though, like, so very, it's very positive, you know, this emoji evolution game, you know, even though I was kind of dogging on it, has mostly positive reviews, which is kind of funny.
8373000	8386000	But I don't know, apparently they thought is, you know, it got pointed out. So, you know, maybe they could change it to Mostly Positive Games or something like that instead of just very positive as the name of the studio.
8386000	8401000	Seriously, very positive. I don't know. Anyway. All right. Well, something I'm not sure I'm meeting with positive thoughts is this news that Fortnite is now getting more characters, this time from Street Fighter.
8402000	8405000	That's right. Favorites Ryu.
8405000	8406000	My heart's broken.
8406000	8407000	Favorites Ryu.
8407000	8408000	Skins.
8408000	8424000	And Chun-Li are joining the Fortnite item shop so that you can dress your character like Chun-Li or Ryu. You know, since Chun-Li isn't going to be in Mortal Kombat at all, which by the way, I'll just quickly say on that article, that website knew exactly what it was doing.
8424000	8437000	And every time you share that article, you're buying into it. That's all I'm going to say. There's, and I'm not saying that makes it right. That's just some of the like garbage stuff that makes the internet so broken right now.
8437000	8448000	But I must say that website knows exactly what was doing that story. That was that was not somebody. If you actually kind of go through and read the article, there's coded little gags in it where they actually talk about.
8449000	8460000	It's the biggest street fighting championship when they're talking about Mortal Kombat. Like there's there's all sorts of code in it where they knew damn well what they were doing by getting gamers to rage retweet that.
8460000	8472000	So stop and think about that a little bit next time again. And I'm not perfect with this. I have to remind myself, there's been articles I've retweeted that I probably shouldn't have. But I let things like this be a little bit of a lesson.
8472000	8483000	Anyway, sorry, I had to do that quick aside because it of course, the doc of Chun Li doesn't just bring to mind a great Nicki Minaj song, but it also brings to mind this article that was out there last week.
8483000	8501000	Anyhow, Chun Li in all her glory and Ryu will be coming to Fortnite. And yeah, I mean, it's not the first time we've had gamer characters from other games in Fortnite. Kratos, of course, and Master Chief, both already in Fortnite when the PS5 got their version and the Xbox Series X got their version.
8502000	8504000	And so on. So.
8504000	8506000	And that's not all, right?
8506000	8508000	Oh, did I miss something?
8508000	8509000	Yes.
8509000	8510000	Go ahead.
8510000	8511000	So you know what else is coming to Fortnite?
8511000	8512000	Oh, no.
8512000	8513000	This might get your attention a little bit more.
8513000	8515000	Yeah, I heard. Okay. Yeah, go ahead.
8515000	8517000	Tron outfits.
8517000	8526000	Yeah. That was that was in last week's news. I thought I had mentioned at some point. But yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Tron is coming as well. And I just kind of let out this big sigh.
8526000	8531000	I think the sigh that Dark Soccer just put out, I've kind of matched that with the Tron news.
8531000	8533000	Yeah.
8533000	8537000	All right. Whatever. It's what the kids are into. You know what?
8537000	8548000	You know what? I'm going to I'm going to just suck it up and take the high road if it gets one more kid out there to want to watch the Tron movies.
8548000	8554000	And I would say really the old one. But you know what? The new one's great, too. The newer one is great, too. The one from 2010, Tron legacy.
8554000	8561000	If it gets more kids to watch those movies, you know what? Okay. Okay. I'll accept it.
8561000	8567000	So. All right. S2100 Matt says apparently Peter Griffin is coming as well. Is it for real?
8567000	8568000	No one cares.
8568000	8571000	That would be hilarious.
8571000	8573000	Fortnite is a very interesting pop culture blender.
8573000	8575000	I would totally watch that.
8575000	8579000	I want Beavis and Butthead at this point. Why not put parody and parody?
8579000	8582000	All right. Yes, absolutely.
8582000	8587000	All right. That is it for the news that we have scheduled. How about the roundtable?
8587000	8593000	I'd like to open it up to our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network for any questions that they might have.
8593000	8599000	But also open it up to our email every week. We invite your emails at participate at orange lounge radio dot com.
8599000	8603000	And we'd like to read our favorites here on the air. How many do we have tonight?
8603000	8608000	Dark soccer one. It's it's and it's it's you read it in one breath, but that's okay.
8608000	8611000	I actually actually I love the question. So let's get to it.
8611000	8615000	Well, it's one that's definitely going to send me on a journey.
8615000	8621000	I'm excited. So what is the best video game font? And this comes from D.
8621000	8626000	You forgot where D is from Waterloo. I was defeated.
8626000	8629000	You won the war. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
8630000	8634000	I have to. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not sorry, but I'm sorry. All right.
8634000	8639000	So, OK, D, I actually I actually legit love this question, though.
8639000	8643000	And dark soccer, you are the one who, you know, went to school for this.
8643000	8647000	So, of course, I'm going to start with you. What is the best video game font or what?
8647000	8651000	I'm sorry. What what video game has the best font? I think was the question.
8651000	8655000	Well, see, this is still loaded question because a lot of video games will use multiple typefaces.
8655000	8660000	There's title faces. There's in-game dialog faces. There's all kinds of things.
8660000	8666000	Now, one of my favorite dialog faces is called Humming.
8666000	8671000	And it is the typeface that has been used in the Animal Crossing series.
8671000	8677000	I think since Wild World, I want to say. And I actually have this fun.
8677000	8683000	I mean, it's a legit, you know, real typeface. And it's it's really beautiful to type with, really beautiful to lay out with.
8683000	8690000	I really enjoy that one. The title font that they use is.
8690000	8697000	It's very similar or maybe a modification of one called Think Heavy, F-I-N-K,
8697000	8704000	and just has a lot of personality, but Think Heavy is a true type font.
8704000	8712000	Still, they're charging for it. So as far as other ones, like for titles,
8712000	8721000	some of them are just like so fucking generic, you know, like I like the the PlayStation font,
8721000	8727000	but there are some games that will do like the movie thing and try to go with like Trajan,
8727000	8734000	which is on like the cover of almost every I'd say movie from before five years ago,
8734000	8739000	I would say there's actually a video on YouTube called Trajan is the movie font.
8739000	8745000	But I like when they go with something that isn't too generic, like I like a Helvetica,
8745000	8748000	but I like when they do something that's got a little bit more personality to it.
8748000	8755000	You know, that's why I've always really liked the the the humming font for Animal Crossing.
8755000	8759000	I just always have thought it was a really enjoyable font to use.
8759000	8764000	So this is to say, you know, whenever you bring up fonts, somebody is going to make a joke.
8764000	8767000	And Phoenix 7726, of course, says Comic Sans.
8767000	8770000	But let me ask this question. I ignored it on purpose.
8770000	8775000	Has any video game actually tried to use Comic Sans or Papyrus?
8775000	8777000	Not to my knowledge, at least.
8777000	8781000	Well, I'm sure indie games have, but like published games, I don't think they have.
8781000	8783000	I don't know. Off the top of my head.
8783000	8791000	Oh, Pixelbook says The Sims used Comic Sans and Undertale had a character named Sans and Papyrus.
8791000	8793000	Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.
8793000	8798000	But Capcom's font is ITC Corinna, K-O-R-I-N-N-A.
8798000	8801000	I've always liked Fares.
8801000	8812000	There's also Eurostyle, which is one that the VOG font is based out of, was used in a few different games, too.
8812000	8819000	There's also the Mega Drive font that Sega used was Corporate IMG.
8819000	8824000	I was just saying, because you're getting into where my answer to this question would go,
8824000	8830000	is like, I don't necessarily think of just one game, but there's something about, especially in the classic 8-bit era,
8830000	8834000	there were a lot of games that shared fonts, usually from the same company.
8834000	8837000	For example, you play Konami games back in the day.
8837000	8842000	Whether it was Simon's Quest, whether it was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, whether it was Metal Gear,
8842000	8845000	they all used like the same font.
8845000	8852000	Capcom games all shared the same font in the 8-bit era, and I think Tecmo had a very unique font
8852000	8857000	that was very representative of, like, you're playing a Tecmo game when you see this.
8857000	8865000	There's one in particular, though, that's been used by many games, both Japanese and English, called Cartoon 12.
8865000	8872000	Cartoon 12 is a bitmap font that was designed by Steve Capps, his Apple programmer,
8872000	8876000	first used in the Mac game through the Looking Glass in 1984.
8876000	8880000	It was never officially released. There were shareware versions of it,
8880000	8888000	and then there was a version in DOS Deluxe Paint 2 by EA, where it was just called Comix, C-O-M-I-X,
8888000	8892000	and it's been used in, actually it was used in Mortal Kombat.
8892000	8899000	It was used in Puyo Puyo, I think Puyo Puyo Pocket.
8899000	8906000	I'm just trying to think of a few other games, I mean a bunch of games fucking used it.
8906000	8916000	I'm trying to think of, yeah, actually I think that the handheld versions of Samurai Shodown used it, I think.
8916000	8920000	Some of the Disney games used it.
8920000	8931000	The Qbert logo was done in Cooper Black, which Cooper's like the font that they would always use on the back of team jerseys,
8931000	8934000	like the FamA team jerseys.
8934000	8939000	The Othello font was used for the Famicom Disk System.
8939000	8946000	I'm trying to think what else, I mean there's like a few regular fonts that you'd see in the last stuff,
8946000	8953000	like Coleco used Optima for their video game system.
8953000	8959000	Optima is another one that I love using, but it's kind of an expensive one if you're just going to go flat out and buy it.
8959000	8968000	Overwatch used Futura in some of their text on there, which is a font that I lay out stuff in all the time.
8969000	8974000	Obviously, again, Darcyra, I knew you would have a lot to say on this question because there's a lot of different,
8974000	8979000	you've kind of really studied a lot of this stuff, but I actually want to check in with Loki real quick on this question,
8979000	8985000	see if you have an answer, but I want to ask a second part for you, Loki, because we're talking about all these companies that have used stuff.
8985000	8993000	Well, now you get to speak from the perspective of Game Designer, and I'm curious, how did you choose the look for Pixel Poops number two?
8993000	8999000	And because obviously you do have things like in the interface, you know, in a certain font, how did you pick that?
8999000	9005000	So two-parter, do you have any, you know, again for the emailer, do you have any favorite fonts yourself?
9005000	9008000	But how did you pick what you would go with for Pixel Poops 2, Loki?
9008000	9013000	I just was looking at arcade fonts and I made something kind of similar to that.
9013000	9022000	As far as, yeah, there wasn't really much choice because it's an 8x8 font, so you're kind of limited to what you can do with 8x8.
9022000	9023000	True.
9023000	9031000	I'd say my favorite one is probably, I don't know what the actual font name is called, but it's Pricedown.
9031000	9036000	It's the Grand Theft Auto logo or the Price is Right logo.
9036000	9038000	Oh, okay.
9038000	9040000	Yeah, that'd be my favorite.
9040000	9044000	I never, it never really clicked for me that those two things use the same font, but you're right.
9044000	9047000	The Price is Right and Grand Theft Auto are like in the same font.
9047000	9048000	Yeah.
9048000	9049000	It's funny.
9049000	9050000	Okay.
9050000	9052000	Sorry, Dark Soccer, but I had to get, I had to get that perspective too.
9052000	9061000	But any, any other little information nuggets for our emailer?
9061000	9075000	I'm still a big fan of Carina, but that one also has a lot of history for it because the, the original type version was invented in 1904 and Capcom has been using it for some time.
9075000	9088000	Ooh, I know what's iconic and I don't know what the font is, but it's iconic is the font that Activision used on all of their Atari 2600 games, not the games themselves, but the box art.
9088000	9091000	The box art all had the title in this very bold font.
9091000	9099000	The cartridge labels were all in the same font and like in a very, like it was like always like white text on a very colorful background.
9099000	9104000	So if you had them all like stacked up on the shelves, like you knew these are the Activision games because they all look similar.
9104000	9111000	I mean, the Atari games had a font too, but they didn't look as good cause they always put like dark on dark, but the Activision stuff really stood out.
9111000	9120000	Um, it was, there's was a custom font, um, but it was modified from another one and for the life of me, I can't remember what it was.
9120000	9121000	That's okay.
9121000	9132000	We've given this emailer like way so much information, but I'd like, I knew this, it would spark this kind of discussion and like, I'm like, dang, that is a question no one's asked in 857 episodes.
9132000	9133000	So it's good job.
9133000	9135000	Like that's a really good question.
9135000	9136000	Oh yeah.
9136000	9138000	But no, there, that was a pretty classic one.
9138000	9141000	Gosh, I wish I could, I know people have done versions of it.
9141000	9142000	Yeah.
9142000	9144000	Um, probably at dafont or something.
9144000	9145000	Yeah.
9145000	9146000	Yeah.
9146000	9147000	But, um, but yeah.
9147000	9148000	All right.
9148000	9149000	All right.
9149000	9150000	Well, okay.
9150000	9161000	So for the record there, I just found a page called the game font database and it got apparently a lot of, uh, fonts used by different companies.
9161000	9162000	That's cool.
9162000	9163000	I'll link it in chat.
9163000	9164000	Nice.
9164000	9165000	All right.
9165000	9166000	Well, thanks for the email.
9166000	9170000	And if you can think of a good question, we haven't been asked in 857 episodes or you know what?
9170000	9171000	It's fine.
9171000	9174000	If you ask one that we got asked a hundred episodes ago, we probably won't remember.
9174000	9188000	Uh, send us an email, participate at, uh, orange lounge, radio.com and Phoenix 77 26 says dark soccer is a fountain of knowledge, but I'm bump.
9188000	9189000	You know what?
9189000	9190000	What?
9190000	9192000	I'm a typography nerd.
9192000	9194000	I like big fonts and I cannot lie.
9194000	9195000	All right.
9195000	9199000	Uh, but an ultra light's okay too.
9199000	9200000	Uh, all right.
9200000	9206000	Um, as the show and her mat says, how do you type with boxing gloves on your hands?
9206000	9208000	Very difficult, very difficultly.
9208000	9211000	You don't, uh, or with a very big keyboard.
9211000	9213000	It's a strong, bad thing.
9213000	9216000	Oh, that was a strong, bad thing.
9216000	9217000	Totally missed the reference.
9217000	9218000	Yeah.
9219000	9220000	All right.
9220000	9224000	Um, I think that is probably about it for everyone that we know.
9224000	9229000	We don't have any other emails and outside of that question, that was just a strong bag joke in disguise.
9229000	9231000	I didn't see any others pop up in chat.
9231000	9232000	You have a couple other minutes.
9232000	9240000	So if you have something you want to get out there, cause I will ask Loki if there are and dark soccer, if there's any other last minute stories they want to get into for tonight.
9240000	9241000	Not me.
9241000	9242000	Um, sure.
9242000	9256000	So apparently like, like a Phoenix rising from the ashes, uh, soldier boy has posted yet another game console concept on his Instagram.
9256000	9261000	I can only assume it's another Chinese clone console because it looks like a Chinese clone console.
9261000	9265000	So I guess we'll just have to wait and see until someone recognizes it.
9265000	9272000	But he claims it's a building, a brand new console from scratch, all new design, all new games, all new deals.
9272000	9276000	Let's make history girls like all the other ones.
9276000	9277000	Girls stop.
9277000	9278000	That's all I have to say about that ever happened.
9278000	9279000	Girls stop.
9279000	9282000	So yay.
9282000	9284000	Something to look forward to.
9284000	9287000	Um, Bobby Black Wolf is bringing up in chat by the way.
9287000	9289000	Did y'all cover that in television?
9289000	9292000	Amico got delayed from April to October.
9292000	9294000	It probably didn't hit any news sites.
9294000	9299000	Now from, well, I got the email cause I, I, I pre-ordered, bought, prepaid, whatever.
9299000	9306000	Uh, one of those, uh, now from April 3rd, 2021 or four, three, two, one, two, 10, 10, 21.
9306000	9307000	Yeah. Um, thanks for bringing it up.
9307000	9308000	You're right.
9308000	9315000	It didn't, it didn't make the show roll because honestly they just delayed it and that YouTube they put out was a lot.
9315000	9318000	Um, they didn't really show any games.
9318000	9325000	Um, I, I still think there's a market for the Amico and I think there's a lot of people dunking on it that, um, probably don't need to be.
9325000	9334000	Um, and I think there could be some really good stuff that I think a lot of, and I've told Aaron, he should look into or why we are, he should look into developing for Amico.
9334000	9343000	I don't know if anything ever came of that, but, um, and I don't know how kindly they would take to pixel poops, but obviously he's made other games like super multitasking and that stuff that would be great for it.
9343000	9352000	But that aside, I mean, and I would encourage not just, you know, why we are, but maybe other indie developers who are having a problem, maybe getting noticed on the steam marketplace.
9352000	9362000	Um, you know, say what you will about Amico and Intellivision, but you know, having a personality like Tommy Tallarico behind it knows how to kind of talk up and hype up the product.
9362000	9366000	So it could be, it could be a chance to, you know, get things seen.
9366000	9376000	Um, obviously the delay is disappointing, but I also kind of start to wonder because we've been seeing a lot of the same games and the footage for those.
9376000	9386000	I almost wonder if they had released 10, 10, 20, would they have had the games coming out to really carry them through the next year?
9386000	9393000	Maybe this is going to better position themselves, but I know, especially for being such a small company, the pandemic's probably hit them pretty hard in the development.
9393000	9406000	And of course, you know, obviously they're, they're having problems making PlayStation fives and series X's with all these chips, obviously, you know, it's not all the same chips, obviously, but they're going to have problems supply when it comes to the Amico.
9406000	9417000	So like, I get the delay from that perspective. I'm not an angry customer or anything. The pandemic has fucked everything and everyone. Like it's just, you know, things are going to get delayed.
9417000	9436000	I just hope it positions in television for longer success and the long game and a stream of newer games that come out because without it, that thing is going to, you know, it's, it's not going to do well if they don't continuously have new games to put out there and talk about in the news and all that stuff.
9437000	9448000	So, all right. Anyway, Bobby does say they've been showing new games every week on their YouTube channel. The only ones I've seen that ended up catching my eye break out, I've seen like three different times now.
9448000	9457000	And then there was that platformer game that was a revival of an old title where the whole trick was you flipped it from night to day and stuff.
9458000	9468000	I can't remember the name, but it looked cute, but it did look like a mobile phone game on your TV a little bit, but I don't know if that's necessarily a bad thing.
9468000	9479000	I know that sounds very sacrilegious, but one game we all never shut up about is Pokemon Go. That's a mobile phone game. Now, I wouldn't want to play that on my TV, but they make decent games.
9480000	9488000	They make decent games for the phone. Like that Sayonara Wild Hearts was started as a phone game and ended up on Switch and all this other stuff. So we'll see. We'll see.
9490000	9491000	Anyway, sorry. Go ahead, Loki.
9492000	9504000	No, I was going to say, I, while, yeah, that looks, it's all about the art style. Like, I don't know, I, the motion graphics stuff that they kind of do nowadays, you know, with kind of tweaking sprites.
9504000	9513000	Like I know the style that it looks, it's very much like a mobile game, especially when you're talking about advertisement stuff. It's all about really the gameplay though on those.
9513000	9530000	Um, and I haven't really seen a whole lot yet. They get me super excited about the, um, the new console, but yeah, I'd be curious to see how to develop for it, but I don't know whenever it would happen, if it would ever happen.
9531000	9541000	All right. Well, let's note the date and time. Loki said he's curious about developing for Amico. All right. Anyhow, any other last minute stories?
9542000	9543000	No, that's it.
9543000	9557000	All right. Then I think it is about time we end the show, but not before I thank all of you for tuning in tonight. Thank you for, uh, tuning into Orange Lounge Radio, whether you were here live at twitch.tv slash vog network, or you were listening on our podcast feed.
9557000	9570000	We appreciate you guys being here with us every week. Um, we, you don't have to give us money for, uh, I mean, but if you want to three via bits and subs or shopping in our shop over at vog network.com slash shop and buying some merch.
9570000	9579000	We would suit. We're not going to say no to that. We'd appreciate it, but all we really want is, uh, tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
9579000	9590000	But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, then what, what can we do? Um, speaking of shopping, kind of, I should give a shout out here for, um, the, on, on the Twitch channel.
9590000	9603000	Uh, when there's a stream going on, you can actually donate, uh, the vog points or the points on Twitch. You can actually donate right now to Bobby is trying to put on a VHS gaming tape stream.
9603000	9618000	So he found like a bunch of old tapes from the nineties. Um, and if we can get a hundred thousand points raised, which is, is, is not as hard as you think, um, he's gonna, uh, put those, uh, an air, some of the content from like old and stuff.
9618000	9630000	We're already up to 74 K. So, um, we're looking good. Um, if you click on the little icon that has the points, it looks like a little bubble, I guess next to the, you click on it.
9630000	9641000	And then like the very first option will say the gaming tape stream 23 days left, and then you can donate a, however many points you want a maximum of 200 points. So, Oh, you figured it out.
9641000	9653000	You figured it out. Loki now we're at 76,000. There you go. So, all right. Um, so hopefully look forward to that stream soon. So, and we're trying to come up with other ways that you guys can spend your points.
9653000	9663000	Uh, so stay tuned for all that good stuff as well. So, all right. Um, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts and I will go to dark Sakura for your final thought first.
9663000	9670000	Um, I am in one of those moods where I want to watch mid Samara again and drink.
9670000	9673000	That movie is great.
9673000	9677000	My, oh, go ahead. Loki. I'll have you go next.
9677000	9695000	Um, my final thought is I'm, I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do next. So I have a few ideas, but I may, I may actually just go back to working on a pixel poops number two and to get ready for the console version or the cartridge version of that.
9696000	9710000	All right. And my final thought, um, my mom's 80th birthday would have been this upcoming Tuesday. So obviously she's on my mind a lot this last week and honest, not just this last week but always, especially ever since she passed.
9710000	9722000	But just wanted to acknowledge that and just dedicate the work that I'm doing here on OLR tonight and pretty much every night to her memory. So that's it.
9722000	9737000	Um, I hope that doesn't end it on a downer though. It's not a downer. I'm actually trying to look at that as a very positive thing. So I hope you guys all have an amazing week and, uh, place a lot of games, um, and have a lot of fun online and, uh, don't go crazy though.
9737000	9747000	Okay. Cause those are real people that you're playing against and we'll see you in seven days to talk when it will be March again, but for real this time and we can talk all of, Oh no, I'm sorry.
9747000	9758000	Actually, I'm sorry. We have one more show because it'd be the 28th. So in two weeks we'd be in March. So next week we'll still be in February and we can think about how March is coming so quickly again, but this time in 2021.
9758000	9762000	Have a wonderful week, everybody. We'll see you in seven days. Good night.
