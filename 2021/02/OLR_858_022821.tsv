0	19000	Spin-off media is always weird, but what's weirder to me is that the Final Fantasy VII universe alone will soon have over one half as many games as the entire mainline Final Fantasy series itself.
19000	28000	And yes, every Final Fantasy VII Remake release will count as a different release, so tying or beating 15 is totally doable! Count the two movies and it's even closer!
28000	37000	Just how many Final Fantasy VII games are there? Join your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki for this information and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
41000	50000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.
50000	62000	We are live once again with our program. It is episode number 858 for this, the last day of February, the 28th of 2021. Sorry you'll have to wait for a leap year for a 29 day February.
62000	73000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined as always by my co-hosts. For the last just about coming up on one year, we've been taping over Discord like many folks have been doing.
73000	85000	Whether it be in their personal lives, professional lives, you've been doing some type of virtual recording and virtual meetings and virtual spaces, I'm sure. And we are no different, so say hello virtually to DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.
85000	86000	Hi.
86000	88000	Hi, how are you doing?
88000	93000	It's been a week, but I'm doing okay today. I had what I like to call a day of nothing.
93000	95000	I love days of nothing.
95000	97000	It's an empty day.
98000	107000	Yeah, an empty day. It's very good. Rest and relaxation days are the best. I took a random day off work this week because Tuesday would have been my mom's 80th birthday.
107000	117000	And I just know my brain would have been in a weird space had I tried to work. So I took a nothing day. And it was glorious. It really was.
118000	127000	My grandmother's yard side is coming up. So my maternal grandmother, the one who pretty much raised me. So I feel you there.
127000	143000	Yeah. It's good to take. You can take a time to remember, but also take time for yourself. Anyway, well, let me let me awkwardly switch topics here because something I wanted to ask you about as well at the top of the show here was about the news that came out this week about Fry's Electronics finally went under.
143000	151000	And I know that sounds really horrible when I'm like finally went under, but I don't know about you, Jamie, but I went to one like I think it was November of 2019.
151000	160000	It was a few months before all this pandemic stuff. And I walked in there going, oh, this is bad. Like this store is like half empty. This is real bad. This is not going to end well.
160000	169000	I'm actually shocked they held out this long. But what are your thoughts? Because I know you enjoyed the occasional trip to Fry's back in the day, too.
173000	182000	Okay, I think Jamie's computer might have frozen and sometimes this happens to us. I know she's been getting very frustrated with her system because sometimes it lags.
182000	190000	So I'm just going to skip ahead. Sometimes these tech issues happen. I know she'll join us back when she can. Let me go over to tech master Loki. Hi, Loki.
190000	191000	Hey.
191000	197000	Hey, and what are your thoughts on the whole Fry's thing since I didn't really get to ask Jamie, how are you doing with all that?
197000	211000	I'm kind of with you on that. Like it looked like they were already out of business like two years ago. So I'm not surprised. I'm kind of disappointed. I did like going around in Fry's and actually before that incredible universe when that was around.
211000	223000	I'm hoping I'm hoping that Micro Center moves in, but it's probably going to be more of like, you know, one of those Halloween stores instead.
224000	233000	Those buildings are so elaborate. Well, it depends. It depends on which one you go to. Right. Like, you know, and I also know this chain is a little more heavy on the West Coast.
233000	241000	Like I know Bobby was talking about one in the Atlanta area and I know there was one in Vegas and there's there's the occasional fries that are kind of scattered throughout the country.
241000	252000	But I think mainly it was a West Coast thing specifically like Silicon Valley. And I think that's why you're hearing a lot about it this week, because those stores, especially in like, you know, the San Jose area and all that stuff were quite legendary.
252000	260000	I think so. It's it is a loss for those of us in California, I think. But anyway, a lot of those stores had those very elaborate themes.
260000	266000	Not so much the one that used to be incredible universe here locally, but the one out in Roseville that they built.
266000	273000	What like ten years ago, it's not that old, is very elaborate with the train crashing through the building and all that stuff.
273000	277000	It's yeah, very nice. UFO one's kind of similar to that. Yeah.
277000	287000	The one I mean, like because I was going to Fry's back when I was a kid and back when that was the one in San Jose or maybe actually Milpitas, I think.
287000	295000	And back then it was just a warehouse. It was just a where just a bare warehouse with computer stuff.
295000	298000	Yeah. And that was great.
298000	302000	But then I know that one later became a thing like that, like Aztec theme or something like that.
302000	307000	But yeah, I mean, I enjoyed, you know, even incredible universe and stuff when it was here.
307000	312000	It's just so big in Fry's was awesome because, you know, I was super excited to have that come here.
312000	318000	One, I was used to going to the one in the Bay Area and just like kind of went downhill from there.
318000	323000	I mean, I get it like online and everything, you know, it's, you know, definitely competing.
323000	326000	But then again, you have like, you know, Micro Center that's doing just fine.
326000	336000	So it's like I from what I gather, like I even posted this a little bit on Twitter from the distribution site because they did carry games.
336000	341000	We always used to have vendors come out to our company and stuff and we'd have like mixers and stuff like that.
341000	347000	And you would hear them talking about Fry's and how they were a real pain to work with.
347000	360000	Just always trying to cut the costs like as low as possible and trying to like do all sorts of crazy consignment deals and stuff like that just sounded like a pain to work with.
360000	365000	And based on like they were having some issues with vendors and supply chain and stuff like that.
365000	369000	So I'm wondering if that sort of contributed towards all this.
369000	373000	But yeah, they've been hurting for a long time.
373000	379000	I'm going to chat for some comments. Tiger Claw on chat says, I know it can be disheartening when a store you had fond memories are going to close down.
379000	384000	And then the place it used to be becomes a different store, sometimes a local discount store or something.
384000	391000	Oh, yeah. The space that becomes the Halloween store or the space that becomes another Goodwill or 99 cent.
391000	396000	Those type of deal places are everywhere. You know, it's it is a little bit disheartening.
396000	401000	Sometimes, though, you get an upgrade once in a while, like especially like restaurant spaces.
401000	406000	You might actually get an upgrade. For example, over by the mall, Hooters closed down.
406000	411000	Right. And what took its place? Sizzler. I say upgrade.
411000	415000	Some some may argue with me, but I say upgrade.
415000	421000	Yeah, we had a barbecue place go in in the Hooters in Rancho here.
421000	427000	Oh, yeah. I don't know how good that barbecue place is, but I'm sure it's a step up from whatever with the Hooters was.
428000	432000	And sadly, I think the Sizzler's actually closed during this whole pandemic, too, because they've been having issues.
432000	435000	I think it's going to be a crab house to have a salad.
435000	441000	It's kind of hard to have like a buffet and salad bar during the pandemic. A little bit.
441000	446000	Yeah, I really do hope like a micro center or something comes in because I do like shopping at those places.
446000	450000	I get it. I could just order through like Amazon or Newegg or something like that.
450000	455000	And that does work sometimes. But sometimes you just want to be able to get it right away.
455000	459000	Like you ordered everything through Newegg and all that and it gets shipped to you and you're building it.
459000	464000	You're like, oh, dang, you know, I need a cord or I need a specialty cable or something.
464000	469000	And that was my quote. So I'm looking at chat because, again, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geese Network,
469000	475000	Twitch.TV slash VOG Network. That's VOG Network at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
475000	478000	And we do have a live chat where you can participate along with the show.
478000	484000	And we like to read some of your thoughts on air. And sometimes you guys end up steering the direction of the show.
484000	490000	So Pod Culture says, I miss old school RadioShacks and Tiger Claw says, yeah, we used to have a RadioShack here.
490000	496000	The place it used to be became a Boost Mobile store. I thought there was a thing with like Sprint and RadioShack.
496000	500000	But anyway, that's not actually what I want to get into. It's about the components.
500000	504000	Where are you going to go now when you need that type of, you know, drilling it down to those components?
504000	508000	Because RadioShack was a place to get.
509000	516000	That's where I used to go because I rather exactly rise than RadioShack because I had more of a selection and it wasn't a big old mess.
516000	525000	Bingo. And on top of that, like they also had all the Raspberry Pi stuff so you can get like, you know, Raspberry Pis and all the enclosures and everything for that.
525000	533000	So it was really nice. Plus they had like, you know, all sorts of things there. I used to get like all sorts of PC things that built PCs from there.
533000	538000	So where are you going to randomly find that shit now? Like you have to do it online? What if I don't want to wait for online?
538000	545000	I feel like there's a space. Best Pie doesn't really sell stuff that granular though, you know what I mean?
545000	549000	Like if I want to build my own computer, I'm going to have to do that online.
549000	554000	Now granted, Fry's has been kind of a crappy place to do that for a while, you know, as they've been slowly dying.
554000	560000	But anyway, I do want to also say this is something to point out. Fry's is also a grocery store.
560000	564000	I've seen that when I was visiting friends in Tucson, I saw Fry's grocery stores everywhere.
564000	570000	I believe they have roots in the same owners, but they are not the same thing otherwise. They're like two different companies.
570000	577000	I also ironically in the Bay Area when I used to live down there, I would shop at a Fry's grocery store.
577000	578000	Okay.
578000	585000	Which I think before that was an Alpha Beta too. That was, that's super old. But yeah, we used to have Fry's grocery stores as well.
585000	588000	And I want to say that the logos are almost pretty similar.
588000	589000	They're very similar. Yeah.
589000	594000	So yeah, I don't know if it's related, but it's a completely different story.
594000	600000	I think the owners are, I think like there, it's something tight. If somebody will have to read, cram the Wiki article really fast.
600000	606000	But there's a reason, you know how like the front of Fry's Electronics sells a lot of like nerd food type of thing?
606000	614000	Like, like they, like if you, you know how they had it set up where you were kind of like trapped in the line, the line waiting to get to the,
614000	625000	and they would have all that just crap food in the aisle and all the last minute buys, like all these candies, you know, import things like Ramune drinks and the other things that there's always,
625000	632000	I think that is actually tied to the grocery thing somehow. Like it's a similar distributor. So I think their roots are in similar places.
632000	636000	So it's just, it's, it's, but it's, they became two different companies or something.
636000	640000	Yeah. So I'm trying to see. And so, yeah.
640000	646000	Isn't this what you wanted to listen to our video game podcast about tonight? Well, unfortunately, Dark Soccer is having computer problems.
646000	652000	So I guess, I guess we're buying her a little time here, but we will move on here in a moment.
652000	654000	Loki's trying to cram the Wiki article.
654000	661000	Yeah. I'm trying to look here, see if it's related. I see that, you know, it's not owned by the same company.
661000	669000	So I think it was owned by Fred Meyer at one time. I think it's merged with like Kroger or something like that.
669000	673000	I don't think it's, yeah, necessarily.
673000	675000	I thought they had their roots in the same place.
675000	681000	The logo is exactly the same. So like, I can't imagine that it's, it's different.
681000	688000	All right. Well, forget it. Let's, let's move into other stuff. Actually, before we get into the official first topic I had for tonight,
688000	692000	a lot of folks in our chat are wondering about what is playing behind you tonight.
692000	697000	I recognize it, but do you want to explain? And again, we do have our podcast listeners.
697000	704000	They don't see anything, although of course we love you guys, you know, but, uh, tell us a little bit about this, this visual that's behind you tonight.
704000	708000	Uh, this is a classic DOS game, uh, Scorched Earth.
708000	719000	So it's a, it's a tank combat game where you have to put in your angle and velocity as well as select weapons to destroy other AI controlled or player controlled tanks.
719000	725000	So like super old. Um, but that's an excellent game.
725000	731000	Okay. Yes. One of my favorites. Like worms, but before worms before that.
731000	736000	Yeah. I think we did it as a classic game. Not that long ago. It was during this whole pandemic era.
736000	743000	So yeah, we talked a lot about it, but I couldn't tell you the episode number, but we have that lovely Wiki that our fans take care of.
743000	749000	I've, I don't think I've ever made an edit on that Wiki that I know of maybe like a small thing, but our fans take care of that Wiki.
749000	753000	And, uh, you can go figure out what episode number Scorched Earth was on. Cause I know we did it.
753000	758000	Or did we do Tank Wars? The other one, one of the two, maybe both. I don't know.
758000	765000	Oh, well forget it. I think we, I think we had to be Scorched Earth. All right. Who cares? We got to move on.
765000	772000	Let's talk about our first topic tonight. Uh, I wanted to talk about, okay. So sorry to go back to Fry's Electronics.
772000	782000	It was owned by the same guy, Charlie Charles Fry. He sold the supermarket chain, uh, to Dylan's back in 1972.
782000	789000	It was split for a long time. Okay. So yeah. Okay. All right. I'm glad we have that settled.
789000	795000	That's why I thought I'd like, like they, they, they were on the same path and then they like diverted, I thought was the thing.
795000	807000	And one became the electronics and the other became the grocery. Okay. Now that we have that settled, can we talk about something that's a little younger, um, than, uh, the roots of Fry's Electronics?
807000	826000	But, um, it's still something that's hit a milestone, uh, this week, namely yesterday, the Pokemon series turned 25 years old as they celebrated the release of Pokemon Red and Pokemon Green, um, in Japan, which of course was changed for us to Pokemon Red and Pokemon Blue for reasons and things.
826000	843000	Um, so the whole series has turned 25 and obviously the Pokemon folks did some celebration stuff over the weekend, namely that big concert they were hyping, that digital Post Malone concert where Post Malone covered Hootie and the Blowfish as the Pokemon song.
843000	862000	Which it wasn't bad, but it's definitely one of those like things I didn't guess 2021 had in store for 500 Alex. Like I didn't like, it's just one of those, like, like I think I saw a tweet even that said Post Malone covers Hootie and the Blowfish for Pokemon 25th anniversary.
862000	879000	And the response said this tweet only got more and more wild the more I read it, like the more it goes on, seriously. But anyway, they were doing that, you know, celebration thing, uh, for that. And, um, then of course there was a big direct that happened where they had some pretty big announcements.
879000	888000	Before we talk about the direct, I want to talk about, you know, last week we talked a little bit about Zelda as a franchise turning 35 and kind of what that series has meant for us.
888000	901000	So I'm curious if you have any Pokemon memories. I'm bummed Jamie's not back with us yet, so I can't ask her, but Loki, do you have any Pokemon franchise memories or series memories you'd like to kind of get into and share?
901000	914000	Not really, cause I didn't really get into Pokemon until much later. I mean, and even then it's kind of been, you know, lukewarm, I guess. Um, really, I mean, Pokemon Go, I think is probably the most notable thing.
914000	925000	Uh, really the only like Pokemon game I've played is just Pokemon Let's Go. Um, yeah, I mean, it really wasn't too involved in Pokemon.
925000	934000	Um, I will say that when Pokemon first came out, I was in college and I was, well first came out in the States cause you know, it was a couple of years behind in the States.
934000	945000	Um, but I really got into the anime. My friends and I would watch the, the stinking anime. I had like DVDs. I think I still have some over here of like some of the early episodes of Pokemon.
945000	953000	And we used to watch like the whole like first season anime, but we never, I never super got into the games because I was not a huge Game Boy person.
954000	966000	And so I, I feel like I bought Pokemon yellow. I remember I bought a Game Boy color that was like when you turned it on, it was Pikachu's cheek that turned red. Like that whole thing. It was like a Pikachu Game Boy color or something.
966000	978000	I had that and I remembered playing a little bit of Pokemon on that, but I always had a hard time with the grind of the series. Um, I feel like I almost, I probably bought one of them from like every generation.
978000	992000	But in classic Rob style, I never got very far in them until this most recent one, Sword and Shield, I finally beat. Uh, and it's like the first mainline. It's actually my favorite mainline game. I know as controversial as that one's been, it's the one that really hooked me in.
992000	1004000	I thought there was just a lot of quality of life improvements that really made it a lot of fun to play. Um, and now it's making me a little bit excited about, you know, getting to revisit some of these older games, uh, through remakes and you know, whatever else.
1004000	1016000	I know there was that rumor about a Switch, um, kind of like the first couple generations coming out in some type of, it appears that's not happening now because we didn't, we would have heard about that in the Pokemon Direct, but that would have been very exciting.
1016000	1031000	Uh, like you, Pokemon Go has been huge. I kind of couldn't believe it when I first heard about it, having been playing Ingress for a year or two before they announced that. And then, uh, but Pokemon Go is a heck of a lot of fun and a good way to introduce people to the franchise as well. For sure.
1031000	1047000	I'm surprised we didn't have another Let's Go game. Like I get, you know, the diamond and, um, with the diamond pearl that they have coming out, um, sort of kind of resemble that art style, but it's not quite actually, oddly enough, it actually looks worse.
1047000	1058000	I kind of prefer the art style of Let's Go. Um, uh, I don't know why they just didn't do that. Like just put it in that art style. Like it looks really weird.
1058000	1064000	All right. Well, let's, let's talk about what they announced at the Direct then, since we're kind of leading into that. So the, go ahead.
1064000	1073000	Brilliant diamond. And, uh, we had, so we have a brilliant diamond and shining Pearl. There are going to be remakes of diamond and Pearl obviously, and they are being ported to the Switch.
1073000	1089000	Um, actually, now that I look at our cell, it doesn't look that bad. There's another one that's looked at maybe is the overworld art. That's not so great. Um, but yeah, it's supposed to be a remake and they have like a Chidi, a Chibi three art style for the top down part of the world.
1089000	1093000	That's the problem. That's, that's the thing that I didn't necessarily care for.
1093000	1102000	Yeah, the game looks okay. I see Shane is in chat and obviously he's been talking to me a lot about this and I know he's not really into the art style either. He's very, I'm upset with it.
1102000	1113000	Shane, if you want to state your perspective, join discord and I'll bring you into the private channel if you have a way to talk to us. Um, and, uh, but I, I didn't, I didn't hate the look of it.
1113000	1130000	Like I kind of get what they're trying to do. Like they're trying to do a 3d style of what the older game look like. And you know, I get for some people it's kind of a misfire because I think they were really expecting and they'd set that bar for generation four to be done within the sword and shield engine.
1130000	1144000	And this does appear to be a bit of a downgrade on that, but I don't, I don't hate it. Um, I'm more excited about the fact that like it should, it better tie into like Pokemon home and it'll be a good way to play into all of that as well.
1144000	1149000	Okay. I see Shane did join the channel and wants to have his say so. Hi Shane, how are you?
1149000	1152000	I'm fine. This just gets me out of doing more homework.
1152000	1171000	It's fine. So I'm sure. Okay. So dark soccer is having computer problems tonight, so I'm happy to have you fill in for a little bit. Tell us what is the problem you're having as a, and if you guys don't know Shane, he's been around the network and OLR for a very long time and is definitely our hardcore Pokemon fan of the bunch.
1171000	1182000	Uh, just, just for anybody who's new to OLR, let us reemphasize what a hardcore fan you are. Shane, how many copies of Pokemon's eighth generation do you own?
1182000	1189000	Um, hold on, I got to count digital. Probably eight.
1189000	1195000	Eight. And why do you need eight copies, which would be like four swords and four shields. Why do you need eight copies?
1196000	1206000	Because I do. I have a whole bunch of switches. They all have to be played at the same time. And if I don't have multiple copies, how can I play them all at the same time?
1206000	1212000	All right. That dude in Japan playing Pokemon go with the giant like array. Yeah, basically. Yeah.
1212000	1223000	That's the other thing about Shane that cracks me up is he has this love hate relationship with Pokemon go where he's like, like when the game first came out, you were like super into it. And then you got so much more fun.
1223000	1236000	You got really mad when they changed the radar and you quit and you're like, it's a garbage game. And then of course, after like three months, you came back and you do this whole like love hate thing where you like, you're like, Pokemon go is garbage. I'm never playing it again. Then three months, they do something and you're like, okay, I'm playing again.
1236000	1251000	So it's like, Oh, there's a shiny I can get that I like, okay, I gotta start playing it. Oh, sure. What's in the game? Oh, my gosh, I gotta play well. And now to be fair, because of Pokemon home like Pokemon go has a very legit purpose here.
1251000	1264000	For example, like the shiny mew, even though that quest is a royal pain in the ass and Pokemon go, like as I understand it, Shane, correct me if I'm wrong, I know you will. But shiny mew is not obtainable in the main game unless you hack or something.
1264000	1278000	It's not obtainable legitimately in the mainline games right now. But there is a purpose to get this and Pokemon go and bring it into the mainline games. You will have a legitimate shiny mew for your mainly except I don't think you can send.
1279000	1299000	Mythic Pokemon to the bay or no, I guess you can because I think there. Okay, nevermind. Yeah, yeah. And I that was the only way I could get a shiny Genesect was by playing go. So I did that. And so now my sword and shield has shiny Genesect just kind of hovering about behind me. Okay.
1299000	1324000	He's awesome. All right. So what's your take on this Gen four announcement? And why are you a little more sour on it? Okay, so first of all, sorry, I don't like Gen four Gen four was not great. Heart gold, soul silver, fine. Platinum was pretty good. Diamond and Pearl suck. So, um, and it's not because of the Pokemon, it's just the game is not fun.
1325000	1353000	Mm hmm. And so, like, I was kind of going into half excited for these anyway. But every time they've done a remake, it's been kind of the same art style as the current generation. So when you had fire and leaf green, it looked very similar to Ruby Sapphire, when you had heart gold, soul silver looked like Diamond Pearl, and, you know, Omega Ruby off Sapphire had that look of X and Y still.
1353000	1382000	But this time, like, I don't know, they're trying. It's not game freak that's making it. It's a different company. It's the people that actually make Pokemon home. And they just went with like, a weird chibi 3d version of the game. They didn't try to make really, it doesn't look to me at least like they made any attempt to upgrade it,
1382000	1391000	or God, I would like, look, he was saying, I take a Let's Go game at this point. And that was like, my worst fear was it was going to be a Let's Go game.
1391000	1396000	Yeah, you were not having it. You were not happy to hear it might be like a Let's Go type of thing.
1396000	1424000	Yeah, and it we're in a weird situation where I wish that's what happened. I honestly, if they could change the overworld character models, I would be a little bit better. But this looks like a bad cell phone game rip off. That's what it looks like to me. It's just the colors are weird, everything. There's no life to it. It's just very much.
1426000	1441000	Trash. Okay. And just a real quick note for those that are live with us. Sorry for the awkward shot on the Twitch, but I was not prepared to have an extra host tonight. Joining us for a little bit but I also see the dark soccer is back. Hooray.
1441000	1456000	So, okay, we're just talking about Pokemon I'm getting obviously I had to go to the expert to talk about Pokemon. Okay, so I know you're a little more excited about this other announcement though so let me let Loki talk about it first as usually does.
1456000	1462000	Yeah, so they have this other game called Pokemon legends are Arceus.
1462000	1463000	Okay.
1463000	1473000	Arceus. Yeah, I don't know how you pronounce it. It depends on what like region you're in it's Arceus here Arceus in Japan. Okay, well we'll say Arceus then.
1474000	1492000	And it's basically kind of the Sinnoh region, but, you know, a long long time ago. So it's like the first generation, I don't know if it's the first generation of Pokemon trainers or whatever but it takes place a long time in the past, and the game is set up like very
1492000	1506000	open world, almost resembles Breath of the Wild a bit which has been concerned considering the last game kind of chugged in the open world areas but I'm hopeful that it's better.
1506000	1517000	But the gameplay does look a little bit different as well they had some gameplay in the trailer, showing that you just throw a pokeball to catch one of the actual Pokemon in the game.
1517000	1532000	It looks cool but I don't know, be interested and see what you guys think. I'm, I'm interested I want to know a little bit more about the gameplay like how it actually plays, but I kind of like the fact that they, it seems like you know because there were rumors
1532000	1548000	about like, oh the Gen 4 remake is going to be Let's Go style, and it seems like it kind of was like really off, but in a really good way like this really feels like an evolution of the Let's Go format into an evolved Generation 4 that's got this.
1548000	1564000	I don't know, it's Sinnoh but it's like, it's actually got Pokemon from other gen because you have the mixed starters and all this stuff so I'm, I'm into this how different it is, but to me, I feel like it's still a spin off, but I guess that's not the case right
1564000	1582000	Shane you were saying, they are treating this like a main series game right. Correct. It's categorized as a main series game. So, even though it has, according to the product details, no multiplayer at all, like so no connectivity to other people no trading.
1582000	1600000	It's just a straight up action RPG is what it's also classified as so that's interesting. But it is super exciting, and I am so happy for it, and this is completely 100% biased because Oshawa is one of the starters you're absolutely.
1600000	1615000	Yes. Oh my god yeah that that made me so happy because it means we're gonna get more Oshawa merchandise, which okay he's gonna have. I asked you this question of the night I'm going to ask you on air and don't don't give me the line about it doesn't make sense for the lore
1615000	1628000	just go with the question, what if that water starter had been like squirtle instead of know that I should why don't give me the lore answer, just what I'm a lower answer actually matters.
1628000	1642000	But it doesn't also because there are no, it does matter because it could have also been Froakie and that would have been fine. I swirled Oh, no, I don't care, I don't care I'm still gonna respond the proper way.
1642000	1657000	So there are only so many starters that could have been based on what we assume is because of what their final evolutions are based off of. So, water could have been Sam or could have been Oshawa or Froakie and either one would have been fine.
1657000	1664000	But the fact that it's Oshawa makes the game 70 million times better than it could have been.
1664000	1676000	Alright fine, but let's talk about the gameplay a little bit so are you are you excited about the actual gameplay of it all or what is that about like the whole like format change there that kind of excites you.
1676000	1690000	It's just something different. That's, that's really all that, like, makes me excited for the main game itself, I want to go around and just throw Pokeballs at dumb Pokemon and catch them I think that's cool.
1690000	1702000	Do you do you get like maybe it might be like a Diablo kind of Pokemon because it's kind of like that action RPG kind of thing like that's that's the part that's interesting to me. I hope it's a loot shooter.
1702000	1719000	Well, so there are leaks that came out apparently right before this got announced. There's a lot of different things about that that kind of can point you in one direction of how this game is going to go, how often are these leaks actually legit though.
1719000	1730000	No, but this, this hat. No, this is a legit leak because it got actual screens from the trailer, and it had.
1730000	1746000	I mean, it had the entire concept with in game screenshots. I'm guessing hours I don't know I did not want to look at any leaks before the announcement so I don't know what the period was I just know it was that morning before the actual announcements.
1746000	1747000	All right.
1747000	1752000	Yeah, yeah and see access says this one is legit. And also really quick.
1752000	1757000	Phoenix 7726 asked me if it was mudkip Would I be okay and.
1757000	1767000	Yeah, I think that'd be like the lower tier of being okay, but I would have been okay, because then I could just go to rally, I would just would have picked rally instead.
1767000	1779000	All right, and I do I do want to acknowledge. Usually I wait until the show is over to read this type of stuff live on air but I do want to acknowledge the hype train in chat that's going on right now and thank you very much for that you guys are really awesome
1779000	1789000	you don't have to give us any money but you do with your bits and your subs and that means an awful lot so I just want to say thanks, and congrats Yeah, you started that didn't you dark saga.
1789000	1794000	Well yeah just because Shane's in on the show hi Shane.
1794000	1807000	All right, I look like a cat but he's standing in for Mr smoosh tonight is Shane. All right. Um, anyway, what else, what else do we need to ask Shane about Pokemon before we let it go.
1807000	1823000	We need to also say really quick that since it takes place in the past. There are possibilities that we could get like different forms of Pokemon that we haven't seen, or just new ones that have gone extinct by now from when we played in the center region.
1823000	1836000	So there's a lot that they could do with this, which just makes it more exciting I think. All right. All right. Any any last things on the Pokemon game shame before I let you go so we can get back to our show.
1836000	1854000	No. All right. Oh, no. Yes. So also according to the leaks, if you don't have a Pokemon with you, wild Pokemon can attack you and beat you up. So, cool. Yeah, yeah, there's a screenshot of that too. So that's pretty neat.
1854000	1868000	Now I wish it was multiplayer so I could have I could breed attack Pokemon. That'd be cool. What if it was like Xenoblade Chronicles x, and then like you get into big mecha Pokemon and you fly around and stuff that'd be really fun.
1868000	1878000	That would be awesome. I'd love that. All right, I'm gonna let you go. Shane, have a good day. Thanks for joining us spontaneously. I appreciate it. Yeah, no problem. Bye. Take care. Bye.
1878000	1889000	All right, let's go back to the shot that we're actually supposed to use for the show. There we go. All right, I had to improvise there. Hi, dark soccer. Welcome back. Sorry to hear about the computer issues.
1889000	1891000	I hate this piece of shit.
1891000	1898000	Oh, and I hate to say it, but you sound like a robot now. And I don't know if that's your computer, or what's going on into it.
1898000	1900000	I don't know about that.
1901000	1903000	Hold on.
1903000	1910000	Yeah, leave discord and come back. Maybe that'll do the trick. All right. Meanwhile, terminate first.
1910000	1920000	All right, she's not she's not gonna do that just because you want. All right. While dark soccer reboots discord. Any last things on the Pokemon announcements we need to get to?
1920000	1929000	No. Oh yeah, you sound better. Yay. Much better. Thanks, Jamie. I didn't get to say exterminate. Sorry. All right. That's all right. Any last things on Pokemon? I am not a Dalek.
1929000	1945000	Any, any last things on Pokemon, Loki? I was gonna say the the new footage of the Pokemon snap was pretty awesome too. Oh yeah, I'm getting that game. Easy, easy. I forgot to ask Shane about that. I think Shane told me he like hasn't played Pokemon snap or something.
1945000	1963000	Yeah, it looks great. I don't remember the first game too much. I mean, I know we played it a bit. But like, I don't remember if there was like any underwater stuff like that. But I like how they're taking you kind of to the different, you know, biomes or whatever to kind of catch both months. So that's kind of cool. Yeah.
1964000	1979000	Dark soccer before we shift into our gaming weeks, unfortunately, with your computer issues, you missed our little bit on the Pokemon talk. But I'm curious if you have any thoughts either on a the new announcements this week or be Pokemon as a franchise since it's turned 25. If it's something that's meant anything to you.
1981000	1985000	I had my moment with Pokemon and then I took something for it.
1986000	1988000	Um, you know, I was always more into Digimon, right?
1988000	1991000	I know. I know. But can't can't we love both?
1991000	2004000	We can love both. But I just, I, I don't want I'm, I'm gonna say this and I'm not saying it is an insult or anything. I always found Pokemon to be a lot more juvenile.
2005000	2006000	Okay.
2006000	2008000	That really is the market is targeted for right?
2008000	2010000	Yeah, and that doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing.
2011000	2014000	Yeah, it's not intended as an insult or anything like that.
2014000	2015000	Yeah.
2015000	2035000	But, um, but I'm gonna go back and say Pokemon snap, I'm all over that because that was my jam. I like the stuff that's more like that, you know, I think that it was the grindy bits of the Pokemon games that are something that I just never quite cared for, you know, if I want to grind, I'll play an MMO.
2035000	2044000	And it also it also brings up a good point that like, even if you aren't into the mainline games, like Pokemon has so many spin off games, that there's literally something in it for everybody.
2044000	2051000	Like, you know, maybe you're more into the the Pokemon go is a huge thing for I know a lot of people that play go and like nothing else.
2052000	2062000	I know people that you know, enjoy snap like you do. I think this legends game is going to bring new people into the franchise, especially on consoles and things that maybe weren't into it before.
2062000	2069000	So that is very true. Pokemon is very diverse in the games. Like, yeah, you have the mainline, but you got a lot of spin off stuff, too.
2070000	2084000	Yeah. Well, and I like I think some of the more spin off type stuff better. You know, I like Pokemon go for a hot minute. And then I got bored, you know, because it was really just no matter what they added the game, it's always the same thing.
2084000	2086000	Yeah, it's just always the same thing.
2086000	2094000	So there just really hasn't been much in the way of innovation in the series to keep me interested.
2095000	2111000	Okay. You know, that's just kind of I mean, but I'm glad people love it. And I think that everything is cute. And I, you know, I, I still want, you know, my, my, my Fire Rabbit Bunny plushie, you know, and I still have my Magikarp plushie.
2111000	2114000	I actually do still play Magikarp jump from time to time.
2114000	2116000	Okay, there you go. Another spin off game.
2117000	2119000	Yeah, because that game is fucking funny.
2119000	2121000	It is. It's fun. All right.
2122000	2124000	And I love the Magikarp song.
2127000	2133000	So there's something in it for everybody. That's the song that Post Malone should have covered. Maybe they'll give the Magikarp song to Katy Perry. We'll see.
2133000	2140000	All right. Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing this week, whether it was Pokemon or something else.
2140000	2142000	Dark Soccer, I'll start with you. How was your gaming week?
2142000	2145000	Speaking of more of the same, I've been playing Animal Crossing.
2146000	2157000	I finally, and it's been one of those weeks where all I want to do is just play the same stuff I play anyway, although we did get a little bit more of Cyber Shadow in. Cyber Shadow is fucking awesome.
2157000	2173000	And Ghost and Goblins for that Capcom collection, although it doesn't look like anything else is out with that collection yet, because I tried to go by Strider and it says you can buy Ghost and Goblins and I'm like, fuck, I want to play Strider.
2173000	2184000	You can get them all. It's set up bad. You for whatever reason, when you go within the game, you don't see it. If you go into the eShop from the main menu and go in that way, you can find you can find everything.
2184000	2191000	I got thrown by that, too. Yeah, you can do it on Nintendo's website, too. Actually, that might have been how I ended up doing it.
2192000	2200000	But I know that Dan is going to be getting the new one soon. We just have had other things to do.
2200000	2214000	Sure. But I actually am redoing part of Sakurina's house, my alt, and I have made a kitchen where the laundromat was. Yes, I had a laundromat in one of my alt's house.
2215000	2224000	And I'm going to be redoing the front room into a sushi restaurant. Cute. I love that. All right, let's go to Loki. How was your gaming week, Loki?
2224000	2238000	It was all right. So I played a little bit of Skyrim on the Switch because I was helping my son get the Nintendo Switch exclusive armor and weapons because they had the link stuff, but it was at the top of the throat of the world.
2238000	2253000	So I had to show him the power of the Skyrim horse and its ability to climb up vertical walls. And so we were able to bypass parts of the game that they wanted us to complete before we got all that.
2253000	2268000	So we were able to do that at level like five. So that was fun. And I showed him also the glitches in the game, like some of the exploits to get to the vendor chest to be able to steal stuff out of there and all that.
2268000	2291000	Then I also played a bit of Minecraft, been working on the amusement park in our realm. So start off with I'm migrating over the villagers I have kind of trapped in a house to move them over to these giant versions of like a crafting table and blast furnace in smoker.
2292000	2302000	They're going to be inside these giant buildings that resemble that stuff. So I've been building the buildings for that and terraforming and stuff like that. So I did that and actually worked on my game quite a bit.
2302000	2320000	So I had to rewrite the input engine to allow for multiple characters without dragging the game to a crawl because the way that nest makers set up, if you want to have multiple characters that you set up to actually play as you have to assign them inputs.
2320000	2332000	And the longer that input list gets, the more slower or the longer it takes each frame to process that. And then eventually it slows down to the point where it's unplayable.
2332000	2346000	So I fix that so it doesn't it doesn't do it. So now now once the special edition comes out, you know, name pending, there will be female playable characters if you want.
2347000	2363000	So that'll be something that's in there as well. Right now, I'm just trying to also try to figure out how to cram more music in there and not having a lot of luck because of the way they have that set up. So it can be done. I just don't know how to split it up yet.
2363000	2372000	All right. All right. Even though you finally released a game, which if you haven't checked it out yet, Pixel Poops number two on Steam or itch.io, check it out.
2372000	2378000	And but you're not done. The work is not done because now we got to work on this for the physical release.
2378000	2386000	So I was, you know, planning on adding some more content for the physical release and then doing a free upgrade for everybody to purchase it.
2387000	2396000	All right, my gaming week. So I'm still yet again having a very Final Fantasy heavy week, still playing Final Fantasy 14, as I always do. Finally got my Dragoon to level 80.
2396000	2404000	So I think I only have like five jobs left to get to level 80 and then literally everything crafting, gathering, magic, melee, tank, all of it will be 80.
2404000	2414000	So but I still have a few more jobs to do with that. I've also been playing more Final Fantasy 12. I am a lot further in the game than I was last time I played through it.
2414000	2420000	I think I have about 24 hours in on that now. And I don't know how to describe where I'm at.
2420000	2426000	I old Arceus, Arcadius, whatever that town is that those that have played the game.
2426000	2433000	I'm trying to be spoiler free, but you kind of navigate your way to the capital and you have to take a really long route to get there.
2433000	2441000	And I finally got through that route and had to kill another boss that did a pretty good job of messing up my party by casting doom a lot.
2441000	2447000	But I was able to make it work and kill that boss and got to old Arcadius, I think is the name of the town.
2447000	2451000	So yeah, for those that have played through the game, that's about where I'm at.
2451000	2458000	So I don't know if that's I think I've got to be at least past the halfway point, but I do also feel like I've got a long way to go still.
2458000	2465000	So we'll see. And then I also played because I was like, what other Game Pass games should I check out?
2465000	2472000	I played Overcooked 2 this week, which I've played. It's cute. I've played it as a multiplayer game before.
2472000	2475000	I know when like JD and I were hanging out, like he really likes that game.
2475000	2479000	And like I've done like a four player game of like over maybe that was the first Overcooked.
2479000	2490000	I don't know. We've played several of those games, but I never had played the single player version before where you have to use the left bumper to actually control two characters kind of.
2490000	2496000	And that's so like while one is chopping up like, you know, cucumber or something, you have to have another go boil the rice.
2496000	2500000	It's kind of it's kind of interesting and very hectic and micromanaging, but that's a fun game.
2500000	2514000	That's a cute little like short time waster. And I'm glad that also exists on Xbox as well as something that I can drop hours in at in at a time like Final Fantasy 12.
2515000	2525000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I realized how much data I had left for February and downloaded all the Final Fantasy games that are on Game Pass, even though I bought Zodiac Age for PS4.
2525000	2537000	So did I. But like, there's something about playing it on Series X where the loading times are like that, where I'm like, dang, this is, you know, really, it's great to play through it again.
2537000	2543000	And again, I'm even further than I've ever been before. And yeah, today's the last day of the month. I did the same thing.
2543000	2551000	I was like, okay, I have still like 400 gigs till I get to my cap. What I and I hate that the cable stuff is like this now.
2551000	2563000	But I was like, what else can I download today? I actually downloaded I never thought I would finally like be willing to play this and get it as I downloaded Dead by Daylight, because and I brought this up a couple weeks ago.
2563000	2574000	But Alan, my husband now does streaming. So shout out, you should follow him here on Twitch at AlanAlchemy. He's been doing a pretty good job streaming like three times a week that I think he did for the other week.
2574000	2582000	And he hit affiliate and all that good stuff. And he streams a lot of Dead by Daylight. So I mean, I've watched him play it over his shoulder before.
2582000	2592000	But now I've actually been able to kind of like watch him kind of like for an extended period, like really play the game. And I'm like, maybe I could get into this except I don't really want to play it as a survivor.
2592000	2597000	I just want to play the killer. So it'd be fun.
2597000	2601000	Did he do any of the Silent Hill stuff?
2601000	2613000	He has, yes, he's gotten that map. He's had Pyramid Head as the killer who has apparently a unique finish fatality type of move. I forget what they call it in that game.
2613000	2623000	But there's unique ways you can finally finish people off and Pyramid Head has kind of unique ones. So yeah, I finally picked that up thanks to Alan's influence.
2623000	2636000	I don't know what killer I'll play yet, though. Pyramid Head would be an awful lot of fun. But Alan's trying to tell me, of course, he's like, Oh, you're gonna play? Okay, these are the killers that I think would be easiest and you'd be into so he's he's making other suggestions for me.
2636000	2649000	So we'll see what happens. Will Alan and I play together? I don't know because I want to be a killer and I don't really want to murder my husband. But I guess, you know, we've all had our days. So I guess virtual is a good way to do it. Take out the aggressions.
2649000	2663000	I don't think you can really set up you know, because it's all matchmaking. So whatever. Anyway. All right. Um, let's get into some other news from the week. We'll start with Loki.
2663000	2680000	All right. So we talked a little bit about the whole Pokemon event that they had, but that wasn't the only event that was out there. Also, they had a PlayStation State of Play, which they announced quite a few different things coming out in PlayStation.
2680000	2694000	So starting off, they showed off a little bit of Crash Bandicoot 4. It's about time that's going to be coming with some PlayStation five upgrades. And so that's going to be launching actually in a couple weeks here on March 12.
2694000	2709000	They showed some gameplay for Returnal, which is a roguelike third person game. And that's coming out on April 30th. Knockout City, which we kind of saw back in that Nintendo Direct not too long ago.
2709000	2728000	That's launching on May 21st. Solar Ash looked pretty awesome. It's kind of definitely resembles Hyper Light Drifter because it's by the same creators. That's coming out on PlayStation four and five. Oddworld Soulstorm looks pretty awesome.
2728000	2744000	That's April six. We saw some more of Kenna Bridges Spirits, and that's out on the 21st. Yet again, more gameplay of Deathloop. Still coming out this year, May 21st.
2744000	2755000	And then, of course, one of the biggest things that they showed off is Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade, which is going to be the PlayStation five update as well.
2755000	2766000	And then on top of that, you also get an additional, I guess, section of the game or content featuring Yuffie as well. And so that's pretty exciting.
2766000	2775000	Plus, if you own the PlayStation four version, you'll be getting Intergrade for free and even have like save data transfer with that as well.
2775000	2782000	And that's supposed to be coming out, looks like on June 10th. That was a very pleasant surprise.
2782000	2790000	I mean, I'm not surprised at all. And I know I've said on this show, you fully can expect that they are going to release that Final Fantasy seven remake on PlayStation five.
2790000	2802000	Bet your money on it. But where I was wrong, and I'm more than happy to be wrong on this, is I thought like the previous international editions, zodiac age, whatever, you know, definitive editions that Square does of games.
2802000	2813000	I thought they would charge full price for it all over again. And that's where I ended up being wrong, is that apparently you can get the upgrade from the PlayStation four version of the game for free.
2813000	2826000	Now, there are a lot of footnotes with this. I know later you're going to talk about the PlayStation plus, but I think we should just kind of mention now, obviously, the Final Fantasy seven is going to be part of PlayStation plus, so you can get that for free.
2826000	2833000	But that will not cross over to a PlayStation five version of the game. So just because you get it.
2833000	2845000	So only the retail copies of Final Fantasy seven, whether digital or whatever, are going to translate to PlayStation five and that Eufy, which really strikes me more as an episode, like a side story.
2845000	2852000	It doesn't look like it's integrated into the main game. It looks like its own chapter based thing, maybe one or two chapters, maybe four. Who knows?
2852000	2862000	It's like the Final Fantasy 15 DLC to me, like it's a whole side episode that happens to have Eufy and they are charging money for that.
2862000	2874000	But I think they're allowed. Again, I would not have guessed that. I would have thought that they would have like made Red 13, you know, playable in the appropriate parts of the game as it is.
2874000	2889000	I did not expect them to go full like adding Eufy into the Midgar lore, which remember wasn't a part of the first game. Well, I don't want to eat my words.
2889000	2898000	She was say that again, Jamie. She was like a bonus character. Her and Vincent were. Yeah, but you didn't get them till after Midgar. They were in the war.
2898000	2905000	So that's that's my point is that I thought there was a place that you could get her in Midgar, though, but it was extremely rare.
2905000	2917000	Oh, it was right there by the there was like a playground that, you know, no, no, because you had to go get her on Wutai and answer certain questions to be able to get her.
2917000	2921000	Yeah. Vincent was in in another town.
2921000	2927000	But anyway, OK, regardless, I don't think most people would have picked up that you could get her in Midgar.
2927000	2935000	And obviously she's got a whole new, you know, other character in there. So she's got this new story that didn't really exist in the lore before.
2935000	2943000	But if you've played Final Fantasy seven remake and I don't want to say too much, but there's there's room for this in the game.
2943000	2947000	And if you've played the game from start to finish, you kind of know what I'm I'm talking about here.
2947000	2955000	And it's again, I got to choose my words very carefully. I am going to lift this spoiler ban soon when that game has been out for a year.
2955000	2960000	I'm going to talk spoilers freely because I have a lot I want to say on this, but I think we still have another couple of months to go.
2960000	2967000	But fair warning, I am going to open up spoilers on fantasy seven remake in April whenever that game is a year old.
2967000	2979000	So. All right. Dijeroma S in chat says, the way Square Enix is redoing the Final Fantasy seven lore and storyline, there's going to be some real pissed off Final Fantasy seven fans.
2979000	2984000	Not if they've played the game. And that's all I can say.
2984000	2991000	I need to finish it. It is it is explained. That's all I can say. All right.
2991000	2999000	Anyhow. Oh, I was going to mention, too, they also had a new Five Nights at Freddy's game, at least the footage for it.
2999000	3009000	So Five Nights at Freddy's Security Breach, which kind of it looks like expands Freddy Fazbear's pizzeria into like Freddy Fazbear's.
3009000	3020000	Oh, yeah. Golf land. I don't usually get into the Five Nights at Freddy's games because I'm not super big on the way they're set up, but I kind of liked this one, looked a little more like a traditional kind of action horror game.
3020000	3026000	Yeah, I was kind of into it. So. Yeah, it looks interesting. Yeah. All right.
3026000	3034000	Well, what do you think of the state of play overall? I heard online a lot of people were saying, man, I thought it was fine.
3034000	3041000	I wasn't like, oh, my God. But I that returnal, I'd like sort of had an eye on it.
3041000	3048000	But after seeing the gameplay and hearing more about it, I'm like, OK, I would I kind of want a PlayStation five so I can play that.
3048000	3054000	Like, I'm I'm convinced I need to get a PlayStation five for that. I want to play the seven remake again, obviously.
3054000	3060000	And then Final Fantasy 14 on PlayStation five. There's a lot of stuff coming in these first few months that I really want to PS5 for.
3060000	3066000	Unfortunately, I have some conflicting priorities in my personal life financially right now, so I can't really justify it.
3066000	3073000	And let's be real, they're not exactly still easy to get, unfortunately. But hopefully they get that sorted out in the next few months.
3073000	3078000	I'm assuming by the end of the year I'm going to have to get one of those because I really want it.
3078000	3089000	So, yeah, I'm sure eventually I'll have to get that. And also there's another story coming up which also has me interested in stuff for that.
3089000	3093000	We'll see. Yeah. All right.
3093000	3099000	So anyway, yeah, I was fine with the state of play, even if it was a lot of follow up on previously announced stuff.
3099000	3106000	I still kind of feel like that's what left people disappointed about the direct was we didn't get a lot of follow up on previously announced stuff.
3106000	3109000	So it's I don't know. Anyway, I was fine with it.
3109000	3116000	So are we just not going to are we not going to even address the fact that they talked about Metroid Prime for like.
3116000	3125000	How long ago was that? Well, yeah, they've been able to kind of hide behind the they basically started it over a couple of years ago.
3125000	3129000	So that's kind of why. So but I would say things like Bayonetta three.
3129000	3133000	And, you know, like what's going on, folks? Is that still happening?
3133000	3137000	You know, even even like a screenshot would be great anyway. But we'll see.
3137000	3140000	It'll be ready when it's ready, I guess. And the pandemic hasn't helped.
3140000	3144000	And everybody having to transition to work at home and all that crap certainly hasn't helped the timelines.
3144000	3152000	All right. Yeah. But let's talk about some other Final Fantasy seven spinoff games that are going to be happening because,
3152000	3155000	you know, now's a great time to do remasters while we work at home.
3155000	3162000	Although I would I would call at least the first one of these a little bit more than a remaster.
3162000	3166000	Of course, I accidentally closed the show. And now it's very hard for me to get this open again.
3166000	3173000	But I believe the first game that was in here was.
3173000	3180000	Ever Crisis, I think was the name, and it's going to be a mobile game and it adapts like pretty much all of the Final Fantasy seven side stories.
3180000	3185000	And Jason talked about it in the intro tonight. There's a lot of Final Fantasy seven side stories.
3185000	3191000	It's going to incorporate all of that into one game that allows you to kind of catch up on the story,
3191000	3196000	which makes me think maybe part two of the remake a little bit more of this is going to be important.
3196000	3200000	Although, again, I can't say too much.
3200000	3207000	But knowing a little bit of one of the side stories will help in the final sequences of the seven remake.
3207000	3213000	That's all I can say. It's weird, though, that the graphics for that Ever Crisis are kind of like a cross between,
3213000	3220000	like remade and like the old style, like Final Fantasy seven.
3220000	3225000	You know, the original. Yeah, it's interesting. Yeah.
3225000	3229000	You know, honestly, like, OK, mobile. All right. I understand mobile can do a lot.
3229000	3233000	You know, those little devices, whether they're Apple or Android, doesn't matter.
3233000	3240000	They both can process very powerful little graphics that really rival, you know, what the consoles are doing.
3240000	3245000	But there's still that part of me that's like, so does this mean we get a switch version? Because that'd be cool.
3245000	3253000	You know, actually. Yeah. And is that like Ever Crisis that also like encompass the the full Final Fantasy seven game?
3253000	3257000	Because there's stuff that it looks like it's not just like that first episode stuff.
3257000	3261000	It looks like beyond that. I believe it encompasses everything.
3261000	3264000	It's supposed to be kind of a catch up on all the Lord. That would be good.
3264000	3268000	I think it should go. I mean, that looks like something to be able to run on the switch.
3268000	3274000	So I don't know now. Now, here's the announcement that's a little bit like I didn't ask for this, but we're getting it.
3274000	3279000	It's called the first soldier. It says Final Fantasy seven side project.
3279000	3285000	That is a battle royale game. So Final Fantasy meets battle royale.
3285000	3288000	And yeah, you even get to use guns in it because it works with the Midgar lore.
3288000	3291000	But you still also have chocobos, spells, summons and all of that.
3291000	3296000	Everyone in the battlefield will be a Shinra soldier candidate.
3296000	3299000	That's how they set it up. There's solo play and team play.
3299000	3304000	I believe this is also a mobile title, but it does look mobile.
3304000	3306000	It doesn't necessarily mean it's going to stay there.
3306000	3309000	Fortnite is a mobile title if you think about it.
3309000	3315000	But again, that's another one of those things where I'm like, I didn't ask for this, but with Final Fantasy's name on it.
3315000	3318000	And if it's free, I'll at least probably give it a shot.
3318000	3320000	We'll see.
3320000	3322000	It looks neat.
3322000	3326000	Dark Sakura, Final Fantasy Battle Royale. Did you ask for this?
3326000	3328000	No.
3328000	3334000	What do you think, though? Like, is it cool that they keep doing all these side stories or like, stop it?
3334000	3342000	Give me, give me, um, uh, Dirge of Cerberus instead.
3342000	3346000	Yeah, I'm down with that. That was a great spinoff.
3346000	3350000	Um, I know what, you know the Final Fantasy spinoff I want them to go back to?
3350000	3353000	Theatrhythm. Where is my Switch version of Theatrhythm?
3353000	3355000	And I'm going to keep pounding my fists on the table.
3355000	3361000	I don't know if they're getting picked up by the mic, but I'm mad that we haven't had a new Theatrhythm in a very long time.
3361000	3366000	Do not give me that Kingdom Hearts thing is supposed to be a new Theatrhythm because it sucks.
3366000	3368000	Sorry, not sorry. It sucks.
3368000	3371000	I want Theatrhythm like it was in the arcade.
3371000	3373000	Give it to me.
3374000	3375000	That's all.
3375000	3380000	I mean, I would want, um, some Advent Children stuff, but, you know.
3380000	3384000	I would like the game where you can kill Aerith over and over again.
3387000	3393000	How about it's Battle Royale, but it's you versus 99 Aeriths?
3394000	3396000	No, I just don't want to see her that much.
3397000	3398000	Okay.
3399000	3403000	Alright, let's move on. DarkSakura, what do you want to see more of?
3404000	3406000	Um, but I'm kidding.
3408000	3411000	Animal Crossing stuff, of course.
3411000	3423000	So, um, they had a trailer that showed that the Sanrio collaboration pack of the amiibo cards are going to be out at Target on March 26th.
3423000	3435000	But if you paid more attention to it, you can actually invite the characters, I believe on the 15th, if I am.
3435000	3441000	It's not in this list on here, but it was in the video.
3441000	3447000	It's like the 13th or 15th for people who might have already imported those cards.
3449000	3450000	Addicts.
3451000	3456000	Well, and we knew though, actually they had, there was an announcement that those cards are going to be coming out already.
3457000	3459000	I think I talked about it like a couple months ago.
3460000	3469000	So, but the thing is that we didn't know if they were going to be, you know, anything more than just the posters like they currently are.
3470000	3472000	But you actually will get the characters with them.
3472000	3477000	You will get some goodies with them, like furniture sets and clothes and things.
3477000	3482000	So the cards are basically themed to different Sanrio characters.
3483000	3486000	So you get Rila, who's a gorilla, for Hello Kitty.
3487000	3488000	You get Chelsea for My Melody.
3489000	3491000	You get Etoile for Little Twin Stars Kiki Lala.
3492000	3493000	Those are my favorite ones, by the way.
3494000	3497000	You get Chai for Pom Pom Pudding, which I have a little Pom Pom Pudding behind me.
3498000	3504000	You get, uh, sorry, Marty for Pom Pom Pudding, Chai for Cinema Role, and Tobi for Kero Kero Kero Pi.
3504000	3511000	So, um, it's, uh, you know, it's going to be really awesome.
3512000	3515000	They get very, I think, generic houses themed to them as well.
3516000	3519000	Um, I, I think it's, it's pretty cute.
3520000	3526000	You know, I, I absolutely dig, uh, that we're getting the more of the Sanrio stuff.
3526000	3535000	So because they said that the stuff would be available earlier if you already had the cards,
3536000	3542000	and we just had that big update installed, um, you know, basically to get rid of the snow and all that,
3543000	3546000	um, I actually tested my Sanrio cards today.
3547000	3551000	Um, and the characters aren't available or, or in the game yet.
3552000	3554000	So I reckon that's going to be in the form of another update.
3554000	3557000	Um, so yeah.
3558000	3564000	I need these cards to sell millions and billions so that they'll do another set and give me Bad Bats Maru.
3565000	3569000	Um, but otherwise this will probably be the thing that gets me to play Animal Crossing again.
3570000	3575000	And I haven't really played it since August, but between this and the Mario content, I'm like, I really need to, I need to build.
3576000	3583000	So Rob, these cards actually were part of the Welcome Amiibo set for New Leaf.
3584000	3588000	So these cards are actually out with the previous Animal Crossing game.
3589000	3598000	And from what I'm seeing so far, I haven't, they're, they're bringing back things that were in the game before, kind of sorta.
3599000	3604000	Well, they can give me more. I want, I want, I want the golden goose.
3605000	3611000	The only, the other thing though, that we're not seeing is that there aren't any announcements for releasing the, uh,
3611000	3618000	the new characters, you know, like Raymond and, and Dom as, as their own Amiibo cards.
3619000	3621000	Oh, cause those Raymond cards would be nuts.
3622000	3632000	Yeah. Um, basically you have to already have them in your village to be able to invite them for photo ops so you can get their poster.
3633000	3643000	However, if anyone has any of the new characters and their posters, please send me one. I would love to, to, to have them and I can send you Dom.
3644000	3650000	Um, Dan's all super excited right now cause he has what we call the Squid Squad, even though they're Octopi.
3651000	3652000	We have all three of the Octopi characters.
3653000	3654000	How fun.
3655000	3656000	Yeah. Or I've been calling them the Octo Squad.
3657000	3669000	But at any rate, um, I'm, I'm pretty excited about the Hello Kitty stuff cause you also get little backpacks and I would legit wear a Kiki Lala backpack cause Little Twin Stars is my favorite.
3670000	3676000	Love it. All right. I'm looking forward to this too. I can't wait for the, uh, uh, characters to be in Animal Crossing. Yay.
3677000	3680000	Well, and if you have difficulty getting the cards, Rob, I will assist.
3681000	3693000	Thank you. Because yeah, we know Nintendo can never, um, publish enough, you know, hardware. Although I feel weird calling Amiibo cards hardware, but even the Amiibo can be a pain in the fat ass to find. So I'm very much-
3694000	3695000	I like Tookist. Pain in the Tookist.
3696000	3704000	Pain in the Tookist to find. So I'm looking forward to, uh, uh, the cards if I can find them. So, all right, let's move on.
3705000	3713000	Well, Target. Hey, I'll tell you what, Rob. When I am there day one to buy my cards, maybe I'll pick up a second pack for you.
3714000	3728000	That's very sweet of you. Thank you. I had pretty good luck with Target though. Target came through with my Xbox Series X. So we're friends right now. You know, friendship ended with Amazon. Now Target is my new best friend. So that's, that's where I'm at right now when it comes to gaming.
3728000	3735000	All right, let's move on. Uh, Loki, we might be ending our friendship with somebody else at least, or putting it on hold for a year, right?
3736000	3751000	Yeah. Well, I mean, it's not a big shock that, uh, E3 and, uh, this year of 2021 with the pandemic still raging on has been allegedly canceled according to, uh, the-
3752000	3764000	Apparently there is a travel, uh, LA tourism document that shows that it has been canceled in form of a, uh, basically a digital event.
3764000	3786000	So in the citywide conventions, 21 or 2021 on the books, they list, uh, E3 2021, June 15th says canceled live event in 2021, working with production team on broadcast options at LA live, uh, LA convention center working on 2022 and 2023 license.
3786000	3800000	So this is, uh, a document that's basically to inform, I think, uh, maybe Nate nearby hotels or whatever. Um, because they have total room nights, uh, room nights, uh, kind of estimates.
3800000	3810000	So yeah, it's probably the brace downtown for like staffing levels and things like that. Yeah. It's like, yeah, you want your restaurants to be well staffed and all that stuff.
3811000	3821000	So it's probably for something like that. You know, it was interesting though, reading that document just real quick. I actually looked at that, that actual document, not just for E3, but to see like, kind of like what else they were canceling.
3821000	3832000	And it really seems like everything throughout summer is canceling, but then like kind of like September, nothing has fallen off yet. And that seems to be a trend we're seeing.
3832000	3842000	Yeah. Uh, I know, um, in his neck of the woods, Bobby Black Wolf was posting about MomoCon, which I think was a June thing, maybe an April thing. I can't remember. Sorry, Bobby. You might have to correct me.
3842000	3856000	Um, but I know they have just, um, decided they're not going to be able to do this year because of everything going on. So they're going to go to 2022, but they're looking at doing potentially a winter fest as kind of like a holdover.
3856000	3870000	But all of this, of course, depends on, you know, where are the numbers at, you know, vaccines, vaccines, but where are the numbers at? And that's going to be the big driver for what the fall looks like. Like, I think in the summer, we'll probably be having small gatherings again.
3870000	3877000	I think that as long as like everybody's vaccinated and stuff, that'll probably be something that you can do relatively low risk. Like we could probably do OLR again.
3877000	3891000	Um, but I think big gatherings are still very risky. Cruises and stuff like that are still very risky. And so people are hopeful for fall, but it's the numbers are going to be the driver in that whole situation, period.
3891000	3901000	Um, so we'll, we'll see what happens. Um, yeah. Yeah. And I, I don't know what happens with things with this. Well, now Disneyland and all that stuff. I saw one for Knott's Berry Farm today too.
3901000	3916000	They're, they're getting creative and they're doing these outdoor events that are like not, the rides aren't open, but you can get, uh, I think the Knott's Berry Farm is a whole boysenberry thing. So you can get all this food at outdoor events and stuff like that.
3916000	3928000	So it's, uh, interesting. So we'll see. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I, I, I miss my cons, but I understand it's got to be safe. Um, and so it is what it is.
3928000	3939000	Um, E3 I don't miss. Sorry. E3 I don't miss. E3 is too many people.
3939000	3950000	When we talk about the new normal and how digital is going to be an option for everything, I think in the future. And I think there's going to be more awareness about these virtual events and digital things.
3950000	3962000	And we've kind of talked about this on previous episodes. I think E3 having to go digital, E3 was already going digital. That was the problem I had with going to the show.
3962000	3969000	I don't want to repeat myself too much, but you know, everything that was frustrating me about the show was because it was already online. What was I really getting from being there?
3969000	3986000	So I think E3 becoming a digital thing for what it is makes a lot of sense. So I, now things like that are fan driven events with like cosplay and tournaments, which E3 is, that's not, E3 was not for cosplay until they started inviting the public.
3986000	4000000	And, you know, but, but things like, you know, Magfest and Dragon Con and your local anime cons, things like that. That is different. You know, and I think those, I would love to see those back in person again, safe numbers, et cetera, et cetera.
4000000	4013000	But I think E3 going digital is kind of like the logical next step for them. So anyway, and Bobby does point out E3 shouldn't be a convention. It's a trade show. Yeah, that is the difference there.
4013000	4024000	E3 trying to become a convention helped kill it. Yeah, E3 was definitely having an identity crisis, that's for sure. So Bob Coffee says Nintendo Directs killed E3.
4024000	4039000	You know, talk all the smack about Nintendo you want, especially when they lag behind the curve in online. But they were the first to say, you know, we're going to just do our own conference this year online, direct to our fans instead of doing a press conference, E3 style and look at where we're at.
4040000	4057000	So, yeah, DJ Rama S says, man, I'm burned out from virtual digital conventions. I get that because it's all we've had for the last year. But I think when it is an option versus the only thing you can do for an entire year, I think you're gonna see a happier medium there.
4057000	4077000	Like, I think it would be like, I don't know if I could get out and fly to something like, I don't know, what's a big convention back east? The Katsucon, let's say. I don't know the next time I'm going to be able to attend a Katsucon in person. But if they had a digital thing, I might check it out. We'll see. So who knows?
4077000	4091000	All right. Anyway, more to come as the world responds to what's going on. But I think as far as E3 is concerned, a transition to digital made sense for them anyway. So not really surprised to see it.
4091000	4097000	I'll be honest, I haven't missed it since the last time I attended. I didn't care.
4098000	4108000	Well, yeah, E3 in particular, I'm not that torn up about. It's the other conventions I miss, you know. And certainly where this domino falls, the others will as well.
4108000	4122000	Well, thankfully, I am in the third group for vaccination. So I'm getting together the Leia army for Dragon Con 2022.
4123000	4135000	Yep. Again, it's how we respond to these mutations and stuff and making sure that enough people get vaxxed. I know everyone here is going to get the vaxxed as soon as we can and we're eligible and it's fair.
4135000	4149000	But if enough people in the world don't get the vaxxed, that's how the virus mutates. So that's, you know, that's the next big issue we're facing here is trying to get these people that are like vaccines are going to be microchips and Bill Gates and stuff.
4149000	4158000	We have we have to call that out for the foolishness that it is because it's it's literally going to hurt this and keep this pandemic going anyway.
4158000	4164000	But we could do a whole other three hours on that. And honestly, if you turn to any cable news channel, you can get 24 seven on that.
4164000	4174000	But let's move on and talk about let's talk about more negativity. Let's talk about stadia or I should say, you know, no, I don't want to insult the stadia fans because I know there's people that are loyal to stadia.
4174000	4183000	I'm not out to insult the stadia fans. I'm out to insult two of you. No, I'm out. That's an insult. I'm out to insult the stadia management. That is who I'm out to insult.
4183000	4193000	And but you know what? They've been insulting their employees and so forth with all that, you know, gassing them up that they're doing great only to lay them off a week later.
4193000	4199000	So anyway, and now we're hearing about oh boy, you want to hear about some more fuck ups by management. Here we go.
4199000	4211000	Bloomberg put out a big report this week where it underperformed the sales target by hundreds of thousands of users, even though they spent tens of millions of dollars on their own big blockbuster games to bring over.
4211000	4222000	So for example, they paid publishers like Ubisoft and take to quite a bit of money to get things like Red Dead Redemption two on the service when it released.
4222000	4235000	Of course, the service ended up suffering from a lack of games overall because Google failed to offer enough money. This is according to a business insider report to indie developers to win their games over to the its platform.
4235000	4245000	Some people wanted Google to be stadia and beta first and then growing slowly. But then, of course, they ended up going out to market with a product that wasn't finished and didn't really call it a beta.
4245000	4253000	And I'm saying it wasn't finished because you had to have the Chromecast to get on. They didn't have that messaging about just being able to go to stadia.google.com to play.
4253000	4259000	So that should have all been the way it was the very first day. The way they rolled it out didn't really work.
4259000	4267000	And then, of course, now we know they are in not the greatest of places. Stadia is still going on. Stadia is not dead.
4267000	4274000	It is an important point to make, but the stuff Stadia was working on for first party is gone.
4274000	4285000	At least there is one victory that can be celebrated in Stadia world. They won Terraria back. They've smoothed things over with Andrew Spinks, who's the developer over Terraria.
4285000	4296000	You might remember he tweeted a lot of angry stuff being locked out of his Google account. I think it made us all think about how much shit we have invested in Google and should we put it all there if saying the wrong thing on YouTube will get us banned someday.
4297000	4304000	They've worked their shit out. Gee, I wonder what finally got a human at Google's attention. I wonder what finally did that.
4304000	4309000	Maybe they threw some money at him. We just discussed that they did it. Other companies support their game over.
4309000	4321000	And so, hooray, they got Terraria on Stadia. And I mean this with all due respect to Andrew Spinks and Terraria. It's a great game. It's available everywhere.
4321000	4327000	It's not something where I'm going to be like, ooh, I got to get Stadia so I can play Terraria.
4327000	4337000	And it doesn't really make the argument for like, I need a powerful machine to run Terraria. Terraria is cute and popular because you don't need a strong machine to run it.
4337000	4350000	So like, this game is not the greatest use case scenario for Stadia. Again, that is no disrespect to Terraria. But this is not going to change anything with Stadia's successes or lack thereof.
4351000	4369000	But I'm glad they worked their personal shit out. I wish that they could find a solution for when we all, you know, if I get locked out of my Google account and I don't have a fucking game that Stadia wants, you know, how am I going to get my account back?
4369000	4382000	And we talked about this, how certain other companies have wonderful customer service. Google does not. And that is really hurting them right now. Anyway, looking at our chat.
4382000	4394000	DGRMS says you can still buy Chromecast, but then Miltonius Games is saying they were replaced with Google TV. PodCulture says Chromecast have Google TV, they were not replaced, just changed.
4394000	4404000	In all honesty, guys, and looking at you, do you see where this is also a problem when it comes to Google? That like, there's a really bad consistent messaging here?
4406000	4407000	Yeah.
4407000	4409000	Google has a lot to think about right now. I'm just saying.
4409000	4413000	By the way, thanks for reminding me to cancel my sub for Stadia.
4413000	4415000	You're welcome. All right.
4415000	4419000	I have my free one. I haven't opened the box.
4419000	4434000	Yeah. This, this, my point is, this shouldn't, and I see the chat is still kind of like, no Chromecast are there. Yes, sir. My point is, this shouldn't even be a question. Like, just to look at a competitor for a minute. This is like saying, is iPhone still a thing?
4435000	4445000	Why, why, yes, iPhone is a thing. Now, there may be different models and different types, different sizes and colors, but yet, but iPhone, iPhones are still there. We all know that.
4445000	4458000	And I'm not, again, I'm not saying that to pit one company versus the other. I'm just saying this is where Google's messaging problem is. So, all right. Anyway, let's move on.
4459000	4465000	Let's talk about, oops, I forgot to advance the sidebar. So let's go to dark soccer is where we're at now.
4468000	4474000	And you're muted dark soccer, just so you know, you might've, you might've muted yourself. It's, it's a hard mute on Discord. I can see the little.
4474000	4479000	Yeah, I did it. I did it so that I wouldn't eat tacos and churros into the mic.
4479000	4482000	That's a good thing. You just have to remember to unmute, but that's okay.
4482000	4486000	I'm a good fucking person. I mean, seriously.
4486000	4487000	All right.
4487000	4490000	Although I will let everyone watch me eat the tacos and churros.
4490000	4498000	Tacos are real. I had tacos yesterday, so I got, okay, aside for a minute, because I had to message Bobby Blackwolf about the taco I ate yesterday.
4498000	4503000	And I'm going to tell you why. Have you had that local chain here, Chondo's Tacos?
4503000	4512000	I got sick at Chondo's Tacos, but it's just because of the way the food's cooked. I kind of have the same issue with Jim Boy's.
4512000	4515000	Okay, well Jim Boy's is really like fatty too. I understand why.
4515000	4519000	But I fucking loved the burrito that I had. It was like this creamy one. It was so good.
4519000	4523000	Yeah, the Chondo's Tacos are really good. Like, and they're not paying me to say that.
4523000	4524000	They are really good.
4524000	4526000	They are really good. Loki, have you had it?
4526000	4528000	I have not had a Chondo's yet.
4528000	4529000	Okay, seek it out.
4529000	4530000	Although, I still prefer Felipe's.
4530000	4534000	Seek it out because Chondo's is good and it's a Sacramento thing, but here's the thing.
4534000	4540000	So why did I message Bobby Blackwolf about the taco I was eating yesterday? Because I heard on the news, Chondo's is expanding.
4540000	4544000	They're going beyond Sacramento. They're going to be opening a new location in Atlanta.
4545000	4550000	They're going that far for a new location? Like, I guess...
4550000	4556000	Maybe someone in the ownership of it moved to Georgia.
4556000	4559000	I get like a relative or something like that, I guess. I don't know.
4559000	4564000	Like they can't get fucking In-N-Out further than Texas, but they can get a Chondo's Tacos all the way to Atlanta.
4564000	4566000	Someone, please explain.
4566000	4567000	Bring me a fucking Waffle House.
4567000	4569000	Please explain, Loki.
4569000	4577000	Yeah, I used to see the food truck all the time and I know that they have a physical restaurant up in El Dorado Hills, but I haven't actually been there yet.
4577000	4579000	There's one on Power In.
4579000	4585000	Bobby Blackwolf points out they're opening up in Buckhead, which is quite a drive. Atlanta is two hours away from Atlanta.
4585000	4588000	Okay, so it's like the Bay Area. I get it.
4588000	4592000	You know what, though? They had one here and then in like a couple of years.
4592000	4597000	Well, that one in Midtown's been around forever and then they've just recently exploded.
4597000	4602000	There's like seven or eight of them here, so they might be putting one out in Atlanta now, but give it time.
4602000	4604000	Give it to Peach Tree Center. It's a matter of time.
4604000	4609000	All right, anyway, enough food and advertising for a place that didn't pay for it.
4609000	4611000	Sorry, Dark Sakura. What story did you have for us?
4611000	4617000	I'm eating Del Taco because I wanted junk and it makes me happy.
4617000	4620000	Anyway, how about some Valve stuff?
4620000	4621000	How about it?
4621000	4625000	So we know what remote play together is, right?
4625000	4631000	You know, where basically you can play with other people kind of like they were in the same room with you.
4631000	4635000	So basically local multiplayer over the Internet, in other words.
4635000	4642000	But before you had to have, everyone had to have their own Steam account.
4642000	4649000	Now they've done this sort of streamlining thing where you don't need to have your own Steam account to join in.
4649000	4652000	You just get the invite and you're playing.
4652000	4661000	So it's like if you have friends in, say, places that Steam's not available or you have family members who's like,
4661000	4670000	I don't know why I should install that Steam thing, you know, then they can play with you.
4670000	4679000	And actually right now you can use an early version of it if you sign up for the Steam client beta.
4679000	4686000	I wonder if this also has to do with things like Game Pass and Microsoft's system that kind of exist outside of Steam
4686000	4691000	and being able to kind of connect those together in a way.
4691000	4693000	That's kind of the impression I got.
4693000	4694000	Yeah.
4694000	4700000	So it almost though has a feeling to me that this is something that's kind of been in the works for a little bit.
4700000	4706000	So, well, if cross play is a thing on consoles, then why shouldn't Steam have its own type of cross play, right?
4706000	4707000	Yeah.
4707000	4712000	It's another feature that Google Stadia had that now is kind of obsolete.
4712000	4722000	You know, they have that whole thing where, oh, you could just link your chat or link, you know, your YouTube video or whatever to have people join you.
4722000	4728000	Now a competitor has it with arguably a larger library than they do.
4728000	4729000	Fair.
4729000	4730000	I don't know.
4730000	4731000	Yeah.
4731000	4733000	All right.
4733000	4734000	All right.
4734000	4735000	Well, let's move on.
4735000	4736000	Loki.
4736000	4737000	Yes.
4737000	4743000	So as I was alluding to earlier when we were talking about the PlayStation 5 and having to pick one up probably later this year,
4743000	4756000	Sony has almost very quietly talked about or at least acknowledged that, yes, there will be another VR PlayStation VR coming to the PlayStation 5.
4757000	4769000	They had posted something over on their PlayStation blog saying, introducing the next generation of VR on PlayStation and saying that there's going to be obviously a new controller developed for it,
4769000	4774000	which makes sense because they have that whole DualSense stuff that they'd want, of course, incorporate do that.
4774000	4782000	And of course, I'd imagine that, you know, higher spec hardware as well to take advantage of the PlayStation 5.
4782000	4791000	But other than the brief mention of like some of the stuff that's expected, you know, we don't really have a timeframe aside from that.
4791000	4798000	They're still in development and it won't be launching in 2021, but maybe 2022.
4798000	4799000	Who knows?
4799000	4800000	But yeah.
4800000	4802000	So I'm excited about that.
4802000	4806000	Definitely want to hear some more information about what's coming for that.
4806000	4810000	But yeah, it has me interested.
4810000	4812000	So this is one of those things that I play.
4812000	4820000	We know we knew it's been coming, but now they've kind of like validated it, you know, and like we knew this was happening when.
4820000	4824000	But it's also nice to hear the like Sony isn't like they're still invested in VR.
4824000	4834000	And I think that's the good news is that, you know, there may be some people that were thinking, oh, they're just not going to do VR on PlayStation 5 because Sony likes to walk away from hardware just when it's finding its potential.
4834000	4835000	Vita.
4836000	4842000	So this is good news that Sony is at least saying, hey, we're committed doing this.
4842000	4844000	We're going to do a VR thing on the PlayStation 5.
4844000	4847000	We're just not doing it right now, which makes sense.
4847000	4850000	Most people still can't even get a PlayStation 5.
4850000	4852000	And I said this in the very beginning when they launched the system.
4852000	4858000	You're not going to charge somebody five hundred dollars for a PlayStation 5 and at the same time charge them five hundred dollars for a headset.
4858000	4862000	You know, and I'm just I'm just completely speculating these prices.
4862000	4864000	Don't quote me on them.
4864000	4869000	You got to spread that out a little bit to make the pain a little easier on dropping all that money at once.
4869000	4875000	So they've got to get that PlayStation 5 price cut once at least first.
4875000	4877000	And then maybe they can think about that VR headset.
4877000	4881000	But it is nice that it'll be less cables and awkward setup, too.
4881000	4886000	They've certainly, I'm sure, designed the PlayStation 5.
4886000	4887000	Excuse me.
4887000	4894000	With the idea in mind that it would have a VR thing eventually, I'm sure.
4894000	4896000	So we would hope.
4896000	4903000	Yeah. S.H.A. 100 Matt in our chat over Twitch TV slash Vogue Network says, I mean, we knew they were working on PSVR.
4903000	4906000	Sony is also working on PlayStation 6.
4906000	4909000	I would hope they provide more updates for it soon.
4909000	4913000	Yes. Sony is absolutely working on PlayStation 6.
4913000	4916000	We just won't hear anything about it for another seven years, probably.
4916000	4920000	So. Yeah. All right.
4920000	4926000	And that'll maybe have VR, too, or maybe maybe PlayStation 6 will just straight up run the holodeck.
4926000	4930000	Because remember, everything in gaming is just one step closer to the holodeck.
4930000	4933000	We said that for a very long time on the show. Don't want you to forget that.
4933000	4936000	Everything in gaming is just one step closer to the holodeck.
4936000	4938000	All right.
4938000	4943000	Everything in gaming is also apparently going to be coming to PC.
4943000	4949000	Speaking of PlayStation and some of the things they're doing, it was right around the same time they made this VR announcement.
4949000	4954000	They mentioned that more games are going to be coming to PC from PlayStation.
4954000	4957000	I believe the quote was a whole slate.
4957000	4960000	Now, they haven't given a lot of details, save for one big game.
4960000	4963000	Days Gone will be coming out this spring.
4963000	4967000	You might remember that one was out about a year ago on PlayStation 4.
4967000	4971000	And that was a Sony exclusive that they hyped up at a couple of E3s.
4971000	4973000	And that is going to be coming to PC.
4973000	4986000	And you might remember people were saying, well, why is Horizon Zero Dawn coming out for PlayStation or, excuse me, for PC and all these other PlayStation exclusives?
4986000	4993000	And honestly, you know, I think we have to remember that PlayStation isn't just in the business of selling hardware.
4993000	4995000	They're in the business of selling games.
4995000	4999000	And I think there comes a certain point where the games aren't selling.
4999000	5006000	Like, I'm sure a game like Days Gone has pretty much sold about the most that it's going to on the PlayStation 4.
5006000	5015000	So it's time to open it up to a new audience by putting it out on PC because PlayStation Sony also makes money by developing and publishing their own games.
5015000	5024000	So this is a way for them to get more money from the games that they've developed by putting them out on PC.
5024000	5031000	Because being on PC can also, and this is very important, reach markets that maybe PlayStation isn't officially available in.
5031000	5039000	PC gaming is pretty much everywhere, you know, unless the government forbids it for whatever reason or is censored it.
5039000	5044000	Otherwise, you know, PC gaming can go around the globe pretty quickly.
5044000	5051000	But PlayStation and official retail releases of things, well, you might have imports and stuff like that, but it's not necessarily going to be on the shelf.
5051000	5055000	Or not necessarily going to be easy to find or cheap at a reasonable price.
5055000	5058000	PC may be the reasonable way for people to play it.
5058000	5063000	And then, of course, nude mods. No, but regular mods, too, are very important.
5063000	5065000	And, you know, the PC community loves that stuff.
5065000	5070000	What's your take on all this PC stuff coming, or PlayStation stuff coming to PC?
5070000	5072000	I keep getting it backwards in my mind. Logie?
5072000	5079000	I mean, I think it's fine. I think, to your point, you know, it is a good way to drive some more sales.
5079000	5085000	I mean, obviously, Days Gone was a pretty decent title, but it's pretty old at this point.
5085000	5091000	So it makes sense to try to port it out to another console to, or not even necessarily the console,
5091000	5096000	but another platform to basically, you know, drive some more interest in it.
5096000	5100000	And so, yeah, it makes perfect sense that they would do that.
5100000	5108000	Yeah. All right. Well, this is where I would move on to the next segment, but DarkSaka had the AFK, and the next segment is her segment.
5108000	5115000	So I have extra time. Oh, DarkSaka just came back. Perfect timing, DarkSaka. It's about time for your segment. Hi.
5115000	5119000	Hi. Yeah, the one problem, things make me sick.
5119000	5125000	That's all right. All right. Let's get into the classic game of the week. All right.
5125000	5133000	Every week, DarkSaka steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, kids, you might enjoy this game.
5133000	5138000	Actually, maybe, maybe not the kids this time. I'll let DarkSaka explain here momentarily.
5138000	5139000	And people with taste.
5139000	5147000	It is the classic game of the week. And look, it's not, and it's, and it's important to state, it's not always classic good.
5148000	5155000	Maybe I should just let DarkSaka take over. It's notable. It's notable. DarkSaka, what is the classic game of the week?
5155000	5163000	It was my very last minute pick because I forgot it was still February. So it's BMX triple X.
5163000	5170000	Awesome. Now, I do want to state for those on Twitch, we are not allowed to play footage from BMX triple X.
5170000	5174000	It is on Twitch's banned list of games. Please.
5174000	5178000	What is this? Never mind. It's not the cat I thought it was.
5178000	5187000	OK, please enjoy this replacement video while DarkSaka talks about BMX triple X.
5187000	5192000	No, I there's a channel I watch that's Rachel and June. They live in Japan.
5192000	5196000	And when he goes to the store on his bicycle, his cat's in the basket.
5196000	5203000	Oh, OK. No, I think this guy's in Greece. But anyway, let's talk about BMX triple X.
5203000	5213000	All right. So it is a sports game that was developed by Z-axis and published by Acclaim under their A.K.A. Acclaim label.
5213000	5220000	It came out on Xbox, PlayStation 2 and GameCube. It was released in North America.
5220000	5232000	The first released Xbox was November 12th, 2002 for PlayStation 2, November 19th and GameCube November 26th of the same year.
5232000	5237000	So. This game.
5237000	5242000	It was basically huh, if you want to call it great.
5242000	5248000	It was this game. I enjoyed it thoroughly. It was an actual fun BMX game.
5248000	5252000	All right. I'm sorry. I shouldn't interrupt. Sorry, Jamie. All right.
5252000	5258000	So basically the game I have to start a little bit with the beginning.
5258000	5267000	OK, so it was built on an earlier Z-axis game, Dave Mirra freestyle BMX that was endorsed by Dave Mirra.
5267000	5277000	But during the development of the new game, because they wanted the game to be.
5277000	5287000	You know, I guess a little bit more appealing to certain audiences, they wanted to style it after some sex comedy type movie view thing.
5287000	5295000	So and they really came to this when they saw that the game was actually turning out to be pretty subpar.
5295000	5310000	So instead of, you know, calling it a loss, they decided to throw in all of this vulgar humor and nakedness and to try to bring some publicity to it.
5310000	5317000	Because as we know, sex sells anyway. When Mirra found out about it, he's like, no, I'm not going to endorse this.
5317000	5324000	And he actually took legal action against a claim to keep his name completely away from it.
5324000	5331000	And he was successful in getting a claim to prevent them from using his name.
5331000	5338000	So going back to the game itself, it is a predominantly BMX based game.
5338000	5350000	It allows you to create female characters who are topless and it has live action video of strippers.
5350000	5355000	I didn't think it was a good game. I mean, honestly, I really didn't think it was a good game.
5355000	5363000	I didn't enjoy it. The few times that I played it, you know, had kind of a little bit of a like a GTA vibe in some parts of it.
5363000	5369000	From what I could tell. I just didn't enjoy it. Anyway, you know.
5369000	5376000	Of course, I also think that most most shirtless people, doesn't matter of what persuasion they are, kind of squicks me out.
5376000	5385000	So just saying. But anyway, because of all of this, the game was initially denied classification in Australia.
5385000	5390000	They wouldn't class classify it in the US or North America in general.
5390000	5396000	The game was uncensored on GameCube and Xbox.
5396000	5404000	But for the PS2 version, it is censored. There was a lot of publicity for the game,
5404000	5412000	but it was mostly really negative and had really poor reviews, really poor sales.
5412000	5423000	However, it was semi salvaged into a Game Boy Advance game called Dave Muir Freestyle BMX3 that didn't have any of the raunchiness.
5423000	5430000	It was just a straight up game. And yeah, I mean, there was scandal around this, too.
5430000	5437000	I mean, I mean, you're going to have scandal, I think, when you have a game like this.
5437000	5440000	You know, people, you're going to get your prudes out there.
5440000	5447000	You're going to get your, you know, your tipper gores of the world, if you will.
5447000	5455000	To protest it, to talk shit about it, you know.
5455000	5462000	And it just really, the game didn't make any sense, you know.
5462000	5465000	You do tricks, but you're naked.
5465000	5470000	I mean, that's it.
5470000	5472000	All right.
5472000	5476000	It's not good. It's not good.
5476000	5477000	So, Loki.
5477000	5481000	I mean, maybe it helped advertise some New York strip clubs.
5481000	5485000	I got banned from, like, Walmart and Toys R Us.
5485000	5489000	And Twitch. I can't show you the game.
5489000	5490000	I'm talking about for sale.
5490000	5494000	I even wanted to know if I could show you the game for, like, critique purposes.
5494000	5502000	But, like, I actually looked at the rules and it said, like, you can report a stream that's, like, just playing it at all.
5502000	5505000	So I was like, well, all right, I guess I'm going with a cat then.
5505000	5509000	Which is, you know, usually a good call is that when in doubt, just go with a cat.
5509000	5511000	But, hmm.
5511000	5512000	There's more.
5512000	5513000	Okay.
5513000	5519000	So, an executive producer, formerly of Acclaim, named Sean Rosen.
5519000	5521000	And this is a quote from him.
5521000	5525000	It's like, you know, when you get a whole bunch of guys in a room, people start throwing out stupid ideas.
5525000	5528000	So we're talking, okay, maybe we should go for a mature rating.
5528000	5529000	What does mature mean?
5529000	5532000	We'll have some hardcore music and maybe language in it.
5532000	5536000	And then someone said, let's put strippers in the game and everyone laughs.
5536000	5546000	So, basically, it's, as to quote him, I mean, it's a bunch of dumb guys in a room throwing out ideas.
5546000	5549000	So, I.
5549000	5551000	Go ahead.
5551000	5552000	Yeah.
5552000	5563000	So some folks in chat are making comparisons to the guy game, which was also out around the same time, that was definitely, like, catered for a certain audience, we'll say.
5563000	5565000	And I noticed Shane is in chat.
5565000	5573000	Shad Starsick says the guy game was, yeah, it was bad, but sometimes in a train wreck sort of way that I just couldn't stop watching.
5573000	5576000	That kind of sums up BMX, triple X for me.
5576000	5582000	I think like this game wasn't good, but it was one of those things where it was like, how did this get made?
5582000	5590000	Well, it's basically like crossing a BMX game with Postal.
5590000	5596000	It's like, you know, trying to be like edgy, you know, in the sense that it's just ridiculous stuff.
5596000	5597000	Yeah.
5597000	5601000	But like it was going that route, like, oh, hey, look, haha, we're doing this on purpose.
5601000	5603000	Look, they're doing it because they could.
5603000	5605000	Look, it's animals having sex.
5605000	5606000	Oh, my goodness.
5606000	5607000	Who?
5607000	5608000	That's that's that's edgy.
5608000	5609000	You know.
5609000	5610000	Oh, look, you're getting a bum.
5610000	5612000	Some some alcohol edgy.
5612000	5615000	You know, it's I know it's.
5615000	5616000	Well, it was OK.
5616000	5623000	It was frustrating to do some tricks, but like I was trying to play, but it I was going to say this game.
5623000	5632000	This game is is not that old where I remember when you and I were roommates in absolutely two hours on a GameCube because I want the uncensored version.
5632000	5635000	Two or three years into O.L.R.
5635000	5638000	I remember you getting the BMX triple X game.
5638000	5642000	But you also you also have an affinity for bad games.
5643000	5645000	Oh, yes, of course, I do.
5645000	5652000	So so how would this be a classic game for you and why?
5652000	5655000	I mean, it wasn't even really rememberable.
5655000	5658000	I mean, it was it's it's all right.
5658000	5659000	It was fun.
5659000	5660000	It wasn't terrible.
5660000	5663000	Like the guy game was kind of terrible.
5663000	5668000	And I don't know, at least this had some gameplay to it.
5668000	5672000	Well, there's a little bit more to this, too.
5672000	5679000	And this is, again, another quote, actually, from one of the employees at Z-axis.
5679000	5682000	And I do also want to read this verbatim.
5682000	5687000	One thing that and this is actually coming from a Vice article, an older Vice article.
5687000	5693000	One thing that is a common misconception in the game industry itself is that if an independent developer makes a game, that is their idea.
5693000	5697000	They stand behind it. They believe in all the content they're making it for themselves.
5697000	5701000	No, we were paid by a claim to make BMX triple X.
5701000	5711000	As much as people think that the people at Z-axis were crazy for coming up with this idea, we were contracted to make this idea.
5711000	5713000	So blame a claim.
5713000	5720000	It's almost like the movie Showgirls were like everybody wanted to distance themselves away from it once it came out.
5720000	5726000	Yeah. Anyway, but at least at least Showgirls has found appreciation as a cult movie all these years later.
5726000	5730000	And Elizabeth Berkley, in many ways, is kind of a gay icon of sorts.
5730000	5736000	I'm not sure this game will have that same love ever.
5736000	5740000	You mean we're not going to get a remake of it like we did with Tony Hawk?
5740000	5746000	I'm thinking no, but maybe that Game Boy Advance game that was OK, the Dark Saga mentioned, maybe that one.
5746000	5749000	I'd say that one's first.
5749000	5756000	All right. There it is. Your classic Game of the Week BMX triple X.
5756000	5765000	Or as those that were watching on Twitch tonight got to see BMX triple cat, which folks are saying should be a dream game.
5765000	5768000	BMX triple cat, which I think.
5768000	5771000	OK, I have the new dream game idea, Rob.
5771000	5773000	All right. Go for it.
5773000	5777000	BMX cat courier. You have to deliver the cat to its new location.
5777000	5782000	You're like a cat taxi, so it's like crazy taxi, but with bikes and cats.
5782000	5786000	Exactly. I'm into it. Does the offspring provide the soundtrack?
5786000	5789000	Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
5789000	5793000	OK, cat taxi. Exactly the way the fifth fifth dream said it.
5793000	5795000	C, A, T, A, X, I.
5795000	5800000	Taxi. I thought a taxi would be the name of it.
5800000	5802000	Doesn't come off as well.
5802000	5806000	The cat version of the offspring song really makes the entire game for me.
5806000	5809000	Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
5809000	5819000	It's like, you know, you know how they have the the like the the cat, you know, Christmas, whatever thing.
5819000	5824000	Yeah, the cat sing. Yeah, it would be that they do that with all the music in the game.
5824000	5829000	It's all just cats. It's just like having those artists, you know, come back and cover their songs.
5829000	5834000	But you would just do it in like, you know, caddish, I guess, or meows.
5834000	5839000	Tiger Claw says they have skate bird. Why not make skate cat? Because we want bike cat.
5839000	5845000	But you do ask the question. Bob Coffee in chat says you have to keep the cat happy and there's a meter that tracks this.
5845000	5853000	Well, just like the guy in the video, you have to have a little toy that you entertain the cat with once in a while or something to make sure it doesn't try to jump out of the bike.
5853000	5855000	And then there's like the idea.
5855000	5864000	And you know, I hate to say this, but this has already been done before.
5864000	5868000	So like, I would like to have more for my idea.
5868000	5874000	OK, that when when the cat is unhappy, he'll jump out of the basket and try to run away.
5874000	5880000	And then you have panic mode where you have to find the cat. And so that's hurting cats mode.
5881000	5888000	I want to know what's the game that already exists, Loki, and does it have the meow based soundtrack?
5888000	5893000	It doesn't it's so it is basically a part of Saints Row the third.
5893000	5898000	It's a tiger escort mission and you have to drive the tiger around.
5898000	5903000	And if you don't do it right, he will get angry and attack you. So he is right.
5904000	5907000	There are no BMX fights and no adorable house cats.
5907000	5915000	But if you said cat taxis, then the Saints Row team needs to make this game because they've already started it.
5915000	5918000	And it's going to sell better than that agents of mayhem.
5918000	5922000	I guarantee it. No, that's a low bar the hit.
5922000	5926000	All right. Moving on. All right. Let's move on.
5926000	5931000	I do love what was that crazy cat. See, that's my name for it.
5931000	5936000	All right. Let's move on and talk about some actual news going on in the gaming industry.
5936000	5939000	We'll talk about it a little quickly in the segment we call rapid fire news.
5939000	5944000	Loki, let's talk about some games we get for pain with our online memberships.
5944000	5947000	So we have games of gold for March.
5947000	5954000	So starting off Warface Breakout and Vicious Attack Llama Apocalypse.
5954000	5956000	That's a great name.
5956000	5961000	Those are going to be your Xbox Series X and Xbox One titles for the month.
5961000	5968000	Then, of course, for Xbox 360 backwards compatible games, Metal Slug 3 and Port Royale 3.
5968000	5973000	And then on the PlayStation side of things, we have Maquette on PlayStation 5.
5973000	5981000	PlayStation 4 is getting Final Fantasy 7 remake and remnant from the ashes and from PlayStation VR Farpoint,
5981000	5984000	which is a pretty decent shooter from what I hear.
5984000	5990000	And then also, much like the end of 2020 and the beginning of this year,
5990000	5994000	they're going to be continuing their play at home initiative that they're doing.
5994000	5999000	So they were giving some big AAA titles out on PlayStation 5 for free.
5999000	6005000	So it's going to continue with, of course, the new Ratchet and Clank game.
6005000	6008000	So that's going to be pretty awesome. Yeah, Ratchet and Clank.
6008000	6013000	So they're the PlayStation 4 remake is what they're going to be giving out.
6013000	6021000	And I guess to kind of get you hyped up for Rip the Part, which is going to be coming out in June.
6021000	6025000	So, cool. All right.
6025000	6030000	That's pretty cool that they're giving away kind of that additional free game without even having to have plus.
6030000	6032000	I mean, there's nothing forcing Sony to do that.
6032000	6041000	They're just doing it at a goodwill to keep people at home just a little bit longer while we try to get through the rest of this and get everybody vaccinated.
6041000	6047000	All right. Moving on, some other rapid fire news. I swear to God, everything has come to Fortnite recently.
6047000	6052000	We've what? We've had Master Chief. We've had Kratos. Tron got a thing.
6052000	6055000	What was it? Oh, Street Fighter got a thing recently.
6055000	6060000	Guess what we're getting now? Because Fortnite is now just pop culture orgy the game.
6060000	6068000	I don't think it ties in with their theme for this season, which is kind of like if you want to compare it to the MCU,
6068000	6074000	it's like the multiverse thing. So they're just pulling things out of all different franchises or it's an excuse to just hodgepodge.
6074000	6079000	How convenient. How convenient of a story to get away with stuff like this.
6079000	6090000	But you know what? I will say, if nothing else, this is pretty cool because joining Fortnite is Ripley, as in from the Alien film, as in Sigourney.
6090000	6096000	Yeah, as in Sigourney Weaver, who's who's what, 71, I think, and still looks phenomenal.
6096000	6103000	But this is Ripley based off the 70s Alien movies and Xenomorph is coming as well.
6103000	6109000	So these are skins that you can purchase because, of course, they're not going to give these away for free through the item shop.
6109000	6116000	There's also an emote called Burst Case Scenario, and we'll let you imagine what happens in that.
6116000	6122000	But hint, it has to do with the Alien films. All this Final Fantasy 7 news this week.
6122000	6130000	There is one other little thing you should know about. The Final Fantasy 7 remake soundtrack is now out on all the big streaming services.
6130000	6140000	So if you're a Spotify person, an Apple music person, an Amazon music person, whatever it is, enjoy the Final Fantasy 7 remake soundtrack because it's pretty fucking good.
6140000	6151000	And I think a lot of people were waiting for official releases of these musics to come out or at least hit the streaming services, which is what a lot of us are a lot of us are using these days.
6151000	6155000	So check that out on your favorite streaming service if you haven't already.
6155000	6157000	Dark Sakura.
6157000	6169000	Well, a place that I have actually always enjoyed is the the Pinball Museum in Las Vegas, you know, which is actually a 501 C3.
6169000	6174000	Sorry, something disagreed with me. It's a nonprofit.
6174000	6181000	And basically, you know, they they were living on donations or what people would pay for for getting into that.
6181000	6187000	And any leftovers were donated to a questionable charity. I won't name it.
6187000	6191000	But they were you know, they were actually planning on moving on to the strip.
6191000	6198000	And as it turns out, with COVID, that prevented them from being able to do anything.
6198000	6206000	And in fact, they were they might have had to have shuttered had it not been for a man named Stephen Campbell in town.
6206000	6212000	He had a YouTube page on YouTube called Not Leaving Las Vegas.
6212000	6219000	And so he helped raise nearly eighty thousand dollars to help them.
6219000	6227000	And. The hand of the check over, I mean, basically, so they are going to be moving to the strip.
6227000	6236000	They have a very great retail space, they said, and they said that they're going to be able to pay the bills,
6236000	6243000	get the building done and open well within their their originally planned budget.
6243000	6250000	So it's going to be really good. And they're having a food truck fundraiser if you are in Las Vegas, the current place.
6250000	6254000	However, it's already happened because it was today. So.
6254000	6260000	I wonder where in other news. Yeah, I mean, it's actually, you know, pretty, pretty cool.
6260000	6266000	And then in other news, there's a Frogger TV game show coming to Peacock streaming service.
6267000	6275000	And it sounds terrible to make Frogger happen, as most Konami products are these days.
6275000	6279000	It's going to be American contestants, but it's in Australia.
6279000	6288000	And basically they have to go through an obstacle course to dodge traffic, leap over gators and hungry hippos.
6288000	6292000	I'm like, except they're, you know, foam rubber.
6292000	6297000	So, yeah. OK, Frogger TV show.
6297000	6305000	This sounds like one of those like Wipeout American warrior type of shows.
6305000	6308000	They all have roots in Takeshi Castle. Yeah.
6308000	6314000	It sounds like another one of those kind of shows to me. It is just a quick aside before we get into the release dates.
6314000	6321000	Like, you know, these streaming services are really just I mean, we had Disney plus unveil a bunch of stuff a few weeks ago.
6321000	6325000	And then this week was a lot of information about Paramount Plus.
6325000	6332000	It might have been a little bit last week as well. But, you know, Paramount Plus is just CBS all access going through a branding change.
6332000	6335000	So I already have the CBS thing because Star Trek, you know.
6335000	6342000	So I'm going to be just converted to this Paramount Plus, but they've got a lot of stuff coming to this.
6342000	6349000	Controversially, a new season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars will only be on Paramount Plus, which means it's going to get pirated to hell.
6349000	6352000	But that's their problem, I guess. So that's interesting.
6352000	6356000	I'm also I think it's still going to restream on Apple TV, though.
6356000	6359000	Oh, yeah, I think for the sub services. Yeah.
6359000	6363000	Like the sub sub services, like people buy them on iTunes and stuff or Amazon.
6363000	6366000	I think that that'll still exist for sure.
6366000	6370000	But as far as I there might still be like a little bit of a window type of thing.
6370000	6373000	But yeah, I'm pretty sure that'll all still exist.
6373000	6378000	But I was super interested in they're doing a real world reunion.
6378000	6381000	That's like I mean, that show was like 30 years ago.
6381000	6384000	It was a lot. I was in high school when that show first came out.
6384000	6385000	How old are these people going to be?
6385000	6388000	They're they're pushing their forty nine fifty fifty one.
6388000	6391000	They're right in that they're in their like fifties.
6391000	6397000	But if you think about it, Loki, like I have some hard truths for us here at Orange Tons Radio.
6397000	6408000	Those folks in the real world cast in their fifties are closer to our age than a lot of the twenty one and twenty two year olds that make shows like Big Brother and Survivor these days.
6408000	6422000	So the reality is that's a little closer. But I I'm kind of I'm interested to see people that are a little more representative of like, you know, that that kind of shift from Generation X to millennials that are kind of in that area.
6422000	6429000	I guess these guys are a little more cemented in Gen X. But still, I'm kind of excited to see like a reality show that kind of focuses on that.
6429000	6437000	And just because, you know, especially that show, whether you love or hate reality TV, this was this was back when they were casting real people.
6437000	6441000	I mean, the people that were on that show were real people later seasons of the real world.
6441000	6449000	Not so much. But those first, we'll say, seven or eight seasons of the real world were pretty real people.
6449000	6452000	And it was a very interesting show.
6452000	6458000	It was later on in the series when it, you know, became a clusterfuck and it's it's not worth your time.
6458000	6463000	Yeah. Oh, and I forgot. I guess New Orleans was what, like nine.
6463000	6473000	I think that was right around whenever that that Vegas season, which I think was the 10th, that was when the show really shifted from real people to.
6473000	6478000	Like real actors, Jerry Springer rejects.
6478000	6483000	That's when there was a shift, there was that Vegas season, which I think was around 10.
6483000	6489000	You know which one I really liked the best? Which one? None of them.
6489000	6493000	Oh, she's different. All right.
6493000	6497000	Let's say you're not a you're not a puck fan.
6497000	6501000	No, he was he was not not nice. Anyway, let's move bigger.
6502000	6507000	Although the real world, San Francisco was probably the best season they ever had.
6507000	6510000	But I might be a little biased. Anyway, let's move on back to games.
6510000	6514000	Let's travel around the world and check out some games that'll be coming out soon.
6514000	6518000	World release dates. Loki, what's coming on us?
6518000	6526000	Yeah. So we've got Harvest Moon, One World, and that's coming out on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation four.
6526000	6530000	Neptunia Virtual Stars on PlayStation four.
6530000	6539000	Maquette, as we mentioned, which is part of the free PlayStation Plus stuff coming out on PlayStation five, PlayStation four and PC.
6539000	6543000	Yakuza Like a Dragon out on PlayStation five.
6543000	6549000	Our No Surge DX on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation four.
6549000	6557000	We have CL No Surge on DX. That's also a PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation four.
6557000	6563000	Nozia on Nintendo Switch. Loop Hero on PC, Mac and Linux.
6563000	6569000	Mortal Shell Enhanced Edition on PlayStation five and Xbox Series X.
6569000	6574000	Sea of Solitude Director's Cut on Nintendo Switch.
6574000	6582000	Ironically, when we were talking about BMX Triple X, we have Postal Redux coming out on PlayStation four and two point hospital.
6582000	6587000	Jumbo edition on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one. That's it.
6587000	6591000	All right. Traveling to Japan and checking out the releases on the switch.
6591000	6595000	Loki mentioned these for the US and they're really the only releases in Japan this week.
6595000	6600000	That's CL No Surge DX and are no surge DX. Those are out in Japan this week as well.
6600000	6604000	That is on the Nintendo Switch. Checking the PlayStation five.
6604000	6609000	Yakuza Like a Dragon gets its release on the PlayStation five this week in Japan.
6609000	6616000	And then on the PlayStation four, we have those same games I mentioned on the switch.
6616000	6621000	And that's really it. It's kind of a slower week in Japan, although not empty for sure.
6621000	6623000	Dark Sakura, how about the UK?
6623000	6630000	We have on the second, Monster Jam Steel Titans 2, Yakuza Like a Dragon for PS5.
6630000	6640000	On the fourth, we have Sea of Solitude for Switch, New Super Lucky Tail, Galgun 2, Vectronom.
6640000	6645000	I'm sorry, I could not pronounce that for a second. That's on the fifth, by the way.
6645000	6653000	We have On the Road Truck Simulator, Evil Land Legendary Edition, Externum EX, Dex,
6653000	6663000	Two Point Hospital Jumbo Edition, Forum slash Twilight Path, Harvest Moon One World,
6663000	6671000	Hellpoint, Iris Falls, and Re Zero, the Prophecy of the Throne.
6671000	6677000	All right, we got a few more stories for you guys before we get to our listener roundtable with the mailbag
6677000	6682000	and your comments in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
6682000	6684000	But first, Loki with another story.
6684000	6695000	Yeah, so Epic is now settling a class action lawsuit with loot boxes by handing out fake money.
6695000	6704000	So they're handing out a thousand V-Bucks to anybody who has purchased a random loot llama.
6704000	6711000	And apparently this was for US players only, but they've expanded it to the entire world.
6711000	6716000	Gee, I wonder if it's to hook people into buying more of these random loot boxes.
6716000	6721000	Or the pop culture orgy they've got going on in the game right now.
6721000	6730000	Exactly. Or and then along with that, though, also, if you had purchased an event crate or key for Rocket League,
6730000	6738000	you will also receive 1000 Rocket League credits as well as part of the same settlement.
6738000	6747000	Cool, I guess. I mean, I don't know. It's about the same amount of money that you would have gotten either way.
6747000	6752000	So which is nothing. Cool.
6752000	6761000	Sometimes a digital product settles this, though, like remember way back the PlayStation three and the lawsuits over removing the other OS feature.
6761000	6767000	And what what did people get out of that? They got like two free games out of a possible list of five.
6767000	6773000	You remember that whole thing? I mean, if you think about it, as much as we kind of giggle about, they're not really giving anything away by giving.
6773000	6778000	I mean, that's kind of what Sony did. They gave away their own currency when they when they got.
6778000	6783000	So this is not the first time we've seen a resolution like this, as silly as it is.
6783000	6788000	So, yeah. All right. That's that, I guess. All right.
6788000	6797000	Well, you know, with all the news that's been a little bit on Stadia, I think a lot of people are looking to Microsoft and what's going on with their streaming service.
6798000	6805000	Well, apparently some things have been you know, they've got like a beta going on right now and more and more is kind of leaking out and stuff.
6805000	6810000	But we also know that they are testing 1080p Xbox Game Pass streaming.
6810000	6817000	I mean, that's not 4K, but still. And there might even be other stuff for PC remote play anyway.
6817000	6824000	720p is what it does now on the phone, but they're actually testing 1080p streams.
6824000	6828000	Don't know how widespread that testing is. It's just something that is showing up for certain people.
6828000	6832000	But that's going to be great, especially when it comes to some of the big screen games.
6832000	6840000	Also, there was a leak from a Twitter user, Tom Warren, that actually showed some of the xCloud app for Windows.
6840000	6850000	So this is going to be like a Windows app that you use and you can actually stream to your PC, which was something you could do on the console companion app.
6850000	6854000	But this is going to allow you to do it like through the cloud and stuff. So this would be very interesting.
6854000	6863000	I'm very excited to see kind of what the future holds for Microsoft streaming. I like the concept that I'm streaming my own console.
6863000	6870000	So like even if I'm on my phone and you know, at some point, 5G is going to become more and more prevalent, right?
6870000	6876000	And more people are going to have those kinds of phones. More people are going to be able to have access to that kind of data in certain cities.
6876000	6884000	And over a 5G connection, I could probably connect to my Xbox here at home and play games when I'm somewhere else.
6884000	6897000	So and, you know, it's probably not going to be great for things like Halo and stuff, but, you know, for things that are a little bit less intensive, like maybe like Overcooked I mentioned earlier in the show.
6897000	6902000	I could play that, but it would be from my Xbox, my save file, my achievements and all that stuff.
6902000	6906000	So I'm I'm very interested to see how Microsoft kind of continues to bring this to the table.
6906000	6910000	It's going to be interesting to have cloud gaming in these different ways.
6910000	6920000	And it's not just a computer in the cloud running the game for you, although that is a thing, too. So kind of neat.
6920000	6925000	All right. Moving on, Dar Sakura.
6925000	6930000	Well, you know, the science part of gaming is totally my jam.
6930000	6949000	And there are some researchers at Uber, AI labs in San Francisco that have created some learning algorithms for AI that proved to be better at playing classic video games than human players or any other AI player that existed.
6949000	6953000	Basically, and by the way, they published it in a journal called Nature.
6953000	6966000	So what they did to make it different is something that they think they can have apply to robotics, language processing and even possibly the creation of new medicines.
6966000	6970000	So they're using reinforcement learning algorithms.
6970000	6975000	What it does is it synthesizes information provided in a large data set.
6975000	6980000	So it recognizes patterns and uses them to make guesses about new data.
6980000	6997000	And, you know, they've used this, for example, they've used this to spot lung cancer and X-rays, but they were they ran into some some walls with that when they found data that didn't fit with everything else in the data set.
6997000	7001000	So it would bring back some wrong, wrong results.
7001000	7010000	So they added another algorithm that lets it remember the paths that a previous algorithm took when it's trying to solve a problem.
7010000	7019000	They have implemented this test by having their AI play 55 Atari games.
7019000	7024000	And then they did the testing through those AI systems with that.
7024000	7035000	So the new system beat the other AIs 85.5 percent of the time and did really well at Montezuma's Revenge, by the way.
7035000	7051000	But they you know, but they're saying that since it's learning from its past mistakes, that this particular algorithm now, when applied to, you know, other fields is going to let it explore new paths that would have just been,
7051000	7058000	you know, returned, you know, invalid or incorrect based on that new data.
7058000	7071000	Instead, it's going to learn from what it's done already based and base how it treats the new data around things that have and have not worked.
7071000	7073000	Little scary, really awesome.
7073000	7082000	Yeah, yeah, because I was joking with Bobby before the show tonight. We were doing the tossover call. I said the Cylons are learning more because that's kind of Skynet.
7082000	7087000	Yeah, exactly right. Like the Cylons are going to beat us at Frogger soon.
7087000	7091000	It's the it's the MCP, the master control program.
7091000	7095000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's started off as a chess game, Rob.
7095000	7096000	I started off as chess.
7096000	7101000	I'm with you. There's part of it that's really neat and there's part of it that's really scary as well.
7101000	7104000	So we'll see or see where this leads us.
7104000	7110000	But the idea of the machine learning from its past mistakes is a very interesting step, for sure.
7110000	7116000	So. All right. Moving on, Loki.
7116000	7122000	Yeah, so it's like what year is this again? We're back in the early 2000s again.
7122000	7130000	But yeah, apparently now because of all the violence in the world, it's got to be video games that's causing the violence.
7130000	7146000	So apparently a Illinois state representative, Marcus Evans Jr., has made an amendment to a statute that passed in 2005 that apparently bans the sale of violent video games to minors.
7146000	7158000	But now he's proposed that instead he would ban the sale of violent video games to buyers of all ages and change the definition of violent video game to include both physical and psychological harm.
7158000	7164000	Of course, who's going to be determining whether it's violent or not?
7164000	7166000	Who knows?
7166000	7169000	It's not going to pass. He's a moron.
7169000	7177000	Well, I don't know, dumber things have happened, but hey, I don't live in Illinois, so I guess that's good for me.
7177000	7190000	Well, look, you know, now we have also a standard that the Supreme Court has set because of what happened with Schwarzenegger versus I don't know what it was, but it was because, you know, California tried a law a long time ago.
7190000	7195000	Now, also, one of the scary things to keep in mind, the Supreme Court is very different now than it was then.
7196000	7199000	So could be interesting, but I still think...
7199000	7201000	I still think there's...
7201000	7204000	There's no studies that support it. That doesn't make any sense.
7204000	7211000	What I think would be more the argument is like, well, you're trying to, you know, you're censoring this stuff.
7211000	7217000	And I don't know, it's just I can't see it being successful.
7217000	7223000	I'm fine with the bill that they have already with borrowing it from minors. That's cool.
7223000	7227000	But from everybody, I'm like, what are you doing?
7227000	7228000	Yeah.
7228000	7230000	Is that applied to movies as well?
7230000	7237000	Well, and that's the thing. I think ultimately that's what it's going to come down to is that you're treating games differently than you're treating all these other mediums.
7237000	7238000	Yeah.
7238000	7243000	But there's no mention of sexual content in there.
7243000	7248000	TV and games seem to be perfectly fine with that, but it's violence they have the problem with.
7250000	7255000	And we don't get as much sexuality and I'm not going to deny it exists.
7255000	7259000	Of course, obviously, you highlighted an excellent example earlier tonight.
7259000	7265000	But it is certainly much more prolific in movies and TV than it is in gaming.
7266000	7275000	So violence is usually associated more with gaming, but that certainly exists in the movie, TV and all that world as well.
7275000	7285000	I mean, again, you know, I'm not a fan of those Saw movies and the horror porn and that stuff is just is worse than a lot of stuff I've seen in games.
7285000	7287000	So, hmm.
7287000	7290000	I just don't understand how one can be OK and the other isn't.
7290000	7291000	So.
7291000	7293000	All right.
7293000	7296000	Moving on one more story for you guys.
7296000	7298000	And yes, it's video gaming related.
7298000	7302000	Didn't you all ever play DJ Hero because that game was awesome.
7302000	7307000	Well, one of the bands that was featured in DJ Hero has announced they are splitting up.
7307000	7310000	And yes, I'm talking about Daft Punk.
7310000	7316000	And they released a video this week called Epilogue where they announced that they are retiring and that came out on Monday.
7316000	7319000	And that's it. Daft Punk is essentially no more.
7319000	7322000	I mean, there could always be a reunion later on, I suppose.
7322000	7325000	But it definitely I mean, did you not watch the video?
7325000	7327000	No, I know. I know loaded.
7327000	7330000	I you know what I got from explosion.
7330000	7333000	Come on. Come on. A bitch always has super glue.
7333000	7337000	Give me a break. The Cylons are adapting and learning from their mistakes.
7337000	7341000	Who's to say? I just you know, there's always ways to write in a revival.
7341000	7346000	But anyway, I mean, Daft Punk hasn't really put out their own material in a long time.
7346000	7351000	Now, granted, they've been producing for other people, you know, the weekend, I think owes a bit to Daft Punk and so forth.
7351000	7357000	There's other artists as well. But certainly, you know, one reason why I'm like, I'm fine bringing this up on OLR,
7357000	7360000	even though the DJ hero connection is a bit of a stretch.
7360000	7364000	I definitely think Daft Punk still plays into a very similar type of culture.
7364000	7368000	I think all of us are familiar with the band and probably have liked some of their stuff.
7368000	7373000	I know for me, like the Tron legacy soundtrack was life changing.
7373000	7375000	That soundtrack is so good.
7375000	7382000	And it's really sad to think that, you know, if we get a third movie, not only is Jared Leto likely to be in it,
7382000	7385000	but now Daft Punk's not going to be doing the score.
7385000	7390000	I want to give someone else a chance because, you know, Wendy Carlos did a great job with the first movie, too.
7390000	7396000	So maybe there's an artist out there I just haven't thought of with Tron yet that will give us a great third soundtrack.
7396000	7401000	But I got there's that part of me that was hoping for some more Daft Punk meets Tron.
7401000	7405000	And so that's a little bit sad. There it is.
7407000	7410000	Shad Starzik says, who's going to do the next Tron movie soundtrack now?
7410000	7414000	Well, they were a duo and if they've split, one of them could still do it.
7414000	7420000	But I'm of the mindset that there will be a completely new...
7420000	7426000	Because, again, they didn't do the very first movie in the 80s, you know, and Wendy Carlos is still around.
7426000	7432000	And I think she was still, she's still scoring movies in the early...
7432000	7435000	She sent independent work.
7435000	7442000	Didn't she stop by 2010? I don't think she's done much since the early aughts. I could be wrong, but...
7442000	7448000	She did some digital tribute once to a few different string things.
7448000	7451000	I have to double check again because it's been a little bit since I've looked into her career.
7451000	7456000	Yeah, it's been a while too. But my point is they didn't go to her for the second movie.
7456000	7461000	And, you know, I, you know, they went a different direction. I love what they did with Daft Punk.
7461000	7467000	But the original still, the original is over here. Daft Punk's over here. They're both great. They both coexist.
7467000	7475000	So my reasoning is there could be a third person we just, or people we just haven't thought of yet that may also create a great soundtrack.
7475000	7482000	So I need to be able to be open to that idea, even if I'm really never going to warm up to the Jared Leto thing.
7482000	7488000	But I'm just hoping he's going to play a minor character and not a major one. That's my hope.
7488000	7497000	All right. Anyway, Zen Monkey is suggesting Labyrinth from the UK.
7497000	7500000	He mixes video game tracks and his music. He's a genius.
7500000	7505000	You know what? There's a lot of people that could probably do a great job. So we'll see what happens. Who knows? Who knows?
7505000	7511000	Anyway, so Daft Punk is split up. Sad. All right, let's get to our listener roundtable.
7511000	7516000	If you guys have any questions or points you want to raise in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog network.
7516000	7523000	Now is a great time to do it. But we want to get to our mailbag, I think. I don't remember if I saw anything.
7523000	7525000	It's empty. It's empty. Boohoo.
7525000	7534000	Yeah, that means drag race talk, except I kind of stopped watching this season a couple of weeks ago and they didn't even do an episode this week.
7534000	7540000	The episode that they did this week, that was pretty cool. I thought it was talking about how they prepped for, you know, with covid and everything.
7540000	7550000	It was actually pretty cool. Look, when the end of the world comes around, we're going to be left with cockroaches share and season 13 still going because they aren't sending girls home.
7550000	7558000	Like that's that's what's good. But slowly next episode of Snatch Game, Rob.
7558000	7562000	I know. I know. I need to get back on the train and get watching it again.
7562000	7566000	I was watching it the first few weeks. And of course, I missed one week because something else.
7566000	7570000	And then, you know, Twitter spoils me at the end of the day. All right.
7570000	7574000	Send us emails. Participate at orange lounge radio dot com.
7574000	7581000	If you want to have your email read on a future episode of the show again, that is participate at orange lounge radio dot com.
7581000	7587000	Let's check. Last minute stories. Loki, do you have anything you want to share with us?
7587000	7595000	Yeah, I was going to talk about. So remember, we talked a little bit about the cyberpunk hack or the feature product red hat.
7595000	7609000	Yeah. A few weeks ago. Well, apparently because of that hack and locking all the developers has pushed back the updates that they were planning to release for cyberpunk because they haven't had access to their computers for a few weeks.
7609000	7620000	So that's kind of sucks that it's halted progress on those updates. But apparently they're going to be resuming progress on that pretty soon.
7620000	7629000	I mean, I guess it's understandable, even though for that game, it certainly doesn't help the situation they're in.
7629000	7633000	Man, that hacking is a bummer. But as far as we know, no further like that.
7633000	7639000	They really did release the source code to a source that's going to keep it under lock and key because that was part of the agreement.
7639000	7645000	Right. So none of that should be going out there as far as we know. Yeah. Interesting.
7645000	7649000	Anything else you want to share? No, that's about it.
7649000	7654000	All right. I'm looking at chat to see if there's any other comments. I don't see any comments or questions.
7654000	7658000	I'll give it just a couple more minutes. Some folks still talking about the Tron stuff.
7658000	7667000	Tiger Claw saying, I want Junkie XL because he produced a lot of electronic music that's talking about Tron back in the day and became an awesome film composer.
7667000	7672000	That could be an option. Who knows? So he's still doing a lot of soundtracks.
7672000	7678000	In fact, I want to say he's I think he's doing the new Godzilla versus King Kong movie.
7678000	7687000	So he's he's doing the soundtrack for that as well. But yeah, he does a lot. So, I mean, he'd be pretty good or.
7687000	7692000	There's a lot of people that can do some good stuff. There's so many synthwave artists out there and stuff.
7692000	7702000	I mean, you could you can get quite a bit of, you know, stylized stuff or they can even do it in the style of like Daft Punk, you know, that kind of thing.
7703000	7710000	Going back to an earlier kind of topic on the show and also putting the, you know, spin on it.
7710000	7715000	We're talking about Paramount Plus and all the stuff that they're announcing for that.
7715000	7721000	Something I forgot to mention that Halo series that I think was originally being developed for Showtime, if I'm remembering.
7721000	7725000	That's the longer that I know is a long time ago. That is.
7725000	7730000	But Paramount Plus has announced Halo. The Halo series is going to be for them now.
7730000	7737000	So that's interesting. Another thing in their pocket. But I think show a Showtime is part of part of Viacom.
7737000	7745000	So I really feel like Paramount Plus to really, you know, because obviously I think we're all getting sick of new streaming services.
7745000	7749000	Right. Like it seems like I thought this is why we got ready.
7749000	7753000	You know, now everybody's trying to do their own streaming service.
7753000	7759000	But I think if you're going to launch a new one, you really have to come out the gate swinging or else, you know, you're going to flop.
7759000	7763000	And that's why Paramount Plus is like, you know, they are Viacom, essentially.
7763000	7766000	So it's like we're going to bring in the biggest stuff from VH1, Drag Race.
7766000	7772000	We're going to bring in the biggest stuff from MTV, like New Seasons of the Challenge in the real world and that stuff.
7772000	7775000	Oh, and we're going to remake Rugrats.
7775000	7778000	Yeah, we're going to bring in the biggest stuff from Nickelodeon. That's part of Viacom.
7778000	7782000	So this is part of CG Rugrats, CG, was it CG SpongeBob?
7782000	7787000	And this is part of the biggest stuff from Showtime is stealing the Halo series.
7787000	7789000	So it's very interesting.
7789000	7791000	Are they going to bring back or salute your shorts? Guts?
7791000	7800000	Tigerclaw on chat says, Paramount Plus is not really new since it's just CBS All Access rebranded.
7800000	7807000	Yes and no. And let me tell you, this is a CBS All Access person because I have it because I watch Star Trek and other stuff on it.
7807000	7815000	It's actually, we pay a dollar more for CBS All Access and we've been offered to transition to Paramount Plus for $4.99 a month.
7815000	7821000	But we will lose the ability to stream local CBS networks, which is interesting.
7821000	7823000	So there is a key difference there.
7823000	7828000	And I think they said later in the year you can get that back and add it into your Paramount Plus,
7828000	7833000	but it's going to cost more money to get your CBS stations streaming in it again.
7833000	7835000	So there are some differences.
7835000	7839000	It's not just and they're going to have a different app and all this stuff.
7839000	7844000	It's just the account holders are all kind of moving over to a Paramount Plus thing.
7844000	7849000	But it is very much Viacom's, which is, you know, and Paramount is part of that.
7849000	7853000	It's their movie studio. It's very much their thing.
7853000	7855000	And CBS is one part of Viacom.
7855000	7857000	So it's really trying to build a bigger thing.
7857000	7859000	I don't want to sound like I'm advertising or endorsing them.
7859000	7863000	I'm just saying this is the reality we're getting yet another streaming service.
7863000	7866000	And this is why, basically.
7868000	7871000	Let's see. Other questions and comments from chat.
7872000	7876000	Fifth Dream says, all I'm saying is the stream quality had better improved.
7876000	7880000	Star Trek looks like shit. It doesn't to me.
7880000	7882000	I wonder if that's something about your connection.
7882000	7884000	Hopefully they'll use different servers then.
7884000	7886000	So I guess there's that.
7888000	7893000	Bobby says, the Star Trek stuff is not disappearing from other services on March 4th.
7893000	7895000	No, it is not.
7895000	7899000	And I think there's still going to be Viacom stuff on other services,
7899000	7901000	like Dark Soccer was saying.
7901000	7907000	Like Drag Race episodes you can still buy on iTunes, Amazon, and I don't see that changing
7907000	7911000	because if there's other ways to take your money, I'm sure they're willing to do it.
7911000	7916000	Oh, and Tigerclaw brings out the movies are only going to have a theatrical window of 45 days
7916000	7918000	and then they're going to go to the streaming service.
7918000	7921000	So this is also very interesting.
7921000	7926000	Anyway, now we have to kind of pick and choose what streaming services do we want.
7926000	7931000	Because I'm kind of like at the point where I'm like there's not a lot on Hulu that I really watch.
7931000	7933000	So maybe I'm going to scale back on that.
7933000	7934000	I don't know.
7934000	7935000	All right.
7937000	7941000	Yeah, Bobby Blackall says this is the a la carte cable model we all wanted.
7943000	7944000	Sort of.
7944000	7945000	Sort of.
7945000	7946000	There's just so many.
7946000	7952000	I understand Netflix could not be the one all be all and that competition is good.
7952000	7954000	There should be a few choices.
7954000	7958000	But now it's just starting to feel like there's so many choices.
7958000	7963000	It's like that gif of Melissa Joan Hart from I think Sabrina the Teenage Wish,
7963000	7967000	which where everybody's putting pancakes and breakfast in front of her all at once.
7967000	7972000	She's like looking around with her fork going, I don't know which one to eat because there's just so damn many of them.
7972000	7973000	And that's you know.
7973000	7975000	But you know what?
7975000	7982000	You can also you also have the right to say fuck all of them and I'm just going to watch YouTube and Twitch.
7982000	7985000	And that's what some people are doing, too.
7985000	7991000	So some could argue that you're only paying for premium content because you want to have premium content.
7991000	7992000	Anyway.
7993000	7994000	All right.
7994000	7995000	Yeah.
7995000	7998000	Pixel pocket says if you're not actively using a service, you can always unsubscribe.
7998000	8002000	Then when a new show comes out, subscribe for that month or two to watch.
8002000	8003000	Yeah.
8003000	8010000	That's why they really try to they try to get you to subscribe for a year at a time so that you're less likely to do that.
8010000	8012000	And DJ Rama S points out trading accounts.
8012000	8013000	Yeah.
8013000	8014000	Yeah.
8014000	8016000	I I've definitely, you know, done that.
8016000	8019000	I'm not going to talk in detail about it, but I know what you're talking about.
8019000	8020000	Wink, wink.
8020000	8021000	So there is that.
8021000	8022000	All right.
8022000	8025000	I think things are wrapping up here.
8025000	8028000	So we're going to wrap up the show.
8028000	8031000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
8031000	8036000	Well, before we do final thoughts, I want to thank you guys very much for listening to Orange Launch Radio tonight.

8061000	8067000	Sharing on social media, auto hosting on Twitch for VOG Network is incredible support.
8067000	8069000	And thank you to everyone that does that.
8069000	8072000	That is a huge, huge boost for us as well.

8083000	8085000	All right. Now I think we're ready for some final thoughts.
8085000	8087000	So let's do it.
8087000	8090000	Loki, why don't we start with you tonight? Your final thought.
8090000	8094000	My final thought is I'm just going to keep working on games.
8094000	8099000	I do want to get started on a new project. Still haven't figured out what I'm going to do yet.
8099000	8106000	I was leaning a little bit towards the NES again because they have a there's an NES game jam happening in March.
8106000	8108000	But I'm not sure if I'm actually going to do that or not.
8108000	8111000	So we'll see. All right.
8111000	8120000	And my final thought is I'm wearing a shirt tonight on Twitch that says live long and prosper because this is the anniversary week of Leonard Nimoy passing.
8120000	8127000	So I will just say rest in peace, but not forgotten. Dark Soccer, your final thought.
8127000	8131000	It is Rainbow Pride Week in Japan.
8131000	8138000	So for Youth Pride, Japan actually is having a big public following on Twitter.
8138000	8143000	So to our Japanese listeners, hi.
8143000	8145000	Hello. All right.
