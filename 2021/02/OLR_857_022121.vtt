00:00.000 --> 00:30.000
Years ago I was watching a compilation of best video game trailers, and all the best ones were for games I've never played and don't have any interest in and I was disappointed about that. Fast forward just a bit and we finally reach the part of the timeline where game universes and other forms of media are getting good. While I'm not a mobile player, I am still delighted to see that Dota 2 is getting its own animated series this year. This is my favorite headline of the night, now it's time for your host,

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring you detail on this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:00.000 --> 01:07.000
I'm Rob Roberts and I'm joined virtually via the magic of Discord with my co-hosts. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Hi, how are you?

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
I don't...

01:13.000 --> 01:19.000
Your internet is a little bit choppy, I think, because you're cutting out a little bit, but that's alright.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
It's like having a Zoom call during work. Are you there? Are you on mute?

01:24.000 --> 01:36.000
Oh my god, I don't even know what's going on because it was affecting work yesterday and my speeds and everything are great, so I think that it's just time to replace this dinosaur.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
Well the good news is the complaining is coming through loud and clear, so I think we have you back.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
All I need to do is bitch about everything then, for fuck's sake.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
When life gives you lemons, ask to speak to life's manager.

01:49.000 --> 02:09.000
Alright, anyway, we were doing a little show and tell before the show tonight and I thought maybe you'd want to show some of our Twitch listeners, or yeah, Twitch viewers of course, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network over at twitch.tv slash vog network, that's VOG Network, at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:09.000 --> 02:24.000
But don't worry, for the podcast folks, I'm not just going to make you sit there in silence. If you subscribe to us on a popular platform like Spotify or iTunes or whatever, Google Podcasts, whatever it is you used to listen to us, I know you can't see, but I'll talk you through it here.

02:24.000 --> 02:37.000
So Dark Sakura has some things. So like, you know, as if this vault, which is more of a metaphorical vault at this point, it's not an actual vault anymore, but we have some new things, right?

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
So Dark Sakura, talk us through some of these, these things you've added to your collection, and where did you get this from?

02:42.000 --> 02:59.000
Well, and right now, I guess my office here is like my nerd cave officially. So back in the day, of course, you know, my husband used to work at a GameStop and GameCrazy, that was the Hollywood video one, and we would acquire some of their advertisement products.

02:59.000 --> 03:06.000
So I'll hold up the first one. It is a ginormous PS2 box for a Parappa the Rapper 2.

03:06.000 --> 03:21.000
I love the giant oversized game boxes. I don't know what it is about them. I like just like fake giant oversized product in general. I guess it reminds me of Supermarket Sweep when they have to grab the large inflatable thing. I don't know. Anyway, what else you got?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
So that was Parappa.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
You ready for number two?

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Yes, I am.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
Oh, what a cool it's a blow up of Busta is that it's Busta Groove, right?

03:30.000 --> 03:37.000
Yeah, it's the US one, of course, because I don't know that. Did they do these in Japan? I don't know. But at any rate, you know, like I was going to pass that shit up.

03:37.000 --> 03:46.000
Oh, yeah, that's that's a keeper right there. I love that one. So it's a giant oversized of that. And then here we go. Maximo.

03:46.000 --> 03:55.000
Yeah, and like Maximo is kind of the maybe a spiritual successor to Ghosts and Goblins, Ghouls and Ghosts.

03:55.000 --> 04:02.000
Which those games are back in the news this week. We'll get into that in just a little bit. We have a very busy intro to our show tonight.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
I love that now. Now give us. So that's the Final Fantasy 10 box for those listening on the podcast.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
And I love that they have the front and the back so somebody could pick that up and pick the giant box up and read the back.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Now you have to give us your best Titus laugh.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
No.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
Jamie's like, I don't have to do anything.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Perfect. Or should I say all right.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
Oh, Kingdom Hearts. Is that one or two? It's Kingdom Hearts one, right? Kingdom hearts. Love it.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
Yep. That's awesome. That game was like brand new the very first week we did.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
Oh, well, I remember that there were some people that were playing through that for the first time. So you ready for the last one?

04:41.000 --> 04:48.000
All right. Yes, I am. Because we've got to introduce. Oh, yes. Final Fantasy seven, the original on PlayStation complete.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
This is probably my most munched one.

04:52.000 --> 04:59.000
But this is, I think, one of the first ones we ever acquired. And it's these are going nowhere except on my wall.

04:59.000 --> 05:07.000
You know, I was going to say, if we are ever able to get back together in person again, hopefully, hopefully the vaccine won't take.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
You're not going on your wall. These are going on my wall. It doesn't have to be on my wall, but we can maybe borrow them for a photo shoot or something.

05:13.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah, I would do that. You know, Rob, I would gladly lend these to whatever new studio happens to come into the future.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
I think the last actual photo shoot we did with the three of us was like a lot.

05:28.000 --> 05:36.000
It was like 10 years ago. Like I, I, I look great with all my hair, but it was a long time ago.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
Well, my hair was when I was dying it myself.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
Oh, yeah. And there was a little bit more of me at the time. So we've all we've all changed a little bit.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
All right. Well, let's also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

05:52.000 --> 06:01.000
Hello. Who's also changed in 10 years because now he's I don't know, maybe I need to stop calling him Tech Master Loki and call him Game Developer Loki.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
It doesn't have the same ring to it. OK, I guess. Yeah, it's true. It doesn't have the same ring to it.

06:05.000 --> 06:13.000
I guess I guess you're stuck with the old name. So how are sales of pixel poops going through the roof?

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
No. All right.

06:17.000 --> 06:25.000
Well, you know, you just make sure you get out there and promote and do all that good stuff, you know, because it's it's going to be hard after the first week.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
You know, it is what it is. All right.

06:28.000 --> 06:35.000
Well, we hope most of our listeners have checked that out by now over on itch.io or steam pixel poops number two.

06:35.000 --> 06:42.000
And on steam, you have to look up the main pixel poops game. But I would also recommend that to all all of our listeners here at Orange Lounge Radio.

06:42.000 --> 06:48.000
But we've talked at length about that. So my question to this for you this week is what now?

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Like, obviously, we'll get into your gaming week a little later in the show.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
So I'm talking about what you played, but like what's going through your mind now about what you want to do next?

06:55.000 --> 07:02.000
Or you focus now on, oh, I got to go back and I got to upgrade pixel poops, too, for that physical release that everybody's asking about.

07:02.000 --> 07:12.000
So I've been working on like a few things, just like I purchase a few more boards to come inside, seven more coming in.

07:12.000 --> 07:21.000
So I have like a total of 12 cartridges now because just the supply is not there's not a lot of supply out there for that stuff.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
So I got what I could with that. I have been looking at what I'm going to do next.

07:26.000 --> 07:33.000
I wasn't really sure. There's an NES game jam that's in March.

07:33.000 --> 07:40.000
They may do. I don't know. But yeah, I have lots of ideas of things I could work on.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
I may do another NES game. I have an idea for one, so I may do that.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
All right. Go into our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
Zen Monkey regarding your name is suggesting Game Master Loki.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
I don't know. That might be too much for the ego, Zen Monkey. I like the name.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
It does have a much better ring to it. Game Master Loki.

08:00.000 --> 08:07.000
But I like I imagine like Loki probably would get his butt whooped at most video games by a lot of people out there on the Internet.

08:07.000 --> 08:14.000
Yeah, we're probably we're in our 40s now, like.

08:14.000 --> 08:21.000
I don't know if we're going to call ourselves the game master, but I I appreciate the thought and I do agree it has a better ring to it.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
All right. I am the game mistress, the game mistress.

08:24.000 --> 08:31.000
See, I I kind of like that in a way, but I think when I think game mistress, it's got to be more like Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
That's that's the Jamie vibe I get. So, you know, yours, Cruelly.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
Hi. Yes. Our Zoom meeting is still connected.

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
And I'm just like whatever about it right now. So I understand. All right.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
Well, let's talk a little bit. You know what? Since we are joking about age and things like that.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
And for the folks watching on Twitch tonight, we had a little parody at the beginning that was poking fun at age a little bit.

08:58.000 --> 09:07.000
But, you know, this is this is the reality is that today one of the all time greatest franchises is turning 35 years old.

09:07.000 --> 09:22.000
So today, February the 21st of 1986, is when the Famicom version of The Legend of Zelda released on the Famicom, which was actually the disk system at the time.

09:22.000 --> 09:31.000
And you can play that original Japanese version of the game if you are a Nintendo Switch Pro person, because you can actually download it.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
You just make a Japanese account on your Switch, which doesn't cost you any money to do.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
And you just use that to get into the e-shop and download the Famicom player.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
And then you can log into the Famicom player in your U.S. account that actually pays for the service.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
And I imagine this works, you know, UK and other regions as well.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
And then you can actually play the original.

09:50.000 --> 09:57.000
So you get that little extra sound chip that the Famicom disk system had that didn't translate over to the Nintendo.

09:57.000 --> 10:03.000
Really extra as much as different because the cartridges had were the ones that could get the extra chip.

10:04.000 --> 10:17.000
True. But it did seem like games, there were a handful like that one, Metroid, Castlevania, you know, that sacrificed a little something as opposed to trying to, you know, because they couldn't really bring it over one for one.

10:17.000 --> 10:27.000
One of the big things, though, is that actually Castlevania 3, when it came out, it had that extra chip that gave it another, I think, layer of sound.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
Oh, right. Because it wasn't a disk game, of course. Right, right.

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
Exactly. And it also had extra animations and like a different attack for Grant. There were a few things.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
Yeah. But anyway, this isn't about Castlevania, it's about Zelda.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
It could be.

10:42.000 --> 10:50.000
We love all the games, but I'm kind of curious, you know, because I know for me, this series has been hugely impactful.

10:50.000 --> 10:58.000
And I guess I guess maybe I'll start first and talk a little bit about my memories of Zelda, because, you know, playing the very first original Legend of Zelda game.

10:58.000 --> 11:06.000
Obviously, we got it a little bit later, but that was really the first game that I remember really wanting a Nintendo for.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
Like, I liked playing Super Mario Brothers in the arcade, and I liked playing things like Ice Climbers and stuff like that, too.

11:11.000 --> 11:19.000
And I remember playing some things at friends' houses, like my friend even had the Rob the Robot, and we tried to play, I think it was Stack'em, even though we didn't understand what the hell we were doing.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
But, oh, and Hogan's Alley. I remember that one, too, because that was a game I really liked in the arcade.

11:24.000 --> 11:35.000
But I remember that when I saw, like, the Legend of Zelda, that was the moment, and I would have been like eight or nine years old when I saw it, where I was like, oh, I've got to have this.

11:35.000 --> 11:44.000
Like, this game is amazing, and I want to play this. I want this in my house. Mommy, Mommy, can I have an NES? Okay, we'll get straight A's.

11:44.000 --> 11:51.000
And I did. I got straight A's. So, you know, I got a Nintendo, and that was pretty much the first game we bought.

11:51.000 --> 12:00.000
Outside of, of course, it comes with, most of them came with Mario Brothers and Duck Hunt and all that, but Zelda was, like, the first game we bought.

12:00.000 --> 12:14.000
And then I became so obsessed with that game, like, not just playing through the first quest, but playing through the second quest, that even though I got picked on a lot in school when I was growing up, because, you know, I was, you know, a little different,

12:15.000 --> 12:24.000
the bullies would then want to talk to me more one-on-one to ask me things like, so where is, like, level seven in the second quest of Legend of Zelda, because I can't find it.

12:24.000 --> 12:40.000
So it was a very interesting kind of, like, dynamic that played out there, but that was really the game that led to me becoming, like, the, and I'm using my quotey fingers, video game expert when I was younger, you know, the one in the class who, who knew everything about the games and read all the magazines and all that stuff.

12:40.000 --> 12:52.000
So, yeah, that, and, you know, obviously from there, I, I, I still love Zelda 2. I got that the Christmas or holiday when that first came out, and I played the crap out of that.

12:52.000 --> 13:01.000
I wasn't bothered by the changes. It was just a little different to me, but I really enjoyed the game. Of course, I loved A Link to the Past on Super Nintendo and on and on.

13:01.000 --> 13:10.000
I, I did, I did lose the series a little bit because in college I fell out of gaming a little bit, and so I didn't transition to Nintendo 64.

13:10.000 --> 13:17.000
When I did finally go to a new console, I went to PlayStation because that's where Final Fantasy was at, and that's, like, the, the big series.

13:17.000 --> 13:25.000
So I kind of fell out of Zelda at that point, which I know, because Ocarina of Time is, like, the Zelda game for many, many people, but for, I had a different trajectory.

13:25.000 --> 13:33.000
I kind of fell out at that point, and, you know, obviously I've rediscovered a lot of the love through more recent releases like Twilight Princess and so forth.

13:33.000 --> 13:41.000
So, yeah, I mean, it's, it's just an all-time great series, but especially that original game has a real special place in my heart.

13:41.000 --> 13:51.000
So I'm kind of curious about you guys and your memories of Zelda back in the day. Now, Jamie, how were, how were your thoughts on Zelda?

13:52.000 --> 14:00.000
I played that when it came out more times than I can count because I played, you know, both quests and then I would play them again, and then I would play them again.

14:00.000 --> 14:09.000
And, like, I wouldn't even bother getting, like, the, the red bracelet, I would just play through and, you know, I, it was just something I did.

14:09.000 --> 14:16.000
And then I didn't like Zelda 2, you know, had good music, wasn't my favorite, although I like watching Dan play it.

14:16.000 --> 14:26.000
And I mean, I, oh yeah, I remember that, you know, kind of thing. I really liked it. I had, I had the gold cartridge.

14:26.000 --> 14:35.000
Um, gosh, I mean, the only thing that toppled it in my gaming esteem was the Guardian Legend.

14:35.000 --> 14:41.000
And that takes a lot to topple, at the time, to topple that.

14:41.000 --> 14:54.000
Even the Guardian Legend kind of owes a little bit to Zelda. And I think part of the reason why that game, you know, at least why I'm a fan of that game is because it's not just some of the best parts of Zelda, but then it's like a shooter 2.

14:54.000 --> 15:01.000
You know, it's like the best part of both of those kind of coming together. And I think that's what that made, that made that game very special in many ways.

15:01.000 --> 15:11.000
Well, and then there's other games that I really like that, of course, were influenced by that, like Newtopia and Newtopia 2 that were on the PC Engine or TurboGrafx.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Sure. I think a lot of...

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
So, a good number of...

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Go ahead.

15:17.000 --> 15:28.000
Oh, there's a good number of games that I like that were influenced by the first one, most of the top down games, you know, but I, I want to say that Legend of the Valkyrie came out before Legend of Zelda.

15:28.000 --> 15:36.000
I have to double check that. So I also see some other games that I like influenced the Legend of Zelda.

15:36.000 --> 15:47.000
That's true. Games that actually influenced the Legend of Zelda kind of going the other way. You know, I would think certainly something like Adventure on the Atari 2600 was kind of like an early, early, early kind of precursor to that style.

15:47.000 --> 15:57.000
Like, obviously it's different. And obviously with the, you know, Atari 2600 is a very kind of, you know, I don't think it necessarily had the same leverage in Japan where obviously Zelda came from.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Go ahead, Jamie.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
You remember though, before I had a NES, I had a ColecoVision.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Yep.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
And my favorite game to play on ColecoVision was Venture.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
You know, very top down adventure, dash in, grab the thing, dash out.

16:12.000 --> 16:20.000
And I saw the Legend of Zelda as a very logical evolution of that scenario with more story.

16:20.000 --> 16:27.000
And so that was also, you know, one of, you know, it probably even took some influences from Rogue. I mean, if you think about it.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Oh, sure. Yeah, that's a good one.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Yeah.

16:30.000 --> 16:37.000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network points out Intellivision had the AD&D games that were top down dungeon crawlers.

16:37.000 --> 16:46.000
So it's kind of like there was kind of like a dungeon-y game on whatever you were playing at the time, but it just kind of depended on how they did it.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
You know, they all did it a little differently.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
I would probably say that Rogue would have been its great granddaddy.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
Yeah, I think that's... did you just call Zelda a roguelike?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I did.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
If you think about it.

16:59.000 --> 17:05.000
Actually, I would say a lot of people are super into the Zelda randomizer stuff.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
That is a roguelike. Absolutely.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
That's the only kind of...

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
I'm more referring to the overall...

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Oh, I get it. No, I get it.

17:13.000 --> 17:23.000
The mythology of it where you have exploration that you do, you find secret panels, you have enemies to fight, you move your way through it, you map as you go.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Yeah.

17:24.000 --> 17:37.000
So I think that I would even go on a limb and say that Rogue is probably one of our... Rogue and the tech space games married together, created our adventure RPG series.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
As far as video games go.

17:40.000 --> 17:46.000
How have you been with Zelda in the later years? Do you still try to play all the games that come out or have you fallen out a little bit?

17:46.000 --> 17:54.000
I never could get into Majora's Mask because the moon thing creeped me the fuck out.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
But I've beaten Ocarina of Time several times.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
Link to the Past is my favorite ever.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I played the sequel to it.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
Didn't really get too much into it.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
We didn't play many of the...

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
I mean, I played Link's Awakening on Game Boy back in the day.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
And of course, we have the remake on Switch.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
Dan and I did Twilight Princess together.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
And I fucking love Breath of the Wild. Don't even get me started on how much I loved it.

18:26.000 --> 18:34.000
But we didn't play Skyward Sword for reasons, I think.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
We just really didn't have a reason. It just didn't happen.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
You're gonna get another chance not to get too far ahead, but we'll get to it.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Right. We're getting it. We are getting it.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
Because Dan and I have been talking about, are we gonna get it? Are we gonna wait?

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
And then the announcement came, so yeah.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
I think most people listening know it's coming, but we'll talk about that in a little bit.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
Dan really enjoyed Four Swords Adventures. I didn't get into it that much.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Oh yeah, I liked that one too.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
Man, those games that kind of utilized the Game Boy Advance and the GameCube.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
There was only a couple of them, but they were all done so well.

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
Minish Cap was really cute, and I regret having not played more of that.

19:09.000 --> 19:15.000
It was when I was going through a lot of video game ADD.

19:15.000 --> 19:21.000
You were talking about the Link to the Past being one of the all-time greats.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
And I totally agree.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
It was my favorite.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
I think it's my favorite Zelda 2 at the end of the day as well.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
And honestly, one of my favorite video games in my top ten, like overall, ever, easily.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
Maybe even top five. I have to really sit down and think about it.

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
But it is so many elements in it that just make it the perfect adventure game.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
And it's so replayable.

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
But I think that's also why I really loved the Link Between Two Worlds that came out.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
The Link Between Worlds.

19:45.000 --> 19:51.000
Yeah, because that brought a lot of that same kind of style to it.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Well, I actually have to tell you something.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
You know how steadfast my top three games have always been?

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Right.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
My top three games list has changed.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Ooh, how so?

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
Because I've been going back to play A Link to the Past.

20:07.000 --> 20:13.000
And so I'm still going to say The Guardian Legend is number one, but A Link to the Past is number three now.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Fantasy Zone is number two.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Okay.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
Space Harrier, I've decided it's more fun to watch people play it than actually play it.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Okay.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I love Space Harrier, don't get me wrong.

20:22.000 --> 20:28.000
But number four is not a bad place to be of the millions of video games that have ever been made.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
Well, I was actually going to say number four, Super Metroid.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
Oh, well, hey, I'm okay with that choice.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
That's my number one.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
And guess what number five is that isn't Space Harrier?

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
Ooh, you've really demoted Space Harrier over time.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
I have, because I enjoy watching other people play it more than actually playing it myself.

20:48.000 --> 20:54.000
I would be shocked if Mass Effect isn't up there, just with how much that trilogy has done.

20:54.000 --> 21:06.000
And actually it is a cross, probably a toss up between the Mass Effect as a series, because I consider all three of them basically one game in my heart.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Yeah, of course.

21:07.000 --> 21:18.000
Or, I mean, I've got like a big tie list because I put the Mass Effect series and Dragon Age as, I guess, more of my modern favorites.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Like I have two lists of favorites.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
I have my classic favorites and I have my more modern favorites.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
You don't have to rank everything either, you know?

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Divided by...

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
It's hard to rank art.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
Divided by maybe the year 2000 gap.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Okay.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
So my pre-California and my post-California.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
Okay. Well, was that your five? Was Mass Effect slash Dragon Age?

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
I'm actually going to say Chrono Trigger and keep that as my favorite classics.

21:45.000 --> 21:54.000
But for my modern favorites, Mass Effect goes on the top of the list and specifically Dragon Age Inquisition would be right under the Mass Effect series.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Okay.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
I played so much of that shit. It was great.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
All right.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
I got to hear from Loki.

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
Loki, your reflections on Zelda's birthday as it turns 35.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
Well, Zelda was one of the first games I had for the NES.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
So that was kind of how the NES was presented to me.

22:12.000 --> 22:19.000
When like we... I remember we had played, you know, different games at friends houses and stuff like that.

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
But like when my parents surprised me with the NES, they had Zelda booted up on it.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
And so that was kind of like my first game anyways.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
So yeah, it definitely does have a special place in my heart, you know, for it.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
And I played a ton of it.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
So.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Yeah.

22:37.000 --> 22:46.000
And in all of the others, all this except several of the 3D ones, really the only thing 3D that played was probably Wind Waker.

22:46.000 --> 22:52.000
I didn't really play... I guess the 3DS stuff is sort of 3D, I guess.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
So I did those as well.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
And also the DS stuff, but not really any like Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Skyward Sword did not play that.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
Haven't really even played much of Breath of the Wild.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
So I don't know.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
It was just hard getting into those.

23:10.000 --> 23:16.000
Are we surprised, you know, obviously we're going to kind of roll into the Nintendo Direct Talk here in a moment,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
which is, you know, another big headline from the week.

23:18.000 --> 23:25.000
But are we kind of surprised that Nintendo didn't try to do like a classics type of thing for...

23:25.000 --> 23:32.000
I mean, to be fair, well, to be fair, let's make sure we state if you have the Switch online,

23:32.000 --> 23:39.000
you already do have the original Legend of Zelda, Zelda 2, the Adventures of Link and Dark Soccer's favorite game,

23:39.000 --> 23:45.000
A Link to the Past are all available in those two libraries.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
So they didn't have any need to repackage those games because they're already there on the Switch.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
But are we surprised they didn't try to do, you know, Ocarina of Time, you know, or some of the other,

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
you know, maybe like Ocarina of Time slash Majora's Mask kind of combo thing,

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
even though, you know, it's not just for Jamie that Majora's Mask is a little bit controversial,

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
but some people love it, some people don't like it.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
I'm kind of in the middle with it.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
I honestly don't think I really spent enough time with it.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
And I think a collection like that would have really kind of given me a chance to revisit that again.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
Are we kind of surprised Nintendo didn't go that direction?

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
I still think that they have time to do that.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
We only know some of the announcements so far this year.

24:22.000 --> 24:30.000
I don't think that it's out of the realm of possibility for them to do some sort of collection outside of Skyward Sword.

24:30.000 --> 24:36.000
I think that it's been rumored for a while that they're going to do something like that with Ocarina of Time

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
and maybe even throw some of the other Wii games on there.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
You know, there could be Twilight Princess or, you know, they could do Majora's Mask.

24:44.000 --> 24:50.000
I mean, they've remastered both of those sort of for 3DS.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
And I mean, emulating the Wii is pretty easy.

24:53.000 --> 24:59.000
I don't know if they want to necessarily dive into the Wii too much because, you know, with motion controls and everything,

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
they do have to kind of work around that a little bit.

25:03.000 --> 25:09.000
That's one of the greatest things about this Skyward Sword thing and why I'm kind of interested in it is that it gets rid of that.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
I mean, well, I should say get rid of it.

25:11.000 --> 25:18.000
You can actually play a refined version of it, if you will, with the more refined controllers on the Switch.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
But and for a lot of people, this is huge. I already saw it in chat once.

25:21.000 --> 25:27.000
I know for me the fact you can just use the buttons and just play it like, you know, other Zelda and just play it with a controller.

25:27.000 --> 25:34.000
That's great for me. So it makes it a huge thing I would like to check out.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
But I think, though, there's still an opportunity to do more stuff like that.

25:37.000 --> 25:43.000
I mean, if you remember for Mario's 35th anniversary, they did a bunch of stuff and they've announced things.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
And I don't know if they announced it all at once. Maybe they did, but I think they did.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
There's still time in the year to do that. I mean, true.

25:51.000 --> 26:02.000
You know, there's stuff that's going to be coming out around June when they have all the summer announcements for around E3, which is not really a thing anymore.

26:02.000 --> 26:08.000
But I don't know, I could totally see them doing another collection of some sort.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Just they have plenty of games to work from.

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
I'm surprised that we haven't seen some of the DS games come back like as a collection of those.

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
But I know that it's kind of hard to kind of do that maybe with the Switch, but...

26:20.000 --> 26:26.000
I don't think so. I mean, we've seen how many shooter games that have come out on the Switch now that have a vertical mode.

26:26.000 --> 26:35.000
So you could just play with your Switch vertical and you use the little, you know, you can mount it up and then, you know, just take one of the controllers off and you play with that.

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
The pinball games do this too. You can play a vertical mode.

26:39.000 --> 26:44.000
And I think a DS thing would work fine in vertical mode, but for whatever reason they don't want to do it.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
Maybe because they don't like the idea of being separated from the TV like that.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
Although, why not just have a DS image on your TV?

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
You just, sure, you lose a lot of real estate on the sides, but I bet people would still play it.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
I don't know.

26:58.000 --> 27:04.000
Yeah, I mean, it's touchscreen functionality, I think is probably why they didn't.

27:04.000 --> 27:12.000
But there's some of those things, I think, with even like, Zelda and stuff, the control scheme, they could probably adapt it to work because they had it using touchscreen.

27:12.000 --> 27:22.000
And it worked great for that, but they could probably adapt it with traditional controls, or they can go the lazy route and just put the Nintendo 64 versions out.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Yeah, that's what I would expect.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
And put Wind Waker in there or something like that.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
I mean, they've already remastered Wind Waker once, just ported over.

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
I mean, there's easy ways out to do all that stuff.

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
Yeah. Well, let's talk a little more about that Nintendo Direct and some of the things that were talked about.

27:39.000 --> 27:50.000
Obviously, as we've mentioned quite extensively already, we know one of the big, big headlines out of that was that they're going to be making a Skyward Sword kind of redo on the Nintendo Switch.

27:50.000 --> 27:56.000
And Bobby's actually correcting kind of what I said earlier, saying it's not really button controls because you still have to identify the direction of your slashes.

27:56.000 --> 28:03.000
So you use the right stick to swing instead of hitting A. But that's, it's still, you know, I don't have to jump around.

28:03.000 --> 28:09.000
I can, if I want to lay back on my couch and be like that, you know, and just have the, you know, I can still kind of play that way.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
I don't actually have to get up and move around and all that stuff.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
So I do like that. But sure, I get what you're saying. It's not really a button.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
But OK, it's a flick of the thumb either way.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Yeah.

28:21.000 --> 28:27.000
But anyway, what were some of the, obviously I have some opinions on the direct as a whole, and I'm sure you guys do too.

28:27.000 --> 28:34.000
And I mean, chat as well with that. But why don't we go through some of the headlines just to kind of refresh our memory with what all they showed us.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Loki, I know you had something cued up for that.

28:36.000 --> 28:48.000
Sure. Yes. So, I mean, some of the big stuff, obviously, we just talked about Skyward Sword, which is getting an HD port on the Switch coming out July 16th.

28:48.000 --> 28:55.000
They made the announcement of Splatoon 3, which is really big, kind of a tease, but still not coming out until next year.

28:55.000 --> 29:02.000
It was also one of those things where it was like, we've been talking about this for how long and how did we not see this coming today?

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
You know, like when they played the Splatoon 3 trailer, my mind kind of went, oh, of course.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
Oh, of course. That was kind of like where, oh, of course.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Of course they're going to do something here.

29:12.000 --> 29:21.000
They showed off because we had gotten a tease. This was during the Mario 35th anniversary stream that they did, like back in September, I think, or maybe even before that.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
Talking about like the Animal Crossing stuff that was coming out.

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
So that's going to be coming out March 1st with a free update and they kind of showed off some of the items.

29:29.000 --> 29:34.000
One of the cool, unique things in there is you can actually get warp pipe to be able to move around your island, which is awesome.

29:34.000 --> 29:42.000
And I think a lot of the stuff that they have, especially like with the Thwomps and the coins and stuff like that, pretty cool to see it all very interactive.

29:42.000 --> 29:53.000
Somebody pointed out on social media that those warp pipes are some of the first items that expand, that actually give additional functionality to the island.

29:53.000 --> 30:02.000
I don't know, Dark Soccer is the expert when it comes to Animal Crossing, but just real quick, picking your brain on what you thought of the warp pipe announcement, because that's more than just a decoration.

30:02.000 --> 30:09.000
It's going to go in my town. I'm putting one by my house and one in front of my shops.

30:09.000 --> 30:17.000
Honestly, I wish the island could be bigger now, like so we could decorate and you could have like a whole like second island that you have to use a warp pipe to get.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
I guess that's asking a lot. It's asking a lot, but no, it's nice.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
Make it happen. Come on.

30:24.000 --> 30:32.000
You could even not that I want to give you ideas, but you could charge a fee for it. I mean, yeah, I don't know.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Yeah.

30:34.000 --> 30:39.000
Anyways, so we got our next big Mario announcement. Mario Golf.

30:39.000 --> 30:45.000
Sorry, just some quick other comments from chat. Vio by Kurt. Hey, Kurt says AC Mario announcement was awesome.

30:45.000 --> 30:52.000
And yeah, I got to say, there's so much that it looks like they're adding. You can really transform the look of your island a lot with that.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
And I thought that was pretty cool. So there is that.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
Sjoan Hunter Matt says second island, also known as Item Hoarder Island.

30:59.000 --> 31:08.000
Yeah, that's what it would turn out for me. Kurt with another suggestion saying if the warp pipe could be connected to a best friend's island, that would be amazing.

31:08.000 --> 31:13.000
Oh, I like that. That's an interesting thought. Anyway, sorry, Loki.

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
Other other announcements. You're talking about the golf, right?

31:17.000 --> 31:25.000
Yeah. So they have Mario Golf Super Rush, which is a brand new golf game coming out June 25th.

31:25.000 --> 31:33.000
And they're going to have some sort of story mode along with that with your Miis as well. So that's it's neat, I guess.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
Not Mario Kart 9, but we'll deal.

31:36.000 --> 31:41.000
I did. I did sense the kind of meh coming from Twitter on that one.

31:41.000 --> 31:48.000
But I feel I feel like these arcade type golf games have an audience. They always seem to sell.

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
It's like in hot shots, golf on PlayStation has always been a big one.

31:53.000 --> 31:58.000
And I got to say, like for for what it is, it does look neat.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
I'm not sure if it's something up my alley where I want to spend 60 bucks on it.

32:02.000 --> 32:08.000
But I was like, you know, I know there is an audience for these games and it does look like, you know,

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
Nintendo always puts these unique spins on kind of the golf formula.

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
And I always think of like the Kirby miniature golf.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
I don't think that was the name of the Kirby Superstar course.

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
Yeah, Air Force that, you know, that was basically a golf game. It was a very unique kind of spin on it.

32:24.000 --> 32:32.000
So, I mean, I expect the game is going to be very interesting and, you know, for that audience will be worth money.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
But I'm just not sure for me specifically.

32:35.000 --> 32:40.000
It'll be interesting there. The announced fall guys is coming to the switch.

32:40.000 --> 32:50.000
Finally, this summer, we got our new character for Smash Brothers announced, which is Pyre from Xenoblade Chronicles two.

32:50.000 --> 32:55.000
And then she also transforms into some other character as well.

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
So she's coming in March.

32:59.000 --> 33:04.000
Then lots of like really old games being announced and brought over.

33:04.000 --> 33:10.000
So we have Tales from the Borderlands coming, Stubbs the Zombie.

33:10.000 --> 33:16.000
We've got also the Ninja Gaiden collection, Star Wars Hunters.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
Well, actually, that's a newer game now, but it's based.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
It's a game developed by Zynga.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
So take that as you will.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
You know what? You know, Zynga made that high heels game I was talking about last week.

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
So that's what you can. Where's my Switch port of high heels?

33:33.000 --> 33:38.000
And I should be able to play it in vertical mode so my heels can get extra high. Just saying.

33:38.000 --> 33:47.000
There's a new game called World Ends Club. World Ends Club is a detective story by the makers of Danganronpa that's coming out May 28th.

33:47.000 --> 33:53.000
We also had a game that looked like it was Octopath Traveler, but it's not.

33:53.000 --> 34:00.000
It's Project Triangle Strategy. I would imagine it's them using that engine for a very different kind of game.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
Yeah, it's like a tactics game. So that's kind of cool.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
And they had a demo that came out already for that.

34:07.000 --> 34:12.000
They showed off that they're going to be doing a Miitopia game for the Switch.

34:12.000 --> 34:17.000
So bringing that over from the 3DS. Where the hell did that come from? Who asked for that?

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
I mean, I'm not I'm not dogging on it because I know that game has its fans.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
I have friends that were very lit up when they saw the announcement.

34:24.000 --> 34:30.000
It was definitely a, of all the games I expected them to bring back, that was not the one I thought.

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
But I guess that's what makes the announcements kind of fun, I guess.

34:34.000 --> 34:42.000
They have announced there was that Capcom Arcade Collection that was coming out. Arcade Stadium.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
And tons of games included.

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
This was my favorite headline out of the whole thing and I bought it.

34:48.000 --> 34:54.000
And I had $40 to get all of the games, but it's I think it's like 31 games.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
They have a ton of games in there too.

34:56.000 --> 35:02.000
They really do. And I will say for Dark Sakura, because I'm going to say the magic word that always gets her attention.

35:02.000 --> 35:07.000
Strider is in the collection and it's the arcade version of Strider.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
And I have to say, I don't remember the last time I played the arcade version of Strider.

35:10.000 --> 35:17.000
It's been a long time, like since I was like fucking around with Mame a long time ago on a computer that wasn't good enough to run Strider.

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
So to be able to play that again has been neat. I'll talk a little more about it in my gaming week.

35:21.000 --> 35:26.000
But the Capcom Stadium thing was like my favorite thing they announced because I love my retro stuff.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
And we have CyberBots.

35:28.000 --> 35:32.000
Don't you know CyberBots is Capcom's number one game?

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
It's a quote.

35:34.000 --> 35:48.000
There's a real interesting mix of like like very mainstream stuff like Super Street Fighter 2, Street Fighter 2 Turbo, 1943, Ghosts and Goblins.

35:48.000 --> 35:54.000
You know, there's a mix of that and then like really deep cut stuff in that collection.

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
So I thought it was neat.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Yeah, so lots of cool stuff in there.

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
So that was pretty exciting. I wish we'd seen more of that kind of stuff.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
More release dates announced.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
So No More Heroes 3 is coming August 27th.

36:10.000 --> 36:15.000
There's a game called Knockout City that's by EA.

36:15.000 --> 36:19.000
It's like a dodgeball battle royale game that's coming out May 21st.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
What else?

36:21.000 --> 36:27.000
We've got a shooter that's called Neon White that's going to be coming out.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
It looked kind of cool.

36:29.000 --> 36:35.000
And they showed off The Legend of Mana is getting a Switch port as well.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
And so that's coming out June 4th.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
I've got something to say. I got something to say.

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
And this is going to get me in trouble, but I'm going to say it because it's my opinion.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
That's my opinion.

36:46.000 --> 36:53.000
The Legend of Mana is probably easily in the top three most disappointing games I've ever played in my life.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
And I know that is not going to be a popular opinion.

36:56.000 --> 37:06.000
But coming off of playing games like Secret of Mana, Secret of Evermore, and then buying that on the PlayStation, I was so disappointed.

37:06.000 --> 37:13.000
And one of the only Square Enix games to me that's more disappointing than Legend of Mana is Saga Frontier.

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
So honestly, I am not feeling the Square remasters right now.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
This is not an era for me.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
And that's okay. It doesn't have to be for me.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
I know a lot of people that are very excited about that.

37:23.000 --> 37:29.000
And I will say, I'm not even looking at chat because I'm sure they're screaming at me, but I will say this.

37:29.000 --> 37:35.000
Maybe it is a second chance to try the game again and see if maybe something just didn't click the first time.

37:35.000 --> 37:39.000
You know, because sometimes that's the sort of thing that happens, but I don't know.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
I was not feeling the Legend of Mana announcement.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
All right, I'm looking now to see what's going on.

37:44.000 --> 37:50.000
We had also announced, was it two Famicom Detective Club stories that are getting localized?

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
I've never heard of that series.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
I have. They're supposed to be pretty cute.

37:56.000 --> 38:01.000
I mean, we can get that game localized, but no Earthbound 3, no Mother 3 or whatever.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
Nintendo and their priorities. Let's put out another game.

38:06.000 --> 38:13.000
Or hey, I know, let's put out a trailer for DC Super Heroes or Super Hero Girls Teen Power.

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
But that has, it has an audience. The audience isn't me.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
But I was kind of like, oh, this is cool that this exists.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
That was pretty much my reaction to that trailer.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
I'm happy this exists, even though I'm not going to be buying it for me.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
But I bet other people will be very thrilled with that.

38:30.000 --> 38:37.000
I wanted to mention this because I thought it was a good comment from Bobby in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork says,

38:37.000 --> 38:44.000
I think honestly, this is because it's easier to coordinate development of a remaster over Zoom than a new game right now.

38:44.000 --> 38:48.000
We've now been out of offices for 11 months. This keeps developers employed.

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
True, although there's one game they still can't seem to remaster.

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
Give you a hint. Logie just mentioned it, Mother 3. Anyway.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
Yeah. All right. Anything else to mention?

39:03.000 --> 39:09.000
No, that was it. I mean, they had they showed off Samurai Warriors 5, which it's Samurai Warriors 5.

39:09.000 --> 39:15.000
And also along those lines, apparently Hyrule Warriors, Age of Calamity is getting some DLC.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
They didn't say what it was. They just briefly flashed up.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
Hey, you can buy this. Don't know what it is, but.

39:23.000 --> 39:27.000
And Nintendo's DLC is really good usually, so I'm not mad about it.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.000
But it's not a Nintendo game. It's a Tecmo Koei game.

39:31.000 --> 39:37.000
Yeah, but it's holding a Nintendo name, so it's it's they're still going to have to put a substantial amount into it, I think.

39:37.000 --> 39:42.000
We'll see. So how did we feel about the direct overall?

39:43.000 --> 39:48.000
So, OK, I'll start. So I I was OK with it.

39:48.000 --> 39:55.000
Like I was kind of ambivalent, which kind of surprised me because it's been so long since we've had a Nintendo direct.

39:55.000 --> 40:04.000
But I think I was kind of like, OK, like, you know, I knew we weren't going to get like Metroid Prime 4 game footage or anything like that.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
But I think maybe I was a little bit surprised.

40:07.000 --> 40:17.000
And I think this is generally like where Nintendo is at for, I think, a lot of people and why maybe there's like negative reaction there, because there's definitely people that are like, man, that sucked.

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
That was a horrible direct. I can't believe they didn't show like anything I was looking for.

40:21.000 --> 40:26.000
And there's another crowd that was like, that was a great presentation. There was something for everybody.

40:26.000 --> 40:32.000
And, you know, obviously the two sides are kind of going at each other. And I really kind of feel like I'm somewhere in the middle.

40:32.000 --> 40:39.000
But I think I understand why folks are upset, you know, at what Nintendo kind of doesn't show.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
And let me try to kind of put that into words.

40:41.000 --> 40:50.000
So I think a lot of people enjoy Nintendo products and the Nintendo system because Nintendo is probably the best game maker in the biz.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
So people buy Nintendo products to play Nintendo games.

40:54.000 --> 41:03.000
And that particular direct, you had a handful of Nintendo games. You had the Mario Golf, which kind of has a limited audience.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Right. And the golfing thing isn't for everybody.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
Again, some people are going to be super into it and excited about it. Cool.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
But there are going to be people to go, meh. OK.

41:11.000 --> 41:19.000
Then we have the Zelda Skyward Sword, kind of a controversial entry in the Zelda series, getting the remaster.

41:19.000 --> 41:25.000
So there's that. And some people are saying, eh, paying 60 bucks for a game I just played and didn't enjoy that much.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
I don't know. But then again, there's another crowd that, you know, loves that game and so forth.

41:29.000 --> 41:36.000
And then I think what what really kind of salted people was the Splatoon 3 announcement.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
And it's not the fact that Splatoon 3 is coming again.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
I think that was actually probably like the least surprising thing they could have said.

41:42.000 --> 41:47.000
And I know that I enjoy. Of course, I'll buy Splatoon 3. I enjoy that series.

41:47.000 --> 41:54.000
I'm not saying it's a negative for me. What the negative is, was the 2022 date at the end of it.

41:54.000 --> 42:00.000
Even though. OK, wait. So this was supposed to be a direct that was going to focus on stuff that's kind of like this year.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
But they're giving us this game that's this far out.

42:03.000 --> 42:09.000
Well, if they're going to be showing us this, like what what about these other Nintendo things?

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
What exactly does Nintendo have coming out in 2021?

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
OK, they've got a golf game and a Zelda remake.

42:17.000 --> 42:22.000
And I think people are starting to feel like, is is the well dry at Nintendo?

42:22.000 --> 42:27.000
Has the pandemic really affected them like that badly or what's like going on?

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
And so Nintendo's really had to rely on third parties and especially Square Enix.

42:32.000 --> 42:36.000
If you look at this direct, like, holy crap, was Square Enix a big part of that job?

42:36.000 --> 42:40.000
But like when we're talking about third parties, like or even second parties, I don't know.

42:40.000 --> 42:48.000
Like, what's Retro Studios working on? I mean, like, weren't they supposed to have some big thing coming or like.

42:48.000 --> 42:52.000
What are they doing with Nintendo online? Like.

42:52.000 --> 42:57.000
Are we going to get any more systems on that? Are they going to release any more games on that?

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
I mean, there's been like hardly anything coming to that.

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
And both of those things you just named because Retro is basically Nintendo Studio at this point.

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
Both those things you just named are, again, Nintendo based updates.

43:09.000 --> 43:17.000
And I think that's why this direct left some people a little bit cold is that you got some kind of like take them or leave them for many people.

43:17.000 --> 43:24.000
Nintendo updates, a game announcement for 2022 that anyone could have seen coming.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
And that's what Nintendo's got for this year.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
And now I imagine there's going to be more in June.

43:30.000 --> 43:37.000
And I'm not again, I'm not trying to sound overly negative on Nintendo, but there is a difference between shitting on Nintendo,

43:37.000 --> 43:44.000
which is what I'm not trying to do, and being critical about some of, you know, what they with the cards they choose to and not show.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
And I am going to continue to be critical of this because it bugs me.

43:47.000 --> 43:55.000
And I know it bugs a lot of you, too, is that Nintendo continues to really sleep on a lot of their back catalog.

43:55.000 --> 44:04.000
Like there's so many people that want to see Nintendo 64, like especially you got a new Pokemon Snap game, which I'm surprised that was missing completely from the presentation.

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
Although there is a big Pokemon thing going on this next week with the 25th.

44:08.000 --> 44:15.000
So I think all those people that set themselves up for Pokemon Generation 4, I think we're always the remakes and all that.

44:15.000 --> 44:23.000
I think we're always going to be wrong because those Pokemon games almost always have their own announcements and their own thing from the Pokemon company.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
So and that'll all come next week, whatever they're doing there.

44:26.000 --> 44:31.000
But Pokemon Snap is still a thing Nintendo's been hyping, and I'm really surprised they haven't taken the opportunity to say,

44:31.000 --> 44:39.000
and you can check out the original, you know, whether it's 10 bucks or, you know, whether it's through a new Nintendo 64 player or something like that.

44:39.000 --> 44:43.000
I don't know, you know, and obviously no one ever shuts up about Mother 3.

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
And spoiler alert, they're not going to until it actually releases.

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
And even when it does, it probably still won't be good enough for some people.

44:50.000 --> 44:57.000
But, you know, even just the fact that Earthbound is still missing from the Super Nintendo Collection,

44:57.000 --> 45:04.000
the fact that the Wii U got that Earthbound Zero, which is still missing from the NES Collection is...

45:04.000 --> 45:12.000
My point is, is that there's a lot of Nintendo's library and stuff that fans really want to see Nintendo kind of push more,

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
and it's not happening for whatever reason.

45:14.000 --> 45:19.000
One remake of a controversial Zelda game isn't doing it for people.

45:19.000 --> 45:24.000
And I think that's what's leaving some people in a weird spot when it comes to Nintendo.

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
So I think how you felt about the Direct really boiled down to, how do you feel about Golf?

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
How do you feel about Skyward Sword? How do you feel about the third-party releases?

45:32.000 --> 45:36.000
I wasn't really excited about most of the Direct, honestly.

45:36.000 --> 45:40.000
Like, I thought that the Animal Crossing stuff was neat, but I don't really play Animal Crossing.

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
My kids do, and my wife does, so I was just like, eh.

45:44.000 --> 45:51.000
I was just surprised, like, I get it, Ninja Gaiden is a great series, but that's an old game.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
That's a really old game that they're porting.

45:54.000 --> 45:58.000
Like, if it was a new Ninja Gaiden game, cool, I'd be all down for that.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
But like, it's an old game.

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
Like, they're porting some old shit to this system.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
Like, Stubbs a Zombie? Who asked for that?

46:07.000 --> 46:14.000
I get that, yes, they need to give a little time to Ninja Gaiden and stuff.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
I start to wonder if they maybe give too much time to these releases.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
But here's the why behind that.

46:20.000 --> 46:30.000
The Wii U really tripped and fell out the gate because all of the third-party releases that came out for the Wii U were old games.

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
They were a year or two old at that point by the time they were hitting the Wii U.

46:34.000 --> 46:44.000
And that's why the third-party stuff really tripped and fell out the gate and it just caused this Wii U to have a sour launch that it never got away from.

46:44.000 --> 46:55.000
Now, the Switch has been in a much stronger position, but I feel like for some people it's almost a little bit like when they see the Tales from the Borderlands and the Ninja Gaiden and they see all that stuff.

46:55.000 --> 47:04.000
It's not that those are bad games, but they see Nintendo slipping back into this old habit that years old games finally coming to the Switch are some big deal.

47:04.000 --> 47:11.000
When it's not. I guess it depends on the game, but unless it's bringing something really new to the table, it's really not.

47:11.000 --> 47:18.000
And it's not even necessarily Nintendo's fault for any of that stuff, it's just what third-parties are deciding to release on the system.

47:18.000 --> 47:33.000
I guess porting over old stuff is just what they want to do. I don't know. I wish we'd get more from these properties other than just ports of old stuff.

47:33.000 --> 47:45.000
Don't get me wrong, some of these games are pretty good, but Ninja Gaiden came out on the Xbox and then the Xbox 360.

47:45.000 --> 47:53.000
And now we're porting that stuff over to the Switch? Who was like, oh my god, I need the... I don't know. I really don't see the point.

47:53.000 --> 48:01.000
I'm pretty sure. Isn't that one of the... Maybe it's one of the free titles with Games Pass right now.

48:01.000 --> 48:11.000
That stuff was always synonymous with Xbox at one point, but I don't know. Why waste a direct with that kind of stuff?

48:12.000 --> 48:17.000
Let me get some comments over chat, and then I want to check in with Dark Soccer and see if she has any thoughts about the direct.

48:17.000 --> 48:25.000
Then some comments from chat, sj100matt says, I think you have to couple this with the disappointment that some folks felt about a Switch Pro not happening anytime soon.

48:25.000 --> 48:30.000
Nintendo got a hit with Animal Crossing last year. Folks have been wanting more out of the Switch.

48:30.000 --> 48:37.000
And then MobyBlackWolf says, I think the companies want to make new games, but they want to wait for the pandemic to be over so they can collaborate in person.

48:37.000 --> 48:48.000
And again, I will give everybody involved in these things a little bit of slack because the pandemic has really just changed the world and the way we work and all of this stuff.

48:48.000 --> 48:57.000
So I understand things are just... But maybe in that sense, it feels a little weird to have brought out an official direct now, as opposed to these minis they've been doing.

48:58.000 --> 49:07.000
But I could see... Hold on, I'm not done. I could see where Nintendo is in a position where it's like, we're damned if we do, we're damned if we don't, when it comes to the direct.

49:07.000 --> 49:13.000
And I get that, and so I'm not going to fault them for it. And I'll make my last point, and then I'll get your follow-up, Loki, and then I'll go to Dark Soccer.

49:14.000 --> 49:27.000
Is that... Now I forgot my last point because I was trying to set all that up. With Nintendo... Dang it. Well, my train derailed. Go ahead, Loki. What was your thought?

49:27.000 --> 49:36.000
I was going to say, there's better games that they could be porting if they're looking to do ports of stuff. Like, I don't know, bring over some of the NES remix stuff. That was pretty cool.

49:37.000 --> 49:52.000
There's... I don't know, they could port over a bunch of older NES titles or something and put it in a collection or something. I don't know, there's better stuff to port over. I don't really know what to say.

49:52.000 --> 50:11.000
I mean, we've been getting, like, really old stuff. And it's not necessarily just a Nintendo problem. It's a lot of just developers out there, like, even, like, EA publishing some, like, bringing back Burnout Paradise again. Like, okay, that's a super old game. I mean, it's a fun game, but it's just, it's super old. All it does is make me want a brand new game.

50:12.000 --> 50:22.000
That being said, though, I'd totally take a collection of old Ridge Racer games, Namco, if, you know, you're up to it. But that's something we haven't gotten forever. Geez, a new Ridge Racer game.

50:22.000 --> 50:35.000
My final thought was, even if the Direct hadn't been, or even if the Direct had been that bad or a bad Direct, which I don't think it was, I think it was just kind of, like, average, it doesn't tarnish that the Switch is still a great system.

50:35.000 --> 50:53.000
Because there are so many great games that are on the Switch, you know, and the fact that 2021 is clearly going to be a little bit of a slower year for the Switch, probably because of the pandemic, doesn't take away from the fact that the Switch is the only place you're gonna be able to play Animal Crossing, Breath of the Wild, you know, and a lot of the games that are very strong in Nintendo's library.

50:53.000 --> 51:10.000
So I think that's something to keep in mind, too, is that while maybe this Direct didn't, you know, maybe didn't like get people screaming about the future and so forth, I don't think it necessarily tarnishes the Switch as a system and something that people should consider adding to their library if they somehow don't already have one.

51:10.000 --> 51:18.000
Anyway, Dark Soccer, I'm sorry to make you wait, but I want to ask you, you know, do you play Switch, obviously, Animal Crossing a lot? What were your thoughts about the Direct?

51:19.000 --> 51:34.000
I'm happy about the Animal Crossing stuff. I mean, that's really the thing I cared the most about. There's definitely a few games on there. Like, I'm really curious to see what Neon White is like. I like the art style of it.

51:34.000 --> 52:03.000
I, of course, Capcom Arcade Stadium. I know that there's going to be a lot of play from, you know, that in my house. I did want to play Legend of Mana because I didn't before. So, I mean, I'm looking forward to it. I mean, I'll put it this way. I had, yeah, I think it was Legend of Mana that I had on PS1, but I had an import of it.

52:05.000 --> 52:16.000
So, it was very text heavy and I couldn't read very well at the time in Japanese. So, it'd be nice to actually see what it was they were there talking about.

52:16.000 --> 52:23.000
There's just really not, though, a lot other than the few things here and there that I'm really overly excited about.

52:24.000 --> 52:34.000
I mean, World's End Club is definitely something I'm interested in because, I mean, it's Spike Chunsoft, isn't it?

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
I think so, yeah.

52:35.000 --> 52:48.000
Yeah. I love a lot of the games that they've put out. I really love Danganronpa. Hopefully, it might be kind of similar, at least stylistically or in the feel of it. So, I would enjoy playing that.

52:49.000 --> 53:06.000
And, I mean, we were interested in playing Skyward Sword. So, that's happy news. I'm really disappointed, though, that some of the other games were overlooked for either remakes or upscaled versions.

53:06.000 --> 53:13.000
All right. Well, we could probably spend a whole three hours talking about Nintendo Directs. I'm sure there's going to be many YouTubes of that length that are doing that.

53:13.000 --> 53:22.000
However, we still have some other headlines to cover. I want to talk about the other company that spent an hour talking about their upcoming releases, and I want to talk a little bit about BlizzConline.

53:22.000 --> 53:31.000
Now, BlizzCon usually happens in, what, like October, maybe November? Obviously, it didn't happen in 2020. We all know the reason.

53:31.000 --> 53:41.000
But they weren't able to kind of pivot to an online forum fast enough, so they kind of did the online announcements thing now in February.

53:41.000 --> 53:54.000
So, we kind of got like October's BlizzCon this past weekend, and there were quite a few things announced. I'll have Loki in a minute give the rundown, but Dark Soccer, I know one thing in particular caught your eye when it came to BlizzCon.

53:54.000 --> 54:08.000
Yeah, I mean, I was a big fan of The Lost Vikings, and I even remember playing World of Warcraft and being really excited to find them in one of the instances.

54:08.000 --> 54:16.000
So, that's really fun to me. Dan is super excited about rock and roll racing. He loves that game so much.

54:16.000 --> 54:24.000
And all of that, of course, is in the Blizzard Arcade Collection, which is going to put together those classics that just came out.

54:24.000 --> 54:35.000
But the other thing I think is cool, which might actually get me a little bit into the WoW classic, is Burning Crusade, because that's when they started fixing how fucking terrible the game playing was.

54:35.000 --> 54:50.000
It would be kind of nice to experience some of those things for the first time, because I didn't play that long. Then again, knowing me, I'd probably go, oh yeah, this is why I didn't like it and not play.

54:50.000 --> 54:59.000
I'm completely uninterested in Shadowlands. Completely uninterested, because they fucked up Sylvanas.

54:59.000 --> 55:03.000
Yeah, the story is very controversial in that regard, yeah.

55:04.000 --> 55:11.000
They fucked up one of my favorite characters, so I'm done. I'll be honest, they haven't had a good storyline since Legion.

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
And that was the last one I enjoyed playing. So, no.

55:16.000 --> 55:23.000
Back on the classic though, Burning Crusade was really the first one. I did have an account during Vanilla, and I think I played for a couple months.

55:23.000 --> 55:27.000
But I didn't really get sucked in until Burning Crusade. That was the one.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Remember the computer you gave me?

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Yeah, we were raiding during Burning Crusade.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
It was installed on that computer, and it still ran.

55:33.000 --> 55:41.000
Yeah, yeah. That's right. I had it on that little left that's right, because Blizzard's been supporting Macs for the longest time.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
Macbook G4.

55:42.000 --> 55:49.000
Yeah, WoW was on that, yeah. I think I played Wrath of the Lich King on that. I don't think it had a great framerate, but it was there.

55:49.000 --> 55:59.000
But anyway, I do love that that's coming to WoW Classic, and I think it's very interesting too, because there are probably going to be some people that are like, no, I want WoW Classic.

55:59.000 --> 56:05.000
I don't ever want to go to Burning Crusade. But they're going to give people the option. You can either keep your character on a Vanilla server.

56:05.000 --> 56:12.000
No, I think you can keep it on the server it's on, and that server is going to progress into Burning Crusade.

56:12.000 --> 56:18.000
Or you can transfer it to a Vanilla Forever server. So it is interesting they're giving people the choice.

56:18.000 --> 56:28.000
And I wonder, I was just gonna say, I wonder if there won't be a Wrath of the Lich King, because that was really when WoW peaked for a lot of people.

56:28.000 --> 56:36.000
I wonder if that won't be a thing in another year or two, that they'll put the classic servers to that and then that's kind of where they will stop.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
Probably.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
Yeah. Anyway, sorry, Jamie?

56:39.000 --> 56:53.000
No, I honestly enough, I wish that there was something like if you have an active subscription to like just the main game, that you had the full access to all of those varieties of servers.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
You do.

56:54.000 --> 57:03.000
If you do, if you subscribe to main WoW, Classic is included with that. And there is no separate classic. It's just a WoW sub and WoW gets you access.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
You just pick the server then.

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
Yeah.

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
I thought that it was like a separate install or something.

57:08.000 --> 57:18.000
It is a separate install, but you don't have to pay a separate fee. As far as the money is concerned, the money is, it's a WoW sub and it's a little drop down in the Battle.net client.

57:18.000 --> 57:26.000
Kind of like when you're switching to Public Test Realm, you can use a drop down to play WoW Classic as opposed to WoW Current.

57:26.000 --> 57:32.000
Gotcha. Well, neither of them are worth it for me unless I can just play, you know, Cataclysm again and then I can play Legion again.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
And it'll be happy because those were the two good ones.

57:35.000 --> 57:40.000
So it'll be interesting to see if they do some servers frozen in time for all those expansions. We'll see.

57:40.000 --> 57:46.000
OK, so Blizzard Arcade, Burning Crusade, Loki, what else came out of BlizzCon?

57:46.000 --> 57:55.000
All right. So they also had talked about that they're remaking Diablo 2, which had been like kind of rumored for the longest time now.

57:55.000 --> 58:00.000
So better, you know, fully 3D graphics now.

58:00.000 --> 58:05.000
They're going to have cross progression against both PC and console.

58:05.000 --> 58:13.000
And they're also doing a remaster of the original game, the expansion Lord of Destruction as well.

58:13.000 --> 58:18.000
And all cinematics will be recreated and updated shot for shot.

58:18.000 --> 58:25.000
Hopefully that's that's actually being done in like Warcraft 3 where they said they were going to do that and didn't.

58:25.000 --> 58:31.000
Yeah, I'm super excited about this, by the way. I'm really excited to jump back into the world of Diablo 2.

58:31.000 --> 58:37.000
I think it's interesting that it's PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and not the last generation.

58:37.000 --> 58:41.000
They're making it for the newer consoles. I find that interesting.

58:41.000 --> 58:45.000
Well, it still may be compatible with the other systems.

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
I also kind of wonder what cross progression really means.

58:48.000 --> 58:54.000
Like, OK, if I make a character on PC, then I guess I can use that character on console.

58:54.000 --> 59:01.000
But can I play with my friends, like in real time, or is that still going to be separated like it is in Diablo 3?

59:01.000 --> 59:04.000
Yeah. So there's still some questions I have with that.

59:04.000 --> 59:10.000
Even the cross progression is interesting, although does that mean I have to buy the game three times if I want to play on all my systems?

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
You know, little things like that, I'd still kind of like to know.

59:13.000 --> 59:22.000
But in general, I will buy the Diablo 2 remaster at least once, because that was a great game and I'm excited to see what they do with it.

59:22.000 --> 59:32.000
And then along the lines of Diablo, they talked about Diablo 4 as well, showed off the rogue class, so that's something.

59:32.000 --> 59:37.000
And then there was some gameplay with that, too, and it looks really hot. I'm into it.

59:37.000 --> 59:42.000
Yeah. And then talked about, was it Shadowlands Chains of Dominion?

59:42.000 --> 59:48.000
And what else? We talked about the Burning Crusade expansion for WoW Classic.

59:48.000 --> 59:52.000
Hearthstone's getting a new expansion called Forged in the Barrens.

59:52.000 --> 59:58.000
The Blizzard Arcade Collection, which is pretty awesome.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000
And Lost Vikings, Rock and Roll Racing and Blackthorn.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
I've only played two of those. I haven't played Blackthorn.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Yeah. And then, was there anything about Overwatch 2?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Okay, so here's what happened with that. In the keynote, their hour-long opening ceremonies, they didn't really mention Overwatch at all.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I mean, they name checked the Overwatch League and Overwatch stuff was still in the sizzle reels and all that stuff, but they really kind of left it out.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:36.000
So a lot of Overwatch fans after the keynote were kind of like, the fuck? Like, where's our update?

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:44.000
What happened is that then they continued, like BlizzCon wasn't just an hour long, they continued with panels throughout the weekend.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:52.000
And if you went right on over to Overwatch, that channel, and started watching there, which I think is what they carried on the main channel,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000
because probably they knew it would be probably the beefiest thing, they did go into some more detail for Overwatch 2.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000
And they showed off some new maps. They showed off that there's going to be like PvE with talent trees.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000
They showed off that there was going to be, that the characters had aged.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000
So like Soldier 76 and Reinhardt have beards now. What? Or all these other characters have beards.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Oh my goodness, so different.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Oh my gosh, they're so old. So there's that.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:24.000
But it is a little weird to me that they didn't say any of that in the keynote when they really had everybody's attention.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I think that was a real misstep about the keynote, and to kind of, like, well I should let you finish.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
There weren't any other updates though, right? I think you hit everything.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
No, that was it.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:47.000
So, the only thing with the thing overall is that, now, you have to remember, usually these presentations are done with a lot of screaming fans in the Anaheim Convention Center.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:57.000
So obviously something always felt a little bit off with that. Although, I don't know, I think they did the best they could as far as that went in the pandemic kind of situation.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.000
But I was watching it along here at VOG Network. We were hosting it and I was commenting in chat.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:10.000
And one thing I noticed, it kicked off and they had this nice little company love reel going on thing.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Ten minutes into their hour-long presentation, one sixth of the way into their hour-long presentation, they still had not named a single game or product that was new or upcoming or anything.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Because that whole ten minutes had been kind of like, yay Blizzard, yay community, yay our fans, we miss you, and all that kind of fluff.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
I understand why they have to do that. Blizzard does have a great community and all that stuff.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:48.000
But do you think maybe you could have given two of those minutes to just say, we do have some more information coming for Overwatch 2 throughout the weekend, including some new map reveals and what are these talent trees?

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Stay tuned to the Overwatch panel coming up next for more information.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:03:07.000
That's all they had to do, I think, to really kind of quench the Overwatch people who really felt like through that whole Metallica concert, looking on Twitter and stuff, the Overwatch fans were pissed.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:15.000
And I understand. I've been there. I've been the Diablo fan that got nothing at a prior BlizzCon and it sucks.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:21.000
But, well hey, at least you're not Starcraft because they really got nothing.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:28.000
But I also thought, and I thought the way it ended was kind of, eh, that's it.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:36.000
He did, Jay Allard did a lot of like talking up of like, and we've got some other things to show you even in some new worlds.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
We're going to take you to some new places and things you've never been or done.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Like almost like they're getting ready to announce a new IP, which would be a great thing for Blizzard right now.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.000
And then they didn't, not even a frame, not even a picture, nothing.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Now, I understand Blizzard is maybe hopeful that they're going to have a convention this fall.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Although, you know, again, I'm not going to try to predict the state of the world.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
You, you, you, you guess whatever you want.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:09.000
But Blizzard assumes they're going to do some type of announcements again in the fall and maybe they're saving their new IP for that.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Okay, but did you have to give us that dirty of a tease there at the end to lead to a big nothing burger?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Like again, couldn't you have just used that time instead to say, we have some exciting additions coming to Overwatch 2 as well.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Although we're not going to be able to release the game in 2021, we want to update our fans on the latest of what's going on in the Overwatch world.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Like how fucking difficult is that?

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000
So I, I don't understand their logic and how they plan that out.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Because I'll tell you, you know, maybe the Overwatch fans at the end when all was said and done were okay.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:53.000
But there's a lot of people like me who only watch the keynote and then had to kind of like get back to their other stuff that they had going on, like work or whatever.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:59.000
So they missed an opportunity to still not kind of put that stuff in front of me and many people like me.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
So that's my thought on that.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.000
TigerConChat says, so no jaw dropping announcement at this year's BlizzCon?

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Confirmation of the Diablo 2 remaster I think is probably their big thing.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000
I actually think the Blizzard Arcade and the surprise that's out today.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:25.000
And the fact that it's not just like a port of those games, but they really kind of went in and touched them up.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Did some quality of life things, the interviews, the widescreen support, the actual music in rock and roll racing if you want it.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Even though don't stream it that way.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:50.000
But like all of that, I thought as far as like what they announced, they had a better year this year than, was it two years ago when they, or was it, no I guess it was 20, was it just 2019?

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:57.000
That they announced Diablo Immortal and then they got, they got, they got dragged on that one.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Like this was a better BlizzCon than that.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000
And they had some announcements and they had a product that was, it's out now.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:09.000
So there's that. And it's even something Bobby Blackwolf is interested in, the rock and roll racing.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:17.000
So anyway, I actually think when all is said and done, despite the fact I'm nitpicking a little bit when it comes to, you know, what they could have done better.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
I think it was probably a better keynote than some of the ones they've had in person.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:27.000
How about that, how about that BlizzCon where the big announcement was the Demon Hunter is coming to Diablo.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Was that 20, I don't remember when that was, but that was a rough year.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Was it 2013? No, it had to be before that.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Diablo 3 has been out a while.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
But yeah, anyway.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Alright, so there you go for BlizzCon.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:50.000
We've had a lot of kickoff topics tonight, but there's just, there's just so many things going on in the gaming world that are all fighting for our attention.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000
We do have some more headlines to get into, but I did want to take a minute to do our traditional,

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
How was your gaming week and talk about some of the video games that we have been playing this week.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
So DarkSakura, why don't we start with you? How was your gaming week?

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Animal Crossing.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Well, I mean, and I borrowed your Ring Fit Adventure. I haven't started it yet.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Yesterday I had thrown out my back working on something, so I was like, yeah, maybe I should rest that first.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
But you are in possession of the Ring Fit Adventure. That did happen this week.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
I am, yes.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
And you were in possession of cookies.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
And the cookies were great. Alan and I both enjoyed them.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000
I made black sesame cookies, which taste vaguely peanut butter-like.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000
And they're dark and goth and delicious.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Anyway.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:45.000
We really haven't done a whole bunch of play of anything because we're going to be starting some of the Capcom stuff when Dan gets home.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.000
So we've just really kind of had a slacker week for playing much of anything.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
I'm still playing word scapes.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000
I made a 25th place in the last tournament.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Good job.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Word scapes.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.000
And I like to come up with words that I know that they won't let me pick.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Like, you know, anal.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:14.000
They never let you play anal or like urea or bones or body parts that are actual real words.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I'm pretty sure I put dyke in one of them.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
And I think it went I think it went to the bonus list.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I don't remember.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
I just played lube.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
It's a word.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
You could be talking about WD40.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
You don't have to be talking about, you know.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
But I mean, it's just it's just pretty funny for me.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
It's sort of like, how can I flex my vocabulary?

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.000
It's like what I do to wake up in the morning to get my brain to wake up.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
It's a nice little mental exercise.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Yeah. So it's really fun.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:51.000
You know, people want kind of a neat word game and check their spelling ability and.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
What words they know, then try it.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000
So right after I played lube, I played rub.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
All right.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
If that's it for your gaming week, I will go to Loki.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.000
How is your gaming week now that your game is out there and you don't have to worry about that?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
The pressure of that?

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Well, I didn't play a whole ton of games.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I played some Minecraft during the week, just kind of relax to that.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:23.000
I mainly was just taking a break from computer stuff during the week, trying to watch more TV.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:30.000
But yeah, so I was also trying to promote the game during the week, but, you know, little luck there.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
But keep at it.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000
All right. My gaming week, I played I played quite a bit.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.000
I played, as I was talking about a little earlier, I was playing that Capcom arcade stadium.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
I did pick that up as soon as I heard the announcement.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.000
If you aren't already aware, you can get it on switch and you get it with nineteen forty three for free.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.000
And you may not realize this, but if you go in the store, you can also get ghosts and goblins for free right now.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
I think that's a limited time thing to like maybe March 1st.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
There's actually two free games available right now.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
I went all in and just bought them all.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I was like, fuck it. Why not? I like a lot of these old Capcom classics.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
I'm going to buy it.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
I think the stadium is a pretty well together, well put together collection.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:16.000
You know, they kind of theme it like you're in this old arcade with all the little like little sit down cabinets and, you know, so forth.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000
And you can actually play the game like it's being projected on one of those cabinets.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
I don't like those over the top graphic filters myself.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
I understand the place for them, though. Some people enjoy them.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.000
But the nice thing is you can just play normal fucking on your TV like it's fine.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000
So I played a little bit of Strider I was talking about, which boy, I'm fucking terrible at that game.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
That's one thing I learned. I'm very, very bad. Huh?

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Everyone is.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I know it's hard. It's a hard game.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:48.000
I played that. I played a little bit of Super Street Fighter, which I'm also apparently really bad at.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
So I think I need to turn down the difficulty or something.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
So, yeah, I was playing some of the games that collection.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000
It's interesting because they have like a little like tournament modes like you can actually play.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
So I did the one for ghosts and goblins.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:06.000
And it was basically like for this week, you're going to do this and you're trying to get the high score you can at like three times speed.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000
So you have to play the game at triple speed, which I mean, that game is impossible as it is already.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
But try playing it on triple speed and then you get like these.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I think they're like Capcom points. I don't know what they're called.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000
They have a name to them like these these little pink numbers that appear in the upper right hand corner.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:29.000
And they unlock things like additional frames that you can put around the screens as you're playing them and things like that.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:35.000
So I think it's it's cute. It was a little more than just, you know, pick a game from the menu and play it.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:44.000
They really made sure the games are very customizable, that there's online modes where you can do different things and kind of mess with the game, I guess.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Oh, and this is cool. The shooter games like 1943, you can play them sideways.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:56.000
You can even do it on a TV, but it's great for when your switch is undocked because you can play a shooter game.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000
You can actually play it vertically or any of those Capcom games. That's pretty cool, too.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:09.000
So, yeah, I recommend check out the collection. You can just play the free games that are out right now and then decide if, you know, it's worth more money to you for the other games that are in there.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
So it's kind of fun. I enjoyed it.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.000
I've been continuing, of course, Final Fantasy 14. But what else is new? I play that game all the time.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:23.000
I've also been playing Final Fantasy 12. A lot of that. I talked about that a little bit last week. It's on Xbox Game Pass now.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000
I am now past the point in 12. That's like the furthest point I've gotten to before.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I got to Mount Buromis, I think is what it's called. And that is the point that I was left off at on a prior playthrough.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:43.000
I'm really enjoying it. I feel like the story and the mechanics have really aged well.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I think there's so much, especially being a longtime 14 player, there's so much in 12 that 14 took influence from, which of course makes sense.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000
I mean, I've always said 14 is an evil-ese game, whether they want to admit it or not.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.000
But also a lot of the development team from 12 worked on 14. It's very, very obvious.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000
So I just, I love 12. There's so many great things in it.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:13.000
But I also played, so this weekend, Xbox was doing like a free Fusor weekend.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
So the Harmonix game Fusor has been available this weekend for free.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Time's almost up though, so if you haven't picked it up by now, I think you're kind of out of luck because probably at midnight Eastern is when it goes away.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
But I don't know, somebody might know the exact time.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000
But basically if you have Xbox Gold, you can play Fusor for free over the weekend.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
And so I finally checked it out.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:40.000
And that is the music game where you're basically taking different tracks from different songs and overlaying them over each other.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
And you want to do things on the downbeat.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:51.000
And then as you progress, you learn like, oh, but certain, sometimes you want to do it kind of in the middle because that's the point when like the vocals really kick in.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
So you get like a bonus for that.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:59.000
If you can time when you're going to drop that Rick Astley record right so he can go, never going to give you up, you know.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000
I will say, and also it's drop mix, but it's a game.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.000
I will say the technology of making your own mixes is a lot of fun.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
And I think especially like the freestyle mode is a lot of fun.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000
The game is OK.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:22.000
But like, you know, OK, I'm mixing in requests from the audience and I'm trying to time things perfectly on the beat.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:37.000
It doesn't really have that same satisfaction, I guess, that something like playing amplitude or rock band rivals or something like it doesn't really give the same, I guess, satisfaction that some of those games bring.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000
But I really do love some of the creations that I've made in the game.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Like I've really learned like, wow, Pump It Up or Pump It Up, Push It has a really great bass line that mixes with almost every song.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:55.000
And like every single part of Donna Summer's Hot Stuff is great.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
And you can mix it with literally anything and it sounds good.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
So Donna Summer is a goddess.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Yes, that is true.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:11.000
That is true. And there's there's I will say the song list, even though when I looked at it, I was kind of it has been curated very specifically for songs that really work like that.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
And I think that's done very well for them.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000
All of that being said, 60 dollars.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000
I get making games is expensive and licensing the music.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.000
And it's not just licensing the music because they have stripped these songs.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:34.000
I mean, you know, you have just the vocals, you have just the keyboard part and all this stuff like.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:43.000
I get that there's stuff with that. That being said, the game they are giving at the end of the day, I don't think I can justify 60 bucks for it.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:51.000
It's too much. And then they have DLC and then they have these, you know, one hundred dollar editions with all these other songs and so forth.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.000
It's just. It's too much. Sorry.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:02.000
It's too much of a premium for what it is. I think once the game comes down to 20 bucks, I'll buy it for sure.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:09.000
But I think this is where something like drop mix that was actually tangible, I can pick it up and take it to a friend's house.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000
It's a physical thing. You know, the card mechanic is really interesting.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:20.000
I think that's where the high premium cost lends itself a lot better when it's actually a physical thing.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:28.000
So, yeah, I like Fuser, but I don't like it. Sixty dollars. I get that it's on sale right now for like 40.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Still a little high for me for what it is. Yeah.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:40.000
So fifth dream in chat says, I love the idea of the game, but the chances of them ever having a song I listen to it.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Well, I will say, though, there's a lot of songs in it that maybe wouldn't be on my playlist of music,

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000
but they're songs that I recognize.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:57.000
And when you break them down and put them back together into new songs, I do have that whole reaction of, huh, that sounds really neat.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Some of them have been garbage. I put together some real garbage songs, but I've put together some songs where I was like, I really like that.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Loki, you especially. What's that? Can you save them?

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:16.000
You can. I haven't played around a lot with that, but I know there is like a big community presence in there.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:24.000
And if you have your deck loaded a certain way, you can save it to a favorites thing so you can pop all the records in there automatically at some point.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:31.000
So there are some little techniques they have for macro. But I was going to say, Loki, I know you did a lot of mixing and stuff back in the day.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.000
I think you'd get a kick out of this game if you haven't played it yet. Again, I don't think I have.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.000
You'd be pissed if you paid 60 for it. But yeah, I didn't want to pay 60 bucks for it.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:45.000
I think if they do another free weekend or it comes down in price, you should really check it out. I think you'd have fun with it.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:50.000
All right. Yeah, let's check it out. So that was my gaming week. All right.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:57.000
So let's get into some headlines. We've got a lot of stories to cover still, and we're an hour and a half in.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000
So we should get to these stories. So, Loki, I'll start with you.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:11.000
So Microsoft has this brand new feature for some of the backwards compatibility games called Frame Rate Boost or FPS Boost, I guess is what it's called.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:22.000
And it is right now supporting about five games. Far Cry 4, New Super Lucky's Tale, Sniper Elite 4, UFC 4 and Watch Dogs 2.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:29.000
And they're going to be adding more games to that. Now, what that does is it allows certain games to run at a higher frame rate.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:35.000
So, for example, some games that were previously 30 FPS are now 60 FPS.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Or in the case of New Super Lucky's Tale, it actually runs at 120 FPS.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:49.000
So apparently this is also something that's compatible with the Xbox Series S as well.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:19:00.000
So pretty awesome. They found some new techniques, I guess, with the DirectX part of that to be able to push higher frame rates at not much of a system cost.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:07.000
So pretty cool to see some of that being added to some of these games. 60 FPS always makes things better.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:12.000
And I know like certain games like Watch Dogs 2, that looks pretty nice.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:18.000
You know, one thing I didn't talk about during my gaming week is Pokémon GO because they had a huge event on Saturday.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000
And I am tying this to what you just said, Loki. I'm not changing the subject suddenly.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:26.000
But I played Pokémon GO on Saturday because they had a huge event.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:36.000
And it was a really good motivating event for me to like get out and go around town and drive around and walk around and really try to collect a lot of Pokémon really fast for all the collection challenges.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:47.000
But one of the challenges because it was set up like the original Pokémon game where only some Pokémon were for the red people and some Pokémon were for the green people, you had to do some trading.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:54.000
So I did some trading with Alan because it turns out you didn't have to get the Pokémon during the event to get credit for them.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.000
So Alan hasn't really played Pokémon GO in a while, but he has a lot of old Pokémon on his account.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:04.000
So I got to play Pokémon GO on his phone for just a little bit because I hadn't really seen it on his newest phone.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:10.000
And I was like, the frame rate on your phone is so much better than what I'm getting.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:19.000
And I'd heard something about for whatever reason the iOS version is frame blocked or whatever. I guess maybe it had optimization problems or whatever.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:26.000
But I noticed it. So that is the part that ties into what you're saying. When you have like that higher frame rate and everything, you really do notice it.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:35.000
It plays so smoothly. And I was like, man, I hope they figure it out on the other side so I can get the game this smooth because I know it's capable.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:40.000
So Act Def says it's 120 hertz. Wow.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Oh, wow. Anyway, I'm sorry. I don't know if you had anything else to say to that story, but I want to know that really.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Yeah, that's about it. Yeah.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Yeah. Microsoft isn't. You know, it's funny, especially considering there was a time when Microsoft was like, fuck backwards compatibility.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
No one wants that. You know, that was under one leader.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:05.000
And then they had a new leader who's paid a lot of attention to backwards compatibility and really kind of making the old stuff stronger.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:12.000
And then even even things that are relatively newer, kind of, you know, making them even better through the latest technology,

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:24.000
especially when there haven't been a lot of like PlayStation five or Series X exclusive or optimized or whatever you want to call games that have come out yet of these new consoles.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:30.000
It's nice to have these enhancements come out regularly that make the old games feel new again.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:35.000
That makes sense. Yeah. All right.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Act up to saying it's not necessarily the frame rate that's higher, but it's a different hurt setting.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:47.000
It's so smooth. I love it. So the display refresh rate might be one hundred twenty hertz on his phone.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Interesting. I don't even know what kind of phone he has. We're we're we're a bi-phonal household.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.000
I have an Apple phone. He has a Samsung phone. So we we love all types here in this house.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Do you have a good phone? I like my phone. Fine.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000
So I'm saying you have a good phone. Yeah. Well, Alan would say he has a good phone, too.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.000
He likes what he likes. I like what I like. All right. Anyway, let's move on.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Let's talk let's talk about a good classic franchise. Let's talk about Silent Hill.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Sadly, I have no news on Silent Hill, but I have news about the creator of Silent Hill, Kichiro Toyama, who created Silent Hill, Siren, Gravity Rush.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:34.000
You may not realize he was involved with that, too. But of course, he left Sony in 2020 and he started his own company, Bokeh Game Studio.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.000
And a little bit more information has come out about the first project.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:46.000
And he says it is inspired by his past as a horror game designer. A video came out called Focus.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.000
And in this video is kind of an interview and he talks about the creative process.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:58.000
And there are some concept art that's shown for this untitled debut game coming from Bokeh Game Studios.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:05.000
And so if you were into Siren or Silent Hill, you're probably going to be into what these guys are cooking up.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Now, of course, some people are saying, well, is it Silent Hill they're making?

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I'm not sure. I don't I almost wonder if it's a little bit like Igarashi and Bloodstained where it's like, we're not making Silent Hill wink.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:29.000
We're making Loud Valley. Yeah, Loud Valley. Exactly. Or Quiet Mountain.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:34.000
You know, it's going to be something, you know, very, very similar. But we'll see.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:39.000
I also, because I know this is another series, you talk a lot about Dark Sakura.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:51.000
As part of the interview, Toyama talked about being interested in the trend of death game entertainment like Danganronpa or the anime franchise Mirai Nikki as being an inspiration for this.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
So there could be some Danganronpa in your Quiet Mountain.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:04.000
So interesting. The idea, the idea of regular people driven into irrational situations will likely show up in the game.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Hmm. By the way, there was a rumor that Akira Yamaoka was making music for an upcoming game.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Hmm. Hmm. Again, I have a feeling they're not making Silent Hill, but they're probably making Quiet Mountain.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:26.000
So something to think about. Hmm. Anyway, of course, now, now everybody in chat has their own names.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Sia Diberi says, Shh, Savannah.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I picked Loud Valley because it's a quiet, it's opposite of Silent Hill.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:41.000
I know, but I, I love, come on, tell me the name. Shh, Savannah isn't fucking funny. That's funny.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
And it's kind of funny.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:50.000
What was the other name? Moderately Loud Mesa. That's a good one, too. Quiet Country.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:55.000
I love that you guys are all just lighting up with your knockoff names.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:03.000
It's great. What I ordered online versus when it arrived. No, I know that that particular analogy isn't appropriate here because I'm sure the game will be fine.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Are we making the Wish version of Silent Hill?

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:10.000
No, I don't want to put that label on it because, A, we haven't seen a frame of gameplay. We've only seen concept art.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:19.000
And B, it might be really good, like bloodstains pretty good. So I, I don't want to necessarily say this is going to be a cheap ass version of Silent Hill.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:26.000
It actually, it could be better. Let's give it that opportunity.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Hushed Hollow. Sanctuary of Silence. Oh, good question.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000
I play that.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Orange Right in chat says, I'm sorry, I didn't credit Pod Culture for Hushed Hollow, Phoenix 7726 for Sanctuary of Silence.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Orange Right is bringing up the cat ending. Yes. Well, here's the thing. In Savannah, you get a dog ending.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:53.000
No, wait, no, the dog ending is Silent Hill. I'm sorry, cat ending is, never mind, I screwed that up. I get it.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.000
And instead of a UFO ending, you get like a ghost ending.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
You get a paranormal ending.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000
You get a werewolf ending.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Sacred Jade. Pipe down planes.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
All right.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Sia Tabiri brings up, no, but apparently there's a Five Nights at Freddy's knockoff movie that just came out with Nicolas Cage.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.000
And I watched it and it was awesome. You saw the movie? Really? I did watch it, yeah.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Oh, wow. Now that looked like the Wish version, but like in the good way, where like Showgirls is unironically good.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:35.000
It was, it was OK. It wasn't like.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
It was, it was cheesy.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.000
I don't know. They had parts that were really good.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:51.000
And then parts like, it's not a complete ripoff. It's, it's similar, but it's not the same.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Sia Tabiri in chat says that Savannah has a guinea pig ending.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000
I know how to get Dark Soccer on board. How about a possum ending?

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Yes, it needs a possum ending. I'll play that.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Yeah. So you can watch the movie. They have it available like through, I think, Voodoo right now.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.000
I think that's where I rented it. And it's like 20 bucks to watch Willy's Wonderland.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Yeah. I'm waiting for those premium fees to fade a little bit because I want to see.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Everybody is telling me because I love movies like cheesy comedies like Romy Michelle's High School.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Everybody's telling me that I would love that Kristen Wiig movie. The Barb and Star go to Vista Del Mar or something like that.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Speaking of movies, did you want to catch the trailer for Mortal Kombat?

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Oh, good question. Good aside here before we get to the next story. Yes, I did.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:44.000
And it looks pretty cool. I mean, obviously you didn't like it.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Ava and Melina. Oh, yeah. Where's your fights?

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Yeah, but they apparently they do have more for Melina. It's just they haven't shown that stuff yet.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000
But apparently she does look like the original.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:02.000
That's why I'm trying to cut him some slack on two is that maybe there's more to it than just the one scene we saw.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:08.000
But I'm not a big violent person, though, but whatever.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Moral Kombat is so over the top. It's a little. But even like that scene with like Sub-Zero and Jax's arms, I was like, oh, God, that's too much.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.000
You know, like, wow. But it looks good when they do a better trailer.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I might be a little bit more excited about it. But the only thing that really looks exciting to me was them going into I mean,

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:35.000
it's clearly the original Sub-Zero, the one who was an asshole.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:42.000
But I think I don't like the the audience insertion character call or whatever his name.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Oh, yeah. Like what the deal is, they're fucking unnecessary.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:54.000
We don't need it. We don't need a character insertion, you know, an audience representative in it,

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.000
because the people who are going to see Mortal Kombat, no fucking Mortal Kombat.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Mortal Kombat. We don't need it.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.000
They said they wanted to make a new character because they always introduce new characters in Mortal Kombat games.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:10.000
I don't think. Yeah, I get it. Yeah, I agree with you. It's kind of stupid.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000
And where's Johnny Cage? They're saving Johnny Cage for the sequel.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000
They didn't want it. They wouldn't want to burn every character right away.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:22.000
I think that's what the deal is with Johnny Cage. Maybe Cole is new Sub-Zero.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.000
I bet I bet there's a twist like that that happens. But obviously, I don't know.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Obviously, I don't know anything. But but if they're sticking to any resemblance of canon,

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:39.000
then it's somebody else who's a different Sub-Zero. It would be another Lin Kuei.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
So, oh, we'll see. No, it's just it's just terrible. Yeah.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:48.000
And like Sacred Jade said, Sub-Zero becomes Bihan. Well, Bihan is Sub-Zero, but who also later becomes Noob Saibot.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:56.000
So don't don't get me started on. I'm still pissed off about Sindel, OK?

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Yeah. Where was Sindel in that trailer? No, I'm pissed off about what the last game did to her.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Oh, yeah. All right. Let's move on, though. Sorry, we had a quick aside, but that was worth bringing up because you're right.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:11.000
I didn't have the trailer in a story slot. So. All right. Let's talk about game leaks.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Well, Rare, I know a lot of folks here know about the origins of games and we all know that.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000
And if you don't know it, then you're about to learn a thing.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Star Fox Adventures began as a game called Dinosaur Planet for the Nintendo 64, of course, by Rare.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:40.000
And a game preservationist, Forest of Illusion, obtained a copy of the game fully playable.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:49.000
I mean, some of the stuff is glitchy and doesn't necessarily play well, but it is the build from December 1st, 2000.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:54.000
So it's a late build of the game and it needed a little work to be playable to the end.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:31:04.000
And so they actually have the ROM available for download through their Twitter.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Actually, their main link on their website went down, so they put up another one, but it's available through their Twitter account.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:20.000
But it was supposed to be like the big ending, you know, for the N64 was to have this game come out.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:26.000
It had environments and dialogue that used the RAM expansion pack and it was a 512 megabyte cartridge.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Would have been the biggest on the console. And, yeah, no.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:38.000
This is, by the way, the same group that did the Zelda 64 beta earlier this year.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Oh, OK.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:49.000
I downloaded it, so we'll see how that goes. I don't have an EverDrive for my N64, but, you know, with a little bit of work, I could probably play it on my emulator.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Yeah. It's interesting to see these relics from the past kind of show up, even though, you know, I know we get into dicey territory with what should we be looking at versus what shouldn't we.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:05.000
But, you know, especially since this did kind of end up becoming something else anyway, I think it's an interesting part of gaming's history.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000
So I'm kind of glad it's at least preserved, if nothing else.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:14.000
And the bits that I've seen of it, I thought it was going to be a great game.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:18.000
I mean, it looks like it was supposed to be pretty good.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:38.000
I mean, and the thing is, is that when the legend said that Miyamoto saw the footage and thought that it should be remade into a game with Fox McCloud, and that basically the team didn't really care for that idea a lot because they had to rewrite different places to accommodate Star Fox.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:51.000
And then they had to change a lot of the game structure. But basically, you know, they were all really attached to Dinosaur Planet and had to change gears to put it in Star Fox.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:33:01.000
But to be able to go back and play what would have been the original game would have been great.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:06.000
So I'm actually pretty excited about this.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:17.000
You know, there were characters that were kind of small characters in Star Fox 64 that had bigger roles in Dinosaur Planet.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:26.000
And then, you know, so you can play through it and see elements that made it into Star Fox 64.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:31.000
But honestly, I think Dinosaur Planet would have just been fun on its own.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:40.000
It was pretty annoying, pretty annoying, pretty annoyed that, you know, it was something that didn't come out.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:51.000
And of course, there was also that playable build that they found of Goldeneye Xbox Live Arcade. So another leak.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Yeah. All coming from the rare stuff. So, yeah.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:02.000
All right. Well, let's move on with another story. Classic Game of the Week coming up. But first, Loki.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Yeah. So there was this big Skyrim mod called Wormstooth that was developed back in actually quite a while ago.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:17.000
It was removed from Nexus mods back in 2016, apparently by the original author.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Now he has brought it back and has brought it back with a brand new trailer, which is pretty awesome.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.000
So one of the things I thought was actually kind of unique about this is the actual trailer itself.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:34.000
So he uses a text to speech A.I. to recreate the Skyrim voice actors.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:42.000
And it sounds really cool, which makes me think, you know, hey, when people are putting together these new expansions to the game,

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:47.000
a lot of times they will have their own voice actors come in and do the lines.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Well, now they could just use this A.I. to generate basically the dialogue for the game using the original voice actors,

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:04.000
which may get them in some hot water or not. Who knows? But it's pretty cool.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:10.000
So it's available now if you want to check it out on Nexus mods.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:15.000
All right. I have to get Alan's impressions on that because he loves the Skyrim mod stuff.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000
So I don't know. That has to be on his radar. Yeah.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Wormstooth adds a whole new like island to basically explore and there's a bunch of side quests and stuff in there.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:32.000
They have new companions. You can get like a wolf follower and lots of cool stuff to go along with that.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:39.000
So it looks cool. I have to really go back in the more Skyrim again.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000
It's been fun. My kid actually wanted me to get it for him.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:48.000
So I picked up a switch version as well. So they're going to be playing Skyrim.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:53.000
All right. Well, moving on to a story that's pretty frustrating.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Honestly, it's another Stadia story. I'm sorry, but they keep they keep taking headlines.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:07.000
What can I say? Apparently, the folks at Google that were laid off from Stadia were pretty shocked by the news because just the week prior,

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:12.000
vice president and general manager Phil Harrison had sent out an email to everybody that said,

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:19.000
great progress that the studios have made so far. And then the mass layoffs came just a few days later.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:30.000
An email that was sent by Phil Harrison said, Stadia Games Entertainment has made great progress building a diverse and talented team and establishing a strong lineup of Stadia exclusive games.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:41.000
We will confirm the SG&E, Stadia Games Entertainment, investment envelope shortly, which will in turn inform the SG&E strategy and 2021 objectives and key results.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Of course, five days later, they were all gone.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000
No comment from Google on this whole thing as well.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:56.000
But I mean, it does also just bring add fuel to the fire where, you know, how the fuck does Phil Harrison still have a job right now?

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.000
I'm just going to be blunt. How does Phil Harrison still have a job right now at Google?

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Because if everybody else was getting cut, cut, he should have got cut, too.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Sorry about it, but this just kind of adds fuel to that fire as far as I'm concerned.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.000
So it'll be interesting to see what ends up in the coming months that come from this.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:23.000
So Jade Raymond also had said in a statement, by the way, after the layoffs, you know, kind of the nice PR thing.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000
I don't think she said anything that you can read too much into.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:32.000
But I am proud of the team we built at Stadia Games Entertainment and the groundbreaking work on exclusive games to the platform.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:40.000
It was a difficult decision to take on a new opportunity, and I will be forever grateful to this team for everything we learned and achieved together.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Yeah. So that is unfortunate how that all went down.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Yeah. Actdeft in chat says, hey, you're doing great. Keep it up. Just not here.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:38:00.000
That's unfortunate. All right. Hope those folks are able to find work that they enjoy within Google or somewhere else like Jade Raymond.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000
All right. Moving on. And excellent counterpoint.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Sorry, I guess not moving on, but excellent counterpoint by Phoenix7726 in chat saying, how does Eves at Ubisoft still have a job after the sexual harassment scandals he covered up?

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:20.000
And how did the CEOs at CD Projekt Red still have a job right now? I thought for sure one of them would be gone by this point.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Isn't that isn't that shitty how all the people in power just never want to leave power?

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Because the shareholders like money and they don't really care about people.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Well, the thing is, Stadia is not making money.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Well, that's true. It's Google, though. So you don't invest directly in the stadium, invest in Google as a whole.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.000
And true, they're making money. It's just.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:52.000
They just spread themselves too thin with some of this stuff and do a half-assed job about it.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:39:00.000
All right. Well, let's take a trip down memory lane to a time when development was a little bit simpler and at least it was a little more innocent, maybe.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:09.000
It's classic game of the week. And every week, dark soccer steps into the vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, maybe you kids should be playing this game this week.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Dark Sakura, what classic? Well, actually, I already know.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:20.000
So I can say you picked a classic among classics that I'm kind of surprised wasn't in your modern list earlier, actually.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:26.000
I seriously thought I had done this one to meet like I checked the classic game list.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.000
I don't know if you did. Yes, I double checked.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.000
I yeah, I'm usually fine with whatever you say.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.000
But then sometimes I'll have that nagging voice that is like, I swear we did this.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:46.000
And this one somehow wasn't there. Game is portal portal.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:51.000
And I even checked to see if I had just done the orange box, you know? No, no.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.000
But I did think I did. Narbacular drop. You did.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:00.000
So maybe that's what I was thinking of, which Narbacular drop is is pretty fun.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:11.000
But anyway, to go back into portal portal basically was a game that was developed and published by Valve in 2007 that was released with the orange box.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Came out on Windows, Xbox 360 and PS3.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:20.000
And of course, there's been other ports, including Mac OS, Linux and Android.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:29.000
It is a series of puzzles that have to be solved by teleporting through the game using the Aperture Science handheld portal device.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:40.000
And you get a talk to by GLaDOS, who is definitely, well, motivating, I guess.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:41:02.000
I don't know. Chell is, and it's not Chell, it's Chell, as we've heard in various makings of, who is taunted by GLaDOS and still must go through the game and make it to the end through clever use of portals.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:07.000
But going back to a little bit of history of the game.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:25.000
The game was based on a concept from a game called Narbacular Drop that was created by members, by people at DigiPen Institute of Technology, and they were hired by Valve to make Portal.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:30.000
So Portal is actually the spiritual successor to Narbacular Drop.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.000
You can still play Narbacular Drop, by the way.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:49.000
So it was really lauded as one of the most original games to come out, which really says something because we don't really get a lot of people talking about originality.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:56.000
GLaDOS was voiced by Ella McLean, who is absolutely delightful and talented.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:05.000
And then, of course, we had one of my favorite hilarious singers, Jonathan Coulton, do the end song, Still Alive.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:11.000
I've always been a big fan of Jonathan Coulton, so of course I was really, really tickled.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:16.000
And I got to meet him. Remember when we went to PAX?

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:20.000
He let me take all kinds of pictures with him. He was a really nice guy.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Anyway, so Portal has been even cited as one of the greatest games of all times.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Outside of Steam downloads, over 4 million copies of the game have been sold since its release.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:45.000
And there's merchandise, plus weighted companion cubes, and fans making the Black Forest cake because the cake is a lie.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Portal guns, and then there is a standalone called Portal Still Alive that was released on Xbox Live Arcade service in 2008 that had 14 more puzzles.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:01.000
And of course, Portal 2 in 2011, which we will talk about at another time.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Anyway, basically, like I said, you play Chell, you play first person, and you have to use the Portal gun to open an orange and a blue portal in different locations.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:23.000
So one, you know, you exit through whichever one and exit through the other.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:28.000
It's basically moving through three-dimensional space, but you also have physics to play along with it.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:41.000
For example, you know, if you want to fling yourself across a room, you can throw a portal on the top of the wall, like way above you,

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:48.000
and then put a portal on the ground and jump into it, which would give you forward momentum to cover a large gap.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
They do call that flinging.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:58.000
And then, of course, you get reoriented because of gravity when you go into the right-hand portal.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:10.000
So you cannot pass one shot through an open portal. It will deactivate it, and then you have to create a new portal and a new offset.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:23.000
So basically, you can do things like move objects, and you have different wall services, and you can anchor in different places.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Sometimes they won't link to certain walls, so you have that to deal with.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:38.000
And then you're also given these little cubes that you can use to press down buttons and levers and, you know, use it to activate different mechanisms.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:43.000
And then when you're done, you have this particle field called the Emancipation Grill.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Actually, in the developer commentary, they called it Fizzlers.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:59.000
That would allow anything that you carry with you apart from, you know, yourself and the portal gun, and deactivate the portals in the previous room.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:04.000
They also will block any attempt to fire a portal through them.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:18.000
So Chell also wears these heel springs to keep from falling, which I believe they were called the Longfall Boots, or maybe the Longfallboots or Portal 2.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
No, they're Longfallboots.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Okay. And she, you know, she won't die from falling from a great height or anything, but there are other things that can kill you.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Balancing balls of energy, toxic liquid, deadly neurotoxin, and the turret guns.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Turret guns are hilarious and adorable, and I love them.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
I have a couple of little ones.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:52.000
And true story, when I was learning Maya in college, my final presentation was a portal turret.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:57.000
And my teacher liked it so much that he made me shaders and light sources for it.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
So I was pretty happy.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:08.000
So basically if Chell gets a certain amount of damage in a short period of time, she will die.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.000
But she does restore her health fairly quickly.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:16.000
And there are multiple solutions to the puzzles.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:25.000
I mean, yeah, you've got a main way to do it, but sometimes the fun of it is deciding on different ways to solve those puzzles.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:33.000
And then as you keep going, you'll get some different challenge maps.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Advanced chambers, you get when the game is completed.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:46.000
You have challenge mode, so you have to complete, like, test chambers with as little time as possible, or the fewest portals, or the fewest footsteps.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:50.000
The advanced mode are a lot more complicated.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:58.000
So basically you have your two characters, like I said before, and Chell is the silent protagonist.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:07.000
And then there's GLaDOS, that stands for Genetic Life Form and Disk Operating System, who is an AI who is obsessed with testing.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
And you must test. You have to test.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
And GLaDOS is also a liar.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Basically has just made up a lot of crazy backstory that may or may not be facts, such as Chell being adopted, an orphan, having no friends, and questionable.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:32.000
There is also a comic, which I actually super like, called Lab Rat, that talks about the gap between Portal and Portal 2.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:39.000
That basically where Chell was rejected as a test subject for having too much tenacity.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:48.000
And so they used Doug Rattmann. Then you actually get stuff for Rattmann in the second game, but he moved Chell to the top of the test queue.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:48:00.000
So you're in this research facility, and in Portal 2 they said that it's in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:08.000
And the lab is for Aperture Science, which was a competitor with Black Mesa.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Except that Kave Johnson, their founder, was crazy. He was supposed to make shower curtains for the US military, and he became mentally unstable for moon rock poisoning.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:28.000
And we'll get into more of that, because that's all backstory on there, but yeah. They were complete competitors with Black Mesa.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:36.000
And for the record, Pod Culture. Portal, that is not exactly how the line went. I'm a potato.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.000
I think it's, how are you doing? Because I'm a potato.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Because, anyway.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Anyway, so moving forward. As you keep going through the test, you come across a cube that has a heart on it, and it's the Weighted Companion Cube.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:11.000
And it has a heart on it, and it's your friend, but GLaDOS tells you it has to be euthanized through an emergency intelligence incinerator before Chell can continue.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:20.000
And then there's, you know, the turrets have these cute little voices, I don't hate you, you know. And then they're sympathetic when you kill them.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:30.000
And then the final chamber, this is the part where she kills you. Which was actually in Portal 2, there was a part called, this is the part where he kills you.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:39.000
So anyway, you keep having these signs for cake, and GLaDOS talks about cake, but the cake is really a lie.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:48.000
And you get to see graffiti as you're going through the game that has the statements such as, the cake is a lie.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:50:05.000
You have pastiches of the Chariot by Emily Dickinson, and the Reaper in Flowers by Longfellow, and Emily Bronte's No Coward Soul is Mine, but referring to the death of the Companion Cube.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:16.000
So at any rate, you eventually escape through some clever use of portals, and you're playing behind the scenes, which is actually my favorite part of the game.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:28.000
I love going, I have this thing about games where I want to go to the places I'm not supposed to, and in this case the places I'm not supposed to go to are actually the places that you're supposed to go to in the game.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:47.000
So basically, spoiler alert, when you defeat GLaDOS, you're escaped, and then you get dragged away by an unseen entity in a robotic voice that thanks you for assuming the party escort submission position.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:51:06.000
And then the final, final scene is you see the Black Forest cake, and the Weighted Companion Cube, and a mix of inactive personality cores, and then the cake gets, the candle on the cake gets snuffed. Just like that. Just like that.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:09.000
I like the speed runs where they actually get to the cake.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Valve became interested in it at the DigiPen annual career fair, and really wanted to bring them in and have them do work on it.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:58.000
So a lot of really crazy development went into it, and they were given pretty much free reign to make the game as they wanted to, basically without constraints.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:12.000
So they basically worked on gameplay without any narrative. They just wanted to have fun, but they wanted to know what the test chambers were leaning toward when people were playing it, so they came up with a narrative for it.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:27.000
And basically the game has this very clear beginning, clear middle, clear end with GLaDOS narrating the entire way as you go through it.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:36.000
And then they used the cake just as, you know, part of the developer process and just threw that in there because people like cake. As a joke.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:58.000
So they kept the settings very austere because they wanted to do the puzzles. They wanted there to be able to complete the puzzles without having too much decoration or anything nonfunctional.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:15.000
So they kept it pretty minimalist. I'll be honest, there are certain parts of Portal, even though they're not perfectly cubed out rooms, that kind of make me think of Cube. Have you seen that movie, Rob?

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Oh yes I have. It's been a long time.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:36.000
But you know how in the different rooms in Cube, each of them will have their own little trap or challenge or something? And for the record, Hypercube is my favorite in that trilogy. The third one was shit and the first one was great, but I prefer Hypercube.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:42.000
I hear they remade the first one. They have a Japanese movie now. There's a Japanese version now.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:53.000
I'll have to look for it. I also liked Cube because it had Nicole DeBoer in it who was Esri Dax.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:54:18.000
But anyway, I'm not going to get too much more into a lot of the development of the game. There is actually a walkthrough version with development points that you can hear commentary from the developers.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Basically, the Aperture Science Handheld Portal device, abbreviated as ASHPD, is also a shortening of the name Adrian Shepard, who is the protagonist of Half-Life Opposing Force. So that's kind of funny.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:47.000
And then the Black Forest Cake was chosen based on a Black Forest Cake at Regent Bakery and Cafe in Redmond, Washington as an easter egg in the game.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:55.000
And then the Regent Bakery since then stated that their Black Forest Cake has become their best-selling item.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:08.000
So it has a lot of music and it's very ambient, kind of mysterious, and it really just adds to the technical feel of the game like you're in a lab.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:13.000
And then, of course, Still Alive by Jonathan Colton was sung by Ella McLean.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:27.000
She's classically trained a pratic soprano. I've heard interviews of her doing actual opera, and I think that in the end of Portal 2 that was her singing as well.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:37.000
But you also get sort of up-tempo Latin versions of Still Alive playing over through radios and everything.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:46.000
And so you can get the soundtrack with the Portal 2 soundtrack. It's Portal 2 songs to test by.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:52.000
And you can get that via Steam Music or if you can find it to buy.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:56:02.000
So basically, like I said, it was released with the Orange Box for Windows and Xbox 360 on October 10th, 2007, and a PS3 version on December 11th the same year.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:11.000
You could also just get the Windows version separately through Valve's service theme, and then they had a standalone retail one.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:19.000
In addition to Portal, the Orange Boxes included Half-Life 2, the two add-on episodes, and Team Fortress 2.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:29.000
And basically, no one knew what people were going to think of Portal. It was pretty safe to have it on there, but it was really popular.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:40.000
And then there was a demo version in January 2008 called Portal The First Slice that was free for any Steam user who was using NVIDIA graphics hardware.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:50.000
So it was like a little collaboration. And then there were test chambers 0 to 10, so there were 11 total.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:57:01.000
And then it was also the first Valve game to be added to the OS X compatible list of games on the Steam client for Steam Play.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:11.000
So that was also very good. It was a free play title for Steam users during the first two weeks following the Mac client launch, so there was that.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:19.000
And then Portal Still Alive, I brought that up earlier. It had the original game, 14 new challenges, and different achievements available.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:26.000
And then, you know, don't forget, there's also been some Portal collaborations. Like, what was the Bridge Builder game that had a Portal version?

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Oh, yeah, yeah. Bridge Simulator or something like that.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Yeah, Bridge Simulator or something like that.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Bridge Constructor.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:39.000
And at any rate, the game has been just absolutely adored. It got great ratings.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Metacritic gives it an aggregate score of 90 of 100. It's got 9s out of 10, 9 out of 10, 4.5 out of 5, you know, so it's been really just well received.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:59.000
And it's won many awards. I knew this one was going to be a long segment.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:09.000
It won the Game of the Year award, also Innovation Award and Best Game Design Award at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2008.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Glad I got Most Memorable Villain from GamePro. It's just, it's basically, it won a bunch of awards.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:27.000
And Time Magazine ranked it in 2012 as one of the top 100 video games of all time.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:33.000
And Wired considered it to be one of the most influential games of the first decade of the 21st century.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:42.000
So, stuff. I don't know what happened to my Weighted Companion Cube Fuzzy Dice. I know I had a pair.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:51.000
But there's so much merchandise. Like, I have a Weighted Companion Cube plush somewhere behind me. I have a...

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
We don't have your cam up right now. We're still looking at the game.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Oh, well, I have one. My dice are somewhere. I have Weighted Companion Cube dice.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:08.000
You could get, like, Aperture Science mugs and stickers and all kinds of stuff.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:11.000
But you know what you can't get is Portal 3.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Hey, that's because Valve can't count to three.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000
Then again, Capcom eventually learned how to.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:26.000
But, you know, the cake is a lie has become, like, even people who never played it pretty much know what the cake is a lie is.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:32.000
There's a modding community around Portal that did their own test chambers and modifications.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:37.000
There's a group called We Create Stuff that had an Adobe Flash version of Portal called Portal the Flash version.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:45.000
It came out just before the orange box. And it actually was converted to a map pack for the final game.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:54.000
There is a mod called Portal Prelude that focuses on the pre-GlaDOS era of Aperture Science with crafty and challenging test chambers.

01:59:54.000 --> 02:00:01.000
There's an ASCII portal. There is an unofficial port to the iPhone using Unity, but it only has one room.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:11.000
There's Mario that's with a Zero, which is a fan-made four-player co-op of... mashup of Super Mario Bros. and Portal.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:14.000
It's gonna be a six-hour show tonight if we cover all the mods.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:17.000
I know, I know, I know. I'm just going over some of the major ones.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:24.000
But basically, the original game had Chell just left in that parking lot.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:31.000
But the update had Chell being pulled back in by a party escort bot for the Portal 2 release.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
And you want to know what's great about Portal 2?

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:36.000
It was released on my birthday in 2011.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:40.000
That's right. But you know what they haven't released is Portal 3.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Rob, because Valve can't count to three.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Well, it's just unfortunate.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:55.000
They're gonna have to talk to whoever helped Capcom with their developmental skills to teach them how to count to three.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:05.000
I wanna know. Then we'll get Super Portal 2 Dreams Come True edition for matching service and all that stuff.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
What about Team Fortress 3?

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Alright. I think we've covered all the angles of Portal.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:16.000
The classic game of the week. A real classic.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
I remember when this game first came out.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:22.000
And I think we kind of missed the orange box when it first, first came out.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:25.000
But then we started hearing all the hype about Portal.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:30.000
And we kind of went back and experienced Portal and it's pretty amazing.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
It's a wonderful game.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Alright.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Well, you know what's funny is that I had Becky over one time to play that one scene with the Lemons in Portal 2.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Oh yeah.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:52.000
But it's actually led to one of my favorite songs called the Ambition Song.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:59.000
Where basically it sounds kind of like, oh crap, what's that name?

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Oh, I can't think of his name. The dude that did Uptown Funk?

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:12.000
No. And I'm thinking of Mark Ronson because he's also worked with him.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:17.000
But anyway, he had Bruno Mars. Thank you.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Bruno Mars. It's like I can sing it and I can't name the guy.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.000
He did that Lazy Song. You know, today I don't want to do anything.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:30.000
But they took kind of a mashup of that and the radio version of Still Alive, you know, with the horns and everything.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:35.000
And made a song that's nothing but Cave Johnson ranting, but rhyming.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:40.000
And that song is fantastic. It is one of my favorite things to come out of Portal.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:43.000
And I think, did Pod Culture just link it for us?

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:47.000
So don't listen to it now. Listen to us. But that's the Lemons speech.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
I'll have to find the Ambition Song for everybody later.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:55.000
All right. All right. A longer segment than some runs of the game.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:58.000
But it is one of our all time favorites after all here at Orange Dance Radio.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.000
It's Portal, the classic game of the week.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Good, good, good, good pick. Again, surprised we haven't picked that one before.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:10.000
All right. Let's quickly travel around the world and check out some other quick headlines in rapid fire news.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Loki, we'll start with you.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.000
So For Honor is getting some Shovel Knight content.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Unfortunately, not Shovel Knight himself, but outfits and emotes, which I guess is kind of cool.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Those are going to be available in For Honor until March 4th.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:31.000
It's a limited time thing. So check it out.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:41.000
And then also, the company behind the game Minute is doing a kind of a racer spinoff of it.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:46.000
And it's for charity, which is pretty awesome. So you can check that out.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:53.000
I believe that's on itch.io called Minute Fun Racer.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:57.000
And it looked kind of cool. So 100 percent of the proceeds are going to charity.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Minute's a cool little title.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:04.000
It is. And the game looked pretty fun in the little racer as well. So check it out.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:07.000
All right. Going on to some headlines I have.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:10.000
I honestly thought this game had been canceled at this point, but it hasn't.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:15.000
It's New World, the MMO coming from Amazon Game Studios.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:25.000
This game was originally supposed to be out in May of 2020, and now it's slipped all the way to August 31st, 2021, a closed beta starting on July 20th.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Obviously, a lot went wrong with 2020.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:34.000
So I understand the multiple delays, but I thought the Amazon internal developments were having a lot of problems.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:37.000
But we'll see how the game turns out at the end of the day.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:43.000
So there's YouTube if you want to see a new interview with the game director, Scott Lane.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:47.000
But anyway, I might check that out when the beta starts. Well, it's a closed beta.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Maybe I'll get in it somehow, but I can always check out the full version when that releases in August.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:55.000
Could be interesting.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Jason mentioned this in the intro tonight, but more media coming from more games.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:03.000
This one's a little surprising, though. Dota 2.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Speaking of Valve, and there'll never be a Dota 3, because why would there be? There's a Dota 2.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Defense of the Ancients, of course. Of course, this game is still huge.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:15.000
I mean, you know, so many people everywhere around the world playing this game.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Dota 2 is getting an anime series from Netflix. It's called Dota Dragon's Blood.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:27.000
This is the same studio animating it that did Voltron Legacy Defender, or excuse me, Voltron Legendary Defender.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:32.000
So that's kind of neat. It's an eight episode series, and it's going to come out worldwide on March 25th.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:38.000
So more gaming stuff on Netflix. Not that I think any of us are complaining.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:45.000
There's a game actually that I was really into called Firewatch. It's a really good game.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:52.000
So on the Switch version, there's actually a little hidden secret game on it.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:59.000
And it's only on this one. So for the fifth anniversary of Firewatch,

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Cable Sasser, who was the co-founder of Panic, shared a secret that has a note that was stuck to a random sign in the game.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:15.000
In which if you find it, you get a new location on the map that follows through,

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:21.000
unlocks a game called Forest 64, which is a hidden N64 inspired platformer.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:26.000
And it looks like you play as a little bear, just like running around collecting stuff. It's pretty cute.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:29.000
You actually even get an achievement for it.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:34.000
That's crazy that this was in the game the whole time and nobody ever found it until now.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Only in the Switch version.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Yeah, only in the Switch version, which maybe is why people didn't find it,

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:42.000
because they weren't expecting the Switch to have anything special for it. So who knows?

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:49.000
And it is pretty convoluted the way to find it, but it's always neat to find these little treasures way after the fact.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:59.000
Yeah, and also SNK is working on a Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Switch compilation.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:07.000
So that'll be cool. I mean, we would have, why can't I make words happen?

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:13.000
SNK versus Capcom, match of the millennium. Hopefully we'll get a few other things.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:17.000
I mean, there's also going to be King of Fighters R2 and Samurai Shodown 2.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:26.000
Last Blade Beyond Destiny, Fatal Fury First Contact, which I think I have all of those, I want to say.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:33.000
I know I have King of Fighters R2 and Samurai Shodown 2, and I know I have Last Blade because I fucking love Last Blade.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:39.000
But it'll be really cool to see those and I won't have to dig out my system to play it. So there you go.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:42.000
All right. Lots of good retro stuff there.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:51.000
All right. Let's travel around the world and check out some things that are coming out a little sooner than that Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:55.000
World release dates. Let's start with Loki in the US.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:08:01.000
So we've got Curse of the Dead Gods on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Horned Knight on PlayStation 4, Persona 5 Strikers on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:17.000
Rogue Heroes, Ruins of Tasos, and that's on PC and Nintendo Switch.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:23.000
We Were Here series on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Horn Knight also coming to Xbox One.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:33.000
We've got Cotton Reboot on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Darius Cosmic Revelation on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Forward to the Sky on Nintendo Switch.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:46.000
Ghosts and Goblins Resurrection on Nintendo Switch.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Hellpoint on Nintendo Switch.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Wrath of the Aeon of Ruin.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
We've got that on PC, Mac and Linux.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Yakuza Like a Dragon on PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X, which is weird because I swear to God that was already there and I already have it.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:09.000
But apparently maybe a different version of that's coming out.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Bravely Default 2 on Nintendo Switch.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:17.000
And let's see.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:23.000
And finally, Horned Knight also coming out on PC and Nintendo Switch.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
I like how they staggered out throughout the week.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
And the Yakuza Like a Dragon thing, that's confusing.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Oh, that's for Japan.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:30.000
All right.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Which is weird. You would think they would have already have that.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Well, let's get to the Japanese release dates.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:39.000
Yeah, it's a busy week in Japan this week. There's a lot of stuff coming out.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:42.000
A lot of overlap with some of the things Loki just mentioned.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:45.000
On the Switch, Darius Cosmic Revolution comes out.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
One Step from Eden is also out this week.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Code Realize Wintertide Miracles in a regular and limited edition.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:54.000
The Cotton Reboot in a regular and limited edition.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:57.000
And yes, that's the same Cotton series that Dark Soccer has brought up a lot.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:58.000
So it looks like a new game in the series.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
It's got the X68000 version in it.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Oh, that's pretty cool.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
That makes me so freaking happy.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
I love Cotton.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.000
You might have to pick that up.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:07.000
All right.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:08.000
No, it's on my list to pick up.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:12.000
If you're going to buy a physical copy, though, it's through Strictly Limited Games.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Got it.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Also on the Switch, Forward to the Sky in a regular and limited edition.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:19.000
The Legend of Heroes.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Story of Seasons, Pioneers of Olive Town.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:26.000
And Kineiro Lovereach comes out.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
And Jinky Resurrection.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
That is just the Switch.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Going to the PlayStation 5.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:36.000
Nothing this week in Japan, so it's a quiet week on the PlayStation 5.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:39.000
Let me check the PlayStation 4, though.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Yeah, a lot of overlap there.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
The Cotton Reboot is out on PS4.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Darius Cosmic Revelation.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:48.000
There's a Kemco RPG selection, Volume 6.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.000
So yet another bundled collection of old RPGs in Kemco.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:11:00.000
This includes Dragon Lapis, Lost Dragon, Alfadia Genesis, and Azdivine Kamura are all in that collection.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:03.000
We don't get any of those over here, I don't think.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:06.000
And then Jinky Resurrection.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.000
Kineiro Lovereach is out as well.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Empire of Sin.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Yeah, busy week in Japan.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Lots of releases.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
How about the UK, Dark Soccer?

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:17.000
A few things.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:20.000
On the 23rd, we have Persona 5 Strikers.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:24.000
We have Werewolf the Apocalypse, Earthblood.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:28.000
On the 25th, we have On the Road Truck Simulator.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
The Catch, Carp, and Course.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:33.000
On the 26th, Vetronom.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:34.000
That's on Switch.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Evoland, a Legendary Edition.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Aeternium X.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Dex, made of Scar, S-K-E-R.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Bravely Default 2.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Hellpoint Theme Park Simulator.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:52.000
Balbabs Mausoleum, and Do Not Feed the Monkeys.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Alright.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Let's move on, and we will get a few more headlines for you guys before we get to the listener roundtable and the mailbag, which I think we have one extremely short email tonight.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:10.000
We'll see, though. I'll have Dark Soccer check that out.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:11.000
Alright, meanwhile.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
Loki, what do you have for us?

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:23.000
So apparently, the Grand Theft Auto 3 and Grand Theft Auto Vice City games have had their source code revealed, or just say reverse engineered.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:29.000
So there's been a team that's been working on that for quite a while, and they finally have taken care of that.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:36.000
With that now, they've been able to port the games to several different platforms, including the Nintendo Switch.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:43.000
Also, the Vita and Wii U, and so basically running those natively instead of via emulation.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Also, it's been ported to the PC, and then they're working on getting ported the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Along with that, though, of course, in typical fashion, Take-Two has filed a DMCA takedown notice to GitHub to remove the reverse engineered games.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:11.000
I thought reverse engineering was legal, but they did the same thing with Mario 64 as well.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:17.000
But it's already on the internet, so it's always on the internet. It'll never go away. It's too late.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:27.000
That's pretty scary, though, that these games get their source code reverse engineered. What are they going to do next?

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:38.000
I don't know, but it's interesting to see what they've been able to do with this.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:46.000
I'm curious to see what kind of upgrades we're going to get with these, because I know with Mario 64, people have added ray tracing into it, and all sorts of craziness.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:49.000
It'll be interesting to see what they do with this.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:58.000
One game that just doesn't stop getting updated is No Man's Sky. Of course, this is a game I've talked fondly about on this show before.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:04.000
It's a game I've really enjoyed, especially because they've really transformed it from what it was when it originally released.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Now they've put out yet another update, and this update is all about companions.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:19.000
Now you can befriend the little alien creatures on the planet. Before, you could at least feed them and ride them around on the planet a little bit.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Now you can go even further. The alien creatures that you meet, you can actually turn them into companions that will join you, I believe, off the planet as well.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:36.000
You don't just screenshot them and go to the next planet. You actually have them accompany you.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:47.000
You can train them to aid in exploration. You can have them find specific resources, provide light, find settlements, or even hunt some of the dangerous creatures.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:55.000
They can basically be your bitch in fighting some of the dangerous creatures on the planet, so it's a lot of stuff.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:02.000
That just all came out for No Man's Sky, and like all the other updates, it's been free. Just another patch for the game.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:11.000
So, yet more to explore. Another reason for me to start from scratch. Can't wait. Alright. Moving on, DarkSakura.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Well, Bungie got themselves in some hot water for Destiny 2 Beyond Light's Season of the Chosen.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:38.000
They had a phrase being used in it that actually goes back to a slogan used in Nazi Germany, which I'll go ahead and say what it is, blood and honor.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:52.000
And they thought it would work for the game, and a lot of people were really, really put off by it.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:16:00.000
So, yeah, they apologized for it. They immediately did that and removed it from the game.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Serious question. Don't the orcs in Warcraft say something like that too? I thought they did. I could be wrong.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:16.000
And I think there was something that this was in tandem with in Destiny 2 where the optics were really not good.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:20.000
It was on a completion banner.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:32.000
Yeah, and it had to do with something else called the cleansing, where the optics of that was really, I mean, I'm sure they just made a horrible mistake.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:36.000
But, yeah, that's just, yeah.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:48.000
As SjoernerMatt says, someone didn't do their homework when they came up with it. At least they fixed it and didn't try to be all like, well, it wasn't what, you know, they just, it was pointed out.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:17:01.000
It was fixed. Yeah, no, I don't, I really don't think it was done on purpose, but I think that people still need to be better educated on history in general.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:11.000
So that's a good point. If they didn't know anything about, they did this because they were ignorant to the situation and education would have helped prevent that.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:20.000
True, true, very true. All right, let's move on just a couple more stories before we get to the roundtable. But first, a story from Loki.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Yeah, I don't know why I didn't think of this myself, but apparently there's a developer that's out there that tried to put out some games on Steam, one of these being Emoji Evolution.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:46.000
And they decided to name their company on Steam as Very Positive. So, you know, the developer name happens to appear right above the review scores.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:58.000
And so you may see Very Positive and think, oh, Very Positive Reviews. But no, that's not the case. It's just that's the name of the actual, the company is Very Positive.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:06.000
And Valve was not too keen about them trying to be tricky like that. And so they banned them off Steam.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Did they prove that it was, I'm kind of team Very Positive on this. Like this is Valve's, why does it, why is it so easy to just put a name there? It's that's kind of Valve's bad design.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:34.000
Like, yeah, I'm not sure I am totally with the whole like, yeah, get them off of Steam. They exploited it. Maybe they wanted to name their company Very Positive Games. What's wrong with that? That's Steam's fault.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:44.000
Yeah. And according to the developer, they said Valve fully understands how minor this trick is. It's more important to have a famous brand name like Obsidian there.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:56.000
They didn't think that there was actually going to be an issue with naming it that, but they said that they banned them due to review manipulations was the reasoning.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:06.000
So, yeah, I don't know. I mean, it's just interesting.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:16.000
It's like how when my siblings were doing video reports for school, they ended with, this has been an A plus production. Perfect.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:32.000
And ironically, ironically, though, like, so very, it's very positive, you know, this emoji evolution game, you know, even though I was kind of dogging on it, has mostly positive reviews, which is kind of funny.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:46.000
But I don't know, apparently they thought is, you know, it got pointed out. So, you know, maybe they could change it to Mostly Positive Games or something like that instead of just very positive as the name of the studio.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:20:01.000
Seriously, very positive. I don't know. Anyway. All right. Well, something I'm not sure I'm meeting with positive thoughts is this news that Fortnite is now getting more characters, this time from Street Fighter.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:05.000
That's right. Favorites Ryu.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:06.000
My heart's broken.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:07.000
Favorites Ryu.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Skins.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:24.000
And Chun-Li are joining the Fortnite item shop so that you can dress your character like Chun-Li or Ryu. You know, since Chun-Li isn't going to be in Mortal Kombat at all, which by the way, I'll just quickly say on that article, that website knew exactly what it was doing.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:37.000
And every time you share that article, you're buying into it. That's all I'm going to say. There's, and I'm not saying that makes it right. That's just some of the like garbage stuff that makes the internet so broken right now.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:48.000
But I must say that website knows exactly what was doing that story. That was that was not somebody. If you actually kind of go through and read the article, there's coded little gags in it where they actually talk about.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:21:00.000
It's the biggest street fighting championship when they're talking about Mortal Kombat. Like there's there's all sorts of code in it where they knew damn well what they were doing by getting gamers to rage retweet that.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:12.000
So stop and think about that a little bit next time again. And I'm not perfect with this. I have to remind myself, there's been articles I've retweeted that I probably shouldn't have. But I let things like this be a little bit of a lesson.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Anyway, sorry, I had to do that quick aside because it of course, the doc of Chun Li doesn't just bring to mind a great Nicki Minaj song, but it also brings to mind this article that was out there last week.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Anyhow, Chun Li in all her glory and Ryu will be coming to Fortnite. And yeah, I mean, it's not the first time we've had gamer characters from other games in Fortnite. Kratos, of course, and Master Chief, both already in Fortnite when the PS5 got their version and the Xbox Series X got their version.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
And so on. So.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
And that's not all, right?

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
Oh, did I miss something?

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:49.000
Yes.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Go ahead.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:51.000
So you know what else is coming to Fortnite?

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Oh, no.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:53.000
This might get your attention a little bit more.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
Yeah, I heard. Okay. Yeah, go ahead.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Tron outfits.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Yeah. That was that was in last week's news. I thought I had mentioned at some point. But yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Tron is coming as well. And I just kind of let out this big sigh.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:11.000
I think the sigh that Dark Soccer just put out, I've kind of matched that with the Tron news.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Yeah.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:17.000
All right. Whatever. It's what the kids are into. You know what?

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:28.000
You know what? I'm going to I'm going to just suck it up and take the high road if it gets one more kid out there to want to watch the Tron movies.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:34.000
And I would say really the old one. But you know what? The new one's great, too. The newer one is great, too. The one from 2010, Tron legacy.

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:41.000
If it gets more kids to watch those movies, you know what? Okay. Okay. I'll accept it.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:47.000
So. All right. S2100 Matt says apparently Peter Griffin is coming as well. Is it for real?

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:48.000
No one cares.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:51.000
That would be hilarious.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
Fortnite is a very interesting pop culture blender.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
I would totally watch that.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:59.000
I want Beavis and Butthead at this point. Why not put parody and parody?

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:02.000
All right. Yes, absolutely.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:07.000
All right. That is it for the news that we have scheduled. How about the roundtable?

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:13.000
I'd like to open it up to our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network for any questions that they might have.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:19.000
But also open it up to our email every week. We invite your emails at participate at orange lounge radio dot com.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:23.000
And we'd like to read our favorites here on the air. How many do we have tonight?

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:28.000
Dark soccer one. It's it's and it's it's you read it in one breath, but that's okay.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:31.000
I actually actually I love the question. So let's get to it.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:35.000
Well, it's one that's definitely going to send me on a journey.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:41.000
I'm excited. So what is the best video game font? And this comes from D.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:46.000
You forgot where D is from Waterloo. I was defeated.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:49.000
You won the war. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:54.000
I have to. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not sorry, but I'm sorry. All right.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:59.000
So, OK, D, I actually I actually legit love this question, though.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:03.000
And dark soccer, you are the one who, you know, went to school for this.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:07.000
So, of course, I'm going to start with you. What is the best video game font or what?

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:11.000
I'm sorry. What what video game has the best font? I think was the question.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Well, see, this is still loaded question because a lot of video games will use multiple typefaces.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:20.000
There's title faces. There's in-game dialog faces. There's all kinds of things.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Now, one of my favorite dialog faces is called Humming.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:31.000
And it is the typeface that has been used in the Animal Crossing series.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:37.000
I think since Wild World, I want to say. And I actually have this fun.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:43.000
I mean, it's a legit, you know, real typeface. And it's it's really beautiful to type with, really beautiful to lay out with.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:50.000
I really enjoy that one. The title font that they use is.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:57.000
It's very similar or maybe a modification of one called Think Heavy, F-I-N-K,

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:04.000
and just has a lot of personality, but Think Heavy is a true type font.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Still, they're charging for it. So as far as other ones, like for titles,

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:21.000
some of them are just like so fucking generic, you know, like I like the the PlayStation font,

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:27.000
but there are some games that will do like the movie thing and try to go with like Trajan,

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:34.000
which is on like the cover of almost every I'd say movie from before five years ago,

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:39.000
I would say there's actually a video on YouTube called Trajan is the movie font.

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:45.000
But I like when they go with something that isn't too generic, like I like a Helvetica,

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:48.000
but I like when they do something that's got a little bit more personality to it.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:55.000
You know, that's why I've always really liked the the the humming font for Animal Crossing.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:59.000
I just always have thought it was a really enjoyable font to use.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:04.000
So this is to say, you know, whenever you bring up fonts, somebody is going to make a joke.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:07.000
And Phoenix 7726, of course, says Comic Sans.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:10.000
But let me ask this question. I ignored it on purpose.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:15.000
Has any video game actually tried to use Comic Sans or Papyrus?

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
Not to my knowledge, at least.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Well, I'm sure indie games have, but like published games, I don't think they have.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
I don't know. Off the top of my head.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Oh, Pixelbook says The Sims used Comic Sans and Undertale had a character named Sans and Papyrus.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:38.000
But Capcom's font is ITC Corinna, K-O-R-I-N-N-A.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:41.000
I've always liked Fares.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:52.000
There's also Eurostyle, which is one that the VOG font is based out of, was used in a few different games, too.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:59.000
There's also the Mega Drive font that Sega used was Corporate IMG.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:04.000
I was just saying, because you're getting into where my answer to this question would go,

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:10.000
is like, I don't necessarily think of just one game, but there's something about, especially in the classic 8-bit era,

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:14.000
there were a lot of games that shared fonts, usually from the same company.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:17.000
For example, you play Konami games back in the day.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Whether it was Simon's Quest, whether it was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, whether it was Metal Gear,

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:25.000
they all used like the same font.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Capcom games all shared the same font in the 8-bit era, and I think Tecmo had a very unique font

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:37.000
that was very representative of, like, you're playing a Tecmo game when you see this.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:45.000
There's one in particular, though, that's been used by many games, both Japanese and English, called Cartoon 12.

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Cartoon 12 is a bitmap font that was designed by Steve Capps, his Apple programmer,

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:56.000
first used in the Mac game through the Looking Glass in 1984.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:00.000
It was never officially released. There were shareware versions of it,

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:08.000
and then there was a version in DOS Deluxe Paint 2 by EA, where it was just called Comix, C-O-M-I-X,

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:12.000
and it's been used in, actually it was used in Mortal Kombat.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:19.000
It was used in Puyo Puyo, I think Puyo Puyo Pocket.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:26.000
I'm just trying to think of a few other games, I mean a bunch of games fucking used it.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:36.000
I'm trying to think of, yeah, actually I think that the handheld versions of Samurai Shodown used it, I think.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Some of the Disney games used it.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:51.000
The Qbert logo was done in Cooper Black, which Cooper's like the font that they would always use on the back of team jerseys,

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:54.000
like the FamA team jerseys.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:59.000
The Othello font was used for the Famicom Disk System.

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:06.000
I'm trying to think what else, I mean there's like a few regular fonts that you'd see in the last stuff,

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:13.000
like Coleco used Optima for their video game system.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:19.000
Optima is another one that I love using, but it's kind of an expensive one if you're just going to go flat out and buy it.

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:28.000
Overwatch used Futura in some of their text on there, which is a font that I lay out stuff in all the time.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Obviously, again, Darcyra, I knew you would have a lot to say on this question because there's a lot of different,

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:39.000
you've kind of really studied a lot of this stuff, but I actually want to check in with Loki real quick on this question,

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:45.000
see if you have an answer, but I want to ask a second part for you, Loki, because we're talking about all these companies that have used stuff.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:53.000
Well, now you get to speak from the perspective of Game Designer, and I'm curious, how did you choose the look for Pixel Poops number two?

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:59.000
And because obviously you do have things like in the interface, you know, in a certain font, how did you pick that?

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:05.000
So two-parter, do you have any, you know, again for the emailer, do you have any favorite fonts yourself?

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:08.000
But how did you pick what you would go with for Pixel Poops 2, Loki?

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:13.000
I just was looking at arcade fonts and I made something kind of similar to that.

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:22.000
As far as, yeah, there wasn't really much choice because it's an 8x8 font, so you're kind of limited to what you can do with 8x8.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:23.000
True.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:31.000
I'd say my favorite one is probably, I don't know what the actual font name is called, but it's Pricedown.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:36.000
It's the Grand Theft Auto logo or the Price is Right logo.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
Oh, okay.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Yeah, that'd be my favorite.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:44.000
I never, it never really clicked for me that those two things use the same font, but you're right.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:47.000
The Price is Right and Grand Theft Auto are like in the same font.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:48.000
Yeah.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:49.000
It's funny.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:50.000
Okay.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Sorry, Dark Soccer, but I had to get, I had to get that perspective too.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:31:01.000
But any, any other little information nuggets for our emailer?

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:15.000
I'm still a big fan of Carina, but that one also has a lot of history for it because the, the original type version was invented in 1904 and Capcom has been using it for some time.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Ooh, I know what's iconic and I don't know what the font is, but it's iconic is the font that Activision used on all of their Atari 2600 games, not the games themselves, but the box art.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:31.000
The box art all had the title in this very bold font.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:39.000
The cartridge labels were all in the same font and like in a very, like it was like always like white text on a very colorful background.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:44.000
So if you had them all like stacked up on the shelves, like you knew these are the Activision games because they all look similar.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:51.000
I mean, the Atari games had a font too, but they didn't look as good cause they always put like dark on dark, but the Activision stuff really stood out.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Um, it was, there's was a custom font, um, but it was modified from another one and for the life of me, I can't remember what it was.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:01.000
That's okay.

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:12.000
We've given this emailer like way so much information, but I'd like, I knew this, it would spark this kind of discussion and like, I'm like, dang, that is a question no one's asked in 857 episodes.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:13.000
So it's good job.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
Like that's a really good question.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:16.000
Oh yeah.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
But no, there, that was a pretty classic one.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:21.000
Gosh, I wish I could, I know people have done versions of it.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:22.000
Yeah.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Um, probably at dafont or something.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:25.000
Yeah.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:26.000
Yeah.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:27.000
But, um, but yeah.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:28.000
All right.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:29.000
All right.

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:30.000
Well, okay.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:41.000
So for the record there, I just found a page called the game font database and it got apparently a lot of, uh, fonts used by different companies.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:42.000
That's cool.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:43.000
I'll link it in chat.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:44.000
Nice.

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:45.000
All right.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Well, thanks for the email.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:50.000
And if you can think of a good question, we haven't been asked in 857 episodes or you know what?

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:51.000
It's fine.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:54.000
If you ask one that we got asked a hundred episodes ago, we probably won't remember.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Uh, send us an email, participate at, uh, orange lounge, radio.com and Phoenix 77 26 says dark soccer is a fountain of knowledge, but I'm bump.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:09.000
You know what?

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:10.000
What?

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
I'm a typography nerd.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
I like big fonts and I cannot lie.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:15.000
All right.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:19.000
Uh, but an ultra light's okay too.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:20.000
Uh, all right.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:26.000
Um, as the show and her mat says, how do you type with boxing gloves on your hands?

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
Very difficult, very difficultly.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:31.000
You don't, uh, or with a very big keyboard.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
It's a strong, bad thing.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:36.000
Oh, that was a strong, bad thing.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:37.000
Totally missed the reference.

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Yeah.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:40.000
All right.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:44.000
Um, I think that is probably about it for everyone that we know.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:49.000
We don't have any other emails and outside of that question, that was just a strong bag joke in disguise.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
I didn't see any others pop up in chat.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:52.000
You have a couple other minutes.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:34:00.000
So if you have something you want to get out there, cause I will ask Loki if there are and dark soccer, if there's any other last minute stories they want to get into for tonight.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:01.000
Not me.

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:02.000
Um, sure.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:16.000
So apparently like, like a Phoenix rising from the ashes, uh, soldier boy has posted yet another game console concept on his Instagram.

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:21.000
I can only assume it's another Chinese clone console because it looks like a Chinese clone console.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:25.000
So I guess we'll just have to wait and see until someone recognizes it.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:32.000
But he claims it's a building, a brand new console from scratch, all new design, all new games, all new deals.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:36.000
Let's make history girls like all the other ones.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:37.000
Girls stop.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:38.000
That's all I have to say about that ever happened.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:39.000
Girls stop.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:42.000
So yay.

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
Something to look forward to.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:47.000
Um, Bobby Black Wolf is bringing up in chat by the way.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
Did y'all cover that in television?

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:52.000
Amico got delayed from April to October.

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
It probably didn't hit any news sites.

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:59.000
Now from, well, I got the email cause I, I, I pre-ordered, bought, prepaid, whatever.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Uh, one of those, uh, now from April 3rd, 2021 or four, three, two, one, two, 10, 10, 21.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:07.000
Yeah. Um, thanks for bringing it up.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:08.000
You're right.

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:15.000
It didn't, it didn't make the show roll because honestly they just delayed it and that YouTube they put out was a lot.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Um, they didn't really show any games.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:25.000
Um, I, I still think there's a market for the Amico and I think there's a lot of people dunking on it that, um, probably don't need to be.

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:34.000
Um, and I think there could be some really good stuff that I think a lot of, and I've told Aaron, he should look into or why we are, he should look into developing for Amico.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:43.000
I don't know if anything ever came of that, but, um, and I don't know how kindly they would take to pixel poops, but obviously he's made other games like super multitasking and that stuff that would be great for it.

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:52.000
But that aside, I mean, and I would encourage not just, you know, why we are, but maybe other indie developers who are having a problem, maybe getting noticed on the steam marketplace.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:36:02.000
Um, you know, say what you will about Amico and Intellivision, but you know, having a personality like Tommy Tallarico behind it knows how to kind of talk up and hype up the product.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:06.000
So it could be, it could be a chance to, you know, get things seen.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Um, obviously the delay is disappointing, but I also kind of start to wonder because we've been seeing a lot of the same games and the footage for those.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:26.000
I almost wonder if they had released 10, 10, 20, would they have had the games coming out to really carry them through the next year?

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:33.000
Maybe this is going to better position themselves, but I know, especially for being such a small company, the pandemic's probably hit them pretty hard in the development.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:46.000
And of course, you know, obviously they're, they're having problems making PlayStation fives and series X's with all these chips, obviously, you know, it's not all the same chips, obviously, but they're going to have problems supply when it comes to the Amico.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:57.000
So like, I get the delay from that perspective. I'm not an angry customer or anything. The pandemic has fucked everything and everyone. Like it's just, you know, things are going to get delayed.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:16.000
I just hope it positions in television for longer success and the long game and a stream of newer games that come out because without it, that thing is going to, you know, it's, it's not going to do well if they don't continuously have new games to put out there and talk about in the news and all that stuff.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:28.000
So, all right. Anyway, Bobby does say they've been showing new games every week on their YouTube channel. The only ones I've seen that ended up catching my eye break out, I've seen like three different times now.

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:37.000
And then there was that platformer game that was a revival of an old title where the whole trick was you flipped it from night to day and stuff.

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:48.000
I can't remember the name, but it looked cute, but it did look like a mobile phone game on your TV a little bit, but I don't know if that's necessarily a bad thing.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:59.000
I know that sounds very sacrilegious, but one game we all never shut up about is Pokemon Go. That's a mobile phone game. Now, I wouldn't want to play that on my TV, but they make decent games.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:08.000
They make decent games for the phone. Like that Sayonara Wild Hearts was started as a phone game and ended up on Switch and all this other stuff. So we'll see. We'll see.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:11.000
Anyway, sorry. Go ahead, Loki.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:24.000
No, I was going to say, I, while, yeah, that looks, it's all about the art style. Like, I don't know, I, the motion graphics stuff that they kind of do nowadays, you know, with kind of tweaking sprites.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:33.000
Like I know the style that it looks, it's very much like a mobile game, especially when you're talking about advertisement stuff. It's all about really the gameplay though on those.

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:50.000
Um, and I haven't really seen a whole lot yet. They get me super excited about the, um, the new console, but yeah, I'd be curious to see how to develop for it, but I don't know whenever it would happen, if it would ever happen.

02:38:51.000 --> 02:39:01.000
All right. Well, let's note the date and time. Loki said he's curious about developing for Amico. All right. Anyhow, any other last minute stories?

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:03.000
No, that's it.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:17.000
All right. Then I think it is about time we end the show, but not before I thank all of you for tuning in tonight. Thank you for, uh, tuning into Orange Lounge Radio, whether you were here live at twitch.tv slash vog network, or you were listening on our podcast feed.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:30.000
We appreciate you guys being here with us every week. Um, we, you don't have to give us money for, uh, I mean, but if you want to three via bits and subs or shopping in our shop over at vog network.com slash shop and buying some merch.

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:39.000
We would suit. We're not going to say no to that. We'd appreciate it, but all we really want is, uh, tell a friend or two about the show, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:50.000
But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, then what, what can we do? Um, speaking of shopping, kind of, I should give a shout out here for, um, the, on, on the Twitch channel.

02:39:50.000 --> 02:40:03.000
Uh, when there's a stream going on, you can actually donate, uh, the vog points or the points on Twitch. You can actually donate right now to Bobby is trying to put on a VHS gaming tape stream.

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:18.000
So he found like a bunch of old tapes from the nineties. Um, and if we can get a hundred thousand points raised, which is, is, is not as hard as you think, um, he's gonna, uh, put those, uh, an air, some of the content from like old and stuff.

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:30.000
We're already up to 74 K. So, um, we're looking good. Um, if you click on the little icon that has the points, it looks like a little bubble, I guess next to the, you click on it.

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:41.000
And then like the very first option will say the gaming tape stream 23 days left, and then you can donate a, however many points you want a maximum of 200 points. So, Oh, you figured it out.

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:53.000
You figured it out. Loki now we're at 76,000. There you go. So, all right. Um, so hopefully look forward to that stream soon. So, and we're trying to come up with other ways that you guys can spend your points.

02:40:53.000 --> 02:41:03.000
Uh, so stay tuned for all that good stuff as well. So, all right. Um, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts and I will go to dark Sakura for your final thought first.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:10.000
Um, I am in one of those moods where I want to watch mid Samara again and drink.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:13.000
That movie is great.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:17.000
My, oh, go ahead. Loki. I'll have you go next.

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:35.000
Um, my final thought is I'm, I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do next. So I have a few ideas, but I may, I may actually just go back to working on a pixel poops number two and to get ready for the console version or the cartridge version of that.

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:50.000
All right. And my final thought, um, my mom's 80th birthday would have been this upcoming Tuesday. So obviously she's on my mind a lot this last week and honest, not just this last week but always, especially ever since she passed.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:42:02.000
But just wanted to acknowledge that and just dedicate the work that I'm doing here on OLR tonight and pretty much every night to her memory. So that's it.

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:17.000
Um, I hope that doesn't end it on a downer though. It's not a downer. I'm actually trying to look at that as a very positive thing. So I hope you guys all have an amazing week and, uh, place a lot of games, um, and have a lot of fun online and, uh, don't go crazy though.

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:27.000
Okay. Cause those are real people that you're playing against and we'll see you in seven days to talk when it will be March again, but for real this time and we can talk all of, Oh no, I'm sorry.

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Actually, I'm sorry. We have one more show because it'd be the 28th. So in two weeks we'd be in March. So next week we'll still be in February and we can think about how March is coming so quickly again, but this time in 2021.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:42.000
Have a wonderful week, everybody. We'll see you in seven days. Good night.
