00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,720
Last week's article about the rumored shuttering of Konami's games division, called a re-shuffle,

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,080
was an interesting one, especially in the face of their ongoing Pockyslot and Bimani

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,080
series.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,320
And pro-evolution soccer staying power, I suppose.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,280
Calling all keyboard enthusiasts, get those MIDI keyboards out of storage and play nostalgia,

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,880
if you live in Japan or otherwise know what you're doing.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,320
This has been your Bimani News Update for February 2021.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,440
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to bring you more

9
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,160
on this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,160
every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:44,720
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,840
every gamer has a voice.

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,560
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and Bimani updates are always welcome here, just for the record,

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,860
because that is of course where the show has its roots.

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,820
Where myself, Dark Sakura, and Loki got our start playing Dance Dance Revolution at the

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,700
local arcade many many years ago, about 20 years ago at this point.

17
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,700
Anyway, hi.

18
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,540
Welcome, I'm Rob Roberts and it's episode number 855 of our show for this February the

19
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,580
7th of 2021.

20
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,820
Not joining me tonight unfortunately, Dark Sakura or Jamie Sommers, she has the night

21
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,700
off, she was feeling a little bit under the weather, so she'll be in a pre-recorded segment

22
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,500
a little later on, but we will not be hearing from her live sadly.

23
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,380
But she'll be here with us next week.

24
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,100
But who is joining us live tonight is our good old pal Loki, who I think has been having

25
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,340
a very busy week.

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,340
Hi Loki.

27
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,220
Yeah, it's been busy.

28
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,600
I keep seeing your Twitter, and you're like, I'm giving myself crunch day, I'm taking a

29
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,260
day off of work to work on Friday.

30
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:53,500
And I did, and Saturday, and pretty much mostly today.

31
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:59,980
Wow, so yeah, and I didn't realize until kind of the middle of the week that you and Aaron

32
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:06,780
or YYR were really committed to the February 10th release date for Pixel Poops, which we've

33
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,500
been hyping up for the last few weeks on this show.

34
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,020
For whatever reason, this is your first Orange Lounge radio.

35
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,740
This long running gag here on the show are these dream games, like we'll throw out this

36
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,740
crazy idea and be like, that should be a game.

37
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:26,140
And well, one of them became a game on the PlayStation Vita, it's called Pixel Poops.

38
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,980
And yes, you go to the little taco stand and eat tacos, and then you stop joggers from

39
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,940
running through the park by, well, it's in the title.

40
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:42,820
So this game came out on the Vita, why Aaron or YYR did it, obviously can't get it anymore,

41
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,460
because they kind of closed that part of the Vita shop down.

42
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:53,980
He's now re-realizing Pixel Poops through a Steam release, which is coming out in just

43
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,580
a few days, like three more days.

44
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,420
So by the time some of you hear this, it will already be out.

45
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,780
But he didn't just decide to release Pixel Poops, oh no, he decided he was going to do

46
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:09,060
a Commodore 64 version of the game as well, as well as releasing sound samples, souping

47
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,680
up the game with some extra modes that are very reminiscent of like the game switch on

48
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,100
an Atari 2600.

49
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:20,780
As silly as the idea sounds, and as much as when I say Pixel Poops, and you probably go,

50
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,260
that sounds stupid, yeah, but it's fun.

51
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,300
Like a lot of old videos, like, have you ever looked at Atari 2600 box art?

52
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,940
It's pretty stupid.

53
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,940
And I mean that with love.

54
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,660
A lot of the games are like weird, like, I mean, look at the premise of like, it's Pac-Man,

55
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,660
you're a thing that eats dots and getting chased by ghosts for some reason, it's like,

56
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,660
what's the story there?

57
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,780
I don't know, there is no story.

58
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,780
Exactly.

59
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:50,460
So not only has Aaron got all this going on and takes all this on, but then Loki's like,

60
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,320
you know what, I want to sign up for Punishment 2, I'm going to do an NES version of Pixel

61
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,320
Poops.

62
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,380
And you know what, I guess we'll just release it all on the same day, because it's going

63
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,440
to be free on Steam, so Pixel Poops, the base game is free on Steam, so you can go check

64
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,380
that out, because you can actually, I think you can play it on Aaron's website anyway,

65
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,860
I think it's been there the whole time, so you can play it for free there, and you can

66
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,140
play it for free on Steam, but then there's going to be like DLC that's going to cost

67
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,140
$2.99?

68
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,140
$1.99?

69
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,140
$2.99?

70
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,140
$1.99?

71
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,660
It's going to cost less than a fucking latte, okay?

72
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,100
It's going to be cheap, and you can go buy it, and that's going to give you the Commodore

73
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:35,120
64 version, the soundtrack, and, or I shouldn't say soundtrack, but the authentic sample pack

74
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,020
and all that stuff, and Loki's game, Pixel Poops number 2, which, he's crunching this

75
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,620
weekend because he hasn't finished.

76
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,260
So Pixel Poops number 2 will be a separate piece of DLC.

77
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,300
Oh, okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

78
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,980
It's not included in the $5.

79
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,980
Oh, my bad.

80
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,340
So that is separate.

81
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,380
Still, still, it's like $5, that's nothing.

82
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:02,180
Yeah, I think for my game, I was going to charge right now, like, I was going to do

83
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,880
$8, but I mean, we've got like 32 levels in it, well, it's going to have like at least

84
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:16,600
40 levels, and it's pretty hard, and I've redone a lot of the, I'm still drawing stuff

85
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:23,560
for it right now, so there's a lot of content in there, because I wanted it to be on par

86
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,480
with, like, I was looking at, like, okay, what are some of these other puzzle action

87
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:33,280
games, how many levels do they have, oh, 50, okay, we'll see if we can get up to 50, but

88
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:40,080
it's probably going to be 40, because I have five worlds, and each one has eight levels,

89
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,520
so it's probably going to be there, unless I decide to cram in a few more levels, which

90
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,640
I still could.

91
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:51,080
I just love that you're releasing a game on, what, Wednesday, and it's still not done.

92
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:57,640
Well, technically, it doesn't need to be done, even when it comes to Wednesday, because we

93
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:03,200
do live in that modern age where we can catch stuff, but like, yeah, it'll be done by then.

94
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,160
So, and going to our chat room, because of course, we do tape live every Sunday night

95
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,080
at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock

96
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,160
Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, and Fifth Dream is asking, any news

97
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,360
on the physical, because do what?

98
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,280
Well, I'm going to help answer that.

99
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,640
First, Loki needs to finish the game, then he can worry about the physical version.

100
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,240
Yeah, so the physical version will be coming at some point, so like, what I want to do

101
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,040
with that, I may end up doing, because like I said, there's a lot of stuff I wanted to

102
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,360
do, but time, you know, may not be necessarily on my side to do all the things I want to

103
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
do.

104
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:48,880
So what we may end up doing is like releasing a finished version of the game on Wednesday,

105
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,460
and then coming back to do like a special edition that will be the physical version

106
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,080
and will be a free upgrade to the DLC, whatever.

107
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,160
So that may be what I end up doing, because I still want to see if there's, I've got a

108
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,040
lot of space in different, because the way it's banked in there, the way the memories

109
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,200
split up, I have a lot of space in there, and I want to cram more music and stuff like

110
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,600
that in there and more levels as well.

111
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,000
And my kids keep asking me for like boss fights and stuff.

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,720
So I had some silly ideas regarding that.

113
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:26,160
So I want to cram all that stuff in there as well, if possible, to really like maximize

114
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
everything.

115
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,400
And then the next day, you know, we'll just, you know, charge the $8 initially.

116
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,800
And then if we bump it, the special edition will be $10 total.

117
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,080
So if you bought in at the $8 version, then you get the special edition for free type

118
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
thing.

119
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
Yeah.

120
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,360
So that's, that's the initial idea I have.

121
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
We'll see.

122
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,560
I mean, we may just leave it at eight bucks and call it a day.

123
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
Well, I do like this.

124
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,720
SSJ 100 Matt in chat says, Loki already more transparent than CD Projekt Red about the

125
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
process.

126
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
No.

127
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
Yes.

128
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
Yes.

129
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
I understand.

130
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
It's called scope creep.

131
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,600
I am very familiar with scope creep and that, that is, that is the whole reason I did it

132
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,880
on the NES because I can't implement a lot of the stuff I would like to implement on

133
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,160
it because it just, it just physically can't be done because it's, you know, limited in

134
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,000
space and, um, what the engine can handle and stuff like that.

135
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,680
So that was on purpose because, and it worked because I've finished, I'm about to finish

136
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
something.

137
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,600
So, uh, that was the intent, but we'll see.

138
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Yeah.

139
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,560
So I was looking in chat and there was a little bit of discussion about the price and, you

140
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,000
know, uh, set it at 10 bucks and then just have it go on sale a lot cause you know, sales,

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,960
you know, and honestly, like I was going to say, I think when I was on YYR site this week,

142
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,880
uh, he actually said that the price of a couple of his games are going to go up this month.

143
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,760
And honestly, my reaction was good.

144
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
You deserve it.

145
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,720
Like you guys, well, YYR specifically in this case deserves a bigger cut.

146
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,020
Like these games are great and it's unfortunate, unfortunate that, you know, there's just so

147
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,600
many games on steam that you have to have that viral moment to really get discovered

148
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
sometimes.

149
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,720
I may end up doing 10 bucks.

150
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,520
I remember having 99 or whatever I was, cause I was looking at like other games, like, Oh,

151
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,960
my game, it doesn't, it's not as good as that.

152
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
You know?

153
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,620
So I was like, eh, no people are going to pay $10 for this.

154
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,260
So I may just end up doing 10 bucks and then we'll just do the free upgrade later.

155
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,700
Um, we'll see.

156
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,960
I don't know, but you need to go on other podcasts to promote, by the way, you, you

157
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,620
should be booking a bunch of podcasts this month.

158
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,820
Well, I don't, yeah, I don't have time yet to advertise and that's probably a big mistake,

159
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:41,080
but, um, I do want to like definitely get it out there because just the premise of a

160
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,960
game in an NES game and stuff like that, I think that should be able to get some quick

161
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,840
bait articles on some sites.

162
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,680
So we can see if I can put together like something like that.

163
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,600
Well, you had that YouTube that was like, you're not going to believe this one dude,

164
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,800
but still, but still it shows that, yeah, you know, as people that think it's so weird

165
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,960
in a good way that they, they want to highlight it.

166
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:08,560
So yeah, so, so, so far we've got, was it, we've got the, the park level, we've got a

167
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:15,280
cemetery levels, uh, snowy mountains and then like sort of a Western theme.

168
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:21,480
So that, that's what we've got done so far and now I'm working on, um, it's a inside

169
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,840
of the Nintendo type level.

170
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,620
So it's all circuit boards and stuff.

171
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,520
So that's what I'm working on artwork for right now.

172
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,200
And that's just going to be like an amalgamation of all the different things in the game.

173
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,080
But yeah, it, it's going to get pretty hard.

174
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,920
And um, I was telling the originals pretty difficult, which, but by the way I did play,

175
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,040
so not to get too far into my gaming week, but oops, I did play some pixel poops the

176
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,000
other night just because, you know, it's a, it's a fun little game to sit down and

177
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,280
play for a little bit.

178
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,540
And um, I got, I broke Aaron's score.

179
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:57,000
So I have the number one score right now in the, in the base, like default mode, basically

180
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,300
I have the number one score.

181
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,560
And the only reason it didn't get higher, I was trying to go in and screenshot when

182
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,660
I hit 666 because you know, LOL.

183
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,360
And then of course I was so focused on getting the screenshot at 66, 66.

184
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,360
When did I lose?

185
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,840
667.

186
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:21,520
So that's, that's the current high score in the world world world for a pixel poops.

187
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,520
So yeah.

188
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
So yeah.

189
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,360
And basically once, once I do have the game done, like I am still looking at physical

190
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,640
like versions of that.

191
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,480
I don't know how I want to do that yet.

192
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,240
If that involves like a Kickstarter and then with Kickstarter, it's like, okay, well, what

193
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,800
do I actually need the fund because you know, how much is going to go to Kickstarter then

194
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,000
taxes and costs and you got to make something off of it.

195
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,080
So, you know, it's all of that stuff involved.

196
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,000
That's like, I don't know, cause I've never run a Kickstarter.

197
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So who knows?

198
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,360
That's a interesting way thing to look into.

199
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,520
You can also, there's alternate crown fundings too.

200
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,440
Um, but that might be an interesting way to do it because at least you have a finished

201
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,120
product and you'll be able to say, here is the game on steam right here.

202
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,680
This is to produce a physical version of said game and you're not going to have to worry

203
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,240
about the whole like, well, I don't know if I want to buy it cause I don't know if it'll

204
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,320
actually happen cause it's done.

205
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,320
Like you just, you're trying to get the publishing stuff.

206
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,040
And I think that's a good way to do it.

207
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
So I may do that.

208
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,160
Um, the other thing I did want to do as well is I have got that nice cover artwork once

209
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,960
I get the logo added onto it as well.

210
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,960
I'm going to make a t-shirt, t-shirts, I'll have that at some point too.

211
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,000
So you'll be able to buy shirts for that kind of stuff.

212
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,280
But yeah, I know a place that has a growing store, but now I'm sure you want to make your

213
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
own coin off it.

214
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
I gotcha.

215
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
But yeah, go for it.

216
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
So, yeah.

217
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
All right.

218
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,440
Um, Bobby is that now I don't want to turn this into the pixel poop show because we are

219
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,160
going to talk about other gaming, but this is a, this is kind of a big deal.

220
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,220
Like the game that Loki's been talking about for a year and a half is finally releasing

221
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,220
this week.

222
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,840
You can go wishlist it on steam.

223
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,560
It hasn't even been a year and a half.

224
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,920
It's only been six months.

225
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,920
Yeah.

226
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,920
Hard to believe.

227
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,920
I guess I'm adding the time to car stuff I think just in my mind.

228
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
Yeah.

229
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
That's been a while.

230
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
Yeah.

231
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,080
So, um, I, I would go wishlist the game on steam right now if you haven't already.

232
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,640
Um, I'm sorry, I don't have a link available, but you guys are smart in chat.

233
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,960
Somebody will find that link in five seconds and post it.

234
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,280
So, uh, go wishlist it right now because the more that have it wishlisted, of course, the

235
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,880
more people that might see it and all that good stuff.

236
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,400
Um, and we want to make sure why we are low key get views and it is, remember the base

237
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
is going to be free.

238
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,640
So you're not like committing to buy anything or whatever.

239
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,840
If you don't want to get the DLC, you don't have to.

240
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,600
Um, but, uh, the base thing will be free and you should definitely grab that.

241
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
I encourage that.

242
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
So, uh, cool.

243
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
All right.

244
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Anyway.

245
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
Okay.

246
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,600
Sorry.

247
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Lots of stuff, but it's important.

248
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,920
There's a long running OLR joke that's climaxing this week.

249
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,020
So let's check that out on steam.

250
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,700
It's important for us to talk about, uh, let's get into, um, by the way, I love that behind

251
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,200
you tonight, you have, that's either the arcade version of moonwalker or the Genesis version

252
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,960
of the arcade playing behind you.

253
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,920
I've never played the arcade version that they was the same as the, uh, I have just

254
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,920
a couple of times.

255
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,400
I have just a couple of times.

256
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,400
It's awesome.

257
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,720
Uh, it was, it was a great, great game and I'm assuming this is your continued, uh, to

258
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,180
the moon talk.

259
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:11,140
You must have because I just was thinking, I saw, um, like before the show, it was on

260
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,060
the scroll and Bobby's show talking about end Walker.

261
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,060
I was like, Oh yeah.

262
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,060
Moonwalker.

263
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,060
I could do that.

264
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,060
Okay.

265
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,060
Okay.

266
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,060
Okay.

267
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,060
Clever.

268
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,060
Clever.

269
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,060
Speaking of to the moon, doge coin.

270
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,060
Glad I got in what I did.

271
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,060
Did you get in a doge coin?

272
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,060
Good for you.

273
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,060
Yeah.

274
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:29,180
It's I didn't get in much like 50 bucks, but it's already doubled.

275
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,100
So you know, that's better than nothing.

276
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,180
And I guess I put 50 bucks on Ethereum just out of the blue last week and it got to 60.

277
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,460
I think now it's around like 58, but I'm just going to let it sit for a little bit.

278
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,100
See what happens.

279
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:47,980
It's money that would have been like a lotto ticket or a slot machine, like, you know,

280
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,860
in the real, in a non COVID world, you know, and still like with the GameStop and like

281
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,340
AMC still holding on that stuff for now, cause it's already dropped in price.

282
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:03,260
It may come back next week, never know, or make bump up a little bit.

283
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:07,420
And if not, I just dump it and buy more doge coin.

284
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:12,660
I'm going to our chat, fifth dream props to you cause you found the links to the steam

285
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,660
store first.

286
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,660
So thank you for that.

287
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,660
All right.

288
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,100
Let's get to our kickoff topic tonight.

289
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,620
We want to talk about this.

290
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,380
Some big gaming news that came out early this week, and I'm sure you all have a lot of feelings

291
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,380
on it.

292
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,420
It's fine.

293
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,820
It's well, there is, there's what this is and what this isn't.

294
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,820
Let's get into it.

295
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,820
Loki.

296
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,820
I got it.

297
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:39,860
So what, what it is is basically so stadia, the, you know, and to any console really,

298
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,860
you know, the console is only as strong as the games that are on it.

299
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,980
And you know, really when it comes to stadia, it was like, okay, what are the killer apps?

300
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,900
What is the exclusive game that I got to play on stadia?

301
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,620
That's really going to drive me to that platform.

302
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,780
Well, now there's not going to be any because Google stadia has announced that they are

303
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:05,860
no longer going to be pursuing internal development on their own games.

304
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:11,900
So they've closed its two game studios in Montreal and Los Angeles.

305
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,300
And apparently that is impacting about 150 developers.

306
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:24,260
So no new game from Jade Raymond, you know, now it's just going to continue to operate

307
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:29,980
its service and it's a $10 monthly stadia pro service as well.

308
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:35,780
I mean, I gotta be honest, like this is definitely the writing on the wall.

309
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:42,860
Like I would be very wary to buy anything on stadia purchasing any games because I mean,

310
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,380
we could be talking about next year, this could be shutting down.

311
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,900
I mean, it's, I don't know, they're already cutting their losses.

312
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:56,180
So it seems to be that this is just kind of one step into that direction of actually shutting

313
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,180
the whole service down.

314
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:02,220
Well, and to be clear, because I said, there's what this news is and what this news isn't,

315
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,580
this is not that news that stadia is shutting down, which I think a lot of people were kind

316
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,300
of reading into it that way.

317
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,300
This is not that this is Google saying that they're essentially refocusing.

318
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:16,540
But it's, it's all kind of PR speak that we can see right through for that they didn't

319
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:22,100
see the need to continue developing the games in house, whether the games just weren't turning

320
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,820
out at the level they were hoping or what it was, if that had to do with some of the

321
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,980
response to stadia, I don't know if we'll know, unfortunately, and I've said this a

322
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:36,500
million times on the show, and I don't think we say it enough, is that a lot of times in

323
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,700
fandom press, which is, you know, what a lot of gaming blogs and stuff is, especially when

324
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,980
it comes to social media, especially when it comes to social media.

325
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:51,060
The reality is, the truth, and what Google's intentions are, and what Google is trying

326
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,660
to do and what Google might have been doing, the truth doesn't matter.

327
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,660
And I know that sounds like a really stupid thing to say.

328
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,660
But that is the reality.

329
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,860
The truth doesn't matter.

330
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,300
What matters?

331
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,660
Perception.

332
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,700
Perception is what matters.

333
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,800
How is news perceived?

334
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:15,920
And gotta be honest, when Google first announced stadia, what were several people in our chat

335
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,920
room saying?

336
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,920
What were several people on social media saying?

337
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,560
What were a lot of people out there saying?

338
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,780
Well, Google's getting into this, but Google doesn't have the greatest track record at

339
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,720
supporting the stuff they put out there.

340
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,560
I give it a couple years, and now what happens?

341
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,460
Google's slowly yanking that support.

342
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,920
At least that's the perception.

343
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,440
And that's all that matters.

344
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,640
So that's why this is...

345
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,720
It's unfortunate, because I know people who like stadia.

346
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,520
I know people who really fan for stadia and want to see stadia do better.

347
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:54,160
And I'm trying to be very cautious to not rain on the parade, because I'm sure they're

348
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,160
already feeling crappy enough after this week and so forth.

349
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,200
Good for you for sticking by it and what you believe in.

350
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,000
And I don't think cloud gaming is going to be...

351
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:13,960
I'm not even sure stadia is really super duper done, but I think the imagining scenario

352
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:20,360
that Google painted for us is that stadia is going to be an invisible console that competes

353
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,360
right up there with Xbox One and PlayStation 5 and all.

354
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,360
Eh, no.

355
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,360
You know what?

356
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,280
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

357
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,280
And Google has now just said, we're not interested in developing our own games anymore.

358
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,000
So that whole thing, I think, is gone.

359
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,480
So now it's just about, how else can stadia be leveraged?

360
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:49,160
Who can insert stadia into that magic winning formula where maybe stadia comes back as something

361
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,040
else and not that imaginary fourth console?

362
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,040
Loki, I want to let you have a say.

363
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,540
No, I was going to say, yeah, exactly that.

364
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,880
It's just, I don't know.

365
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:07,640
Your whole business model is just kind of not as appealing as something else, like where

366
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,000
you have that kind of Netflix model where you just basically pay a fee and you can have

367
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,040
access to a library of games.

368
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,440
And again, that's perception fucking stadia, I'm sorry to interrupt, but that's perception

369
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,820
fucking stadia again, because when it was announced, oh, Google's putting out this service

370
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:29,060
and you pay $10 a month and you get some games, everybody's kind of thinking, oh, Google's

371
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,900
going to do the Netflix things for game.

372
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,780
Great. And that's that's the perception people have.

373
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,860
Right. Oh, if Google's charging 10 bucks a month, which is what they were out there doing

374
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,540
with pro and all that, then I must be able to get in there and play all those games for

375
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,380
free. And then it was like, oh, you can play some games for free.

376
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,860
You can play these games that we have the arrangement, but you don't get to play everything

377
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,460
for free. In fact, you have to pay $60 if you want to play like cyberpunk and stuff.

378
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,060
And I think that's where the public went.

379
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,420
Oh, never mind.

380
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,140
And I think that's a big part of what has hurt Stadia from the beginning.

381
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,940
So it's yeah, it's.

382
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:11,380
It's just it's it's not helping at all, and it's going to be hard to see them already,

383
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:16,020
even like we've had some stuff where, you know, stuff that you think should have supported

384
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:21,220
it, like I don't even know if like their plate, their Google TV stuff supports Stadia.

385
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:27,220
I don't believe it does, which is kind of seems to be a big miss right there as well.

386
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,460
It's just like half half assed kind of support from Google for it.

387
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,940
And there was a lot of confusion, like I didn't even realize until this week that you

388
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,540
didn't need a Stadia pro account to play Stadia games in the browser now that at some

389
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,060
point they flip the switch for that.

390
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,940
I didn't even realize that, like Google's had a big problem with messaging now for it

391
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:52,300
to their credit during this whole pandemic and the fact that it's killed all these

392
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,500
conventions and the opportunity for them to go show the public a little more about this

393
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:02,820
stuff. I will I will allow them to shift some blame on that, that, you know, they had a

394
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,140
hard time getting the messaging out because of the pandemic.

395
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,460
I get that.

396
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:11,900
I understand that. But I still wish they would have invested another year in trying to

397
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,580
get the right messaging out if they really wanted this to be successful.

398
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,380
But, you know, maybe they just have to take some time to use the rest of this pandemic to

399
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,900
figure out what that thing is and then go with it, because, you know, there's lots of

400
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,980
still great ideas and I think uses for cloud gaming out there.

401
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,540
You know, I think it would be brilliant if Google partnered up with Valve or something so

402
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:34,220
that when you buy a game on Steam, you can either install it to your computer or you can

403
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:39,700
play in the cloud. And imagine imagine if like demos were available through the cloud.

404
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,340
I think so many people want to be doing demos in the cloud where you don't have to wait

405
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,380
and download all this stuff.

406
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,740
And again, look at a place like Steam when they do like the developer days where they

407
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,540
fill up the front page with like 40 different demos.

408
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,900
And it's like they all look neat and you want to try them.

409
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,660
But like click, download, wait, start.

410
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,900
OK, I didn't I didn't care for that one.

411
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,660
Uninstalled. Why can't you just click a fucking button and play the game?

412
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:12,420
I don't know. Amazon has it where you can click a button and you can get Tide Pod sent

413
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,460
to your house tomorrow.

414
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,500
Why don't we have that for games?

415
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,420
I think we do have it in certain places, but Google should be enabling that here.

416
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:27,300
You know, so I feel like there are still places where Stadia could kind of carve a niche

417
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,660
for itself, but it's just it's not going to be the fourth console or whatever.

418
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:38,420
So. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, because it's patented, I don't know if the game

419
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,500
delivery thing is maybe that is patented, I don't know.

420
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,300
The Amazon thing, though, you went over that on your show last week and that patent

421
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,580
expired a couple of years ago.

422
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,540
I do believe you recapped at the end there.

423
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,380
So one click ordering is is open.

424
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,100
So I don't know about I don't know if there's a patent for one click gaming.

425
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,660
You're right. Maybe somebody's patented that already, which is a whole other issue.

426
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,900
But I don't have time to get into that on this three hour show.

427
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:12,260
So SSU 100 Matt in chat says, could they just be looking to go the epic route and pay

428
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,940
loads for exclusives, exclusive games?

429
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,540
I don't want to see that happen, but it's possible.

430
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,460
You're right. It's possible.

431
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,380
And if Google is going to do that, they should probably make that they should have made

432
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:29,580
that move with this announcement and and kind of I get you don't want to see it.

433
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:34,260
But if Google wanted to show they were serious with this whole we're changing our model

434
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:39,020
or whatever, then they would have announced whatever game, even though we are developing

435
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,420
our own game anymore. We have obtained the exclusive rights to distribute that whatever

436
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,860
title they come up with to kind of immediately fill in the gap.

437
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,060
They didn't do that. And I don't think that was a great idea.

438
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,220
I'm not sure Stadia was incredibly well managed as it is.

439
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,140
And then we have to remember Phil Harrison's in charge.

440
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,380
And what what what has Phil Harrison done for gaming?

441
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:05,940
Like, if you look at his resume, he was in a lot of companies during their low points.

442
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,980
Sorry, not sorry.

443
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,660
I let the facts speak for themselves.

444
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,700
So maybe Stadia just needs somebody else running it.

445
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:22,420
Sorry. So, yeah, anyway, cloud gaming, I'm sure is not done for.

446
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:27,500
In fact, we're a long way from that because, you know, Nvidia, I like the Nvidia thing

447
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,780
that I kind of messed around with once because you can kind of use it for free and you can

448
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,060
use it with your Steam library.

449
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,060
And No Man's Sky was on there.

450
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:38,300
I didn't feel like No Man's Sky looked any better than it did if I'm running it on my own

451
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,140
computer. But it was a neat little experiment.

452
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,020
So, you know, there's that Amazon had their own.

453
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,460
But then, you know, Amazon is having a lot of struggles making their own game as well.

454
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,300
We all know that. I just I just again, I would love to see.

455
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:57,460
Like in the PlayStation stores, I want Sony to to get this technology or something because

456
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:03,340
we know Microsoft's got it because Microsoft is I still kind of like that cloud thing is

457
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:07,340
coming. Yes, I know they are still you can do it with your phones and controller and

458
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:15,500
stuff. But I think when it arrives where on my Xbox 360, I can run a cloud X cloud app

459
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,340
and play Halo Master Chief collection through the cloud or so.

460
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:25,220
I think that will be a great use case argument by Microsoft, but we're not not just there

461
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,220
yet, but maybe by the end of the year.

462
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:33,740
We'll see. And then Microsoft will have the ability to say, OK, well, for your, you know,

463
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,900
fifteen dollar a month or whatever they're charging for now for Microsoft Game Pass.

464
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:43,420
Yes, you get all these games in the cloud because a lot of Game Pass games are also tied

465
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,940
into X Cloud right now.

466
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,860
And so Microsoft will be able to deliver that Netflix perception that the audience was

467
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,300
associating with Google Stadia.

468
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,220
There is that so.

469
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:58,860
All right, well, if we got nothing else to say on Stadia, if you want to email us and

470
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:04,940
give us your thoughts on all of this, you sure can participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

471
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:10,380
SSJ 100 Matt says, I mean, it's still the best and most stable place to play cyberpunk.

472
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:15,900
Why Google is not able to better leverage that, I'll never understand.

473
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,620
Again, it's all adding up to part of the thing where I'm like, I just think Stadia just in

474
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,220
general just isn't being run well.

475
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:27,780
All right, moving on, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we've

476
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,860
been playing this week.

477
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,620
Loki, I feel like we kind of covered it, but did you get a chance to play any games besides

478
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,420
developing your own?

479
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:44,580
I played a little bit of Orna and a little bit of Pokemon Go as well.

480
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,940
That was a very, very minimal.

481
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,980
It's been mostly just working on my game this week.

482
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,660
I figured as much.

483
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,220
It's probably been taking up most of your week.

484
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,620
Well, I look forward to your game releasing so you can actually play some other games this

485
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,060
next year.

486
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,180
Yes, me too.

487
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,300
All right, going back to the last story a little bit to get a comment here.

488
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,700
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says they did mention cyberpunk in the first paragraph of their

489
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,980
blog, so they're trying to reference it.

490
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,940
I think that's probably the worst place they could reference it if they want me to take it

491
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,700
seriously.

492
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,860
And maybe they've done this.

493
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,540
I don't know, but I haven't seen it.

494
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:26,700
Buy a Twitch ad, buy a pre-roll Twitch ad that says cyberpunk on Stadia, best place to play

495
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,820
with the quotes, best place to experience cyberpunk, smoothest experience.

496
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,100
I don't use the pull quotes.

497
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,860
It should be on Twitch pre-roll ads.

498
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:39,300
It should be on a commercial on TV during that little little dog and pony show they got

499
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,020
going right now.

500
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,900
That should be an ad, although, of course, it costs millions of dollars.

501
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:48,900
So maybe they'll have to go to the network that literally has the dog and pony show with

502
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,820
the cheaper ads right now, the counterprogramming.

503
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,500
But they should be putting that stuff out there.

504
00:28:54,740 --> 00:29:01,100
So it's, you know, burying it in a press release isn't exactly informing the public and

505
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,580
trying to shift the perception.

506
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,980
That's just my thing.

507
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:10,420
All right. Black Compat in chat says, I'm currently playing God of War again, but this

508
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,820
time on my PlayStation 5.

509
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,700
It's so pretty.

510
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:17,980
Yeah, because they went back and they did like a little upgrade patch, didn't they, on

511
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,340
that? Like they did like a whole like PS5 kind of patching for that.

512
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,980
So if you're you're playing it on your PlayStation 5, you get a little something,

513
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,620
something extra. I hope we see that for some more games.

514
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,220
So I do.

515
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,220
I do hope so.

516
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,580
You know, I do hope Sony starts to get into this cloud stuff, too.

517
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,580
But we'll see. We'll see.

518
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,900
All right. Moving on.

519
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,980
Let's talk about my gaming week.

520
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:44,220
So honestly, I've continued to play a lot of Final Fantasy 14.

521
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,460
In fact, I even did a whole stream about Final Fantasy 14 on Friday here at VOG Network.

522
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,700
But we'll get into that story in a little bit.

523
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,820
I mean, see, it's coming up here on the show.

524
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,620
So we'll talk about that a little bit.

525
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,860
Outside of Final Fantasy 14, I've been playing a lot, a lot.

526
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,540
I've been, of course, playing, you know, the GPS games, Pokemon Go.

527
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:06,460
I was able to catch a lot of the Rosalie's today, the shiny ones.

528
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:11,060
I got like 12 of them, kind of more than I usually get on a shiny day.

529
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,740
I think I might have been like 15.

530
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,660
I lost count. That's how many I got.

531
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,580
So and that's that's one of my favorite Pokemon, actually.

532
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,620
So I'm glad I got a lot of shinies of that one.

533
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,100
So that was that was fun.

534
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,620
As far as like other games I've been playing, there is a new game

535
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,420
I checked out this week, thanks to Xbox Game Pass.

536
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,460
It's called Cyber Shadow.

537
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,660
That's Cyber something Cyber Shadow I checked out this week.

538
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,700
So Cyber Shadow is by Yacht Club Games,

539
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,580
which was the company that brought a Shovel Knight.

540
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,780
So this is kind of like their next game.

541
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,340
So Shovel Knight, of course, was a very retro inspired game

542
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,860
that really invoked kind of a lot of the old Capcom classic

543
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,180
carts like DuckTales and things like that.

544
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,220
Of course, Shovel Knight kind of put its own spin on it.

545
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,140
So Cyber Shadow is kind of that.

546
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:03,580
But for Ninja Gaiden, which

547
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,220
but but to just say very much Ninja Gaiden

548
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,620
to just say it's a clone of that, though, I don't think is accurate.

549
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:17,420
It definitely has like the play feel of it is very that.

550
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,140
But a lot of the boss design is very different.

551
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,580
A lot of the level design is different because I noticed this

552
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,500
a little ways into it.

553
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,860
There are like secret areas and places where there's blocks

554
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,260
that you can crush to kind of find a whole other area.

555
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:34,420
And I after like admittedly, I've only played a couple of stages into it.

556
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:38,300
But looking at the map, it looks like you might have to backtrack

557
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,380
Blaster Master style to kind of go visit other areas.

558
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,380
Like it's not just linear.

559
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,140
It seems like there might be power ups

560
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,580
and things that allow you to carve out a different path.

561
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,260
So I think there might be a little bit of like Ninja Gaiden

562
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,260
meets Master Blaster in that.

563
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,500
So I think and that's that's fine by me.

564
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,940
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, yeah, feels very Ninja Gaiden

565
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,620
inspired and super tough.

566
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:09,380
It is definitely there is no Bobby Black Wolf mode, I'm sorry to say.

567
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,460
It is a challenging game.

568
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,460
However, it does appear you have infinite lives.

569
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,780
And so it's not like Ninja Gaiden where like you lose three lives

570
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,060
and you have to go all the way back to the beginning of the act.

571
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,340
You just every time you die, you just respond at a save point.

572
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,540
So there is that.

573
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,700
So it feels a little more like maybe Super Meat Boy in that sense,

574
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,860
because you're playing relatively short little bursts

575
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,660
to get to the next save point.

576
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,620
And you don't have to go like all the way back,

577
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,420
which was the thing that was really tough about something like Ninja Gaiden.

578
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,140
So, you know, again, that's another way that it's kind of different

579
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,420
from the Ninja Gaiden formula where I don't want to say, oh,

580
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,900
this is just a clone of that game, because it definitely has

581
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,060
its own differences that make even a nails

582
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,540
tough game a little bit.

583
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,260
Easier to stomach, if that makes sense.

584
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,220
So but I'm enjoying it, I want to play more of it.

585
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,420
And I even got some achievements.

586
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,340
Bobby in chat is like, no, me mode.

587
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,900
I'm going to tell you, Bobby,

588
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,140
why this mode is or why this game is not going to make you happy,

589
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,580
because I popped two achievements.

590
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:19,060
One of them was worth 16 points and the other one was worth, I think, 31 points.

591
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:22,180
So it violates Bobby's multiple of five thing

592
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,660
where, you know, and maybe other people have this, too,

593
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:31,380
where you get a little about my gamer score must end in zero or five.

594
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,580
I have I have no place for a 16 or 31 or whatever it is.

595
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:40,340
So I think on that principle, it's going to lose Bobby support.

596
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,220
But if you don't, if you're if your gamer score has already been ruined

597
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,340
by something else or you really don't give a rat's ass about it like me,

598
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,660
it's on Game Pass for PC and Xbox.

599
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,620
So if you're on that Game Pass thing,

600
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,620
you really should just go check it out because you're already paying for it.

601
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,780
So go make use of what you're paying for.

602
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,820
It's a good game in that regard.

603
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,300
So have you you know about it, Loki, right?

604
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,700
But you just haven't played it.

605
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,900
Yeah, I'm well aware of it because, you know, it looked very much

606
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,140
like Ninja Gaiden, like even down to the sprites and everything.

607
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,220
So, yeah, very, very aware of it.

608
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,140
Yeah. Even the first boss was like not even like Ninja Gaiden's

609
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,300
first boss was like like you just duck and attack a bunch.

610
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,620
You win. This one was way it was like a three pronged thing

611
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,380
where you kind of had to like hit the middle when it came down

612
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,060
and then dodge the guns on the other two.

613
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,140
It was much more complicated.

614
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:36,580
Like so it is interesting how even something that's retro

615
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:40,580
inspired can kind of do things that they just really didn't do a lot

616
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,580
on eight bit hardware, whether it's the limitations or whatever it is.

617
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:50,340
Can you imagine, Loki, if you had made Pixel Poops 2 just retro inspired,

618
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:54,460
but you made it for like the Xbox where you don't have to worry about the space.

619
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,260
You can do whatever you want.

620
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,500
Yeah. So now you have to go back to a remaster or something like that.

621
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,020
Now you have to go back and make it all 16 by nine.

622
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:07,700
Just make the play fields bigger.

623
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,940
Yeah, that would be nice, you know, having, you know,

624
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,540
not to adhere to the NES stuff.

625
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,620
But Pixel Poops, Pixel Poops 3, please look forward to it.

626
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:24,020
All right. Well, Pixel Poops 3 is going to be Pixel Poops 3D at that point.

627
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,900
Oh, Virtual Boy game. Awesome.

628
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,380
I can't wait. Yeah, there you go. Yeah.

629
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,100
All right. Let's get into some gaming news.

630
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,700
What else has been going on around the gaming world this week?

631
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,700
Loki, what do you got for us?

632
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,340
All right. So let's see.

633
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,180
We've got this is kind of unique.

634
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,220
There's a PlayStation game coming to the Xbox.

635
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:51,380
So much like dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria.

636
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:56,300
So like much like how we have, you know, Microsoft publishing,

637
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,700
you know, Minecraft on other platforms.

638
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,260
Mario and Sonic at the at the Olympics that never happened.

639
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:09,700
Yes. And then also we have now MLB The Show 21,

640
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:14,060
which is a PlayStation Studios title now coming to the Xbox

641
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:18,340
one and Xbox Series X starting this April.

642
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,380
So that is the first that used to be a PlayStation exclusive.

643
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,100
And well, you know, I guess we just need more baseball out there

644
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,060
because honestly, I think aside from MLB 2K,

645
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,940
which I don't think even exists anymore,

646
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,460
PlayStation was like the only place you can get a baseball game.

647
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,740
So it's nice to see that that is multi platform now.

648
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,340
I believe we had a story several months ago.

649
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,740
We knew this was coming

650
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,140
because it had something to do with retaining the license.

651
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:53,020
Like Sony would not be able to continue to hold the license for that

652
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,220
if they didn't put the game out on other consoles.

653
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,260
I want to say that's what was playing up.

654
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,100
Yep. And I'm looking in chat. There it is.

655
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,500
Bobby in chat says MLB mandated this or else they were going to pull the license.

656
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,780
They wanted a sim game on all consoles.

657
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,700
They had the exclusive sim license.

658
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,980
Yeah, I remember.

659
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,500
See, I remember something from a few months ago where we actually knew

660
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,700
this was coming. It's just it's finally here.

661
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:19,100
And it's it's that shock of seeing a Sony PlayStation

662
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,020
studio logo on an Xbox.

663
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,180
You think it'll come to Game Pass?

664
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,820
Mm hmm. I doubt it.

665
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,580
We'll see. I don't know.

666
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,580
As soon as possible.

667
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,900
As soon as Matt is pointing out,

668
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,060
EA lost the license or really let it go years ago.

669
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:37,780
So this is, you know, even though, yes, there's other baseball sims,

670
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,220
this is the only, you know, MLB

671
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,940
endorsed one that actually has MLB players in it.

672
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,660
Does Konami make a why do I feel like Konami makes a baseball game?

673
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,780
I don't know why my brain is.

674
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,580
Well, they have the power of pro like baseball game.

675
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,460
It's like the kind of anime.

676
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,420
This was not real, but it's not MLB.

677
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,780
It's just fantasy.

678
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,540
MLB. So it's like baseball stars or something. Yeah.

679
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,620
Yeah. Yeah. MLB 2K.

680
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,940
Back in the day, like way back in the day, EA had an MLB game.

681
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,020
I think even they have like

682
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,220
I don't know if they had college baseball as well.

683
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,900
EA used to have a ton of sports games and they kind of slimmed it down a bit.

684
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,980
But I mean, oh, I forgot about that.

685
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,420
That's going back as a 200.

686
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:32,300
Matt says they do have RBI baseball, but that game is more made in house by MLB.

687
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,420
Sean 322 clarifies has real players, but it's more animated.

688
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,060
And Bobby kind of clarifies that as arcadey. So.

689
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,300
So it's still it's still going to be that shock.

690
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:51,740
Do you think Sony may experiment putting anything else out on Microsoft's consoles?

691
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:55,540
Probably not unless they're forced to. No, I doubt it. Yeah, I doubt it, too.

692
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,900
But what about you know, there's always that rumor

693
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,620
about Microsoft trying to put their stuff on other consoles, too.

694
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,700
Do you think we might see some of their studios open up?

695
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,980
I think it's certainly possible, especially when we're talking about

696
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,100
things like Bethesda, which Microsoft now owns.

697
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,700
Like, I think a lot of those games are still going to come out on Sony

698
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,180
and even whatever works for the Nintendo switch, they'll put out

699
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,500
on the Nintendo switch.

700
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,900
So it is interesting that we're all kind of losing our shit

701
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,420
overseeing a Sony logo on a Microsoft box.

702
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:29,260
But like, I think we're all kind of prepared for at least Microsoft assets

703
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,580
to show up on other consoles.

704
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,980
It may just not have a Microsoft logo on it.

705
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,140
It may have Bethesda's logo, but that's going to happen.

706
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,100
So, yeah, it's kind of interesting. So

707
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,460
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says

708
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:46,580
the new Bethesda games will not go to switch or PS5.

709
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,820
There's no way the Elder Scrolls six will be on any console,

710
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,060
not in the Xbox ecosystem.

711
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:56,580
Have they I have they clarified that because I thought they said

712
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,460
they did interviews where they were actually pushing the opposite narrative

713
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,260
where the guy was saying, well, we haven't made any decisions on that yet.

714
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,420
You know, and you can you know,

715
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:07,100
you can maybe read the tea leaves where it's going to go that way.

716
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,860
I feel like it might happen.

717
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,020
But and this is a big but.

718
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,700
Microsoft's going to have the must have version.

719
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,020
There's going to be a bunch of shit that's cut out for the other stuff.

720
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,420
It's going to be like

721
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,700
when Destiny first came out.

722
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,500
It had like a whole extra zone on PlayStation

723
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,500
that wasn't even on the Microsoft version.

724
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,540
And Sony was like pushing it almost like it was one of their own exclusive games

725
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:40,580
because they had such a great deal with Activision to get all this exclusive stuff.

726
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,900
I feel like that could be kind of a middle ground

727
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,220
where Microsoft still has like the must have version.

728
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:51,900
But they they they give a little little pittance to the other ecosystems.

729
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,780
So we'll see.

730
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:59,220
Bobby says, but if you want to play Elder Scrolls six, you'll need an Xbox.

731
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,980
Just like if you want to play God of War, you need a PlayStation or a PC.

732
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:07,700
Or a PC for probably either of those games,

733
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:11,620
eventually, the way some of the other Sony things have been going as of late.

734
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:15,100
So we'll we'll give that one to the PC fanboys.

735
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,020
All right.

736
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,420
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about some other news that came out this week.

737
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,580
And this news is very exciting for me,

738
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,260
which was the new Final Fantasy 14 expansion that was announced.

739
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:30,340
And of course, I talk a lot in my gaming weeks about how I play a lot

740
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,820
of Final Fantasy 14.

741
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,980
So, of course, I was very excited to watch this announcement showcase

742
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,220
that they did on Friday,

743
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:41,820
because essentially this was the event that I'd gone to in Vegas three times.

744
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,820
Now, we all know why it didn't happen in person this time

745
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,020
and why it was delayed a few months. Hello, Covid.

746
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,220
But they finally kind of gave us the information

747
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,460
that we would have got at the scheduled.

748
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,700
Actually, they were going to move it this year to San Diego.

749
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,980
They had announced that just before the pandemic started was that, oh, yeah,

750
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,420
we're going to do Fan Fest in October, but it's in San Diego this time.

751
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,300
So for whatever reason, they were moving it.

752
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,780
And then, of course, they they called it off altogether.

753
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,300
So we got some of the information about the new expansion.

754
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,580
And as Loki kind of referred to earlier in the show, it is called Endwalker,

755
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:19,100
which I love it because you can abbreviate it as Ew for short.

756
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,740
Ew, David.

757
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:24,100
But now it's Ew. Ew, Yoshi P.

758
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,300
Anyway, it's going to be coming out this fall, so it will be out this year.

759
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,420
One of the things that they showcased

760
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:35,580
as part of the event was a new healer job, which is the first healer job

761
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,100
they've put in the game since Astrologian,

762
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,140
which, if I remember right, would have been 2018,

763
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:48,340
2015 was when Heaven's Word came out and the Astrologian.

764
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,340
So it's been a little while since we had a healer in the game, so Sage

765
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,660
and Sage is a barrier healer.

766
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,420
There will be a melee DPS, but we don't know what it is yet.

767
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,420
A lot of sleuths on Reddit and people that I know

768
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:05,620
are trying to figure it out from some of the things that were in the trailer.

769
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:11,820
It is believed that there is multiple cases where a scythe has been visible

770
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:15,300
and some of the T-shirts that Yoshi P was wearing

771
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,820
have referenced a reaper or a scythe type of character.

772
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,500
So people are kind of going that direction with it,

773
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,900
that it will be some type of DPS that wields a scythe.

774
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,580
It was also clarified in a Japanese interview that Yoshi P did.

775
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:31,580
The class will share gear with Dragoon,

776
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,100
which means it's going to be a strength based class,

777
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,500
not a dexterity based class like Ninja would use.

778
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,620
So there is all of that coming into it.

779
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:41,060
A lot of people thinking we're getting some type of,

780
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,500
some people are saying necromancer, some people are saying like a reaper.

781
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,900
I think Final Fantasy 14 has done this very well,

782
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:52,660
where they've kind of invented their own classes based around Final Fantasy history.

783
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:56,380
So I think we're going to get some type of scythe based melee class

784
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,900
that will be the class that people thought Dark Knight would be.

785
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:01,700
So there will be that.

786
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:06,460
So let's see some other things that they announced.

787
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,260
This will be the end of the story.

788
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:13,140
They have started the story with Zodiark and Hydaelyn

789
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:16,260
all the way back in 1.0 and Realm Reborn, really.

790
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,740
This will be the end of that.

791
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,820
However, and they stress this many times, many times,

792
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:23,460
this will not be the end of Final Fantasy 14.

793
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,460
This will not be the end of Yoshi P's involvement.

794
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:31,100
I think one way to kind of equate it is that this is the end of Marvel

795
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:35,060
Cinematic Universe Part One, and then Marvel Cinematic Universe

796
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,260
Part Two will begin in patch 6.1.

797
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,820
So this is this.

798
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:43,100
This is end game coming out and Walker and game, huh?

799
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,740
Huh? OK, so there's that.

800
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:50,460
So and then after this will be like a new kind of Final Fantasy 14 era.

801
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,780
I thought it was very neat

802
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,340
that Yoshi P came out and said, I see this as my life's work

803
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,460
because, you know, with his involvement producing, but not directing

804
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:04,740
Final Fantasy 16, some folks have kind of wondered what his future is.

805
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:07,540
And I would assume it's inevitable

806
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:11,660
that Final Fantasy 17 or 18 is another MMO.

807
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,180
Why wouldn't they?

808
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:16,220
And why wouldn't they want Yoshi P to be involved somehow?

809
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,780
But it's not happening yet.

810
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,940
So Yoshi P is staying with Final Fantasy 14.

811
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,660
The other big news that was announced,

812
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,180
a PlayStation five version of the game will be coming out

813
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,820
and it will begin in a beta on April 13th.

814
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,500
And this is the best news.

815
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,340
You don't have to buy the PlayStation five version

816
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:38,660
if you already own the PlayStation four version.

817
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:42,420
Yeah, you can just roll over that license to PlayStation five.

818
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:45,220
Actually, no, you don't even have to roll over a license.

819
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:48,340
It just is looking for your PS4 license, basically, which is great.

820
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:53,140
Some may recall when the game first came out, Realm Reborn

821
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:56,660
and I think the first expansion Heavensward were on PlayStation three.

822
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,780
When they finally sunset it, you can no longer play Realm Reborn

823
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,180
or excuse me, Final Fantasy 14 on PlayStation three.

824
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:05,540
They terminated that support, but they gave you a year,

825
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:09,020
maybe a year and a half, where they said you can convert

826
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,820
your PlayStation three license to a PlayStation four license.

827
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,780
But once you do it, you can't go back to PlayStation three.

828
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,980
So this is but they didn't really put that same quantifier

829
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,940
on this PS5 rollover.

830
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,620
But if you own a PlayStation five,

831
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,940
why would you want to go back and play this on PlayStation four?

832
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,780
Play it on PlayStation five.

833
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,700
I I suppose everybody's situation is unique

834
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,780
and maybe the PlayStation five isn't in the place that you want to play.

835
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:34,620
I don't know.

836
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:38,340
But I think for most people, they're going to be very happy with this news.

837
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,780
There will be a virtual fan fest coming up in May 15th and 16th,

838
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:47,140
where the rest of the expansion's details will be unearthed.

839
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,580
And they didn't stop there because they still have a whole nother patch

840
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,620
for the current expansion, Shadowbringers, that they went on

841
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,340
and detailed later that night.

842
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,140
We didn't stream that one

843
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:00,540
because as I figured, it was mostly stuff we were expecting.

844
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,740
It was here's a new dungeon.

845
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,940
We're adding story content here.

846
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:09,260
It's kind of the only maybe thing you could say about Final Fantasy 14.

847
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:12,100
I think it's they've supported it very well.

848
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,340
The game gets regular patches.

849
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:18,700
But I think one of the ways they're able to make the game regular

850
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,780
is it's very formulaic.

851
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:24,740
Like the odd number patch is when you get the new 24 man raid

852
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:27,860
and you get one new dungeon and you get this amount of story.

853
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:30,420
The even numbered patch, you get the new eight man raid

854
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,620
and you might get one trial.

855
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:35,220
And so it's it's it's like we kind of all knew what was coming

856
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,220
before we watched it.

857
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,700
So there was that.

858
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,700
But you know what? It's Final Fantasy 14.

859
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,940
The story is great. I love the game.

860
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:43,860
I'm still eating it up.

861
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,500
Even if I'm saying that's it.

862
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,300
So. All right.

863
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,580
So, yeah, looking forward to the Final Fantasy 14 expansion

864
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:52,900
coming out later this year.

865
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,140
I'm sure I will talk plenty more about it because it is one of my favorite games.

866
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,940
Oh, I have to say this, too.

867
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:04,140
Loved that there was so much Final Fantasy four inspiration in the game.

868
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:07,900
It's the one Final Fantasy that I feel like doesn't have a lot of representation

869
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,860
in the game right now, and it's one of my favorites.

870
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:13,180
And so I love that they're really going full tilt with this.

871
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:16,740
You can get a lunar whale mount, an eight person mount

872
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:20,820
if you get like a fan fest ticket.

873
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,980
So you have to pay money for it. But still.

874
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,100
And they played some of the music.

875
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:30,140
So their music guy, Soken, who is like the Final Fantasy 14 soundtrack is stunning.

876
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:33,300
If you've never heard it, you really owe it to yourself to listen to some tracks

877
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:38,940
from Final Fantasy 14 soundtrack, because Soken is is proving himself

878
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:43,500
in every way to be an heir to that legacy's music

879
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,060
and what Nobui Matsu started many, many, many years ago.

880
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,100
Soken is really fucking good.

881
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:53,300
And he reinterpreted the Final Fantasy four like moon theme

882
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,900
or like the lunar whale theme.

883
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,420
It's so good. You have to hear it.

884
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,540
So I'm really excited about that.

885
00:48:58,540 --> 00:48:59,940
And of course, you know, you're going to the moon.

886
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:03,300
They're putting out minions for Rosa, Edge and Rydia

887
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,020
that are going to be part of the virtual fan fest.

888
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,500
I'm really excited about all of that.

889
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,940
So loving the Final Fantasy four love.

890
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:11,100
Thank you very much.

891
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,260
OK, now I'm done talking about Final Fantasy 14.

892
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,820
We can talk about other video games.

893
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,060
Loki, what do you have for us?

894
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:20,260
It's finishing up some some editing anyways.

895
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,980
Are you working on your game now during the show?

896
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,300
Of course you are.

897
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,580
I was just making some changes to Wikipedia, that's all.

898
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,220
Anyways. Oh, doing some marketing, I see.

899
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,060
Yeah. So anyways,

900
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:38,620
we've got news about what might have been.

901
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:44,300
So Netflix was originally going to have a Zelda show,

902
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:50,380
but it then pulled it back because it leaked out that it was coming out.

903
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,460
So apparently this was a while ago and back in 2015.

904
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:59,020
It was that long ago because I remember these rumors like they were the other day.

905
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,300
I thought it was like two years ago.

906
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,300
Anyway, it was it was a long time ago.

907
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,060
Actually, probably even before that.

908
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:08,660
So they said that during this was kind of

909
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:12,020
that came out when they were talking about,

910
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:16,780
I guess, this College Humor stop motion Star Fox thing that they were working on.

911
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,100
The fantastic Mr. Star Fox.

912
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,940
It came out in 2011.

913
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:24,380
And so apparently because around that time

914
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,220
there was reports that Netflix wasn't going to do Legends of Zelda anymore

915
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:33,220
because basically that it had leaked out that they were going to be doing

916
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:39,420
the Legend of Zelda show and that kind of, I don't know, spooked Nintendo,

917
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,700
but basically say, hey, listen, we're not going to do it anymore

918
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,140
now that it's leaked out that we were going to do that.

919
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:47,780
Seems silly to me that that would be a thing. But.

920
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,580
Nintendo be Nintendo, I guess so.

921
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,540
We can't have Zelda.

922
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:56,780
We can't have nice things because you guys won't stop leaking information about it.

923
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:01,060
Maybe they were worried that a lot more was going to leak out before it was ready.

924
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:04,740
It does seem like an odd reason to pull the plug completely on a project as well.

925
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:09,900
In fact, usually usually the hype machine is kind of a big deal in Hollywood.

926
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,660
I don't know if this is just I admit I'm a little ignorant to this, so I apologize.

927
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:17,780
But I don't know if this may be a culture thing around like Japanese culture

928
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:22,420
and the hype for cinema and TV and projects around there and our culture,

929
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:26,740
because like we find out about projects before somebody's ever even been cast.

930
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,820
You know, Marvel gets out there on stage and says,

931
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:34,740
here's the roadmap for Marvel Cinematic Universe phase two all the way through 2025

932
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:38,540
before we've even like inked a deal to write a fucking script.

933
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,700
Like that's just part of the height.

934
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,300
Like y'all think video games are announced too early.

935
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,380
Look at fucking movies, OK?

936
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,980
Like we find out about this.

937
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:51,500
So to find out that a project is being started years before they've even shot

938
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,340
one frame or anything is very much a part of like the Hollywood Entertainment

939
00:51:55,340 --> 00:52:00,660
Tonight, Access Hollywood variety deadline and all that type of culture.

940
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:04,580
I wonder if it's just and I again, I'm saying I am ignorant.

941
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:08,500
I don't know how this works in Japan because I haven't lived there

942
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:12,260
or followed enough of their culture there where maybe it is not

943
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,180
the same type of hype machine.

944
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:17,780
So when Nintendo kind of heard that this was going on,

945
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,940
they saw it as a threat and they pulled the plug.

946
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,180
That's my only that's all.

947
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,060
That's all I've got to go off of, honestly,

948
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:29,460
because you just don't usually hear about these things stopping because of leaks.

949
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,420
But also, Nintendo is fiercely protective of its properties

950
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:34,740
for better and for worse.

951
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,380
So. Yeah.

952
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,860
So, I mean, it's unfortunate.

953
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:42,500
Does this mean we're not getting the Switch Pro anymore because it's leaked out?

954
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:46,820
You know that there are lots of information allegedly has leaked out about it.

955
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,060
You know that it's coming.

956
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,260
So does that mean we're not getting that anymore?

957
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,300
I doubt it.

958
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:55,820
Tiger Con Chat says also Nintendo is banking on that Super Mario

959
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:57,260
Brothers animated movie.

960
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:01,260
It could make or break them in terms of making movies from some of their IPs.

961
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:05,260
Could you could Universal have approached them when the rumor came out and said,

962
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:09,100
hey, we can do something better, but you've got to call this deal off?

963
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:13,220
I don't know. Maybe I'm no, I'm adding I'm adding too much drama into it.

964
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,220
I don't I don't think that was.

965
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:19,860
Yeah, I don't think that's going to be a anything has to do with it.

966
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:24,300
I think if anything now, I mean, because I mean, granted, this took place

967
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:28,820
like years ago, I mean, look at like what we have on Netflix now.

968
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:33,100
There's like so many series based off of video games that done really well.

969
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,660
So I would think that they'd be less hesitant to put out something now.

970
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:40,180
Maybe there's something in development

971
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:43,020
and just hasn't been leaked out because they learned the lesson the first time.

972
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:43,620
I don't know.

973
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:49,420
So it's I doubt that now if something like that were to happen,

974
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:52,620
I would think that they would be ahead of it, kind of trying to promote it a bit.

975
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,500
Then again, Nintendo's weird.

976
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,980
And so who knows? Who knows?

977
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:00,740
All right. What else you have for us, Loki?

978
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:03,700
All right. So apparently,

979
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:09,460
you know, we had the Mario sets come out for Lego now, and technically we had a

980
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:15,980
Sonic the Hedgehog set come out in the form of a pack for Lego dimensions.

981
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:19,580
But now, thanks to the whole,

982
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:25,620
you know, fan submission process that they have available for Lego ideas,

983
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:30,380
it's there is a set that reached 10,000 fan supporters,

984
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,100
which means it goes through the Lego review process.

985
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:37,380
And Lego has decided that, yes, we will go ahead and make a Sonic

986
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:40,820
Green Hills set for Lego.

987
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:44,460
So it's got right now based on the initial prototype

988
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:49,300
was like this giant Eggman robot, Sonic the Hedgehog minifigs

989
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:54,140
and, you know, some stuff that you would see in Green Hill Zone.

990
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:59,140
But I would imagine we might see some more sets based on that if it sells well.

991
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:01,900
But it's still pretty cool that that's going to be a thing.

992
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:06,020
No word on necessarily when it's coming, but I'd expect sometime later this year.

993
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:08,580
That's pretty exciting.

994
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,060
I think it makes sense.

995
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,740
They've already had that mold for the Sonic character already.

996
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:14,540
So that's kind of half the battle right there.

997
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:20,140
Yeah, it'll be interesting to check it out.

998
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:24,180
I'm curious to see if they'll gamify it at all, kind of like the Mario one.

999
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:27,580
Well, there's some impressive technology there.

1000
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,500
I mean, yeah, that would be cool. They did that.

1001
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,380
I don't think so.

1002
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:33,140
In this case, I think it'll just be like a set,

1003
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,220
kind of like how the Minecraft sets aren't really gamified.

1004
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,820
It's just, you know, Lego set.

1005
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:44,580
I mean, it would be cool to have some more game type stuff with it.

1006
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:47,380
I mean, Dimensions was pretty cool, but.

1007
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:51,140
You know, I don't know, they don't sell that stuff anymore,

1008
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:55,100
but at least, you know, they have the mold, so that saves them some time, I guess.

1009
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,460
True. If they didn't destroy those.

1010
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,740
No, they don't destroy that stuff.

1011
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:04,100
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I mean, you can still play the Mario set with it.

1012
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,180
You know, true.

1013
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:09,060
You can make Mario versus Sonic happen in your imagination, in your house

1014
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:11,260
with the dueling Lego sets.

1015
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:15,540
Except Mario is going to be super huge compared to, you know, Sonic the Hedgehog.

1016
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:19,460
Sonic is minifig size and Mario is much larger than that.

1017
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:22,420
So I'm sure your imagination can make up the difference.

1018
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,940
I have no imagination.

1019
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,460
Sizes must be accurate.

1020
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:28,980
I don't know. We'll see.

1021
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,500
Yeah, I'm with Orange, right?

1022
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,620
Mario just ate a mega mushroom. That's all.

1023
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,540
All right. All right.

1024
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:38,820
But Sonic goes fast. All right.

1025
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:41,700
Let's move on and talk about a PlayStation 5 game

1026
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:45,540
that's getting a surprising kind of little change here before it's out.

1027
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:51,420
Destruction All-Stars has actually I'm sorry, it just recently released.

1028
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,740
I didn't realize this actually came out.

1029
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:56,460
Destruction All-Stars, the developer behind the game, Lucid Games,

1030
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:01,340
has put out an update for the game and it disables voice chat by default.

1031
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:07,540
In a tweet, they wrote, Lucid Games put All-Stars Hotfix 1.2.2 is live.

1032
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,900
Hotfix note threads disabled multiplayer lobby voice communications

1033
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,020
by default for all players.

1034
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:16,900
We are actively working on longer term enhancements

1035
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,940
to the voice communication system.

1036
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:22,180
So apparently the way it was before

1037
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:27,140
voice was on by default and it wasn't exactly easy to just mute everybody.

1038
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:31,700
You had to go into your PlayStation 5 menu and disable voice chat there.

1039
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:35,220
Otherwise, it would because even if you turned it off for your headset,

1040
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:39,020
you would still get voices through the DualSense controller speaker.

1041
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:43,980
And I'm sure there were no problems at all.

1042
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:46,340
Are you saying people were saying naughty words through that?

1043
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:49,660
You mean if you put a microphone and no accountability in front of somebody,

1044
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:52,260
they're going to say some really shitty things you don't say.

1045
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:54,940
But it wasn't just that.

1046
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,500
But a lot of people don't even know that, like,

1047
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,860
the DualSense has like a mic thing built in.

1048
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:03,500
So some people didn't even know that they were transmitting.

1049
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:06,020
So they would get background noise

1050
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:09,540
that would come through, like the shifting around to the controller or the,

1051
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:13,660
you know, you know, have you ever played like Mario Kart online or something?

1052
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:15,860
And somebody blue shells you and you're like, fuck that guy.

1053
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:20,180
And if you don't know that you're muted, it's going to come or not muted.

1054
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:21,860
It's going to come through. Right.

1055
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:25,260
Or the or here's here's the classic one, too.

1056
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:29,260
You're playing a game and you're getting your ass kicked by somebody online.

1057
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,580
And then all of a sudden you just hear coming through the speaker.

1058
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:37,140
Mom, mom, I want the pizza rolls, mom.

1059
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:42,700
Right. And again, somebody doesn't know

1060
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:45,780
that their voice is being transmitted through the speaker.

1061
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:49,980
So now you just found out you're getting your butt kicked by a little kid

1062
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:53,940
who's waiting on pizza rolls.

1063
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:58,700
However, unfortunately, the really shitty stuff online

1064
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:03,100
was also making its way through a review on Ars Technica of the game

1065
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:09,180
actually called out obscenities, racist slurs and an alt right podcast

1066
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:13,140
featuring dark web and QAnon content that was played on replay,

1067
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:17,380
because that's what you want to hear when you're trying to do your escapism.

1068
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,580
Video games, I'm so sure.

1069
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:23,780
So they they removed voice chat by default.

1070
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:27,860
And actually, in this day and age, that's what most games do.

1071
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,740
So it's a little surprising they didn't do that that way to start.

1072
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,100
It's a very tough lesson to learn.

1073
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:37,060
But I will tell you what, I don't voice chat on games, period,

1074
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:40,620
unless I am playing a private game with people I know. That's it.

1075
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:43,900
And then even then, it's usually not through the game.

1076
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:47,660
It's usually through Discord, like just to make sure it's even

1077
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:50,540
under a separate set up and because you never know.

1078
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:52,220
Like it might be a PvP thing.

1079
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:55,140
You don't even want your voice going over to the other team. So

1080
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:59,260
see a Tiberian chat saying of my yelling.

1081
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:01,860
I thought that was toad. It might have been.

1082
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:05,300
It very well might have been.

1083
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:08,020
All right. Moving on, Loki,

1084
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:10,860
you got a story on something I'm very excited about.

1085
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,500
You're excited about corrupted source code,

1086
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,940
so you're not going to be able to get some of the DLC from Mass Effect.

1087
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,860
That's a weird thing to be excited about.

1088
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:20,420
I'm not that. All right. Shut up. Shut up.

1089
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:24,900
But yeah, unfortunately, that tends to happen sometimes.

1090
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:28,500
You know, you have something you want to re-release in like a 4K

1091
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:33,580
legendary edition, you go back and up the source codes corrupted. Oh, no.

1092
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:39,060
So apparently there is going to be some DLC missing.

1093
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:42,140
So Pinnacle Station,

1094
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:46,620
which I guess is the third of the Citadel DLC.

1095
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:52,100
And I'm not sure, are they going to try to remake it?

1096
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:56,100
Maybe not. No, it's Citadel's different.

1097
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,380
Citadel's different DLC for part three.

1098
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:01,020
Pinnacle Station was the third, I think,

1099
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:03,740
DLC that they did for the first game.

1100
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:10,260
And honestly, like, you know, some of the hardcore fans and stuff are like,

1101
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:11,820
oh, it's a good.

1102
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:14,820
But I'm like, honestly, there's so much fucking content.

1103
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:16,620
You're not missing that much.

1104
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,100
Like, calm down.

1105
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:19,420
You're getting more.

1106
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:22,300
You're getting more than the Wii U players got, OK?

1107
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,860
The Wii U players for Mass Effect 3 got the first DLC

1108
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:27,940
and then the entire development.

1109
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:29,460
Fuck it. We're not doing the rest of it.

1110
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:32,620
So I couldn't reverse engineer some of that stuff.

1111
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:33,700
Maybe just don't want to.

1112
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,660
But yeah, the reason why that this is not necessarily

1113
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:41,140
something that's recoverable versus some of the other stuff is because it was based

1114
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:44,500
or wasn't actually developed in the house by Bioware.

1115
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:47,060
But is actually outsourced to demurge studios.

1116
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:51,580
And I guess they don't have the original files

1117
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:53,860
that are in an uncorrupted state.

1118
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:56,660
So that's unfortunate.

1119
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:59,420
But they said that, you know, they could bring it back.

1120
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:03,060
But it'd take another six months just to do this with most of the team

1121
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:03,700
that we've got.

1122
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:07,220
And I wish we could do it, but we're not going to be able to.

1123
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:10,780
So there's going to be so much like I'm telling you, those games take

1124
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:13,940
like 30 to 40 hours to get through just the base content.

1125
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,260
And you're getting three of them.

1126
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:17,900
And then they're going to be adding a lot of DLC

1127
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,820
that can be like six or seven hours on their own.

1128
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:24,060
Like there's several of them for part two and three.

1129
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:26,180
You're going to have plenty of content for these games.

1130
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:29,660
Don't worry about this one little piece that's missing.

1131
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:33,380
And I'm with She-Hulk in our chat who says Mass Effect one is going to be fun.

1132
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:35,020
Anyway, they're doing a lot.

1133
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:38,140
I mean, they have gone back and changed a lot with one there.

1134
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:41,340
The interface looks a lot more like two and three now.

1135
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,500
Like they totally changed the interface.

1136
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,580
They've obviously gone back and done some of the graphics.

1137
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,860
There's some controversy around what they've done with some of the graphics.

1138
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:52,380
Some people did not like the look that Eden Prime had

1139
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,980
because it kind of changed the vibe a little bit on the planet.

1140
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:59,060
I'm I want to you know, we've had such a short trailer.

1141
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:01,300
I'm taking much more of a wait and see approach.

1142
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:04,380
And my honest response to a lot of the people that are criticizing

1143
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:07,500
that is like you are free to, you know, have your criticisms,

1144
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,660
but you're going to buy the game anyway.

1145
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,540
Don't act like you're not going to.

1146
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:13,860
Like if you are that level of fan

1147
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:17,020
where you're criticizing those sorts of things, I'm like, don't kid yourself.

1148
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:18,900
You're going to buy the game.

1149
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:22,020
And then at least once you've kind of actually like played through

1150
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:23,780
the whole thing outside of just the trailer,

1151
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:26,100
then you can kind of formulate your long term opinion.

1152
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:29,060
And either you didn't like it or you didn't or you liked it or you didn't,

1153
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:31,420
you know? Yeah, so.

1154
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:36,660
But I'm sure you all want to know, since I've effectively bought Mass Effect

1155
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:43,100
3 on the PC, the Xbox 360, the PlayStation 3 and the Wii U,

1156
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:44,820
I even bought the Wii U version when it was on sale.

1157
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:48,780
Will I be buying Mass Effect 3 a fifth time through this?

1158
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:51,660
And the answer is, of course, I will be.

1159
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:54,300
Of course, I will be picking this up.

1160
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,060
I haven't decided yet, though.

1161
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:59,540
I think I'm going to get it on Series X.

1162
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:03,900
But there's a part of my brain that thinks I might finally buy

1163
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,180
into PlayStation five before then.

1164
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:10,500
And if I do, I might get it on PlayStation five only because

1165
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:17,940
the inevitable day that this goes over to play and thus Microsoft Game Pass,

1166
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:24,380
I will then have it a sixth time if I buy it on the PlayStation first.

1167
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,500
But that's only if I get a PlayStation five,

1168
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:29,340
which I actually don't think I'm going to be able to do by the time this is out.

1169
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:33,460
So I will probably realistically end up getting it on my Series X.

1170
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:34,740
So.

1171
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:37,220
There is that.

1172
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:41,460
SSG100 Matt in chat says, Rob, smart thinking, diversifying.

1173
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:44,460
I know I got to think I got to think about how can I own this

1174
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:46,780
in as many places as possible?

1175
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:48,860
All right. Moving on.

1176
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:51,140
Loki, what else you have for us?

1177
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:53,780
So apparently Activision has been accused

1178
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:58,580
of stealing the concept for a Call of Duty character.

1179
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:00,980
So there's this character

1180
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:06,380
that was created called K Janice, who was part of a film pitch.

1181
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:13,220
And apparently somehow they got Activision

1182
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:17,380
got a hold of this character, figured out, you know, the likeness of this.

1183
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:20,780
And they decided to use it in a Call of Duty game.

1184
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:25,020
And they went to such extents to actually use

1185
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:29,340
the same photographer that they use for this pitch for a movie,

1186
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:33,300
use the same makeup artist, the same person

1187
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:36,260
that was in those photography sessions as well.

1188
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:41,300
And basically almost the same design for hair and costume.

1189
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:47,740
But allegedly, you know, very they didn't steal anything.

1190
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:49,820
But apparently this

1191
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:53,220
the original guy that pitched this

1192
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:57,500
to the movie studio actually had copyrighted his story

1193
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:02,140
and characters back in 2012 and 2012, 2013.

1194
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:06,940
But the photography and the photographs were a little bit more recent in 2020.

1195
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:10,740
But still, I mean, it it's hard to say, like, I mean,

1196
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:14,060
because a lot of this is just the person that they have playing this part,

1197
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:17,540
which is actually a streamer by the name of Alex Ziedra.

1198
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:21,180
But I don't know.

1199
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:24,740
At the same time, that's kind of like.

1200
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:29,540
It's it's awfully close, like I get it, if it's based off the same person,

1201
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:31,940
but like they look pretty identical.

1202
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:36,100
I mean, because it's the same person, but I don't know.

1203
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:38,900
So anyways, that's a lawsuit that we're going to hear about for a while, I guess.

1204
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:42,540
Until they settle out of court and then we don't get any of the details,

1205
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,660
because when they settle out of court, we never get the details.

1206
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:47,740
That's just the way it goes. Yes. Yeah. All right.

1207
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:51,460
Well, I know nothing about the character.

1208
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:53,820
I have nothing to say about this because I really don't know.

1209
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:56,420
So, look, I kind of have to go with your opinion if you think it's

1210
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:59,460
if there's any merit to this or not, or if it's a little more.

1211
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:02,380
It's hard to say because all they're they're showing like photographs

1212
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:04,540
with like the promotional materials,

1213
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:07,940
which basically looks like a photograph of the same person.

1214
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:12,140
But I mean, they're dressed up in a very similar like military fatigues

1215
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:16,500
and everything, the same like loadout and the same hair and everything, which is

1216
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,620
like if it's the same person, I get that.

1217
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:22,660
But the same hair and makeup and the same kind of outfit,

1218
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:24,460
that's a little questionable.

1219
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:30,020
I don't know. It just especially if if they allegedly use those

1220
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:33,820
original photographs as kind of a base to build the character off of

1221
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:38,860
and like modeled off of that, that is also questionable. All right.

1222
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:42,620
Well, let's move on and talk about another story here

1223
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:45,020
before we get to the classic game of the week.

1224
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,700
And this has to do with the delay for an older game

1225
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:50,940
that was being remade, but apparently ran into some problems.

1226
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:54,300
I'm talking, of course, about Prince of Persia, The Sands of Time.

1227
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:59,300
If you weren't already aware, they are remaking this game for current consoles,

1228
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:03,940
and they've decided to bump it back a little bit, saying in a statement,

1229
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:06,780
we have made the decision to shift the release for Prince of Persia,

1230
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:10,300
The Sands of Time, Sands of Time remake to a later date.

1231
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:14,060
This extra development time will enable our teams to deliver a remake

1232
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:17,100
that feels fresh while remaining faithful to the original.

1233
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:20,980
It should be noted they don't give a target window in this update,

1234
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:23,420
which is fine because they probably don't know it yet,

1235
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:26,060
especially with everything pandemic going on right now.

1236
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,020
They probably have no idea how long it's going to take

1237
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:31,100
to fix some of the issues that they have been having.

1238
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:34,180
And apparently some folks were kind of in some of the like pre footage

1239
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:36,460
and stuff where we're seeing that there were some issues.

1240
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:39,660
So it sounds like they've definitely made the right call here and bumping it back.

1241
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:42,860
It'll be interesting to see, like, is this what is this mean a holiday?

1242
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:44,260
Does this mean like a year?

1243
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:46,820
How long is it going to be? Who knows?

1244
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:48,620
So, by the way, it should also be noted.

1245
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:51,940
We just like we just talked about this game getting delayed not that long ago.

1246
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:54,420
It was supposed to originally come out in January.

1247
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:56,420
Then they delayed it back to March.

1248
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:59,100
Now they're delaying it. Tell who knows when.

1249
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:02,540
So this game will be out for PlayStation 4, Xbox

1250
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:09,020
one and PC via Epic Games Store and Ubisoft's own Uplay when it does come out.

1251
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:12,140
So we will see the original, of course, came out in 2003.

1252
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:16,180
Who knows? Maybe recent spotlights on buggy games that have come out,

1253
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:18,100
scared them off, I don't know.

1254
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:19,980
But there's that.

1255
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:23,380
SG100Matt in our chat says, whatever, get it done when it's done.

1256
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:27,220
Sands of Time was a great game and messing up this remake would suck.

1257
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:30,980
Yes, I know there were some people that I know that really love

1258
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:33,060
the Prince of Persia games that were kind of saying like,

1259
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:34,980
why haven't we had a new Prince of Persia game in a while?

1260
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:38,060
So this will definitely be something to hold it over,

1261
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:41,420
but it's got to be done right or else, you know.

1262
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:45,220
People will be very upset, won't they?

1263
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:48,340
All right. Well, let's people know, of course not.

1264
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:52,620
All right, let's get to a segment then where we spotlight a game

1265
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:55,660
that is bug free, a classic game, shall we?

1266
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:00,500
All right. So now we're going to use the magic of Internet radio

1267
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:05,220
and discord and all of that to get the classic game of the week,

1268
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:08,340
where every week here on the show, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault

1269
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:12,060
to find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking this game out.

1270
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:13,620
Not that newfangled stuff.

1271
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:17,940
And I say magical because we actually have Dark Soccer here with us,

1272
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:20,180
even though she is not on the show tonight.

1273
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:22,100
Hi, Jamie, how are you?

1274
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:27,340
Well, I'm sick of the sinus infection, so we'll see once I talk to the doctor tomorrow.

1275
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:31,220
Boo, I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm glad you're able to spare a few minutes here

1276
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:36,100
before the show tonight to still walk us through the classic game of the week.

1277
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:39,540
So without further fanfare, what is the classic game of the week?

1278
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:44,420
The classic game of the week is known in America as Sorcer Stryker,

1279
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:50,260
S-O-R-C-E-R Stryker, and it's a vertically scrolling shooter game

1280
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:51,580
that came out in 1993.

1281
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:54,820
It was developed by Rising, which is now called Aiding,

1282
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:58,700
published by the Able Corp in Japan and in Europe.

1283
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:03,500
So basically, you are playing one of four bounty hunters

1284
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:06,020
who has to overthrow the goblin empire

1285
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:12,420
and reclaim a bounty that was placed on King Cadwena, a violent kingdom.

1286
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:18,300
So the series is actually the Maho Daisakusen series.

1287
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:22,020
So the first game really was known as Maho Daisakusen.

1288
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:27,540
It also includes in that trilogy Kingdom Grand Prix and Daimaho.

1289
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:31,340
It's also the first game that was made by Rising.

1290
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:38,940
So at any rate, the company was founded actually by former Naxatsoft

1291
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:42,780
and Compile staff, folks who worked on the Alest series.

1292
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,780
And we all know how great those shooters are.

1293
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:49,340
And I know Compile from, you know, Gardic and all that stuff.

1294
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:50,980
Yeah, for sure.

1295
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:54,780
Well, Compile also gave us P.O.P.O., remember?

1296
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:56,940
That's true. Great company.

1297
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:00,980
Probably every game of theirs has been a classic game at some point or another.

1298
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:02,980
Well, that remains to be seen.

1299
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:06,780
But at any rate, the game first had an arcade release.

1300
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:10,220
It came out in May 1993.

1301
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:15,460
It did later get other ports and we can talk about that a bit later.

1302
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:19,420
So at any rate, it is a science fantasy theme.

1303
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:20,980
So it's a shooter up.

1304
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:26,380
It's very similar to Spriggan, where you play one of four characters

1305
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:28,260
through six different stages.

1306
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:30,700
I just love that you're in the violent kingdom.

1307
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:35,420
And it does have different elements from other Compile shooters.

1308
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:39,340
So like, you know, the scrolling background until you reach the boss

1309
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:43,100
and all that and your different weapons, your main weapon and your sub weapon.

1310
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:47,380
And you have bombs to clean off the screen.

1311
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:50,340
But it also has some other stuff in common with M.U.S.H.A.

1312
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:55,900
where you fight different mini bosses at certain stage stages of the game.

1313
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:59,500
You have a respawn system where you immediately start where you died.

1314
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:06,460
You can get hit by an enemy or collide with stage objects to lose a life

1315
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:09,100
or lose your firepower as you go along.

1316
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:13,060
So basically, you have two loops of the game.

1317
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:15,940
You have to complete the first loop and then you start over

1318
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:19,260
and you get the true ending when you finish the second loop.

1319
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:27,260
So the plot of the game actually comes a bit more through

1320
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:29,820
its supplementary materials with it.

1321
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:34,140
So, you know, there were different

1322
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:39,100
things that were released with it that would outline a little bit more of the story.

1323
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:45,580
So anyway, a little bit more about about the development of the game.

1324
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:51,220
It was developed by a crew of about four members,

1325
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:55,780
including actually with designer Nakashima Kazuyuki

1326
01:13:56,740 --> 01:14:01,060
and the programmer of the Spriggan game, Toyama Ichi,

1327
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:08,100
Yoko Kenichi and a freelance composer, Motoyama Atsuhiro.

1328
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,060
And so they worked on this one.

1329
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:15,860
Actually, it came, Toyama was working right after the arcade

1330
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:18,460
release of both Spriggan and Spriggan Mark II.

1331
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:21,900
Those are games I might be bringing up later, too.

1332
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:25,820
And so they were they founded Rising right after that

1333
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:28,420
with the desire to make a new a new game.

1334
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:33,860
And in fact, they also had connections to Toaplan,

1335
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:36,180
you know, another game that did some amazing tutors.

1336
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:40,980
So they worked with Toaplan as the consultant.

1337
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:43,340
Toaplan was their consultant for it.

1338
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:47,220
And so the game started in development March 1992,

1339
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:49,780
and the staff was working out of the bedroom of an apartment

1340
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:52,780
using development tools provided by Toaplan.

1341
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:56,940
And it was going to start off as a Chinese martial arts

1342
01:14:57,140 --> 01:15:00,340
shooter called Hago Gekiren Saifu.

1343
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:04,620
However, it went a little bit different

1344
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:08,180
because they wanted to add worldwide appeal to it.

1345
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:10,820
And so they took things from different

1346
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:13,780
games that the others worked on.

1347
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:16,740
I mean, like I said, Musha, many of the other compile games

1348
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:20,340
and wanted to make it a little bit more fantasy,

1349
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:22,460
kind of a steampunk aesthetic to it.

1350
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:25,420
So they changed the whole kind of concept of the game

1351
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:28,420
and they developed it in an apartment. That's nuts. Yeah.

1352
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:32,820
Well, I mean, think about what people do with games now.

1353
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:34,620
Oh, yeah, no, I know, especially, you know,

1354
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:37,500
you have to remember it was a very different industry in the 90s

1355
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,900
and teams were generally smaller as well.

1356
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:41,940
But still, I mean,

1357
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:44,940
and they also did have support from Toaplan.

1358
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:47,780
So they had development tools, like really good development tools.

1359
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:53,180
So they they did some special designs

1360
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:57,220
with the ships to give them like these hand-like extremities

1361
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,540
to give them character.

1362
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:03,460
But the designs were also an experiment to see if they could give

1363
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:06,860
operability and personality to keep it from

1364
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:09,140
but have it not interfere with their hitbox.

1365
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:12,820
So, you know, they they wanted to give a sense of story.

1366
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:14,220
They wanted to be a little bit different.

1367
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:21,500
So at any rate, you know, they even tried to put in like their

1368
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,540
their muscular dude and then their little moe girl,

1369
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:28,500
you know, like an idol singer type girl, you know.

1370
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:33,180
But they didn't really have, you know, all the appeal they quite wanted,

1371
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:37,300
but they were able to get get things to where they wanted to.

1372
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:40,180
And also, some of the characters were based off of Wizardry,

1373
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:43,380
the game, the game series, Wizardry. Oh, yeah.

1374
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:46,300
So they had some difficulty

1375
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:49,140
deciding on a name.

1376
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:52,180
It was first titled Mahou Daisensou.

1377
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:56,060
And then they with a little bit more brainstorming,

1378
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:58,100
it came out as Mahou Daisakusen.

1379
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:03,660
So and that's where they, you know, kind of went through

1380
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:06,660
to produce this colorful, this vivid game.

1381
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:10,580
So it was first released into arcades by the Able Corporation

1382
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:14,340
across Europe and Japan, May 1993.

1383
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:16,540
And they used a TOA plan licensed arcade board.

1384
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:20,020
There was a CD music album out in 1994

1385
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:24,340
that was published in Japan by Shin Seisha.

1386
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:27,620
And then there was a manga adaptation.

1387
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:30,180
Remember, I said there was more material that came with it.

1388
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:34,460
The first port of the game was, of course, on the X68000,

1389
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:36,700
published by E.A. Victor.

1390
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:39,140
And that came out on December 16th, 1994,

1391
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:41,100
and had a lot of different options,

1392
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:42,860
including different MIDI support.

1393
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:45,020
Then it came out on FM Towns,

1394
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:49,340
also again by Electric Arts and Victor in February 1995.

1395
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:53,300
And it had the Redbook audio from the X68000 version,

1396
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:56,140
but it also ran at a lower frame rate

1397
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:58,300
and had missing special effects.

1398
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,820
There was a mobile phone version by EasyWeb

1399
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:03,340
that was developed by Aiding once they were no longer rising.

1400
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:07,740
And on November 2017,

1401
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:12,260
M2 released a new version of Sorcerer Striker

1402
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:16,300
as part of their M2 shot triggers for PS4.

1403
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:18,340
And it had exclusive additions,

1404
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:20,300
including an easier difficulty setting

1405
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:25,300
and two aircraft simultaneously in single player.

1406
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:31,860
As of August 1st, 1983,

1407
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:33,740
in Japan, Game Machine listed

1408
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:36,380
as their seventh most popular arcade game at the time.

1409
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:41,140
There were plenty of comparisons with Truxton made.

1410
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:44,860
The X68000 version had a lot of positive reception.

1411
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:45,860
I've seen it in hand,

1412
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:48,940
and it actually is a pretty damn good version.

1413
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:52,500
A few people were like, eh, it doesn't have what Alest had.

1414
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:56,740
But, you know, different people

1415
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:58,060
have just come out on the limit,

1416
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:01,380
since this is actually one of their favorite shooter games.

1417
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:03,740
And it says it tends to be for,

1418
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:07,820
actually Kurt Kalata for Hardcore Gaming 101 said,

1419
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:08,900
it's an excellent game,

1420
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:10,460
though one that tends to be forgotten

1421
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:14,300
in favor of Rising's more innovative and ambitious titles.

1422
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:17,260
Famitsu gave the PS4 version 25 out of 40.

1423
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:19,620
We know how tough Famitsu is.

1424
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:23,900
So it is the first one in the Mahou Daisakusen trilogy.

1425
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:26,540
There was a sequel called Kingdom Grand Prix,

1426
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:28,140
came out in arcades in 84,

1427
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:33,140
and then came out on Sega Saturn by Gaga Communications.

1428
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:34,780
It's a different kind of game though.

1429
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:36,140
And then there was Daimaho,

1430
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:39,940
which was released for arcades by Capcom in 2000.

1431
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:44,940
So I actually think it's a Capcom CPS1, I wanna say.

1432
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:45,820
Don't quote me yet.

1433
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:47,140
I think it's a CPS1.

1434
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:51,060
And then the characters that were in there,

1435
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:54,060
their names are Gain, Chita, Miyamoto, and Bonem,

1436
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:57,020
are guest characters in Battle Garaga

1437
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:59,380
and Armed Police Batrider.

1438
01:19:59,380 --> 01:20:01,860
Battle Garaga is one I'm probably gonna do again

1439
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:02,700
in the future,

1440
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:05,340
because it's one of those iconic shooters.

1441
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:07,300
Now don't go spoiling it at all.

1442
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:08,940
No, I just said I might do it.

1443
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:13,000
But I mean, this game is, I've played it a couple of times.

1444
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,980
I mean, I'm not super great at shooters,

1445
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:15,820
but it's a fun one.

1446
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:20,820
I mean, it definitely has kind of that mix of compile meets,

1447
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:24,500
you know, compile shooter meets a last.

1448
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,660
So it's pretty, pretty cool.

1449
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:28,460
And it's not every day you hear about wizardry

1450
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:30,940
inspiring a shooter, that's for sure.

1451
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:32,900
Yeah, I mean, it was just a couple of characters

1452
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:35,540
that were inspired by wizardry.

1453
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:36,380
But still.

1454
01:20:36,380 --> 01:20:41,380
So, but it's, you know, it's a worthwhile game, you know,

1455
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:43,820
and hold on, I'm gonna real quick confirm

1456
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:45,940
what Daima-ho was released on.

1457
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:49,820
I wanna say that it was a CPS,

1458
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:53,720
sorry, it was a CPS2, my apologies.

1459
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:59,640
Yeah, I knew it was like an earlier though one,

1460
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:00,860
so there you go.

1461
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:04,460
I mean, even the sequels are really great games.

1462
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:09,460
I played Daima-ho before I played the first one, so.

1463
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:10,860
All right.

1464
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:12,620
Well, thank you for walking us through

1465
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:16,460
your classic game of the week, Sorcerer Striker.

1466
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:17,280
Sorcerer.

1467
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,380
Sorcerer, excuse me.

1468
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:20,720
I keep wanting to say, it's the wizardry on the brain.

1469
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:21,660
I keep wanting to say sorcerer.

1470
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:22,900
Okay, Sorcerer Striker.

1471
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:25,620
It's a magic related game, so.

1472
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:27,140
Yeah.

1473
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:29,980
All right, well, before we go back to the studio live,

1474
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:34,100
Dark Sakura, any parting words for the folks tonight?

1475
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:38,700
I would like for my sinuses to be drilled out

1476
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:41,000
and inflated so that they don't feel like my face

1477
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,740
is going to crush itself.

1478
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:43,580
That's all.

1479
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:44,900
Well, you should let your doctor know.

1480
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:45,740
All right.

1481
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:46,560
I am.

1482
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,660
Take care of Dark Sakura, we'll see you next week.

1483
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:49,660
All right, bye.

1484
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:53,740
All right, thanks to Jamie, Dark Sakura,

1485
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:55,660
for filling in there earlier today.

1486
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:57,500
So we still got to have her voice on the show this week

1487
01:21:57,540 --> 01:22:00,420
with the classic game of the week, Sorcerer Striker,

1488
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:03,740
which I have to admit, not a title I was super familiar with

1489
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:05,260
and this happens with her pick sometimes.

1490
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:06,380
I'm like, I don't remember this one.

1491
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:08,620
And I was watching chat during that segment

1492
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:10,940
and there was several people in chat kind of having it,

1493
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:13,020
like, I swear I've played something like this,

1494
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:15,180
but I don't think it was this.

1495
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,100
The closest thing I can think of is Dragon Spirit,

1496
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,940
but that's really like actually playing a dragon,

1497
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:20,660
but it would still have like that same kind of like,

1498
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:21,840
like wizardry type of thing.

1499
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,820
But I can't think of what it is that's really like this,

1500
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:26,020
but that was a good pick.

1501
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:27,480
It was fun to check out.

1502
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,440
Speaking of classics, by the way,

1503
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:34,580
Loki, sorry, Mr. Smoosh just ran right under this table here.

1504
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:35,960
You can't see it on stream.

1505
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,780
He's got a case of the zoomies right now.

1506
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:39,280
So I'm a little bit distracted.

1507
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,400
Mr. Smoosh, of course, my kitty.

1508
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:45,200
So Loki, you know how there's,

1509
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,660
I drive down J Street downtown a lot

1510
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:49,720
to refill up on my Pokeballs.

1511
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:52,080
I use Bluetooth, so I'm not trying to spin

1512
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,480
Pokestops and all that.

1513
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,720
There's that little retro gaming store.

1514
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:56,640
Have you ever seen that?

1515
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,480
It's brand new.

1516
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:58,300
They just put-

1517
01:22:58,300 --> 01:22:59,140
I know what you're talking about, yeah.

1518
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:01,720
I finally went today and to check it out.

1519
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:04,860
So, and I bought something while I was there.

1520
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:06,240
And it's, I don't know if anyone noticed,

1521
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,360
we have a new decoration in the studio.

1522
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,220
I'll try to take it down from the hook here.

1523
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:12,560
It's a little hard to see, but it's a little,

1524
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,520
it's one of those like 3D frames.

1525
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,560
If I tilt it a little bit, you can see some of the 3D,

1526
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:20,760
but you can maybe see what screen it is representing there.

1527
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,520
Hopefully you can kind of tell, sorry.

1528
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:25,200
I know it's on Twitch and sorry to the podcast folks.

1529
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,600
What's that, Loki?

1530
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:28,280
I said, that's pretty cool.

1531
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:29,100
Yeah.

1532
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:29,940
I liked this.

1533
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:30,760
It was only 20 bucks.

1534
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:32,360
So I was like, all right, I'm kind of into that.

1535
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:35,400
And of course the game, it's Castlevania is the game

1536
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:39,480
that's Simon kind of going at the Reaper there and that.

1537
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:40,620
So I thought that was really cool.

1538
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:41,680
So I picked that up.

1539
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:45,120
So yeah, little, speaking of classic games,

1540
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,760
a little trinket I picked up this week.

1541
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:49,240
So that's dangerous because they have more of them.

1542
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:52,200
There was one for Contra and there was one for Sonic.

1543
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,160
And I was like, I kind of want them all.

1544
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:55,880
I think that would be fun little decoration

1545
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,440
for the new studio whenever we get there.

1546
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:00,520
So SGO and Hunter Matt says, oh, those things are cool.

1547
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,800
See them at cons a bunch.

1548
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,280
Yeah, I think, so one thing I noticed about this place,

1549
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:06,080
they definitely don't just have games.

1550
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:09,040
They're very, they're leaning hard into like gaming culture,

1551
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:12,600
you know, hats, lamps, you know,

1552
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,520
the kind of like Game Stops have to do too,

1553
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:15,840
is, you know, you can't just make your money

1554
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:16,920
off the games alone.

1555
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:18,320
It's kind of the gaming culture stuff,

1556
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,840
but I saw this and I thought it was cute.

1557
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,920
No, I love Castlevania.

1558
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:21,760
So I had to pick that.

1559
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,520
And plus this is like my favorite stage

1560
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:25,840
and music in Castlevania.

1561
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:26,840
So it's a good pick.

1562
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:27,720
So there you go.

1563
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:31,080
Anyway, all right, let's do some rapid fire news, shall we?

1564
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,320
Where we quickly talk about some other things going on

1565
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,760
in the gaming world this week.

1566
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:36,280
Loki.

1567
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:39,840
Yes, so apparently because it's gotten a lot of attention

1568
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,440
about how tall is that very large woman or vampire

1569
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:48,000
in the new Resident Evil Village game.

1570
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:53,960
So Lady Dimitrescu, she is now officially

1571
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:59,200
according to Capcom, nine foot six.

1572
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:03,520
So if you need to, you know, need that for some reason,

1573
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,560
I don't know, but people were fawning over

1574
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:10,680
and now you know, 2.9 meters or 9.6 feet.

1575
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:13,120
Thank you, Capcom, for legitimizing all of that.

1576
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:13,960
Thanks.

1577
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:16,040
Nine foot six inches, I guess nine and a half inch

1578
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:17,240
or nine and a half feet.

1579
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:22,960
And then we have Final Fantasy XII, the Zodiac Age,

1580
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,640
finally heading to Games Pass.

1581
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:28,200
So that's gonna be coming out very soon.

1582
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,400
I don't know the exact date yet,

1583
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,560
but right around the corner.

1584
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:33,440
Oh, here we go.

1585
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,800
So it's gonna be coming out February 11th

1586
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:39,800
and along with it, Jurassic World Evolution,

1587
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:43,880
The Falconer, Project Winter, Ghosts of a Tale,

1588
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,280
Stealth Inc. 2, A Game of Clones

1589
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:48,640
and Wolfenstein Youngblood.

1590
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:52,560
So coming out early this month.

1591
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:54,560
All right.

1592
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,600
Well, I wanna talk a little bit about Ingress

1593
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:59,600
cause I play that game a little bit, as you guys know.

1594
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,320
And I don't often talk about the news and updates for this,

1595
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,360
but this one kind of also goes out to my pals

1596
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:07,500
who also play Pokemon Go, another Niantic game,

1597
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:11,040
because a lot of times where Ingress tends to go,

1598
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,760
Pokemon Go tends to follow.

1599
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,880
And I'm gonna talk about a monthly sub

1600
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,520
that they have announced that's coming to Ingress

1601
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:19,360
where you will actually be able to give them money

1602
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:22,180
on a monthly basis for some additional perks.

1603
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:24,200
I should point out though, because you guys,

1604
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:27,480
I know a lot more people play Pokemon Go than play Ingress.

1605
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:31,440
But one thing that's finally came to Ingress this week

1606
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,440
after like years of asking,

1607
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:36,220
and this has been in Pokemon Go forever.

1608
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:38,480
When you go to the, well, in Pokemon Go,

1609
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,900
you can see if you've spun a Poke Stop or not, right?

1610
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:44,000
If there's a little white ring around the Poke Stop,

1611
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,080
then you've never visited it.

1612
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:47,120
And once you spin it, then that white ring goes away,

1613
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,000
right?

1614
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,700
Well, in Ingress, there are specific achievements

1615
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:53,000
for visiting unique places and hacking stuff

1616
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:53,920
and capturing stuff.

1617
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,600
And we have never been able to see if we've ever hacked

1618
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:58,200
or captured a portal before.

1619
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:00,940
But now on the Ingress Intel Map, as of this week,

1620
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:02,760
you can actually have a display.

1621
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,480
These are portals you've hacked.

1622
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,100
These are portals you've captured

1623
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:08,760
to make the hunt for unique portals a lot easier.

1624
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,380
And they say that they are bringing this

1625
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:12,820
to the in-game client as well.

1626
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:14,760
So that is very exciting.

1627
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,120
It was really fun for me to go and look at a city

1628
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:20,000
like Chicago that I visited a couple times

1629
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,960
and I did an Ingress anomaly there years ago.

1630
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:24,080
You may remember, I've talked about it on this show.

1631
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:27,060
It was really fun to see, like, here are the parts of town

1632
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:28,880
that I hacked up and down the street.

1633
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,900
Here's the parts where I must've just done a couple hacks

1634
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:35,120
driving by in a Lyft or Uber or whatever.

1635
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,080
And here are places with tons of portals

1636
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:37,920
I didn't touch at all.

1637
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:38,960
It was kind of fun to me.

1638
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,520
I like the whole, like, here's how to track

1639
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:42,880
where I've been in the world.

1640
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,480
Anyway, I'm digressing a little bit,

1641
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:47,280
but I'm just kind of showing, like, Ingress, Pokemon Go.

1642
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:49,260
They're tied together a little bit sometimes.

1643
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:51,080
And Niantic announced this week

1644
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:53,840
that there will be a monthly subscription coming to Ingress

1645
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,820
called CORE, which stands for

1646
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:58,920
Community Offers Recognition and Expansion.

1647
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:03,920
They say that it will be $5 a month, $4.99, but $5, come on.

1648
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,240
And the rewards you will get,

1649
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:10,880
you will get a 500 slot expansion to your inventory.

1650
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,920
That's huge, let me tell you, right there.

1651
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,600
There are people that will be willing to pay it

1652
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:15,720
just for that alone,

1653
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:18,720
because your inventory is so limited in that game.

1654
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:21,720
And you are limited to 2,000 items,

1655
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:23,300
and then you have an additional five,

1656
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:24,560
what they call key lockers,

1657
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:25,800
where you can put keys to portals

1658
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,440
up to 500 of them in those lockers, 600, I think,

1659
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:29,960
actually now.

1660
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:32,320
But there's, like, your basic inventory,

1661
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:34,120
bursters and rosa, is limited to 2,000.

1662
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:35,240
You cannot expand that.

1663
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:37,980
So the fact that this is happening is a huge deal.

1664
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:40,040
You will also get a special medal,

1665
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:42,120
special code name flare, whatever.

1666
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:45,100
You get some monthly in-game currency,

1667
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:47,040
2,500 what they call CMUs,

1668
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,520
and you get a loadout kit,

1669
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,780
which I assume is gonna be, you know, some gear.

1670
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:55,180
And then you will be able to, also on the Intel map,

1671
01:28:55,180 --> 01:29:00,180
you can go and see your inventory and your portal keys.

1672
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:04,000
That's huge for planning big fields.

1673
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,440
There's gonna be some people that will love that for,

1674
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,480
oh, I've got a key to that, I got a key to that.

1675
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,760
So it's gonna be interesting.

1676
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:12,560
Five bucks a month, that's a lot.

1677
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,880
But again, I know people that,

1678
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:16,580
I will probably do it, honestly.

1679
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:17,800
I play enough of that game.

1680
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:20,780
You know, I probably play almost as much of that

1681
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:22,520
as I do something like Final Fantasy XIV,

1682
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:24,820
and I pay three times as much as Final Fantasy XIV.

1683
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:27,000
So I'll probably do it.

1684
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,200
Loki, you probably won't do it

1685
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,000
because you don't play enough Ingress, right?

1686
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,720
I don't play any Ingress, so that's a definite,

1687
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:34,840
that's a hard no.

1688
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:37,720
ActDeftInChat says,

1689
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:40,280
I do wonder if they plan to implement this for Go.

1690
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:43,000
I mean, we already pay for events in Pogo.

1691
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,440
That comment, of course, coming from our chat room.

1692
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,000
That's exactly why I brought it up.

1693
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,680
I don't think we have a lot of listeners

1694
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:49,880
who even know what Ingress is,

1695
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:52,120
but I bet there's a lot of you that do play Pokemon Go.

1696
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:54,800
And I just kind of wanted to say, oh, look at this,

1697
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:57,160
because this might be what, you know,

1698
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:59,320
again, we don't know until they make an official announcement

1699
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:01,120
but it's interesting, isn't it?

1700
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:04,320
Here's a game that admittedly I've never played

1701
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:08,360
but always comes up because it was in the release dates once

1702
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:09,320
and we couldn't stop laughing.

1703
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:11,200
It's AlpacaBall.

1704
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,160
Did you know AlpacaBall All-Stars

1705
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:14,720
is a game that's out there right now?

1706
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:16,720
Well, you can get a free update to the game

1707
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:18,520
if you're somebody that's playing this game right now.

1708
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:20,880
It is a Lunar New Year update.

1709
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,520
So you can actually get in there

1710
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:25,360
and it's a free update that's coming out February 5th.

1711
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:30,360
So it's already come out and you will get a new pitch

1712
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:35,480
and there is a new stage, I guess, called Chinatown

1713
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:37,320
that is decked out with decorations

1714
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:38,760
to welcome the Lunar New Year.

1715
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:40,560
And there is a dragon in there

1716
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:44,480
that will toss the soccer ball and the alpacas into the air,

1717
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,600
just flinging that alpaca.

1718
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:50,320
All right, so check that out if you're a fan of AlpacaBall.

1719
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:51,760
Loki, a couple more for us.

1720
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:58,920
All right, so we've got Akira Yamaoka teasing something

1721
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:03,760
that he says is gonna be announced by the summer,

1722
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:08,400
something that I'm quite sure it will be the one

1723
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:10,840
that you've been waiting for, he says.

1724
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:13,880
Oh, interesting.

1725
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:14,700
Oh, him.

1726
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,120
He just had a birthday a couple of days ago.

1727
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:20,600
Yeah, and so apparently, you know,

1728
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,080
he was like teasing something that this is part

1729
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:26,640
of an interview that he did with AI Hub.

1730
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:31,640
And since then they have pulled the interview

1731
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:35,400
by the request of an unspecified party.

1732
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:36,680
Oh, yikes.

1733
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:39,840
Okay, hmm, the plot thickens.

1734
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:43,000
I guess we'll wait and see what that might mean.

1735
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,440
All right, let's not get too excited, but maybe a little.

1736
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:50,040
Yeah, I can think of at least one franchise

1737
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:51,000
he's involved with.

1738
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:54,240
All right, and of course, if you're not already aware,

1739
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,600
Silent Hill is what we're talking about,

1740
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:58,320
but let's not set our expectations too high

1741
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,360
because that's only gonna lead to disappointment.

1742
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:03,380
Yeah. Yeah, and what else?

1743
01:32:03,380 --> 01:32:05,940
And then we've got a,

1744
01:32:07,740 --> 01:32:12,740
this Bimani piano game, Nostalgia, is now on PC.

1745
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:14,620
So you can check that out.

1746
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:18,180
It's, I don't know, I guess it's part

1747
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:21,020
of the economy amusement game station platform

1748
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:22,140
that they have.

1749
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:25,060
So it apparently is also going to support

1750
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:26,980
MIDI keyboards as well.

1751
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:27,820
Oh, cool.

1752
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:30,540
And you can play it, of course, like anything else

1753
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:34,460
that's on there with a basic core subscription

1754
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:39,460
of 1,628 yen a month or about 1,550.

1755
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:44,300
And you'll have access to every piece of content

1756
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:45,820
in the game.

1757
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:48,940
So I am not familiar with this game,

1758
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:52,320
but I mean, it looks like keyboard mania.

1759
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:53,620
It's come up on the show before

1760
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:56,180
and I think I've seen, it looks like a lot of fun.

1761
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:58,620
Again, I'm kind of waiting to see

1762
01:32:58,620 --> 01:33:03,420
if they will put out an official English support translation

1763
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:06,260
and localized support for the game.

1764
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:07,400
But I think it's really cool.

1765
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,300
It's neat that Bimani's still kind of kicking

1766
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:10,700
in these different ways.

1767
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:12,340
So.

1768
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:14,980
Yeah, I'm surprised we haven't heard anything else of like,

1769
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:16,460
because I know that you were doing the alpha test

1770
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:18,300
for like Dance Dance Revolution

1771
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:21,260
and then they have like 2DX and all that stuff.

1772
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:22,100
I'm wondering.

1773
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:26,220
Well, the pandemic happens and it's probably coming into it.

1774
01:33:26,220 --> 01:33:27,960
Yeah, I guess.

1775
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:29,120
For DDR anyway.

1776
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:30,520
All right.

1777
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:31,640
Let's travel around the world

1778
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:33,120
and check out some release dates

1779
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,160
and some games that are coming out very soon.

1780
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:37,320
I know we at least have one big one in the US this week.

1781
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:38,640
Right, Loki?

1782
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:39,480
Yeah.

1783
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:40,320
So we've got a,

1784
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,360
it looks like Def Crown coming out of Nintendo Switch,

1785
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,520
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

1786
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:46,640
Little Nightmares II on PC,

1787
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:50,040
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

1788
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:53,600
Galgun Returns on PC and Nintendo Switch,

1789
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,640
Super Mario 3D World,

1790
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:58,960
plus Bowser's Fury on Nintendo Switch.

1791
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:03,960
And then we've got the three that we're releasing this week,

1792
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:08,600
Pixel Poops, Pixel Poops 64 and Pixel Poops number two.

1793
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:13,120
PC, Commodore 64 and NES for those.

1794
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:16,840
How convenient that that's on the list.

1795
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:17,680
I love that.

1796
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:19,080
It's on there.

1797
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:22,880
Like, I mean, Wikipedia had it, so it must be official.

1798
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:26,520
Is that Mario 3D Worlds this week, isn't it?

1799
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:27,360
Yes, it is.

1800
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:28,200
Oh, I missed it.

1801
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:29,040
Sorry.

1802
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,560
It's on Friday, 3D World plus Bowser's Fury.

1803
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:32,400
All right.

1804
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,240
I know I'm picking that one up.

1805
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:34,520
So I'm excited about that.

1806
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:35,360
All right.

1807
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:36,200
Let's travel over to Japan

1808
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:38,800
and check out what's coming out over there in Japan.

1809
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:40,960
Of course, Super Mario 3D World and Bowser's Fury

1810
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:42,920
also out in Japan this week on the 12th.

1811
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:44,840
That's kind of a worldwide release,

1812
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:46,960
which I'm sure doesn't surprise anyone.

1813
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:47,800
That is out on the Switch.

1814
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:50,680
And then a Fate Xstella celebration.

1815
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:53,800
Switch and then a Fate Xstella celebration box

1816
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:56,600
for the Switch is also out on the 11th this week.

1817
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,560
And those are pretty much your big releases on the Switch.

1818
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:01,640
Checking the PlayStation 5.

1819
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:04,040
No, there's a third party putting out a headset,

1820
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:06,280
but we don't get any new games until next week.

1821
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:08,480
We get a new game on PlayStation 5.

1822
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:10,200
PlayStation 4 does have

1823
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:12,600
that same Fate Xstella celebration box

1824
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:14,240
that I talked about on the Switch.

1825
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:18,200
Otherwise, Little Nightmares II is coming out over there.

1826
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:19,560
So you can check that out.

1827
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:21,440
And that's it for Japanese releases.

1828
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:24,760
How about the UK, Loki, with Dark Sakura out tonight?

1829
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:27,040
We have Little Nightmares II coming out

1830
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:31,320
on PlayStation 5 and 4.

1831
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:35,280
And it looks like Xbox One and Switch and PC.

1832
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:39,240
We've got Evoland on PlayStation 4.

1833
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:43,160
Eternam EX on Switch.

1834
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:46,160
We have Dex on Switch.

1835
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:47,640
And then they're getting also

1836
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:52,640
the Mario Red and Blue Edition Switch bundle

1837
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:55,960
and accessories.

1838
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:59,520
So that's gonna be bundled with that Super Mario 3D World.

1839
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:04,520
And we've got Galgun Returns on Nintendo Switch.

1840
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:09,080
They're also doing the standalone Super Mario 3D World

1841
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:11,320
and Bowser's Fury as well.

1842
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:12,880
And that's it.

1843
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,000
All right.

1844
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,840
We've got a few more stories for you guys.

1845
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:19,040
And then we're gonna get to your questions in our chat room

1846
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:19,920
as well as your emails.

1847
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,000
We have a couple of emails tonight.

1848
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,440
So we'll get to those shortly.

1849
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:25,440
But first, some more stories for you.

1850
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:29,160
Loki, this game that just will not leave the news.

1851
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:31,480
Every week, it's something.

1852
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:33,280
And you thought mods were problems

1853
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:36,160
when they were romancing Keanu Reeves.

1854
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:38,400
But now, apparently all mods are problems

1855
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:42,440
because come to find out,

1856
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:44,840
in Cyberpunk, specifically.

1857
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:46,520
Yes, in Cyberpunk.

1858
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:51,160
There's a security exploit apparently in Cyberpunk

1859
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:53,200
when they added mod support.

1860
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:54,480
So they're saying,

1861
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:58,560
hey, be cautious because we have been made aware

1862
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:02,400
that there is a vulnerability allows external DLL files

1863
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:06,760
and in the game or vulnerability and external DLL files

1864
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:11,160
the game uses, which can be used to execute code on PCs.

1865
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:16,320
This is gonna be patch ASAP, but for now be cautious.

1866
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:21,320
However, it has been patched as of Friday, so that is good.

1867
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:23,960
But just be aware that this stuff

1868
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:28,960
kind of pops up once in a while and it is Cyberpunk.

1869
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:31,200
So I mean, they're still working on it.

1870
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,640
Still trying to make sure the game works for everybody.

1871
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:35,920
Exactly.

1872
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:38,440
All right, well, this news came out this week

1873
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:40,320
and it's disappointing to some individuals.

1874
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:42,880
Although I have to say it's not incredibly surprising,

1875
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:45,000
but Blizzard has basically confirmed

1876
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,440
that Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4

1877
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:49,320
will not be happening this year.

1878
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:51,680
Which is interesting because they're doing

1879
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:55,560
their own type of like online BlizzCon soon.

1880
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:57,320
I think it's in the next couple of weeks.

1881
01:37:57,320 --> 01:37:59,120
I don't remember the exact day,

1882
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:00,280
but I think it's coming up real soon.

1883
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:01,280
It might even be this week.

1884
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:02,560
I just forget.

1885
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,840
If somebody in chat knows, let me know.

1886
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:08,640
But this news came out during a earnings call.

1887
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:11,240
So they did their fourth quarter 2020 earnings call.

1888
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:15,320
And they basically said that Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2

1889
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:17,120
are not gonna be happening right now.

1890
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:19,960
I think some folks thought that maybe Diablo 4

1891
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:22,760
might make this year or even maybe Overwatch 2

1892
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:25,920
because it seems to build a lot on Overwatch 1.

1893
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:27,720
So it might be a little bit surprising.

1894
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:32,680
Again, knowing that Blizzard is headquartered in California

1895
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:37,200
and California has had a lot of the stringent shutdown laws

1896
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:41,520
and the fact that working from home

1897
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:43,280
has probably put some bumps in the road,

1898
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:46,040
I'm not incredibly surprised.

1899
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:49,320
But it does leave me wondering what Blizzard plans

1900
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:52,320
to hype up or what they have coming this year.

1901
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:56,640
My concern is it's that Diablo phone game.

1902
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:59,360
Although everybody I've heard that's tried it

1903
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:01,160
says it's not bad.

1904
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:02,800
Like a lot of people are writing it off

1905
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,000
because it's a mobile phone game,

1906
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,920
but it actually is a pretty decent Diablo game.

1907
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:09,880
I wanna try it for myself before I really know

1908
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:12,480
because that's coming from fanboys at the fair.

1909
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:16,400
But that must be a thing for this year.

1910
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:19,800
But again, after what happened a couple of Blizzcons ago,

1911
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,480
with that being the key announcement,

1912
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:23,960
I can't believe that that would be their key announcement

1913
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:24,800
for this year.

1914
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:28,680
Now we've had the rumors about Diablo 2 getting remastered.

1915
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:30,920
Remember that whole thing where they picked up

1916
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:32,800
the studio back East and everything.

1917
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:35,920
So maybe that's the thing they're gonna lean on this year.

1918
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:38,400
Maybe that's something they can get done a little faster.

1919
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:39,240
I don't know.

1920
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:40,240
Anyway, oh, I found the dates for the event.

1921
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:42,040
It's February 19th and 20th.

1922
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:44,480
So it is this month, it's coming up pretty soon.

1923
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:47,480
So there you go, that's happening.

1924
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:51,400
So we'll see if they decide to give them a better date then.

1925
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:53,240
But for right now in their earnings report,

1926
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:55,360
they said we are making significant progress

1927
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:56,880
against our development pipeline

1928
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:59,120
for other key intellectual properties,

1929
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:03,140
which we expect to fuel further growth in 2022 and beyond.

1930
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:07,180
Well, we'll see what they've got.

1931
01:40:07,180 --> 01:40:09,060
All right, moving on.

1932
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:11,180
Loki to something we never got.

1933
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:15,940
Yes, so there is a prototype of DuckTales

1934
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:17,140
that has been found.

1935
01:40:17,140 --> 01:40:20,260
And one of the things that was discovered in the game,

1936
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:25,260
which is a unused soundtrack or yeah,

1937
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,700
unused song from the game

1938
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:29,620
that was originally supposed to be intended

1939
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:33,220
for the map screen, but they cut it out.

1940
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:35,860
So that was kind of cool that we got to hear that.

1941
01:40:35,860 --> 01:40:36,700
Yeah.

1942
01:40:37,540 --> 01:40:39,780
Yeah, and so this prototype was from,

1943
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:42,740
looks like February 5th, 1989.

1944
01:40:42,740 --> 01:40:46,400
Wow, 22 years ago.

1945
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,300
No, I can't math today.

1946
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:50,000
That would be 32 years ago.

1947
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:52,160
Wow, yeah.

1948
01:40:53,820 --> 01:40:58,340
So that's pretty neat that they have that available

1949
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:00,580
to hear what might've been.

1950
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:02,820
Wasn't as good as some of the other music in the game,

1951
01:41:02,820 --> 01:41:04,840
but it was still neat to hear it.

1952
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:07,820
Yeah, it's almost, I love the site

1953
01:41:07,820 --> 01:41:09,880
that gets all the prototypes

1954
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:11,420
and all the differences and things.

1955
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:13,680
It's so neat to see the stuff that changed

1956
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:15,780
for whatever reason and just to kind of theorize

1957
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:17,160
like why would they have changed this

1958
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:18,380
or done this a little differently?

1959
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:20,900
And like you said, maybe they just didn't receive

1960
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:22,540
the map song as well internally.

1961
01:41:22,540 --> 01:41:25,260
So they decided to put a different song in instead.

1962
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:28,900
So, dark to see in chat says over at twitch.tv

1963
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:30,060
slash vog network.

1964
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:31,580
I definitely recommend looking up

1965
01:41:31,580 --> 01:41:33,740
the alternative Transylvania music.

1966
01:41:33,740 --> 01:41:36,340
I almost like it more than the one we got.

1967
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:40,580
So yeah, art is all in the eye of the beholder.

1968
01:41:40,580 --> 01:41:42,180
So cool, I'll have to check.

1969
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:43,180
I haven't heard the song yet,

1970
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:44,940
so I'll have to check it out after the show.

1971
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:47,880
So, all right, well, meanwhile, another story from Loki.

1972
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:52,160
Yeah, and then I think we talked a little bit

1973
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:56,600
about how Valve is gonna be getting the receiving end

1974
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:59,560
of a lawsuit regarding patent infringement

1975
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:00,400
with their controller.

1976
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:04,400
Well, they have now been fined over 4 million

1977
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:07,240
for that patent infringement.

1978
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:12,080
This is coming from the, let's see,

1979
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:16,640
the company was Scuf, I guess, or S-C-U-F,

1980
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:20,320
and they're owned now by Corsair.

1981
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:25,320
So they apparently, they found that they did impede

1982
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:30,940
on their patent and now they owe them that kind of money.

1983
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,080
Yeah, I mean, I'm kind of surprised,

1984
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:39,280
but just kind of sucks for Valve.

1985
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:41,080
They can't catch a break with anything,

1986
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,600
any of the brick rules that they're releasing,

1987
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:45,400
but I don't know, what are you gonna do?

1988
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,040
At least it's not being produced anymore.

1989
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:50,560
So, keep the damages to a minimum.

1990
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:53,120
Well, one thing they could do is show up to court,

1991
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:57,960
although that was a different case, but still, still.

1992
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:00,960
All right, ending on a bit of a downer tonight, sorry,

1993
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,980
but it should definitely be brought up

1994
01:43:02,980 --> 01:43:05,140
because unfortunately we lost somebody this week

1995
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:09,160
who is huge in gaming culture, and that is Robert A. Altman,

1996
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:12,560
who is the co-founder and CEO of ZeniMax.

1997
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:16,080
Bethesda in a statement saying he was a true visionary friend

1998
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:17,720
and believer in the spirit of people

1999
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:19,800
and the power of what they could accomplish together.

2000
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,440
He was an extraordinary leader

2001
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:23,720
and an even better human being.

2002
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:25,800
There's a lot of stuff on Twitter,

2003
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,880
a lot of people talking about their reflections

2004
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:30,400
on having met Robert Altman and so forth

2005
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:32,400
and some of the things he kind of did with the company.

2006
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,800
I even know a couple of people that work over there

2007
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,080
and we're talking about some of the things

2008
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:38,540
that he did with the company and so forth.

2009
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:42,640
And it's sad, and obviously a lot of folks that work there

2010
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:45,600
are kind of mourning this.

2011
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:49,440
This is, I did not catch that there was a reason,

2012
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:51,320
not that it's any of our business,

2013
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:52,920
but I know in the year 2021,

2014
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:55,480
a lot of people want to know, is it COVID?

2015
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:58,720
I don't know, and I don't know how much notice they had

2016
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:01,040
that if he was sick for a while or something like that,

2017
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:04,280
but the reality is that unfortunately he's passed away

2018
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:07,560
and now somebody else will become the CEO of Bethesda

2019
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:09,120
when the board meets next.

2020
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:11,600
So if you do want more information,

2021
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:15,100
including there's a nice little letter from his son

2022
01:44:15,460 --> 01:44:18,100
that is available, twitter.com slash Bethesda,

2023
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:20,460
and there are some tweets from February 4th

2024
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:21,820
when this occurred.

2025
01:44:21,820 --> 01:44:23,340
So you can check that out.

2026
01:44:24,580 --> 01:44:25,400
All right.

2027
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:29,700
Ooh, SH100Matt bringing it back to a happier note.

2028
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:31,380
We'll kind of start our listener round table with this

2029
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:34,580
cause I can't believe I forgot to include this tonight.

2030
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:37,500
Meanwhile, the data miners finding the original code

2031
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:40,620
for the Super Mario Brothers Super Mario World soundtrack

2032
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:44,020
and folks recreating it in its uncompressed form

2033
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:45,500
sounds really cool.

2034
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:47,980
Yeah, I wish I'd prepped that to play on the show tonight.

2035
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:50,100
Sorry guys, but check it out on YouTube.

2036
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:52,140
I tweeted about it a few days ago.

2037
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:53,340
Loki, did you hear these?

2038
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:54,340
It was-

2039
01:44:54,340 --> 01:44:56,060
I did, and it was probably a good thing

2040
01:44:56,060 --> 01:44:57,740
that we didn't play any of that.

2041
01:44:58,820 --> 01:44:59,660
I liked it.

2042
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:00,580
It was, oh yeah, you're right.

2043
01:45:00,580 --> 01:45:01,660
We might get shut down or something.

2044
01:45:01,660 --> 01:45:02,500
Yeah, you're right.

2045
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:04,460
Cease and desist, happy and all that, you're right.

2046
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:06,020
So we probably shouldn't play it, but still,

2047
01:45:06,020 --> 01:45:07,940
I can still tell you to go seek it out on YouTube

2048
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:09,260
cause I believe it's still up there.

2049
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:10,540
So basically what they did,

2050
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:13,420
they found the uncompressed samples

2051
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:15,300
before they went into the cartridge.

2052
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:17,220
And then obviously you have to compress stuff down a lot

2053
01:45:17,220 --> 01:45:19,660
to fit into 16-bit cartridge, right?

2054
01:45:19,660 --> 01:45:22,060
So the song sounded one way to us

2055
01:45:22,060 --> 01:45:23,660
because we heard the compressed audio,

2056
01:45:23,660 --> 01:45:27,340
but somebody rebuilt the music with the uncompressed audio

2057
01:45:27,340 --> 01:45:29,420
and it sounds different because they don't,

2058
01:45:29,420 --> 01:45:31,980
it doesn't sound so like tin can, I guess,

2059
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:34,460
because it's compressed and it's really different.

2060
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:36,420
So you should really check that out.

2061
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:39,420
And SSJ100Matt's given you a convenient link in the chat

2062
01:45:39,460 --> 01:45:41,660
there for those that are listening live.

2063
01:45:41,660 --> 01:45:43,940
For those that are on the podcast,

2064
01:45:43,940 --> 01:45:45,340
I would just encourage you to go to YouTube

2065
01:45:45,340 --> 01:45:48,940
and look for, you know, Super Mario Brothers Uncompressed

2066
01:45:48,940 --> 01:45:50,860
or look for it on Google News

2067
01:45:50,860 --> 01:45:52,260
cause a lot of sites were covering this

2068
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:54,620
cause it's very much like, wow,

2069
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:56,140
like difference with the sound.

2070
01:45:56,140 --> 01:45:58,700
I don't know if, yeah, it's pretty cool.

2071
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:00,380
Oh yeah, ACT-F points out it's on Discord.

2072
01:46:00,380 --> 01:46:01,500
Thank you, you're right.

2073
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:03,740
Somebody posted a tweet and it wasn't my tweet,

2074
01:46:03,740 --> 01:46:05,860
somebody else's tweet over in Discord.

2075
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:08,220
So a good cheap plug for our Discord

2076
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:10,500
if you wanna join us over at vognetwork.com,

2077
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:13,660
vognetwork.com slash Discord.

2078
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:15,600
Dr. Tsuya is saying I saw something similar

2079
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:17,620
for the Donkey Kong Country OST.

2080
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:19,220
I think I remember seeing that too.

2081
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:20,220
That was pretty wild.

2082
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:23,500
All right, before we get to last minute stories

2083
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:25,860
or any further questions, let's get to the mailbag.

2084
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:27,620
We have a couple of emails tonight.

2085
01:46:27,620 --> 01:46:31,300
So let's start with another quick one.

2086
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:32,660
I think this is from the same one

2087
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:34,340
who sent the quick email last week,

2088
01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:37,740
but this time it's signed so I can give credit.

2089
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:39,580
So here's our first email for tonight.

2090
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:40,620
If you wanna email us,

2091
01:46:40,620 --> 01:46:42,980
participate at orangelaungeradio.com

2092
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:44,300
is the place to send it.

2093
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:46,740
So the email tonight goes,

2094
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:50,440
what is the most boring video game you have ever played?

2095
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:53,320
And it's signed D from Waterloo, Iowa.

2096
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:57,980
I'm laughing cause I can't help but think of the ABBA song.

2097
01:46:57,980 --> 01:47:00,840
I'm sure you're, if you really are from Waterloo, Iowa,

2098
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:02,520
you're probably sick as hell of that joke,

2099
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:05,600
but I can't help it, it's a good song, it's a bop.

2100
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:07,340
All right, back to the question though.

2101
01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:10,300
What is the most boring video game you've ever played?

2102
01:47:11,860 --> 01:47:12,700
I don't even know.

2103
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:16,920
I'm trying to think of something that's incredibly boring.

2104
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:24,220
I get very bored with tactical games.

2105
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:26,600
So I'm not gonna make a lot of friends with this answer,

2106
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:28,660
but I'm gonna say Disgaea.

2107
01:47:28,660 --> 01:47:29,740
Sorry.

2108
01:47:29,740 --> 01:47:32,220
I just cannot get into those tactical games,

2109
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:35,340
try as I might, except for some reason,

2110
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:37,260
Final Fantasy Tactics, exception to the rule.

2111
01:47:38,020 --> 01:47:38,860
I can play that and I love that game.

2112
01:47:38,860 --> 01:47:41,620
Maybe it's just because I've always been kind of a,

2113
01:47:41,620 --> 01:47:43,380
you know, Final Fantasy fan boy,

2114
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:44,380
and I'm willing to admit that.

2115
01:47:44,380 --> 01:47:46,020
So maybe I kind of cut that game a break

2116
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:47,700
where I didn't a lot of other games,

2117
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:50,100
but I just, I could not get into like

2118
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:53,420
the really hardcore tactical stuff like Disgaea,

2119
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:55,020
or even when it comes to like Advance Wars,

2120
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:56,500
I can't get into that either.

2121
01:47:56,500 --> 01:48:00,020
And so I just, I don't get very excited playing those games

2122
01:48:00,020 --> 01:48:02,440
and they don't hold my attention very long.

2123
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:04,220
I know that answer is not gonna be popular.

2124
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:05,820
I'm not saying they're bad games.

2125
01:48:05,860 --> 01:48:07,780
I'm just saying they're not for me.

2126
01:48:07,780 --> 01:48:12,060
So Bobby Black Wolf in chat says desert bus.

2127
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:12,900
DJ Rama S says-

2128
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:14,780
I mean, that's the obvious one.

2129
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:18,500
DJ Rama S says Final Fantasy VIII game was trash.

2130
01:48:19,820 --> 01:48:21,800
TigerClownChat says a game can get boring

2131
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:23,620
when the action becomes repetitive.

2132
01:48:23,620 --> 01:48:24,900
That's true too.

2133
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:27,940
What do you think, Loki?

2134
01:48:27,940 --> 01:48:29,240
Did you think of anything?

2135
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:34,620
No, I mean, typically I'm not playing boring games.

2136
01:48:34,620 --> 01:48:36,820
Why would I subject myself through all that?

2137
01:48:36,820 --> 01:48:37,660
Yeah.

2138
01:48:39,460 --> 01:48:42,900
I know there's been things I've subjected myself to.

2139
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:45,840
Usually it's when it becomes like a grind

2140
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,140
that it gets kind of boring.

2141
01:48:47,140 --> 01:48:51,300
I guess like, I don't know if I'm like

2142
01:48:53,020 --> 01:48:54,700
trying to like a hundred percent something,

2143
01:48:54,700 --> 01:48:57,020
I would think that sometimes it might be boring,

2144
01:48:57,020 --> 01:49:00,020
but like typically I just don't spend time

2145
01:49:00,020 --> 01:49:01,640
playing boring games.

2146
01:49:01,640 --> 01:49:03,580
I don't have enough time as it is.

2147
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:05,220
I'm not going to just spend time

2148
01:49:05,220 --> 01:49:06,960
playing all these boring games.

2149
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:13,960
Harry Potter, the Harry Potter game on mobile,

2150
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:17,600
the Niantic game, that's pretty boring.

2151
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:19,500
TigerClownChat says the type of games

2152
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:22,120
where you only do a single thing the entire game

2153
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:24,340
can get boring when there isn't variety.

2154
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:26,640
You know, TigerClown, I see that,

2155
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:28,820
and I know there are games that exhibit that,

2156
01:49:28,820 --> 01:49:32,180
but I also think that there have been some incredible games

2157
01:49:32,180 --> 01:49:33,460
that are simple.

2158
01:49:34,300 --> 01:49:36,980
I think of a game like Kaboom, there's not a lot to it.

2159
01:49:36,980 --> 01:49:40,700
You catch bombs in the little water wells, that's it.

2160
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:43,340
You spend a little, but something about,

2161
01:49:43,340 --> 01:49:46,360
in like a lot of those older games on the Atari 2600

2162
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:49,620
had incredibly simple themes and could be repetitive,

2163
01:49:49,620 --> 01:49:52,300
but if it was the right mix,

2164
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:54,300
then it actually was a lot of fun.

2165
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:57,060
But I will say, and to your credit, TigerClaw,

2166
01:49:57,060 --> 01:49:59,140
there were a lot of Atari 2600 games

2167
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:02,500
that were also very boring and got old very fast

2168
01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:03,860
for a very similar reason.

2169
01:50:03,860 --> 01:50:05,260
In fact, here's another, you know what,

2170
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:07,680
is another great answer to this question, in my opinion,

2171
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:09,260
if you wanna go back to Atari 2600,

2172
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:11,500
and again, you're not gonna like it

2173
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:13,920
because a lot of people put this game up on a pedestal,

2174
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:17,300
and I'm not sure why, Sword Quest.

2175
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:18,820
You remember those games, Sword Quest Fire,

2176
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:20,380
Sword Quest Earth, Sword Quest,

2177
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:22,900
I think they only ever really finished two of them.

2178
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:24,900
I'm sorry, they're not, like,

2179
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:26,560
they're not that great of games

2180
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:29,860
because they just try to kinda do a lot,

2181
01:50:29,860 --> 01:50:31,860
and it's excruciatingly hard,

2182
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:33,380
and if you don't have the manual,

2183
01:50:33,380 --> 01:50:35,780
you don't know what the hell you're doing,

2184
01:50:35,780 --> 01:50:37,660
I get that some people ate that shit up

2185
01:50:37,660 --> 01:50:40,420
when they were a kid, and the whole contest around it,

2186
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:42,540
and they wanna see that fourth game released,

2187
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:45,300
I'm sorry, that is a 2600 game I couldn't get into,

2188
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:48,380
and I find it to be, quite frankly, a little bit boring.

2189
01:50:48,380 --> 01:50:51,900
Pod Culture in Chat says, ET, that could be two, yeah.

2190
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:54,360
As Joan Hunter-Matt says,

2191
01:50:54,360 --> 01:50:57,480
Dynasty Warriors has made a genre out of endlessly hacking

2192
01:50:57,480 --> 01:50:59,220
and slashing a large group of enemies.

2193
01:50:59,220 --> 01:51:01,060
See the Zelda, Gundam, and so forth.

2194
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:01,940
You know what, though?

2195
01:51:01,940 --> 01:51:03,540
But I think that Zelda, the Zelda version,

2196
01:51:03,540 --> 01:51:05,340
the Hyrule Warriors was a lot of fun.

2197
01:51:05,340 --> 01:51:08,380
So, you know, I can, I get that.

2198
01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:12,540
You know, 99 Nights, eh, it got a little boring,

2199
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:16,620
but, you know, I love the Hyrule Warriors, at least,

2200
01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:18,220
so is that, so.

2201
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:19,460
Anyway, something to think about,

2202
01:51:19,460 --> 01:51:21,540
and again, I also bring up the whole, like,

2203
01:51:21,540 --> 01:51:23,220
you know, simple, repetitive thing,

2204
01:51:23,220 --> 01:51:25,680
because as I was saying at the top of the show,

2205
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:27,820
this whole Pixel Poops thing, you know,

2206
01:51:27,820 --> 01:51:29,760
as much as you might giggle and laugh

2207
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:32,480
at the name and the silly concept,

2208
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:36,500
it's actually, like, the simplicity of it is a lot of fun,

2209
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:40,600
and it is a great Atari 2600-esque kind of game.

2210
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:43,700
I haven't played Loki's interpretation of it enough yet,

2211
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:44,760
but I'm imagining it's gonna be

2212
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:45,920
a very similar type of thing.

2213
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:47,260
Yours is probably gonna be more of, like,

2214
01:51:47,260 --> 01:51:50,040
a puzzle type of thing, it really sounds like.

2215
01:51:50,040 --> 01:51:52,520
Is that you have to get the poop in the right place.

2216
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:54,560
Well, not necessarily.

2217
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:56,800
I mean, it's just a puzzle.

2218
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:59,480
It's not, I hardly call it a puzzle game.

2219
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:03,520
I mean, it's like an old arcade game.

2220
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:05,840
I mean, that's kind of what it's based on.

2221
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:09,760
So, like, you know, you just have a simple goal,

2222
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:12,680
and you just have to, you have to strategize a little bit,

2223
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:14,720
because you don't wanna be,

2224
01:52:16,220 --> 01:52:17,680
because of some of the level design,

2225
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:20,380
you have to think about where stuff's going,

2226
01:52:20,380 --> 01:52:23,560
and, you know, try not to get too far away,

2227
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:27,000
and manage how much, you know, food you have,

2228
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:27,840
and all that stuff.

2229
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:29,840
There's a little bit of thought into it,

2230
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:34,660
but I don't know, stop solving puzzles.

2231
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:35,960
I've mentioned this on a show before,

2232
01:52:35,960 --> 01:52:39,440
in Aaron's Atari-inspired Pixel Poops,

2233
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:40,880
there's, like, a few things,

2234
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:42,240
there's a few twists that you might not expect.

2235
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:44,020
Like, when the score reaches a certain limit,

2236
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:45,600
some other stuff starts happening,

2237
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:48,160
and that's very Atari 2600-esque,

2238
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:50,440
that, like, it just instinctively gets harder

2239
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:51,260
at a certain point.

2240
01:52:51,260 --> 01:52:53,160
And I discovered in the game last night, you guys,

2241
01:52:53,160 --> 01:52:54,360
I didn't know this before.

2242
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:56,760
You ready for a Pixel Poops hot tip, okay?

2243
01:52:56,760 --> 01:52:57,840
You ready for this?

2244
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:00,200
I did not realize until last night,

2245
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:02,660
if you walk through the door,

2246
01:53:02,660 --> 01:53:05,860
it automatically ports you to that little white line

2247
01:53:05,860 --> 01:53:07,640
where you refill the tacos.

2248
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:09,140
I didn't know that until last night,

2249
01:53:09,140 --> 01:53:10,840
and maybe I'm not supposed to be saying that,

2250
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:13,440
but that's my hot tip, my YouTube tip.

2251
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:14,900
Number two will shock you.

2252
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:17,560
That is, literally, that is my little tip

2253
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:19,380
I learned about the game, and I didn't realize that.

2254
01:53:19,380 --> 01:53:22,800
And just being able to save, like, five squares of movement

2255
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:25,780
by doing that, let me tell you, game changer.

2256
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:28,480
All right.

2257
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:31,440
Anyhow, YYR's in chat, by the way.

2258
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:33,220
I think he missed the plugs in the beginning of the show,

2259
01:53:33,220 --> 01:53:34,360
but he's here now, and he says,

2260
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:36,520
I can vouch for Pixel Poops number two.

2261
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:38,560
It's definitely a different, deeper,

2262
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:41,060
and more challenging game than the original.

2263
01:53:41,060 --> 01:53:43,640
If you buy it, you will find it to be worth your money.

2264
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:46,160
So he's saying it's some deep shit.

2265
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:49,000
All right.

2266
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,940
All right, enough plugs, enough plugs.

2267
01:53:51,940 --> 01:53:54,520
Let's get into one more email here.

2268
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:57,220
Thank you, Dee, for the email.

2269
01:53:57,220 --> 01:53:59,400
Next email, Fabrice from Belgium.

2270
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:01,780
We haven't heard from this individual in a very long time.

2271
01:54:01,780 --> 01:54:04,220
Good to hear you from you again, my friend.

2272
01:54:04,220 --> 01:54:05,260
Hello, everyone.

2273
01:54:05,260 --> 01:54:06,740
It's been a while since I wrote in,

2274
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:10,300
but I'm still loyally listening since 2006.

2275
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:12,280
Wow, that means, that's 15 years.

2276
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:13,940
Thank you so much for that.

2277
01:54:13,940 --> 01:54:16,400
I was wondering what you think Sega's place

2278
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:19,300
in video game history is and will be.

2279
01:54:19,300 --> 01:54:21,520
Sega made four main consoles,

2280
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:26,080
and they are now longer out of hardware

2281
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:27,940
than they were in it.

2282
01:54:27,940 --> 01:54:29,300
Ah, interesting point.

2283
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:32,660
So yes, the Dreamcast was discontinued 20 years ago.

2284
01:54:32,660 --> 01:54:35,640
Also, Sony made five main consoles.

2285
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:38,220
Microsoft now has four too.

2286
01:54:38,220 --> 01:54:40,800
Although I still think Sega remains legendary,

2287
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:42,580
but that's me since I'm a fan boy.

2288
01:54:42,580 --> 01:54:44,400
The truth is that for a lot of people,

2289
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:48,440
the PlayStation 2 or the Xbox 360 was their first console.

2290
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:51,540
For them, Sega is just another game company.

2291
01:54:51,540 --> 01:54:54,240
It feels like the vibe I have about Atari.

2292
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:56,360
They were an important video game company,

2293
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:58,400
but to me, they don't mean a lot.

2294
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:00,860
Well, as always, thank you for making the show.

2295
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:03,640
You make the mess we are in now a lot more bearable.

2296
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:04,940
Thank you so much for that.

2297
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:06,800
Yours truly, Fabrice from Belgium.

2298
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:10,360
Thank you for that kindhearted sentiment at the end there.

2299
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:11,620
Let's tackle the question.

2300
01:55:11,620 --> 01:55:15,060
What do you think Sega's place in gaming history will be?

2301
01:55:15,060 --> 01:55:18,740
Loki, you want to take this on, or I have an idea?

2302
01:55:18,740 --> 01:55:24,180
I mean, Sonic, I don't know.

2303
01:55:24,180 --> 01:55:28,020
They have a solid library of stuff

2304
01:55:28,020 --> 01:55:29,900
that they'll be known for.

2305
01:55:29,900 --> 01:55:33,660
And they're still kind of like, even their philosophy

2306
01:55:33,660 --> 01:55:36,820
as far as how they treat fan games, I think,

2307
01:55:36,820 --> 01:55:38,580
is something that I wish would be adopted

2308
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:42,900
by some other companies, like Nintendo.

2309
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:45,300
So I don't know.

2310
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:50,340
I think there's still just plenty to remember them by.

2311
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:51,780
Yeah.

2312
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:52,700
Some comments in chat.

2313
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:55,480
Quest Buster says, Sega's iconic and one of the greats.

2314
01:55:55,480 --> 01:55:57,340
Whatever happens to it now can't take away

2315
01:55:57,340 --> 01:55:59,180
its impact on game history.

2316
01:55:59,180 --> 01:56:01,220
I think to find the answer to your question, Fabrice,

2317
01:56:01,220 --> 01:56:02,780
I think we would have to do something

2318
01:56:02,780 --> 01:56:05,100
that we do a lot in gaming, and that

2319
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:09,540
is look at the parallels in other entertainment venues,

2320
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:11,420
namely movies.

2321
01:56:11,420 --> 01:56:12,940
Let's look at the movie industry.

2322
01:56:12,940 --> 01:56:18,460
And there are a lot of movies that came out a long time ago

2323
01:56:18,460 --> 01:56:22,180
from studios and companies that are no longer around.

2324
01:56:22,180 --> 01:56:24,300
And kind of like you say in the email

2325
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:26,780
when you talk about Atari and so forth,

2326
01:56:26,780 --> 01:56:30,340
there are some movies that people today don't necessarily

2327
01:56:30,340 --> 01:56:32,260
care about, right?

2328
01:56:32,260 --> 01:56:36,260
And I mean older movies, like an old musical.

2329
01:56:36,260 --> 01:56:37,860
Say The Wizard of Oz.

2330
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:39,560
There are some people that will tell you,

2331
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:40,980
I love The Wizard of Oz.

2332
01:56:40,980 --> 01:56:43,340
I love this movie so much because I

2333
01:56:43,340 --> 01:56:45,020
used to watch it when I was a kid,

2334
01:56:45,020 --> 01:56:46,980
and it was on TV at Thanksgiving.

2335
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:48,340
And my family would get together,

2336
01:56:48,340 --> 01:56:51,420
and we'd love The Wizard of Oz, or replace that

2337
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:53,740
with The Sound of Music.

2338
01:56:53,740 --> 01:56:55,540
That's my favorite musical of all time,

2339
01:56:55,540 --> 01:56:59,380
even though these things were out a generation ago, right?

2340
01:56:59,380 --> 01:57:01,140
So there's some people that look back on it

2341
01:57:01,140 --> 01:57:02,880
and remember it very fondly, but there's

2342
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:06,420
other people that go, those movies are so hard to watch.

2343
01:57:06,420 --> 01:57:08,540
They just they look so bad.

2344
01:57:08,540 --> 01:57:09,980
They're grainy.

2345
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:12,460
They're musicals.

2346
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:14,820
All the movies, they're older musicals,

2347
01:57:14,820 --> 01:57:18,780
and I don't like musicals, and so on and so on.

2348
01:57:18,780 --> 01:57:22,100
Or you take another movie from the past

2349
01:57:22,100 --> 01:57:24,700
that maybe just doesn't hold up well over time,

2350
01:57:24,700 --> 01:57:28,380
where it's really hard to look at it through a 2021 lens

2351
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:31,260
because culture has shifted so much.

2352
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:37,460
So my point is, I think Sega has a place in that part of history

2353
01:57:37,460 --> 01:57:40,700
where it's like they are what a classic movie studio was,

2354
01:57:40,700 --> 01:57:44,740
what maybe like an MGM or something was back in the day.

2355
01:57:44,740 --> 01:57:46,540
That's where Sega holds up.

2356
01:57:46,540 --> 01:57:48,380
And there's going to be some people till the end of time

2357
01:57:48,380 --> 01:57:50,140
that are like, I love Sonic.

2358
01:57:50,140 --> 01:57:52,380
I played Sonic the Hedgehog growing up,

2359
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:56,940
or my dad made me play Sonic because he played it growing up

2360
01:57:56,940 --> 01:57:58,140
and this was a thing.

2361
01:57:58,140 --> 01:58:00,580
And I think it'll be a thing that gets brought out

2362
01:58:00,580 --> 01:58:02,020
once in a while.

2363
01:58:02,020 --> 01:58:05,500
Like, oh, remember this old game that we grew up with?

2364
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:06,020
It's funny.

2365
01:58:06,020 --> 01:58:09,060
Actually, I talked about the classic gaming store visit

2366
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:11,660
earlier today, right?

2367
01:58:11,660 --> 01:58:13,940
When I was there, it was just me in there

2368
01:58:13,940 --> 01:58:15,500
and a couple of the employees.

2369
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:18,860
And at some point, a family came in, and they were looking at,

2370
01:58:18,860 --> 01:58:21,260
they have Nintendo old 8-bit cartridges

2371
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:22,740
that are in the glass case.

2372
01:58:22,740 --> 01:58:26,100
And there was a kid, like six or seven years old,

2373
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:28,540
that was very fascinated with the cartridges.

2374
01:58:28,540 --> 01:58:31,220
They were something he'd seen in a textbook somewhere

2375
01:58:31,220 --> 01:58:32,860
or in a movie he was fascinated with.

2376
01:58:32,860 --> 01:58:35,700
He's like, wow, look at all these old games.

2377
01:58:35,700 --> 01:58:37,300
Look at all these games.

2378
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:38,180
He's very fascinated.

2379
01:58:38,180 --> 01:58:40,860
And the dad was there, and the mom was there too,

2380
01:58:40,860 --> 01:58:42,580
although it was kind of a family of four.

2381
01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:44,020
And the mom kind of went off to another part

2382
01:58:44,020 --> 01:58:45,300
of the store with a girl.

2383
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:47,320
So it was just the dad and the little boy.

2384
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:49,380
And the dad was saying, yeah, these

2385
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:50,860
are the games that I grew up on.

2386
01:58:50,860 --> 01:58:53,420
Can you guess which one I like to play a lot?

2387
01:58:53,420 --> 01:58:56,740
And I remember the girl saying something about Donkey Kong

2388
01:58:56,740 --> 01:58:57,380
or something.

2389
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:59,580
So they were kind of having a discussion like that.

2390
01:58:59,580 --> 01:59:02,620
So I mean, that's, again, even though they

2391
01:59:02,620 --> 01:59:04,900
don't make Nintendo games and NES cartridges anymore,

2392
01:59:04,900 --> 01:59:07,180
and I wasn't nosy enough to hear whatever the game really

2393
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:10,000
was that he played a lot of, it's

2394
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,700
probably by a company that doesn't really

2395
01:59:11,700 --> 01:59:13,140
exist in the same way anymore.

2396
01:59:13,140 --> 01:59:15,540
For all I know, that man said the correct answer, which

2397
01:59:15,540 --> 01:59:16,880
would be The Guardian legend.

2398
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:17,380
Just kidding.

2399
01:59:17,380 --> 01:59:18,300
It wasn't in the case.

2400
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:20,700
I looked.

2401
01:59:20,700 --> 01:59:23,460
And that's from a company that no longer exists,

2402
01:59:23,460 --> 01:59:26,280
but it doesn't negate that they made a great piece of art that

2403
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:27,420
still holds up.

2404
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:31,100
So let me get some more comments from chat.

2405
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:34,480
SSG100Matt says, also, Sega has the most brilliant ad

2406
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:36,760
campaign in gaming history.

2407
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:39,080
They spent a lot of money and geared the genesis

2408
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:42,480
to teens, which went against Nintendo's family model.

2409
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:44,620
As SSG100Matt continues, I think Sega

2410
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:46,000
opened the door for a company that

2411
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,720
can take on the big names like Nintendo, Atari, et cetera,

2412
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:49,800
in their own game.

2413
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:52,600
They went the distance, and we enjoyed the ride.

2414
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:55,720
Tigerclaw on chat was talking about my parallels there,

2415
01:59:55,720 --> 01:59:58,840
saying, as much as I like the old movies from my childhood,

2416
01:59:58,840 --> 02:00:00,800
I don't really go back to watching them again,

2417
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:02,080
because I've already seen them.

2418
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:04,040
When I see a movie, it's about the first time

2419
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:05,600
I've seen something new.

2420
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:07,440
It's hard to go back and watch them again,

2421
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:08,920
knowing how they begin and end.

2422
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:11,400
See, that is so not like me, Tigerclaw.

2423
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:13,400
You guys know I've seen The Rocky Horror Picture

2424
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:16,620
Show probably 500 times, easily, easily, in a theater,

2425
02:00:16,620 --> 02:00:17,440
nonetheless.

2426
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:18,400
Not even that.

2427
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:20,840
A movie like Clue, easily 100 times.

2428
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:24,080
Showgirls, easily 50 times.

2429
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:26,040
Those are cult movies, of course,

2430
02:00:26,040 --> 02:00:29,880
that are kind of meant to be watched or rewatched.

2431
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:33,640
But even sometimes there's like comfort food for movies.

2432
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:36,520
I was just browsing around Peacock on the Xbox.

2433
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:37,920
I was like, oh, what'd they put on the service?

2434
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:39,840
And I was like, Mama Mia.

2435
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:42,520
And I watched Mama Mia start to finish on Peacock.

2436
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:43,560
I didn't even need to watch that.

2437
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:45,560
I have the fucking Blu-ray somewhere,

2438
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:46,840
but I was just feeling lazy.

2439
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:47,920
It's literally right in front of me.

2440
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:50,160
Push A to play, okay.

2441
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:52,120
Maybe it's in 4K, I don't know.

2442
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:54,160
And they even fucking put commercials in it,

2443
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:55,640
but I was like, whatever.

2444
02:00:55,640 --> 02:00:56,680
It's kind of like watching a TV.

2445
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:58,920
I wasn't like actively watching it.

2446
02:00:58,920 --> 02:01:01,800
I was kind of playing around on my phone,

2447
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:03,540
kind of like it's on in the background.

2448
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:06,780
But that movie, as cheesy as it,

2449
02:01:06,780 --> 02:01:10,120
I admit is a cheesy, ridiculous movie,

2450
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:13,720
but it is so comfort food for me because I love the music.

2451
02:01:13,720 --> 02:01:17,840
I love ABBA, you know, whatever.

2452
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:20,480
It's just, it's a group I grew up with for a long time.

2453
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:23,580
So that movie's comfort food for me.

2454
02:01:23,580 --> 02:01:25,660
And I think, again,

2455
02:01:25,660 --> 02:01:28,960
that's what Sega games are gonna be for a lot of people.

2456
02:01:30,860 --> 02:01:32,020
Quest Buster in chat says,

2457
02:01:32,060 --> 02:01:35,780
and thank you Sega for bringing Valkyria Chronicles 4 over

2458
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:38,220
for taking risks like that for the fans.

2459
02:01:38,220 --> 02:01:39,140
Pod Culture says,

2460
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:42,540
I've probably seen Serenity about 20 times in the theater.

2461
02:01:42,540 --> 02:01:43,500
DJ Rama S says,

2462
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:46,060
I feel the same way when I watch anime on Funimation,

2463
02:01:46,060 --> 02:01:47,260
Hulu, and Crunchyroll.

2464
02:01:47,260 --> 02:01:48,740
Yeah, I have the DVD or Blu-ray,

2465
02:01:48,740 --> 02:01:50,020
but dammit it's right there

2466
02:01:50,020 --> 02:01:51,540
and I'm gonna watch and enjoy it.

2467
02:01:51,540 --> 02:01:52,460
Thank you.

2468
02:01:52,460 --> 02:01:53,700
You understand what I mean.

2469
02:01:53,700 --> 02:01:55,860
And someday,

2470
02:01:55,860 --> 02:01:59,780
someday those Sega games are just gonna be in the cloud.

2471
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:01,660
In fact, many of them already are.

2472
02:02:02,180 --> 02:02:03,460
Push A to start, you know,

2473
02:02:03,460 --> 02:02:05,780
and that's the way it's gonna be.

2474
02:02:05,780 --> 02:02:08,540
So that's my long-winded answer to your question, Fabrice.

2475
02:02:08,540 --> 02:02:11,100
I think Sega, there's always gonna be a place for Sega.

2476
02:02:11,100 --> 02:02:12,940
Sega will always have a corner

2477
02:02:12,940 --> 02:02:15,140
in any video game history museum.

2478
02:02:15,140 --> 02:02:19,420
But as far as do people hold it fondly or what,

2479
02:02:19,420 --> 02:02:22,680
that's just gonna depend on their culture.

2480
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:25,280
And I'm not talking about like where somebody is,

2481
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:27,520
I'm talking about what they're surrounded with,

2482
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:28,920
their family's influence,

2483
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:31,300
their friends' influence and all of that.

2484
02:02:31,820 --> 02:02:33,140
That's what's gonna really play into

2485
02:02:33,140 --> 02:02:34,420
what somebody kind of thinks of Sega.

2486
02:02:34,420 --> 02:02:35,340
And like you said,

2487
02:02:35,340 --> 02:02:38,340
you don't really think a lot about Atari.

2488
02:02:38,340 --> 02:02:40,060
Realize there's gonna be some people,

2489
02:02:40,060 --> 02:02:42,540
especially now that Sega has been out of the business

2490
02:02:42,540 --> 02:02:45,380
20 years, that means somebody could have been born

2491
02:02:45,380 --> 02:02:48,160
after Sega was out of the business and is now an adult.

2492
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:49,740
So you're gonna have to get used to the idea

2493
02:02:49,740 --> 02:02:51,220
that there's gonna be some,

2494
02:02:51,220 --> 02:02:54,420
I can't even say kids, adults, young adults now

2495
02:02:54,420 --> 02:02:55,260
who are gonna be like,

2496
02:02:55,260 --> 02:02:56,940
oh, I never really played a Sega game

2497
02:02:56,940 --> 02:02:58,980
cause they weren't really around.

2498
02:02:58,980 --> 02:03:00,460
Or, oh yeah, Sonic.

2499
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:03,280
Yeah, I remember the Wii game that had him in it.

2500
02:03:04,620 --> 02:03:05,500
You know?

2501
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:07,240
So it's just gonna be a little different.

2502
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:08,700
So, all right.

2503
02:03:08,700 --> 02:03:09,740
Anyway, great question.

2504
02:03:09,740 --> 02:03:11,580
You mean that character from Smash Brothers?

2505
02:03:11,580 --> 02:03:12,420
Yeah, right?

2506
02:03:12,420 --> 02:03:13,440
Yeah, so.

2509
02:03:17,020 --> 02:03:18,220
Actually, one more thought, I'm sorry.

2510
02:03:18,220 --> 02:03:20,080
Fabrice, one more thought.

2511
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:21,820
If you want more people to,

2512
02:03:21,820 --> 02:03:24,300
you have to educate the future.

2513
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:27,380
You have to educate the children about Sega

2514
02:03:27,380 --> 02:03:28,860
and why you love them so much.

2515
02:03:28,860 --> 02:03:30,900
So, especially in your own family

2516
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:32,900
and the people around you.

2517
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:34,540
Even if you don't have kids of your own,

2518
02:03:34,540 --> 02:03:36,500
you probably know somebody with kids

2519
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:39,540
and you can sure bring over that, you know,

2520
02:03:39,540 --> 02:03:41,040
Sega Dreamcast.

2521
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:43,240
So, anyway, that's my thought.

2522
02:03:45,180 --> 02:03:46,020
All right.

2523
02:03:47,300 --> 02:03:48,140
That's it for emails.

2524
02:03:48,140 --> 02:03:49,700
If you wanna send us an email in a future week,

2525
02:03:49,700 --> 02:03:53,580

2526
02:03:53,580 --> 02:03:57,340
YYR in chat says, oof, that character from Smash Brothers,

2527
02:03:57,340 --> 02:03:59,180
that just makes me sad.

2528
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:00,680
But you know what?

2529
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:02,880
As much as it might make you sad,

2530
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:07,080
somebody is gonna go, what game is this character from?

2531
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:09,060
I don't, he looks familiar.

2532
02:04:09,060 --> 02:04:09,900
What is this?

2533
02:04:09,900 --> 02:04:11,260
And might actually do some research.

2534
02:04:11,260 --> 02:04:13,060
There's gonna be some people that discover the game

2535
02:04:13,060 --> 02:04:14,660
because of Smash Brothers.

2536
02:04:14,660 --> 02:04:16,460
But I get it, it makes you feel old.

2537
02:04:16,460 --> 02:04:17,840
Believe me, I hear it.

2538
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:19,260
All right.

2539
02:04:19,260 --> 02:04:22,140
Loki, any last minute stories for our audience tonight?

2540
02:04:22,140 --> 02:04:24,460
While I ask Chad if they have any other comments

2541
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:25,300
or questions.

2542
02:04:26,180 --> 02:04:29,580
Yeah, so there was some leaks coming out

2543
02:04:29,580 --> 02:04:32,780
about the Sonic 30th anniversary.

2544
02:04:33,700 --> 02:04:38,700
So this is coming from a apparently credible leaker,

2545
02:04:39,660 --> 02:04:41,740
a Nintendo leaker, Zippo.

2546
02:04:41,740 --> 02:04:44,460
And so it's talking about, aside from, you know,

2547
02:04:44,460 --> 02:04:46,460
the voice cast has left Sonic,

2548
02:04:46,460 --> 02:04:49,540
so the voice of Sonic, Roger Craig Smith,

2549
02:04:49,540 --> 02:04:51,180
Sidney Robinson, the voice of Amy,

2550
02:04:51,180 --> 02:04:54,140
and Colleen, oh, I can't even pronounce her last name,

2551
02:04:54,140 --> 02:04:56,980
voice of Tails, all have departed.

2552
02:04:56,980 --> 02:04:59,140
And they're saying that the rest of the current voice cast

2553
02:04:59,140 --> 02:05:01,420
will be following them as well and leaving.

2554
02:05:02,820 --> 02:05:07,820
Apparently the Warren Graff and Ken Pontic

2555
02:05:08,020 --> 02:05:09,940
are no longer writing for the game.

2556
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:14,860
And they're saying that the 30th anniversary

2557
02:05:14,860 --> 02:05:17,700
will be described as a new era for Sonic,

2558
02:05:17,700 --> 02:05:20,340
that the modern Sonic will focus on the franchise

2559
02:05:20,340 --> 02:05:22,720
going forward, both in 2D and 3D games.

2560
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:25,840
Apparently Mania was a one-off,

2561
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:30,240
and fans of the classic era should look to fan games

2562
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:31,600
for further installments.

2563
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:34,120
Wow.

2564
02:05:34,120 --> 02:05:38,640
The next 3D game apparently will be, you know,

2565
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:42,720
full 3D games, you know, 3D spin dashing.

2566
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:45,840
There's gonna be, you know, multiple playable characters.

2567
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:48,320
Supposed to be out by holiday,

2568
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:51,300
assuming it doesn't get delayed.

2569
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:54,420
And with characters appearing,

2570
02:05:54,420 --> 02:05:58,260
more guest appearances in other games.

2571
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:01,540
And then-

2572
02:06:01,540 --> 02:06:02,380
I hate to say it,

2573
02:06:02,380 --> 02:06:04,020
but this sounds like a recipe for disaster.

2574
02:06:04,020 --> 02:06:05,880
I mean, prove me wrong, prove me wrong.

2575
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:07,420
But this whole, like,

2576
02:06:07,420 --> 02:06:09,700
if you wanna remember the classic Sonic games,

2577
02:06:09,700 --> 02:06:10,700
go play fan games.

2578
02:06:10,700 --> 02:06:13,620
I mean, it's great that Sega embraces that, I'm happy.

2579
02:06:13,620 --> 02:06:17,180
But at the same time, it's like, remember Sonic 4?

2580
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:19,140
Ooh.

2581
02:06:19,140 --> 02:06:20,660
Yeah.

2582
02:06:21,580 --> 02:06:22,420
Apparently though,

2583
02:06:22,420 --> 02:06:27,420
they're also supposed to be working on a 2D game as well.

2584
02:06:27,420 --> 02:06:29,100
Someone's working on one of those.

2585
02:06:29,100 --> 02:06:31,300
So there's a new Sonic collection.

2586
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:32,860
Remember, they'll be coming out in June.

2587
02:06:32,860 --> 02:06:37,860
It's gonna feature, you know, majority of the classic games.

2588
02:06:40,060 --> 02:06:42,160
Yeah, so I guess we'll have to wait and see

2589
02:06:42,160 --> 02:06:44,100
when any of this stuff gets announced.

2590
02:06:45,660 --> 02:06:46,500
All right.

2591
02:06:47,860 --> 02:06:48,980
That's pretty much it.

2592
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:49,860
That's it.

2593
02:06:49,860 --> 02:06:50,700
All right.

2594
02:06:50,700 --> 02:06:52,740
Well, I guess we're gonna wrap up then.

2595
02:06:52,740 --> 02:06:54,140
I know it's only just after eight,

2596
02:06:54,140 --> 02:06:57,300
but we don't have Jamie here tonight to get opinions from.

2597
02:06:57,300 --> 02:06:59,500
So, but she'll be back next week.

2598
02:06:59,500 --> 02:07:00,340
Assumable.

2599
02:07:00,340 --> 02:07:01,500
Oh, I was gonna say,

2600
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:02,980
I don't know if we didn't talk about it,

2601
02:07:02,980 --> 02:07:07,980
but they're so, they have had the like a preview of,

2602
02:07:08,620 --> 02:07:11,380
or I don't know if it's, it's sort of open,

2603
02:07:11,380 --> 02:07:14,020
but the new Super Nintendo World,

2604
02:07:14,020 --> 02:07:16,260
they've have video now of all the rides.

2605
02:07:16,260 --> 02:07:17,100
Yeah.

2606
02:07:17,140 --> 02:07:19,300
Come out and stuff like that.

2607
02:07:19,300 --> 02:07:21,460
What have your thoughts been on that?

2608
02:07:21,460 --> 02:07:26,300
Like is Mario Kart rides kind of a little,

2609
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:29,180
not what I was hoping it would be.

2610
02:07:29,180 --> 02:07:30,540
It looks fun.

2611
02:07:30,540 --> 02:07:34,860
It looks kind of like a midway mania or something like that,

2612
02:07:34,860 --> 02:07:37,440
but more AR, which is cool.

2613
02:07:38,380 --> 02:07:40,700
But normally when I think of Mario Kart,

2614
02:07:40,700 --> 02:07:44,300
I think of much faster than that.

2615
02:07:44,300 --> 02:07:47,380
And that's not a very fast ride.

2616
02:07:47,380 --> 02:07:51,140
The videos never are as good of an experience

2617
02:07:51,140 --> 02:07:52,320
as the real thing.

2618
02:07:54,740 --> 02:07:59,580
And I wanna see what it looks like out after the pandemic

2619
02:07:59,580 --> 02:08:01,620
and what it looks like in America.

2620
02:08:01,620 --> 02:08:03,520
Not that those things are necessarily gonna suddenly

2621
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:04,680
make that ride any different,

2622
02:08:04,680 --> 02:08:06,740
but they may be holding back on some effects

2623
02:08:06,740 --> 02:08:09,500
and some things because they don't want the air

2624
02:08:09,500 --> 02:08:11,980
to circulate a certain way or what have you.

2625
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:15,940
And in Japan, the size of things tends to be

2626
02:08:15,940 --> 02:08:16,780
a little bit smaller

2627
02:08:16,780 --> 02:08:19,500
because they don't have as much space to work with.

2628
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:21,260
That's what happened with DisneySea, I think,

2629
02:08:21,260 --> 02:08:23,180
is actually a relatively small Disney property

2630
02:08:23,180 --> 02:08:25,060
because they didn't have a lot of space to build with.

2631
02:08:25,060 --> 02:08:27,380
So I'm just a little curious to see what it looks like.

2632
02:08:27,380 --> 02:08:30,400
But I mean, again, I could watch those videos and go,

2633
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:31,560
I didn't really care for that.

2634
02:08:31,560 --> 02:08:34,260
And I kind of don't know, but I was like,

2635
02:08:34,260 --> 02:08:35,420
I just wanna see it in person.

2636
02:08:35,420 --> 02:08:37,220
I just feel like I'm gonna give it,

2637
02:08:37,220 --> 02:08:40,220
like I could sit here and go, it didn't look fun at all.

2638
02:08:40,260 --> 02:08:42,900
Like hell, I'm not gonna be going there

2639
02:08:42,900 --> 02:08:45,180
in the first couple months after it opens

2640
02:08:45,180 --> 02:08:48,360
to take it all in for myself

2641
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:51,560
and get a thousand billion selfies for Instagram

2642
02:08:51,560 --> 02:08:52,980
with everything that's there.

2643
02:08:52,980 --> 02:08:55,980
So like, you know, the videos, they're interesting,

2644
02:08:55,980 --> 02:08:58,340
but let's see what it looks like

2645
02:08:58,340 --> 02:09:00,120
when the world's back to normal a little bit

2646
02:09:00,120 --> 02:09:02,380
and what it looks like here in the States.

2647
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:05,380
That's my thought.

2648
02:09:05,380 --> 02:09:07,580
Orange right in chat says,

2649
02:09:07,580 --> 02:09:09,300
yeah, I was thinking it would be a lot faster,

2650
02:09:09,340 --> 02:09:10,780
but it looks like it's pretty slow.

2651
02:09:10,780 --> 02:09:13,060
Pixelpaca says, even if Disney C is small,

2652
02:09:13,060 --> 02:09:14,020
it's utterly gorgeous.

2653
02:09:14,020 --> 02:09:16,780
Oh yeah, but Disney and all these companies,

2654
02:09:16,780 --> 02:09:18,880
they are very good at playing optical illusions.

2655
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:23,500
Very good with making your eyes believe certain things

2656
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:24,900
that may or may not be true.

2657
02:09:24,900 --> 02:09:26,260
And I'll kind of leave it at that.

2658
02:09:26,260 --> 02:09:27,980
But that's part of the Disney magic.

2659
02:09:27,980 --> 02:09:29,620
That's what makes a company like Disney

2660
02:09:29,620 --> 02:09:32,140
and Universal is very good at theme park stuff too.

2661
02:09:32,140 --> 02:09:34,140
That's what makes these companies do well

2662
02:09:34,140 --> 02:09:35,840
in the theme park business is that,

2663
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:38,940
you know, they know what the F they're doing.

2664
02:09:39,460 --> 02:09:40,300
That's for sure.

2665
02:09:40,300 --> 02:09:42,900
So anything else, Logie?

2666
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:43,840
No, that's it.

2667
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:44,680
All right.

2668
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:47,340
Well, let's get final thoughts then before we wrap it up,

2669
02:09:47,340 --> 02:09:48,660
I do want to say thank you guys so much

2670
02:09:48,660 --> 02:09:50,460
for listening to Orange Launch Radio this week.

2671
02:09:50,460 --> 02:09:52,360
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio,

2672
02:09:52,360 --> 02:09:54,060
please tell a friend or two about the show.

2673
02:09:54,060 --> 02:09:55,820
Help us spread the word because we are the show

2674
02:09:55,820 --> 02:09:57,160
where every gamer has a voice,

2675
02:09:57,160 --> 02:09:59,060
but if the voices aren't here to put out on air,

2676
02:09:59,060 --> 02:10:00,320
then what can we do?

2677
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:04,860
So please tell a friend a nice five star review

2678
02:10:04,860 --> 02:10:05,940
on a site like iTunes

2679
02:10:05,940 --> 02:10:08,660
or wherever you found this podcast goes a long way.

2680
02:10:09,260 --> 02:10:11,460
Auto hosts, a VOG network on Twitch

2681
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:12,820
are one of the best things you can do.

2682
02:10:12,820 --> 02:10:15,300
So thank you, thank you to those of you that do that.

2683
02:10:15,300 --> 02:10:16,900
Unfortunately, I don't have a list in front of me,

2684
02:10:16,900 --> 02:10:20,140
but just know if you're doing that, I really appreciate it.

2685
02:10:20,140 --> 02:10:23,020
So those go a long way as well.

2686
02:10:23,020 --> 02:10:24,260
Thank you for being here tonight.

2687
02:10:24,260 --> 02:10:25,740
I know there's a lot of, you know,

2688
02:10:25,740 --> 02:10:27,560
big stuff going on in the world.

2689
02:10:27,560 --> 02:10:29,380
So just appreciate you spending a little extra time

2690
02:10:29,380 --> 02:10:30,220
with us tonight.

2691
02:10:30,220 --> 02:10:31,700
Even if you're on the podcast feed,

2692
02:10:31,700 --> 02:10:33,140
hey, I appreciate you taking the time out

2693
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:36,380
to listen to the podcast like Fabrice has since 2006.

2694
02:10:36,420 --> 02:10:37,860
Really appreciate that.

2695
02:10:37,860 --> 02:10:41,380
And everybody out there listening, thank you so much.

2696
02:10:41,380 --> 02:10:43,940

or some VOG network branded merchandise, check it out.

2701
02:10:54,300 --> 02:10:57,020
There's some cute little things on there.

2702
02:10:57,020 --> 02:10:58,260
Check that out.

2703
02:10:58,260 --> 02:10:59,820
So I think that's it.

2704
02:10:59,820 --> 02:11:01,320
Now we can get everybody's final thoughts

2705
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:02,160
and then we'll be out of here.

2706
02:11:02,160 --> 02:11:03,660
So Loki, I'll start with you.

2707
02:11:03,660 --> 02:11:05,280
You got a big week ahead of you.

2708
02:11:05,280 --> 02:11:07,240
Yeah, just rushing, rushing, rushing,

2709
02:11:07,240 --> 02:11:10,080
trying to get stuff done, so yeah.

2710
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:15,220
And my final thought is I have some more project ideas

2711
02:11:15,220 --> 02:11:17,360
of my own stewing, but I just have to, you know,

2712
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:18,540
be able to stick with something.

2713
02:11:18,540 --> 02:11:22,520
And it's been a little crazy in these pandemic times,

2714
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:25,800
but I'm hoping there'll be more creative stuff real soon.

2715
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:28,120
So anyway, we will see you in seven days.

2716
02:11:28,120 --> 02:11:31,320
Happy gaming, have a wonderful night everybody

2717
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:33,540
and stay safe out there.

2718
02:11:33,540 --> 02:11:34,380
We'll see you next week.

2719
02:11:34,380 --> 02:11:35,200
Bye.

02:11:36,040 --> 02:11:38,920
