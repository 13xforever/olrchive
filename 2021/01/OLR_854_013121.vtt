WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.680
And it looks really interesting, stay tuned to hear details about that.

00:17.680 --> 00:21.080
But after the show, if you're wanting a more fast-paced, arcade-style baseball game

00:21.080 --> 00:25.520
that does exist, look for a means of playing Super Baseball 2020 or Baseball Stars 2.

00:25.520 --> 00:28.280
Those have been my favorites for decades.

00:28.280 --> 00:29.840
This is one story you'll hear tonight.

00:29.840 --> 00:33.800
This and plenty more is coming from your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki right

00:33.800 --> 00:36.840
now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.840 --> 00:45.280
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:45.280 --> 00:47.200
where every gamer has a voice.

00:47.200 --> 00:55.960
It is Orange Lounge Radio Live once again, back in the house, episode number 854 for

00:55.960 --> 01:00.960
this January the 31st of 2021, the last day of January.

01:00.960 --> 01:08.200
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you from our studio in Sacramento, California, sadly still

01:08.200 --> 01:13.680
socially distancing because it's still March 2020 for a lot of us.

01:13.680 --> 01:18.320
And joining me via the magic of Discord, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:18.320 --> 01:19.320
What's up?

01:19.320 --> 01:20.320
Hi, how are you?

01:20.320 --> 01:22.200
I'm all right.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.200
Nice wig.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.920
Thank you.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.760
It's a lace front, Rob.

01:27.760 --> 01:28.760
Lace.

01:28.760 --> 01:29.760
Real lace.

01:29.760 --> 01:33.600
Unfortunately, the podcast folks can't see that sometimes you decide to dress up a little

01:33.600 --> 01:36.960
bit for the show, which, you know, it's all there you go.

01:36.960 --> 01:37.960
There you go.

01:37.960 --> 01:38.960
Yes.

01:38.960 --> 01:39.960
Yes.

01:39.960 --> 01:40.960
Make love to the camera.

01:40.960 --> 01:41.960
Okay.

01:41.960 --> 01:42.960
Perfect.

01:42.960 --> 01:46.840
I decided that I had been feeling kind of crappy all day, so I was gonna glam up just

01:46.840 --> 01:47.840
a little bit.

01:47.840 --> 01:55.360
So I am wearing the lovely eyeshadow palette by our local queen, Sasha Devereaux, who is

01:55.760 --> 01:56.760
talented and amazing.

01:56.760 --> 01:57.760
Look her up.

01:57.760 --> 01:58.760
She's she's awesome.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.080
And her palette is really good.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.480
I'm not being paid to say this.

02:02.480 --> 02:06.880
And I said once we can get back together in person at some point, I said maybe we could

02:06.880 --> 02:10.960
do like a charity fundraiser for something where if we make like, I don't know, a hundred

02:10.960 --> 02:13.680
bucks, 200 bucks, we'll figure out something fair.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.680
I said the DarkSakura could do my makeup for a show.

02:16.680 --> 02:19.640
So you're gonna be a bearded queen.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.640
So look forward.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.640
Please look forward to that.

02:21.640 --> 02:24.800
Once COVID is over, that'll be our official COVID is over party.

02:24.800 --> 02:25.800
All right.

02:25.800 --> 02:26.800
Right.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.200
Anyway, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.320
Hey, how's it going?

02:30.320 --> 02:31.320
Hey, good, Loki.

02:31.320 --> 02:33.320
How are you doing?

02:33.320 --> 02:34.320
Doing pretty good.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.320
Yeah.

02:35.320 --> 02:36.320
Busy.

02:36.320 --> 02:37.320
Yeah.

02:37.320 --> 02:38.320
Yeah.

02:38.320 --> 02:39.320
I can't tell.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.320
What is that game playing behind you tonight?

02:40.320 --> 02:41.320
I can't read the dialogue from here.

02:41.320 --> 02:42.320
I can't see.

02:42.320 --> 02:45.640
Well, it just relates to this week.

02:45.640 --> 02:46.640
Okay.

02:46.640 --> 02:50.520
It is the indie RPG game called To the Moon.

02:50.520 --> 02:51.520
Oh.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.400
I love that game.

02:53.400 --> 02:54.400
Yeah.

02:54.400 --> 02:55.400
That is such a sweet game.

02:55.400 --> 02:56.400
Okay.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.400
I see what you...

02:57.400 --> 02:58.400
Okay.

02:58.400 --> 02:59.400
To the Moon.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.400
I see what you did there.

03:00.400 --> 03:01.400
Okay.

03:01.400 --> 03:02.400
Okay.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.400
It took me a minute.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.400
Yeah.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.400
No, but that is, it is a good game for an entirely different reason than what you're

03:05.400 --> 03:06.720
referring to here.

03:06.720 --> 03:11.240
But all right, Loki, if you're going to open that can of worms, why don't we get into our

03:11.240 --> 03:15.760
kickoff topic right off the bat and talk about what's going on, which, okay, I'm gonna be

03:15.760 --> 03:19.240
fair because it's funny because Bobby kind of addressed this on his show too, because

03:19.240 --> 03:22.600
we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the

03:22.600 --> 03:27.320
Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, V-O-G Network, right after the Bobby

03:27.320 --> 03:28.320
Black Wolf show.

03:28.320 --> 03:33.600
And if you are live with us on Sunday night, stop by our chat room because we do like to

03:33.600 --> 03:35.520
read comments from chat.

03:35.520 --> 03:39.120
So we're on right after the Bobby Black Wolf show and Bobby on his show was kind of like,

03:39.120 --> 03:43.140
I'm not really going to talk about it because it's not really gaming news and actually do

03:43.140 --> 03:44.800
kind of agree to an extent.

03:44.800 --> 03:50.280
Like this story has now far eclipsed what is just gaming news.

03:50.280 --> 03:54.520
However, the reason why I think it still qualifies for discussion here and merits discussion

03:54.520 --> 04:00.360
is because I think there's definitely an element of gaming culture that went into this and

04:00.360 --> 04:05.680
why people felt the need to save this particular stock.

04:05.680 --> 04:09.480
But I'll let Loki take it from here, even though it is a follow up to last week, kind

04:09.480 --> 04:12.280
of, but it just, it went to the moon this week.

04:12.760 --> 04:21.900
Yeah, so basically what's happening is there is these hedge funds that have shorted GameStop

04:21.900 --> 04:22.900
stock.

04:22.900 --> 04:28.380
So what shorting means is basically in traditional stocks, when you go long, it means you're

04:28.380 --> 04:31.080
betting on stock is going to raise in price.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.280
So you buy low and you sell high.

04:33.280 --> 04:36.240
Well, short is basically the opposite.

04:36.240 --> 04:42.920
So you buy, you borrow a stock from somebody, you sell it immediately in the hopes that

04:42.920 --> 04:48.560
it goes down and then you buy it again low and return the stock that you borrowed.

04:48.560 --> 04:52.680
And then you make the money based off the amount that the stock dropped.

04:52.680 --> 04:59.360
Well, what happened was is that these hedge funds did what's almost called like a naked

04:59.360 --> 05:02.760
short where they overshorted the stock 140%.

05:03.600 --> 05:08.800
Now you're wondering how the hell do you sell more stocks than exist?

05:08.800 --> 05:16.320
It's because that they're basically, you know, hedge fund A, you know, has a stock and hedge

05:16.320 --> 05:22.400
fund B borrows that stock and then immediately sells it to hedge fund C, which then borrows,

05:22.400 --> 05:26.120
you know, hedge fund D borrows it from C, you know, it's so keeps going.

05:26.120 --> 05:31.120
So you end up getting these multiples and what they do that for is to drop the value

05:31.120 --> 05:32.120
of the stock.

05:32.120 --> 05:36.840
So they will buy up a lot of these, they'll short them and you to a great extent to drop

05:36.840 --> 05:43.240
the price of the stock down to make money and then sell it once it goes low.

05:43.240 --> 05:48.000
I did address this a little bit last week using turnips as an example, just as a reminder,

05:48.000 --> 05:52.760
because this is where we all learned about the stonks this year.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.560
Actually, I learned about it in high school.

05:55.560 --> 05:56.560
Well, okay.

05:56.560 --> 05:57.560
We played the stock market.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.160
But did you, did you actually, and I think a lot of economics classes probably did the

06:02.160 --> 06:08.760
fake stock market, but I don't know a lot of people who have put their own money in

06:08.760 --> 06:09.760
the stock market.

06:09.760 --> 06:13.720
I'm talking outside of 401ks and things that kind of like retirement plans do free do for

06:13.720 --> 06:14.720
you.

06:14.720 --> 06:15.720
I've invested.

06:15.720 --> 06:16.720
Yeah.

06:16.720 --> 06:17.720
Yeah.

06:17.720 --> 06:18.720
Yeah.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.320
I invested in the place in which I work.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.320
Okay.

06:21.320 --> 06:27.520
Well, there's a lot of, there's a lot of people who have not had any experience with any of

06:27.520 --> 06:30.520
that until like animal crossing.

06:30.520 --> 06:35.680
I think really like kind of started getting people like, oh, you know, and I think everybody

06:35.680 --> 06:40.000
kind of knew like, oh, it's a cute little play on the stock market.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
What's happening there.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.920
But you know, then this started happening.

06:43.920 --> 06:48.360
And now that everybody is having to like, okay, somebody, why the fuck do I keep hearing

06:48.360 --> 06:49.960
about GameStop in the news?

06:49.960 --> 06:51.260
What the hell is going on?

06:51.260 --> 06:56.320
So many people have had to like, and I'm going to use this term, dumb it down.

06:56.320 --> 06:58.040
And believe me, there's a lot in my life.

06:58.040 --> 06:59.960
I've needed to make it accessible, dumb down.

06:59.960 --> 07:00.960
Okay, sure.

07:00.960 --> 07:01.960
Make it accessible.

07:01.960 --> 07:02.960
Explain it to me.

07:02.960 --> 07:03.960
Like I'm five.

07:03.960 --> 07:04.960
That whole thing.

07:04.960 --> 07:05.960
Right.

07:05.960 --> 07:09.960
So there's been so many people having to explain this, what's going on to people.

07:09.960 --> 07:10.960
Yeah.

07:10.960 --> 07:15.960
So basically what's happening now is so like you would rent a game from blockbuster back

07:15.960 --> 07:18.240
in the day.

07:18.240 --> 07:21.160
Eventually that game is due back.

07:21.160 --> 07:27.360
And so what happens is, is if, for example, you have a community like wall street bets

07:27.360 --> 07:32.360
that sees, Hey, look at this stock is short at 140%.

07:32.360 --> 07:36.920
They're going to have to buy that one, you know, eventually to recoup those socks to

07:36.920 --> 07:38.480
return them.

07:38.480 --> 07:42.080
We're just going to purchase a bunch of these stocks and drive the price high.

07:42.080 --> 07:45.960
So what that does is because they're shorting it and the only way they make money is if

07:45.960 --> 07:51.140
it drops in price, they could lose an infinite amount of money because they have to buy it

07:51.140 --> 07:52.660
at some point.

07:52.660 --> 07:57.040
And so what the goal is now is there's so many people buying the stock, it's driving

07:57.040 --> 08:01.180
the price up much, much, much higher than they anticipated.

08:01.180 --> 08:07.180
So these hedge funds are losing billions of dollars and everybody's making quite a bit

08:07.180 --> 08:12.420
of money off of it because these shares, which were originally like, you know, four or $5

08:12.420 --> 08:16.340
each are now $400, $500 each.

08:16.340 --> 08:20.100
And so, I mean, that's a quite, quite the return on investment.

08:20.100 --> 08:24.100
And so what happened, what's happening now though, is because there's no shares to really

08:24.100 --> 08:25.100
buy back.

08:25.100 --> 08:27.780
And even when they do buy it back, I think it's going to drive the price up a little

08:27.780 --> 08:31.740
bit is they have, it's called a short squeeze.

08:31.740 --> 08:34.460
And so really it's just going to skyrocket the stock.

08:34.460 --> 08:35.660
That's why everybody's holding it.

08:35.660 --> 08:37.740
They're not selling their positions.

08:37.740 --> 08:41.440
And so it's just going to keep driving the price up and up and up and up.

08:41.440 --> 08:46.460
And so this week you saw a lot of bullshit with like Robinhood preventing people from

08:46.460 --> 08:48.600
actually buying stock.

08:48.600 --> 08:52.600
There was, you know, they were only allowing you to sell it.

08:52.600 --> 08:59.080
They were different brokers that were basically limiting the amount of trades you can do.

08:59.080 --> 09:05.280
And it was one of those rare things that like politicians on all sides of the spectrum agreed

09:05.280 --> 09:11.640
on was that that, that move that Robinhood pulled was sus as hell basically.

09:11.640 --> 09:17.680
And that led to a whole Twitch stream that AOC did, right, Monday night or something

09:17.680 --> 09:19.960
where she was, and I don't even think she was playing a game.

09:19.960 --> 09:20.960
I missed it.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.900
Sorry, I had a conflict, but I don't even think she was playing a game this time.

09:23.900 --> 09:28.520
I think she went on, she just did like a talking, she had guests and things like that.

09:28.520 --> 09:31.480
But she just kind of had a talk about it, which was interesting.

09:31.480 --> 09:37.000
And then of course, I'm sure you all saw, you know, Ted Cruz tried to agree with her

09:37.000 --> 09:41.920
and then in response AOC definitely like snatched his fucking wig and threw it in the garbage.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.760
But I think he kind of deserved it.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.240
But anyway, I won't go there.

09:45.240 --> 09:51.880
But still, you had people on both sides that were both saying, you know, Robinhood, what

09:51.880 --> 09:52.960
they did was sus.

09:52.960 --> 09:56.240
And there's all sorts of market manipulation going on.

09:56.240 --> 10:00.600
You know, obviously, there's different CNBC has been, you know, accusing the folks on

10:00.600 --> 10:06.420
Wall Street bets of manipulating the market, not even really calling out the hedge funds

10:06.420 --> 10:07.800
that are over shorting it.

10:07.800 --> 10:13.440
And then on top of that, they've been, you know, conveying fake information.

10:13.440 --> 10:18.840
So they've been saying that these hedge funds have already settled their shares, which you

10:18.840 --> 10:21.920
can look at the data and see, no, that's not the case.

10:21.920 --> 10:26.300
So they're trying to put it out there that, oh, yeah, yeah, they've already bought their

10:26.300 --> 10:27.300
shares back.

10:27.300 --> 10:28.300
You guys won.

10:28.300 --> 10:31.160
You can sell your stock now trying to drive the price down.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.800
But it's so manipulative.

10:33.800 --> 10:37.440
It does make you think and, you know, I'm kind of watching chat and I want to get to

10:37.440 --> 10:38.440
some of that stuff in chat.

10:38.440 --> 10:40.400
But I got two things I want to address here real quick.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.120
And then, Loki, if you have anything else you want to add.

10:43.120 --> 10:46.400
The first thing I want to address is, well, how is this still relevant to gaming?

10:46.400 --> 10:48.800
You know that you're a video game podcast, Orange Launch Radio.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.200
Why are you still talking about this?

10:50.200 --> 10:53.880
Because this is just this just tangentially involves GameStop at this point.

10:53.880 --> 10:58.880
And I would argue, I think it was gaming culture that actually played into this whole thing

10:58.880 --> 11:02.800
and allowed it to happen because, like you said, there was this Reddit community that

11:02.800 --> 11:08.200
observed that there was this trend that was happening on Wall Street of this stock shorting.

11:08.200 --> 11:13.120
And, you know, the rumor came through or the buzz or the tip that some of the hedge funds

11:13.120 --> 11:15.800
were going to be doing this with GameStop stock.

11:15.800 --> 11:22.920
I almost want to say stonk instinctively now, but GameStop stonk, stock, God.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.200
They were going to be doing it with that.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.560
And that was the point where there were several people on Reddit and it was that, you know,

11:27.560 --> 11:31.800
kind of pebble that started the avalanche that said, no, you're not going to do this

11:31.800 --> 11:34.280
to my company, my childhood.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.960
You know, for better or for worse, when it comes to GameStop.

11:37.040 --> 11:40.440
I've certainly had my fair share of criticism about them in the past.

11:40.440 --> 11:43.040
They've done a lot of weird shit, you know, over the years.

11:43.040 --> 11:48.320
But I can also recognize, you know, they have really been kind of stepping on it in the

11:48.320 --> 11:51.160
past year to really try to turn shit around.

11:51.160 --> 11:55.000
Hence the Reggie Fils-Aime on the board story we had not that long ago.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.240
And then we had this guy from Chewy, right?

11:57.240 --> 11:58.720
He was like the CEO or something.

11:58.720 --> 12:03.960
I'm sorry, I might be misstating positions, but he and that was that was the big story.

12:03.960 --> 12:06.680
He put his own money into it.

12:06.760 --> 12:10.120
And that was the thing that Reddit kind of tailgated with.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.120
Right.

12:11.120 --> 12:14.440
So why they're going to make reasons why they believe in the stock.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.920
It's not just, oh, it's because it's over shorted.

12:16.920 --> 12:18.160
They don't really like the company.

12:18.160 --> 12:24.600
It's that they they legitimately think that, you know, it's a decent stock and that's undervalued.

12:24.600 --> 12:27.120
And so that's why they were investing in it.

12:27.120 --> 12:32.120
And a lot of these folks, you know, like, for example, the guy that kind of led the

12:32.120 --> 12:38.640
charge, I guess, who goes by the username Deep Fucking Value, he he actually invested

12:38.640 --> 12:39.640
back in 2019.

12:39.640 --> 12:43.520
He's actually been talking about it for, you know, a while now.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.560
So this isn't like a brand new thing.

12:45.560 --> 12:51.320
Oh, so the best story I've seen on this whole thing, the best is that there was this kid

12:51.320 --> 12:53.440
like seven or eight years old, maybe 10.

12:53.440 --> 12:58.200
So I don't remember the age, but I remember reading he got as a Kwanzaa gift.

12:58.200 --> 13:05.160
His aunt bought him 10 shares of GameStop stock like a year or two ago when he graduated

13:05.160 --> 13:08.480
elementary school or something, I don't know, some type of like, you know, and it was a

13:08.480 --> 13:13.320
cute thing, because, you know, because GameStop stock back then was like five, six bucks.

13:13.320 --> 13:14.320
Right.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.920
My grandma always got me a savings bond every Christmas, every birthday.

13:16.920 --> 13:17.920
Right.

13:17.920 --> 13:20.660
That was her little like, I'm going to teach you about investment.

13:20.660 --> 13:25.240
But for this family, the the answer, whoever it was, I'm sorry, I don't have the article

13:25.240 --> 13:30.200
in front of me, bought 10 shares of GameStop stock, which at the time was not worth that

13:30.200 --> 13:31.200
much.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.240
It was six dollars a share, maybe.

13:32.240 --> 13:37.600
So the kid gets like and the kid gets informational pamphlets about GameStop and all this stuff.

13:37.600 --> 13:41.440
And now it was just in the news when GameStop hit like three hundred fifty dollars this

13:41.440 --> 13:45.620
week or whatever it was, they were like, OK, maybe, you know, they let the kid decide,

13:45.620 --> 13:47.860
but the kid decided to sell.

13:47.860 --> 13:49.520
And, you know, that's great news.

13:49.520 --> 13:53.800
You love to see a 10 year old make three thousand dollars and learn about the stock market in

13:53.800 --> 13:54.800
the process.

13:55.360 --> 13:59.880
And the cool thing was they took two thousand to do something about like paying for school

13:59.880 --> 14:00.880
and some of that.

14:00.880 --> 14:04.120
But they're going to take the other thousand and reinvest as a family.

14:04.120 --> 14:08.680
And I thought that was a neat little like family learns how to play the stock market

14:08.680 --> 14:09.680
type of story.

14:09.680 --> 14:10.680
It was really touching.

14:10.680 --> 14:11.680
I think.

14:11.680 --> 14:12.680
Yeah.

14:12.680 --> 14:15.600
And there's been a lot of these like kind of different people investing in it as well

14:15.600 --> 14:21.800
and taking the money that they've made from that and, you know, paying for consoles for

14:21.800 --> 14:27.080
hospitals and buying stuff for first responders and stuff like that.

14:27.080 --> 14:32.080
So, you know, and stories of people being able to raise enough money to pay for surgeries

14:32.080 --> 14:37.300
and health care, whatever the case may be, paying off their student loans, buying a house,

14:37.300 --> 14:41.320
you know, just, you know, stuff that is like night and day for them.

14:41.320 --> 14:42.880
It's changed their life.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.700
So it's pretty incredible.

14:45.700 --> 14:51.320
This isn't the only stock to the AMC was another one that they've been doing with Blackberry

14:51.840 --> 14:52.840
on.

14:52.840 --> 14:53.840
I don't remember the other one.

14:53.840 --> 14:54.840
Nokia was another one.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.140
I think Nokia.

14:56.140 --> 14:58.440
So there's been several that they've been doing this with.

14:58.440 --> 15:02.880
And it's just it's kind of ironic, though, that you see these billionaires now, you know,

15:02.880 --> 15:05.040
complaining, oh, you guys are manipulating the market.

15:05.040 --> 15:09.000
It's like they were doing the same thing.

15:09.000 --> 15:15.360
There's like some some old video clips online of whether the guy that's behind that show

15:15.360 --> 15:21.300
Mad Money or whatever, talking about how he he used to be with a hedge fund and how the

15:21.300 --> 15:27.020
manipulated stock prices and stuff by like literally passing off fake news to like different

15:27.020 --> 15:29.620
outlets and stuff to get people scared.

15:29.620 --> 15:30.620
Can we talk about that?

15:30.620 --> 15:35.380
Because this is where the chat is going, because another thing that really pushed this GameStop

15:35.380 --> 15:40.020
stock thing that really kind of pushed it forward was, you know, whether you love the

15:40.020 --> 15:43.140
guy or hate the guy, Elon Musk tweeted about it.

15:43.140 --> 15:44.540
And he's got a lot of followers.

15:44.540 --> 15:48.660
He has a lot of influence, especially when it comes to finances.

15:48.660 --> 15:51.260
And he's tweeted about this multiple times.

15:51.260 --> 15:55.300
And he tweeted about the Dogecoin thing, which is a whole other that really is outside of

15:55.300 --> 15:56.300
gaming news.

15:56.300 --> 15:59.540
But it's it's kind of like that whole Dogecoin thing.

15:59.540 --> 16:04.140
The most I'll say about that is that it is showing that this GameStop thing is not the

16:04.140 --> 16:05.660
end of it.

16:05.660 --> 16:07.980
This is going to be something that continues.

16:07.980 --> 16:08.980
How long it continues?

16:08.980 --> 16:09.980
I don't know.

16:09.980 --> 16:15.020
But anyway, my point is and the reason why Elon Musk, assumably, maybe gets involved

16:15.020 --> 16:16.020
in this whole thing.

16:16.020 --> 16:19.300
What does he give a shit about GameStop about all this, besides maybe that he's invested

16:19.300 --> 16:20.300
his own money?

16:20.340 --> 16:21.340
Yeah.

16:21.340 --> 16:25.260
But do you know another very popular company with the short sellers that they love to short

16:25.260 --> 16:26.660
sell the stock with?

16:26.660 --> 16:28.300
It's Tesla.

16:28.300 --> 16:33.180
So I'm sure Elon Musk is looking at these guys going, fuck those guys, because they

16:33.180 --> 16:34.180
fuck with me.

16:34.180 --> 16:35.420
And then we saw it in chat.

16:35.420 --> 16:37.700
They're talking about, you know, Bobby, there's.

16:37.700 --> 16:38.700
Go ahead.

16:38.700 --> 16:44.220
Well, I'm just saying that this is a big show that basically this is all being manipulated

16:44.220 --> 16:46.060
behind closed doors.

16:46.060 --> 16:49.780
And people shouldn't, you know, go back, going back to another statement that the stock

16:49.780 --> 16:52.940
market is not indicative of the economy, really.

16:52.940 --> 16:53.940
Right.

16:53.940 --> 16:57.900
But it makes you think, going back to the whole like fake story thing, you know, how

16:57.900 --> 17:03.940
hard has they've tried to push that narrative about the Tesla autopilot is like a murderous

17:03.940 --> 17:07.860
rampage car out of hell type of thing going on?

17:07.860 --> 17:09.660
You know, I mean, sure.

17:09.660 --> 17:12.880
It sounds like there's, you know, some issues, but I don't.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.980
It's one of those things where it seems like this, you know, and again, it's Christine.

17:15.980 --> 17:20.380
Where, you know, Bobby is actually shown the opposite to be true with his video over

17:20.380 --> 17:21.380
the VOG Network, YouTube.

17:21.380 --> 17:25.020
No, I think it might be on his personal YouTube, but whatever the wherever it is, it actually

17:25.020 --> 17:31.100
shows like how autopilot actually saved him in an accident, you know.

17:31.100 --> 17:37.940
So my point is it makes you stop and think all of these stories about the narrative behind

17:37.940 --> 17:39.780
companies about Tesla.

17:39.780 --> 17:48.980
And here's how this is gaming news, folks, are the negative stories behind GameStop fake?

17:48.980 --> 17:50.680
That's what this is all leading to now.

17:50.680 --> 17:53.660
You know, where there's where there's smoke, there's fire.

17:53.660 --> 17:55.300
And y'all have set foot in a GameStop.

17:55.300 --> 18:03.020
I would I wouldn't say it's all fake, but yeah, how much of it how much of it has maybe

18:03.020 --> 18:06.380
been blown up a little bit.

18:06.380 --> 18:07.380
It makes you wonder.

18:07.980 --> 18:13.060
Well, the other thing, too, you have folks that are still like they're absolutely pissed

18:13.060 --> 18:18.740
about, you know, the last economic crisis they were in from 2008 where the stock market

18:18.740 --> 18:24.980
crashed and, you know, how the government bailed out these, you know, banks and everything

18:24.980 --> 18:29.380
and how literally you have the people, you know, on Wall Street, these hedge fund folks,

18:29.380 --> 18:34.180
you know, celebrating with champagne while the Occupy Wall Street folks were down below,

18:34.180 --> 18:35.820
you know, protesting everything.

18:35.860 --> 18:38.620
So now a lot of these people, it's like this is personal.

18:38.620 --> 18:39.620
I'm buying the stock.

18:39.620 --> 18:43.180
I don't care if it goes to zero, if it means that these hedge funds are going to lose millions

18:43.180 --> 18:45.900
of dollars, it's worth the price of admission.

18:45.900 --> 18:48.900
So a lot of these folks are just, you know, investing because of that.

18:48.900 --> 18:52.460
They're like, I don't care if I lose, you know, what it really to them.

18:52.460 --> 18:57.100
I mean, the amount that they're investing, there's a finite amount that you can lose

18:57.100 --> 18:58.100
there.

18:58.100 --> 19:02.020
It's, you know, whatever you invested in, whereas the shorts, there is no cap for that.

19:02.020 --> 19:03.980
They can keep going.

19:04.020 --> 19:09.020
So the longer they hold onto it, the more that they lose and the higher it goes.

19:09.020 --> 19:10.020
Yeah.

19:10.020 --> 19:15.180
Uh, anything you want to add to this, Jamie, what you, from what you're watching and seeing?

19:15.180 --> 19:16.940
Not, not really.

19:16.940 --> 19:22.380
I mean, there's, I'm still in kind of this wait and see mode right now, you know, just

19:22.380 --> 19:26.460
because it is, I mean, we've been talking about this yet for two weeks, but it's still

19:26.460 --> 19:27.500
in early stages.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.940
I think, I think that there's going to be a lot that comes out of the woodwork and I

19:30.940 --> 19:35.620
know a lot of, you know, the news that we consume is manipulated.

19:35.620 --> 19:40.300
I mean, I always tell people that if you're going to look at one news source, look at

19:40.300 --> 19:47.100
five others, including one that is, uh, an opposing source, you know, it's like, I tell

19:47.100 --> 19:51.740
my mother, you know, okay, link me all this red new stuff, but I want you to also go and

19:51.740 --> 19:53.180
read all this other stuff too.

19:53.180 --> 19:58.100
You know, you have to be able to see the big picture and don't necessarily look to American

19:58.100 --> 19:59.100
news sources.

19:59.100 --> 20:00.100
Just saying.

20:00.100 --> 20:01.100
Oh, sorry.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.100
Go ahead.

20:02.100 --> 20:09.300
Well, just, just that, um, the biggest thing about it is that go into this with your eyes

20:09.300 --> 20:11.300
open.

20:11.300 --> 20:15.220
Don't expect all of the truth to come out.

20:15.220 --> 20:18.840
It's they're going to try, you know, things go really sour on this.

20:18.840 --> 20:25.380
They're going to try to sweep it under, um, it's just another, another sign that the,

20:25.380 --> 20:31.060
the stock market is inherently, uh, a corrupt establishment.

20:31.060 --> 20:32.060
Hmm.

20:32.060 --> 20:36.020
Um, I want to read some of these comments about the Tesla thing that Bobby is saying

20:36.020 --> 20:37.020
in our chat.

20:37.020 --> 20:41.260
Cause it is very interesting about, you know, uh, how much is the news, you know, altered

20:41.260 --> 20:42.260
perhaps.

20:42.260 --> 20:43.540
Um, Bobby is, he's saying a lot in chat.

20:43.540 --> 20:44.980
I'm just going to read some of the comments.

20:44.980 --> 20:50.500
Um, the video I made on YouTube actually got a lot of press with the shorts, mostly calling

20:50.500 --> 20:52.220
me a dumb ass fan boy.

20:52.220 --> 20:56.860
There were rebuttals on auto websites and calls for me to have my driver's license revoked.

20:56.860 --> 20:58.500
It was wild.

20:58.500 --> 21:03.540
And so, because Bobby was trying to say something good about, yeah, because Bobby was saying

21:03.540 --> 21:08.980
something good about, but it also shows that just like that hyperactivity of the internet

21:08.980 --> 21:14.020
in general, when it comes to everything, when it comes to politics, when it comes to gaming,

21:14.020 --> 21:18.940
fuck, look at the replies to any Xbox or Sony post.

21:18.940 --> 21:25.300
The first couple of replies are always like, fuck Xbox, Sony's better or fuck Sony, Microsoft's

21:25.300 --> 21:26.300
better.

21:26.300 --> 21:29.740
And like, shut up.

21:29.740 --> 21:34.820
Like I, I can't believe I'm saying this because this is the show where every gamer has a voice,

21:34.820 --> 21:39.060
but like gamers of a certain maturity level.

21:39.060 --> 21:43.380
I think I'm getting to the point where it's like, I am not interested in hearing from

21:43.380 --> 21:47.340
these people on Twitter because I don't think they're actually gamers, but that's a whole

21:47.340 --> 21:49.820
nother, I guess, debate.

21:49.820 --> 21:50.820
You know.

21:50.820 --> 21:55.300
I still think that we have an unspoken caveat with every gamer.

21:55.300 --> 22:00.900
I'd say there's definitely, we don't have room for hateful voices here.

22:00.900 --> 22:01.900
Yes, absolutely.

22:01.900 --> 22:02.900
Yeah.

22:02.900 --> 22:05.940
There is a little bit of a caveat there and there always has been, and if you don't like

22:05.940 --> 22:06.940
it, tough.

22:06.940 --> 22:07.940
Get my ass.

22:07.940 --> 22:10.420
Don't, you might have rabies.

22:10.420 --> 22:12.660
Bobby continues, they're too busy bitching about games.

22:12.660 --> 22:14.740
They have no time left to play games.

22:14.740 --> 22:17.460
Fifth Dream says we're non-toxic gamers have a voice.

22:17.460 --> 22:18.460
Yes.

22:18.460 --> 22:19.460
There's that.

22:19.460 --> 22:22.500
Questbuster says, I'm only surprised that what happened with GameStop didn't happen

22:22.500 --> 22:23.500
sooner.

22:23.500 --> 22:26.500
That is interesting that it kind of like took this long and I don't know if it's something

22:26.500 --> 22:31.140
about the pandemic or if it's just something about, you know, again, people's childhood

22:31.140 --> 22:35.560
and GameStop in particular or what it is, but I guess it was just this perfect storm

22:35.560 --> 22:37.220
that allowed this to happen now.

22:37.220 --> 22:43.100
I'm going to admit, and maybe I shouldn't talk about this on OLR, but I will, I didn't

22:43.100 --> 22:49.020
get into the whole GameStop thing because I kind of felt like it's probably too late.

22:49.020 --> 22:50.360
Like that's just my own personal opinion.

22:50.360 --> 22:55.580
Like I kind of feel like late if I went, did you invest in the GameStop thing?

22:55.580 --> 22:56.580
Loki?

22:56.580 --> 22:57.580
Not yet.

22:57.580 --> 23:01.140
Um, Monday I will though, because my account, like it takes a long time for everything.

23:01.140 --> 23:05.820
Um, I was able to get in on AMC because you can do that through cash app actually.

23:05.820 --> 23:10.020
So you can open an account through cash app, transfer stuff almost immediately and you

23:10.020 --> 23:11.020
can buy certain stocks.

23:11.020 --> 23:15.460
They don't have GameStop on there, which is unfortunate if I did AMC and I'm up a little

23:15.460 --> 23:16.460
bit there.

23:16.460 --> 23:21.460
Um, I plan on getting in on Doge as well on Monday, um, just for the hell of it.

23:21.460 --> 23:23.640
I got a Dogecoin somewhere.

23:23.640 --> 23:26.500
Because if you think about like, I didn't really, you shouldn't, I should have done

23:26.500 --> 23:31.860
it a long time ago, but like really it's like a fret back when it was like a fraction of

23:31.860 --> 23:32.860
a penny.

23:32.860 --> 23:34.300
It's like, it can really only go up.

23:34.300 --> 23:36.820
I mean, it's just, it is very volatile.

23:36.820 --> 23:38.980
It's going up and down, but you just buy sell.

23:38.980 --> 23:43.080
I mean, I don't know, this is more interesting for me, like considering that, like when the

23:43.080 --> 23:48.020
lottery was up to a billion dollars, like I can, I can remember how many lottery tickets

23:48.020 --> 23:52.380
I bought each week that came, I'm like, damn, I could just put that money into the stock

23:52.380 --> 23:53.380
market.

23:53.380 --> 23:56.500
At least that's a little bit more, you know, that's it.

23:56.500 --> 24:00.420
And by the way, you have chatters that are advising you against the Doge thing, but you

24:00.420 --> 24:01.420
know, make your own decision.

24:01.420 --> 24:05.620
But I didn't really finish my thought, but I will say, uh, I did not get into the stock

24:05.620 --> 24:06.620
thing.

24:06.620 --> 24:09.020
I got into the first cryptocurrency this week and it was not Doge.

24:09.020 --> 24:10.260
It was different one.

24:10.260 --> 24:13.980
Um, but I, you know, I made my own, I kind of did my own research and made my own decision.

24:13.980 --> 24:17.940
I didn't spend a lot, but it was, it's just, it's exactly Loki's reasoning right there

24:17.940 --> 24:23.980
that, that's 50 bucks right now, it's because they're blocking people from buying it right

24:23.980 --> 24:24.980
now.

24:24.980 --> 24:29.620
The apps that used to like Robinhood, another app that you can buy Doge in, they block people

24:29.620 --> 24:32.660
from buying Doge right now.

24:32.660 --> 24:36.060
And a lot of, I know AMC is down a little bit as well.

24:36.060 --> 24:41.980
But once again, I don't invest money that I don't expect to lose if, if it, if we lose

24:41.980 --> 24:42.980
it, we lose it.

24:42.980 --> 24:43.980
You know, that was my thing.

24:43.980 --> 24:44.980
That's the point.

24:44.980 --> 24:49.900
I put in 50 bucks, which would have been my Reno gambling money in a, in a normal world.

24:49.900 --> 24:51.540
You know, I'm not putting in a ton of money.

24:51.540 --> 24:53.180
I know better than that.

24:53.180 --> 24:58.100
I'm just saying it's, it's money that like, it's not going to make a, it's no big deal

24:58.100 --> 24:59.420
if I lose it.

24:59.420 --> 25:00.420
Yeah.

25:00.420 --> 25:05.420
And Bobby and Chats says, yeah, I'm considering learning about the stock market in the same

25:05.420 --> 25:06.820
way I go to a casino.

25:06.820 --> 25:11.140
I set aside money and I say, I will never see this money again and use that.

25:11.140 --> 25:13.280
And Quest Buster says, Loki is investing right.

25:13.280 --> 25:16.200
Don't invest in anything that you can't afford to lose.

25:16.200 --> 25:19.660
And so Jamie, you're saying, I don't want to lose anything, so I'm just not playing

25:19.660 --> 25:20.660
this game.

25:20.660 --> 25:21.660
And that's fine too.

25:21.660 --> 25:28.300
I know, I know that, that mine is invested in a very stable business that is not losing

25:28.300 --> 25:34.860
money in most of its markets, that has split several times in the last few years and the

25:34.860 --> 25:37.940
value has of course gone up incredibly.

25:37.940 --> 25:43.220
So yeah, I'm pretty happy and, and for the record, I do all of my buying and selling

25:43.220 --> 25:44.220
through E-Trade.

25:44.220 --> 25:45.660
So yeah.

25:45.660 --> 25:49.500
And I have, I've used one of those micro investing apps.

25:49.500 --> 25:52.060
I'm not going to give them a free ad, but basically it's one of those apps where you

25:52.060 --> 25:55.420
put a little bit of money into it and they, it's a little bit more of a traditional like

25:55.420 --> 25:57.180
stock portfolio type of thing.

25:57.180 --> 26:02.060
But again, that's money that would have been extra Starbucks trips during the workday that

26:02.060 --> 26:03.960
I'm not doing right now.

26:03.960 --> 26:04.960
So there's that.

26:04.960 --> 26:10.720
And yeah, I have a 401k and I've had one for a while, so.

26:10.720 --> 26:15.720
Like Bobby was saying, there's companies that also pay dividends, which mine is set up that

26:15.720 --> 26:16.720
way.

26:16.720 --> 26:20.600
And my dividends get reinvested into the same stock.

26:20.600 --> 26:24.000
I mean, I could put it in something else if I wanted to, or I could cash that out if I

26:24.000 --> 26:25.480
wanted to.

26:25.480 --> 26:33.320
But I'll tell you what, you know, having that money there from my payouts has been, it saved

26:33.320 --> 26:36.760
our tail a couple of times, you know, when we needed that money and we made sure that

26:36.760 --> 26:40.920
we, you know, and the thing is, is that the company, as I said before, it's the company

26:40.920 --> 26:44.080
I work at, which no one gets to know.

26:44.080 --> 26:50.040
But because it's so stable and performing so well, I can basically say, okay, I need

26:50.040 --> 26:54.900
three grand for this and I can go in there and get that three grand and it will have

26:54.900 --> 26:58.920
refilled itself in three to six months.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.320
So or replaced itself.

27:00.320 --> 27:06.040
Well, I mean, I will say this, too, about all this story and everything is that I think,

27:06.040 --> 27:10.200
you know, through this whole experience, and I think video games are to credit in part

27:10.200 --> 27:11.200
for this.

27:11.200 --> 27:14.680
Yes, we all learned about the stock market and economics in high school, but how much

27:14.680 --> 27:19.800
did we really get practical knowledge and use it until the year we were all stuck at

27:19.800 --> 27:23.460
home and had to play Animal Crossing because there was nothing else to do?

27:23.460 --> 27:25.600
And which honestly, it hasn't ended.

27:25.600 --> 27:29.080
I mean, I realize some parts of the country people think it has, but it hasn't.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.920
The lights at the end of the tunnel, we're not there yet.

27:31.920 --> 27:36.360
But I almost wonder how much of that kind of enabled some of this.

27:36.360 --> 27:41.560
And now with this all over and this getting meme-ified all over Twitter, all over Facebook,

27:41.560 --> 27:45.140
all over social media, I really think we're moving towards something where you're going

27:45.140 --> 27:50.220
to see more common people that are investing in the stock market through these apps and

27:50.220 --> 27:54.160
things that let you kind of cherry pick what you want to do.

27:54.160 --> 27:58.760
I think it's and I think video games are a big part of that.

27:59.120 --> 28:00.120
They really are.

28:00.120 --> 28:01.320
So, yeah.

28:01.320 --> 28:07.280
So when I was in my economics class, we had to do that stock market thing, create portfolio.

28:07.280 --> 28:12.320
So I spent all my money on penny stocks and then they doubled in price and I made a ton

28:12.320 --> 28:13.320
of money.

28:13.320 --> 28:15.880
So I'm doing the same thing.

28:15.880 --> 28:16.880
You know what we did?

28:16.880 --> 28:17.880
Good luck.

28:17.880 --> 28:18.880
What did you do?

28:18.880 --> 28:28.400
We invested in Intel in 94 and in a funeral home and I'll tell you why.

28:29.040 --> 28:32.760
Keep in mind, this is Jamie the Goth and the funeral home was my idea.

28:32.760 --> 28:39.920
It was like a company of funeral homes, like a franchise, but kind of.

28:39.920 --> 28:44.280
I was like, look, people die every day.

28:44.280 --> 28:46.400
They're always going to have business.

28:46.400 --> 28:52.840
I've never seen a funeral home, at least any type of related chain, a funeral home ever

28:52.840 --> 28:54.680
go out of business.

28:55.200 --> 28:59.880
I don't want to be disgusting, but you can't help but notice, especially with this past

28:59.880 --> 29:01.720
year and everything that's happened.

29:01.720 --> 29:05.840
Like if you owned a lot of those stocks, you're probably doing pretty well.

29:05.840 --> 29:10.520
Or if you were in the government and bought in on like, was it, I think there was some

29:10.520 --> 29:12.920
of the PPE and body bags and stuff like that.

29:12.920 --> 29:16.800
They were investing in that because they knew that the numbers were going to go up.

29:16.800 --> 29:17.960
I mean, it's gross.

29:17.960 --> 29:19.680
I'm sorry, but that's the reality.

29:20.240 --> 29:25.480
Anyway, I always half wondered if the tyrant had investments in that, and that's why we

29:25.480 --> 29:32.600
never had a lot of our, any good legislation on it, but that was a little conspiracy of mine.

29:32.600 --> 29:36.600
If only we could actually investigate those types of things, but anyhow, we won't go there.

29:38.680 --> 29:41.760
Anyway, I'm looking forward to the eighth and I'll leave it at that.

29:43.600 --> 29:48.080
So anything else we want to say about the stonks and all that, and that goes for you

29:48.080 --> 29:49.080
guys in chat as well.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.840
Yeah, Bobby's saying, I should have invested in zoom a year ago.

29:52.840 --> 29:57.560
I don't think they had their IPO yet at that time, but certainly comparable companies,

29:57.560 --> 30:00.560
WebEx, you know, Cisco.

30:00.560 --> 30:06.080
One thing I need to repeat what Bobby said, because this is very important, is that we

30:06.080 --> 30:09.440
are not financial advisors.

30:09.440 --> 30:12.360
We don't do any of that.

30:12.360 --> 30:14.040
You know, that's not what we do.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.040
We're not giving legal advice.

30:15.040 --> 30:16.920
We're not giving financial advice.

30:16.920 --> 30:19.840
So do what you will with what we say.

30:19.840 --> 30:22.920
This is our opinion on the matter.

30:22.920 --> 30:29.080
You know, so again, do what you will with what we've shared with you, with our experiences

30:29.080 --> 30:34.880
on it, but certainly educate yourself completely before you dive into something like this.

30:34.880 --> 30:36.400
Just don't do it on a whim.

30:36.400 --> 30:37.400
Yeah.

30:37.400 --> 30:41.200
It's sad that we need that disclaimer, but I understand why completely.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.520
So I would hope all that's obvious.

30:42.520 --> 30:44.760
Yes, of course we are not financial advisors.

30:44.760 --> 30:49.280
We're just, we're just schmoes in our basement, but, um, so are all the people that are starting

30:49.280 --> 30:51.200
a wall street revolution right now.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.200
So congrats.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.040
Let's just be honest.

30:54.040 --> 30:59.040
Like I, like the whole reason I played a lot of, cause I know it's like an insanely, no

30:59.040 --> 31:02.360
way you're going to win any of that stuff, but like, I'm just like at that point right

31:02.360 --> 31:06.320
now with my job and everything, like, I just don't want to do it anymore.

31:06.320 --> 31:09.640
I just don't want to do work anymore.

31:09.640 --> 31:12.720
My mom always said, my mom always said it costs a dollar to dream.

31:12.720 --> 31:13.720
So go get the lotto ticket.

31:13.720 --> 31:20.000
And so like at this point, like I just want to have an active, like just something that

31:20.000 --> 31:22.120
I'm doing to try to make things better.

31:22.120 --> 31:23.120
Like I get it.

31:23.120 --> 31:28.300
Like, yeah, you could lose some money on stuff, but if you do, like, if you just be careful

31:28.300 --> 31:33.540
with what you're doing and you don't try to overextend yourself, then maybe you can make

31:33.540 --> 31:35.520
some small gains here and there and stuff.

31:35.520 --> 31:38.120
And maybe you do get lucky with some of this stuff.

31:38.120 --> 31:41.880
It's ironic because I actually thought about investing in GameStop a while back because

31:41.880 --> 31:45.680
I was like, well, maybe I should throw some money in the stock market because my 401k

31:45.680 --> 31:48.920
portfolio is not doing that, you know, hot, you know, why not?

31:48.920 --> 31:50.760
And their stock's pretty cheap.

31:50.760 --> 31:54.680
So should have done that, but oh, well, what are you going to do?

31:54.680 --> 31:55.680
Yeah.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.160
All right.

31:57.160 --> 31:58.720
Let's go ahead and move on.

31:58.720 --> 32:03.000
Let's talk about other things that we escape to when we don't want to work anymore.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.280
And that is video games.

32:04.280 --> 32:06.600
So let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks.

32:06.600 --> 32:08.160
So dark soccer, I'll start with you.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.280
How was your gaming week?

32:09.680 --> 32:12.400
Well, lots of Animal Crossing, duh.

32:12.400 --> 32:18.640
I also got Cyber Shadow, which is sort of like a Revenge of the Ninja by the same folks

32:18.640 --> 32:21.560
that did Shovel Knight.

32:21.560 --> 32:29.740
It definitely has that same kind of feel to it, but it's definitely, definitely a little

32:29.740 --> 32:31.860
bit of a pissy game.

32:31.860 --> 32:38.760
You know, there's some cheap kills in there, but your save points are pretty, I'd say pretty

32:38.760 --> 32:40.640
well spread apart.

32:40.640 --> 32:43.260
The fights for the bosses are fairly interesting.

32:43.260 --> 32:49.740
It's got some very cool mechanics and some bonuses in there.

32:49.740 --> 32:51.640
The story is pretty okay so far.

32:51.640 --> 32:54.480
Dan, of course, has been playing it a lot more than I have.

32:54.480 --> 32:57.840
So it's sort of like if I start playing a game and then I sit down to watch Dan play

32:57.840 --> 33:01.400
it, it's like, oh, I won't play anymore, you know?

33:01.400 --> 33:03.040
But it's a really good game.

33:03.040 --> 33:04.040
Absolutely worth checking out.

33:04.040 --> 33:10.720
20 bucks on Switch right now on electronic download.

33:10.720 --> 33:11.960
And so there's a pretty rich been it.

33:11.960 --> 33:18.560
I'm still playing Boardscapes, which, you know, it's just a good waste of time.

33:18.560 --> 33:25.020
So about it, I'm actually been going back and looking at Saturn games.

33:25.020 --> 33:31.400
There's this thing that's kind of like an EverDrive for Saturn where you, I think you

33:31.400 --> 33:36.920
switch it out in part for the graphic card port on the back of it.

33:36.920 --> 33:42.080
And then you load ROMs on it like you would in EverDrive.

33:42.080 --> 33:43.960
I have to look it up again.

33:43.960 --> 33:48.060
It's like 200 bucks.

33:48.060 --> 33:52.960
But I'm kind of thinking about it because we have a lot of Saturn games and of course

33:52.960 --> 33:55.840
I don't want anything to happen to them.

33:55.840 --> 34:00.740
But it also means that I can play translated versions of games that I own that I've never

34:00.740 --> 34:04.840
finished because my reading comprehension level in Japanese was not great.

34:04.840 --> 34:12.260
So if I find the name of it again, I'll link it in chat, but we've been watching a lot

34:12.260 --> 34:14.560
of like Saturn reviews and things like that.

34:14.560 --> 34:17.220
So that's really where it stuck into my head.

34:17.220 --> 34:18.220
Just throwing that out there.

34:18.220 --> 34:21.300
It's not really what I'm playing, but what I have in mind to play.

34:21.300 --> 34:22.300
All right.

34:22.300 --> 34:23.300
All right.

34:23.300 --> 34:25.300
Oh, and I did play Pirates of the Caribbean pinball.

34:25.300 --> 34:26.300
So I did play some pinball.

34:26.300 --> 34:28.300
Did you get one of those in your house?

34:28.300 --> 34:29.300
Yeah.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.300
One of the Jersey Jack ones.

34:30.860 --> 34:31.860
Oh, nice.

34:32.860 --> 34:33.860
It's in Dan's office.

34:33.860 --> 34:34.860
Wow.

34:34.860 --> 34:36.580
How many machines do you have in your house right now?

34:36.580 --> 34:37.580
In the house?

34:37.580 --> 34:40.700
Physically in the house, four.

34:40.700 --> 34:43.740
And then another six or seven in the garage.

34:43.740 --> 34:45.980
I think we still own like 15.

34:45.980 --> 34:47.300
I consider that part of the house.

34:47.300 --> 34:48.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:48.300 --> 34:51.100
Well, I'm just trying to think about it legitimately.

34:51.100 --> 34:55.460
Like my world cup is off at Dan's friends to be shopped.

34:55.460 --> 34:58.300
We just got back shadow.

34:58.300 --> 35:03.300
So yeah, Dan put that in the hallway, which completely annoys me, but whatever.

35:03.300 --> 35:09.660
Yeah, we've loaned out a few and we have a few and there's some that I really wish I

35:09.660 --> 35:15.340
could get rid of because I don't like them and I want money.

35:15.340 --> 35:18.900
Actually the thing is, is that I'm really ready to like get rid of about four tables

35:18.900 --> 35:21.580
and move the ones that are in the house outside.

35:21.580 --> 35:26.420
Like maybe keep theater of magic in the house, but that's about it.

35:26.420 --> 35:29.700
Theater and world cup should stay in the house forever because they're my babies.

35:29.700 --> 35:33.320
You know, would it be fair to say, I mean, I know you kind of said that you don't do

35:33.320 --> 35:37.540
a lot with stock or cryptocurrency outside of your one preferred stock, but would it

35:37.540 --> 35:41.100
be fair to say that maybe where you do invest money is pinball tables?

35:41.100 --> 35:46.420
I mean, cause you kind of take them in, make them better, trade them, flip them, whatever.

35:46.420 --> 35:49.260
I mean, it's kind of what you're doing a little bit.

35:49.260 --> 35:50.260
Yeah.

35:50.260 --> 35:54.100
It's not really necessary for hobby, for fun, not for money, I guess.

35:54.100 --> 35:59.100
It's like the restoration business, you know, and, and the values of things go up and down.

35:59.100 --> 36:09.000
That's really just going to be not, not stock, not really like stocks, but just more of knowing

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
your market.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.660
We, you know, try to have the best thing that's out on the market.

36:12.660 --> 36:18.680
I guess it's very rudimentary capitalism where you take your, your product or in, or in some

36:18.680 --> 36:22.340
cases, you know, the components of a product, put it together into your product and then

36:22.340 --> 36:23.340
you sell it.

36:23.340 --> 36:27.780
Or, you know, people who flip houses, that's the same thing.

36:27.780 --> 36:31.660
Buy them cheap, fix them cheap, sell them high.

36:31.660 --> 36:32.660
Car flipping.

36:32.660 --> 36:33.660
There's people who do that.

36:33.660 --> 36:37.420
My, one of my exes used to do that with seventies Oldsmobiles.

36:37.420 --> 36:38.420
Yep.

36:38.420 --> 36:48.260
Now, if he can find me a 1970 422, then I'm down for that, but the thing is, is that with

36:48.260 --> 36:54.820
our network for, for a pinball is that we do have the ability to say, I don't have this,

36:54.820 --> 36:56.540
but I know who does.

36:56.540 --> 36:58.900
And we kind of scratch each other's backs in the community.

36:58.900 --> 37:05.240
I mean, there are some really cutthroat people, but for the most part, it's more of a, a community

37:05.240 --> 37:06.240
level thing.

37:06.240 --> 37:11.900
You know, if we've put in work to it, but a good buddy is like, Hey, you know, I really

37:11.900 --> 37:14.260
been looking for, I'm going to throw something out.

37:14.260 --> 37:18.620
I've really been looking for doctor who, and I see yours is in really great shape.

37:18.620 --> 37:20.220
I know you just shopped it.

37:20.220 --> 37:25.080
We can say, well, you're a good guy and there's a chance we'll get it back from you.

37:25.080 --> 37:28.180
So we'll sell it to you for, for what we paid for it.

37:28.180 --> 37:33.980
Plus the repairs, you know, and not make a profit on it, but we know we have a chance

37:33.980 --> 37:34.980
of playing that again.

37:34.980 --> 37:36.380
Cause it's at someone's house.

37:36.380 --> 37:41.060
So it's really more like community oriented.

37:41.060 --> 37:47.860
It's not quite the same, but it's similar enough to, yeah, Dan wouldn't let me sell

37:47.860 --> 37:54.740
my doctor who sorry, Bobby, um, to see a Tiberian chat says Jamie flipping tables, kinda literally.

37:54.740 --> 37:59.660
I mean, in a way I, Hey look, one day, one day I will have my baby Pac-Man table one

37:59.660 --> 38:03.020
day, but step, step, small steps.

38:03.020 --> 38:08.020
One day, if we are going to sell that table, I am going to insist that it be to you.

38:08.020 --> 38:09.020
Okay.

38:09.020 --> 38:10.420
All right.

38:10.420 --> 38:11.420
We got to move on though.

38:11.420 --> 38:14.740
We could, we could do a whole podcast on pinball table, uh, um, maintenance.

38:14.740 --> 38:17.940
I'm kind of surprised Jamie doesn't have one, but maybe someday, uh, but for now let's move

38:17.940 --> 38:18.940
on with other,

38:18.940 --> 38:19.940
I'm not good at that.

38:19.940 --> 38:20.940
Dan does that shit.

38:20.940 --> 38:21.940
All right.

38:21.940 --> 38:25.860
Uh, you, well then you do the production, you get him to be the expert and you're the,

38:25.860 --> 38:26.860
you're the host.

38:26.860 --> 38:27.860
All right.

38:27.860 --> 38:32.100
Um, now, uh, I'll tell you Jack danger does that, uh, already better than I do.

38:32.100 --> 38:33.100
So okay.

38:33.100 --> 38:34.100
Fair enough.

38:34.100 --> 38:35.100
Yeah.

38:35.100 --> 38:36.100
All right.

38:36.100 --> 38:37.100
Yeah.

38:37.100 --> 38:41.020
So go ahead and give some kudos to dead flip podcast and his live stream.

38:41.020 --> 38:43.180
You want to watch some good pinball, check out dead flip.

38:43.180 --> 38:44.180
All right.

38:44.180 --> 38:45.180
They didn't even pay for that spot.

38:45.180 --> 38:46.180
All right.

38:46.180 --> 38:47.180
Low key.

38:47.180 --> 38:48.180
He's a good guy.

38:48.180 --> 38:49.180
He helped me decide on Dan's Christmas present.

38:49.180 --> 38:50.180
That's fair.

38:50.180 --> 38:51.180
Uh, low key.

38:51.180 --> 38:52.180
How was your game week?

38:52.180 --> 38:57.100
Um, so I didn't play a whole ton because I've been working on my game, so I did play a lot

38:57.100 --> 38:58.180
of mobile stuff.

38:58.180 --> 39:05.380
So, um, I've been switching between like Pokemon go and Minecraft earth and Orna.

39:05.380 --> 39:08.940
Just depending on where I'm at, usually cause I run out of things to do in one of those.

39:08.940 --> 39:13.660
And so I switched to the other one, uh, so I've been doing that and then, um, I picked

39:13.660 --> 39:16.820
up an, an original NES this week.

39:16.820 --> 39:19.260
Um, so that should be coming pretty soon.

39:19.260 --> 39:26.360
Uh, so I can test, you know, the games actually burn with my, um, you know, ROM burner.

39:26.360 --> 39:33.980
So, uh, you know, game prep prepared for the physical copies of a pixel poops number two.

39:34.020 --> 39:38.580
And, uh, yeah, and also we're set to launch on the 10th of February.

39:38.580 --> 39:43.300
So just working towards that, just trying to get everything done.

39:43.300 --> 39:48.140
Wait, wait, we're set to launch on the 10th of February, meaning your, your NES ROM or

39:48.140 --> 39:49.140
like your game.

39:49.140 --> 39:50.140
Yeah.

39:50.140 --> 39:57.700
So like a pixel poops to, um, the pixel poops on steam and the, the, uh, pixel poop 64 should

39:57.700 --> 39:59.100
all be February 10th.

39:59.100 --> 40:01.300
Oh, I didn't know you were all aiming for the same day.

40:01.300 --> 40:02.300
Okay.

40:02.300 --> 40:03.300
Wow.

40:03.620 --> 40:04.620
That's amazing.

40:04.620 --> 40:05.620
Well, good luck.

40:05.620 --> 40:06.620
All right.

40:06.620 --> 40:07.620
Couple more weeks.

40:07.620 --> 40:08.620
Yeah.

40:08.620 --> 40:12.580
I've, I've been playing, um, the beta thanks to Y Y R given those codes in our discord

40:12.580 --> 40:14.500
at vog network.com slash discord.

40:14.500 --> 40:16.580
Um, and, uh, it's, it's fun.

40:16.580 --> 40:21.780
It's it, it has a lot, I mean, for as silly as the name is and the concept and everything,

40:21.780 --> 40:26.900
there is something, it really has like that Atari 2,600, like very simple game, but can

40:26.900 --> 40:29.820
get very difficult, very fast type of charm to it.

40:29.820 --> 40:32.980
Like I didn't even realize that he kind of built something into it where like, once you

40:32.980 --> 40:37.820
get a certain score, it gets a lot harder because the there'll be some different types

40:37.820 --> 40:38.820
of walking.

40:38.820 --> 40:43.860
I don't want to ruin it all, but, uh, it's, uh, yeah, it's, it's, it really invokes a

40:43.860 --> 40:46.940
lot of what made those old Atari 2,600 games fun.

40:46.940 --> 40:51.900
So, um, check it out, uh, when it hits steam or get on our discord and get the, get the

40:51.900 --> 40:53.700
peekaboo a little bit early.

40:53.700 --> 40:54.700
All right.

40:54.700 --> 40:59.500
Um, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says I didn't get a code because I'm going to buy it instead.

40:59.500 --> 41:02.380
I'll, I'll still throw, I think it's actually going to be free to play.

41:02.420 --> 41:05.220
I'll still throw money at the DLC or I'll gift it to somebody.

41:05.220 --> 41:07.940
That's what I did with the last game that he gave me a code for.

41:07.940 --> 41:11.860
I, I just get, I bought it for somebody else that I thought would like it.

41:11.860 --> 41:12.900
So, all right.

41:12.900 --> 41:16.260
Um, let's see other, uh, stuff for my gaming week.

41:16.260 --> 41:19.620
Honestly, I've had kind of a slower week when it comes to games as well.

41:19.620 --> 41:23.700
I've been playing a little bit of Pokemon, meaning, uh, shield continuing with the DLC,

41:23.700 --> 41:27.780
but also, um, Pokemon go quite a bit, uh, was working.

41:27.780 --> 41:31.140
I've done all four weeks of the collection challenge and Pokemon go.

41:31.180 --> 41:33.540
So, uh, been doing that and that's fun.

41:33.540 --> 41:39.940
Um, and, uh, otherwise, as far as, uh, other games I've been playing Final Fantasy 14 a

41:39.940 --> 41:44.580
lot, that's pretty much been most of the bulk of my gaming time, uh, continuing the online

41:44.580 --> 41:45.620
adventures there.

41:45.620 --> 41:48.740
There's a tiny patch coming on Tuesday.

41:48.740 --> 41:51.300
That's going to allow the blue mage job to go up to 70.

41:51.300 --> 41:52.260
So that's really exciting.

41:52.260 --> 41:55.540
And then they're going to do something called the relic weapon, which is like the, uh, a

41:55.540 --> 41:58.740
really fancy, you know, uh, weapon you have to work really hard to get.

41:58.740 --> 42:01.300
They're kind of putting another step into that for another upgrade.

42:01.300 --> 42:02.580
So that should be fun as well.

42:02.580 --> 42:06.420
And then there are big announcements for Final Fantasy 14 on Friday.

42:06.420 --> 42:10.740
They're actually doing a big stream where they're going to, uh, assumably unveil the

42:10.740 --> 42:16.900
next expansion because we were supposed to have fan fest, uh, in San Diego this year

42:16.900 --> 42:22.660
in October, but obviously thanks to, uh, miss Rona, we didn't have that, uh, anything.

42:22.660 --> 42:25.860
So this is kind of like the assumed makeup for some of that.

42:25.860 --> 42:27.300
So we're getting that on Friday.

42:27.300 --> 42:31.220
I really wanted to co-stream it, um, with some of my Final Fantasy buddies.

42:31.220 --> 42:34.180
Uh, but we don't know if legally Square is allowing that.

42:34.180 --> 42:39.620
So unfortunately we're erring on the side of, um, we'll just watch ourselves and I'll

42:39.620 --> 42:41.220
be here to comment on it on Sunday.

42:41.220 --> 42:45.620
But if I find out that they allow co-streams of it, then, um, stay tuned to our Twitter,

42:45.620 --> 42:50.100
uh, either over at twitter.com slash OLR for the show or twitter.com slash vog network

42:50.100 --> 42:53.620
for the network, uh, for any updates and last minute things that are plotted.

42:53.620 --> 42:57.620
If I find out that Square does indeed allow the co-streaming of that sort of thing.

42:57.620 --> 43:00.580
And if anybody happens to know that in our chat, um, let me know.

43:00.580 --> 43:02.740
Cause I'd be very thankful to know that information.

43:03.460 --> 43:04.180
All right.

43:04.180 --> 43:06.500
Uh, but that's really it for my gaming week otherwise.

43:06.500 --> 43:10.980
So let's get into some news and we'll go to Loki for our first story tonight.

43:11.700 --> 43:13.700
Yeah, let's talk about Amazon game studios.

43:13.700 --> 43:15.460
I haven't really heard too much about them.

43:15.460 --> 43:21.380
Um, and apparently the reason why is because they're having some issues.

43:21.380 --> 43:28.340
Um, so according to a report by Bloomberg, there's been some serious, um, stuff going

43:28.340 --> 43:32.100
on behind the scenes at, uh, Amazon game studio.

43:32.100 --> 43:37.380
So right now, um, they had conducted about 30 interviews with former Amazon employees

43:38.020 --> 43:41.060
and talked about some of the stuff going on behind the scenes.

43:41.060 --> 43:46.180
So for example, they said, uh, the game that they're working on new world, uh, which

43:46.180 --> 43:50.660
apparently you play as a colonists in the fictionalized 17th century America.

43:51.460 --> 43:57.860
Um, they says the enemy designs born uncomfortable similarity with two native Americans.

43:57.860 --> 44:03.700
And after they had hired a tribal consultant, they found that indeed it was offensive.

44:04.420 --> 44:11.860
So that, that pushed back the release, uh, from August of 2020 to now some time in the spring.

44:12.660 --> 44:17.940
Uh, also you had, you know, courses like bro culture that's going on, which we've heard

44:17.940 --> 44:23.540
a lot in different companies, but apparently that's still something that they're, um, dealing

44:23.540 --> 44:24.500
with there as well.

44:25.140 --> 44:32.500
And apparently following a disagreement with a male employee, uh, of senior leadership,

44:32.500 --> 44:37.860
one of the women that was, uh, interviewed, he made up some new position above her and

44:37.860 --> 44:39.780
hired men into those roles.

44:40.340 --> 44:46.900
Um, apparently the leader of the entire games division has never made a video game before.

44:47.540 --> 44:54.020
And he's basically frustrated developers with, um, basic takes and had, they said,

44:54.020 --> 44:57.380
troubling differentiating between gameplay and concept footage.

44:58.180 --> 45:04.020
Um, they were forcing everybody into that, uh, proprietary lumber yard, uh, program that

45:04.020 --> 45:06.420
they had to develop games in.

45:06.500 --> 45:11.780
So their game engine, and apparently that was a little bit difficult as well, but now

45:11.780 --> 45:16.420
that they have this new guy on board from take two, he's kind of eased that mandate,

45:16.420 --> 45:18.260
but that did cause some issues as well.

45:18.260 --> 45:21.780
So it's just been kind of, uh, not smooth.

45:22.420 --> 45:27.060
Um, so yeah, I don't know.

45:28.420 --> 45:32.500
I'm curious to see what, what they come out with, but like right now, I mean, to me, it's

45:32.500 --> 45:38.980
almost like stadia where they have like these stadia developed games, but like, where are

45:38.980 --> 45:39.460
these?

45:39.460 --> 45:42.100
I mean, we haven't really seen anything from them.

45:42.100 --> 45:42.500
Yeah.

45:42.500 --> 45:45.300
Um, fifth dream in chat says, sounds like a winner all around.

45:45.300 --> 45:47.620
And by that, I mean, close Amazon games and give up.

45:47.620 --> 45:51.460
Um, quest buster says they hired some top shelf names to work on their products too.

45:51.460 --> 45:53.460
And most, if not all of them left.

45:53.460 --> 45:56.420
Uh, and then let's see, uh, this is a newer chatter.

45:56.420 --> 45:57.860
So welcome a dragon.

45:58.100 --> 45:58.260
Summer.

46:02.260 --> 46:05.460
It's blue on black on my screen, so I can't even read it, but thank you.

46:05.460 --> 46:10.660
Jamie says, um, that lumberyard engine is a disaster too.

46:10.660 --> 46:13.060
It was cry engine, but then all torn apart.

46:13.060 --> 46:14.420
It's such a shame.

46:14.420 --> 46:19.380
So, um, yeah, there's a lot of, uh, issues going on with the Amazon thing and it almost

46:19.380 --> 46:21.460
makes you wonder if they're ever going to get a game out.

46:21.460 --> 46:26.980
I mean, yes, I know new world is like, but like, like legit, actually like have a game

46:27.060 --> 46:27.380
out.

46:27.380 --> 46:31.780
It's, uh, doesn't, doesn't seem too promising over there.

46:31.780 --> 46:33.380
I didn't have high expectations.

46:33.940 --> 46:34.440
Yeah.

46:35.060 --> 46:37.220
So womp, womp.

46:37.220 --> 46:37.720
All right.

46:38.260 --> 46:42.580
Well, another game, I don't think people necessarily had a high, high expectations for this game,

46:42.580 --> 46:45.700
but it's interesting to hear that it's doing, uh, well enough.

46:45.700 --> 46:47.860
And that is the game, the medium.

46:47.860 --> 46:50.980
This seems like a game I want to check this game out because I guess it's supposed to

46:50.980 --> 46:53.300
be like a psychological game, but not gross.

46:53.300 --> 46:55.780
Like it kind of invokes silent Hill.

46:55.780 --> 46:59.860
And, uh, I mean, so far as the fact that Akira Yamaoka does some of the music in it

46:59.860 --> 47:03.140
and, uh, Mary Elizabeth McGlynn apparently sings some songs in it.

47:03.140 --> 47:07.940
So, I mean, talk about a throwback to silent Hill, but it's the game, but I I'm told do

47:07.940 --> 47:10.420
not expect it to be silent Hill or you will be disappointed.

47:10.420 --> 47:13.220
So I want to make sure that is appropriately communicated as well.

47:13.220 --> 47:19.060
Um, but it is a game called the medium and the medium came out on PC and X-Box and apparently,

47:19.060 --> 47:24.500
uh, via an interview with money.pl, which is a Polish website regarding of course, money,

47:24.500 --> 47:30.020
uh, the studio who developed, uh, the medium has said it has already made back its money

47:30.020 --> 47:31.780
for development and marketing costs.

47:31.780 --> 47:34.260
So anything from here out is pure profit.

47:34.260 --> 47:39.380
It's, uh, interesting to note that the medium is a day one X-Box game pass game.

47:39.380 --> 47:41.300
And this is how a lot of people are discovering it.

47:41.300 --> 47:44.580
And I know that's one reason why it's kind of on my radar right now as well as it's like,

47:44.580 --> 47:49.220
Oh, it's a psychological kind of thriller game and I don't have to pay extra money for it.

47:49.220 --> 47:52.020
Uh, on top of what I'm already paying for game pass.

47:52.020 --> 47:55.140
So it's interesting to hear that that is already successful.

47:55.140 --> 47:58.980
Some folks are kind of taking that a step further to be like, this is,

47:58.980 --> 48:03.380
this is an example of how game pass is successful for a lot of games right now.

48:03.380 --> 48:07.060
Um, and so this being more of a fringe title,

48:07.060 --> 48:12.420
not sure that people would have dropped $60 to experiment on this game and figure it out.

48:12.420 --> 48:15.860
But with game pass, you got a lot more that are willing to take the risk.

48:15.860 --> 48:19.060
So it's, it's very interesting to hear that it's been successful.

48:19.060 --> 48:22.580
I mean, breaking even the first week sounds pretty successful to me,

48:22.580 --> 48:24.340
that it's all going to be profit from here on out,

48:24.340 --> 48:27.380
especially if they end up releasing a version on switch.

48:27.380 --> 48:28.580
I don't know if that's technically possible,

48:28.580 --> 48:31.300
but releasing a version on PlayStation later and who knows what.

48:31.300 --> 48:34.500
So, um, by the way, if you weren't already aware,

48:34.500 --> 48:37.380
X-Box game pass has 15 million subscribers.

48:37.380 --> 48:39.220
So pretty neat.

48:39.220 --> 48:41.060
Uh, those of you that are listening live,

48:41.060 --> 48:44.500
they have any of you out there checked out the medium.

48:44.500 --> 48:52.420
So, um, uh, dragon semi says, uh, medium screams, silent hill and free on game pass.

48:52.420 --> 48:54.980
Uh, game pass is nailing it so much right now,

48:54.980 --> 48:58.580
other than the X-Box gold price increase the X-Box retracted.

48:58.580 --> 49:00.900
Yeah, we talked about that a little bit on last week's show.

49:00.900 --> 49:05.780
That was not a great look, but at the end of the day, at least they've retracted.

49:05.780 --> 49:08.740
Um, even if they maybe showed their ass a little bit, uh,

49:08.740 --> 49:12.180
I think game pass is still the place to be at least for now.

49:12.180 --> 49:14.740
We will see what develops over the next year.

49:14.740 --> 49:16.900
Are they going to do price increase on game pass?

49:16.900 --> 49:20.340
I suppose it's inevitable, but I don't think they can really get away with it

49:20.340 --> 49:24.260
until they've got their halo and they've got more of those series X.

49:24.260 --> 49:27.300
Um, I don't want to say exclusive cause I know that's not their plan,

49:27.300 --> 49:31.860
but series X like focused, I guess games, uh, would really,

49:31.860 --> 49:33.940
I think help sell that a little bit.

49:34.420 --> 49:37.940
Uh, pod culture says medium is a rare game that is well done.

49:37.940 --> 49:39.700
I see what you did there like that.

49:39.700 --> 49:42.900
Uh, as John Hunter Matt says, it's on my list of things to try next.

49:42.900 --> 49:44.980
I just signed up for game pass.

49:44.980 --> 49:47.060
So yeah, I want to check that out as well.

49:47.060 --> 49:49.940
Um, I was listening to Bobby cause he's on before us, of course,

49:49.940 --> 49:53.540
here at VOG Network and he was talking about a patent that that game has,

49:53.540 --> 49:56.340
where I guess apparently you actually control a character

49:56.340 --> 49:57.860
in kind of two places at once.

49:57.860 --> 50:01.140
Like there's a normal realm and a spirit realm type of thing

50:01.140 --> 50:02.340
that you're kind of controlling the character.

50:02.340 --> 50:03.780
Sounds like a neat mechanic.

50:03.780 --> 50:05.620
So I, uh, I want to check that out.

50:05.620 --> 50:06.820
So pretty cool.

50:07.780 --> 50:08.340
All right.

50:08.340 --> 50:11.300
Uh, let's move on dark Sakura, something that's been getting

50:11.300 --> 50:12.500
a lot of buzz this week, right?

50:13.300 --> 50:13.860
So yeah.

50:13.860 --> 50:20.340
Um, Konami, uh, did, uh, some basic restructuring, um, by dissolving,

50:20.340 --> 50:23.300
uh, well, it's, it's announced that it played a dissolve three production

50:23.300 --> 50:26.900
divisions to, uh, adapt to the market.

50:26.900 --> 50:30.180
Um, and they put this out on the economy's corporate, uh, website,

50:30.180 --> 50:33.140
but this made people think that they were going to be shutting down

50:33.140 --> 50:34.980
their video game division.

50:34.980 --> 50:36.580
And they say, this is not the case.

50:37.300 --> 50:40.020
Um, they are very insistent on it.

50:40.020 --> 50:44.660
The quote States, the announcement, uh, made refers to an internal

50:44.660 --> 50:47.780
restructure with production divisions being consolidated.

50:47.780 --> 50:51.860
We have not quote shut down our video game, our video gaming division.

50:52.500 --> 50:54.900
So we'll see.

50:54.900 --> 50:58.660
I mean, Konami hasn't really been putting out a whole lot in the way

50:58.660 --> 50:59.220
of games.

50:59.220 --> 51:03.460
I mean, just like metal gear and some reissues of earlier games.

51:04.180 --> 51:10.500
Um, the, uh, the only game I think right now in production is PES 2022.

51:11.460 --> 51:14.980
Um, and there's rumors of a silent Hill game, but we don't know.

51:16.180 --> 51:17.700
I wouldn't hedge a lot of money on that.

51:17.700 --> 51:18.980
I'd be very surprised.

51:18.980 --> 51:22.820
I think if the Konami, you know, digital thing, you know, for the games

51:22.820 --> 51:25.860
division is still around, hopefully, and I really think this is the best

51:25.860 --> 51:26.900
case scenario.

51:26.900 --> 51:31.060
They're licensing out a lot of their IPs to other companies, hopefully.

51:31.060 --> 51:33.940
And I think we also know that in Japan, um, they're still doing, you know,

51:33.940 --> 51:38.580
cause this game is rooted in like Bamani stuff and some of those, um, uh,

51:38.580 --> 51:43.140
more like evergreen, always services online in Japan that they've been

51:43.140 --> 51:43.460
doing.

51:43.460 --> 51:47.860
You know, the, the, uh, there's a beat mania 2DX online, Infinitas, whatever

51:47.860 --> 51:48.340
is the thing.

51:48.340 --> 51:53.060
And they've, they've got, I think sound voltex has one pop music has one.

51:53.060 --> 51:55.140
I think a lot of those games kind of have one.

51:55.140 --> 51:58.100
So, um, I think that's something they're still invested in as well.

51:58.180 --> 52:00.980
So I w I wouldn't look to other companies to develop music games,

52:00.980 --> 52:02.020
unfortunately.

52:02.020 --> 52:06.500
Um, but I think some of these other ones, I wouldn't you love it if they

52:06.500 --> 52:09.300
would let somebody else work on a Castlevania or a silent Hill?

52:09.300 --> 52:09.700
I don't know.

52:10.740 --> 52:13.940
Well, they had a good shot of good silent Hill game and then fucked them

52:13.940 --> 52:14.500
up.

52:14.500 --> 52:15.860
Fucked, uh, uh, true.

52:17.140 --> 52:18.660
That like words Kojima.

52:18.660 --> 52:20.100
Ah, yes.

52:20.100 --> 52:21.300
I can't make words happen.

52:21.300 --> 52:22.500
They fucked Kojima over.

52:23.460 --> 52:23.960
Yeah.

52:24.760 --> 52:28.840
So, um, yeah, I wouldn't hold your breath on anything that exciting coming.

52:28.840 --> 52:34.840
Um, I maybe some more like retro types of collections, but I don't know.

52:34.840 --> 52:36.120
They've been doing already.

52:36.120 --> 52:40.040
So like I said, I don't see anything particularly new for the console market

52:40.040 --> 52:41.720
and retro can only take you so far.

52:41.720 --> 52:42.840
Plus you have to remember a lot.

52:42.840 --> 52:45.960
Like let's say they let another developer make a new Castlevania.

52:45.960 --> 52:47.560
Oh, here's a game that I played this week.

52:47.560 --> 52:50.360
I totally, cause I played it on Sunday after OLR.

52:50.360 --> 52:53.720
So I forgot about it during my gaming week, but, uh, bloodstained

52:53.720 --> 52:58.360
ritual of the night has that classic mode that I checked out and boy.

52:58.360 --> 52:58.840
Oh boy.

52:58.840 --> 53:00.120
Is it just Castlevania?

53:00.120 --> 53:04.680
The like, it's exactly what it's not even shy about it.

53:04.680 --> 53:06.760
It's just like, I'm not even talking about them.

53:06.760 --> 53:09.800
I'm talking about the classic mode is like old school Castlevania, like

53:09.800 --> 53:13.720
vampire Hunter, like that old school, you know, original game.

53:13.720 --> 53:15.720
Uh, and it's, it's fun.

53:15.720 --> 53:16.200
It's great.

53:16.200 --> 53:17.000
It's well done.

53:17.000 --> 53:21.080
But it also really makes you realize like, okay, even if Konami suddenly

53:21.080 --> 53:26.360
did another Castlevania game, Igarashi has clearly moved on and is doing his

53:26.360 --> 53:27.160
own thing.

53:27.160 --> 53:30.040
So the Castlevania you're going to get, it's going to be different.

53:30.040 --> 53:32.200
Now different can go both ways.

53:32.200 --> 53:35.400
I don't think different actually automatically has to be a negative.

53:35.400 --> 53:38.280
Um, unfortunately you look at Konami and you look at some of their

53:38.280 --> 53:42.440
choices, um, like the Contra game that came out recently, which honestly,

53:42.440 --> 53:46.120
I guess Dark Tetsuya was a fan, but a lot of people I've kind of seen

53:46.120 --> 53:49.880
online are like that game was, that was Contra full of choices.

53:49.880 --> 53:53.560
Um, and so, you know, it didn't did it up so well.

53:53.560 --> 53:58.120
Um, but if they let somebody else do a Castlevania, you know, the right

53:58.120 --> 54:00.120
company might actually be able to do it very well.

54:00.120 --> 54:04.200
Somebody like, um, the people that have been doing the blaster master reboots

54:04.200 --> 54:05.640
have been knocking it out of the park.

54:06.200 --> 54:07.640
So why not let them do it?

54:07.640 --> 54:09.720
Is that way forward or who's actually developing that?

54:10.440 --> 54:13.480
But they're, they're knocking it out of the park, honestly.

54:13.480 --> 54:15.240
So, all right.

54:15.240 --> 54:21.400
Um, going to our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, uh, Kate

54:21.400 --> 54:26.440
Catastrophe asks, which company is worse, Konami or EA?

54:26.440 --> 54:28.440
Um, both for different reasons.

54:28.440 --> 54:30.120
That's a very hard question.

54:30.120 --> 54:34.280
Um, they both have done some, I mean, it's hard.

54:34.280 --> 54:37.960
I think it's, it's, or I should say it's easy for me to want to say Konami.

54:38.600 --> 54:40.840
Cause I don't really care about the sports games.

54:40.840 --> 54:41.400
So whatever.

54:41.400 --> 54:42.760
I mean, there is mass effect.

54:42.760 --> 54:44.760
So I guess I have that involved with EA.

54:45.240 --> 54:48.840
But with Konami, you look at how they've tripped over themselves time and time again.

54:48.840 --> 54:51.720
And this show is really rooted in like music games, Maimani and all that.

54:51.720 --> 54:54.440
That's, you know, where our name came from and what we talked about for the

54:54.440 --> 54:57.240
first couple of years of the show and so on was really that culture.

54:57.240 --> 55:02.520
So to see like that whole thing, Konami is really, I mean, I know DDR is still

55:02.520 --> 55:05.720
around kinda, and I know it still has a loyal following.

55:05.720 --> 55:09.640
I know there's other podcasts that are now doing what we did the first two

55:09.640 --> 55:12.280
years of our show where they're talking about like DDR culture, music and

55:12.280 --> 55:13.720
culture and stuff, which is great.

55:13.720 --> 55:14.840
More props to them.

55:14.840 --> 55:17.320
But I just feel like it could have been so much more.

55:18.680 --> 55:20.360
It could have been so much more.

55:20.360 --> 55:26.040
And I think Guitar Hero and Rockband and that whole, you know, uh, thing that

55:26.040 --> 55:29.480
kind of came and went, I think shows that Konami could have done more than

55:29.480 --> 55:32.520
just like Rock Revolution, which was their answer to all that at the same time.

55:32.520 --> 55:33.480
That was awful.

55:33.480 --> 55:36.360
Yeah, but that's, that was their solution to how are we going to go

55:36.360 --> 55:38.440
up against Guitar Hero and Rockband.

55:38.440 --> 55:39.960
And it was a terrible idea.

55:39.960 --> 55:41.480
It was a terrible idea.

55:41.480 --> 55:44.200
And then after that they had Beaten Groovy.

55:44.200 --> 55:46.840
So I mean, like choices.

55:47.560 --> 55:48.060
Yeah.

55:49.240 --> 55:50.040
All right.

55:50.040 --> 55:51.640
Let's move on Loki.

55:53.080 --> 55:53.320
Yeah.

55:53.320 --> 55:59.240
So Valve is facing a lawsuit over, uh, apparently issues with the Steam

55:59.240 --> 56:05.640
controller and that it's design actually was patented by somebody else.

56:05.640 --> 56:12.840
So this is, um, regarding a third-party controller maker SCUF that says back

56:12.840 --> 56:18.200
in 2014, that the design for the Steam controller was infringing on the,

56:18.200 --> 56:24.040
uh, Ironbird, Ironberg patents, but they went ahead with the design anyways.

56:24.760 --> 56:29.640
Um, and apparently the patent is regarding the rear side triggers.

56:30.360 --> 56:35.080
They said that that's, um, which is on, I guess, opposite side of the pads.

56:36.120 --> 56:40.200
So what I'm guessing is it's not like your normal trigger buttons, but like

56:40.200 --> 56:45.080
those under controller triggers that you have on some of these, um, you know,

56:45.080 --> 56:49.080
fancier buttons, I think they have like on the, uh, pro controller and stuff

56:49.080 --> 56:52.200
like that from the Xbox pro controller or whatever.

56:52.200 --> 56:58.040
Um, but yeah, so apparently they were filing a lawsuit regarding that.

56:58.040 --> 56:58.520
I don't know.

56:58.520 --> 56:59.400
The controller sucks.

56:59.400 --> 57:01.000
So whatever.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.560
But, um, it's kind of a little late for that.

57:03.560 --> 57:06.200
They've already discontinued the controller and I don't think that they

57:06.200 --> 57:07.560
made much money off of that.

57:07.560 --> 57:13.640
It's gonna be hard to argue, uh, losses on that, but we'll see what happens.

57:13.640 --> 57:14.120
Settlement.

57:14.120 --> 57:15.000
I'm guessing.

57:15.000 --> 57:19.560
Did you hear about the other lawsuit and saw involving valve about, um, was it,

57:19.560 --> 57:24.120
no, we had the geo blocking a couple of weeks ago, but there was another one

57:24.120 --> 57:28.520
about, um, their contract clause about that.

57:28.520 --> 57:32.440
Um, you have to, if you could put your game up for sale on steam, which I

57:32.440 --> 57:36.600
think the lawsuit, I think was trying to claim that steam kind of has a sense

57:36.600 --> 57:40.840
of a monopoly on the market when it comes to PC, um, that it has to be

57:40.840 --> 57:44.600
lowest price on steam, even if, so you can't put it like lower price on

57:44.600 --> 57:48.120
humble, or if it goes on sale somewhere else, you have to put on sale on steam

57:48.120 --> 57:51.000
too, which I, I kind of thought, and again, I don't have the story in front

57:51.000 --> 57:51.560
of me.

57:51.560 --> 57:54.840
Um, maybe some of you in chat recall this a little better than I do.

57:54.840 --> 57:57.480
Um, but I, I seem to think like.

57:58.040 --> 58:01.960
Didn't, doesn't Amazon have a controversial thing like this too?

58:01.960 --> 58:05.240
When it comes to their store, um, at least when it comes to mobile apps, I

58:05.240 --> 58:06.440
know was a thing.

58:06.440 --> 58:10.120
Um, cause that was a very controversial sounds vaguely familiar.

58:10.120 --> 58:10.600
Yeah.

58:10.600 --> 58:14.520
Um, I'm not sure, but yeah, I could, I could see them kind of doing something

58:14.520 --> 58:18.840
like that or not even necessarily just, you know, valve, but like, I think, you

58:18.840 --> 58:23.480
know, a lot of different mobile storefronts and stuff possibly have

58:23.480 --> 58:25.960
similar types of requirements.

58:25.960 --> 58:26.440
Yeah.

58:26.440 --> 58:28.840
Just for fair competition, they'll wedge.

58:28.840 --> 58:32.440
Now Questbuster wants to point out in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog

58:32.440 --> 58:32.760
network.

58:32.760 --> 58:36.680
When it comes to the controller lawsuit, um, it does not appear to be patent

58:36.680 --> 58:37.880
trolls that are doing this.

58:37.880 --> 58:41.480
Um, it's saying not surprisingly, also surprisingly, excuse me, not patent

58:41.480 --> 58:42.520
troll that is suing.

58:42.520 --> 58:44.440
They actually make specialty controllers.

58:44.440 --> 58:47.720
They're part of the company that make the scuff controllers that go for nearly

58:47.720 --> 58:49.320
200 bucks on Amazon.

58:49.880 --> 58:53.240
So, um, it seems like, you know, unfortunately we hear a lot about patent

58:53.240 --> 58:53.960
trolls.

58:53.960 --> 58:56.760
Um, but this may be somebody that actually does have an interest in this

58:56.760 --> 59:01.240
yet again, kind of like Loki was saying these controllers have kind of come and

59:01.240 --> 59:02.360
gone anyway.

59:03.080 --> 59:04.040
So it's interesting.

59:05.480 --> 59:06.040
That's happening.

59:06.040 --> 59:06.200
Yeah.

59:06.200 --> 59:09.000
These interesting looking controllers there.

59:09.000 --> 59:09.240
Yeah.

59:09.240 --> 59:12.200
I like, I like the fancy designs that they have for them.

59:12.200 --> 59:12.600
Yeah.

59:12.600 --> 59:14.040
Those analog sticks look pretty nice.

59:14.040 --> 59:15.080
Why they're 200 bucks.

59:15.080 --> 59:15.320
Right.

59:16.840 --> 59:20.920
Well, I, you know, I want to say I've used something similar to this.

59:20.920 --> 59:24.920
Like they actually had, and I don't remember this as the same company, but I

59:24.920 --> 59:29.560
remember those types of little, uh, triggers that they had, but they had a

59:29.560 --> 59:30.600
long time ago.

59:30.600 --> 59:36.280
It was this thing you can like strap onto your, uh, Xbox controller.

59:36.280 --> 59:41.080
Cause I actually had one that I got as like a, a promo thing or something.

59:41.080 --> 59:42.200
And it was weird.

59:42.760 --> 59:45.560
Like you could basically just strap it on.

59:45.560 --> 59:49.640
It looks like this giant spider thing on top of your controller that adds like

59:49.640 --> 59:54.440
all these different buttons and stuff that you basically just pull and push

59:54.440 --> 59:57.880
different, uh, buttons on the actual controller, but they put them in

59:57.880 --> 59:58.840
different places.

59:58.840 --> 01:00:03.800
It was really weird, but yeah, it kind of looks like that, but I guess now

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:08.440
they've refined it quite more than that's, you know, spider thing that was

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.000
on there.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:09.240
Yeah.

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.000
All right.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.560
Well, let's move on a few more stories for you guys before we get to the

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.920
classic game of the week.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:19.400
And, uh, first let's talk about this because this is a story about a mod, um,

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.360
that came out recently and it's, it's gone through a lot.

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:26.680
Um, so this is a mod for fallout new Vegas that was really going to be

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:28.600
transformative of the entire game.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:33.160
Um, fallout, the frontier is the name of this mod and it did release on January

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:33.800
15th.

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.080
And, uh, it was so popular when it first came out because again, this has been

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:39.800
something that's been in development for a long time and a lot of people were

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:40.920
involved with this.

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:46.200
Um, you know, uh, doing, you know, fan art and, um, you know, all this stuff.

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:52.280
So, um, anyhow, the mod came out, it crashed nexus mods because it got 82,000

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.720
downloads the day it came out.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:59.800
And then, uh, a lot of stuff started coming out about it.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:06.040
Uh, in, in kind of most notably, I should say there was, uh, one of the mod

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:12.280
developers got ejected from the team because of some pedophilic content that

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:14.520
they had been, uh, posting you.

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:15.320
Yeah, exactly.

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:15.880
Big you.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:16.520
Right.

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:21.160
Uh, and then a few hours after that, the entire mod was taken offline.

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:23.080
So yeah, big you.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:26.280
And you know that that is gross and all that stuff.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.360
But as I mentioned earlier, there's all these people involved with a mod.

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:30.840
Right.

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:35.880
And so this person just basically sank the entire ship right now.

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:37.000
I'm hearing a lot.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.760
I haven't played the mod myself.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:43.800
I'm hearing a lot of it is, um, there's some kind of strange content in there

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.160
and I'm going to leave it at that.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:49.000
Um, some of it makes sense in the fallout universe.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.720
Some of it, like, um, you know, uh, the sex with the death claw doesn't

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.760
necessarily make sense.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:02:00.040
Um, but, uh, you know what, people do nude mods for games.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:03.480
So if people want to have sex with the death claw, okay, whatever, I guess.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:07.240
Uh, it also should be pointed out that the discord for this ended up getting

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:10.040
raided by 4chan, which certainly didn't help.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:14.520
And now you've got all these people that were involved with the project that

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:17.400
are getting docs and all this other stuff.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:22.760
And it's just, I don't, you know, like, again, no, no money was to, um, be made

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:23.720
off this whole thing.

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:28.520
So, um, I don't know what point they're going to make with that whole thing.

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:32.280
I mean, yes, go after the guy that did the pedophilia, but I don't know.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.400
But again, I haven't played the mod myself, so I can't say much more than

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:37.960
that.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:44.120
Uh, looking at chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, SSG100Matt says macho man

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.000
death claws though.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:45.320
Oh yeah.

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:48.920
So maybe they were just waiting for the mod to the mod that would turn the death

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:50.120
claws into something else.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:50.680
I see.

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:52.840
That was just forward thinking is what that was.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:53.480
I see.

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:53.880
I see.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.960
Questbuster says they can party with the macho man dragons in Skyrim.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:58.920
Mm hmm.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:02:59.480
All right.

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:00.040
Ooh, yeah.

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:01.320
Oh, yeah.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:02.360
All right.

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:07.480
Anyway, um, you know, thoughts, thoughts to those that, you know, maybe got

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:11.000
involved with the project that didn't know the type of people that were on the

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:11.720
team.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.400
Um, that's unfortunate.

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:14.280
All right.

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:17.320
Moving on though, let's go to our next story.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.840
Uh, Dark Soccer, I think it's yours.

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:19.960
All right.

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:24.120
Well, I love Sega as has been proved with a chart recently.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.160
Thanks, Rob, for letting me know about that.

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:35.080
Um, but anyway, um, Sega is going through a split, um, with its amusement and

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.360
video game divisions.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:44.440
Um, it is definitely leading to some rumors that, uh, Sega may be in

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.280
pre-acquisition mode, I guess.

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:56.120
Um, so basically, um, those two divisions, um, are, uh, are basically being split

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:56.360
again.

01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:02.520
Like I said, um, the CCO, um, uh, Toshihiro Nagoshi is, uh, going to be creative

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.840
director effective on April 1st.

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.200
That ain't no joke y'all.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.480
Um, but they will remain under the ownership of Sega Sammy.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:15.880
Um, and the quote is that it's intended to accelerate global business development

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:19.560
by streamlining their structure and accelerate decision-making.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:25.880
So they, the other mention on this is that it's intended to transform Sega's

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:29.320
business structure to adapt to the external environment.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:35.560
But the rumor is still that they are in prime position to be acquired.

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:38.680
Um, there are certainly rumors about Microsoft.

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.360
There's even talk of Nintendo.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.720
Which if anyone was going to acquire Sega, I would want it to be Nintendo, which

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:47.080
would be ironic.

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:48.120
That would be super ironic.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.880
Yeah, that'd be interesting.

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:50.280
Yeah.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:55.880
Like if I could time travel to, you know, high school me and go, Hey, guess what?

01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:57.160
Nintendo owns Sega.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:02.040
People would look at me like I, you know, suddenly grew three, three.

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.880
I know it's, it's this ludicrous.

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:06.760
It's the talk of, you know, Super Mario Brothers is going to come out for

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:07.960
PlayStation five.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:12.280
Like the, the reaction you would have to that statement now is the reaction we

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.400
would have had in college too.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:18.040
Nintendo is, uh, in talks to buy Sega rumor, you know, even, it's just like,

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:18.760
no, they're, come on.

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:19.480
That's ridiculous.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:27.880
Yeah, but it is, uh, not super ridiculous in today's understanding.

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:28.520
So yeah.

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:29.080
Yeah.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:34.520
Um, and it's just been the slow decline of Sega, you know, but, oh, actually,

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:36.360
which reminds me of another game that I played, Rob.

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:40.360
I played crazy taxi on my iPad and it had the full sound.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:41.560
I had the full soundtrack.

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:42.060
Good.

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:43.640
Yeah.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:47.080
So, and anyway, I don't know why I didn't think about it until just now, but

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.280
Sega, Sega.

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:51.400
Um, tiger con chat says, I don't know about that.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:55.000
If Nintendo owns Sega and Nintendo would shut down all these Sonic fan

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.920
games and don't give them ideas.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:02.360
And there's, there's certainly been the rumors about Microsoft for a long

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:03.000
time.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.240
And then fantasy star online agreement or a faster online to excuse me,

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.360
agreement happened.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:09.880
And that just put fuel on the fire.

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:11.400
So that would be an interesting one too.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.280
Wouldn't it?

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:18.040
So yeah, yeah, I'd be very, I mean, I also am a big fan of Sega doing their

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:18.520
own thing.

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:22.200
I don't really like all these mega companies that are ending up, but if it

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.240
has to be bought, it's going to be interesting either way that goes.

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:28.280
If it isn't intent, I mean, I would rather see Sega go to a company like

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:31.560
Microsoft or Nintendo than, um, Konami or EA.

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:36.120
Oh, don't let, don't let EA do a hostile takeover of that one.

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:41.320
I would rather see people leave some of the big companies just for the sake

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.680
of building up Sega.

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:43.320
Yeah.

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:45.000
And make it a powerhouse again.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:51.320
That would be wishful thinking, but it would be nice, uh, pod culture and chat

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:53.240
says, imagine the Nintendo Dreamcast.

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:55.640
Hey, the Dreamcast mini could be a reality.

01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:57.640
I've already seen it.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:02.280
Remember when they, uh, they recompiled Mario 64 for the Dreamcast.

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.320
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.080
It's already a thing.

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:11.800
I'd love, I'd love that if, uh, even if Microsoft did it, that they would

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:14.920
invest in some of those Sega properties again, it'd be amazing.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:18.360
All right, let's move on a few more stories for you.

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:18.860
Loki.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:20.280
Yeah.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:24.040
So we just got an update for Animal Crossing because, you know, there's more

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.800
holidays right around the corner.

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.760
So there was an update on the 28th of January.

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:32.280
That's supposed to be prepping us for Valentine's day game day,

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:35.000
Groundhog day and FestiVale.

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:40.840
And FestiVale, well, it's spelled FestiVale.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:41.400
Okay.

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.480
So welcome to FestiVale.

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:46.840
Except that it's, it's a foreign word.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:47.340
So.

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:48.360
Fine.

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:48.920
Whatever.

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:49.480
I don't care.

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:53.240
They've got the twerking, uh, peacock there, you know, whatever you want to call it.

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:53.880
It doesn't matter.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:55.880
Peacock festival.

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:56.200
Yes.

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:56.700
Pave.

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:57.740
Pave.

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:02.120
Um, so that's going to be, I heard his name was Gay Rights.

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:06.920
Cause that's all I've heard about this event is that it's Gay Rights.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:09.080
I love Pave.

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:11.720
I haven't seen the event yet.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:14.120
I am starting, uh, starting tomorrow.

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:18.040
They're going to have a brand new set of outfits that are going to be available

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:22.360
and new reactions, including feeling it.

01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:24.600
Let's go Viva and confetti.

01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:27.080
That'd be fun.

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:27.960
Confetti would be fun.

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:28.460
Yeah.

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:29.260
Yeah.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:35.320
And, um, yeah, so lots of new stuff I've been trying to get my, well, um, my wife's been

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:40.440
trying to get my son to play it because I know that's my cat.

01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:41.880
Hi Stella.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:44.520
She's being loud.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.080
She knows that.

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:46.760
Um, what do you want?

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:52.520
Um, so anyways, yeah, new holiday stuff.

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:56.120
I'm still waiting for March when we're supposed to get that, the Nintendo stuff.

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:58.120
That's really the only thing I'm interested in.

01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.160
I think that's coming up later.

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:03.320
If anyone wants to know right now, you seasonal items are out.

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:09.720
Um, they do have like a football rug and a glittery megaphone, I guess for the

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:10.440
stupor bowl.

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:16.440
Um, and then there's also the sets of Boon, uh, set where you throw out the beans for

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:17.480
sets of Boon.

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.480
So all right.

01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:19.960
Pretty cool.

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:22.440
I like that we actually get all the international stuff.

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:27.960
Yeah, that is nice that we, it's not like locked to certain countries or whatever.

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:32.760
So yes, for those that are watching live, unfortunately it doesn't translate well into

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:37.960
the podcast, but Loki picked up the kitty and now the kitty just meow right in the mic.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.240
She sure did.

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:49.240
Well, this where every kitty has a voice, I'd rather hear what that cat has to say than

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.120
some Twitter users.

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:50.680
That's for sure.

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.240
Probably a better opinion too.

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:54.280
All right.

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:55.320
All right.

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:57.400
What is your stance on cat food?

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:58.200
I'm for it.

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:02.600
All right, let's move on.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:07.880
Uh, while Loki takes a minute to cuddle Stella there, uh, let's talk about Plex, the movie

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:10.920
company getting into gaming a little bit.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:16.760
Uh, Plex is getting into a arcade service that they, I guess, unofficially launched this

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.680
week with some old school games.

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:21.320
So Plex is a media streaming service right now.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.280
I think I've heard of this, but I can't say I've used it before.

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:28.200
Uh, and they do like TV and movies and audio and photos and things like that.

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:31.400
And now as of this week, they do Atari games.

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:38.680
If you subscribe to Plex arcade, you get Atari classics such as asteroids, missile command,

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:39.400
centipede.

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.560
There actually does appear to be a lot of them in here.

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.960
I'm just kind of looking through some of the screenshots.

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:46.120
A lot of the Atari classics are in there.

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:47.080
First party stuff.

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:49.400
You're not going to see the Activision stuff in there, like pitfall.

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:53.640
Um, and because that was, those are Activision games, just the first party Atari stuff.

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:57.240
Um, but they have stuff like I can see the 7,800 poking through where they have like

01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.160
Ninja golf is actually there.

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:01.960
And I'm like, Oh dang, this is, those are some deep cuts in there.

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:08.280
Um, anyhow, you can stream the games, uh, with Android, uh, to Android mobile or TV,

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:13.880
iOS, or TV, iOS, or any Chrome browser and any Bluetooth controller will allow you to

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:14.200
play them.

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:19.400
But what's interesting about this, the Plex thing, which is either $3 a month, if you're

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:26.920
already a Plex Pass owner or $5 a month, if you don't have that, um, you, uh, can actually

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:29.560
load your own ROMs onto this.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:37.000
And so that's the part that made me go, cause at first I'm like, okay, another company's

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.440
getting into retro gaming, whatever.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.400
But then I was like, wait a minute.

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:44.840
They actually going to allow you to load your own ROMs and even like emulators into the

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:45.800
library.

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:49.480
That's the part where I'm like, and they're, they're paying you to do it, or I'm sorry,

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:52.120
you're paying them for the privilege to do it.

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.320
That part's very interesting.

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:59.880
But I guess because Plex is a server type of thing, it's just the ease of playing it

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:04.280
on your TV as opposed to, I don't know, having to set up a Raspberry Pi or whatever.

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:08.200
And then you are legally getting all these Atari licenses with that.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:10.680
So that part's kind of interesting.

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:16.600
So, um, pod culture in chat says, uh, Zen, you are nuts.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.760
Plex works just fine and looks okay.

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:19.720
Well, what did Zen say?

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:24.600
Oh, Zen says, Plex has an awful UI that barely works half the time and now they want to stream

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:25.160
games.

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:25.880
No, thank you.

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:29.880
Uh, Darkdude Studio says, the concept is neat, but I hear there's a lot of lag when you're

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:32.040
streaming, at least in the demo I saw from YouTube.

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.840
And Bexobaka says the games suffer from lag.

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:36.200
So, all right.

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:36.760
Hmm.

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:38.920
Why can't someone just bring back game room?

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:40.280
Yeah, right?

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:43.960
Seriously, like why would that be so difficult?

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:47.000
Like you would think that someone would be able to come up with the same concept that's

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.920
just like, okay, hey, yeah.

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:53.560
I have an arcade with stuff in it and, you know, I can outfit it with games that you

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.160
can play and stuff like that.

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:55.960
I don't know.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:57.720
I have Antstream, which is pretty good.

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:02.920
Um, it's a lot of, uh, Commodore and Spectrum games and they're starting to get some Atari

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:03.560
games in it.

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:05.480
Um, disclosure, I back their Kickstarter.

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:06.600
That's why I'm still in it.

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.360
Cause I'm in my second year at this point.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.680
I think my sub will finally run out this summer.

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:13.880
Um, I wish they'd get the client on Xbox series X though.

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:15.800
They only have it on Xbox one.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:18.840
So it's weird to me that it's not on series X, but for whatever reason, it's not.

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:22.760
It's on PC as well, but it all, it streams everything.

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.200
Like it's, it's cloud gaming.

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:29.640
It's basically stadia, but since it's all classic games, there's very little bandwidth

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:32.680
actually being used because the resolution isn't that great.

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:33.000
Yeah.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:38.600
And no, actually there's a little bit of artifacting sometimes, but for the most part, especially

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:41.720
in regards to being responsive and stuff, the game's fine.

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:45.800
They just added, um, classic Mortal Kombat not that long ago, like the original arcade

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:47.560
Mortal Kombat that kind of surprised me.

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.080
So there was that.

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:49.800
All right.

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:54.520
Well, speaking of classic arcades, let's visit the classic game of the week.

01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:00.760
Every week, dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, Hey,

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:03.160
you brats, you should check this game out.

01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:06.200
Uh, load this onto your Plex server.

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:11.480
Although this one might be a little bit difficult and this one, this is also, uh, one of those

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.720
choices, I think for its uniqueness.

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:16.200
Um, but I guess I should let dark soccer speak to that.

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:18.360
So dark soccer brought this up in the past.

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:18.760
You have.

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:23.880
So what is the classic game of the week, which might take a second for the B roll to appear

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.320
as I think I forgot to preload it.

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:26.440
Sorry, but it'll come right up.

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:31.080
Well, well, not that there's really a lot going on on that video.

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:33.560
I believe I linked to the Dreamcast one.

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.120
You did.

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:40.200
Um, cause the Saturn has no video, but the game is real sound cause they know regret

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:42.040
or wind of regret.

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:47.000
Um, it was an audio adventure game that was developed by warp.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.080
It was first released on the Sega Saturn in July, 1997.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:59.640
And later on the Dreamcast in 1999, real sound was supposed to provide equal access for sighted

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:00.840
and blind players.

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:09.160
Um, so, um, to go actually a little bit more itself, um, warp's president, uh, uh, Kenji

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:16.600
created the game after, uh, getting appreciation letters from, uh, blind fans of his games

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:17.560
in Japan.

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:23.000
And he was thinking that it would be great to have visually disabled fans have games

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.720
that would be rich and involved that they could play and get into.

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:30.200
I'm actually going to read a quote from 2008.

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:31.640
Um, and an interview with one up.

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:36.360
I had a chance to visit people who are visually disabled and I learned that there are blind

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:38.040
people who play action games.

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:42.200
Of course, they're not able to have the full experience and they're kind of trying to force

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:45.480
themselves to be able to play, but they're making the effort.

01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:50.680
So I thought that if you turn off the monitor, both, both of you are hearing the same game.

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:54.360
So after you finish the game, you can have an equal conversation about it with blind

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:55.080
person.

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:58.760
That was the inspiration behind real sound cause I know regret as well.

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:04.280
So, um, he was really excited about it and he really pushed.

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:08.360
So, uh, and, and really a bargaining, uh, thing with Sega.

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:12.120
So, uh, he did that in exchange for exclusive rights to the game.

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:16.680
So they would donate a thousand Sega Saturn consoles to visually impaired people.

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:22.760
Um, and he also personally downloaded, uh, donated, sorry, a thousand copies of the game

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:23.960
along with the consoles.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:30.840
Um, and it's only been re-released once, but he said that it has to do with that deal he

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.840
has with, uh, with Sega.

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:39.320
Um, he's, he's basically, it was the only thing that was limiting it that could only

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:41.000
be released on a Sega console.

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:49.800
So, um, it has, uh, actually pretty good voice cast in it, including, um, a really popular

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:52.120
drama actress, uh, Miho Kanno.

01:16:52.600 --> 01:17:01.320
Um, Ai Maeda who has done some amazing voice acting, um, got, uh, actually a really good

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.720
composer, Keiichi Suzuki.

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:07.880
Um, he did, uh, uh, the blind swordsman, Datoichi and outrage.

01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:11.080
Um, Aki Koyano did the ending theme.

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:19.160
Um, and the game was actually written by, uh, a, uh, a screenwriter, uh, Yuji Sakamoto,

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:22.840
um, really, really talented group of people that worked on it.

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:33.160
So basically, um, the plot is about central elements, fear and love in a story in Tokyo.

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:37.960
So, uh, there's an elementary student is moved to a new school where she has to join new

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.560
students and seated next to a boy.

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:45.880
Um, the two fall in love, but, and they're really young and they want to elope and they

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:51.960
arranged to meet at the clock tower, but, um, the girl Izumi never shows up as she's transferred

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:55.800
away and then they meet again as college students.

01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:01.560
And so, um, they're dealing then with a mystery that has to do with the disappearance.

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:04.760
And so that's leading into the story of the game.

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:12.280
Um, and there are, by the way, translations, uh, online, um, for, uh, you can read.

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:19.160
Um, but it basically, um, there is a version, the Dreamcast one, uh, specifically that has

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:27.880
a visual mode that, um, it gives you like a little bit of extra, you know, scenery with

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:33.320
the game, but they both games still exclusively rely on the audio portions of the game.

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:37.800
Um, the, yeah, the Dreamcast visual mode is just really non-essential.

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:41.000
Um, and it's constructed as an interactive radio drama.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:47.640
Um, so you're basically listening to the story as it unfolds and you have different forks

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:52.200
in your plot line and you get a chime and that you have to choose the course that the

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:53.160
plot will take.

01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:57.800
Um, once you've confirmed your choice, then the plot resumes.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:00.520
So it's actually a choose your own adventure kind of story.

01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:04.600
Um, very, very unique.

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:12.360
Um, so, um, going further into it, the game really didn't sell very well.

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:18.920
Um, but it's really now considered, um, a collector's item because of Ena's other titles.

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:28.280
Um, they're, um, one of the cool things about this, especially for the collect, uh,

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:34.520
the collectability of it is that you get, um, like different, uh, instructions.

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:41.400
Like for example, in braille and you get seeds, a bag of herb seeds as they're listed, um,

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:43.720
and a transparent box of the cloud motif.

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:50.760
Um, I, I know someone who had, who had the seeds and that was what I brought up before.

01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:53.000
You were talking about things that come with games.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:53.500
Yeah.

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:55.880
You know, you could get a bag of seeds.

01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:04.520
So, um, so a version of this game with only one path, um, errored, uh, on, uh, a Tokyo

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:11.720
FM in 1997, um, and then there were other games of his that were actually released by

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:13.240
Real Sound's gameplay.

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:20.200
For example, um, for Enemy Zero that came out in 97 on Saturn, there were enemies that

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:23.000
were invisible and could only be located by sound.

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:30.200
And D2, another of his games, 2000 on Dreamcast, uh, really drew from the limitations to your

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.640
sensory perceptions.

01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:36.200
So there are portions of the game where the character is rendered blind with only a voice

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:37.400
to guide her.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:42.920
And alternatively, she, uh, another mode, death, where she only has her vision to guide

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:43.420
her.

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:49.960
There was a sequel, um, that was planned called Kiri no Orge.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:56.760
Um, it was in development to be the second game and it was going to, uh, there was, I

01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:58.040
can't make words happen.

01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:59.560
It was going to be a horror theme.

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:06.360
Um, and they had, uh, ads for it in various magazines, but the couldn't really do to voice

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:07.960
compression technology.

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:17.240
Some of the story, uh, arcs, um, uh, Kiri no Orge were, uh, put into D2, um, and then

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:22.760
into another game called, uh, well, there was actually going to be another installment

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:26.360
in the series called Spy Lunch, but that of course never developed.

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:33.800
So, um, but this game, um, is still actually popular amongst the visually disabled.

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:40.520
Um, and I really wanted to outline something that it, that was made specifically with that

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:41.560
community in mind.

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:48.440
You know, there are gamers all across the ability scale one way or another.

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:52.920
We, we have listeners of our show who are legally blind.

01:21:53.640 --> 01:22:01.800
Um, and I think that it's great that there was a game that was released specifically

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:06.280
for those people and people in chat are talking about Plex and not listening, I guess, but,

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:08.600
uh, we're having some frame drops as well.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:10.600
So it might not just be because of that.

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:11.900
Okay.

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:18.200
At any rate, I felt this game kind of was very important to me that we mentioned it

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:25.800
just simply because, I mean, we have such an A-list designer who was thinking of a

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:30.840
community that is so often left out of the gaming conversation.

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:39.720
And I wish that more, um, more developers would have different things.

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:45.560
Like for example, say that, you know, for certain levels of, uh, the visually impaired,

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.240
you have like a high contrast mode.

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:49.160
Right.

01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:49.660
Right.

01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:53.320
Well, and Last of Us Part II had a lot of this type of stuff, which was great.

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:54.440
Exactly.

01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:54.940
Exactly.

01:22:55.480 --> 01:23:02.280
But I think that, that there needs to be, um, there needs to be more games that are created

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:06.200
with our other ability communities in mind.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:12.280
I'm going to bring it back to the main shot of us away from the, uh, footage, just because

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:13.960
I want to see if that fixes some of our issues.

01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:14.680
I might not.

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.960
Sorry, we're, we're getting internet drops that are kind of out of my control.

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:19.000
I don't know what the hell's going on.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:19.500
Sorry.

01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:20.360
All right.

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:27.000
Well, at any rate, I would have really liked to have had, um, the other stories come out.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:32.040
Um, I, it just, to me just seems so fun to have like a drama that you can play.

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:36.840
Of course, my comprehension, um, when, when I almost bought a copy of the game, but my

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:40.040
comprehension was not where it needed to be to play it properly.

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:40.680
Right.

01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:44.600
So, um, I wonder if I would be able to go back and play it now.

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:45.900
Maybe not.

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:50.520
Um, I was just to say the vibe I kind of get from the game, you know, even though it's,

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:55.960
um, very light on the graphics, because obviously it's, it's with a different medium in mind.

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:57.080
Well, the Saturn had none.

01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:03.240
I, well, I, but I still get that vibe of, um, like an old CD-ROM game that, you know,

01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:08.040
you kind of have those very like photographic quality visuals, but they were very simple.

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:08.700
Like Myst?

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:15.480
I, in a way, I guess, but, um, even more like photo, Myst wasn't really photo realistic.

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:19.080
Whereas like, you know, the game we were looking at here was very photo realistic in a way.

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:23.640
Um, I think it's, it's kind of neat because it's just that early CD-ROM technology really

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:25.800
tried to like, Ooh, make it look real.

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:29.720
You know, I'd almost say in a way, like, I don't know, something like Phantasmagoria,

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:29.960
right.

01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:31.320
It was like real people.

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:32.840
Phantasmagoria was great.

01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:33.080
Right.

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:39.320
And like a real scene and all this stuff, you know, even though it was all cheesy B

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:43.640
community theater, uh, special effects still, you know, that game was kind of legendary

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:44.280
for all of that.

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:47.960
And I think, you know, this game that you just showed us kind of, you know, it still

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:52.600
has that photo realism, obviously just to try, try to invoke images, probably of the

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:58.760
story that's being told, but, you know, even for, I, cause unfortunately I think sometimes

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.000
people hear this, you know, this is true.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.920
People hear, Oh, this is a game made for a certain audience.

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:07.800
And if that audience isn't them, then they're like, ah, then what's here for me?

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:08.760
Nothing, you know?

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:09.880
And they skip over it.

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:10.520
Right.

01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:13.960
But like, this seems like the type of thing that like could actually just be totally meant

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:16.440
to like, you kind of have playing on the TV or whatever.

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:19.640
And you're just chilling on the couch, kind of laying back, eyes closed.

01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:21.080
You don't even have to look at the game.

01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:23.320
You can experience the media in a different way.

01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:28.120
And so it's like, sometimes it's about broadening the way you consume things, which I think

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:28.680
is interesting.

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:34.920
Well, and the thing, the thing is that there are very few games that are just audio only.

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:40.920
Another one that comes to mind is Papa Sangre, which actually just got, it got a sequel in

01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:44.840
2013, but it's a horror themed audio game that came out on iOS.

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:51.160
So there's, there's a few other ones.

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:57.400
Like there's also Chillingham is another one that came out in 2004, but I picked this one

01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:05.080
in particular simply because it, it was one of the big games that really put a lot of

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:06.920
focus on it in Japan.

01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:09.080
It's a damn shame we never got a version of it here.

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:16.040
I think that that certainly or at least had other language releases in general, because

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.800
I think a lot of people would have benefited from it.

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:21.000
Well, and there was really nothing like it on the Dreamcast or the Saturn, you know,

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.360
but I say I call it Dreamcast specifically because the Dreamcast was always that weird

01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:25.800
system, you know?

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:31.880
And then here was another off the track of usual stuff thing that it tried.

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:35.080
And, you know, just, I bet a lot of people didn't even know this existed.

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:44.760
But it's, it's definitely one of those more interesting games and hopefully my goal is,

01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:50.280
this might sound like a little odd goal, but I would like to one day have my listening

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:52.360
comprehension be good enough to play this game.

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:53.560
All right.

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:54.760
Yep.

01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:55.480
So there you go.

01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:55.880
Well, thank you.

01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:57.800
Real sounds cause a no regret.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:58.280
Okay.

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:00.360
Your classic game of the week.

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:04.600
Very, I honestly, I thought I've heard of them all, but I did not hear of this game

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:06.440
until looking at it for tonight's show.

01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:07.240
So very cool.

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:09.720
Well, I did tell you about it, about the seeds.

01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:11.400
You did, but you tell me about a lot of games.

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:17.720
This is the first time I've actually like seen it, you know, and gotten to, you know,

01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:18.360
check it out.

01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:21.720
So wait till you see the fucking weird game I picked for next month.

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:22.040
All right.

01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:22.440
Can't wait.

01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:22.760
Oh yeah.

01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:24.200
Cause we're still in January.

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:27.720
We're still in, it's like, there's a lot of five episodes in January this month.

01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:31.480
I already have next week's regular game picked out, but the week after is going to be the

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:32.040
weirdo.

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:33.000
Oh, perfect.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.760
That'll be just in time for Valentine's day.

01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:35.960
So perfect.

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:36.600
Well, yeah.

01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:41.400
Then, you know, uh, when I, I'll tell you what it is early, Robin, you'll laugh your

01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:41.800
face off.

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:42.120
So, okay.

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:44.760
Well, obviously not now don't ruin it for the listeners, but tell me later, text it

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:45.400
or something.

01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:50.200
Um, the, uh, well, yes, there, there is that little football game on TV next week.

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.600
Although that's never stopped us before.

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:54.920
Um, not going to stop us from doing the show.

01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:58.600
And I said, did you pick something themed with the football game?

01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:00.600
Is that why you already know next week?

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:01.000
Excuse me.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:01.480
Nope.

01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:01.960
Oh, okay.

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:02.600
I was curious.

01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:04.120
All right.

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:06.280
Let's move on.

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:10.440
Let's talk about, I was, I was usually, I don't, the only thing I care about with those

01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:12.920
games, the commercials are kind of neat sometimes.

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:16.120
And I did see, cause y'all posted about it in discord.

01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:19.720
I saw that whole like Wayne's world is coming back.

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:23.400
Like they actually have Mike Meyers and Dana Carvey doing a Wayne's world for, I guess

01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:30.440
it's Uber eats who also had, you know, um, uh, I keep wanting to say Jean-Luc Picard,

01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:31.000
but that's not his name.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:36.840
Patrick Stewart and, um, Skywalker, Mark Hamill, Mark Hamill.

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:39.080
We're in a commercial together for Uber eats.

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:41.720
So they've been getting, getting, paying a lot of, uh, big celebrities.

01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:44.680
So they got Mike Meyers and Dana Carvey to reunite and do Wayne's world.

01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:46.440
So I guess that's a commercial for the super bowl.

01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:47.880
So that, that's kind of neat.

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:52.040
I guess I like the commercial sometimes, but you can see them all online the day before

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:52.840
the day after.

01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:53.640
Easy, easy.

01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:58.120
And then usually about the puppy bowl, usually the puppy bowl and the kitty half time, which

01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:01.960
aren't Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg doing it this year or something.

01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:06.040
Somebody posted something discord about like Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg are doing the

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:06.520
animal bowl.

01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:08.280
Snoop is trending on Twitter right now.

01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:09.320
Huh?

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:12.200
Chad, I think it's for the Super Bowl.

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:12.760
All right.

01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:13.800
The superb owl.

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:17.800
And then, um, the other thing I usually care about is the halftime show.

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:23.800
Like when Beyonce did the halftime show life when lady Gaga did the halftime show life

01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:26.120
when Beyonce did the halftime show again.

01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:29.080
Uh, but she just snuck in there as part of Coldplay life.

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:30.760
Like it was, it was great.

01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:33.560
Um, I think this year they have the weekend doing it.

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:36.280
Um, who I actually don't even care about the halftime show.

01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:38.120
I like, well, I like, I like his stuff.

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:39.480
I'd be curious to see how it comes out.

01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:41.560
I think I love the, uh, Cynthia vibe.

01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:45.160
A lot of his songs have, he has a very like old school, Michael Jackson sound to him,

01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:46.200
which I really dig.

01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:49.400
Um, but, uh, I think he has a ton of guest stars too.

01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:50.600
I don't think it's just him.

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:53.320
Let me be curious to see how that turns out, but, uh, yeah.

01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:54.680
Anyway.

01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:56.280
All right.

01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:57.160
Moving on.

01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:00.360
Let's get into some rapid fire news.

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:04.280
Uh, Loki, let's, uh, start us off with some quick stories.

01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:05.080
Loki, Loki.

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:05.480
Yeah.

01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:08.760
So we talked a little bit last week about what the games for gold for February are going

01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:11.480
to be, but now let's talk about PlayStation plus.

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:15.000
So for PlayStation five, we've got destruction all stars.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.120
And then we have on PlayStation four control ultimate edition, which is also on PS five

01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:23.080
and concrete genie, all pretty solid titles actually.

01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:25.000
So that's going to be for February.

01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:34.280
And then we got news that there's a, there was a baseball, um, game that's, you know,

01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:40.840
all, uh, you know, uh, NBA jam or, um, what was it NFL?

01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:43.320
Uh, I can't remember the NFL one.

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:44.520
Anyways, NFL blitz.

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:45.240
That's right.

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:50.680
And so they had a game coming or that was being worked on called power at baseball.

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:55.960
And it was developed in the mid nineties by Midway and incredible technologies.

01:30:55.960 --> 01:31:01.960
Of course it never actually came out, but because, uh, the video game history foundation

01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:03.080
is awesome.

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:08.680
You can actually play a ROM of it on Mame and check out the game itself.

01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:10.680
So that is pretty cool.

01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:17.000
And I don't know, it just never came out because I guess, I don't know.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:23.320
They maybe thought that they didn't translate as well as say NBA jam or NFL.

01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:25.960
Maybe the licensing didn't come through for some of the people.

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:27.320
I bet that could be an issue too.

01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:33.240
So, but yeah, it looks pretty cool and get a chance to play something that, you know,

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:33.800
could have been.

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:34.600
Yeah.

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:39.640
Um, and a shout out cause Jason who, you know, does all our voiceovers and did an amazing

01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:41.080
job with the intro as always.

01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:47.320
Um, Jason talked about, um, some other alternative, like actiony baseball type of games, uh, that

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:48.760
did come out like baseball stars.

01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:49.480
I remember that one.

01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:51.000
And that's, that's a great one as well.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:51.400
So yeah.

01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:52.760
That on Neo Geo.

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:53.160
Yeah.

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:55.080
Well, there was a version on NES, believe it or not.

01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:56.040
Yeah.

01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:56.520
I know.

01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:57.000
Yeah.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.880
So yeah, but it's probably better known for Neo Geo for sure, but yeah.

01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:02.120
Uh, all right, moving on.

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:07.800
Uh, let's talk about destiny two, which destiny two is going to be changing up the way it

01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:09.320
does rewards a little bit.

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:11.320
There will no longer be weekly bounties.

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:15.800
They're going to go to seasonal, seasonal challenges to try to make things feel a little

01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:17.320
less grindy, I guess.

01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:20.920
Um, so that is what you can do now.

01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:25.800
So there's some goals, uh, that bungee went through and how to make the game more fun.

01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:30.360
Uh, in, in, in other words, provide a guide to new returning and veteran players for what

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:34.520
to do today or this week guide the player through the seasonal content week over week,

01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:38.920
encourage players to engage with complexities and nuances of the seasonal activity and rituals

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:43.320
and reduce the penalties on XP and bright dust for missing a giver given week.

01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:46.600
So they've done a seasonal challenges now that you do objectives.

01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:51.480
And you can do objectives during the week, but you have until the end of the season really

01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:52.520
to complete them.

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:54.520
Um, not just that one week period.

01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:57.640
So, um, you know, you see a lot of games doing seasonal things.

01:32:57.640 --> 01:32:59.960
So destiny two going that direction makes sense.

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:02.760
Um, I have been playing that a little bit on series X.

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:04.600
I haven't played in the last week or two.

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:06.840
Um, but it's a real pretty game.

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:09.160
They, they definitely souped it up for series X.

01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:10.600
It looks real good.

01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:12.120
So I should play some more of that.

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:12.760
That's for sure.

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:16.200
And man, I wish they had something like this when I was younger.

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:22.360
Um, Lego just put out their own type of app that is for music video making for kids.

01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:28.440
It's called video, but it's V I D I Y O video.

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:30.360
That's basically what it is.

01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:35.000
So this is a app that allows kids to make their own music videos.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.560
Um, when you have certain, of course, Lego figures and blocks, you scan them into the

01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:43.880
app and it makes the characters go into song and dance with AR.

01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:48.280
And then of course, because it's all AR, you can choose where you want to put the

01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:51.880
characters in the real world and then kind of, you know, use your camera to shoot them

01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:52.680
a little bit.

01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:57.240
Um, some of the music comes from universal music groups, uh, pop roster, and there are

01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:00.840
60 seconds samples, so they don't put the whole songs in there, but you can make a little

01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:01.960
bit of a sample there.

01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:03.160
And I think that's really cute.

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:06.680
Like, you know, get kids, you know, making their own movies when they're young.

01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:07.720
I think that's pretty cool.

01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:09.960
And a good use of that AR technology.

01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:13.080
Interesting to see Lego doing that again, because of course, you know, we talked a lot

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:18.120
about the Mario Legos they've done, um, towards the end of last year, and that used a lot

01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:19.720
of interesting technology as well.

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:23.320
So Legos really pushing the envelope y'all.

01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:24.440
All right.

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:29.560
They've also got, well, aside from that, they have their stop motion studio thing that they

01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:32.920
had a set that you could use your phone to do that.

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:35.400
Um, they've been pushing stuff with unity.

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:41.480
They have their whole Lego, uh, you know, I guess not really a tutorial, but it's kind

01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:43.560
of like a kit that you can create stuff with.

01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:47.320
So yeah, they've been doing a lot of stuff with like gaming involved.

01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:49.960
All right.

01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:51.320
Well, let's move on to our Sakura.

01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:56.600
Of course, animal crossing happiness.

01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:00.360
I was so thrilled when I saw this, even though I pretty much already have the cards.

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:05.080
Um, but, uh, they are doing the Sanrio amiibo cards.

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:12.120
They're coming out at target, um, exclusively at target on March 26th.

01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:16.360
Um, they are, uh, six different cards.

01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:23.960
Um, these were actually, um, put out for the, uh, welcome amiibo edition of, uh, animal

01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:24.840
crossing new leaf.

01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:31.320
Um, so you get Rila, who is the hello kitty gorilla, who's kind of creepy.

01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:33.160
You get Marty, huh?

01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:33.880
I was just laughing.

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:34.840
Oh yeah.

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:41.320
You get Marty, who is the, um, a yellow pom pom pudding, um, character.

01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:43.320
You have Chai who is so cute.

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:46.760
She's an elephant with a teacup on her head and she's for pom pom pudding.

01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:49.400
Chelsea is, uh, my melody.

01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:55.240
Toby is, I actually really liked his set in, uh, in pocket camp too.

01:35:55.240 --> 01:36:01.240
And who is, uh, little twin stars, which little twin stars is my favorite Sanrio group.

01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:08.680
What I don't see on here though, is if you're going to be able to welcome the characters.

01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:17.000
Um, it says right here that it's only going to be to unlock the in-game posters, which

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:23.880
I mean, I already have, but, um, I'm really hoping that they put out a patch to give us

01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:31.320
those animals, because it would be nice to, for me to have Etoile in my, uh, in my village.

01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:31.480
Yeah.

01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:32.840
That's what I was hopeful about too.

01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:37.480
But then I guess, you know, if these cards have existed in Japan already, since the game's

01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:40.120
launched, then if the characters were going to be there, they'd be there.

01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:45.000
But I, I, I still am crossing my fingers and toes that maybe with the, uh, unveiling of

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.840
the cards officially in the U S maybe they'll patch the game and add the villagers and then

01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:49.960
Japan can enjoy that too.

01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:53.880
Cause they, I imagine either they have the cards accessible or they, they could do a

01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:55.000
reprint pretty easily.

01:36:55.640 --> 01:37:01.160
Well, and on top of that, um, if you've still, if you still have new leaf, then you can get

01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:01.800
the characters there.

01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:02.280
I reckon.

01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:07.080
Well, it says they also have furniture in new leaf as well.

01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:10.120
Well, yeah, that was the point of them.

01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:12.680
They brought in a different furniture sets.

01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:15.720
Those furniture sets are cute too.

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:18.360
I want them in, uh, in, uh, the new one.

01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:20.040
Like why pocket camp?

01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:25.560
And I had like all of, um, stuff and Toby's the set.

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:26.060
Yeah.

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:28.520
The set was like ultra Japanese.

01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:29.160
It was so cute.

01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:32.600
But why restrict it to the 3d S version of the game?

01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:37.320
That's so old, but I guess, you know, because they were made for the 3d S version.

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:43.480
No, but the amiibos were made for certain things and then they, uh, use them in later

01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:43.800
games.

01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:46.360
Like most amiibo were for smash brothers.

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:47.000
Right.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:53.240
There's a, there are a lot of animal crossing characters who I have a physical amiibo for,

01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:57.080
and I have their cards that the character is not in the game.

01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:03.000
Like, remember I had my Pascal poster before I could get a picture with Pascal before his

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:03.640
model was out.

01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:05.720
I had the pave poster.

01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:07.240
I sent you the pave poster.

01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:08.920
Yes, I have the pave poster.

01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:13.400
And now I can get pave in my studio, you know, because I have the card, but like you can't

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:16.280
get, um, uh, chip.

01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:25.400
You can't get porter or Booker and copper or, uh, well for a while you couldn't get

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:28.760
the llamas and then they did their little wedding thing and then you could get them.

01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:34.200
Um, but you can't get Peli or Phyllis.

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:34.840
I love Phyllis.

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:35.640
She's so grumpy.

01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:36.600
Maybe that's just what it is.

01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:39.480
We have to wait for more events because we're, we've been getting some of them as they've

01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:40.200
released events.

01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:42.920
Like pave is a good example of that, of the events that they're doing.

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:44.280
We just have to wait for more events, I guess.

01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:46.840
But these, these, uh, Hello Kitty ones are villagers.

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:51.800
And so that would be neat if they would put, let them move into the village, but I guess

01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:52.280
it's a lot to ask for.

01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:55.640
I don't see it happening though, unless they figure out some way to do it.

01:38:55.640 --> 01:39:01.000
But at least the thing with, with, um, this Animal Crossing is that the game we have now

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.160
is not quite the same game we got when it came out.

01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:03.660
True.

01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:06.120
It's got lots of other stuff to do.

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:11.400
So moving on, since this is supposed to be rapid fire, um, Nintendo, huh?

01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:12.440
I just was just laughing.

01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:21.560
Oh, Nintendo announced a, uh, monster Hunter rise, uh, special edition switch and, uh,

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:27.240
and also a switch pro controller, uh, for, uh, the same that will be out when the game

01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:29.400
is released in Japan on March 26th.

01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:33.160
Uh, the price will be 38,400 yen.

01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:38.600
So roughly about, you know, 30 or 380 bucks us.

01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:44.600
And it has, of course, the, the doc, the unit, the joy cons that are all monster Hunter rise

01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:45.100
themed.

01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:50.600
Um, and then you can also get the digital copy of the game.

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:54.920
And for the pre-order bonus, there's a deluxe kit with downloadable content.

01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:55.640
It looks cool.

01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:57.720
I'm not in a monster Hunter, but it looks cool.

01:39:57.720 --> 01:39:58.220
Yeah.

01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:01.480
Nothing of course about, you know, the U S so.

01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:03.580
All right.

01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:05.160
All right.

01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:08.520
Well, let's travel around the world, starting in the U S and looking at the rest of the

01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:12.040
world too, and check out what will be coming out in release dates.

01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:12.540
Loki.

01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:13.560
Yes.

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:19.160
Uh, so this week we have cultists simulator on Nintendo switch, uh, destruction all stars

01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:25.800
on PlayStation five, uh, ease nine monstrum knocks on PlayStation four.

01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:34.440
Uh, we have habroxia two on PC PlayStation four Vita, Xbox one and Nintendo switch.

01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:42.920
Uh, Haven on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four sky forge on Nintendo switch, uh, werewolf,

01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:50.040
the apocalypse earth blood on PC PlayStation four PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series

the complete edition on PlayStation five and then on PC and PlayStation four Neo to the

01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:04.120
complete edition.

01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:04.680
And that's it.

01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:06.200
All right.

01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:08.360
Well, Japan's list is pretty short this week.

01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:12.840
Just that Neo collection, Neo one and two on the PlayStation five.

01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:16.680
And then as you were saying, Neo to kind of remastered on the PlayStation four, that is

01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:16.760
it.

01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:19.000
Those are the soul releases in Japan this week.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.360
So how about the UK dark soccer?

01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:22.520
Only a handful.

01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:26.840
We have werewolf, the apocalypse earth blood on the 4th of February.

01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:31.640
And then on the 5th, we have anima arcane edition and ghost of the tail collectors

01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:32.140
edition.

01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:33.960
All right.

01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:35.240
All right.

01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:39.560
Well, we have a few more stories for you guys before we get to the listener round table

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:42.120
via our chat, as well as our mailbag.

01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:45.720
And you can always email the show, participate at orange lounge radio.com.

01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:47.720
If you want to drop us a line via email.

01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:49.960
Um, but let's get to some more news Loki.

01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:53.400
So everybody's probably familiar with the game Celeste.

01:41:53.400 --> 01:42:00.920
I was unaware that the game originally was released on the Pico eight, um, back in 2016

01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:03.640
and now, uh, extremely okay.

01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:10.280
Games is creating a sequel for that, uh, Pico eight version called Celeste to, uh, Lonnie's

01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:14.040
Trek, which is actually available to download now for free.

01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:16.920
Um, so that's pretty sweet.

01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:20.840
And then you can find that on itch, the IO, um, check it out there.

01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:28.200
But I had no idea that that was actually a, uh, game on the Pico eight.

01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:28.360
Yeah.

01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:29.400
I didn't realize that either.

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:30.200
That's pretty cool though.

01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:31.480
That game's everywhere now though.

01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:32.760
Yeah.

01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:36.120
I'm kind of curious to see if they're going to, you know, port that over to the, like

01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:37.560
the newer style or something like that.

01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:40.360
That'd be kind of cool, but, um, have to check it out.

01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:41.400
Yeah.

01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:42.200
Why not?

01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:44.040
Why not let the sequel get some of that too?

01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:49.080
Cause you know, and they've, they've, um, given it away like as a plus game or a gold

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:53.080
game and, you know, there's a lot of ways, uh, Epic store, I think had it as their free

01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:53.960
game at one point.

01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:57.080
So there's a lot of ways you've probably added this to your library at some point.

01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:59.720
And it is, it's not just like, Oh yay, free game.

01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:04.600
It actually is a really like, like bang your head against the wall, tough, like platformer,

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:08.360
but it's, you know, kind of one of those, I would compare it a lot to super meat boy,

01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:09.640
like back when it was good.

01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:12.120
Um, to like, you know, Oh, just one more.

01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:14.600
I'm gonna try this level one more time, one more time.

01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:16.840
I'm going to beat it this time.

01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:18.600
It's it's that whole kind of thing.

01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:19.800
It's a neat game.

01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:21.400
So, all right.

01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:26.840
Um, moving on, let's talk about a remaster that didn't happen, but man, I wish we

01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:30.680
wish it would have, and that is a GoldenEye 007.

01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:33.240
It was originally going to be for Xbox live arcade.

01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:37.720
Now, please don't confuse this with the version of GoldenEye that ended up being on the Wii

01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:39.800
by Activision a little bit later.

01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:44.200
Um, this is not that, uh, this was something else that was supposed to happen, uh, that

01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:47.880
was actually, and some of the footage has actually been released now.

01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:53.640
Uh, so there's a YouTube out there where somebody is actually playing it through an emulator.

01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:57.560
So they're actually able to see it in like 4k resolution and 60 frames a second, but

01:43:57.560 --> 01:43:59.320
you can tell it's a 360 game.

01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:01.000
I mean it, but it still looks really good.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.480
It looks even better than the Nintendo 64 game.

01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:07.160
And they even do some multiplayer in it, same screen multiplayer, which is how most people

01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:11.800
remember GoldenEye 007 was playing it with friends at a party or in a college dorm or

01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:12.840
something like that.

01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:19.400
Uh, this whole exercise was from 2007 because a rare of being owned by Microsoft developed

01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:22.760
the HD remaster of the Nintendo 64 classic.

01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:26.440
Unfortunately, thanks to copyright disputes, it didn't happen.

01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:27.560
That's a bummer.

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:31.800
Um, of course we got the Activision version, which, um, for the Wii was, you know, the

01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:33.320
Wii didn't have a lot of great shooters.

01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:35.960
And apparently this, I didn't play a lot of it.

01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:40.600
I think I played it at E3 real quick one year, but, um, apparently a lot of people said it,

01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:41.640
it really wasn't bad.

01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:44.920
Like it could have been a lot worse as far as like remasters go.

01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:48.120
And they did a pretty decent job on the Wii, but I think there's a lot of people that want

01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:50.120
to see what Rare themselves would have done.

01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:52.040
And this is, this is certainly it.

01:44:52.040 --> 01:45:00.920
So, um, there's rumors that they're going to release this in 2021 as some type of Xbox

01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:01.720
thing.

01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:05.560
Um, Hey, if they get the licensing and all that stuff worked out, go off.

01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:10.200
Like, Hey, if they added that to game pass, that's just another cool thing on game pass

01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:10.920
in my opinion.

01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:16.520
So, um, yeah, especially since how many same room multiplayer games are there anymore?

01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:17.880
There's so few, right?

01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:24.840
So anyway, um, dark Tetsuya says, I do believe the Wii version got re-released on PS3 and

01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:25.880
360 as well.

01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:26.360
Did it?

01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:29.720
I only ever remember the Wii one, but you're probably, you're probably right.

01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:31.960
I just remember the, the motion control.

01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:34.120
Of course, that was the big thing they were pushing, right?

01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:38.920
Because on the Wii and in some games did this very well where you would, you'd point at

01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:42.280
the screen to shoot and it was almost like using a mouse and keyboard.

01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:43.720
It was like mouse and controller.

01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:45.240
It was really weird, but it worked.

01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:45.880
It worked really well.

01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:46.520
Yeah.

01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:51.320
So, uh, some games did this better than others, but, um, the golden eye remaster was one of

01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:52.120
them that did it pretty well.

01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:54.040
All right, moving on.

01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:54.680
Dark Sakura.

01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:04.840
A little discussion, um, especially with, uh, the particular game, Astral Chain.

01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:08.280
Uh, Platinum said that Nintendo is the owner of the IP.

01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:14.680
Um, this came after fans noticed that the game's copyright had, that there was a change

01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:15.640
to the game's copyright.

01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:25.720
Um, so, uh, platinum, um, had said before that it was co-owned by itself and Nintendo

01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:31.080
in addition to the, to them having, uh, uh, the game's publishing rights.

01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:36.360
Um, and they had even talked about one day it might come, you know, to non-Nintendo platforms,

01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:40.440
but basically there was the change and the copyright notice had been modified to remove

01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:41.800
the mention of platinum games.

01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:49.640
And so they came right out and says, it's as it looks, it is Nintendo and it's on their

01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:51.400
website as it's Nintendo.

01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:56.600
Um, and they say that right now platinum games is not in a position to answer the question,

01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:59.480
uh, to clarify anything about that change in ownership.

01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:05.080
I wonder if Nintendo is planning on doing something with it, hence the change.

01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:05.880
It's interesting.

01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:06.680
Maybe.

01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:07.640
Maybe.

01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:12.920
Um, speaking of platinum and Nintendo, how about an update on Bayonetta 3, platinum?

01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:17.000
Like, I'm sure I'm not the only one to ask this, but, uh, it's been a little while since

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.520
we heard anything about Bayonetta 3.

01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:24.200
It'd be crappy if Sega does get sold, you know, to someone who's not Nintendo.

01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:27.560
Um, I don't, I doubt they'll do that.

01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:30.440
I think the agreement would already be in writing.

01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:31.480
I don't think they'd be able to do it.

01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:32.520
I mean, I guess anything's possible.

01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:33.320
I don't know.

01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:37.720
But, um, still I'm all about take the time to get it right.

01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:39.000
You know, don't rush the game.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.040
There's been a pandemic.

01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:41.000
I get all that.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:45.320
Uh, still just a little, a little teaser, a new little update would be, would be wonderful.

01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:47.880
That would, that would give me the energy I need to get through the year.

01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:52.120
So hopefully the Switch is just setting up for a badass year.

01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:55.000
Maybe Bayonetta 3 got pushed to be a Switch Pro game.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:00.920
One can dream, but can you imagine that the new Zelda and a new Metroid game, like all

01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:04.360
hitting at once, like, Oh, that'd be such, that'd be such a hot year.

01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:07.960
Like if that's what the Switch Pro's lining up, that's a hot launch lineup.

01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:11.800
I I'm, I'm fan, but I'm going to admit, I fully admit I am fanboying.

01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:16.840
None of this is based in reality whatsoever, but what a hot lineup that would be.

01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:17.960
That's for sure.

01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:18.360
All right.

01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:20.280
Uh, moving on Loki.

01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:22.200
Yeah.

01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:25.320
So, uh, some more cyberpunk updates.

01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:30.840
So we talked about how there was the 1.1 update, which did fix some stuff, but also

01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:33.000
introduced some game breaking bugs.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:40.360
So now there's the 1.11 update that will fix those game breaking bugs that they last

01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:41.640
patch introduced.

01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:45.640
So they went ahead and released those already, the hot fix for that.

01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:50.040
And it's taking care of some of the issues that were in that.

01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:52.920
There's also some more updates coming as well.

01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:55.880
Second one's due out in a few weeks.

01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:00.680
So, um, we'll have to wait and see what that improves as well, but at least to see

01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:04.280
that they're addressing some of the issues like they had with, uh, the hollow calls,

01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:05.480
not coming through and stuff like that.

01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:09.720
Um, and then on a completely different topic.

01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:18.840
So there's been mods for cyberpunk 2077 that allows you to, um, change, uh, who the

01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:21.240
different joy toys are in the game.

01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:25.240
So those are the like, uh, cybernetic prostitutes.

01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:32.120
And so of course, since Johnny Silverhand is in the game, they've went ahead and swapped

01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:33.240
out the character.

01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:39.240
Um, that's normally the quote unquote, joy toy and put Keanu Reeves in there.

01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:43.880
Or you can also, uh, put in, uh, one of the other characters that they had in there as

01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:44.200
well.

01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:50.280
But Loki, Loki, Loki, was there any doubt that once we knew that cyberpunk would, would

01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:55.160
yes, be a PC game and that yes, Keanu Reeves would be in the game.

01:49:55.160 --> 01:50:00.360
Was there any doubt that the modding community was going to come along and be like, how long

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:02.200
until I can fuck Keanu Reeves?

01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:05.960
Like, are we shocked?

01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:06.600
Are we shocked?

01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:07.160
I am.

01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:07.560
I'm not.

01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:13.240
Apparently though, what is interesting though is apparently they have removed that mod.

01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:16.200
Um, it's so it is not available.

01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:16.920
Nothing.

01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:18.360
Nothing has ever truly removed.

01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:26.920
So Nexus, Nexus mods did take it down, but you know, um, I'm sure you can find it out

01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:27.420
there.

01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:31.000
So, uh, Nexus mods is having a week, aren't they?

01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:32.360
Yeah.

01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:33.640
Apparently, well, CG.

01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:37.720
So it came to the way it got taken down as it came to a CD project.

01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:38.920
Red's attention.

01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:44.040
Uh, the studio had said that our most important rule regarding user generated content, uh,

01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:47.800
game mods in particular is that it can't be harmful towards others.

01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:53.320
In the case of model swaps, especially those involved in explicit situations, it can be

01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:59.000
perceived as such by people who lent us their parents for, as a Korean characters in, uh,

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:00.600
cyberpunk 2077.

01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:01.400
Sorry, internet.

01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:04.520
You'll just have to fuck your Keanu Reeves body pillow you bought on wish.

01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:05.800
I mean,

01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:13.720
I mean, whatever it could have been a lot worse.

01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:16.520
He was so clothed in the scenes from what I saw.

01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:20.920
But then again, the video that they were showing a lot of that was, uh, cut and like blacked

01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:21.160
out.

01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:24.520
But, um, I mean, it's just a model swap.

01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:27.800
So, but I'm sure it can be much worse.

01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:31.160
And of course, just wait, it's early.

01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:33.320
If that game's only been out a couple of months, it's early.

01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:37.000
No, the correct way to phrase that is not, it could be much worse.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:37.560
It is.

01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:38.760
It will be much worse.

01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:41.160
It's true.

01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:42.680
Very true.

01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:47.320
Let's revisit the story in six months and see what perverse things the internet has

01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:48.120
come up with now.

01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:50.540
Yeah.

01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:52.280
All right.

01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:57.560
Well, Hey, now that the, now that they have the, the three model out there, I mean, I'm

01:51:57.560 --> 01:52:01.000
sure it'll be a matter of time before we see him added to the Skyrim or something like

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:01.500
that.

01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:04.920
All right, let's move on.

01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:06.920
Uh, let's see.

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:11.080
Oh, a comment from Marissa Meisel in our chat who says the union has been taking things

01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:15.480
like this seriously, not just because of funny sex things, but so actors are exploited

01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:17.080
for things they weren't paid for.

01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:23.000
You know, that is, I I've heard about that in regards to who was in the game.

01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:24.600
Heavy.

01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:26.680
Was it heavy rain with the shower scene?

01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:28.040
Was that Elliot?

01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:29.240
Was that Elliot Page?

01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:30.440
Was it somebody else?

01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:30.920
No.

01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:32.920
Elliot Page was in the sequel.

01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:37.080
She was in the, um, Oh gosh, I don't remember what it was.

01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:37.960
With like, uh,

01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:41.800
why do I remember?

01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:43.320
Why do I remember?

01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:50.440
Remember it's he now, but yes, I understand when the, in the game, but, um, let's see,

01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:57.560
Elliot Page, there was like a shower scene or something and they had rendered breasts

01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:05.400
and that was really infuriating to, um, Elliot Page because obviously

01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:06.840
It was beyond two souls.

01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:08.920
That's his beyond two souls.

01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:09.880
Thank you.

01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:13.720
And, um, that was not part of the agreement basically.

01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:19.720
And so when that, even though that wasn't in the game, like I think modders found that

01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:26.600
and that infuriated, um, that camp, uh, Elliot pages, you know, and, uh, his representation

01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:27.480
and so forth.

01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:32.280
Um, and so I, and I believe this is that kind of issue that Marissa is bringing up in chat

01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:37.480
as well is that, yeah, you got to be very careful when you have these likenesses in

01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:40.520
the game, what you can and can't render.

01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:46.520
Um, unfortunately, um, you know, the modding community, you can't stop them.

01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:50.360
That's and that's the, that's modders going to mod.

01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:50.920
Yeah.

01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:55.720
So I think it also goes to like, but, but how much ammunition did you give them?

01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:56.360
Right.

01:53:56.360 --> 01:54:03.640
In the case of beyond two souls and Elliot, um, it was, you know, the breasts were rendered

01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:04.680
in the game, I guess.

01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:08.200
And this whole thing, even though they weren't shown, they were rendered, but it gave the

01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:12.680
modders ammunition because it's like, Oh, we don't have to invent breasts because they're

01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:13.720
in the game.

01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:20.760
Um, but in the case of, uh, um, Keanu Reeves, I'm sure his dong was not rendered for the

01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:21.400
game.

01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:23.480
So they, but it's probably not even shown, right.

01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:26.120
They probably just do like more of a suggestive sexual scene.

01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:26.920
I don't know.

01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:27.880
I've played the mod.

01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:30.040
I'm not going to, but, um, yeah.

01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:32.440
Uh, interesting.

01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:36.840
Bobby Blackwell reminds us, uh, the Sims is an AO game because of mods.

01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:38.360
So says former lawyers.

01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:38.920
Yeah.

01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:39.160
Yeah.

01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:40.760
So interesting.

01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:41.080
Interesting.

01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:42.360
All right.

01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:43.560
Anyhow, let's move on.

01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:49.640
Uh, I got one more story for you guys, and this is about, um, uh, Sonic changing voice

01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:50.200
actors.

01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:52.040
And this is, this is kind of a big deal.

01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:56.520
Like, uh, when David Hader left the role of solid snake, it's kind of a big thing.

01:54:56.520 --> 01:55:01.080
So Roger Craig Smith is the name of the guy who's been voicing Sonic the Hedgehog for

01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:03.800
quite some time and on like 10 years.

01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:04.600
Right.

01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:08.200
So on Twitter, he mentioned, uh, no more.

01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:13.800
Uh, he does say that, um, uh, I guess a Sega rep has commented to some gaming blogs that

01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:15.960
of course they're thankful to Roger.

01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:21.240
Um, but, uh, and nothing was said, of course, openly about why is the change going on?

01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:28.040
Uh, but fans on Twitter are speculating that Ben Schwartz from the movie is going to be

01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:29.000
taking over the role.

01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:33.640
Moving forward, which makes sense because I know they're about to shoot that sequel

01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:38.680
because I saw one of the actresses on some talk show circuit thing and that's supposed

01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:39.160
to be in it.

01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:41.160
And she was commenting on that March.

01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:41.720
Yeah.

01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:45.400
So it's not surprising that Ben Schwartz is coming back.

01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:49.240
Um, but that is, you know, it does create kind of that disparity between movie role

01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:53.640
and everything else role where, but I mean, at the same time, what Mark Hamill was playing

01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:56.680
the joker in the cartoons for years and years and years and years and years.

01:55:56.680 --> 01:55:59.560
That didn't stop Heath Ledger from the movies and all this other stuff, even though Mark

01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:01.640
Hamill is a perfectly fine actor.

01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:05.000
Um, but anyway, it's such as the industry.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:10.520
Um, so Sega says, you know, Roger's portrayal of Sonic is one that fans are sure to remember.

01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:13.800
He brought the character to life that it, uh, and then the unsaid thing is, you know,

01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:15.720
but he's still fired and let go.

01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:17.160
He was very happy though.

01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:20.920
Roger Craig Smith was very thankful for all the outpouring of love that he got on social

01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:23.880
media and lots of people saying nice things, um, about him.

01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:25.080
So there was that as well.

01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:30.520
So, um, also I need to make sure I say this at some point.

01:56:30.520 --> 01:56:36.520
Um, also in a voice actor and actress news, uh, this is really, um, sad, but I have to

01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:41.560
mention this somewhere in the show and tip our hats to, uh, Jeanette mouse, who was an

01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:46.360
actor actually for resident evil village, uh, who passed away at 39.

01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:51.480
Um, Jeanette played and I I'm sorry, I don't know the game, the village very well, but

01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:56.040
she played one of, uh, I guess, witches in the resident evil village.

01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:56.600
I think it's the new one.

01:56:58.120 --> 01:56:59.560
Um, the giant woman.

01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:03.480
Is it really supposed to be the new resident evil demo just came out.

01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:07.080
Oh, why did I think this was the last one?

01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:08.200
Wow.

01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:09.160
That's the new one.

01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:10.040
Oh my gosh.

01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:12.680
And that same week that everybody's going crazy.

01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:13.880
Yeah, she was 39.

01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:18.760
Um, she was in some films called your sister, sister, and my effortless brilliance, um,

01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:21.320
which was a movie that she actually co-wrote as well.

01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:27.240
And, uh, no, uh, information has been said as to why she passed, but, uh, the Hollywood

01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:32.360
reporter is saying she, she was fighting colon cancer, um, for the past eight months, but

01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:38.040
they haven't said that that was because she may have may have contracted COVID and when

01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:42.440
the cancer is going, you know, we don't know, but, um, still sad all the same.

01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:44.840
I didn't realize it was that same character.

01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:46.200
My gosh.

01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:46.680
Right.

01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:52.520
And you know, and that's, that's right when, you know, she's getting, you know, say what

01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:56.040
you will about all those memes and all that stuff that's out there about that character,

01:57:56.040 --> 01:58:00.360
but that's, that's just great press for that actress.

01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:05.400
And so that really, really is horrible that she was taken from us really at her prime

01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:06.120
with that.

01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:07.560
So it's very sad.

01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:09.960
So, um, tipping our hat for that.

01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:11.160
All right.

01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:15.480
Let's move on and get into our listener round table.

01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:19.240
So we're going to talk a little bit with our emails and any questions that you guys have

01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:22.840
in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:25.720
If you have any questions for us, we're happy to take those on.

01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:30.280
So, uh, meanwhile, let's open up the mailbag participate at orange launch radio.com is

01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:34.360
the place where you can send your emails every week and a dark soccer is going to open up

01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:35.320
ye old mailbag.

01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:37.160
Damn.

01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:38.520
Um, so, okay.

01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:41.560
Oh, it's, I'm not going to open spammer again.

01:58:41.560 --> 01:58:41.800
Okay.

01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:42.280
There we go.

01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:46.440
I think we left it up because it was funny, but the emails are still taking like forever

01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:47.480
to load for me.

01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:47.720
Yeah.

01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:52.840
So I always saw one in there and it was really short, but I'll, I'll let you see if there's

01:58:52.840 --> 01:58:53.400
two.

01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:53.640
Okay.

01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:54.680
Then another one must've just come in.

01:58:54.680 --> 01:59:00.520
But, but the problem is, is that, that, uh, the, the mailbox has been taking like a really

01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:02.360
long time to open lately on this computer.

01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:03.640
I mean, this computer is ready to go.

01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:06.520
Um, oh, I did though.

01:59:06.520 --> 01:59:06.760
Sorry.

01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:11.080
I just want to say DJ Rama S in regards to the last story, wanted to add Capcom.

01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:13.000
Oh, I thought you said Capcom did.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:16.760
Oh, well, Capcom better put an in memoriam to her in the game.

01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:17.560
Yes, they should.

01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:17.800
Sorry.

01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:21.720
When I first read that, I heard Capcom did, but he's, he's saying that he wants to see

01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:22.840
that in the game and I would agree.

01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:23.960
That would be very appropriate.

01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:24.840
I hope they do that.

01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:25.560
Sorry, Jamie.

01:59:25.560 --> 01:59:26.200
Yeah.

01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:29.560
Well, at any rate, while I'm waiting for this to load, I did find something funny going

01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:31.560
back to the whole Reddit army thing.

01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:31.800
Sure.

01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:33.960
Um, now they're looking at commodities.

01:59:34.520 --> 01:59:37.800
So silver prices are jumping to a high.

01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:40.520
That was like commodity.

01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:42.280
Oh, those things.

01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:42.680
Okay.

01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:44.200
Yeah.

01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:47.320
So now they're looking to, uh, to silver.

01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:55.160
They basically bought shares in, um, an Australian, uh, uh, mining firm and they bought big and

01:59:55.160 --> 01:59:58.040
they like, like they leapt to 15%.

01:59:58.680 --> 01:59:59.720
So it was pretty crazy.

01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:00.440
Why silver?

02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:03.720
Um, because they're shorting that as well.

02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:04.200
Yeah.

02:00:04.200 --> 02:00:06.440
Oh, okay.

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:14.280
So right now it's at 28.99 an ounce and this email still hasn't fucking loaded.

02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:15.960
Time to melt down all the jewelry.

02:00:18.040 --> 02:00:22.440
No, the, this, the stupid email now I just loaded.

02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:22.680
Okay.

02:00:22.680 --> 02:00:23.720
And it's kind of a big one.

02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:28.840
So dear OLR, I just wanted to note that I thought you guys did an incredible job explaining

02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:30.760
sexuality and how it relates to furries.

02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:33.720
In addition to the fandom, not being purely a sexual thing.

02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:38.760
Jamie is the word community using the word community was appropriate as that's exactly

02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:42.840
what a furry is a community that shares a mutual love of anthropomorphic animals across

02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:44.680
multiple media forms.

02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:47.560
Yes, there are sex and that isn't what defines it.

02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:52.600
Ask yourself what may be going on behind closed doors at your local anime con.

02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:57.960
Let people be people, whatever they, uh, whether they have sexual attractions or not.

02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:03.880
Hell, I'll admit that Star Fox has had me hot and bothered for as long as I can remember,

02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:08.680
but I also won't judge you for eyeing a poster of Faye Valentine from Cowboy Bebop.

02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:14.600
One more thought, honestly, the best way to understand furry is just to go to a furry

02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:16.920
convention when it's safe to have cons again.

02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:21.400
I identified with furries for a long time, but didn't really get it until I went to my

02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:24.200
first Anthrocon in 2013.

02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:27.720
Friends were made at those cons that I'll have for life.

02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:32.360
And the level of love and acceptance I get from that community is wholly different.

02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:36.200
It's comfort I can't have with my friends who don't understand why I find fursuiting

02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:36.840
so magical.

02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:41.880
I compare it to other conventions where you go because you are a fan of an anime or comic

02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:42.920
book series.

02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:45.960
In furry, we're fans of each other and the characters we create.

02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:47.400
That's what makes it special.

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:51.000
I implore you to check out a convention even if your interest is only fleeting.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.600
It just might ignite a spark.

02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:54.440
Thanks for reading Garth Wolf.

02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:56.200
P.S. Rob, bring back guys on the show.

02:01:56.600 --> 02:02:00.040
I had a feeling this email when it was the first paragraph might have been from this

02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:05.640
individual, but I'm happy you were happy with the way we represented that on the show.

02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:08.520
And I don't think there's a lot else to comment on that email.

02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:11.880
I think you made a request there that I think is very fair.

02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:13.640
So that's that's really all there is to say on that.

02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:16.520
Well, now I'm waiting five years for this other one to open.

02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:22.360
How about anyone got any stories while I'm waiting for this damn email?

02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:25.480
Well, I was also going to go to chat and look at some comments there in our chat room.

02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:30.440
And Tiger Con says there's also people out there who don't find humans attractive, but

02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:33.240
find anthropomorphic characters attractive.

02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:35.400
I don't think it's a link.

02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:38.680
I think maybe kink or anything, but some people do feel that way.

02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:45.480
So as long as you have consent, as long as you're not hurting anyone or pushing it on

02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:46.120
anyone else.

02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:52.280
As long as everybody is the age of consent, I think this is another important thing to

02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:52.840
put out there.

02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:53.960
Anything I might be missing?

02:02:56.040 --> 02:02:58.920
So have a safe word.

02:02:58.920 --> 02:02:59.420
All right.

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:05.000
I was going to say, though, about the whole like because in the email it went into, you

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.080
know, let me have the furry thing.

02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:09.080
You have your Cowboy Bebop poster.

02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:13.640
Or I would argue, since we just brought up that character from Resident Evil, I saw all

02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:15.320
sorts of things on Twitter about that.

02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:18.680
So everybody's got their thing.

02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:20.440
We'll leave it at that.

02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:22.360
Go ahead, Jamie.

02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:24.600
It's loaded, by the way.

02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:26.360
It still hasn't loaded?

02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:28.680
No, I can get to it.

02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:31.160
I finally started watching Drag Race, though.

02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:32.440
Oh, did you?

02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:38.600
Yeah, I have one person I loathe and one person I love already.

02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:41.400
I can guess both of those.

02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:43.240
Okay, who do you think I hate?

02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:44.520
Candy.

02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:45.400
That's who everybody hates.

02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:45.900
Yeah.

02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:47.640
Who do you think I love?

02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:49.400
Tamisha Iman, because that's the correct answer.

02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:52.140
Gottmik.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:53.800
Gottmik's pretty cool.

02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:57.240
Yeah, I think the winner is very, very obvious, though.

02:03:57.240 --> 02:03:59.000
And it's none of those people we just named.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.840
But anyway, we'll see.

02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:01.080
All right.

02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:03.480
Anyhow, let's move on this email.

02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:05.640
I got the email up because I get them on my phone as well.

02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:11.960
This person did not sign the email and I don't feel comfortable reading the tube line because

02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:14.440
I don't know what this person prefers to be called.

02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:16.520
So I will call this anonymous email.

02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:19.960
And also, just a reminder, if you want us to read your name on air, which we're happy

02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:23.720
to do, don't forget to sign the email with whatever you want to be called and help me

02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:26.760
out with a pronunciation if it's tough.

02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:29.560
But this is unsigned and it's very simple.

02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:30.280
It's one sentence.

02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:34.360
I would think it would be sent from the phone if it didn't.

02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:36.440
But it doesn't say sent with my iPhone at the bottom.

02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:41.080
The question is, what is the best song in video games?

02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:45.960
From our anonymous listener, what is the best song in video games?

02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:47.320
You know what?

02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:53.000
It's a very basic, simple question, but one that we haven't touched on in a long time.

02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:56.680
Well, I don't think the emailer expects us to give the definitive answer.

02:04:56.680 --> 02:04:59.080
But what is our best, our favorite song in video games?

02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:01.320
What is the best song to us in video games?

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.920
I have some answers, but I'll let you guys go first.

02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:16.840
I'm trying to remember if it was used in the game.

02:05:16.840 --> 02:05:18.520
I think it was used in the game.

02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:27.400
I want to say that, well, Info High was in the Macross Plus movie.

02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:34.200
But I do believe that it was in, yeah, it was in one of the games,

02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:36.520
Uta Macross, Somafo De Culture.

02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:40.360
But I can use that song because it was in a game.

02:05:41.160 --> 02:05:41.800
I'm kidding.

02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:49.160
Um, honestly, I don't know that there's a best game, a best song,

02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:54.600
because there's so many different genres that I can't really choose one.

02:05:55.720 --> 02:05:57.240
Okay, this is easy for me. I'll do it.

02:05:59.320 --> 02:06:05.400
So for me, the Final Fantasy XIV soundtrack has been a huge reason why I stay with that game.

02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:07.160
That's a really good soundtrack.

02:06:07.160 --> 02:06:12.920
Soken has done amazing things with the legacy that Nobuo Imatsu started

02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:14.920
and really taken it in a modern direction.

02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:17.000
And honestly, if you're going to start anywhere,

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.400
start with the prologue from Realm Reborn.

02:06:19.400 --> 02:06:21.880
Start with the basic, like the crystal theme.

02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:27.800
Listen to that because that is the character creation music in Final Fantasy XIV.

02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:32.200
And it is so, like, it is the perfect version of that song.

02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:34.600
Literally the perfect version of that song.

02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:35.960
And it's in Final Fantasy XIV.

02:06:35.960 --> 02:06:37.800
And that, you know, there's other stuff.

02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:39.960
Like there's some primal fights that have amazing music

02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:42.520
and there's just so many different varieties and genres.

02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:48.440
I think Soken is the best video game composer we have out there right now.

02:06:48.440 --> 02:06:50.600
And it's a damn shame he's only doing one game.

02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:59.480
Fingers, toes and everything else I have crossed that perhaps he is doing Final Fantasy XVI.

02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:03.320
But that's a lot of work for one person because XIV is enough.

02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:05.480
Like there's hundreds of tracks in XIV.

02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:07.720
But I think he's a brilliant, brilliant person.

02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:11.960
I'm actually going to go with a song from a game that I don't really care for,

02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:14.200
but it introduced me to one of my favorite singers.

02:07:15.240 --> 02:07:17.320
So Kiss Me Goodbye by Angela Aki.

02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:21.720
She's got such a fantastic voice.

02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:25.000
She's actually, I think, in the US now finishing up some music production.

02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:29.960
But she's just one of my favorite vocalists ever.

02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:34.120
And I even remembered reading an interview where she said she

02:07:34.120 --> 02:07:37.160
had a dream of playing at the Budokan.

02:07:37.800 --> 02:07:41.320
She had actually been to a Sheena Ringo concert, who's another singer I like.

02:07:42.920 --> 02:07:45.400
And she got her start with Final Fantasy games.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:50.680
And was a year later, she's playing at Budokan.

02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:54.200
Yeah, it's interesting to see how like the music from video games

02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:56.760
have really influenced some of the artists today.

02:07:56.760 --> 02:08:01.560
Like that Porter Robinson has some pretty good music CDs and stuff.

02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:04.840
And my understanding is he's influenced by Beatmania and DDR.

02:08:05.960 --> 02:08:10.920
So he is an artist that kind of represents a lot of that stuff that we all loved,

02:08:11.480 --> 02:08:13.800
when we were in our 20s, although this guy's younger.

02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:16.440
So I imagine he was more of a kid when he heard a lot of this stuff.

02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:18.040
But I just think that's really cool.

02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:20.920
And then you listen to his stuff and you can hear it.

02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:23.160
You can hear the Beatmania influence in a lot of his music.

02:08:24.680 --> 02:08:28.920
I will go back to something else, which I'm going to probably go on record saying

02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:33.240
it probably has one of my overall favorite video game soundtracks is Chrono Trigger.

02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:39.480
Because too far away times will always make me choke up a little bit,

02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:41.720
just somewhere a little bit in my heart.

02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:45.880
And the feel of the theme of Zeal, our shotless theme.

02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:49.960
That one also is one of my favorites.

02:08:49.960 --> 02:08:53.640
So I didn't quite get to finish, but I was going to say, no, it's okay.

02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:58.120
It's okay, because you kind of didn't get your answers out there.

02:08:58.360 --> 02:08:58.840
Until now.

02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:03.400
But I was going to say, so if I was to get away from the MMOs a little bit,

02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:06.200
especially because I can't really pinpoint a specific song in that game,

02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:07.960
I was going to say Scar of Time.

02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:14.200
Even though Chrono Cross is not the greatest game of my life,

02:09:15.160 --> 02:09:21.960
that intro and that song were stunning, especially that song.

02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:26.760
And that's just, I think, a definitive all-time classic game song.

02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:31.080
My third and final answer for this question would be,

02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:34.280
because I would say a song that is extremely versatile,

02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:39.880
meaning like an 8-bit song that has just been reimagined time and time again in glorious ways.

02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:41.880
And this song is amazing.

02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:43.960
Every single time I've heard it reinterpreted,

02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:46.280
I think it's a song that can't be bad,

02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:50.920
would be the overworld theme from The Legend of Zelda, throwing it back.

02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:54.760
How many times have we heard that song?

02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:56.200
Remixed?

02:09:56.200 --> 02:09:56.920
Orchestral?

02:09:58.840 --> 02:09:59.880
Is it ever bad?

02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:02.840
I mean, I guess maybe I'm challenging the internet with that question,

02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:03.880
but you know what I mean?

02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:10.120
Like that song is just so versatile and so brilliant.

02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:13.960
Like it just, it represents my childhood, really.

02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:16.120
So that would be my answer.

02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:18.840
Loki, and I see the chat is lighting up on this.

02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:19.880
I want to get to you guys too,

02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:23.720
but Loki, I got to ask you the email question as well.

02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:25.080
What's the best video game song?

02:10:29.080 --> 02:10:29.720
I don't know.

02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:33.240
I mean, there's lots of good stuff.

02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:34.280
It's hard to pick the best.

02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:38.200
I don't know.

02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:40.920
Like if I'm going to go back to like DDR stuff,

02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:42.760
I'd say anything by Naoki.

02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:45.320
So I don't know the one that kind of stands up to me

02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:48.920
that used to play a lot on my cabinet is D2R.

02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:52.120
That's kind of encompassing,

02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:56.760
like kind of the Naoki song style with like a Brilliant 2U,

02:10:56.760 --> 02:10:58.520
B4U or anything like that.

02:10:58.520 --> 02:10:59.240
But, you know.

02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:02.120
Did you hear that Step Maniacs has new Naoki songs?

02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:03.080
Like they got him over there.

02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:04.840
I know Step Maniacs is awesome.

02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:05.720
I know, good for them.

02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:06.840
Good for them.

02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:07.640
They have a lot.

02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:08.440
I mean, they're pretty much,

02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:11.320
they have the whole song library now of the whole Bomani series,

02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:14.600
because it's like, it's all being brought back in there.

02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:17.080
But yeah, like I know he's got new stuff in there.

02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:18.600
So it's pretty cool.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.680
All right, let me get some of the chat answers.

02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:23.000
You guys are blowing up chat in the best way

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:24.520
and you guys have some great answers here.

02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:25.800
Let's see.

02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:27.240
DragonSamurai said,

02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:29.480
best song in video games?

02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:32.840
Opera song in Final Fantasy 3 or 6 for the Super Nintendo?

02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:33.240
Yes.

02:11:33.240 --> 02:11:35.400
I mean, that is, you want to talk Final Fantasy?

02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:39.720
Like that moment changed games, truly.

02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:42.520
And the song was a huge part of that.

02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:44.280
Some other answers here.

02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:48.040
Azette says, a thousand words from Final Fantasy X-2,

02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:48.920
the best performed.

02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:51.640
Our pal Bobby Blackall says,

02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:53.880
Persona 5, wake up, get up, get out there.

02:11:55.560 --> 02:11:56.040
Let's see.

02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:57.400
Black Compat says,

02:11:57.400 --> 02:12:00.520
I absolutely love the Last of Us Part 1 soundtrack.

02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:01.800
I have that one on vinyl.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.200
ZenMonkey11 says,

02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:06.600
the instrumental at the start of Streets of Rage.

02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:09.240
I heard that at night on a cool windy day and it gave me life.

02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:11.160
I also love the Killer Instinct song.

02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:13.960
Oh my God, Killer Instinct's got such a good soundtrack.

02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:14.600
Hell yeah.

02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:16.860
Let's see.

02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:19.880
Some other comments here.

02:12:20.920 --> 02:12:22.840
Story about Killer Instinct 2.

02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:23.320
What's that?

02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:25.960
When Dan and I were still just friends online,

02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:27.640
I was telling him how much I liked.

02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:32.440
I think it was Orchid's theme in Killer Instinct 2.

02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:38.040
And so he kept restarting his game over and over

02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:41.240
so he could get me a WAV file recorded of it.

02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:42.060
Hmm.

02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:45.240
And I still have that file somewhere.

02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:45.740
Nice.

02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:51.240
ActDef kind of tried to rephrase the question a little bit.

02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:54.280
And I don't know if this would give you guys different answers,

02:12:54.280 --> 02:12:56.200
but let me read ActDef's version of the question.

02:12:56.840 --> 02:13:00.600
What was the game that made you notice video game music

02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:03.000
as something more than just background noise?

02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:05.320
That's a neat question.

02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:05.880
I like that.

02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:07.080
A little different spin on it.

02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:10.840
What's the game that made you notice video game music?

02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:13.800
I would have to throw way fucking back

02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:18.680
because remember, before I grew up on Nintendo Entertainment System,

02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:21.560
there was a period of time between the ages of about five and nine

02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:23.640
where I grew up on the Commodore 64.

02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:27.400
And therefore, one of the first background songs I noticed

02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:31.080
that really made me notice the music was Pitfall 2, The Lost Caverns.

02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:36.200
And that was one of the first times a video game had a static song playing behind it.

02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:39.320
Because think about most of those Atari 2600 games back in the day.

02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:40.360
They were very like,

02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:45.400
boop, blip, brrr, like some of those unique noises the 2600 made.

02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:49.960
And it wasn't until you had Pitfall 2, specifically The Lost Caverns,

02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:51.400
where you had that theme song.

02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:55.880
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:58.520
And then when you would get hit by something,

02:13:58.520 --> 02:14:01.720
then the game would suddenly go into a minor key.

02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:04.920
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:06.360
Like it got all sad.

02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:08.120
And it's hard not to notice that.

02:14:08.120 --> 02:14:11.880
And I would say that was the first for me.

02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:12.680
How about you guys?

02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:15.880
The game that made you notice video game music.

02:14:16.600 --> 02:14:19.080
Bobby says we're going to get DMCA'd.

02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:20.200
No, we're not.

02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:21.240
I used to always.

02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:23.640
No, it wasn't that it was necessarily music,

02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:25.160
but the intro to Space Fury,

02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:32.280
where it almost seemed to me like the alien guy who was taunting you was singing to you.

02:14:33.320 --> 02:14:35.800
So that was one that did it for me early on.

02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:43.800
There was even like a mousetrap.

02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:45.800
I couldn't play it without the background music

02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:49.000
because it was just sort of like set a rhythm to how I would play it.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:52.200
And the music wasn't either that dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:53.080
you know, over like that.

02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:57.480
Because I'm just trying to think what else.

02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:03.640
I guess if I was going to get into the Nintendo era of stuff,

02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:12.280
it would probably have been playing through the Guardian Legend.

02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:16.120
Yeah, because I had a killer soundtrack in it.

02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:17.240
So underappreciated.

02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:19.880
But actually, I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to go back.

02:15:20.440 --> 02:15:21.880
I'm going to say it was R-Type.

02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:23.400
Arcade R-Type.

02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:26.840
Because I love the first level music for R-Type.

02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:32.040
And that really made me just think this is what video game music is.

02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:37.080
Yeah, I was going to say because Bobby in chat said there were some great

02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:39.320
Commodore 64 tracks that slapped.

02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:42.840
Yeah, another one that honestly you wouldn't even think this,

02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:45.960
but Dragon's Lair and Dragon's Lair 2,

02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:50.120
which were both influenced by the original Dragon's Lair arcade game,

02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:52.040
but they they're not a direct port of it,

02:15:52.040 --> 02:15:55.320
because obviously the Commodore 64 cannot handle those types of graphics.

02:15:55.320 --> 02:15:58.680
But the music in those games, especially the second one,

02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:01.480
which I think was Escape from Singe's Castle or something like that,

02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:02.920
is so good.

02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:07.000
Like I remember being like seven and hearing that for the first time,

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:08.360
like just like going, whoa.

02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:12.040
And this was the whole time when I was getting into music, like taking organ.

02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:13.320
I didn't take piano lessons.

02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:16.040
I took organ lessons because we had one of those like

02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:19.640
70s Wurlitzer synthesizer like church organs in our house.

02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:24.600
And it was awesome because that was the that was the thing people bought in the 70s

02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:28.760
that would do like the the automatic bossa nova backing track by hitting the switch.

02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:31.240
And then you do do do anyway.

02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:31.880
So that was fun.

02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:34.680
So Loki, anything for you?

02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:37.160
The first game where you really noticed video game music?

02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:39.720
Probably like the Legend of Zelda.

02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:41.080
Yeah. Yeah.

02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:42.780
For sure.

02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:44.220
All right.

02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:47.320
Marissa in chat kind of wondering aloud,

02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:51.000
I'd love to know what the early composers in gaming were thinking,

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:54.760
because so many soundtracks are masterpieces and they had to keep in mind

02:16:54.760 --> 02:16:57.400
how long people would be listening to these songs.

02:16:58.040 --> 02:16:58.540
Yeah.

02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:01.320
Surely someone's made a documentary on this,

02:17:01.320 --> 02:17:05.320
but I would love to hear interviews with some of these like great song makers of old,

02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:08.680
like, you know, Koji Kondo and, you know, the people that really brought us,

02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:12.840
you know, a lot of the eight bit bit music that we're all naming here.

02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:18.280
I think Bobby and Dragon Samael basically nailed it.

02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:22.440
They were thinking we only have 10K of space for audio production.

02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:29.560
And honestly, a lot of the early sound designers were really like,

02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:32.520
let's make it sound good and make it work with the game and make it fit.

02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:33.160
True.

02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:33.660
True.

02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:37.880
Now today is a different story, but.

02:17:38.680 --> 02:17:39.180
Yeah.

02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:45.240
And I think that some of like, I remember when I got to meet Koji Kondo in 2006

02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:51.400
and I thanked him for, you know, prolonging my interest in music because he

02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:58.840
did the music for a lot of games that, that were really, I would say inspiring for me

02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:00.440
and the music has really stuck with me.

02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:03.880
And I got to thank him at E3 that one year when they were doing what We Music.

02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:05.260
Yeah.

02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:11.880
Like the preview for We Music and he looked so surprised and delighted by it.

02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:16.360
So I was like, I guess they never did think that it was going to happen.

02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:20.200
And now, you know, just such talent in, in what he does.

02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:24.600
And I'm even going to say that who, whoever's doing the music for Animal Crossing this time

02:18:24.600 --> 02:18:33.480
around is really doing just, it's very interesting with Animal Crossing is that the music in this

02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:39.800
particular one seems all like it's variations on the same theme, whether or not it's in the same

02:18:40.520 --> 02:18:45.880
key or it has a switch, but it has like even my favorite music in the game, the five o'clock funk

02:18:45.880 --> 02:18:51.880
is what I call it, has that intro, you know, thing as a lick in that tune.

02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:59.320
And I, I really, I'm really looking forward to, not looking forward, but I really like

02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:03.000
when there's that sort of a musical continuity in a game.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:03.500
Yeah.

02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:07.880
You know, I think Marissa kind of hearing all these answers and what the chat's saying about

02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:13.480
the limitations is kind of having a wow moment and says in chat, Marissa again says limitations

02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:16.520
can really help creativity explode sometimes.

02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:17.560
Yeah, absolutely.

02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:18.200
Absolutely.

02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:23.720
And Dragon Samael kind of adds to that saying it's astounding though, when you're so limited

02:19:23.720 --> 02:19:26.680
in what you can make, you had to get that hook right away.

02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:27.800
That's another good point.

02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:29.640
You had to go right into the hook.

02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:31.960
So very, very interesting.

02:19:31.960 --> 02:19:34.840
Have you seen what some cosplayers do on an incredible budget

02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:38.840
and they do these amazing outfits that are all pretty much thrifted?

02:19:38.920 --> 02:19:46.360
I mean, that, that right there, you know, people who I was actually watching, um, I,

02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:51.720
I sometimes like to watch this tiny, tiny home videos and this one person took all of

02:19:51.720 --> 02:19:59.160
the scrap from his, uh, barn and built his wife an office out of scrap.

02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:01.400
But have you seen what La La Ri did on a budget?

02:20:02.200 --> 02:20:03.000
I don't know who that is.

02:20:04.600 --> 02:20:05.400
No, we love her.

02:20:05.400 --> 02:20:06.040
We stan her.

02:20:06.040 --> 02:20:06.600
She's great.

02:20:06.600 --> 02:20:08.440
She's a, I don't know who that is.

02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:09.240
Drag race.

02:20:09.240 --> 02:20:10.760
I thought you watched drag race.

02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:11.400
I just started.

02:20:11.400 --> 02:20:12.600
I don't know all their names yet.

02:20:12.600 --> 02:20:13.100
Okay.

02:20:14.440 --> 02:20:15.480
You'll, you'll, you'll get there.

02:20:15.480 --> 02:20:18.920
I don't know when I, I know they kicked off Elliot and then Elliot came back.

02:20:18.920 --> 02:20:19.400
Yes.

02:20:19.400 --> 02:20:19.640
All right.

02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:20.040
You'll get there.

02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:20.600
You'll get there.

02:20:20.600 --> 02:20:21.160
All right.

02:20:21.160 --> 02:20:23.160
Uh, moving on.

02:20:23.160 --> 02:20:27.320
Um, and, uh, just because Sia Tabiri in chat says, ouch.

02:20:27.320 --> 02:20:29.080
I said, I said, we stan her.

02:20:29.080 --> 02:20:31.240
I'm just given a little bit of a hard time.

02:20:31.240 --> 02:20:33.880
I can't, you know, do certain things either.

02:20:33.880 --> 02:20:34.520
All right.

02:20:34.520 --> 02:20:35.320
Anyway, moving on.

02:20:35.320 --> 02:20:37.720
I don't want to spoil because I guess Jamie isn't all caught up yet.

02:20:37.720 --> 02:20:38.220
All right.

02:20:38.280 --> 02:20:43.080
Um, let's move on and talk about, uh, some last minute stories.

02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:45.240
If you guys have anything else to, uh, add.

02:20:47.640 --> 02:20:47.960
Yeah.

02:20:47.960 --> 02:20:53.080
I was going to mention that, uh, the battle born servers have finally been deactivated.

02:20:53.080 --> 02:20:53.580
Oh yeah.

02:20:54.920 --> 02:20:56.120
Not playable at all.

02:20:56.120 --> 02:21:00.520
Apparently even that, uh, extended to the single player portion of the game.

02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:05.960
So you got yourself a wonderful little coffee or a coaster now.

02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:08.520
Womp womp.

02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:10.120
Yeah.

02:21:10.120 --> 02:21:16.680
Thing random where apparently, uh, Pokemon red is still being played inside of someone's

02:21:16.680 --> 02:21:18.120
Twitter at avatar.

02:21:18.120 --> 02:21:18.520
Oh yeah.

02:21:18.520 --> 02:21:20.600
We, we had the original story about that.

02:21:20.600 --> 02:21:22.280
A couple is still going right.

02:21:22.280 --> 02:21:22.840
Still going.

02:21:22.840 --> 02:21:23.340
Yeah.

02:21:24.920 --> 02:21:25.420
Interesting.

02:21:27.640 --> 02:21:28.840
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

02:21:28.840 --> 02:21:29.340
Yeah.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:32.120
I didn't know that was still going on.

02:21:34.920 --> 02:21:36.920
Anything else from Loki or dark saga?

02:21:36.920 --> 02:21:37.880
That's all I had.

02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:43.000
Um, uh, no, I didn't see anything.

02:21:45.720 --> 02:21:46.600
All right.

02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:51.640
Well then, uh, I guess we will wrap it up pixel boxes as porn went out, uh, with, uh,

02:21:51.640 --> 02:21:53.320
pushing F for battle born in chat.

02:21:54.040 --> 02:21:54.920
All right.

02:21:54.920 --> 02:21:55.960
Uh, that's it.

02:21:55.960 --> 02:22:00.840
We're going to wrap things up here and thank you guys so much for, uh, listening to our

02:22:00.840 --> 02:22:01.320
show tonight.

02:22:01.320 --> 02:22:02.280
We really appreciate it.

02:22:02.280 --> 02:22:04.040
Thank you everybody for taking part.

02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:04.760
Uh, thank you.

02:22:04.760 --> 02:22:05.480
Thank you.

02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:08.920
Um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio tonight, tell a friend

02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:09.800
or two about the show.

02:22:09.800 --> 02:22:13.240
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if

02:22:13.240 --> 02:22:15.880
the voices aren't here, we can't put them out.

02:22:15.880 --> 02:22:19.400
So, uh, tell your friends as long as they aren't shit bags, tell your friends.

02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:24.680
And you know, you know, if you have a friend who's a shit bag, but invite your cool friends,

02:22:24.680 --> 02:22:29.080
uh, to the show and, uh, hang out with us and, uh, yeah, well, it's a good way to spend

02:22:29.080 --> 02:22:32.760
a Sunday night, uh, a nice five star review wherever you found the show, whether it's,

02:22:32.760 --> 02:22:38.520
uh, iTunes or Spotify or wherever, uh, it goes a long way, a host on a site like Twitch

02:22:38.520 --> 02:22:40.040
that goes a long way as well.

02:22:40.040 --> 02:22:45.000
Uh, also, uh, uh, sharing on social media, uh, super appreciate that stuff.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:48.440
Um, also I have to give a quick plug to the shop.

02:22:48.440 --> 02:22:52.120
Uh, if you really enjoyed the show tonight and you want to, uh, buy some merchandise

02:22:52.120 --> 02:22:55.880
that says VOG network or OLR on it, please take a moment to swing by the store.

02:22:55.880 --> 02:22:58.680
vognetwork.com slash shop.

02:22:58.680 --> 02:23:02.600
If you want to check out some stuff and yes, we will add some more merchandise to that

02:23:02.600 --> 02:23:04.040
hopefully in the next month or so.

02:23:04.040 --> 02:23:05.880
Um, just a few, a few more things for you guys to check out.

02:23:05.880 --> 02:23:08.040
Someone wants her, her lady shirts.

02:23:08.040 --> 02:23:08.440
Yeah.

02:23:08.440 --> 02:23:10.360
So I said, give me some designs.

02:23:10.360 --> 02:23:11.160
We'll get some shirts.

02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:11.480
All right.

02:23:11.480 --> 02:23:14.040
No, there's designs up there and there's no lady shirt for it.

02:23:14.040 --> 02:23:15.240
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:23:15.240 --> 02:23:17.560
I said I would add one of the designs to it, to a lady shirt.

02:23:17.560 --> 02:23:21.800
So sure, of course, but it's, it's also my way to try to trick and get some more designs.

02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:23.720
All right.

02:23:23.720 --> 02:23:25.880
Oh, I'll work on something.

02:23:25.880 --> 02:23:26.280
All right.

02:23:26.280 --> 02:23:26.760
Sounds good.

02:23:27.320 --> 02:23:27.720
All right.

02:23:27.720 --> 02:23:30.360
Um, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:32.280
Um, Loki, we'll start with you.

02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:32.920
Your final thought.

02:23:33.960 --> 02:23:36.680
My final thought is diamond hands to the moon.

02:23:39.800 --> 02:23:45.480
Uh, my final thought is, um, let's hope crypto coin takes off, except I only put in like

02:23:45.480 --> 02:23:46.040
50 bucks.

02:23:46.040 --> 02:23:47.320
I'm not expecting it to go anywhere.

02:23:47.320 --> 02:23:51.400
Well, if you think about it, like with Doge, I mean, it's at 3 cents right now.

02:23:51.400 --> 02:23:55.240
So even if it goes down to one cent, that's like, just that's two thirds of the money

02:23:55.240 --> 02:23:55.720
they put in.

02:23:55.720 --> 02:23:58.440
But that's not the crypto I invested in.

02:23:58.440 --> 02:24:02.520
I knew that one would be too, you know, all over the map.

02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:07.560
So, um, I, I did a different one that I just kind of did my own research and I was like,

02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:09.720
all right, maybe this one will go up.

02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:11.480
Kind of just playing with it a little bit.

02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:12.360
All right.

02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:12.760
We'll see.

02:24:13.800 --> 02:24:15.640
Um, dark soccer, your final thought.

02:24:16.840 --> 02:24:19.640
Um, I don't know.

02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:21.720
I don't have thoughts anymore.

02:24:21.720 --> 02:24:27.640
I have a series of random, uh, time has dissolved to the point where I no longer have coherent

02:24:27.640 --> 02:24:28.120
thoughts.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:33.000
I just say whatever the fuck happens to come out without even processing it, you know?

02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:42.440
Um, yeah, I'm not ready for my staycation to be, be home, but I did have a little health

02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:45.880
scare that I am glad everything came through just fine.

02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:50.040
So, um, some people have been following me on Twitter and thank you for all the support

02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:50.680
that you gave me.

02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:55.240
Um, I had a little cancer scare, um, everything came back benign.

02:24:55.240 --> 02:24:56.120
So, hey.

02:24:56.120 --> 02:24:57.080
All right.

02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:01.240
Um, all right, that's going to do it.

02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:04.120
Thank you so much for listening to another episode of Orange Launch Radio and joining

02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:04.600
us tonight.

02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:06.280
We will be back here in seven days.

02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:09.320
Yes, I understand there's stuff going on on TV, but too bad.

02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:11.000
We're still doing our show as we always do.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.080
So we will see you next week.

02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:14.840
But until then, have a great week.

02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:15.640
Happy gaming.

02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:16.120
Good night.

02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:47.000
Or vog network, but you know, they were all still true.

02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:54.120
See you next week.

02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:24.120
Bye.
