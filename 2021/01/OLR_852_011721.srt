1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,480
My Gaming Spheres never included Katy Perry, yet I recently learned that she recorded

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,940
at least one of her songs in Simlish, the Sims language from The Sims, and this week

3
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,500
Ms. Perry is signed on to be part of Pokemon's 25th anniversary.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,200
When I think of musicians significantly in gaming, I think about EDM mainstays, Marshmallow,

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,380
Cascade, and all the other hypesters, but Ms. Perry is absolutely more appropriate and

6
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,880
approachable for the Pokeverse.

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,040
This is just my bubble of news and memory, it's now time for your hosts Rob Roberts,

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,120
Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news,

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,640
starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,120
Hello my friends, out there on the internet, welcome back, it's another week of the show

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:52,080
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio Live, once again, January the 17th of

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:58,000
2021, with episode number 852 of our show.

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:04,840
I am Rob Roberts joining you here in our studio where we always gathered every week to talk

14
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:10,040
live about the latest and greatest in video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.

15
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,880
Obviously for obvious reasons, I don't need to detail right now, for the last nine months

16
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,200
we've been doing our show in a virtual format, so joining me via the magic of Discord, say

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,760
hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

18
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,760
Hello.

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,760
Hi, how are you?

20
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,720
I'm a little frustrated, but okay.

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,960
Well, for what it's worth, you sound great right now, so don't change a thing.

22
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,160
Well, honestly, I need a wrench to tighten up this one little bolt on here.

23
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,760
I've been figuring what's going on with my mic is that there's some loose bits on my

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:47,400
arm, and so if I put it in just the right way, it starts drooping down because gravity

25
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
always wins.

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,680
Y'all were missing Dark Sakura before the show playing with power tools, or actually

27
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,280
I did a, for those that-

28
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,280
What do you mean?

29
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
It's a screwdriver.

30
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,360
Well, you got to put some power in that tool, but that's right.

31
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
How about the gun show?

32
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,680
There we go.

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,760
But so part of the joy of doing this show live, and I put joy in quotes, because we

34
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:14,160
do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern ish, right after

35
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,120
the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG network.

36
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,000
And the joy of being here for the live stuff is that sometimes we screw up and you get

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,040
to see it live.

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,600
So tonight I had a false start where I actually, so you know, I'm sure many of you have used

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,200
Open Broadcaster Studio, just like we do, and you know the magic of scenes, and sometimes

40
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,300
you might click on the wrong scene or push the wrong button.

41
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,880
And that's what happened tonight is that it played the little pre-show, did the little

42
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,120
bumper, it says VOG network, then it went right to us and Jamie's sitting there trying

43
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,560
to get the microphone going, and I'm like, oops, I hit the wrong button.

44
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Take two.

45
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,160
I mean, I certainly don't mind showing the stuff that happens behind the scenes to the,

46
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,560
you know, 25 people watching right now.

47
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,480
It's it's whatever.

48
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
Screw ups happen.

49
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,480
It's whatever.

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,840
Anyway, say hello to somebody.

51
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,280
No, say hello to somebody who never screws up.

52
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,880
It's Techmaster Loki.

53
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,280
I do all the time.

54
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,360
I don't know what you're talking about.

55
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
OK, that's true.

56
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
No, I'm kidding.

57
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,360
How are you?

58
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,720
Ah, my head hurts.

59
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,720
Other than that, I'm good.

60
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:28,460
So the chatters have correctly called out, I believe, that you've got Scott Pilgrim.

61
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,640
Is that the new one or the old one playing behind you?

62
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,960
I mean, I know it's the same thing, but the remaster is the same.

63
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,680
Well, one's remastered, so it looks a little.

64
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,120
I was watching.

65
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,640
So our pal Ranma from Anime Jam Session was playing on Saturday night, Friday night.

66
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,640
I don't remember.

67
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,640
It was some point.

68
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,480
And I was watching for a few minutes and I did kind of go, oh, this looks a lot cleaner.

69
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,480
Like it's a lot crisper.

70
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,040
He really just comes through.

71
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
I think.

72
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,040
Yeah, it's the old one.

73
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,040
OK.

74
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,280
But still, it's close enough, right?

75
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,280
Close enough.

76
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,280
Yeah, it's fine.

77
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,560
I was too late to get the new one.

78
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,300
Have you seen that meme going around?

79
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,580
And Dark Soccer, you can appreciate this one, too, about how nobody watched Scott Pilgrim

80
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,880
for Scott.

81
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,140
And it's always like all these supporting characters.

82
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,080
And if you think about it, like that movie, which I think is only aged better as like

83
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,160
that's one of those movies you look back and is going to really define.

84
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,400
I think that period of time, just like like people look fondly back on 80s movies like

85
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,800
Ferris Bueller's Day Off and some of that, like I think Scott Pilgrim's one of those movies

86
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,360
that kind of represents the arts or whatever you want to call it, like really well.

87
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,040
But I had such some people like Empire Records is one I think that's more 90s.

88
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,280
But yes, I would.

89
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,400
That is definitely one of those movies, for sure.

90
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,560
But like well, and Tiger Claw and Chat says, actually, you know, you're right.

91
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,340
I was thinking of I don't know, I'm stuck in the 90s right now.

92
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:53,820
Me every day, Tiger Claw and Chat says probably just for Brie Larson, in part, but it's not

93
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,820
just her.

94
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,820
What?

95
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,820
Aubrey Plaza.

96
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,060
Aubrey Plaza's in it.

97
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,780
Anna Kendrick's in it.

98
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,420
The Superman guy in it, whose name I can't remember in the moment.

99
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,420
Chris Evans?

100
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,980
No, he's in it too.

101
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,980
He's Captain America.

102
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,980
He's in it, too.

103
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,540
Brandon Routh.

104
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,540
That's it.

105
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,540
He's in it, too.

106
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,140
They're all in it.

107
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,540
So it's it's it's got like such a huge, strong supporting cast.

108
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,180
And yeah, I love I think that's one of those movies that just gets better the older it

109
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,180
gets.

110
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,020
And I did I did a cult movie screening of it a couple of years ago, whenever the 10th

111
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,100
anniversary was.

112
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,580
And that was a really fun show.

113
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,140
I really want to host that again.

114
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,060
And maybe they'll pair it with Kung Fury again.

115
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,060
I don't know.

116
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,300
Or we'll do Kung Fury was great.

117
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,300
We'll do it.

118
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,300
That was the double feature.

119
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,300
And it was a great double feature.

120
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,620
But or maybe we'll Kung Fury has a great soundtrack.

121
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,220
We'll pair it with the game.

122
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,660
We'll have somebody play through the game live and then watch the movie.

123
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,660
Who knows?

124
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,660
Anything?

125
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,660
Anything?

126
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:57,120
Going in to chat Bobby Blackwell says the scientist in Picard was in it really see.

127
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,300
It's all these people that ended up like that that movie jump started their careers seriously.

128
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,420
And it's so quotable and has all the all the gifts from it.

129
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:11,180
I think it was just Dark Sakura literally in a text message the other day.

130
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,500
Cred makes you fat like that was literally a thing that we were talking about the other

131
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,500
day.

132
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,500
Yeah.

133
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,500
Anyway, love it.

134
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,500
All right.

135
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,900
I love that movie.

136
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,180
Me too.

137
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,580
Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, which is about Nintendo and some of the things

138
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,540
that they are continuing to do legally.

139
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,800
Loki, you want to talk about this for us because you probably been following this a little

140
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,060
better than I have.

141
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,060
Yeah.

142
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:40,380
So there was a channel stack smashing who he does a lot of like different like kind

143
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,620
of console hacking and whatnot, just for the fun of it, I guess.

144
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,220
Oh, so he was sorry.

145
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,340
Quick shout out to our discord over at vog network dot com slash discord, because that's

146
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,040
where I first heard about this.

147
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,940
So this story actually kind of came from there this week.

148
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,580
So vog network dot com slash discord.

149
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,000
I don't shout that out enough at the top of the show.

150
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,300
So I got my quota in for the week.

151
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,300
Sorry, Loki.

152
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,300
Yeah.

153
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,860
Well, we talked about like this guy before he was the one that put out the YouTube videos

154
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:13,580
on hacking the Game & Watch to actually put different custom ROMs on there and different

155
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,580
mods.

156
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,220
So this was the same guy that was kind of showing that progress along the way.

157
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,020
And of course, because it's something that Nintendo didn't like, they went ahead and

158
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:32,540
did a copyright strike against it, claiming that he is violating their copyright by putting

159
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:38,740
this educational video about how to reverse engineer the Game & Watch, which in tech,

160
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,260
I think that completely falls into fair use.

161
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,260
But, you know, it's a Nintendo.

162
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,140
And what what are you going to do soon?

163
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,140
Nintendo?

164
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,140
Are you going to fight against them?

165
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,780
I mean, there's nothing you can do.

166
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,420
So he asked Katari about that one.

167
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,420
Yeah.

168
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:57,300
He's basically put out he's re-uploaded the videos and blurred out the stuff that has

169
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,580
Nintendo's IP in it.

170
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,500
But it's still really stupid.

171
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:08,140
He has filed a counterclaim, but he doesn't think that it's going to get dropped, that

172
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,700
they're just going to leave it as a copyright strike because they don't like people hacking

173
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,700
their stuff.

174
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,460
Actually, Dark Sakura, I didn't even think about that comparison, but you really hit

175
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,560
can you elaborate on your joke a little bit for those that may not get it?

176
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,300
So you said ask Katari about that one.

177
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,300
Can you elaborate on that?

178
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,620
Because I actually think you you've struck a really interesting parallel here.

179
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:39,660
Well, there was just the business that led to Tengen, you know, becoming a thing is that

180
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:45,820
Tengen had people reverse engineer part of Nintendo's hardware.

181
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:53,060
And granted, it was under some false pretenses, but it was going back and forth on did they

182
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,820
you know, what did they do with how did they obtain it?

183
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,820
What did they get?

184
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:04,460
You know what, who has a license to release games on on third party cartridges, you know,

185
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:13,060
without the Nintendo seal of format cartridges for all of that, you know, had to do with

186
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:19,220
bypassing Nintendo's chip that's in the logic board of the system.

187
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:25,600
So that was a big back and forth and it did not work out all that great for Atari, really.

188
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,040
Well, they they still got the ability to sell those cartridges, but the Tetris thing

189
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,440
ended up but that was kind of a separate issue.

190
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,380
The Tetris thing was a completely different issue.

191
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,200
And in the end, what I'm saying is about what how it worked out for Atari in the end.

192
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,520
Who are we left with?

193
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,520
We have Nintendo.

194
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
Fair.

195
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,000
Atari is is an IP.

196
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Fair.

197
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
No.

198
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And you know what, though?

199
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,360
But those the and for those that might remember back in the day, those Tengen cartridges were

200
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,400
shaped differently.

201
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,960
They were different cartridges because Nintendo had a patent on their cartridge.

202
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,640
Atari through Tengen essentially reverse engineered how to make a Nintendo game work on the Nintendo

203
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,840
and came up with their own and their false pretenses.

204
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,840
Yes.

205
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
Yes.

206
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
And came up with their own cartridge.

207
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,640
But at the end of the day, they won that lawsuit that allowed them to continue selling the

208
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:17,560
cartridges because they were allowed to basically illegally, even though it was reverse engineered,

209
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,720
it was a little bit shady.

210
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
They did lose.

211
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,440
They had to pay a lot for the reverse engineering.

212
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
Yeah.

213
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,000
And they did lose some other things when it came to like Tetris.

214
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But that was a completely different issue is that the license for the arcade, which

215
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,760
our Atari had, and the license for home gaming, which Nintendo had, ended up having to be

216
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,960
proved to be a different thing.

217
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,520
Atari did not have the ability to put Tetris out for console.

218
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,360
There's just because I thought there was a lot more that there's a lot more going on

219
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,160
to the Tetris debacle than just that.

220
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Yes.

221
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,680
But to to simplify it into a three hour show, I think I hit on the big points.

222
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,680
But you're right.

223
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,120
Yes, it does go deeper than that.

224
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,960
And Bobby Black Wolf in our chat over at twitch.tv slash Vogue Network points out a couple other

225
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
parallels here.

226
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,440
Universal sued over Donkey Kong and lost.

227
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,440
So Nintendo's Galoob wasn't there wins and losses in court.

228
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,600
And yes, it follows it right up with Galoob and the Sega Genesis.

229
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Yep.

230
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,320
So it's because they have reverse engineered because Sega wanted money, a certain percentage

231
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,300
for their to be able to publish on their system.

232
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,900
And so they just reverse engineer and create all their tools so they wouldn't have to pay

233
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,900
that.

234
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,660
It's it's it's a total EA thing, but they did that as well.

235
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:35,060
And it's I wanted to kind of conclude my Tengen tangent tangent tangent.

236
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,900
That's an interesting little thing.

237
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,500
But with what Dark Soccer was saying about it didn't work out very well for Atari in

238
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:46,580
the end is that those cartridges didn't really end up having great sales.

239
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,780
And then there were other not like Color Dreams was one company that came in and started

240
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,780
making cartridges.

241
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,460
Other companies started coming in and making bootleg cartridges, his Bible company.

242
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,580
And the Bible companies did to excuse me.

243
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,580
And you know what?

244
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,780
They all had a reputation for being shitty games.

245
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,760
Like name one of those games that was good.

246
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,900
Tetris was good.

247
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,960
Klax was pretty good, actually.

248
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,020
But like most of the and not even just taking it like the other the others from the Color

249
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,060
Dreams in the Bible, none of them were good.

250
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,460
So an interesting thing is that Nintendo and this kind of worked out in Nintendo's favor

251
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:28,160
is that all all those games like you knew if it wasn't in an actual Nintendo cartridge,

252
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,900
it was probably going to be a shit game.

253
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,860
And so Nintendo kind of won on the intellectual side with that a little bit.

254
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,980
It's kind of fascinating how that worked out.

255
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,220
And you know, again, this is a tangent fantasy zone.

256
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,820
Oh, I forgot they did that one.

257
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,820
That's right.

258
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,900
The Sega crossovers that Tengen did.

259
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,900
That's right.

260
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,900
OK.

261
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,340
And the color palettes in the two of them were a little bit different.

262
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,340
I mean.

263
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,340
Oh, hi, Dan.

264
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:57,780
My husband's bringing me my soda.

265
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,780
I have priorities.

266
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,780
Be right back.

267
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,780
It's fine.

268
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,780
OK.

269
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,780
Anyway.

270
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,780
All right.

271
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,780
So.

272
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,780
So anyway.

273
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,500
But I think the point is with this whole like aside is that, you know, Nintendo has

274
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:13,780
tried to assert some of their you know, you can't hack this whole thing and all this.

275
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,220
And they've lost before on this.

276
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,760
So it is interesting and kind of going back to what Loki was saying, it is interesting

277
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,900
that you have a guy on YouTube that's putting all this together, but kind of is in a situation

278
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,260
where he can't like legally he isn't Atari.

279
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,620
He doesn't have the power to go up against Nintendo, even if he believes that what he's

280
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,020
doing is fair use.

281
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:42,740
I kind of like I get Nintendo's logic and I get why Nintendo legal is doing this, because

282
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,520
they obviously don't want that instruction out there.

283
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,020
It's not great for them.

284
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,100
It doesn't do anything, though.

285
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,100
It's not hurting anything.

286
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:55,900
It's not like it's not like breaking it open, like say the NES mini or something like that.

287
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,140
There's no flash storage on there.

288
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,140
Right.

289
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,360
There's enough room for like a ROM one.

290
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,220
You can't really do much with it.

291
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,380
I mean, they're saying that there's maybe modifications that they can do to replace

292
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,420
that chip with a larger chip, but it's pretty much just for funsies.

293
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,660
It's not really doing anything.

294
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,100
It's not going to hurt their bottom line.

295
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:22,140
If anything, it causes people to want that even more and maybe up the sales there.

296
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,020
And well, you know, and I think ultimately what happens to Nintendo here, and I think

297
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:31,780
this is one of the most overused phrases from armchair critics on the Internet, but it really

298
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,940
does apply here.

299
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:38,020
It's that whole Streisand effect thing, which, you know, if you've ever heard about.

300
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,740
Well, not that Streisand effect, but the whole the pictures of her house and like she

301
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:47,020
sued to get those pictures, and then that the picture ended up everywhere of her house.

302
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,580
It was like if she hadn't called legal attention to it, it probably never would have really

303
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,020
been picked up.

304
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:59,780
And like Anne Rice suing fan fiction writers that or that, too, I suppose, even though

305
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,100
my mind goes to Fifty Shades of Grey, even though, of course, that's not an Anne Rice

306
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,620
thing, but a fan fiction that got way bigger than it needed to be.

307
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,220
Yeah, but Anne Rice was suing people writing fan fiction of her work.

308
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,220
True.

309
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,020
So but but my point is and why I invoke that over invoked phrase of the Streisand effect

310
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:21,060
is I kind of think what happens here is that now, like all these, you know, podcasts, news

311
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,620
organizations and so forth that get blogs that are talking about this story are just

312
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:30,460
calling a light on to, hey, if you want to hack your game and watch, Nintendo doesn't

313
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,860
want you to see it, which makes people want to trade it even more.

314
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,700
So I I almost feel like it's going to have the reverse effect.

315
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,780
Would you agree with that, Loki?

316
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,820
Yeah, I just don't understand.

317
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,740
I mean, I get what they're trying to do, but I don't think it's going to necessarily work.

318
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:53,100
And honestly, it feels like a misuse of their copyright claim system, because, you know,

319
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,420
if you say something nice about the game and watch, they're not taking your video down.

320
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:03,580
But if you say something critical or talk about this in an educational way, well, they're

321
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,580
going to take the video down.

322
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:11,700
OK, I will agree with you to a point, but like educational like that's that's the word

323
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,620
we use to scapegoat the real meaning.

324
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,300
Like, let's just call it what it is.

325
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,420
What laws are they breaking?

326
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,220
There's no laws against reverse engineering hardware there.

327
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,860
They're there.

328
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,220
You own everything.

329
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,980
It's not like you're they're saying, well, if you do this, they'll allow you to pirate

330
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,700
all these games.

331
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,900
It is nothing.

332
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,900
It's modifying your own hardware.

333
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,540
I don't disagree with that, but let's call it what it is.

334
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,980
You don't own your own the devices that you buy from them.

335
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,580
No, I it's it's the same thing about like

336
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,660
hacking phones, hacking portable watches to play Doom on.

337
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,620
It's all that stuff.

338
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,900
It's the same thing.

339
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:51,860
But Nintendo just doesn't like it because it's how to load a ROM, which they they really

340
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,460
don't like, because because here's the gag, everyone.

341
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,500
This is why it's such a big deal, why Nintendo shutting it down.

342
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:04,420
Nintendo absolutely wants to do more of these with other games from their archive.

343
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,860
Duh.

344
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,860
That's why they're shutting it down, because they plan to release plenty more of these

345
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,140
this coming holiday.

346
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,900
Absolutely, absolutely.

347
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,140
And they don't want you to make your own, basically.

348
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:22,020
So but all I'm saying is that call it what it's educating how to side load a ROM like

349
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,700
that's that's what it is.

350
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:29,460
But I again, I feel like the people that really want to do that are going to do it without

351
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,180
YouTube's help.

352
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:37,220
And now all these people now know that didn't know before that you can side load and hack

353
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,060
a game and watch if you didn't know that before.

354
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,180
All right.

355
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,940
Yeah, I just think it's it's not going to make any difference.

356
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,580
I'm going to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

357
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,100
Phoenix 7726 says they could not stop any modern system from being hacked and this won't

358
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,900
work either.

359
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,740
They're wasting time and money fighting a battle whose best outcome is Pyrrhic.

360
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,340
Pyrrhic.

361
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:00,740
Excuse me.

362
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,580
And Tigerclaws says, imagine a Legend of Zelda game and watch.

363
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,100
Of course.

364
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,620
Why wouldn't they?

365
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,580
And then Bobby Black Wolf says, you don't have to imagine it.

366
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,380
You can do it now, thanks to educational videos.

367
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,940
If you can find them.

368
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:25,940
Yes, but maybe maybe the word education works in the sense that even if they take the video

369
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,780
down, there will always be a textbook.

370
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:35,940
Like, I don't know if y'all know, but even if they were to shut down Facebook, Twitter,

371
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,700
whatever social media companies, they all shut down everything.

372
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,740
You could still email like you used to.

373
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,860
You could pick up the phone and call somebody like you used to.

374
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:50,180
Like, there's still all these other ways to get information out there.

375
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,540
Anyway, let's just go back to LiveJournal.

376
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,580
Yeah, right.

377
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,180
No, actually, no.

378
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,620
LiveJournal got sold.

379
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,980
It's all about dead journal.

380
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,220
Dead journal.

381
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,100
Dark Sakura had a dead journal.

382
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,620
I know that you're muted, by the way.

383
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,700
You muted Dark Sakura.

384
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,340
I have a permanent LiveJournal.

385
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:12,980
Oh, me too.

386
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,540
Yeah, me too.

387
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:19,620
And I'm kind of tempted to go back and use it because I kind of kind of sick of stuff.

388
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,900
There's things about it that I miss.

389
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,140
I met my husband on LiveJournal.

390
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,820
I've said that a million times on this show.

391
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,700
Like, I met Extifer, who I've done shows with.

392
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,740
I met on LiveJournal.

393
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,620
My other old roommate.

394
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,740
I'm at a live with him.

395
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,940
I've I've met lots of people because of LiveJournal.

396
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,300
Kind of you guys in a way.

397
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:41,300
Like, I mean, it's more DDR freak, but I still think we all kind of like kept in touch better

398
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,300
because of something like LiveJournal.

399
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,140
I think that's the story about a lot of my friendships that I formed around that era.

400
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,300
You know, people like you guys, people like Shane, people like, you know, other guests

401
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:57,540
you've seen on this show before is that like we may not have like met, but we got to be

402
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:02,980
closer because of LiveJournal and, you know, reading each other's stuff when it wasn't

403
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,620
about like shocking links and things like that.

404
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,300
Phoenix 7726 is suggesting we could go back to Friendster.

405
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,060
Is that even still around anymore?

406
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,460
Is that it?

407
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:11,700
Yeah.

408
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,980
Is that still around?

409
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:19,700
I know it was huge in like certain parts of Asia for a while, like long after Facebook.

410
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,980
There's no line.

411
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,900
Yeah, he's lying.

412
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,260
SSG100 Matt is saying they also got burned by the folks using our three cards in the

413
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:28,900
past.

414
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,380
So this is just them getting ahead of the modding stuff.

415
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,180
Well, this is this isn't even that's completely different.

416
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,060
It is different.

417
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,460
Yeah.

418
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,140
You don't you don't need anything else.

419
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,660
That's the key thing, right?

420
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:38,900
Yeah.

421
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,060
Yeah.

422
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,660
This is like it's so limited in scope what you can do with this.

423
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:48,580
I would say like the R3 stuff that's similar to what you have with like the mini systems.

424
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,460
This is nothing like it.

425
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:58,180
You can literally you have to have like probes and special equipment to be able to actually

426
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,660
dump and put ROMs on there.

427
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,820
It's such an arduous process to do it.

428
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:08,980
That's like not even really worth it for most people to do it other than just a tinker with

429
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,700
something.

430
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,060
It's just I don't understand why they would even bother with this.

431
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,700
It's just it's such a ridiculous thing.

432
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,700
Like I don't know.

433
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,660
I don't see them cracking down on the NES mini hacking and the SNES mini hacking.

434
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,900
I mean, those videos are all over the place.

435
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,900
Like why this?

436
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,700
I don't know.

437
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,340
It's silly.

438
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,180
Zelda Game and Watch.

439
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,380
Yeah, Zelda Game and Watch.

440
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:31,700
That's why.

441
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,740
But even still, like even if they put it out, it's still going to sell like crazy.

442
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,260
This will literally affect nothing.

443
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:41,700
Phoenix 7726 says this very tongue in cheek.

444
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,020
OLRBBS at Rob Roberts.

445
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:51,860
Dude, BBS is like if you want to know why I'm so screwed up, that's because I was on

446
00:21:51,860 --> 00:22:01,940
BBS's nonstop from like the age of fuck, probably like 12 years old until I remember being on

447
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,380
a BBS and people were trying to get me to go see Rocky Horror Picture Show.

448
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,740
This was long before I was supposed to.

449
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,340
I was like 13 years old.

450
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,060
But people didn't know that because it was a BBS.

451
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,180
Couldn't see people.

452
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:18,900
I was on BBS's from the time I was like 12 years old until probably well into high school,

453
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,020
probably 17 or 18.

454
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,940
Whenever Prodigy, no, Prodigy was kind of in the middle of that.

455
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,060
But you guys know what I mean.

456
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:32,420
Like, haven't I joked on this show before we ought to have a VOG network BBS so we can

457
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,500
still play The Pit and Legend of the Dragon, Legend of the Drag Queens.

458
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,540
Sorry to play Legend of the Dragon, Legend of the Red Dragon.

459
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:52,820
And yes, I would play Legend of the Dragons and Trade Wars 2002, which is which that year

460
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,260
is long past trade wars.

461
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:54,900
Huh, Rob?

462
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,540
Trade.

463
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,020
Do you remember?

464
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,380
Do you remember Trade Wars?

465
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,140
It was like I didn't do BBS's.

466
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,460
Oh, you got a I was not.

467
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,140
I was not one of one of them.

468
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,740
I was an AOL kid.

469
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,540
OK, OK.

470
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,220
I did.

471
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,220
I did BBS's for a while.

472
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,140
It was kind of just.

473
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:17,140
You know, there wasn't really Internet access, and then eventually there was a local BBS

474
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,780
that actually allowed you to connect to the Internet.

475
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:24,260
So you connect through the BBS and then you'd be able to launch a Web browser somehow to

476
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,540
be able to connect to the Internet.

477
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,220
And so I was all over that.

478
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:33,140
And then that was that was back when then net zero was a thing for a while.

479
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,820
And then I was on that forever because it's free.

480
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,420
And then I don't remember.

481
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,820
Eventually we got high speed Internet somehow.

482
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,340
So like, I don't know.

483
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,460
That wasn't until I think that wasn't until I moved in with Rob.

484
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,980
We got high speed Internet.

485
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:54,340
BBS was the beginning of the end was when they all got email and you could start getting

486
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,180
email on your BBS account.

487
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,380
And it was kind of like that was when they all started to kind of start to merge into

488
00:23:59,380 --> 00:23:59,620
one.

489
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,100
And it's like the Internet was kind of like born from that.

490
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,380
For me, it was a lot of prodigy back in the day.

491
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,020
I used to post on the bulletin boards and prodigy like all the time.

492
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,900
And yeah, that was.

493
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,420
Yeah, AOL chat rooms are fun.

494
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:16,340
And like even just with like games and stuff like that, we're able to get stuff.

495
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,940
Yeah, fun times.

496
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,340
All right.

497
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,260
Internet enough reflection from the old folks home on BBS.

498
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,860
Thanks for that derailment chat.

499
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,940
All right.

500
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,580
Let's get into let's get into the new and the now.

501
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,100
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing

502
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,580
this week.

503
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,180
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

504
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:42,260
Now, again, now that you just put put like food that you're trying to eat, I'm going

505
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,060
to go to Loki then.

506
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,940
Oh, I swallowed quickly.

507
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,440
Okay.

508
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,660
Animal Crossing.

509
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,660
And patterned has new stuff out.

510
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,940
So I've been playing some more patterned.

511
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,340
Um, I have a lot of other stuff going on, so I haven't really, you know, like I said,

512
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:58,900
played a whole lot.

513
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,860
I'm trying to get through just this month before I start anything new.

514
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:06,420
But, um, I was going to be setting up the stuff for my stream and not a single person

515
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,420
donated to vote for a game.

516
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,100
So I don't know.

517
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,500
We'll see.

518
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,500
I put the call out.

519
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,380
No one answered.

520
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:21,540
So well, we might have to poll folks to see if there's something, maybe a different idea

521
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,820
that would get a little more.

522
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,100
Gotta pay for the vote.

523
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:24,600
Yeah.

524
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,560
All right.

525
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,140
Well, uh, if that's it for Dark Sakura's gaming week, let's go to Loki.

526
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,020
How was your gaming week?

527
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,860
Um, it was all right.

528
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,020
I played mostly Orna.

529
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,540
Um, I did play a bit of Minecraft this week.

530
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,300
I streamed a little bit on.

531
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,420
I saw some of that.

532
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:40,920
Yeah, yeah.

533
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:41,860
Yeah.

534
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,460
So I, I tried doing it.

535
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,180
I don't know.

536
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:48,740
Like I've been getting the itch to do more Minecraft stuff, but like I wanted, I want

537
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,740
to like play with actual people.

538
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,300
Like it's, it's kind of irritating.

539
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:57,300
I see that like this thing with a bunch of like, not really massive YouTubers, but like

540
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:03,060
some pretty decent YouTubers, um, decided to do that's the trend nowadays is these,

541
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,460
uh, survival multiplayer servers.

542
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:13,140
And so like there's dream SMP, which is kind of a dream is a speed runner for, um, Minecraft.

543
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,380
He also does these like manhunt videos and stuff like that.

544
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,900
So it's him and a bunch of friends, Mr.

545
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,180
Beast and stuff like that.

546
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:21,620
Um, they do their own thing and they kind of have almost like the soap opera thing that

547
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,660
goes on along with it.

548
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,980
So they write their own storyline to go along with that and drama and manufacturer drama

549
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,700
and stuff.

550
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:32,740
Um, then there's a brand new one called Epic SMP that just started with like Gus Johnson,

551
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:37,780
a bunch of other, uh, YouTubers as well that are pretty funny kind of on the comedy side

552
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,180
things.

553
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,780
A lot of these guys that I watch.

554
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,660
And so, um, they kind of all started playing.

555
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:46,340
It was just a bunch of people that like a lot of them haven't really even played Minecraft

556
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:46,740
before.

557
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:52,100
And so it's just kind of go, it's a big range of people that have, you know, lots of experience

558
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:57,060
in Minecraft, some of their primary Minecraft YouTubers and some that just do like comedy

559
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,500
stuff that are just kind of doing it with everybody else.

560
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,460
And so it's just a really cool mix, but it's fun to watch all of them just like work together

561
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,260
and like do something like, man, I want to do that kind of stuff.

562
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:13,220
But like, I can't find like a group of people cause like in order to do something like that,

563
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,380
you want to have a group of streamers that would actually want to like broadcast on a

564
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:22,100
regular basis and be able to get people that would play on a regular basis to kind of work

565
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,380
together on something.

566
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:28,660
Um, I do watch a lot of, you know, YouTube stuff, especially like, uh, Hermitcraft is

567
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:32,340
another one or truly bedrock on the bedrock side of Minecraft.

568
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:37,540
Um, they do these kind of like, you know, streams where they're not necessarily griefing

569
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:41,540
each other, which is kind of one big community that they work towards different things.

570
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:46,500
Hermitcraft, they have like this whole commerce system that they sell and buy stuff and they

571
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,340
do little activities and fun, like stuff like that.

572
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,700
So that would be fun.

573
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,220
I would love to do that.

574
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:56,260
Um, but, uh, the best, the closest I can get to that is I have a server where my kids demand

575
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,660
that I go build things for them.

576
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,060
And I end up, you know, having to do all the work and that's it.

577
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,380
And there's no sort of teamwork or anything.

578
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,420
It's just kids complaining about not having stuff.

579
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:13,460
So that's what I was streaming as I was showing off, like, uh, the realm that we've worked

580
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,620
on for the last 10 months and just all the different things that built in that.

581
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:22,260
So I just kind of wandered around for a good hour and a half, kind of showing all the builds

582
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,740
off that we've done, uh, or most of the bills.

583
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,500
There are some that are kind of far away that I didn't want to walk to, but, uh, it was

584
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,060
fun for a while, but like after a while, I just kind of, I don't know, it would be a

585
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:37,300
lot better if there was other people playing at the same time, I think, but I don't know.

586
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:43,140
It's, and even I know when we try to do like the VOG Minecraft stuff, it's hard because

587
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,900
there's, it's not everybody's playing at the same time.

588
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,420
You need to have people that are really like dedicated to playing at the same time, I guess,

589
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,740
or just coordinate schedules is hard too with, you know, adults.

590
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:59,700
Um, so I don't know how we would do that, but like it would be, it wouldn't be nice to

591
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,100
build that.

592
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,700
So I'm just going to try to find maybe some folks to start something like that.

593
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,340
Cause it'd be fun.

594
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,020
But in the meantime, I have this, the realm I've been playing for a while.

595
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,900
So I was showing that off and all the bills that we have in there.

596
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,860
So it was pretty cool.

597
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,360
Nice.

598
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,140
All right.

599
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,300
Yeah.

600
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,500
I caught a little bit of that stream.

601
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,940
It was a guy I was lurking.

602
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,100
I, sometimes I do it from my, um, Xbox.

603
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,860
So it's a little bit of a pain in the ass to chat, but I, I lurk.

604
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,820
So it's cool.

605
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:26,100
I caught a little bit of it, um, my gaming week.

606
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,820
So, uh, speaking of streaming, I did a couple of final fantasy 14 streams in the past week.

607
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:36,900
Myself and, uh, my friends, Shane and Ray, we were doing some streaming of just like

608
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,660
maps is a big thing we're into in the game right now is that you do these treasure maps

609
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,660
and once in a while, like one out of every four or something, we'll do a portal that

610
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,500
takes you to this big roulette wheel.

611
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,780
And it's almost like you're playing a game show, but you're doing fights on the game.

612
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,180
It's like smash TV, but in final fantasy.

613
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:56,180
Um, so those have been kind of fun just to stream because, you know, I'm sure the viewers

614
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:00,100
love to see when we get zonked out or, you know, we think we get zonked out and then

615
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,820
the lightning bolt, uh, crashes and we get another spin, just silly things like that.

616
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,140
So been having fun playing final fantasy 14.

617
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,700
Um, and, uh, we'll try to do some more streams cause that's been a good way to kind of motivate

618
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,420
myself to do some streaming on my personal channel over at Rob Roberts here on Twitch.

619
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,260
Um, but that's not all I've been playing.

620
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,700
I've been playing some other games too.

621
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:25,060
Um, over on Xbox, I played a little more Tetris effect just because I hadn't cleared

622
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,060
journey mode on Xbox yet.

623
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:31,220
Um, I played a little bit of the multiplayer previously, but I hadn't really played any

624
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:31,940
of the single player.

625
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:35,380
So I kind of, you know, I just went through in the night and knocked all that out, got

626
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:40,100
some achievements, uh, from playing that front to back and doing all that.

627
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:45,220
Um, if anybody actually does the Microsoft reward points, uh, they have a thing going

628
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,460
on right now where like up to 10,000 gamers scored that you are in this month turns into

629
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,340
points.

630
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,380
And I like being very recursive with the points.

631
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,060
Cause if you get like 6,000 points, you can get like a $5 Xbox card.

632
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:01,300
So that's just like five bucks towards your next game or let them stack up and that whole

633
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:01,540
thing.

634
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,260
So that's kind of, that's, that's fun.

635
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:08,820
Um, and also on Xbox torchlight three hit game pass.

636
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,140
So I played that just a little bit.

637
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:15,460
Um, still trying to kind of wrap my head around it because there's a lot that going on in

638
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:18,260
that game and the tutorial isn't very great.

639
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:23,060
Um, I'm not sure I'm as into it as I was torchlight two, but I'm going to try to give it a little

640
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,380
more time and see if it's something that grows on me a little bit.

641
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,700
And I've heard kind of in general that not as many people were as big on torchlight three,

642
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,380
um, because I guess it felt a little bit more like it was supposed to be a phone or a spinoff

643
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:33,540
thing.

644
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:37,620
And they kind of kind of back ended it into being an official torchlight three.

645
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,300
And I can kind of see that, but I want to be fair and give it a little more time just

646
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:41,700
to see.

647
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:47,700
Um, and then otherwise I've been playing a lot of Pokemon shield still working on my

648
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,420
pokey decks.

649
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,780
I'm almost so, uh, not counting the DLC.

650
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:56,100
I refuse to let myself get the DLC until I finish my pokey decks in the main game.

651
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,300
And I'm getting really close.

652
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,140
You guys I'm under 20 now.

653
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,460
I think last count I was at 17.

654
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,620
Um, I put a call out on Twitter earlier.

655
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,900
I was like, help, I need a Galarian Darumaka.

656
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:13,140
I can't get one on home because on home you can't specify that you want a Galarian Darumaka.

657
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,900
So every time I would put up like Galarian Corsola, which kind of like the equivalent

658
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:22,180
in shield, I would get fucking regular Darumakas that somebody caught in Pokemon Go.

659
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,380
I'm like, I don't want these.

660
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,340
I want a Galarian one and I wasn't getting them.

661
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:31,060
But finally, so I went on Twitter and I ugly begged and thankfully it worked.

662
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,820
Somebody was like, yep, I'm ready.

663
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,620
Here's the code.

664
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,980
It was like, perfect.

665
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,580
So I got what I needed there.

666
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,620
So, um, yeah, so I'm down to like only 17.

667
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:43,940
Um, I still have some, the other one that's going to be really hard to get is the, um,

668
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,820
there's an apple.

669
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,300
There's an there's Applin.

670
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:53,460
And then that evolves into one type with a shield item and one type with a sword item.

671
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,260
And I can't find any more of the berries.

672
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,620
I had one to make the app, whatever the evolved one is.

673
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:05,220
I cannot find another stupid berry or apple or whatever it is to evolve.

674
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,260
Even just get a second one of those to trade somebody for the shield or for the sword

675
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:10,980
equivalent.

676
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,580
Yeah, it's such a pain in the ass.

677
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,820
So thank you, Appleton and Flapple.

678
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:18,340
I can never, so I have Appleton, I think I need Flapple.

679
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,780
So I'll figure it out.

680
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,100
Um, I just have to find another one of those berries.

681
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,460
Somebody said you got to check near the trees and sometimes you'll see a sparkling.

682
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,260
Do they still make Snapple?

683
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,540
I think they do.

684
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,820
I think they do as well.

685
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,500
I just, I miss the Snapple lady.

686
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,300
Remember those commercials?

687
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,260
I miss fruitopia.

688
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,620
Hi from Snapple.

689
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,020
All right.

690
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,820
Anyway, uh, she Hulk says, what is Pokemon?

691
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,580
Uh, it's, it's a addicting little game, especially during quarantine.

692
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,700
That's for sure.

693
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,860
So, um, let's see.

694
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,340
Act Def says Appleton is the fat one.

695
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,620
Flapple is the skinny one.

696
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,980
Now that's not very nice.

697
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,620
That's not a very nice way to say it.

698
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,300
Um, let's see.

699
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,100
Bobby Blackwell says, this is why I stopped playing Pokemon sword.

700
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:03,700
Once the credits rolled, I did two a year ago and then quarantine happened.

701
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,140
And you know what happened guys?

702
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,260
I got really bored.

703
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:12,820
So I was like, I, I, I'm going to catch, I got bored and bought equipment.

704
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,780
I got bored and bought stuff.

705
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,580
I got bored and I said, you know what?

706
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,140
Today, I'm going to catch them all.

707
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:21,700
Oh yes.

708
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:26,260
I'm going to catch them all and I'm still working on it.

709
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,460
So well, better catch Pokemon than, you know, the plague.

710
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,900
That's, that's very true.

711
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,540
Very, very true.

712
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,500
All right.

713
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:33,940
Anyway.

714
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,700
Um, so that's it for my gaming week.

715
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,060
Lots of Pokemans.

716
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,580
A Pokemon go as well.

717
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,340
I have been playing that too.

718
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,580
Um, a chop community day was Saturday.

719
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,100
I kind of half-assed it.

720
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,620
I got seven shinies.

721
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,740
That's plenty.

722
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,260
I don't need more than that.

723
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:54,420
Um, and then I forgot to evolve to get the special move, which I'm really annoyed about.

724
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,620
I think I got one that has the special move and I'm really annoyed.

725
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,580
I forgot to do the others.

726
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,580
Oh my, I know fail on all accounts, right?

727
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,340
No pixel Pacas.

728
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,660
I got bored and made a passion's discord server.

729
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,300
Like the soap opera, my favorite soap opera of all time passions.

730
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,540
Oh my God.

731
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:16,260
I just said FFS passions because for fuck's sake, really?

732
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,820
That's kind of funny.

733
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,460
Oh my God.

734
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,140
It really is the soap opera.

735
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,340
I'm going to join.

736
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,420
I love that with Tabitha and Timmy.

737
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,060
You don't even know.

738
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:33,620
We used to get together in college and drink and watch, uh, passions that was taped earlier

739
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,100
in the day.

740
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,300
Good times.

741
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,620
You know what we used to do in college?

742
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,180
What?

743
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,100
Play the jumping flash demo on repeat.

744
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:46,980
We played a lot of Mario Kart, but the other thing was taking all of the anime that my

745
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,980
friends had like third generation, you know, like taped off of TV and whatnot stuff.

746
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,540
And then, uh, make up our own dialogue.

747
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:59,380
As Joe and Hunter Matt and chat says, can you use elite TM to get payback yet?

748
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,940
I think so, but I'm not going to burn an elite TM on that.

749
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,100
I don't even think that's one of the more useful moves.

750
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,420
Is it?

751
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:08,660
I feel like there's other Mon with other useful moves that you really want to TM into.

752
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,340
So anyway.

753
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:11,540
All right.

754
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,260
I got one.

755
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,620
That's probably plenty.

756
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,980
Uh, let's move on.

757
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,300
That's it.

758
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,820
That's enough Pokemon chat.

759
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,300
Let's get into some other gaming news here.

760
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,980
Cause there was some stuff that went on this week.

761
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,860
We're starting to get back into the regular cycle of news again.

762
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:27,780
Um, and there's a, especially with consumer electronics show this week, although there

763
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,220
wasn't a lot of gaming news out of CES, but there was a little bit.

764
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,220
Um, but there was news on all sorts of fronts.

765
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:33,540
Right.

766
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,820
And including one story that won't go away.

767
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,140
Right.

768
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:37,540
Loki.

769
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,060
Uh, that is correct.

770
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:41,460
Yeah.

771
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:51,140
So, um, CG CD project red, um, they put out an apology video, uh, talking about their

772
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:56,740
commitment to quality and which, uh, the co-founder, uh, Marcin.

773
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:04,580
The wind ski apologize for the state of a cyberpunk 2077, basically said that not to

774
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:09,780
blame the dev teams, that it was up to the board to decide when to release that game.

775
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:17,940
Um, also that they were having issues with performance on the, uh, older consoles because

776
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:23,780
of the streaming service or the asset streaming that they were putting into the game.

777
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:30,100
Cause it's so condensed into a small area that, um, they have to keep rewriting that

778
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,700
basically said that they put out a roadmap.

779
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,220
Um, like, I mean, I swear to God, it's like, we talk about this all the time with different

780
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,260
games and these roadmaps, like our game socks, right?

781
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,020
Well, it's not sucks, but our game is less than ideal right now.

782
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,940
So now we're going to put out a roadmap and when it's going to be done.

783
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,020
So there's a big patches expected out soon.

784
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,500
I think it actually already came out 1.06.

785
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,140
Um, and actually that just came out the hot fix for that.

786
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,740
And then there should be a more substantial patch in like 10 days or so.

787
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,540
And then another one following that as well.

788
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,420
Um, they're going to be putting out the free DLCs.

789
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,260
There's going to be the next gen consulate date, which was supposed to be coming out.

790
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,140
Now it was originally set for March.

791
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,940
That ain't happening.

792
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,260
That's now coming out the second half of the year.

793
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,300
And yeah, so everything pushed back.

794
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,380
They also said that they're not going to be having their teams crunch,

795
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,380
or they're going to be avoiding crunch on all future product or projects.

796
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,220
He said is one of their priorities.

797
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:31,460
Okay.

798
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,500
But they said that before.

799
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,180
Yeah.

800
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:34,660
I'm I'm.

801
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,500
He apologized, but did he resign though?

802
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,780
Did he talk about his personal accountability though?

803
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,860
Did he talk about, see that's.

804
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,020
I don't know.

805
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,620
That's where it kind of starts to lose me.

806
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:48,660
Yeah.

807
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,340
It's it's no, he did not.

808
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,220
And it, it felt kind of hollow.

809
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,900
Like there was stuff, you know, where they like, oh, we thought it was in good shape.

810
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,340
You know, it was in pretty good shape.

811
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,180
No, you didn't.

812
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,140
You know, better.

813
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,900
You could, there's no way, you know, cause they, I think they mentioned something about

814
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:09,300
like in our testing, you know, it, everything seemed to be going well, but like there was

815
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,260
stuff that was happening that you guys are experiencing outside our testing.

816
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:16,340
It's like, dude, like there's, it's just normal gameplay.

817
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,100
Like there's stuff clearly broken.

818
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,420
Stuff that's clearly been pieced together.

819
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,620
You know, uh, they were talking about like the police system in the game and how there

820
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:31,780
was going to be some police that were corrupt that you could bribe.

821
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:36,260
Or, you know, if you got your wanted level too high, there would be, you know, assassins

822
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,700
that would come after you and stuff like that.

823
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,180
That is not what's in the game right now.

824
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:45,220
It is basically you cause a crime and the police teleport to you somehow.

825
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,300
They will literally spawn in right behind you.

826
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,020
Even if you're locked yourself into a closet or something.

827
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,140
It is just ridiculous.

828
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:58,260
Like just how, uh, rushed everything seems to be.

829
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,940
So like, I don't really buy half of what he's saying.

830
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,820
And honestly, like, show me the receipts.

831
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,540
I want to see these patches and see what it does to the game.

832
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,380
Cause I don't believe you right now.

833
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,220
Show me the receipts, retire bitch.

834
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,380
Cause that's the only way anything's going to change.

835
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,220
Like, sorry, but not sorry.

836
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,100
But Bobby says in chat from now on, we won't have crunch.

837
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:18,420
Okay.

838
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,820
For real this time from now on, we won't have crunch.

839
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,220
Okay.

840
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,340
Third time's the charm.

841
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,660
Now, from now on, we won't have crunch.

842
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,980
I'm not buying what you're selling retire bitch.

843
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,380
Because that's the only way anything's really going to change.

844
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:33,860
Yeah.

845
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,220
It's I don't anticipate any sort of changes.

846
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,500
They did, they got caught.

847
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,940
They needed, they felt like that they needed to apologize to save face.

848
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,580
But I mean, come on.

849
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:51,060
It's just, this is the same stuff that we get from EA and, you know, oh, well, I'm sorry

850
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,260
that the quality of our game, here's the roadmap of how we're laying it out.

851
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,980
Oh, Hey, look, it's Bethesda talking about Fallout 76.

852
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,140
Here's the roadmap on how we're fixing it.

853
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:04,900
Like, come on you guys, you got to stop doing this, but they're not going to, because

854
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:11,780
people still buy their games and there's no, there's literally no sort of, um, punishment

855
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,260
for them.

856
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,900
I mean, they, there's no consequences for them to do this.

857
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,500
And that's why you're going to keep seeing them do this because people will keep supporting

858
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,000
them.

859
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,140
Some comments from chat.

860
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,900
Fifth Dream in chat says it's not CD Projekt Red if the guy who runs it resigns.

861
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:30,260
Mojang would like to have a word, a company that is in a far better position, thanks to

862
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,020
those sorts of changes, that's for sure.

863
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:37,540
Zen Monkey says be happy with the devil you have now because the next one could be a lot

864
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,260
worse.

865
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,540
I'm not sure.

866
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,740
I mean, I understand that saying and why it's out there.

867
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,820
I'm not sure I would apply it in this scenario.

868
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:52,900
Like I, again, and I said this early on when this all started happening, the only way that

869
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:57,860
things are going to change is with new leadership and that, and I stand by what I said four

870
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:03,060
weeks ago or whenever this stuff first started breaking is that one of these co-leaders is

871
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,140
going down because of this.

872
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:08,340
And we'll see, it's just, we're just, we're seeing everything play out.

873
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:12,660
It's all, it's all the motions because, because he, did he not try to blame the board in this

874
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,860
what he said, right?

875
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,020
You think the board's going to have that?

876
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,940
Well, he was, he's part of the board.

877
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:21,380
So what he is basically trying to do, it wasn't that he was blaming somebody else.

878
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:27,140
He was basically trying to shift blame from the actual developers saying you shouldn't,

879
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:31,940
because people are sending death threats to these people because they're dumb and it's

880
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,820
the internet.

881
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:37,780
So they were basically saying, you know, listen, don't come after the developers.

882
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:40,580
It's not, they're doing the game is in this situation.

883
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,580
You know, we decided the shift as the board is the one that makes that final decision.

884
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:44,820
Right.

885
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:50,020
And you can, don't ever bully developers and people that work at the company.

886
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,700
That's just a stupid thing in general.

887
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:57,060
So I will, I will say that like, yes, that is the, and that is a message that needs to

888
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:01,460
be out there, unfortunately, because people don't know how to conduct themselves online.

889
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:06,020
So that part, certainly I have no problem with that statement, except the fact that

890
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,140
it has to be said at all.

891
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:07,780
That's for sure.

892
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:14,580
So, Bobby Blackall says, Cyberpunk 2077 is a failure of management, not a failure of

893
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,860
developers or QA.

894
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,220
100% agree.

895
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:21,380
And again, there's many people that would say it's not a failure at all, depending on

896
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,060
what platform you're playing it on or, you know, just how your luck has been with what

897
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,420
you've run into in game or not.

898
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:32,900
And that's, that's part of the interesting kind of layers of this whole story is that

899
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,780
it's not bad for everybody, just some people.

900
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,780
So anyway, all right.

901
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,420
But Loki, you're still, you're still playing the game and for the most part liking it,

902
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:42,820
right?

903
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,380
I haven't, I haven't played it in a while.

904
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,420
I did like it.

905
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,740
I mean, I thought the story was okay.

906
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:52,580
I'm okay with some of the bugs right now, as long as it doesn't break the game completely

907
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,380
for me.

908
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,980
So far, I haven't really ran into the thing.

909
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,820
The police thing is kind of stupid.

910
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,500
Like I don't really fight.

911
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,580
I don't really cause any crimes in the game, but like if I wanted to kind of have like

912
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:07,700
a, you know, spree or something like that, I don't think it's really fair the way that

913
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,500
the system works.

914
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,340
I mean, literally they spawn in anywhere.

915
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,620
Like you can watch videos online.

916
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:17,060
They show, you know, examples of that where you'll be up on top of like a little, you

917
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:22,180
know, ledge, like, you know, way up on a building and you shoot somebody, you look around, there's

918
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:23,060
no one there.

919
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,860
All of a sudden, boom, there's like literally a cop right behind you.

920
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,940
It's like, how did you get up here?

921
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,780
How did you teleport behind me?

922
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,700
It's just silly.

923
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,940
All right, let's move on.

924
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:37,940
Let's talk about a brand new Nintendo Switch that was announced this week.

925
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,940
Sorry, it's not the Switch Pro that all the gaming media is trying to get you hyped for,

926
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,780
but it's just a, it's a new skin for the classic Nintendo Switch.

927
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,340
Although I will say this is a very good looking system.

928
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:55,300
It is a Mario themed Nintendo Switch, and it's aptly timed with Super Mario 3D World

929
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,580
plus Bowser's Fury.

930
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:02,660
This new Switch will be out on February 12th to kind of be in tandem with that for those

931
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:07,060
that may finally break down and get a Switch because that's the game that's releasing or

932
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,380
those that are spending their stimulus money on a Switch.

933
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,820
I don't know, your money, your business.

934
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:16,820
But it is a nice, it's a red and blue edition, so it's themed like Mario colors.

935
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,020
Sorry, Luigi fans.

936
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,180
That would get me excited.

937
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:22,820
How about a green and white one for Luigi suspenders?

938
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:26,980
But whatever we have or one that you dip it in water and it changes colors.

939
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,020
Don't, please don't dip your Switch into water.

940
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,540
Please do not dip your Switch into water.

941
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:32,500
That was a dumb joke.

942
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,060
All right.

943
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:38,260
Anyway, we'll just spread that rumor online and lots of people will break the Switches.

944
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:38,820
Hehe.

945
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,100
We'll make a video.

946
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:40,600
All right.

947
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,220
But it's a red and blue system.

948
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,060
So it's like the dock's red.

949
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:48,660
The little dog ear thing that you put your controllers in is blue.

950
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,140
The Joy-Cons are red and blue.

951
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:54,420
There's a carrying case that's red and blue with yellow zippers.

952
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,340
It is very like Mario inspired.

953
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,260
It's supposed to kind of look like Mario suspenders.

954
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,420
It's going to cost you the $300 that a Nintendo Switch would cost.

955
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,980
I think it looks really cool though.

956
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:11,140
Like, and I can't justify spending $300 just to get a Switch in another color.

957
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:14,740
But if I didn't have a Switch, I'd be all about wanting to get this one.

958
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:15,460
That's for sure.

959
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,580
Speaking of Mario 3D World and Bowser's Fury.

960
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,700
And we were just talking a little bit about this a couple weeks ago on the show.

961
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,900
Whatever happened to like amiibos being used in games?

962
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,140
Well, apparently Mario 3D World and Bowser's Fury will have some amiibo support.

963
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,780
So what's going to happen?

964
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:38,820
Bowser and Bowser Jr., their amiibo figures will be returning to retailers and they have

965
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,260
some specific activation.

966
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,940
But we don't know exactly what it is.

967
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:46,260
And then there are some cat amiibo that will also have some features.

968
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:49,940
So it sounds like, you know, we're getting some reprints out of this and there will be

969
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,940
some sort of, I bet it will probably give you items in the game or something like that.

970
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,460
Are the cat ones new?

971
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,100
There are some new cat ones coming.

972
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:58,580
Okay.

973
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:58,740
Yeah.

974
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:04,500
So, or they'll unlock some new costumes kind of like Mario Odyssey or something like that.

975
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,000
Who knows?

976
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:13,240
So Zen Monkey in chat says Nintendo should take a risk and kill off Mario.

977
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:23,480
Can you imagine, can you imagine Mario murder party where like one of, one of these great

978
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:28,120
mascots will be killed off by Nintendo, never to be seen again.

979
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,440
Sorry Waluigi.

980
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:36,280
They tease that several times in the smash videos.

981
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,200
Remember like Sephiroth.

982
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,640
Sephiroth thing was so good.

983
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,140
Yeah.

984
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:47,640
And then, I know there was another one too, where like his soul got knocked out of his

985
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,920
body or something like that.

986
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:53,640
I want to say there was some, I think it was a smash video where that happened.

987
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,880
I don't remember which character was though.

988
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,160
Ridley says chat.

989
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,300
Oh yeah.

990
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:04,140
Um, Sia Tabiri says Mario is missing, but with blood dripping from the letters.

991
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:07,500
Mario is missing permanently.

992
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,020
You guys are sick.

993
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:11,520
I love it.

994
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,540
You guys have problems.

995
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:15,040
All right.

996
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:21,660
Sia Tabiri says I legitimately still want to murder mystery party in Animal Crossing.

997
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:26,700
Well, like it, and you know, to keep it legit, it doesn't have to be like actual murder,

998
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:31,580
but I think it would be fun to have costume parties that are like that in Animal Crossing.

999
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:32,780
I think that's cool.

1000
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,460
So, all right.

1001
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,980
Anyhow, let's move on.

1002
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,180
Let's talk about a different system than Nintendo.

1003
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,380
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

1004
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:45,980
Uh, I have something about the PS5.

1005
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:51,260
So, um, you know, people are always looking for the patents that come out regarding any

1006
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:54,780
of these systems to try to get an idea of what could be happening.

1007
00:48:54,780 --> 00:49:00,540
And there has been a patent filed that looks like there's going to be something to,

1008
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,220
as an add in, something to add to the experience.

1009
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:09,100
So, um, this particular patent that's come to light,

1010
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:14,300
it looks like a PlayStation VR headset that includes haptic feedback.

1011
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,740
There's no dates or anything, of course, with that,

1012
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:22,620
but it looks like one of those ones that could just immediately be implemented.

1013
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:28,860
Um, another one allows players to leave text and audio notes in games for other users.

1014
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:34,300
So, like, if you like, say, walk up on like a trouble point,

1015
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,620
then you might get a tip there if you look for it.

1016
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:40,060
You know, that sounds like a Dark Souls thing in every game.

1017
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,940
I was actually saying more like Super Mario Maker.

1018
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:44,620
Oh, yeah, that too.

1019
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:45,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1020
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,640
Yeah.

1021
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:53,680
Um, and, uh, but basically it's there for user generated game advice.

1022
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,720
Um, has, and they also specify that it will live quote within

1023
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,000
a game space using a virtual coordinate system and quote.

1024
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,520
So, um, it could be interesting.

1025
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,680
I kind of love that idea as long as I can limit it to my friends.

1026
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,000
But I don't want to see stranger danger notes because I'll just see

1027
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,080
dicks everywhere in every game I play.

1028
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:21,200
But if I, if I limit it to friends, I'll only see the dicks that Loki drew and put in games.

1029
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,040
It would, it would be, it sounds like it would be just like Dark Souls almost, but like.

1030
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,040
Or Mario Maker is a good comparison.

1031
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,320
If you died here, you suck.

1032
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,920
I'd only leave that note for you, Jamie.

1033
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:38,320
Yeah, the thing is, though, is that I wouldn't, uh, look for any notes.

1034
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,840
Joke's on you, Rob. I disabled all your notes.

1035
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,000
Exactly, exactly.

1036
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:49,040
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says, if you died, if you died here, you're Bobby Black Wolf.

1037
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,720
Yep. No, I just leave little notes in every game.

1038
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:58,560
Rob Roberts was here, but you know, the best way not to lose Rob when don't play.

1039
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,400
Uh, but seriously, sometimes I'm kidding.

1040
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,560
Seriously, that patent sounds really neat.

1041
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:11,520
I'd I'd actually love to see something like that in the, um, uh, ecosystem for PlayStation.

1042
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,360
And it makes sense too, because they have the whole like hitting the button to see the,

1043
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:22,640
the YouTube or whatever Sony proprietary video to see how to get certain achievements.

1044
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,680
Like that is a thing that's already kind of baked in the PlayStation five.

1045
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,840
So like user generated content of that sort makes a lot of sense.

1046
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:34,480
Again, I worry about what happens if everybody and everyone can do that,

1047
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,080
but if you can follow certain trusted people or your friends or something like that,

1048
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,160
I think it could be really cool to be honest.

1049
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:46,800
To be honest, I think that's a neat feature for the, uh, console and, uh, yeah, I look forward to

1050
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:54,880
it. All right. Well, let's move on Loki. All right. So, you know, it's hard to believe that

1051
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:01,200
even though we're still in the middle of COVID, they were talking about, um, these brand new

1052
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:06,240
tournament leagues that are coming up soon. So starting off with, um, Overwatch, uh,

1053
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,880
Overwatch league, they've announced their 2021 season. It sounds like it's going to be kind of

1054
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:17,440
similar to what they've been doing already with, um, you know, taking considerations for COVID and

1055
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:22,000
stuff. So for example, instead of actually traveling to these different parts of the

1056
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,600
country, everybody's going to be kind of hunkered down in their own countries and playing online

1057
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:32,720
only match matches. They're structured around regional tournaments. They're splitting up,

1058
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:39,920
uh, the league into two divisions, North America and European. Um, so they're going to be playing

1059
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:47,440
in the 13 team North American division, and then the remaining seven are going to be played in the

1060
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:55,200
Asia division. And then, um, yeah, I mean, it's, it's interesting. I mean, they have to obviously

1061
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,080
adapt with everything. Hopefully this year, things will be starting to kind of, uh, the restrictions

1062
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,960
will be loosening up towards the end of the year. So things can get back to normal, but it sounds

1063
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:10,400
like it's going to be business as usual, aside from, you know, the structure, the, uh, format changes

1064
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:16,320
for these. So, um, fifth dream in chat says, whoa, Overwatch still exists. That kind of got quiet.

1065
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:20,960
Um, well, keep in mind, there's still Overwatch two on the horizon and they're expecting that that

1066
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,440
will certainly give the whole franchise a big kick in the butt because yeah, this whole COVID and

1067
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,080
pandemic situation really kind of ham hamstring to the Overwatch league, you know, justice,

1068
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:34,320
it was really starting to get its wings and really take off like COVID really. Well, I would say it

1069
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:39,520
was one, two punch. It wasn't just COVID, but the move to YouTube was a disaster. I'm sorry,

1070
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,160
but like it just like the sense of community that they had on Twitch and everything that was a

1071
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,320
disaster. Whoever thought of that idea to move. I know they did it for money, but that was,

1072
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:53,280
it was a dumb move. Sorry. Not sorry. That's reality. Um, and so those two things like back

1073
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,680
to back, I think really kind of, and I'm not saying like Overwatch league is fucked,

1074
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:01,200
they're over anything like that. Like certainly no, there's, there's still plenty of fans at

1075
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:06,960
Overwatch league. And I think in the long run, especially when two does come out, um, it will,

1076
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,120
you know, I think start to get a lot of that growth that was all that was starting to really

1077
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:17,680
be behind it until these situations really, I think kind of put a stop to it for a little bit.

1078
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:24,640
Um, I would fully expect blizzard does not launch Overwatch two until the pandemic is

1079
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:30,240
starting to look like it is in the rear view mirror. I know there's plenty of people saying

1080
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:35,200
COVID will always be around always be, but as far as, you know, uh, being able to have these

1081
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,720
big events again, enough people are getting vaccinated and at least the numbers in the

1082
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:44,320
U S are allowing for big events again and that sort of thing. Um, I think blizzard would be

1083
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:49,760
very smart to hold on to Overwatch two until then. And then the Overwatch league, I think will kind

1084
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:57,600
of, um, be in a good place again. Yes. And then on the opposite end of the spectrum there, you

1085
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:04,320
have Capcom announcing that the upcoming Capcom cup and street fighter, uh, league world

1086
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:10,960
championship have been canceled, um, due to obviously the rising cases of COVID-19. Um,

1087
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:15,760
they've made the decision to cancel those in place. They're going to be doing an online

1088
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,960
season final for the Capcom pro tour on February 20th and 21st.

1089
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:27,920
Um, tiger claw and chat says, and when they announced Overwatch two, you can expect some

1090
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,480
really massive pre-rendered cinematic. Technically Overwatch two has already been announced with a

1091
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:38,160
massive pre-rendered cinematic. However, blizzard likes to drop those pretty regularly and it's

1092
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,800
almost certain they will do more character reveals. And if I'm not mistaken, they have

1093
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:48,720
an event, a virtual event in February that I think is supposed to make, uh, kind of make up for their

1094
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,840
lack of Blizzcon. Cause obviously with everything in the world, they didn't have a Blizzcon in

1095
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:56,560
November for obvious reasons. So I believe they're doing a virtual event in February, ironically

1096
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:02,800
enough. So is the team behind Final Fantasy 14 is doing an event February 5th, where it's all

1097
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:08,560
but certain the next 14 expansion will be unveiled. And I think blizzard, um, they're

1098
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:13,920
really not due to announce a wow expansion cause one just came out, but certainly Overwatch two

1099
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:20,000
Diablo four might even get a date. I don't know how far along it is that Diablo cell phone game

1100
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,120
has all but vanished. So I wonder if they're still going to release it. They might, you know,

1101
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:28,160
time that with February. So blizzard still has a lot of news they're kind of sitting on too.

1102
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:34,320
And I think we'll see all that in February. So, um, I want, before we get to our next story,

1103
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:38,960
I wanted to go back to the earlier, uh, story that Jamie was talking about with leaving notes

1104
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,840
and games. Cause there's a really good comment here, uh, from, from our own voiceover guy,

1105
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:50,880
VX Jason XV, who says my note, I would leave pepperoni and cheese. And you know what that

1106
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:56,480
reminded me of is actually like one of the earliest implementations of this before Mario

1107
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:04,720
maker before dark souls, the Oregon trail. Remember when you would die on the Oregon trail,

1108
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:10,560
you could leave a tombstone behind and put like, you could either put like, you know, pepperoni

1109
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:14,320
and sausage was a big one that people would always do. Or you could put like, you know,

1110
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,520
name of my third grade teacher died of syphilis here or something like that, you know, whatever

1111
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:24,160
it is, you could put whatever notes you wanted to. And then the players that would come through

1112
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:30,720
later would see those tombstones. So really even before Mario maker or dark souls, the Oregon

1113
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:36,720
trail was the first game that left that technology. That is great. I thought that was worth bringing

1114
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:41,520
up. All right. Anyhow, let's move on and we'll actually continue talking about Blizzard a little

1115
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:48,000
bit because this has to do with a redesign for the battle net, uh, client getting rid of real names.

1116
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:54,080
Well, they got rid of that a long time ago. You never had to do that. Uh,

1117
00:57:54,080 --> 00:58:02,880
they realized it was a bad idea. You can connect it to Facebook, I think, or you can choose who

1118
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,520
sees that. I don't remember. You know what? Now that I think about it, I think my real name is

1119
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:12,240
still visible on there and I don't like it, but I only show it to people that I know in real life.

1120
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,480
I think it's the whole, you can choose to show your real name to like close friends

1121
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,920
or something like that. I don't know. Oh, it's been a while since I played Overwatch.

1122
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,840
It has. Thank you for reminding me about that real name policy, but anyway, um,

1123
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:29,120
otherwise the client has been redesigned. It is interesting because it is still kind of blending

1124
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:34,400
in the Activision games, which have been in battle net for some time. That's not really new news that

1125
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:39,120
call of duty games are in there, but like you really see it in this new redesign that actually

1126
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:44,480
kind of separates, uh, things into Blizzard and Activision, which is kind of interesting. Uh,

1127
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:48,240
they're saying in this, and I did check it out earlier, but I've been in the beta for a while.

1128
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:53,040
So I've actually saw these changes a while ago, but, uh, there's a new expansive layout for news

1129
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:57,840
and game content and full page view. There's a new social pain. So you can better see friends

1130
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:01,600
and what they're doing in games right now. I have a lot of friends still playing. Wow.

1131
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:07,040
I sign on. There's at least 13 people on my list and wow at any given time. Uh, and they're also

1132
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:11,840
talking about accessibility improvements and that's cool. You can navigate most of the app

1133
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:17,600
with your keyboard and it has better screen reader support as well as improved color contrast.

1134
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:22,080
And those are all great things, uh, to see as well. So if you haven't checked out your battle

1135
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:28,080
net client in a while, it's going to look a lot different next time you launch it. Let's move on

1136
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:34,640
dark soccer. I got a bunch of stuff here. So, um, who remembers Lucas arts?

1137
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,680
Well, of course who doesn't? I had friends that worked at Lucas arts. That's how I got to go to

1138
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:48,720
the Skywalker ranch. Yeah. Um, but now we have a Lucasfilm games. So this officially, uh, revealed

1139
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:56,080
by starwars.com that Lucasfilm games is their, uh, identity for their gaming stuff coming from

1140
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:01,280
Lucasfilm. Which I also believe was the name of Lucas arts for a brief period in the beginning

1141
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:07,680
before they changed it. Yes. It's kind of like back, back to basics. Yeah, exactly. Um, but

1142
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:12,080
they're really wanting to have this focus specifically on some of the new games that

1143
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:16,960
are come out, bring out the news directly, sort of like, I guess, have their own directs, like how

1144
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:25,360
Nintendo does. Um, but, uh, they are, um, still working of course, though, with, uh, with other

1145
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:32,160
parties out there, you know, they're not just gonna, gonna do it alone. Um, there is, uh, an

1146
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:40,400
open world star wars game being made by Ubisoft. I'm doing a, sorry. Uh, it looks like it might be,

1147
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:45,360
no, it's just, it just says open world game. I don't see anything about it being, uh, uh,

1148
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:51,520
um, an MMO or anything, but it's by Ubisoft massive, the same group that did, uh, the division.

1149
01:00:52,160 --> 01:01:00,320
So there's some talk about that coming out. Um, and then in, uh, other things, um, uh,

1150
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:07,120
machine games is making an Indiana Jones game. So, uh, and it's going to be a collab between

1151
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:14,240
machine games and Lucasfilm games. Neat machine games, by the way, is a, is a part of Bethesda.

1152
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,840
Yeah. Uh, which, which will be interesting cause the whole Microsoft connection there now too,

1153
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:24,080
which this was probably something that the gears were already turning on before Microsoft bottom.

1154
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,600
So that is going to make that whole situation more interesting, I think in a way.

1155
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:32,320
So I just wanted to have like a mini game. That's how many Nazis can you punch in a minute?

1156
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:40,160
Um, Bobby Black Wolf in chat actually points out it was Lucasfilm games from 1982 to 1990. So it

1157
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:44,720
was more than a brief period, but only the nineties count here at OLR actually. Uh, no,

1158
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:50,160
thanks for the clarification. Um, tiger class says Lucasfilm games has a big library of IPs.

1159
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:55,920
They can bring back besides star wars in Indiana Jones. Oh, hell yeah. Loom. Um, what maniac

1160
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,080
mansion was all part of that too, right? There's a new mania mansion to be amazing,

1161
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:03,360
but they, they kind of did bring that back already. Didn't they,

1162
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,920
didn't that come back a couple of years ago under a different, I mean,

1163
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,680
I don't, did they do a telltale? I don't think they did a telltale series for mania mania

1164
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:16,880
mansion aside from just day of the tentacle. Maybe it was a spiritual successor. Maybe that's

1165
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,720
where monkey Island would be nice. I mean, you can never have too much monkey Island.

1166
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:27,800
Obviously we're getting some more salmon max. So, um, that's always good. Um,

1167
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,520
Ooh. Yeah. Questbuster points out it released games under that label,

1168
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:39,600
such as their adaptation for labyrinth. Yes. It even had David Bowie. Ooh. Ooh,

1169
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:44,960
I'd be in for that. That's for sure. So that's pretty cool. Yeah, no, they had a lot of great

1170
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,760
IPs, but obviously they're leveraging some of this big shit. I mean, you don't partner up

1171
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:55,840
with Lucas, you know, entertainment and not get your star Wars on and your Indiana Jones.

1172
01:02:55,840 --> 01:03:00,560
Like these are the, these are the big ones. And I'm sure if these do well, we'll start to see some

1173
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:07,920
of the, um, lesser known ones that will pop in as well for sure. So, all right. Well, if that's

1174
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,680
all we have for that, then let's move on to our next story. Loki.

1175
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:19,280
All right. Um, so it's always fun to talk about like different records being broken on Twitch.

1176
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:25,760
So now we have yet another all time Twitch viewership records set by a Spanish streamer

1177
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:31,040
by the name of the Greg or is that the Greff? I don't know how to pronounce his name. Uh,

1178
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:40,240
but anyways, so he apparently was already a pretty popular streamer. He had, I think a record of 660,000

1179
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:46,640
concurrent viewers for his Fortnite Galactus event that was back in December. And then of course,

1180
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:53,120
because he's such a big, uh, Fortnite streamer, he was unveiling his brand new exclusive Fortnite

1181
01:03:53,120 --> 01:04:03,440
skin, um, that he was, uh, showing off. So because of that, his view count actually went up to 2.4

1182
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:10,960
million, which was now the brand new record for that. So that's even, um, beating out

1183
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:20,960
AOC is among the stream, uh, the AOC streams, um, and several entire like communities of games

1184
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:25,680
at one time. So that's pretty crazy. Well, it's also worth considering that, um, you know,

1185
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:30,880
sometimes our focus and our reality is very centric around the United States.

1186
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:35,200
And we are certainly aware that there are other countries out there, you know, in Canada and

1187
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:41,520
overseas and, uh, Mexico and all that. But I think it also kind of goes to show like how

1188
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:47,440
big of an audience there is in like Latin America for video games. Cause, um, he, he's a Spanish

1189
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:52,800
streamer. He's, he speaks Spanish on streams and all that I'm sure. Right. So it's, it's a big

1190
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:58,960
audience that I think sometimes we might forget is there if we don't speak that language ourselves.

1191
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:04,720
And I think it just shows that like, there's huge demand for this in non English speaking countries.

1192
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:11,520
Yeah. For just gaming in general. Absolutely. So, and act deft who I was hoping would agree with me

1193
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:19,680
does. Thank you. I, we, we have, we have our official ambassador to Mexico and active,

1194
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:23,120
although there actually are some other listeners in Mexico. Cause I interact with some on Twitter.

1195
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:27,840
So I don't, I don't want to give all the glory to act deft, but since he is here live, I will let

1196
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:34,560
him have most of it. So, but a lot of love for all of our listeners in Mexico and all the other

1197
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:40,640
countries around the world that aren't just the U S all right. Anyway, uh, pretty cool though.

1198
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:44,560
Uh, interesting that it is still Fortnite that breaks all these records, right?

1199
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:50,000
Yeah. You know, after all this time, I mean, it's still a very popular game, so.

1200
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:56,080
I was reading some article on one of those sites. I don't know if it's Kotaku or what it was,

1201
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:59,840
but it was one of those sites. It was talking about that. There's another game that's like

1202
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:05,280
seven years old or something that is starting to find new light on Twitch. Like it's just come out

1203
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:10,400
again out of nowhere, kind of like among us did recently. There's some other new game rust.

1204
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:16,640
Yeah. Rust was because of offline TV. They're doing some, uh, thing with that. I, I did,

1205
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:21,280
I caught a little bit of it, but yeah, it's, they're doing some sort of, I think this is

1206
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,440
almost kind of like going back to us talking about with the Minecraft S and P stuff where they'll

1207
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:30,800
kind of structure an event based around like a certain game and do kind of like role play

1208
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:36,160
or whatever with that. And it draws in a lot of viewers. My point is, is that Pixel Poops

1209
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:43,840
will have its day. It will be discovered eventually. And actually on a side note,

1210
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:48,880
uh, with YYR's version of Pixel Poops, I should give a shout out. Um, if you are on our discord

1211
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,840
server, cause I need to mention this at some point in the show, um, over at, um, uh, I almost

1212
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:59,280
said Twitch TV, uh, slash vog network is where you can watch the shows, but over at vognetwork.com

1213
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:04,240
slash discord, you can get an invite to our discord server. And if you take a look in our

1214
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:11,840
OLR chat room, there is detail about how you can beta test Pixel Poops for steam and everything

1215
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:17,280
is in fact, I just got my code, so I'm going to be playing it later. Maybe I'll even do a stream.

1216
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:22,560
We'll see. So check that out. All the info's in our discord, uh, and, uh, and YYR is hooking

1217
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:27,360
people up right now. So check that out. Uh, Bobby Blackall was saying his game super multitasking

1218
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:32,480
is apparently big in South Korea. Fucking finally that game is getting some traction.

1219
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:37,200
Like that game is brilliant. I hope more people find it than just South Korea.

1220
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:43,040
Um, although it has to, it always, it has to start somewhere. And so why not? It's as good

1221
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:49,600
of a place as any. All right, let's move on. I want to talk about some of the news that

1222
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:54,080
actually came out of consumer electronics show. There wasn't a ton, a ton of gaming news,

1223
01:07:54,080 --> 01:08:00,480
but we did get as expected. We kind of figured this was coming on last week's show arcade one up

1224
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:05,280
since those are, yes, it's gaming, but it's also like furniture in your living room,

1225
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:10,960
dedicated devices type of stuff. CES is kind of the place for that. So, and yes,

1226
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:17,280
we got some new news on arcade cabinets from, uh, CES 2021 for, um, from arcade one up.

1227
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:23,280
And I got to say, these are some fucking good cabinets. Like this, this first one blew my mind.

1228
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:30,480
It is a killer instinct cabinet with killer instinct, killer instinct two and battle toads,

1229
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:35,840
battle toads, double dragon. It's like a rare cabinet. So that is awesome. Like just having

1230
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:41,840
the arcade version of killer instinct two. Fuck. That's awesome. So that like, I want it, but I

1231
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:46,640
don't have the room for it. Here's something that's definitely up dark Sakura's alley a little bit.

1232
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:51,120
And I think it's up mine too. I would love this machine. Although, um, these games have been

1233
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:58,320
released a million times, but why not a cabinet for dragon's lair, dragon's lair two and space

1234
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:04,960
ACE. And what's really cool about that. You can get one that is either a dragon's lair cabinet,

1235
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:10,240
or you can get a space ACE cabinet, but the entire in the inside parts are still the same.

1236
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:14,320
So that's kind of, so if you want like a S I almost think the space ACE is a little

1237
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:17,920
more desirable because you don't see that one as much. Dragon's lair is kind of everywhere,

1238
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:22,160
but that is neat. I don't know, dark soccer. You've probably played those games to death,

1239
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:25,440
but I know you have a lot of love for Don Bluth. So I don't know, maybe.

1240
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:30,560
I, I, I do. It's I really like his animation. I'll be honest. I'm really not all that great

1241
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:36,240
at either. Um, uh, really any of those cinematic, you know, press the button at the right time type

1242
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:42,880
stories. Um, but I certainly like watching other people play it. I, I certainly, I mean,

1243
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:46,640
they're, they're both great games. I've played quite a bit of dragon's lair, dragon's lair,

1244
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:52,800
two, um, space ACE, um, cliff jumper, which was the loop on the third. Oh,

1245
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:58,560
one. Um, there's that one with the car. What was the one with the car? I played that on Sega CD.

1246
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:05,200
I think I don't remember the one with the car. Um, and it always makes me think of, um,

1247
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:12,880
um, oh gosh, as a, another, uh, it reminds me of the anime writing bean, which it's an

1248
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:18,720
IDs era one. Um, we've had like the special car and everything. It was the race car. Why can't

1249
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:23,680
I think of the name of it now? That one was always fun, but I, I was never any good at them.

1250
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:27,680
And tiger client chat says, maybe they'll release those other laser disc games. You never know.

1251
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:33,120
I mean, now there has been a precedent set that if they want to, they can update those,

1252
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:37,520
those cabinets with new games. And Bobby black Wolf went into great detail on an earlier episode

1253
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:42,160
of his show about, you know, for better or for worse. And actually that is all on the YouTube.

1254
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:46,800
Uh, I know I don't plug the, the VOG network YouTube very often, but that is all chronicled

1255
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:52,480
there. If you want to see that. So like an actual, his outrun cabinet actually got a new game. Um,

1256
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:56,560
even though it was a little bit of pain in the ass to make work, he detailed all that in a video.

1257
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:01,120
So yes, they could add a new game. These are running off of laser discs anymore.

1258
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:04,960
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. They're just running off of like a USB stick at this point.

1259
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:09,120
So yeah, that's where we're at now. Maybe it was road Avenger, SSG 100. Matt

1260
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,560
was suggesting. I kind of think it started with a T, but I might be wrong.

1261
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:18,400
Anyway. I also wanted to call out before we get to, yeah, it was road blast. It was a road blaster,

1262
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:22,560
road Avenger. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I was like road blasters was a different game, but I it's okay.

1263
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:28,800
It's a different. I think it's in like kind of that universe. Yeah. Road Avenger was the game.

1264
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:34,320
Ironically, it was road blaster overseas. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Cause here in America,

1265
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:38,480
here in America road blaster was ironically to bring it full circle, the Atari game

1266
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:44,240
that had the, you know, you had the lasers and stuff on there. So, um, that, that was

1267
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:48,880
an awesome game too. So, all right. Anyway, uh, some other cabinets, I didn't even get to the

1268
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:53,120
other cabinets, although these are, these are a little more recycled cabinets, but kinda like,

1269
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:58,880
you know, uh, freshened up, uh, with a new retro look, uh, there's going to be a new Atari cabinet,

1270
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:05,120
um, that has quite a few games in it. I don't know that game, um, asteroids, asteroid, deluxe,

1271
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:10,000
centipede, crystal castles, gravatar, liberator, major havoc, millipede, missile command space,

1272
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:16,160
dual and tempest. Whew. That's a very, very stocked cabinet. There is a Bondi Namco cabinet,

1273
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:21,200
uh, that will have dig dug, dig dug to Gallagher, Galaxian, Pac-land Pac-Man,

1274
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:27,360
Pac-Mania, Pac and Pal, Mappy, Rompers, Super Pac-Man. That's a pretty stocked cabinet as well.

1275
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:33,520
And then there will be a Capcom cabinet with 1994, Loopmaster, Commando, Dark Stalkers,

1276
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:39,600
Final Fight, Ghosts and Goblins, Street Fighter, Street Fighter 2 Turbo, Street Fighter 2 Basic,

1277
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:50,320
and Strider. So that, uh-oh, uh-oh. Uh, there is a new Capcom cabinet and Strider is one of the

1278
01:12:50,320 --> 01:13:04,240
games in it. One of the Arcade 1-Up machines. Uh-oh. Damn it. I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna

1279
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:09,680
have to, I have to leave now because I have to go harass my husband and tell him that such a thing

1280
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:16,480
is going to exist. The moment that broke Dark Sakura finally on Arcade 1-Up, I'm just, I'm dying

1281
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:22,160
over here. What? Well, there's some, but we were thinking about getting, but I mean,

1282
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,800
that was, that was me when, when burger time finally happened. God

1283
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:38,080
damn it. They find, they got, they got me gal. They already had it in the Final Fight cabinet

1284
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:42,000
at one point. Oh really? You know, those were marked down to $50 at one point too.

1285
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:46,400
Yeah, I couldn't find them, but I need to, I need to tell husband.

1286
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,960
Bonds006 says her eyes glazed over when nostalgia. Yep.

1287
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:59,440
Uh, Bobby Blackwall says that was me with Star Wars. And then again with Outrun. I think I,

1288
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:04,320
you know, speaking of Star Wars, I think I texted Melody when that happened. Cause she's always been

1289
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:08,080
huge into Star Wars. One of my good gal pals, Melody. We, I know we've brought up on the show

1290
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:15,280
before, uh, married to, uh, Mel B who everybody in DDR knew back in the day. Um, she's really

1291
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:19,920
super into Star Wars. And I think I remember a text message exchange where I text her that

1292
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:30,160
Star Wars cabinet and it was, that's basically the reply I got. God damn it. It's just, it's the

1293
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:35,600
sound of your wallet. Like just a God, just tell me where I got to send the money. We're doing,

1294
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:41,920
we're doing all this other shit in my house. But you know what? But is the Strider cabinet

1295
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:49,440
one of them? Well, I mean, honestly enough, if we sold like a pinball, we could buy

1296
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:58,240
four machines like this, I don't know, maybe four, four or five or six, who knows? But yeah,

1297
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:03,920
no, I, I, I, I'm just thinking that if there was going to be one that was to be purchased,

1298
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:09,920
I think that Strider might be the one that, that breaks down. Finally broke. All right.

1299
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,720
I feel like this should be a thing with arcade one up. Like what is your God damn it cabinet?

1300
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:22,320
What is the cabinet arcade one up has to announce that's going to make you know, God damn it. And

1301
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:26,960
now you got to buy it. Like, like for example, for most, for most people in chat, I'm sorry,

1302
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:32,160
for most people in chat, spy Hunter, imagine that because that spy Hunter cabinet, God damn it.

1303
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:38,240
All right. So you can check online. Brick seek, for example, is a good place to check for like

1304
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:41,920
discounts. So like we've got one in a local Walmart here. They have the

1305
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:47,680
moral combat cabinet for 75 bucks. Ooh. Ooh. I kind of see that one.

1306
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:55,200
Cause see, it's not that I'd be saving money. I would be losing $75 for games I already own.

1307
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:00,480
I would be losing space. I don't have in this house. So I already told you,

1308
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:04,640
you could borrow a pinball. I know. I know when we, when we get the new one, maybe.

1309
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:14,880
All right. Anyhow, but not theater, but not that one. Damn. All right. You can borrow anything you

1310
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:24,320
want, but you can't borrow that. Okay. I would do anything for pinball, but I won't do all right.

1311
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:28,400
Forget it. You know what? Let's just get to the classic game of the week before this segment gets

1312
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:35,280
ugly. Every week, our soccer steps into the gaming vault and she says, God damn it. It's

1313
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:40,160
been a long time since I played this game. I'm like, God damn it. If someone needs to

1314
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:46,560
dust in here. It's a classic game of the week. Ironically, the game last week was Strider,

1315
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:51,760
although different Strider, but anyway, it's just for you, Rob. Everything is coming full

1316
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:57,920
circle on OLR tonight. Anyway, but we have a, we have a fun one tonight. I like this choice.

1317
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:02,080
Classic of the week, dark soccer is going to find a game that's 10 years older or more

1318
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:06,080
to reflect on fondly. And I think for me, I was like, Oh God, this game is, this game is

1319
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:11,920
probably like 20 years old at this point. Yeah. So if you're going by the original,

1320
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:18,800
which is where I'm starting. Yes, of course. So the classic game of the week is Cape story

1321
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:27,040
or as it was in, uh, in Japanese doc to Monogatari. Um, so it is a, one of those quote,

1322
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:32,880
Metroidvania style games. It came out for windows first. This is actually, I think one of the few

1323
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:39,280
ones I've done that started off as a windows game. Um, and it was developed by a Japanese

1324
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:46,800
developer Daisuke Amaya also goes by pixel. Um, and it's free time. Um, the game is a,

1325
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:55,040
a 2d platformer, um, that has those, uh, exploratory elements and, uh, you know,

1326
01:17:55,040 --> 01:18:01,040
discovery and different characters you, uh, encounter along the way and different

1327
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:09,040
branching paths in the story. Um, and it's really one of those, uh, those, you know,

1328
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:14,480
when someone thinks of an indie game cave story should really be the first one that comes to mind

1329
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:21,200
because it was done by one person. You're right. And it broke through in such a way

1330
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:26,800
to like, this was before things like axiom verge and I'm getting to that. Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry.

1331
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:33,600
But no, but, uh, it really is the game. I think to the indie game to influence

1332
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:38,960
maybe all indie games, you know, in the, in the modern era, you know, if one person can

1333
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:42,640
make such an Epic game, who's to say that a couple of friends together can't make, you know,

1334
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:48,720
an Epic game. So yeah. So that's where I was really going with that one. Um, and it is a

1335
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:55,600
pretty fast paced game. Um, you basically start as a robot named quote, who wakes up with amnesia

1336
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:02,240
and must blow shit up and dig and look around and talk to people and figure out who he was

1337
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:11,120
and power up and, uh, getting experience and talking to NPCs and, and having doors attack you.

1338
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:18,800
Yes, you can be attacked by a door. Um, but I mean, it's a very simple game for how it plays,

1339
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:24,880
you know, it's, you know, running, jumping, shooting shit. You've got your HUD, you have

1340
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:31,120
your cute little pixely world and everything. And I remember playing, you know, uh,

1341
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:38,640
translations of this, like in the early days, you know, but you also do have different, you know,

1342
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:45,200
puzzles in the game that you have to solve and, you know, uh, getting through, uh, you know,

1343
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:51,680
really like large amounts of enemies in some points. Um, and then, you know, it's also then

1344
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:58,560
depending on what you do depends on what ending that you get. Like if you save this one character,

1345
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:06,880
you get your memories back. If you, you know, if you don't meet this character, then it's a

1346
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:12,880
completely different game as far as how it ends, you know, you, uh, people can, you know,

1347
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:19,200
friends can turn into enemies if you don't do certain things in the game. So, um, and I'm not

1348
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:22,800
going to, I mean, honestly, it's a, it's a fun game and I didn't really don't want to, want to

1349
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:27,840
spoil it, but, you know, it's a game I really want people to go out and play. I mean, it's very,

1350
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:34,400
it can be very complex. Um, but the game was actually developed over the course of five years.

1351
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:42,320
Um, uh, Pixel, uh, uh, created this when he was in college and worked on it after getting a job

1352
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:47,600
as a software developer, he wrote, he started by writing title screen music and just different

1353
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:54,480
character movements. And then, you know, the idea evolved from there, um, by him creating

1354
01:20:54,480 --> 01:21:00,960
enclosed spaces, it kind of took that cave feel. And, um, you know, he said that because he didn't

1355
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:05,680
plan it, he did have some problems down the line. Um, cause he didn't have like, you know,

1356
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:11,360
map editing tools and different things to manage things, but he was really going for like an old

1357
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:17,520
school game, something based off of Metroid, um, and pixel art, he wanted really pixel art games.

1358
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:25,360
And so it is, uh, it's really become one of those games that, you know, got passed around from one

1359
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:31,440
person to the next and, you know, different things. Um, but then we got later ports of it.

1360
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:39,600
We had Linux, um, we had, uh, uh, let me see what the other ones were. So yeah, we had, um, uh,

1361
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:49,760
Linux, we had haiku OS, uh, air Ross morph OS, Amiga OS, Mac OS 10, uh, PlayStation portable,

1362
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:55,920
Xbox streamcast, Sega Genesis, GP two X, GP two X whiz, TI graphing calculator.

1363
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:00,320
I knew this on my graphing calculator for the record. I was, I was like,

1364
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:04,240
Sega Genesis. Like I knew about things like the 3DS and stuff where I played it, but I didn't

1365
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:08,720
know they, they kind of demade it or, you know what I mean? Like kind of pushed it onto older

1366
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:15,600
stuff too. That's pretty rad. Yeah. Um, but there's a, you know, with some of the other

1367
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:22,480
versions that came out though, we did get updated an updated version. Um, and that came out, um,

1368
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:29,200
on, we were, uh, on March 22nd, 2010 in North America and December 10th, 2010 in Europe.

1369
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:36,800
It was also ported to DSI where, um, November 29th, 2010 in North America and the 22nd of November,

1370
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:42,160
2011 in Japan, um, that didn't have the enhanced graphics from the Wii version,

1371
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:49,680
but it did have the sanctuary attack mode. Um, there is a remake, like a free SDL based version

1372
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:54,880
of the game of, sorry, of the game engine called NX engine, um, that people have been using to

1373
01:22:54,880 --> 01:23:01,760
modify the game and expand upon it. Um, there was also a re-release for the 3DS, uh, Nintendo E-shop

1374
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:08,640
and then, um, that version has the DSI, uh, uh, whereas a version of jukebox mode and the

1375
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:14,560
additional modes that were included in cave story plus. So, um, that does bring me to cave story

1376
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:22,000
plus, which was, uh, it has, um, a different script than the original English version. Um,

1377
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:27,840
and it has basically all the various modes from the Wiiware version, the remastered soundtrack,

1378
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:33,280
toggling the style of the graphics between the classic and the Wiiware version and the music and

1379
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:39,920
all of that has a wind fortress, uh, exclusive level, um, all kinds of stuff. And then you have

1380
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:47,360
a cave story 3d, which is a 3d version of the game that was, uh, uh, published for the Nintendo 3DS.

1381
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:53,200
Um, and I built back on that, but yeah, it had 3d models and a dynamic camera angle system and

1382
01:23:53,200 --> 01:24:00,240
whatnot. I personally prefer just straight up pixels. I will play it. I have the steam copy and

1383
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:07,520
I really like it. Um, but yeah, this game is, and on top of that, it's, it's a big game. I mean,

1384
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:12,320
it's not like, I mean, there's, yeah, everyone's going to speed run whatever the crap they can,

1385
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:18,240
but this game is, it's pretty big. It's going to, you know, be something that you'll sit down

1386
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:27,520
and play for a little while. Um, but yeah, um, there, uh, there's been other, uh, uh, things

1387
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:33,360
to come from this game. Um, the character quote, uh, is a downloadable character in bit trip,

1388
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:40,480
uh, presents runner to future legend of rhythm, alien, um, curly brace. Another character in the

1389
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:47,120
game is a bonus playable character. And, uh, 1,001 spikes. Both of them are in the crossover

1390
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:53,600
fighting game blade strangers. Um, and quote, curly brace and ballast the last fight. Um,

1391
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:59,520
they're all available in another game by the publisher, um, crystal crisis, and you can get

1392
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:04,880
quotes hat in the game Terraria, but this game is considered really to be one of the most

1393
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:11,360
influential, influential games that came out in the, in the aughts. Um, and really the fact that

1394
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:19,440
one person could put this game out, it really, um, inspired other people to do the same. Um,

1395
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:24,560
you know, one, uh, you know, doujin soft, which is a, uh, a Japanese independent game,

1396
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:32,480
um, actually brought back that Metroidvania genre. A lot of people said so, um, and bringing

1397
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:37,920
back 2d games as a viable platform when everyone was smack dab in the middle of look at all my,

1398
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:45,200
my, uh, polygons is, is so, and, you know, and it also, uh, some of the other games that this

1399
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:52,240
one directly inspired are, were braid, super meat boy, Fez, Mega Man 11, even, um, and it's

1400
01:25:52,240 --> 01:26:00,240
considered really one of the most, uh, influential games. Now, once it was released for free,

1401
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:07,120
you know, but the company, uh, Nicholas, uh, that took over the publishing issued cease and desists

1402
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:12,480
and DMCA against the fan projects that use the game's assets and the decompiled code base.

1403
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:21,040
Um, but, uh, but there were a lot of game developers that really seem to criticize this

1404
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:28,160
action, um, to apply, you know, retrospective rights, uh, to it, you know, because they didn't

1405
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:36,320
have the original rights on those releases. So, yeah, but anyway, there you go. Awesome game,

1406
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:39,360
cave story. If you haven't played it, I highly suggest doing so.

1407
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:44,560
Great pick. And like you said, I think, and I was kind of getting into there a little bit earlier,

1408
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:50,080
is that like, you know, this game was right on the cusp of when those indie games really just

1409
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:55,520
started to be everywhere because of the fact that the game consoles really started to open up to

1410
01:26:55,520 --> 01:27:00,080
self publishing and that sort of thing. And then we saw more self publishing kind of happen on,

1411
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:05,280
you know, steam platforms and, and, uh, PC and so forth, or, or, or the app store, if you will,

1412
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:11,600
on the, um, uh, Apple side, you know, there's, this was really like a predecessor to all of

1413
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:17,920
that. And I think, you know, there's a little something that all those things are, uh, owing

1414
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:24,000
to cave story for sure. Absolutely. Yeah. Great pick. So, yeah, well, I'm surprised I actually

1415
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,000
hadn't done it because I mean, story is just one of those games that I remember just playing,

1416
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,800
you know, translated copies of back in the day. Yeah. Uh, as Joe and her mat says,

1417
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,480
I feel like this was in the early humble bundles. You're probably absolutely right.

1418
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:42,080
Humble bundle seven. That's where I got it that late. I would have thought it was his one or two,

1419
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:47,280
to be honest. Wow. I believe it was humble bundle seven. No cave story. Plus was a humble bundle

1420
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:52,560
seven. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I played plus. That's right. I forgot. Yeah. Same thing. I remember

1421
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:56,640
picking it up on the WiiWare or, um, was it, we were, no, it was three DS. I got it on three DS

1422
01:27:56,640 --> 01:28:02,720
shop. Cause it was really cheap at one point. Yeah. I just had my, you know, my translated copy,

1423
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:08,720
my fan translation for the longest time. All right. So yeah. Cave story. All right. Let's

1424
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:15,040
move on. We got to travel around the world and get some rapid fire news. Loki. All right. So

1425
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:21,680
Hogwarts legacy has been delayed in 2022. Hopefully that'll give you enough time to forget

1426
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:27,360
all the things that, uh, the author said, well, she can, she can, the internet has an

1427
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:32,640
eternal memory. She can start with an apology, but at least this gives her time to do it, I guess,

1428
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:38,400
but we'll, I'm not going to hold my breath. Yes. Basically, you know, they need more time for the

1429
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:46,640
game. So 2022 for now. And then, uh, apparently Pokemon snap, since it's coming back brand new

1430
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:53,200
game, uh, they'll be coming out on the switch April 30th. And that was announced, um, with a

1431
01:28:53,200 --> 01:29:00,160
real birthday. Yay. I can't wait to play the new, uh, Pokemon snap, to be honest,

1432
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:04,640
it'll be fun about that. Looking forward to it. Speaking of Pokemon and Jason kind of addressed

1433
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:08,160
this in tonight's intro. And I think this is, uh, this is like one of those, like,

1434
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:14,160
what type of things. But, um, as Jason pointed out in tonight's intro, uh, it's the Katy Perry

1435
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:19,680
has been tied with video games before. Uh, she did the Simlish stuff for the Sims. I forgot all

1436
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:24,480
about that until I heard tonight's intro. I was like, Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There was a few that

1437
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:29,360
were involved with that, but, um, the reason why I'm calling out Katy Perry specifically is because,

1438
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:35,040
uh, the Pokemon company has brought Katy Perry in who is well, and who's to say maybe Lily Allen

1439
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:41,120
will be there too, because they say Katy Perry is the first in a star studded lineup of music stars

1440
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:48,000
that is supposed to work on what's called P25, a collection of artists that are celebrating

1441
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:53,680
Pokemon throughout the year. You got, you got Jigglypuff. Who else do you need? Anyway,

1442
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:57,840
we don't know exactly like what is Katy Perry doing? We don't know. We assume it's a song

1443
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:04,640
for maybe some type of soundtrack. Who knows? Um, anyway, uh, but they, they did announce there is,

1444
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:08,480
there is a partnership with Katy Perry. Maybe she's going to host Pokemon idol. I don't know.

1445
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:13,520
Anyway. Um, I suppose this is a good point for me to kind of call out to that there is a

1446
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:18,800
big rumor going around the internet, um, about diamond and Pearl remakes supposedly being

1447
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:23,840
confirmed, although Nintendo hasn't confirmed shit, neither has the Pokemon company, but I guess

1448
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:28,240
there is a URL that showed up that has a lot of people kind of going, Ooh. And then of course,

1449
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:33,440
one of those like, well, this website said it, so it must be true. So we're all still kind of

1450
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:37,600
waiting to see where that ultimately goes. I hope it's true. I'd love to see diamond Pearl remakes,

1451
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:43,200
especially with Sword of Shield's quality of life improvements and tie into Pokemon home.

1452
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:50,160
That'd be fucking great, but, um, you know, we'll see. Um, you would think we would get them, but I,

1453
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:56,080
again, I, I try not to expect anything from the Pokemon company or Nintendo, cause it usually

1454
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:59,760
leads to disappointment, but I want to make sure that got called out at some point tonight.

1455
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:04,240
Um, one other story I have has to do with Scott Pilgrim versus the world, the game,

1456
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:09,280
which a lot of people are being reintroduced to this week, or maybe finding it for the first time,

1457
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:14,800
uh, thanks to the remaster that just came out, uh, and due to all the discussion and interviews and

1458
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:20,400
things, and people kind of poking away at this game, it was discovered, um, Brian Lee O'Malley,

1459
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:25,120
who of course is the creator of, of the franchise, uh, mentioned there was supposed to be another

1460
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:30,960
DLC. Uh, it was going to be a DLC that focused on the clash at demon head. Uh, it was going to take

1461
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:36,960
place in Montreal and it would actually have envy Adams, Todd Ingram and Lynette guy caught

1462
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:43,040
would all be playable in it. Uh, in the end, the DLC was canceled because of budget cuts.

1463
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:48,000
So I don't know, they cross your fingers in your toes. Maybe they could make that DLC for the new

1464
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:54,800
one. But again, I would not set my expectations anywhere because that always leads to disappointment.

1465
01:31:54,800 --> 01:32:00,480
Anyway, uh, dark Sakura, what do you have for us? How about what might've been, um,

1466
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:06,720
the, uh, super Famicom was supposed to have a back to the future RPG game, um, from what it

1467
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:14,720
looks like. Um, it was, uh, there were, it looks like, uh, like a few, uh, shots and some, uh,

1468
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:21,920
sprites put out of, uh, doc Brown and Marty McFly. Um, but yeah, there was supposed to be, uh, kind

1469
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:27,600
of almost like a Zelda like adventure game, um, for back to the future. Um, yeah, it would have

1470
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:32,160
been cool. And it was based on back to the future too. So that would have been, that would have been

1471
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:37,600
cool. One of my favorite games was Willow on the NES. And that was like a movie game that was kind

1472
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:42,960
of Zelda inspired too. So I love that game. I know a lot of people give it shit, but I love that game.

1473
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:46,880
You know what I like better than that version of Willow, the arcade version,

1474
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:50,960
the arcade version of Willow was very different. Yeah. Dan and I actually watched a playthrough

1475
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:56,160
of that the other day. Um, and we were just talking about how there's these beautiful,

1476
01:32:56,160 --> 01:33:02,960
like full-size portraits of, you know, of the, the characters in the movie, like, and this really

1477
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:09,920
kind of almost disturbing one of Val Kilmer as Badmartigan, but all of that was freaking done in

1478
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:15,120
pixels. Can you imagine if that had been in the nineties, can you imagine if that had been in the

1479
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:19,120
Capcom cabinet too, if I was like it's Strider and Willow, that would have been like double

1480
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:24,240
goddamn it. Right. So, you know, you know, what would be like the perfect, uh, adventure one though

1481
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:30,320
would be like three wonders, Strider and Willow. Ooh. Ooh. I'm sure the Willow, you know, the,

1482
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:36,800
the IP and all that, cause actually isn't Willow getting some sort of, I don't know, reboot or

1483
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:40,800
sequel? Cause that's what every everything is all about now. And I swear there was something about

1484
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:45,760
like Netflix doing a new Willow of some type. Yeah. Yeah. Somebody's doing something there.

1485
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:50,880
And the thing that's getting me pissed off is that Willow already has a sequel.

1486
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:56,640
There were three books that came out. I, I have the books, they're dog-eared and I have read

1487
01:33:56,640 --> 01:34:01,200
the shit out of them. It was, uh, the first one was called Shadow Moon. They were written by,

1488
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:08,320
uh, George Lucas and Chris Claremont of X-Men history. Um, and it was really, really fucking

1489
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:14,400
good series of books. And if that came out as like a Netflix series, I would piss myself.

1490
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:19,200
Thank you. Everyone in chat is clarifying. It's a Disney plus. So, and that would make a lot of

1491
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:24,800
sense because Disney has the Lucas stuff, which I believe this is, was under the banner of Lucas

1492
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:31,520
arts if I'm not, or yeah. Right. Or Lucasfilm, excuse me. Um, yeah. I would sacrifice, I would

1493
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:36,160
give someone else's right arm for it to be based off of the books. Cause the books were amazing.

1494
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:42,880
And if none of you have read those three books, you need to read them. They are amazing. There's

1495
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:48,240
like one of my favorite book trilogies ever. I'll I'll find my, my, my copies are actually

1496
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:53,440
right over in a box behind me. So I'll have to, uh, to find them. But basically in a nutshell of

1497
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:59,280
it, it's sort of like the very beginning of the book is Willow, you know, all wrapped up in his

1498
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:05,840
studies and comes to find out, you know, he goes to like magically visit Allura Dannon on her

1499
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:11,680
birthday and gave her a little protective bear only to find out days later that, um, that Tara

1500
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:18,400
Azleen is destroyed everyone in it, including Mad Martigan and Sorsha. Um, and he sort of goes

1501
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:23,920
down a completely different path and, and then he has to raise Allura Dannon by himself with

1502
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:29,440
the brownies. Well, and Bobby says the series is 30 years after the movie. Sia Tabiri is with you

1503
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:34,320
though, that I wonder if it's based on the novel series. Um, you know what though, if they don't

1504
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:40,640
want to bring back Val Kilmer, that could be a plot. I don't know. I want to get, I get what I

1505
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:45,680
said earlier. Don't ever get your hopes up. Then you won't be disappointed. And, and this is right

1506
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:49,680
at the beginning of the book. So, um, it's not like the biggest of spoilers, but I mean, he does

1507
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:54,240
have an interaction right at the book cause he thinks he's dreaming, but he's talking to Sorsha

1508
01:35:54,240 --> 01:36:00,160
and Mad Martigan and right at the beginning of the, of the thing. But the mo the books are so

1509
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:06,320
good. Like I almost, as much as I love the movie, I cannot separate how much I love those books from

1510
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:11,120
how much I love the movie too. So I really hope that it's based off of, uh, shadow moon and all

1511
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:14,400
of those. Right. Fair enough. Sorry. We got on a Willow tangent, but that's all right. We always

1512
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:19,600
have room for that. It was a great movie. Um, and then, uh, and then there was a canceled, uh,

1513
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:28,080
Capcom generations, um, that these, uh, screenshots have, uh, been, uh, uh, uh, surfaced

1514
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:36,320
and Mike, Oh my God, Chris was involved in okay. Chris Tang, uh, he, um, he was, uh,

1515
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:45,120
leading the team for the development of it. Um, and so, uh, basically, um, it was a, uh,

1516
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:54,480
action game engine, a proprietary action game, uh, engine that, uh, was, it went into a couple

1517
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:58,640
of other failed, uh, pitches that were supposed to go out, but there were different Capcom

1518
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:02,960
characters that were playable, such as mega man and Dante from devil may cry, Yoon from

1519
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:09,200
street fighters, super Joe from bionic commando. And, uh, it was a little bit of a passion project

1520
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:16,240
that never got off the ground, but he's got a playable, uh, uh, prototype apparently. Um,

1521
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:22,720
and hopefully we'll get to see it. I might have to just, you know, go bust out. I wonder if this

1522
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:26,880
has anything to do with that game that Capcom teased at one point that looked like a Capcom

1523
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:30,560
universe type of thing. And like, some people were like, is this like a mega man maker with

1524
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:33,600
like street fighter? Do you remember that? They show like a quick little movie at like some E3

1525
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:37,200
and then it, it vanished. It was canceled. Never heard from again. It was a Capcom universe or

1526
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:43,360
something like that. Uh, I wonder if this was somehow related to that. Oh, just weird.

1527
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:47,120
I don't remember. Yeah. Somebody in chat's got to know what I'm talking about.

1528
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:52,400
I'm not, I, I I'll, I'll be honest. I, I'm actually kind of curious to

1529
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:56,880
just ask him straight up about it. Was it mega man universe? I guess maybe it

1530
01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:02,240
was mega man universe, but this was like a Capcom generations. Yeah. That's what it was called.

1531
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:04,800
Right. Right. But I just remember it because there was some trailer and it had like mega

1532
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:07,920
man and then like the characters from street fighter showed up and it was like, what?

1533
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:14,960
So I just remember that was a big thing. Anyway. All right. All right. Well, less, less fan stuff,

1534
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:19,040
more, uh, reality stuff. What is coming out around the world this week? We're going to

1535
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:23,840
travel around the world and check out some release dates and we'll start with the U S and see if,

1536
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:26,160
see if things are starting to pick back up again with releases.

1537
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:31,200
Um, not a whole lot of stuff coming out, but we've got some pretty big things. So

1538
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:37,200
starting off with hit man three on PC, Nintendo's PlayStation four PlayStation five,

1539
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:44,880
X-Box one X-Box series X and stadia, uh, ride four on PlayStation five and X-Box series that,

1540
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:53,440
and then we have skull, the hero Slayer on PC, and finally bladed fury on Nintendo switch,

1541
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:59,680
PlayStation four and X-Box one. And just to clarify for chat before I get to Japanese

1542
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:04,960
release dates, this was not the mega man cross street fighter. That was a separate thing where

1543
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:08,640
they put like the street fighter bosses into a mega man thing. And that was like a download

1544
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:12,720
thing that Capcom did for some anniversary or I don't know what it was, but that is actually not

1545
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:17,520
the same thing I was thinking about, but the chat does seem to coalesce on. It was mega man universe.

1546
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:22,320
It was like a mega man maker where you could use early Capcom sprites, including like box art,

1547
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:27,360
mega man. Yeah. That was it. That was it clearly a different project than what dark soccer is

1548
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:32,640
referring to, but I couldn't help but see a common thread there. So I was kind of curious if one kind

1549
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:38,320
of influenced the other or what, but they both got canceled, which is a bummer. Let's go to Japan

1550
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:41,520
and check out the releases there, which are picking up again. It's been a few weeks since

1551
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:45,600
we've had some Japanese releases, but now we're back at it on the Nintendo switch this week on

1552
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:51,600
the 21st samurai force Shing and samurai Jack battle through time, both get their releases in

1553
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:56,960
Japan this week. Uh, and then quickly looking at the PlayStation five and the PlayStation four,

1554
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:03,680
um, FIFA, I'm sorry, FIFA 21 is next week. So I guess it's still pretty slow on the five

1555
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:09,440
and on the four this week, we have those same games I mentioned on the switch and that's it.

1556
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:14,160
So it's still a little slow. Things really start to pick back up next week though. So

1557
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:20,400
especially with the new FIFA, uh, dark soccer, how about the UK? Only two. Um, on the 20th,

1558
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:25,360
we have hit man three. And then on the 21st for PlayStation, we have ride four.

1559
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:30,800
All right. All right. We're going to get in some more stories and we'll be getting to your emails

1560
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:35,920
at participate at orange laundry.com a little later, along with your chat influenced, um,

1561
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:40,240
topics and comments when we get into the listener round table, but we have some more stories for

1562
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:46,240
your first starting with Loki. Yeah. So this is pretty cool. So there's a brand new campaign

1563
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:53,840
that's being created for portal two called a portal to desolation. And if you, if you won't

1564
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:58,960
make portal three, we will. Well, the thing is that with valve though, is they they've done this

1565
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:06,320
before. Like there's been other like portal, um, like full game, like full, like total conversions

1566
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:11,440
that have been put out. Um, so this is not anything new, but, um, I mean, it is something

1567
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:18,240
new, but it's been done before. So this is supposed to take place, um, in the eighties

1568
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:25,840
and it features there's star characters called Diana. And it has a brand new like cybernetic

1569
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:32,560
arm system thing that you have almost looks like a Samus's arm cannon, but it's, uh, it has an

1570
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:38,640
integrated, uh, portal device inside of it as well called brace. And it looks pretty cool. They have

1571
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:43,200
like a little teaser trailer out there that shows like one of the first, like, um, kind of one of

1572
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:47,680
the puzzle levels that's in the game. And I really liked the vibe and it kind of reminds me though,

1573
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:52,720
they have like a lot of, uh, you know, uh, the transitions between screens are almost like half

1574
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:59,440
life two or half life, I think actually. So, uh, pretty cool. It's been in development for three

1575
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:04,880
years already. Um, no word yet on what's expected to be out, but I mean, if they're teasing it

1576
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:10,320
maybe relatively soon, maybe it will be a kind of thing where like, if I already own portal too,

1577
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:15,920
then I can like kind of grab this. Yeah. I think what it is, if it's anything like the other,

1578
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:21,680
uh, portal, uh, campaign that they've had out there, you basically have any source engine

1579
01:42:21,680 --> 01:42:27,920
game. You can play this. Oh, interesting. Okay. All right. Well, moving on, let's talk about some

1580
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:32,800
of the other announcements at CES, although some of these weren't really intentional because some

1581
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:38,080
of these got revoked. And what I'm talking about is that Sony actually had a keynote. And in that

1582
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:42,800
keynote, they address some upcoming games for the PlayStation five and kind of detailing what to

1583
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:47,600
look forward to on PlayStation, but was what was interesting is that there were, there was just a

1584
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:53,200
few frames of some text that had some copyright specifics that gave more information as to when

1585
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:59,520
some of these games were coming out. For example, Square Enix's project Aethia coming out January

1586
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:06,320
2022. If you take this splash screen, literally, which again, it was, they went back and they took

1587
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:10,640
it out of the trailer. Uh, they kind of like re-uploaded it or whatever. So they probably

1588
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:14,400
did not want to be married to any of these dates, especially things that are really far out,

1589
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:19,840
especially with the pandemic's future still uncertain, um, and all that. So, uh, I can see

1590
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:22,880
why they went back and changed it, but it was interesting to see some of the things that they

1591
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:28,080
were thinking or that, you know, might be, you know, kind of what to expect, uh, ghost wire,

1592
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:35,280
Tokyo and stray that game with the cats that got her his attention 83, both October of 2021. Again,

1593
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:40,640
if you put all your stock into that screen, hit man three was a part of that presentation and

1594
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:47,760
said January, 2021, which that part was pretty locked in, um, solar ash, June of 2021,

1595
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:55,280
Kena breed bridge of spirits, March of 2021, little devil inside July, 2021 horizon,

1596
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:59,200
forbidden West. They didn't give a month, but they did say late 2021. So,

1597
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:03,520
and that's not too surprising to hear. That's probably Sony's big game for this year.

1598
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:10,480
What I thought was interesting though, pragmata also had a date 2023.

1599
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:17,440
So some of those games you're going to be waiting a little while, but I mean,

1600
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:22,960
that's pretty typical though of Sony. How many years do we wait for like among us or not among

1601
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:31,600
us? Um, okay. Last of us to remember that E3 where like they just owned it. Like they, they

1602
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:37,120
made, they literally made everybody cry because back to back was like final fantasy seven is being

1603
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:43,920
remade. Shenmue three is real. And there was another big one. Oh, the last guardian is coming

1604
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:51,440
back. I think we're all in the same like thing. Um, that, how long did those games actually take

1605
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:57,920
to happen a very long time? And that's, you know, that's Sony's thing and Hey, it works for them.

1606
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:03,280
By the way, if you want to believe rumors and I do believe this one, uh, speaking of the final

1607
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:08,480
fantasy seven remake, there's another rumor going around social media that the PC and PlayStation

1608
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:12,640
five version is coming out later this year. And that would not surprise me one bit. What

1609
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:18,400
surprises me is the Xbox and Microsoft is left out. Um, there must be some interesting reason

1610
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:23,200
for that, but I'm not surprised. I said that on the show, not that long ago. And it doesn't,

1611
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:27,920
it doesn't take a genius to figure that out. That absolutely square is going to rerelease that on

1612
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:32,160
PlayStation five and get its money all over again. Hell yeah. And then of course, a lot of people

1613
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:38,480
are waiting for the PC version so you can mod it. So if you want your nude mods and whatever else,

1614
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:47,040
you know, have at it. There you go. Anyway, uh, let's move on. Let's talk about another

1615
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:51,760
old game, dark soccer. Well, more like other people talking about an old game.

1616
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:58,640
So, um, I don't know how many people, you know, listening like video game documentaries, uh,

1617
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:04,240
we're certainly big fans of them at my house. Yeah. Um, so there's going to be one about NBA

1618
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:14,800
Jam. Um, yeah. And I mean, and it was like, you know, the nineties were the heyday of,

1619
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:22,880
you know, of like the NBA franchise, right? We had space jam. It was all about Michael Jordan.

1620
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:31,360
Um, and so we had NBA Jam and those, those, uh, you know, we had it in my, in my arcade,

1621
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:34,880
you couldn't walk by without hearing a boom shakalaka every so often, you know,

1622
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:40,640
he's on fire. He's on fire. Yeah. I don't talk about sports games a lot, but NBA Jam,

1623
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:45,680
I will tell you that was an incredible sport. That was like probably my second favorite sports

1624
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:52,800
game ever next to sports game. Cause it was unrealistic. So actually, yes. And I mean,

1625
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:57,600
and I remember, you know, finding the, uh, the, the, the different builds of it where you could

1626
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:02,160
play as the mortal combat characters in it and everything. Remember? Yes. Because the NBA wasn't

1627
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:07,680
happy about that. Oh yeah. And you could play us on bill Clinton, who was president when that

1628
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:12,160
came out. And I believe some Republican equivalent was also in it, you know, like,

1629
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:16,880
so you could do political wars and things like that in NBA Jam. I don't think the NBA was happy

1630
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:22,240
about that at all. And that'll probably be in the documentary. Well, the thing is, is that the NBA

1631
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:27,920
almost never gave them the, you know, the, uh, license for it. Um, I mean, they couldn't get

1632
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:34,000
Michael Jordan. He wouldn't let midway use his name or likeness. Um, you know, the licensing

1633
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:40,640
agreement, you know, basically the NBA had a really poor, uh, opinion of arcades in general.

1634
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:45,360
Um, but it turned out to be one of the most successful, uh, uh, video game franchises. I mean,

1635
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:49,840
there are how many different releases came out. Um, did I ever do this as a classic game? I don't

1636
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:54,240
think you did reference. You have to look at the Wiki, I guess, but, um, and it has an arcade one

1637
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:59,840
up cabinet. Yeah. Yep. Cause of course it does. So, but, but even so, I mean, what we're getting

1638
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:04,960
all this kind of love and resurgence back. So I think it's a great time for a documentary about

1639
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:12,720
NBA Jam. Um, I mean, I have the Saturn copy of NBA Jam, the PlayStation ones. We have so many

1640
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:18,800
releases. The Saturn one was kind of the hard one to get ahold of. Um, uh, but I mean, it was,

1641
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:25,680
it was super, super fun. And then, you know, in a twist, the rumor is that, uh, Michael Jordan

1642
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:31,920
actually had a modded copy that put him in the game after all. Huh. Um, that's a rumor,

1643
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:40,000
you know, but Hey, you know, it's on fire. It's going to be, uh, going to be a, uh, a fun thing

1644
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:45,360
to watch. I think I'm really, because I want to just, I want to see more about like those

1645
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:52,240
different builds of the game because I, I played early builds of this when I was in, uh, in high

1646
01:48:52,240 --> 01:49:01,440
school, actually. Um, Zen monkey 11 and chat says the new NBA Jam is NBA 2k street too. You know,

1647
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:07,040
I think that's not NBA Jam. Well, and, and I think they've tried to replicate the success of

1648
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:12,560
the original several times because there was an NBA Jam on the Wii or the 360. Like they tried

1649
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:19,200
to revive it. It was a 360. They've tried to do it several times and nothing really quite had the

1650
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:24,480
fire of the, literally of the first go around. Like that just wasn't the same. And yes,

1651
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:29,280
absolutely. NBA, the street, like I, again, I don't talk a lot about sports games, but I know

1652
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:34,560
enough that those street games are to try to get that more arcade style magic. It's almost like

1653
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:40,240
Forza Horizon versus Forza Motorsport and how Horizon is the more kind of like arcade type

1654
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:45,920
of game. It's, it's kind of like that with the NBA street and the NBA, but, uh, I, nothing is quite

1655
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:51,920
just put that magic in the bottle quite the same. So, but it's also in the eyes of whatever you

1656
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:56,560
like. I'm not saying they're a bad game either. If, uh, you know, it's, it's enough of the magic

1657
01:49:56,560 --> 01:50:01,040
for you and you enjoy it with all the new bells and whistles and stuff go off. Those games are

1658
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:08,320
for you. So it's pretty cool. All right. Um, anyhow, let's move on to another story. I think

1659
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:16,240
Loki you're up. All right. So let's talk a little bit about, uh, more delays. This is not surprising,

1660
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:25,280
really. I mean, we're still aware that COVID is a thing. So when originally, um, Nintendo and

1661
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:30,960
Universal Studios Japan announced that they were going to be opening Super Nintendo World, uh, in

1662
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:37,920
Japan in February 4th, that's not really going to happen because of the state of emergency that it's

1663
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:45,600
been declared in Osaka. So now it's been delayed. They haven't announced a new date yet. They will

1664
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:53,120
once the state of emergency is lifted because of COVID-19. But I mean, this is, it's a pretty

1665
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:57,600
common thing that we're hearing now with different delays, especially when we're talking about

1666
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:02,720
outdoor theme park. Yeah. I wonder if they won't delay the Olympics again. I know they kind of,

1667
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:07,120
the Olympic committee kind of put their foot down and said these Olympics are happening in 2021,

1668
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:13,360
COVID or not. I don't know if I believe it, but then again, by the time we get to June,

1669
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:18,400
you might think, I mean, they might be doing the Olympics in a audience free stadium and they'll

1670
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:23,040
make sure that it could be a very different looking Olympics. Um, and they'll make sure

1671
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:27,680
all the players got vaccinated or whatever, but, uh, it could be interesting. We'll see.

1672
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:32,480
So, I mean, these are still, I mean, I remember in the early days of the pandemic when we thought,

1673
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:35,840
it'll just be a couple of weeks. And then, you know, here we are.

1674
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:39,760
So I would like to point out, I did not think it would be a couple of weeks.

1675
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:44,320
Yeah. Well, I don't like you being right on this one.

1676
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:53,360
Well, me either. So, um, well, let's just fingers and toes crossed that maybe now we're getting

1677
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:59,360
some competent leadership coming in this week that yes, the car will, it's not going to be

1678
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:04,080
automatic. It's not going to be automatic. Well, my wedding anniversaries this week too,

1679
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:10,240
you might remember I got married the day before. Yeah. So our four year anniversaries this week,

1680
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:15,920
uh, uh, Tuesday actually. So yeah, kind of funny how that works. Um, but anyway, yeah, I mean,

1681
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:20,160
obviously the car is not going to turn around immediately, but at least hopefully we will be

1682
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:24,800
on a path. I mean, they're talking about, what was it like a hundred million vaccinations in a

1683
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:31,440
hundred days. Let's hope we'll see. All right. And thank you for the kind words in chat. Appreciate

1684
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:36,560
it. All right. Let's move on to one more story for you guys. And this has to do with the ESA,

1685
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:43,280
uh, which, you know, has, has had some issues in the past couple of years, but, uh, this one is,

1686
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:47,760
is pretty clear, especially with all the recent, you know, uh, things that are going on in the

1687
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:53,200
political world. Uh, the ESA has halted political donations, and this is something that's kind of

1688
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:59,040
happened across the board because, um, what happened at the Capitol, uh, was, was not good.

1689
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:05,520
And I think that's about the simplest way I can put it. And it's having ramifications for a lot

1690
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:11,840
of people. And so the ESA, yes, our industry, the entertainment software association, the group that

1691
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:18,080
puts on E3, uh, they are stopping political donations due to what happened at the Capitol

1692
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:22,960
building and all of the fallout from that saying in a statement, given the events and actions that

1693
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:28,400
led to the violence at the U S Capitol, we are pausing contributions from the ESA PAC,

1694
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:35,120
as we reflect on the tragedy and our path forward. Uh, just so you know, the ESA has donated both to

1695
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:41,920
Democrats and Republicans since 2012, but it is interesting to note it's usually Republicans.

1696
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:47,520
The larger share has gone to that, but that also probably ties into who was leading the

1697
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:54,840
ESA for a long time. I do your own research and come to your own conclusions, I suppose. Um,

1698
01:53:56,400 --> 01:54:03,280
so anyway, um, the ESA, by the way, has, uh, just because they have donated to some, uh,

1699
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:09,120
Republican folks before it doesn't mean that they have always, uh, embraced everything that, uh,

1700
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:15,920
soon to be former president has done. Uh, for example, the ESA in 2018, when our president

1701
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:21,520
decided to call Haiti and African nations, shithole countries, uh, the ESA came out and

1702
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:27,440
said that it was repulsive and that that backward thinking has no place in society.

1703
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:33,200
And that would be one of the cases where the ESA was absolutely correct. Uh, unfortunately they

1704
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:37,920
don't always get it right when it comes to things like how to run E3, but, uh, or the things they

1705
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:43,200
tweet, but you know, you, you take the little victories where you can, I suppose, or as Phoenix

1706
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:48,720
77 26 puts it so eloquent eloquently in chat, took those fuckboys long enough.

1707
01:54:54,240 --> 01:55:00,160
That's why we have a live chat room. All right, let's go to our listener round table,

1708
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:06,640
uh, where you guys can send us emails, participate at orange lounge, radio.com,

1709
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:11,120
or if you want to ask us some questions, don't ask about fuckboys though. If you want to ask us

1710
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:16,640
questions, uh, or what have you in chat twitch.tv slash vog networks, the place to do it. Uh, let's

1711
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:21,520
see, do we, do we have any emails tonight? Nope. So it's drag race talking. So I haven't watched

1712
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:26,560
any of it this season yet. Um, if, Oh, that's where I can talk about drag race again. Okay.

1713
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:30,080
So since you didn't send emails, we get a little bit of drag race talk and all I will say is that

1714
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:36,160
okay. I'm not going to, I w we don't do spoilers here, but I will say you need to watch this most

1715
01:55:36,160 --> 01:55:43,280
recent episode and understand why we all stand to Misha Iman. We stand her there. That is the

1716
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:48,160
only option period because, and I didn't know this until just this past week. Okay. So everybody

1717
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:57,360
knows, and I don't, I don't care if you're gay, straight, bi, pan, eh, any of it, you know,

1718
01:55:57,360 --> 01:56:03,760
that video of the best drag queen entrance of all time, right? Uh, where the it's holding out for

1719
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:09,360
a hero and the drag queen falls from the ceiling into the splits. Y'all know that, right? Yeah.

1720
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:13,680
Right. Everybody knows that one. And, uh, her name was Tandy Iman Dupree, I think was her name.

1721
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:20,480
I'm so sorry if I'm getting it wrong. Um, that is Tamisha Iman's daughter, drag daughter, basically.

1722
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:25,440
Uh, she passed away. If you didn't know that the drag queen in that epic video passed away,

1723
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:30,800
um, a few years ago. Uh, but it's her drag mom is on drag race right now. And she is

1724
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:36,560
all the royalty you would expect her to be. So there's some, yeah, there's some very standable

1725
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:42,800
people on drag race right now. So there's that. All right. Participate at orangesontrader.com.

1726
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:47,120
If you have some emails, um, or I guess you want to email us about drag race. I don't know.

1727
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:51,760
All right. Uh, and I'm looking in chat for questions. We don't have a lot right now,

1728
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:56,160
but, um, in absence of that, I will ask Loki if we have any last minute stories.

1729
01:56:56,480 --> 01:57:03,040
Um, there's one thing, so I was going to mention, there's a free game you can check out on steam

1730
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:10,720
called six seasons in a game. It is basically a paint ball recreation of Greendale community

1731
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:16,240
college from community. And you can play that and play paint ball in there. Perfect. Just like in

1732
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:22,800
the show. So yeah, six seasons in a game, free on steam, uh, dark to see in chat coming up with a

1733
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:28,080
question since drag race came up, came up. Has anyone seen AJ and the queen on Netflix?

1734
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:34,480
Bonus bit of trivia. Roo's roommate apparently plays a prominent role in cyberpunk 2077. Roo

1735
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:40,720
has a husband, not a roommate. He's in cyberpunk. What do they do? They fracking? Well, I don't

1736
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:48,480
know. Anyway. Um, Oh, Oh, Oh, in the show. That's right. Roo did have it. You're right. Okay. Sorry.

1737
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:54,800
I was thinking IRL Roo's roommate in the show. Yes. Um, was like, uh, I remember I did see a

1738
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:58,720
couple episodes of the show, but it was kinda, it was kinda bad. Sorry. It was kinda, it's,

1739
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:05,360
it's like guilty pleasures. It's a guilty pleasure TV, I guess. So, okay. Okay. So the roommate in

1740
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:12,320
the show is in cyberpunk. That makes a lot of sense. So, all right. Uh, Loki, any more last

1741
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:21,280
minute stories? Um, no, that's pretty much it is important things. All right. Well, I guess we're,

1742
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:25,040
we're a little early, but we're at the end of the show. We don't have a lot else to talk about.

1743
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:30,000
January is still a slow month. What can you do? Um, thank you guys so much for listening to our

1744
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:33,680
show tonight. Uh, we appreciate you guys participating along with our show, whether you

1745
01:58:33,680 --> 01:58:37,040
were here with us live on Sunday night, or you were listening throughout the week on our podcast

1746
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:43,520
feed available where great podcasts are found such as Spotify, iTunes, and so forth. Um, you

1747
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:48,240
can leave us a nice review wherever you found this show. We really appreciate those. Or, uh,

1748
01:58:48,240 --> 01:58:53,120
just tell us, tell a friend or two about the show. Um, word of mouth is the best thing we have to

1749
01:58:53,120 --> 01:58:58,240
spread word of the show. So those of you that have spread the word by telling your friends,

1750
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:03,280
we really appreciate that. Um, those of you that do auto hosts a VoG network on your Twitch

1751
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:09,120
accounts, we really appreciate that as well. Um, so yeah, any, all of that stuff we, we super,

1752
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:15,280
super appreciate. Um, and, um, let's see what else. Oh yes. The shop. Uh, if you want to,

1753
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:19,760
uh, help us out, uh, in the monetary sense, you don't have to, but it does go a long way and you

1754
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:25,440
can get some merchandise, vognetwork.com slash shop. If you want to get an OLR t-shirt such

1755
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:30,880
as the one that Loki's wearing tonight or a VoG network shirt or an OLR sticker or a Bobby mug and,

1756
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:34,400
and more to come throughout this year, we'll be adding some more merch to that shop,

1757
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:39,760
vognetwork.com slash shop. All right. I was going to close off the questions,

1758
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:43,520
but since we're a little early, I'll let one more sneak in here after the buzzer,

1759
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:49,680
especially because he paid to highlight it. DJ Rama S says, uh, what are y'all's guilty pleasure

1760
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:56,160
video games? Guilty pleasure games. See, I would consider Final Fantasy 14 one of them,

1761
01:59:56,160 --> 02:00:00,560
even though I think that is a good game. That is like a game I keep going back to,

1762
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:07,200
um, no matter what a guilty pleasure game. Earth Defense Force. I don't feel guilty about

1763
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:14,800
anything I play. I mean, I'm playing all, I'm playing all of my, all of my things that I enjoy

1764
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:22,080
playing. You know, I've got patterned. I have my stupid word game. Wardscapes. I just started

1765
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:28,400
playing that too. I love it. I'm so good at it. That's that. That's the one where you swipe the

1766
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:34,240
letters as in a crossword puzzle. I just got into that this week. I would, I would live for that

1767
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:37,440
playing words with friends too, to the point as like, I'm actually really bored with boards

1768
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:43,760
with friends too. I only like doing those puzzles. And so I've played, I played completely through

1769
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:51,280
a whole other game just like this. I beat, I beat it. And now I'm on, what am I on for this game?

1770
02:00:51,280 --> 02:01:00,160
I'm on level, uh, 1,841 and I just made a 20th place in the current tournament.

1771
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:05,840
So good for you. Yeah. I'm also, I'm also 20th place, but I think it breaks,

1772
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:10,320
breaks you into groups of a hundred or something like that. Yeah, I think it does. Yeah. So,

1773
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:14,880
I mean, but I really, I really enjoy, enjoy this game. I wonder how many levels it has

1774
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:20,320
before I'm done with it, but it was enough that I paid to get no ads. Oh, okay. Nice.

1775
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:25,280
Yeah. I would say a lot of those cell phone games end up being my guilty pleasure games,

1776
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:31,600
you know, cause you know, cell phone gaming isn't real gaming, but it is. Um, and so there's,

1777
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:35,520
there's a lot of, I would say a lot of that stuff falls into the guilty pleasure category for sure,

1778
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:42,720
for me. Um, those word games, uh, thanks to the, um, uh, reality game I was talking about on last

1779
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:46,640
week's show, they got me into a game called stacked or something like that. That's really

1780
02:01:46,720 --> 02:01:51,600
addicting. And it's just a very simple, stupid game. Uh, playing that a lot. So yeah, a lot,

1781
02:01:51,600 --> 02:01:57,280
pretty much anything on my phone is a guilty pleasure game. Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says P cross.

1782
02:01:58,240 --> 02:02:04,720
That's a good one too. I may throw out, um, uh, maybe hot to full boyfriend just because I fucking

1783
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:10,240
love that game. I love how to full boyfriend. Sometimes the game is so ridiculous. It's still

1784
02:02:10,240 --> 02:02:17,520
pretty good. Yeah. Well, I mean, and it goes there. It goes dark. So yeah, I would say mortal

1785
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:22,960
combat is in that category. I'm not as big on the newer ones, but the older ones to me are kind of

1786
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:28,320
guilty pleasure games like mortal combat two specifically, I think is a guilty pleasure game

1787
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:33,600
for me. There you go. Rama. See, don't say I don't love you. I let you squeeze in the last minute

1788
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:37,760
question there. All right. Uh, now we're going to go through the motions of wrapping everything up.

1789
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:41,600
Thank you again for listening to the show. I won't repeat everything I said before. Um,

1790
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:45,600
but, uh, thank you again to everybody who's listening, whether it be, uh, live or on the

1791
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:50,720
podcast feed, we really appreciate your support. Um, we'll be here next week to do it all over

1792
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:58,240
again. Um, I hope everybody has a great week, happy gaming, um, and, uh, stay safe, stay, uh,

1793
02:02:58,240 --> 02:03:02,960
far away from any place where you could potentially catch COVID and maybe we will get to the other

1794
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:07,520
side of this after all. Um, so let's go around and get final thoughts. Uh, Loki,

1795
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:12,160
I'm gonna start with you at your final thought tonight. Um, just have to work more of my games

1796
02:03:12,720 --> 02:03:19,600
and also, uh, still want to stream some more Minecraft. Yeah. Uh, and my final thought is

1797
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:24,800
I will really push myself to do a stream this week. That is not final fantasy. I'll probably

1798
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:29,840
stream that too, but I want to do like DJ max. I keep saying I want to do a Tetris effect stream.

1799
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:34,320
Now that we're getting these pixel poops codes, I'm asking why, why are, can we stream this or

1800
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:39,840
do you want me to wait? So I'm hoping to stream something, uh, this week that isn't just final

1801
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:47,120
fantasy. So there's that last but not least dark soccer. Um, please look at the pinned post on my,

1802
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:54,160
uh, Twitter it's at dark Sakura. Um, I have a go fund me for a long time friend of the show and one

1803
02:03:54,160 --> 02:04:01,200
of my longtime friends. Um, and the only person who has donated since I put out that call is

1804
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:06,960
someone who doesn't even listen to the show. So anything, if you want me to pick a game

1805
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:14,720
and I'm going to extend this, you know, another, another week for, for donations, but, um, $10

1806
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:24,400
as a vote, $50 gets you, uh, uh, I'm going to put it this way. Uh, if you do, uh, $10 is a vote,

1807
02:04:25,120 --> 02:04:31,120
$50 would be a hundred votes and $500 will be an instant game choice as long as I own it.

1808
02:04:32,320 --> 02:04:39,360
So, um, I'll, I'll put it in the chat room and, um, but it's, it's in one of the pinned,

1809
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:46,400
uh, post on my, on my wall. All right. Well, with that, we hope you guys all have a good week.
