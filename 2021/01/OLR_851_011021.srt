1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,360
I'm a big fan of making something good out of a bad thing.

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,800
And in the spirit of popularity, diversity, meaning and frequency of use, Twitch is going

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,000
to rotate PogChamp emotes once every 24 hours.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,800
This feature doesn't have to last forever, but it's going to be a good change-up of

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,800
the formula.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,920
And hey, it'll be a lot better than those astroturfed Prime emotes they gave us after

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,160
TwitchCon.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,160
This is just my hot take.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,840
It's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to explain more on this

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,160
and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where every gamer has

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,160
a voice.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:43,560
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back.

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:49,640
It's another week of Orange Lounge Radio, live once again on this Sunday night for the

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:56,520
second time in the year 2021, with episode number 851 of our show for this January the

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,360
10th of 2021.

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:04,320
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,760
Hi, Jamie, I think you're muted on Discord, just so you know.

18
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
Technical issues.

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,760
They happen.

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,760
I thought I had myself unmuted.

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,760
I guess I must have hit something.

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
That's all right.

23
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
Hi.

24
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,760
Hi.

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,760
How are you?

26
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,760
Okay.

27
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,100
You were telling me before the show, and I hope you're willing to talk about it on air,

28
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,680
you made a new friend on Twitter in the gaming universe, right?

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,920
I did.

30
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,520
And I've been following him for a while, and actually just having a little bit of back

31
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,520
and forth chat.

32
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,800
We talked about mics for a little bit, kind of what led to me, I think, buying the one

33
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,800
that I did.

34
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,800
Oh, nice.

35
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:43,040
But Tommy Earl Jenkins, who is the voice of Die Hard Man, really, really just cool dude.

36
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,000
In the game Death Stranding, for those who don't know.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,560
Yeah, in Death Stranding, sorry.

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,760
But I've tried to check out some of his other stuff.

39
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,600
He's honestly, I think, one of my favorite voices in the game as well.

40
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,000
But I like when I get to connect with people like that and just talk shop, I guess, sometimes,

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,640
and just talk about real life and do real people stuff.

42
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,240
It's kind of a thing.

43
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,800
I don't get super starstruck, I guess.

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,660
Yeah, me neither.

45
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,200
But I like getting to know people.

46
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,300
I totally get it.

47
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,440
It's the pros and the cons about Twitter, is that it makes celebrity culture and some

48
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,720
of those people that you admire and even people that aren't necessarily gigantic celebrities,

49
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,400
which with all due respect, I would put the voice actors on that level where they're not

50
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:38,240
like Tom Cruise or a huge movie star or whatever, but they're known in certain circles or contestants

51
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,240
on Drag Race.

52
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,240
They're known in certain circles.

53
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,840
So they get a lot of people able to tweet them directly, which is a good thing and it's

54
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,840
a bad thing.

55
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,760
Obviously, we know there's a lot of disgusting Twitter culture that happens with that direct

56
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,200
accessibility such as people who bully other people and tag things and things that are

57
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,160
completely unnecessary.

58
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,560
But I think as Twitter and those types of services, Facebook, social media, is getting

59
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,000
more ingrained in our culture, people are getting more like, okay, I'm just going to

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
block haters.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,700
I'm going to mute haters and able to filter that out a little bit, yes, a little better.

62
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,180
Not that it ever excuses that type of behavior, but I think people are learning how to deal

63
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,680
with it a little more.

64
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,200
But the plus side of that, we talk a lot about the negative side of that, and I know Twitter

65
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,720
and all that is a hot button issue this week, and I'm going to try to walk around that.

66
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,740
But I think part of the positives about Twitter is that for those people in very smaller circles

67
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,180
that might not be known to a lot of people, to tweet somebody a small little compliment

68
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,940
like, hey, I loved your work, I'm curious, what kind of microphone do you use?

69
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,280
That is awesome that you can just go to the source and ask that question.

70
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,360
One thing to keep in mind, nobody owes you shit and you might not get an answer.

71
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,380
You know this, Dark Saga, but I'm saying this for everybody else.

72
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,640
You might not get an answer from somebody, but when you do, it feels really good and

73
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,200
it's really cool, right?

74
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,360
And over the years, many of you, I know we hear it a lot, we're not famous.

75
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,900
We do the show a long time, doesn't mean people know who we are.

76
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,220
We're known to certain people in certain groups, right?

77
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,300
It's that same type of thing.

78
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:18,320
When you guys reach out and tweet me or Jamie or Matt or whatever, and say, this is awesome,

79
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,800
or hey, thanks for doing OLR.

80
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:25,120
In fact, somebody sent me a tweet this past week just saying, oh man, when you were talking

81
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,180
about the Guardian legend, I so agree with you, that game needs to come back, something

82
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,180
along those lines.

83
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,960
I was kind of talking about that.

84
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,280
Even though that makes me feel really good and validates what we're doing here at OLR

85
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,880
to have a pleasant exchange like that.

86
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,500
I live for that shit.

87
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:47,880
When you ask, how have you done OLR for 18 years, however old we are, 18 years, interactions

88
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,140
like that, just people wanting to talk cool about video games and keep that going, that's

89
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,140
my feel.

90
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,140
So it's...

91
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,140
I'd like more of that.

92
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,140
Yeah.

93
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,140
Oh yeah, of course.

94
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:03,180
We have to remember, we're not that big, but I love for the audience that we do have and

95
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,380
the interactions that we have.

96
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:09,780
So that I'm sure applies to the voice actors that you've interacted with over the years

97
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,740
on Twitter, for sure.

98
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:20,300
And I've actually made some really good friends just running in some of those same circles.

99
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,060
For me, honestly, I've actually found it to be a lot less toxic of an environment lately,

100
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,200
especially since the...

101
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,200
We all know.

102
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,620
Undesirable population have been...

103
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,620
We all know.

104
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,620
Yes.

105
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,060
But I've also found...

106
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,860
And I don't know what this is exactly, because people are posting this stuff.

107
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:54,580
Doomscrolling is a thing, it exists for a reason, the phrase, but I've noticed that

108
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:02,160
it's a little bit more inundating on Facebook because people...

109
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,000
It's in a compartmentalized area, I guess, if that makes sense.

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,160
And people are more just likely to make a bunch of comments on it, whereas on Twitter,

111
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,340
I think it's kind of harder to see some of the comments.

112
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:25,920
And you can mute the thread, and now you can remove...

113
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,400
When people reply to it, you can ask them to remove you from it.

114
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
Yes.

115
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,960
Finally have that limiting who can reply feature.

116
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,320
Well, I don't know if Bobby Blackwolf ever did get it.

117
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,760
He might be the one person on Twitter without it, which sucks, sorry, Bobby.

118
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,220
But I think everybody on Twitter, other than Bobby, has this feature where you can limit

119
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,480
to certain replies, and that's a great thing too, I think.

120
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,280
Because sometimes I wanna post something and be like, I'm just gonna say this, get this

121
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,200
out in the universe, get it out of my brain.

122
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,920
I don't wanna talk about it after this.

123
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,960
And it took way too long to come to Twitter, and I'm happy it's there.

124
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,740
Aw, Bobby still doesn't have that feature.

125
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,300
I don't know what's wrong, bro.

126
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,140
I haven't even looked for it.

127
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,140
It's there.

128
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,140
Maybe you don't have it either.

129
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,140
That would be strange.

130
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,140
Oh, I see it.

131
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,140
I have it.

132
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,140
So yeah, you can...

133
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,020
People you follow, only people you mention, everyone.

134
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,020
It's great.

135
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,340
So anyway, we gotta introduce everybody here on the show that our folks out there like

136
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,380
to follow, and that includes Techmaster Loki joining us tonight.

137
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,380
Hello.

138
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,380
Hi, Loki.

139
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,380
How are you?

140
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,380
I'm doing okay.

141
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,380
Good, good.

142
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,540
What's the game playing behind you tonight?

143
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,960
I can't quite tell.

144
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
Is that Zelda?

145
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,500
You don't recognize it from AGDQ?

146
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
I'm trying to...

147
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,620
No, I can't, because I can't see the main character in it, because you're sitting in

148
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,620
front of him.

149
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,620
Your head's in the way.

150
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,620
Yeah, your head's in the way.

151
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,620
I can't tell.

152
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,620
What did it...

153
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,620
Just tell me.

154
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,620
Is that I Wanna Be The Guy or something?

155
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,660
It's Epic Dumpster Bear 2.

156
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,980
Oh, it sure is.

157
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,980
Okay, okay.

158
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,980
I admittedly tuned out right before that run started.

159
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,980
But nothing.

160
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,980
I loved AGDQ, but just trying to live my life too.

161
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,820
So yeah, okay, I got it, got it.

162
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,200
Speaking of awful games, but with a wink, how is development of Pixel Poops number two,

163
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
your game going?

164
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,260
It was kind of slow this week.

165
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,900
I did work on some animation stuff, so I was drawing a dog.

166
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,460
Yeah, and you know what?

167
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,900
Now that I'm asking you this, I know we talked about this on Twitter where it's kind of one

168
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,900
of those...

169
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,180
We all had a lot on our minds this week, so I think we all were a little slower this week,

170
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,180
and that's fine.

171
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:31,860
Yeah, it was hard to get motivated to do more intensive stuff like that, so I played a lot

172
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,860
of Minecraft instead, literally doing just chores.

173
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:43,460
It's like, oh, I gotta go fix this path so it looks nicer, or, oh, hey, we're low on

174
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,460
these supplies.

175
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,380
I'm gonna go mine for a while.

176
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,040
Just stupid stuff like that.

177
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,500
I think everybody had to do what they needed to do for their mental health, and admittedly,

178
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,500
I did not watch the entirety of Bobby's hosting run on Wednesday because I could not tear

179
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
myself away from the news.

180
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,740
I just physically could not do it, which probably wasn't the greatest thing for my mental health,

181
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,420
admittedly, but it is what it is.

182
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,620
You put Twitch up on the TV using one of your consoles and take out the iPad.

183
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,900
I know, but I'm so bad at multitasking.

184
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,900
Normal people can do that.

185
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,900
I can't.

186
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,900
I don't know what it is.

187
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:20,220
Let's not have you ever test out any more iterations of that for YYR.

188
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,220
Right?

189
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:27,260
Yeah, I'm not very good at doing pixel art, so it was surprising.

190
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:33,260
It was very challenging just to get a four frame walk animation with a dog into such

191
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:39,700
a small sprite, and it ended up turning out okay.

192
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,120
So anyway, but yeah, I was gonna mention it later in the show, but hell, I'll do it now.

193
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,340
Big congratulations to Bobby Blackwell and the entire crew.

194
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,400
It's much more than one person, but obviously we're partial to our buddy who we've been

195
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,900
working with here on Sunday nights for what, like 15 years, probably more.

196
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,580
I literally have so long I've lost track and helping with the hosting and helping to raise

197
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,940
money for a great charity.

198
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,900
I have a story on it later in the show, so you're gonna hear it twice, but I think it

199
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:10,300
was something like 2.7 million they raised for prevent cancer foundation via AGDQ.

200
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,780
And the fact that everything is virtual and the fact that they had to compete with all

201
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,980
the crap going on in the world is pretty stunning.

202
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:23,380
So big ups to the speedrunners, the hosts, the producers, the behind the seniors, everybody

203
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,900
and everyone that made that happen, because it was a beautiful charity thing.

204
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,300
So congrats, that's for sure.

205
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,340
Anyhow, let's get into our show and the things we want to talk about tonight.

206
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,180
So it's a little bit slower of a news week.

207
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,260
We do have some things to get into, but obviously coming off of the holidays, there's not a

208
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,220
lot of big game releases.

209
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,180
The hype machine hasn't started for 2021 just yet.

210
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,620
Consumer electronics show is coming up this week, albeit very, very different because

211
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,340
of the world, I'm sure you all know.

212
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:00,700
But CES would be about the first point where we start to get some actual gaming, big gaming

213
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,740
ticket items.

214
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,820
So it's still a little slower this week.

215
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,020
So this, and we'll get into what news there is coming up a little bit, but this is a good

216
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,900
time for us to continue to kind of reflect not just on the last year, which we did last

217
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,500
week, but what's ahead, which is what we're going to do this week.

218
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,220
So we have to do this virtually tonight because usually what we would do is Dark Soccer, Loki

219
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:25,540
and myself would write on some little scraps of paper and we would fill up Mr. Vader here

220
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,540
for the podcast listeners.

221
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,660
I'm holding up a little tin that looks like Darth Vader, but it's more cylindrical.

222
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,660
And we're going to lock him in this little time capsule and we're going to read him at

223
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,560
the start of next year and laugh at how bad our predictions were.

224
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,840
And I think I left the one about Half-Life 3 in here just because that's going to be

225
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,200
in there every year I've decided.

226
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,280
All right, until the end of time.

227
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,280
In fact, honestly, bury me with this so somebody can find the sliver of paper in a thousand

228
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,760
years that says, did Half-Life 3 ever fucking happen?

229
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,260
All right, moving on.

230
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,260
Let's get into some...

231
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,260
Rob.

232
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,260
What?

233
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,800
If it ever does come out, then we need to have a ritual burning.

234
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,320
Oh, of the paper?

235
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,320
Of the paper.

236
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
I'm down with that.

237
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,000
Let's bring a little fire to Orange Launch Radio.

238
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That sounds safe.

239
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
All right.

240
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,520
We're chanting to the tune of an ABBA song.

241
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,680
All right.

242
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,560
Burning things to the songs of ABBA.

243
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,480
That sounds like a segment on Understation Live or something, but anyway, let's get into

244
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,480
2021 predictions.

245
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,560
So we're going to do this virtually this year.

246
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,120
I'm going to just kind of know everything down.

247
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,120
I'll print it out.

248
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,580
We'll put it in there for next year and we'll do it that way.

249
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,820
So I'm going to go around and see some of the host predictions for this year.

250
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,380
And then we're going to go to chat and get some of yours because we do tape live over

251
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,620
at twitch.tv slash vog network, the voice geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network

252
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,660
every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby

253
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,860
Black Wolf show.

254
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,900
So let's get into some predictions.

255
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,260
All right.

256
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,460
I will start.

257
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,460
I'll do my first.

258
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:59,220
I never go first in these segments, so it's time for me to go first.

259
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,060
And I'm going to do this one first because I knew I wanted to say this as a prediction

260
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:08,740
and then some, some leaks came out today that are going to make it look like I'm leaning

261
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,740
into this.

262
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,740
So you guys are going to have to trust me that I was thinking of this before the leaks.

263
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,740
Okay.

264
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,460
And I don't think the leaks are necessarily true.

265
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,900
I'm going to explain how my predictions a little bit different.

266
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,980
I want to talk about switch pro.

267
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,220
Okay.

268
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:27,200
My prediction, my prediction that I'm writing in is that Nintendo switch pro ain't all that.

269
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,560
Now it doesn't mean it's going to be bad, but it's not going to do 4k handheld gaming.

270
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,600
And I don't really think it's going to do like, like, I think it will support 4k and

271
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,400
the way that PlayStation pro supported 4k, but I don't think it's going to be more powerful

272
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,240
really than it certainly is not going to be as powerful as PlayStation five or Xbox series

273
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,380
X, a hundred percent.

274
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,800
It'll probably upscale that.

275
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
I think either.

276
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Yeah.

277
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,720
And I know the leak talked about upscaling, which honestly hadn't come to my mind, but

278
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,200
I was thinking like interface menus, statics, things like that would probably be 4k, but

279
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,880
I don't think the games themselves are going to be as 4k as you want.

280
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,200
It doesn't make the games worse.

281
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,520
Nintendo still makes great games.

282
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,640
I'm just saying, I think a lot of the pipe dream people have in their heads about 4k

283
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,600
breath of the wild part two, I don't think that is going to be a reality, but I do think

284
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,720
we will get a switch pro holiday.

285
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,660
I don't think it's coming any sooner than a holiday.

286
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,300
And I think they're going to do it that way to time it with breath of the wild part two

287
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,300
is one of the release titles for it.

288
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,420
So that's my first prediction for 2021 for sure.

289
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,020
So all right.

290
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:36,260
And looking in chat, act def says you're stealing one of my cohost predictions that the switch

291
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,940
pro ain't pro and more like a 1.3 version of the console.

292
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,020
You know, again, with the leaks today, I think a lot of people are going to be leaning into

293
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,760
that a little bit, but it's more of those things that the leaks make sense, I think.

294
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,860
So I'm kind of piggybacking on it.

295
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:55,420
I don't necessarily know if I buy the up sample everywhere part of that.

296
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:00,500
Like I kind of think that's why I'm not totally leaning into those leaks, but I think elements

297
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
of it are right.

298
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,500
So, all right, anyhow, let's talk to dark soccer.

299
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,500
Why not?

300
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
What's what's up?

301
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Did I really?

302
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Yes, you did.

303
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,500
I, you stole mine.

304
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,640
That's exactly what I was going to do.

305
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,640
I'm sorry.

306
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,640
So no, you're not.

307
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,640
You're right.

308
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,640
I'm not.

309
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,640
Well, what's your other?

310
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,420
What's the next one on your list then?

311
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:29,440
Well, I said that some kind soul is going to make me a game featuring possums.

312
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,480
Did dark soccer get a possum game?

313
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,640
Yeah, I need a game with possums.

314
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,120
In 16 bit fashion.

315
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,120
Now so much.

316
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,700
Sorry, I'm quiet, but I'm typing these out as as they're being sick because I have no

317
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,060
advanced knowledge of what these predictions are.

318
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,820
Now, what about the old adage?

319
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,920
If you want something bad enough, you got to do it yourself ain't doing shit.

320
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,920
This is a prediction.

321
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,540
So I'm predicting that somebody is going to be really nice to me and do me a possum adventure

322
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,540
or possum platformer.

323
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,980
It isn't like rocket night adventure.

324
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,040
It's a possum on four legs doing possum things like you have to find trash.

325
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
I like that.

326
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,040
And you make friends.

327
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,580
Possum things.

328
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,180
Do something awesome today.

329
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,360
And he has to make friends.

330
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,320
My possum has to make make friends.

331
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,600
He has to have a mama possum who has lots of babies.

332
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,440
And then has to make friends with a raccoon who is literally named trash panda.

333
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,160
And a skunk.

334
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,240
And it's gonna be an active just named it's gonna be called be possum today.

335
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,240
I just said that.

336
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,480
That's what you're saying I take the name is called be possum today.

337
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
Okay.

338
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,600
Someone has a yeah and like for Norris says he has to eat ticks for energy.

339
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,200
Kate catastrophe and Chad says awesome possum kicks Dr. Machino's butt.

340
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,400
That's actually I think like a real thing is it really yeah it's awesome possum that's

341
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,240
what I'm like trying not to be I want it to be a little four legged possum that jumps

342
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:09,740
up and platforms and has to find garbage and scream at people it's power to stuns its enemies

343
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,360
by screaming at it you want a literal garbage video game.

344
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:19,640
I want a garbage video game starring a possum okay and if someone will make it for me I

345
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,040
will write the entire story for it I just need I need I need this I need this to be

346
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:32,620
my game of 2021 well you could do it like like epic dumpster or after epic dumpster

347
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:38,360
bear does it's all unity assets I don't like that kind of game though I want it to be like

348
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:45,840
a like a like a Sonic ish kind of game you know jumping on platforms and climbing things

349
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,340
and not like doing the midair spins and stuff like that I just want I just want to jump

350
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:57,080
around and eat garbage now since dark Sakura has availability on her list because I ruthlessly

351
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,940
stole one of her answers without knowing it chat if you have some predictions why don't

352
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,980
you start yelling them out in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog networks that dark

353
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:13,760
soccer can steal one of your answers sound like a plan all right I love her she'll come

354
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,800
up with something else I want him to go fast I want him to walk really funny hey moving

355
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,960
on we got three hours show we're not going to talk about possums for two hours two and

356
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:31,480
a half hours all right speaking yeah speaking of going fast okay Microsoft is going to quickly

357
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:40,940
acquire Sega in 2021 okay this fan wank rumors been going around for like four years why

358
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:47,740
why and how low key to it even more because they got to figure out how to get in on the

359
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:57,900
Japanese side of the house and honestly they're not gonna purchase Konami so say it is okay

360
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:03,520
good prediction my next prediction I wanted to throw something in for the Intellivision

361
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:09,220
amico because I think a lot of people are going to overlook that this year and my prediction

362
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:13,520
for 2021 would have been one of my predictions oh my bad well you maybe maybe yours will

363
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,760
be different because that it would be overlooked oh well no no that's actually not the prediction

364
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:24,760
my prediction is a little bit opposite I'm gonna say the amico will do okay it's certainly

365
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,960
gonna have better success than the VCS but I don't think and I'm willing to say this

366
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:35,540
I don't think it's gonna tank as hard as a lot of internet people want to think it will

367
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:40,700
I think the amico will do okay and what I mean by that is that like it's not gonna be

368
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:46,840
like oodles and oodles of cash but it will it will break even enough to pay everybody

369
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,260
salaries that worked on it and a little little extra chunk of change for a future project

370
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:55,520
and it's gonna do it's good it's gonna be all right and that's that's my guess for amico

371
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,660
but I think it will survive I think it will be supported through all of 2021 I think they

372
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,220
will I think with the April release they will continue to push it more and more through

373
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,060
the holidays and I think it's something that won't be able to be gauged on its release

374
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:11,060
right out the gate I think this is truly something we have to evaluate at the beginning of next

375
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,600
year when it's been on the shelf through a holiday period that hopefully looks a little

376
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:20,280
more like a normal holiday period than this last year did so so I'm sensing a theme with

377
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:27,000
Robin and 2021 it's just gonna be okay it's not gonna be great you know I'll be terrible

378
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,180
just okay around Wednesday I was like this is gonna be another shitty year and then on

379
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:41,040
Friday I was like actually 2021 showed up today and said I think the fuck not so anything

380
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:49,380
I 2021 anything can happen 20 roller coaster and it just been like a week 2021 it might

381
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:55,720
be kind of possum speaking of which dark Sakura do you have another prediction for

382
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:03,560
the can a serious one sure so even though my possum one was very very serious I'm not

383
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:11,620
joking about it I think that we're going to see online communities move off of things

384
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:18,000
like just standard internet and smartphone platforms maybe not a move but we're gonna

385
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:27,420
see the new big social media network be in-game networks where I like where you're going with

386
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:32,940
this gone you can so you can be involved in it kind of like have like think of PSO for

387
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,820
a moment right mm-hmm imagine that you were in your lobby and PSO and you chat with people

388
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,380
in the lobby and you can then chat with your group while you're in your game right you're

389
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:47,820
like even in Wow but you also have an observer mode where you can join in on other people's

390
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:54,200
games as an observer and and follow cam with like one of the characters who you know one

391
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:59,600
of the people that someone's playing okay sorry sorry I don't mean interrupts but something

392
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,540
that comes to mind because it I'm not saying it exists but it's bubbling under the surface

393
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,320
because I've heard about this and so maybe this is the type of year that it comes through

394
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,720
there's a thing called clubhouse and you can only get in with an invite right now so I

395
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,280
don't know a lot about it and I know Twitter is trying to launch competitor to it but it's

396
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,260
like these audio chat rooms that are set up for people to discuss certain topics and they

397
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:26,140
might be serious like social things that need to be discussed like you know being black

398
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:30,460
in America might be one of these rooms and you you can draw and with dark soccer when

399
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,380
you talk about eavesdrop you don't necessarily have to participate you can eavesdrop in other

400
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:38,100
conversations like that's the type of thing that clubhouse and the new potential Twitter

401
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,980
feature is supposed to allow you to do now again these haven't really taken off yet they're

402
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,080
still kind of because I think the big question still has to be answered how do we moderate

403
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,220
this because this could be a nightmare in in trade but you're kind of taking this one

404
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:57,000
step further into games and I think that's kind of cool exactly and it basically also

405
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:07,340
will go into the realm of things like say eSports for example like you can sell tickets

406
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:13,640
to an event and you all sign it kind of like actually how stage it does their things where

407
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:23,040
you not necessarily like a bid but you I'm trying to think of how to phrase this like

408
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:27,240
you know you do like you pay for however much the minimum is for your ticket you can tip

409
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:32,620
more if you want to and then you can attend a virtual concert inside a game environment

410
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:37,300
or it takes to like a live stream of something but it's all done through our various game

411
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:43,600
gaming consoles and I think that one of the selling points for future consoles is that

412
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,340
this would be an integrated thing that all of them use for cross console watching and

413
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:54,200
for a lot of you know like say if you're on a PlayStation and you go to watch somebody's

414
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:00,920
game on an Xbox for example do you of course will get ads or you might have to have like

415
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:07,320
pay for an extra tier of account for cross-platform gaming in a cross-platform chat or something

416
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:16,200
in a small way you're almost describing PlayStation home but like 2.0 like next like evolution

417
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,400
type of thing I get where you're going because I think I actually like the more you explain

418
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,740
your idea the more I'm kind of like I get it because there's a lot again a lot of things

419
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,800
bubbling under the surface you talk about the virtual concerts Fortnite has put its

420
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,020
foot in the water and dealing with those we just haven't seen something like that gel

421
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:41,940
together where it's like Fortnite is known as the virtual concert space like it hasn't

422
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,700
gelled together in a big way yet and I think if I'm hearing right you're saying this is

423
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:52,900
the year it comes together in a big way for some tech company or even you know extended

424
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:59,500
into like a you know like an internet thing where you can you know live stream whatever

425
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,100
the game people are on or you have it through steam when you can join in on your game that

426
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:11,660
way too but I'm thinking of making it something that's just beyond just an online social media

427
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:16,240
thing and have it be an integrated network and then you know now I think like future

428
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,340
down the line where you like plug into this thing like the fucking matrix and live in

429
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,940
it I guess or you know I don't know that would be that would be a little bit crazy

430
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:31,700
but it's just sort of where I'm going for certain things I guess I want to think of

431
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:43,180
something that's going to have longevity and it's hard for me to describe exactly that

432
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:49,380
but I want it to be something that would go forward yeah no I get it I think it's a great

433
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,340
addiction let's let's write it down see what happens maybe if we don't see something fully

434
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,320
realized we might see though you know kind of kind of check in on how are some of these

435
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,800
things growing that I'm saying or like you know they're kind of bubbling under yet and

436
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,320
I know chat I'm looking at you know Bobby Black Wolf is saying VR chat alt space VR

437
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,120
big screen I'll do these kinds of things but you don't need VR to use them yes but and

438
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:15,600
so does Fortnite but none of these places are like the definitive you know spot for

439
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,040
this type of stuff nothing's quite gelled together in that sort of way yet and I think

440
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,660
especially coming off of this pandemic and I talked about some of this on last week show

441
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:30,560
how my work is looking at moving into a an environment very very similar to those types

442
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,160
of things I'm not going to get too detailed because I it would be wrong of me to give

443
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:40,000
all the details but it's like a similar thing and I think I think that could evolve into

444
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,800
some type of like known as a social media platform for all of that and I and a wider

445
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,840
adoption of one of those or maybe a couple of those things so it'd be interesting to

446
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,400
see for sure one of my other thoughts is actually expanding something like this into a business

447
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:00,800
environment as well because you know zoom by itself is one thing but if you have like

448
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:08,540
a virtual meeting room you know you and I need to talk off air okay it's it's it is

449
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:17,380
out there I can tell you so yeah but again how widely adopted yeah how why everybody

450
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:21,840
knows zoom not everybody knows these other things yet this might be the year we find

451
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:28,340
out anyway for time let me go ahead and move on Loki what is your next prediction my next

452
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:33,020
prediction is that volition is going to announce the next Saints Row game I know it's being

453
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:39,400
worked on they just have to announce it safe prediction but a good one it's about that

454
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:44,620
time right yeah exactly well they've already committed or I've already commented that they're

455
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:50,960
working on one just you know what is it when is it you know yeah so you're saying this

456
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,500
year is the year for Saints Row beyond a tweet saying yeah we're doing it months yes obviously

457
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,220
I don't anticipate they'll come out this year all right I would like you never know you

458
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:06,220
never know you never know all right my last prediction so here's my real crazy one I've

459
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:11,220
always got to have a crazy one in there so my last prediction that I have is twitch is

460
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:17,300
going to get another viable competitor because I think you know twitch is kind of not gone

461
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:23,620
very checked by a lot of you know yes there's YouTube YouTube doesn't lie to monetize as

462
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:30,980
easily as twitch does and some of these others and I'm gonna go so far as to say I think

463
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:38,660
the shot is gonna come from Twitter I think Twitter is going to launch a twitch competitor

464
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:43,500
and I think because we know they have the technology from their acquisition of periscope

465
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:49,460
I'm not sure that has really leveraged a lot for them but I don't know it's just it's just

466
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:54,420
what my gut says so I'm gonna go with it I feel like twitch might be the ones or excuse me Twitter

467
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:59,820
might be the ones to take a shot at what twitch has going on and we're not gonna talk about

468
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:07,620
Facebook gaming we don't validate it all right let's dark soccer were you able to find a third

469
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:19,300
one I think that we're going to see gaming in and of itself become and this is gonna be a

470
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:28,460
very safe bet but I think we're even gonna see it perhaps surpassing professional sports as a big

471
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:36,540
moneymaker in the US economy it might already be there I I don't think it's coming that way that's

472
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,180
why I said this one's pretty much safe you're right this is a safe bet game mostly this year

473
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:45,860
games will continue to make money and a lot of it but you know what you know what this is an

474
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:52,340
industry that has always assumed a safe path and it hasn't always worked out that way 1983 called

475
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:59,940
and said hello right so and I want to say there's been prior years where maybe not us but other

476
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,380
shows I've listened to has gone so far as to say there's gonna be another video game crash this

477
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:10,100
year so you're doing the opposite of that you're saying gaming's in a safe place we're gonna

478
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:15,420
continue to make money we're gonna it's it's gonna continue to be mainstream and it's gonna

479
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:19,260
get to the point where because and you know you talk about sports and I think especially with

480
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:24,020
the pandemic and everything going on where more people can't go watch sports now again we hope

481
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:32,140
that at the end of 2021 it's not like this anymore or it's it's on that path to what we remember but

482
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:39,260
I I get it I I think yeah I think I think yes it's a safe pick but I don't think it's a complete

483
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:47,420
100% guarantee go ahead it's not necessarily just going to be the fact that it's going to be these

484
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:51,980
big and I'm on purpose not looking at chat by the way so if anyone say anything about it I don't see

485
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:58,180
it not really I think I think that what we're even going to see is we're going to see the breakup of

486
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:06,260
some of the bigger studios into like kind of how we were seeing in real life how some of the big

487
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:13,260
stores are failing in response to the boutique the rise of the boutique again I think we're gonna

488
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:19,100
start huh sorry I was finish your thought because and I have to read a chat comment because you are

489
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,580
on the exact same page as someone else in chat and I'll read that here in a minute but I think

490
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:28,780
that people are going to realize that with these smaller studios that they're getting even better

491
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:34,220
quality because it's not just oh we got to make all this money blah blah blah they're gonna be

492
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:38,940
doing it with crowdsource with a lot more crowdsource backing and when these little

493
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:43,220
studios grow they're gonna employ more people they're gonna put more money into the economy

494
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:49,860
we're really going to see the growth of true competition and have it not just big be you know

495
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:54,820
the the first title Nintendo's economies the Capcom's you know it's there they're already

496
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:59,020
losing their traction so I mean Nintendo is always going to be Nintendo they live in their

497
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:06,940
own universe and they don't count but we're gonna see the indie developer the single developer start

498
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:13,620
expanding a bit more but without losing the things that make us love them and they're going to be a

499
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:19,460
bigger contributor to that economy okay so which chatter do I think you're extremely aligned with

500
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:28,260
here in chat our very own Bobby Blackwell when I said here no here's when our own when I said

501
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:34,980
that comment about the video game crash in 1983 he replied if there's a crash it'll be triple-a

502
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:40,860
games too many people can make video games now that video games will still exist even if the

503
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,900
triple-a companies crash and I'm definitely hearing the common denominator between that

504
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,780
and what you just said yeah yeah but I mean I don't think we're gonna see the big the big ones

505
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:56,380
crash I really don't but I think they're not going to be as important you're gonna see a little more

506
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:02,420
of an equalization I think is a good way to put it the big lower the Indies come higher because

507
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:07,660
that's been happening very slowly in this industry ever since Xbox Live Arcade launched and steam

508
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:15,300
started having a lot more games on it and I I even sort of changed the one I was going to do

509
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:20,460
because I thought I was gonna do that you know we finally get another Silent Hill game blah blah

510
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:26,780
whatever but I was thinking about that and I was thinking we have really amazing games come out

511
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:34,900
from people who were in those I guess triple-a company universes who broke off on their own and

512
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:41,100
did their own really big game you know they had the backing for it it was considered a triple-a

513
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,940
title but I'm referring more to the triple-a studios you know for example Kojima breaking

514
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:53,620
off so those are just you know kind of what cemented that thought in my head so it's kind

515
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:59,700
of a it's a serious one and we're gonna still see that economy growing and employing more people but

516
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:05,260
I think it's not gonna be the big companies that are the driving force so before we get to Loki's

517
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:09,500
third prediction I'm gonna add a chat prediction to the list because it's a little a little bit

518
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,540
adjacent to what dark soccer is talking about but separate enough I think it's worthy of being added

519
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:20,380
here and I'm gonna give it to SSJ 100 Matt and put in the jar for this year that says there won't

520
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:27,380
be a video game industry union but there will be a massive dev lockout that will help trigger

521
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:37,180
towards that so we're gonna finally see the damn burst what's that that is true so but it's a

522
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:41,580
prediction you don't know it might maybe they will unionize by the end of the year or maybe we're

523
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:46,740
just gonna have the the event that leads to that still I like that a lot as a prediction it's a

524
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:50,340
little bit adjacent to what you were just talking about but not quite the same thing so yeah for

525
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:54,140
sure anyway guys keep those predictions coming sorry some of them have scrolled off the screen

526
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:59,340
if you had a really good one that I missed put it back so I can pick that up because we'll get a

527
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:05,740
couple more in there meanwhile let's check out Loki's last prediction so my last prediction is

528
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:13,340
gonna be that despite how unlikely it will be there will be a new Silent Hill announcement

529
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:21,540
this week or year not this week that'd be too soon this year I know it's completely unlikely

530
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:29,660
and never gonna happen but crazier things have happened so and I apologize because you cut out

531
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:36,300
there for a little bit I had some problems with my earbuds so I had to listen to the TV you you

532
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:41,040
are going so even though dark soccer just said I thought about doing Silent Hill you are doing

533
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:48,220
Silent Hill and say yes it is happening something safe like oh you know Microsoft will incorporate

534
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:55,420
Xbox Live gold in the games past that's just that's just too safe so I'm gonna do that all

535
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:01,260
right let me get to some other good ones in chat let's do a cup pull a couple of these from chat

536
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:07,220
these are good let's decide which ones of these we want to put in Zen monkey 11 says I have two

537
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:12,860
predictions Facebook will create its own PlayStation Plus Xbox gold type of service so users can play

538
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:17,780
their oculus games without having to log into Facebook if they want to play offline second

539
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:23,900
rockstar will announce GTA 6 but it won't be called GTA 6 oh that's a good one I like that

540
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:30,740
one act deft oh I really like this one e3 is a hundred percent done and it's never coming back

541
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:41,260
I like that one that's a bold-ass prediction let's do it help me with the dead air guys

542
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:49,180
that goes in the jar I like that I agree with Bobby they're not gonna ever and unbundle oculus

543
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:54,580
from Facebook because you know Facebook likes to collect all the data I could see them doing

544
00:36:54,580 --> 00:37:00,300
something similar though too I think vibe does this with their library right now where you can

545
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:05,540
get like kind of a path to some of that stuff but I could see them doing something similar with you

546
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:11,060
know the oculus like if they haven't already I swear that there's something out there I've seen

547
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:17,580
advertisements for paying for something you get access to a library of VR games so I don't know

548
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:27,100
yeah I think that is by port so sure why not that's easy all right why by our suggests mine

549
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:33,180
is that Nintendo just hold off sorry mine is that Nintendo will cave to investor pressure and keep

550
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:41,540
3d all-stars on sale past March I think you're half right I don't think it's because of investor

551
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:48,180
pressure but I think the gag will be that it comes back after they have already pulled it

552
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:53,540
like in great Disney way I think it comes back before the end of the switches lifetime but it

553
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:59,820
won't be this year I don't they're gonna do some shenanigans shenanigans will be afoot I'll leave

554
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:07,780
it at that this is a pretty gutsy one from SSG 100 Matt saying Sony PlayStation Plus library will

555
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:15,020
rival game pass when it drops a massive library of PlayStation 1 through PlayStation 3 games at once

556
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:23,340
I feel like that's the fan talking the fan wank the Twitter demanding person talking but I that's

557
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:29,660
PlayStation now though that's what they're trying to sell PlayStation now with hmm oh I like this

558
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:37,060
one from business lamp hi there by the way who says um Google stadia has a surge in popularity

559
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:41,460
you know we're really quick to laugh that off I think in the beginning because of you know we've

560
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:48,820
had a lot of criticisms of stadia but cyberpunk change the game I think not only though that is

561
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:56,220
just because the other versions so bad I don't think that's necessarily like all you need is

562
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:04,260
one all you need is one to hook them in no all right all right all right I think I I think it's

563
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:09,660
a good prediction all right um let's see I had some other ones here okay shad stars ik our buddy

564
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:16,140
Shane playing it extremely safe with the safest prediction I've ever seen super giant will follow

565
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:21,900
up Hades with another amazing game maybe like a first-person shooter mixed with a farming sim I

566
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:28,260
don't know and it'll gain critical acclaim and further cement them as the best indie dev out

567
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:34,820
there I think that's definitely the fanboy and Shane talking but I love the I I love the idea

568
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:47,860
of SPF PS meets farming simulator right I love that um let's see what was one there was one more

569
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:53,180
about Animal Crossing in here and I think it was from Sia Tabiri Sia Tabiri in chat says Animal

570
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:59,940
Crossing New Horizons will by the end of the year provide a way to have a secondary place for

571
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:06,620
second-tier animals you don't have room for on your island similar to the pocket camp cabin oh

572
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:11,380
is that like the Pokemon go eggs you to hide them in a different place we think about that the

573
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:20,060
Animal Crossing the island of the undesirable redemption island is what it is right Animal

574
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:25,660
Crossing redemption island where they have to partake in challenges and only the greatest it's

575
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:31,940
the only time to the death it's the only time that twist will be good all right I'm gonna you know

576
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:36,420
what fuck it I'm putting it in the jar Jamie's not here at the moment she stepped away for a

577
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:43,180
moment so I'm gonna sneak it in when she's not looking Animal Crossing redemption island

578
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:52,660
all right perfect there we go that's enough you guys all had great predictions you know what there

579
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:57,340
is nothing stopping you oh well our folks there is nothing stopping you and especially those are

580
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:02,380
listening on the podcast feed you have a jar somewhere you have a piggy bank that's unused

581
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:08,300
you have a piece of Tupperware somewhere put your predictions that down down right three of them put

582
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:13,460
them down lock them away in a in a thing that you're not gonna look at until next year because

583
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:17,020
I'm gonna ask the listeners again those that decided to actually do this and make their own

584
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:23,500
time capsule I want to know what you got right when we do this again next year so we'll talk

585
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:30,340
about that in chat in one year's time all right dark Tetsuya said redemption and island is that

586
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:36,820
like a survivor thing yes look at least I didn't say Animal Crossing island of the idols okay I

587
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:44,780
knew not to go there okay okay all right anyway all right that's some good predictions we'll see

588
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:48,900
I will print that out cut them up and put them in the jar later again I have to do this virtually

589
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:54,460
this year because we're not all able to do this in studio I think the biggest 2021 prediction I'd

590
00:41:54,540 --> 00:42:03,180
like to really hope will come true is that in 2021 we are back to recording in person that is what I

591
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:09,420
would love to see happen in 2021 we're back in person we have vaccines we're able to do this

592
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:17,540
shit in person and yeah all right so good I like the act F says I made a Google spreadsheet that's

593
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:23,220
fine that's a good way to do it I I if you want to do your own virtual time capsule that's fine

594
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:29,580
too a file you don't look at for a year all right anyhow let's get into our gaming weeks

595
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,740
let's talk about our gaming weeks and what we've been playing so I'm usually I would start with

596
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:37,580
dark soccer she stepped away for a moment so I'm gonna go ahead and start with Loki how was your

597
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:46,540
day sorry I didn't play a ton of stuff this week it's been mainly Orna and it's been minecraft I

598
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:56,420
finished a lighthouse in the redstone with that I finished tidying up some stuff and then because

599
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:02,660
my kids kept saying they were making secret bases I made a secret base so they'll never find it you

600
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:07,820
need to do a video tour to supplement for our audience here who wants to see some yeah I kept

601
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:13,060
thinking about doing streaming stuff for that and it would be fun there's a lot of people that do

602
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:18,260
their survivor multiplayer servers and stuff that's really a lot of fun if you have a lot

603
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:25,660
of people that are streaming playing with you then you can just keep going on there but yeah

604
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:30,580
I should probably do that I've been thinking about it that was a good good little bonus content thing

605
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:36,700
all right I see dark soccer is back at her chair so if she doesn't mind me calling on her oh she's

606
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,780
getting ready to eat something so maybe I will do my gaming week and then we'll come back to

607
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:56,060
our soccer you want to go okay it's just okay pudding pops all right I'm laughing but I'm not

608
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:08,100
meaning to I'm sorry but it's just like oh god the misfortune I'm sorry I was also my exfoliating

609
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:13,980
face stuff too so my throat now has ground-up coffee that was God she's telling you you got

610
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:26,460
a nasty mouth you clean up your act pudding all right how is your gaming week um it was okay I

611
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:34,700
mean mostly I really didn't play a whole lot of anything in favor of watching a GDQ I played

612
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:41,060
Animal Crossing of course patterned has new things out and so I've been playing patterned

613
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:50,860
again because y'all know I love that game and I have other things that I'll need to ask of our

614
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:56,980
listeners when we're done with this segment all right we'll come back to that I'll get into my

615
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:00,900
gaming week okay I've been waiting to tell you guys about this one because I know you're gonna

616
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:06,700
tease me and I totally deserve it but I do want to talk about this a little bit so do you remember

617
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:13,020
about a year and a half ago I played an o RG an online reality game an org and I won you remember

618
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:16,940
that and I talked about that and I called it it's funny that we got into survivor jokes earlier

619
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:22,380
because I called it a survivor LARP you remember that whole thing well I haven't played anything in

620
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:29,500
quite a while but for the last two weeks I actually have plant been playing another one

621
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:35,580
but I was playing in secret because it was an anonymous game at meaning the people in it did

622
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:41,420
not know who each other were now hold on to your butts because if you think me talking about

623
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:48,060
participating in a survivor LARP is the nerdiest thing you've ever fucking heard wait wait lay

624
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:57,340
these and gentle them wait because I've got more the anonymous org that I was participating in was

625
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:04,820
based off of the television show Schitt's Creek where we all had to roleplay various members of

626
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:11,620
the Schitt's Creek community I want you to keep in mind I've seen the show Schitt's Creek four times

627
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:17,060
I think it's a hilarious fucking show I you know that the things I've watched I've enjoyed it y'all

628
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:24,300
know I just play so many video games I hardly ever have time for TV so I was playing this game and it

629
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:30,060
was it wasn't totally survivor it was like Big Brother and it was all like it was a bunch of

630
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:34,420
psychological games like all mishmash together it was pretty intense for the two weeks things

631
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:38,580
like that I'll give you an example for example it'll be like okay the eight people that are left

632
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:43,740
in the game you have a gold medal a silver medal and a bronze medal you can give one of these

633
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:48,820
medals to somebody else in the game the gold's worth five the silver is worth three the bronze

634
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:54,740
is worth one whoever has the least amount of points at the end of this will go up for eviction

635
00:46:54,740 --> 00:47:00,380
like the bottom three or something like that will go up for eviction so that is that was like what

636
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:04,980
it was and so it was like a little games and there was one I will tell you where my video gamer ass

637
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:11,300
blew everybody away one of the games was we got to play Tetris a mobile but yet take a screenshot

638
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:17,580
of a Tetris game y'all I smoked the competition in Tetris and I played it one time thank you

639
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:24,580
Tetris effect my 2019 or 18 game of the year for all the practice with Tetris that when I played

640
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:30,980
the played it on the phone it was not a problem for me and that was a lot of fun so pixel pocket

641
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:37,860
says wait so it's Schitt's Creek RP mixed with survivor game yes this is the sixth or seventh

642
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:43,980
circle of nerdom hell that I and it was so much fucking fun like I have to tell you people were

643
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:50,980
really into their characters and the chat is dying to know were you Moira no I was not Moira

644
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:57,820
in fact unfortunately unfortunately Moira and I were very much on strategical opposite sides a

645
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:03,460
great person I'm sure but in the context of the game strategically we were just like completely

646
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:09,420
opposite sides which is funny because the character I was assigned was Johnny Rose or

647
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:15,820
Eugene Levy in the show so my wife and I fought the entire game basically but the like the show

648
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:21,180
well yeah you pretty much sort of well the hilarious thing I had a tight alliance so the

649
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:28,900
Alliance was me Jocelyn shit and Ted the veterinarian who I think dates Alexis or

650
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:36,420
something in a story arc and Robin Robin is Moira's wig in one of the episodes early on

651
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:43,940
so this is the Alliance that pretty much owned the game right to the end of the game and there

652
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:48,140
were other alliances and things like that but you know we were for the for the final five basically

653
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:54,020
so we were kind of in cahoots with Patrick another character so this is the nerdiest fucking thing

654
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:57,700
you've ever heard about in your life but it was so much fun and like getting to talk to everybody

655
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:02,900
afterwards like legit the people I talked to a lot it was all done on slack you're probably

656
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:07,580
wondering how do you do this and this is part of the reason I agreed to do it because I knew it

657
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:12,500
wouldn't be video calls until late in the morning late in the morning like it was last time I played

658
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:17,780
I knew the challenges wouldn't be insane like two-hour endurance challenges like how long can

659
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:23,620
you stand on one foot you know things like that I knew it would be like quick and easy type of

660
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:29,180
stuff and playing on slack was how we did it was that it was only gonna be text chat and things

661
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:33,180
that and it was it kind of was like a throwback to when I used to do this shit on AOL instant

662
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:39,100
messenger back in the day on live journal so so yeah that's how it was so that that's my adventure

663
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:45,580
into the sixth or seventh circle of nerdom hell and I loved it and yeah I thought so oh do you

664
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:53,380
want to know how I did I was I was the runner-up I did not win this time I was the runner-up I got

665
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:59,860
beat unanimously by the person that won but I kind of knew it was coming I know exactly what

666
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:04,660
the the Jocelyn shit won the game spoiler alert because I don't think it's all posted yet sorry

667
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:13,740
Francis if you're listening um but um I you didn't make me sign a contract though um but so Jocelyn

668
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:19,220
won the game and she had very very strong social connections I got to know it is so weird because

669
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:24,420
we were in these characters but at a certain point the roleplay kind of stops and you get to

670
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:28,700
know each other like as people even though I don't actually know who it is but it was somebody I

671
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:33,860
didn't know before we actually like I she told me about how she's always been the runner-up in game

672
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:39,180
she's never won a game and so she won this one I'm like legit happy for she deserved it I know

673
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:43,620
exactly what I well mostly what I did wrong I would have hoped I got one vote but it's all

674
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:48,540
right I'm over it I I knew going into it it was probably gonna go this way and how her game was

675
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:54,380
better than all that and she totally earned it and I will have you all know because it was

676
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:59,340
anonymous nobody knew who was what and people could be characters that were not their own gender or

677
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:07,340
whatever they wanted to do right out of the 11 players in the game 10 of them were men in real

678
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:13,980
life and yes the person playing Moira was a man Robin was a man they were all men one woman in

679
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:20,140
the entire game and guess what the woman was Jocelyn's shit so a woman conquered the entire

680
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:27,020
game so misogyny is dead in 2021 let's hope all right but no seriously congrats if Jessica's out

681
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:31,300
there listening because I told her about the show you earned it you did an amazing job and yeah

682
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:35,540
legit I met some really rad people in that so that's that's why I talk about it on the show

683
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:43,620
and you know if y'all can play D&D it's basically that okay but like a somehow nerdier version of

684
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:51,380
it what I'm actually I got invited to join a roleplay group and I think a few of them might

685
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:58,220
be listening so hello travelers but it's it's a supernatural one well you know any guess guess

686
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:05,180
who's playing a guy oh you this bitch all right we're guess which guy I'm playing uh Castiel no

687
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:10,420
that's the only character name but Dean Sam so close my favorite I only know some of their names

688
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:17,660
all right yeah no it's it's uh it's it's great you know in and in all seriousness you know why

689
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:20,620
are you talking about this on your video game podcast and all that stuff you know we just had

690
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:24,620
this discussion a little bit ago about like mental health and things you have to do to get through a

691
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:30,260
big reason why I signed up for the game was because this was that same week during the

692
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:37,620
holidays where I had to cancel Christmas I had to cancel New Year's I wasn't doing anything so even

693
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:41,780
though you know let's all point at laughing Rob let's all point and laugh at Rob for doing one

694
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:49,380
of these again when he said it's gonna take a lot you know what a pandemic turns out it's a lot it

695
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:56,660
was enough to get me to go do that again so that was that um I'll give the community a shout out

696
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:03,300
to the the community is called TV land kind of like the network over on Facebook and if this

697
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:09,460
sounds like the sixth or seventh circle of nerdom hell you'd like to live in go say hi go check it

698
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:13,780
out they're planning another season I can't say much too much about it but they're they're quick

699
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:19,340
games get your mind off of the bullshit in the real world for a while yeah so shout out to Francis

700
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:27,260
and Stefan over there who did a great job with the TV land game I had a lot of fun um other games

701
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:32,540
I've been playing this week I randomly went on Xbox and started downloading more titles I

702
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:40,980
checked out the burnout paradise okay keep going to say burnout paradise city but that's not it but

703
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,900
I played burnout paradise remastered because it's on Xbox game pass I was like I haven't played a

704
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:48,500
burnout game in like five years I want to play one and so that was really fun I was trying to

705
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:53,380
get some achievements in that and it looks really good and really snappy on the Xbox series X I had

706
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:58,660
a lot of fun with that I've been playing a little bit of Pokemon go so they did these collection

707
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:03,900
challenges this week and I was about ready to throw my phone because I could not catch one of

708
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:10,100
the stupid Pokemon that I needed to catch but I finally got it yesterday so all is well unclench

709
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:15,780
but I like the idea of these little mini challenges with collection medals I just wish there was a way

710
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:21,220
to ensure that some of the pokey spawns were like a sure thing because that part started to get

711
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:27,660
really frustrating that was okay that was what was starting to get irritating otherwise some of the

712
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:35,820
other typical GPS games and oh Final Fantasy 14 as always I'm still playing that thing crafting

713
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:40,380
is getting a big thing next week in the game and so I'm all ready for it so yeah that's been that's

714
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:44,940
been a really good escape to to get together with friends and do things in Final Fantasy 14 because

715
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:49,420
I can't do things with friends in the real world so thank you video games thank you survivor LARP's

716

thank you all these things to help us to thank you AGDQ and all these things that help us take

717
00:54:54,100 --> 00:55:00,940

a game that's in my my I almost said twitch it's a steam in my steam library or if I can get it

725
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:04,820
figured out just some classic game that I own something you know even if it's something that

726
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:10,740
you think I'll hate if it's a game that you think I'll hate and I don't own it I will accept you

727
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:19,400
buying it for me if it's a low in other words is what you're saying I mean we have a bunch of

728
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:24,980
halos on other systems so I mean I guess I can hook up one of the Xboxes we can fee I can ding

729
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:32,580
dong ditch you my my old Xbox one with my master collection our master chief collection disk if we

731
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:52,500
everything set up my my goal would be to to raise money during it but who whoever contributes I'm

732
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,940
trying to think of how to do this right because I don't want to get the channel in trouble or

733
00:56:54,940 --> 00:57:00,660
anything don't come don't commit on air maybe just like you know to be continued on your Twitter

734
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:06,500
which you work some of these things out but yeah I'm looking for suggestions but I will take

735
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:13,220
donations with the suggestions and that will add a triple vote okay based on a certain dollar amount

736
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:21,860
and I'll put something like that on my on my Facebook and Twitter's more public anyway so it's

737
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:28,380
easier all right well best of luck I hope I and I can't wait to support the stream or whatever it

738
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:34,300
is you end up doing with that be fun I'll put it this way every every minimum every ten dollar

739
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:41,100
amount so every multiple of ten will count as an extra vote toward that game awesome okay all

740
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:46,140
right set a date though but not you don't have to right now but maybe like next week all right yeah

741
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:54,180
it's probably gonna happen my goal actually is to get this going on sometime either next week or the

742
00:57:54,180 --> 00:58:00,660
week after but I want to promote it this week and let people think about it okay all right let's get

743
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:06,300
into some gaming news there are some things going on this week even though you know it's it's it's a

744
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:12,100
slower time of year for gaming news we saw a few things to talk about and sometimes that is things

745
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:19,420
things from not just last year but many years ago right Loki yes from 2006 so apparently a core

746
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:25,620
design was a studio that was behind the original Tomb Raider series they were working on a remake

747
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:33,820
of the original game for its 10th anniversary on PSP and of course you know the game never came out

748
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:42,820
on PSP well now they have apparently the contents of the game have been uploaded to the Internet

749
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:50,420
archive as part of I guess the doing of this Tomb Raider fam site called the tomb of ash and

750
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:59,460
apparently they are able you're able to take this and actually play it it looks pretty good actually

751
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:05,380
considering you know it's a remake of the first game I mean I could definitely seen this being

752
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:12,460
released I don't know why it wasn't released at all but apparently it says the game had been

753
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:18,460
canceled instead of being published side entertainment they went with a multi-platform

754
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:24,500
remake developed by Crystal Dynamics which was a two meter anniversary game so this pitch didn't

755
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:32,060
end up making to a final game but the Crystal Dynamics one did so yeah too bad it looks pretty

756
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:39,460
good though yeah I love when these like unearthed games kind of show up all over again and it's like

757
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:42,940
kind of getting to discover this thing and that's kind of been a thing I feel like we've seen more

758
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:46,620
and more of it the past couple months like Sega put out that golden axe thing not that long ago

759
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:51,300
right like there's there's been little yeah these canceled projects coming back to life and I like

760
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:56,780
it when it's official like obviously the Nintendo hack stuff is super dicey but when like the

761
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:00,700
companies kind of like embrace it a little bit it's cool although I guess this one wasn't wasn't

762
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:05,780
really embraced right or well I think it was just that there was another project going on at the

763
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:13,060
same time so it just didn't end up you know come into fruition but um still pretty cool yeah I'd

764
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:19,260
love to check it out do I do I even have a working PSP I guess I still have a working Vita so there

765
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:24,700
is that but might be kind of hard to get going I don't know let's move on and talk about something

766
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:28,060
else from the past that's been making headlines this week you've probably seen this all around

767
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:34,140
different gaming blogs and that is a conversation between Microsoft and Nintendo in fact a lot of

768
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:39,140
the headlines say Microsoft tried to buy Nintendo at some point and essentially and a lot of the

769
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:45,380
headlines are saying and got laughed out of the room as a result which I I don't know if it's

770
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:49,500
quite that simple I mean surely that was probably part of the discussion but of all it also might

771
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:54,900
have been a starting point to try to get to another type of agreement and maybe that is

772
01:00:54,900 --> 01:01:01,060
Nintendo games on the Xbox which obviously we all know Nintendo wants no part of that shit

773
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:10,660
Nintendo you know they kind of started to go down that road with the whole CDI I know that was a

774
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:16,020
little bit different the CDI was a result of the CD expansion for the Super Nintendo that never

775
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:20,380
happened as part of like the divorce agreement between Phillips who was helping to work on it

776
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:27,980
and Nintendo Phillips got the right to use like five Nintendo characters in their own games thus

777
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:34,820
the Wanda Gamelan and some other games that really were a stain for Nintendo so Nintendo has no

778
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:39,740
interest on being on other platforms like ever again like Nintendo will die as a company before

779
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:45,380
that ever happens as far as licensing games so like have Microsoft make a Nintendo game or

780
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:49,100
something like that and I don't even know necessarily if they're totally opposed to that

781
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:56,140
I mean you have you know the Mario and Sonic games and those you know are built by Sega true

782
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:59,180
there's been other games you know have been developed by Namco and stuff like that so I

783
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:05,580
don't think that they're completely um you know shooting all of those down but like I mean it

784
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:10,700
would be pretty cool if they had like a service of their own games that they could you know say

785
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:18,060
for example if I could get the Nintendo online channel on you know my Xbox or something like

786
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:24,620
that just say game pass on switch just just lean all the way in okay the only thing though is this

787
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:29,500
story is about a meeting that happened in January 2000 so game pass wasn't even in anybody's

788
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:34,060
imagination at that point yeah it was a long time ago this meeting happened so they were still

789
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:41,340
planning the Xbox at this time and you know and before you say god what a bunch of idiots at

790
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:47,300
Microsoft keep in mind in the year 2000 you're coming back the Wii hadn't happened yet so you're

791
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:53,060
coming out and the GameCube wasn't out yet you were coming off the Nintendo 64 and some technology

792
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:59,620
that was really starting to like not be on that same level as where Sony was at so that was kind

793
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:05,940
of Microsoft's leveraging was you give us or you give us the games we'll give you the technology

794
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:13,940
this is a great partnership and honestly yes but you know and any fanboy who's ever said I wish

795
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:18,580
they would just put Mario games on the PlayStation or on there like that's basically what Microsoft

796
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:24,500
went in there asking but you know it's obviously not taking into consideration that Nintendo wants

797
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:29,780
no fucking part of that they don't need it they don't want it they ain't gonna have it and so

798
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:34,580
that what leads to the headline where they got laughed out of the room um head of business

799
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:39,540
development for Microsoft Bob McBreen said in an interview uh we actually had Nintendo in our

800
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:44,180
building in January 2000 to work through the details of a joint venture where we gave them

801
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:49,780
all the technical specs of the Xbox the pitch was their hardware stunk and compared to Sony

802
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:55,220
PlayStation it did so the idea was listen you're much better at the game portions of it with Mario

803
01:03:55,220 --> 01:04:00,900
and all that stuff why don't you let us take care of the hardware and then I love this but it didn't

804
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:11,460
work out it didn't work out but you know yeah but on one hand honestly was Microsoft wrong

805
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:19,700
I don't think they were wrong but the only thing they were wrong about is that Nintendo

806
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:25,060
doesn't give a fuck Nintendo has their own approach to things and that and that continues

807
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:31,220
on into the year 2021 so I don't know I thought that was kind of an interesting thing that was

808
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:35,540
going around but especially because that headline where like Nintendo laughed Microsoft out of the

809
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:42,260
room and I'm kind of like I think it goes a little deeper than that like would if I went back and

810
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:48,980
looked at your old tweets did you laugh Microsoft out of the room on these things where you know

811
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:53,700
Mario should come to PlayStation all that stuff because I don't think a lot of people did so I

812
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:57,140
don't think I was even thinking about that yeah now some folks in our chat room over

813
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:03,380
twitch.tv slash vog network uh pod culture is saying master chief in smash and then act f points

814
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:11,780
out banjo kazooie and steve are in smash so who's to say that a meeting back in 2000 didn't at least

815
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:16,100
and even if they all had a good laugh about it whether they were laughing with or laughing at

816
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:21,620
uh who's to say that opening those lines of communication all those years ago didn't lead to

817
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:27,940
something like what we see now which is a little more of you know the the a little bit of helping

818
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:34,180
each other out here and there so and sj 100 matt says it was not seriously entertained was the

819
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:42,580
actual comment really because the one I read said but it didn't work out you don't say

820
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:48,580
all right I thought that was an interesting story and I loved I loved those little pieces

821
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:52,900
of gaming history where it's kind of like what could have been who knows

822
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:55,940
anyway dark soccer why don't you take us to our next story

823
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:08,820
um the uh a multiple winner uh of the uh tetris world uh champ that I can't make even words

824
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:14,580
happen uh the classic tetris world champion uh jonas newbauer has died um

825
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:23,860
um it uh I don't see exactly what it was that that did it I'd have to to look uh

826
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:29,140
I don't think I think they've just said sudden emergency so it kind of you know

827
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:39,060
but it's still I mean he went seven times so I mean that that's that's uh a very important

828
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:43,460
you know person I guess in the community and to lose somebody so suddenly

829
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:51,380
you know just uh wishing the best for his family yeah this is some um this is some really sad

830
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:55,460
news there's no real easy way to talk about especially somebody young this guy was like

831
01:06:55,460 --> 01:07:00,500
three years younger than I am so it's um it's it's really tragic to hear about these types of things

832
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:05,060
and I think a lot of you probably watch those tetris world championship videos that this

833
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:10,340
yes it was that guy yeah that's uh uh was in them that um passed away and that's that's really

834
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:18,740
really sad so um anyhow um tipping our hat and remembering uh this week um let's move on try to

835
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:24,500
move on to uh other news uh it's it's been a heavy week and that has led to some things in

836
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:35,620
the gaming world too right loki um yeah so there is some interesting um things going on on twitch

837
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:44,180
so apparently one of the emotes uh pogchamp was featuring the face of streamer ryan gucex

838
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:52,900
gutiérrez um and apparently they took it down because he was tweeting some extremely um

839
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:59,700
questionable things and they didn't want to necessarily associate with him so because of

840
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:08,180
that they had disabled the pogchamp emotes and um eventually then are replacing it now with

841
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:14,500
a new uh pogchamp emote that will feature different streamer spaces making the same

842
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:21,060
face that they're going to swap out every 24 hours hopefully none of them have said questionable

843
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:28,100
things on twitter well honestly this although obviously the situation is yikes the resolution

844
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:30,820
kind of leads to one of those things where it's like this is kind of the way it should have always

845
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:39,780
been you know like twitch is more than about one person like i'm not here to like knock people like

846
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:44,020
you know ninja or whatever that have done very well i mean unless they act a fool then i will

847
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:48,260
knock them but you know as far as like their success you know and stuff like that hey great

848
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:54,580
they've been successful but twitch is much more than one person you know or one you know community

849
01:08:54,580 --> 01:09:00,260
it's about the greater community of all these great twitch streamers that we have and yes

850
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:05,540
diverse types of twitch streamers that we have just in and i'm not just talking about you know

851
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:11,140
things like sexuality and colors of people's skin but the countries they're playing from the types

852
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:14,900
of game that's all important too don't get me wrong but like the types of games that they're

853
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:20,980
playing as well the the things that they're into and the the stories they have to share so i i

854
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:25,700
like this resolution even though the way we got here was a bit of a oh yeah i'm kind of like

855
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:32,180
it should have just been this way from day one like have a rotating face of the why not the

856
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:37,300
people on the front page rotate every day so why not have some of your emotes rotate as well all

857
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:44,020
the time so i mean it's kind of makes sense yeah so yeah and it's interesting sha100 matt says

858
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:48,180
i knew the emoji didn't know it was an actual personality yeah a lot of people didn't know

859
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:53,380
where it came from but you know i'm i'm you know i'm glad they addressed it and ultimately you know

860
01:09:53,380 --> 01:10:01,460
you can qq about free speech all you want although you know big huge fat reminder free speech doesn't

861
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:06,500
apply to private platforms so period that's not really has to do with criticizing the government

862
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:11,940
yeah so yeah you can go the free speech is what allows me to say president trump sucks

863
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:16,340
because in some other countries you criticize a leader like that you get thrown in jail

864
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:22,500
so i i'm thankful for folks you can yell fire in a movie theater just saying right so anyway

865
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:28,660
civics less than another day but i think it's also important with everything's been going on this week

866
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:34,020
um but i i think it's really great that we're you know highlighting again a bunch of different

867
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:38,660
people and things like that so and and bob blackwolf rotating through some of the other

868
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:44,420
popular emotes saying these are also people yes of course they're they're uh modeled after people

869
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:50,580
now do you guys want a hot take that i think is is not going to be popular but i'm gonna say it

870
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:59,060
anyway um i think in general these emotes of people's faces are generally a bad idea now

871
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:04,740
don't be wrong hold on let me finish the pogchamp stuff cool some of these iconic twitter things

872
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:10,260
that you know folks have cool but if somebody and nobody has but but i'm gonna say it anyway

873
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:13,860
if somebody were to come up to me and say what emote icon should i make for my channel

874
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:22,180
i'm gonna say please don't use pictures of your face because that's everywhere that's everywhere

875
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:31,300
use something else and maybe use just my my old speaking here but um i don't know what half of

876
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:37,460
that stuff means anyways exactly faces and stuff i have no idea what it's representing um

877
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:44,340
it's cool i guess i mean they can have their own you know uh speech in twitch and whatnot but i

878
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:49,220
just don't get it see you see it seeing them they're very annoying yeah see it tabiri just

879
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:53,300
posted a couple and you know and i know you're doing it to be tongue in cheek and on topic but

880
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:58,340
i literally don't know what i'm looking at they're so small i don't know what they are the face palm

881
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:03,380
i get that one but especially like when we're talking like you know even more popular chat rooms

882
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:09,220
and stuff we're just scrolling by it's like i don't know what it that's just garbage it's

883
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:14,420
literally just garbage being thrown in my face yeah so just something to think about now when

884
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:18,900
i was watching gdq do you know what the most common there were there are two two comedy

885
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:24,740
emotes that i saw the lamp which is an inside joke but it makes sense it's not somebody's face

886
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:31,540
i'll give you that and the clapping emoji yes that that is a good one to spam because we're

887
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:36,500
not in person we don't have an audience so yes use your clapping emoji and use it a lot

888
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:43,220
yeah i believe in fairies yes clap okay it's it makes sense so anyway again you guys are

889
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:46,740
posting these emotes and i'm like what the hell are these i don't even know all right anyway

890
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:53,220
let's move on shall we let's move on to a story about monster hunter you guys have some monster

891
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:57,940
hunter emotes to share because that's what's topical for this story uh a brand new demo for

892
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:02,740
monster hunter rise came out just this past week if you weren't already aware i'm sure if you're

896
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:28,740
in there we're going to artificially shorting anybody with supplies i don't think this is

897
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:35,140
nintendo is capcom yeah but this is how they have this is how they handle their demos whether it's

898
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:40,820
like you know it's for a limited time or we're gonna allow you to play this demo only 30 times

899
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:48,180
before you can't play it anymore it's an antenna thing so it is limited to uh there are 30 quests

900
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:53,540
in the game and dark tatsuya and chat says there it's limited to 30 plays so it's that same kind

901
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:59,140
of totally totally nintendo told you you know that part's nintendo yeah so oh but bobby says this one

902
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:04,900
specifically is a capcom thing so maybe but nintendo started it capcom's continuing it i

903
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:13,700
don't know but um yeah so uh i but 30 is a lot i mean on those here's the thing have you ever

904
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:21,780
actually used 30 plays of a demo my my kids have yes okay all right i'll let it go all right jumping

905
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:28,740
flash i guess there was that time i downloaded the luminous demo from an e3 kiosk with the ds

906
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:35,060
download thing and i i i refused to turn off my ds for like three weeks so i could keep playing

907
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:41,140
the luminous demo yeah so i used to play all the playstation magazine demos used to bring in the

908
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:46,260
school we'd play like the cool borders 2 2 demo over and over and over and over and over again

909
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:51,140
i eventually bought the game bobby says capcom did this even in other countries

910
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:59,300
um so anyway all right let's move on i i'm curious because i didn't i'm not a big

911
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:07,300
monster hunter person um oh bobby says other consoles not other countries so the same deal

912
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:14,900
is on the playstation whatever so anyway my point is outside the the weird constrictions of it i

913
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:20,420
don't get into monster hunter i have tried several times there was one on the wii u i tried to get

914
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:24,500
into couldn't get into it i tried playing dauntless not that not that long ago i think i

915
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:28,020
saw vg realness or somebody streaming it and i was like i want to try this and i tried i couldn't get

916
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:32,420
into it it's like i can never get into these monster hunter games and i just no offense to

917
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:37,460
the fandom i know these games are huge i just can't get into it so for those that are into

918
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:42,020
the fandom what did you think of monster hunter rise the demo because admittedly i haven't tried

919
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:46,340
it and i'm not exactly in a hurry to although i probably will at some point so i'm kind of

920
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:54,420
curious what those of you who actually played the demo feel about it so um dark tetsuya says it

921
01:15:54,420 --> 01:16:00,180
seems like it might be more fun than generations ultimate at least so uh see it tabiri says i'd

922
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:06,100
rather be playing monster rancher all right fine um quest buster says monster hunter world is good

923
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:11,780
stuff but i still need to try out the rise demo uh shad starzik or shane has actually played the

924
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:18,020
demo thank you and says the rise demo was crazy fun and ran so well compared to what i was expecting

925
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:22,900
because it is on the switch and so again and we just talked about this with the nintendo

926
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:27,620
microsoft boardroom story uh nintendo is not known for pushing the boundaries on tech so

927
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:35,060
uh it's still coming off as impressive even with the fact that it's on the switch uh dark tetsuya

928
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:38,820
says yeah that's fair it's probably harder to get into if you're not already familiar which is

929
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:43,620
probably a bad idea fifth dream says monster hunter world was the only monster hunter i played

930
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:50,980
and i loved it and i burnt myself out on monster hunter after like 700 hours so i'm done with it

931
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:58,260
wow you say that now fifth dream but just one hit of the new one you never know so anyway thank you

932
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:03,220
guys for the feedback uh i i'll check it out at some point i gotta go in and download it but i

933
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:09,620
guess it was doing so well it like crashed the servers the day it went up so uh a lot of people

934
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:14,740
wanted to check that out all right moving on uh just a few more stories when we get to our classic

935
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:16,340
game of the week but first dark sakura

936
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:24,980
one of the things about agdq uh this year is that we saw and one of them i watched a uh

937
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:32,100
two world records broken back to back that was pretty cool um the one i actually sat and watched

938
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:36,980
was uh sonic fox oh sorry flying fox i don't know why i said sonic sonic fox that's a different

939
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:46,180
flying fox um actually uh played uh which of the it was one of the sonic okay it was the sonic the

940
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:52,900
hedgehog 2013 and sonic 3 angel island revisited um were the two games that were played so sonic

941
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:58,260
the hedgehog 2013 i believe it was the um android one that had some elements from the later sonic

942
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:04,420
games and uh she beat her time actually she matched the world record during her practice i

943
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:11,860
think and then well surpassed it uh during the final run and then right after that uh zaxxon 96

944
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:18,820
uh broke a world record for sonic 3 angel island revisited i didn't watch that one um but i did

945
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:24,180
see flying fox and just actually just funny watching her reaction was absolutely breathtaking

946
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:28,100
i mean just i love watching that moment where someone accomplishes something and they don't

947
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:33,460
quite believe it make sense yeah oh yeah for sure um so it was really good and congratulations

948
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:39,380
um uh bobby blackwolf went into great detail on awesome games done quick on his show tonight

949
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:43,940
um since he's able to give a little bit of an insider's perspective you know having uh

950
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:49,220
been been a volunteer again this year um and uh or specifically a host i should say because i

951
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:55,300
think there's a difference between those two titles um but uh bobby gave a lot of insight

952
01:18:55,300 --> 01:19:02,020
there and was talking about how uh the speed run he was hosting for yoshi's island ended up being

953
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:09,220
like the number three best time of that game ever uh if the person running it didn't already have

954
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:14,180
number two and you you only get on the scoreboard once basically so so it would have been number

955
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:18,500
three and and obviously a lot of people were talking about stage five four and just some of

956
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:22,340
the create and i was actually watching that when i did i did see that part on wednesday and that

957
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:27,460
was insanity that was just like damn that takes some skills i went trying to find the other ones

958
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:30,900
and i couldn't because i knew that there were a couple others that i didn't catch but

959
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:38,900
i uh that i that one for me just because it was when i witnessed i was like yeah yeah girl yeah

960
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:43,380
very cool what were the other two uh bobby's saying there were four in all that happened

961
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:50,900
right during the event diablo 3 um okay wow diablo 3 three man even world record the four

962
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:57,060
man time that's pretty impressive and then super or brothers yeah i said that one i did see because

963
01:19:57,140 --> 01:20:03,060
they allotted like 40 minutes to the slot and uh dude beat it in like what 15 minutes 15 minutes

964
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:08,340
something like that no it was pretty quick no i take that back 18 because his time the world

965
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:14,580
record was 36 and he cut it directly in half oh wow roundabout yeah and that was really fun

966
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:20,980
because that one for a kaizo style game it didn't have the same feel to me as a kaizo game it was

967
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:25,940
more of a technical game if that makes sense like not everything in the universe was trying to kill

968
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:32,820
you you just had a set way that you had to beat the puzzle right and yeah super orbit brothers

969
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:40,660
was was a really good one i i that was probably one of my favorite runs to watch next to uh

970
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:47,700
rugby baby that was a great that was a great moment so hard don't don't spoil it don't spoil

971
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:52,900
it because people gotta watch it for themselves no no no but i need to find a picture of like

972
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:58,820
the happiest moment for that baby and have that be like my new icon for everything all right

973
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:07,700
all right let's move on and let hey guys let's talk about nudity loki yes so apparently koei

974
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:17,540
techmo has filed charges against um somebody that was allegedly selling unlicensed dvds filled with

975
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:24,500
naked dead or alive characters so this is kind of like your rule 34 stuff where they i i don't know

976
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:29,380
if they're still using like the source filmmaker and stuff to make some of these things but you

977
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:34,980
know the like cg animated like take video game characters and have them doing illicit stuff

978
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:40,660
well kind of the same type of thing they made a uh dead or alive extreme um venus vacation

979
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:48,900
and have been modding it to you know make it look like they're engaging in sexual activities

980
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:53,140
and then selling dvds which is a big no-no because you don't own those characters and

981
01:21:53,140 --> 01:22:00,020
also who buys dvds nowadays um but apparently they have you know gone after them because

982
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:06,260
obviously copyright issues um but it's the internet all those out there those boobies

983
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:10,180
are copyright koei techmo those are we own those

984
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:19,380
but yeah so uh i just i haven't heard of a lot of legal action against a nude mod in quite some

985
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:25,460
time it's been well it's not necessarily a mod per se i mean it's sort of i mean i guess it could be

986
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:31,700
but it's it's more of just like taking the characters and then like turning it into like

987
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:37,140
their own thing kind of like how you see a lot of the um folks doing stuff with the overwatch

988
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:43,300
characters and stuff like that like activision blizzard could come after them you know for doing

989
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:49,060
that type of thing especially if they're profiting from it um i think a lot of it's you know kind of

990
01:22:49,060 --> 01:22:55,220
anonymous on the internet and people aren't necessarily selling dvds of it but if if they

991
01:22:55,220 --> 01:23:01,460
were caught they could be you know responsible for you know penalties because of copyright and

992
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:08,420
infringement all right i got no good transition here so i'm just gonna get into the next story

993
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:13,940
which has to do with minecraft earth or should i say had to do with minecraft earth

994
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:19,620
because minecraft earth which uh again is the phone game the ar game for minecraft yeah

995
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:24,740
people were saying it's like pokemon go i that that is really i was like that is how you know

996
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:29,780
somebody hasn't played it it was nothing like pokemon go it just happened to take place in the

997
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:34,580
real world loki you've probably played a little bit more of this than anyone else here so let me

998
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:42,980
finish your crew they're shutting it down june 30th 2021 because it didn't work yeah and uh one

999
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:46,500
good thing though is like if you did purchase anything in the game they are giving you a free

1000
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:55,220
copy of minecraft so if you um do end up i don't know but basically uh the problem with it was

1001
01:23:55,220 --> 01:24:01,300
there's like no point to it like it it was like you could you go and click these tappable things

1002
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:08,340
to get resources which you could use to get blocks in the game to build stuff but like honestly like

1003
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:14,820
the build spaces that you had there's no shortage of blocks i mean it's it's pretty much almost

1004
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:20,020
impossible not to have the resources to do things in the game and i don't know if i didn't really

1005
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:24,980
play it very long so like they didn't have even really gotten to like a lot of the crafting stuff

1006
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:30,420
in there you can make tools and stuff but a lot of that wasn't fully implemented yet when i had

1007
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:36,420
stopped playing it um the ar stuff that they did was pretty cool um i mean that was definitely

1008
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:42,500
really awesome the problem was because a lot of the ar stuff was reliant on you going places to

1009
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:49,460
do all that it was hard to kind of do that in a pandemic um and that that was my next question

1010
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:54,260
was is is this because of the pandemic like i i heard they made some changes to try to make it

1011
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:57,620
a little more like pokemon go did the same thing that that is something those games have in common

1012
01:24:57,620 --> 01:25:02,260
so that you would get like these like gem things that you would be able to redeem to like kind of

1013
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:08,660
spawn one of those instances near where your location was um and they were kind of cool i

1014
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:13,700
mean but it was just there wasn't really like an end goal like there was like different achievements

1015
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:20,100
they had along the way to get more xp that you're like okay you know today you have to capture five

1016
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:25,300
sheep or something like that and and some of it was like kind of hard to do but like it was just

1017
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:33,060
i don't know there was never really a point to it and also it ate my battery like it was a very

1018
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:38,740
unoptimized game yeah um i don't know if it that ever changed but like when i was playing it in

1019
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:47,460
the very uh early part of when it came out it was just so so unoptimized um i think it's gotten

1020
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:52,180
better i've seen like some folks you know especially they've partnered with different

1021
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:58,340
minecraft streamers to kind of showcase the different things i know there's one i watch with

1022
01:25:58,340 --> 01:26:06,100
some of the folks from hermitcraft um agree in and mumbo who do they did this like kind of uh

1023
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:12,340
road trip thing and they they really made stonehenge and stuff and uh recreated that in in

1024
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:18,100
minecraft earth and so it's kind of cool um but it's just i don't know it's a really great

1025
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:24,180
concept i think it was not executed great though and i think i think maybe the pandemic also just

1026
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:29,780
like didn't help the inertia in the game and yeah they didn't communicate well like what was the

1027
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:34,900
point you know and i think that was a big uh problem with it and and what ssj100 matt is

1028
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:40,260
saying in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network i honestly forgot all about it which i

1029
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:46,980
is i guess in a sense what was the problem me too matt and the game is on my phone and i just don't

1030
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:50,900
because i always check out those ar games because i'm a sucker for all of them i've played them all

1031
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:57,380
i've played them all um and and i forgot about minecraft earth because you're right they did

1032
01:26:57,380 --> 01:27:00,660
they weren't very good at communicating like what's the point what's the competition what

1033
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:05,300
am i going for here what's you know what do i have to look forward to tomorrow where do i

1034
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:09,300
interact with other people like that just didn't really get realized ever in the game and i don't

1035
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:14,500
know if the pandemic just fucked that all up for them or what and they never like i know one of

1036
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:18,180
the things that they had talked about is like building creations and putting them out there

1037
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:23,460
in the real world which you can sort of do and interact with them but they're not persistent

1038
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:27,780
which is kind of irritating i mean i guess that's probably a good thing because there'd be dicks

1039
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:33,220
everywhere but um it's just it would still be pretty cool though like get to have that stuff

1040
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:37,380
be persistent because then you could just go places and that would be more of like kind of

1041
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:41,780
like oh i'm going to go to the park and see what's there you know or something um but there

1042
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:47,300
wasn't really anything like that um you could bring a creation that you make and put it out

1043
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:55,860
into the real world but like it i don't know it was just it was tough to it had a lot of good ideas

1044
01:27:55,860 --> 01:28:02,180
but in the end i guess it's just not really um successful but i hope that they bring a lot of

1045
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:07,060
i mean they've already brought some of the stuff over to the uh regular minecraft i hope that they

1046
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:12,820
bring a lot more of these mobs that they've created in this game to the uh vanilla minecraft

1047
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:20,100
as well okay all right well let's take a trip down memory lane and we're gonna go to a time when uh

1048
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:24,660
there was there was no ar games you couldn't you couldn't play this stuff on your phone you know

1049
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:30,100
why because your phone was in your car or it was in your kitchen on a cord it's the classic game

1050
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:35,460
of the week dark sakura is going to take a trip down memory lane and uh find a game in the vault

1051
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:40,740
that she thinks hey this game is worthy of your attention and by the way before we get into

1052
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:46,100
tonight's game a quick follow-up to last week dark sakura you would be very proud of our twitter

1053
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:51,140
people as they have a or excuse me our twitter people are uh wiki people as they have quickly

1054
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:58,580
added flag or the fucking weird arcade game of the month officially to the list for this year so

1055
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:05,780
i saw everything is set up wonderful thank you five people all right uh so but anyway tonight

1056
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:10,500
is not a flag because you did one last week so we've got a good a good old classic in fact again

1057
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:16,500
like here we are again episode 851 you have literally picked 601 of these over the years

1058
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:22,100
we started the segment in episode 250 you have picked 601 games somehow have never picked this

1059
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:28,740
one which i'm like what well you you picked adjacent games but you didn't do this one yeah

1060
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:33,060
this one or the one i played dark soccer all right what is it let's get to it what is the

1061
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:40,260
classic game of the week i picked the nest version of strider um by the way you're you're a little

1062
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:43,460
quiet for the listeners you might want to get just a little bit closer to the microphone i think

1063
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:50,020
you'll be better fucking thing sorry my uh i'm a professional yeah you're fine you're much better

1064
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:54,660
now yeah well it's just because the thing tilts down and i don't have anything to hold that in

1065
01:29:54,660 --> 01:30:00,340
place so everyone can see me fighting my mic on oh god i hate this thing no they can't see it

1066
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:07,620
because they're watching strider oh good well i hate my pop filter and i want it to die oh my god

1067
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:12,660
i hate you okay here we go and that's the sounds of what happens when i fight my tech equipment y'all

1068
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:20,740
how i sound now you sound very loud and very clear so strider all right strider so this particular

1069
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:28,900
version of strider came out in 1998 uh for the nes released by capcom only uh in north america

1070
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:35,940
um i well actually i think only in north america um yeah there's a famicom version uh was never

1071
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:46,260
released um this was developed um in tandem with the arcade version um so also the nest version

1072
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:53,540
uh was included in the 2006 game boy advance compilation capcom classics mini mix so i'm

1073
01:30:53,540 --> 01:31:01,860
going to back off a little bit and say that this game is not the same strider that you think it is

1074
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:10,980
um it is a uh it's it's a little bit more of a a scroller game size for the platformer but you

1075
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:14,660
go and look around for this kind of like more like teenage mutant turtles if that makes sense

1076
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:19,780
you have to go find different items um get different discs that have uh information that

1077
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:24,820
goes with the plot you have several characters can also give you new abilities um that help you

1078
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:30,740
like bypass different uh areas and everything but now here is the thing about this game um

1079
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:42,340
this game is based off of um a manga um comic uh comptique uh which is a well it was a among the

1080
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:48,900
anthology that was published by uh katakawa shilton um had a strategy manga that was uh

1081
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:58,100
released from may to may and october issue made two october issues in 1988 and then a single issue

1082
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:06,020
ended up uh tankoban sorry was uh released in november of that year so it basically has the

1083
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:12,980
same characters and the plot that was used in the nest version a few differences um where uh

1084
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:20,020
i don't i mean there's certain characters that die you know they die in different places um some

1085
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:27,620
characters live um and then there was um an uncollected uh chapter that was called

1086
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:37,940
that was also uh published after the main series so it has uh uh you know more things that go after

1087
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:45,780
the the ending of the game um but at any rate yeah this um this game um well and it was uh

1088
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:52,820
actually named strider hiryu um to be released in uh japan there was the it was announced while the

1089
01:32:52,820 --> 01:33:00,100
manga was out and they had it scheduled to be released but it got delayed to 1989 and then it

1090
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:05,540
was cancelled so we still had the localized version that came out here in the u.s. um that

1091
01:33:05,540 --> 01:33:15,380
came right after the the arcade game um it the artwork on it is interesting i don't it's just

1092
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:25,380
when they were doing the super american artwork um yeah but i mean there's people who love this

1093
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:34,100
game i mean i'm i'm not one of them i'll just go ahead and say um but you can also uh you know it

1094
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:40,420
it's it's got an interesting story to it i do enjoy the story to it um one other thing also

1095
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:45,940
this game is that you can use your your it has a password system so um but every time you request

1096
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:53,780
a password the game will end with a description of your progress so far and gives the title of the

1097
01:33:53,780 --> 01:34:02,020
next adventure like it was uh an anime or a tv series or you know even in a manga series so

1098
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:10,260
it's kind of neat um but yeah it's it's not if you're expecting to go through with ha ha ha ha

1099
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:17,380
and sailing on fighter and fight you know oroboros um it's not the same game it's completely different

1100
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:21,300
game it's a very different game and you were kind of talking about like people you know maybe

1101
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:27,060
preferred this game i wouldn't say i necessarily preferred it but it's the only one i knew you know

1102
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:32,500
as a kid because i didn't have a genesis i uh for whatever reason i never noticed the other strider

1103
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:36,340
in the years i think i think a couple years later i saw the strider in the arcade at one point i'm

1104
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:43,620
like this is nothing like strider you know um but my frame of reference was this particular game that

1105
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:47,780
we had rented a couple times i think nintendo power had some of the maps and i thought the

1106
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:53,220
little tunnels that you traveled through were cool so yeah i i i have fond memories of this game but

1107
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:59,860
it's clearly the the genesis and the arcade one are are the better games um but this one was

1108
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:06,660
what's that he's walking is so fucking weird in that game yeah but this game is gonna meet

1109
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:13,940
himself in the chin well and this was also the game that brought us that horrific uh triangle

1110
01:35:13,940 --> 01:35:19,300
jumping i don't know if you remember that from this game but you had like wall bounce basically

1111
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:26,180
and it was really really hard to do and would just drive you crazy i think they did something

1112
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:30,740
like it in a metroid game or something later on it was really awful there too uh but even harder

1113
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:37,460
here um so yeah i i i do remember this game in fact i see in the in the youtube we're watching

1114
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:41,780
right now of somebody playing the game there in egypt and i remember this level like i do this

1115
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:48,580
you know and it comes from an era of capcom um there's definitely an engine that powers this

1116
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:54,900
game the capcom you know backbone of a lot of their uh a bit nes era games there's a lot about

1117
01:35:54,900 --> 01:36:02,420
this game that feels like duck tales mega man bionic commando and a lot of the nes games of

1118
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:08,740
the era you know what i mean oh that guy just wall jumped right there the sprites uh style is

1119
01:36:08,740 --> 01:36:12,420
very similar to bionic commando i think stylistically duck tales of course has the

1120
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:16,420
disney touch yes of course yeah stylistically i think bionic commando is probably the best

1121
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:24,580
comparison in this game yeah yeah but but and i'll be honest you know my i i i had never seen

1122
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:32,820
this when i was a kid um my first exposure to strider was totally dying on the first stage in

1123
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:39,540
an arcade um and then you know dan's sitting me down when i moved out here and says you're

1124
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:47,700
required to play this and i beat it i love i love that these are the requirements uh to date

1125
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:55,300
number one you will beat strider there were a few requirements number one was don't smoke number two

1126
01:36:56,020 --> 01:37:03,700
beat strider reasonable number three was playing through uh castlevania symphony of the night

1127
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:13,300
again reasonable very reasonable all all games that i've beaten and you know except for smoking

1128
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:17,540
because that's disgusting and i won't do it so well and how many years have you been together

1129
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:27,060
as a result 23 this month there you go there you go me personally living in this state on the 23rd

1130
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:28,580
oh oh it's your golden year

1131
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:34,900
all right it's it's the it's the year of consequence uh anything else

1132
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:42,500
is the number of consequence anything else to say about strider um i guess play it if you have it

1133
01:37:43,060 --> 01:37:50,420
um then you'll see why uh why it makes me cry that's no good music in it though yeah it does

1134
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:55,540
have some really good music i think it's it's it's worth checking the manga is really good though

1135
01:37:55,540 --> 01:38:02,580
it's worth checking out just to see how starkly different the games are and the fact that they

1136
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:07,060
were of like the the same you know intellectual property essentially they're two very different

1137
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:16,020
games one of you know but i actually did really enjoy the manga it was oh god not the same story

1138
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:21,780
that was the wall jump part i and that guy just did it flawlessly i can't watch it it'll affect

1139
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:28,180
my internet um but i mean the manga was pretty good i look at it as just like a completely

1140
01:38:28,180 --> 01:38:32,100
different universe from the main continuity because the main continuity is from the arcade

1141
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:35,700
version followed by strider 2 and then there is the remake from that series so

1142
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:40,900
i like how every single person that's in this or every single uh sprite or enemy drops

1143
01:38:44,020 --> 01:38:48,660
what do you mean just drops it just drops like they spawn in they drop

1144
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:54,660
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah there's a lot of graphical bugs in this game but on on an old tv keep in mind

1145
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:59,300
a lot of the bugs you see on the perimeter or the outside edges keep in mind an old crt tv is going

1146
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:04,900
to hide that so it didn't it looks bad now it looks worse than it did back then when you were

1147
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:08,980
playing it on an old tv because you can't see some of those graphical bugs that are on the edges

1148
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:15,460
that's interesting all right wait that was it there it is your classic game of the week strider

1149
01:39:15,460 --> 01:39:21,700
the nes version specifically all right thank you dark soccer for that pick let's get into

1150
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:26,260
some rapid fire news and travel around the gaming world and see what else is happening this week

1151
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:35,780
loki it's all mods so uh first we have this ridiculous snowboard mod for witcher 3 which

1152
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:42,900
is hilarious it allows you to add a snowboard to uh jarl's inventory and looks like it works almost

1153
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:52,580
like the shield in um breath of the wild i need to play this now um so yeah it's pretty awesome

1154
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:57,140
if you want to check it out nexus mods of course and then of course there's a first person mod

1155
01:39:57,860 --> 01:40:04,420
for moral combat 11 so that's kind of uh uh interesting that's like a straight out of the

1156
01:40:04,420 --> 01:40:10,820
street fighter playbook there yeah then fps oh yeah that's switch version yeah yeah yeah so

1157
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:18,180
um actually i think the 3ds one had that too but yeah so that's also something you can uh

1158
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:24,820
check out as well um pretty cool well i don't know how many of you had the super nintendo port

1159
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:30,740
of street fighter alpha 2 because most people stuck to the saturn or the playstation if they

1160
01:40:30,740 --> 01:40:36,180
were going to play this game but there was a super nintendo cartridge version of it uh and get this

1161
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:44,260
after 25 years a cheat code has been discovered for this game uh it it was reversed engineered

1162
01:40:44,260 --> 01:40:51,780
and has been discovered that on the tie if you put k a j in the high score table go to the title

1163
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:57,860
screen and hold down lxy and start on the second controller that's a lot you will be able to play

1164
01:40:57,860 --> 01:41:05,380
the game as shin akuma so that is that is something that's been hiding in that game all this time

1165
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:11,620
what'd you say this game you own this game i own this game you should check it out maybe so

1166
01:41:11,620 --> 01:41:16,260
although i always joke about this game as being like one of the first cartridge games ever played

1167
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:21,940
that had load time yeah right yeah um yeah i i figured you would have skipped the super

1168
01:41:21,940 --> 01:41:26,500
nintendo i know you're a street fighter you know type of gal obviously sakura came from somewhere

1169
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:32,020
i didn't have anything else i had a mess that was the best thing i had before i got here okay

1170
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:37,780
okay i just borrowed my friend's playstation forever but i i didn't move out here with

1171
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:42,660
anything new except i owned a copy of final fantasy 7 and that was like it yeah why why

1172
01:41:42,660 --> 01:41:48,580
oh and dragon ball gt yyr in chat says holy crap it's no wonder nobody ever found it naturally and

1173
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:52,020
it kind of makes me wonder why was it there in the first place and usually with these cheat

1174
01:41:52,020 --> 01:41:55,620
codes the way it worked back in the day is that if they weren't found or they weren't you know

1175
01:41:55,620 --> 01:42:03,380
whatever within about a year the cheat codes get leaked by the developer to to draw interest in the

1176
01:42:03,380 --> 01:42:08,260
game again and get the coverage in the magazines and all that stuff so it's weird that it took 25

1177
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:12,340
years in reverse engineering to figure this one out especially when we're talking about another

1178
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:19,620
character in the game that's a big fucking deal anyway act f says the super nintendo port of

1179
01:42:19,620 --> 01:42:24,260
street fighter alpha 2 is a technical prowess yeah for sure i've played that on super nintendo and

1180
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:29,940
it's a miracle that it runs that's for sure but maybe that's also it is that you know that was

1181
01:42:29,940 --> 01:42:37,220
really one of the last games on super nintendo uh 96 when that came out right super nintendo

1182
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:43,460
was really on its way out the door at that point so um yeah all right anyway um also on its way

1183
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:50,660
out the door netflix not totally just the version that's on the wii u and the 3ds eshop uh the

1184

1189
01:43:21,620 --> 01:43:27,060
netflix there's some older tvs that won't run it anymore and stuff too so and to be able to do

1190
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:31,460
things like uh bandersnatch and some of the other things that they're doing with netflix they have

1226
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:36,340
motorcross video game on playstation nice that'd be it all right let's get back into some other

1227
01:47:36,340 --> 01:47:46,660
news loki so apparently uh the roblox corporation the creators of roblox have valued themselves

1228
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:54,500
at almost 30 billion dollars after a recent round of investments um of course they still haven't

1229
01:47:54,500 --> 01:48:01,380
um listed themselves directly yet on the actual stock market but um so far investing seems to be

1230
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:07,540
going pretty well i know my kids play constantly so i wouldn't be surprised i hear about that game

1231
01:48:07,540 --> 01:48:12,340
a lot so and i i've never really gotten into it myself but because i think it's i'm not the right

1232
01:48:12,340 --> 01:48:17,700
audience for it but uh it's definitely not what i'm into yeah but i mean cool hey you know it

1233
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:25,620
seems like kids learn a lot from it so all right yeah um something else you can learn a lot with

1234
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:32,740
how to use a twitter avatar to play video games so this is very similar to maybe like uh twitch

1235
01:48:32,740 --> 01:48:39,700
plays pokemon but instead it's being done with somebody's twitter avatar via twitter now they

1236
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:44,660
didn't suddenly figure out how to get like a fully animated twitter avatar that plays out in

1237
01:48:44,660 --> 01:48:51,700
real time but what's happening is that it's a bot that essentially updates a screenshot in an avatar

1238
01:48:51,700 --> 01:49:01,140
of pokemon red every 15 seconds so what you do you reply to a tweet and every 15 seconds it scans

1239
01:49:01,140 --> 01:49:06,580
the replies to that tweet and the button press that got the most tweets is the button that is

1240
01:49:06,580 --> 01:49:12,420
pressed and the avatar is updated and there it goes it's like the old ass webcam from olr's

1241
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:19,940
second or third year it updates every 15 seconds but that's what it is and it it's a clever way to

1242
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:25,940
do uh another type of twitch plays pokemon experiment which was the whole it goes back

1243
01:49:25,940 --> 01:49:35,620
to the whole um what is the analogy can a can a an animal type a novel if you leave a typewriter

1244
01:49:35,620 --> 01:49:40,500
in front of it or something like that like eventually it will type a novel uh eventually

1245
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:46,660
twitter will beat pokemon red because eventually twitch did too with the help of supers superheroes

1246
01:49:46,660 --> 01:49:52,900
ah and what were the big pokemon names but like they all had ridiculous names because none of

1247
01:49:52,900 --> 01:50:00,500
it made sense so yeah oh there was the helix thing oh yeah that was a big thing yeah uh

1248
01:50:01,140 --> 01:50:06,500
jesus s 200 matt says i remember that webcam it was pointed at the guest couch right

1249
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:12,340
yeah it was um so loki had actually built an old arcade cabinet and so the camera was on top of

1250
01:50:12,340 --> 01:50:18,660
the cabinet and pointed towards the couch that's how it is yeah dartitsu says something like a

1251
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:23,060
thousand monkeys will eventually type shakespeare it's some it's something along those lines i

1252
01:50:23,060 --> 01:50:29,140
forget anyway um whatever happened to that cabinet look i think it was fucking gigantic

1253
01:50:29,940 --> 01:50:36,260
oh i just mantled it when i moved to the second apartment complex because it was upstairs and no

1254
01:50:37,620 --> 01:50:45,860
no no not moving that upstairs it was too big i never built it uh anyway i think uh what is what

1255
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:50,660
is the linked i think it's a screen shakes is the twitter account if you want to check this out i'm

1256
01:50:50,660 --> 01:50:54,820
trying to trying to load that up now and verify and actually maybe get a peek at where they're

1257
01:50:54,820 --> 01:51:01,780
at in the game right now um but that is that is the account i believe yeah screen shakes is the

1258
01:51:01,780 --> 01:51:08,660
one and um i can't tell where they're at based on the avatar my knowledge of pokemon is not

1259
01:51:08,660 --> 01:51:14,660
that good i'd ask shane to help but he didn't like gen 1 although he still probably knows looks like

1260
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:19,540
they're in some sort of town it's loading very slowly for me but yeah screen shake is the account

1261
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:27,220
you can do uh to get in on that if you want to play some pokemon on twitter moving on i believed

1262
01:51:27,220 --> 01:51:33,780
our soccer is next well i might be look my mic's not moving i figured out what the problem was

1263
01:51:33,780 --> 01:51:40,740
um anyway uh epics games uh they have just recently announced the acquisition of a video

1264
01:51:40,740 --> 01:51:51,140
game software development company rad game tools um they're uh they basically were saying that um

1265
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:59,540
that they are looking for them to assist with more photorealistic uh games and that they uh

1266
01:51:59,540 --> 01:52:04,340
that they're going to be partnering with epics rendering animation insights and audio teams

1267
01:52:04,420 --> 01:52:12,020
to bring that technology um into uh unreal engine and beyond that so they really uh

1268
01:52:12,020 --> 01:52:19,140
like what they do and say they're gonna play nice with them by buying them sounds pretty rad

1269
01:52:21,940 --> 01:52:26,980
all right uh but that's not the only thing we have to say about epic games right logan

1270
01:52:27,940 --> 01:52:34,660
uh right because as is the trend with a lot of this uh coronavirus and everything is that a lot

1271
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:41,700
of malls aren't doing great especially since nobody can shop in them and in general i know

1272
01:52:41,700 --> 01:52:49,060
we have a local mall over here that's about ready to be shut down and bulldozed but um my childhood

1273
01:52:50,020 --> 01:52:59,780
apparently the uh terry town or the carrytown center which is a 980 000 square foot um site

1274
01:53:00,820 --> 01:53:07,460
and apparently it is this mall that epic is looking to purchase and they're going to

1275
01:53:08,180 --> 01:53:16,900
make that their brand new campus for um epic games and so they're going to open it in uh 2024

1276
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:23,220
uh after they refurbish and rebuild the area so i don't know if they're going to tear down a lot

1277
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:28,660
of that stuff but they're at least going to use the area to build their brand new campus but i

1278
01:53:28,660 --> 01:53:34,500
could see them like kind of just reusing them all well i hope they keep anti-ans like you know

1279
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:40,100
there's certain there's certain things in the mall that really should stay that maybe the employees

1280
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:47,940
will want to enjoy just based on you know looking at everything it the mall is pretty damn it yeah

1281
01:53:47,940 --> 01:53:52,980
it looks like sunrise mall that's what she's saying it looks like our mall yeah or pretty much

1282
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:58,020
i can't help but think about that uh billy eilish is that her name that video or i always say

1283
01:53:58,020 --> 01:54:04,260
william eyelash like um in the sketch that was outside my life um but uh her video have you seen

1284
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:07,780
that video where she's in the mall and she's just dancing around to see because the mall is

1285
01:54:07,780 --> 01:54:12,580
completely empty and then but for some reason all the food stuff seems to be open so she just

1286
01:54:12,580 --> 01:54:19,060
she just walks into anti-ans grabs a pretzel goes to potle gets a bag of chips and i love it because

1287
01:54:19,060 --> 01:54:23,780
it's just this whole like i'm just gonna eat all this stuff energy and i don't know what she's

1288
01:54:23,780 --> 01:54:30,740
trying to say with the video but i love it yeah i i do like the pretzel places like if if somebody

1289
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:36,900
would work just all that stuff outside of like you know in the mall because man like there's

1290
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:43,700
some of those like the uh it wasn't anti-ans they used to go to it was um cinnabon pretzel

1291
01:54:43,700 --> 01:54:50,980
no it's pretzel time okay oh the other one okay and um like those things are so soaked in butter

1292
01:54:52,020 --> 01:54:57,300
they're amazing like i would just like so our local grocery store chain over here really

1293
01:54:57,300 --> 01:55:01,220
actually started selling giant pretzels out of their bakery so that's pretty good but they're

1294
01:55:01,220 --> 01:55:06,820
not as they're not butter so like that stuff i mean like like going to wintels when i go to yeah

1295
01:55:07,060 --> 01:55:14,100
disneyland yeah so like now wintels um is it wintels pretzels pretzels pretzels pretzels yes

1296
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:21,220
um yeah i need i need someone to sell them like that not the good pretzels like you know the

1297
01:55:21,220 --> 01:55:27,460
actual pretzels that you make the german pretzels but like i want the buttery ones that's what

1298
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:32,660
because like was it um the dairy queen bought up orange julius i'm just about to make an orange

1299
01:55:33,220 --> 01:55:40,020
for a while and they were gonna have uh orange julius and and now they've discontinued the

1300
01:55:40,020 --> 01:55:43,620
machines there too i'm like where the hell am i gonna get my orange julius now it's not in the

1301
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:49,140
mall it's not dairy queen i mean yeah i can make it to a home like i know how to make those but

1302
01:55:49,140 --> 01:55:55,220
like the authentic ones so like i can't get that anymore because they shut them all down

1303
01:55:55,220 --> 01:55:59,460
um as jonah matt mentions the piercing pagoda will be across from hr

1304
01:55:59,700 --> 01:56:10,180
things though with people buying the uh um store like buying the malls and turning them into uh

1305
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:16,980
housing like transitional housing for the homeless i've heard of that too huh yeah i like that better

1306
01:56:16,980 --> 01:56:20,500
i just love the imagery of epic moving into a mall it's just kind of like you know oh you need

1307
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:28,900
to get to finance okay just go through claire's um make a ride at sabaro all right teach your mom

1308
01:56:28,900 --> 01:56:34,020

1309
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:39,140
goody neither of those exist anymore they don't time they don't oh fucking a all right

1310
01:56:40,580 --> 01:56:45,380
true story i think i bought my last 45 i ever bought it a sam goody

1311
01:56:46,260 --> 01:56:50,820
the hot dog on the stick stand will be run by the ios app developers

1312
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:57,780
all right enough enough mall jokes next there's a suncoast

1313
01:56:59,540 --> 01:57:04,900
there's still a suncoast i'm like the fuck where the what the one side well there's still a

1314
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:10,420
blockbuster that's still on my to-do list if the pandemic doesn't finish it off i'd love to go but

1315
01:57:10,420 --> 01:57:16,580
i think the last blockbuster up in oregon that's now their whole like mo they have made it their

1316
01:57:16,580 --> 01:57:19,860
thing it's like we're a tourist destination now because we're the last blockbuster

1317
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:25,700
the last blockbuster in the village that's right i am the only blockbuster

1318
01:57:29,460 --> 01:57:35,380
i just remember that suncoast was the only place that i could go in and buy subbed anime yes back

1319
01:57:35,380 --> 01:57:42,740
in the day yes because i did not i i don't know there's a lot of people have a fun place for that

1320
01:57:42,740 --> 01:57:52,020
you know mid 90s late 90s uh uh um voice acting uh you know dubbed voice acting but keep in mind

1321
01:57:52,020 --> 01:57:56,660
that a lot of the stuff that i started watching was like taped off of tv in japan or you know

1322
01:57:56,740 --> 01:58:02,980
off of tv in japan or you know sixth generation old fan subs so i wanted to continue with some

1323
01:58:02,980 --> 01:58:07,780
of the series that were now being commercially released with the same voices and it was the only

1324
01:58:07,780 --> 01:58:15,300
place that i could go get my ranma vhs tapes fansubbed not fansubbed just subtitled so and

1325
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:21,300
they always cost more um i never got why they cost more dart tsuyin chat says i've seen people

1326
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:26,340
do youtube vids making the trek to the last blockbuster video you know when i was doing

1327
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:29,780
that road trip where i went to go visit shane back in like september october something like

1328
01:58:29,780 --> 01:58:34,740
that i really considered taking a detour through oregon so i could go there but it would have added

1329
01:58:34,740 --> 01:58:39,620
like six hours to my trip i needed another day so i could do it like it just wasn't gonna happen

1330
01:58:39,620 --> 01:58:45,220
that time but uh yeah one of these days uh when covet's over uh dark sakura we'll go on a road

1331
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:52,420
trip all right sounds funny we'll go up there and we'll get some act popcorn with butter what was

1332
01:58:52,420 --> 01:58:59,540
the brand they sold in those stores all right anyway act one no they no act you can still get

1333
01:58:59,540 --> 01:59:06,260
act popcorn in the grocery store rob yeah okay well that normal what can what can i get that's

1334
01:59:06,260 --> 01:59:14,020
like specifically is the word oregonian uh anything with no sales tax someone else to

1335
01:59:14,020 --> 01:59:19,940

1336
01:59:19,940 --> 01:59:26,340
a year anyway when we went to to prosser washington to see danza and voodoo donuts

1337

1339
01:59:41,780 --> 01:59:49,700
my subtitled anime i love it and the raw version of uh that was like three generations old

1340
01:59:49,940 --> 01:59:57,780
of legend of the overfiend that we would uh make up our own uh dialogue to all right last story

1341
01:59:57,780 --> 02:00:04,260
tonight maybe suncoast would be exhibiting here at least attending if they were uh if they have

1342
02:00:04,260 --> 02:00:09,860
more than one store left but there is consumer electronics show this week that's right it is

1343

1344
02:00:16,100 --> 02:00:22,900
nope ces 2021 it's virtual just like uh everything else has been for the past year or so uh somebody

1345
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:26,500

1346
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:30,660
march much like a lot of you march was the last time we were all in the same room so

1347
02:00:30,660 --> 02:00:36,020
uh and you know there hasn't really been big conventions since then yes i there's been some

1348
02:00:36,020 --> 02:00:44,340
ones but i was sick so i think february you're right well i had that cruise i had pneumonia

1349
02:00:44,340 --> 02:00:49,540
i was on the cruise i think we did one more episode here in studio after the cruise but it

1350
02:00:49,540 --> 02:00:54,980
was just right it was just loki and i you were sick i soon remember that yeah that was the start

1351
02:00:54,980 --> 02:01:01,540
and i had pneumonia for like six months yeah yeah all right and then i had pneumonia again go fig

1352
02:01:02,180 --> 02:01:07,460
all right anyway um so ces is going to be virtual this year uh there'll be you know like live

1353
02:01:07,460 --> 02:01:12,260
virtual showrooms live stream events and things like that uh and you know what honestly this year

1354
02:01:12,260 --> 02:01:15,940
you have a lot of companies that are just releasing stuff kind of early but you're not

1355
02:01:15,940 --> 02:01:21,620
going to be able to go to a room to see televisions anymore uh the laptop pcs and accessories connected

1356
02:01:21,620 --> 02:01:27,300
homes drones robots transportation virtual cars that's all expected to go online and they're

1357
02:01:27,300 --> 02:01:35,140
saying it's going to be a slower quieter show fuck off covet 19 um but that is that is what it is all

1358
02:01:35,140 --> 02:01:39,380
about but we might still get some news out of it um somebody had brought up in chat earlier it's

1359
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:44,660
a good time for arcade one up to make some announcements usually um again a lot of those

1360
02:01:44,660 --> 02:01:48,500
like furniture in your house that do tech things this is a good time for that so we might get some

1361
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:53,700
updates and sort of some sort of those types of collectibles but i wouldn't expect i mean very

1362
02:01:53,700 --> 02:02:01,060
rarely do we get big gaming news at ces even if e3 was a spin-off of ces back in the day i would say

1363
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:05,540
the last big thing i remember ces was when microsoft game room was announced rest in peace

1364
02:02:05,540 --> 02:02:09,380
they did announce that at ces but i i don't i don't think anything like that's going to happen

1365
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:17,220
not this year so all right um anyhow that brings us closer to the end of the show but before we

1366
02:02:17,220 --> 02:02:21,540
wrap up we like to check in with the listeners in the segment we call the listener round table so

1367
02:02:21,540 --> 02:02:26,340
um and i'm sorry the headline is wrong it's just a chat mailbag um because this is the part of the

1368
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:30,980
show where we like to visit our mailbag as well every week we invite you guys to participate

1369
02:02:30,980 --> 02:02:35,860
participate at orange laundry.com is the place to send us emails and dark sakura will pick

1370
02:02:35,860 --> 02:02:40,500
um some to read on air if she has any one all right so let's let's get to our email tonight

1371
02:02:41,380 --> 02:02:46,820
all right um hello peoples during our time of social distancing i've gotten into cocktail

1372
02:02:46,820 --> 02:02:52,100
mixing the mixology app has been a great aid in this there is nothing that compares to the mixology

1373
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:57,620
app on ios as far as cocktail mixing apps go there's nothing like it on android at all mixology

1374
02:02:57,620 --> 02:03:03,460
did not pay me to send this email this brings to mind a topic for the round table there are many

1375
02:03:03,460 --> 02:03:08,180
examples of games that are exclusive to one platform for which there are no comparison in

1376
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:17,940
their genre which examples spring to your mind um i wish the emailer flash i wish the emailer given

1377
02:03:17,940 --> 02:03:24,740
us an example read that question one more time a genre that only exists on one no no no so there

1378
02:03:24,740 --> 02:03:32,580
are there's no comparison in their genre okay okay so i guess there's nothing really like

1379
02:03:32,580 --> 02:03:37,780
jumping flash on another system and it's just the first thing that sprang to mind um

1380
02:03:40,100 --> 02:03:45,140
um go back to the roots well i was gonna say the roots of the show the bimani stuff was always like

1381
02:03:45,140 --> 02:03:48,820
on playstation you didn't really see it anywhere else but then i guess rock band and guitar hero

1382
02:03:48,820 --> 02:03:53,380
kind of broke that mold and did um kind of put it everywhere because then my brain kind of goes to

1383
02:03:53,380 --> 02:03:58,660
those you know parappa the rapa but then again sega did have some pretty badass music games of

1384
02:03:58,660 --> 02:04:05,060
their own back in the day they were just very different um well you know what honestly fuck

1385
02:04:05,060 --> 02:04:10,900
go back to the dreamcast and look at a lot of those games we don't have anything like where's

1386
02:04:10,900 --> 02:04:18,340
where's samba de amigo where's uh space channel five where's crazy taxi i would say yeah you know

1387
02:04:18,340 --> 02:04:23,060
what those are my answers a lot of those like obscure sega dreamcast games that we love i don't

1388
02:04:23,140 --> 02:04:27,620
think we've seen anything unless the thing to keep in mind until they get ported to other stuff later

1389
02:04:27,620 --> 02:04:33,540
sorry is it a lot of those more obscure dreamcast games had a lot of their start in the arcade

1390
02:04:34,980 --> 02:04:42,740
yeah so and they could port their own games and but at the time sega was doing interesting things

1391
02:04:42,740 --> 02:04:47,540
in the arcades with um you know i i wish we had gotten like something for jumbo safari or

1392
02:04:47,620 --> 02:04:53,700
something for example that's another good one yeah but we were getting um you know the dreamcast

1393
02:04:53,700 --> 02:05:01,380
was essentially you know scaled down naomi uh hardware it would play the naomi games so i mean

1394
02:05:01,380 --> 02:05:06,100
the biggest thing that i was always pissed off that we never got was planet harrier on dreamcast

1395
02:05:06,980 --> 02:05:14,340
someone if someone like could convert that i would pay for it um but yeah i think that just more goes

1396
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:18,580
in line with what sega was doing at that time but it's a good example i mean because we weren't

1397
02:05:18,580 --> 02:05:23,540
getting some of those same types of games on other systems um shane is pointing out in chat space

1398
02:05:23,540 --> 02:05:28,180
channel five had a vr release sequel thing not that long ago that's true you know i guess i guess

1399
02:05:28,180 --> 02:05:33,300
we have revisited those things a few times to move oh that's a good answer too that's a good one the

1400
02:05:33,300 --> 02:05:38,260
best to move series um my brain also went to how about that we haven't seen this in quite a long

1401
02:05:38,260 --> 02:05:42,900
time something like okay but i know i know what somebody somebody in chat is going to respond to

1402
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:49,780
this instantly i will get there please point blank for uh you know that whole series and the

1403
02:05:49,780 --> 02:05:57,300
light gun genre in general we haven't seen that in a very long time now i've heard sharp shooter

1404
02:05:57,300 --> 02:06:03,060
but you know he i was here's where yyr brings up sharpshooter yes yes thank you for pointing out

1405
02:06:03,060 --> 02:06:09,860
also why yr that uh planet harrier karu and not naomi yeah so but i'm just saying something

1406
02:06:09,860 --> 02:06:15,700
something really back in that kind of like namco you know a shooter type of thing we haven't that

1407
02:06:15,700 --> 02:06:19,780
was kind of unique to that and we haven't seen anything like that in a long time i guess so no

1408
02:06:19,780 --> 02:06:27,300
namco is doing like the giant arcade ticket spitter thing so which is weird that's a tough question i

1409
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:30,420
would have need i would need more time to think about that did the email or give us any of their

1410
02:06:30,420 --> 02:06:36,900
own examples no well i you need to email back who is it i'll get to it when i finish the email

1411
02:06:36,900 --> 02:06:42,500
all right go on please proceed also i'm intrigued about the possibility of the kentucky fried

1412
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:47,140

1414
02:06:52,980 --> 02:06:58,180
all right redertainment you email us back i i need i need your examples to this question that's

1415
02:06:58,180 --> 02:07:05,220
a tough question but you know what you know what a feature of the kfc console maybe a console warmer

1416
02:07:05,220 --> 02:07:09,540
is what we need on other uh consoles maybe it's maybe it's not the games it's the features

1417
02:07:10,980 --> 02:07:16,260
why would you want your consoles to be warmer did did you not just talk about how you wanted

1418
02:07:16,260 --> 02:07:21,460
the kfc console last week on the show to warm your chicken my chicken but i don't want something to

02:07:21,460 --> 02:07:26,820
warm the console all right okay all right yes a warmer in the car if you know what i mean all

1420
02:07:26,820 --> 02:07:33,860
right well the actual exhaust from cooling this yes yes but i wouldn't put i wouldn't put chicken

1421
02:07:33,860 --> 02:07:43,540

1428
02:08:21,300 --> 02:08:25,380
questions for us in chat for the round table before we uh move on and wrap up the show shane

1429
02:08:25,380 --> 02:08:30,100
is saying i would kill for a new bus to move game same in fact he was the one that brought over the

1430
02:08:30,260 --> 02:08:35,300
spiritual successor whose name i can't remember in the moment dance summit that's it dance summit

1431
02:08:35,300 --> 02:08:41,860
of which i finally own a copy oh right yeah i remember that yeah yeah uh twitch.tv slash

1432
02:08:41,860 --> 02:08:50,100
vog network bobby blackwolf asks rugby baby or baby rugby uh and again different things i don't

1433
02:08:50,100 --> 02:08:55,940
know what rugby baby is you need to find out no spoilers go look up the sequence from uh

1434
02:08:56,740 --> 02:09:01,940
awesome games done quick it's on youtube and rugby baby just because that's how i heard it

1435
02:09:01,940 --> 02:09:08,020
the first time and the thing is that i think that with and i don't want to spoil it but i think that

1436
02:09:08,020 --> 02:09:13,540
bobby's question rugby baby or baby rugby would actually be two completely different things that

1437
02:09:13,540 --> 02:09:17,380
you wouldn't say this you use the term interchangeably for the same thing i think

1438
02:09:17,380 --> 02:09:21,940
it would actually be two completely different concepts they would but again i don't want to

1439
02:09:21,940 --> 02:09:26,500
i don't want to spoil every your homework assignment is to go watch because i'm not

1440
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:31,300
going to protect you from spoilers next week audience all right okay so your homework

1441
02:09:31,300 --> 02:09:36,340
assignment is to go watch rugby baby because i will not protect you from spoilers next week

1442
02:09:36,340 --> 02:09:40,420
but but get this like the whole time that everyone was talking about that

1443
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:49,060
the baby monkey song was going into my head but i was singing rugby baby rugby baby you know so

1444
02:09:49,060 --> 02:09:54,900
yeah all right uh let's see um there was one that scrolled off the screen real quick before

02:09:54,900 --> 02:10:00,420
act if said something um oh sacred jade said scott pilgrim game physical release yeah we got

1446
02:10:00,420 --> 02:10:04,900

02:10:22,100 --> 02:10:28,260
what's a game you're looking forward to seeing released this year um good question i think a lot

1451
02:10:28,260 --> 02:10:35,300
of times we don't know about them yeah we don't know about them right now um yeah i i feel like

1452
02:10:35,300 --> 02:10:42,580
breath of the wild 2 this is the year for it and so that is the one i'm gonna say it's so hard we

1453
02:10:42,580 --> 02:10:46,740
just don't know what's coming out yet if starfield ends up being this year i'm very curious about

1454
02:10:46,740 --> 02:10:52,420
that i like space games i like the idea of a bethesda game in space i don't like the idea of

1455
02:10:52,420 --> 02:10:56,900
a buggy game in space so i hope they take the time to get it right so maybe it won't be this year

1456
02:10:56,900 --> 02:11:01,460
but um those are some titles off top my head that i'm looking forward to i'm trying to think i think

1457
02:11:01,460 --> 02:11:06,580
there's something in springtime i was looking forward to as well i can't remember them off top

1458
02:11:06,580 --> 02:11:15,460
my head so all right i can't really think of anything but breath of the wild 2 so yeah and my

1459
02:11:15,460 --> 02:11:21,860
possum game that someone's going to make pixel poops number two and and yeah pixel poops yyr

1460
02:11:21,860 --> 02:11:28,260
steam release and commodore release as well and so so when when they finally make this possum

1461
02:11:28,260 --> 02:11:34,260
game that you you're looking for and they decide to speed run it is it going to be possum games

1462
02:11:34,260 --> 02:11:41,780
done quick yeah yes there should be a special segment on eight on the next agdq called possum

1463
02:11:41,780 --> 02:11:51,060
games done quick uh s sj100 matt wants to know now that agdq is over uh among us vog edition when uh

1464
02:11:51,060 --> 02:11:57,860
soon trademark uh i am working on another vog project right now i uh i don't want to say much

1465
02:11:57,860 --> 02:12:04,820
more than that but it's coming soon trademark but yes that is on my my mind i wanted to do

1466
02:12:04,820 --> 02:12:09,460
more streaming this week and i think i actually did one that was the same time as awesome games

1467
02:12:09,460 --> 02:12:13,220
done quick but for obvious reasons i didn't want to do a lot and i certainly didn't want to do one

1468
02:12:13,220 --> 02:12:19,300
when bobby was going um so i i'm trying to get back in that habit but we did a really fun stream

1469
02:12:19,300 --> 02:12:25,780
uh of final fantasy 14 it was uh shad starzik and our buddy ray we were map hunting together and i

1470
02:12:25,780 --> 02:12:29,380
think we had a lot of fun with that because they built this whole thing in fantasy 14 where you

1471
02:12:29,380 --> 02:12:34,260
have like a big roulette wheel that spins in some map rooms and it's it's like a game show it's

1472
02:12:34,260 --> 02:12:39,700
really funny um so i'll try to do some more of that but um i also want to do like some dj max

1473
02:12:39,700 --> 02:12:44,260
streams and play some other games that aren't just final fantasy 14 although that one is uh

1474
02:12:44,260 --> 02:12:48,740
certainly a fun one to play all right well i think with that we're going to move to start to wrap up
