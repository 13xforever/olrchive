1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,260
As the years continue on, technology is only getting better, smaller, faster, and cheaper.

2
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,300
And that enables makers without access to high-end fabrication and materials to make

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,920
more and more impressive designs.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,780
Like, for example, a Nintendo 64 that is smaller than the original controller, screen included,

5
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,140
no permanent cables needed.

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,340
Praise be to those who have this kind of talent and commitment to pull off such an incredible

7
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,340
feat.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,580
That's the story in the first episode of 2021.

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,820
Join your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki for this and the rest of the New

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,500
Year's news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,780
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,580
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,500
It is Orange Lounge Radio, the very first show of 2021.

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:01:01,980
My name is Rob Roberts, here with you on January the 3rd of 2021 with my co-hosts.

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,860
I am just noticing I did the classic mistake at the beginning of the year, and it still

16
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:13,720
says 2020 up in the text here on Twitch, because we do tape live every Sunday night at twitch.tv

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,640
slash VOG Network, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby

18
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,000
Black Wolf show.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,920
And let's get that officially changed.

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,040
Yes, we are in 2021.

21
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,920
Anyway, episode 850 for this January the 3rd of 2021.

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:37,320
Again, I am Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

23
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,320
I'm

24
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,320
Hello.

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,320
Hi.

26
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,320
Hi.

27
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,320
How are you, Jamie?

28
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,320
I'm all right.

29
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,760
I've been fighting my new camera today and fighting my mic and fighting my headphones

30
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,080
and, you know, all kinds of garbage.

31
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,080
So yeah, but, but we're good.

32
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,080
Yeah.

33
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,520
You guys should have seen the scramble before the show and I thought we had her and then

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,520
it slipped for me.

35
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,520
That's right.

36
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,520
Uh, as you can see, I've got a new camera.

37
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,520
Yeah.

38
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,520
You look really good.

39
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,520
New camera.

40
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,520
Yeah.

41
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,520
Yeah.

42
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,220
It's just the thing is, is that, um, I don't have a long enough cable for it.

43
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,360
So it's nestled in an awkward spot until I can get it adjusted.

44
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,520
Yeah, but it works.

45
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,080
We get, we get the whole sense of your, your nerdy, your nerd cave that you have going

46
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,080
on there.

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
So it looks good.

48
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,080
Yeah.

49
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
Glad to see it.

50
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,400
Uh, I have my, uh, right behind me is that I finally got my supernatural shelf put together

51
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,080
and I realized I need another shelf for it.

52
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,680
One more shelf is never enough.

53
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,960
Uh, going to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, VOG network, because again, we

54
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,000
do tape live on Sunday nights over there, uh, pixel pocket saying, woo, new camera and

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,520
pod culture saying, I like the blue on that wall.

56
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
I do too.

57
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,520
It's a good color.

58
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
Blue.

59
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
Sorry.

60
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
Podcast folks.

61
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520
The color Matt painted it, but it's a good color.

62
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,360
It's a good, um, people don't always remember this used to be grandpa's house.

63
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
Yes.

64
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,340
I don't know if everybody knew that, but, or captain Matt, depending on which shows

65
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,960
you listen to, but yeah, so, um, now, um, what was I gonna say?

66
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,320
Oh, I was going to ask how your, how your new year's went.

67
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,040
Cause it was, it was kind of weird this year.

68
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,520
I mean, obviously with, with no parties or anything, but just, I watched the time square

69
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,080
thing on TV and it was so weird.

70
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,280
Did you partake in any of that?

71
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,760
Played crossing at midnight.

72
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,840
Oh, of course.

73
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,840
That's it.

74
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,800
I didn't, it, it, it actually wasn't even anything worth talking about.

75
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Yeah.

76
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,280
The, well, the, the animation and animal crossing was super cute.

77
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,560
I saw, um, like a lot of people were doing the clips and putting it, you know, cause

78
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,160
Nintendo has the share thing.

79
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,100
So a lot of people were putting it on Twitter that way.

80
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,240
And I seem to remember making a quip that, um, the, the animal crossing parties looked

81
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,160
a little more hopping than time square did this year.

82
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,600
So it was, uh, it was cute.

83
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,520
I loved the way Nintendo did it.

84
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
It's super cute.

85
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:06,560
Well, I mean, I liked the music in it, I reckon, um, we really, uh, it, the music is actually

86
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,580
what made me kind of happy with new year and then, um, but for the most part, I just wasn't

87
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,580
feeling it.

88
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,780
I haven't really been feeling any holiday, anything.

89
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:23,100
Um, I hear you, but there's also, I mean, there's been some, uh, some personal drama

90
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:29,980
around those lines just with, you know, uh, anniversary of people who we've lost and sure

91
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,980
things like that.

92
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,100
So, well, um, let here's hoping that there is, is light at the end of the tunnel for

93
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,100
2021.

94
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,620
And, you know, we can all, we can all get our vaccines and, and bring OLR back together

95
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,820
again, uh, later this year, whenever it may be, and I don't think we have any realistic

96
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,820
timeframe yet.

97
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,140
Um, we'll do it when it's safe for those that are curious, like when's, when's the gang

98
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,140
going to get back together?

99
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,020
Uh, I'd like to know that too, but there's a lot of factors.

100
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,580
So we're just going to keep doing what we're doing in the meantime, which is, uh, worked

101
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,700
out for us, um, through 2020 best it could, uh, let's go on these lines.

102
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,940
We were still together just virtually, virtually together at home.

103
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,940
Yes.

104
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,940
That whole thing.

105
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,940
Absolutely.

106
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,620
Um, just a little bit last week, like, um, you know, uh, I, I was always kind of skeptical

107
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,380
of the idea if it would really work and I'm not sure that technology was really there

108
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,140
even like three, four years ago before disco cord was so commonplace now.

109
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,260
Um, I don't think we could have done this over Skype as easy.

110
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,260
I really don't.

111
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,900
Um, but I think some of the newer things, you know, zoom, I guess we could have used

112
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,660
this or everybody else is using stream yard, not stuff, but, um, uh, I really think the

113
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,580
technologies, thank heavens were there for shows like us and many others, uh, right at

114
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,300
the right time for sure.

115
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,220
So, um, yeah.

116
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,420
And I hope you guys are all staying safe out there as well.

117
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,380
Um, also I did, I should know, well, let me, I'll note it in a minute.

118
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,220
Let me also introduce, I don't make him sit there anymore.

119
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,380
Say hello to tech master.

120
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,380
Loki.

121
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,380
Hello.

122
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,380
Hi.

123
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,380
How are you?

124
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,380
I'm fine.

125
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,380
Sorry.

126
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,380
Jamie and I had to dish.

127
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,900
Uh, you had a big start to the year.

128
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,260
We've got to, we got to talk about this.

129
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,660
You dropped something big.

130
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:17,660
You took a big crap at the end of the year, but like, you know, uh, there was some, some

131
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,380
bugs that I didn't anticipate that I had to fix, but yeah, I tell us about, I released,

132
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:29,300
I released a, uh, new year's, uh, New Year's Eve, what was New Year's Eve, um, demo for

133
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,420
a pixel poops too.

134
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:36,820
So it's got five brand new levels, uh, a few of which that are new year's themes.

135
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:42,260
And I have like a fun, uh, color changing thing to go along with that and stuff.

136
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,520
So it's, it's available now.

137
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,320
You can download it and play it and check it out.

138
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:56,940
And it's available over on itch.io on your page, which it's a techmastergames.itch.io.

139
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,740
It's also linked in Discord and on my social media and all that stuff.

140
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,740
Nice.

141
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,740
Well, congratulations.

142
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,100
I did download it and check it out and you have to, you have to have, um, very specific

143
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,340
emulators to run it.

144
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:15,280
But I, so I used one of the ones you said, yeah, messin's really the best way to go with

145
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
that.

146
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:22,260
Um, I'm going to put together, there's this thing called nest tech, um, that one of the

147
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,200
guys in the community that made this game flee put together to actually publish his

148
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,960
games on steam.

149
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,000
And so it's kind of a wrapper for NES games.

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,560
And so it works okay.

151
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,600
Um, I actually checked it out to try to do that.

152
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,800
So I'm just going to set that up and I'll put that up as another download as well.

153
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Nice.

154
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,440
And then that way you don't have to worry about trying to find the emulator and get

155
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,000
your stuff configured.

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,760
You can just load it and it'll go.

157
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,640
And so that'd be another way to try it out.

158
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,920
Um, I'll be coming soon.

159
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,480
I, I, I, um, downloaded it and I played a little bit, but I didn't play too much because

160
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,640
I want to do a Twitch stream of it.

161
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,560
And that'll happen soon with awesome games done quick this week.

162
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,360
It might not happen until next week, but that's, that's on the agenda.

163
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,200
I want to, I want to stream Loki's game because here we are, it's been what, like three years.

164
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,120
And now I'm sitting here going, I played Loki's game.

165
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
I did.

166
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,520
I can say that here's how we're starting 2021.

167
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,200
I played Loki's game and you have a few folks in chat who checked it out as well.

168
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
So congrats.

169
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Yeah.

170
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,240
So I tried to make it difficult because it is going to be, you know, um, it obviously

171
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,320
like if I was just to release the first few levels I had made so far, like in my actual

172
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,320
game, um, it wouldn't be difficult at all, but I just tried to ramp up the difficulty

173
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,600
as each level went on and it also changed the way that the continues work because typically

174
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,280
in the main game, it's going to be, you know, if you continue within like, say a span of

175
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,760
like 10 levels, it resets you back to the beginning of whatever world you're in.

176
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,880
And since this is like a five level demo, it is just resets you back to whatever level

177
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,440
you're in and you get three continues.

178
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:09,120
Although, I mean, I'm sure you could figure out a way to get more continued if, if, if

179
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,360
you use, you know, certain methods that you might've used in, say, I don't know, Contra

180
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:22,560
or, okay, shine a fucking spotlight on it, low-key.

181
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
But that's okay.

182
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,960
So the Konami code does work, so give it a try.

183
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
All right.

184
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,360
Um, and so I just tried to make it a little bit challenging and I have actually ramped

185
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,500
the difficulty down in the last level because I had the spawn time a little bit tighter.

186
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,220
So it was spawning much faster and it got really, really difficult.

187
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,740
So I had to ramp it down because I do want people to actually be able to complete it.

188
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,740
Okay.

189
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,340
So, well, I'm, uh, I'm excited for you to release the full game and it sounds like you

190
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,820
have different ways you can approach it.

191
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,060
Like whether you do like a steam wrapper type of thing.

192
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,080
And of course you had talked about doing some limited, very, very limited cartridge runs

193
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,080
as well.

194
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,940
And I know some of our folks will be into that and, and we'll hear more about that throughout

195
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,940
the year, but congrats.

196
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:12,900
I did commission artwork for the, um, the actual, um, cartridges themselves and possibly

197
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,080
packaging and stuff like that.

198
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,820
So I've actually be coming in a few weeks, but yeah, it, it it'll be fun.

199
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,820
I'm excited.

200
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,100
Now we get to say game developer, Loki.

201
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,900
You're no longer tech master, Loki, your game developer, Loki.

202
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,900
Okay.

203
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,460
All right.

204
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,460
Anyway.

205
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,020
Uh, let's get into some news.

206
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,940
Well, let's be, let's be honest, the news this week is a little bit lighter, um, as

207
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,940
it usually is.

208
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,940
A little?

209
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,940
Yeah.

210
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,940
I know this, I'm going to be real.

211
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,980
We, we have a few things to talk about and we will, but the news that like the types

212
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,420
of news items we have tonight would probably be like rapid fire any other week.

213
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:53,220
So it's, it's, it's, you know, there's not a lot going on because of, uh, new, the new

214
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,540
year and the holiday and, and what have you, it's just this, the site, most people probably

215
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,580
in the game industry are just off this week.

216
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:04,400
In fact, a lot of, uh, journalists and people that report on the industry are off this week.

217
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,460
Even if we're all, you know, staying at home, well, a, we know not everybody stayed at home,

218
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,820
unfortunately, but B, even if you're staying at home, it's still good to take a break.

219
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,220
You don't want to necessarily be working, you know, 365 a year.

220
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,540
So the industry slowed down this week with the new year and everything.

221
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,300
So the news is slowing down as well.

222
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,680
There's a few things that we'll get into it, but this is a really good time for us to take

223
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,580
a look back on 2020.

224
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,620
I know as much as we want to avoid it.

225
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,620
Um, I think there was a great comic out there and I know I shared it on Twitter and Jamie,

226
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,540
I saw you posted it on Facebook.

227
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,540
It was a, it was a great comic that was, uh, and I'm sorry, I forget the artist's name,

228
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,460
but it showed the year 2020 like talking to the grim reaper or something going was, was

229
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,020
I a good year?

230
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:53,620
And the grim reaper goes, no, Jesus Christ, fuck no, even though it's like the little

231
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,660
dog one.

232
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,660
Was I a good boy?

233
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,660
Yes.

234
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,660
It was a, it was a parody of that.

235
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,660
Yeah, exactly.

236
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:04,140
Um, it was that which when you wait, I know we don't want to look back on 2020, but when

237
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,220
it comes to games, there were some pretty good ones and this is always a fun thing for

238
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,220
us to do.

239
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,860
And I'm sure half the shows, if not more that you listen to are doing something similar.

240
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,220
And that is to look back on our favorite games of the year.

241
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,580
And I don't like to say the best games of the year or the definitive, no, because everybody's

242
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,200
got their own opinions.

243
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,620
These are our favorite games of the year and there's nothing you can do about it, period.

244
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:33,300
Um, and you know what, sometimes a game might sneak in there that didn't actually come out

245
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,300
this year.

246
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,940
Uh, I mean, look at among us, right?

247
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,340
I mean, that game has been getting lots of accolades this year.

248
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:46,060
Technically that came out in 2018 some people take issue with Hades and the early access

249
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,180
to that game.

250
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,740
Not really a 2020 game.

251
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,400
Those rules do not apply here at OLR.

252
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,280
They are our favorite games of 2020.

253
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,840
Um, usually we would go around and go like three, three, three, two, two, two, one,

254
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
one, one.

255
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,440
But I think I just want to, you know, with, with the crazy year it's been and the interesting

256
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,040
game releases, I think I just want to let people go and give their lists and, and talk

257
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,400
about their reasons why.

258
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,980
So, um, can, can I call on dark soccer to go first?

259
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,960
Only because I was going to say, I have a really good idea of what's coming.

260
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,540
It was all animal crossing.

261
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,100
I mean, that was really it all animal crossing.

262
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,560
I didn't really play anything else, but animal crossing.

263
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,600
Um, the other stuff that I played was just like retro games.

264
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,800
Like, you know, pop and twi- I played a lot of pop and twinbee.

265
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,520
I played a lot of Puyo Puyo.

266
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,580
So I guess actually that Puyo Puyo championship thing that came out, I would put that as number

267
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,080
two.

268
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,700
Um, but animal crossing, just animal crossing.

269
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,420
Why do you think, like, is, is retro, you know, I don't, I don't need to get too like

270
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,700
into like, what is going through your brain, dark soccer, but just trying to see if maybe

271
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,840
there's something here about like, do you think like the retro games in this year have

272
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,860
been kind of like comfort food in a way?

273
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,180
Yeah, pretty much.

274
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:10,140
I mean, it's just like, you know, it's, do I want to go out to this fancy new restaurant

275
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:16,740
that's opened up and everyone loves, or do I want pizza and I want pizza because even

276
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,460
when pizza is bad, it's still pretty fucking good.

277
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,460
Wasn't that a quote, mawrats?

278
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,180
Anyway, or clerks.

279
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,860
Um, no, I hear you.

280
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,540
You know, what's funny because even on the Xbox Series X that I have, I was going back

281
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:34,500
into my library the other day and I was like, I want to go play gyrus because they released

282
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,940
that on the 360 at one point.

283
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,780
So it's in my library and I had it and I ended up having like a retro day around here and

284
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,940
I, I, and that's kind of why I asked the question is because you know, with as crazy of a year

285
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:51,500
as it's been, sometimes those old standards and those old go-tos have been the, the comfort

286
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
food, the pizza we've needed this year.

287
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,740
So like, I get it.

288
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,740
I do.

289
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:01,460
Um, SSG100Matt says, uh, I didn't really play too many new 2020 games.

290
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,320
I mostly dug into my backlog that I never touched after I bought them.

291
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,700
So Firewatch was one of my favorite games I played in 2020.

292
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,220
That's a very good point as well about now's the time to dig into the backlog.

293
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,180
Fifth Dream says comfort games came out this year.

294
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,180
Absolutely.

295
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,180
Uh, yeah, I think it was early, early in the year, maybe late last year.

296
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,180
Here's how I'm going to put it.

297
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:27,940
I'm going to put it as Animal Crossing first and then Breath of the Wild, um, because that's

298
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,820
still, you know, just beautiful and way at the top of the list.

299
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,620
And I'm going to say P.O.P.O.

300
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,620
Championships.

301
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,580
All right.

302
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,140
That's her list and you can't do anything about it.

303
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,140
Yeah.

304
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,700
Um, let's see.

305
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,220
Let's see.

306
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,220
Uh, yeah.

307
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,840
And some, some other folks in chat are kind of like confirming like, yeah, I kind of went

308
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,300
to a lot of my old go-tos as well.

309
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,820
Quest Buster's talking about Gyros warps to Neptune.

310
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,820
No, no, no.

311
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:56,960
It's always about, you have to get to Neptune so that it's three warps to Uranus.

312
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,180
You have to get that far in the game.

313
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,180
That's the legendary part.

314
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,180
Three warps.

315
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,180
How far is a warp?

316
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,180
I don't know.

317
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,020
Um, anyway, and some folks just talking about some of their comfort games for the year.

318
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,020
Okay.

319
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,840
Um, Loki, how about your list?

320
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,220
You have, you have comfort games on your list or what, how does your 2020 best stuff

321
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,960
shaped up, shape up?

322
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:23,840
Um, so I've got, let's see, hotshots racing.

323
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,640
That was a pretty fun one because it was kind of like a nineties arcade racer game.

324
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,720
So that was definitely, um, up there.

325
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:38,880
Uh, gosh, it was hard to decide with like my top three, probably I'd say, um, I don't

326
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,920
know.

327
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,840
Final fantasy seven was all right, but I never finished it.

328
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,760
The remake, um, half-life Alex, I think made more of an impact.

329
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
I think on me.

330
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,680
Cause I thought it was just a really excellent VR game.

331
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:56,400
Um, so half-life Alex, and then of course, cyberpunk 2077, even though it's a buggy mess,

332
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,960
but it's still a great game.

333
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,600
When does that ever bothered you?

334
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,800
It doesn't.

335
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Yeah.

336
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,880
It just adds to it actually, as long as it doesn't break the game where I can't play

337
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,880
it, then I really don't care.

338
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,400
Uh, are you, are you purposely putting bugs into, into your, your game?

339
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,280
Not purposely, but there's stuff.

340
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:21,040
I know where the bugs are and there's some, some that I can't do anything about and some

341
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:28,200
that maybe my, my rainbow effect caused more problems for, but, uh, you know, that's fine.

342
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,440
But no, I'm not purposely putting bugs in the game.

343
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,200
Um, orange right is a kind of a green kind of, kind of with a hybrid here of what Jamie

344
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,480
and Loki have both said, saying I pretty much stuck to retro games and games that were on

345
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,880
my backlog pile.

346
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,760
Only 2020 games I really played were animal crossing and hotshot racing.

347
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,800
So it's been mainly Minecraft this year again.

348
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,000
So it's like, I can't, I can't really do that again, but yeah.

349
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,440
Well then I think that's been an important one for you to entertain the kids too, which

350
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,920
is something a lot of people are going through in the pandemic is how do I entertain my kids

351
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,720
all day, every day when I was used to school being a part of this and outdoor stuff and

352
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,160
go going over to someone else's house, you know, that thing it's, it's, that's all been

353
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,160
disrupted this year.

354
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,080
Well, I finally got a discord set up for my son and his friends.

355
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,040
So now that they can, they can chat now with each other, which has been like, he's really

356
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
enjoyed that.

357
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:27,400
So they're, they're playing like among us and stuff, um, and Roblox doing that.

358
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
So that's kind of fun.

359
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Fun.

360
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
Nice.

361
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
All right.

362
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,840
So here's the plot to my top three.

363
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,840
So here we go.

364
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,440
And honestly, like I, I'm kind of with you guys in the sense that like, if you asked

365
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,240
me to give a number four, I'm not sure I could give one.

366
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:49,440
Um, I just kind of feel like I have three and then like you guys, Final Fantasy 14,

367
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,280
that's my comfort food and continues to be like the social interaction that I get with

368
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,240
other people, you know, being able to play with, you know, my friend Shane and my friend

369
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,480
Ray and the people that I've played that game with online for a while now, it's, it's

370
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,060
a good social thing.

371
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:09,840
So like, honestly, that should be in my top three, but it's not, I did go with games that

372
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,320
came out this year just because I did play enough that I did think were that good.

373
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,320
So here we go.

374
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,480
Um, my number three game, I'm going to say the Final Fantasy seven remake.

375
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:27,400
Um, I don't think it's very often that games have so much behind it when it comes to like

376
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,240
the hype and being able to live up to those expectations.

377
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,000
But I feel like Final Fantasy seven remake did a great job of delivering a quality game.

378
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,020
And I think we've seen time and time again where sometimes that bar gets raised so high,

379
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,720
the games can't really meet it and they end up, you know, getting a lot of backlash with

380
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
that.

381
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,840
I didn't feel that at all with Final Fantasy seven.

382
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,240
Did I have some minor complaints about the game?

383
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,240
Sure.

384
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,880
I think a lot of people did, but did I feel like I was getting an experience worthy of

385
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:02,080
being like Final Fantasy 16, um, not to be confused with the actual Final Fantasy 16

386
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,480
that got announced this year.

387
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,560
But did I feel like I was playing the next iteration of a Final Fantasy game with some

388
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,560
familiar characters?

389
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,020
Yes, I did.

390
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:15,680
And I have to, and the one thing I really wasn't expecting, I was ready to be pissed

391
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:21,160
about the story to not like to, to, to be like, why did they make just the mid guard

392
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,560
section of the, I almost said mid guard somewhere, the mid guard section of the game, the entire

393
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,680
first game, why did they do that?

394
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:33,680
But I think the game throughout its paces justified what they did.

395
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,240
And without spoiling the ending and getting into the ending, I found the ending to be

396
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:47,500
something where I was like, damn, that was not what I expected, but that's great.

397
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,040
And you know, really kind of leaves the door open for what's next.

398
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,200
And I do think a lot of people are going to revisit this game this year in 2021.

399
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,040
I know we're going to do predictions next week, but I can already tell you, I will absolutely

400
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:05,780
predict there will be a Final Fantasy 7 remaster plus International Edition we'll say, or something

401
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:10,760
like that, that will come with maybe a couple extra fights in the, in the section of the

402
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:17,420
game where you can kind of pick fights, maybe another limited chapter, maybe allowing more

403
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:21,700
control of one character who you never get to control later on in the game.

404
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:28,140
I see some doors available to open a little bit to make just that Final Fantasy 7 plus

405
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,940
in the way that you got Final Fantasy 12, the Zodiac Age, and Final Fantasy 10 International

406
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,500
and sometimes they do it with Kingdom Hearts.

407
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,580
And maybe if you beat it, like Kingdom Hearts, if you beat it all and you get that, you know,

408
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:48,700
perfect run of the game, maybe an extra scene that will start to lead into chapter two of

409
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,860
the Final Fantasy 7 remake.

410
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,380
And I really believe that's going to come this year because we're going to have the

411
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,060
end of the Xbox exclusive window.

412
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,900
So I don't see why Square wouldn't want to release the game there.

413
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,820
And if they're going to do it there, they're going to do a version that's optimized for

414
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:07,180
the X and the S. They're going to do a PC version that's in tandem with that, which

415
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,820
means yay mods for that crowd.

416
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,780
And then of course, the PlayStation 5 is going to need a version to bring that up to parody.

417
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:18,860
So I fully anticipate there will be a Final Fantasy 7 plus international edition, something

418
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,300
along those lines for holiday this year.

419
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,140
If not holiday this year, certainly next year.

420
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:29,460
But I think when the Xbox exclusive window kind of runs out, I think they're going to

421
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,900
be itching for their own version of that game.

422
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:37,020
So I was going to say so I have a check because I couldn't remember exactly when I downloaded

423
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:43,860
the app, but apparently it was very almost a 20 20 when I downloaded Orna.

424
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:48,780
So I definitely have to add Orna to the list as well, because I mean, that was pretty much

425
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,000
this entire year.

426
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,140
So I'll allow it.

427
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,140
You're right.

428
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,900
I'm totally ignoring my GPS game thing.

429
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,780
Orna, Ingress, Pogo, all of it.

430
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,900
I'm kind of ignoring it.

431
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,540
But yeah, I think those were very important this year as well.

432
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:08,860
Speaking in chat, DJ Rama S theorizes, Rob, expect the Xbox version to be a digital release

433
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,860
only.

434
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,300
I'm curious more why you think that is.

435
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,300
Is that like a supply issue or is that is it going to be on Game Pass?

436
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,660
Maybe not there.

437
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:22,600
And Phoenix 7726 says, God, no, please finish the saga first.

438
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,620
Leave the milking to EA or Activision.

439
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,300
Kingdom Hearts was bad enough with that.

440
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,680
I hear you, Phoenix.

441
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,620
It's not that I disagree.

442
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:37,060
It's just this whole now PlayStation 5 and Xbox X and S are the new thing.

443
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:43,620
And I just I can't I don't see why Square wouldn't take the opportunity to try to milk

444
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,740
another.

445
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,580
Maybe they won't go 60 bucks.

446
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,380
Maybe they'll go down to 40.

447
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,260
But they'll definitely try to milk for more money.

448
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,180
So are we going to get Crisis Core and Dirge of Cerberus in there?

449
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,260
Yeah, I fucking hope not.

450
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:02,140
Like, get get to work on part two, the whip like it's we're ready for it.

451
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,540
But anyway, they need to take the approach of Activision, where they have like five different

452
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:13,660
companies working on one property and they just keep churning out more content for it.

453
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:18,340
And Dijarama is saying Squeenix did it with Kingdom Hearts and Nier Automata.

454
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,780
Every exclusive release the PS4s have from Square Enix ends up as a digital release on

455
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,060
Xbox a year later.

456
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,060
All right.

457
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,060
I didn't think about that.

458
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,740
I thought Kingdom Hearts had a disc version, but maybe I'm wrong.

459
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,740
All right.

460
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,620
OK, so that was my number three game Final Fantasy 7 remake.

461
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,500
My number two game.

462
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,140
This may come as a surprise.

463
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,780
My number two game for the year, I'm going to say, is Hades.

464
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,940
Hades.

465
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:51,860
It's it's it's cool because Hades is almost in a way like the antithesis of the Final

466
00:24:51,860 --> 00:25:01,260
Fantasy 7 remake because you have Final Fantasy 7, the big game, the huge game and all this

467
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,580
stuff that comes out.

468
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:07,620
And then Hades is like this this indie game that comes out of nowhere almost.

469
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:13,740
I mean, yes, it had the hype from the, you know, the lead up and all that stuff with

470
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,460
the early access.

471
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:21,700
But again, I still I really think Hades kind of came through because of the Switch release

472
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,500
and that's what really put it on everybody's radar.

473
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,820
So I do really consider it at least that was for me.

474
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:33,460
I do consider it a 2020 game, but it's like this little indie game that did amazing.

475
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,260
And Hades.

476
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:43,380
Tells a story with very familiar characters, and it has a game in a very familiar type

477
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:48,600
of game that's been a very controversial genre for a long time, the roguelike.

478
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:57,400
But it does all of these things so well that it doesn't need the bells and whistles of

479
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:05,720
2020 graphics, 2020 flair and the things we would expect from PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series

480
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,720
X.

481
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:14,600
It's just a really good game with really great voice acting, really great story and really

482
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,480
great mechanics that is absolutely worth your time and quite stellar and one of the

483
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,480
best games of the year.

484
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,360
And if you're afraid of Hades because you don't like roguelikes, I would really urge

485
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,760
you to take a step back and give this one a different go because it does things differently

486
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,000
than other roguelikes have before.

487
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,220
And it doesn't build on itself quite the same way that other roguelikes have done before.

488
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:44,220
It's a little bit slower, and that's actually a good thing, I think, the way it does it

489
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,020
and a little more limited.

490
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,940
And I think that really allows you to experience the story in a full way.

491
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:58,020
And Shane is in chat this year and going after me saying, I have wrong opinions about Hades.

492
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,860
Nothing was better than Hades this year.

493
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,060
Not even the new Frog Fractions.

494
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,620
Oh, I forgot about that one.

495
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,620
Maybe honorable mentions.

496
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:09,180
Sia Tabiri says, you forgot incredible and thirst inducing art.

497
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,660
Shane continues, the game underneath is amazing and the writing and music and voice acting

498
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,380
are all great.

499
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,820
Honestly, no lies.

500
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,100
And is number two really that bad of a spot?

501
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,540
I don't think it is.

502
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,360
And it's really close.

503
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:30,960
And I did do a last minute switcheroo because I really sat back and I thought about the

504
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,920
games that came out this year and like what they've meant and so forth.

505
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:41,560
So that being said, my number one game of the year is Animal Crossing.

506
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,340
And that might surprise you because I talked about how I kind of took a break from Animal

507
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:54,120
Crossing for a little bit, but I just don't think, here's the thing, and maybe this is

508
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,080
how I play Kate Shane a little bit too, but no, this is my honest answer.

509
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,820
This is about, you know, making anyone happy.

510
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,540
I said it's my list and you can take it or leave it.

511
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:08,180
I think in any other year, if this was 2019, if this is 2018, I think yes, Hades is number

512
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,860
one and Animal Crossing, I'm not even sure makes the top three, maybe number three.

513
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:22,220
I think because of what 2020 did to all of us and I think because of what this year has

514
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:30,340
done to our culture, I think Animal Crossing provided that escape that we desperately needed.

515
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,940
And sure, there's lots of games with great storylines, whether Hades, Final Fantasy,

516
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,580
Cyberpunk, that maybe was the escape for you as well.

517
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:44,140
But I think the things that Animal Crossing brought us with the virtual graduations, when

518
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:52,000
you couldn't have a graduation in person, with the, my birthday, of course, your birthday,

519
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:01,040
the ability to visit friends when you otherwise can't, I think has been so meaningful in this

520
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:10,560
shit year that Animal Crossing, like, I think helped many of us get through this god-awful

521
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,720
year.

522
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:18,780
And so I think honestly, for those reasons, it deserves the kudos as the game that best

523
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,060
represents 2020.

524
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,780
And that's what it's about.

525
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:28,380
So I thought about that for a long time, like, but I think when I was really thinking about

526
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,600
like what, what did the games that came out this year like really mean and what really

527
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:39,120
embodies what 2020 was, what is a symbol of this year?

528
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,600
I really truly think it's Animal Crossing.

529
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,740
And obviously, Jamie, I'm sure you have no problem hearing this.

530
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,660
You are probably the opposite of Shane here in this regard.

531
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,340
But I know you and I have talked about this at length.

532
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,640
And we talked about it here on this show.

533
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,480
And we even did an Animal Crossing.

534
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,900
We did a special OLR that was about, and Loki, does that video, does that video have boobies

535
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,900
in it?

536
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,300
You got to be careful with the Twitch guidelines.

537
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,020
No, it's hazy.

538
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,020
It's Saints Row.

539
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,020
All right.

540
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,020
Just look out.

541
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,020
All right.

542
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,020
No nudity.

543
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,020
All right.

544
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,020
Anyway, sorry.

545
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,900
There's no, there's no nudity in that game.

546
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:23,860
So, um, but, um, Jamie, you know, we've kind of talked about this at length is, is about

547
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,380
like, I think, I think it was like the therapy that like so many people kind of needed this

548
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,380
year.

549
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,380
It really was.

550
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,380
Yeah.

551
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:38,060
It just, it, it was there for, I don't know, it just gave people a special kind of outlet

552
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:41,100
and a great distraction that was in a safe place.

553
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,100
Yeah.

554
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,180
You know, it was very safe.

555
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:49,060
And I'm going to tell you the moment I realized that I needed to change my list actually.

556
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:54,960
And the moment I realized I needed to change my list was New Year's Eve and watching that

557
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:01,560
people were more interested in New Year's Eve on what was going on in their Animal Crossing

558
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
towns.

559
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,020
And this goes far beyond even just the audience of this show.

560
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,880
I'm talking about, you know, generally what I saw on social media and everything.

561
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,120
There was more interest in what was going on in people's Animal Crossing towns than

562
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,040
there was going on in, in Times Square and any of that on TV and so forth.

563
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:25,440
And I think that's just a sign of, of everything of 2020.

564
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,980
So I also, I'm also very appreciative that Nintendo has still continued to support the

565
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,040
game as strongly as it has.

566
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:36,280
So anyway, I'm going to other comments.

567
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:40,480
As Jonah and Matt says, Rob distracted by strippers, it happened.

568
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:45,480
Shane in chat says Animal Crossing was great, not to crap on it at all and probably deserve

569
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,800
somewhere in the top five for sure.

570
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,120
And that's it.

571
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,700
Everybody's going to have a different list.

572
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,060
And even though I gave my three, it's probably not going to match anyone else's three.

573
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,060
And that's okay.

574
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,920
There are games I didn't get around to playing this year.

575
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,380
Last of Us Part Two, which many people have been hyping up, didn't get around to playing

576
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:10,240
it this year because it's the zombie gore stuff that I'm a little...

577
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,880
Although people are telling me I need to give it a rest and try it already.

578
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,980
So maybe that's a 2021 thing, we'll see.

579
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,900
Ghost of Tsushima is another one I just haven't gotten around to yet that I understand is

580
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,520
very good as well.

581
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:27,080
And there's plenty of others, but I think everything we all collectively named and many

582
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,840
of your favorites as well are worth playing.

583
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:35,720
And honestly, it's funny because he keeps changing his name.

584
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
What's his name now?

585
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,040
No one's special 77 in chat.

586
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,040
He always changes his name.

587
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,040
Okay.

588
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,040
I just have to keep track.

589
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,040
So is it...

590
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
What Nader?

591
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,040
Is it...

592
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
Okay.

593
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,040
Oh, yes.

594
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:52,800
No one's special 77 asked us last week, what are the worst games of the year?

595
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,820
I don't think I played any.

596
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:00,040
I don't think I played any game where I was like, this is bad.

597
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,840
And what's funny later in the show, we're going to talk about what some websites said

598
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,840
were bad.

599
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,060
And there's actually a game that I played that's on it.

600
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,780
And I'm not sure I would call it that bad.

601
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:15,480
And I'm just not sure it was a year for crap games, but maybe because of everything else

602
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,940
we've talked about before, we kind of got to where we talked about retro games being

603
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:25,540
the comfort blanket, MMOs being that comfort food, whatever it is that you're into as your

604
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,000
comfort games.

605
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,300
Maybe we just didn't have time for the bad shit because of all that.

606
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,300
I don't know.

607
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:36,240
Or maybe just maybe we're just not as critical of the games and all that, but I tried to

608
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,320
give it some real good thought.

609
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,480
I don't have any bad games this year.

610
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
I really don't.

611
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,680
I don't know if you guys do, but.

612
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,080
I can't think of anything.

613
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,820
Yeah, I really can't either.

614
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:56,040
I mean, like I said, I've really just been sticking to the stuff that I like or that

615
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,320
I know that I like.

616
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,800
I mean, Pixel Poops has crap.

617
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
That's crappy.

618
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,080
That's going to be in my 2021 list for sure.

619
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:10,920
No, I will say right now, Pixel Poops, due to the conflict of interest and that I am

620
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:17,680
a responsible gaming commentator on a podcast out of my spare bedroom, I will not be placing

621
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,000
Pixel Poops on my top three.

622
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
It is ineligible.

623
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,720
There's a conflict of interest there.

624
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:27,320
So because I'll put it on my top, Jamie's like, I'll take that.

625
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,320
I'll take it.

626
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,480
All right.

627
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,040
That game is going to get enough promotion here on this show.

628
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
Number 3.5.

629
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,040
All right.

630
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,040
Number 3.5.

631
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,040
Questbuster.

632
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,040
Actually.

633
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,040
Oh, go ahead.

634
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,920
I will actually go back and say that maybe the game that pissed me off the most this

635
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,320
last year was Cuphead because fuck, it's hard.

636
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,320
It is.

637
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,880
Yep, it is Questbuster in chat says Avengers have a good

638
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,240
has a good campaign, but the rest of it was bad.

639
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,160
Shane is saying Ori 2 as far as good games go or in the will of the wisps.

640
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,360
Don't forget that.

641
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,360
Great call out.

642
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:07,440
Another game that isn't on my list because I refuse to play it until I beat Ori in the

643
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,560
Blind Forest, the first one, and like a lot of games, I ended up playing that for like

644
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,560
four hours.

645
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:19,240
Then I was like, shiny, and went somewhere else, squirrel, and went somewhere else.

646
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:26,040
It happens, but God, the first game is probably on one of my most played games of this year

647
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,200
for sure.

648
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,320
So all right.

649
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,320
Great discussion, you guys.

650
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,680
A lot of good games out there.

651
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,800
So those are that's some insight into our top games of 2020.

652
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,160
All right.

653
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,720
Let's take a look now.

654
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,560
So sitting here and it's probably hard to see on camera, but sitting here, I have this

655
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:49,200
little silly Darth Vader coin bank thing and I, I don't know.

656
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,880
I don't know why it's not I know why it's in my house.

657
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:57,240
It was it was a lovely gift, but it is turned into the time capsule that we have here at

658
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,960
OLR that our predictions go into every year.

659
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,400
We will be making predictions for 2021 next week on the show because I kind of think it's

660
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,920
going to be a slow week next week as well.

661
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,160
So we're going to kind of do it virtually.

662
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,600
And I'll just write everything down to the other say, since we can't really do our own

663
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,220
all in the same place.

664
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:19,640
But I thought tonight we could take a look back at what is in the tin from last year,

665
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,900
which I was convinced there's nothing in it, but I peeked just to see is anything in there.

666
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,280
And there's like, there's like three slips of paper in it.

667
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,300
So I don't know if somebody snuck things in when I wasn't looking.

668
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,340
Maybe you put stuff in there and then, and then we forgot.

669
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,100
No, I think that we did it all right.

670
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,460
Or maybe we never answered it this year or last year.

671
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,460
Well, you know what?

672
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,460
I'm opening it.

673
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,460
Here we go.

674
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,460
I'm going to pull them out.

675
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,460
Here we go.

676
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:48,500
This one says, okay, this looks like Loki's handwriting.

677
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,900
Oh, maybe I threw stuff back in there.

678
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,900
You probably did.

679
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,700
You probably snuck your own shit in there.

680
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,940
All right.

681
00:36:54,940 --> 00:37:03,540
EA will close BioWare after Anthem underperforms due to EA shittiness, i.e. loot boxes.

682
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,540
Well.

683
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,620
No, they haven't done that.

684
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,020
Anthem has underperformed.

685
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,020
We still-

686
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,780
Bounce back with the stuff that they rely on.

687
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,780
Yeah.

688
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,780
Yeah.

689
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:17,940
I think, I think that's a good point is that BioWare is definitely leaning on the wheelhouse

690
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,280
that they know will perform for them, namely Mass Effect.

691
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,400
And I think a lot of us were worried about what was going to happen when Mass Effect

692
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,120
after Andromeda seemed to get a lukewarm reception.

693
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:32,280
But I think Mass Effect has heard loud and clear, or excuse me, BioWare has heard loud

694
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,480
and clear that Mass Effect going back to its roots would make everybody very happy.

695
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:42,560
And so now we know we're getting the remaster, you know, finally next year, it's official.

696
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,400
And except there won't be multiplayer, so no loot boxes, Loki.

697
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,200
And we know we have that new mystery Mass Effect game that's probably years and years

698
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,200
out.

699
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,080
And of course, Dragon Age as well.

700
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:58,440
Still kind of is still really thin on what we know about that game.

701
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,560
But hopefully, hopefully soon.

702
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,220
And then Quest Buster does point out Casey Hudson and Mark Darragh left BioWare.

703
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,100
In Hudson's case, he left again.

704
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,320
And Shane is saying, I can't wait for him to come back a third time and leave a third

705
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,320
time.

706
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:18,240
That's like that's like I'm sorry, I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to go there and

707
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,600
I'm not going to apologize for it, but that's that's like watching Trump lose the recount

708
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,960
over and over in every state.

709
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,960
He tried again.

710
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,240
We're doing it's election night all over.

711
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,600
And he lost again.

712
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
Let's go to the next slip.

713
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,600
All right.

714
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,120
Another one of those, by the way.

715
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,120
What's that?

716
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:42,080
I'm still waiting for another time for him to lose, you know, before the day.

717
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,080
January 6th.

718
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,440
Anyway, this is the last slip.

719
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,640
There was two slips in there.

720
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,720
This is it.

721
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,000
I think this might be Jamie's handwriting because it's not mine.

722
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,480
And it says still no Half-Life 3.

723
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,480
That was me.

724
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,160
Well, we got Half-Life, Alex.

725
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,160
I know.

726
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,160
I was going to say Half-Life.

727
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,700
That's not a three.

728
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,020
It's not.

729
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,760
That's in the two area.

730
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,480
I would say this is mixed.

731
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:19,320
I agree that on its technical, literal purposes, the prediction is correct.

732
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,520
There is still no Half-Life 3.

733
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:28,760
However, I would be remiss to think that Half-Life, Alex, was not internally thought of at some

734
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,840
point to potentially be Half-Life 3.

735
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:37,000
Somewhere along the way, they said two things.

736
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,640
Number one, doing it as a VR exclusive is not going to have the effect we want it to

737
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,680
have.

738
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,300
So I think they pulled back for that reason.

739
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:51,200
Number two, I think if they'd called it Half-Life 3, people were going to have the expectations

740
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,520
that go with Half-Life 3.

741
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,560
And no matter what Valve did, they were never going to be able to live up to it.

742
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:04,560
And so I kind of think for that reason, we got Half-Life, Alex.

743
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,320
I don't think we ever will get a Half-Life 3.

744
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:12,280
I think if we get Half-Life, it's going to be continuing Half-Life stories kind of like

745
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,120
what we got with Half-Life, Alex.

746
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,520
But that's another one of those games where if you want to go back to the best games of

747
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:23,440
the year, people that have played it, and especially VR enthusiasts, absolutely have

748
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,360
it in their top.

749
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,320
And you mentioned it, Loki, to be fair.

750
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,640
It is absolutely a stunning piece of game.

751
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,760
I haven't gotten around to playing it myself because I only have PlayStation VR.

752
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,100
But I'm super curious about it.

753
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:42,080
They need to do some version of that game, though, that people who can't play VR games

754
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,560
can play.

755
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,520
I think there was a mod that someone made to make it so that you could do without VR,

756
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,680
but it's not good.

757
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,880
I think there will be Half-Life games like that.

758
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:01,040
I don't think they will do Half-Life, Alex, like that because...

759
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,840
You can watch a video or anything because it makes me so sick.

760
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,840
It's a lot.

761
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,920
The motion is a lot.

762
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:20,840
And yeah, it's interesting to see how there's been some VR games like Doom, I think, and

763
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,920
even No Man's Sky has something like this because Doom is so fast paced.

764
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,260
If I remember right, Doom was all about teleporting.

765
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,260
You don't move.

766
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,260
That's not right.

767
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,900
That's how Half-Life, Alex, works.

768
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,900
It's teleporting.

769
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,900
Oh, I thought it was all like motion.

770
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,900
Oh, okay.

771
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,320
Well, that's good.

772
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,780
It did seem like it was going like in everything I've seen.

773
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,780
It's like moving very fast.

774
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,860
You can teleport quickly, but you know, yeah, it's all teleporting.

775
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,860
Yeah.

776
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,860
Interesting.

777
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:52,860
All right.

778
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:56,140
See Bobby in chat says they would have to change the game way too much to get it to

779
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,500
not work in VR.

780
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,020
Yeah, I think it would end up being like a...

781
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,140
And that's kind of like where I'm getting at is that at that point it would be a different

782
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,140
game.

783
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:09,340
And I'm not saying they shouldn't do that, but I do understand that like not every puzzle,

784
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,980
not every element is going to be able to translate.

785
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,980
And that's...

786
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,980
Yeah.

787
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,980
Let's see.

788
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,620
What else do I want to mention here in chat?

789
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:24,020
Pele Hanumea talking about what I said about Half-Life 3 and why you nailed it, Rob.

790
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:27,840
And Bobby says Valve will never release a game called Half-Life 3.

791
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,140
They would be stupid to do so.

792
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,340
It will 100% disappoint.

793
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:36,500
And I think that is exactly where Half-Life is right now.

794
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:42,340
I think the game we should be asking about, and Jamie can agree with me on this, I believe,

795
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,020
is Portal.

796
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,500
Where's Portal 3?

797
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,900
Or some continuing story in that universe, which technically is the Half-Life universe.

798
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,800
I don't see them taking Portal to VR.

799
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,820
I think that would be a bit much.

800
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,820
Not?

801
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,820
My God.

802
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,340
I'm okay with most VR things.

803
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:03,820
I think even that in VR would be too much.

804
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,100
But I would love to see that universe continue.

805
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,580
But I'm worried it's the same thing.

806
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,340
They'll never put out a game called Portal 3 because it would never live up to the hype

807
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,340
of 2.

808
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,340
So.

809
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,700
If they did it, they wouldn't put like 3 in the name.

810
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:18,700
It would be like called like Portal the other side or something.

811
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,860
Portal, all your cake and eat it too or something like that.

812
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,860
Something with it.

813
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:23,860
I don't know.

814
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,860
I would love to see that.

815
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,420
Honestly, for me personally, I'd love to-

816
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,420
Portal the edible edition.

817
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,420
Portal the edibles.

818
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,420
Or Portal the edibles.

819
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,420
That's it.

820
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,420
That's it.

821
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,420
They make a phone version and call it Port-Portal-able.

822
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,420
Portal portable potables.

823
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,100
Stop stealing our ideas, by the way.

824
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,100
This is all of us.

828
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,100
Alright.

829
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,100
So, yeah.

830
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,100
Dot com.

831
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:54,660
I would love to return to that universe more than Half-Life personally, but I get it.

832
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:59,100
The hype for something like that would be very, very real.

833
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:03,140
But I think it would still- I don't think there's gonna be an E3 this year.

834
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:09,060
Or if there is, it's gonna be like a scaled down event like it was in years past where

835
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,500
you have to show your vaccine green card or something to get in.

836
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,500
I don't know.

837
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,740
We're still so far off.

838
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,140
It's hard to say where the world's gonna be at.

839
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:19,760
But I still have that fantasy of Gabe Newell doing the press conference where he comes

840
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:25,600
out on stage and says, Half-Life 3 out today and then drops the mic and the ceiling opens

841
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,320
and a bunch of mics drop on the ceiling.

842
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:33,040
I still have that fantasy in my mind, but I would- that would completely be an acceptable

843
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,820
meme with Portal 3 as well.

844
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:41,960
If he came out on stage and said, Portal 3 out today, boom.

845
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,960
I would be totally alright with that.

846
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,040
Alright.

847
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:49,000
So that was our predictions for the year.

848
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,440
We kept it short.

849
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,840
How apropro.

850
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,480
Anyway, we will do some new predictions next week.

851
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,920
So y'all be thinking about that since I'm doing them virtually.

852
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,520
We'll probably throw in a couple listener suggestions.

853
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,360
So be on the lookout for that.

854
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:08,800
Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing

855
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,160
this week, which may overlap with our games of the year.

856
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,160
I don't know.

857
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,680
I have some different things I can talk about, but let's get into our gaming weeks.

858
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,680
We'll start with Dark Sakura.

859
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,680
How was your gaming week?

860
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,680
I played Animal Crossing.

861
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,680
Of course.

862
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:29,120
I played, you know, some Poppin' Twinbee because I mean, it's just a fun little shooter.

863
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:35,280
I mean, everyone needs to go on the Nintendo online and play Poppin' Twinbee, end of story.

864
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:45,360
Also, I actually picked up Okami HD because there's like a Capcom sale going on on the

865
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:51,040
Switch store or Nintendo store or whatever the crap they call it.

866
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,640
And I don't have room to download it.

867
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,640
We have something wrong with our card that we have on our Switch right now.

868
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:04,200
But yeah, I've just been pretty much in the retro gaming mode, getting stuff setting up

869
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:11,000
to finally start streaming again now that things are working out better, got a few things

870
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
on Steam that I'm going to play.

871
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,480
Looking at a few things anyway that I was going to throw onto the list.

872
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,600
So we'll see what happens.

873
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:28,040
But yeah, if anyone has a suggestion, look in my library and let me know what you think

874
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,360
you'd want to see me play because I ain't buying anything unless you want to buy it

875
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,360
for me.

876
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,000
All right.

877
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,840
There's a couple more days left on that sale.

878
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,560
All right.

879
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,560
Loki, how about you?

880
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,920
How was your gaming week?

881
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,720
It's been mainly just I was rushing to get the demo done for Pixel Poops 2.

882
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,120
So that was the majority of the week.

883
00:46:53,120 --> 00:47:00,200
Aside from that, though, then I did play a bit more of Minecraft with the kids on our

884
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,200
realms.

885
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,680
So we were building or still are building a lighthouse.

886
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,560
And so that's been quite the endeavor.

887
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:13,840
And then Orna and yeah, that's about it.

888
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,840
All right.

889
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,440
My gaming week.

890
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:20,600
Outside of the things I already talked about, because I talked about Pixel Poops number

891
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,600
2 and GPS gaming is always a thing.

892
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,880
I see a zet in chat.

893
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,040
Shout out.

894
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,280
And yeah, GPS gaming is always a thing, of course.

895
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,640
But outside of those, I have now I want to know if Shane was still listening, although

896
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,520
it looks like he may have rage quit after hearing the top games.

897
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,120
I don't know where he has it on the background.

898
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,120
Who knows?

899
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,560
But I will say this to earn Shane's favor back.

900
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:50,040
I will say one game I played quite a bit yesterday was I played DJ Max on Steam because I did

901
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,120
buy it in the sale.

902
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,560
And I invoke Shane there because he was nudging me to pick that up already.

903
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,040
So I did buy it because I was like, I'm not going to double dip.

904
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,320
I'm not going to double dip.

905
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,840
But it finally went on sale.

906
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,840
It was pretty cheap.

907
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:10,880
I think I paid $24 for an edition that had the base game and two of the expansions that

908
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,880
are new.

909
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,960
I don't think they were on the PlayStation 4 version.

910
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,960
They're on the PC version only.

911
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:21,880
So I picked that one up and then I bought the Clasiquy pack as well, because I had to

912
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,880
have that.

913
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,280
I can't play DJ Max and not have Flee, okay?

914
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,840
So there's that.

915
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,400
So yeah, I was playing that.

916
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,200
It's so much easier on a keyboard than it is the controller.

917
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,400
I'm hoping I can do a live stream coming soon of the game because it's a lot of fun.

918
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,000
Hopefully the music in that is okay.

919
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,560
There might be the two songs that are new to PC that might be things I have to avoid,

920
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:49,160
but the rest of it should be all right.

921
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,360
So there was that.

922
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:56,160
Last week on the show I talked about Tell Me Why, and I played that a little bit.

923
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:01,240
I continued in Tell Me Why this week, and I did get to the end of the first chapter.

924
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,280
So I talked about last week, I'm like, I've got to be close.

925
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,280
And I was pretty close.

926
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:12,120
I was in the last section, again, I don't want to spoil, but there's the last section

927
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,360
that went on for quite some time, and then I was at the end.

928
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:19,520
And I got to say, I think that section started to show some of the weakness of the game to

929
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:25,960
me, is that some of it, the story is really good, and I'm really engaged in a lot of it.

930
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:31,760
And I like the whole, the twins can kind of see each other's memories and things like

931
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,760
that.

932
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,760
I'm all into that.

933
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:39,400
But the game in between it can sometimes get a little dryer, like I was exploring this

934
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,680
office type area, we'll leave it at that.

935
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:47,220
And there was a big puzzle to solve, which did feel rewarding, but it was very like,

936
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:51,240
go here to get the thing to go here, to get the thing to go here, to get the code to go

937
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,240
here.

938
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:59,560
It was just these very basic fetch type things, and I still feel very favorably about the

939
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:05,540
game overall, but I was like, okay, I see why maybe this game isn't exactly showing

940
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:10,880
up on year end best list for the critics and that type of thing, is that there are some

941
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,160
kind of dry parts in there.

942
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:19,040
Honestly, when I play it, I'm like, this would be such an awesome movie.

943
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,800
I'm kind of surprised they didn't just make an Netflix series out of it or something.

944
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,880
It's a very compelling story.

945
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,100
I would have loved to see like a movie, but I get why it's a game as well.

946
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,100
So tell me why.

947
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,880
And I'm going to keep playing more of that.

948
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,680
Hopefully don't get too distracted because I do want to see where the story goes.

949
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,040
Of course, the first part ends with a big twist.

950
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,840
I won't spoil.

951
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,480
I kind of think you see it coming.

952
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,400
I think if you're paying attention, you see it coming.

953
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,560
I did, but maybe not.

954
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,520
So I'm kind of, you know, there'll probably be a big twist at the end of part two and

955
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,280
then it'll all end with a big twist as well.

956
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,760
But I thought it was, it was interesting.

957
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,360
So all right.

958
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,160
Oh, Shane finally came back.

959
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,160
Okay, then you missed.

960
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,800
So I will repeat once for you because it's the new year and I'm feeling generous.

961
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:10,480
I had DJ Max as part of my gaming week because I finally bought it on Steam yesterday.

962
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:18,360
And I was, I was hoping maybe that would help, help calm you down about the 80s thing.

963
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,540
All right.

964
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:23,840
So yeah, I played some DJ Max yesterday.

965
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,200
What else would this week?

966
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,840
A little bit more Destiny 2.

967
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,160
Oh, Halo Dark Sakura.

968
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:37,800
I actually, and ironically played some Halo this week with all the news last week about

969
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,480
Halo going away.

970
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,960
I remembered that the Master Chief collection was a thing and I wanted to download it and

971
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,960
check it out.

972
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,520
And so, yeah, I was playing a little bit of the story mode on that.

973
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:52,480
I will say, and I just, I name checked Dark Sakura to give her a hard time.

974
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,760
I know she doesn't care for it.

975
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,920
That's fine.

976
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:00,180
One thing I like though about the collection is that with a button press, you flip back

977
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,780
between the old graphics and the new graphics.

978
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:10,100
And it's really interesting to see what a long way it's come from just the Xbox, which

979
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:14,900
was, you know, wasn't exactly a bad system or, but like, dang, when you hit that button

980
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:19,100
to toggle between like original Halo graphics and the new one, it's like, wow, this game

981
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,100
looks so much better.

982
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,100
So this is kind of interesting.

983
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,100
All right.

984
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,660
So then Shane says nothing is going to calm him down.

985
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:29,100
Well, deal with it, I guess.

986
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,740
All right.

987
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:35,740
Let's get into some other things real quick and then we're going to get into some gaming

988
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:36,740
news.

989
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:40,900
I do want to mention here at the top and I'll say it towards the end of the show as well.

990
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:45,660
Awesome Games Done Quick is going this week and I know that has your attention as well.

991
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:50,180
It is a fundraising event for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.

992
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,660
I hope I got the charity right.

993
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:56,140
I know it is a cancer prevention and research type of charity.

994
00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:00,660
And you know, I know a lot of our attention has been focused on COVID this year and understandably

995
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:03,580
so, but that doesn't mean that cancer went away.

996
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,580
We still hate it.

997
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,020
We still say, fuck cancer.

998
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:09,700
So I think this is a great cause to be raising money for.

999
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:15,460
And so a lot of gamers have gotten together to put on a great display, the Olympics of

1000
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:19,580
speed running, if you will, in a way where they go through games very quickly.

1001
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,400
It's all in the title actually.

1002
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:25,660
And they raise a lot of money for charity, hopefully, hopefully another couple million

1003
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:29,220
dollars if the last few years have been any expectation.

1004
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:32,500
They are not doing it in person this year, of course.

1005
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,980
You can imagine why.

1006
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:37,500
It is another virtual event similar to the summer event, but that doesn't mean it's any

1007
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,500
less good.

1008
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,300
The speed runs are still very solid.

1009
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:45,260
The little bits that I've seen very, excuse me, engaging.

1010
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:48,820
And a lot of the stories from the speed runners are a lot of fun too.

1011
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:53,940
VOG Networks very own Bobby Blackwolf will be one of the hosts for some various speed

1012
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:54,940
runs.

1013
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,760
And you can check him out on Wednesday night or afternoon, depending on what time zone

1014
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,760
you're in.

1015
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,360
He'll be hosting a speed run of Devil May Cry 3.

1016
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:06,000
And right after that, Yakuza 6, I believe it is.

1017
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,200
And then on Friday night, this is the one I'm most looking forward to that Bobby's hosting

1018
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:17,660
is the Super Mario World 2 speed run, Yoshi's Island speed run that he's doing on Friday.

1019
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:18,920
And I love that game.

1020
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,960
So I'm very excited to see that one.

1021
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,920
And you know, touch fuzzy, get dizzy and all that.

1022
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,280
Oops, I got the games backwards, sorry.

1023
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,280
Bobby corrected me.

1024
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,560
Yoshi's Island is on Wednesday and Yakuza's on Friday.

1025
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,560
My bad.

1026
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,560
At least I got the days right.

1027
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,720
So Bobby will be there on Wednesday and Friday night.

1028
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:41,640
We'll be hosting it here at VOG Network when there's no other scheduled programming because

1029
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,280
we want to support the event as well.

1030
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,360
And Bobby being involved with it is pretty cool as well.

1031
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,800
Remember, if you do decide to donate though, it is not about us.

1032
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,860
It's not about Bobby.

1033
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:56,740
It is about the speed runner a little bit, but it's mostly about the charity.

1034
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:00,420
So please keep that in mind if you do decide to donate.

1035
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:03,540
I think that's all I have for the housekeeping.

1036
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:07,020
We'll mention the Game Stunt Quick thing at the end because for those that are watching

1037
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:11,580
live here on Twitch TV tonight, we will go host them after the show tonight.

1038
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:15,460
I will not be opening it up to request as I usually do.

1039
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:19,180
We're just going to raid Awesome Game Stunt Quick because why wouldn't we?

1040
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:24,260
All right, so let's get into some gaming news for our week.

1041
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:27,980
As slow of a week as it was, right, Loki?

1042
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:30,900
Loki, you are muted, just so you know.

1043
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:31,900
So we want to...

1044
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:32,900
Sorry about that.

1045
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:38,080
So unfortunately, this is not something that we're going to be able to enjoy right away.

1046
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:43,820
But of course, we've been getting more sneak peeks from the brand new theme park opened

1047
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:46,820
up in Japan for Super Nintendo World.

1048
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:54,460
And they kind of alluded to it a little bit when they did the whole thing with Miyamoto

1049
00:55:54,460 --> 00:56:04,380
talking about these brand new power-up bands that you can get the little kind of little

1050
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:09,080
things you can interact with different rides and features that are there.

1051
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:14,860
So what's kind of cool is they mentioned that you would be able to use these with the Nintendo

1052
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:15,860
Switch.

1053
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,900
And apparently, we now know how that's going to happen.

1054
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:24,960
So for example, they sell bands that are themed after Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Daisy

1055
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,960
and whatnot.

1056
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:32,060
And those bands are actually going to also act as amiibos for those specific characters

1057
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:33,060
as well.

1058
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:38,620
So for example, if you take the Mario power-up band and you scan it on your Nintendo Switch,

1059
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:40,060
you get Mario in the game.

1060
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:43,120
So it'd be just like you had a Mario amiibo.

1061
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,960
So that's kind of cool, a little bit additional functionality for those.

1062
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,160
Now that's only going to work though with the Nintendo Switch.

1063
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,720
It will not work with the Wii U and 3DS, but it is still pretty cool that they're going

1064
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:59,720
to have these kind of NFC points throughout the park that you can use this.

1065
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:05,640
Also, there's been some footage leaked of the actual rides as well.

1066
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:10,720
So wow, I did see some POV footage of the Yoshi ride.

1067
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,480
It doesn't really show much of it.

1068
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:18,120
It's mostly outdoors and kind of showing some of the stuff decorated around it, but it's

1069
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,880
definitely very detailed.

1070
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,680
So hopefully we'll get some more leaks of that soon.

1071
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:28,480
I'm very curious to see what the Mario Kart ride looks like, but at the very least, it's

1072
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,480
cute.

1073
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,480
The Yoshi ride stuff.

1074
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,240
I hope it's better than Autotopia.

1075
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:41,000
It's very much like the Adventureland stuff that you would see at Disneyland, you know,

1076
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:47,080
just the kind of cutesy, you know, where you ride through a dark tunnel type thing and

1077
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,720
they've got like the Peter Pan ride, that type of stuff.

1078
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:54,800
Like the Peter Pan ride or like, you know, I'd say, yeah, it's like a dark ride basically.

1079
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,760
So it, it looked cute.

1080
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,960
I mean, um, and it won't, it won't smell like diesel, like Autotopia.

1081
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,960
Although I think they did.

1082
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:06,280
I think they did switch to electric a few years ago, but I, I, I still have memories

1083
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,600
of Autotopia.

1084
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,600
You walk over there.

1085
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,320
It smells like, it smells like diesel.

1086
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,360
It smells like poison.

1087
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,360
As of January.

1088
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,360
No, they have not switched to diesel.

1089
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,400
It's still all right.

1090
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,760
They haven't not switched to electric now.

1091
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:19,760
Okay.

1092
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,760
No, no, no, no.

1093
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:21,760
All right.

1094
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,980
It is very clearly running on gas.

1095
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:27,560
Maybe they're pumping the diesel fumes out kind of like at the pizza place.

1096
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,920
They pump the pizza fumes out and other stuff.

1097
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,320
They both got that stuff.

1098
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:37,720
Like I remember cause we took the monorail in, um, you know, back in January we took

1099
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:42,880
the monorail in one time and as it's just kind of going by all of the, uh, Autotopia

1100
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,240
stuff and it is just strong.

1101
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,320
It is just full on.

1102
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,320
I forgot.

1103
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,320
I forgot.

1104
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,320
You can say you went to Disneyland in 2020.

1105
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,560
Not a lot of people got lucky there.

1106
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,560
Yeah.

1107
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,560
So January.

1108
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,560
Yeah.

1109
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,560
Yeah.

1110
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:00,680
Not, not this year though.

1111
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:04,120
So at least I don't, we're not planning on it.

1112
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:07,700
But anyway, the, the band, I mean, speaking of Disney, the band sounds a lot like, like

1113
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:12,220
um, I think the Florida parks for Disney have like a magic band type of thing.

1114
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:15,900
Um, it was, I think you use it to kind of like do some entry stuff with the parks.

1115
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:18,460
I think fast pass is all embedded in that.

1116
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:22,340
Now some of you East coasters might know this system better than me cause I still have not

1117
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:26,360
been to a Disney world unfortunately, and it's, it's probably going to be some time

1118
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,360
off to be real.

1119
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:30,460
Um, and they have not brought that over to Disneyland yet.

1120
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:35,940
Although I would, I would imagine with the Mario, the super Nintendo world, uh, I would

1121
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:41,660
imagine this same system that they've got in Japan is, will absolutely be in the Hollywood

1122
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:45,600
version and the Orlando version as well whenever they end up launching.

1123
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:49,220
And it's going to be just, yeah, it's, it's a similar system to what they've got already

1124
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:54,860
in Harry Potter land with, you know, the whole, um, but again, not Hollywood, Hollywood didn't

1125
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:55,860
have it.

1126
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:56,860
Well, at least not when I was there.

1127
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,060
No, they have the ones though.

1128
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:00,160
So it's similar to that.

1129
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,580
It's basically different elements that we'll interact with stuff.

1130
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:09,620
So it's, it's not F C, but that one's IR, um, but you know, it's same type of thing.

1131
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:14,060
It's an object that interacts with stuff or the Disney, the Disney hats, uh, for world

1132
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:16,460
of color.

1133
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:17,460
Wasn't that a thing?

1134
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:18,460
Yeah.

1135
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:23,780
They have like hats that interacted with the world of color show hats or they have like,

1136
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:27,260
it's those might be like bracelets and stuff that they have with those.

1137
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:31,840
I think, um, Disneyland, I wouldn't be, I would be surprised if they switched to that

1138
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:36,000
for fast pass because everything right now is done through the app and it's all scanned

1139
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
in and everything.

1140
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,600
I would think they'd have to rebuild the whole system that that's based on.

1141
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:44,040
Um, and I know right now they have their sort of like interactive things that you can do

1142
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,040
as well.

1143
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:50,400
Like I know with, um, the whole star Wars stuff, they've got different things you scan

1144
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,280
with your phone and whatnot.

1145
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:55,880
Um, so they sort of have something similar.

1146
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:59,280
They just went different route, um, which is fine.

1147
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,880
I mean, this looks pretty cool too.

1148
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,680
So, you know, I'll have to check it out.

1149
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:04,680
Yeah.

1150
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:05,680
Sounds neat.

1151
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,240
I, I, I think we all could use the theme park right now.

1152
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:12,400
So it's just one of those things where we're trying to look forward to it, um, in the next

1153
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,400
year.

1154
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,400
That's for sure.

1155
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,880
Um, did anything on the bows that you said the ride leaks, was it just the Yoshi ride

1156
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:18,880
or did anything on that?

1157
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,880
Right.

1158
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:20,880
Just the Yoshi.

1159
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,520
So they had like a small clip that peered on Mario Mario cart.

1160
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,600
I keep thinking of the Bowser statue they have there, but yeah, right.

1161
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,600
Yeah.

1162
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:35,320
They only showed like, there's like a very brief, like kind of video of riding outside

1163
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,480
in the Yoshi ride.

1164
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,880
You can hear some of the music playing and everything.

1165
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,520
They don't really show much of it inside the actual tunnel.

1166
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:46,600
Um, and it's like, it's all filmed sideways and stuff.

1167
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:51,000
You do see like, there's a link at the very end, it looks like there's Yoshi with baby

1168
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,720
Mario and there's Kamek in there, um, and baby peach as well.

1169
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:00,200
So, I mean, it definitely looks like, you know, one of the dark rides out of Disneyland

1170
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:06,400
or something, but, um, it's, it's not shot very well and it's all over the place, but

1171
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:11,120
I'm sure once the park opens up for people, you know, you'll get the folks that are filming

1172
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,680
the POV rides and stuff like that.

1173
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:13,960
So you'll be able to see all that.

1174
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:14,960
Oh yeah.

1175
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,240
That, that stuff will hit the internet the next time.

1176
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,240
Yeah.

1177
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:23,120
Well, I'm not too sure though about the Mario cart stuff cause that's AR.

1178
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,800
So that might be a little bit tougher to do, but we'll see.

1179
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:27,800
All right.

1180
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:33,640
Well, let's move on and talk about, uh, an undiscovered secret in a video game was discovered

1181
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:39,700
this week and the game is near automata, admittedly a game I've got to go back and finish cause

1182
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:45,640
I've heard lots of great things about it and a new, uh, interesting part, uh, or interesting

1183
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:46,640
thing.

1184
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,800
I gotta be very vague here cause I don't want to spoil the game for anybody cause I know

1185
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:52,800
it did recently come out on Xbox game pass and not everyone's gotten around to it yet.

1186
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:57,280
Um, so, um, an interesting element of the game, uh, has kind of unlocked and this has

1187
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,360
been secret for like three and a half years.

1188
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:05,040
In fact, the games developers teased there was one more secret in the game that had gone

1189
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,760
undiscovered and it was discovered.

1190
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:13,400
So what happened is that there was a guy that kind of reverse engineers like cheat codes

1191
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:19,320
and stuff, uh, Lance McDonald, uh, a modern, a data miner, uh, found a cheat code that

1192
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,800
is actually programmed into the game.

1193
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:26,080
And I'm going to kind of say this in very vague, simple terms, essentially what it does,

1194
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:31,560
it allows you to skip from the first boss fight to the end of the game directly.

1195
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:37,600
So it's like a warp ahead and I'm, I'm explaining that in very vague terms on purpose cause

1196
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,600
I don't want to ruin the game for anybody.

1197
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:43,700
Um, but that's basically what this hidden thing does is it's basically full speed ahead

1198
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:45,200
to the end of the game.

1199
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:52,120
Um, so, uh, the near account, uh, near Twitter account in Japan actually confirmed this is

1200
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,120
it.

1201
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,120
This is the final secret.

1202
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:57,680
And the games director, Yoko Taro also said, this is the final secret.

1203
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:02,760
So, um, that secret they'd been teasing years ago, finally discovered, and it's always kind

1204
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:07,480
of neat to hear about games, uh, having their, even if even it was found in somewhat of an

1205
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,600
unconventional way.

1206
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:09,600
So it was a cheat code.

1207
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,800
They must've been hoping that somebody would put in a button sequence or something.

1208
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:16,920
And I wonder if maybe that button sequence wasn't hidden in other elements of the game

1209
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:23,880
or something, but somebody used modding tricks, we'll put it plainly, uh, to instead find

1210
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:24,880
the code.

1211
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,480
What do you think about that Loki?

1212
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:32,320
Cause I know you do a lot with, uh, you know, hacking around in the games and doing things.

1213
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:35,760
You think that's interesting that that's how this final secret was unveiled?

1214
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:40,480
Um, it is interesting that they have it kind of done that way.

1215
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,560
I can't remember.

1216
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:49,320
I want to say like, I think the Stanley parable or something like that had a similar type

1217
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:55,080
of a cheat code that you could find that, or there was something, some game, I don't

1218
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:59,400
remember which one I'm thinking Stanley parable, but there was something where you actually

1219
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:02,320
had to go into the game files to figure something out.

1220
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,700
I think that one is to get an achievement though.

1221
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,200
You have to actually modify something to get it.

1222
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:13,040
But that's kind of cool that they actually have like this cheat code built in.

1223
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:18,380
I mean, I know a lot of people build stuff into protesting and whatnot, but, um, three,

1224
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:20,480
almost four years after it's been released.

1225
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,480
That's pretty cool.

1226
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,480
Yeah.

1227
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,480
Pretty cool.

1228
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:24,480
All right.

1229
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,480
Let's move on dark Sakura.

1230
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:26,480
What do you have for us tonight?

1231
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:32,160
I have some stuff and actually it's kind of a neat stuff for people who like, uh, collecting,

1232
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,800
you know, vinyl records and everything.

1233
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:41,360
So, um, mother two, which we got as earthbound over here is having, um, a vinyl release of

1234
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,360
the soundtrack.

1235
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:48,960
Um, it is of course in Japan right now, um, that it will be, uh, released as the orders

1236
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,360
for it are already out.

1237
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:56,560
Um, but it will include 24 songs from the game, a full track listing, um, including,

1238
01:05:56,560 --> 01:06:03,380
um, different, uh, mixed versions of the music and, uh, for the U S or outside of Japan,

1239
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:05,880
you can order it from play Asia.

1240
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,980
So pretty cool stuff.

1241
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:13,100
Um, and it's, it's just really good soundtrack, you know, for a game.

1242
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:15,340
So I'd say if you can grab it, grab it.

1243
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:19,380
If you like collecting vinyl vinyl, sure.

1244
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:23,560
One of those things that is more and more like the collectors go to thing.

1245
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:28,060
Like I feel like, you know, 10 years ago, you might have a vinyl soundtrack that's coming

1246
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:31,900
out occasionally, but I feel like lately it's been very, very common.

1247
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:35,460
Like it's more and more of a collectible, a thing that people pursue.

1248
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:36,460
Any interest in this?

1249
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:37,460
Yeah.

1250
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,460
Any interest?

1251
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:40,600
I was just saying, any interest in this from you guys?

1252
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:45,260
I don't want this one, but I bought the Vibrib in one, I mean, on my wall, I have a couple

1253
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:46,600
of weird Al albums.

1254
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,020
He signed one of them.

1255
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:55,140
Um, I have my Xanadu soundtrack on vinyl, so it's like certain things, but I would really

1256
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:56,540
dig having a record player.

1257
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:57,540
Yeah.

1258
01:06:57,540 --> 01:07:01,020
Like especially one of those ones that would do it to USB.

1259
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:02,140
Yeah.

1260
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:03,140
That would be awesome.

1261
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:04,140
That would be cool.

1262
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:05,140
All right.

1263
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:07,340
Uh, do you still have a record player, Loki?

1264
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:10,340
I remember when you used to mix stuff live.

1265
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:14,060
No, I got rid of that stuff a while ago, so I wasn't using it.

1266
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:16,060
So yeah, I don't.

1267
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:17,060
All right.

1268
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:23,380
Uh, DJRMS in chat says, I have, uh, Scott Pilgrim versus the world, the game OST on

1269
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:24,380
vinyl.

1270
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:25,380
Woo.

1271
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:26,380
All right.

1272
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:29,380
Uh, moving on Loki.

1273
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:30,380
Yep.

1274
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:36,420
Uh, so we're waiting to hear what the new titles are that are going to be coming to

1275
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,820
this year.

1276
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:42,020
And Inti Creates, um, has been teasing some new titles.

1277
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:47,260
They have three titles that they say are in development, but we don't know necessarily

1278
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:50,340
what those titles are yet.

1279
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:57,100
Um, I thought I saw online that it's not blaster master, but maybe, maybe it is.

1280
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:58,560
Um, we'll see.

1281
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,060
So I don't know.

1282
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:05,060
It's just a, we know that there's more titles in development maybe coming out this year,

1283
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:10,220
but don't know which classic games or maybe even new franchises that they're planning

1284
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:11,220
on bringing out.

1285
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:15,300
I would, I thought we got confirmation that bloodstains getting a sequel.

1286
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,700
So maybe that's one of them as well.

1287
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,100
I think that is definitely one of them.

1288
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:21,140
I do remember the blood stain getting a sequel story recently.

1289
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:22,140
Yeah.

1290
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:25,380
I think we talked about that like a week or two ago, so I'm sure that's probably one of

1291
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:26,380
them.

1292
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:31,980
Um, a blaster master three, that would be like a blaster master zero part three.

1293
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:35,780
That would be interesting, especially because it would be, it was interesting that it was

1294
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:37,820
inspired from that, you know, original NES game.

1295
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:40,880
And then they, it kind of got a sequel that was just its own thing.

1296
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:45,340
It was independent of any, uh, you know, like the Genesis game or anything else before it,

1297
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:47,140
it was kind of its own own universe.

1298
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:49,980
So that would be cool to see a faster's quest zero.

1299
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:57,100
I honestly, the things I would do and the nasty things I would, I would do that I'm

1300
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:02,580
not going to say on air for them to have gotten somehow the license to reboot the guardian

1301
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:07,980
legend because they did a really good job of blaster master, honestly.

1302
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:11,780
And I feel like if I'm going to play a game like the guardian legend, which is like holy

1303
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:16,180
text to me, and I know it's, it's near and dear to dark soccer's heart as well.

1304
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:18,660
There's only so many companies I would trust with that.

1305
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:23,460
And, and that, that would be one of them based on what they do with blaster master for sure.

1306
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:24,460
So yeah.

1307
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:30,860
Uh, let's see, um, oh, they're still talking about vinyl in the chat.

1308
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:33,740
She Hulk is saying, I have Pac-Man fever on vinyl.

1309
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:40,180
I remember when they used to play that at the roller rink, dated myself a little bit.

1310
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:42,820
All right.

1311
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:43,820
Let's move on.

1312
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:45,980
Uh, let's talk about Stardew Valley.

1313
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:46,980
Still going.

1314
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:52,980
Been around for a couple of years and is about to get a pretty major update 1.5.

1315
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:55,820
So there was a update that came out on PC.

1316
01:09:55,820 --> 01:10:00,220
So this already came out on PC, but we're going to talk a little bit about the consoles.

1317
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:03,700
So the patch was something that just get, they didn't really hype it up or anything.

1318
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,300
It was kind of surprise dropped.

1319
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:11,820
Everybody else is supposed to be getting it in January at the end of the month is the

1320
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:12,820
current timeframe.

1321
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:16,600
It's not like this week, but maybe in three weeks.

1322
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:20,560
So update 1.5 is supposed to be ready by the end of January, but they're not going

1323
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,760
to guarantee that.

1324
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:27,180
Uh, I'm sure with everything that's going on right now, uh, they're also bare out bare

1325
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:28,180
own.

1326
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:29,180
I hope I said that name right.

1327
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:33,080
Who, who puts together the game, uh, is kind of talking about the development process,

1328
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:38,640
talking about that there is a small team that works with them on the updates saying really

1329
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:39,640
small.

1330
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:43,640
Uh, 1.5 was apparently two people that actually put that together.

1331
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,640
So interesting.

1332
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:51,400
Uh, this will also have, um, additional bug fixes that were not present when the PC released,

1333
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:58,320
uh, already what was in this patch, some new people, new goals, new items, a new quest

1334
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:04,440
type, a new farm layout, new character events, community upgrade, home renovations, ducks

1335
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,680
that swim.

1336
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:08,080
Yes, that is one of the bull points.

1337
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,080
Swimming ducks.

1338
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,080
That's right.

1339
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,080
Swimming ducks.

1340
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,040
Uh, you can sit in chairs, you can move your bed.

1341
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:18,680
There are fish tanks, new furniture items, new secrets, and nine new music tracks.

1342
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:21,160
And they say there is more that they don't want to spoil.

1343
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,840
So it is very major update.

1344
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,440
And I know this is a huge game on the switch.

1345
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:29,360
Um, so I'm sure there's a lot, in fact, I know, I know people that play it on the switch

1346
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:33,840
and really like, but before animal crossing came out, Stardew Valley was kind of like

1347
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,160
a game to hold them over, I think for many people.

1348
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:39,760
So, um, I know a lot of people will be looking forward to the console release of this for

1349
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,840
sure.

1350
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,880
So we'll see when it arrives.

1351
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,280
Let's move on to other classics.

1352
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,280
Stark, Sakura.

1353
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:52,800
This is also a very cool, and actually I showed it to Dan when I found this and he was like,

1354
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,080
wow, that's pretty cool.

1355
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:59,840
So, um, in Nintendo 64, you know, pretty, you know, I I'd say it's actually kind of

1356
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,040
a divisive system because not everyone was a big fan.

1357
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:06,160
You know, there was the cartridge base, everything.

1358
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:13,600
However, um, a modder who goes by the name Gunner reconstructed his Nintendo 64 with

1359
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:19,200
some parts from a few other consoles and things like that, and made a portable version.

1360
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:27,760
Um, basically, uh, he goes by G-man mods with a Z, um, was, he was able to make a functioning

1361
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:34,200
Nintendo 64 that is just barely larger than the cartridges themselves.

1362
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,240
It's pretty interesting.

1363
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:43,200
It looks like he took a few, uh, cues, uh, in, uh, configuration from, uh, the switch

1364
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:47,760
just in where the, you know, the, the other triggers are located.

1365
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:56,800
Um, and, uh, he says though, that it does have, uh, some flaws that he calls the gaming

1366
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:02,280
experience a subpar, um, and that it could actually be really uncomfortable to hold.

1367
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:08,480
It has short battery life, but the purpose was to make the world's smallest Nintendo

1368
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:09,480
64.

1369
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:17,480
Um, it makes me think though, that if it was possible for him to do a handheld version

1370
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:27,120
of this, then I don't see why we can't have maybe someplace like analog do a N64 that

1371
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:32,700
could be handheld and then perhaps plugged in, uh, for TV play.

1372
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,520
It just makes me think that it would be possible.

1373
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:39,080
Oh, wait, it'd be possible with no one ever buy it and it'd be, or no one would be ever

1374
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,080
able to buy it.

1375
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:45,200
And it would be way too expensive because that's how all of their consoles are.

1376
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:49,600
Like I would love an NT mini, but I'm not paying $800 for an NES.

1377
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:50,600
I'm sorry.

1378
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:51,600
I'm getting a duo.

1379
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,600
Yeah.

1380
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:56,920
And in chat, Bobby is expressing, please not analog until they can figure out supply.

1381
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:00,920
Uh, sacred Jade saying waiting on analog to develop and ship something is eternity.

1382
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:01,920
All right.

1383
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,040
So maybe I maybe accompany them as an example.

1384
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,040
Yeah.

1385
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,040
Yeah.

1386
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,040
I get it.

1387
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,040
Like do a lot.

1388
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:13,560
But I wish they were in stock and not that expensive, but what, what, what an authentic

1389
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:16,760
Nintendo experience.

1390
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:19,360
It is very authentic in that sense.

1391
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:20,360
Yes.

1392
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,560
Anyway, I get what you mean dark soccer.

1393
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:29,240
Um, and yeah, it, you know, uh, especially with the patent on the hardware has to be

1394
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:32,680
expiring soon if it hasn't already expired.

1395
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:33,680
Right.

1396
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:34,680
That system came out like 96.

1397
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,680
Right.

1398
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:39,120
And what's, what's the timeframe on that 25 years maybe.

1399
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,120
I think so.

1400
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:44,320
Cause we see the, the NES is and the SNES is out there that, you know, play all the

1401
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:49,740
old games that you can buy pretty openly now because I think the, the patents on the hardware

1402
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:51,720
and all that kind of run out at some point.

1403
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:57,440
So it would be about that time where a Nintendo 64 and PlayStation honestly, uh, would, would

1404
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:58,440
be having that as well.

1405
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:02,360
So that's going to be interesting to see where those kind of homebrew consoles go, especially

1406
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,720
when it comes to minis.

1407
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:08,440
I think a lot of people surprised Nintendo did not do their own N64 mini and went a different

1408
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:11,280
route instead with the whole game and watch thing this last year.

1409
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:20,200
So pixel pockets and chat says there are portable gaming devices that run up to PS one and N

1410
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:25,480
64 emulation, but it is emulation and not actual hardware of course, but those are pretty

1411
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:27,640
cheap and decent quality.

1412
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:31,640
So and yeah, some of the things that do Nintendo and Super Nintendo also kind of run through

1413
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:37,200
emulation, uh, sometimes to try to improve the lag and all that stuff for HTMI output

1414
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,200
and all that good stuff.

1415
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,200
So yeah.

1416
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,200
All right.

1417
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:46,240
Well, we'll see, we'll see if, uh, maybe we can, uh, make these things a mass produced

1418
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:47,240
reality someday.

1419
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:48,240
Who knows?

1420
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:49,240
Anyhow, let's move on.

1421
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,280
Loki.

1422
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:51,280
All right.

1423
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:57,280
Um, so let's talk a little bit about, uh, a story that seems to keep coming up every

1424
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:03,080
once in a while about Nintendo going after this company in Japan that keeps, uh, renting

1425
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:10,240
out these go-karts and costumes like, uh, Mario characters to kind of do your own like

1426
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:13,000
Mario Kart tour of Japan.

1427
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,320
Um, and finally though, I believe it is over.

1428
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:25,960
Um, they have, uh, sealed their victory and I guess have been the company Mari car because

1429
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:32,040
they thought that they can change their name and get away with that, um, has been now ordered

1430
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:35,320
to pay the tune of, uh, 10 million yen.

1431
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:42,580
So almost a hundred thousand dollars to Nintendo for unauthorized use of its IPs and safety

1432
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:47,000
concerns, which obviously if you're driving a go-kart in traffic, there could be a problem

1433
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
there.

1434
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:55,940
Um, also, um, so that, that was the original, uh, settling back in 2017.

1435
01:16:55,940 --> 01:17:02,600
So then they went to court again because they changed their name to street cart and said

1436
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:07,800
that they were unrelated to Nintendo stickers on all over the cards, but then they got charged

1437
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:10,640
an even larger fine of 50 million yen.

1438
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:17,160
Um, and then finally, you know, now they are going to have to pay that.

1439
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:21,600
And it sounds like that the street cart company is actually having trouble staying afloat

1440
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,560
being that, you know, there's a pandemic going on.

1441
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:30,100
So, um, yeah, it's interesting to see that going, but I mean, what did they really think

1442
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,100
was going to happen?

1443
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:35,660
I mean, especially, you know, to tie it back to something you were talking about earlier,

1444
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:39,660
you know, now that we know, I think when this all started first going down, we knew that

1445
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:42,720
there was a Nintendo world coming to, to universal.

1446
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:44,780
We didn't know the details of what would be in it.

1447
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:48,980
And now we know, I mean, we speculated there's probably a Mario Kart thing that's going to

1448
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:49,980
be in it.

1449
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:50,980
Now we know for sure.

1450
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:51,980
Yes.

1451
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:55,260
The flagship, you know, e-ticket ride, if you will, is a Mario Kart ride.

1452
01:17:55,260 --> 01:18:00,420
And so, um, of course they want this experience gone because they don't want to create confusion

1453
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:07,540
with the park and, uh, yeah, slapping a sticker on there saying not Nintendo isn't exactly

1454
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:08,540
enough.

1455
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:09,540
No.

1456
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:10,540
So.

1457
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:11,540
Yeah.

1458
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:16,860
So it definitely, definitely, um, not surprised to see it go this way.

1459
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:18,060
Yeah, not at all.

1460
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:22,140
So, um, it'll be interesting to see if they bring the concept back with something else

1461
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:27,300
completely unrelated to Nintendo, but, uh, this money, this fine they owe probably going

1462
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:28,300
to put them out of business.

1463
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:30,620
And especially, I'm sure the pandemic isn't helping.

1464
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:34,420
I don't think things, I think, I think things are a little different over in Japan, but

1465
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:39,780
I, I think, uh, I don't think you have like the, the crowded, busy streets and bustling

1466
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:44,500
activity, uh, that you're used to seeing throughout all this, uh, pandemic stuff going on, you

1467
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,500
know?

1468
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,980
So maybe, maybe later this year, like we're all hoping for everywhere else.

1469
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:48,980
Yeah.

1470
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:49,980
We'll see.

1471
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:50,980
All right.

1472
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:55,260
Well, one more before we get to the classic game of the week, which is not this game,

1473
01:18:55,260 --> 01:19:00,780
but I thought we could talk about a classic anyway, because Gradius three is going to

1474
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:06,860
be coming to the PlayStation four and the switch as the latest arcade archives release,

1475
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:12,700
uh, Gradius three from 1989, uh, which is, you know, it's a, there, there is a story

1476
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:17,180
you go against the bacteria on empire, uh, it, it's a Gradius game.

1477
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:19,220
It looks like a lot of the other Gradius games.

1478
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:23,640
I remember playing this, do you remember on the PSP, there was a Gradius collection that

1479
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:24,640
had them all on it.

1480
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,440
I remember playing this on there, uh, and this is good.

1481
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:32,080
This is the one that has the big, if I is the fire plume levels in it, or was that also

1482
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:35,100
in two, two had that as well.

1483
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:39,220
It looks the, the fire plumes look different in three, it has a very different look to

1484
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:40,220
it.

1485
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:44,360
Um, I don't know how, how do you define Gradius three different than the other two dark soccer?

1486
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:47,960
I'm not sure there's an easy way to do that.

1487
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,720
The end, they're all Gradius, you know?

1488
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:50,720
Yeah, exactly.

1489
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:55,720
Uh, anyway, Gradius three includes a bonus stage from an alternate perspective and hidden

1490
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:58,360
stages with the series past.

1491
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:04,880
So that is all available this week, um, for about eight bucks on the arcade archives,

1492
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:08,840
which is still going, there's over a hundred games that have been released with that.

1493
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:12,840
You know, I totally forgot to mention during my gaming week, speaking of like retro collection

1494
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:18,000
things, I finally played some of that Sega ages stuff I bought on switch.

1495
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,160
I actually spent a bit of time playing fantasy zone, uh, the Sega ages version of that because

1496
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,760
you know, that's a, that's, that's a cute little shooter.

1497
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:29,720
It's the greatest version of that game, but it's really, I love fantasy zone.

1498
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:36,920
It is, it is straight up defender, but they get ages, which say you get ages ones, the,

1499
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:39,960
the Sega ages 20, they didn't do the 2,500 version on that.

1500
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:40,960
Did they?

1501
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,960
I don't think so.

1502
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:42,960
No, this is the original.

1503
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:43,960
Okay.

1504
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:44,960
Nevermind.

1505
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:45,960
I'm just confusing it with the 2,500.

1506
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:46,960
Yeah, no worries.

1507
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,200
So, um, but it was fun.

1508
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,200
Yeah.

1509
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:50,200
I played a little bit of that.

1510
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:53,840
Fantasy star and Alex Kidd, because those are all the games that I bought when the,

1511
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:57,040
cause there was a big sale on all that stuff a couple of weeks ago on the switch.

1512
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,320
So I, I picked up a bunch of them.

1513
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,320
So sorry.

1514
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:03,240
That just kind of sparked that to mind since we were talking about retro stuff that's available

1515
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:09,000
on the switch, even if there's no virtual console per se, I mean, sure there's the,

1516
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,580
you know, Nintendo online library and stuff, but I think you're seeing more and more companies

1517
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:14,560
that are kind of just doing their own types of releases.

1518
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:20,800
If I'm not mistaken, Square Enix just did the, um, they did another collection that

1519
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,560
just came out on, um, the switch.

1520
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:26,600
Was it final fantasy legend that just came out?

1521
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:30,280
There's like a collection of those old game boy games that just came out on switch as

1522
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,280
well.

1523
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,000
So, all right.

1524
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:38,160
Well, speaking of classics, let's take a trip down memory lane with the classic game of

1525
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:40,000
the week.

1526
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,040
Every week, dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and she finds a game that she thinks,

1527
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:49,040
Hey, you guys, you know, you need to, you need to put down your 2020 games.

1528
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:53,040
Nothing good came out this year anyway, besides animal crossing and you need to check out

1529
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,040
this game instead.

1530
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:59,480
Although I got to say before we get to this week's game, cause you picked quite the game

1531
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:00,480
for this week.

1532
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:03,000
Um, I had to start it off with something major.

1533
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:09,920
You had to start off 2021 this, this is, I just have to put the whole, like, this is

1534
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:15,660
not a game that holds up well to what is considered, uh, okay in 2020.

1535
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:19,200
Like this, this game, this game's got some problematic stuff.

1536
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,200
It's it's different time.

1537
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:24,280
So I want to, I want to make that very clear cause I'm about to play footage from the game

1538
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:30,120
and it might be a little bit like, yikes, but I want to find my other, my other link

1539
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:31,120
about it.

1540
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,120
Oh, I'll have to find it.

1541
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:37,640
But we're going to talk about this game for the purposes of commentary and where the hell

1542
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:43,200
did a game like this come from and how did it get the notoriety that it did.

1543
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:46,080
So I, I, I felt this one needed a disclaimer.

1544
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,080
So there you go.

1545
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:49,080
Absolutely needs a disclaimer.

1546
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:54,040
Um, I had a feeling that you would, uh, that you would, uh, say something.

1547
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,040
Well there you go.

1548
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,320
So there's your disclaimer.

1549
01:22:56,320 --> 01:23:03,600
It's a, it is a, it is a choice that's going to make you guys go, Oh, okay.

1550
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,240
So, uh, get to the game, dark saga, please.

1551
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:07,240
All right.

1552
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:10,880
So the game is Boonga Boonga.

1553
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:11,880
Perfect.

1554
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:14,000
Oh, and the movie didn't even play.

1555
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
I didn't have it loaded right.

1556
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,920
Let me fix that real quick and then you'll get that.

1557
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:18,920
All right.

1558
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:27,080
So I picked Boonga Boonga and, um, it was also known as Spank Em.

1559
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:34,960
It was, uh, an arcade game only, thank God, um, that was developed by a South Korean company

1560
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,760
called TAF systems.

1561
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:44,000
And it is the first, and I hope that the only arcade game that simulates something called

1562
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:50,440
Concho, which is a prank where you are poked with two fingers in the butt while you're

1563
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:51,440
distracted.

1564
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:55,040
So yes, it is a Concho game.

1565
01:23:55,040 --> 01:24:02,000
Um, it, uh, it really became, um, by the way, it came out in 2001.

1566
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:09,640
Uh, it really became kind of like a meme when there was a really badly translated, uh, flyer

1567
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:17,040
that went out that showed the banking and the Concho, uh, gameplay.

1568
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:22,640
And um, the game was designed for the Japanese market, according to advertising material

1569
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:27,680
that was actually well received at the 2000 Tokyo game show.

1570
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:35,560
Um, they, the contract was for 200 units, only five were, were distributed.

1571
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:43,880
Um, and now we're going to get into the, uh, the problematic nature of this.

1572
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:48,600
So, and let me go ahead and do a little bit of description of what the cabinet looks like

1573
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:51,080
because all we have up, I think is the video, right?

1574
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:52,080
Yes.

1575
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,800
And the podcast, you just can't even see that.

1576
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:54,920
All right.

1577
01:24:54,960 --> 01:25:03,840
So the, the cabinet is, uh, you've got two aspects of it, kind of like, uh, two thirds

1578
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:10,440
of it has the monitor and the controller and the right hand side has a thing for prizes.

1579
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:17,880
So your controller is a huge, but a gene clad, but I think it is, or slacks or something,

1580
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:24,880
but it is a huge butt and it, uh, you use that.

1581
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:30,720
You actually have a plastic finger controller as well that you use to stick in the butt.

1582
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:35,720
Um, so you have different characters that you can punish.

1583
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:41,440
You have the ex-girlfriend, the ex-boyfriend, uh, Yakuza, uh, the mother-in-law, the gold

1584
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:47,120
digger, the prostitute, the child molester, and the con artist and their facial expression

1585
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:49,360
shows on the monitor.

1586
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:52,720
Um, we'll, we'll get to that a little bit later.

1587
01:25:52,720 --> 01:26:00,480
So, um, you get different cards that rate you on your quote, sexual behavior.

1588
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:06,440
And if you perform exceptionally, you get a small plastic trophy that looks like poop.

1589
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:08,720
So that is the game.

1590
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:11,280
That right there is the game.

1591
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:15,160
And people are looking at this footage and it's, it's almost hard to watch because it's

1592
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:19,200
just so like the expressions they make are, they're not of God, Jamie.

1593
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:20,680
They're not of God.

1594
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:23,600
They're completely unnatural.

1595
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:33,280
So here is the problem is that, um, first of all, I mean, I honestly think that I don't

1596
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:35,200
know how Concho came about.

1597
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:38,800
I've always found that to be a disturbing prank.

1598
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:45,560
I mean, honestly, I think I would rather get, um, you know, have someone be pantsed then

1599
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:48,400
or wedgie then no Concho, but Hey.

1600
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:54,080
Um, but anyway, uh, and yes, I know fifth James school kids do it to people.

1601
01:26:54,080 --> 01:27:00,680
Um, Concho is existed like for an age and it's in all kinds of TV and you name it.

1602
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:04,720
I don't think there's anyone over here who's not familiar with the concept.

1603
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,720
And a lot of kids are assholes.

1604
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:10,760
Like a lot of kids are assholes and they like to apparently play with assholes.

1605
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:13,240
So anyway, anyway.

1606
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:23,720
Um, so basically with this game though, here's what gets to be super problematic about it.

1607
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:36,800
And by the way, uh, the way that it, um, it's really terrible is that, um, like there's

1608
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:44,600
a whole mode in there that, you know, by punishing a mother-in-law or an ex-girlfriend

1609
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:53,880
or something, there's a lot of just misogyny in there, you know, um, like, for example,

1610
01:27:53,880 --> 01:28:03,800
I mean, like most of the characters in there, from what I understand are female and it really

1611
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:08,600
is just like, it's just really problematic.

1612
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:16,080
Um, but in other things too, is like the, the fact that it depends on how you perform,

1613
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:21,040
like if you do it too soft or too hard, they're going to mock you.

1614
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:26,440
And there were, and like I said, there were only five of these that actually were released.

1615
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:33,040
So thank God it didn't get more widespread, but it's still just like, it's creepy, you

1616
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:34,040
know?

1617
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:38,840
And on top of that, I mean, something like this definitely would get like the million

1618
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:41,480
moms, you know, losing their shit about it.

1619
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:44,360
And this time they would actually be losing their shit over something worth losing their

1620
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:45,360
shit over.

1621
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:46,840
This game simply couldn't release today.

1622
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:47,840
It just can't.

1623
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:52,600
Like it's not, it is definitely one of those things where, and I think this might beg the

1624
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:53,600
question.

1625
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,560
So, so why a classic game of the week then?

1626
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:00,060
Well, number one, not every classic game that's ever been picked as a good game.

1627
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:03,500
And sometimes it's about kind of like learning this new, new world.

1628
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:04,500
You sure did.

1629
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:07,820
And, and sometimes it's about learning from where we've been.

1630
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:10,820
And this game is also one of the, in many ways, I think it's kind of like a game of

1631
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:12,380
urban legends.

1632
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:18,380
Like we heard about this game and did, and didn't believe that it actually existed.

1633
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:22,220
And it does anyway, the, the B roll is finally running out and I don't really want to watch

1634
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:23,220
it anymore.

1635
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:24,220
So I'm just coming back to us.

1636
01:29:24,220 --> 01:29:25,220
Yeah.

1637
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:26,220
Just leave it there.

1638
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:34,260
And that was kind of the whole reason why I do the classic game of the week is to outline

1639
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:42,100
things that do exist or have existed or almost existed or has a big impact on the gaming

1640
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:43,220
world.

1641
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:48,460
And this was a meme for an age, an early internet.

1642
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:54,060
I mean, I would even say that this going around the internet, people, people were talking

1643
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:57,380
about it for like a couple of years, you know?

1644
01:29:57,380 --> 01:30:05,220
So this one, uh, I picked it because of its notoriety and the impact it had on gaming

1645
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:06,220
culture.

1646
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:07,220
Interesting.

1647
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:12,220
Interesting that you do a meme-tastic game the week that flash died, which was the source

1648
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:13,700
of all of our memes.

1649
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,500
Bobby got into this on his show a little bit.

1650
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:18,580
No, I think it's, I think it's a funny tie-in in a way.

1651
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:20,620
I wasn't really saying oops.

1652
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:21,620
Oh.

1653
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:27,780
I mean, like, I could also do like the lobster catching game, submarine catcher.

1654
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:28,780
It's it's fine.

1655
01:30:28,780 --> 01:30:29,980
You remember that one, don't you?

1656
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:31,980
Um, I don't think so.

1657
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:32,980
Yeah.

1658
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:37,580
I mean, it's up there with like the table flipping game and we need the table flipping

1659
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:38,580
game now.

1660
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:40,180
I don't know if the table flipping game is 10 years old yet.

1661
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:41,180
Well, it's gotta be.

1662
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:42,180
I don't think so.

1663
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:48,460
It's, it's, but there's also like, but I mean the other like weird one I would have chosen

1664
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:50,060
would have been like submarine catcher.

1665
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:51,820
I just have to see how old it is.

1666
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:57,660
The table flipping game is actually 10 years old, January 22nd, 2010.

1667
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:58,660
Ooh.

1668
01:30:58,660 --> 01:30:59,660
Okay.

1669
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:00,660
So pretty, pretty close.

1670
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:02,620
It is 11 years old eligible.

1671
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:03,620
All right.

1672
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:04,620
Good to know.

1673
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:05,620
Good to know.

1674
01:31:05,620 --> 01:31:07,620
See, we'll see.

1675
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:10,660
Maybe I'll, maybe I'll do like a classic arcade only.

1676
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:14,260
Um, and you, I think you're okay with me bringing it up here.

1677
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:18,980
We're still trying to figure out what the theme might be for your special picks in 2021,

1678
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:20,220
if any.

1679
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:22,740
Maybe this will just be a year with nothing special.

1680
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:26,020
We can highlight the record, but she shot her.

1681
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:28,180
No, I'm not going to do a package slide.

1682
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:29,180
No.

1683
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:30,180
Did you run my SS table flipping game?

1684
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:31,180
Was it magfest?

1685
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:36,580
Uh, table flipping game is in, uh, a lot of content to mall in San Francisco.

1686
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:37,580
Yeah.

1687
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:40,100
A lot of, uh, yeah, there's, it's at the mall in San Francisco and I want to say, don't

1688
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:42,020
they get one in California extreme too.

1689
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:46,420
And there's usually, there's a couple of those that travel around to the different conventions,

1690
01:31:46,420 --> 01:31:52,700
but wasn't magfest the one, um, that it didn't just have the table flipping game, but they

1691
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:56,740
had the whole thing where you could donate like $50 to charity or something and you could

1692
01:31:56,740 --> 01:32:00,300
actually flip a table that they would set up with everything.

1693
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:02,700
Like they had a group of volunteers that would set the table.

1694
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:05,220
You pay 50 bucks and you can actually flip a real day.

1695
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:06,220
Bobby says yes.

1696
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:07,220
Okay.

1697
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:08,220
That's what I thought.

1698
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:09,220
That was the thing.

1699
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:11,620
There's like also like another game along those lines, which is like the, the tablecloth

1700
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:12,880
pulling game.

1701
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:13,880
There's one like that.

1702
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:20,600
There were some different games that were along those lines, but, um, but we'll, we'll,

1703
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:21,600
we'll see.

1704
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:26,120
Cause I'm, I would love to just highlight different weird arcade games.

1705
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:27,120
Okay.

1706
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:32,080
So this segment is the weird arcade game of the month.

1707
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:35,820
That's it officially the fucking weird arcade game of the month.

1708
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:36,820
Weird arcade game of the month.

1709
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:37,820
All right.

1710
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:43,080
No, the fucking weird arcade.

1711
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:46,760
You think you can think of 12 to get us, get us through the year?

1712
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:48,640
Oh, who are you talking to?

1713
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:49,640
All right.

1714
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:50,640
All right.

1715
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:51,640
So there it is.

1716
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:53,800
Your weird fucking arcade game of the month.

1717
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,040
No fucking weird.

1718
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,040
Sorry.

1719
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:57,520
Fucking weird arcade game.

1720
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:58,520
Wait.

1721
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:01,400
So it has been said, I'm sorry.

1722
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:05,520
You just picked the acronym flag flag.

1723
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:09,480
It's the flag flag of the month.

1724
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:10,480
I mean, come on.

1725
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:14,360
This is from the same person who said that our first tournament was going to be called

1726
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:15,360
scat.

1727
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:18,640
At least you didn't do the fucking arcade game of the week or the month.

1728
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:19,920
That's glad you did.

1729
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:20,920
Didn't do that.

1730
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:21,920
All right.

1731
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:25,880
Uh, the fucking weird arcade game of the month.

1732
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:26,880
All right.

1733
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:27,880
Perfect.

1734
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:28,880
Yeah.

1735
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:29,880
The flag.

1736
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:30,880
Tweaky flag.

1737
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,320
And I can't think of anything weirder than Oonga boot.

1738
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:37,800
Is it boonga boonga boonga boonga boonga boonga.

1739
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:38,800
All right.

1740
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:39,800
Or spank them.

1741
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:41,120
All right.

1742
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:44,120
Dark Tetsuya go update the Wiki.

1743
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:50,440
All right, let's get to some rapid fire news because honestly, that's all we have left

1744
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:51,440
for tonight.

1745
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:52,440
Really.

1746
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:54,520
We're going to do some rapid fire news and some release dates, and then we're going to

1747
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:55,520
get to the round table.

1748
01:33:55,520 --> 01:34:00,720
Uh, it's a little shorter tonight just because of this week hasn't had as much going on,

1749
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:04,320
but it gives us a little more time to go check out AGDQ or check out the demo for Loki's

1750
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:07,240
game or whatever else in gaming is going on for you.

1751
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:10,000
So let's travel and look at some rapid fire news pretty quick.

1752
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,720
And by the way, I'm still going to see if it works on a never drive.

1753
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:13,720
So stay tuned.

1754
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:14,720
It does.

1755
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:18,480
If you do an update to it, I get apparently, but like I don't have anything to test on.

1756
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:20,680
So I can't really say.

1757
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:21,680
We can test it.

1758
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:23,680
I told, I told hubs.

1759
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:24,680
Nice.

1760
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:25,680
All right.

1761
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:30,360
Well, eventually it'll be on a cartridge anyway, so I mean, no problem there.

1762
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:36,280
Um, so PlayStation plus, we've got our lineup of games coming out in January, starting off

1763
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:41,480
with man eater on PlayStation five and then for PlayStation four shadow of the tomb Raider

1764
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:43,720
and greed fall.

1765
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:52,440
And then we got the inklings that respawn is working on a brand new franchise or a new

1766
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,320
IP.

1767
01:34:54,320 --> 01:35:00,720
And um, we know that because they have a job listing that says, join a small team being

1768
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:03,260
formed to develop a brand new IP.

1769
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:05,720
So does it get more direct than that?

1770
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:06,840
What that AP is?

1771
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:07,840
Who knows?

1772
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:11,440
We'll find out, I guess eventually, but it is happening.

1773
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:13,360
That's it.

1774
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:14,880
All right.

1775
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:19,800
Uh, let's talk about the worst games of 2020 per Metacritic.

1776
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:22,040
Now I don't know how much stock y'all put Metacritic.

1777
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:26,140
I don't put a lot in it, but it is interesting to see what, you know, some of their number

1778
01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:27,640
crunching does.

1779
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:34,520
So the 10 worst games, according to Metacritic number 10 is the elder scrolls blades on the

1780
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:40,200
switch and that's the one that I've played and I'm like, is it, I get why people don't

1781
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,200
like it.

1782
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:42,200
It does.

1783
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:48,840
It does dumb down the elder scrolls formula a little bit too much and yeah, I mean it's

1784
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:53,880
probably not totally worth your time, but I don't, I didn't like hate it, but it definitely

1785
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:58,360
is not, it does not have the depth of an actual elder scrolls game and I think people kind

1786
01:35:58,360 --> 01:36:00,280
of see right through that.

1787
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:03,520
These others, I haven't played any of these others that are on the list.

1788
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:09,640
With an average score of 42, the ninth worst game was gleam light for the switch.

1789
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:15,280
With an average score of 41 street power soccer for the PlayStation four was number eight

1790
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:20,760
with an average score of 40 tamarin on the PlayStation four was the seventh worst game

1791
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:21,760
of the year.

1792
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:30,920
A number, uh, sorry, a score of 39 remothered broken porcelain for the PC was a two broken

1793
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:32,600
and buggy for this year.

1794
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:39,440
Uh, number five was arc of alchemist for the switch, uh, people complaining about its dated

1795
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:42,140
graphics and not great story.

1796
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:45,960
Number four, the fourth worst game of the year with an average score of 34 for the PC

1797
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:48,800
fast and furious crossroads.

1798
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:54,360
Yes, to be confused with the fast and furious movie because it was a tie into that game.

1799
01:36:54,360 --> 01:37:00,560
Uh, the third worst game of the year on the PlayStation four dawn of fear, the second

1800
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:03,400
worst game of the year, oops, I accidentally went ahead here.

1801
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:09,680
The second worst game of the year, the 13 remake X I I I is kind of how it stylized

1802
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:10,680
with the Roman numerals.

1803
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:16,880
Uh, the remake of 13 for the Xbox one because it was bugs, bugs, bugs, and the developer

1804
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:21,100
actually put out an apology average score of 32.

1805
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:28,080
So what was worse than that with an average score of 29 the worst game of 2020 is tiny

1806
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,200
racer for the switch.

1807
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:36,500
A $10 racing game where you take miniature cars through kitchens and forests and apparently

1808
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:44,160
the game play stinks and that is the worst game of 2020 according to Metacritic again,

1809
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:46,320
however you feel about that.

1810
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:51,680
That's kind of subjective I think because like, I don't know, like I think some of those

1811
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:56,280
games aren't at so bad on there, but like there's some like shadow of the Ronin revenge

1812
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:59,520
of the samurai that didn't make the list, which really should.

1813
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:02,560
If you've ever played that game, which I hope you haven't.

1814
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:08,200
It's a real PlayStation four game and it's, it's really awful.

1815
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:15,040
Um, and there's the guy that makes these games basically does, it's just this giant empty

1816
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:20,320
void of nothing that you run around forever and then you fight one monster, they'll immediately

1817
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:21,840
kill you and that's it.

1818
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:27,440
And um, yeah, I'm surprised that that didn't make the list.

1819
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:31,040
I guess no one's played it, so no one's reviewed it.

1820
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:37,280
And again, I completely understand if you do not want to put all of your stock in Metacritic,

1821
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:41,160
but you know, since we addressed earlier in the show, I had that question from No One

1822
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:44,360
Special last week where it was like, what is the worst game of the year?

1823
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:45,360
I don't know.

1824
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:48,660
I wanted to kind of throw something in here where it's like, but here's what other people

1825
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:50,360
are saying.

1826
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:54,480
So and why I'm kind of like, I don't know if Elder Scrolls Blades is the worst thing

1827
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:58,800
I've played this year, but I guess it wasn't great, but yeah.

1828
01:38:58,800 --> 01:38:59,800
All right.

1829
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:01,360
Anyway, let's move on.

1830
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:04,840
Dark Sakura has one more, I think for us, a rapid fire story.

1831
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:14,240
Um, the Doom account celebrated 2021 with something that there, it was a thing for a

1832
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,240
while.

1833
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:24,760
Um, but it is a picture of Doom Guy and Isabelle, their, uh, nendoroid, uh, uh, figures skipping

1834
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:32,360
along hand in hand amongst some potted plants with the name Happy New Horizons.

1835
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:35,440
So the meme will not die in 2021.

1836
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:36,960
The name will not, the meme will not die.

1837
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:38,480
They are the best of friends.

1838
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:42,040
I hope Doom Guy becomes a, uh, they should just do like, you know, when they have the

1839
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:45,000
next smash announcement of the people that are being added to it.

1840
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:49,800
Just have a two for have, you know, Isabelle and Doom Guy in there.

1841
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:50,800
Yeah.

1842
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,800
Isabelle's in there, but it would be great.

1843
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:53,800
Yeah.

1844
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:54,800
Isabelle's character already.

1845
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:55,800
Okay.

1846
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:56,800
Oh yeah.

1847
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:57,800
Yeah.

1848
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:58,800
Her little intro was adorable too.

1849
01:39:58,800 --> 01:39:59,800
Yeah.

1850
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:01,160
She's she was Doom Guy in there.

1851
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:02,160
Yeah.

1852
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:05,000
Doom Guy would actually be kind of a neat addition.

1853
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,080
And I think these memes only play into it a little more.

1854
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:12,360
Um, I don't know if Doom Guy is necessarily a Nintendo thing, but let's be real.

1855
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:14,760
We're getting to the point where there's a lot of characters in there that I don't

1856
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:17,120
always associate with Nintendo platforms.

1857
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:18,120
So why not?

1858
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:21,040
I think it'd be funny if Doom Guy got in there.

1859
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:22,440
All right.

1860
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:26,040
Let's travel around the world and check out what games are coming out this week.

1861
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:28,960
I don't know if we have a lot, but I'll check.

1862
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:29,960
We do it every week.

1863
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:32,880
Loki, do we have any games coming out this week in the US?

1864
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:37,840
There's not a lot, but there are a couple, so we have werewolf, the apocalypse heart

1865
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:40,640
of the forest on Nintendo switch.

1866
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:46,440
And then we've Iris fall, uh, which is in the switch PlayStation four and X-Box one.

1867
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:47,660
That's it.

1868
01:40:47,660 --> 01:40:50,080
My Japanese releases are empty.

1869
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:53,040
I do not have anything this week in Japan, dark soccer.

1870
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:55,040
What about the UK?

1871
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:56,040
Equally empty.

1872
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:57,040
Yeah.

1873
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:59,400
It's quite weak, but we always check in.

1874
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:00,400
So at least there's a cut.

1875
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:02,600
There's like two games Loki named here in the US.

1876
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:03,600
There is that.

1877
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:04,600
Yeah.

1878
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:05,600
All right.

1879
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:08,600
Um, I am going to open up the round table.

1880
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:12,560
If you guys have any questions in chat and anything you want to ask us, uh, now is a

1881
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,480
great time, uh, to put that in.

1882
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:17,040
I also don't know if we have any main emails tonight.

1883
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:18,040
Did we dark?

1884
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:19,040
We have one.

1885
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:20,040
Oh, we have one.

1886
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:21,040
Okay.

1887
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,240
Before you read it, I did, I guess I already mentioned this in the show, but I had it here

1888
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:24,480
as a placeholder, so I wouldn't forget.

1889
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:26,000
And I'll mention it again.

1890
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,920
Awesome games done quick is this week.

1891
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:29,920
And for those of you that are watching on Twitch, stay tuned.

1892
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:33,520
Um, after we're done here at OLR, we'll be going to raid that presentation.

1893
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:38,880
Um, and I, I think we'll be hosting that pretty much on VOG throughout the entire week.

1894
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:44,120
Um, so if you want to chat about it with other folks, uh, and, and, and possibly I'll probably

1895
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:47,280
be in there when Bobby's doing the hosting stuff, cause you know, our comments kind of

1896
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:48,920
get lost in the big chat.

1897
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:50,980
Um, so we will, we will be hosting it.

1898
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:54,040
If you want to chat with some of us, you can do that in the VOG chat room.

1899
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:57,000
Uh, cause I think we did that last time and it worked out pretty well.

1900
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,840
So I'm check that out throughout the week.

1901
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:00,280
Um, all right.

1902
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:02,000
So I've mentioned it twice now, so I know I'm good.

1903
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,260
So let's get to that email.

1904
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:18,060
If you want to send us an email, participate at orange lounge, radio.com, uh, dark soccer.

1905
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:20,460
Do you want to get to the email tonight?

1906
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:23,980
Yeah, no, it got really quiet for a moment and I thought you were saying something else.

1907
01:42:23,980 --> 01:42:24,980
So sorry.

1908
01:42:24,980 --> 01:42:25,980
No, you're good.

1909
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:26,980
Okay.

1910
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:27,980
Hello.

1911
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:31,100
Congratulations to everyone on surviving 2020.

1912
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:37,260
Hopefully we'll all get, I'll get shot soon and see things getting back to sort of almost

1913
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:38,260
normal.

1914
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:42,660
I know I'm really looking forward to actually going out in public and playing DDR again.

1915
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:46,900
Last week you mentioned all of the Xbox 360 halo games going offline.

1916
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:49,060
I just wanted to point out two things.

1917
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:52,700
First that only specific servers for those games are being shut down.

1918
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:56,580
You will still be able to play the games, earn most of their achievements and even continue

1919
01:42:56,580 --> 01:43:01,220
to play custom multiplayer matches with friends as well as multiplayer games over land or

1920
01:43:01,220 --> 01:43:08,020
split screen matchmaking files, sharing online stats and online challenges, specific things

1921
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:10,220
that are going away.

1922
01:43:10,220 --> 01:43:15,340
Second thing is that literally all of the games affected are also natively available

1923
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:20,100
on Xbox one where they will remain available and fully supported.

1924
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:25,700
Most of the titles are included in the master chief collection.

1925
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:30,340
The two that aren't halo wars and Spartan assault are natively available on their own.

1926
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:33,740
If you're a game pass subscriber, you already have access to all of these.

1927
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:37,660
If not, they're usually offered at deep discounts during every major sale.

1928
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:42,580
Heck they're on sale right now, though only for a few more hours buying them all together

1929
01:43:42,580 --> 01:43:47,220
would cost about $35 at the moment, which is not bad for an entire series.

1930
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:50,660
So I guess what I'm essentially saying is that this shouldn't be a big deal for most

1931
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:51,740
people.

1932
01:43:51,740 --> 01:43:58,940
I suppose only the folks truly affected are those people still regularly playing on Xbox

1933
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:00,060
360s.

1934
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:03,900
As popular as it was, I can't imagine that there are too many of those left.

1935
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:06,820
There's also people who don't own the newer systems.

1936
01:44:06,820 --> 01:44:07,820
Just saying.

1937
01:44:07,820 --> 01:44:08,820
Yeah.

1938
01:44:08,820 --> 01:44:14,060
I think also, sorry, I know there's more email, but just to kind of address that bullet point.

1939
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:15,060
You're right.

1940
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:16,980
And I don't want to dismiss anything YYR is saying.

1941
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:21,000
I think Microsoft's done an excellent job of making sure the game is still playable

1942
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,560
for most.

1943
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:25,960
That being said, there, you know, cause we love our retro here on the show.

1944
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:30,400
Of course, there is going to be a subsection of people that are very interested in playing

1945
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:37,440
the game as it was in its original form, in its OG form, because as much as you know,

1946
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:42,040
Microsoft's done a very good job porting that over with the, uh, master chief collection

1947
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:43,040
and so forth.

1948
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:46,080
There's always going to be a couple of people that are going to wonder what was it like

1949
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,560
beforehand?

1950
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:53,080
But I, I, I do like, I don't necessarily disagree with what YYR is saying.

1951
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:54,240
Like there's, you're right.

1952
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:59,080
There's, there's a lot of ways to still experience Halo and play it and have a good time.

1953
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:03,960
Um, it's just, I think more of that archivist, you know, person that wants to see it in a

1954
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:08,400
museum someday looking back and going, well, that's a bummer that the online is gone, but

1955
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:10,320
we all know online never stays around forever.

1956
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:11,320
Right.

1957
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:14,520
So anyway, sorry, Jamie, but wanted to put that in there.

1958
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:19,080
And by saying that I'm currently putting the finishing touches on the Pixel Poops remake,

1959
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:23,960
I'm still on track to release sometime this month, though, I'm guessing it'll wind up

1960
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:25,400
being toward the end.

1961
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:30,000
The Commodore version definitely needs a bit more time in the oven as well.

1962
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:34,920
I should be posting on the vlog discord sometime this week regarding testing opportunities.

1963
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:36,840
So please look forward to that.

1964
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:40,020
Happy pooping and of course happy gaming on the whole.

1965
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:42,160
Happy new year, Aaron YYR.

1966
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:43,760
Thank you for the update YYR.

1967
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:50,200
I'm excited to play both versions of Pixel Poop, all the poop this year between the two

1968
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:52,640
games that YYR is doing and the one that Loki's doing.

1969
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:57,280
This is definitely the year of poop, as he said in that direct a couple of weeks ago.

1970
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:59,280
So love it.

1971
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:01,160
All right.

1972
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:02,160
That's it for emails, right?

1973
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:03,160
Yes.

1974
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:04,160
Okay.

1975
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:10,360
If you want to send us an email for a future week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1976
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:13,560
So I want to get some of the comments and questions from chat.

1977
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:18,240
chatdeftinchat says, when are we finally doing an Among Us night?

1978
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:19,600
Great question.

1979
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:24,520
After AGDQ, but I really want to make sure we get that in sometime this month or I'll

1980
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:26,040
keep putting it off.

1981
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:31,760
So probably mid month and I'll try to stew on a good day with Bobby.

1982
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,180
I'm assuming he wants to do it.

1983
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:37,040
If he doesn't want to do it, then I'll work on it with Shane, who I know wants to do it.

1984
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:40,060
And we'll try to get that like in the middle of it.

1985
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:44,520
We got to get past AGDQ and I want to let Bobby get past his shifts and stuff before

1986
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:47,400
we really worry about that.

1987
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:49,820
But in the next week or two after that, for sure.

1988
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:52,980
Oh, and some people are saying I just bought the game on the Steam sale.

1989
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:55,660
Oh, that should be fun.

1990
01:46:55,660 --> 01:46:56,660
Other questions.

1991
01:46:56,660 --> 01:46:57,660
Oh, this is good.

1992
01:46:57,660 --> 01:47:02,320
Azet in chat says, should I submit the street light in front of my house for a Pokestop

1993
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:03,320
or gym?

1994
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:04,820
Sarcasm implied.

1995
01:47:04,820 --> 01:47:05,820
Okay.

1996
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:08,200
So true story.

1997
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:11,740
There was a virtual Ingress event that was going on yesterday.

1998
01:47:11,740 --> 01:47:15,340
And sometimes what people do is they'll get on to because, you know, it's been virtual

1999
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:17,420
Ingress events for like nine months.

2000
01:47:17,420 --> 01:47:19,300
So people do like recharging of portals.

2001
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:24,760
And then they also go on to I still call it OPR because that's what used to be called

2002
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:25,760
back in the day.

2003
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:26,760
Operation Portal Recon.

2004
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:29,020
I think it's called Niantic Wayfarer is what it's called now.

2005
01:47:29,020 --> 01:47:33,320
And we go in and we review submissions together and they're getting worse and worse.

2006
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:37,200
You guys like I was in there reviewing and there was a couple good ones that there was

2007
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:42,860
a couple like, you know, play structures at parks, like the best ones I always see

2008
01:47:42,860 --> 01:47:48,100
are new parks where the street view doesn't show that the park is even built yet.

2009
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:51,320
But the photos clearly show there's now a park there.

2010
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:53,840
And that's like the best stuff that gets submitted.

2011
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:55,460
But then there's so much garbage.

2012
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:59,740
You guys like I saw street signs that were getting submitted.

2013
01:47:59,740 --> 01:48:03,740
I saw one where it was a street sign being submitted.

2014
01:48:03,740 --> 01:48:06,900
And I was like, this street sign is bad.

2015
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:10,180
But how is this little free library in the game?

2016
01:48:10,180 --> 01:48:11,180
It shouldn't be in there either.

2017
01:48:11,180 --> 01:48:14,200
I actually put in the note, I'm like, get rid of the little free library next to it

2018
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:16,800
because it's like in somebody's backyard.

2019
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:18,560
If you look at where the pin is, it's terrible.

2020
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,360
It's never gotten through the system.

2021
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:25,380
Unfortunately, there are people and I knew this would happen when they let Pokemon Go

2022
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:26,880
players into there.

2023
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,840
And I'm not shading Pokemon Go players.

2024
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:31,580
I play it too.

2025
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:38,800
But the thing is, is that the Pokemon mentality is the more stops, the more gyms, the better

2026
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:40,500
more and more and more and more and more.

2027
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:42,760
And I get that because you want to be able to spin everything.

2028
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:46,440
Who doesn't want to spin on their house for Pokeballs?

2029
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:51,560
That is the worst possible thing for Ingress, which is a very player versus player type

2030
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:52,560
of thing.

2031
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:54,060
And there's what you would think.

2032
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:59,480
I just wish that like at some point Niantic, if they're going to allow Pokemon players

2033
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:03,580
to approve things, then only let it be approved for Pokemon.

2034
01:49:03,580 --> 01:49:05,700
Do not let it cross over in Ingress.

2035
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:06,700
Because it's getting annoying.

2036
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:07,980
It's the Harry Potter thing too.

2037
01:49:07,980 --> 01:49:08,980
Oh yeah.

2038
01:49:08,980 --> 01:49:11,820
I always forget about Harry Potter because of her.

2039
01:49:11,820 --> 01:49:13,220
But I just quit playing all of them.

2040
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:14,220
Yeah.

2041
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:16,880
But the you're right.

2042
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:18,220
That all affects that too.

2043
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:21,860
But even generally for Harry Potter, the more the better, I think.

2044
01:49:21,860 --> 01:49:24,640
So it's kind of the same thing as the Pokemon thing.

2045
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:26,620
So it's just, oh yeah.

2046
01:49:26,620 --> 01:49:28,940
Azet saw a literal rock yesterday.

2047
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:30,400
Yep.

2048
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:31,400
That was the thing.

2049
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:38,480
I saw, I got a stop in Mexico and I'm always usually like, okay, I know these like places

2050
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:44,540
like Puerto Rico, Mexico, certain parts, remote Canada, you know, some of these other areas,

2051
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:46,080
they need more stuff.

2052
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:50,840
But the submission I got in Mexico was a telephone poll.

2053
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:54,520
Wasn't painted or anything, just a telephone poll.

2054
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:57,520
So it was, it was a no.

2055
01:49:57,540 --> 01:49:58,980
The description was in Spanish.

2056
01:49:58,980 --> 01:50:01,140
I didn't even need to run it through Google Translate.

2057
01:50:01,140 --> 01:50:04,020
I was like, I know what this is and it's garbage.

2058
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:10,560
And the supporting statement is always, our neighborhood needs a Pokestop.

2059
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:13,240
We need a Pokestop to engage more.

2060
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:15,380
There's so many people here that would love a Pokestop.

2061
01:50:15,380 --> 01:50:19,820
I think I had one that was a laundry room in an apartment complex that was like, the

2062
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:22,060
community needs a Pokestop here.

2063
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:24,580
We're trying to make a gym and all this stuff.

2064
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:32,200
I'm going to be honest, if that wording is in your justification, I'm already like down

2065
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:35,060
a point in my mind.

2066
01:50:35,060 --> 01:50:39,780
If your only justification is we need a Pokestop, you're already down a point.

2067
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:44,080
I have a, I don't want to say I always deny, but because there have been a couple that

2068
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:48,900
were like park, again, like the park sign example where it's like, this park could use

2069
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:52,160
a Pokestop, it's brand new and was just built.

2070
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:54,220
I'm like, okay, fair.

2071
01:50:54,220 --> 01:50:55,780
It meets criteria.

2072
01:50:55,780 --> 01:51:00,780
I don't love that they're, they're relying only on Pokestop, but I get it.

2073
01:51:00,780 --> 01:51:02,780
Pokemon Go is the large game.

2074
01:51:02,780 --> 01:51:08,540
That's where people's brains are at, but you know, just, just remember, it's not only Pokemon

2075
01:51:08,540 --> 01:51:10,640
people that are reviewing those.

2076
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:16,860
So anyway, uh, Tiger Claw says there's a gym located near a Burger King that used to be

2077
01:51:16,860 --> 01:51:18,160
a Pokestop.

2078
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:22,280
That will happen when another Pokestop nearby gets promoted.

2079
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:25,340
There's a whole science to it and I won't get into it too much on here.

2080
01:51:25,340 --> 01:51:30,220
You can read about it online, but basically if you take the map of the world and you split

2081
01:51:30,220 --> 01:51:38,060
it up into itty bitty squares, if there's two Pokestops in a square, one becomes a gym.

2082
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:43,580
If there's five Pokestops in a gym, or excuse me, five Pokestops in a square, two become

2083
01:51:43,580 --> 01:51:46,020
a gym or is it seven?

2084
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:47,300
Is that correct me if I'm wrong.

2085
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:50,880
She knows more about this stuff than I do, but it's depending on how many things are

2086
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:53,320
in that square, you get more and more gyms.

2087
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:57,940
So the reason why the Burger King became a gym is because something became a stop right

2088
01:51:57,940 --> 01:51:59,300
by it.

2089
01:51:59,300 --> 01:52:04,740
And I'll give you this tip because not as many people talk about this tip, but we've

2090
01:52:04,740 --> 01:52:06,920
done it.

2091
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:13,920
If you want to control which of the two becomes a gym, you can do that, but you have to have

2092
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:15,080
ingress.

2093
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:21,640
You don't even have to have a high level account, you can have a level one account.

2094
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:26,160
The portal in ingress, because they're all portals in ingress, the portal that has more

2095
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:32,600
up-boats on the photos combined overall will become the gym.

2096
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:38,720
So this has happened, and I'll admit to this, is that some of the locals here will say,

2097
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:41,280
hey, I got a new portal, it's over here.

2098
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:46,540
This is going to trigger a gym, which one makes more sense to be the gym?

2099
01:52:46,540 --> 01:52:51,440
And we'll all go up-boat the photo on the one we want to be the gym so that it pushes

2100
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:53,000
that as the gym.

2101
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,040
So there it is.

2102
01:52:55,040 --> 01:53:00,800
So you can work the system in control, but you only have the 24 hours from when it goes

2103
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:04,440
live to when it promotes to work that out.

2104
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:09,640
Because once something becomes a gym, it doesn't regress based on the thumbs up.

2105
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:14,600
The only way it regresses from being a gym is if it gets removed.

2106
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:19,080
I think even if there's only one, I think if the other stop gets removed and you still

2107
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:20,640
have a gym, I think it stays a gym.

2108
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:23,960
I don't think anything demotes to stops ever.

2109
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:26,640
So anyway, there you go.

2110
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:27,640
The more you know.

2111
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:28,640
All right.

2112
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:35,920
And as that is clarifying that an S14 cell, two to five portals is a gym and six plus

2113
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:37,060
equals another gym.

2114
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:38,780
So six is the magic number.

2115
01:53:38,780 --> 01:53:39,780
All right.

2116
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:40,780
There you go.

2117
01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:43,420
A little science on that for your GPS.

2118
01:53:43,420 --> 01:53:49,140
And again, I encourage people to submit pokey stops, but please just submit legit things.

2119
01:53:49,140 --> 01:53:54,120
Lots of signs on trails are great and we don't really have enough of them.

2120
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:56,580
There's surely a walking trail in your neighborhood.

2121
01:53:56,580 --> 01:54:00,780
Just make sure you get the sign that officially designates it as a trail.

2122
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:04,140
Parks, especially if there's new ones, great.

2123
01:54:04,140 --> 01:54:05,200
Churches, great.

2124
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:06,460
Just make sure.

2125
01:54:06,460 --> 01:54:10,580
Try to stay away from gated churches or if it's going to be a gated church, then put

2126
01:54:10,580 --> 01:54:14,020
it on the sign that's out in the street and not inside the gates.

2127
01:54:14,020 --> 01:54:16,660
I think that's much better.

2128
01:54:16,660 --> 01:54:19,180
And you know, that type of stuff is great and fine.

2129
01:54:19,180 --> 01:54:22,380
And I have no problem approving those types of things.

2130
01:54:22,380 --> 01:54:27,820
But just what was the other here's the here's the all star winner from yesterday.

2131
01:54:27,820 --> 01:54:34,380
I think this is before we were chatting is that I got a trophy in someone's house.

2132
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:39,300
It was a picture of a trophy in someone's house and it said their name and what award

2133
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:40,300
they won.

2134
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:43,460
And so when I rejected it, I put in the description.

2135
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:49,780
Would so and so please stop submitting pokey stops where their name is easily identifiable?

2136
01:54:49,780 --> 01:54:53,300
And I said that is my reasoning.

2137
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:56,300
All right.

2138
01:54:56,300 --> 01:55:01,900
Anyway, sadly, they don't they don't use I don't think they copy paste those reasonings

2139
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:02,900
when they deny it.

2140
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:07,660
I wish they would, because I've put some really like shady things in there that deserve to

2141
01:55:07,660 --> 01:55:08,660
be read.

2142
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:09,660
All right.

2143
01:55:09,660 --> 01:55:10,780
Anyway, I think that's enough.

2144
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:12,740
No more emails tonight.

2145
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:17,100
So I think we're getting to the point where we wrap up the show.

2146
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:18,460
Some last minute stories.

2147
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:19,460
Oh, do you last minute stories?

2148
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:20,460
All right.

2149
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:21,460
Sure.

2150
01:55:21,460 --> 01:55:22,460
Yeah.

2151
01:55:22,460 --> 01:55:23,460
Did you say you had one too, Jamie?

2152
01:55:23,460 --> 01:55:24,780
I do have one and I just have one.

2153
01:55:24,780 --> 01:55:27,300
Why don't you go first, Jamie, then we'll do Loki.

2154
01:55:27,300 --> 01:55:28,300
Yeah.

2155
01:55:28,700 --> 01:55:35,100
Jared Nandan, who cosplayed as the South Park guy who play World of Warcraft, he died of

2156
01:55:35,100 --> 01:55:36,100
COVID-19.

2157
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:37,100
That's terrible.

2158
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:43,060
He was a big mainstay in the community, big cosplayer.

2159
01:55:43,060 --> 01:55:48,260
And he's actually a friend of some of my other friends.

2160
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:53,220
So and he would go to the cons.

2161
01:55:53,220 --> 01:55:57,820
He had like his computer, kind of a computer that recreated the one in the show and the

2162
01:55:57,820 --> 01:56:03,660
table with all the candy and rock stars on it and everything.

2163
01:56:03,660 --> 01:56:04,660
And does L.T.J.

2164
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:05,660
Rama ask?

2165
01:56:05,660 --> 01:56:06,780
No, I didn't know him in person.

2166
01:56:06,780 --> 01:56:10,220
I have friends who know him.

2167
01:56:10,220 --> 01:56:14,700
So I had heard things peripherally from other people.

2168
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:19,140
So it was just sort of like six degrees kind of thing.

2169
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:23,540
But yeah, he died for COVID.

2170
01:56:23,540 --> 01:56:28,420
There is a GoFundMe and Rama just said it, there's a GoFundMe to support the funeral

2171
01:56:28,420 --> 01:56:31,460
costs for his family.

2172
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:37,740
So we can put it somewhere for people to find.

2173
01:56:37,740 --> 01:56:41,860
But if you can help, please consider helping.

2174
01:56:41,860 --> 01:56:43,220
That's sad.

2175
01:56:43,220 --> 01:56:47,120
It's hitting more and more close to home every day.

2176
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:49,740
So please, please, please take precautions, folks.

2177
01:56:49,740 --> 01:56:53,300
I think most people listening to this show are, I don't need to lecture everybody, but

2178
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:59,500
I'm just, you know, you don't think it'll affect you or anyone, you know, until it does.

2179
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:00,500
That's the thing about it.

2180
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:05,620
So actually, if Rama will post it, then I'd appreciate it.

2181
01:57:05,620 --> 01:57:06,620
Yeah.

2182
01:57:06,620 --> 01:57:07,620
All right.

2183
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:08,620
Loki, let's go to it.

2184
01:57:08,620 --> 01:57:10,700
Let's go to you.

2185
01:57:10,700 --> 01:57:20,580
So I had a mod that's been created for Cyberpunk 2077 to allow for a sort of working third

2186
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:24,020
person mod, which is kind of cool to be able to play it that game that way.

2187
01:57:24,020 --> 01:57:28,540
Now it's not perfect because there is quite the process to install it.

2188
01:57:28,540 --> 01:57:32,220
Plus it doesn't work in cut scenes because the game was meant to be played in a first

2189
01:57:32,220 --> 01:57:33,480
person view.

2190
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:37,780
So there's not really a way to alter the cameras that much.

2191
01:57:37,780 --> 01:57:39,860
But it is still something.

2192
01:57:39,860 --> 01:57:43,400
So that's kind of cool that it is available.

2193
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:47,900
And if you want to check it out, of course, it's on Nexus mods, so go check it out there.

2194
01:57:47,900 --> 01:57:48,900
Awesome.

2195
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:49,900
Anything else?

2196
01:57:50,220 --> 01:57:52,220
That's it.

2197
01:57:52,220 --> 01:57:53,780
All right.

2198
01:57:53,780 --> 01:57:56,100
Then I think with that, we're about ready to wrap the show up again.

2199
01:57:56,100 --> 01:57:59,500
I know it's a little shorter tonight, but with the holiday and everything, it just that's

2200
01:57:59,500 --> 01:58:00,500
the way it was going to work out.

2201
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:04,260
We kind of knew that we will be back next week, however, in seven days to talk about

2202
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:08,540
whatever happens in the gaming industry next week, we will also be making our 2021 predictions

2203
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:09,540
next week.

2204
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:13,160
So that should be fun with you guys in our chat over Twitch TV slash VOG network.

2205
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:15,940
So we'll help you join us in seven days.

2206
01:58:15,940 --> 01:58:19,340
Thank you again for tuning in and watching the show, whether you watched it here on Twitch

2207
01:58:19,780 --> 01:58:24,020
or whether you listened to the podcast feed on a popular podcast platforms like iTunes

2208
01:58:24,020 --> 01:58:28,020
and Spotify, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has the

2209
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:29,020
voice.

2210
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:33,740
But if the gamers aren't here to have their opinions read, then we don't have enough voices.

2211
01:58:33,740 --> 01:58:34,740
We always use more.

2212
01:58:34,740 --> 01:58:36,340
Tell a friend or two about the show.

2213
01:58:36,340 --> 01:58:38,660
Help us spread the word about the show.

2214
01:58:38,660 --> 01:58:43,180
If you are interested in helping the show out, you can always support our shop over

2215
01:58:43,180 --> 01:58:44,620
at VOG network dot com.

2216
01:58:44,620 --> 01:58:46,780
That's VOG network dot com slash shop.

2217
01:58:46,780 --> 01:58:51,460
You can pick up some cool merchandise, including the OLR shirt that Loki's wearing on Twitch

2218
01:58:51,460 --> 01:58:52,560
tonight.

2219
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:55,860
And I got to say, I really like the VOG shirt that I bought there.

2220
01:58:55,860 --> 01:58:57,320
It's a great shirt and good material.

2221
01:58:57,320 --> 01:59:02,980
So I and I'm not just saying that because I want the sale is it is a nice shirt.

2222
01:59:02,980 --> 01:59:05,480
So definitely encourage you to check out the shop.

2223
01:59:05,480 --> 01:59:08,500
We will be adding to it throughout the year.

2224
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:10,500
Just not this week.

2225
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:11,500
So check that out.

2226
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:13,600
I think that's it.

2227
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:16,540
Let's go around now and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap up for the night.

2228
01:59:16,540 --> 01:59:18,460
So, Loki, I'll start with you.

2229
01:59:18,460 --> 01:59:19,460
Your final thought tonight.

2230
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:23,020
I'm just going to have to be working on my game quite a bit.

2231
01:59:23,020 --> 01:59:28,900
So hopefully we'll see some more progress on that soon.

2232
01:59:28,900 --> 01:59:33,820
And my final thought is, you know, just a continued message.

2233
01:59:33,820 --> 01:59:35,940
I guess I already said this, but, you know, stay safe.

2234
01:59:35,940 --> 01:59:38,820
Please take precautions.

2235
01:59:38,820 --> 01:59:40,100
We're almost there.

2236
01:59:40,100 --> 01:59:41,400
We're almost there.

2237
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:46,320
If we can just get to the next administration who might get vaccines out a little bit faster

2238
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:50,720
than the current one and so forth, we may have light at the end of the tunnel.

2239
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:53,720
And please consider getting vaccinated when it's available.

2240
01:59:53,720 --> 02:00:01,700
I'm a little shocked at how many people are resisting the idea after all the clinical

2241
02:00:01,700 --> 02:00:06,120
trials that things went through and everybody that is saying and all the doctors and medical

2242
02:00:06,120 --> 02:00:08,140
experts that are saying it's safe.

2243
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:09,520
I can't wait to get mine.

2244
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:13,980
I'll be as soon as they let me I won't get so dark soccer.

2245
02:00:13,980 --> 02:00:16,360
Your final thought tonight.

2246
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:21,460
I wish that we would implement what they did in Indonesia, that if you refuse to wear a

2247
02:00:21,460 --> 02:00:26,960
mask and I'll even add refuse to get the vaccine, you have to bury the bodies.

2248
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:27,960
That's it.

2249
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:28,960
Morbid.

2250
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:29,960
But yes.

2251
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:30,960
All right.

2252
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:31,960
Have a great week, everybody.

2253
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:32,960
We'll see you in seven days.

2254
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:34,760
Happy gaming.

2255
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:36,640
Try to make the best of the situation.

2256
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:38,000
Enjoy your comfort games.

2257
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:41,560
OK, enjoy your backlog, whatever it is you're gaming.

2258
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:42,560
Have fun.

2259
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:44,500
And we'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2260
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:45,500
Have a great night, everyone.

2261
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:46,500
