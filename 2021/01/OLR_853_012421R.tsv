0	16000	I first used the Opera Rep Browser around 2005 and cheers to that company for continuing to bring capable browsing to the less common platforms.
16000	22000	While I haven't used Opera GX, the company is taking a deeper step into gaming by acquiring game maker studio maker YoYo Games.
22000	28000	Tons of games are built for the web these days and hopefully Opera is looking to make it even better and easier for users to make and play those games as it should be.
28000	34000	This is the story that caught my eye. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to explain more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34000	36000	Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
39000	46000	Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46000	57000	Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight January the 24th of 2021 with the 853rd episode of our show.
57000	69000	My name is Rob Roberts joining you from our studio where we used to tape in person but for the past year and obvious reasons we've been taping through the magic of Discord online.
69000	74000	Say hello in her house in her studio. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
74000	85000	Sup. Hi, how are you doing? I'm alright, how are you? I'm, I'm okay. Like, I don't know, I've been sleeping a lot, and like to the point where I think it's kind of unhealthy actually.
85000	94000	So I have to kind of like turn that around, but I think between the weather, the shorter days, the, I don't know just everything I don't know.
94000	105000	I don't know if it's also some sense of like this great relief has been lifted from our shoulders ever since about Wednesday ish.
105000	118000	Like feeling like that that always sense of is today the day that we're, you know, the nukes are gonna get used that that whole sense is just kind of like been lifted so maybe I'm just like catching up on lost sleep, I don't know what it is.
118000	122000	But yeah, I'm here.
122000	128000	There's, there's my long answer to how I'm doing. I'm here.
128000	144000	And you guys are here. Hi everyone over in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, and sometimes we do cute little things that only
144000	157000	the live folks see, such as the usage of that Bernie meme that is everywhere. Yeah, I guess I had to work that into the intro of the show tonight you know it's funny the thought hadn't even crossed my mind until Bobby like tweeted like so what Bernie thing
157000	163000	are we going to see in the intro this week and I was like, oh yeah I guess I kind of have to use that don't I.
163000	169000	Luckily, there were so many photoshops out there. I didn't need to do one of my own.
170000	174000	There was plenty to steal from. So, there is that.
174000	179000	Anyway, say hello as well to tech master Loki. Hey Loki.
179000	181000	Hello. How are you doing.
181000	190000	I'm doing fine. I you ought to be better than fine I saw your Twitter earlier and you got some coverage for pixel poops this week I saw what's what's going on.
190000	206000	I got one, one YouTube video yeah so that's the game beaters. Yeah, there's more people that watch that then listen to this probably so there's that well, I don't know about that but yeah, there was, you know, there's, there's more people with the best part
206000	224000	is at least they're genuinely excited about it, that they, you know, had fun playing it and there's people like oh yeah, you know, that one's pretty interesting so Lisa wasn't like that looks like complete dog shit you know it's just, it was, you know, I don't know.
224000	234000	Yeah, it's nice to have like that validation for the thing you're working on I get it, I get it. Yeah, it's like the first time we got a nice review and iTunes it was kind of like, people do listen to the show.
234000	237000	Oh my gosh, wow.
237000	252000	Yeah, so yeah so the hype train is starting for your game just like it is in our chat right now thanks you guys I don't usually read out the the biddies and the subs until closer to the end of the show but since we are taping a podcast here, but I'm sure even
252000	261000	some of you podcasters know that you can do donations and stuff on Twitch and you guys got a hype train going so thanks you guys appreciate that.
261000	277000	It's a good week after all things are things are looking up and things are looking up and down in the news and up and down and up and down and everywhere so let's get into the gaming news tonight, and a pretty stunning reversal Loki I'm gonna throw it
277000	281000	What the hell happened. And how fast did it happen.
281000	294000	Microsoft decided that they're going to pull a no disk drive 2.0 type thing. And just out of the blue announced hey by the way you know that you know that Xbox Live gold that you love.
294000	297000	Well we're going to double its price.
297000	312000	Whoops. And so they had made the announcement originally that it was going to subscriptions we're going to go up by, you know, as little as $1 to $11 per month.
312000	322000	And there was basically the $60 Xbox Live gold was going to be for now, six months instead of for 12 months.
322000	327000	And that, you know, basically everything was going up.
327000	333000	And folks were not happy about that at all.
333000	343000	So imagine why their, their reasoning was you know in many markets the price of Xbox Live gold has not changed for years and in some markets it has changed for over 10 years.
343000	351000	So, I don't know how that's necessarily justifying the price increase, but whatever.
352000	372000	A lot of people thought it was just to make games pass look better as a better deal, especially if it's going to be similarly priced to it, but they quickly walk that back so not only did they walk it back, but they also decided to now include the free to play games
372000	380000	which also strangely enough required an Xbox Live gold account. So if you want to play Fortnite or Roblox or something like that.
380000	389000	Got to have an Xbox Live gold account to play those online despite the fact that on PC or mobile or whatever, you can do that for free.
389000	400000	So they now are not including that with gold, you can just do that without gold and kind of putting it in line with other platforms and then of course the price
400000	409000	although that change will be gradual it's important to note that that is not a switch they're able to flip overnight, but they are committing to ending that practice in the near very near future.
409000	426000	Yeah, and then they're also going to be, you know, keeping the price, the same as it is right now. So, I don't know, I know that there's gonna be a change coming at some point but we'll see what they end up doing with that.
426000	434000	I think, and I'm curious what you guys kind of thought like where where the hell did this come from like I understand that you know businesses are out there to make money.
434000	446000	And there probably came a point where Microsoft was like you know we need to, we need to pull in more money or whatever but I just, I think this was just such a dumb way to do it, and I know a lot of people are saying yo Microsoft read the room,
446000	460000	there's a pandemic going on right now and people are having a penny pinch as as it is like maybe doubling the price just because the game industry had their best year ever doesn't mean that like suddenly we have the bandwidth to double the price for Xbox Live,
460000	471000	which especially doesn't look good when you've got a new console that's sitting on the shelf next to the PlayStation five, which, you know, doesn't make you pay to play Fortnite or any of that stuff online.
471000	486000	And for me, okay so speaking for me, like, where this just like just made me like, whoa, what the, where the hell did this come from and what the hell are you doing, you know, I definitely had that moment of, you know, wanting to scream at somebody because,
486000	505000	and I think the reason why, because there's other companies that do this on the regular and kind of get away with it, like Netflix, but Netflix does $1 here $1 there every year every other year, you know, kind of slowly start to raise it up a little bit.
505000	509000	And, you know, Netflix kind of takes its own shit for that whole thing too.
509000	529000	But, not, not, not nearly at the volume that we saw on social media for what Microsoft did. Anyway, part of why I just feel like whoa, what the hell are you thinking, Microsoft, is because I have fully anticipated for a long time that Microsoft would actually go the other way and just get rid of gold.
529000	538000	It doesn't really make sense in this day and age. It doesn't. Like paying to play the games online in the first place doesn't make a lot of sense. And y'all.
538000	542000	Well, it does because people have come to expect to pay for it.
543000	561000	In that regard, yes, but at the same time, A, it would give them such leverage against Sony to get rid of it. And B, when it comes to, and I understand, and people are going to come at me talking about the technical reasons and the servers and that it is a different pay structure and so forth.
561000	575000	The thing is, the truth doesn't matter next to somebody's perception. And this is a very hard pill for people to swallow. I understand. But that is the way the consumer base works. Your perception is everything.
575000	584000	Like their, their same platform. You have these Xbox games that are on PC on the Microsoft store. Don't have to have live gold for those to play online.
584000	597000	That is the point I was trying to get to. You are sitting side by side on Windows where you don't have to pay to play games online. And the concept of paying online on your PC is like, why would I ever do that? Or Mac or whatever platform you're on.
597000	611000	The concept of having to pay to play online on those, it's not even a thought. And if Microsoft were to try to introduce it, people would hack their way around it like that. It's not anything they can do.
611000	633000	So that's why I'm kind of stunned because I feel like Microsoft should have been going the other way. So to see them doubling down, like, and I think what really frustrated me about that is I've been sitting here on this show, as with many of you and on many of your shows and streams and podcasts and blogs and tweets and so forth.
633000	647000	Many of you have been sitting there going, Microsoft is a different company now. Microsoft is not the company it was under Don Mattrick. Microsoft has been going such a stronger direction under Phil Spencer. And I still believe all of that to be true.
647000	662000	But then this happens. And it's like, there she is, the old Mimi, you know, you're that girl I thought you were. That's and that's, that's the feeling we had when it came to Microsoft suddenly like doubling the price.
662000	674000	It was like, oh my god, you have been on such a great, like, four steps forward 10 million back to double the price it was it was ridiculous now.
674000	690000	Okay, unclench y'all exhale because Microsoft quickly reversed course and that is the important punchline to this whole thing, you know, and Phil Spencer actually replied to one of the guys from gamertag radio which I thought was interesting.
690000	701000	And that kind of apologizing for the whole situation happening in the first place. And it's it's one of those weird things was like well didn't didn't you have to sign off on this dude like, how did this happen.
701000	713000	Did something get like completely out of control and not get the authorizations it was supposed to have like I, I don't know. So at the end of the day, Microsoft does end up going forward.
713000	725000	But they showed their ass and the process, and that's kind of the problem for some people right now. And I think we'll all get past it at least I know I will like I'm already like okay well, the end result.
725000	739000	We got something that we really should have had a long time ago and that is that fortnight all this stuff should be free on Microsoft, especially when you've got a new console you've got on the shelf next to PlayStation five, where Sony can say, not on our
740000	760000	I'm not sure I understand the concept of push people to game pass by doubling the price of Xbox Live to get it closer to the price of game pass game passes a great deal, and can be spoken of on its own strengths, but it also has me worried.
760000	763000	How long is game pass going to stay that price.
763000	772000	And I think that is the whole part of the ass showing that Microsoft did this week that has me a little bit concerned.
772000	785000	You are about to raise the price of Xbox Live. All right. Okay. How long until game passes price is going to double.
785000	792000	I hope that's not the direction they're thinking of going and I understand that.
792000	796000	I mean, I can see them raising it but I don't know.
796000	798000	We'll see.
799000	810000	Going to the chat for some of our comments there so SHO 100 Matt says, now the cat's out of the bag, they're going to raise the price of the next appropriate time. They can't totally walk this back.
810000	823000	Act Def says the other thing is that we shouldn't thank Microsoft for reversing this. They shouldn't have even come out with this in the first place. Yeah, it is one of those things I don't know if thanking Microsoft is the right word, but it's one of those like,
823000	830000	I came to your senses now go to your room. That's that's kind of where I feel I'm at with Microsoft this week.
830000	845000	Zen monkey says, I'm shocked Microsoft didn't use the old, my little brother logged on to my account excuse. I've heard that so many times on Xbox Live whenever someone messed up in a game.
846000	853000	When that must have game is a game pass exclusive and they'll sneak in that. Oh, by the ways, we're raising the price.
853000	868000	She Hulk says the price will go up when all the companies they bought release great games. Well, you know, with Halo, you know, a big one that's scheduled to come at the end of the year again, I could see that the price of game pass is going to go up a little bit.
868000	881000	And I think that's the reality we should prepare ourselves for, you know, if if this shows us anything we should probably like mentally prepare ourselves game pass is not going to be the price that it's at forever shit PC already doubled, didn't it?
881000	893000	But let's be real $5 a month on PC. That was kind of a steal like he was it was it was really underpriced on PC. So I think it's going to be a matter of time before it creeps up.
893000	900000	But I again, I don't understand the whole raise the price of gold to move more people on the game pass argument.
900000	910000	Yeah, I think maybe the only way I could see that they could possibly have like their thought process could have been maybe that we're seeing really high server usage.
910000	919000	And so our server costs are going up and therefore we have to offset it by raising the price. But I think that's more of like a temporary thing. I don't think that's going to stay that way forever.
920000	930000	And I don't even know if that's necessarily a true fact either. Yeah, we have a lot more people playing games, but like, I don't know, I don't think that it's night and day.
930000	941000	Maybe that's how they'll justify it. Or they could be just like the cable company and just raise your, you know, rates by $8 a month for no reason whatsoever and just like whatever.
941000	945000	Yeah, so it's, it's hard to say.
945000	959000	Yeah, it is. So I it's kind of one of those we've all got our eye on you now Microsoft, but I am glad they at least have leveled the playing field when it comes to the free games because again that was something that never really made sense.
960000	975000	And when you're trying to sit here going, no everyone, Microsoft is a great platform now like it's not what you guys think it is or what you remember from when Xbox was first out it's not all shooty bang bang games and all this stuff it's like Microsoft's actually a great platform.
975000	985000	You know, again, this happens and that's kind of crappy but at least now. People can't swing the whole yeah but you got to pay to play Fortnite on it which doesn't make any sense.
985000	993000	You don't have to pay it play it anywhere else, at least that is now out of the equation or at least will be in the next, you know, couple months but we know that's on the on the radar.
993000	1005000	Well, it's, that's also interesting too because like if you're trying to bring people to your platform like if I'm buying you know if I'm looking to buy a console for my kids or something it's like I know that they play Fortnite.
1005000	1031000	Okay, but they don't really play Fortnite but they play Roblox a lot, which is a free to play game you know it's like, well I could pay, I'm gonna have to pay you know $15 a person, you know, $10 a person a month or whatever for Xbox Live Gold, or I can just get a PC or they can play on their tablets, like, I don't know it's just Microsoft does a good job at selling PCs.
1031000	1049000	Yeah, it's like, it's like, do you, are you trying to dissuade people from buying your consoles because like you're releasing your games on PC. It's cheaper to play it online on PC. Like, I don't understand the you know why they do that.
1049000	1056000	It's like, you know, I, I'm getting a better experience on PC Why, why would I buy your console then.
1057000	1064000	Tiger call on chat says Do you think the reason why they try to raise the cost was because the prices to keep those servers went up.
1064000	1078000	Maybe, you know, we don't really have insight as to the real reason why Microsoft was wanting to up the price outside of to make more money, because they didn't really try to justify it and I mean they didn't say that in their announcement post you know the price of maintaining servers
1078000	1090000	has gone up, but I think we all know in the back of my mind. If the price of maintaining servers has gone up which sure it probably has gone up a little bit from year to year, especially in the past you know 10 years or whenever the last time they raised the price was.
1090000	1092000	It didn't, it didn't double.
1092000	1101000	So I think that's like I think honestly if Microsoft had come out and said, we're increasing the price by $1 a month. I don't think you would have seen nearly this type of thing.
1101000	1116000	And it's also harder to make that argument to when they just spent billions of dollars like acquiring a bunch of different game companies so it's like, yeah, I get it there, you know, the server costs and you know acquisition money is a little bit, it's different.
1116000	1128000	It's even think that you're hurting for money when it's like, dude, you've got a bunch of money to buy all these game companies made by one less game developer and then you could offset the cost of your service for a little bit but like, I don't know,
1128000	1143000	I don't know, that particular argument is a little apples and oranges to me but I also you know I have to go back to what I said before is that it really doesn't matter what the facts are it matters what the perception is, and I completely understand how the optics of that doesn't look great.
1143000	1145000	So I get it.
1145000	1156000	But I do think it's a little bit, you have money in this bucket and you have money in that bucket and it's a little, the money is kind of used for different things but I, but I get it, the optics aren't good, you're right.
1156000	1171000	Let's see, Bobby in chat with a few things, they care about the Xbox ecosystem not necessarily the Xbox consoles. And the answer to your question is if you're willing to spend the money for a PC that gets a better experience than an Xbox, then they still want to cater to you because you're still in the Xbox ecosystem.
1171000	1179000	Microsoft has basically left the console war, they're now in a platform war, and that doesn't necessarily mean Xbox consoles.
1179000	1190000	I think that is also, you know, something to keep in mind is that Microsoft is way more concerned with how many Game Pass subscriptions they're selling right now than how many Xbox consoles they're selling.
1190000	1199000	Not that I think they're hurting in that space because we still see the Xbox consoles are being scalped, and they're selling out the minute they go up on different websites.
1199000	1209000	I don't think Microsoft's really having a problem in that regard but I think also supply is severely limited so it's, it's still hard to kind of gauge where that's really at.
1209000	1222000	And also, like you know again speaking for myself, I have a PC and I have an Xbox, and I will tell you because the Xbox is a dedicated games platform, the games look and run better on my Xbox.
1222000	1238000	I can't do as much with them, you know, I can't multitask, the same way. I can't play a game on monitor A and have the news up on monitor B or some of that stuff but even Microsoft does allow you to do some, I think there is some type of like
1238000	1247000	screen and screen type of stuff and all this stuff I just don't really play with that feature. But as, as far as like running the games it does it very very well, you know, so.
1247000	1258000	Not, not with Minecraft bedrock unfortunately, you click out of that screen it disconnects you from the server. Oh, that's weird. It's like, why is weird little silly.
1258000	1271000	Jamie I'm going to call on you just, you've been quiet but I know you your horse is not as invested in Microsoft's race but you know kind of listening to this whole thing and knowing that Microsoft, you know, does have to make money at the end of the day.
1271000	1280000	What do you kind of think it was this, do you think they they handled this in a weird way or where's your head out with this.
1280000	1284000	You're muted just you know on discord on the discord end.
1284000	1288000	And no worries. Anyway, let's try again. What's your thought.
1288000	1299000	Honestly enough, I, I think yeah that they were right to admit that they made a big boo boo. I mean they flat out said, we messed up.
1299000	1301000	I mean that's verbatim.
1301000	1314000	So, I shouldn't, I mean they shouldn't have raised it in the first place but at the very least they've gone in back to back down and they're, they're following suit with the industry now.
1314000	1326000	And I think that if they hadn't done that, then it would have been a bigger blow to their business, then making an extra $60 per person would have would have helped them.
1326000	1337000	I mean, yeah. And that is a good point you know even though I still kind of side with what active said where it's like we don't necessarily have to full out like forgive them for the whole thing.
1337000	1346000	I think you do make a very good point that certainly not every game company or every company in general would come out and say, oops, we messed up, and within a day.
1346000	1369000	That is, that is pretty fast. I mean most companies that do end up saying, oops, we put our foot in our mouth teehee, it takes them a week to do it, you know, think about the blizzard and that whole situation when they ban that guy from the tournament, who said free Hong Kong, you know, they still haven't really fully PR recovered from that.
1369000	1384000	And a big part of that is that they waited so fucking long to do the bare minimum in that whole situation, you know, and so I kind of, I will give credit and I think you're right to call that out that Microsoft at least you know what they did it within a day.
1384000	1393000	That that was an angry phone call happening from Phil Spencer or somebody at that level, saying WTF knock it off.
1393000	1411000	Yeah, I think that it might have been like maybe just some, you know, I'd say just you know financial person who only saw like general operating costs and thought, oh, well, we can do this if we raise live by this, you know, all we're doing all this with it.
1411000	1415000	And then you have to look at the big picture it has you.
1415000	1421000	Yeah, their bottom line, making money, right, right, but they need to understand what it is.
1421000	1425000	Or I'd say who it is that gives them their money.
1425000	1439000	And if you don't make the users of your product, happy in a way that's going to also be cost effective and profitable. You are going to lose it all.
1439000	1441000	Yep.
1441000	1450000	You know, if, if they had put it to 120 and kept half of their user base guess what they'd be making the same amount of money.
1450000	1463000	It's, it's, it's, uh, it's very interesting this whole thing and it does, I think now the only, you know, I think the thing that Phil Spencer is going to really be irritated about is that he's going to be asked about this for the next three months.
1463000	1472000	Why did that happen? How did this happen? Why did you decide it was like Phil? And that is not the discussion Microsoft wanted to have for the next three months.
1472000	1479000	They want to talk about what games are coming out and all these things. And now I guarantee you every interview Phil Spencer does for the next three months.
1479000	1484000	People are going to ask what happened with that price doubling thing? Like, why did you guys do that? How did that happen?
1484000	1499000	Like, so, so to, you know, an active credit here who says, you know, I'm glad that Microsoft reverse it, but it shouldn't happen in the first place. That is the price to ultimately be paid here is that the narrative now around Microsoft is, what are they doing over there at Microsoft?
1499000	1508000	What are they plotting? What are they planning? And it's not going to be about the new Halo and the conversation that Microsoft wants to be having.
1508000	1509000	Pretty much.
1509000	1517000	Pretty much. All right. Anyway, I guess the last thing I could say about this whole thing of Microsoft is we were rooting for you. All right.
1517000	1521000	Let's move on. That's my third Drag Race reference. I've snuck in, by the way, this whole episode.
1521000	1528000	Let's move on and talk about how is your gaming week and the types of games that we've been playing this week.
1528000	1534000	Dark Soccer, we'll start with you. How is your gaming week? Have you been playing Microsoft games or other stuff?
1534000	1535000	Animal Crossing.
1535000	1537000	Oh, of course.
1537000	1544000	And getting a few things ready, so, you know, I've got I'll just go ahead and say I have a procedure coming up this week,
1544000	1552000	so I'm actually going to be playing trying to go back in and play just some things that have been on my backlog while I'm recovering.
1552000	1557000	And I did buy a game for Dan for five dollars.
1557000	1560000	I got five dollars.
1560000	1564000	Sorry, Siri's talking to me. I got an Outrun Europa for Game Gear.
1564000	1569000	Oh, nice. Just because we watched the thing about Outrun and I was like, I'll get it.
1569000	1579000	So why not? So and then I got like the Nintendo DS like Sega Classics pack that has like Puyo Puyo and Fantasy Zone and all of that on it.
1579000	1583000	So I might actually break out my my 3DS.
1583000	1589000	But really, the big reason I have that is so that I can play their version of Space Harrier,
1589000	1599000	because their version of Space Harrier has the tilt control like like the simulates, like you're in like the tilting cockpit.
1599000	1605000	Meat. Yeah, I thought that was pretty cool. And it was it was fairly cheap.
1605000	1610000	I did actually get something that's not a game, Rob, but I think you might want to take it from me.
1610000	1617000	OK. I got the Golden Girls tarot deck. A tarot deck? What? I did.
1617000	1624000	Now, I know the Golden Girls have been licensed to all sorts of strange things, but a tarot deck?
1624000	1629000	I guess a monopoly and clue. OK, interesting. I have a Golden Girls tarot deck.
1629000	1634000	And if you want to steal it from me, I would have no problem with you gaining custody of it.
1634000	1640000	But I have to try the deck out because it just seems absolutely hilarious.
1640000	1647000	The moment I saw it was like 14 bucks, so it wasn't that expensive. But but I thought it was it was pretty funny.
1647000	1654000	Zen Monkey is wondering, is Rose the fool card? I haven't even opened it. No, it'd have to be Stanley.
1654000	1658000	All right. All right. Loki, you're having some discord problems.
1658000	1663000	If you guys are hearing discord noises on the podcast, it's Loki connecting, reconnecting.
1663000	1667000	Are you with us? I'm still here. Yeah. Oh, you're just not.
1667000	1671000	Yeah. Video things being ridiculous here.
1671000	1675000	So anyways, so this week I did play a few more things.
1675000	1684000	We picked up Super Smash Brothers Ultimate because my son is having like a his seventh birthday party sort.
1684000	1688000	Not party, but I had like a couple friends over.
1688000	1695000	And so we played a bit of that because we had to unlock all the characters that purchased both the fighter passes and stuff.
1695000	1702000	So that's fun. Mainly everybody's maining Steve. And that's been a lot of fun playing as that.
1702000	1710000	What else? I actually ironically, even though it's being discontinued, I played a bit of Minecraft Earth.
1710000	1716000	So that was kind of interesting being that I haven't played it in a long time.
1716000	1723000	So it's interesting to see all the new things that they add to it. But the game's being discontinued, which is too bad.
1723000	1728000	And then, well, really, with all the stuff that they have in the game that they don't have in the vanilla Minecraft,
1728000	1737000	I really wish they'd add all the mobs and stuff in there because there's a lot of things that are exclusive to Minecraft Earth that aren't in the main vanilla game.
1737000	1742000	Orna. And then aside from that, a little bit of Minecraft.
1742000	1751000	And most of this week was just watching Twitch streams for Epic SMP while I was coding and doing artwork for my game.
1751000	1755000	So that's pretty much where most of my focus has been.
1755000	1764000	Nice. And going to chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, talking about the Super Smash Brothers event that your son had.
1764000	1770000	Bobby says, I figured it was just Minecraft fighting, which is funny because I seem to remember Bobby being one of the people
1770000	1777000	that was kind of saying this when Steve was announced for Minecraft was that it's not Steve or Steve being in Minecraft.
1777000	1781000	Sorry, guys. Steve being in Smash Brothers. Hello.
1781000	1786000	That when that announcement came out, a lot of the Smash Brothers fandom was kind of like, ew, why?
1786000	1793000	And there were folks like Bobby and other folks, too, that were saying, Steve being in Smash Brothers isn't really for you.
1793000	1799000	It's for a different audience that's going to appreciate it and bring more people into playing Smash Brothers.
1799000	1806000	And hence, here's, you know, case in point and the evidence brought forth before the court what you're talking about with the kids,
1806000	1811000	how all the seven year olds, they're all playing Minecraft Steve and playing Steve Fighter.
1811000	1817000	Right. Yeah, exactly. And so he's a fun character to play as. I don't know.
1817000	1823000	Yeah, I don't really take it too seriously. So whatever. But it's pretty fun.
1823000	1834000	So I like him. The other character I've been playing a lot because I still like I have trouble controlling my characters because I don't play Smash at all.
1834000	1838000	I don't even really know what the the controls are to smash.
1838000	1846000	I just kind of, you know, just playing it based on what I remember from years ago with Smash Brothers Wii and stuff like that.
1846000	1849000	It like I was playing a lot of Terry Bogard, which is kind of fun.
1849000	1855000	And since we have all like the DLC characters unlocked now, we're still at like 60 some characters unlocked.
1855000	1860000	I mean, it's going to be a while before we get everybody, which is kind of it's good and bad at the same time.
1860000	1871000	Like it's good because it gives you some reason to play the game, but it's bad. It's like, well, I wanted to play as Mega Man or play as I don't know what the other characters.
1871000	1877000	They can't do that because have to play through hundreds of games, unlock everybody.
1877000	1882000	I don't know. Yeah. I'm surprised they don't just have something in the store that just unlocks a code or something.
1882000	1892000	Yeah. You know, at this point, but or if you've bought any of the DLC, you know, if they they want to charge for it or whatever, at least kind of just make it like, oh, if you bought any of the DLC and it just unlocks all the characters.
1892000	1899000	I get that. So. Yeah. All right. All right. Nice advertisement there. All right. OK. Oh, you're back.
1899000	1904000	That's what it looks like when it loads the screen. OK. And I get it. I guess not advertising for that.
1904000	1911000	For the podcast, folks, I'm teasing Loki's camera was slowly coming back on, but it shows the website for the company of the software he's using.
1911000	1918000	And then like it takes a second and then Loki suddenly appears. So, hey, you guys know how Loki's getting his face here to discord.
1918000	1925000	Yes, it's it's X split X split V cam. Hey, did they did they pay you for that? Did they pay you for that? No.
1925000	1931000	They did not pay me for that, but I have no green screen. So it works like a green screen without green screen.
1931000	1937000	All right. Well, even Skype does that now. Come on. All right. Anyway.
1937000	1943000	Well, I had to pay for this one, so, you know, whatever. All right. Moving on to my gaming week.
1943000	1950000	So I've still been playing a lot of Final Fantasy 14. There was a big crafting event that was going on in the game.
1950000	1955000	What's called the Ishgard rankings, where the top 100 people in every craft.
1955000	1961000	It's like a competition where you're crafting certain items. And I could not make the hardest item.
1961000	1969000	I had to make the second to hardest item. And I made a lot of them. I made 400 of those throughout the week.
1969000	1973000	But you know what, y'all? I ended up in the ranks. I'm number 50. I think it was 57 or 58.
1973000	1979000	I ended up number 58 on my server for carpentry. So I got my stupid title. I got in the rankings.
1979000	1987000	I'm good. I'm happy. That was my big Final Fantasy 14 accomplishment outside of, you know, continuing more roulettes and things of that nature.
1987000	1991000	Here's the big news. And this happened right after last week's show, actually.
1991000	1996000	Last week's show finished a little early, if I remember right. I think it was done about an hour earlier than usual.
1996000	2002000	Just because, you know, January, we tend to have less news. And I went right into Pokémon.
2002000	2008000	And I was talking to Shane a little bit and I was like, hey, I need to touch trade a few things because I'm really close to finishing my decks.
2008000	2012000	But there's a couple things like Flapple and stuff. They're just going to be way too hard for me to get in Shield.
2012000	2016000	It's like, can I touch trade you a couple things and I'll be done? And he said, of course.
2016000	2021000	So we got on. We touch traded a few things. I went through and I evolved a few more things I needed to.
2021000	2031000	And I caught them all. I sure did. Guess what? I caught them all. My decks in Pokémon Shield, done.
2031000	2039000	Four hundred out of four hundred. I got my certificate. I got my shiny charm. I was the very best that no one ever was.
2039000	2046000	Even if I had to temporary temporarily steal someone else's Pokémon to get it done. It doesn't matter. I still did it.
2046000	2056000	So Jamie, Jamie's giving me three claps. Phoenix in chat says that's a big decks.
2056000	2063000	Yeah, the base decks in shield decks in your pants there. The base decks in shield is four hundred.
2063000	2068000	And so I finished that. Well, and then active says, so what are you shiny hunting first?
2068000	2075000	OK, so here's the gag. Number one, I didn't realize the shiny charm guy.
2075000	2082000	If you talk to him earlier, like after you beat the game, he gives you a charm that makes catching easier.
2082000	2088000	So that would have made this whole process a lot easier. I mean, quick balls are pretty efficient.
2088000	2094000	But still, that made me very mad when I was like, oh, now a critical catch chance charm? Really?
2094000	2101000	Now a warning? Anyway, so there was that. And then I got the shiny charm.
2101000	2108000	But since I was on Discord with Shane, you know, his first thing was, OK, you're going to get the DLC.
2108000	2117000	We're going to go to Dynamax. So that was that was the first thing I did was I went on a Dynamax raid with Shane in the time.
2117000	2124000	He was like, yeah, just go to the Tundra DLC. It's better. So I went to that and we got he led me through it.
2124000	2131000	And I got a Tapu something, some fairy legendary from one of the recent games at the end of our Dynamax thing.
2131000	2140000	So he did say he was running a test because he said everybody is supposed to get Suicune, Suicune on their first run.
2140000	2145000	But if you go with somebody else, he was curious if I'd still be locked into Suicune or get somebody else.
2145000	2151000	And it turns out I got somebody else. I got Tapu. I'm sorry, I forget. It's a it's two names.
2151000	2160000	I forgot the second name. Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, so are you glad there's no national decks so you don't actually have to catch them all?
2160000	2168000	Funny you mention that because, yes, there is a national decks on the Switch. It's Pokemon Home.
2168000	2174000	Pokemon Home is a national decks on Switch. So where I'm kind of of the understanding,
2174000	2184000	I'm not really going to catch them all and fill out my entire decks on Switch because that's going to need games that I just don't really have access to anymore or what have you.
2184000	2194000	I still have been combining what was in my old Pokemon Bank, Pokemon Go and Pokemon Shield and dumping all that into home.
2194000	2198000	And I'm up to five hundred and fifty decks in Pokemon Home.
2198000	2205000	And I think once I do the DLC, which will be my next thing for Shield, that'll certainly be a few more Mon with that.
2205000	2213000	And then who knows, I may be motivated to go back and play like Moon or Sun or one of the other games and really try to work on my decks that way.
2213000	2220000	And I might get a lot closer than some of y'all think. Quarantine makes people do crazy things. That is it.
2220000	2228000	Oh, ActDeaf gave me all the names. It was Tapu Fini, I think is it. I think it was Tapu Fini sounds right.
2228000	2236000	Let's see. Sg100Matt in chat says, Shane is Rob's gaming accountant. His hero's power just convinces him to buy whatever he says.
2236000	2243000	Yes and no. I mean, think about this, though, guys. How long have Shane and I been friends? We've been friends a very long time.
2243000	2250000	Think back to when Shane's first appearance on this show was. I'll give you a hint. It was before many of you were listening.
2250000	2258000	It was back when Loki and I were living together in Live 365 days. He was like 18 or 19 then. He was young.
2258000	2264000	But we were like 24 or 25. So it was that was in the first or second year of OLR.
2264000	2272000	He probably was probably the first time he guessed it on the show. And the reason why I say that is that was over 15 years ago.
2272000	2284000	I just now have finished the decks in a Pokémon game thanks to a global pandemic that has forced my attention to stay focused on one or two games for a long period of time.
2284000	2290000	So if there were powers or whatever, I think it would have happened 15 years ago.
2290000	2297000	I would have probably finished the decks in black or white. His favorite game that that never happened.
2297000	2304000	So there is that. All right. In fact, actually, Dark Sakura, he name checked us.
2304000	2308000	I don't mean to make this the Shane show. Well, he's not here to hear in chat right now for his ego to get bigger.
2308000	2312000	But you and I were name checked in a tweet and I had forgot about this.
2312000	2318000	We went down to Disneyland and I think it was for a birthday trip of yours, I want to say.
2318000	2325000	And on our way down there, do you remember we had to go to a Walmart that was in like Azusa or some shit?
2325000	2328000	I don't remember. I think it was because Arcade Infinity was over in that direction.
2328000	2333000	And we went to a Walmart over there and that was so he could buy a Pokémon game.
2333000	2337000	I forgot about that until he name checked us in a tweet earlier this week.
2337000	2343000	Where he was like, I went to a Walmart with Jamie and Rob and picked up whatever game it was that released that week.
2343000	2347000	So I thought that was kind of I was like, oh, I forgot that was a Pokémon thing.
2347000	2355000	I remember having to make the detour to the Walmart and that that that was Shane's accountant hero's power thing was,
2355000	2362000	yes, if we're going to go to Arcade Infinity, why don't you go just a little bit longer and go to the Walmart so I can get something?
2363000	2367000	Arcade Infinity was that I miss Arcade Infinity.
2367000	2372000	I do, too. That was a fun trip. Yeah, that was back when we could do that and Disneyland in one trip. It was fun.
2372000	2378000	So. All right. Anyway, also in my house, like you're halfway through Disney and you have to go take a nap.
2378000	2382000	Yeah, pretty much. Let's see. Then what else during my gaming week?
2382000	2389000	So there was that. And then I played oh, I played Donut. Is it Donut Country or Donut County?
2389000	2394000	Country or I can't remember. I don't remember. It's Donut County, I think.
2394000	2397000	OK, Donut County. They just added that to Game Pass.
2397000	2404000	And even though I played that on, I think, Steam previously, I played it on Xbox a little bit.
2404000	2409000	That's the game that's kind of like the reverse Katamari, where instead of rolling things up into a ball,
2409000	2415000	you you have the whole swallow them into the earth. And it's kind of like a silly story that goes with it.
2415000	2418000	Have you played this dark soccer? This is totally your kind of game.
2418000	2422000	I have it. I have it for Mac. Mm hmm.
2422000	2426000	And I played it for a hot minute and then got busy with other things.
2426000	2430000	So I really need to just go back and dedicate some more time to it. But yeah.
2430000	2434000	And that and I'll be perfectly honest, I probably should just get it on my iPad now,
2434000	2441000	because I haven't touched my MacBook since I got my iPad, except when I had to run two computers at the same time.
2441000	2445000	Yeah, whatever works like get it. Yeah, I keep forgetting it's also a phone.
2445000	2452000	Well, you know, phone tablets like, you know, that whole ecosystem it's on. It's there to actually Apple Arcade.
2452000	2459000	Probably I wouldn't be surprised, but especially if it's on Game Pass. But anyway, we're checking out.
2459000	2463000	So, yeah, I played a little bit of that as well and a few other things here and there.
2463000	2468000	Tetris Effect a little more and just, you know, chilling on Xbox with some of that.
2468000	2474000	I just downloaded. What did I just download? There's something else I'm getting to this week because I just downloaded it.
2474000	2478000	And now, of course, the name escapes me. Oh, well, stay tuned for next week because I haven't played it yet.
2478000	2483000	I just downloaded it. Waiting to play it for next week. All right. Let's move on with the show.
2483000	2488000	We have lots of news to get into tonight. Things are starting to pick back up now that it's January.
2488000	2493000	All right. Let's get to it. Loki, we'll start with you. How is your gaming week?
2493000	2496000	Jamie, your camera is still on, just so you know. I think you meant to turn it off.
2496000	2501000	All right. Well, whoops. She thought she turned it off. She didn't. She's taking an AFK.
2501000	2506000	Anyway, Loki, why don't you start us off with the news?
2506000	2512000	Yeah. So Cyberpunk finally got that major patch that they had announced in their apology video.
2512000	2519000	So it did come out on all platforms. It's about a 17 gig download and it fixed different issues,
2519000	2526000	including some optimizations, buggy quests, visual hiccups, general stability.
2526000	2532000	However, like most patches that come out nowadays, it also broke some stuff.
2532000	2537000	So some of those are actually game breaking bugs that cause different quests not to work.
2537000	2545000	There is like one quest, for example, where a certain NPC won't call you or there's another quest where you can't pull your gun out.
2545000	2551000	Lots of issues still being worked on. Hopefully this stuff is going to be addressed in another patch,
2551000	2557000	but right now they are laying the groundwork for upcoming patches.
2557000	2560000	The next big one is due in February.
2560000	2563000	What did you think of that whole roadmap that they put out?
2563000	2567000	I mean, you're the only one at the trio that's really played the game.
2567000	2572000	I haven't played this in a while. I haven't gotten around to playing it again,
2572000	2577000	but I'll go back and play it some more, but I don't know.
2577000	2582000	None of that stuff means anything to me because I don't know exactly what's being fixed and stuff.
2582000	2587000	So we'll see. I have to see what kind of performance issues are going to be cleared up.
2587000	2597000	There's just some stuff that's not even performance based, like the cop AI or I don't know.
2598000	2603000	Some of the weird visual glitches and stuff, if they could fix some of that would be nice.
2603000	2607000	But yeah, mainly the police AI would be something I would like to have fixed,
2607000	2609000	make some of the vehicle physics and stuff.
2609000	2613000	But other than that, it doesn't really dissuade me either way.
2613000	2616000	I just don't have time to play right now. I'm not making time to play it.
2616000	2622000	We'll see if I ever get to finish it because a lot of these games, if I don't play it for a long enough time,
2622000	2624000	I'll just go back and play something else.
2624000	2628000	Once again, like I said, mentioning that I watch a lot of Twitch this week,
2628000	2634000	I saw people playing Skyrim. I saw people playing Minecraft on specific servers.
2634000	2636000	I'm like, man, I should go back and play some Skyrim.
2636000	2640000	Oh, that is all my husband's been doing for four months, is playing Skyrim.
2640000	2644000	He plays some mod. The game doesn't even look the same.
2644000	2648000	It changes the base interface and font, and I'm like, what the fuck are you even playing?
2648000	2652000	He's like, it's Skyrim. I'm like, oh, it is, but it's not. No, it isn't.
2652000	2658000	I don't know. My husband loves mods, loves them. That is why he games on PC.
2658000	2662000	That is his bread and butter. So the games don't even look like it has with me.
2662000	2668000	Yeah. I mean, and to go into another tangent here about streaming and stuff,
2668000	2675000	like I said, I've been watching this. It's a stream, basically a group of streamers and YouTube stars and stuff like that.
2675000	2680000	They're playing a survivor multiplayer realm or not really a realm,
2680000	2683000	but like a server for Java Minecraft.
2683000	2688000	And it's got this mod in there called Create, which is pretty amazing.
2688000	2698000	You can make like, you know, water wheels and stuff that actually spins and like the working elevators and like all sorts of create like trains.
2698000	2705000	Not just like a, you know, a mine cart and riding around on a mine cart, but like an actual train and like all sorts of crazy stuff.
2705000	2710000	But it's just a lot of them playing together. And I'm like, man, like I would really love to play with a lot of people.
2710000	2715000	They're actually going to be online and playing all the time. That would be a lot of fun.
2715000	2718000	I really want to get into like something like that to stream or whatever.
2718000	2724000	And even just like watching, you know, folks stream Skyrim and not like necessarily with mods on or anything.
2724000	2730000	It's just like vanilla Skyrim, just like, OK, I'm just going to go through this game and, you know, interact with chat and stuff like that.
2730000	2734000	So I definitely want to get into that once I'm developing my game.
2734000	2737000	But yeah, so enough of that tangent, though.
2737000	2740000	But yes, I hope we'll get back to it at some point.
2740000	2742000	I'm looking at some comments from chat.
2742000	2751000	Quest Buster says the roadmap is more disappointing to me because instead of focusing on new things to do in the game with their DLC plans, the convo is all about fixes instead.
2751000	2759000	And so, yeah, I think that's what's kind of been a very frustrating thing for a lot of people, even if you didn't think cyberpunk was broken in the first place.
2759000	2761000	They've got to fix it for all the people it is broken for.
2761000	2774000	And it's kind of preventing the game from getting the DLC and, you know, other types of expansions that you will come to expect from, you know, this developer when they did this with The Witcher three and all that.
2774000	2784000	You know, all the DLC is still coming up before they even make the like PlayStation five and, you know, Xbox Series X versions that were supposed to be coming out well before the DLC.
2784000	2787000	So stuff's still gotten, you know, mixed.
2787000	2789000	The order is kind of mixed up right now on it.
2789000	2796000	But I think that stuff that you're going to see that sooner than some of these other enhancements.
2796000	2807000	Bobby Blackwell's talking about how it's kind of hard to jump back into a game after you haven't played it for a while, saying if I don't play something for a long time, my problem is that I forget how to play and I forget my progression path for my characters.
2807000	2810000	I know I left off a cyberpunk literally mid quest.
2810000	2811000	Yes, big same.
2811000	2819000	And Bobby says Yakuza like a dragon has that story so far on their load screen, but the game loads so fast on the Series X.
2819000	2820000	You can't read it.
2820000	2821000	Womp, womp.
2821000	2827000	Dragon Quest 11 does the same thing, but there's a big, big difference that makes it better.
2827000	2831000	You have to actually press the A button once loading is done.
2831000	2832000	It says press A to continue.
2832000	2834000	And so you have time to read it.
2834000	2836000	Ta-da!
2836000	2838000	But the tips still go by too fast.
2838000	2842000	So no tips for you, but at least you don't get lost in the story on Dragon Quest 11.
2842000	2845000	And then I say Pokemon.
2845000	2847000	I left Pokemon for a long time.
2847000	2848000	A shield.
2848000	2851000	You know, I bought the game when it first came out and I didn't finish my decks until now.
2851000	2855000	But the nice thing is the bottom of the screen always reminds you where you're at in the story.
2855000	2857000	Or actually I had already beaten it at that point.
2857000	2861000	But you still, the Pokedex will always show you, you know, here's some Mon you don't have yet.
2862000	2866000	And now that I'm in the DLC, it also will always on the pause screen say,
2866000	2870000	you should go here and talk to so-and-so or whatever it is you need to do.
2870000	2872000	So anyway.
2872000	2874000	I think I just finished the third gym.
2874000	2879000	And now I'm just wandering around in that big, I got sword.
2879000	2880000	Oh, yeah.
2880000	2881000	Same gym.
2881000	2882000	But yeah.
2882000	2883000	Yeah.
2883000	2887000	But I think it's like this one scene where they're like, oh, go out and play for a little bit.
2887000	2889000	And I'm like, okay.
2889000	2890000	Interesting.
2890000	2891000	I'll play.
2891000	2894000	It's like in that big open field area.
2894000	2895000	Oh, yeah.
2895000	2896000	The big walled city.
2896000	2897000	Yeah.
2897000	2902000	I'm trying to remember why they have you do that if they're trying to get you to catch a certain Mon or force something to happen.
2902000	2905000	I'd have to go back to remember in the story.
2905000	2909000	It's probably probably you have to trigger some type of event just like catching a certain Pokemon or something.
2909000	2912000	But there shouldn't be a lot blocking you from going to.
2912000	2913000	I know what I'm doing.
2913000	2915000	I know what I'm doing.
2915000	2919000	I'm leveling my my opposite types.
2919000	2920000	Okay.
2920000	2921000	Okay.
2921000	2922000	Yeah.
2922000	2923000	For the next gym.
2923000	2927000	The wild area is a great change, but it is.
2927000	2934000	It does play into that thing that's always stopped me from beating Pokemon games that I really had to kind of break in my mind is that the grind.
2934000	2936000	I'm always distracted by.
2936000	2938000	Oh, I got to catch them all while I'm here.
2938000	2940000	I got to get everything out in this area.
2940000	2948000	And you really have to leave that mindset behind, especially because you could stay in that wild area forever and catch everything.
2948000	2949000	Yeah.
2949000	2951000	It's you got to be careful.
2951000	2957000	And honestly, the grindy part, though, I mean, it's why I just I stopped caring.
2957000	2958000	Yeah, I understand.
2958000	2962000	So the thing is, is that I really thought this would be the game to get me back into Pokemon.
2962000	2964000	And no.
2964000	2969000	Well, you never know if you can get over that little hump, you might might make it the rest of the way.
2969000	2973000	It's it's really the collection thing of I kind of I'm just not into it.
2973000	2979000	I'd rather play, I mean, a conventional RPG, I think.
2979000	2991000	All right. Well, let's move on and let's talk about let's talk about stocks and investing, which is something honestly, if I understood this stuff, I would I would be a lot richer than I am.
2991000	2994000	And I'd probably be on a cruise.
2994000	2996000	Right. Well, not right now, but I would be traveling the world.
2996000	3003000	Not right now, but I would be holed up in my mansion if I understood investing in stocks and all this stuff.
3003000	3007000	I had to read this several times and I'm not sure it makes sense.
3007000	3008000	Here's what it is.
3008000	3016000	So Game Stops stonks had some issues this week and it was partially caused by Reddit.
3016000	3018000	It sounds like I'm going to just read this.
3018000	3023000	I don't like to read things verbatim, but the problem is I have a hard time explaining this.
3024000	3029000	So I'm going to read a paragraph here from this story on theverge.com and I am going to read it a little bit verbatim.
3029000	3032000	So I apologize to the Verge. You should go check out the story over there.
3032000	3034000	Here's the paragraph.
3034000	3042000	The hype generated by Reddit Wall Street bets helped create what's known as a short squeeze on Game Stops stock.
3042000	3045000	A short squeeze works like this.
3045000	3050000	Some investors known as shorts essentially bet that a company stock will fall.
3050000	3059000	These investors borrow stock from other investors and sell it with plans to buy it back when the prices fall and then return it to the original owner.
3059000	3062000	I had to read that like four times for it to make sense.
3062000	3065000	But essentially you're banking on the fact that it's going to fail.
3065000	3068000	So you're borrowing and you're going to say,
3068000	3071000	Hey, Jamie, Jamie, can I borrow some turnips from you real quick?
3071000	3073000	OK, I'm going to borrow these turnips.
3073000	3074000	OK, OK, I'll bring them back.
3074000	3077000	And then you sell them while the turnips are high.
3077000	3080000	And then later in the week, turnips are low again.
3080000	3087000	So you buy them at the low price and then I go back to Jamie and say, OK, thank you for letting me hold your turnips for a little bit.
3087000	3092000	And so I made a profit basically by borrowing something and selling it when it was low.
3092000	3097000	And I had to translate to Animal Crossing a little bit for it to make sense to me.
3097000	3103000	OK, now the problem actually deal with that a little bit with my 401K.
3103000	3108000	OK, yeah, you know what? And again, some of you are probably better vested in this stuff than I am.
3108000	3112000	No pun intended. Then I am. OK, so. All right.
3112000	3117000	The problem with the shorting is that losses are theoretically infinite.
3117000	3126000	If a stock begins an upward run, some short sellers will abandon their short and buy shares at the higher price to return.
3126000	3132000	This in turn makes the stock go higher, burning any other shorts who remain in the stock.
3132000	3136000	Some of whom may in turn choose to cover their own shorts.
3136000	3140000	So in other words, everybody gets nervous at the same time. It's not going down.
3140000	3146000	So, oh, shit, I better just buy the turnips again while I'm only going to lose a little money because a little higher.
3146000	3150000	And then in fact, you're just driving the turnip price up for everybody else.
3150000	3157000	So that's what happened. And honestly, I was sitting there going, how is that legal?
3157000	3162000	How does Reddit not fuck it up for everything if this is the case?
3162000	3166000	Like, wouldn't you just conspire to do certain things?
3166000	3171000	But it turns out a lot of that kind of like conspiracy, it actually is illegal, you guys.
3171000	3176000	That's that's what they call the the Martha Stewart types of crimes.
3176000	3181000	OK, why did Martha Stewart go to jail or have to wear a bracelet?
3181000	3184000	Insider trading is insider trading because she was a woman.
3185000	3190000	That, too. No, it wasn't it wasn't exactly the short situation.
3190000	3195000	Yes, but it was stock market related stuff is essentially the real big leap I'm making here.
3195000	3201000	All right. Anyway. And yes, because she was a woman, I'm a powerful one at that.
3201000	3205000	Let's see. And what is it that the white guys in charge fear?
3205000	3212000	In part women, women and minorities, other minorities, vaginas.
3212000	3217000	All right. Anyway, what else was I going to say? Oh, not saying that all women have vaginas.
3217000	3227000	I'm just saying, yes, I understand. GameStop is the most shorted stock in the market, according to CNBC.
3227000	3229000	One hundred thirty eight percent of the stocks are sold sold short.
3229000	3236000	In other words, what that's saying to you is that most investors predict the GameStop stock is going to continue to go down.
3236000	3241000	Yes, it probably will. Just based off of what we know about GameStop.
3241000	3249000	So the GameStop, for example, they've had very they have a new person that's from Chewy.
3249000	3252000	I think that helped launch Chewy dot com or something like that.
3252000	3256000	They're looking to take them fully digital and the guy that's in charge there.
3256000	3261000	He wants to basically remove all of their physical storefronts.
3261000	3270000	You know, the only thing that makes them actually unique right now, he wants to compete with Amazon and like Newegg and stuff like that with new game releases.
3270000	3275000	Good luck to you. Not going to work out for you.
3275000	3285000	I'm also giggling at chat DJ Rama as in chat says Martha Stewart went to jail because she's no snitch.
3285000	3290000	All right. Do you ever check Martha Stewart's Instagram?
3290000	3295000	Like, I really aspire to be her when I'm retired because she's like, she's like, what?
3295000	3300000	That woman's in her 70s and she's posting like, here's my makeup selfie.
3300000	3306000	She's posting like she's a makeup influencer on YouTube. And I kind of live for it.
3306000	3311000	Anyway, this isn't the Martha Stewart show, although maybe it ought to be moving on.
3311000	3315000	I want to talk about. So so I was questioning, how is this legal? Right.
3315000	3319000	So let's talk about the Reddit post and how this whole turnip game began.
3319000	3328000	OK, so a short seller research company called Citron Research predicted that the price would drop.
3328000	3334000	So Redditors on Wall Street bets who went and were kind of like driving up interest in the stock,
3334000	3342000	criticized Citron on the Reddit and continued to praise the stock on social media.
3342000	3350000	This pissed off the Citron research guy, saying it will no longer comment on the GameStop stock.
3350000	3356000	I always want to say stunk because of the angry mob who owns the stock.
3356000	3364000	The research editor named Andrew Left put a note on Twitter saying the backlash had criminal activity.
3364000	3369000	And I am going to report you to the Securities and Exchange Commission,
3369000	3374000	which included harassment of minor children and financial crimes.
3374000	3379000	So basically, I I want to speak to Tom Nook's manager.
3379000	3386000	I'm taking you to the Supreme Court. Is basically the note that he left on Twitter.
3386000	3389000	You can go read it for yourself over at Citron Research on Twitter.
3389000	3396000	But honestly, just stick to Animal Crossing turnips. It's safer.
3396000	3404000	Anyway, Quest Buster is apparently our Wall Street analyst here because I certainly don't understand this shit.
3404000	3408000	But Quest Buster's trying to translate some stuff here, saying shorts are legal.
3408000	3414000	Naked shorts where you sell shares without actually having them are not.
3414000	3419000	Hmm. Interesting. All right. Anyway, there's your stunk market lesson of the week.
3419000	3425000	Again, if you want to learn more, buy and sell turnips in Animal Crossing, because there's a reason why they do.
3425000	3430000	Because does it isn't turnip literally the same word as stock in Japanese?
3430000	3434000	And that's how it's similar or similar. It's a it's a very similar one.
3434000	3440000	I mean, which is why, like Joan was Sal Joan as in Dow Jones.
3440000	3445000	You know, they try to follow the same nicknaming thing. But yes, stocks.
3445000	3450000	And I have to look up the word again. Hold on.
3450000	3455000	That's it's not that big a thing, but I knew it was like a similar same word.
3456000	3461000	Kabushiki. Hold on. Let me double check it. Kabu. I think it is.
3461000	3466000	OK, where the word came from. OK, so anyway, just interesting.
3466000	3472000	So and I turnip is kabu. OK, OK.
3472000	3477000	It is interesting because a lot of us have predicted the GameStop stock is going to go down, down, down.
3477000	3483000	But as Loki said, you know, and we know that Reggie Fils-Aime was recently added to the advisory board and what have you.
3483000	3487000	And now they have the the chewy guy coming in and trying to fix things as well.
3487000	3491000	And, you know, GameStop is trying to put themselves on a different path.
3491000	3500000	And so GameStop may not be the short sell that people have, you know, kind of made it out to be over the past few years.
3500000	3504000	So anyway. All right. Let's move on to our next story, Dark Sakura.
3504000	3510000	You have a report on a big demo release this week, right?
3510000	3522000	Yeah, and it involves a woman of some stature, but they released the name for the the lady from Resident Evil 8.
3522000	3532000	The the I would say artistically vintage clad woman who.
3532000	3535000	Has a thing for wearing white and really a really bold lip.
3535000	3540000	I mean, red. It's, you know, groundbreaking anyway.
3540000	3545000	So her name is Lady Dem- I'm going to mispronounce this.
3545000	3549000	Dimitrescu, I guess supposed to be like Dimitri-escue.
3549000	3552000	Dimitrescu. And it was actually her name.
3552000	3559000	She's actually named in a PlayStation blog post and basically Capcom gets it.
3559000	3570000	But they showed that she reports to someone named Mother Miranda, who leads a cadre of vampires and is behind a lot of the shenanigans.
3570000	3583000	But she basically as a villain, she's kind of a little bit different because she seems to to have a different kind of menace to her.
3583000	3589000	But the thing is, is that someone stopped and figured out pretty much how tall she is.
3589000	3596000	As you know, it wasn't said anywhere, but leave it to, you know, curious people on the Internet who like doing math.
3596000	3610000	So basically one particular writer named Ash Parrish, this actually came from an article that she wrote on Kotaku.
3610000	3624000	Took the basically guess the age of the home because apparently the castle Dimitrescu was traced back as far as the 15th century, talking about their winemaking.
3624000	3633000	And so she went looking for a 15th century French courtyard doors and found some from the Metropolitan Museum of Art's website.
3633000	3644000	And so doing math skills, so that door was 86 inches and she and the lady stood about a head taller.
3644000	3649000	The average head is about eight to nine inches.
3649000	3660000	So she added another inch because of the general height, which puts her roughly to 96 inches tall or eight feet tall.
3661000	3663000	That's tall, that's very tall.
3663000	3667000	That's not and Zen Monkey in chat says, is this a video game or real people?
3667000	3671000	It is a video game, but people are treating it like real people.
3671000	3675000	Right. It's just absolutely I mean.
3675000	3678000	But monsters can be crazy.
3678000	3686000	And for those of our friends who are our metric, that's two hundred and forty three centimeters.
3686000	3690000	Thank you. Or two and a half meters.
3690000	3693000	I did not play the demo on Twitter, too.
3693000	3695000	So, you know, pardon me.
3695000	3698000	I said and people be thirsty on Twitter.
3698000	3704000	It's just all sorts of nonsense regarding these kill me, Ronnie.
3704000	3708000	Exactly. It's just like she's like, dude,
3708000	3716000	absolutely statuesque quite literally because she looks like marble.
3716000	3719000	She looks like she's made of stone. What is it with her tone?
3719000	3723000	What is it that people tweet to Katya and Trixie all the time? Like fuck me with a rake, mom or things like that.
3723000	3728000	Like people on Twitter be crazy.
3728000	3731000	Oh, all those silly Barbra's.
3731000	3733000	All right.
3733000	3737000	Bobby is saying the top comment on Kotaku on the article, which I find interesting.
3737000	3744000	I figured she's eight feet tall because the moment I saw her, I felt that she's based on the Japanese urban legend.
3744000	3750000	Hi, Hachi, shock, kasuma, kasuma, which is literally eight feet tall,
3750000	3755000	who is about a tall woman dressed in a white dress with a white brimmed hat who stalks and abducts children to kill.
3755000	3758000	So an interesting. And that's what the lady's doing is she's abducting children.
3758000	3762000	Yeah. So maybe. So actually, that makes a lot of sense to me.
3762000	3765000	I don't even know why I didn't put that together.
3765000	3769000	Well, that's the first I think that's the first time in the history of the Internet.
3769000	3774000	The comments section has been helpful. That's that's a news report all in itself.
3774000	3777000	Video game story comments section proves to be helpful.
3777000	3780000	The biggest news, this is the biggest news of the week.
3780000	3785000	We've been doing this fucking show 18 years. That's never happened.
3785000	3794000	This is it. And I don't even know why I didn't put it together, because I was actually just reading about yokai and vengeful vengeful ghosts.
3794000	3802000	And this one, I mean, that same story is played into other video games in the past.
3802000	3805000	And movies, there's been other movies, too.
3805000	3810000	All right. Bobby Blackwell says, I mean, the Vogue Network comments section is always useful.
3810000	3815000	Of course. Yes. Thank you for the cheap plug. Of course. Of course. Our own comment section regular.
3815000	3819000	We're talking about normal normal websites, popular websites.
3819000	3823000	You're average. Yeah. Yeah. Average gamer website.
3823000	3827000	All right. Anyhow, let's move on. Next story.
3827000	3831000	But thank you to our soccer. I wish I could have played the demo, but it's only on PlayStation five.
3831000	3838000	Alan said he watched a play through and I've heard things, but I'm also not super big on scary games, but I guess this one isn't gory.
3838000	3841000	I guess the preview wasn't very gory. So that's good.
3841000	3845000	We've had the debate on on getting a PS five just off and on.
3845000	3848000	But then again, we also want a hot tub and a massage chair.
3848000	3853000	So both were the investments. All right. Moving on.
3853000	3855000	Loki, what's next? Yeah.
3855000	3864000	So apparently Opera has purchased Yoyo Games, the company behind the popular game making software game maker.
3864000	3868000	And that was for 10 million dollars.
3868000	3882000	They're apparently going to use Yoyo Games knowledge and game development to hopefully bolster Opera GX and branching out into a broader ecosystem,
3882000	3892000	making more accessible to making it more accessible to novice users developing the world's leading 2D game engine by commercial studios.
3892000	3899000	So kind of a little bit, a little bit of helping out opera, a little bit helping out Yoyo Games. Cool.
3899000	3908000	Curious to see what's going to happen with that. Maybe we'll have some of these game maker engine games running natively in Opera GX.
3908000	3911000	I mean, obviously, HTML five. I guess you could do that already.
3911000	3915000	But maybe some sort of platform for that storefront. Who knows?
3915000	3921000	Yeah. You know, opera isn't I mean, Jason referenced it in the intro a little bit, but it's not always been a browser.
3921000	3923000	It's always been a browser that's caught on with the mainstream.
3923000	3929000	So is this some type of bid to maybe position it as like kind of like a gaming type of browser or, you know,
3929000	3935000	something that that makes more people kind of interested in opera because it would natively have more games?
3935000	3937000	I use opera. Do you?
3937000	3941000	It's it's my my second browser on my PC.
3941000	3948000	I use Chrome in opera and I use opera specifically for like all the stuff that I do as a sister with all my nonprofit stuff,
3948000	3954000	just for some of its encryption, although I don't like it at all on my Mac.
3954000	3959000	On my Mac, I really only use Safari, but opera is a great browser. Interesting.
3959000	3965000	Yeah, active saying the Opera GX was actually released back in twenty nineteen.
3965000	3973000	All right. Well, speaking of games and getting things improved in games, but not necessarily the official way.
3973000	3981000	Let's talk about Skyrim and a new mod that is allowing it to run at 60 frames a second on a PlayStation five,
3981000	3988000	because you may not have known, even though it's running on a PlayStation five, it's still got a frame rate lock to it, which seems silly.
3988000	3992000	But now, thanks to modding, it's Skyrim at 60 frames a second.
3992000	3997000	That is exactly, by the way, what the mod is called Skyrim at 60 FPS,
3997000	4004000	because you might remember that the console versions of Skyrim, the definitive edition do have some some type of mod support,
4004000	4007000	but they're like official mods through Bethesda and all this.
4007000	4012000	But this mod will unlock the game's frame rate on PlayStation five to boost it from 30.
4012000	4019000	And so it will, you know, make things run very smooth, although it may cause some more bugs to appear.
4019000	4028000	It was made using the creation kit, Bethesda's kit, but using a small trick that is in the software that will allow initialization,
4028000	4035000	config or dot INI files to work on the PlayStation four platform, very similar to Xbox or PC.
4035000	4038000	So that is what is allowing it to run.
4038000	4045000	And what's interesting is that even if you disable it, it will still work, allowing you to get the trophies.
4045000	4049000	That's interesting, because, yeah, usually when you're running mods, you can't get achievements or trophies,
4049000	4053000	because, you know, otherwise they'd make a mod that's just like pop all the trophies.
4053000	4055000	So usually they disable it.
4055000	4059000	But this one, actually, even if you have it and you disable it, it will still work.
4059000	4062000	It's kind of interesting because of what it's doing.
4062000	4071000	So check that out if you are curious and don't mind maybe some additional bugs caused by the game not officially supporting that sort of thing.
4071000	4075000	Let's move on. Dark Sakura.
4075000	4080000	Well, in other news, there is some absorption going on.
4080000	4086000	If we're going to move to another another game, we're going to talk about Blizzard for a bit.
4086000	4092000	They are working on doing more consolidation over Blizzard Entertainment.
4092000	4101000	Activision is, sorry, by moving in a 200 person design studio.
4101000	4108000	So they're absorbing Vicarious Visions, which has been a subsidiary of Activision since 2005.
4108000	4117000	They worked on Skylanders, Crash Bandicoot, Tony Hawk, and they are being turned solely toward Blizzard's franchises.
4117000	4128000	That includes Diablo and that their former studio head, Jennifer O'Neill, will basically be taking over Blizzard's leadership team.
4128000	4133000	So I don't know what this means for the Blizzard content.
4133000	4140000	You know, if it's going to mean a little bit more maybe about that remake of Diablo 2.
4140000	4144000	That's what the rumors are saying right now. But, you know, rumor.
4144000	4151000	Yeah. And so basically, though, that they have nothing official to say about that right now,
4151000	4159000	but that really is the big thing that they're thinking is going on with that.
4159000	4166000	And also, you know, they're also taking a step from the Warcraft 3 reforged
4166000	4174000	because of how glitchy and missing features and the really poor Metacritic score.
4174000	4178000	It was actually the lowest score for a Blizzard game.
4178000	4183000	So I'm wondering if that might have something to do with it as well.
4183000	4190000	Yeah. You know, we haven't really heard stories about Blizzard expanding into new studios in a very, very or, you know,
4190000	4193000	expanding their name and other studios in a very, very long time.
4193000	4198000	The last time I can think of is what like Blizzard North, which didn't really stick around a long time.
4198000	4201000	But even that, like that was back in the 90s, like it was a long time ago.
4201000	4205000	Maybe the early aughts was when it finally went. But that was because what did they do?
4205000	4208000	Did they do the Starcraft? Were they Starcraft Ghost?
4208000	4211000	There was something they were working on, like a big thing that got canceled.
4211000	4213000	But regardless, I don't recall.
4213000	4217000	Regardless, Blizzard hasn't done much with their game making outside of Irvine.
4217000	4220000	I mean, yes, I know there was like Paris, but that was a lot of like,
4220000	4223000	I think it was a lot of customer service and marketing for the Europe audience and so forth.
4223000	4226000	Like a lot of the game making is really right there in Irvine.
4226000	4229000	So we haven't heard like of them really expanding out of there.
4229000	4231000	At least correct me in chat if I'm wrong,
4231000	4236000	but I don't think they've been making a lot not in that office for quite some time.
4236000	4238000	So this is, you know, pretty big news for them.
4238000	4244000	Vicarious Visions, you know, those Tony Hawk remakes they just did not that long ago were really well received.
4244000	4247000	You know, for being the fact that they were Tony Hawk remakes, especially, you know,
4247000	4252000	I know people love those games, but you know, I don't think people had the bar set very high for the remakes,
4252000	4254000	but it really did live up to it.
4254000	4259000	So hearing that they could be on a Diablo 2 remake, seeing as, you know,
4259000	4264000	the expectations would be very high for that, seeing as the Warcraft 3 remake did not land.
4264000	4267000	I think Blizzard, the way Blizzard hoped it would,
4267000	4271000	it could be very interesting to see what that could mean for Blizzard's future.
4271000	4273000	Because Blizzard, we'll see.
4273000	4276000	Blizzard needs some good news.
4276000	4279000	They're going to do a Three Vikings MMO.
4279000	4281000	That would be rad. I'd be in for that.
4281000	4282000	Right?
4282000	4287000	Yeah. So, you know, again, if you want to believe rumors, which, you know, take it or leave it,
4287000	4292000	Overwatch 2 doesn't appear to be coming anytime soon.
4292000	4295000	Diablo 4, we don't know what's going on with that,
4295000	4299000	but that Diablo phone game they sure killed a BlizzCon over still isn't out.
4299000	4304000	So it just seems like Blizzard kind of needs a lot of good news and fast.
4304000	4308000	So maybe this Vicarious Visions, them being on board will help them get there.
4308000	4309000	We'll see.
4309000	4310000	All right.
4310000	4311000	Fingers and toes.
4311000	4312000	Yeah, fingers and toes.
4312000	4314000	We are, I'm rooting for Blizzard.
4314000	4317000	You know, they make a lot of great games and I want to see them continue to do that.
4317000	4320000	I haven't agreed with all their decisions in the past couple of years,
4320000	4322000	but I hope they get back there.
4322000	4323000	I hope they find it.
4323000	4325000	All right.
4325000	4330000	Act F says the rumor mill says the Overwatch 2 is coming 2022.
4330000	4332000	That's a long wait.
4332000	4336000	Especially for a game that feels like it's really derivative of the first game,
4336000	4339000	but maybe that is something they're trying to set out to change,
4339000	4341000	and that's why it's going to take a little longer.
4341000	4342000	I don't know. We'll see.
4342000	4344000	I hope they get Diablo 4 out this year,
4344000	4346000	but then at the same time, as much as I'm like,
4346000	4349000	they need to get the game out this year, but they need to get it right.
4349000	4350000	Right?
4350000	4351000	Don't rush it.
4351000	4352000	It's hard.
4352000	4354000	I say, get it out this year, but don't rush it.
4354000	4358000	It sucks, but that's the reality of, you know,
4358000	4361000	you got to get the games out to make money.
4362000	4363000	That's how it goes.
4363000	4364000	All right.
4364000	4367000	Questbuster is pointing out Diablo Immortal, the phone game.
4367000	4369000	It's in closed testing right now.
4369000	4372000	There have been a few streamers that showed it off, excuse me,
4372000	4375000	and the early word is that it's fun?
4375000	4378000	Well, that would be a great redemption arc for Blizzard.
4378000	4382000	If that Diablo phone game kicks ass, that's good news.
4382000	4384000	I don't see that as a negative at all.
4384000	4385000	Good. Good.
4385000	4388000	Make all that bullshit they put up with that one BlizzCon
4388000	4390000	and the, don't you all have phones?
4390000	4393000	Make it, make that payback in dividends.
4393000	4395000	Make the next Pokemon go.
4395000	4397000	I'd love that for Blizzard.
4397000	4406000	My expectation is very guarded, but this early news is welcome.
4406000	4411000	Believe it or not, I want the Diablo phone game to do well.
4411000	4413000	I'd love that.
4413000	4417000	Why would you want it to flop after they spent this much time on it?
4417000	4418000	Anyway.
4418000	4420000	Just want to watch the world burn, Rob.
4420000	4421000	I know, I know.
4421000	4422000	All right.
4422000	4423000	Anyway, let's move on.
4423000	4427000	Let's talk about another game that's had some awfully long longevity.
4427000	4430000	I mean, this game and streaming especially,
4430000	4433000	like so many streamers are on this game
4433000	4436000	and my husband contributes to this on a regular basis.
4436000	4437000	He doesn't stream it himself.
4437000	4438000	I wish he would.
4438000	4441000	But he plays on other streams and plays a lot of this game.
4442000	4443000	Yeah.
4443000	4447000	So Dead by Daylight, they're,
4447000	4450000	well, they sort of announced in a kind of roundabout way
4450000	4456000	that they're working on colorblind modes for the game.
4456000	4457000	A roundabout way.
4457000	4458000	That's a nice way to put it.
4458000	4460000	Yeah, it's a very nice way to put it.
4461000	4468000	So the, I guess, live balance designer Ethan Larson
4468000	4471000	had a personal Twitch stream where he was playing Dead by Daylight
4471000	4475000	and there's people that were asking him about colorblind mode
4475000	4479000	to which I guess he gets asked that often.
4479000	4482000	And so he was getting irritated by that.
4482000	4486000	And so he made the comment, you know, it's getting really boring.
4486000	4488000	We've heard it a million times.
4488000	4491000	We know continuing to badger us about it isn't going to change anything.
4491000	4494000	If it gets done, it'll get done when we have time to do it
4494000	4497000	or somebody decides that's something that should be done.
4497000	4498000	We know a lot of players want it.
4498000	4500000	We know it's not a small number.
4500000	4501000	We get it.
4501000	4502000	Yeah.
4502000	4504000	It's not the most polite way of putting it.
4504000	4508000	I saw the clip and it was very much a yikes.
4508000	4513000	You know, I understand that the guy gets asked about this a lot
4513000	4515000	and he's probably sick of being asked about it.
4515000	4520000	But the response that he gave, it's very obvious he's not on the PR side.
4520000	4521000	Very cringy.
4521000	4525000	And it is very cringy, to put it lightly.
4525000	4530000	And I think the reality is, whereas it's frustrating for him,
4530000	4534000	I think what he needs to realize is that it's incredibly fucking frustrating
4534000	4537000	when you want to play a game, but you can't
4537000	4540000	because it doesn't have the accessibility options you need
4540000	4542000	in order to make the game playable.
4542000	4545000	And I think he just had a huge foot in that.
4545000	4550000	And this is a very difficult lesson learned for everybody in the industry
4550000	4554000	who wants to do their own streams on the side and so forth
4554000	4557000	is that if you open yourself up like that,
4557000	4560000	you're going to have to be prepared that people will come in
4560000	4562000	to talk about your games.
4562000	4564000	And you're going to need to decide where to draw the line.
4564000	4567000	Most people I know have a policy of,
4567000	4571000	I don't talk about my day job when I'm streaming, period.
4571000	4572000	And they don't talk about those games.
4572000	4573000	They don't answer.
4573000	4574000	So it's a non-answer.
4574000	4578000	Unfortunately, for whatever reason, maybe he's spoken about the game before,
4578000	4580000	whatever, this guy did not have the same policy.
4580000	4587000	He spoke his mind about the game, and his mind was not in a good place.
4587000	4589000	Apparently not.
4589000	4592000	He's like, listen, I'm just trying to kill some people in this game.
4592000	4593000	I mean, come on.
4593000	4595000	But again, I would say...
4595000	4598000	You have boundaries, but there's a thing called tact.
4598000	4599000	Yes.
4599000	4600000	It was very tactless.
4600000	4601000	It was very tactless.
4601000	4605000	And I would tell this guy again, you think it's frustrating for you,
4605000	4608000	try being one of these people trying to play your game, and they can't
4608000	4612000	because of this feature that you keep promising and you keep not implementing.
4612000	4614000	Well, but now, Loki, I'm sorry.
4614000	4615000	You can go ahead and finish.
4615000	4620000	But they put out some screenshots showing it's in development and that type of stuff.
4620000	4625000	So basically, we have been working on Carblight Mode for some time,
4625000	4628000	and we are planning to release it shortly.
4628000	4631000	Before that, of course, they said this is not how we wanted to reveal this,
4631000	4636000	but we feel it's the right time, that they said in the official Twitter.
4636000	4639000	So yes, they are working on it.
4639000	4642000	They still have a date yet when it's going to be made available,
4642000	4647000	but I don't know.
4647000	4652000	Yeah, that's why PR needs to be more involved sometimes with how people interact with,
4652000	4655000	especially with different developers and stuff like that.
4655000	4658000	You've got to have people that are on board with the right messaging
4658000	4662000	because if you're just saying something ridiculous like either this guy
4662000	4667000	or back when the guy was one of those developers that was working on Stadia
4667000	4672000	talking about how you should be lucky that we don't charge you to stream our games.
4672000	4676000	Okay, maybe some of these people shouldn't be talking to the public.
4676000	4679000	Yeah, that is a very good point.
4679000	4688000	And I hate to say it because this goes against everything I really try to preach on this show,
4688000	4693000	but I think here's a good example of maybe streaming isn't for everyone.
4693000	4698000	Maybe you shouldn't do a podcast, and this is one of those cases.
4698000	4701000	And I would tell this guy, in the future,
4701000	4704000	I think it's really in your best interest and everyone's best interest,
4704000	4707000	you don't play Dead by Daylight on your stream.
4707000	4709000	Play something else.
4709000	4712000	I think it's in everyone's best interest.
4712000	4715000	You don't do that in the future, including yours.
4715000	4720000	Because you know this guy had a chat with some people,
4720000	4723000	and it probably was not a pleasant one.
4723000	4728000	And I'm sure he was advised of a similar conclusion.
4728000	4732000	Perhaps don't play this game so that people will look to you to be the authority
4732000	4739000	in speaking out on this game when you are not trained on how to speak to the public on this game.
4739000	4742000	So, anyway.
4742000	4745000	All right. That was pretty cringey.
4745000	4751000	Let's move to another cringe topic and talk about Fox News for a minute.
4751000	4753000	I'm sorry, that transition was just way too easy.
4753000	4757000	I saw a cheap shot and I had to take it.
4757000	4760000	Let's talk about this story that's kind of floating around,
4760000	4765000	and it's one of those, it's being by official people that say,
4765000	4771000	no, that isn't really true, but let's talk about it since this is a show about what gamers are talking about as well.
4771000	4773000	And this is about Mass Effect 2.
4773000	4776000	Jamie, I'm sure you've seen this cross your feed.
4776000	4783000	Apparently, the character Jack in Mass Effect 2 was originally supposed to be pansexual.
4783000	4788000	If you are not familiar with that term, it is a term similar to bisexuality.
4788000	4798000	But for some individuals, to say bisexuality implies that there is a binary when it comes to things like gender.
4798000	4805000	And the term pansexuality is to kind of get around that essentially by saying you are attracted to all genders.
4805000	4810000	I am not here to tell people how to define themselves.
4810000	4815000	That is a topic I don't want to address because if you consider yourself bi, you consider yourself pan,
4815000	4820000	that is a journey for you and what have you.
4820000	4823000	I just want to make sure people understand when they see that term.
4823000	4825000	That's basically what it means.
4825000	4828000	Jamie, did I do a fair assessment there just to make sure?
4828000	4829000	Yes.
4829000	4832000	Okay, thank you. All right.
4832000	4834000	Now, let's talk about Jack.
4834000	4836000	And why do we say that with Jack?
4836000	4842000	Because Jack is only romanceable by male Shepard or M Shep in the game.
4842000	4849000	Originally, the rumor is she was supposed to be romanceable by female Shepard as well,
4849000	4855000	which would have made her the first character that actually romances both sexes.
4855000	4862000	Hold on, I know you're all going to say Liara, but the difference with Liara is that the Asari were a mono-gendered race.
4862000	4866000	There is only one gender of Asari that is very female presenting.
4866000	4869000	So most people just assume all Asaris are female, basically.
4869000	4870000	But there is a difference there.
4870000	4878000	That's what would have been the big deal about Jack is because Jack would have truly been a human, essentially, that is a pangender character.
4878000	4881000	Gender, pansexual.
4881000	4885000	I'm sorry. Yes, I'm sorry. Pansexual is what I meant to say.
4885000	4888000	Although pangender is real and valid.
4888000	4892000	Oh, no, I'm very well aware. Yes, yes, absolutely.
4892000	4898000	Anyway, anyhow, and it's been years since this game came out.
4898000	4900000	This game is over ten years old and people kind of wondered.
4900000	4907000	Because Jack was presented in a way in the game where you kind of, like, I don't know how to say it, but you kind of assumed.
4907000	4909000	You never should assume that type of thing.
4909000	4914000	But there were little context clues in the things she would say and her backstory and so forth that kind of made you think,
4914000	4921000	you know, she probably, when it came to sexuality, was a very, you know, fluid character.
4921000	4924000	And that didn't end up actually being the case.
4924000	4926000	And so that was a little bit of a surprise.
4926000	4933000	Now, apparently what happened, if rumors are to be believed, is because when the original Mass Effect game launched,
4933000	4937000	Fox News did a whole stupid ass thing where they were getting in there.
4937000	4943000	And I want to say the people that were even on this panel went back and said they'd never played the damn game.
4943000	4945000	Which was so fucking frustrating.
4945000	4949000	But anyway, it led to all this criticism about Mass Effect.
4949000	4952000	But the feelings were still hurt, so, you know, it's valid, right?
4952000	4959000	So apparently the sex scenes in Mass Effect got criticism and then the fact that there was a non-straight romance,
4959000	4962000	but it's far more complicated than that, honestly.
4962000	4971000	But anyway, and as the story goes, apparently because of this Fox News and what ended up getting discussed there,
4971000	4975000	they had to kind of scale back what was happening with Jack.
4976000	4985000	Also kind of adding fuel to the fire, the voice actress for Jack, Courtney Taylor, said she was originally supposed to be a pansexual character.
4985000	4986000	In a quote,
5006000	5013000	She's saying this in a nice way to not make BioWare the bad guy, I think, and that is speaking with tact.
5013000	5016000	That's the way to do it. Just an interesting roundabout way.
5016000	5020000	She's able to criticize, yet compliment. See that?
5020000	5024000	Anyway, I don't know if it came down to a budget constraint or maybe someone being like,
5024000	5028000	this is too obvious, because everyone was like, of course she's a lesbian.
5028000	5032000	But my sense was always that she was pansexual and it just didn't get followed through.
5032000	5035000	Of course the community modded it immediately so you can have it your way.
5035000	5042000	And so that obviously led to, or sorry, an interesting thought is that in the very first game,
5042000	5049000	there was a same-sex romance between male Shepard and Kate and Alinko where the lines were taped for it.
5049000	5056000	And you can actually mod those lines back into the game, but it's just they never fully finished the rendering and all that.
5056000	5061000	So if you try to do it with mods, it's a little bit held together by duct tape, we'll say.
5061000	5065000	But you can do it through mods. So anyway.
5065000	5073000	But this makes me think that when they do the new release, if they might put those options back in.
5073000	5080000	I would love that so much as just a nice little extra thing, especially since it's all there anyway.
5080000	5085000	You're absolutely right. If they're going to go back and do the remaster trilogy anyway,
5085000	5090000	if the voice acting already exists, if they're going back and fixing Mass Effect 1 anyway,
5090000	5094000	I don't know how much they're changing too, but why not put some of these romances back in?
5094000	5096000	That would be amazing.
5096000	5102000	I would be happy to give my money all over again for that to kind of be the definitive version of the game
5102000	5107000	where Jack is pansexual, as even the voice actress thought she was supposed to be,
5107000	5112000	where Kayden was able to have a gay romance with male Shepard since the first game,
5112000	5114000	the way it was originally written as.
5114000	5123000	I realize for everybody it's not a big deal, but for me, I think I'd love that. It would be great.
5123000	5132000	And the thing that people need to realize is that it would be bisexual or pansexual either way,
5132000	5142000	which often is fairly erased. I mean, how many times have we had female friends who were in a relationship with a girl
5142000	5147000	and then you hear, oh, they've gone straight. No, they haven't. They're bisexual.
5147000	5151000	Yeah. And it's a real problem with men too.
5151000	5156000	There's a lot of men who don't come out as bisexual because they just get labeled gay.
5156000	5161000	And so it's the bisexual erasure, essentially.
5161000	5166000	And again, I'm not trying to get too preachy here, but I'm trying to help people who maybe aren't.
5166000	5167000	But it's part of it.
5167000	5169000	Yeah. I'm trying to help people who aren't part of the LGBT community.
5169000	5174000	And we have a lot of those that listen to this show who are cis hetero white dudes.
5174000	5177000	And that's cool. This show's for all gamers.
5177000	5183000	And you guys have always been supportive. I've made no secret on this show that I'm gay.
5183000	5185000	Jamie makes no secret she's ace.
5185000	5189000	And we've had plenty of people from all around the spectrum on this show,
5189000	5192000	thanks to taking phone calls and the guests over the years.
5192000	5197000	But my point is I'm trying to explain it in a way so that maybe if it's not a big deal for you,
5197000	5202000	you can understand a little bit better maybe why it's a big deal for somebody else.
5202000	5209000	That's all. I'm not trying to, you know, say every video game character in the world needs to be bi.
5209000	5217000	No. But it would be nice to have that representation out there because a lot of times in social settings,
5217000	5220000	it gets erased because somebody will say, I'm bisexual.
5220000	5224000	And then it's like, no, you're not because you're married to somebody the opposite gender.
5224000	5229000	Like, you haven't been bisexual since college. That is shit that people say.
5229000	5234000	I know. Or like, but you married a guy. And I'm like, yeah.
5234000	5236000	So? Yeah.
5236000	5240000	Does that change anything? No.
5240000	5244000	No. Anyway. Thank you.
5244000	5249000	DJ Rama S in chat says, Rob, you are not being preachy. You are teaching others, which is always a good thing.
5249000	5253000	Yes, I am coming from a place of teaching. That is what we're trying to do here at OLR.
5253000	5257000	Pixel pockets and chat says, thanks, OLR. I appreciate you talking about this.
5257000	5260000	Not a problem. It's you know what? And here's the thing.
5260000	5265000	Like, I'm part of the LGBTQ community, right? I'm I'm a gay dude.
5265000	5270000	But I realized that I am a gay dude that, you know, yes, gay dudes.
5270000	5273000	There's a lot of bullshit that happens, a lot of stuff we have to fight out there.
5273000	5277000	And I've really seen it, you know, kind of change over the past 20, 25 years.
5277000	5287000	But I very clearly understand and have seen how black and brown gay people have it worse and transgender.
5287000	5291000	How about the rampant misogyny among gay men? Oh, yeah, it's an issue.
5291000	5295000	Yeah, absolutely. Gold star gay. It's a gross term. It really is.
5295000	5299000	I have punched somebody before for saying, oh, it's OK that I grabbed you.
5299000	5302000	It's because I'm gay. No, it's not OK. I didn't give you permission to touch me.
5302000	5311000	Absolutely not OK. Not OK. And, you know, and and transgender men and women like, you know, they are still a part of that community.
5311000	5314000	And so I think from the beginning. Absolutely.
5314000	5321000	Who threw the first brick at Stonewall? And my my my point with all that is that like I.
5321000	5330000	So I do have. Yes, I am gay, but I recognize that there's a lot of other stuff and I'm going to use this position to try to teach about the other stuff, too.
5330000	5335000	And I might not be bisexual myself. I'm very comfortably gay.
5335000	5344000	But when I do kind of sit back and think about like and I've because I've dated bisexual dudes in the past, you know, and I'm married now.
5344000	5348000	But in the past, I've dated bisexual men and I've seen it kind of firsthand.
5348000	5355000	And, you know, maybe I wasn't always perfect myself either. And I've kind of realized over the years, like, oh, man, that was a fucked up thing I said.
5356000	5361000	And I should maybe like teach others not to hurt somebody the way I might have in the past.
5361000	5365000	And I think that's the best way you can kind of atone for a mistake you did in the past.
5365000	5371000	Everybody has problematic things in their past. The ones who stay problematic are the ones who are the problem.
5371000	5381000	Those who learn and change are are the ones who should go out and help others learn and change as well.
5381000	5390000	And then let's see. Act up says so many things wrong with the world and especially with minorities and minorities within minorities.
5390000	5394000	Yes. And I think I think the phrasing may have come off. I totally know what you mean to say there.
5394000	5399000	And yes, absolutely. And Tiger class says, what about people who are asexual? I'm sure they're often mocked.
5399000	5407000	Dude, all the time, like all I you know, and maybe it's not my place to explain all the ways.
5407000	5412000	But like, I know plenty of asexual people. One of them is loud and proud here on this program.
5412000	5421000	And I'm sure Jamie, maybe you want to speak on this. But like, there is so much bullshit that asexual people have to put up with.
5421000	5428000	Oh, yeah, because we're like even more mythical, I think, bisexual people in some cases.
5428000	5437000	But maybe and I'm putting my sarcasm voice on. Maybe you just haven't found the right person yet, Jamie.
5437000	5448000	Yeah, that's yeah. And to be fair and where I where I can relate, that's the same line that's been this is why we're part of the same family.
5448000	5454000	That's the same line that's been used against me as to why don't I date women?
5454000	5462000	Oh, you just haven't found the right woman yet. It's not that there's lots of wonderful women in the world.
5462000	5473000	It's not that I'm just not wired that way. That's not how it works. And so I love going to people and say, well, when did you decide to be straight?
5473000	5482000	Or some guy who's, you know, oh, you need to go out and get, you know, get a wife like, well, why haven't you found a husband yet?
5482000	5497000	I love turning the I love turning the conversation around on them. I do, you know, and like and like for me, for for me being, you know, who and what I am, you know, I it doesn't matter who accepts it or not.
5497000	5507000	I don't care. It's not going to change. You know, this person that I am, you're not it's not going to change. Other people's opinion isn't going to change the fact.
5507000	5518000	And that's with everything going on. The whole covid thing, all of it. You cannot just delude yourself into pretending something doesn't exist or something isn't real.
5518000	5530000	And to treat somebody like there's something wrong with them because they don't fit into your viewpoint of what they should be is disgusting.
5530000	5537000	It is a disgusting habit. It's a disgusting thing that people are teaching their children and it needs to fucking stop.
5537000	5542000	And let's let's have another teaching moment here in chat. I was going to wrap this up, but I need to address this question.
5542000	5547000	Tiger con chat says, is pansexual someone who's attracted to something that isn't human, right?
5547000	5552000	That's actually incorrect. But let me set you on the right path here in a moment. Would furries fall into that?
5552000	5558000	Because there are people who are into anthropomorphic characters. Furries could fall into that category.
5558000	5563000	But pansexual is basically, as I understand it, I am not pansexual myself.
5563000	5570000	But as I understand it, people use that label because they are attracted to somebody regardless of gender.
5570000	5574000	There are multiple, there are more than two. There are more than two genders.
5574000	5581000	However, there are a lot of bisexual individuals that still feel that the historical purpose is because I want to make sure this is clear.
5581000	5587000	There's a lot of bisexual people who also feel that way and who will also say, I use the label bisexual because what I'm comfortable with.
5587000	5593000	But I also recognize there's more than two genders. Just because I say I'm bisexual doesn't mean I won't date somebody who's nonbinary, you know, or something like that.
5593000	5602000	So I do want to make sure that point because that is an argument that I think is greater than this show that the community has to kind of figure out.
5602000	5609000	That I also kind of think it's really like I'm not here to tell somebody what label they need to use to identify themselves.
5609000	5617000	But I will say to educate the comment pansexuality has nothing to do with inner species. That's not what it is.
5617000	5620000	It's just all genders, period.
5620000	5638000	And to offer a really good reason, one of my favorite podcasts, Stuff Mom Never Told You, did several different episodes on outlying bisexuality, different sexualities, gender identity, a bunch of really good episodes.
5638000	5646000	And if you really want something well researched and in-depth, I would absolutely say go find those episodes.
5646000	5649000	Because they really go well into detail.
5649000	5658000	Yes. And let me say one more thing to be fair and then I will refer you out to other shows and other podcasts to further educate on this topic as Jamie just did because I think that's the right idea.
5658000	5665000	But I just want to make sure I'm clear because when we talk about like furries and that is furries pansexual.
5665000	5673000	Furries can be pansexual. Furries can be gay. Furries can be straight. Furries can be anything. Just like, you know, humans can be.
5673000	5683000	I think it's also important to state though that furry is not always a sexual thing. And I think that most furries I know would want me to make that clear.
5683000	5691000	Being furry isn't instantly a sexual thing. It's not about that for everybody. For some, sure.
5691000	5705000	Being furry can also mean that you're into that kink. Just like some people are into leather as a kink. Some people are into role play of different varieties as their kink.
5705000	5717000	But furry is more like, I put it along the lines of like the Lolita and everything as a lifestyle as a community.
5717000	5726000	That you happen to identify with a particular animal to show part of your persona.
5726000	5732000	So the furries who are into it for a sexual nature, that's furry kink.
5732000	5737000	Yeah, it's a furry kink. Exactly. Like a leather kink.
5737000	5744000	I mean, we all know puppies actually kind of marry the furry and leather together.
5744000	5747000	We're getting way too much into the kink community.
5747000	5757000	Yeah, let's go back. But look, hey, you know what? Those of you that have listened to this whole thing while we've completely deviated from the original story and used it as a moment to teach.
5757000	5763000	Just thank you guys for letting us teach and letting us kind of like talk about some of these issues that are important to us sometimes.
5763000	5764000	What I do as a sister.
5764000	5772000	I know. And I just I just want to say how much I appreciate this OLR family and the people and Loki who just sits there and listens.
5772000	5783000	I appreciate everybody that lets us do this and realizes that, you know, we're just here to try to make you maybe think a little bit different.
5783000	5786000	Put yourself in some shoes that maybe aren't necessarily yours.
5786000	5794000	And I think so much of what so many people are asking for on social media about gaming and so forth, a lot of representation on that stuff.
5794000	5804000	So much of it becomes so much more clear when you do take a moment to put yourself in somebody else's shoes that I think it is important once in a while for us to just like have some little reminders here.
5804000	5807000	A little few reminders here on our.
5807000	5810000	So thank you for letting us teach and thank you for listening, especially if you made it all this way.
5811000	5818000	Appreciate it. And hey, if anyone has questions, I'm sure would be happy to answer a message or three on on the Twitters.
5818000	5826000	Right. Absolutely. But I know if you're going to ask me about furries, I'm going to refer you to some people I know that might be willing to answer those questions.
5826000	5831000	So I mean, I may not know the answer myself, but I probably know somebody, you know.
5831000	5834000	Yeah. So I definitely know.
5834000	5844000	I mean, I think many of our circles in the community overlap, so we know we know people who know people who know people.
5844000	5852000	Or as Fifth Dream in chat says, refer you.
5852000	5857000	All right. Thank you. That was that was the cheap joke we needed to move on.
5857000	5861000	All right. Let's get to the classic game of the week.
5862000	5865000	It doesn't in this case, but it would be OK if it did.
5865000	5871000	All right. We're going to take a trip down memory lane and dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks.
5871000	5876000	Hey, you brats, you should you should check this game out.
5876000	5880000	Put down your mass effects and your your new fangled games.
5880000	5884000	You don't need a remaster. You need the classics. Dark soccer.
5884000	5887000	What is the classic game of the week?
5887000	5898000	I picked Devil Summoner Soul Hackers, which is a game I still have two copies of, and I forgot who wanted my extra copy, so shrug emoji.
5898000	5905000	But at any rate, it is a role playing game developed by Atlas that's part of the Megami Tensei series.
5905000	5916000	It is the second of the Devil Summoner sub series. It was originally published by Atlas for the Sega Saturn in 1997, ported to the PlayStation in 1999,
5916000	5920000	and then got a release on the Nintendo 3DS in 2012.
5920000	5932000	So it takes place in a town called Amami City, which is a very technologically advanced Japanese town or big city, I should say.
5932000	5942000	And so you are playing a member of a hacker group called the Spookies who are trying to get into a closed beta for something called Paradigm X,
5942000	5946000	which is an online game that would connect the citizens of the city.
5946000	5957000	And so they meet supernatural forces while working on it and have to work with this hacker group to see what's going on,
5957000	5969000	because demons suddenly pop up, including one called Nemisa, who is a demon that possesses his friend Hitomi.
5969000	5976000	So it began development in 1996 after the first Devil Summoner.
5976000	5986000	The character design was done by Kaneko Kazuma, and the original producer was Okada Koji.
5986000	5995000	And so while none of the other Soul Hacker, I'm sorry, the first two versions of Soul Hackers never did get the US release,
5995000	6002000	the 3DS version was localized and it actually had a fairly positive reception.
6002000	6005000	Yeah, I'm hacking them souls, Phoenix.
6005000	6009000	Anyway, like I said, it is a role play game.
6009000	6016000	You navigate your dungeons in a first person view and you have puzzles and you fight in turn based battles.
6016000	6024000	You have one or two human characters in your party, but you also have the ability to summon up to four demons to fight with you.
6024000	6030000	And you'll get access to these demons by speaking to enemy demons and negotiating with them.
6030000	6034000	So you have to answer questions or intimidate or give them things that they look for.
6034000	6041000	And then you can fuse all of your demons into a single demon if you want to.
6041000	6047000	It's kind of crazy. That was actually fairly, fairly novel for its time.
6047000	6054000	And then you have to manage your demons based on their personalities, alignment, abilities.
6054000	6058000	So like a friendly one would be healing or defensive.
6058000	6062000	A sly one would attack enemies by themselves.
6062000	6067000	But if you give them an ability that they don't want to use, think of like Pokemon like that way,
6067000	6076000	there is a risk that they will refuse to do that or do something completely different or not do anything at all.
6076000	6081000	And different demon alignments, they can choose not to cooperate.
6081000	6084000	They can be antagonistic toward each other.
6084000	6092000	But you are able to also get at these marketplaces, magnetite that is fuel for demons.
6092000	6098000	And if you run out of magnetite, then your demons start taking damage.
6098000	6101000	So that's pretty much as it is.
6101000	6110000	So you are going through, you have other members of your group.
6110000	6116000	And you have characters named 6Lunch, Yuichi, and then Hitomi.
6116000	6125000	And so they were basically doing just pranks, shenanigans.
6125000	6129000	And then it goes all downhill from there.
6129000	6132000	So this has nothing to do with Pokemon.
6132000	6137000	Although the whole demon thing, the way that you treat them,
6137000	6145000	I would say would be a more complicated play on, I guess, the Pokemon kind of theme.
6145000	6151000	Well, there were a lot of games not long after, and this is kind of in that era of not long after Pokemon,
6151000	6156000	that were trying to, I don't want to say copy it because obviously this game isn't that,
6156000	6160000	but kind of find the similar formula.
6160000	6164000	Find the secret that helps the game be successful.
6164000	6166000	I don't know.
6166000	6174000	But also, several of the Persona people who later went on to the Persona games
6174000	6180000	worked on this one too, including Shigenori Sulejima.
6180000	6185000	He was actually responsible for sub-character designs and item graphics and character portraits.
6185000	6193000	But basically, this one tried to move it around to different points of view
6193000	6197000	of the different characters as they went through the game.
6197000	6203000	And even tried to work in a devil motif and design into some of the characters.
6203000	6211000	A lot of this is just really embedded into the game and has shown up in later on games.
6211000	6219000	So there were a few different things that went on.
6219000	6223000	Like this particular character, the main protagonist, was not a trained summoner like the first one.
6223000	6226000	This one had to learn everything as you went along.
6226000	6230000	So it was actually pretty interesting.
6231000	6239000	And they really pushed a little bit more of that cyberpunk setting with this game
6239000	6245000	and used completely different styles of music to make them go together.
6245000	6252000	For example, music being the fusion of jazz and electronica.
6252000	6257000	And that was composed by Meguro Shoji.
6257000	6262000	He did really good work. He also did work on Macanex.
6262000	6268000	But anyway, the game itself was released for the Sega Saturn on November 13th, 1997.
6268000	6273000	And had a supplementary disc that was called Devil Summoner Soulhacker's Akuma Zenshō 2.
6273000	6276000	That came out on December 23rd of the same year.
6276000	6282000	And that contained a postcard entry for a draw from one of 1000 copies of an extra dungeon.
6283000	6288000	Because the game was so popular, it got a PlayStation release on April 8th, 1999.
6288000	6294000	And then there was of course a Sony budget released on July 27th, 2000.
6294000	6300000	The PlayStation port had new story events, including the Paradigm X casino
6300000	6304000	and the version of the Devil Zenshō 2 dungeon.
6304000	6312000	The Nintendo 3DS version came out. It was announced to be released in 2012 on August 30th.
6312000	6318000	And the port was based off the PlayStation version, but also included some different enhancements to it.
6318000	6324000	There was a new demo that came out. All kinds of goodies were put into it.
6324000	6329000	Some redesign for some of the music, some of the sound.
6330000	6337000	And then the game was released in Japan on the eShop on December 25th, 2014.
6340000	6345000	Sorry, not you. I talked to Alan. Sorry.
6345000	6350000	Anyway, so it did get American. I thought my mouth was away from the mic.
6350000	6354000	I wasn't even looking at you. I just got quiet. Oh, I'm sorry.
6354000	6358000	Anyway, the game was announced for North American release December 2012.
6358000	6362000	It was published April 16th, 2013 by Atlas USA.
6362000	6365000	And then it's a digital download July 2nd.
6365000	6373000	So Soul Hackers is one of the 10 original Megami Tensei characters to be rated M for Mature.
6373000	6380000	It did get a European release on September 20th, 2013.
6380000	6383000	And digital on September 25th.
6383000	6388000	So for the localization, they tried to localize the PlayStation version,
6388000	6395000	but because of Sony of America's content approval policy, it didn't quite make it out.
6395000	6399000	So the 3DS version is the first one to be released outside of the US.
6401000	6408000	They were trying to treat it like a new game as opposed to a port in the US.
6408000	6414000	So the translation part took about a month. The localization took around eight months.
6414000	6421000	And they tried to introduce some elements of humor, like the Japanese script did.
6421000	6424000	And so if they didn't think it would work well as a direct translation,
6424000	6427000	they did a little bit of fourth wall breaking.
6427000	6431000	So a few things that weren't quite in the original.
6431000	6438000	So anyway, the 3DS version of Soul Hackers had some average reviews.
6438000	6442000	A lot of people enjoyed the battle system,
6442000	6449000	but some people thought that there just was a little bit more that could have been done.
6449000	6454000	Like the dungeon had some blurry wall textures and that it was getting monotonous.
6454000	6460000	But they thought the battle system was a good amount of reward for the effort that it took.
6460000	6470000	So when it first was released, Soul Hackers sold 160,850 units in its first week.
6470000	6477000	And as of 2007, the game had sold 258,679.
6477000	6481000	It became the 27th best selling Saturn title in Japan.
6481000	6489000	And of course, you know, the fact that we got it in the US at all was, I'd say, fairly good.
6489000	6490000	It was great.
6490000	6497000	But the one that we got, I'd say, was pretty outdated by the time that we got it.
6497000	6502000	You know, if we go back and play it on Saturn, heck yeah, that looks great.
6502000	6509000	Not everything in bringing it over worked well for the 3DS.
6509000	6515000	And I do have an extra copy of Soul Hackers.
6515000	6518000	So let me know if you want it.
6519000	6520000	We'll talk.
6520000	6521000	All right.
6521000	6524000	The case is cracked, I think, but the game still works.
6526000	6527000	All right.
6527000	6532000	Well, thank you so much for because I have to admit, this is this is a game I didn't know much about at all.
6532000	6539000	So it's I like how sometimes the classic game of the week is is a very obvious thing, you know, for lack of a better word, like a game.
6539000	6540000	Yeah, I was going to give it to Bobby.
6540000	6542000	All right, Bobby, it's yours.
6542000	6544000	I was going to give the game to Bobby.
6544000	6546000	Bobby, remind me to send it to you.
6547000	6551000	And then sometimes you get a game where it's like, what the hell is this?
6551000	6557000	Or I'm sure like there's probably two or three people in chat that are like, fuck, yeah, this game, you know, but the rest of us have no idea.
6557000	6560000	So it's it's fun to sometimes learn about a new game.
6560000	6561000	So, yeah.
6561000	6566000	Well, and, you know, I have a big love for a lot of those Saturn RPGs.
6566000	6567000	Of course.
6568000	6569000	I mean.
6569000	6579000	One game I would totally love to I need to actually, I guess, burn myself a translated copy is a black matrix.
6579000	6588000	But there's just some amazing RPGs that came out in the Saturn that never saw the light of the day in the US unless they had been ported to PlayStation.
6588000	6596000	I think it's no secret that if you go through the history of the classic game of the week, which you can do over on the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki, if you rely on.
6596000	6598000	Thank you for updating it.
6598000	6604000	If you actually go back to that and look through it, you're going to find that the classic games of the week, they're kind of disproportionately Sega.
6604000	6608000	But that's that's OK. It's it's, you know, it's Jamie segment and that's the game sheet.
6608000	6610000	All right.
6610000	6617000	If someone has time, I'm looking at several people in chat, make a chart for me.
6617000	6619000	Make me a pie chart, a pie chart.
6619000	6621000	You want you want spreadsheets, you want cross tabs?
6621000	6623000	No, I don't spreadsheets.
6623000	6625000	I want a pie chart.
6625000	6627000	I just want that.
6627000	6629000	Well, we have monkey bread.
6629000	6630000	Damn monkey bread.
6630000	6639000	But anyway, I want I want a couple of pie charts, one of them by publisher, like original, you know.
6639000	6645000	Company publishing it, developing and then one by system.
6645000	6649000	Like original system release, I guess, that I reviewed it for.
6649000	6657000	All right. What she's asking for, we need a classic game access database so we can run reports.
6657000	6659000	All right.
6659000	6661000	I'm going to go get my monkey bread.
6661000	6662000	Yes. Get your bread.
6662000	6663000	I have more monkey bread.
6663000	6665000	But don't miss rapid fire news.
6665000	6666000	I worked hard.
6666000	6672000	All right. That's what we're going to get into next is our rapid fire news segment and get into that.
6672000	6676000	First, before we do that, I got to ask Loki because I didn't call this out earlier in the show.
6676000	6680000	But is is that not President Cat running behind you tonight?
6680000	6682000	The game is president or is OK.
6682000	6685000	I'm sure most of our fans know the story by now.
6685000	6692000	But if you didn't, because this was inauguration week, after all, this would have been back in 2008.
6692000	6696000	It was a long time ago, OK, because this is when Obama ran for office the first time.
6696000	6698000	And yes, this show was on the air.
6698000	6701000	It was already over five years old at that point.
6701000	6708000	But we were doing release dates, which is a segment that's coming up here on our show quite shortly.
6708000	6709000	We're going to get into release dates.
6709000	6712000	For those of you watching live can see it over there on the sidebar.
6712000	6717000	And we came across this game, which I believe the name was Suki bonds.
6717000	6722000	So chow Renno, we it was Suki bonds and chow chow Renno.
6722000	6727000	We it was basically like a corporate delinquent girl.
6727000	6734000	But I misread a shout out because I mean, I knew what it meant, but it was hard to describe.
6734000	6738000	So I was like president something. And thus the name President Cat was born.
6738000	6748000	We started calling this game President Cat. And it kind of led to this whole soapbox moment where we were talking about the Nintendo Wii and all that,
6748000	6752000	because that's what this game was for and all the shovelware that was coming out for Nintendo Wii at the time.
6752000	6756000	And I think, you know, and this actually ties into the classic game of the week that Jamie's did really,
6756000	6762000	because this was a note of we're sitting here going, why is this game only exists in Japan?
6762000	6764000	Quick, how many of you in chat? Look at this.
6764000	6770000	This is Cat doing crazy shit out in the real world, like skateboarding down a hill and all this stuff.
6770000	6774000	This looks fucking ridiculous. How many of you in chat would play this?
6774000	6781000	And of course, all of your hands shot up immediately because when have you had like a game here starring a cat doing things?
6781000	6784000	And so the concept of President Cat was just kind of like ludicrous.
6784000	6790000	But at the same time, is it the silliest thing you've ever heard about on the Wii? Not by a long shot.
6790000	6795000	So why wasn't the Wii getting more stuff like this, especially when it had already been released in Japan?
6795000	6801000	So this led to a whole thing about we need to localize President Cat and we actually tweeted the developer.
6801000	6803000	Now, here's the here's the funny kind of other side of this.
6803000	6805000	Apparently, this game didn't do well in Japan.
6806000	6810000	It was the worst selling game on the Wii, apparently.
6810000	6817000	Did anybody more than a former Kotaku writer claim to have the facts behind that?
6817000	6820000	Because I still question that to this day.
6820000	6827000	I cannot understand how this would possibly be the worst selling game, especially when people over here were importing it.
6827000	6831000	It only sold 100 copies. Ten of them were over here. I don't think so.
6831000	6833000	I don't think so.
6834000	6839000	I never saw the receipts to justify those headlines. I'm sorry.
6839000	6846000	So anyway, my point with that whole thing is so but we did get some like minor coverage on some of the blogs
6846000	6852000	because the company behind President Cat actually noticed us because this was back when Twitter was still kind of new.
6852000	6857000	And so it was like, why are all these people in America getting excited about this game that we're not even releasing there?
6857000	6858000	And so they started tweeting us.
6858000	6864000	Thank you, we think. Thank you for being a fan. Please look forward to the game, you know, like those types of things.
6864000	6866000	I think not fully understanding.
6866000	6869000	I'm actually checking the Wikipedia page to see if we're still mentioned in it.
6869000	6872000	Yep. Our article that we were in, I found it.
6872000	6873000	Yeah.
6873000	6876000	It's still from Destructoid.
6876000	6878000	I'll link it in chat.
6878000	6886000	And DJ Rama S in chat says, fact, one of the cons I attended, ZenkaCon, got this game in its gaming room either 2008 or 2009.
6886000	6889000	And yeah, like.
6889000	6897000	I again, I failed to see how because the rabble rabble star and, you know, it's the one thing we kind of did here at OLR and also we started it.
6897000	6899000	And the rabble rabble got kind of out there.
6899000	6907000	And now, you know, anime cons are bringing it in and so forth because, yes, you know, as it turns out, people love cats.
6907000	6912000	Even people who are allergic are kind of like, man, I wish I wasn't allergic to cats.
6912000	6915000	You know, there's at least kind of usually that moment. Sorry.
6915000	6918000	Sorry to anybody out there who is allergic to cats who might feel differently.
6918000	6921000	But I still feel that the vast majority of people love cats.
6921000	6923000	More people love cats than love Madden.
6923000	6925000	That's a fact.
6925000	6927000	That is a fact.
6927000	6930000	So I.
6930000	6936000	Yeah. Anyway, so I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get on a tangent, but we haven't talked about that little thing in a while.
6936000	6942000	Loki's background made me think of that and how to this day we never did get our localized copy.
6942000	6947000	Apparently the publisher did go under not like so maybe that that's the only receipt done.
6947000	6952000	Yeah, that's that's the only receipts I've seen that maybe this game didn't do that well after all.
6952000	6956000	But yeah. So anyway, sorry.
6956000	6960000	I don't know where I was going with that, but just 109 bucks for it now.
6960000	6963000	And I want the game. What's that? I have the game.
6963000	6967000	You can never copy. OK, thank you. Or you can borrow my copy. I don't care.
6967000	6971000	I have it still. I have the box copy. I thought it was like right here.
6971000	6975000	But that's not it. But no, I still have it somewhere.
6975000	6980000	I totally want to just play through it now that I'm getting better with reading.
6980000	6986000	All right. Anyway, pod culture says, quick, maybe we can chip in and buy the IP for VOG.
6986000	6991000	I'm not. Well, I think this came up on a show half year or a year ago or so.
6991000	6996000	And I said, I'd buy the rights, but I'm just going to give them to YY are because I'm not going to be.
6996000	7000000	But now that Loki makes games, maybe maybe I have to retract that.
7000000	7005000	Sorry, Aaron. But you helped create a monster here in Loki.
7005000	7009000	And now maybe we got to give the rights to Loki. I don't know.
7009000	7015000	So we should just let it be what it is. There's been already we had the cat president game.
7015000	7020000	We have the people on from that. Just let the meme die.
7020000	7029000	You know what? I need to I need to finally get off my butt and make my my visual novel.
7029000	7036000	Yes. With one of the characters being President Cat, who is the CEO of Orange Lounge.
7036000	7043000	OK, so speaking of visual novels, then there was a game and I think was it 2012 or 2016.
7043000	7047000	There was a game called Cat President that ended up coming out on steam.
7047000	7054000	And of course, I reached out equal. Yeah, I reached out to the developer and I was like, do you know who we are?
7054000	7057000	And of course, it's no. But he came on that show and he was he was a great sport.
7057000	7061000	He had a great sense of humor. All his motivations for the game were perfect.
7061000	7063000	And yeah, it's still out there. Check it out.
7063000	7070000	And so he had no I obviously had no idea about this whole dumb thing we had done in 2008 with President Cat and everything.
7070000	7073000	But, you know, we wanted we wanted to give the game our blessing.
7073000	7079000	And we did. And yeah, he ended up making a sequel either in 2016 or this most recent election.
7079000	7083000	I get all the years are boring. It was 2020. OK, perfect.
7083000	7087000	Yeah, October. Yeah. So and it's great to see him still being successful and so forth.
7087000	7093000	So maybe we'd buy the rights and give it to him. I don't know. Anyway, let's we don't have we don't have the money.
7093000	7098000	Let's stop joking. All right. Oh, Bobby's digging up all these old tweets.
7098000	7103000	Wow. Y'all are putting your search engines to work on Twitter tonight.
7103000	7112000	Now, this. OK, so the account still exists over at Renno. What is President Cat who actually tweeted what is President Cat?
7112000	7117000	That was the official account of the game. They still have followers.
7117000	7123000	Yeah, as they should. Even though they're gone, somebody needs to tweet them.
7123000	7128000	You there. You stopped answering my calls. All right.
7128000	7132000	Moving on. Enough, enough, enough. All right. I don't know if I ever saw that tweet.
7132000	7139000	What is President Cat? Seriously?
7139000	7144000	Someday, long after this show is gone. And I'm gone.
7144000	7148000	I want you to print that tweet out and bury me with it.
7148000	7152000	I just can't wait for the articles about this brand new Nintendo game that's coming out.
7152000	7158000	That's all about pooping on things that that just screams, you know, clickbait headlines.
7158000	7164000	So it's just a matter of time. Well, you know, and what's interesting about the whole thing and shout out to YY as well,
7164000	7167000	because I did beta test his version of Pixel Poops on Steam.
7167000	7172000	And if you all haven't checked that out in the VOG Network discord, go, you know, YY posted a lot of great info.
7172000	7177000	How you can check that game out, too. And it's funny. It's it's interesting because even though
7177000	7185000	when YY did it on the Vita, it may be sold a few copies with OLR listeners and, you know, a very limited audience.
7185000	7191000	It has its own what was it, Metacritic page. Does it?
7191000	7197000	Yeah, because so him putting it on Steam triggered a bunch of different automated things on different websites.
7197000	7205000	So, for example, GameSpot has its own dedicated forums to it. They have its own Metacritic page.
7205000	7211000	Stuff like that. It's just funny. But yeah, even the Vita version has its own Metacritic page.
7211000	7216000	But there's no reviews, obviously. Well, we need we need to load it up with some force.
7216000	7219000	No, I'm just kidding. Don't don't do anything against the rules.
7219000	7225000	But but my point I was going with all this is that now that you have this NES version, you know,
7225000	7228000	maybe that's the thing that suddenly gets people to notice.
7228000	7234000	And I think it's going to have a positive effect for what YY did originally as well, because it's the whole.
7234000	7236000	This is so fucking weird to talk about.
7236000	7243000	But the whole franchise is going to get a little more boost and a little more notice because you'd not just have the Steam release.
7243000	7247000	And people are going to notice it there. But this Nintendo crazy thing you're doing, it's going to be there.
7247000	7252000	And I guess there's also this Commodore 64 thing that Aaron has planned.
7252000	7257000	And who knows who's going to see it from there. So it's it's great anyway.
7257000	7264000	And is it and the first one is on Steam, the waiting page, the page landing pages there.
7264000	7268000	So if you want to go wish list that, that'll help with the algorithms. Oh, smart.
7268000	7276000	But or something like that, tentatively, we're looking at February 3rd, but it may get pushed a little bit.
7276000	7282000	We'll see. I'm just rushing to get mine done. That's kind of what we're waiting on.
7282000	7286000	I think he I think he plans to hit that date. I don't think it's getting bumped back anymore.
7286000	7292000	I mean, I think we're going to it's probably going to be the third.
7292000	7299000	If not, then maybe like a week or so, like not it's been pretty close to the third, I think.
7299000	7305000	Act Defton Chad is saying, so when is President Cat going to be classic game of the week? It's over 10 years old.
7305000	7311000	In my opinion, Jamie has to save that for a very fucking special day.
7311000	7316000	Like it's her segment. Do what you want. But in my opinion, Jamie, that's the one Jamie pulls out.
7316000	7320000	Episode one thousand or the last episode.
7320000	7325000	Oh, well, are inevitably whenever that is, you know, that that's that's the one you save for a rainy day.
7325000	7330000	Jamie, is your thoughts on that president capping classic game of the week?
7330000	7334000	Either that or. I don't know. We'll see.
7334000	7338000	I may have an I may have an idea whenever she damn well feels like it.
7338000	7343000	No one ever helped me with Gwen's thing, so. All right.
7343000	7348000	Maybe maybe it'll be a charity charity giveaway. OK. All right.
7348000	7355000	Let's move on and do some rapid fire news. Let's travel around the world and check out some other news from around the gaming universe.
7355000	7362000	Loki, why don't you start us off? Hey, let's talk about what you're going to get for free with Xbox Live Gold.
7362000	7365000	Yeah, that's one hundred twenty dollars a year. And that's good.
7365000	7374000	So starting in February, we're going to be getting Gears five on Xbox one and Resident Evil.
7374000	7384000	Those are going to be your two Xbox one games. Dandera Trials of Fear Edition and Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb and Lost Planet two.
7384000	7390000	So five games in a month. Not bad. And then, of course,
7390000	7394000	there's lots of fun mods out there for older games.
7394000	7400000	And one of those games being NBA Jam Tournament Edition from nineteen ninety four.
7400000	7408000	So they have a brandy mod that brings the roster of players to current day and they have.
7408000	7414000	So they're calling it NBA Jam 2K21. And there's a lot of new characters that they added.
7414000	7419000	And of course, along with that, a lot of hidden characters that are added to it as well.
7419000	7424000	So, for example, they've got Johnny Cage from Mortal Kombat in there.
7424000	7431000	They have the Flash. There's looks like what we got here.
7431000	7437000	Kevin Hart has been added there. Hulk Hogan.
7437000	7441000	They had Jean-Claude Van Damme in there.
7441000	7448000	Let's try to see some of the other ones that they kind of really stuck out is funny because we were just talking about NBA Jam last week.
7448000	7452000	Yeah. So it's timed right. Yeah.
7452000	7460000	It looks pretty funny. So they've got the whole patch you can download out there and they'll update your game with all these new players and everything.
7460000	7464000	So that's pretty awesome. So go check it out.
7464000	7471000	All right. Let's get into some other news and talk about Puzzle Quest is making a comeback.
7471000	7478000	There's a Puzzle Quest three that actually was announced five or five games because they actually recently acquired Infinity Plus two,
7478000	7482000	which was the studio in Australia that made Puzzle Quest to begin with.
7482000	7486000	They have announced a free to play sequel called Puzzle Quest three.
7486000	7491000	Of course, we hear. Yeah, I know. We hear free to play and it's like, you know, they didn't really do.
7491000	7498000	So there were other puzzle quest games after Puzzle Quest two, but it was free to play like Marvel Puzzle Quest and things like that.
7498000	7504000	Those games weren't necessarily bad per se, but they weren't quite as exciting, I think, as Puzzle Quest one and two.
7504000	7507000	I don't know. I guess it depends what you consider exciting.
7507000	7512000	I liked the whole like single player quest type of elements that one and two brought to the table.
7512000	7515000	So I would like to see that in Puzzle Quest three.
7515000	7523000	But we know very little about it beyond a very vague teaser trailer and the fact that it's supposed to be coming off coming up this year.
7523000	7527000	So by the way, Marvel Puzzle Quest apparently was a licensed spinoff.
7527000	7531000	It wasn't actually from the same studio. So that is kind of interesting.
7531000	7537000	Also worth noting a delay this time. The Uncharted movie delayed again.
7537000	7541000	I'll give you some guesses why with everything going on in the world.
7541000	7549000	But it has been pushed back again to February 11th, 2022, considering I don't even think they've shot a frame of the movie yet.
7549000	7553000	I wouldn't be surprised, quite honestly, if it gets bumped back again,
7553000	7558000	considering everything that Hollywood has been going through with COVID and all that.
7558000	7564000	This isn't particularly surprising, but we'll just wait a little longer for that, honestly.
7564000	7570000	Fine. Maybe February 2022 is when it will be safe for me to go to a movie theater.
7570000	7576000	Even if I still have to wear a mask in the theater, at least I can go and I can watch the damn movie the way I ought to.
7576000	7580000	That would be very nice. So we'll see.
7580000	7583000	All right. Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
7583000	7587000	Well, I'm sorry, just a quick correction. Sorry, chat corrected me.
7587000	7591000	They have been shooting the movie. There are set photos that are out there.
7591000	7594000	I apologize. I didn't think they'd even started shooting it yet.
7594000	7597000	But apparently the post-production is still going to need some extra time.
7597000	7599000	Sorry, Jamie, but that was an important correction.
7599000	7607000	OK, well, I'm sure a lot of people remember Don't Starve. Great game.
7607000	7614000	But the company that made it, is it Clay is how it's pronounced, Clay Entertainment.
7614000	7623000	I think so. Yeah, they were acquired by Tencent and Tencent, as we know, is responsible for League of Legends and Clash of Clans.
7623000	7628000	They acquired a majority stake in Clay Entertainment. Sorry.
7628000	7635000	So and of course, other things that that Clay made, other than Don't Starve, they did Mark of the Ninja as well.
7635000	7641000	But they apparently are still in full autonomy of creative operations, so they should still be in control of their stuff.
7641000	7648000	We'll see what happens with it. And then in other news,
7649000	7658000	Imamura Takaya, who designed Star Fox and Tingle has left Nintendo.
7658000	7664000	Guess we'll never see any Tingle again. That's not true, necessarily.
7664000	7671000	So he he said on his Facebook, it was translated, Today is my last day of coming to work.
7671000	7676000	I took a selfie with the empty office building. It feels pretty sad to think about not coming here anymore.
7676000	7680000	Hats off to myself for 32 years of hard work.
7680000	7690000	So, yeah, he started in 1989 as a graphic artist, designed vehicles and pilots for F-Zero.
7690000	7698000	He designed Captain Falcon. He did the Star Fox franchise, created Fox McCloud and the other characters.
7698000	7703000	And of course, Tingle.
7703000	7710000	I'm going to remember that for the day I retire. Kudos to me. There's more. I made this possible.
7710000	7720000	The general manager of Takara Tomy Arts, Yodo Tomo, said that Imamura will be working with the company as a freelancer.
7720000	7725000	So we'll see. All right. All right.
7725000	7732000	Well, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games that are coming a little sooner than whatever is worked on next.
7732000	7736000	Bye, Imamura. So, Loki.
7736000	7745000	We've got Altair Risa 2, Lost Legends and The Secret Fairy on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

7831000	7833000	That's it.
7833000	7835000	Going over to Japan and checking out the releases there.
7835000	7838000	You know, it's been slow for a couple weeks and they're making up for it this week.
7838000	7840000	It's picking back up again for sure.
7840000	7847000	Over on the Nintendo Switch, March End Forest, Myelin and the Forest Gift comes out this week.
7847000	7856000	Ume Niko When They Cry, Saku, Nikobako to Musou no Kōkyo Ukyoku comes out this week.
7856000	7859000	Pang Adventures is out this week.
7859000	7866000	Alpaca Ball All Stars, I didn't know there was enough Alpaca Ball to make an All Stars, but apparently there is and that is out this week.
7866000	7871000	As is a little game called Disgaea 6, yes the Disgaea series is still around.
7871000	7878000	A Defiance of Destiny is out this week, as is Galgun Returns, all of that on the Nintendo Switch.
7878000	7881000	Taking a look at the PlayStation 5, nothing this week.
7881000	7884000	They have a new title next week, but nothing this week.
7884000	7887000	But the 4 has many of those same titles.
7887000	7889000	March End Forest, also out on the 4.

7900000	7903000	So things are picking back up again over in Japan.
7903000	7905000	How about the UK, Darusaka?
7905000	7906000	Three things.
7906000	7911000	On the 28th for Switch, Pang Adventures Buster Edition.
7911000	7919000	On the 29th, Anima Arcade Edition for PlayStation and also for PlayStation, Ghost of a Tale Collector's Edition.
7919000	7920000	Alright.
7920000	7923000	On the 29th, sorry.
7923000	7928000	Let's get back into some more news and then we'll get to your topics over in our chat room and our mailbag.
7928000	7931000	But first, more news. Loki.
7931000	7942000	Yeah, so apparently Valve, Capcom and Bethesda have been fined $9.5 million because they were geo blocking PC games on the Steam storefront.
7942000	7950000	So what that basically means is, of course, not allowing folks to purchase games in other regions.
7950000	7957000	So, for example, say the price for a certain game in Germany was cheaper than in Europe.
7957000	7965000	They would disallow them from purchasing it for a lower price, letting them buy the cheaper version of the game.
7965000	7970000	Apparently geo blocking breaches the EU antitrust rules.
7970000	7976000	So they were fined around 6.2 million euro.
7977000	7988000	And apparently the it says because they were the owners of Steam, Valve chose not to cooperate with the commission.
7988000	7991000	They were fined 1.6 million euro as well.
7991000	7992000	Wow.
7992000	7993000	So.
7993000	8001000	Yeah, I don't know if that's going to make any changes, but it sounds like they're just not cooperating with the price of business.
8001000	8003000	Or if they're actually taking it seriously.
8003000	8005000	It sounds like they may just fully not pay.
8005000	8009000	And that could lead to some heck of a consequences.
8009000	8013000	So I I would be interested to see what the follow up to this is going to be like.
8013000	8016000	What's the comment? What's what's the next step here?
8016000	8020000	It sounds like they didn't even try to fight it and take it seriously.
8020000	8041000	Yeah, basically, the executive vice president, Margaret Vester, said such practices deprive European Union consumers the benefit of the EU digital single market and the opportunity to shop around for the most suitable offer in the EU.
8041000	8043000	Yeah, interesting.
8044000	8055000	I don't know. Well, sometimes, you know, if the fine's small enough, they just cost of doing business and they'll keep on doing, especially if they've made more than that kind of money, selling it for a higher price.
8055000	8056000	So we'll see.
8056000	8058000	Yeah, I need to raise those funds.
8058000	8063000	I'll be curious to see what comes from this as well, or if they actually pull out of business in some of those countries.
8063000	8066000	I don't know. I kind of doubt I doubt it goes to that.
8066000	8069000	But it is very interesting that none of these companies kind of took this seriously.
8069000	8077000	And now we're here and they could face getting kicked out of the countries if they don't pony up the money or try better to fight it, I guess.
8077000	8082000	So this is one of those things to keep your eye on. I think this is probably not the last thing we've heard about this for sure.
8082000	8085000	So, yeah, something else I don't think we've seen the last of.
8085000	8091000	I know we have not seen the last of ever people making their own peripherals and devices at home.
8091000	8097000	But I would love if Nintendo actually did something with this one. They won't. They'll cease and desist it if nothing else.
8097000	8105000	But we can dream. This person made a homebrew Labo kit. In other words, they made it out of cardboard.
8105000	8106000	I don't think they really made it.
8106000	8111000	I'm glad someone's actually doing something with that, because I've thrown most of mine away.
8111000	8118000	They didn't do actual Labo. It's like a concept that they made out of cardboard called Labo Fit Adventure.
8118000	8125000	Mike Choi is the guy's name, a hardware hacker. He built the Labo Fit Adventure cart kit.
8125000	8133000	And what happens is that you use a Ring-Con, so the Ring Controller with Ring Fit, to steer and squeeze basically,
8133000	8138000	if you want to kind of go the right direction and I assume use the boost or items.
8138000	8146000	But you also have to pedal a bike, and that's the part that's made out of cardboard, above a certain speed if you want to keep going.
8146000	8149000	So you have to actually pedal to keep the cart moving.
8149000	8158000	It's built around a tap-bow robot that will press Joy-Con buttons when you get signals from the Ring-Con and the bike.
8158000	8163000	Other games technically will work, but it's really built with Mario Kart in mind.
8163000	8167000	There's a whole to-do on the YouTube channel about that.
8167000	8175000	And you know what? I'd love to see Nintendo take this concept into an actual Mario Kart game.
8175000	8181000	Obviously you have to make some concessions for this particular one to work, but as a proof of concept,
8181000	8186000	I know a lot of people are responding very positively to Ring Fit Adventure during this quarantine.
8186000	8190000	I could stand to play a little more of it myself, to be quite honest.
8190000	8197000	But I think these ideas, especially with those bikes, the Peloton, those bikes are getting more and more popular.
8197000	8202000	Like, this is a great thing for Nintendo to try to capitalize on, honestly.
8202000	8204000	Even if it's made out of cardboard, why not?
8204000	8209000	They could do it cheaper than a Peloton, so I think Nintendo should get on it.
8209000	8212000	I think this guy's doing him a favor. We'll see if they really do or not.
8212000	8217000	So, all right. Moving on, Darsagra.
8217000	8222000	So Microsoft filed a very interesting patent, kind of scary.
8222000	8230000	They filed a patent that would let the company digitally revived deceased family and friends
8230000	8235000	using that individual's personal information.
8235000	8242000	So it would create an AI-based chatbot that would be built on that profile that uses their image, their voice data,
8242000	8249000	social media posts, electronic messages, and other personal information to try to recreate that person
8249000	8255000	as a rudimentary, not really rudimentary, but sort of like an AI of sorts.
8255000	8265000	And they even went further saying, use a 2D or 3D model of that person, but that's scary.
8265000	8266000	Yeah.
8266000	8270000	I've never watched Black Mirror, but yeah, it sounds like that episode.
8270000	8273000	That's what Orangewright says in chat. Isn't this a Black Mirror episode?
8273000	8275000	And Pod Culture says, that is fucking scary.
8275000	8280000	Well, yes. I don't think I'm in a hurry to talk to any of my family members in the virtual way.
8280000	8284000	You know, once in a while, not to get like too depressing, but I'm just going to be honest,
8284000	8287000	like once in a while, I like to go to my mom's Facebook page.
8287000	8293000	It's a nice little place in the internet where she posted some things and she has some pictures.
8293000	8299000	So when I want to remember, as much as I loathe Facebook, it is a nice thing for me to go back and look at.
8299000	8300000	Grandmoms.
8300000	8302000	What's that?
8302000	8303000	I go to my grandmoms.
8303000	8309000	Yeah, but I don't want the page to suddenly start posting again like it is her.
8309000	8315000	And that's essentially what this is. You know, in fact, actually, this led to an interesting thing.
8315000	8323000	So my dad will sometimes get on my mom's old laptop, which she's been logged into Facebook for like five years.
8323000	8326000	Hopefully she didn't get logged out the other night like everyone else did apparently.
8326000	8329000	I didn't get logged out, but apparently a ton of people got logged out of Facebook.
8329000	8335000	But my dad and my dad has logged into her Facebook like within the past year.
8335000	8338000	So she'll show online. But it's my dad.
8338000	8342000	But even that you can imagine that makes some people go, what?
8342000	8345000	Like, did the account get hacked? What's going on?
8345000	8351000	So anyway, yeah, I don't want this chat bot to exist for things like that.
8351000	8358000	However, as much as people are sitting here going, this is creepy, this is wrong, this is yikes.
8358000	8362000	What about Tupac performing in a hologram?
8362000	8373000	Like, I realize that's a kind of a different example, but there does seem to be some sort of demand out there for getting closer to deceased people.
8373000	8377000	I just think it's deceased people you don't actually know.
8377000	8379000	And I think that's the key difference.
8379000	8381000	None of you out there know Tupac.
8381000	8388000	And insert any hologram performance here, because I think they've said they were going to do it for others, too.
8388000	8392000	And of course, in the moment, I'm blanking, but they've talked like I think Michael Jackson might have been one of them at one point.
8392000	8396000	They're talking about doing like a hologram thing for and so forth.
8396000	8398000	Gorillas.
8398000	8404000	That's that's different, though, because I know it's different, but I'm saying that it's the same technology.
8404000	8409000	Yes. But but gorillas is actually there behind the hologram actually playing.
8409000	8411000	So it's very yes, it's very different, but you're right.
8411000	8415000	That technology is what led to and Hatsune Miku, if you will.
8415000	8422000	That technology is what led to like Tupac holograms and things like that.
8422000	8424000	So.
8424000	8438000	And and, you know, the one thing, though, that I didn't go in and say any more about this is that it would also it could be used as an educational tool for historical reenactment, I guess, of of a person from way back when.
8438000	8442000	Although that's also going to be kind of iffy.
8442000	8448000	It depends on how recently deceased they are, I guess.
8448000	8463000	Like, what about for those who were before social media existed, where they don't have like such information on that, they only have, you know, like some sound recordings or some.
8464000	8470000	Like hearsay or things that people wrote, but not necessarily what you write always reflects your personality, not always.
8470000	8478000	Can they let some people I know talk to Jesus so Jesus can tell them, that's not what I meant.
8478000	8482000	That's what I'd like to see.
8482000	8486000	Maybe next to do Santa Claus.
8486000	8493000	Well, I they already have a tracker for where is Santa Claus in the world on Christmas Eve?
8493000	8496000	That's a NORAD thing from. Yeah.
8496000	8499000	DJ Rama in chat says there's more to this.
8499000	8502000	Microsoft said this would be for dead historical people, too.
8502000	8505000	And yeah, I can see where I think more people might be interested in that.
8505000	8507000	What I just said. Yeah, it is. It is.
8507000	8510000	But I just want to make sure all the comments are getting through.
8510000	8511000	Well, I can't wait.
8511000	8517000	Like, hopefully it doesn't learn from the people at chats with because I can't wait for like, you know, Abraham Lincoln.
8517000	8521000	They become all of a sudden horribly racist because of the Internet.
8521000	8525000	Well, he actually kind of was.
8525000	8530000	OK, insert non-racist person. Never learn anything about your heroes.
8530000	8533000	Tiger Con chat says, I think this might not go well for some people.
8533000	8540000	Having somebody you know who passed away being brought back in this way has the potential to mess with you mentally as you could break down mentally at how much you miss that person.
8540000	8542000	Yeah, that part.
8542000	8544000	This really isn't for everyone.
8544000	8556000	I think if Microsoft focuses on the historical celebrity side of things, they might have something as interesting as reading your Zodiac in the morning.
8556000	8561000	But that's really I hope something like this is for entertainment purposes only.
8561000	8567000	And that is the end of it. It just seems like a weird thing to be messing with.
8567000	8574000	So Zen Monkey in chat says, when I went to Disneyland, I thought those robot presidents were real people.
8574000	8578000	Hey, they're convincing that Disney robot technology is pretty convincing.
8579000	8586000	Disneyland and World both have it, but Disneyland has that whole Lincoln that steps up and gets out of the chair and gives the speech.
8586000	8590000	That shit looks real. That's real.
8590000	8596000	Well done. And they touch up those animatronics, though, like I think every couple of years.
8596000	8599000	But honestly, it was just the best place to sit when it was so freaking hot outside.
8599000	8602000	Yes. And Disney, no one goes in there.
8602000	8607000	Disney World has that ride where all the presidents are in it.
8607000	8610000	And then I think Lincoln's at the end. But Disneyland doesn't do that.
8610000	8614000	It's just like an auditorium. You go in and it's like all the presidents.
8614000	8617000	Is it all the presidents in the Disneyland one? No, the hall or the hall.
8617000	8620000	Thank you. Yeah, yeah.
8620000	8624000	So and I think there might be some other people there with Lincoln, but it's not everybody.
8624000	8629000	Like it doesn't go through the controversies of, boy, they made Trump look horrible in there.
8629000	8632000	And it's like, well, you know, somebody had it out, I'm sure.
8632000	8639000	Oh, Bobby says Disney World has the current president stand up and give the same speech.
8639000	8643000	It's not Lincoln. It's whoever is currently the president.
8643000	8646000	OK, that's the difference. At Land, it's just always Lincoln.
8646000	8649000	OK, I get it now. All right.
8649000	8656000	One of these days I'll get to Disney World, but very clearly the plan to go this year to ride the new Tron ride is not happening.
8656000	8662000	So it will be whenever I go. What? When you go, I go.
8662000	8667000	It'll be whenever that Tron ride opens. I mean, I heard they stopped construction on it at some point.
8667000	8674000	So, yikes. I, I swear to God, swear to God, if this whole covid thing fucks up that Tron ride for me, I'm going to be so mad.
8674000	8678000	No, I doubt it. Yeah. All right.
8678000	8683000	Bobby says, yay, fog trip, because when Rob goes, I go, oh, my impact.
8683000	8689000	I feel so influential. Thank you. All right. It'll probably be coupled with Dragon Con one of these years.
8689000	8693000	Maybe not the same, but after like Soul or something.
8693000	8700000	They get you I should get you in on the little cosplay group, though, that I'm doing for for Dragon Con, if it happens.
8700000	8705000	Oh, we're all going and we're all going as a layer. Oh, that's cute. OK.
8705000	8710000	Anyway, let's move on. What's next? Loki, I think you're up next. All right.
8710000	8714000	So shocker people staying home.
8714000	8720000	So they spend more on gaming in 2020, but apparently spending is up quite a bit.
8720000	8730000	Almost 57 billion dollars. So fifty six point nine billion was spent on gaming in the year 2020.
8730000	8735000	You can thank the pandemic. You can thank brand new consoles coming out.
8735000	8745000	Apparently, the. Increase, of course, it was hardware increase was up by 35 percent over 2019.
8745000	8754000	And apparently the U.S. gaming industry, which raked in that fifty six point nine billion,
8754000	8760000	which was an increase of twenty seven percent overall over 2019 figures as well.
8760000	8767000	So, yeah. Let's see. And the big games of the year.
8767000	8774000	I don't think they really list anything on here. Of course, last year, Call of Duty, Modern Warfare, Black Ops,
8774000	8781000	Cold War, still doing one of the top selling games of the month of December.
8781000	8790000	Oh, yeah. So big no shock there, you know, expected considering that that was how it was trending all year long.
8790000	8795000	I'm curious to see how 2021 works out, considering that I think things are going to stay about the same,
8795000	8802000	maybe getting better towards the end of the year. I doubt that we're going to see much difference in those numbers being high.
8802000	8808000	Yeah, it also kind of depends like what they're able to get out, because, you know, they got those big consoles at the end of last year.
8808000	8815000	If there's a new switch, if that actually ends up being a thing, then I think we could look at, you know, we're still going to have some big numbers.
8815000	8820000	But otherwise, we are kind of waiting for the end of the year for the big titles to go with the new consoles.
8820000	8828000	We're waiting for the Halo for Xbox X. We're waiting for the Horizon Forbidden West for PlayStation five, which is the assumed big title this holiday.
8828000	8835000	So I you know, that's kind of the big thing. And then if Nintendo puts a new console out on top of that, that'll be a pretty big deal, too.
8835000	8840000	I'm not sure the pandemic changes much of that. I think that stuff's all going to be in demand.
8840000	8846000	And as I think it's been said before many times, the pandemic is probably not going to be something like a switch.
8846000	8849000	It's not just going to be up tomorrow. Everything's back.
8849000	8854000	It's going to be a lot more gradual than that, I think, as more and more people get vaccinated and so forth.
8854000	8861000	It's just unfortunate that some of these things like Disney World and conventions are Disney World, the old way,
8861000	8870000	and convention will be the last in sporting events and major arenas full of people will be the last things to come back.
8870000	8879000	But, you know, I think we'll be at restaurants again and can feel relative safety about it, especially if you've been vaccinated by summer, I would hope.
8879000	8887000	But it just depends on how fast they get those vaccines moving. So anyway, Bobby says in chat, my mom got her first poke on the 20th.
8887000	8893000	Truly, I'm happy. I'm frustrated because my dad is in his 80s and still hasn't had it done.
8893000	8899000	And he's trying, but it's just part of the problems California is having in general.
8899000	8906000	So the fact that they opened it up to 65 and older just makes it even harder for my dad, who would have qualified under 75 and over.
8906000	8913000	However, I am trying to be, you know, non selfish and realize, you know, a lot of people over 65 are at risk.
8913000	8917000	So I just hope they get them out fast, faster, faster, faster.
8917000	8923000	But I feel I feel better about it since Wednesday than I have in a long time.
8923000	8931000	I don't know about some of you, but I feel I feel a lot better. So I'm not trying to get political, but sometimes I can't help it.
8931000	8936000	All right. Moving on.
8936000	8939000	Now, one more story for you guys, and this has to do.
8939000	8945000	Oh, I'm really excited about this because this is an old title coming back for the Nintendo Switch.
8945000	8957000	And this is a good one. A recent rating from the South Korean ratings board indicates that SNK versus Capcom match of the Millennium is on its way to the Nintendo Switch.
8957000	8961000	This was originally a Neo Geo pocket color game in 1999.
8961000	8966000	But of course, it's, you know, the start of a series that eventually brought us.
8966000	8969000	I mean, Capcom SNK was different because it was the other company.
8969000	8977000	But I just I feel like maybe this will be the first little first little snowball in the avalanche that gets us one of my favorite fighting.
8977000	8979000	Probably still my favorite fighting game of all time.
8979000	8983000	Capcom versus SNK, too. But hey, I will take this.
8983000	8986000	I would actually pick this up. SNK versus Capcom.
8986000	8990000	It's been rated by the South Korean ratings board, so it seems like this is certainly incoming.
8990000	8994000	So I love this first comment on this news post.
8994000	8997000	Now we need the best one ever. Capcom versus SNK, too.
8997000	9000000	Comments. Comments are good tonight. What is it? What is it?
9000000	9004000	No, no, no, no. I need Tatsunoko versus Capcom.
9004000	9006000	That's pretty good.
9006000	9009000	You know, they always rumored a sequel and then it never happened.
9009000	9013000	Well, they also said that it was also rumored to be coming out for Switch and that didn't happen.
9013000	9016000	So, yeah, true.
9017000	9019000	Yes, I agree. Why not both?
9019000	9022000	Yeah, why not? Why not? Why not all of the above?
9022000	9024000	All of the above. Correct answer.
9024000	9031000	All right, let's go into the listener roundtable where we take your comments in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
9031000	9034000	If you have any questions for us or comments, we'll get to those.
9034000	9036000	We also like to get to our emails.
9036000	9039000	Participate at orangelandrado.com if you want to send us an email.
9039000	9041000	I don't know if I saw anything in there.
9041000	9048000	However, Darsagra, if that spam email is still in there, you really you really should read it.
9048000	9051000	Just redact anything that's identified there.
9051000	9053000	Yes, it's fucking funny.
9053000	9057000	Well, we did get a real email, so I'll read the spam first.
9057000	9062000	OK, read the spam first, because this you all probably saw it on Twitter.
9062000	9065000	But for those that didn't, I'm sorry, this is fucking funny.
9065000	9066000	So please.
9066000	9072000	I'm waiting for it to load because the mailbox is doing that thing where it wants to take five years to load any of the emails.
9072000	9073000	Oh, no.
9073000	9076000	Yeah, it's just it's just so ridiculous.
9076000	9082000	Like, it'll sometimes be just fine and sometimes it'll be like, oh, I'm going to take forever.
9082000	9085000	Let me get some other comments in chat while we're waiting.
9085000	9089000	Digirama S in chat says we need Namco cross Capcom while we're at it.
9089000	9094000	Didn't that end up being a tactical thing or am I getting my wrong cross on?
9094000	9097000	I thought there was a Namco tactical game that was anyway.
9097000	9099000	They have they have a capcom.
9099000	9100000	I remember I told you.
9100000	9102000	Exxon Crossone.
9102000	9103000	Oh, yeah, that was a project cross on.
9103000	9104000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
9104000	9105000	S.J. one hundred.
9105000	9111000	Matt wants to know what's the status on Jamie getting that arcade one up machine with Strider, who, by the way,
9111000	9116000	I tweeted that clip of Jamie's God dammit moment from the last episode, which is a great clip.
9116000	9122000	You can check it out. Twitter dot com slash O.L.R. Arcade one up liked the tweet.
9122000	9123000	I'm sorry.
9123000	9125000	That made me fucking laugh for like five minutes.
9125000	9130000	And I had to text message Jamie like, guess who saw your God dammit?
9130000	9134000	And and I had to use it to ask for a Polestar and Blazing Star.
9134000	9137000	I know. Of course you did.
9137000	9141000	So it so the email finally loaded.
9141000	9148000	I just found your podcast, Orange Lounge Radio, and wanted to reach out to say welcome to the podcasting world.
9149000	9155000	I've been a podcast host for years and wanted to do five things I wish I knew when I started podcasting.
9155000	9161000	These five things will help you avoid some mistakes I made and hopefully help you succeed much faster than I did.
9161000	9164000	Feel free to respond if there's anything I can do to help you out.
9164000	9168000	Have a great day. My reply. Fuck you.
9168000	9170000	You can reply to it.
9170000	9173000	You can. I'm sorry, but we've been doing this for 19 years.
9173000	9175000	Then they'll know we read it.
9175000	9177000	Yeah, my reply.
9177000	9180000	Red receipts come anyway, Rob.
9180000	9184000	Not if you disacknowledged them. But anyway, look, here's the thing.
9184000	9186000	It was fucking funny.
9186000	9189000	I look I'm making fun of this.
9189000	9191000	I mean, I don't want to because I want to walk a fine line here.
9191000	9196000	I don't want to sound like egotistical or know it all just because we've been doing it so long.
9196000	9198000	But I am going to say the right.
9198000	9199000	Yeah, a little bit.
9199000	9209000	But I am going to say what I'm making fun of here is the audacity of this spammer to not even do some basic research to figure out who they were emailing to be like, oh, I've been a podcast host for years.
9209000	9215000	Welcome to podcasting, bitch.
9215000	9220000	We were here before podcasting was even on iTunes when it was still when it was still lemon Potter.
9220000	9223000	OK, so how long have you been?
9223000	9227000	OK, so, yes, I'm going to play that card with a spammer, with a real person.
9227000	9232000	I'm not going to do that, but I thought this might beg a fun question.
9232000	9241000	And because we give the information for free and not making you click to our website full of which I'm sure I didn't click because I didn't want him seeing that I read it.
9241000	9246000	But I'm sure it's full of spam and, you know, banner ads and bullshit.
9246000	9248000	Since we have been doing it as long as we have.
9248000	9251000	What are your five tips?
9251000	9258000	I should say our because I don't expect all one of us can come up with what are our five things we wish we knew when we started.
9258000	9267000	So I so I'm going to one up the spammer is what I'm doing by giving away the information right now from somebody who has the receipts that we've been doing this for 19 years.
9267000	9274000	What are the five things you wish you knew when you started podcasting?
9274000	9279000	And how to make money doing it.
9279000	9284000	Still, still wait figuring that one out.
9284000	9288000	I'll say one. Don't be afraid of change.
9288000	9305000	Because change is going to happen, especially when you're talking about technology, which podcasting is a technology that technology is going to change and sometimes you have to be willing to ride with those changes and that is a call that I have not always gotten right here on
9306000	9308000	OLR. And I've been very open about this.
9308000	9314000	We should have moved to Twitch sooner than we did a lot sooner than we did in the interest of fairness.
9314000	9323000	We did. You may forget or you may not know we we tried the Justin TV thing back in like 2010 2011 and we didn't go back.
9323000	9325000	And in retrospect, we should.
9325000	9330000	And we did that because we changed studios and we didn't think we in retrospect, that was a bad call.
9330000	9337000	We should have kept going with the video and eventually, you know, the rest of the Internet would catch up with us.
9337000	9341000	But I think we should have made the move to Twitch a lot sooner for what we do.
9341000	9345000	And of course, Twitch doesn't work for every podcast, but for what we do, it does.
9345000	9354000	So that would be my general advice is don't be afraid of change and making changes to your show to suit what is going on in the world.
9354000	9356000	So that's another one.
9357000	9359000	Some some comments in chat.
9359000	9363000	Bobby says you make an NES game and sell it to your audience. That's how you make money.
9363000	9369000	Yeah. Branded branded Vogue Network dot com slash shop branded items.
9369000	9374000	It helps. Bobby also says most people don't make money from the podcast itself.
9374000	9379000	They make money from other ventures that are related to the podcast and are marketed to the podcast audience.
9379000	9382000	Yes. Or sponsorships. Yes.
9382000	9390000	Now, I'm going to say I'm going to steal this one from Akdeft just in the way I'm sure this guy's five things list was just copy pasted from somewhere else.
9390000	9393000	I'm going to copy paste what Akdeft says because I agree with it.
9393000	9397000	Don't be discouraged of having a small audience. Bingo.
9397000	9400000	That is absolutely one of the five things you need to know.
9400000	9404000	Some there is going to be some weeks where one person listens.
9404000	9408000	But you know what? One person listened to what you have to say.
9408000	9414000	And if you are doing it to have thousands of listeners or if you're doing it to make money out the gate,
9414000	9422000	I'm here to tell you you're podcasting for the wrong reason and you might want to get out celebrity.
9422000	9426000	And this is why I'm not always a fan of celebrities getting into podcasting.
9426000	9430000	Some of them do it right. Some of them don't do it right.
9430000	9434000	The ones that are motivated by money are not doing it right. And we all know that.
9434000	9439000	And they don't stick around. So anyway, I'm motivated by spite.
9439000	9446000	Jamie, I want to make sure you get a tip in here. So I think we're up to three. What's one of your tips?
9446000	9451000	Learn to grow some thick skin. And I hate that it's necessary.
9451000	9465000	But I've gotten some things that went from laughably misogynist to grossly threatening.
9465000	9473000	You know, and all because I am a female presenting person who has very strong opinions
9473000	9481000	and will say them on the Internet in a community that is typically male dominated,
9481000	9487000	even though we are 50 percent like almost to the number of gamers in the world.
9487000	9491000	And I could probably school some of these little children.
9491000	9499000	So it's. You get the biggest thing to remember is that.
9499000	9503000	These people don't actually know you, they know a version of you that you project,
9503000	9510000	and some people are fortunate enough, I would say, to get to know the real person behind the podcast.
9510000	9516000	You know, and we all do it. I mean, I think to an extent, while we try to be genuine,
9516000	9524000	there's still this sort of. Persona, I guess, that we evoke when we're when we're podcasting,
9525000	9532000	you know, whether it's voice projection or trying to stay, you know.
9532000	9538000	I'm trying to try to think of like trying to keep our demeanor a certain way.
9538000	9542000	I mean, I certainly am a lot more ranty on this show, I think. I don't know.
9542000	9553000	I'm pretty ranty anyway, but I will, I think, say things that maybe be a little bit less tactful on the show for the sake
9553000	9558000	of getting an idea of cross, you know, it's it's.
9558000	9564000	Would this be a conversation that I would have with just I mean, a lot of us, we have had these conversations,
9564000	9569000	so that that part's legit, and I really think that I try to be as real as possible,
9569000	9575000	but there are some things, a part of a persona that you still have to project to protect the private self that you are.
9575000	9578000	Right. Does that make sense? Oh, absolutely.
9578000	9583000	Like when I like when I go out as a sister, I've got my my face on.
9583000	9590000	I have my habit on. I have my veil, you know, dressed cute in a really freaking weird way.
9590000	9596000	But that persona, it's still me.
9596000	9602000	I still care about the people I work with, but it's going to be a more boisterous, outgoing version of myself.
9602000	9607000	Same with doing the show when I'm in person with people.
9607000	9611000	I think I go through my quiet periods where it's just a little bit too much.
9611000	9619000	You know what I mean? Well, you know this because you know me and a lot of you guys on here have have talked to me on Twitter and everything.
9619000	9627000	But I think that there needs to be a part of yourself that you're always going to keep private and not publish as much.
9627000	9636000	And so when you do that, you have to understand that some of the feedback that's coming back isn't on who you are at the core of your person.
9636000	9648000	But who the persona that you've projected is, who the people that others see is like that philosophy that there's there's like the three things that make you who you are.
9648000	9652000	One of them is how you see yourself. The other is how other people see you. And the truth is somewhere in between.
9652000	9658000	Yeah. And that goes back to the whole perception thing that I talked about. It doesn't matter what the facts are. It matters perception.
9658000	9662000	And that's true of a lot of things, a lot of things in this world.
9662000	9673000	Well, and of course, the other thing, too, and they're saying a lot in in in chat here is that if you love doing podcasting, don't look at it as your job.
9673000	9684000	Yeah. It's not you're not going to make money on this right away. Like, you know, my little well, I'm I've got my my blog that I'm putting together.
9684000	9693000	I actually put it on hold for very personal reasons. And I'm glad it's not my job or else I would be you know, I would be starving by now.
9693000	9704000	But I've had health concerns come up, you know, and the big thing is that on the show, I think that we're we're very much don't let them see you sweat.
9704000	9710000	But let them hear you roar.
9710000	9718000	I like that. And I just to go back to your main point, you know, where that all started about the whole like, you know, you have to have a thick skin to do this.
9718000	9726000	I do agree. I would say with that, though, like you're going to have to be aware there's always going to be haters and there's a couple of ways you can take that.
9726000	9733000	You can take it. I love this saying that Ronnie, my one of my friends gave me and he was on a reality TV show once he was portrayed as the villain.
9733000	9737000	He was not he did not get a very nice edit when the whole thing was said and done.
9737000	9743000	And he had plenty of share of his haters when it was done. And he gave me this quote that I've always held on to and I love it.
9743000	9749000	And the quote is, let haters be your motivators. And I think that's, you know, one way you can kind of do it.
9749000	9761000	But I told you I'm motivated by spite. Yeah, I know. But there is, you know, and as much as I love that quote, I will say I you and this is this is a very difficult skill.
9761000	9765000	I refuse to respond to haters.
9765000	9771000	And it's easier said than done, because sometimes you want to go to these haters and you want to.
9771000	9777000	You've all seen that Jay and Silent Bob movie, right, where they they critique the movie online and Jay wants to go right.
9777000	9781000	Fuck you, you fucking fuck. You are the ball lickers and that whole thing, right?
9781000	9786000	You are the ones who are the ball lickers. That was that was the whole thing, like responding to an angry thing.
9786000	9796000	And you want to do that. But I'm not going to waste time responding to haters because I got such more out of it.
9796000	9804000	That 15 minutes we spent earlier tonight talking about some of these issues that matter to us and you guys going, wow, I'm loving this.
9804000	9813000	This is a teachable thing for me. Please go off. Pre go off, sis. Preach Ted Talk that that that is that is the reward I get for doing this show.
9813000	9818000	I don't get that if I spend 15 minutes telling a hater why they're an idiot.
9818000	9822000	OK, so as much as I understand, RuPaul says some stupid shit.
9822000	9831000	Sometimes RuPaul got famous because either she or somebody is ghostwriting some amazing phrases for her and one of the best of all time.
9831000	9835000	And it is unless they're paying your bills, pay them bitches.
9835000	9842000	No mind. And that that is it. You know, I completely understand if you have issues with RuPaul because she puts her foot in her mouth a lot.
9842000	9846000	But that one tracking you can you can take that to the bank and cash it.
9846000	9850000	That is a that is a very true to life quote. Absolutely.
9850000	9853000	What other people think of you is none of your business. Yes.
9853000	9858000	So and that and that's my thing. I don't respond to haters. I'm not going to I'm not going to waste my time with you.
9858000	9862000	Now, there's a difference between feedback and hate.
9862000	9867000	But you'll notice when people come into our chat and unfortunately, because we are on Twitch, it does happen.
9867000	9874000	You get people that come into chat and word and word, F word, fancy ass guy word, if you know what I mean.
9874000	9878000	You know, those types of words we don't tolerate. It's the policy of the moderator team.
9878000	9882000	Take out the trash immediately. And that's what they do. And you know what?
9882000	9886000	What we do here on air? We don't we don't say a goddamn thing about it.
9886000	9892000	That's why I love the moderator teams. They're there to take out the trash before it starts to smell.
9892000	9898000	Now, I do like I do like a little bit of trolling sometimes, a little bit of trolling. Mostly I save it for my own my own Twitter.
9898000	9903000	Yes. On your own time. Yes, you do. Yes.
9903000	9909000	But I don't do anything of the sort like on the the feedback places.
9909000	9916000	None of that. I'll give people like a little bit of shit, you know, like if it's, you know, good natured ribbing, there's a different story.
9917000	9922000	But I mean, I don't have time for any of that. Their opinion means nothing to me.
9922000	9925000	Yeah, they don't know who I am. They don't know who any of us really are.
9925000	9928000	They haven't been with us through the whole ride. Yeah.
9928000	9935000	You know, if they were if they've been with us from the beginning and suddenly just like, OK, I'm completely done.
9935000	9939000	I'm fed up. I don't like who you are anymore. You know.
9939000	9945000	Honestly, I kind of still if it was like a friend, I would be like, OK, well, why do you feel this way? What happened?
9945000	9952000	You know, but if it's just like some person who listened to an episode and then decided to take a shit all over the iTunes reviews.
9952000	9955000	Yeah. I don't care. I really don't.
9955000	9960000	And, you know, like like again, there's a difference between feedback and haters.
9960000	9968000	Like if somebody comes to me and says, Rob, last week's episode was really like it was not great to listen to because like Jamie's audio was really low compared to you.
9968000	9972000	And like something weird is going on there. What? No, I'm just I'm making something.
9972000	9976000	I'm going to go, oh, shit, was it? Oh, my gosh. OK, I need to look into that.
9976000	9980000	Sorry about that. Like, thanks for sticking with it, though. You know, and I like, OK, I need to listen to that.
9980000	9983000	Like, shit, something's wrong. So I'm going to see what's going on there.
9983000	9991000	But if somebody comes to me and says. Sends an anonymous email from an account going, you should fire Jamie because she's a bitch and no one likes her.
9991000	9995000	And this happened early on in the early years ago in the show. You know, the sandwich thing.
9995000	10002000	Yeah, whatever. She'd get back and sandwich me. I'm just going to be like, delete trash block because that's what it is.
10002000	10009000	It's trash. And so, you know, where trash goes, the trash bin.
10009000	10012000	And that's how I feel about it. And you wouldn't.
10012000	10023000	Well, I'll tell you, it's actually pretty funny is was telling my mom whenever she would want to talk about the tyrant and I'd be like, oh, mom, how's everything in your food disposal going?
10023000	10030000	What's at the bottom of your trash can? Like, well, why are you asking that? Because I feel the same way when you bring that up to me.
10030000	10035000	But it's the same thing. It's it's so beneath any of us.
10035000	10039000	They're trying to get a rise and they're just not important enough to get it anyway.
10039000	10044000	OK, that was four tips. But you know what? It was enough material to be like 20.
10044000	10047000	So there you go on the house. All right. Let's get to the other email, though.
10047000	10053000	I was too much time spent on a spam email, but it was too good. I had to I had to get that out. All right.
10053000	10058000	It was it was potential. It had potential. Evening, everyone.
10058000	10065000	I had planned to send a detailed email about my gaming predictions, but instead I have another question instead.
10065000	10071000	Ron Chan. Proofread.
10071000	10074000	He tried it. He was trying to get in before the buzzer. Cut him some slack.
10074000	10079000	What are your what are your favorite DDR beatmania pop music songs to play and listen to?
10079000	10084000	I recently realized that I haven't played any big money games because the pandemic and I actually miss it.
10084000	10087000	That's all. Keep it chill. Y'all run my heart.
10087000	10094000	I know what Facebook post inspired this because I almost replied to it. So thank you for sending it over here.
10094000	10097000	Can you say the actual question? What songs do you miss or what was your favorite?
10097000	10102000	I'm sorry. I miss favorites. Your favorite. Oh, Nick, please.
10102000	10110000	Not so quick from DDR third mix and just pretty much anything erotic in general because it was so stupid, fluffy, dumb.
10110000	10113000	And that's what DDR music should be. That's when it's great.
10113000	10122000	Like I just that was my favorite stuff was the just idiotic Europop songs that I adore to this day.
10122000	10127000	It was my favorite to play for a very long time, just because I like the song.
10127000	10131000	But I love the the the.
10131000	10136000	Bass stuff, I can remember a DDR solo solo bass.
10136000	10146000	Yeah, I like for Beatmania, I still kind of giggle it three to one stars.
10146000	10150000	I still like.
10150000	10153000	God, why can't I think of the song now?
10153000	10156000	I will just say quickly, sorry.
10156000	10160000	Busy. Beatmania 2D. Oh, Jack and Mark get busy.
10160000	10163000	I remembered Mark and then I was like, who's the other guy?
10163000	10166000	Beatmania 2DX, my favorites by far.
10166000	10169000	I always played as a warm up song, The Beauty of Silence.
10169000	10172000	I loved that song when there was an eighth style machine over skinny.
10172000	10176000	But my favorite 2DX song of all time is Flotation by Vincent D'Amore.
10176000	10179000	I remember.
10179000	10182000	When I would play with Jessica.
10182000	10187000	And we would do all the Orange Lounge ones and try to perfect score them, remember?
10187000	10192000	Yeah, yeah. And we did three in a row, as I recall.
10192000	10195000	Good times. Yeah, that was always pretty fun.
10195000	10197000	But.
10197000	10204000	I really am a big fan of of this style.
10204000	10206000	Just has some really good stuff.
10206000	10209000	And as for pop and music.
10209000	10213000	I always start with the same song every fucking time at the machine has it.
10213000	10215000	The gachamanota.
10215000	10218000	The theme to gachaman. And I sing with it and you have witnessed this.
10218000	10220000	Oh, yeah.
10220000	10223000	Da da da da da da da da da da.
10223000	10227000	Yeah, I know the fucking song at this point.
10227000	10230000	The first three lines are da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.
10230000	10232000	Who is it? Who is it? Who is it?
10232000	10235000	All right, Loki, you got to answer this, too.
10235000	10240000	Let's see. So probably, you know, DDR, I was playing mostly extreme.
10240000	10246000	So I like DTR, Dance Dance Revolution.
10246000	10250000	Fantasy from Max 2.
10250000	10253000	Yeah, Max 2 Fantasy.
10253000	10260000	When I got my machine with all the songs and then moving on from fifth mix.
10260000	10262000	Fifth mix was so underrated.
10262000	10268000	From Max, you know, been more back when we were playing fourth,
10268000	10273000	probably rock beat and dynamite rave and stomp to my beat.
10273000	10276000	And I don't know.
10276000	10279000	We used to play a lot of those fours and fives because that's back when we were like learning that stuff.
10279000	10286000	So any song from Ultra Mix 2, any song from Ultra Mix 2 when they did the different drum music.
10286000	10290000	Like that's how I discovered Echo Image was Skulk and just, oh, my God.
10290000	10295000	That was such a like those Xbox DDR games did not get the credit they deserved.
10295000	10300000	I can't believe that I left out like my favorite Bimani song of all time.
10300000	10303000	Brilliant to you. Orchestra groove. I knew it.
10303000	10307000	I was like, why didn't she say it to you? All right.
10307000	10310000	Second mix was so good and so underrated.
10310000	10314000	All right. Anyway, we could do a whole three hour show just on this discussion alone.
10314000	10318000	And we have. So but thank you for the email.
10318000	10322000	Appreciate that. And yeah, I appreciate the comment a minute ago.
10322000	10323000	I think it was as you wonder.
10323000	10329000	Matt said, y'all are stellar for turning a troll spam email into a heartfelt, awesome discussion.
10329000	10334000	Thank you. I, I felt there was a good discussion in that email.
10334000	10337000	That's why I insisted Jamie read it anyway.
10337000	10340000	And thanks to solo two thousand ninety drugs.
10340000	10345000	So. OK.
10345000	10350000	That OK. What, Loki? Only one person in chat is going to understand why that's funny.
10350000	10355000	Loki just did a throwback to the very first news story we ever covered on our.
10355000	10360000	And that was that some. Girl, adult, I don't know,
10360000	10368000	some person, some individual was taking issue with some of the imagery and DDR solo saying it promoted drug use.
10368000	10374000	And so I think we spent three hours talking about all the drugs we've done because of DDR.
10374000	10378000	How about all the drugs I've done as a result of playing DDR?
10378000	10385000	All right. Painkillers, lidocaine patches, marijuana takes.
10385000	10391000	Oh, no, I'm I'm old and broken enough for the prescriptions, Rob.
10391000	10394000	All right. I think we need to get to moving to wrapping things up here.
10394000	10400000	It's it's getting to be after nine o'clock here on the West Coast, so I know we got to wrap up the show.
10400000	10407000	But thank you so much for the emails. Please send us more. Participate at orange lounge radio dot com is the place to send us emails.
10407000	10413000	Let's quickly see if there's any last minute stories. Loki at our soccer. I'll check in with you guys.
10413000	10419000	Not really. There wasn't anything worth noting, I guess.
10419000	10423000	OK, sorry, I have a Mr. Smoosh in the studio and sadly he's on ground level.
10423000	10430000	I'm trying to get him up, but he's looking at the camera like I want to knock that over and I'm like, the fuck you will, buddy.
10430000	10435000	All right. Now he's now he's looking at his other dad in the kitchen prepping dinner.
10435000	10441000	All right. Oh, Midna's on a diet. Oh, really? Midna gained a pound.
10441000	10447000	Oh, I know somebody else who's a pound overweight, but
10447000	10454000	she's supposed to be right around 12 and she's at 13 and she's going to be eight years old this year.
10454000	10460000	So she's kind of an old lady. So she's got to watch her waistline.
10460000	10466000	Well, we had to take our cat to the vet because she was all stuffed up and super congested.
10466000	10470000	And so they gave her medicine for that. But she's that's Mr. Smoosh every day.
10470000	10475000	And they're just like, that's just a cat. So I've been trying to get her fattened up.
10475000	10479000	Well, Midna, Midna actually has to take human allergy medicine.
10479000	10484000	I forgot what it's called, but it's I have to put a pill in her half a pill in her mouth every morning.
10484000	10489000	And she's like, OK, feed me. You must appease me, human.
10489000	10494000	All right. Our children, our fur babies, babies. All right. Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10494000	10499000	The show's been running on a long time. We have a few people in chatter like I'm going to bed.
10499000	10503000	I'll check out the rest of the podcast. Let's wrap it up and get final thoughts.

10568000	10575000	Let's get to our actual final thoughts. I will start tonight by saying, did you all notice that I'm wearing a pillow?
10575000	10580000	You guys, Loki and Jamie can't really see me, but the listeners can.
10580000	10588000	So I'm wearing a T-shirt that says Fever Time, so I'm throwing it back pre DDR tonight.
10588000	10594000	And I missed this game an awful lot. Bust a move or bust a groove, depending on where you played your games, where your games came from.
10594000	10601000	So I'm going to just give a shout out to that legendary series is my final thought.
10601000	10607000	Loki, I'll go to you. Your final thought. I forgot to mention this week when I was developing my game, I made a dog.
10607000	10612000	Well, we have dogs now that eat poop, so that's an accomplishment for this week.
10612000	10617000	Congratulations. Last but not least, Star Soccer, your final thought.
10617000	10623000	So I found the story when we posted after Shermy died.
10623000	10632000	Because we were talking about how old Midna is and Shermy died October 2012.
10632000	10638000	Oh, wow. So in Midna, I got her right after that.
10638000	10645000	Yeah, so 2013. So, yeah, she's she was nine months old when I got her.
10645000	10648000	She turned one around my birthday and she's going to be a nine year old.
10648000	10652000	Ron and I were talking about it. Time flies.
10652000	10655000	She used to sit on our feet. Mm hmm.
10655000	10660000	I'll never forget when we were talking about the tester, that Sony reality show,
10660000	10665000	and Shermy just decides to crap on the floor and left her own review of the show.
10665000	10669000	And I that forever to this day will slay me. Yeah.
10669000	10674000	All right. Well, you know, that one of the last things she did before she died was poop in Dan's shoe.
10674000	10677000	Yes. All right. Let's let's yes.
10677000	10681000	Let's let's think back fondly and remember our kitty friends that have left us.
10681000	10685000	But let's also let's also look forward to a great gaming week.
