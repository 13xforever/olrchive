0	17680	And it looks really interesting, stay tuned to hear details about that.
17680	21080	But after the show, if you're wanting a more fast-paced, arcade-style baseball game
21080	25520	that does exist, look for a means of playing Super Baseball 2020 or Baseball Stars 2.
25520	28280	Those have been my favorites for decades.
28280	29840	This is one story you'll hear tonight.
29840	33800	This and plenty more is coming from your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki right
33800	36840	now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
36840	45280	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
45280	47200	where every gamer has a voice.
47200	55960	It is Orange Lounge Radio Live once again, back in the house, episode number 854 for
55960	60960	this January the 31st of 2021, the last day of January.
60960	68200	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you from our studio in Sacramento, California, sadly still
68200	73680	socially distancing because it's still March 2020 for a lot of us.
73680	78320	And joining me via the magic of Discord, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
78320	79320	What's up?
79320	80320	Hi, how are you?
80320	82200	I'm all right.
82200	84200	Nice wig.
84200	85920	Thank you.
85920	87760	It's a lace front, Rob.
87760	88760	Lace.
88760	89760	Real lace.
89760	93600	Unfortunately, the podcast folks can't see that sometimes you decide to dress up a little
93600	96960	bit for the show, which, you know, it's all there you go.
96960	97960	There you go.
97960	98960	Yes.
98960	99960	Yes.
99960	100960	Make love to the camera.
100960	101960	Okay.
101960	102960	Perfect.
102960	106840	I decided that I had been feeling kind of crappy all day, so I was gonna glam up just
106840	107840	a little bit.
107840	115360	So I am wearing the lovely eyeshadow palette by our local queen, Sasha Devereaux, who is
115760	116760	talented and amazing.
116760	117760	Look her up.
117760	118760	She's she's awesome.
118760	120080	And her palette is really good.
120080	122480	I'm not being paid to say this.
122480	126880	And I said once we can get back together in person at some point, I said maybe we could
126880	130960	do like a charity fundraiser for something where if we make like, I don't know, a hundred
130960	133680	bucks, 200 bucks, we'll figure out something fair.
133680	136680	I said the DarkSakura could do my makeup for a show.
136680	139640	So you're gonna be a bearded queen.
139640	140640	So look forward.
140640	141640	Please look forward to that.
141640	144800	Once COVID is over, that'll be our official COVID is over party.
144800	145800	All right.
145800	146800	Right.
146800	148200	Anyway, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.
148200	150320	Hey, how's it going?
150320	151320	Hey, good, Loki.
151320	153320	How are you doing?
153320	154320	Doing pretty good.
154320	155320	Yeah.
155320	156320	Busy.
156320	157320	Yeah.
157320	158320	Yeah.
158320	159320	I can't tell.
159320	160320	What is that game playing behind you tonight?
160320	161320	I can't read the dialogue from here.
161320	162320	I can't see.
162320	165640	Well, it just relates to this week.
165640	166640	Okay.
166640	170520	It is the indie RPG game called To the Moon.
170520	171520	Oh.
172400	173400	I love that game.
173400	174400	Yeah.
174400	175400	That is such a sweet game.
175400	176400	Okay.
176400	177400	I see what you...
177400	178400	Okay.
178400	179400	To the Moon.
179400	180400	I see what you did there.
180400	181400	Okay.
181400	182400	Okay.
182400	183400	It took me a minute.
183400	184400	Yeah.
184400	185400	No, but that is, it is a good game for an entirely different reason than what you're
185400	186720	referring to here.
186720	191240	But all right, Loki, if you're going to open that can of worms, why don't we get into our
191240	195760	kickoff topic right off the bat and talk about what's going on, which, okay, I'm gonna be
195760	199240	fair because it's funny because Bobby kind of addressed this on his show too, because
199240	202600	we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the
202600	207320	Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, V-O-G Network, right after the Bobby
207320	208320	Black Wolf show.
208320	213600	And if you are live with us on Sunday night, stop by our chat room because we do like to
213600	215520	read comments from chat.
215520	219120	So we're on right after the Bobby Black Wolf show and Bobby on his show was kind of like,
219120	223140	I'm not really going to talk about it because it's not really gaming news and actually do
223140	224800	kind of agree to an extent.
224800	230280	Like this story has now far eclipsed what is just gaming news.
230280	234520	However, the reason why I think it still qualifies for discussion here and merits discussion
234520	240360	is because I think there's definitely an element of gaming culture that went into this and
240360	245680	why people felt the need to save this particular stock.
245680	249480	But I'll let Loki take it from here, even though it is a follow up to last week, kind
249480	252280	of, but it just, it went to the moon this week.
252760	261900	Yeah, so basically what's happening is there is these hedge funds that have shorted GameStop
261900	262900	stock.
262900	268380	So what shorting means is basically in traditional stocks, when you go long, it means you're
268380	271080	betting on stock is going to raise in price.
271080	273280	So you buy low and you sell high.
273280	276240	Well, short is basically the opposite.
276240	282920	So you buy, you borrow a stock from somebody, you sell it immediately in the hopes that
282920	288560	it goes down and then you buy it again low and return the stock that you borrowed.
288560	292680	And then you make the money based off the amount that the stock dropped.
292680	299360	Well, what happened was is that these hedge funds did what's almost called like a naked
299360	302760	short where they overshorted the stock 140%.
303600	308800	Now you're wondering how the hell do you sell more stocks than exist?
308800	316320	It's because that they're basically, you know, hedge fund A, you know, has a stock and hedge
316320	322400	fund B borrows that stock and then immediately sells it to hedge fund C, which then borrows,
322400	326120	you know, hedge fund D borrows it from C, you know, it's so keeps going.
326120	331120	So you end up getting these multiples and what they do that for is to drop the value
331120	332120	of the stock.
332120	336840	So they will buy up a lot of these, they'll short them and you to a great extent to drop
336840	343240	the price of the stock down to make money and then sell it once it goes low.
343240	348000	I did address this a little bit last week using turnips as an example, just as a reminder,
348000	352760	because this is where we all learned about the stonks this year.
352760	355560	Actually, I learned about it in high school.
355560	356560	Well, okay.
356560	357560	We played the stock market.
358000	362160	But did you, did you actually, and I think a lot of economics classes probably did the
362160	368760	fake stock market, but I don't know a lot of people who have put their own money in
368760	369760	the stock market.
369760	373720	I'm talking outside of 401ks and things that kind of like retirement plans do free do for
373720	374720	you.
374720	375720	I've invested.
375720	376720	Yeah.
376720	377720	Yeah.
377720	378720	Yeah.
378720	380320	I invested in the place in which I work.
380320	381320	Okay.
381320	387520	Well, there's a lot of, there's a lot of people who have not had any experience with any of
387520	390520	that until like animal crossing.
390520	395680	I think really like kind of started getting people like, oh, you know, and I think everybody
395680	400000	kind of knew like, oh, it's a cute little play on the stock market.
400000	401000	What's happening there.
401000	403920	But you know, then this started happening.
403920	408360	And now that everybody is having to like, okay, somebody, why the fuck do I keep hearing
408360	409960	about GameStop in the news?
409960	411260	What the hell is going on?
411260	416320	So many people have had to like, and I'm going to use this term, dumb it down.
416320	418040	And believe me, there's a lot in my life.
418040	419960	I've needed to make it accessible, dumb down.
419960	420960	Okay, sure.
420960	421960	Make it accessible.
421960	422960	Explain it to me.
422960	423960	Like I'm five.
423960	424960	That whole thing.
424960	425960	Right.
425960	429960	So there's been so many people having to explain this, what's going on to people.
429960	430960	Yeah.
430960	435960	So basically what's happening now is so like you would rent a game from blockbuster back
435960	438240	in the day.
438240	441160	Eventually that game is due back.
441160	447360	And so what happens is, is if, for example, you have a community like wall street bets
447360	452360	that sees, Hey, look at this stock is short at 140%.
452360	456920	They're going to have to buy that one, you know, eventually to recoup those socks to
456920	458480	return them.
458480	462080	We're just going to purchase a bunch of these stocks and drive the price high.
462080	465960	So what that does is because they're shorting it and the only way they make money is if
465960	471140	it drops in price, they could lose an infinite amount of money because they have to buy it
471140	472660	at some point.
472660	477040	And so what the goal is now is there's so many people buying the stock, it's driving
477040	481180	the price up much, much, much higher than they anticipated.
481180	487180	So these hedge funds are losing billions of dollars and everybody's making quite a bit
487180	492420	of money off of it because these shares, which were originally like, you know, four or $5
492420	496340	each are now $400, $500 each.
496340	500100	And so, I mean, that's a quite, quite the return on investment.
500100	504100	And so what happened, what's happening now though, is because there's no shares to really
504100	505100	buy back.
505100	507780	And even when they do buy it back, I think it's going to drive the price up a little
507780	511740	bit is they have, it's called a short squeeze.
511740	514460	And so really it's just going to skyrocket the stock.
514460	515660	That's why everybody's holding it.
515660	517740	They're not selling their positions.
517740	521440	And so it's just going to keep driving the price up and up and up and up.
521440	526460	And so this week you saw a lot of bullshit with like Robinhood preventing people from
526460	528600	actually buying stock.
528600	532600	There was, you know, they were only allowing you to sell it.
532600	539080	They were different brokers that were basically limiting the amount of trades you can do.
539080	545280	And it was one of those rare things that like politicians on all sides of the spectrum agreed
545280	551640	on was that that, that move that Robinhood pulled was sus as hell basically.
551640	557680	And that led to a whole Twitch stream that AOC did, right, Monday night or something
557680	559960	where she was, and I don't even think she was playing a game.
559960	560960	I missed it.
560960	563900	Sorry, I had a conflict, but I don't even think she was playing a game this time.
563900	568520	I think she went on, she just did like a talking, she had guests and things like that.
568520	571480	But she just kind of had a talk about it, which was interesting.
571480	577000	And then of course, I'm sure you all saw, you know, Ted Cruz tried to agree with her
577000	581920	and then in response AOC definitely like snatched his fucking wig and threw it in the garbage.
581920	583760	But I think he kind of deserved it.
583760	585240	But anyway, I won't go there.
585240	591880	But still, you had people on both sides that were both saying, you know, Robinhood, what
591880	592960	they did was sus.
592960	596240	And there's all sorts of market manipulation going on.
596240	600600	You know, obviously, there's different CNBC has been, you know, accusing the folks on
600600	606420	Wall Street bets of manipulating the market, not even really calling out the hedge funds
606420	607800	that are over shorting it.
607800	613440	And then on top of that, they've been, you know, conveying fake information.
613440	618840	So they've been saying that these hedge funds have already settled their shares, which you
618840	621920	can look at the data and see, no, that's not the case.
621920	626300	So they're trying to put it out there that, oh, yeah, yeah, they've already bought their
626300	627300	shares back.
627300	628300	You guys won.
628300	631160	You can sell your stock now trying to drive the price down.
631160	633800	But it's so manipulative.
633800	637440	It does make you think and, you know, I'm kind of watching chat and I want to get to
637440	638440	some of that stuff in chat.
638440	640400	But I got two things I want to address here real quick.
640400	643120	And then, Loki, if you have anything else you want to add.
643120	646400	The first thing I want to address is, well, how is this still relevant to gaming?
646400	648800	You know that you're a video game podcast, Orange Launch Radio.
648800	650200	Why are you still talking about this?
650200	653880	Because this is just this just tangentially involves GameStop at this point.
653880	658880	And I would argue, I think it was gaming culture that actually played into this whole thing
658880	662800	and allowed it to happen because, like you said, there was this Reddit community that
662800	668200	observed that there was this trend that was happening on Wall Street of this stock shorting.
668200	673120	And, you know, the rumor came through or the buzz or the tip that some of the hedge funds
673120	675800	were going to be doing this with GameStop stock.
675800	682920	I almost want to say stonk instinctively now, but GameStop stonk, stock, God.
682920	684200	They were going to be doing it with that.
684200	687560	And that was the point where there were several people on Reddit and it was that, you know,
687560	691800	kind of pebble that started the avalanche that said, no, you're not going to do this
691800	694280	to my company, my childhood.
694280	696960	You know, for better or for worse, when it comes to GameStop.
697040	700440	I've certainly had my fair share of criticism about them in the past.
700440	703040	They've done a lot of weird shit, you know, over the years.
703040	708320	But I can also recognize, you know, they have really been kind of stepping on it in the
708320	711160	past year to really try to turn shit around.
711160	715000	Hence the Reggie Fils-Aime on the board story we had not that long ago.
715000	717240	And then we had this guy from Chewy, right?
717240	718720	He was like the CEO or something.
718720	723960	I'm sorry, I might be misstating positions, but he and that was that was the big story.
723960	726680	He put his own money into it.
726760	730120	And that was the thing that Reddit kind of tailgated with.
730120	731120	Right.
731120	734440	So why they're going to make reasons why they believe in the stock.
734440	736920	It's not just, oh, it's because it's over shorted.
736920	738160	They don't really like the company.
738160	744600	It's that they they legitimately think that, you know, it's a decent stock and that's undervalued.
744600	747120	And so that's why they were investing in it.
747120	752120	And a lot of these folks, you know, like, for example, the guy that kind of led the
752120	758640	charge, I guess, who goes by the username Deep Fucking Value, he he actually invested
758640	759640	back in 2019.
759640	763520	He's actually been talking about it for, you know, a while now.
763520	765560	So this isn't like a brand new thing.
765560	771320	Oh, so the best story I've seen on this whole thing, the best is that there was this kid
771320	773440	like seven or eight years old, maybe 10.
773440	778200	So I don't remember the age, but I remember reading he got as a Kwanzaa gift.
778200	785160	His aunt bought him 10 shares of GameStop stock like a year or two ago when he graduated
785160	788480	elementary school or something, I don't know, some type of like, you know, and it was a
788480	793320	cute thing, because, you know, because GameStop stock back then was like five, six bucks.
793320	794320	Right.
794320	796920	My grandma always got me a savings bond every Christmas, every birthday.
796920	797920	Right.
797920	800660	That was her little like, I'm going to teach you about investment.
800660	805240	But for this family, the the answer, whoever it was, I'm sorry, I don't have the article
805240	810200	in front of me, bought 10 shares of GameStop stock, which at the time was not worth that
810200	811200	much.
811200	812240	It was six dollars a share, maybe.
812240	817600	So the kid gets like and the kid gets informational pamphlets about GameStop and all this stuff.
817600	821440	And now it was just in the news when GameStop hit like three hundred fifty dollars this
821440	825620	week or whatever it was, they were like, OK, maybe, you know, they let the kid decide,
825620	827860	but the kid decided to sell.
827860	829520	And, you know, that's great news.
829520	833800	You love to see a 10 year old make three thousand dollars and learn about the stock market in
833800	834800	the process.
835360	839880	And the cool thing was they took two thousand to do something about like paying for school
839880	840880	and some of that.
840880	844120	But they're going to take the other thousand and reinvest as a family.
844120	848680	And I thought that was a neat little like family learns how to play the stock market
848680	849680	type of story.
849680	850680	It was really touching.
850680	851680	I think.
851680	852680	Yeah.
852680	855600	And there's been a lot of these like kind of different people investing in it as well
855600	861800	and taking the money that they've made from that and, you know, paying for consoles for
861800	867080	hospitals and buying stuff for first responders and stuff like that.
867080	872080	So, you know, and stories of people being able to raise enough money to pay for surgeries
872080	877300	and health care, whatever the case may be, paying off their student loans, buying a house,
877300	881320	you know, just, you know, stuff that is like night and day for them.
881320	882880	It's changed their life.
882880	885700	So it's pretty incredible.
885700	891320	This isn't the only stock to the AMC was another one that they've been doing with Blackberry
891840	892840	on.
892840	893840	I don't remember the other one.
893840	894840	Nokia was another one.
894840	896140	I think Nokia.
896140	898440	So there's been several that they've been doing this with.
898440	902880	And it's just it's kind of ironic, though, that you see these billionaires now, you know,
902880	905040	complaining, oh, you guys are manipulating the market.
905040	909000	It's like they were doing the same thing.
909000	915360	There's like some some old video clips online of whether the guy that's behind that show
915360	921300	Mad Money or whatever, talking about how he he used to be with a hedge fund and how the
921300	927020	manipulated stock prices and stuff by like literally passing off fake news to like different
927020	929620	outlets and stuff to get people scared.
929620	930620	Can we talk about that?
930620	935380	Because this is where the chat is going, because another thing that really pushed this GameStop
935380	940020	stock thing that really kind of pushed it forward was, you know, whether you love the
940020	943140	guy or hate the guy, Elon Musk tweeted about it.
943140	944540	And he's got a lot of followers.
944540	948660	He has a lot of influence, especially when it comes to finances.
948660	951260	And he's tweeted about this multiple times.
951260	955300	And he tweeted about the Dogecoin thing, which is a whole other that really is outside of
955300	956300	gaming news.
956300	959540	But it's it's kind of like that whole Dogecoin thing.
959540	964140	The most I'll say about that is that it is showing that this GameStop thing is not the
964140	965660	end of it.
965660	967980	This is going to be something that continues.
967980	968980	How long it continues?
968980	969980	I don't know.
969980	975020	But anyway, my point is and the reason why Elon Musk, assumably, maybe gets involved
975020	976020	in this whole thing.
976020	979300	What does he give a shit about GameStop about all this, besides maybe that he's invested
979300	980300	his own money?
980340	981340	Yeah.
981340	985260	But do you know another very popular company with the short sellers that they love to short
985260	986660	sell the stock with?
986660	988300	It's Tesla.
988300	993180	So I'm sure Elon Musk is looking at these guys going, fuck those guys, because they
993180	994180	fuck with me.
994180	995420	And then we saw it in chat.
995420	997700	They're talking about, you know, Bobby, there's.
997700	998700	Go ahead.
998700	1004220	Well, I'm just saying that this is a big show that basically this is all being manipulated
1004220	1006060	behind closed doors.
1006060	1009780	And people shouldn't, you know, go back, going back to another statement that the stock
1009780	1012940	market is not indicative of the economy, really.
1012940	1013940	Right.
1013940	1017900	But it makes you think, going back to the whole like fake story thing, you know, how
1017900	1023940	hard has they've tried to push that narrative about the Tesla autopilot is like a murderous
1023940	1027860	rampage car out of hell type of thing going on?
1027860	1029660	You know, I mean, sure.
1029660	1032880	It sounds like there's, you know, some issues, but I don't.
1032880	1035980	It's one of those things where it seems like this, you know, and again, it's Christine.
1035980	1040380	Where, you know, Bobby is actually shown the opposite to be true with his video over
1040380	1041380	the VOG Network, YouTube.
1041380	1045020	No, I think it might be on his personal YouTube, but whatever the wherever it is, it actually
1045020	1051100	shows like how autopilot actually saved him in an accident, you know.
1051100	1057940	So my point is it makes you stop and think all of these stories about the narrative behind
1057940	1059780	companies about Tesla.
1059780	1068980	And here's how this is gaming news, folks, are the negative stories behind GameStop fake?
1068980	1070680	That's what this is all leading to now.
1070680	1073660	You know, where there's where there's smoke, there's fire.
1073660	1075300	And y'all have set foot in a GameStop.
1075300	1083020	I would I wouldn't say it's all fake, but yeah, how much of it how much of it has maybe
1083020	1086380	been blown up a little bit.
1086380	1087380	It makes you wonder.
1087980	1093060	Well, the other thing, too, you have folks that are still like they're absolutely pissed
1093060	1098740	about, you know, the last economic crisis they were in from 2008 where the stock market
1098740	1104980	crashed and, you know, how the government bailed out these, you know, banks and everything
1104980	1109380	and how literally you have the people, you know, on Wall Street, these hedge fund folks,
1109380	1114180	you know, celebrating with champagne while the Occupy Wall Street folks were down below,
1114180	1115820	you know, protesting everything.
1115860	1118620	So now a lot of these people, it's like this is personal.
1118620	1119620	I'm buying the stock.
1119620	1123180	I don't care if it goes to zero, if it means that these hedge funds are going to lose millions
1123180	1125900	of dollars, it's worth the price of admission.
1125900	1128900	So a lot of these folks are just, you know, investing because of that.
1128900	1132460	They're like, I don't care if I lose, you know, what it really to them.
1132460	1137100	I mean, the amount that they're investing, there's a finite amount that you can lose
1137100	1138100	there.
1138100	1142020	It's, you know, whatever you invested in, whereas the shorts, there is no cap for that.
1142020	1143980	They can keep going.
1144020	1149020	So the longer they hold onto it, the more that they lose and the higher it goes.
1149020	1150020	Yeah.
1150020	1155180	Uh, anything you want to add to this, Jamie, what you, from what you're watching and seeing?
1155180	1156940	Not, not really.
1156940	1162380	I mean, there's, I'm still in kind of this wait and see mode right now, you know, just
1162380	1166460	because it is, I mean, we've been talking about this yet for two weeks, but it's still
1166460	1167500	in early stages.
1167500	1170940	I think, I think that there's going to be a lot that comes out of the woodwork and I
1170940	1175620	know a lot of, you know, the news that we consume is manipulated.
1175620	1180300	I mean, I always tell people that if you're going to look at one news source, look at
1180300	1187100	five others, including one that is, uh, an opposing source, you know, it's like, I tell
1187100	1191740	my mother, you know, okay, link me all this red new stuff, but I want you to also go and
1191740	1193180	read all this other stuff too.
1193180	1198100	You know, you have to be able to see the big picture and don't necessarily look to American
1198100	1199100	news sources.
1199100	1200100	Just saying.
1200100	1201100	Oh, sorry.
1201100	1202100	Go ahead.
1202100	1209300	Well, just, just that, um, the biggest thing about it is that go into this with your eyes
1209300	1211300	open.
1211300	1215220	Don't expect all of the truth to come out.
1215220	1218840	It's they're going to try, you know, things go really sour on this.
1218840	1225380	They're going to try to sweep it under, um, it's just another, another sign that the,
1225380	1231060	the stock market is inherently, uh, a corrupt establishment.
1231060	1232060	Hmm.
1232060	1236020	Um, I want to read some of these comments about the Tesla thing that Bobby is saying
1236020	1237020	in our chat.
1237020	1241260	Cause it is very interesting about, you know, uh, how much is the news, you know, altered
1241260	1242260	perhaps.
1242260	1243540	Um, Bobby is, he's saying a lot in chat.
1243540	1244980	I'm just going to read some of the comments.
1244980	1250500	Um, the video I made on YouTube actually got a lot of press with the shorts, mostly calling
1250500	1252220	me a dumb ass fan boy.
1252220	1256860	There were rebuttals on auto websites and calls for me to have my driver's license revoked.
1256860	1258500	It was wild.
1258500	1263540	And so, because Bobby was trying to say something good about, yeah, because Bobby was saying
1263540	1268980	something good about, but it also shows that just like that hyperactivity of the internet
1268980	1274020	in general, when it comes to everything, when it comes to politics, when it comes to gaming,
1274020	1278940	fuck, look at the replies to any Xbox or Sony post.
1278940	1285300	The first couple of replies are always like, fuck Xbox, Sony's better or fuck Sony, Microsoft's
1285300	1286300	better.
1286300	1289740	And like, shut up.
1289740	1294820	Like I, I can't believe I'm saying this because this is the show where every gamer has a voice,
1294820	1299060	but like gamers of a certain maturity level.
1299060	1303380	I think I'm getting to the point where it's like, I am not interested in hearing from
1303380	1307340	these people on Twitter because I don't think they're actually gamers, but that's a whole
1307340	1309820	nother, I guess, debate.
1309820	1310820	You know.
1310820	1315300	I still think that we have an unspoken caveat with every gamer.
1315300	1320900	I'd say there's definitely, we don't have room for hateful voices here.
1320900	1321900	Yes, absolutely.
1321900	1322900	Yeah.
1322900	1325940	There is a little bit of a caveat there and there always has been, and if you don't like
1325940	1326940	it, tough.
1326940	1327940	Get my ass.
1327940	1330420	Don't, you might have rabies.
1330420	1332660	Bobby continues, they're too busy bitching about games.
1332660	1334740	They have no time left to play games.
1334740	1337460	Fifth Dream says we're non-toxic gamers have a voice.
1337460	1338460	Yes.
1338460	1339460	There's that.
1339460	1342500	Questbuster says, I'm only surprised that what happened with GameStop didn't happen
1342500	1343500	sooner.
1343500	1346500	That is interesting that it kind of like took this long and I don't know if it's something
1346500	1351140	about the pandemic or if it's just something about, you know, again, people's childhood
1351140	1355560	and GameStop in particular or what it is, but I guess it was just this perfect storm
1355560	1357220	that allowed this to happen now.
1357220	1363100	I'm going to admit, and maybe I shouldn't talk about this on OLR, but I will, I didn't
1363100	1369020	get into the whole GameStop thing because I kind of felt like it's probably too late.
1369020	1370360	Like that's just my own personal opinion.
1370360	1375580	Like I kind of feel like late if I went, did you invest in the GameStop thing?
1375580	1376580	Loki?
1376580	1377580	Not yet.
1377580	1381140	Um, Monday I will though, because my account, like it takes a long time for everything.
1381140	1385820	Um, I was able to get in on AMC because you can do that through cash app actually.
1385820	1390020	So you can open an account through cash app, transfer stuff almost immediately and you
1390020	1391020	can buy certain stocks.
1391020	1395460	They don't have GameStop on there, which is unfortunate if I did AMC and I'm up a little
1395460	1396460	bit there.
1396460	1401460	Um, I plan on getting in on Doge as well on Monday, um, just for the hell of it.
1401460	1403640	I got a Dogecoin somewhere.
1403640	1406500	Because if you think about like, I didn't really, you shouldn't, I should have done
1406500	1411860	it a long time ago, but like really it's like a fret back when it was like a fraction of
1411860	1412860	a penny.
1412860	1414300	It's like, it can really only go up.
1414300	1416820	I mean, it's just, it is very volatile.
1416820	1418980	It's going up and down, but you just buy sell.
1418980	1423080	I mean, I don't know, this is more interesting for me, like considering that, like when the
1423080	1428020	lottery was up to a billion dollars, like I can, I can remember how many lottery tickets
1428020	1432380	I bought each week that came, I'm like, damn, I could just put that money into the stock
1432380	1433380	market.
1433380	1436500	At least that's a little bit more, you know, that's it.
1436500	1440420	And by the way, you have chatters that are advising you against the Doge thing, but you
1440420	1441420	know, make your own decision.
1441420	1445620	But I didn't really finish my thought, but I will say, uh, I did not get into the stock
1445620	1446620	thing.
1446620	1449020	I got into the first cryptocurrency this week and it was not Doge.
1449020	1450260	It was different one.
1450260	1453980	Um, but I, you know, I made my own, I kind of did my own research and made my own decision.
1453980	1457940	I didn't spend a lot, but it was, it's just, it's exactly Loki's reasoning right there
1457940	1463980	that, that's 50 bucks right now, it's because they're blocking people from buying it right
1463980	1464980	now.
1464980	1469620	The apps that used to like Robinhood, another app that you can buy Doge in, they block people
1469620	1472660	from buying Doge right now.
1472660	1476060	And a lot of, I know AMC is down a little bit as well.
1476060	1481980	But once again, I don't invest money that I don't expect to lose if, if it, if we lose
1481980	1482980	it, we lose it.
1482980	1483980	You know, that was my thing.
1483980	1484980	That's the point.
1484980	1489900	I put in 50 bucks, which would have been my Reno gambling money in a, in a normal world.
1489900	1491540	You know, I'm not putting in a ton of money.
1491540	1493180	I know better than that.
1493180	1498100	I'm just saying it's, it's money that like, it's not going to make a, it's no big deal
1498100	1499420	if I lose it.
1499420	1500420	Yeah.
1500420	1505420	And Bobby and Chats says, yeah, I'm considering learning about the stock market in the same
1505420	1506820	way I go to a casino.
1506820	1511140	I set aside money and I say, I will never see this money again and use that.
1511140	1513280	And Quest Buster says, Loki is investing right.
1513280	1516200	Don't invest in anything that you can't afford to lose.
1516200	1519660	And so Jamie, you're saying, I don't want to lose anything, so I'm just not playing
1519660	1520660	this game.
1520660	1521660	And that's fine too.
1521660	1528300	I know, I know that, that mine is invested in a very stable business that is not losing
1528300	1534860	money in most of its markets, that has split several times in the last few years and the
1534860	1537940	value has of course gone up incredibly.
1537940	1543220	So yeah, I'm pretty happy and, and for the record, I do all of my buying and selling
1543220	1544220	through E-Trade.
1544220	1545660	So yeah.
1545660	1549500	And I have, I've used one of those micro investing apps.
1549500	1552060	I'm not going to give them a free ad, but basically it's one of those apps where you
1552060	1555420	put a little bit of money into it and they, it's a little bit more of a traditional like
1555420	1557180	stock portfolio type of thing.
1557180	1562060	But again, that's money that would have been extra Starbucks trips during the workday that
1562060	1563960	I'm not doing right now.
1563960	1564960	So there's that.
1564960	1570720	And yeah, I have a 401k and I've had one for a while, so.
1570720	1575720	Like Bobby was saying, there's companies that also pay dividends, which mine is set up that
1575720	1576720	way.
1576720	1580600	And my dividends get reinvested into the same stock.
1580600	1584000	I mean, I could put it in something else if I wanted to, or I could cash that out if I
1584000	1585480	wanted to.
1585480	1593320	But I'll tell you what, you know, having that money there from my payouts has been, it saved
1593320	1596760	our tail a couple of times, you know, when we needed that money and we made sure that
1596760	1600920	we, you know, and the thing is, is that the company, as I said before, it's the company
1600920	1604080	I work at, which no one gets to know.
1604080	1610040	But because it's so stable and performing so well, I can basically say, okay, I need
1610040	1614900	three grand for this and I can go in there and get that three grand and it will have
1614900	1618920	refilled itself in three to six months.
1618920	1620320	So or replaced itself.
1620320	1626040	Well, I mean, I will say this, too, about all this story and everything is that I think,
1626040	1630200	you know, through this whole experience, and I think video games are to credit in part
1630200	1631200	for this.
1631200	1634680	Yes, we all learned about the stock market and economics in high school, but how much
1634680	1639800	did we really get practical knowledge and use it until the year we were all stuck at
1639800	1643460	home and had to play Animal Crossing because there was nothing else to do?
1643460	1645600	And which honestly, it hasn't ended.
1645600	1649080	I mean, I realize some parts of the country people think it has, but it hasn't.
1649440	1651920	The lights at the end of the tunnel, we're not there yet.
1651920	1656360	But I almost wonder how much of that kind of enabled some of this.
1656360	1661560	And now with this all over and this getting meme-ified all over Twitter, all over Facebook,
1661560	1665140	all over social media, I really think we're moving towards something where you're going
1665140	1670220	to see more common people that are investing in the stock market through these apps and
1670220	1674160	things that let you kind of cherry pick what you want to do.
1674160	1678760	I think it's and I think video games are a big part of that.
1679120	1680120	They really are.
1680120	1681320	So, yeah.
1681320	1687280	So when I was in my economics class, we had to do that stock market thing, create portfolio.
1687280	1692320	So I spent all my money on penny stocks and then they doubled in price and I made a ton
1692320	1693320	of money.
1693320	1695880	So I'm doing the same thing.
1695880	1696880	You know what we did?
1696880	1697880	Good luck.
1697880	1698880	What did you do?
1698880	1708400	We invested in Intel in 94 and in a funeral home and I'll tell you why.
1709040	1712760	Keep in mind, this is Jamie the Goth and the funeral home was my idea.
1712760	1719920	It was like a company of funeral homes, like a franchise, but kind of.
1719920	1724280	I was like, look, people die every day.
1724280	1726400	They're always going to have business.
1726400	1732840	I've never seen a funeral home, at least any type of related chain, a funeral home ever
1732840	1734680	go out of business.
1735200	1739880	I don't want to be disgusting, but you can't help but notice, especially with this past
1739880	1741720	year and everything that's happened.
1741720	1745840	Like if you owned a lot of those stocks, you're probably doing pretty well.
1745840	1750520	Or if you were in the government and bought in on like, was it, I think there was some
1750520	1752920	of the PPE and body bags and stuff like that.
1752920	1756800	They were investing in that because they knew that the numbers were going to go up.
1756800	1757960	I mean, it's gross.
1757960	1759680	I'm sorry, but that's the reality.
1760240	1765480	Anyway, I always half wondered if the tyrant had investments in that, and that's why we
1765480	1772600	never had a lot of our, any good legislation on it, but that was a little conspiracy of mine.
1772600	1776600	If only we could actually investigate those types of things, but anyhow, we won't go there.
1778680	1781760	Anyway, I'm looking forward to the eighth and I'll leave it at that.
1783600	1788080	So anything else we want to say about the stonks and all that, and that goes for you
1788080	1789080	guys in chat as well.
1789120	1792840	Yeah, Bobby's saying, I should have invested in zoom a year ago.
1792840	1797560	I don't think they had their IPO yet at that time, but certainly comparable companies,
1797560	1800560	WebEx, you know, Cisco.
1800560	1806080	One thing I need to repeat what Bobby said, because this is very important, is that we
1806080	1809440	are not financial advisors.
1809440	1812360	We don't do any of that.
1812360	1814040	You know, that's not what we do.
1814040	1815040	We're not giving legal advice.
1815040	1816920	We're not giving financial advice.
1816920	1819840	So do what you will with what we say.
1819840	1822920	This is our opinion on the matter.
1822920	1829080	You know, so again, do what you will with what we've shared with you, with our experiences
1829080	1834880	on it, but certainly educate yourself completely before you dive into something like this.
1834880	1836400	Just don't do it on a whim.
1836400	1837400	Yeah.
1837400	1841200	It's sad that we need that disclaimer, but I understand why completely.
1841200	1842520	So I would hope all that's obvious.
1842520	1844760	Yes, of course we are not financial advisors.
1844760	1849280	We're just, we're just schmoes in our basement, but, um, so are all the people that are starting
1849280	1851200	a wall street revolution right now.
1851200	1852200	So congrats.
1852200	1854040	Let's just be honest.
1854040	1859040	Like I, like the whole reason I played a lot of, cause I know it's like an insanely, no
1859040	1862360	way you're going to win any of that stuff, but like, I'm just like at that point right
1862360	1866320	now with my job and everything, like, I just don't want to do it anymore.
1866320	1869640	I just don't want to do work anymore.
1869640	1872720	My mom always said, my mom always said it costs a dollar to dream.
1872720	1873720	So go get the lotto ticket.
1873720	1880000	And so like at this point, like I just want to have an active, like just something that
1880000	1882120	I'm doing to try to make things better.
1882120	1883120	Like I get it.
1883120	1888300	Like, yeah, you could lose some money on stuff, but if you do, like, if you just be careful
1888300	1893540	with what you're doing and you don't try to overextend yourself, then maybe you can make
1893540	1895520	some small gains here and there and stuff.
1895520	1898120	And maybe you do get lucky with some of this stuff.
1898120	1901880	It's ironic because I actually thought about investing in GameStop a while back because
1901880	1905680	I was like, well, maybe I should throw some money in the stock market because my 401k
1905680	1908920	portfolio is not doing that, you know, hot, you know, why not?
1908920	1910760	And their stock's pretty cheap.
1910760	1914680	So should have done that, but oh, well, what are you going to do?
1914680	1915680	Yeah.
1915680	1917160	All right.
1917160	1918720	Let's go ahead and move on.
1918720	1923000	Let's talk about other things that we escape to when we don't want to work anymore.
1923000	1924280	And that is video games.
1924280	1926600	So let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks.
1926600	1928160	So dark soccer, I'll start with you.
1928160	1929280	How was your gaming week?
1929680	1932400	Well, lots of Animal Crossing, duh.
1932400	1938640	I also got Cyber Shadow, which is sort of like a Revenge of the Ninja by the same folks
1938640	1941560	that did Shovel Knight.
1941560	1949740	It definitely has that same kind of feel to it, but it's definitely, definitely a little
1949740	1951860	bit of a pissy game.
1951860	1958760	You know, there's some cheap kills in there, but your save points are pretty, I'd say pretty
1958760	1960640	well spread apart.
1960640	1963260	The fights for the bosses are fairly interesting.
1963260	1969740	It's got some very cool mechanics and some bonuses in there.
1969740	1971640	The story is pretty okay so far.
1971640	1974480	Dan, of course, has been playing it a lot more than I have.
1974480	1977840	So it's sort of like if I start playing a game and then I sit down to watch Dan play
1977840	1981400	it, it's like, oh, I won't play anymore, you know?
1981400	1983040	But it's a really good game.
1983040	1984040	Absolutely worth checking out.
1984040	1990720	20 bucks on Switch right now on electronic download.
1990720	1991960	And so there's a pretty rich been it.
1991960	1998560	I'm still playing Boardscapes, which, you know, it's just a good waste of time.
1998560	2005020	So about it, I'm actually been going back and looking at Saturn games.
2005020	2011400	There's this thing that's kind of like an EverDrive for Saturn where you, I think you
2011400	2016920	switch it out in part for the graphic card port on the back of it.
2016920	2022080	And then you load ROMs on it like you would in EverDrive.
2022080	2023960	I have to look it up again.
2023960	2028060	It's like 200 bucks.
2028060	2032960	But I'm kind of thinking about it because we have a lot of Saturn games and of course
2032960	2035840	I don't want anything to happen to them.
2035840	2040740	But it also means that I can play translated versions of games that I own that I've never
2040740	2044840	finished because my reading comprehension level in Japanese was not great.
2044840	2052260	So if I find the name of it again, I'll link it in chat, but we've been watching a lot
2052260	2054560	of like Saturn reviews and things like that.
2054560	2057220	So that's really where it stuck into my head.
2057220	2058220	Just throwing that out there.
2058220	2061300	It's not really what I'm playing, but what I have in mind to play.
2061300	2062300	All right.
2062300	2063300	All right.
2063300	2065300	Oh, and I did play Pirates of the Caribbean pinball.
2065300	2066300	So I did play some pinball.
2066300	2068300	Did you get one of those in your house?
2068300	2069300	Yeah.
2069300	2070300	One of the Jersey Jack ones.
2070860	2071860	Oh, nice.
2072860	2073860	It's in Dan's office.
2073860	2074860	Wow.
2074860	2076580	How many machines do you have in your house right now?
2076580	2077580	In the house?
2077580	2080700	Physically in the house, four.
2080700	2083740	And then another six or seven in the garage.
2083740	2085980	I think we still own like 15.
2085980	2087300	I consider that part of the house.
2087300	2088300	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2088300	2091100	Well, I'm just trying to think about it legitimately.
2091100	2095460	Like my world cup is off at Dan's friends to be shopped.
2095460	2098300	We just got back shadow.
2098300	2103300	So yeah, Dan put that in the hallway, which completely annoys me, but whatever.
2103300	2109660	Yeah, we've loaned out a few and we have a few and there's some that I really wish I
2109660	2115340	could get rid of because I don't like them and I want money.
2115340	2118900	Actually the thing is, is that I'm really ready to like get rid of about four tables
2118900	2121580	and move the ones that are in the house outside.
2121580	2126420	Like maybe keep theater of magic in the house, but that's about it.
2126420	2129700	Theater and world cup should stay in the house forever because they're my babies.
2129700	2133320	You know, would it be fair to say, I mean, I know you kind of said that you don't do
2133320	2137540	a lot with stock or cryptocurrency outside of your one preferred stock, but would it
2137540	2141100	be fair to say that maybe where you do invest money is pinball tables?
2141100	2146420	I mean, cause you kind of take them in, make them better, trade them, flip them, whatever.
2146420	2149260	I mean, it's kind of what you're doing a little bit.
2149260	2150260	Yeah.
2150260	2154100	It's not really necessary for hobby, for fun, not for money, I guess.
2154100	2159100	It's like the restoration business, you know, and, and the values of things go up and down.
2159100	2169000	That's really just going to be not, not stock, not really like stocks, but just more of knowing
2169000	2170000	your market.
2170000	2172660	We, you know, try to have the best thing that's out on the market.
2172660	2178680	I guess it's very rudimentary capitalism where you take your, your product or in, or in some
2178680	2182340	cases, you know, the components of a product, put it together into your product and then
2182340	2183340	you sell it.
2183340	2187780	Or, you know, people who flip houses, that's the same thing.
2187780	2191660	Buy them cheap, fix them cheap, sell them high.
2191660	2192660	Car flipping.
2192660	2193660	There's people who do that.
2193660	2197420	My, one of my exes used to do that with seventies Oldsmobiles.
2197420	2198420	Yep.
2198420	2208260	Now, if he can find me a 1970 422, then I'm down for that, but the thing is, is that with
2208260	2214820	our network for, for a pinball is that we do have the ability to say, I don't have this,
2214820	2216540	but I know who does.
2216540	2218900	And we kind of scratch each other's backs in the community.
2218900	2225240	I mean, there are some really cutthroat people, but for the most part, it's more of a, a community
2225240	2226240	level thing.
2226240	2231900	You know, if we've put in work to it, but a good buddy is like, Hey, you know, I really
2231900	2234260	been looking for, I'm going to throw something out.
2234260	2238620	I've really been looking for doctor who, and I see yours is in really great shape.
2238620	2240220	I know you just shopped it.
2240220	2245080	We can say, well, you're a good guy and there's a chance we'll get it back from you.
2245080	2248180	So we'll sell it to you for, for what we paid for it.
2248180	2253980	Plus the repairs, you know, and not make a profit on it, but we know we have a chance
2253980	2254980	of playing that again.
2254980	2256380	Cause it's at someone's house.
2256380	2261060	So it's really more like community oriented.
2261060	2267860	It's not quite the same, but it's similar enough to, yeah, Dan wouldn't let me sell
2267860	2274740	my doctor who sorry, Bobby, um, to see a Tiberian chat says Jamie flipping tables, kinda literally.
2274740	2279660	I mean, in a way I, Hey look, one day, one day I will have my baby Pac-Man table one
2279660	2283020	day, but step, step, small steps.
2283020	2288020	One day, if we are going to sell that table, I am going to insist that it be to you.
2288020	2289020	Okay.
2289020	2290420	All right.
2290420	2291420	We got to move on though.
2291420	2294740	We could, we could do a whole podcast on pinball table, uh, um, maintenance.
2294740	2297940	I'm kind of surprised Jamie doesn't have one, but maybe someday, uh, but for now let's move
2297940	2298940	on with other,
2298940	2299940	I'm not good at that.
2299940	2300940	Dan does that shit.
2300940	2301940	All right.
2301940	2305860	Uh, you, well then you do the production, you get him to be the expert and you're the,
2305860	2306860	you're the host.
2306860	2307860	All right.
2307860	2312100	Um, now, uh, I'll tell you Jack danger does that, uh, already better than I do.
2312100	2313100	So okay.
2313100	2314100	Fair enough.
2314100	2315100	Yeah.
2315100	2316100	All right.
2316100	2317100	Yeah.
2317100	2321020	So go ahead and give some kudos to dead flip podcast and his live stream.
2321020	2323180	You want to watch some good pinball, check out dead flip.
2323180	2324180	All right.
2324180	2325180	They didn't even pay for that spot.
2325180	2326180	All right.
2326180	2327180	Low key.
2327180	2328180	He's a good guy.
2328180	2329180	He helped me decide on Dan's Christmas present.
2329180	2330180	That's fair.
2330180	2331180	Uh, low key.
2331180	2332180	How was your game week?
2332180	2337100	Um, so I didn't play a whole ton because I've been working on my game, so I did play a lot
2337100	2338180	of mobile stuff.
2338180	2345380	So, um, I've been switching between like Pokemon go and Minecraft earth and Orna.
2345380	2348940	Just depending on where I'm at, usually cause I run out of things to do in one of those.
2348940	2353660	And so I switched to the other one, uh, so I've been doing that and then, um, I picked
2353660	2356820	up an, an original NES this week.
2356820	2359260	Um, so that should be coming pretty soon.
2359260	2366360	Uh, so I can test, you know, the games actually burn with my, um, you know, ROM burner.
2366360	2373980	So, uh, you know, game prep prepared for the physical copies of a pixel poops number two.
2374020	2378580	And, uh, yeah, and also we're set to launch on the 10th of February.
2378580	2383300	So just working towards that, just trying to get everything done.
2383300	2388140	Wait, wait, we're set to launch on the 10th of February, meaning your, your NES ROM or
2388140	2389140	like your game.
2389140	2390140	Yeah.
2390140	2397700	So like a pixel poops to, um, the pixel poops on steam and the, the, uh, pixel poop 64 should
2397700	2399100	all be February 10th.
2399100	2401300	Oh, I didn't know you were all aiming for the same day.
2401300	2402300	Okay.
2402300	2403300	Wow.
2403620	2404620	That's amazing.
2404620	2405620	Well, good luck.
2405620	2406620	All right.
2406620	2407620	Couple more weeks.
2407620	2408620	Yeah.
2408620	2412580	I've, I've been playing, um, the beta thanks to Y Y R given those codes in our discord
2412580	2414500	at vog network.com slash discord.
2414500	2416580	Um, and, uh, it's, it's fun.
2416580	2421780	It's it, it has a lot, I mean, for as silly as the name is and the concept and everything,
2421780	2426900	there is something, it really has like that Atari 2,600, like very simple game, but can
2426900	2429820	get very difficult, very fast type of charm to it.
2429820	2432980	Like I didn't even realize that he kind of built something into it where like, once you
2432980	2437820	get a certain score, it gets a lot harder because the there'll be some different types
2437820	2438820	of walking.
2438820	2443860	I don't want to ruin it all, but, uh, it's, uh, yeah, it's, it's, it really invokes a
2443860	2446940	lot of what made those old Atari 2,600 games fun.
2446940	2451900	So, um, check it out, uh, when it hits steam or get on our discord and get the, get the
2451900	2453700	peekaboo a little bit early.
2453700	2454700	All right.
2454700	2459500	Um, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says I didn't get a code because I'm going to buy it instead.
2459500	2462380	I'll, I'll still throw, I think it's actually going to be free to play.
2462420	2465220	I'll still throw money at the DLC or I'll gift it to somebody.
2465220	2467940	That's what I did with the last game that he gave me a code for.
2467940	2471860	I, I just get, I bought it for somebody else that I thought would like it.
2471860	2472900	So, all right.
2472900	2476260	Um, let's see other, uh, stuff for my gaming week.
2476260	2479620	Honestly, I've had kind of a slower week when it comes to games as well.
2479620	2483700	I've been playing a little bit of Pokemon, meaning, uh, shield continuing with the DLC,
2483700	2487780	but also, um, Pokemon go quite a bit, uh, was working.
2487780	2491140	I've done all four weeks of the collection challenge and Pokemon go.
2491180	2493540	So, uh, been doing that and that's fun.
2493540	2499940	Um, and, uh, otherwise, as far as, uh, other games I've been playing Final Fantasy 14 a
2499940	2504580	lot, that's pretty much been most of the bulk of my gaming time, uh, continuing the online
2504580	2505620	adventures there.
2505620	2508740	There's a tiny patch coming on Tuesday.
2508740	2511300	That's going to allow the blue mage job to go up to 70.
2511300	2512260	So that's really exciting.
2512260	2515540	And then they're going to do something called the relic weapon, which is like the, uh, a
2515540	2518740	really fancy, you know, uh, weapon you have to work really hard to get.
2518740	2521300	They're kind of putting another step into that for another upgrade.
2521300	2522580	So that should be fun as well.
2522580	2526420	And then there are big announcements for Final Fantasy 14 on Friday.
2526420	2530740	They're actually doing a big stream where they're going to, uh, assumably unveil the
2530740	2536900	next expansion because we were supposed to have fan fest, uh, in San Diego this year
2536900	2542660	in October, but obviously thanks to, uh, miss Rona, we didn't have that, uh, anything.
2542660	2545860	So this is kind of like the assumed makeup for some of that.
2545860	2547300	So we're getting that on Friday.
2547300	2551220	I really wanted to co-stream it, um, with some of my Final Fantasy buddies.
2551220	2554180	Uh, but we don't know if legally Square is allowing that.
2554180	2559620	So unfortunately we're erring on the side of, um, we'll just watch ourselves and I'll
2559620	2561220	be here to comment on it on Sunday.
2561220	2565620	But if I find out that they allow co-streams of it, then, um, stay tuned to our Twitter,
2565620	2570100	uh, either over at twitter.com slash OLR for the show or twitter.com slash vog network
2570100	2573620	for the network, uh, for any updates and last minute things that are plotted.
2573620	2577620	If I find out that Square does indeed allow the co-streaming of that sort of thing.
2577620	2580580	And if anybody happens to know that in our chat, um, let me know.
2580580	2582740	Cause I'd be very thankful to know that information.
2583460	2584180	All right.
2584180	2586500	Uh, but that's really it for my gaming week otherwise.
2586500	2590980	So let's get into some news and we'll go to Loki for our first story tonight.
2591700	2593700	Yeah, let's talk about Amazon game studios.
2593700	2595460	I haven't really heard too much about them.
2595460	2601380	Um, and apparently the reason why is because they're having some issues.
2601380	2608340	Um, so according to a report by Bloomberg, there's been some serious, um, stuff going
2608340	2612100	on behind the scenes at, uh, Amazon game studio.
2612100	2617380	So right now, um, they had conducted about 30 interviews with former Amazon employees
2618020	2621060	and talked about some of the stuff going on behind the scenes.
2621060	2626180	So for example, they said, uh, the game that they're working on new world, uh, which
2626180	2630660	apparently you play as a colonists in the fictionalized 17th century America.
2631460	2637860	Um, they says the enemy designs born uncomfortable similarity with two native Americans.
2637860	2643700	And after they had hired a tribal consultant, they found that indeed it was offensive.
2644420	2651860	So that, that pushed back the release, uh, from August of 2020 to now some time in the spring.
2652660	2657940	Uh, also you had, you know, courses like bro culture that's going on, which we've heard
2657940	2663540	a lot in different companies, but apparently that's still something that they're, um, dealing
2663540	2664500	with there as well.
2665140	2672500	And apparently following a disagreement with a male employee, uh, of senior leadership,
2672500	2677860	one of the women that was, uh, interviewed, he made up some new position above her and
2677860	2679780	hired men into those roles.
2680340	2686900	Um, apparently the leader of the entire games division has never made a video game before.
2687540	2694020	And he's basically frustrated developers with, um, basic takes and had, they said,
2694020	2697380	troubling differentiating between gameplay and concept footage.
2698180	2704020	Um, they were forcing everybody into that, uh, proprietary lumber yard, uh, program that
2704020	2706420	they had to develop games in.
2706500	2711780	So their game engine, and apparently that was a little bit difficult as well, but now
2711780	2716420	that they have this new guy on board from take two, he's kind of eased that mandate,
2716420	2718260	but that did cause some issues as well.
2718260	2721780	So it's just been kind of, uh, not smooth.
2722420	2727060	Um, so yeah, I don't know.
2728420	2732500	I'm curious to see what, what they come out with, but like right now, I mean, to me, it's
2732500	2738980	almost like stadia where they have like these stadia developed games, but like, where are
2738980	2739460	these?
2739460	2742100	I mean, we haven't really seen anything from them.
2742100	2742500	Yeah.
2742500	2745300	Um, fifth dream in chat says, sounds like a winner all around.
2745300	2747620	And by that, I mean, close Amazon games and give up.
2747620	2751460	Um, quest buster says they hired some top shelf names to work on their products too.
2751460	2753460	And most, if not all of them left.
2753460	2756420	Uh, and then let's see, uh, this is a newer chatter.
2756420	2757860	So welcome a dragon.
2758100	2758260	Summer.
2762260	2765460	It's blue on black on my screen, so I can't even read it, but thank you.
2765460	2770660	Jamie says, um, that lumberyard engine is a disaster too.
2770660	2773060	It was cry engine, but then all torn apart.
2773060	2774420	It's such a shame.
2774420	2779380	So, um, yeah, there's a lot of, uh, issues going on with the Amazon thing and it almost
2779380	2781460	makes you wonder if they're ever going to get a game out.
2781460	2786980	I mean, yes, I know new world is like, but like, like legit, actually like have a game
2787060	2787380	out.
2787380	2791780	It's, uh, doesn't, doesn't seem too promising over there.
2791780	2793380	I didn't have high expectations.
2793940	2794440	Yeah.
2795060	2797220	So womp, womp.
2797220	2797720	All right.
2798260	2802580	Well, another game, I don't think people necessarily had a high, high expectations for this game,
2802580	2805700	but it's interesting to hear that it's doing, uh, well enough.
2805700	2807860	And that is the game, the medium.
2807860	2810980	This seems like a game I want to check this game out because I guess it's supposed to
2810980	2813300	be like a psychological game, but not gross.
2813300	2815780	Like it kind of invokes silent Hill.
2815780	2819860	And, uh, I mean, so far as the fact that Akira Yamaoka does some of the music in it
2819860	2823140	and, uh, Mary Elizabeth McGlynn apparently sings some songs in it.
2823140	2827940	So, I mean, talk about a throwback to silent Hill, but it's the game, but I I'm told do
2827940	2830420	not expect it to be silent Hill or you will be disappointed.
2830420	2833220	So I want to make sure that is appropriately communicated as well.
2833220	2839060	Um, but it is a game called the medium and the medium came out on PC and X-Box and apparently,
2839060	2844500	uh, via an interview with money.pl, which is a Polish website regarding of course, money,
2844500	2850020	uh, the studio who developed, uh, the medium has said it has already made back its money
2850020	2851780	for development and marketing costs.
2851780	2854260	So anything from here out is pure profit.
2854260	2859380	It's, uh, interesting to note that the medium is a day one X-Box game pass game.
2859380	2861300	And this is how a lot of people are discovering it.
2861300	2864580	And I know that's one reason why it's kind of on my radar right now as well as it's like,
2864580	2869220	Oh, it's a psychological kind of thriller game and I don't have to pay extra money for it.
2869220	2872020	Uh, on top of what I'm already paying for game pass.
2872020	2875140	So it's interesting to hear that that is already successful.
2875140	2878980	Some folks are kind of taking that a step further to be like, this is,
2878980	2883380	this is an example of how game pass is successful for a lot of games right now.
2883380	2887060	Um, and so this being more of a fringe title,
2887060	2892420	not sure that people would have dropped $60 to experiment on this game and figure it out.
2892420	2895860	But with game pass, you got a lot more that are willing to take the risk.
2895860	2899060	So it's, it's very interesting to hear that it's been successful.
2899060	2902580	I mean, breaking even the first week sounds pretty successful to me,
2902580	2904340	that it's all going to be profit from here on out,
2904340	2907380	especially if they end up releasing a version on switch.
2907380	2908580	I don't know if that's technically possible,
2908580	2911300	but releasing a version on PlayStation later and who knows what.
2911300	2914500	So, um, by the way, if you weren't already aware,
2914500	2917380	X-Box game pass has 15 million subscribers.
2917380	2919220	So pretty neat.
2919220	2921060	Uh, those of you that are listening live,
2921060	2924500	they have any of you out there checked out the medium.
2924500	2932420	So, um, uh, dragon semi says, uh, medium screams, silent hill and free on game pass.
2932420	2934980	Uh, game pass is nailing it so much right now,
2934980	2938580	other than the X-Box gold price increase the X-Box retracted.
2938580	2940900	Yeah, we talked about that a little bit on last week's show.
2940900	2945780	That was not a great look, but at the end of the day, at least they've retracted.
2945780	2948740	Um, even if they maybe showed their ass a little bit, uh,
2948740	2952180	I think game pass is still the place to be at least for now.
2952180	2954740	We will see what develops over the next year.
2954740	2956900	Are they going to do price increase on game pass?
2956900	2960340	I suppose it's inevitable, but I don't think they can really get away with it
2960340	2964260	until they've got their halo and they've got more of those series X.
2964260	2967300	Um, I don't want to say exclusive cause I know that's not their plan,
2967300	2971860	but series X like focused, I guess games, uh, would really,
2971860	2973940	I think help sell that a little bit.
2974420	2977940	Uh, pod culture says medium is a rare game that is well done.
2977940	2979700	I see what you did there like that.
2979700	2982900	Uh, as John Hunter Matt says, it's on my list of things to try next.
2982900	2984980	I just signed up for game pass.
2984980	2987060	So yeah, I want to check that out as well.
2987060	2989940	Um, I was listening to Bobby cause he's on before us, of course,
2989940	2993540	here at VOG Network and he was talking about a patent that that game has,
2993540	2996340	where I guess apparently you actually control a character
2996340	2997860	in kind of two places at once.
2997860	3001140	Like there's a normal realm and a spirit realm type of thing
3001140	3002340	that you're kind of controlling the character.
3002340	3003780	Sounds like a neat mechanic.
3003780	3005620	So I, uh, I want to check that out.
3005620	3006820	So pretty cool.
3007780	3008340	All right.
3008340	3011300	Uh, let's move on dark Sakura, something that's been getting
3011300	3012500	a lot of buzz this week, right?
3013300	3013860	So yeah.
3013860	3020340	Um, Konami, uh, did, uh, some basic restructuring, um, by dissolving,
3020340	3023300	uh, well, it's, it's announced that it played a dissolve three production
3023300	3026900	divisions to, uh, adapt to the market.
3026900	3030180	Um, and they put this out on the economy's corporate, uh, website,
3030180	3033140	but this made people think that they were going to be shutting down
3033140	3034980	their video game division.
3034980	3036580	And they say, this is not the case.
3037300	3040020	Um, they are very insistent on it.
3040020	3044660	The quote States, the announcement, uh, made refers to an internal
3044660	3047780	restructure with production divisions being consolidated.
3047780	3051860	We have not quote shut down our video game, our video gaming division.
3052500	3054900	So we'll see.
3054900	3058660	I mean, Konami hasn't really been putting out a whole lot in the way
3058660	3059220	of games.
3059220	3063460	I mean, just like metal gear and some reissues of earlier games.
3064180	3070500	Um, the, uh, the only game I think right now in production is PES 2022.
3071460	3074980	Um, and there's rumors of a silent Hill game, but we don't know.
3076180	3077700	I wouldn't hedge a lot of money on that.
3077700	3078980	I'd be very surprised.
3078980	3082820	I think if the Konami, you know, digital thing, you know, for the games
3082820	3085860	division is still around, hopefully, and I really think this is the best
3085860	3086900	case scenario.
3086900	3091060	They're licensing out a lot of their IPs to other companies, hopefully.
3091060	3093940	And I think we also know that in Japan, um, they're still doing, you know,
3093940	3098580	cause this game is rooted in like Bamani stuff and some of those, um, uh,
3098580	3103140	more like evergreen, always services online in Japan that they've been
3103140	3103460	doing.
3103460	3107860	You know, the, the, uh, there's a beat mania 2DX online, Infinitas, whatever
3107860	3108340	is the thing.
3108340	3113060	And they've, they've got, I think sound voltex has one pop music has one.
3113060	3115140	I think a lot of those games kind of have one.
3115140	3118100	So, um, I think that's something they're still invested in as well.
3118180	3120980	So I w I wouldn't look to other companies to develop music games,
3120980	3122020	unfortunately.
3122020	3126500	Um, but I think some of these other ones, I wouldn't you love it if they
3126500	3129300	would let somebody else work on a Castlevania or a silent Hill?
3129300	3129700	I don't know.
3130740	3133940	Well, they had a good shot of good silent Hill game and then fucked them
3133940	3134500	up.
3134500	3135860	Fucked, uh, uh, true.
3137140	3138660	That like words Kojima.
3138660	3140100	Ah, yes.
3140100	3141300	I can't make words happen.
3141300	3142500	They fucked Kojima over.
3143460	3143960	Yeah.
3144760	3148840	So, um, yeah, I wouldn't hold your breath on anything that exciting coming.
3148840	3154840	Um, I maybe some more like retro types of collections, but I don't know.
3154840	3156120	They've been doing already.
3156120	3160040	So like I said, I don't see anything particularly new for the console market
3160040	3161720	and retro can only take you so far.
3161720	3162840	Plus you have to remember a lot.
3162840	3165960	Like let's say they let another developer make a new Castlevania.
3165960	3167560	Oh, here's a game that I played this week.
3167560	3170360	I totally, cause I played it on Sunday after OLR.
3170360	3173720	So I forgot about it during my gaming week, but, uh, bloodstained
3173720	3178360	ritual of the night has that classic mode that I checked out and boy.
3178360	3178840	Oh boy.
3178840	3180120	Is it just Castlevania?
3180120	3184680	The like, it's exactly what it's not even shy about it.
3184680	3186760	It's just like, I'm not even talking about them.
3186760	3189800	I'm talking about the classic mode is like old school Castlevania, like
3189800	3193720	vampire Hunter, like that old school, you know, original game.
3193720	3195720	Uh, and it's, it's fun.
3195720	3196200	It's great.
3196200	3197000	It's well done.
3197000	3201080	But it also really makes you realize like, okay, even if Konami suddenly
3201080	3206360	did another Castlevania game, Igarashi has clearly moved on and is doing his
3206360	3207160	own thing.
3207160	3210040	So the Castlevania you're going to get, it's going to be different.
3210040	3212200	Now different can go both ways.
3212200	3215400	I don't think different actually automatically has to be a negative.
3215400	3218280	Um, unfortunately you look at Konami and you look at some of their
3218280	3222440	choices, um, like the Contra game that came out recently, which honestly,
3222440	3226120	I guess Dark Tetsuya was a fan, but a lot of people I've kind of seen
3226120	3229880	online are like that game was, that was Contra full of choices.
3229880	3233560	Um, and so, you know, it didn't did it up so well.
3233560	3238120	Um, but if they let somebody else do a Castlevania, you know, the right
3238120	3240120	company might actually be able to do it very well.
3240120	3244200	Somebody like, um, the people that have been doing the blaster master reboots
3244200	3245640	have been knocking it out of the park.
3246200	3247640	So why not let them do it?
3247640	3249720	Is that way forward or who's actually developing that?
3250440	3253480	But they're, they're knocking it out of the park, honestly.
3253480	3255240	So, all right.
3255240	3261400	Um, going to our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, uh, Kate
3261400	3266440	Catastrophe asks, which company is worse, Konami or EA?
3266440	3268440	Um, both for different reasons.
3268440	3270120	That's a very hard question.
3270120	3274280	Um, they both have done some, I mean, it's hard.
3274280	3277960	I think it's, it's, or I should say it's easy for me to want to say Konami.
3278600	3280840	Cause I don't really care about the sports games.
3280840	3281400	So whatever.
3281400	3282760	I mean, there is mass effect.
3282760	3284760	So I guess I have that involved with EA.
3285240	3288840	But with Konami, you look at how they've tripped over themselves time and time again.
3288840	3291720	And this show is really rooted in like music games, Maimani and all that.
3291720	3294440	That's, you know, where our name came from and what we talked about for the
3294440	3297240	first couple of years of the show and so on was really that culture.
3297240	3302520	So to see like that whole thing, Konami is really, I mean, I know DDR is still
3302520	3305720	around kinda, and I know it still has a loyal following.
3305720	3309640	I know there's other podcasts that are now doing what we did the first two
3309640	3312280	years of our show where they're talking about like DDR culture, music and
3312280	3313720	culture and stuff, which is great.
3313720	3314840	More props to them.
3314840	3317320	But I just feel like it could have been so much more.
3318680	3320360	It could have been so much more.
3320360	3326040	And I think Guitar Hero and Rockband and that whole, you know, uh, thing that
3326040	3329480	kind of came and went, I think shows that Konami could have done more than
3329480	3332520	just like Rock Revolution, which was their answer to all that at the same time.
3332520	3333480	That was awful.
3333480	3336360	Yeah, but that's, that was their solution to how are we going to go
3336360	3338440	up against Guitar Hero and Rockband.
3338440	3339960	And it was a terrible idea.
3339960	3341480	It was a terrible idea.
3341480	3344200	And then after that they had Beaten Groovy.
3344200	3346840	So I mean, like choices.
3347560	3348060	Yeah.
3349240	3350040	All right.
3350040	3351640	Let's move on Loki.
3353080	3353320	Yeah.
3353320	3359240	So Valve is facing a lawsuit over, uh, apparently issues with the Steam
3359240	3365640	controller and that it's design actually was patented by somebody else.
3365640	3372840	So this is, um, regarding a third-party controller maker SCUF that says back
3372840	3378200	in 2014, that the design for the Steam controller was infringing on the,
3378200	3384040	uh, Ironbird, Ironberg patents, but they went ahead with the design anyways.
3384760	3389640	Um, and apparently the patent is regarding the rear side triggers.
3390360	3395080	They said that that's, um, which is on, I guess, opposite side of the pads.
3396120	3400200	So what I'm guessing is it's not like your normal trigger buttons, but like
3400200	3405080	those under controller triggers that you have on some of these, um, you know,
3405080	3409080	fancier buttons, I think they have like on the, uh, pro controller and stuff
3409080	3412200	like that from the Xbox pro controller or whatever.
3412200	3418040	Um, but yeah, so apparently they were filing a lawsuit regarding that.
3418040	3418520	I don't know.
3418520	3419400	The controller sucks.
3419400	3421000	So whatever.
3421000	3423560	But, um, it's kind of a little late for that.
3423560	3426200	They've already discontinued the controller and I don't think that they
3426200	3427560	made much money off of that.
3427560	3433640	It's gonna be hard to argue, uh, losses on that, but we'll see what happens.
3433640	3434120	Settlement.
3434120	3435000	I'm guessing.
3435000	3439560	Did you hear about the other lawsuit and saw involving valve about, um, was it,
3439560	3444120	no, we had the geo blocking a couple of weeks ago, but there was another one
3444120	3448520	about, um, their contract clause about that.
3448520	3452440	Um, you have to, if you could put your game up for sale on steam, which I
3452440	3456600	think the lawsuit, I think was trying to claim that steam kind of has a sense
3456600	3460840	of a monopoly on the market when it comes to PC, um, that it has to be
3460840	3464600	lowest price on steam, even if, so you can't put it like lower price on
3464600	3468120	humble, or if it goes on sale somewhere else, you have to put on sale on steam
3468120	3471000	too, which I, I kind of thought, and again, I don't have the story in front
3471000	3471560	of me.
3471560	3474840	Um, maybe some of you in chat recall this a little better than I do.
3474840	3477480	Um, but I, I seem to think like.
3478040	3481960	Didn't, doesn't Amazon have a controversial thing like this too?
3481960	3485240	When it comes to their store, um, at least when it comes to mobile apps, I
3485240	3486440	know was a thing.
3486440	3490120	Um, cause that was a very controversial sounds vaguely familiar.
3490120	3490600	Yeah.
3490600	3494520	Um, I'm not sure, but yeah, I could, I could see them kind of doing something
3494520	3498840	like that or not even necessarily just, you know, valve, but like, I think, you
3498840	3503480	know, a lot of different mobile storefronts and stuff possibly have
3503480	3505960	similar types of requirements.
3505960	3506440	Yeah.
3506440	3508840	Just for fair competition, they'll wedge.
3508840	3512440	Now Questbuster wants to point out in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog
3512440	3512760	network.
3512760	3516680	When it comes to the controller lawsuit, um, it does not appear to be patent
3516680	3517880	trolls that are doing this.
3517880	3521480	Um, it's saying not surprisingly, also surprisingly, excuse me, not patent
3521480	3522520	troll that is suing.
3522520	3524440	They actually make specialty controllers.
3524440	3527720	They're part of the company that make the scuff controllers that go for nearly
3527720	3529320	200 bucks on Amazon.
3529880	3533240	So, um, it seems like, you know, unfortunately we hear a lot about patent
3533240	3533960	trolls.
3533960	3536760	Um, but this may be somebody that actually does have an interest in this
3536760	3541240	yet again, kind of like Loki was saying these controllers have kind of come and
3541240	3542360	gone anyway.
3543080	3544040	So it's interesting.
3545480	3546040	That's happening.
3546040	3546200	Yeah.
3546200	3549000	These interesting looking controllers there.
3549000	3549240	Yeah.
3549240	3552200	I like, I like the fancy designs that they have for them.
3552200	3552600	Yeah.
3552600	3554040	Those analog sticks look pretty nice.
3554040	3555080	Why they're 200 bucks.
3555080	3555320	Right.
3556840	3560920	Well, I, you know, I want to say I've used something similar to this.
3560920	3564920	Like they actually had, and I don't remember this as the same company, but I
3564920	3569560	remember those types of little, uh, triggers that they had, but they had a
3569560	3570600	long time ago.
3570600	3576280	It was this thing you can like strap onto your, uh, Xbox controller.
3576280	3581080	Cause I actually had one that I got as like a, a promo thing or something.
3581080	3582200	And it was weird.
3582760	3585560	Like you could basically just strap it on.
3585560	3589640	It looks like this giant spider thing on top of your controller that adds like
3589640	3594440	all these different buttons and stuff that you basically just pull and push
3594440	3597880	different, uh, buttons on the actual controller, but they put them in
3597880	3598840	different places.
3598840	3603800	It was really weird, but yeah, it kind of looks like that, but I guess now
3603800	3608440	they've refined it quite more than that's, you know, spider thing that was
3608440	3609000	on there.
3609000	3609240	Yeah.
3610200	3611000	All right.
3611000	3613560	Well, let's move on a few more stories for you guys before we get to the
3613560	3614920	classic game of the week.
3614920	3619400	And, uh, first let's talk about this because this is a story about a mod, um,
3619400	3622360	that came out recently and it's, it's gone through a lot.
3622360	3626680	Um, so this is a mod for fallout new Vegas that was really going to be
3626680	3628600	transformative of the entire game.
3628600	3633160	Um, fallout, the frontier is the name of this mod and it did release on January
3633160	3633800	15th.
3633800	3637080	And, uh, it was so popular when it first came out because again, this has been
3637080	3639800	something that's been in development for a long time and a lot of people were
3639800	3640920	involved with this.
3640920	3646200	Um, you know, uh, doing, you know, fan art and, um, you know, all this stuff.
3646200	3652280	So, um, anyhow, the mod came out, it crashed nexus mods because it got 82,000
3652280	3653720	downloads the day it came out.
3654600	3659800	And then, uh, a lot of stuff started coming out about it.
3659800	3666040	Uh, in, in kind of most notably, I should say there was, uh, one of the mod
3666040	3672280	developers got ejected from the team because of some pedophilic content that
3672280	3674520	they had been, uh, posting you.
3674520	3675320	Yeah, exactly.
3675320	3675880	Big you.
3675880	3676520	Right.
3676520	3681160	Uh, and then a few hours after that, the entire mod was taken offline.
3681240	3683080	So yeah, big you.
3683080	3686280	And you know that that is gross and all that stuff.
3687000	3690360	But as I mentioned earlier, there's all these people involved with a mod.
3690360	3690840	Right.
3690840	3695880	And so this person just basically sank the entire ship right now.
3695880	3697000	I'm hearing a lot.
3697000	3698760	I haven't played the mod myself.
3698760	3703800	I'm hearing a lot of it is, um, there's some kind of strange content in there
3703800	3705160	and I'm going to leave it at that.
3705160	3709000	Um, some of it makes sense in the fallout universe.
3709000	3713720	Some of it, like, um, you know, uh, the sex with the death claw doesn't
3713720	3714760	necessarily make sense.
3714760	3720040	Um, but, uh, you know what, people do nude mods for games.
3720040	3723480	So if people want to have sex with the death claw, okay, whatever, I guess.
3723480	3727240	Uh, it also should be pointed out that the discord for this ended up getting
3727240	3730040	raided by 4chan, which certainly didn't help.
3730040	3734520	And now you've got all these people that were involved with the project that
3734520	3737400	are getting docs and all this other stuff.
3737400	3742760	And it's just, I don't, you know, like, again, no, no money was to, um, be made
3742760	3743720	off this whole thing.
3743720	3748520	So, um, I don't know what point they're going to make with that whole thing.
3748520	3752280	I mean, yes, go after the guy that did the pedophilia, but I don't know.
3754840	3757400	But again, I haven't played the mod myself, so I can't say much more than
3757400	3757960	that.
3757960	3764120	Uh, looking at chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, SSG100Matt says macho man
3764120	3765000	death claws though.
3765000	3765320	Oh yeah.
3765320	3768920	So maybe they were just waiting for the mod to the mod that would turn the death
3768920	3770120	claws into something else.
3770120	3770680	I see.
3770680	3772840	That was just forward thinking is what that was.
3772840	3773480	I see.
3773480	3773880	I see.
3774520	3777960	Questbuster says they can party with the macho man dragons in Skyrim.
3777960	3778920	Mm hmm.
3778920	3779480	All right.
3779480	3780040	Ooh, yeah.
3780840	3781320	Oh, yeah.
3781880	3782360	All right.
3782360	3787480	Anyway, um, you know, thoughts, thoughts to those that, you know, maybe got
3787480	3791000	involved with the project that didn't know the type of people that were on the
3791000	3791720	team.
3791720	3793400	Um, that's unfortunate.
3793960	3794280	All right.
3795240	3797320	Moving on though, let's go to our next story.
3797320	3798840	Uh, Dark Soccer, I think it's yours.
3799480	3799960	All right.
3799960	3804120	Well, I love Sega as has been proved with a chart recently.
3805400	3807160	Thanks, Rob, for letting me know about that.
3808600	3815080	Um, but anyway, um, Sega is going through a split, um, with its amusement and
3815080	3816360	video game divisions.
3816360	3824440	Um, it is definitely leading to some rumors that, uh, Sega may be in
3824440	3826280	pre-acquisition mode, I guess.
3826920	3836120	Um, so basically, um, those two divisions, um, are, uh, are basically being split
3836120	3836360	again.
3836360	3842520	Like I said, um, the CCO, um, uh, Toshihiro Nagoshi is, uh, going to be creative
3842520	3844840	director effective on April 1st.
3844840	3846200	That ain't no joke y'all.
3847000	3851480	Um, but they will remain under the ownership of Sega Sammy.
3851480	3855880	Um, and the quote is that it's intended to accelerate global business development
3855880	3859560	by streamlining their structure and accelerate decision-making.
3860360	3865880	So they, the other mention on this is that it's intended to transform Sega's
3865880	3869320	business structure to adapt to the external environment.
3870120	3875560	But the rumor is still that they are in prime position to be acquired.
3875560	3878680	Um, there are certainly rumors about Microsoft.
3878680	3880360	There's even talk of Nintendo.
3881000	3885720	Which if anyone was going to acquire Sega, I would want it to be Nintendo, which
3885720	3887080	would be ironic.
3887080	3888120	That would be super ironic.
3888120	3889880	Yeah, that'd be interesting.
3889880	3890280	Yeah.
3890280	3895880	Like if I could time travel to, you know, high school me and go, Hey, guess what?
3895880	3897160	Nintendo owns Sega.
3898840	3902040	People would look at me like I, you know, suddenly grew three, three.
3902040	3903880	I know it's, it's this ludicrous.
3903880	3906760	It's the talk of, you know, Super Mario Brothers is going to come out for
3906760	3907960	PlayStation five.
3907960	3912280	Like the, the reaction you would have to that statement now is the reaction we
3912280	3913400	would have had in college too.
3913400	3918040	Nintendo is, uh, in talks to buy Sega rumor, you know, even, it's just like,
3918040	3918760	no, they're, come on.
3918760	3919480	That's ridiculous.
3920440	3927880	Yeah, but it is, uh, not super ridiculous in today's understanding.
3927880	3928520	So yeah.
3928520	3929080	Yeah.
3929080	3934520	Um, and it's just been the slow decline of Sega, you know, but, oh, actually,
3934520	3936360	which reminds me of another game that I played, Rob.
3937160	3940360	I played crazy taxi on my iPad and it had the full sound.
3940360	3941560	I had the full soundtrack.
3941560	3942060	Good.
3942920	3943640	Yeah.
3943640	3947080	So, and anyway, I don't know why I didn't think about it until just now, but
3947080	3948280	Sega, Sega.
3948920	3951400	Um, tiger con chat says, I don't know about that.
3951400	3955000	If Nintendo owns Sega and Nintendo would shut down all these Sonic fan
3955000	3956920	games and don't give them ideas.
3956920	3962360	And there's, there's certainly been the rumors about Microsoft for a long
3962360	3963000	time.
3963000	3967240	And then fantasy star online agreement or a faster online to excuse me,
3967240	3968360	agreement happened.
3968360	3969880	And that just put fuel on the fire.
3969880	3971400	So that would be an interesting one too.
3971400	3972280	Wouldn't it?
3972280	3978040	So yeah, yeah, I'd be very, I mean, I also am a big fan of Sega doing their
3978040	3978520	own thing.
3978520	3982200	I don't really like all these mega companies that are ending up, but if it
3982200	3985240	has to be bought, it's going to be interesting either way that goes.
3985240	3988280	If it isn't intent, I mean, I would rather see Sega go to a company like
3988280	3991560	Microsoft or Nintendo than, um, Konami or EA.
3992200	3996120	Oh, don't let, don't let EA do a hostile takeover of that one.
3997240	4001320	I would rather see people leave some of the big companies just for the sake
4001320	4002680	of building up Sega.
4002680	4003320	Yeah.
4003320	4005000	And make it a powerhouse again.
4005000	4011320	That would be wishful thinking, but it would be nice, uh, pod culture and chat
4011320	4013240	says, imagine the Nintendo Dreamcast.
4013240	4015640	Hey, the Dreamcast mini could be a reality.
4016440	4017640	I've already seen it.
4017640	4022280	Remember when they, uh, they recompiled Mario 64 for the Dreamcast.
4022280	4023320	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
4023960	4025080	It's already a thing.
4027160	4031800	I'd love, I'd love that if, uh, even if Microsoft did it, that they would
4031800	4034920	invest in some of those Sega properties again, it'd be amazing.
4035800	4038360	All right, let's move on a few more stories for you.
4038360	4038860	Loki.
4039960	4040280	Yeah.
4040280	4044040	So we just got an update for Animal Crossing because, you know, there's more
4044040	4045800	holidays right around the corner.
4045800	4048760	So there was an update on the 28th of January.
4048760	4052280	That's supposed to be prepping us for Valentine's day game day,
4052280	4055000	Groundhog day and FestiVale.
4055640	4060840	And FestiVale, well, it's spelled FestiVale.
4060840	4061400	Okay.
4061400	4063480	So welcome to FestiVale.
4064280	4066840	Except that it's, it's a foreign word.
4066840	4067340	So.
4068040	4068360	Fine.
4068360	4068920	Whatever.
4068920	4069480	I don't care.
4069480	4073240	They've got the twerking, uh, peacock there, you know, whatever you want to call it.
4073240	4073880	It doesn't matter.
4074760	4075880	Peacock festival.
4075880	4076200	Yes.
4076200	4076700	Pave.
4077240	4077740	Pave.
4078360	4082120	Um, so that's going to be, I heard his name was Gay Rights.
4083960	4086920	Cause that's all I've heard about this event is that it's Gay Rights.
4088280	4089080	I love Pave.
4090440	4091720	I haven't seen the event yet.
4091720	4094120	I am starting, uh, starting tomorrow.
4094120	4098040	They're going to have a brand new set of outfits that are going to be available
4098600	4102360	and new reactions, including feeling it.
4102360	4104600	Let's go Viva and confetti.
4106440	4107080	That'd be fun.
4107080	4107960	Confetti would be fun.
4107960	4108460	Yeah.
4108760	4109260	Yeah.
4110040	4115320	And, um, yeah, so lots of new stuff I've been trying to get my, well, um, my wife's been
4115320	4120440	trying to get my son to play it because I know that's my cat.
4121320	4121880	Hi Stella.
4123640	4124520	She's being loud.
4124520	4125080	She knows that.
4125080	4126760	Um, what do you want?
4127720	4132520	Um, so anyways, yeah, new holiday stuff.
4132520	4136120	I'm still waiting for March when we're supposed to get that, the Nintendo stuff.
4136120	4138120	That's really the only thing I'm interested in.
4138120	4139160	I think that's coming up later.
4139880	4143320	If anyone wants to know right now, you seasonal items are out.
4143320	4149720	Um, they do have like a football rug and a glittery megaphone, I guess for the
4149720	4150440	stupor bowl.
4151240	4156440	Um, and then there's also the sets of Boon, uh, set where you throw out the beans for
4156440	4157480	sets of Boon.
4157480	4159480	So all right.
4159480	4159960	Pretty cool.
4159960	4162440	I like that we actually get all the international stuff.
4163320	4167960	Yeah, that is nice that we, it's not like locked to certain countries or whatever.
4167960	4172760	So yes, for those that are watching live, unfortunately it doesn't translate well into
4172760	4177960	the podcast, but Loki picked up the kitty and now the kitty just meow right in the mic.
4178600	4179240	She sure did.
4180120	4189240	Well, this where every kitty has a voice, I'd rather hear what that cat has to say than
4189240	4190120	some Twitter users.
4190120	4190680	That's for sure.
4191960	4193240	Probably a better opinion too.
4193880	4194280	All right.
4195080	4195320	All right.
4195320	4197400	What is your stance on cat food?
4197400	4198200	I'm for it.
4200760	4202600	All right, let's move on.
4202600	4207880	Uh, while Loki takes a minute to cuddle Stella there, uh, let's talk about Plex, the movie
4207880	4210920	company getting into gaming a little bit.
4210920	4216760	Uh, Plex is getting into a arcade service that they, I guess, unofficially launched this
4216760	4218680	week with some old school games.
4218680	4221320	So Plex is a media streaming service right now.
4221320	4224280	I think I've heard of this, but I can't say I've used it before.
4224280	4228200	Uh, and they do like TV and movies and audio and photos and things like that.
4228200	4231400	And now as of this week, they do Atari games.
4231960	4238680	If you subscribe to Plex arcade, you get Atari classics such as asteroids, missile command,
4238680	4239400	centipede.
4239400	4241560	There actually does appear to be a lot of them in here.
4241560	4243960	I'm just kind of looking through some of the screenshots.
4243960	4246120	A lot of the Atari classics are in there.
4246120	4247080	First party stuff.
4247080	4249400	You're not going to see the Activision stuff in there, like pitfall.
4250040	4253640	Um, and because that was, those are Activision games, just the first party Atari stuff.
4253640	4257240	Um, but they have stuff like I can see the 7,800 poking through where they have like
4257240	4259160	Ninja golf is actually there.
4259240	4261960	And I'm like, Oh dang, this is, those are some deep cuts in there.
4261960	4268280	Um, anyhow, you can stream the games, uh, with Android, uh, to Android mobile or TV,
4268280	4273880	iOS, or TV, iOS, or any Chrome browser and any Bluetooth controller will allow you to
4273880	4274200	play them.
4274200	4279400	But what's interesting about this, the Plex thing, which is either $3 a month, if you're
4279400	4286920	already a Plex Pass owner or $5 a month, if you don't have that, um, you, uh, can actually
4286920	4289560	load your own ROMs onto this.
4290200	4297000	And so that's the part that made me go, cause at first I'm like, okay, another company's
4297000	4298440	getting into retro gaming, whatever.
4298440	4299400	But then I was like, wait a minute.
4299400	4304840	They actually going to allow you to load your own ROMs and even like emulators into the
4304840	4305800	library.
4305800	4309480	That's the part where I'm like, and they're, they're paying you to do it, or I'm sorry,
4309480	4312120	you're paying them for the privilege to do it.
4312120	4313320	That part's very interesting.
4313320	4319880	But I guess because Plex is a server type of thing, it's just the ease of playing it
4319880	4324280	on your TV as opposed to, I don't know, having to set up a Raspberry Pi or whatever.
4324280	4328200	And then you are legally getting all these Atari licenses with that.
4328200	4330680	So that part's kind of interesting.
4330680	4336600	So, um, pod culture in chat says, uh, Zen, you are nuts.
4336600	4338760	Plex works just fine and looks okay.
4338760	4339720	Well, what did Zen say?
4339720	4344600	Oh, Zen says, Plex has an awful UI that barely works half the time and now they want to stream
4344600	4345160	games.
4345160	4345880	No, thank you.
4345880	4349880	Uh, Darkdude Studio says, the concept is neat, but I hear there's a lot of lag when you're
4349880	4352040	streaming, at least in the demo I saw from YouTube.
4352040	4354840	And Bexobaka says the games suffer from lag.
4354840	4356200	So, all right.
4356200	4356760	Hmm.
4356760	4358920	Why can't someone just bring back game room?
4359720	4360280	Yeah, right?
4361160	4363960	Seriously, like why would that be so difficult?
4363960	4367000	Like you would think that someone would be able to come up with the same concept that's
4367000	4368920	just like, okay, hey, yeah.
4368920	4373560	I have an arcade with stuff in it and, you know, I can outfit it with games that you
4373560	4375160	can play and stuff like that.
4375160	4375960	I don't know.
4375960	4377720	I have Antstream, which is pretty good.
4377720	4382920	Um, it's a lot of, uh, Commodore and Spectrum games and they're starting to get some Atari
4382920	4383560	games in it.
4383560	4385480	Um, disclosure, I back their Kickstarter.
4385480	4386600	That's why I'm still in it.
4386600	4388360	Cause I'm in my second year at this point.
4388360	4390680	I think my sub will finally run out this summer.
4390680	4393880	Um, I wish they'd get the client on Xbox series X though.
4393880	4395800	They only have it on Xbox one.
4395800	4398840	So it's weird to me that it's not on series X, but for whatever reason, it's not.
4399320	4402760	It's on PC as well, but it all, it streams everything.
4402760	4404200	Like it's, it's cloud gaming.
4404200	4409640	It's basically stadia, but since it's all classic games, there's very little bandwidth
4409640	4412680	actually being used because the resolution isn't that great.
4412680	4413000	Yeah.
4413000	4418600	And no, actually there's a little bit of artifacting sometimes, but for the most part, especially
4418600	4421720	in regards to being responsive and stuff, the game's fine.
4421720	4425800	They just added, um, classic Mortal Kombat not that long ago, like the original arcade
4425800	4427560	Mortal Kombat that kind of surprised me.
4427560	4429080	So there was that.
4429080	4429800	All right.
4429800	4434520	Well, speaking of classic arcades, let's visit the classic game of the week.
4435800	4440760	Every week, dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, Hey,
4440760	4443160	you brats, you should check this game out.
4443720	4446200	Uh, load this onto your Plex server.
4446200	4451480	Although this one might be a little bit difficult and this one, this is also, uh, one of those
4451480	4453720	choices, I think for its uniqueness.
4453720	4456200	Um, but I guess I should let dark soccer speak to that.
4456200	4458360	So dark soccer brought this up in the past.
4458360	4458760	You have.
4458760	4463880	So what is the classic game of the week, which might take a second for the B roll to appear
4463880	4465320	as I think I forgot to preload it.
4465320	4466440	Sorry, but it'll come right up.
4467320	4471080	Well, well, not that there's really a lot going on on that video.
4471960	4473560	I believe I linked to the Dreamcast one.
4473560	4474120	You did.
4474120	4480200	Um, cause the Saturn has no video, but the game is real sound cause they know regret
4480200	4482040	or wind of regret.
4482680	4487000	Um, it was an audio adventure game that was developed by warp.
4487000	4491080	It was first released on the Sega Saturn in July, 1997.
4491720	4499640	And later on the Dreamcast in 1999, real sound was supposed to provide equal access for sighted
4499640	4500840	and blind players.
4501480	4509160	Um, so, um, to go actually a little bit more itself, um, warp's president, uh, uh, Kenji
4510040	4516600	created the game after, uh, getting appreciation letters from, uh, blind fans of his games
4516600	4517560	in Japan.
4517560	4523000	And he was thinking that it would be great to have visually disabled fans have games
4523000	4527720	that would be rich and involved that they could play and get into.
4527720	4530200	I'm actually going to read a quote from 2008.
4530200	4531640	Um, and an interview with one up.
4532280	4536360	I had a chance to visit people who are visually disabled and I learned that there are blind
4536360	4538040	people who play action games.
4538040	4542200	Of course, they're not able to have the full experience and they're kind of trying to force
4542200	4545480	themselves to be able to play, but they're making the effort.
4545480	4550680	So I thought that if you turn off the monitor, both, both of you are hearing the same game.
4550680	4554360	So after you finish the game, you can have an equal conversation about it with blind
4554360	4555080	person.
4555080	4558760	That was the inspiration behind real sound cause I know regret as well.
4559960	4564280	So, um, he was really excited about it and he really pushed.
4564840	4568360	So, uh, and, and really a bargaining, uh, thing with Sega.
4568920	4572120	So, uh, he did that in exchange for exclusive rights to the game.
4572120	4576680	So they would donate a thousand Sega Saturn consoles to visually impaired people.
4577320	4582760	Um, and he also personally downloaded, uh, donated, sorry, a thousand copies of the game
4582760	4583960	along with the consoles.
4584680	4590840	Um, and it's only been re-released once, but he said that it has to do with that deal he
4590840	4592840	has with, uh, with Sega.
4593480	4599320	Um, he's, he's basically, it was the only thing that was limiting it that could only
4599320	4601000	be released on a Sega console.
4602040	4609800	So, um, it has, uh, actually pretty good voice cast in it, including, um, a really popular
4609800	4612120	drama actress, uh, Miho Kanno.
4612600	4621320	Um, Ai Maeda who has done some amazing voice acting, um, got, uh, actually a really good
4621320	4623720	composer, Keiichi Suzuki.
4623720	4627880	Um, he did, uh, uh, the blind swordsman, Datoichi and outrage.
4627880	4631080	Um, Aki Koyano did the ending theme.
4631080	4639160	Um, and the game was actually written by, uh, a, uh, a screenwriter, uh, Yuji Sakamoto,
4639160	4642840	um, really, really talented group of people that worked on it.
4642840	4653160	So basically, um, the plot is about central elements, fear and love in a story in Tokyo.
4653880	4657960	So, uh, there's an elementary student is moved to a new school where she has to join new
4657960	4659560	students and seated next to a boy.
4660200	4665880	Um, the two fall in love, but, and they're really young and they want to elope and they
4665880	4671960	arranged to meet at the clock tower, but, um, the girl Izumi never shows up as she's transferred
4671960	4675800	away and then they meet again as college students.
4676680	4681560	And so, um, they're dealing then with a mystery that has to do with the disappearance.
4681560	4684760	And so that's leading into the story of the game.
4685320	4692280	Um, and there are, by the way, translations, uh, online, um, for, uh, you can read.
4692840	4699160	Um, but it basically, um, there is a version, the Dreamcast one, uh, specifically that has
4699160	4707880	a visual mode that, um, it gives you like a little bit of extra, you know, scenery with
4707880	4713320	the game, but they both games still exclusively rely on the audio portions of the game.
4713320	4717800	Um, the, yeah, the Dreamcast visual mode is just really non-essential.
4717800	4721000	Um, and it's constructed as an interactive radio drama.
4721000	4727640	Um, so you're basically listening to the story as it unfolds and you have different forks
4727640	4732200	in your plot line and you get a chime and that you have to choose the course that the
4732200	4733160	plot will take.
4734200	4737800	Um, once you've confirmed your choice, then the plot resumes.
4737800	4740520	So it's actually a choose your own adventure kind of story.
4742360	4744600	Um, very, very unique.
4744600	4752360	Um, so, um, going further into it, the game really didn't sell very well.
4753160	4758920	Um, but it's really now considered, um, a collector's item because of Ena's other titles.
4759640	4768280	Um, they're, um, one of the cool things about this, especially for the collect, uh,
4768280	4774520	the collectability of it is that you get, um, like different, uh, instructions.
4774520	4781400	Like for example, in braille and you get seeds, a bag of herb seeds as they're listed, um,
4781400	4783720	and a transparent box of the cloud motif.
4784360	4790760	Um, I, I know someone who had, who had the seeds and that was what I brought up before.
4790760	4793000	You were talking about things that come with games.
4793000	4793500	Yeah.
4793880	4795880	You know, you could get a bag of seeds.
4796840	4804520	So, um, so a version of this game with only one path, um, errored, uh, on, uh, a Tokyo
4804520	4811720	FM in 1997, um, and then there were other games of his that were actually released by
4811720	4813240	Real Sound's gameplay.
4813800	4820200	For example, um, for Enemy Zero that came out in 97 on Saturn, there were enemies that
4820200	4823000	were invisible and could only be located by sound.
4823560	4830200	And D2, another of his games, 2000 on Dreamcast, uh, really drew from the limitations to your
4830200	4831640	sensory perceptions.
4831640	4836200	So there are portions of the game where the character is rendered blind with only a voice
4836200	4837400	to guide her.
4837400	4842920	And alternatively, she, uh, another mode, death, where she only has her vision to guide
4842920	4843420	her.
4843800	4849960	There was a sequel, um, that was planned called Kiri no Orge.
4850600	4856760	Um, it was in development to be the second game and it was going to, uh, there was, I
4856760	4858040	can't make words happen.
4858040	4859560	It was going to be a horror theme.
4860040	4866360	Um, and they had, uh, ads for it in various magazines, but the couldn't really do to voice
4866360	4867960	compression technology.
4867960	4877240	Some of the story, uh, arcs, um, uh, Kiri no Orge were, uh, put into D2, um, and then
4877240	4882760	into another game called, uh, well, there was actually going to be another installment
4882760	4886360	in the series called Spy Lunch, but that of course never developed.
4887160	4893800	So, um, but this game, um, is still actually popular amongst the visually disabled.
4894440	4900520	Um, and I really wanted to outline something that it, that was made specifically with that
4900520	4901560	community in mind.
4902280	4908440	You know, there are gamers all across the ability scale one way or another.
4909160	4912920	We, we have listeners of our show who are legally blind.
4913640	4921800	Um, and I think that it's great that there was a game that was released specifically
4921800	4926280	for those people and people in chat are talking about Plex and not listening, I guess, but,
4926280	4928600	uh, we're having some frame drops as well.
4928600	4930600	So it might not just be because of that.
4931400	4931900	Okay.
4934200	4938200	At any rate, I felt this game kind of was very important to me that we mentioned it
4938200	4945800	just simply because, I mean, we have such an A-list designer who was thinking of a
4945800	4950840	community that is so often left out of the gaming conversation.
4952040	4959720	And I wish that more, um, more developers would have different things.
4959720	4965560	Like for example, say that, you know, for certain levels of, uh, the visually impaired,
4965560	4967240	you have like a high contrast mode.
4968600	4969160	Right.
4969160	4969660	Right.
4969960	4973320	Well, and Last of Us Part II had a lot of this type of stuff, which was great.
4973960	4974440	Exactly.
4974440	4974940	Exactly.
4975480	4982280	But I think that, that there needs to be, um, there needs to be more games that are created
4982280	4986200	with our other ability communities in mind.
4987400	4992280	I'm going to bring it back to the main shot of us away from the, uh, footage, just because
4992280	4993960	I want to see if that fixes some of our issues.
4993960	4994680	I might not.
4995320	4997960	Sorry, we're, we're getting internet drops that are kind of out of my control.
4997960	4999000	I don't know what the hell's going on.
4999000	4999500	Sorry.
5000040	5000360	All right.
5000360	5007000	Well, at any rate, I would have really liked to have had, um, the other stories come out.
5007000	5012040	Um, I, it just, to me just seems so fun to have like a drama that you can play.
5012040	5016840	Of course, my comprehension, um, when, when I almost bought a copy of the game, but my
5016840	5020040	comprehension was not where it needed to be to play it properly.
5020040	5020680	Right.
5020680	5024600	So, um, I wonder if I would be able to go back and play it now.
5025400	5025900	Maybe not.
5026520	5030520	Um, I was just to say the vibe I kind of get from the game, you know, even though it's,
5030520	5035960	um, very light on the graphics, because obviously it's, it's with a different medium in mind.
5035960	5037080	Well, the Saturn had none.
5037640	5043240	I, well, I, but I still get that vibe of, um, like an old CD-ROM game that, you know,
5043240	5048040	you kind of have those very like photographic quality visuals, but they were very simple.
5048200	5048700	Like Myst?
5049560	5055480	I, in a way, I guess, but, um, even more like photo, Myst wasn't really photo realistic.
5055480	5059080	Whereas like, you know, the game we were looking at here was very photo realistic in a way.
5059080	5063640	Um, I think it's, it's kind of neat because it's just that early CD-ROM technology really
5063640	5065800	tried to like, Ooh, make it look real.
5065800	5069720	You know, I'd almost say in a way, like, I don't know, something like Phantasmagoria,
5069720	5069960	right.
5069960	5071320	It was like real people.
5071320	5072840	Phantasmagoria was great.
5072840	5073080	Right.
5073080	5079320	And like a real scene and all this stuff, you know, even though it was all cheesy B
5079320	5083640	community theater, uh, special effects still, you know, that game was kind of legendary
5083640	5084280	for all of that.
5084280	5087960	And I think, you know, this game that you just showed us kind of, you know, it still
5087960	5092600	has that photo realism, obviously just to try, try to invoke images, probably of the
5092600	5098760	story that's being told, but, you know, even for, I, cause unfortunately I think sometimes
5098760	5101000	people hear this, you know, this is true.
5101000	5104920	People hear, Oh, this is a game made for a certain audience.
5104920	5107800	And if that audience isn't them, then they're like, ah, then what's here for me?
5107800	5108760	Nothing, you know?
5108760	5109880	And they skip over it.
5109880	5110520	Right.
5110520	5113960	But like, this seems like the type of thing that like could actually just be totally meant
5113960	5116440	to like, you kind of have playing on the TV or whatever.
5116440	5119640	And you're just chilling on the couch, kind of laying back, eyes closed.
5119640	5121080	You don't even have to look at the game.
5121080	5123320	You can experience the media in a different way.
5123320	5128120	And so it's like, sometimes it's about broadening the way you consume things, which I think
5128120	5128680	is interesting.
5129240	5134920	Well, and the thing, the thing is that there are very few games that are just audio only.
5134920	5140920	Another one that comes to mind is Papa Sangre, which actually just got, it got a sequel in
5140920	5144840	2013, but it's a horror themed audio game that came out on iOS.
5147320	5151160	So there's, there's a few other ones.
5151160	5157400	Like there's also Chillingham is another one that came out in 2004, but I picked this one
5157400	5165080	in particular simply because it, it was one of the big games that really put a lot of
5165080	5166920	focus on it in Japan.
5166920	5169080	It's a damn shame we never got a version of it here.
5169080	5176040	I think that that certainly or at least had other language releases in general, because
5176040	5177800	I think a lot of people would have benefited from it.
5177800	5181000	Well, and there was really nothing like it on the Dreamcast or the Saturn, you know,
5181000	5184360	but I say I call it Dreamcast specifically because the Dreamcast was always that weird
5184360	5185800	system, you know?
5185800	5191880	And then here was another off the track of usual stuff thing that it tried.
5191880	5195080	And, you know, just, I bet a lot of people didn't even know this existed.
5196680	5204760	But it's, it's definitely one of those more interesting games and hopefully my goal is,
5204760	5210280	this might sound like a little odd goal, but I would like to one day have my listening
5210280	5212360	comprehension be good enough to play this game.
5213160	5213560	All right.
5214360	5214760	Yep.
5214760	5215480	So there you go.
5215480	5215880	Well, thank you.
5215880	5217800	Real sounds cause a no regret.
5217800	5218280	Okay.
5218280	5220360	Your classic game of the week.
5220360	5224600	Very, I honestly, I thought I've heard of them all, but I did not hear of this game
5224600	5226440	until looking at it for tonight's show.
5226440	5227240	So very cool.
5227240	5229720	Well, I did tell you about it, about the seeds.
5229720	5231400	You did, but you tell me about a lot of games.
5233720	5237720	This is the first time I've actually like seen it, you know, and gotten to, you know,
5237720	5238360	check it out.
5238360	5241720	So wait till you see the fucking weird game I picked for next month.
5241720	5242040	All right.
5242040	5242440	Can't wait.
5242440	5242760	Oh yeah.
5242760	5244200	Cause we're still in January.
5244200	5247720	We're still in, it's like, there's a lot of five episodes in January this month.
5247720	5251480	I already have next week's regular game picked out, but the week after is going to be the
5251480	5252040	weirdo.
5252040	5253000	Oh, perfect.
5253000	5254760	That'll be just in time for Valentine's day.
5254760	5255960	So perfect.
5255960	5256600	Well, yeah.
5256600	5261400	Then, you know, uh, when I, I'll tell you what it is early, Robin, you'll laugh your
5261400	5261800	face off.
5261800	5262120	So, okay.
5262120	5264760	Well, obviously not now don't ruin it for the listeners, but tell me later, text it
5264760	5265400	or something.
5265400	5270200	Um, the, uh, well, yes, there, there is that little football game on TV next week.
5270520	5272600	Although that's never stopped us before.
5272600	5274920	Um, not going to stop us from doing the show.
5274920	5278600	And I said, did you pick something themed with the football game?
5278600	5280600	Is that why you already know next week?
5280600	5281000	Excuse me.
5281000	5281480	Nope.
5281480	5281960	Oh, okay.
5281960	5282600	I was curious.
5283720	5284120	All right.
5285160	5286280	Let's move on.
5286280	5290440	Let's talk about, I was, I was usually, I don't, the only thing I care about with those
5290440	5292920	games, the commercials are kind of neat sometimes.
5292920	5296120	And I did see, cause y'all posted about it in discord.
5296120	5299720	I saw that whole like Wayne's world is coming back.
5299800	5303400	Like they actually have Mike Meyers and Dana Carvey doing a Wayne's world for, I guess
5303400	5310440	it's Uber eats who also had, you know, um, uh, I keep wanting to say Jean-Luc Picard,
5310440	5311000	but that's not his name.
5311000	5316840	Patrick Stewart and, um, Skywalker, Mark Hamill, Mark Hamill.
5316840	5319080	We're in a commercial together for Uber eats.
5319080	5321720	So they've been getting, getting, paying a lot of, uh, big celebrities.
5321720	5324680	So they got Mike Meyers and Dana Carvey to reunite and do Wayne's world.
5324680	5326440	So I guess that's a commercial for the super bowl.
5326440	5327880	So that, that's kind of neat.
5327880	5332040	I guess I like the commercial sometimes, but you can see them all online the day before
5332040	5332840	the day after.
5332840	5333640	Easy, easy.
5333640	5338120	And then usually about the puppy bowl, usually the puppy bowl and the kitty half time, which
5338120	5341960	aren't Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg doing it this year or something.
5341960	5346040	Somebody posted something discord about like Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg are doing the
5346040	5346520	animal bowl.
5346520	5348280	Snoop is trending on Twitter right now.
5349080	5349320	Huh?
5350120	5352200	Chad, I think it's for the Super Bowl.
5352200	5352760	All right.
5352760	5353800	The superb owl.
5354440	5357800	And then, um, the other thing I usually care about is the halftime show.
5357800	5363800	Like when Beyonce did the halftime show life when lady Gaga did the halftime show life
5363800	5366120	when Beyonce did the halftime show again.
5366120	5369080	Uh, but she just snuck in there as part of Coldplay life.
5369080	5370760	Like it was, it was great.
5370760	5373560	Um, I think this year they have the weekend doing it.
5373560	5376280	Um, who I actually don't even care about the halftime show.
5376280	5378120	I like, well, I like, I like his stuff.
5378120	5379480	I'd be curious to see how it comes out.
5379480	5381560	I think I love the, uh, Cynthia vibe.
5381560	5385160	A lot of his songs have, he has a very like old school, Michael Jackson sound to him,
5385160	5386200	which I really dig.
5386200	5389400	Um, but, uh, I think he has a ton of guest stars too.
5389400	5390600	I don't think it's just him.
5390600	5393320	Let me be curious to see how that turns out, but, uh, yeah.
5394280	5394680	Anyway.
5395480	5396280	All right.
5396280	5397160	Moving on.
5397160	5400360	Let's get into some rapid fire news.
5400360	5404280	Uh, Loki, let's, uh, start us off with some quick stories.
5404280	5405080	Loki, Loki.
5405080	5405480	Yeah.
5405480	5408760	So we talked a little bit last week about what the games for gold for February are going
5408760	5411480	to be, but now let's talk about PlayStation plus.
5411640	5415000	So for PlayStation five, we've got destruction all stars.
5415000	5420120	And then we have on PlayStation four control ultimate edition, which is also on PS five
5420120	5423080	and concrete genie, all pretty solid titles actually.
5423080	5425000	So that's going to be for February.
5425880	5434280	And then we got news that there's a, there was a baseball, um, game that's, you know,
5434280	5440840	all, uh, you know, uh, NBA jam or, um, what was it NFL?
5440840	5443320	Uh, I can't remember the NFL one.
5443320	5444520	Anyways, NFL blitz.
5444520	5445240	That's right.
5445240	5450680	And so they had a game coming or that was being worked on called power at baseball.
5451320	5455960	And it was developed in the mid nineties by Midway and incredible technologies.
5455960	5461960	Of course it never actually came out, but because, uh, the video game history foundation
5461960	5463080	is awesome.
5463080	5468680	You can actually play a ROM of it on Mame and check out the game itself.
5468680	5470680	So that is pretty cool.
5470680	5477000	And I don't know, it just never came out because I guess, I don't know.
5477000	5483320	They maybe thought that they didn't translate as well as say NBA jam or NFL.
5483320	5485960	Maybe the licensing didn't come through for some of the people.
5485960	5487320	I bet that could be an issue too.
5488200	5493240	So, but yeah, it looks pretty cool and get a chance to play something that, you know,
5493240	5493800	could have been.
5494360	5494600	Yeah.
5495160	5499640	Um, and a shout out cause Jason who, you know, does all our voiceovers and did an amazing
5499640	5501080	job with the intro as always.
5501080	5507320	Um, Jason talked about, um, some other alternative, like actiony baseball type of games, uh, that
5507320	5508760	did come out like baseball stars.
5508760	5509480	I remember that one.
5509480	5511000	And that's, that's a great one as well.
5511000	5511400	So yeah.
5511400	5512760	That on Neo Geo.
5512760	5513160	Yeah.
5513160	5515080	Well, there was a version on NES, believe it or not.
5515640	5516040	Yeah.
5516040	5516520	I know.
5516520	5517000	Yeah.
5517000	5519880	So yeah, but it's probably better known for Neo Geo for sure, but yeah.
5520600	5522120	Uh, all right, moving on.
5522120	5527800	Uh, let's talk about destiny two, which destiny two is going to be changing up the way it
5527800	5529320	does rewards a little bit.
5529320	5531320	There will no longer be weekly bounties.
5531320	5535800	They're going to go to seasonal, seasonal challenges to try to make things feel a little
5535800	5537320	less grindy, I guess.
5537880	5540920	Um, so that is what you can do now.
5541240	5545800	So there's some goals, uh, that bungee went through and how to make the game more fun.
5545800	5550360	Uh, in, in, in other words, provide a guide to new returning and veteran players for what
5550360	5554520	to do today or this week guide the player through the seasonal content week over week,
5554520	5558920	encourage players to engage with complexities and nuances of the seasonal activity and rituals
5558920	5563320	and reduce the penalties on XP and bright dust for missing a giver given week.
5563320	5566600	So they've done a seasonal challenges now that you do objectives.
5567400	5571480	And you can do objectives during the week, but you have until the end of the season really
5571480	5572520	to complete them.
5572520	5574520	Um, not just that one week period.
5574520	5577640	So, um, you know, you see a lot of games doing seasonal things.
5577640	5579960	So destiny two going that direction makes sense.
5579960	5582760	Um, I have been playing that a little bit on series X.
5582760	5584600	I haven't played in the last week or two.
5584600	5586840	Um, but it's a real pretty game.
5586840	5589160	They, they definitely souped it up for series X.
5589160	5590600	It looks real good.
5590600	5592120	So I should play some more of that.
5592120	5592760	That's for sure.
5593560	5596200	And man, I wish they had something like this when I was younger.
5596200	5602360	Um, Lego just put out their own type of app that is for music video making for kids.
5602360	5608440	It's called video, but it's V I D I Y O video.
5608440	5610360	That's basically what it is.
5610360	5615000	So this is a app that allows kids to make their own music videos.
5615000	5619560	Um, when you have certain, of course, Lego figures and blocks, you scan them into the
5619560	5623880	app and it makes the characters go into song and dance with AR.
5623880	5628280	And then of course, because it's all AR, you can choose where you want to put the
5628280	5631880	characters in the real world and then kind of, you know, use your camera to shoot them
5631880	5632680	a little bit.
5632680	5637240	Um, some of the music comes from universal music groups, uh, pop roster, and there are
5637240	5640840	60 seconds samples, so they don't put the whole songs in there, but you can make a little
5640840	5641960	bit of a sample there.
5641960	5643160	And I think that's really cute.
5643160	5646680	Like, you know, get kids, you know, making their own movies when they're young.
5646680	5647720	I think that's pretty cool.
5647720	5649960	And a good use of that AR technology.
5649960	5653080	Interesting to see Lego doing that again, because of course, you know, we talked a lot
5653080	5658120	about the Mario Legos they've done, um, towards the end of last year, and that used a lot
5658120	5659720	of interesting technology as well.
5659720	5663320	So Legos really pushing the envelope y'all.
5664120	5664440	All right.
5664440	5669560	They've also got, well, aside from that, they have their stop motion studio thing that they
5669560	5672920	had a set that you could use your phone to do that.
5672920	5675400	Um, they've been pushing stuff with unity.
5675400	5681480	They have their whole Lego, uh, you know, I guess not really a tutorial, but it's kind
5681480	5683560	of like a kit that you can create stuff with.
5684200	5687320	So yeah, they've been doing a lot of stuff with like gaming involved.
5689080	5689960	All right.
5689960	5691320	Well, let's move on to our Sakura.
5694600	5696600	Of course, animal crossing happiness.
5696600	5700360	I was so thrilled when I saw this, even though I pretty much already have the cards.
5700360	5705080	Um, but, uh, they are doing the Sanrio amiibo cards.
5705400	5712120	They're coming out at target, um, exclusively at target on March 26th.
5712760	5716360	Um, they are, uh, six different cards.
5716360	5723960	Um, these were actually, um, put out for the, uh, welcome amiibo edition of, uh, animal
5723960	5724840	crossing new leaf.
5725880	5731320	Um, so you get Rila, who is the hello kitty gorilla, who's kind of creepy.
5731320	5733160	You get Marty, huh?
5733160	5733880	I was just laughing.
5734520	5734840	Oh yeah.
5735480	5741320	You get Marty, who is the, um, a yellow pom pom pudding, um, character.
5741320	5743320	You have Chai who is so cute.
5743320	5746760	She's an elephant with a teacup on her head and she's for pom pom pudding.
5747320	5749400	Chelsea is, uh, my melody.
5750120	5755240	Toby is, I actually really liked his set in, uh, in pocket camp too.
5755240	5761240	And who is, uh, little twin stars, which little twin stars is my favorite Sanrio group.
5761240	5768680	What I don't see on here though, is if you're going to be able to welcome the characters.
5769320	5777000	Um, it says right here that it's only going to be to unlock the in-game posters, which
5777000	5783880	I mean, I already have, but, um, I'm really hoping that they put out a patch to give us
5783880	5791320	those animals, because it would be nice to, for me to have Etoile in my, uh, in my village.
5791320	5791480	Yeah.
5791480	5792840	That's what I was hopeful about too.
5792840	5797480	But then I guess, you know, if these cards have existed in Japan already, since the game's
5797480	5800120	launched, then if the characters were going to be there, they'd be there.
5800120	5805000	But I, I, I still am crossing my fingers and toes that maybe with the, uh, unveiling of
5805000	5808840	the cards officially in the U S maybe they'll patch the game and add the villagers and then
5808840	5809960	Japan can enjoy that too.
5810040	5813880	Cause they, I imagine either they have the cards accessible or they, they could do a
5813880	5815000	reprint pretty easily.
5815640	5821160	Well, and on top of that, um, if you've still, if you still have new leaf, then you can get
5821160	5821800	the characters there.
5821800	5822280	I reckon.
5823480	5827080	Well, it says they also have furniture in new leaf as well.
5827720	5830120	Well, yeah, that was the point of them.
5830120	5832680	They brought in a different furniture sets.
5834040	5835720	Those furniture sets are cute too.
5835720	5838360	I want them in, uh, in, uh, the new one.
5838360	5840040	Like why pocket camp?
5840040	5845560	And I had like all of, um, stuff and Toby's the set.
5845560	5846060	Yeah.
5846440	5848520	The set was like ultra Japanese.
5848520	5849160	It was so cute.
5850200	5852600	But why restrict it to the 3d S version of the game?
5852600	5857320	That's so old, but I guess, you know, because they were made for the 3d S version.
5857320	5863480	No, but the amiibos were made for certain things and then they, uh, use them in later
5863480	5863800	games.
5863800	5866360	Like most amiibo were for smash brothers.
5866760	5867000	Right.
5867000	5873240	There's a, there are a lot of animal crossing characters who I have a physical amiibo for,
5873240	5877080	and I have their cards that the character is not in the game.
5877080	5883000	Like, remember I had my Pascal poster before I could get a picture with Pascal before his
5883000	5883640	model was out.
5884520	5885720	I had the pave poster.
5885720	5887240	I sent you the pave poster.
5887240	5888920	Yes, I have the pave poster.
5888920	5893400	And now I can get pave in my studio, you know, because I have the card, but like you can't
5893400	5896280	get, um, uh, chip.
5897560	5905400	You can't get porter or Booker and copper or, uh, well for a while you couldn't get
5905400	5908760	the llamas and then they did their little wedding thing and then you could get them.
5909400	5914200	Um, but you can't get Peli or Phyllis.
5914200	5914840	I love Phyllis.
5914840	5915640	She's so grumpy.
5915640	5916600	Maybe that's just what it is.
5916600	5919480	We have to wait for more events because we're, we've been getting some of them as they've
5919480	5920200	released events.
5920200	5922920	Like pave is a good example of that, of the events that they're doing.
5922920	5924280	We just have to wait for more events, I guess.
5924280	5926840	But these, these, uh, Hello Kitty ones are villagers.
5926840	5931800	And so that would be neat if they would put, let them move into the village, but I guess
5931800	5932280	it's a lot to ask for.
5932280	5935640	I don't see it happening though, unless they figure out some way to do it.
5935640	5941000	But at least the thing with, with, um, this Animal Crossing is that the game we have now
5941000	5943160	is not quite the same game we got when it came out.
5943160	5943660	True.
5944680	5946120	It's got lots of other stuff to do.
5947160	5951400	So moving on, since this is supposed to be rapid fire, um, Nintendo, huh?
5951400	5952440	I just was just laughing.
5953160	5961560	Oh, Nintendo announced a, uh, monster Hunter rise, uh, special edition switch and, uh,
5961560	5967240	and also a switch pro controller, uh, for, uh, the same that will be out when the game
5967240	5969400	is released in Japan on March 26th.
5970040	5973160	Uh, the price will be 38,400 yen.
5973160	5978600	So roughly about, you know, 30 or 380 bucks us.
5979080	5984600	And it has, of course, the, the doc, the unit, the joy cons that are all monster Hunter rise
5984600	5985100	themed.
5985640	5990600	Um, and then you can also get the digital copy of the game.
5990600	5994920	And for the pre-order bonus, there's a deluxe kit with downloadable content.
5994920	5995640	It looks cool.
5995640	5997720	I'm not in a monster Hunter, but it looks cool.
5997720	5998220	Yeah.
5998760	6001480	Nothing of course about, you know, the U S so.
6003080	6003580	All right.
6004520	6005160	All right.
6005160	6008520	Well, let's travel around the world, starting in the U S and looking at the rest of the
6008520	6012040	world too, and check out what will be coming out in release dates.
6012040	6012540	Loki.
6013160	6013560	Yes.
6013560	6019160	Uh, so this week we have cultists simulator on Nintendo switch, uh, destruction all stars
6019160	6025800	on PlayStation five, uh, ease nine monstrum knocks on PlayStation four.
6026680	6034440	Uh, we have habroxia two on PC PlayStation four Vita, Xbox one and Nintendo switch.
6035320	6042920	Uh, Haven on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four sky forge on Nintendo switch, uh, werewolf,
6042920	6050040	the apocalypse earth blood on PC PlayStation four PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series
6050040	6056840	X, uh, Neo remastered the complete edition on PlayStation five, as well as Neo to remastered
6056840	6062840	the complete edition on PlayStation five and then on PC and PlayStation four Neo to the
6062840	6064120	complete edition.
6064120	6064680	And that's it.
6065800	6066200	All right.
6066200	6068360	Well, Japan's list is pretty short this week.
6068360	6072840	Just that Neo collection, Neo one and two on the PlayStation five.
6072840	6076680	And then as you were saying, Neo to kind of remastered on the PlayStation four, that is
6076680	6076760	it.
6076760	6079000	Those are the soul releases in Japan this week.
6079000	6080360	So how about the UK dark soccer?
6081400	6082520	Only a handful.
6082520	6086840	We have werewolf, the apocalypse earth blood on the 4th of February.
6086840	6091640	And then on the 5th, we have anima arcane edition and ghost of the tail collectors
6091640	6092140	edition.
6093480	6093960	All right.
6094840	6095240	All right.
6095240	6099560	Well, we have a few more stories for you guys before we get to the listener round table
6099560	6102120	via our chat, as well as our mailbag.
6102120	6105720	And you can always email the show, participate at orange lounge radio.com.
6105720	6107720	If you want to drop us a line via email.
6107720	6109960	Um, but let's get to some more news Loki.
6110840	6113400	So everybody's probably familiar with the game Celeste.
6113400	6120920	I was unaware that the game originally was released on the Pico eight, um, back in 2016
6121480	6123640	and now, uh, extremely okay.
6123640	6130280	Games is creating a sequel for that, uh, Pico eight version called Celeste to, uh, Lonnie's
6130280	6134040	Trek, which is actually available to download now for free.
6134680	6136920	Um, so that's pretty sweet.
6136920	6140840	And then you can find that on itch, the IO, um, check it out there.
6141480	6148200	But I had no idea that that was actually a, uh, game on the Pico eight.
6148200	6148360	Yeah.
6148360	6149400	I didn't realize that either.
6149400	6150200	That's pretty cool though.
6150200	6151480	That game's everywhere now though.
6152200	6152760	Yeah.
6152760	6156120	I'm kind of curious to see if they're going to, you know, port that over to the, like
6156120	6157560	the newer style or something like that.
6157560	6160360	That'd be kind of cool, but, um, have to check it out.
6161160	6161400	Yeah.
6161400	6162200	Why not?
6162200	6164040	Why not let the sequel get some of that too?
6164040	6169080	Cause you know, and they've, they've, um, given it away like as a plus game or a gold
6169080	6173080	game and, you know, there's a lot of ways, uh, Epic store, I think had it as their free
6173080	6173960	game at one point.
6173960	6177080	So there's a lot of ways you've probably added this to your library at some point.
6177080	6179720	And it is, it's not just like, Oh yay, free game.
6179720	6184600	It actually is a really like, like bang your head against the wall, tough, like platformer,
6184600	6188360	but it's, you know, kind of one of those, I would compare it a lot to super meat boy,
6188360	6189640	like back when it was good.
6189640	6192120	Um, to like, you know, Oh, just one more.
6192120	6194600	I'm gonna try this level one more time, one more time.
6195640	6196840	I'm going to beat it this time.
6196840	6198600	It's it's that whole kind of thing.
6198600	6199800	It's a neat game.
6199800	6201400	So, all right.
6201400	6206840	Um, moving on, let's talk about a remaster that didn't happen, but man, I wish we
6207160	6210680	wish it would have, and that is a GoldenEye 007.
6210680	6213240	It was originally going to be for Xbox live arcade.
6213240	6217720	Now, please don't confuse this with the version of GoldenEye that ended up being on the Wii
6217720	6219800	by Activision a little bit later.
6219800	6224200	Um, this is not that, uh, this was something else that was supposed to happen, uh, that
6224200	6227880	was actually, and some of the footage has actually been released now.
6227880	6233640	Uh, so there's a YouTube out there where somebody is actually playing it through an emulator.
6233640	6237560	So they're actually able to see it in like 4k resolution and 60 frames a second, but
6237560	6239320	you can tell it's a 360 game.
6239320	6241000	I mean it, but it still looks really good.
6241000	6243480	It looks even better than the Nintendo 64 game.
6243480	6247160	And they even do some multiplayer in it, same screen multiplayer, which is how most people
6247160	6251800	remember GoldenEye 007 was playing it with friends at a party or in a college dorm or
6251800	6252840	something like that.
6252840	6259400	Uh, this whole exercise was from 2007 because a rare of being owned by Microsoft developed
6259400	6262760	the HD remaster of the Nintendo 64 classic.
6262760	6266440	Unfortunately, thanks to copyright disputes, it didn't happen.
6266440	6267560	That's a bummer.
6267560	6271800	Um, of course we got the Activision version, which, um, for the Wii was, you know, the
6271800	6273320	Wii didn't have a lot of great shooters.
6273320	6275960	And apparently this, I didn't play a lot of it.
6275960	6280600	I think I played it at E3 real quick one year, but, um, apparently a lot of people said it,
6280600	6281640	it really wasn't bad.
6281640	6284920	Like it could have been a lot worse as far as like remasters go.
6284920	6288120	And they did a pretty decent job on the Wii, but I think there's a lot of people that want
6288120	6290120	to see what Rare themselves would have done.
6290120	6292040	And this is, this is certainly it.
6292040	6300920	So, um, there's rumors that they're going to release this in 2021 as some type of Xbox
6300920	6301720	thing.
6301720	6305560	Um, Hey, if they get the licensing and all that stuff worked out, go off.
6305560	6310200	Like, Hey, if they added that to game pass, that's just another cool thing on game pass
6310200	6310920	in my opinion.
6310920	6316520	So, um, yeah, especially since how many same room multiplayer games are there anymore?
6316520	6317880	There's so few, right?
6318440	6324840	So anyway, um, dark Tetsuya says, I do believe the Wii version got re-released on PS3 and
6324840	6325880	360 as well.
6325880	6326360	Did it?
6326360	6329720	I only ever remember the Wii one, but you're probably, you're probably right.
6329720	6331960	I just remember the, the motion control.
6331960	6334120	Of course, that was the big thing they were pushing, right?
6334120	6338920	Because on the Wii and in some games did this very well where you would, you'd point at
6338920	6342280	the screen to shoot and it was almost like using a mouse and keyboard.
6342280	6343720	It was like mouse and controller.
6343720	6345240	It was really weird, but it worked.
6345240	6345880	It worked really well.
6345880	6346520	Yeah.
6346520	6351320	So, uh, some games did this better than others, but, um, the golden eye remaster was one of
6351320	6352120	them that did it pretty well.
6352920	6354040	All right, moving on.
6354040	6354680	Dark Sakura.
6357560	6364840	A little discussion, um, especially with, uh, the particular game, Astral Chain.
6364840	6368280	Uh, Platinum said that Nintendo is the owner of the IP.
6368920	6374680	Um, this came after fans noticed that the game's copyright had, that there was a change
6374680	6375640	to the game's copyright.
6376280	6385720	Um, so, uh, platinum, um, had said before that it was co-owned by itself and Nintendo
6385720	6391080	in addition to the, to them having, uh, uh, the game's publishing rights.
6391080	6396360	Um, and they had even talked about one day it might come, you know, to non-Nintendo platforms,
6396360	6400440	but basically there was the change and the copyright notice had been modified to remove
6400440	6401800	the mention of platinum games.
6402360	6409640	And so they came right out and says, it's as it looks, it is Nintendo and it's on their
6409640	6411400	website as it's Nintendo.
6412120	6416600	Um, and they say that right now platinum games is not in a position to answer the question,
6416600	6419480	uh, to clarify anything about that change in ownership.
6420920	6425080	I wonder if Nintendo is planning on doing something with it, hence the change.
6425080	6425880	It's interesting.
6425880	6426680	Maybe.
6426680	6427640	Maybe.
6427640	6432920	Um, speaking of platinum and Nintendo, how about an update on Bayonetta 3, platinum?
6432920	6437000	Like, I'm sure I'm not the only one to ask this, but, uh, it's been a little while since
6437000	6438520	we heard anything about Bayonetta 3.
6438520	6444200	It'd be crappy if Sega does get sold, you know, to someone who's not Nintendo.
6445400	6447560	Um, I don't, I doubt they'll do that.
6447560	6450440	I think the agreement would already be in writing.
6450440	6451480	I don't think they'd be able to do it.
6451480	6452520	I mean, I guess anything's possible.
6452520	6453320	I don't know.
6453320	6457720	But, um, still I'm all about take the time to get it right.
6457720	6459000	You know, don't rush the game.
6459000	6460040	There's been a pandemic.
6460040	6461000	I get all that.
6461000	6465320	Uh, still just a little, a little teaser, a new little update would be, would be wonderful.
6465320	6467880	That would, that would give me the energy I need to get through the year.
6468520	6472120	So hopefully the Switch is just setting up for a badass year.
6472120	6475000	Maybe Bayonetta 3 got pushed to be a Switch Pro game.
6475000	6480920	One can dream, but can you imagine that the new Zelda and a new Metroid game, like all
6480920	6484360	hitting at once, like, Oh, that'd be such, that'd be such a hot year.
6484360	6487960	Like if that's what the Switch Pro's lining up, that's a hot launch lineup.
6487960	6491800	I I'm, I'm fan, but I'm going to admit, I fully admit I am fanboying.
6491800	6496840	None of this is based in reality whatsoever, but what a hot lineup that would be.
6496840	6497960	That's for sure.
6497960	6498360	All right.
6498920	6500280	Uh, moving on Loki.
6501720	6502200	Yeah.
6502200	6505320	So, uh, some more cyberpunk updates.
6505320	6510840	So we talked about how there was the 1.1 update, which did fix some stuff, but also
6510840	6513000	introduced some game breaking bugs.
6513000	6520360	So now there's the 1.11 update that will fix those game breaking bugs that they last
6520360	6521640	patch introduced.
6521640	6525640	So they went ahead and released those already, the hot fix for that.
6525640	6530040	And it's taking care of some of the issues that were in that.
6530040	6532920	There's also some more updates coming as well.
6533480	6535880	Second one's due out in a few weeks.
6535880	6540680	So, um, we'll have to wait and see what that improves as well, but at least to see
6540680	6544280	that they're addressing some of the issues like they had with, uh, the hollow calls,
6544280	6545480	not coming through and stuff like that.
6546200	6549720	Um, and then on a completely different topic.
6550360	6558840	So there's been mods for cyberpunk 2077 that allows you to, um, change, uh, who the
6558840	6561240	different joy toys are in the game.
6561240	6565240	So those are the like, uh, cybernetic prostitutes.
6565240	6572120	And so of course, since Johnny Silverhand is in the game, they've went ahead and swapped
6572120	6573240	out the character.
6573240	6579240	Um, that's normally the quote unquote, joy toy and put Keanu Reeves in there.
6579240	6583880	Or you can also, uh, put in, uh, one of the other characters that they had in there as
6583880	6584200	well.
6584200	6590280	But Loki, Loki, Loki, was there any doubt that once we knew that cyberpunk would, would
6590280	6595160	yes, be a PC game and that yes, Keanu Reeves would be in the game.
6595160	6600360	Was there any doubt that the modding community was going to come along and be like, how long
6600360	6602200	until I can fuck Keanu Reeves?
6604440	6605960	Like, are we shocked?
6605960	6606600	Are we shocked?
6606600	6607160	I am.
6607160	6607560	I'm not.
6608200	6613240	Apparently though, what is interesting though is apparently they have removed that mod.
6613240	6616200	Um, it's so it is not available.
6616200	6616920	Nothing.
6616920	6618360	Nothing has ever truly removed.
6619320	6626920	So Nexus, Nexus mods did take it down, but you know, um, I'm sure you can find it out
6626920	6627420	there.
6628040	6631000	So, uh, Nexus mods is having a week, aren't they?
6632120	6632360	Yeah.
6632360	6633640	Apparently, well, CG.
6633640	6637720	So it came to the way it got taken down as it came to a CD project.
6637720	6638920	Red's attention.
6638920	6644040	Uh, the studio had said that our most important rule regarding user generated content, uh,
6644040	6647800	game mods in particular is that it can't be harmful towards others.
6647800	6653320	In the case of model swaps, especially those involved in explicit situations, it can be
6653320	6659000	perceived as such by people who lent us their parents for, as a Korean characters in, uh,
6659000	6660600	cyberpunk 2077.
6660600	6661400	Sorry, internet.
6661400	6664520	You'll just have to fuck your Keanu Reeves body pillow you bought on wish.
6665320	6665800	I mean,
6668920	6673720	I mean, whatever it could have been a lot worse.
6673720	6676520	He was so clothed in the scenes from what I saw.
6676520	6680920	But then again, the video that they were showing a lot of that was, uh, cut and like blacked
6680920	6681160	out.
6681160	6684520	But, um, I mean, it's just a model swap.
6684520	6687800	So, but I'm sure it can be much worse.
6688680	6691160	And of course, just wait, it's early.
6691160	6693320	If that game's only been out a couple of months, it's early.
6693320	6697000	No, the correct way to phrase that is not, it could be much worse.
6697000	6697560	It is.
6697560	6698760	It will be much worse.
6700600	6701160	It's true.
6701960	6702680	Very true.
6703240	6707320	Let's revisit the story in six months and see what perverse things the internet has
6707320	6708120	come up with now.
6710040	6710540	Yeah.
6711480	6712280	All right.
6712280	6717560	Well, Hey, now that the, now that they have the, the three model out there, I mean, I'm
6717560	6721000	sure it'll be a matter of time before we see him added to the Skyrim or something like
6721000	6721500	that.
6722680	6724920	All right, let's move on.
6724920	6726920	Uh, let's see.
6726920	6731080	Oh, a comment from Marissa Meisel in our chat who says the union has been taking things
6731080	6735480	like this seriously, not just because of funny sex things, but so actors are exploited
6735480	6737080	for things they weren't paid for.
6737080	6743000	You know, that is, I I've heard about that in regards to who was in the game.
6744200	6744600	Heavy.
6744600	6746680	Was it heavy rain with the shower scene?
6747240	6748040	Was that Elliot?
6748040	6749240	Was that Elliot Page?
6749240	6750440	Was it somebody else?
6750440	6750920	No.
6750920	6752920	Elliot Page was in the sequel.
6752920	6757080	She was in the, um, Oh gosh, I don't remember what it was.
6757160	6757960	With like, uh,
6760840	6761800	why do I remember?
6762520	6763320	Why do I remember?
6764440	6770440	Remember it's he now, but yes, I understand when the, in the game, but, um, let's see,
6770440	6777560	Elliot Page, there was like a shower scene or something and they had rendered breasts
6778360	6785400	and that was really infuriating to, um, Elliot Page because obviously
6785400	6786840	It was beyond two souls.
6787560	6788920	That's his beyond two souls.
6788920	6789880	Thank you.
6789880	6793720	And, um, that was not part of the agreement basically.
6793720	6799720	And so when that, even though that wasn't in the game, like I think modders found that
6799720	6806600	and that infuriated, um, that camp, uh, Elliot pages, you know, and, uh, his representation
6806600	6807480	and so forth.
6807480	6812280	Um, and so I, and I believe this is that kind of issue that Marissa is bringing up in chat
6812280	6817480	as well is that, yeah, you got to be very careful when you have these likenesses in
6817480	6820520	the game, what you can and can't render.
6820520	6826520	Um, unfortunately, um, you know, the modding community, you can't stop them.
6826520	6830360	That's and that's the, that's modders going to mod.
6830360	6830920	Yeah.
6830920	6835720	So I think it also goes to like, but, but how much ammunition did you give them?
6835720	6836360	Right.
6836360	6843640	In the case of beyond two souls and Elliot, um, it was, you know, the breasts were rendered
6843640	6844680	in the game, I guess.
6844680	6848200	And this whole thing, even though they weren't shown, they were rendered, but it gave the
6848200	6852680	modders ammunition because it's like, Oh, we don't have to invent breasts because they're
6852680	6853720	in the game.
6853720	6860760	Um, but in the case of, uh, um, Keanu Reeves, I'm sure his dong was not rendered for the
6860760	6861400	game.
6861400	6863480	So they, but it's probably not even shown, right.
6863480	6866120	They probably just do like more of a suggestive sexual scene.
6866680	6866920	I don't know.
6866920	6867880	I've played the mod.
6867880	6870040	I'm not going to, but, um, yeah.
6871720	6872440	Uh, interesting.
6872440	6876840	Bobby Blackwell reminds us, uh, the Sims is an AO game because of mods.
6876840	6878360	So says former lawyers.
6878360	6878920	Yeah.
6878920	6879160	Yeah.
6879880	6880760	So interesting.
6880760	6881080	Interesting.
6881720	6882360	All right.
6882360	6883560	Anyhow, let's move on.
6883560	6889640	Uh, I got one more story for you guys, and this is about, um, uh, Sonic changing voice
6889640	6890200	actors.
6890200	6892040	And this is, this is kind of a big deal.
6892040	6896520	Like, uh, when David Hader left the role of solid snake, it's kind of a big thing.
6896520	6901080	So Roger Craig Smith is the name of the guy who's been voicing Sonic the Hedgehog for
6901080	6903800	quite some time and on like 10 years.
6903800	6904600	Right.
6904600	6908200	So on Twitter, he mentioned, uh, no more.
6908200	6913800	Uh, he does say that, um, uh, I guess a Sega rep has commented to some gaming blogs that
6913800	6915960	of course they're thankful to Roger.
6915960	6921240	Um, but, uh, and nothing was said, of course, openly about why is the change going on?
6921720	6928040	Uh, but fans on Twitter are speculating that Ben Schwartz from the movie is going to be
6928040	6929000	taking over the role.
6929560	6933640	Moving forward, which makes sense because I know they're about to shoot that sequel
6933640	6938680	because I saw one of the actresses on some talk show circuit thing and that's supposed
6938680	6939160	to be in it.
6939160	6941160	And she was commenting on that March.
6941160	6941720	Yeah.
6941720	6945400	So it's not surprising that Ben Schwartz is coming back.
6945400	6949240	Um, but that is, you know, it does create kind of that disparity between movie role
6949240	6953640	and everything else role where, but I mean, at the same time, what Mark Hamill was playing
6953640	6956680	the joker in the cartoons for years and years and years and years and years.
6956680	6959560	That didn't stop Heath Ledger from the movies and all this other stuff, even though Mark
6959560	6961640	Hamill is a perfectly fine actor.
6961640	6965000	Um, but anyway, it's such as the industry.
6965000	6970520	Um, so Sega says, you know, Roger's portrayal of Sonic is one that fans are sure to remember.
6970520	6973800	He brought the character to life that it, uh, and then the unsaid thing is, you know,
6973800	6975720	but he's still fired and let go.
6976120	6977160	He was very happy though.
6977160	6980920	Roger Craig Smith was very thankful for all the outpouring of love that he got on social
6980920	6983880	media and lots of people saying nice things, um, about him.
6983880	6985080	So there was that as well.
6985720	6990520	So, um, also I need to make sure I say this at some point.
6990520	6996520	Um, also in a voice actor and actress news, uh, this is really, um, sad, but I have to
6996520	7001560	mention this somewhere in the show and tip our hats to, uh, Jeanette mouse, who was an
7001560	7006360	actor actually for resident evil village, uh, who passed away at 39.
7006360	7011480	Um, Jeanette played and I I'm sorry, I don't know the game, the village very well, but
7011480	7016040	she played one of, uh, I guess, witches in the resident evil village.
7016040	7016600	I think it's the new one.
7018120	7019560	Um, the giant woman.
7020280	7023480	Is it really supposed to be the new resident evil demo just came out.
7024280	7027080	Oh, why did I think this was the last one?
7027720	7028200	Wow.
7028200	7029160	That's the new one.
7029160	7030040	Oh my gosh.
7030040	7032680	And that same week that everybody's going crazy.
7032680	7033880	Yeah, she was 39.
7033880	7038760	Um, she was in some films called your sister, sister, and my effortless brilliance, um,
7038760	7041320	which was a movie that she actually co-wrote as well.
7041320	7047240	And, uh, no, uh, information has been said as to why she passed, but, uh, the Hollywood
7047240	7052360	reporter is saying she, she was fighting colon cancer, um, for the past eight months, but
7052360	7058040	they haven't said that that was because she may have may have contracted COVID and when
7058040	7062440	the cancer is going, you know, we don't know, but, um, still sad all the same.
7062440	7064840	I didn't realize it was that same character.
7065560	7066200	My gosh.
7066200	7066680	Right.
7066680	7072520	And you know, and that's, that's right when, you know, she's getting, you know, say what
7072520	7076040	you will about all those memes and all that stuff that's out there about that character,
7076040	7080360	but that's, that's just great press for that actress.
7080360	7085400	And so that really, really is horrible that she was taken from us really at her prime
7085400	7086120	with that.
7086120	7087560	So it's very sad.
7088120	7089960	So, um, tipping our hat for that.
7090760	7091160	All right.
7092200	7095480	Let's move on and get into our listener round table.
7095480	7099240	So we're going to talk a little bit with our emails and any questions that you guys have
7099240	7102840	in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
7102840	7105720	If you have any questions for us, we're happy to take those on.
7105720	7110280	So, uh, meanwhile, let's open up the mailbag participate at orange launch radio.com is
7110280	7114360	the place where you can send your emails every week and a dark soccer is going to open up
7114360	7115320	ye old mailbag.
7116280	7117160	Damn.
7117160	7118520	Um, so, okay.
7119240	7121560	Oh, it's, I'm not going to open spammer again.
7121560	7121800	Okay.
7121800	7122280	There we go.
7122840	7126440	I think we left it up because it was funny, but the emails are still taking like forever
7126440	7127480	to load for me.
7127480	7127720	Yeah.
7128520	7132840	So I always saw one in there and it was really short, but I'll, I'll let you see if there's
7132840	7133400	two.
7133400	7133640	Okay.
7133640	7134680	Then another one must've just come in.
7134680	7140520	But, but the problem is, is that, that, uh, the, the mailbox has been taking like a really
7140520	7142360	long time to open lately on this computer.
7142360	7143640	I mean, this computer is ready to go.
7144360	7146520	Um, oh, I did though.
7146520	7146760	Sorry.
7146760	7151080	I just want to say DJ Rama S in regards to the last story, wanted to add Capcom.
7151080	7153000	Oh, I thought you said Capcom did.
7153000	7156760	Oh, well, Capcom better put an in memoriam to her in the game.
7156760	7157560	Yes, they should.
7157560	7157800	Sorry.
7157800	7161720	When I first read that, I heard Capcom did, but he's, he's saying that he wants to see
7161720	7162840	that in the game and I would agree.
7162840	7163960	That would be very appropriate.
7163960	7164840	I hope they do that.
7164840	7165560	Sorry, Jamie.
7165560	7166200	Yeah.
7166200	7169560	Well, at any rate, while I'm waiting for this to load, I did find something funny going
7169560	7171560	back to the whole Reddit army thing.
7171560	7171800	Sure.
7172360	7173960	Um, now they're looking at commodities.
7174520	7177800	So silver prices are jumping to a high.
7179560	7180520	That was like commodity.
7180520	7182280	Oh, those things.
7182280	7182680	Okay.
7183880	7184200	Yeah.
7184200	7187320	So now they're looking to, uh, to silver.
7187320	7195160	They basically bought shares in, um, an Australian, uh, uh, mining firm and they bought big and
7195160	7198040	they like, like they leapt to 15%.
7198680	7199720	So it was pretty crazy.
7199720	7200440	Why silver?
7200440	7203720	Um, because they're shorting that as well.
7203720	7204200	Yeah.
7204200	7206440	Oh, okay.
7207400	7214280	So right now it's at 28.99 an ounce and this email still hasn't fucking loaded.
7214280	7215960	Time to melt down all the jewelry.
7218040	7222440	No, the, this, the stupid email now I just loaded.
7222440	7222680	Okay.
7222680	7223720	And it's kind of a big one.
7223720	7228840	So dear OLR, I just wanted to note that I thought you guys did an incredible job explaining
7228840	7230760	sexuality and how it relates to furries.
7230760	7233720	In addition to the fandom, not being purely a sexual thing.
7234520	7238760	Jamie is the word community using the word community was appropriate as that's exactly
7238760	7242840	what a furry is a community that shares a mutual love of anthropomorphic animals across
7242840	7244680	multiple media forms.
7244680	7247560	Yes, there are sex and that isn't what defines it.
7248280	7252600	Ask yourself what may be going on behind closed doors at your local anime con.
7252600	7257960	Let people be people, whatever they, uh, whether they have sexual attractions or not.
7257960	7263880	Hell, I'll admit that Star Fox has had me hot and bothered for as long as I can remember,
7263880	7268680	but I also won't judge you for eyeing a poster of Faye Valentine from Cowboy Bebop.
7269640	7274600	One more thought, honestly, the best way to understand furry is just to go to a furry
7274600	7276920	convention when it's safe to have cons again.
7276920	7281400	I identified with furries for a long time, but didn't really get it until I went to my
7281400	7284200	first Anthrocon in 2013.
7284200	7287720	Friends were made at those cons that I'll have for life.
7287800	7292360	And the level of love and acceptance I get from that community is wholly different.
7292360	7296200	It's comfort I can't have with my friends who don't understand why I find fursuiting
7296200	7296840	so magical.
7297400	7301880	I compare it to other conventions where you go because you are a fan of an anime or comic
7301880	7302920	book series.
7302920	7305960	In furry, we're fans of each other and the characters we create.
7305960	7307400	That's what makes it special.
7307400	7311000	I implore you to check out a convention even if your interest is only fleeting.
7311000	7312600	It just might ignite a spark.
7312600	7314440	Thanks for reading Garth Wolf.
7314440	7316200	P.S. Rob, bring back guys on the show.
7316600	7320040	I had a feeling this email when it was the first paragraph might have been from this
7320040	7325640	individual, but I'm happy you were happy with the way we represented that on the show.
7325640	7328520	And I don't think there's a lot else to comment on that email.
7328520	7331880	I think you made a request there that I think is very fair.
7331880	7333640	So that's that's really all there is to say on that.
7334280	7336520	Well, now I'm waiting five years for this other one to open.
7337640	7342360	How about anyone got any stories while I'm waiting for this damn email?
7342360	7345480	Well, I was also going to go to chat and look at some comments there in our chat room.
7345880	7350440	And Tiger Con says there's also people out there who don't find humans attractive, but
7350440	7353240	find anthropomorphic characters attractive.
7353240	7355400	I don't think it's a link.
7355400	7358680	I think maybe kink or anything, but some people do feel that way.
7358680	7365480	So as long as you have consent, as long as you're not hurting anyone or pushing it on
7365480	7366120	anyone else.
7368920	7372280	As long as everybody is the age of consent, I think this is another important thing to
7372280	7372840	put out there.
7372840	7373960	Anything I might be missing?
7376040	7378920	So have a safe word.
7378920	7379420	All right.
7380840	7385000	I was going to say, though, about the whole like because in the email it went into, you
7385000	7387080	know, let me have the furry thing.
7387080	7389080	You have your Cowboy Bebop poster.
7389080	7393640	Or I would argue, since we just brought up that character from Resident Evil, I saw all
7393640	7395320	sorts of things on Twitter about that.
7395320	7398680	So everybody's got their thing.
7399640	7400440	We'll leave it at that.
7401720	7402360	Go ahead, Jamie.
7403400	7404600	It's loaded, by the way.
7405480	7406360	It still hasn't loaded?
7406920	7408680	No, I can get to it.
7408680	7411160	I finally started watching Drag Race, though.
7411800	7412440	Oh, did you?
7413400	7418600	Yeah, I have one person I loathe and one person I love already.
7419880	7421400	I can guess both of those.
7422120	7423240	Okay, who do you think I hate?
7424120	7424520	Candy.
7424520	7425400	That's who everybody hates.
7425400	7425900	Yeah.
7426520	7427640	Who do you think I love?
7427640	7429400	Tamisha Iman, because that's the correct answer.
7431640	7432140	Gottmik.
7433000	7433800	Gottmik's pretty cool.
7434600	7437240	Yeah, I think the winner is very, very obvious, though.
7437240	7439000	And it's none of those people we just named.
7439000	7440840	But anyway, we'll see.
7440840	7441080	All right.
7441080	7443480	Anyhow, let's move on this email.
7443480	7445640	I got the email up because I get them on my phone as well.
7447080	7451960	This person did not sign the email and I don't feel comfortable reading the tube line because
7451960	7454440	I don't know what this person prefers to be called.
7454440	7456520	So I will call this anonymous email.
7456520	7459960	And also, just a reminder, if you want us to read your name on air, which we're happy
7459960	7463720	to do, don't forget to sign the email with whatever you want to be called and help me
7464680	7466760	out with a pronunciation if it's tough.
7467800	7469560	But this is unsigned and it's very simple.
7469560	7470280	It's one sentence.
7471160	7474360	I would think it would be sent from the phone if it didn't.
7474360	7476440	But it doesn't say sent with my iPhone at the bottom.
7477720	7481080	The question is, what is the best song in video games?
7482360	7485960	From our anonymous listener, what is the best song in video games?
7486840	7487320	You know what?
7488520	7493000	It's a very basic, simple question, but one that we haven't touched on in a long time.
7493080	7496680	Well, I don't think the emailer expects us to give the definitive answer.
7496680	7499080	But what is our best, our favorite song in video games?
7499080	7501320	What is the best song to us in video games?
7503000	7504920	I have some answers, but I'll let you guys go first.
7508680	7516840	I'm trying to remember if it was used in the game.
7516840	7518520	I think it was used in the game.
7518520	7527400	I want to say that, well, Info High was in the Macross Plus movie.
7527400	7534200	But I do believe that it was in, yeah, it was in one of the games,
7534200	7536520	Uta Macross, Somafo De Culture.
7538280	7540360	But I can use that song because it was in a game.
7541160	7541800	I'm kidding.
7542600	7549160	Um, honestly, I don't know that there's a best game, a best song,
7549160	7554600	because there's so many different genres that I can't really choose one.
7555720	7557240	Okay, this is easy for me. I'll do it.
7559320	7565400	So for me, the Final Fantasy XIV soundtrack has been a huge reason why I stay with that game.
7565400	7567160	That's a really good soundtrack.
7567160	7572920	Soken has done amazing things with the legacy that Nobuo Imatsu started
7572920	7574920	and really taken it in a modern direction.
7574920	7577000	And honestly, if you're going to start anywhere,
7577000	7579400	start with the prologue from Realm Reborn.
7579400	7581880	Start with the basic, like the crystal theme.
7584120	7587800	Listen to that because that is the character creation music in Final Fantasy XIV.
7587800	7592200	And it is so, like, it is the perfect version of that song.
7593080	7594600	Literally the perfect version of that song.
7594600	7595960	And it's in Final Fantasy XIV.
7595960	7597800	And that, you know, there's other stuff.
7597800	7599960	Like there's some primal fights that have amazing music
7599960	7602520	and there's just so many different varieties and genres.
7602520	7608440	I think Soken is the best video game composer we have out there right now.
7608440	7610600	And it's a damn shame he's only doing one game.
7611720	7619480	Fingers, toes and everything else I have crossed that perhaps he is doing Final Fantasy XVI.
7619480	7623320	But that's a lot of work for one person because XIV is enough.
7623320	7625480	Like there's hundreds of tracks in XIV.
7625560	7627720	But I think he's a brilliant, brilliant person.
7628360	7631960	I'm actually going to go with a song from a game that I don't really care for,
7631960	7634200	but it introduced me to one of my favorite singers.
7635240	7637320	So Kiss Me Goodbye by Angela Aki.
7639800	7641720	She's got such a fantastic voice.
7641720	7645000	She's actually, I think, in the US now finishing up some music production.
7645720	7649960	But she's just one of my favorite vocalists ever.
7649960	7654120	And I even remembered reading an interview where she said she
7654120	7657160	had a dream of playing at the Budokan.
7657800	7661320	She had actually been to a Sheena Ringo concert, who's another singer I like.
7662920	7665400	And she got her start with Final Fantasy games.
7667000	7670680	And was a year later, she's playing at Budokan.
7670680	7674200	Yeah, it's interesting to see how like the music from video games
7674200	7676760	have really influenced some of the artists today.
7676760	7681560	Like that Porter Robinson has some pretty good music CDs and stuff.
7681560	7684840	And my understanding is he's influenced by Beatmania and DDR.
7685960	7690920	So he is an artist that kind of represents a lot of that stuff that we all loved,
7691480	7693800	when we were in our 20s, although this guy's younger.
7693800	7696440	So I imagine he was more of a kid when he heard a lot of this stuff.
7696440	7698040	But I just think that's really cool.
7698040	7700920	And then you listen to his stuff and you can hear it.
7700920	7703160	You can hear the Beatmania influence in a lot of his music.
7704680	7708920	I will go back to something else, which I'm going to probably go on record saying
7708920	7713240	it probably has one of my overall favorite video game soundtracks is Chrono Trigger.
7715320	7719480	Because too far away times will always make me choke up a little bit,
7719480	7721720	just somewhere a little bit in my heart.
7721720	7725880	And the feel of the theme of Zeal, our shotless theme.
7727480	7729960	That one also is one of my favorites.
7729960	7733640	So I didn't quite get to finish, but I was going to say, no, it's okay.
7733640	7738120	It's okay, because you kind of didn't get your answers out there.
7738360	7738840	Until now.
7738840	7743400	But I was going to say, so if I was to get away from the MMOs a little bit,
7743400	7746200	especially because I can't really pinpoint a specific song in that game,
7746200	7747960	I was going to say Scar of Time.
7749080	7754200	Even though Chrono Cross is not the greatest game of my life,
7755160	7761960	that intro and that song were stunning, especially that song.
7761960	7766760	And that's just, I think, a definitive all-time classic game song.
7768120	7771080	My third and final answer for this question would be,
7771080	7774280	because I would say a song that is extremely versatile,
7774280	7779880	meaning like an 8-bit song that has just been reimagined time and time again in glorious ways.
7779880	7781880	And this song is amazing.
7781880	7783960	Every single time I've heard it reinterpreted,
7784520	7786280	I think it's a song that can't be bad,
7787400	7790920	would be the overworld theme from The Legend of Zelda, throwing it back.
7793400	7794760	How many times have we heard that song?
7795320	7796200	Remixed?
7796200	7796920	Orchestral?
7798840	7799880	Is it ever bad?
7799880	7802840	I mean, I guess maybe I'm challenging the internet with that question,
7802840	7803880	but you know what I mean?
7803880	7810120	Like that song is just so versatile and so brilliant.
7810120	7813960	Like it just, it represents my childhood, really.
7813960	7816120	So that would be my answer.
7816120	7818840	Loki, and I see the chat is lighting up on this.
7818840	7819880	I want to get to you guys too,
7819880	7823720	but Loki, I got to ask you the email question as well.
7823720	7825080	What's the best video game song?
7829080	7829720	I don't know.
7830280	7833240	I mean, there's lots of good stuff.
7833240	7834280	It's hard to pick the best.
7837640	7838200	I don't know.
7838200	7840920	Like if I'm going to go back to like DDR stuff,
7840920	7842760	I'd say anything by Naoki.
7842760	7845320	So I don't know the one that kind of stands up to me
7845320	7848920	that used to play a lot on my cabinet is D2R.
7849880	7852120	That's kind of encompassing,
7852120	7856760	like kind of the Naoki song style with like a Brilliant 2U,
7856760	7858520	B4U or anything like that.
7858520	7859240	But, you know.
7859240	7862120	Did you hear that Step Maniacs has new Naoki songs?
7862120	7863080	Like they got him over there.
7863080	7864840	I know Step Maniacs is awesome.
7864840	7865720	I know, good for them.
7866360	7866840	Good for them.
7866840	7867640	They have a lot.
7867640	7868440	I mean, they're pretty much,
7868440	7871320	they have the whole song library now of the whole Bomani series,
7871320	7874600	because it's like, it's all being brought back in there.
7874600	7877080	But yeah, like I know he's got new stuff in there.
7877640	7878600	So it's pretty cool.
7879000	7880680	All right, let me get some of the chat answers.
7880680	7883000	You guys are blowing up chat in the best way
7883000	7884520	and you guys have some great answers here.
7885160	7885800	Let's see.
7885800	7887240	DragonSamurai said,
7887960	7889480	best song in video games?
7889480	7892840	Opera song in Final Fantasy 3 or 6 for the Super Nintendo?
7892840	7893240	Yes.
7893240	7895400	I mean, that is, you want to talk Final Fantasy?
7895400	7899720	Like that moment changed games, truly.
7900280	7902520	And the song was a huge part of that.
7903240	7904280	Some other answers here.
7904840	7908040	Azette says, a thousand words from Final Fantasy X-2,
7908040	7908920	the best performed.
7910360	7911640	Our pal Bobby Blackall says,
7911640	7913880	Persona 5, wake up, get up, get out there.
7915560	7916040	Let's see.
7916040	7917400	Black Compat says,
7917400	7920520	I absolutely love the Last of Us Part 1 soundtrack.
7920520	7921800	I have that one on vinyl.
7923000	7924200	ZenMonkey11 says,
7924200	7926600	the instrumental at the start of Streets of Rage.
7926600	7929240	I heard that at night on a cool windy day and it gave me life.
7929240	7931160	I also love the Killer Instinct song.
7931160	7933960	Oh my God, Killer Instinct's got such a good soundtrack.
7934040	7934600	Hell yeah.
7936360	7936860	Let's see.
7938840	7939880	Some other comments here.
7940920	7942840	Story about Killer Instinct 2.
7942840	7943320	What's that?
7943880	7945960	When Dan and I were still just friends online,
7945960	7947640	I was telling him how much I liked.
7948680	7952440	I think it was Orchid's theme in Killer Instinct 2.
7953560	7958040	And so he kept restarting his game over and over
7958040	7961240	so he could get me a WAV file recorded of it.
7961560	7962060	Hmm.
7962600	7965240	And I still have that file somewhere.
7965240	7965740	Nice.
7967800	7971240	ActDef kind of tried to rephrase the question a little bit.
7972360	7974280	And I don't know if this would give you guys different answers,
7974280	7976200	but let me read ActDef's version of the question.
7976840	7980600	What was the game that made you notice video game music
7980600	7983000	as something more than just background noise?
7983640	7985320	That's a neat question.
7985320	7985880	I like that.
7985880	7987080	A little different spin on it.
7987080	7990840	What's the game that made you notice video game music?
7991160	7993800	I would have to throw way fucking back
7994440	7998680	because remember, before I grew up on Nintendo Entertainment System,
7998680	8001560	there was a period of time between the ages of about five and nine
8001560	8003640	where I grew up on the Commodore 64.
8004280	8007400	And therefore, one of the first background songs I noticed
8007400	8011080	that really made me notice the music was Pitfall 2, The Lost Caverns.
8011080	8016200	And that was one of the first times a video game had a static song playing behind it.
8016200	8019320	Because think about most of those Atari 2600 games back in the day.
8019320	8020360	They were very like,
8020360	8025400	boop, blip, brrr, like some of those unique noises the 2600 made.
8025400	8029960	And it wasn't until you had Pitfall 2, specifically The Lost Caverns,
8029960	8031400	where you had that theme song.
8031400	8035880	Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
8035880	8038520	And then when you would get hit by something,
8038520	8041720	then the game would suddenly go into a minor key.
8041720	8044920	Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
8044920	8046360	Like it got all sad.
8046360	8048120	And it's hard not to notice that.
8048120	8051880	And I would say that was the first for me.
8051880	8052680	How about you guys?
8053320	8055880	The game that made you notice video game music.
8056600	8059080	Bobby says we're going to get DMCA'd.
8059080	8060200	No, we're not.
8060200	8061240	I used to always.
8061240	8063640	No, it wasn't that it was necessarily music,
8063640	8065160	but the intro to Space Fury,
8065800	8072280	where it almost seemed to me like the alien guy who was taunting you was singing to you.
8073320	8075800	So that was one that did it for me early on.
8078520	8083800	There was even like a mousetrap.
8083800	8085800	I couldn't play it without the background music
8085800	8089000	because it was just sort of like set a rhythm to how I would play it.
8089000	8092200	And the music wasn't either that dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,
8092200	8093080	you know, over like that.
8094440	8097480	Because I'm just trying to think what else.
8099960	8103640	I guess if I was going to get into the Nintendo era of stuff,
8103640	8112280	it would probably have been playing through the Guardian Legend.
8112280	8116120	Yeah, because I had a killer soundtrack in it.
8116120	8117240	So underappreciated.
8117880	8119880	But actually, I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to go back.
8120440	8121880	I'm going to say it was R-Type.
8122600	8123400	Arcade R-Type.
8124840	8126840	Because I love the first level music for R-Type.
8127480	8132040	And that really made me just think this is what video game music is.
8132040	8137080	Yeah, I was going to say because Bobby in chat said there were some great
8137080	8139320	Commodore 64 tracks that slapped.
8139320	8142840	Yeah, another one that honestly you wouldn't even think this,
8142840	8145960	but Dragon's Lair and Dragon's Lair 2,
8145960	8150120	which were both influenced by the original Dragon's Lair arcade game,
8150120	8152040	but they they're not a direct port of it,
8152040	8155320	because obviously the Commodore 64 cannot handle those types of graphics.
8155320	8158680	But the music in those games, especially the second one,
8158680	8161480	which I think was Escape from Singe's Castle or something like that,
8161480	8162920	is so good.
8163480	8167000	Like I remember being like seven and hearing that for the first time,
8167000	8168360	like just like going, whoa.
8168360	8172040	And this was the whole time when I was getting into music, like taking organ.
8172040	8173320	I didn't take piano lessons.
8173320	8176040	I took organ lessons because we had one of those like
8176040	8179640	70s Wurlitzer synthesizer like church organs in our house.
8180760	8184600	And it was awesome because that was the that was the thing people bought in the 70s
8184600	8188760	that would do like the the automatic bossa nova backing track by hitting the switch.
8188760	8191240	And then you do do do anyway.
8191240	8191880	So that was fun.
8192600	8194680	So Loki, anything for you?
8194680	8197160	The first game where you really noticed video game music?
8197880	8199720	Probably like the Legend of Zelda.
8199720	8201080	Yeah. Yeah.
8202280	8202780	For sure.
8203720	8204220	All right.
8205160	8207320	Marissa in chat kind of wondering aloud,
8207320	8211000	I'd love to know what the early composers in gaming were thinking,
8211000	8214760	because so many soundtracks are masterpieces and they had to keep in mind
8214760	8217400	how long people would be listening to these songs.
8218040	8218540	Yeah.
8219320	8221320	Surely someone's made a documentary on this,
8221320	8225320	but I would love to hear interviews with some of these like great song makers of old,
8225320	8228680	like, you know, Koji Kondo and, you know, the people that really brought us,
8228680	8232840	you know, a lot of the eight bit bit music that we're all naming here.
8233480	8238280	I think Bobby and Dragon Samael basically nailed it.
8238280	8242440	They were thinking we only have 10K of space for audio production.
8243080	8249560	And honestly, a lot of the early sound designers were really like,
8249560	8252520	let's make it sound good and make it work with the game and make it fit.
8252520	8253160	True.
8253160	8253660	True.
8254280	8257880	Now today is a different story, but.
8258680	8259180	Yeah.
8260120	8265240	And I think that some of like, I remember when I got to meet Koji Kondo in 2006
8266200	8271400	and I thanked him for, you know, prolonging my interest in music because he
8271400	8278840	did the music for a lot of games that, that were really, I would say inspiring for me
8278840	8280440	and the music has really stuck with me.
8280440	8283880	And I got to thank him at E3 that one year when they were doing what We Music.
8284760	8285260	Yeah.
8285720	8291880	Like the preview for We Music and he looked so surprised and delighted by it.
8291880	8296360	So I was like, I guess they never did think that it was going to happen.
8296360	8300200	And now, you know, just such talent in, in what he does.
8300200	8304600	And I'm even going to say that who, whoever's doing the music for Animal Crossing this time
8304600	8313480	around is really doing just, it's very interesting with Animal Crossing is that the music in this
8313480	8319800	particular one seems all like it's variations on the same theme, whether or not it's in the same
8320520	8325880	key or it has a switch, but it has like even my favorite music in the game, the five o'clock funk
8325880	8331880	is what I call it, has that intro, you know, thing as a lick in that tune.
8331880	8339320	And I, I really, I'm really looking forward to, not looking forward, but I really like
8339320	8343000	when there's that sort of a musical continuity in a game.
8343000	8343500	Yeah.
8344280	8347880	You know, I think Marissa kind of hearing all these answers and what the chat's saying about
8347880	8353480	the limitations is kind of having a wow moment and says in chat, Marissa again says limitations
8353480	8356520	can really help creativity explode sometimes.
8356520	8357560	Yeah, absolutely.
8357560	8358200	Absolutely.
8358200	8363720	And Dragon Samael kind of adds to that saying it's astounding though, when you're so limited
8363720	8366680	in what you can make, you had to get that hook right away.
8366680	8367800	That's another good point.
8367800	8369640	You had to go right into the hook.
8369640	8371960	So very, very interesting.
8371960	8374840	Have you seen what some cosplayers do on an incredible budget
8375560	8378840	and they do these amazing outfits that are all pretty much thrifted?
8378920	8386360	I mean, that, that right there, you know, people who I was actually watching, um, I,
8386360	8391720	I sometimes like to watch this tiny, tiny home videos and this one person took all of
8391720	8399160	the scrap from his, uh, barn and built his wife an office out of scrap.
8399160	8401400	But have you seen what La La Ri did on a budget?
8402200	8403000	I don't know who that is.
8404600	8405400	No, we love her.
8405400	8406040	We stan her.
8406040	8406600	She's great.
8406600	8408440	She's a, I don't know who that is.
8408440	8409240	Drag race.
8409240	8410760	I thought you watched drag race.
8410760	8411400	I just started.
8411400	8412600	I don't know all their names yet.
8412600	8413100	Okay.
8414440	8415480	You'll, you'll, you'll get there.
8415480	8418920	I don't know when I, I know they kicked off Elliot and then Elliot came back.
8418920	8419400	Yes.
8419400	8419640	All right.
8419640	8420040	You'll get there.
8420040	8420600	You'll get there.
8420600	8421160	All right.
8421160	8423160	Uh, moving on.
8423160	8427320	Um, and, uh, just because Sia Tabiri in chat says, ouch.
8427320	8429080	I said, I said, we stan her.
8429080	8431240	I'm just given a little bit of a hard time.
8431240	8433880	I can't, you know, do certain things either.
8433880	8434520	All right.
8434520	8435320	Anyway, moving on.
8435320	8437720	I don't want to spoil because I guess Jamie isn't all caught up yet.
8437720	8438220	All right.
8438280	8443080	Um, let's move on and talk about, uh, some last minute stories.
8443080	8445240	If you guys have anything else to, uh, add.
8447640	8447960	Yeah.
8447960	8453080	I was going to mention that, uh, the battle born servers have finally been deactivated.
8453080	8453580	Oh yeah.
8454920	8456120	Not playable at all.
8456120	8460520	Apparently even that, uh, extended to the single player portion of the game.
8461080	8465960	So you got yourself a wonderful little coffee or a coaster now.
8467800	8468520	Womp womp.
8469640	8470120	Yeah.
8470120	8476680	Thing random where apparently, uh, Pokemon red is still being played inside of someone's
8476680	8478120	Twitter at avatar.
8478120	8478520	Oh yeah.
8478520	8480600	We, we had the original story about that.
8480600	8482280	A couple is still going right.
8482280	8482840	Still going.
8482840	8483340	Yeah.
8484920	8485420	Interesting.
8487640	8488840	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
8488840	8489340	Yeah.
8491000	8492120	I didn't know that was still going on.
8494920	8496920	Anything else from Loki or dark saga?
8496920	8497880	That's all I had.
8499800	8503000	Um, uh, no, I didn't see anything.
8505720	8506600	All right.
8506600	8511640	Well then, uh, I guess we will wrap it up pixel boxes as porn went out, uh, with, uh,
8511640	8513320	pushing F for battle born in chat.
8514040	8514920	All right.
8514920	8515960	Uh, that's it.
8515960	8520840	We're going to wrap things up here and thank you guys so much for, uh, listening to our
8520840	8521320	show tonight.
8521320	8522280	We really appreciate it.
8522280	8524040	Thank you everybody for taking part.
8524040	8524760	Uh, thank you.
8524760	8525480	Thank you.
8525480	8528920	Um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio tonight, tell a friend
8528920	8529800	or two about the show.
8529800	8533240	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if
8533240	8535880	the voices aren't here, we can't put them out.
8535880	8539400	So, uh, tell your friends as long as they aren't shit bags, tell your friends.
8539400	8544680	And you know, you know, if you have a friend who's a shit bag, but invite your cool friends,
8544680	8549080	uh, to the show and, uh, hang out with us and, uh, yeah, well, it's a good way to spend
8549080	8552760	a Sunday night, uh, a nice five star review wherever you found the show, whether it's,
8552760	8558520	uh, iTunes or Spotify or wherever, uh, it goes a long way, a host on a site like Twitch
8558520	8560040	that goes a long way as well.
8560040	8565000	Uh, also, uh, uh, sharing on social media, uh, super appreciate that stuff.
8565000	8568440	Um, also I have to give a quick plug to the shop.
8568440	8572120	Uh, if you really enjoyed the show tonight and you want to, uh, buy some merchandise
8572120	8575880	that says VOG network or OLR on it, please take a moment to swing by the store.
8575880	8578680	vognetwork.com slash shop.
8578680	8582600	If you want to check out some stuff and yes, we will add some more merchandise to that
8582600	8584040	hopefully in the next month or so.
8584040	8585880	Um, just a few, a few more things for you guys to check out.
8585880	8588040	Someone wants her, her lady shirts.
8588040	8588440	Yeah.
8588440	8590360	So I said, give me some designs.
8590360	8591160	We'll get some shirts.
8591160	8591480	All right.
8591480	8594040	No, there's designs up there and there's no lady shirt for it.
8594040	8595240	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
8595240	8597560	I said I would add one of the designs to it, to a lady shirt.
8597560	8601800	So sure, of course, but it's, it's also my way to try to trick and get some more designs.
8602120	8603720	All right.
8603720	8605880	Oh, I'll work on something.
8605880	8606280	All right.
8606280	8606760	Sounds good.
8607320	8607720	All right.
8607720	8610360	Um, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
8610360	8612280	Um, Loki, we'll start with you.
8612280	8612920	Your final thought.
8613960	8616680	My final thought is diamond hands to the moon.
8619800	8625480	Uh, my final thought is, um, let's hope crypto coin takes off, except I only put in like
8625480	8626040	50 bucks.
8626040	8627320	I'm not expecting it to go anywhere.
8627320	8631400	Well, if you think about it, like with Doge, I mean, it's at 3 cents right now.
8631400	8635240	So even if it goes down to one cent, that's like, just that's two thirds of the money
8635240	8635720	they put in.
8635720	8638440	But that's not the crypto I invested in.
8638440	8642520	I knew that one would be too, you know, all over the map.
8642520	8647560	So, um, I, I did a different one that I just kind of did my own research and I was like,
8647560	8649720	all right, maybe this one will go up.
8649720	8651480	Kind of just playing with it a little bit.
8652120	8652360	All right.
8652360	8652760	We'll see.
8653800	8655640	Um, dark soccer, your final thought.
8656840	8659640	Um, I don't know.
8660120	8661720	I don't have thoughts anymore.
8661720	8667640	I have a series of random, uh, time has dissolved to the point where I no longer have coherent
8667640	8668120	thoughts.
8669000	8673000	I just say whatever the fuck happens to come out without even processing it, you know?
8673880	8682440	Um, yeah, I'm not ready for my staycation to be, be home, but I did have a little health
8682440	8685880	scare that I am glad everything came through just fine.
8685960	8690040	So, um, some people have been following me on Twitter and thank you for all the support
8690040	8690680	that you gave me.
8690680	8695240	Um, I had a little cancer scare, um, everything came back benign.
8695240	8696120	So, hey.
8696120	8697080	All right.
8699080	8701240	Um, all right, that's going to do it.
8701240	8704120	Thank you so much for listening to another episode of Orange Launch Radio and joining
8704120	8704600	us tonight.
8704600	8706280	We will be back here in seven days.
8706280	8709320	Yes, I understand there's stuff going on on TV, but too bad.
8709320	8711000	We're still doing our show as we always do.
8711000	8713080	So we will see you next week.
8713160	8714840	But until then, have a great week.
8714840	8715640	Happy gaming.
8715640	8716120	Good night.
8743320	8747000	Or vog network, but you know, they were all still true.
8750040	8754120	See you next week.
8773080	8784120	Bye.
