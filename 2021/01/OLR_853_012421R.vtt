WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
I first used the Opera Rep Browser around 2005 and cheers to that company for continuing to bring capable browsing to the less common platforms.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
While I haven't used Opera GX, the company is taking a deeper step into gaming by acquiring game maker studio maker YoYo Games.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
Tons of games are built for the web these days and hopefully Opera is looking to make it even better and easier for users to make and play those games as it should be.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
This is the story that caught my eye. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to explain more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:46.000 --> 00:57.000
Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight January the 24th of 2021 with the 853rd episode of our show.

00:57.000 --> 01:09.000
My name is Rob Roberts joining you from our studio where we used to tape in person but for the past year and obvious reasons we've been taping through the magic of Discord online.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
Say hello in her house in her studio. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:14.000 --> 01:25.000
Sup. Hi, how are you doing? I'm alright, how are you? I'm, I'm okay. Like, I don't know, I've been sleeping a lot, and like to the point where I think it's kind of unhealthy actually.

01:25.000 --> 01:34.000
So I have to kind of like turn that around, but I think between the weather, the shorter days, the, I don't know just everything I don't know.

01:34.000 --> 01:45.000
I don't know if it's also some sense of like this great relief has been lifted from our shoulders ever since about Wednesday ish.

01:45.000 --> 01:58.000
Like feeling like that that always sense of is today the day that we're, you know, the nukes are gonna get used that that whole sense is just kind of like been lifted so maybe I'm just like catching up on lost sleep, I don't know what it is.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
But yeah, I'm here.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
There's, there's my long answer to how I'm doing. I'm here.

02:08.000 --> 02:24.000
And you guys are here. Hi everyone over in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, and sometimes we do cute little things that only

02:24.000 --> 02:37.000
the live folks see, such as the usage of that Bernie meme that is everywhere. Yeah, I guess I had to work that into the intro of the show tonight you know it's funny the thought hadn't even crossed my mind until Bobby like tweeted like so what Bernie thing

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
are we going to see in the intro this week and I was like, oh yeah I guess I kind of have to use that don't I.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
Luckily, there were so many photoshops out there. I didn't need to do one of my own.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
There was plenty to steal from. So, there is that.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
Anyway, say hello as well to tech master Loki. Hey Loki.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Hello. How are you doing.

03:01.000 --> 03:10.000
I'm doing fine. I you ought to be better than fine I saw your Twitter earlier and you got some coverage for pixel poops this week I saw what's what's going on.

03:10.000 --> 03:26.000
I got one, one YouTube video yeah so that's the game beaters. Yeah, there's more people that watch that then listen to this probably so there's that well, I don't know about that but yeah, there was, you know, there's, there's more people with the best part

03:26.000 --> 03:44.000
is at least they're genuinely excited about it, that they, you know, had fun playing it and there's people like oh yeah, you know, that one's pretty interesting so Lisa wasn't like that looks like complete dog shit you know it's just, it was, you know, I don't know.

03:44.000 --> 03:54.000
Yeah, it's nice to have like that validation for the thing you're working on I get it, I get it. Yeah, it's like the first time we got a nice review and iTunes it was kind of like, people do listen to the show.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Oh my gosh, wow.

03:57.000 --> 04:12.000
Yeah, so yeah so the hype train is starting for your game just like it is in our chat right now thanks you guys I don't usually read out the the biddies and the subs until closer to the end of the show but since we are taping a podcast here, but I'm sure even

04:12.000 --> 04:21.000
some of you podcasters know that you can do donations and stuff on Twitch and you guys got a hype train going so thanks you guys appreciate that.

04:21.000 --> 04:37.000
It's a good week after all things are things are looking up and things are looking up and down in the news and up and down and up and down and everywhere so let's get into the gaming news tonight, and a pretty stunning reversal Loki I'm gonna throw it

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
What the hell happened. And how fast did it happen.

04:41.000 --> 04:54.000
Microsoft decided that they're going to pull a no disk drive 2.0 type thing. And just out of the blue announced hey by the way you know that you know that Xbox Live gold that you love.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Well we're going to double its price.

04:57.000 --> 05:12.000
Whoops. And so they had made the announcement originally that it was going to subscriptions we're going to go up by, you know, as little as $1 to $11 per month.

05:12.000 --> 05:22.000
And there was basically the $60 Xbox Live gold was going to be for now, six months instead of for 12 months.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
And that, you know, basically everything was going up.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
And folks were not happy about that at all.

05:33.000 --> 05:43.000
So imagine why their, their reasoning was you know in many markets the price of Xbox Live gold has not changed for years and in some markets it has changed for over 10 years.

05:43.000 --> 05:51.000
So, I don't know how that's necessarily justifying the price increase, but whatever.

05:52.000 --> 06:12.000
A lot of people thought it was just to make games pass look better as a better deal, especially if it's going to be similarly priced to it, but they quickly walk that back so not only did they walk it back, but they also decided to now include the free to play games

06:12.000 --> 06:20.000
which also strangely enough required an Xbox Live gold account. So if you want to play Fortnite or Roblox or something like that.

06:20.000 --> 06:29.000
Got to have an Xbox Live gold account to play those online despite the fact that on PC or mobile or whatever, you can do that for free.

06:29.000 --> 06:40.000
So they now are not including that with gold, you can just do that without gold and kind of putting it in line with other platforms and then of course the price

06:40.000 --> 06:49.000
although that change will be gradual it's important to note that that is not a switch they're able to flip overnight, but they are committing to ending that practice in the near very near future.

06:49.000 --> 07:06.000
Yeah, and then they're also going to be, you know, keeping the price, the same as it is right now. So, I don't know, I know that there's gonna be a change coming at some point but we'll see what they end up doing with that.

07:06.000 --> 07:14.000
I think, and I'm curious what you guys kind of thought like where where the hell did this come from like I understand that you know businesses are out there to make money.

07:14.000 --> 07:26.000
And there probably came a point where Microsoft was like you know we need to, we need to pull in more money or whatever but I just, I think this was just such a dumb way to do it, and I know a lot of people are saying yo Microsoft read the room,

07:26.000 --> 07:40.000
there's a pandemic going on right now and people are having a penny pinch as as it is like maybe doubling the price just because the game industry had their best year ever doesn't mean that like suddenly we have the bandwidth to double the price for Xbox Live,

07:40.000 --> 07:51.000
which especially doesn't look good when you've got a new console that's sitting on the shelf next to the PlayStation five, which, you know, doesn't make you pay to play Fortnite or any of that stuff online.

07:51.000 --> 08:06.000
And for me, okay so speaking for me, like, where this just like just made me like, whoa, what the, where the hell did this come from and what the hell are you doing, you know, I definitely had that moment of, you know, wanting to scream at somebody because,

08:06.000 --> 08:25.000
and I think the reason why, because there's other companies that do this on the regular and kind of get away with it, like Netflix, but Netflix does $1 here $1 there every year every other year, you know, kind of slowly start to raise it up a little bit.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
And, you know, Netflix kind of takes its own shit for that whole thing too.

08:29.000 --> 08:49.000
But, not, not, not nearly at the volume that we saw on social media for what Microsoft did. Anyway, part of why I just feel like whoa, what the hell are you thinking, Microsoft, is because I have fully anticipated for a long time that Microsoft would actually go the other way and just get rid of gold.

08:49.000 --> 08:58.000
It doesn't really make sense in this day and age. It doesn't. Like paying to play the games online in the first place doesn't make a lot of sense. And y'all.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
Well, it does because people have come to expect to pay for it.

09:03.000 --> 09:21.000
In that regard, yes, but at the same time, A, it would give them such leverage against Sony to get rid of it. And B, when it comes to, and I understand, and people are going to come at me talking about the technical reasons and the servers and that it is a different pay structure and so forth.

09:21.000 --> 09:35.000
The thing is, the truth doesn't matter next to somebody's perception. And this is a very hard pill for people to swallow. I understand. But that is the way the consumer base works. Your perception is everything.

09:35.000 --> 09:44.000
Like their, their same platform. You have these Xbox games that are on PC on the Microsoft store. Don't have to have live gold for those to play online.

09:44.000 --> 09:57.000
That is the point I was trying to get to. You are sitting side by side on Windows where you don't have to pay to play games online. And the concept of paying online on your PC is like, why would I ever do that? Or Mac or whatever platform you're on.

09:57.000 --> 10:11.000
The concept of having to pay to play online on those, it's not even a thought. And if Microsoft were to try to introduce it, people would hack their way around it like that. It's not anything they can do.

10:11.000 --> 10:33.000
So that's why I'm kind of stunned because I feel like Microsoft should have been going the other way. So to see them doubling down, like, and I think what really frustrated me about that is I've been sitting here on this show, as with many of you and on many of your shows and streams and podcasts and blogs and tweets and so forth.

10:33.000 --> 10:47.000
Many of you have been sitting there going, Microsoft is a different company now. Microsoft is not the company it was under Don Mattrick. Microsoft has been going such a stronger direction under Phil Spencer. And I still believe all of that to be true.

10:47.000 --> 11:02.000
But then this happens. And it's like, there she is, the old Mimi, you know, you're that girl I thought you were. That's and that's, that's the feeling we had when it came to Microsoft suddenly like doubling the price.

11:02.000 --> 11:14.000
It was like, oh my god, you have been on such a great, like, four steps forward 10 million back to double the price it was it was ridiculous now.

11:14.000 --> 11:30.000
Okay, unclench y'all exhale because Microsoft quickly reversed course and that is the important punchline to this whole thing, you know, and Phil Spencer actually replied to one of the guys from gamertag radio which I thought was interesting.

11:30.000 --> 11:41.000
And that kind of apologizing for the whole situation happening in the first place. And it's it's one of those weird things was like well didn't didn't you have to sign off on this dude like, how did this happen.

11:41.000 --> 11:53.000
Did something get like completely out of control and not get the authorizations it was supposed to have like I, I don't know. So at the end of the day, Microsoft does end up going forward.

11:53.000 --> 12:05.000
But they showed their ass and the process, and that's kind of the problem for some people right now. And I think we'll all get past it at least I know I will like I'm already like okay well, the end result.

12:05.000 --> 12:19.000
We got something that we really should have had a long time ago and that is that fortnight all this stuff should be free on Microsoft, especially when you've got a new console you've got on the shelf next to PlayStation five, where Sony can say, not on our

12:20.000 --> 12:40.000
I'm not sure I understand the concept of push people to game pass by doubling the price of Xbox Live to get it closer to the price of game pass game passes a great deal, and can be spoken of on its own strengths, but it also has me worried.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
How long is game pass going to stay that price.

12:43.000 --> 12:52.000
And I think that is the whole part of the ass showing that Microsoft did this week that has me a little bit concerned.

12:52.000 --> 13:05.000
You are about to raise the price of Xbox Live. All right. Okay. How long until game passes price is going to double.

13:05.000 --> 13:12.000
I hope that's not the direction they're thinking of going and I understand that.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
I mean, I can see them raising it but I don't know.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
We'll see.

13:19.000 --> 13:30.000
Going to the chat for some of our comments there so SHO 100 Matt says, now the cat's out of the bag, they're going to raise the price of the next appropriate time. They can't totally walk this back.

13:30.000 --> 13:43.000
Act Def says the other thing is that we shouldn't thank Microsoft for reversing this. They shouldn't have even come out with this in the first place. Yeah, it is one of those things I don't know if thanking Microsoft is the right word, but it's one of those like,

13:43.000 --> 13:50.000
I came to your senses now go to your room. That's that's kind of where I feel I'm at with Microsoft this week.

13:50.000 --> 14:05.000
Zen monkey says, I'm shocked Microsoft didn't use the old, my little brother logged on to my account excuse. I've heard that so many times on Xbox Live whenever someone messed up in a game.

14:06.000 --> 14:13.000
When that must have game is a game pass exclusive and they'll sneak in that. Oh, by the ways, we're raising the price.

14:13.000 --> 14:28.000
She Hulk says the price will go up when all the companies they bought release great games. Well, you know, with Halo, you know, a big one that's scheduled to come at the end of the year again, I could see that the price of game pass is going to go up a little bit.

14:28.000 --> 14:41.000
And I think that's the reality we should prepare ourselves for, you know, if if this shows us anything we should probably like mentally prepare ourselves game pass is not going to be the price that it's at forever shit PC already doubled, didn't it?

14:41.000 --> 14:53.000
But let's be real $5 a month on PC. That was kind of a steal like he was it was it was really underpriced on PC. So I think it's going to be a matter of time before it creeps up.

14:53.000 --> 15:00.000
But I again, I don't understand the whole raise the price of gold to move more people on the game pass argument.

15:00.000 --> 15:10.000
Yeah, I think maybe the only way I could see that they could possibly have like their thought process could have been maybe that we're seeing really high server usage.

15:10.000 --> 15:19.000
And so our server costs are going up and therefore we have to offset it by raising the price. But I think that's more of like a temporary thing. I don't think that's going to stay that way forever.

15:20.000 --> 15:30.000
And I don't even know if that's necessarily a true fact either. Yeah, we have a lot more people playing games, but like, I don't know, I don't think that it's night and day.

15:30.000 --> 15:41.000
Maybe that's how they'll justify it. Or they could be just like the cable company and just raise your, you know, rates by $8 a month for no reason whatsoever and just like whatever.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
Yeah, so it's, it's hard to say.

15:45.000 --> 15:59.000
Yeah, it is. So I it's kind of one of those we've all got our eye on you now Microsoft, but I am glad they at least have leveled the playing field when it comes to the free games because again that was something that never really made sense.

16:00.000 --> 16:15.000
And when you're trying to sit here going, no everyone, Microsoft is a great platform now like it's not what you guys think it is or what you remember from when Xbox was first out it's not all shooty bang bang games and all this stuff it's like Microsoft's actually a great platform.

16:15.000 --> 16:25.000
You know, again, this happens and that's kind of crappy but at least now. People can't swing the whole yeah but you got to pay to play Fortnite on it which doesn't make any sense.

16:25.000 --> 16:33.000
You don't have to pay it play it anywhere else, at least that is now out of the equation or at least will be in the next, you know, couple months but we know that's on the on the radar.

16:33.000 --> 16:45.000
Well, it's, that's also interesting too because like if you're trying to bring people to your platform like if I'm buying you know if I'm looking to buy a console for my kids or something it's like I know that they play Fortnite.

16:45.000 --> 17:11.000
Okay, but they don't really play Fortnite but they play Roblox a lot, which is a free to play game you know it's like, well I could pay, I'm gonna have to pay you know $15 a person, you know, $10 a person a month or whatever for Xbox Live Gold, or I can just get a PC or they can play on their tablets, like, I don't know it's just Microsoft does a good job at selling PCs.

17:11.000 --> 17:29.000
Yeah, it's like, it's like, do you, are you trying to dissuade people from buying your consoles because like you're releasing your games on PC. It's cheaper to play it online on PC. Like, I don't understand the you know why they do that.

17:29.000 --> 17:36.000
It's like, you know, I, I'm getting a better experience on PC Why, why would I buy your console then.

17:37.000 --> 17:44.000
Tiger call on chat says Do you think the reason why they try to raise the cost was because the prices to keep those servers went up.

17:44.000 --> 17:58.000
Maybe, you know, we don't really have insight as to the real reason why Microsoft was wanting to up the price outside of to make more money, because they didn't really try to justify it and I mean they didn't say that in their announcement post you know the price of maintaining servers

17:58.000 --> 18:10.000
has gone up, but I think we all know in the back of my mind. If the price of maintaining servers has gone up which sure it probably has gone up a little bit from year to year, especially in the past you know 10 years or whenever the last time they raised the price was.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
It didn't, it didn't double.

18:12.000 --> 18:21.000
So I think that's like I think honestly if Microsoft had come out and said, we're increasing the price by $1 a month. I don't think you would have seen nearly this type of thing.

18:21.000 --> 18:36.000
And it's also harder to make that argument to when they just spent billions of dollars like acquiring a bunch of different game companies so it's like, yeah, I get it there, you know, the server costs and you know acquisition money is a little bit, it's different.

18:36.000 --> 18:48.000
It's even think that you're hurting for money when it's like, dude, you've got a bunch of money to buy all these game companies made by one less game developer and then you could offset the cost of your service for a little bit but like, I don't know,

18:48.000 --> 19:03.000
I don't know, that particular argument is a little apples and oranges to me but I also you know I have to go back to what I said before is that it really doesn't matter what the facts are it matters what the perception is, and I completely understand how the optics of that doesn't look great.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
So I get it.

19:05.000 --> 19:16.000
But I do think it's a little bit, you have money in this bucket and you have money in that bucket and it's a little, the money is kind of used for different things but I, but I get it, the optics aren't good, you're right.

19:16.000 --> 19:31.000
Let's see, Bobby in chat with a few things, they care about the Xbox ecosystem not necessarily the Xbox consoles. And the answer to your question is if you're willing to spend the money for a PC that gets a better experience than an Xbox, then they still want to cater to you because you're still in the Xbox ecosystem.

19:31.000 --> 19:39.000
Microsoft has basically left the console war, they're now in a platform war, and that doesn't necessarily mean Xbox consoles.

19:39.000 --> 19:50.000
I think that is also, you know, something to keep in mind is that Microsoft is way more concerned with how many Game Pass subscriptions they're selling right now than how many Xbox consoles they're selling.

19:50.000 --> 19:59.000
Not that I think they're hurting in that space because we still see the Xbox consoles are being scalped, and they're selling out the minute they go up on different websites.

19:59.000 --> 20:09.000
I don't think Microsoft's really having a problem in that regard but I think also supply is severely limited so it's, it's still hard to kind of gauge where that's really at.

20:09.000 --> 20:22.000
And also, like you know again speaking for myself, I have a PC and I have an Xbox, and I will tell you because the Xbox is a dedicated games platform, the games look and run better on my Xbox.

20:22.000 --> 20:38.000
I can't do as much with them, you know, I can't multitask, the same way. I can't play a game on monitor A and have the news up on monitor B or some of that stuff but even Microsoft does allow you to do some, I think there is some type of like

20:38.000 --> 20:47.000
screen and screen type of stuff and all this stuff I just don't really play with that feature. But as, as far as like running the games it does it very very well, you know, so.

20:47.000 --> 20:58.000
Not, not with Minecraft bedrock unfortunately, you click out of that screen it disconnects you from the server. Oh, that's weird. It's like, why is weird little silly.

20:58.000 --> 21:11.000
Jamie I'm going to call on you just, you've been quiet but I know you your horse is not as invested in Microsoft's race but you know kind of listening to this whole thing and knowing that Microsoft, you know, does have to make money at the end of the day.

21:11.000 --> 21:20.000
What do you kind of think it was this, do you think they they handled this in a weird way or where's your head out with this.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
You're muted just you know on discord on the discord end.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
And no worries. Anyway, let's try again. What's your thought.

21:28.000 --> 21:39.000
Honestly enough, I, I think yeah that they were right to admit that they made a big boo boo. I mean they flat out said, we messed up.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I mean that's verbatim.

21:41.000 --> 21:54.000
So, I shouldn't, I mean they shouldn't have raised it in the first place but at the very least they've gone in back to back down and they're, they're following suit with the industry now.

21:54.000 --> 22:06.000
And I think that if they hadn't done that, then it would have been a bigger blow to their business, then making an extra $60 per person would have would have helped them.

22:06.000 --> 22:17.000
I mean, yeah. And that is a good point you know even though I still kind of side with what active said where it's like we don't necessarily have to full out like forgive them for the whole thing.

22:17.000 --> 22:26.000
I think you do make a very good point that certainly not every game company or every company in general would come out and say, oops, we messed up, and within a day.

22:26.000 --> 22:49.000
That is, that is pretty fast. I mean most companies that do end up saying, oops, we put our foot in our mouth teehee, it takes them a week to do it, you know, think about the blizzard and that whole situation when they ban that guy from the tournament, who said free Hong Kong, you know, they still haven't really fully PR recovered from that.

22:49.000 --> 23:04.000
And a big part of that is that they waited so fucking long to do the bare minimum in that whole situation, you know, and so I kind of, I will give credit and I think you're right to call that out that Microsoft at least you know what they did it within a day.

23:04.000 --> 23:13.000
That that was an angry phone call happening from Phil Spencer or somebody at that level, saying WTF knock it off.

23:13.000 --> 23:31.000
Yeah, I think that it might have been like maybe just some, you know, I'd say just you know financial person who only saw like general operating costs and thought, oh, well, we can do this if we raise live by this, you know, all we're doing all this with it.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
And then you have to look at the big picture it has you.

23:35.000 --> 23:41.000
Yeah, their bottom line, making money, right, right, but they need to understand what it is.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
Or I'd say who it is that gives them their money.

23:45.000 --> 23:59.000
And if you don't make the users of your product, happy in a way that's going to also be cost effective and profitable. You are going to lose it all.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Yep.

24:01.000 --> 24:10.000
You know, if, if they had put it to 120 and kept half of their user base guess what they'd be making the same amount of money.

24:10.000 --> 24:23.000
It's, it's, it's, uh, it's very interesting this whole thing and it does, I think now the only, you know, I think the thing that Phil Spencer is going to really be irritated about is that he's going to be asked about this for the next three months.

24:23.000 --> 24:32.000
Why did that happen? How did this happen? Why did you decide it was like Phil? And that is not the discussion Microsoft wanted to have for the next three months.

24:32.000 --> 24:39.000
They want to talk about what games are coming out and all these things. And now I guarantee you every interview Phil Spencer does for the next three months.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
People are going to ask what happened with that price doubling thing? Like, why did you guys do that? How did that happen?

24:44.000 --> 24:59.000
Like, so, so to, you know, an active credit here who says, you know, I'm glad that Microsoft reverse it, but it shouldn't happen in the first place. That is the price to ultimately be paid here is that the narrative now around Microsoft is, what are they doing over there at Microsoft?

24:59.000 --> 25:08.000
What are they plotting? What are they planning? And it's not going to be about the new Halo and the conversation that Microsoft wants to be having.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Pretty much.

25:09.000 --> 25:17.000
Pretty much. All right. Anyway, I guess the last thing I could say about this whole thing of Microsoft is we were rooting for you. All right.

25:17.000 --> 25:21.000
Let's move on. That's my third Drag Race reference. I've snuck in, by the way, this whole episode.

25:21.000 --> 25:28.000
Let's move on and talk about how is your gaming week and the types of games that we've been playing this week.

25:28.000 --> 25:34.000
Dark Soccer, we'll start with you. How is your gaming week? Have you been playing Microsoft games or other stuff?

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Animal Crossing.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Oh, of course.

25:37.000 --> 25:44.000
And getting a few things ready, so, you know, I've got I'll just go ahead and say I have a procedure coming up this week,

25:44.000 --> 25:52.000
so I'm actually going to be playing trying to go back in and play just some things that have been on my backlog while I'm recovering.

25:52.000 --> 25:57.000
And I did buy a game for Dan for five dollars.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
I got five dollars.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
Sorry, Siri's talking to me. I got an Outrun Europa for Game Gear.

26:04.000 --> 26:09.000
Oh, nice. Just because we watched the thing about Outrun and I was like, I'll get it.

26:09.000 --> 26:19.000
So why not? So and then I got like the Nintendo DS like Sega Classics pack that has like Puyo Puyo and Fantasy Zone and all of that on it.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
So I might actually break out my my 3DS.

26:23.000 --> 26:29.000
But really, the big reason I have that is so that I can play their version of Space Harrier,

26:29.000 --> 26:39.000
because their version of Space Harrier has the tilt control like like the simulates, like you're in like the tilting cockpit.

26:39.000 --> 26:45.000
Meat. Yeah, I thought that was pretty cool. And it was it was fairly cheap.

26:45.000 --> 26:50.000
I did actually get something that's not a game, Rob, but I think you might want to take it from me.

26:50.000 --> 26:57.000
OK. I got the Golden Girls tarot deck. A tarot deck? What? I did.

26:57.000 --> 27:04.000
Now, I know the Golden Girls have been licensed to all sorts of strange things, but a tarot deck?

27:04.000 --> 27:09.000
I guess a monopoly and clue. OK, interesting. I have a Golden Girls tarot deck.

27:09.000 --> 27:14.000
And if you want to steal it from me, I would have no problem with you gaining custody of it.

27:14.000 --> 27:20.000
But I have to try the deck out because it just seems absolutely hilarious.

27:20.000 --> 27:27.000
The moment I saw it was like 14 bucks, so it wasn't that expensive. But but I thought it was it was pretty funny.

27:27.000 --> 27:34.000
Zen Monkey is wondering, is Rose the fool card? I haven't even opened it. No, it'd have to be Stanley.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
All right. All right. Loki, you're having some discord problems.

27:38.000 --> 27:43.000
If you guys are hearing discord noises on the podcast, it's Loki connecting, reconnecting.

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
Are you with us? I'm still here. Yeah. Oh, you're just not.

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
Yeah. Video things being ridiculous here.

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
So anyways, so this week I did play a few more things.

27:55.000 --> 28:04.000
We picked up Super Smash Brothers Ultimate because my son is having like a his seventh birthday party sort.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
Not party, but I had like a couple friends over.

28:08.000 --> 28:15.000
And so we played a bit of that because we had to unlock all the characters that purchased both the fighter passes and stuff.

28:15.000 --> 28:22.000
So that's fun. Mainly everybody's maining Steve. And that's been a lot of fun playing as that.

28:22.000 --> 28:30.000
What else? I actually ironically, even though it's being discontinued, I played a bit of Minecraft Earth.

28:30.000 --> 28:36.000
So that was kind of interesting being that I haven't played it in a long time.

28:36.000 --> 28:43.000
So it's interesting to see all the new things that they add to it. But the game's being discontinued, which is too bad.

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
And then, well, really, with all the stuff that they have in the game that they don't have in the vanilla Minecraft,

28:48.000 --> 28:57.000
I really wish they'd add all the mobs and stuff in there because there's a lot of things that are exclusive to Minecraft Earth that aren't in the main vanilla game.

28:57.000 --> 29:02.000
Orna. And then aside from that, a little bit of Minecraft.

29:02.000 --> 29:11.000
And most of this week was just watching Twitch streams for Epic SMP while I was coding and doing artwork for my game.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
So that's pretty much where most of my focus has been.

29:15.000 --> 29:24.000
Nice. And going to chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, talking about the Super Smash Brothers event that your son had.

29:24.000 --> 29:30.000
Bobby says, I figured it was just Minecraft fighting, which is funny because I seem to remember Bobby being one of the people

29:30.000 --> 29:37.000
that was kind of saying this when Steve was announced for Minecraft was that it's not Steve or Steve being in Minecraft.

29:37.000 --> 29:41.000
Sorry, guys. Steve being in Smash Brothers. Hello.

29:41.000 --> 29:46.000
That when that announcement came out, a lot of the Smash Brothers fandom was kind of like, ew, why?

29:46.000 --> 29:53.000
And there were folks like Bobby and other folks, too, that were saying, Steve being in Smash Brothers isn't really for you.

29:53.000 --> 29:59.000
It's for a different audience that's going to appreciate it and bring more people into playing Smash Brothers.

29:59.000 --> 30:06.000
And hence, here's, you know, case in point and the evidence brought forth before the court what you're talking about with the kids,

30:06.000 --> 30:11.000
how all the seven year olds, they're all playing Minecraft Steve and playing Steve Fighter.

30:11.000 --> 30:17.000
Right. Yeah, exactly. And so he's a fun character to play as. I don't know.

30:17.000 --> 30:23.000
Yeah, I don't really take it too seriously. So whatever. But it's pretty fun.

30:23.000 --> 30:34.000
So I like him. The other character I've been playing a lot because I still like I have trouble controlling my characters because I don't play Smash at all.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
I don't even really know what the the controls are to smash.

30:38.000 --> 30:46.000
I just kind of, you know, just playing it based on what I remember from years ago with Smash Brothers Wii and stuff like that.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
It like I was playing a lot of Terry Bogard, which is kind of fun.

30:49.000 --> 30:55.000
And since we have all like the DLC characters unlocked now, we're still at like 60 some characters unlocked.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
I mean, it's going to be a while before we get everybody, which is kind of it's good and bad at the same time.

31:00.000 --> 31:11.000
Like it's good because it gives you some reason to play the game, but it's bad. It's like, well, I wanted to play as Mega Man or play as I don't know what the other characters.

31:11.000 --> 31:17.000
They can't do that because have to play through hundreds of games, unlock everybody.

31:17.000 --> 31:22.000
I don't know. Yeah. I'm surprised they don't just have something in the store that just unlocks a code or something.

31:22.000 --> 31:32.000
Yeah. You know, at this point, but or if you've bought any of the DLC, you know, if they they want to charge for it or whatever, at least kind of just make it like, oh, if you bought any of the DLC and it just unlocks all the characters.

31:32.000 --> 31:39.000
I get that. So. Yeah. All right. All right. Nice advertisement there. All right. OK. Oh, you're back.

31:39.000 --> 31:44.000
That's what it looks like when it loads the screen. OK. And I get it. I guess not advertising for that.

31:44.000 --> 31:51.000
For the podcast, folks, I'm teasing Loki's camera was slowly coming back on, but it shows the website for the company of the software he's using.

31:51.000 --> 31:58.000
And then like it takes a second and then Loki suddenly appears. So, hey, you guys know how Loki's getting his face here to discord.

31:58.000 --> 32:05.000
Yes, it's it's X split X split V cam. Hey, did they did they pay you for that? Did they pay you for that? No.

32:05.000 --> 32:11.000
They did not pay me for that, but I have no green screen. So it works like a green screen without green screen.

32:11.000 --> 32:17.000
All right. Well, even Skype does that now. Come on. All right. Anyway.

32:17.000 --> 32:23.000
Well, I had to pay for this one, so, you know, whatever. All right. Moving on to my gaming week.

32:23.000 --> 32:30.000
So I've still been playing a lot of Final Fantasy 14. There was a big crafting event that was going on in the game.

32:30.000 --> 32:35.000
What's called the Ishgard rankings, where the top 100 people in every craft.

32:35.000 --> 32:41.000
It's like a competition where you're crafting certain items. And I could not make the hardest item.

32:41.000 --> 32:49.000
I had to make the second to hardest item. And I made a lot of them. I made 400 of those throughout the week.

32:49.000 --> 32:53.000
But you know what, y'all? I ended up in the ranks. I'm number 50. I think it was 57 or 58.

32:53.000 --> 32:59.000
I ended up number 58 on my server for carpentry. So I got my stupid title. I got in the rankings.

32:59.000 --> 33:07.000
I'm good. I'm happy. That was my big Final Fantasy 14 accomplishment outside of, you know, continuing more roulettes and things of that nature.

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
Here's the big news. And this happened right after last week's show, actually.

33:11.000 --> 33:16.000
Last week's show finished a little early, if I remember right. I think it was done about an hour earlier than usual.

33:16.000 --> 33:22.000
Just because, you know, January, we tend to have less news. And I went right into Pokémon.

33:22.000 --> 33:28.000
And I was talking to Shane a little bit and I was like, hey, I need to touch trade a few things because I'm really close to finishing my decks.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
But there's a couple things like Flapple and stuff. They're just going to be way too hard for me to get in Shield.

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
It's like, can I touch trade you a couple things and I'll be done? And he said, of course.

33:36.000 --> 33:41.000
So we got on. We touch traded a few things. I went through and I evolved a few more things I needed to.

33:41.000 --> 33:51.000
And I caught them all. I sure did. Guess what? I caught them all. My decks in Pokémon Shield, done.

33:51.000 --> 33:59.000
Four hundred out of four hundred. I got my certificate. I got my shiny charm. I was the very best that no one ever was.

33:59.000 --> 34:06.000
Even if I had to temporary temporarily steal someone else's Pokémon to get it done. It doesn't matter. I still did it.

34:06.000 --> 34:16.000
So Jamie, Jamie's giving me three claps. Phoenix in chat says that's a big decks.

34:16.000 --> 34:23.000
Yeah, the base decks in shield decks in your pants there. The base decks in shield is four hundred.

34:23.000 --> 34:28.000
And so I finished that. Well, and then active says, so what are you shiny hunting first?

34:28.000 --> 34:35.000
OK, so here's the gag. Number one, I didn't realize the shiny charm guy.

34:35.000 --> 34:42.000
If you talk to him earlier, like after you beat the game, he gives you a charm that makes catching easier.

34:42.000 --> 34:48.000
So that would have made this whole process a lot easier. I mean, quick balls are pretty efficient.

34:48.000 --> 34:54.000
But still, that made me very mad when I was like, oh, now a critical catch chance charm? Really?

34:54.000 --> 35:01.000
Now a warning? Anyway, so there was that. And then I got the shiny charm.

35:01.000 --> 35:08.000
But since I was on Discord with Shane, you know, his first thing was, OK, you're going to get the DLC.

35:08.000 --> 35:17.000
We're going to go to Dynamax. So that was that was the first thing I did was I went on a Dynamax raid with Shane in the time.

35:17.000 --> 35:24.000
He was like, yeah, just go to the Tundra DLC. It's better. So I went to that and we got he led me through it.

35:24.000 --> 35:31.000
And I got a Tapu something, some fairy legendary from one of the recent games at the end of our Dynamax thing.

35:31.000 --> 35:40.000
So he did say he was running a test because he said everybody is supposed to get Suicune, Suicune on their first run.

35:40.000 --> 35:45.000
But if you go with somebody else, he was curious if I'd still be locked into Suicune or get somebody else.

35:45.000 --> 35:51.000
And it turns out I got somebody else. I got Tapu. I'm sorry, I forget. It's a it's two names.

35:51.000 --> 36:00.000
I forgot the second name. Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, so are you glad there's no national decks so you don't actually have to catch them all?

36:00.000 --> 36:08.000
Funny you mention that because, yes, there is a national decks on the Switch. It's Pokemon Home.

36:08.000 --> 36:14.000
Pokemon Home is a national decks on Switch. So where I'm kind of of the understanding,

36:14.000 --> 36:24.000
I'm not really going to catch them all and fill out my entire decks on Switch because that's going to need games that I just don't really have access to anymore or what have you.

36:24.000 --> 36:34.000
I still have been combining what was in my old Pokemon Bank, Pokemon Go and Pokemon Shield and dumping all that into home.

36:34.000 --> 36:38.000
And I'm up to five hundred and fifty decks in Pokemon Home.

36:38.000 --> 36:45.000
And I think once I do the DLC, which will be my next thing for Shield, that'll certainly be a few more Mon with that.

36:45.000 --> 36:53.000
And then who knows, I may be motivated to go back and play like Moon or Sun or one of the other games and really try to work on my decks that way.

36:53.000 --> 37:00.000
And I might get a lot closer than some of y'all think. Quarantine makes people do crazy things. That is it.

37:00.000 --> 37:08.000
Oh, ActDeaf gave me all the names. It was Tapu Fini, I think is it. I think it was Tapu Fini sounds right.

37:08.000 --> 37:16.000
Let's see. Sg100Matt in chat says, Shane is Rob's gaming accountant. His hero's power just convinces him to buy whatever he says.

37:16.000 --> 37:23.000
Yes and no. I mean, think about this, though, guys. How long have Shane and I been friends? We've been friends a very long time.

37:23.000 --> 37:30.000
Think back to when Shane's first appearance on this show was. I'll give you a hint. It was before many of you were listening.

37:30.000 --> 37:38.000
It was back when Loki and I were living together in Live 365 days. He was like 18 or 19 then. He was young.

37:38.000 --> 37:44.000
But we were like 24 or 25. So it was that was in the first or second year of OLR.

37:44.000 --> 37:52.000
He probably was probably the first time he guessed it on the show. And the reason why I say that is that was over 15 years ago.

37:52.000 --> 38:04.000
I just now have finished the decks in a Pokémon game thanks to a global pandemic that has forced my attention to stay focused on one or two games for a long period of time.

38:04.000 --> 38:10.000
So if there were powers or whatever, I think it would have happened 15 years ago.

38:10.000 --> 38:17.000
I would have probably finished the decks in black or white. His favorite game that that never happened.

38:17.000 --> 38:24.000
So there is that. All right. In fact, actually, Dark Sakura, he name checked us.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
I don't mean to make this the Shane show. Well, he's not here to hear in chat right now for his ego to get bigger.

38:28.000 --> 38:32.000
But you and I were name checked in a tweet and I had forgot about this.

38:32.000 --> 38:38.000
We went down to Disneyland and I think it was for a birthday trip of yours, I want to say.

38:38.000 --> 38:45.000
And on our way down there, do you remember we had to go to a Walmart that was in like Azusa or some shit?

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
I don't remember. I think it was because Arcade Infinity was over in that direction.

38:48.000 --> 38:53.000
And we went to a Walmart over there and that was so he could buy a Pokémon game.

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
I forgot about that until he name checked us in a tweet earlier this week.

38:57.000 --> 39:03.000
Where he was like, I went to a Walmart with Jamie and Rob and picked up whatever game it was that released that week.

39:03.000 --> 39:07.000
So I thought that was kind of I was like, oh, I forgot that was a Pokémon thing.

39:07.000 --> 39:15.000
I remember having to make the detour to the Walmart and that that that was Shane's accountant hero's power thing was,

39:15.000 --> 39:22.000
yes, if we're going to go to Arcade Infinity, why don't you go just a little bit longer and go to the Walmart so I can get something?

39:23.000 --> 39:27.000
Arcade Infinity was that I miss Arcade Infinity.

39:27.000 --> 39:32.000
I do, too. That was a fun trip. Yeah, that was back when we could do that and Disneyland in one trip. It was fun.

39:32.000 --> 39:38.000
So. All right. Anyway, also in my house, like you're halfway through Disney and you have to go take a nap.

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
Yeah, pretty much. Let's see. Then what else during my gaming week?

39:42.000 --> 39:49.000
So there was that. And then I played oh, I played Donut. Is it Donut Country or Donut County?

39:49.000 --> 39:54.000
Country or I can't remember. I don't remember. It's Donut County, I think.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
OK, Donut County. They just added that to Game Pass.

39:57.000 --> 40:04.000
And even though I played that on, I think, Steam previously, I played it on Xbox a little bit.

40:04.000 --> 40:09.000
That's the game that's kind of like the reverse Katamari, where instead of rolling things up into a ball,

40:09.000 --> 40:15.000
you you have the whole swallow them into the earth. And it's kind of like a silly story that goes with it.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
Have you played this dark soccer? This is totally your kind of game.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
I have it. I have it for Mac. Mm hmm.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
And I played it for a hot minute and then got busy with other things.

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
So I really need to just go back and dedicate some more time to it. But yeah.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
And that and I'll be perfectly honest, I probably should just get it on my iPad now,

40:34.000 --> 40:41.000
because I haven't touched my MacBook since I got my iPad, except when I had to run two computers at the same time.

40:41.000 --> 40:45.000
Yeah, whatever works like get it. Yeah, I keep forgetting it's also a phone.

40:45.000 --> 40:52.000
Well, you know, phone tablets like, you know, that whole ecosystem it's on. It's there to actually Apple Arcade.

40:52.000 --> 40:59.000
Probably I wouldn't be surprised, but especially if it's on Game Pass. But anyway, we're checking out.

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
So, yeah, I played a little bit of that as well and a few other things here and there.

41:03.000 --> 41:08.000
Tetris Effect a little more and just, you know, chilling on Xbox with some of that.

41:08.000 --> 41:14.000
I just downloaded. What did I just download? There's something else I'm getting to this week because I just downloaded it.

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
And now, of course, the name escapes me. Oh, well, stay tuned for next week because I haven't played it yet.

41:18.000 --> 41:23.000
I just downloaded it. Waiting to play it for next week. All right. Let's move on with the show.

41:23.000 --> 41:28.000
We have lots of news to get into tonight. Things are starting to pick back up now that it's January.

41:28.000 --> 41:33.000
All right. Let's get to it. Loki, we'll start with you. How is your gaming week?

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
Jamie, your camera is still on, just so you know. I think you meant to turn it off.

41:36.000 --> 41:41.000
All right. Well, whoops. She thought she turned it off. She didn't. She's taking an AFK.

41:41.000 --> 41:46.000
Anyway, Loki, why don't you start us off with the news?

41:46.000 --> 41:52.000
Yeah. So Cyberpunk finally got that major patch that they had announced in their apology video.

41:52.000 --> 41:59.000
So it did come out on all platforms. It's about a 17 gig download and it fixed different issues,

41:59.000 --> 42:06.000
including some optimizations, buggy quests, visual hiccups, general stability.

42:06.000 --> 42:12.000
However, like most patches that come out nowadays, it also broke some stuff.

42:12.000 --> 42:17.000
So some of those are actually game breaking bugs that cause different quests not to work.

42:17.000 --> 42:25.000
There is like one quest, for example, where a certain NPC won't call you or there's another quest where you can't pull your gun out.

42:25.000 --> 42:31.000
Lots of issues still being worked on. Hopefully this stuff is going to be addressed in another patch,

42:31.000 --> 42:37.000
but right now they are laying the groundwork for upcoming patches.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
The next big one is due in February.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
What did you think of that whole roadmap that they put out?

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
I mean, you're the only one at the trio that's really played the game.

42:47.000 --> 42:52.000
I haven't played this in a while. I haven't gotten around to playing it again,

42:52.000 --> 42:57.000
but I'll go back and play it some more, but I don't know.

42:57.000 --> 43:02.000
None of that stuff means anything to me because I don't know exactly what's being fixed and stuff.

43:02.000 --> 43:07.000
So we'll see. I have to see what kind of performance issues are going to be cleared up.

43:07.000 --> 43:17.000
There's just some stuff that's not even performance based, like the cop AI or I don't know.

43:18.000 --> 43:23.000
Some of the weird visual glitches and stuff, if they could fix some of that would be nice.

43:23.000 --> 43:27.000
But yeah, mainly the police AI would be something I would like to have fixed,

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
make some of the vehicle physics and stuff.

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
But other than that, it doesn't really dissuade me either way.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
I just don't have time to play right now. I'm not making time to play it.

43:36.000 --> 43:42.000
We'll see if I ever get to finish it because a lot of these games, if I don't play it for a long enough time,

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
I'll just go back and play something else.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
Once again, like I said, mentioning that I watch a lot of Twitch this week,

43:48.000 --> 43:54.000
I saw people playing Skyrim. I saw people playing Minecraft on specific servers.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
I'm like, man, I should go back and play some Skyrim.

43:56.000 --> 44:00.000
Oh, that is all my husband's been doing for four months, is playing Skyrim.

44:00.000 --> 44:04.000
He plays some mod. The game doesn't even look the same.

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
It changes the base interface and font, and I'm like, what the fuck are you even playing?

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
He's like, it's Skyrim. I'm like, oh, it is, but it's not. No, it isn't.

44:12.000 --> 44:18.000
I don't know. My husband loves mods, loves them. That is why he games on PC.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
That is his bread and butter. So the games don't even look like it has with me.

44:22.000 --> 44:28.000
Yeah. I mean, and to go into another tangent here about streaming and stuff,

44:28.000 --> 44:35.000
like I said, I've been watching this. It's a stream, basically a group of streamers and YouTube stars and stuff like that.

44:35.000 --> 44:40.000
They're playing a survivor multiplayer realm or not really a realm,

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
but like a server for Java Minecraft.

44:43.000 --> 44:48.000
And it's got this mod in there called Create, which is pretty amazing.

44:48.000 --> 44:58.000
You can make like, you know, water wheels and stuff that actually spins and like the working elevators and like all sorts of create like trains.

44:58.000 --> 45:05.000
Not just like a, you know, a mine cart and riding around on a mine cart, but like an actual train and like all sorts of crazy stuff.

45:05.000 --> 45:10.000
But it's just a lot of them playing together. And I'm like, man, like I would really love to play with a lot of people.

45:10.000 --> 45:15.000
They're actually going to be online and playing all the time. That would be a lot of fun.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
I really want to get into like something like that to stream or whatever.

45:18.000 --> 45:24.000
And even just like watching, you know, folks stream Skyrim and not like necessarily with mods on or anything.

45:24.000 --> 45:30.000
It's just like vanilla Skyrim, just like, OK, I'm just going to go through this game and, you know, interact with chat and stuff like that.

45:30.000 --> 45:34.000
So I definitely want to get into that once I'm developing my game.

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
But yeah, so enough of that tangent, though.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
But yes, I hope we'll get back to it at some point.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
I'm looking at some comments from chat.

45:42.000 --> 45:51.000
Quest Buster says the roadmap is more disappointing to me because instead of focusing on new things to do in the game with their DLC plans, the convo is all about fixes instead.

45:51.000 --> 45:59.000
And so, yeah, I think that's what's kind of been a very frustrating thing for a lot of people, even if you didn't think cyberpunk was broken in the first place.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
They've got to fix it for all the people it is broken for.

46:01.000 --> 46:14.000
And it's kind of preventing the game from getting the DLC and, you know, other types of expansions that you will come to expect from, you know, this developer when they did this with The Witcher three and all that.

46:14.000 --> 46:24.000
You know, all the DLC is still coming up before they even make the like PlayStation five and, you know, Xbox Series X versions that were supposed to be coming out well before the DLC.

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
So stuff's still gotten, you know, mixed.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
The order is kind of mixed up right now on it.

46:29.000 --> 46:36.000
But I think that stuff that you're going to see that sooner than some of these other enhancements.

46:36.000 --> 46:47.000
Bobby Blackwell's talking about how it's kind of hard to jump back into a game after you haven't played it for a while, saying if I don't play something for a long time, my problem is that I forget how to play and I forget my progression path for my characters.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
I know I left off a cyberpunk literally mid quest.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
Yes, big same.

46:51.000 --> 46:59.000
And Bobby says Yakuza like a dragon has that story so far on their load screen, but the game loads so fast on the Series X.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
You can't read it.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
Womp, womp.

47:01.000 --> 47:07.000
Dragon Quest 11 does the same thing, but there's a big, big difference that makes it better.

47:07.000 --> 47:11.000
You have to actually press the A button once loading is done.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
It says press A to continue.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
And so you have time to read it.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Ta-da!

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
But the tips still go by too fast.

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
So no tips for you, but at least you don't get lost in the story on Dragon Quest 11.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
And then I say Pokemon.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
I left Pokemon for a long time.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
A shield.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
You know, I bought the game when it first came out and I didn't finish my decks until now.

47:31.000 --> 47:35.000
But the nice thing is the bottom of the screen always reminds you where you're at in the story.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Or actually I had already beaten it at that point.

47:37.000 --> 47:41.000
But you still, the Pokedex will always show you, you know, here's some Mon you don't have yet.

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
And now that I'm in the DLC, it also will always on the pause screen say,

47:46.000 --> 47:50.000
you should go here and talk to so-and-so or whatever it is you need to do.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
So anyway.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
I think I just finished the third gym.

47:54.000 --> 47:59.000
And now I'm just wandering around in that big, I got sword.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
Oh, yeah.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
Same gym.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
But yeah.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
Yeah.

48:03.000 --> 48:07.000
But I think it's like this one scene where they're like, oh, go out and play for a little bit.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
And I'm like, okay.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
Interesting.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
I'll play.

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
It's like in that big open field area.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
Oh, yeah.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
The big walled city.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
Yeah.

48:17.000 --> 48:22.000
I'm trying to remember why they have you do that if they're trying to get you to catch a certain Mon or force something to happen.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
I'd have to go back to remember in the story.

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
It's probably probably you have to trigger some type of event just like catching a certain Pokemon or something.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
But there shouldn't be a lot blocking you from going to.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
I know what I'm doing.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
I know what I'm doing.

48:35.000 --> 48:39.000
I'm leveling my my opposite types.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
Okay.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
Okay.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
Yeah.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
For the next gym.

48:43.000 --> 48:47.000
The wild area is a great change, but it is.

48:47.000 --> 48:54.000
It does play into that thing that's always stopped me from beating Pokemon games that I really had to kind of break in my mind is that the grind.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I'm always distracted by.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Oh, I got to catch them all while I'm here.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
I got to get everything out in this area.

49:00.000 --> 49:08.000
And you really have to leave that mindset behind, especially because you could stay in that wild area forever and catch everything.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
Yeah.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
It's you got to be careful.

49:11.000 --> 49:17.000
And honestly, the grindy part, though, I mean, it's why I just I stopped caring.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
Yeah, I understand.

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
So the thing is, is that I really thought this would be the game to get me back into Pokemon.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
And no.

49:24.000 --> 49:29.000
Well, you never know if you can get over that little hump, you might might make it the rest of the way.

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
It's it's really the collection thing of I kind of I'm just not into it.

49:33.000 --> 49:39.000
I'd rather play, I mean, a conventional RPG, I think.

49:39.000 --> 49:51.000
All right. Well, let's move on and let's talk about let's talk about stocks and investing, which is something honestly, if I understood this stuff, I would I would be a lot richer than I am.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
And I'd probably be on a cruise.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Right. Well, not right now, but I would be traveling the world.

49:56.000 --> 50:03.000
Not right now, but I would be holed up in my mansion if I understood investing in stocks and all this stuff.

50:03.000 --> 50:07.000
I had to read this several times and I'm not sure it makes sense.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
Here's what it is.

50:08.000 --> 50:16.000
So Game Stops stonks had some issues this week and it was partially caused by Reddit.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
It sounds like I'm going to just read this.

50:18.000 --> 50:23.000
I don't like to read things verbatim, but the problem is I have a hard time explaining this.

50:24.000 --> 50:29.000
So I'm going to read a paragraph here from this story on theverge.com and I am going to read it a little bit verbatim.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
So I apologize to the Verge. You should go check out the story over there.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Here's the paragraph.

50:34.000 --> 50:42.000
The hype generated by Reddit Wall Street bets helped create what's known as a short squeeze on Game Stops stock.

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
A short squeeze works like this.

50:45.000 --> 50:50.000
Some investors known as shorts essentially bet that a company stock will fall.

50:50.000 --> 50:59.000
These investors borrow stock from other investors and sell it with plans to buy it back when the prices fall and then return it to the original owner.

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
I had to read that like four times for it to make sense.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
But essentially you're banking on the fact that it's going to fail.

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
So you're borrowing and you're going to say,

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
Hey, Jamie, Jamie, can I borrow some turnips from you real quick?

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
OK, I'm going to borrow these turnips.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
OK, OK, I'll bring them back.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
And then you sell them while the turnips are high.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
And then later in the week, turnips are low again.

51:20.000 --> 51:27.000
So you buy them at the low price and then I go back to Jamie and say, OK, thank you for letting me hold your turnips for a little bit.

51:27.000 --> 51:32.000
And so I made a profit basically by borrowing something and selling it when it was low.

51:32.000 --> 51:37.000
And I had to translate to Animal Crossing a little bit for it to make sense to me.

51:37.000 --> 51:43.000
OK, now the problem actually deal with that a little bit with my 401K.

51:43.000 --> 51:48.000
OK, yeah, you know what? And again, some of you are probably better vested in this stuff than I am.

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
No pun intended. Then I am. OK, so. All right.

51:52.000 --> 51:57.000
The problem with the shorting is that losses are theoretically infinite.

51:57.000 --> 52:06.000
If a stock begins an upward run, some short sellers will abandon their short and buy shares at the higher price to return.

52:06.000 --> 52:12.000
This in turn makes the stock go higher, burning any other shorts who remain in the stock.

52:12.000 --> 52:16.000
Some of whom may in turn choose to cover their own shorts.

52:16.000 --> 52:20.000
So in other words, everybody gets nervous at the same time. It's not going down.

52:20.000 --> 52:26.000
So, oh, shit, I better just buy the turnips again while I'm only going to lose a little money because a little higher.

52:26.000 --> 52:30.000
And then in fact, you're just driving the turnip price up for everybody else.

52:30.000 --> 52:37.000
So that's what happened. And honestly, I was sitting there going, how is that legal?

52:37.000 --> 52:42.000
How does Reddit not fuck it up for everything if this is the case?

52:42.000 --> 52:46.000
Like, wouldn't you just conspire to do certain things?

52:46.000 --> 52:51.000
But it turns out a lot of that kind of like conspiracy, it actually is illegal, you guys.

52:51.000 --> 52:56.000
That's that's what they call the the Martha Stewart types of crimes.

52:56.000 --> 53:01.000
OK, why did Martha Stewart go to jail or have to wear a bracelet?

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
Insider trading is insider trading because she was a woman.

53:05.000 --> 53:10.000
That, too. No, it wasn't it wasn't exactly the short situation.

53:10.000 --> 53:15.000
Yes, but it was stock market related stuff is essentially the real big leap I'm making here.

53:15.000 --> 53:21.000
All right. Anyway. And yes, because she was a woman, I'm a powerful one at that.

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
Let's see. And what is it that the white guys in charge fear?

53:25.000 --> 53:32.000
In part women, women and minorities, other minorities, vaginas.

53:32.000 --> 53:37.000
All right. Anyway, what else was I going to say? Oh, not saying that all women have vaginas.

53:37.000 --> 53:47.000
I'm just saying, yes, I understand. GameStop is the most shorted stock in the market, according to CNBC.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
One hundred thirty eight percent of the stocks are sold sold short.

53:49.000 --> 53:56.000
In other words, what that's saying to you is that most investors predict the GameStop stock is going to continue to go down.

53:56.000 --> 54:01.000
Yes, it probably will. Just based off of what we know about GameStop.

54:01.000 --> 54:09.000
So the GameStop, for example, they've had very they have a new person that's from Chewy.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
I think that helped launch Chewy dot com or something like that.

54:12.000 --> 54:16.000
They're looking to take them fully digital and the guy that's in charge there.

54:16.000 --> 54:21.000
He wants to basically remove all of their physical storefronts.

54:21.000 --> 54:30.000
You know, the only thing that makes them actually unique right now, he wants to compete with Amazon and like Newegg and stuff like that with new game releases.

54:30.000 --> 54:35.000
Good luck to you. Not going to work out for you.

54:35.000 --> 54:45.000
I'm also giggling at chat DJ Rama as in chat says Martha Stewart went to jail because she's no snitch.

54:45.000 --> 54:50.000
All right. Do you ever check Martha Stewart's Instagram?

54:50.000 --> 54:55.000
Like, I really aspire to be her when I'm retired because she's like, she's like, what?

54:55.000 --> 55:00.000
That woman's in her 70s and she's posting like, here's my makeup selfie.

55:00.000 --> 55:06.000
She's posting like she's a makeup influencer on YouTube. And I kind of live for it.

55:06.000 --> 55:11.000
Anyway, this isn't the Martha Stewart show, although maybe it ought to be moving on.

55:11.000 --> 55:15.000
I want to talk about. So so I was questioning, how is this legal? Right.

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
So let's talk about the Reddit post and how this whole turnip game began.

55:19.000 --> 55:28.000
OK, so a short seller research company called Citron Research predicted that the price would drop.

55:28.000 --> 55:34.000
So Redditors on Wall Street bets who went and were kind of like driving up interest in the stock,

55:34.000 --> 55:42.000
criticized Citron on the Reddit and continued to praise the stock on social media.

55:42.000 --> 55:50.000
This pissed off the Citron research guy, saying it will no longer comment on the GameStop stock.

55:50.000 --> 55:56.000
I always want to say stunk because of the angry mob who owns the stock.

55:56.000 --> 56:04.000
The research editor named Andrew Left put a note on Twitter saying the backlash had criminal activity.

56:04.000 --> 56:09.000
And I am going to report you to the Securities and Exchange Commission,

56:09.000 --> 56:14.000
which included harassment of minor children and financial crimes.

56:14.000 --> 56:19.000
So basically, I I want to speak to Tom Nook's manager.

56:19.000 --> 56:26.000
I'm taking you to the Supreme Court. Is basically the note that he left on Twitter.

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
You can go read it for yourself over at Citron Research on Twitter.

56:29.000 --> 56:36.000
But honestly, just stick to Animal Crossing turnips. It's safer.

56:36.000 --> 56:44.000
Anyway, Quest Buster is apparently our Wall Street analyst here because I certainly don't understand this shit.

56:44.000 --> 56:48.000
But Quest Buster's trying to translate some stuff here, saying shorts are legal.

56:48.000 --> 56:54.000
Naked shorts where you sell shares without actually having them are not.

56:54.000 --> 56:59.000
Hmm. Interesting. All right. Anyway, there's your stunk market lesson of the week.

56:59.000 --> 57:05.000
Again, if you want to learn more, buy and sell turnips in Animal Crossing, because there's a reason why they do.

57:05.000 --> 57:10.000
Because does it isn't turnip literally the same word as stock in Japanese?

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
And that's how it's similar or similar. It's a it's a very similar one.

57:14.000 --> 57:20.000
I mean, which is why, like Joan was Sal Joan as in Dow Jones.

57:20.000 --> 57:25.000
You know, they try to follow the same nicknaming thing. But yes, stocks.

57:25.000 --> 57:30.000
And I have to look up the word again. Hold on.

57:30.000 --> 57:35.000
That's it's not that big a thing, but I knew it was like a similar same word.

57:36.000 --> 57:41.000
Kabushiki. Hold on. Let me double check it. Kabu. I think it is.

57:41.000 --> 57:46.000
OK, where the word came from. OK, so anyway, just interesting.

57:46.000 --> 57:52.000
So and I turnip is kabu. OK, OK.

57:52.000 --> 57:57.000
It is interesting because a lot of us have predicted the GameStop stock is going to go down, down, down.

57:57.000 --> 58:03.000
But as Loki said, you know, and we know that Reggie Fils-Aime was recently added to the advisory board and what have you.

58:03.000 --> 58:07.000
And now they have the the chewy guy coming in and trying to fix things as well.

58:07.000 --> 58:11.000
And, you know, GameStop is trying to put themselves on a different path.

58:11.000 --> 58:20.000
And so GameStop may not be the short sell that people have, you know, kind of made it out to be over the past few years.

58:20.000 --> 58:24.000
So anyway. All right. Let's move on to our next story, Dark Sakura.

58:24.000 --> 58:30.000
You have a report on a big demo release this week, right?

58:30.000 --> 58:42.000
Yeah, and it involves a woman of some stature, but they released the name for the the lady from Resident Evil 8.

58:42.000 --> 58:52.000
The the I would say artistically vintage clad woman who.

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
Has a thing for wearing white and really a really bold lip.

58:55.000 --> 59:00.000
I mean, red. It's, you know, groundbreaking anyway.

59:00.000 --> 59:05.000
So her name is Lady Dem- I'm going to mispronounce this.

59:05.000 --> 59:09.000
Dimitrescu, I guess supposed to be like Dimitri-escue.

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
Dimitrescu. And it was actually her name.

59:12.000 --> 59:19.000
She's actually named in a PlayStation blog post and basically Capcom gets it.

59:19.000 --> 59:30.000
But they showed that she reports to someone named Mother Miranda, who leads a cadre of vampires and is behind a lot of the shenanigans.

59:30.000 --> 59:43.000
But she basically as a villain, she's kind of a little bit different because she seems to to have a different kind of menace to her.

59:43.000 --> 59:49.000
But the thing is, is that someone stopped and figured out pretty much how tall she is.

59:49.000 --> 59:56.000
As you know, it wasn't said anywhere, but leave it to, you know, curious people on the Internet who like doing math.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:10.000
So basically one particular writer named Ash Parrish, this actually came from an article that she wrote on Kotaku.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Took the basically guess the age of the home because apparently the castle Dimitrescu was traced back as far as the 15th century, talking about their winemaking.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:33.000
And so she went looking for a 15th century French courtyard doors and found some from the Metropolitan Museum of Art's website.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:44.000
And so doing math skills, so that door was 86 inches and she and the lady stood about a head taller.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
The average head is about eight to nine inches.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:01:00.000
So she added another inch because of the general height, which puts her roughly to 96 inches tall or eight feet tall.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
That's tall, that's very tall.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000
That's not and Zen Monkey in chat says, is this a video game or real people?

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000
It is a video game, but people are treating it like real people.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Right. It's just absolutely I mean.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
But monsters can be crazy.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:26.000
And for those of our friends who are our metric, that's two hundred and forty three centimeters.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Thank you. Or two and a half meters.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000
I did not play the demo on Twitter, too.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
So, you know, pardon me.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I said and people be thirsty on Twitter.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:44.000
It's just all sorts of nonsense regarding these kill me, Ronnie.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Exactly. It's just like she's like, dude,

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:56.000
absolutely statuesque quite literally because she looks like marble.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
She looks like she's made of stone. What is it with her tone?

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000
What is it that people tweet to Katya and Trixie all the time? Like fuck me with a rake, mom or things like that.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Like people on Twitter be crazy.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Oh, all those silly Barbra's.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
All right.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Bobby is saying the top comment on Kotaku on the article, which I find interesting.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I figured she's eight feet tall because the moment I saw her, I felt that she's based on the Japanese urban legend.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Hi, Hachi, shock, kasuma, kasuma, which is literally eight feet tall,

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000
who is about a tall woman dressed in a white dress with a white brimmed hat who stalks and abducts children to kill.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
So an interesting. And that's what the lady's doing is she's abducting children.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Yeah. So maybe. So actually, that makes a lot of sense to me.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I don't even know why I didn't put that together.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Well, that's the first I think that's the first time in the history of the Internet.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000
The comments section has been helpful. That's that's a news report all in itself.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Video game story comments section proves to be helpful.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
The biggest news, this is the biggest news of the week.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.000
We've been doing this fucking show 18 years. That's never happened.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:14.000
This is it. And I don't even know why I didn't put it together, because I was actually just reading about yokai and vengeful vengeful ghosts.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:22.000
And this one, I mean, that same story is played into other video games in the past.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000
And movies, there's been other movies, too.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.000
All right. Bobby Blackwell says, I mean, the Vogue Network comments section is always useful.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Of course. Yes. Thank you for the cheap plug. Of course. Of course. Our own comment section regular.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.000
We're talking about normal normal websites, popular websites.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000
You're average. Yeah. Yeah. Average gamer website.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
All right. Anyhow, let's move on. Next story.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
But thank you to our soccer. I wish I could have played the demo, but it's only on PlayStation five.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Alan said he watched a play through and I've heard things, but I'm also not super big on scary games, but I guess this one isn't gory.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
I guess the preview wasn't very gory. So that's good.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000
We've had the debate on on getting a PS five just off and on.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
But then again, we also want a hot tub and a massage chair.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000
So both were the investments. All right. Moving on.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Loki, what's next? Yeah.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:24.000
So apparently Opera has purchased Yoyo Games, the company behind the popular game making software game maker.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
And that was for 10 million dollars.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:42.000
They're apparently going to use Yoyo Games knowledge and game development to hopefully bolster Opera GX and branching out into a broader ecosystem,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:52.000
making more accessible to making it more accessible to novice users developing the world's leading 2D game engine by commercial studios.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:59.000
So kind of a little bit, a little bit of helping out opera, a little bit helping out Yoyo Games. Cool.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Curious to see what's going to happen with that. Maybe we'll have some of these game maker engine games running natively in Opera GX.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
I mean, obviously, HTML five. I guess you could do that already.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000
But maybe some sort of platform for that storefront. Who knows?

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Yeah. You know, opera isn't I mean, Jason referenced it in the intro a little bit, but it's not always been a browser.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
It's always been a browser that's caught on with the mainstream.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000
So is this some type of bid to maybe position it as like kind of like a gaming type of browser or, you know,

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:35.000
something that that makes more people kind of interested in opera because it would natively have more games?

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
I use opera. Do you?

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000
It's it's my my second browser on my PC.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I use Chrome in opera and I use opera specifically for like all the stuff that I do as a sister with all my nonprofit stuff,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:54.000
just for some of its encryption, although I don't like it at all on my Mac.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000
On my Mac, I really only use Safari, but opera is a great browser. Interesting.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Yeah, active saying the Opera GX was actually released back in twenty nineteen.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:13.000
All right. Well, speaking of games and getting things improved in games, but not necessarily the official way.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Let's talk about Skyrim and a new mod that is allowing it to run at 60 frames a second on a PlayStation five,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:28.000
because you may not have known, even though it's running on a PlayStation five, it's still got a frame rate lock to it, which seems silly.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000
But now, thanks to modding, it's Skyrim at 60 frames a second.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.000
That is exactly, by the way, what the mod is called Skyrim at 60 FPS,

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:44.000
because you might remember that the console versions of Skyrim, the definitive edition do have some some type of mod support,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
but they're like official mods through Bethesda and all this.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.000
But this mod will unlock the game's frame rate on PlayStation five to boost it from 30.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:59.000
And so it will, you know, make things run very smooth, although it may cause some more bugs to appear.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:08.000
It was made using the creation kit, Bethesda's kit, but using a small trick that is in the software that will allow initialization,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:15.000
config or dot INI files to work on the PlayStation four platform, very similar to Xbox or PC.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
So that is what is allowing it to run.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:25.000
And what's interesting is that even if you disable it, it will still work, allowing you to get the trophies.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000
That's interesting, because, yeah, usually when you're running mods, you can't get achievements or trophies,

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.000
because, you know, otherwise they'd make a mod that's just like pop all the trophies.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
So usually they disable it.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000
But this one, actually, even if you have it and you disable it, it will still work.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
It's kind of interesting because of what it's doing.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:51.000
So check that out if you are curious and don't mind maybe some additional bugs caused by the game not officially supporting that sort of thing.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Let's move on. Dark Sakura.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Well, in other news, there is some absorption going on.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:06.000
If we're going to move to another another game, we're going to talk about Blizzard for a bit.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:12.000
They are working on doing more consolidation over Blizzard Entertainment.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Activision is, sorry, by moving in a 200 person design studio.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:28.000
So they're absorbing Vicarious Visions, which has been a subsidiary of Activision since 2005.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:37.000
They worked on Skylanders, Crash Bandicoot, Tony Hawk, and they are being turned solely toward Blizzard's franchises.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:48.000
That includes Diablo and that their former studio head, Jennifer O'Neill, will basically be taking over Blizzard's leadership team.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.000
So I don't know what this means for the Blizzard content.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:00.000
You know, if it's going to mean a little bit more maybe about that remake of Diablo 2.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000
That's what the rumors are saying right now. But, you know, rumor.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Yeah. And so basically, though, that they have nothing official to say about that right now,

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:19.000
but that really is the big thing that they're thinking is going on with that.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:26.000
And also, you know, they're also taking a step from the Warcraft 3 reforged

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:34.000
because of how glitchy and missing features and the really poor Metacritic score.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000
It was actually the lowest score for a Blizzard game.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000
So I'm wondering if that might have something to do with it as well.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Yeah. You know, we haven't really heard stories about Blizzard expanding into new studios in a very, very or, you know,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
expanding their name and other studios in a very, very long time.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.000
The last time I can think of is what like Blizzard North, which didn't really stick around a long time.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
But even that, like that was back in the 90s, like it was a long time ago.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Maybe the early aughts was when it finally went. But that was because what did they do?

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Did they do the Starcraft? Were they Starcraft Ghost?

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000
There was something they were working on, like a big thing that got canceled.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
But regardless, I don't recall.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Regardless, Blizzard hasn't done much with their game making outside of Irvine.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000
I mean, yes, I know there was like Paris, but that was a lot of like,

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
I think it was a lot of customer service and marketing for the Europe audience and so forth.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Like a lot of the game making is really right there in Irvine.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000
So we haven't heard like of them really expanding out of there.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
At least correct me in chat if I'm wrong,

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000
but I don't think they've been making a lot not in that office for quite some time.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
So this is, you know, pretty big news for them.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Vicarious Visions, you know, those Tony Hawk remakes they just did not that long ago were really well received.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000
You know, for being the fact that they were Tony Hawk remakes, especially, you know,

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I know people love those games, but you know, I don't think people had the bar set very high for the remakes,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
but it really did live up to it.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.000
So hearing that they could be on a Diablo 2 remake, seeing as, you know,

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.000
the expectations would be very high for that, seeing as the Warcraft 3 remake did not land.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
I think Blizzard, the way Blizzard hoped it would,

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000
it could be very interesting to see what that could mean for Blizzard's future.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Because Blizzard, we'll see.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Blizzard needs some good news.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000
They're going to do a Three Vikings MMO.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
That would be rad. I'd be in for that.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Right?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Yeah. So, you know, again, if you want to believe rumors, which, you know, take it or leave it,

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Overwatch 2 doesn't appear to be coming anytime soon.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Diablo 4, we don't know what's going on with that,

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000
but that Diablo phone game they sure killed a BlizzCon over still isn't out.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:44.000
So it just seems like Blizzard kind of needs a lot of good news and fast.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000
So maybe this Vicarious Visions, them being on board will help them get there.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
We'll see.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
All right.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Fingers and toes.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Yeah, fingers and toes.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
We are, I'm rooting for Blizzard.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
You know, they make a lot of great games and I want to see them continue to do that.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000
I haven't agreed with all their decisions in the past couple of years,

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
but I hope they get back there.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000
I hope they find it.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
All right.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Act F says the rumor mill says the Overwatch 2 is coming 2022.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
That's a long wait.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Especially for a game that feels like it's really derivative of the first game,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
but maybe that is something they're trying to set out to change,

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
and that's why it's going to take a little longer.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
I don't know. We'll see.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
I hope they get Diablo 4 out this year,

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
but then at the same time, as much as I'm like,

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
they need to get the game out this year, but they need to get it right.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Right?

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Don't rush it.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
It's hard.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
I say, get it out this year, but don't rush it.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000
It sucks, but that's the reality of, you know,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
you got to get the games out to make money.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
That's how it goes.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000
All right.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Questbuster is pointing out Diablo Immortal, the phone game.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
It's in closed testing right now.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
There have been a few streamers that showed it off, excuse me,

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
and the early word is that it's fun?

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Well, that would be a great redemption arc for Blizzard.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
If that Diablo phone game kicks ass, that's good news.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
I don't see that as a negative at all.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Good. Good.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Make all that bullshit they put up with that one BlizzCon

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
and the, don't you all have phones?

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Make it, make that payback in dividends.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Make the next Pokemon go.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
I'd love that for Blizzard.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:26.000
My expectation is very guarded, but this early news is welcome.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Believe it or not, I want the Diablo phone game to do well.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
I'd love that.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Why would you want it to flop after they spent this much time on it?

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Anyway.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Just want to watch the world burn, Rob.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
I know, I know.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
All right.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Anyway, let's move on.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Let's talk about another game that's had some awfully long longevity.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
I mean, this game and streaming especially,

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
like so many streamers are on this game

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
and my husband contributes to this on a regular basis.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
He doesn't stream it himself.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
I wish he would.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000
But he plays on other streams and plays a lot of this game.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Yeah.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000
So Dead by Daylight, they're,

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
well, they sort of announced in a kind of roundabout way

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:16.000
that they're working on colorblind modes for the game.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
A roundabout way.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000
That's a nice way to put it.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Yeah, it's a very nice way to put it.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:28.000
So the, I guess, live balance designer Ethan Larson

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
had a personal Twitch stream where he was playing Dead by Daylight

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000
and there's people that were asking him about colorblind mode

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.000
to which I guess he gets asked that often.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
And so he was getting irritated by that.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000
And so he made the comment, you know, it's getting really boring.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
We've heard it a million times.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000
We know continuing to badger us about it isn't going to change anything.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
If it gets done, it'll get done when we have time to do it

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000
or somebody decides that's something that should be done.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000
We know a lot of players want it.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
We know it's not a small number.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000
We get it.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Yeah.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
It's not the most polite way of putting it.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000
I saw the clip and it was very much a yikes.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:13.000
You know, I understand that the guy gets asked about this a lot

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
and he's probably sick of being asked about it.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.000
But the response that he gave, it's very obvious he's not on the PR side.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Very cringy.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000
And it is very cringy, to put it lightly.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.000
And I think the reality is, whereas it's frustrating for him,

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000
I think what he needs to realize is that it's incredibly fucking frustrating

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
when you want to play a game, but you can't

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
because it doesn't have the accessibility options you need

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
in order to make the game playable.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000
And I think he just had a huge foot in that.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.000
And this is a very difficult lesson learned for everybody in the industry

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000
who wants to do their own streams on the side and so forth

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
is that if you open yourself up like that,

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
you're going to have to be prepared that people will come in

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
to talk about your games.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
And you're going to need to decide where to draw the line.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Most people I know have a policy of,

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000
I don't talk about my day job when I'm streaming, period.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000
And they don't talk about those games.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
They don't answer.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000
So it's a non-answer.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Unfortunately, for whatever reason, maybe he's spoken about the game before,

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
whatever, this guy did not have the same policy.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:27.000
He spoke his mind about the game, and his mind was not in a good place.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Apparently not.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
He's like, listen, I'm just trying to kill some people in this game.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
I mean, come on.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
But again, I would say...

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
You have boundaries, but there's a thing called tact.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Yes.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000
It was very tactless.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000
It was very tactless.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000
And I would tell this guy again, you think it's frustrating for you,

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
try being one of these people trying to play your game, and they can't

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
because of this feature that you keep promising and you keep not implementing.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Well, but now, Loki, I'm sorry.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
You can go ahead and finish.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:00.000
But they put out some screenshots showing it's in development and that type of stuff.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.000
So basically, we have been working on Carblight Mode for some time,

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000
and we are planning to release it shortly.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Before that, of course, they said this is not how we wanted to reveal this,

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:16.000
but we feel it's the right time, that they said in the official Twitter.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
So yes, they are working on it.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000
They still have a date yet when it's going to be made available,

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:27.000
but I don't know.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Yeah, that's why PR needs to be more involved sometimes with how people interact with,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
especially with different developers and stuff like that.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000
You've got to have people that are on board with the right messaging

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.000
because if you're just saying something ridiculous like either this guy

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:47.000
or back when the guy was one of those developers that was working on Stadia

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:52.000
talking about how you should be lucky that we don't charge you to stream our games.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Okay, maybe some of these people shouldn't be talking to the public.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Yeah, that is a very good point.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:08.000
And I hate to say it because this goes against everything I really try to preach on this show,

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000
but I think here's a good example of maybe streaming isn't for everyone.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Maybe you shouldn't do a podcast, and this is one of those cases.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000
And I would tell this guy, in the future,

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I think it's really in your best interest and everyone's best interest,

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
you don't play Dead by Daylight on your stream.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Play something else.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
I think it's in everyone's best interest.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
You don't do that in the future, including yours.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Because you know this guy had a chat with some people,

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
and it probably was not a pleasant one.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000
And I'm sure he was advised of a similar conclusion.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Perhaps don't play this game so that people will look to you to be the authority

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:59.000
in speaking out on this game when you are not trained on how to speak to the public on this game.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
So, anyway.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
All right. That was pretty cringey.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Let's move to another cringe topic and talk about Fox News for a minute.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
I'm sorry, that transition was just way too easy.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.000
I saw a cheap shot and I had to take it.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Let's talk about this story that's kind of floating around,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.000
and it's one of those, it's being by official people that say,

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:31.000
no, that isn't really true, but let's talk about it since this is a show about what gamers are talking about as well.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
And this is about Mass Effect 2.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Jamie, I'm sure you've seen this cross your feed.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Apparently, the character Jack in Mass Effect 2 was originally supposed to be pansexual.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:48.000
If you are not familiar with that term, it is a term similar to bisexuality.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:58.000
But for some individuals, to say bisexuality implies that there is a binary when it comes to things like gender.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:05.000
And the term pansexuality is to kind of get around that essentially by saying you are attracted to all genders.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.000
I am not here to tell people how to define themselves.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.000
That is a topic I don't want to address because if you consider yourself bi, you consider yourself pan,

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:20.000
that is a journey for you and what have you.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
I just want to make sure people understand when they see that term.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
That's basically what it means.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Jamie, did I do a fair assessment there just to make sure?

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Yes.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Okay, thank you. All right.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Now, let's talk about Jack.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
And why do we say that with Jack?

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Because Jack is only romanceable by male Shepard or M Shep in the game.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Originally, the rumor is she was supposed to be romanceable by female Shepard as well,

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:55.000
which would have made her the first character that actually romances both sexes.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Hold on, I know you're all going to say Liara, but the difference with Liara is that the Asari were a mono-gendered race.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.000
There is only one gender of Asari that is very female presenting.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000
So most people just assume all Asaris are female, basically.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000
But there is a difference there.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:18.000
That's what would have been the big deal about Jack is because Jack would have truly been a human, essentially, that is a pangender character.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Gender, pansexual.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000
I'm sorry. Yes, I'm sorry. Pansexual is what I meant to say.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Although pangender is real and valid.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Oh, no, I'm very well aware. Yes, yes, absolutely.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Anyway, anyhow, and it's been years since this game came out.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
This game is over ten years old and people kind of wondered.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Because Jack was presented in a way in the game where you kind of, like, I don't know how to say it, but you kind of assumed.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
You never should assume that type of thing.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:54.000
But there were little context clues in the things she would say and her backstory and so forth that kind of made you think,

01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:01.000
you know, she probably, when it came to sexuality, was a very, you know, fluid character.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
And that didn't end up actually being the case.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
And so that was a little bit of a surprise.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Now, apparently what happened, if rumors are to be believed, is because when the original Mass Effect game launched,

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Fox News did a whole stupid ass thing where they were getting in there.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:23.000
And I want to say the people that were even on this panel went back and said they'd never played the damn game.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Which was so fucking frustrating.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.000
But anyway, it led to all this criticism about Mass Effect.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000
But the feelings were still hurt, so, you know, it's valid, right?

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:39.000
So apparently the sex scenes in Mass Effect got criticism and then the fact that there was a non-straight romance,

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
but it's far more complicated than that, honestly.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:51.000
But anyway, and as the story goes, apparently because of this Fox News and what ended up getting discussed there,

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000
they had to kind of scale back what was happening with Jack.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Also kind of adding fuel to the fire, the voice actress for Jack, Courtney Taylor, said she was originally supposed to be a pansexual character.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
In a quote,

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:33.000
She's saying this in a nice way to not make BioWare the bad guy, I think, and that is speaking with tact.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000
That's the way to do it. Just an interesting roundabout way.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.000
She's able to criticize, yet compliment. See that?

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Anyway, I don't know if it came down to a budget constraint or maybe someone being like,

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000
this is too obvious, because everyone was like, of course she's a lesbian.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000
But my sense was always that she was pansexual and it just didn't get followed through.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Of course the community modded it immediately so you can have it your way.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:02.000
And so that obviously led to, or sorry, an interesting thought is that in the very first game,

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:09.000
there was a same-sex romance between male Shepard and Kate and Alinko where the lines were taped for it.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:16.000
And you can actually mod those lines back into the game, but it's just they never fully finished the rendering and all that.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.000
So if you try to do it with mods, it's a little bit held together by duct tape, we'll say.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.000
But you can do it through mods. So anyway.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:33.000
But this makes me think that when they do the new release, if they might put those options back in.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:40.000
I would love that so much as just a nice little extra thing, especially since it's all there anyway.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.000
You're absolutely right. If they're going to go back and do the remaster trilogy anyway,

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:50.000
if the voice acting already exists, if they're going back and fixing Mass Effect 1 anyway,

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000
I don't know how much they're changing too, but why not put some of these romances back in?

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
That would be amazing.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:02.000
I would be happy to give my money all over again for that to kind of be the definitive version of the game

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.000
where Jack is pansexual, as even the voice actress thought she was supposed to be,

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:12.000
where Kayden was able to have a gay romance with male Shepard since the first game,

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
the way it was originally written as.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:23.000
I realize for everybody it's not a big deal, but for me, I think I'd love that. It would be great.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:32.000
And the thing that people need to realize is that it would be bisexual or pansexual either way,

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:42.000
which often is fairly erased. I mean, how many times have we had female friends who were in a relationship with a girl

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:47.000
and then you hear, oh, they've gone straight. No, they haven't. They're bisexual.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Yeah. And it's a real problem with men too.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:56.000
There's a lot of men who don't come out as bisexual because they just get labeled gay.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000
And so it's the bisexual erasure, essentially.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:06.000
And again, I'm not trying to get too preachy here, but I'm trying to help people who maybe aren't.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.000
But it's part of it.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Yeah. I'm trying to help people who aren't part of the LGBT community.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:14.000
And we have a lot of those that listen to this show who are cis hetero white dudes.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.000
And that's cool. This show's for all gamers.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:23.000
And you guys have always been supportive. I've made no secret on this show that I'm gay.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Jamie makes no secret she's ace.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000
And we've had plenty of people from all around the spectrum on this show,

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000
thanks to taking phone calls and the guests over the years.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:37.000
But my point is I'm trying to explain it in a way so that maybe if it's not a big deal for you,

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.000
you can understand a little bit better maybe why it's a big deal for somebody else.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:49.000
That's all. I'm not trying to, you know, say every video game character in the world needs to be bi.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:57.000
No. But it would be nice to have that representation out there because a lot of times in social settings,

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000
it gets erased because somebody will say, I'm bisexual.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.000
And then it's like, no, you're not because you're married to somebody the opposite gender.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Like, you haven't been bisexual since college. That is shit that people say.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000
I know. Or like, but you married a guy. And I'm like, yeah.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
So? Yeah.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Does that change anything? No.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.000
No. Anyway. Thank you.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.000
DJ Rama S in chat says, Rob, you are not being preachy. You are teaching others, which is always a good thing.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Yes, I am coming from a place of teaching. That is what we're trying to do here at OLR.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Pixel pockets and chat says, thanks, OLR. I appreciate you talking about this.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Not a problem. It's you know what? And here's the thing.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Like, I'm part of the LGBTQ community, right? I'm I'm a gay dude.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:50.000
But I realized that I am a gay dude that, you know, yes, gay dudes.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
There's a lot of bullshit that happens, a lot of stuff we have to fight out there.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.000
And I've really seen it, you know, kind of change over the past 20, 25 years.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:07.000
But I very clearly understand and have seen how black and brown gay people have it worse and transgender.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000
How about the rampant misogyny among gay men? Oh, yeah, it's an issue.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Yeah, absolutely. Gold star gay. It's a gross term. It really is.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000
I have punched somebody before for saying, oh, it's OK that I grabbed you.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000
It's because I'm gay. No, it's not OK. I didn't give you permission to touch me.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Absolutely not OK. Not OK. And, you know, and and transgender men and women like, you know, they are still a part of that community.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000
And so I think from the beginning. Absolutely.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Who threw the first brick at Stonewall? And my my my point with all that is that like I.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:50.000
So I do have. Yes, I am gay, but I recognize that there's a lot of other stuff and I'm going to use this position to try to teach about the other stuff, too.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.000
And I might not be bisexual myself. I'm very comfortably gay.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:04.000
But when I do kind of sit back and think about like and I've because I've dated bisexual dudes in the past, you know, and I'm married now.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000
But in the past, I've dated bisexual men and I've seen it kind of firsthand.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:15.000
And, you know, maybe I wasn't always perfect myself either. And I've kind of realized over the years, like, oh, man, that was a fucked up thing I said.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:21.000
And I should maybe like teach others not to hurt somebody the way I might have in the past.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And I think that's the best way you can kind of atone for a mistake you did in the past.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Everybody has problematic things in their past. The ones who stay problematic are the ones who are the problem.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Those who learn and change are are the ones who should go out and help others learn and change as well.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:50.000
And then let's see. Act up says so many things wrong with the world and especially with minorities and minorities within minorities.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Yes. And I think I think the phrasing may have come off. I totally know what you mean to say there.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:59.000
And yes, absolutely. And Tiger class says, what about people who are asexual? I'm sure they're often mocked.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Dude, all the time, like all I you know, and maybe it's not my place to explain all the ways.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:12.000
But like, I know plenty of asexual people. One of them is loud and proud here on this program.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:21.000
And I'm sure Jamie, maybe you want to speak on this. But like, there is so much bullshit that asexual people have to put up with.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Oh, yeah, because we're like even more mythical, I think, bisexual people in some cases.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:37.000
But maybe and I'm putting my sarcasm voice on. Maybe you just haven't found the right person yet, Jamie.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Yeah, that's yeah. And to be fair and where I where I can relate, that's the same line that's been this is why we're part of the same family.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:54.000
That's the same line that's been used against me as to why don't I date women?

01:30:54.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Oh, you just haven't found the right woman yet. It's not that there's lots of wonderful women in the world.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:13.000
It's not that I'm just not wired that way. That's not how it works. And so I love going to people and say, well, when did you decide to be straight?

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Or some guy who's, you know, oh, you need to go out and get, you know, get a wife like, well, why haven't you found a husband yet?

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:37.000
I love turning the I love turning the conversation around on them. I do, you know, and like and like for me, for for me being, you know, who and what I am, you know, I it doesn't matter who accepts it or not.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:47.000
I don't care. It's not going to change. You know, this person that I am, you're not it's not going to change. Other people's opinion isn't going to change the fact.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:58.000
And that's with everything going on. The whole covid thing, all of it. You cannot just delude yourself into pretending something doesn't exist or something isn't real.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:10.000
And to treat somebody like there's something wrong with them because they don't fit into your viewpoint of what they should be is disgusting.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:17.000
It is a disgusting habit. It's a disgusting thing that people are teaching their children and it needs to fucking stop.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:22.000
And let's let's have another teaching moment here in chat. I was going to wrap this up, but I need to address this question.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Tiger con chat says, is pansexual someone who's attracted to something that isn't human, right?

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:32.000
That's actually incorrect. But let me set you on the right path here in a moment. Would furries fall into that?

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Because there are people who are into anthropomorphic characters. Furries could fall into that category.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:43.000
But pansexual is basically, as I understand it, I am not pansexual myself.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:50.000
But as I understand it, people use that label because they are attracted to somebody regardless of gender.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:54.000
There are multiple, there are more than two. There are more than two genders.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:01.000
However, there are a lot of bisexual individuals that still feel that the historical purpose is because I want to make sure this is clear.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:07.000
There's a lot of bisexual people who also feel that way and who will also say, I use the label bisexual because what I'm comfortable with.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:13.000
But I also recognize there's more than two genders. Just because I say I'm bisexual doesn't mean I won't date somebody who's nonbinary, you know, or something like that.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:22.000
So I do want to make sure that point because that is an argument that I think is greater than this show that the community has to kind of figure out.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:29.000
That I also kind of think it's really like I'm not here to tell somebody what label they need to use to identify themselves.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:37.000
But I will say to educate the comment pansexuality has nothing to do with inner species. That's not what it is.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.000
It's just all genders, period.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:58.000
And to offer a really good reason, one of my favorite podcasts, Stuff Mom Never Told You, did several different episodes on outlying bisexuality, different sexualities, gender identity, a bunch of really good episodes.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:06.000
And if you really want something well researched and in-depth, I would absolutely say go find those episodes.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Because they really go well into detail.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Yes. And let me say one more thing to be fair and then I will refer you out to other shows and other podcasts to further educate on this topic as Jamie just did because I think that's the right idea.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:25.000
But I just want to make sure I'm clear because when we talk about like furries and that is furries pansexual.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Furries can be pansexual. Furries can be gay. Furries can be straight. Furries can be anything. Just like, you know, humans can be.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:43.000
I think it's also important to state though that furry is not always a sexual thing. And I think that most furries I know would want me to make that clear.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Being furry isn't instantly a sexual thing. It's not about that for everybody. For some, sure.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Being furry can also mean that you're into that kink. Just like some people are into leather as a kink. Some people are into role play of different varieties as their kink.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:17.000
But furry is more like, I put it along the lines of like the Lolita and everything as a lifestyle as a community.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:26.000
That you happen to identify with a particular animal to show part of your persona.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:32.000
So the furries who are into it for a sexual nature, that's furry kink.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Yeah, it's a furry kink. Exactly. Like a leather kink.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:44.000
I mean, we all know puppies actually kind of marry the furry and leather together.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000
We're getting way too much into the kink community.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Yeah, let's go back. But look, hey, you know what? Those of you that have listened to this whole thing while we've completely deviated from the original story and used it as a moment to teach.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Just thank you guys for letting us teach and letting us kind of like talk about some of these issues that are important to us sometimes.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
What I do as a sister.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:12.000
I know. And I just I just want to say how much I appreciate this OLR family and the people and Loki who just sits there and listens.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:23.000
I appreciate everybody that lets us do this and realizes that, you know, we're just here to try to make you maybe think a little bit different.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Put yourself in some shoes that maybe aren't necessarily yours.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:34.000
And I think so much of what so many people are asking for on social media about gaming and so forth, a lot of representation on that stuff.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:44.000
So much of it becomes so much more clear when you do take a moment to put yourself in somebody else's shoes that I think it is important once in a while for us to just like have some little reminders here.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000
A little few reminders here on our.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000
So thank you for letting us teach and thank you for listening, especially if you made it all this way.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Appreciate it. And hey, if anyone has questions, I'm sure would be happy to answer a message or three on on the Twitters.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Right. Absolutely. But I know if you're going to ask me about furries, I'm going to refer you to some people I know that might be willing to answer those questions.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:11.000
So I mean, I may not know the answer myself, but I probably know somebody, you know.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Yeah. So I definitely know.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:24.000
I mean, I think many of our circles in the community overlap, so we know we know people who know people who know people.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Or as Fifth Dream in chat says, refer you.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:37.000
All right. Thank you. That was that was the cheap joke we needed to move on.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.000
All right. Let's get to the classic game of the week.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.000
It doesn't in this case, but it would be OK if it did.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:51.000
All right. We're going to take a trip down memory lane and dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Hey, you brats, you should you should check this game out.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Put down your mass effects and your your new fangled games.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000
You don't need a remaster. You need the classics. Dark soccer.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000
What is the classic game of the week?

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:18.000
I picked Devil Summoner Soul Hackers, which is a game I still have two copies of, and I forgot who wanted my extra copy, so shrug emoji.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:25.000
But at any rate, it is a role playing game developed by Atlas that's part of the Megami Tensei series.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:36.000
It is the second of the Devil Summoner sub series. It was originally published by Atlas for the Sega Saturn in 1997, ported to the PlayStation in 1999,

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.000
and then got a release on the Nintendo 3DS in 2012.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:52.000
So it takes place in a town called Amami City, which is a very technologically advanced Japanese town or big city, I should say.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:39:02.000
And so you are playing a member of a hacker group called the Spookies who are trying to get into a closed beta for something called Paradigm X,

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.000
which is an online game that would connect the citizens of the city.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:17.000
And so they meet supernatural forces while working on it and have to work with this hacker group to see what's going on,

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:29.000
because demons suddenly pop up, including one called Nemisa, who is a demon that possesses his friend Hitomi.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:36.000
So it began development in 1996 after the first Devil Summoner.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:46.000
The character design was done by Kaneko Kazuma, and the original producer was Okada Koji.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:55.000
And so while none of the other Soul Hacker, I'm sorry, the first two versions of Soul Hackers never did get the US release,

01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:02.000
the 3DS version was localized and it actually had a fairly positive reception.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Yeah, I'm hacking them souls, Phoenix.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Anyway, like I said, it is a role play game.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:16.000
You navigate your dungeons in a first person view and you have puzzles and you fight in turn based battles.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:24.000
You have one or two human characters in your party, but you also have the ability to summon up to four demons to fight with you.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:30.000
And you'll get access to these demons by speaking to enemy demons and negotiating with them.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:34.000
So you have to answer questions or intimidate or give them things that they look for.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:41.000
And then you can fuse all of your demons into a single demon if you want to.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:47.000
It's kind of crazy. That was actually fairly, fairly novel for its time.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:54.000
And then you have to manage your demons based on their personalities, alignment, abilities.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.000
So like a friendly one would be healing or defensive.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:02.000
A sly one would attack enemies by themselves.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:07.000
But if you give them an ability that they don't want to use, think of like Pokemon like that way,

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:16.000
there is a risk that they will refuse to do that or do something completely different or not do anything at all.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:21.000
And different demon alignments, they can choose not to cooperate.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000
They can be antagonistic toward each other.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:32.000
But you are able to also get at these marketplaces, magnetite that is fuel for demons.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:38.000
And if you run out of magnetite, then your demons start taking damage.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.000
So that's pretty much as it is.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:50.000
So you are going through, you have other members of your group.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:56.000
And you have characters named 6Lunch, Yuichi, and then Hitomi.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:05.000
And so they were basically doing just pranks, shenanigans.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:09.000
And then it goes all downhill from there.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.000
So this has nothing to do with Pokemon.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Although the whole demon thing, the way that you treat them,

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:25.000
I would say would be a more complicated play on, I guess, the Pokemon kind of theme.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Well, there were a lot of games not long after, and this is kind of in that era of not long after Pokemon,

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:36.000
that were trying to, I don't want to say copy it because obviously this game isn't that,

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.000
but kind of find the similar formula.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Find the secret that helps the game be successful.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
I don't know.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:54.000
But also, several of the Persona people who later went on to the Persona games

01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:00.000
worked on this one too, including Shigenori Sulejima.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:05.000
He was actually responsible for sub-character designs and item graphics and character portraits.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:13.000
But basically, this one tried to move it around to different points of view

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.000
of the different characters as they went through the game.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:23.000
And even tried to work in a devil motif and design into some of the characters.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:31.000
A lot of this is just really embedded into the game and has shown up in later on games.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:39.000
So there were a few different things that went on.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Like this particular character, the main protagonist, was not a trained summoner like the first one.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.000
This one had to learn everything as you went along.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.000
So it was actually pretty interesting.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:59.000
And they really pushed a little bit more of that cyberpunk setting with this game

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:05.000
and used completely different styles of music to make them go together.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:12.000
For example, music being the fusion of jazz and electronica.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:17.000
And that was composed by Meguro Shoji.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:22.000
He did really good work. He also did work on Macanex.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:28.000
But anyway, the game itself was released for the Sega Saturn on November 13th, 1997.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:33.000
And had a supplementary disc that was called Devil Summoner Soulhacker's Akuma Zenshō 2.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.000
That came out on December 23rd of the same year.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:42.000
And that contained a postcard entry for a draw from one of 1000 copies of an extra dungeon.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Because the game was so popular, it got a PlayStation release on April 8th, 1999.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:54.000
And then there was of course a Sony budget released on July 27th, 2000.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:45:00.000
The PlayStation port had new story events, including the Paradigm X casino

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.000
and the version of the Devil Zenshō 2 dungeon.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:12.000
The Nintendo 3DS version came out. It was announced to be released in 2012 on August 30th.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:18.000
And the port was based off the PlayStation version, but also included some different enhancements to it.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:24.000
There was a new demo that came out. All kinds of goodies were put into it.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Some redesign for some of the music, some of the sound.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:37.000
And then the game was released in Japan on the eShop on December 25th, 2014.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Sorry, not you. I talked to Alan. Sorry.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Anyway, so it did get American. I thought my mouth was away from the mic.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.000
I wasn't even looking at you. I just got quiet. Oh, I'm sorry.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Anyway, the game was announced for North American release December 2012.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.000
It was published April 16th, 2013 by Atlas USA.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.000
And then it's a digital download July 2nd.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:13.000
So Soul Hackers is one of the 10 original Megami Tensei characters to be rated M for Mature.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:20.000
It did get a European release on September 20th, 2013.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000
And digital on September 25th.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:28.000
So for the localization, they tried to localize the PlayStation version,

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:35.000
but because of Sony of America's content approval policy, it didn't quite make it out.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.000
So the 3DS version is the first one to be released outside of the US.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:48.000
They were trying to treat it like a new game as opposed to a port in the US.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:54.000
So the translation part took about a month. The localization took around eight months.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:01.000
And they tried to introduce some elements of humor, like the Japanese script did.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.000
And so if they didn't think it would work well as a direct translation,

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.000
they did a little bit of fourth wall breaking.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.000
So a few things that weren't quite in the original.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:18.000
So anyway, the 3DS version of Soul Hackers had some average reviews.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:22.000
A lot of people enjoyed the battle system,

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:29.000
but some people thought that there just was a little bit more that could have been done.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Like the dungeon had some blurry wall textures and that it was getting monotonous.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:40.000
But they thought the battle system was a good amount of reward for the effort that it took.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:50.000
So when it first was released, Soul Hackers sold 160,850 units in its first week.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:57.000
And as of 2007, the game had sold 258,679.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.000
It became the 27th best selling Saturn title in Japan.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:09.000
And of course, you know, the fact that we got it in the US at all was, I'd say, fairly good.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.000
It was great.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:17.000
But the one that we got, I'd say, was pretty outdated by the time that we got it.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:22.000
You know, if we go back and play it on Saturn, heck yeah, that looks great.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Not everything in bringing it over worked well for the 3DS.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:35.000
And I do have an extra copy of Soul Hackers.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.000
So let me know if you want it.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.000
We'll talk.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000
All right.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:44.000
The case is cracked, I think, but the game still works.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.000
All right.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Well, thank you so much for because I have to admit, this is this is a game I didn't know much about at all.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:59.000
So it's I like how sometimes the classic game of the week is is a very obvious thing, you know, for lack of a better word, like a game.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Yeah, I was going to give it to Bobby.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
All right, Bobby, it's yours.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
I was going to give the game to Bobby.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Bobby, remind me to send it to you.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.000
And then sometimes you get a game where it's like, what the hell is this?

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Or I'm sure like there's probably two or three people in chat that are like, fuck, yeah, this game, you know, but the rest of us have no idea.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:20.000
So it's it's fun to sometimes learn about a new game.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.000
So, yeah.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Well, and, you know, I have a big love for a lot of those Saturn RPGs.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Of course.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:29.000
I mean.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:39.000
One game I would totally love to I need to actually, I guess, burn myself a translated copy is a black matrix.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:48.000
But there's just some amazing RPGs that came out in the Saturn that never saw the light of the day in the US unless they had been ported to PlayStation.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:56.000
I think it's no secret that if you go through the history of the classic game of the week, which you can do over on the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki, if you rely on.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Thank you for updating it.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:04.000
If you actually go back to that and look through it, you're going to find that the classic games of the week, they're kind of disproportionately Sega.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:08.000
But that's that's OK. It's it's, you know, it's Jamie segment and that's the game sheet.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
All right.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:17.000
If someone has time, I'm looking at several people in chat, make a chart for me.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Make me a pie chart, a pie chart.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
You want you want spreadsheets, you want cross tabs?

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
No, I don't spreadsheets.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
I want a pie chart.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
I just want that.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Well, we have monkey bread.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Damn monkey bread.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:39.000
But anyway, I want I want a couple of pie charts, one of them by publisher, like original, you know.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Company publishing it, developing and then one by system.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Like original system release, I guess, that I reviewed it for.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:57.000
All right. What she's asking for, we need a classic game access database so we can run reports.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
All right.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
I'm going to go get my monkey bread.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Yes. Get your bread.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:03.000
I have more monkey bread.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
But don't miss rapid fire news.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.000
I worked hard.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:12.000
All right. That's what we're going to get into next is our rapid fire news segment and get into that.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000
First, before we do that, I got to ask Loki because I didn't call this out earlier in the show.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:20.000
But is is that not President Cat running behind you tonight?

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
The game is president or is OK.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.000
I'm sure most of our fans know the story by now.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:32.000
But if you didn't, because this was inauguration week, after all, this would have been back in 2008.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.000
It was a long time ago, OK, because this is when Obama ran for office the first time.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
And yes, this show was on the air.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.000
It was already over five years old at that point.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:48.000
But we were doing release dates, which is a segment that's coming up here on our show quite shortly.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000
We're going to get into release dates.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:52.000
For those of you watching live can see it over there on the sidebar.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:57.000
And we came across this game, which I believe the name was Suki bonds.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:02.000
So chow Renno, we it was Suki bonds and chow chow Renno.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:07.000
We it was basically like a corporate delinquent girl.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:14.000
But I misread a shout out because I mean, I knew what it meant, but it was hard to describe.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:18.000
So I was like president something. And thus the name President Cat was born.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:28.000
We started calling this game President Cat. And it kind of led to this whole soapbox moment where we were talking about the Nintendo Wii and all that,

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:32.000
because that's what this game was for and all the shovelware that was coming out for Nintendo Wii at the time.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.000
And I think, you know, and this actually ties into the classic game of the week that Jamie's did really,

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:42.000
because this was a note of we're sitting here going, why is this game only exists in Japan?

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Quick, how many of you in chat? Look at this.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:50.000
This is Cat doing crazy shit out in the real world, like skateboarding down a hill and all this stuff.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:54.000
This looks fucking ridiculous. How many of you in chat would play this?

01:52:54.000 --> 01:53:01.000
And of course, all of your hands shot up immediately because when have you had like a game here starring a cat doing things?

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:04.000
And so the concept of President Cat was just kind of like ludicrous.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:10.000
But at the same time, is it the silliest thing you've ever heard about on the Wii? Not by a long shot.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:15.000
So why wasn't the Wii getting more stuff like this, especially when it had already been released in Japan?

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:21.000
So this led to a whole thing about we need to localize President Cat and we actually tweeted the developer.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Now, here's the here's the funny kind of other side of this.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Apparently, this game didn't do well in Japan.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:30.000
It was the worst selling game on the Wii, apparently.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Did anybody more than a former Kotaku writer claim to have the facts behind that?

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Because I still question that to this day.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:47.000
I cannot understand how this would possibly be the worst selling game, especially when people over here were importing it.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:51.000
It only sold 100 copies. Ten of them were over here. I don't think so.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
I don't think so.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:59.000
I never saw the receipts to justify those headlines. I'm sorry.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:06.000
So anyway, my point with that whole thing is so but we did get some like minor coverage on some of the blogs

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:12.000
because the company behind President Cat actually noticed us because this was back when Twitter was still kind of new.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:17.000
And so it was like, why are all these people in America getting excited about this game that we're not even releasing there?

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.000
And so they started tweeting us.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Thank you, we think. Thank you for being a fan. Please look forward to the game, you know, like those types of things.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
I think not fully understanding.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.000
I'm actually checking the Wikipedia page to see if we're still mentioned in it.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Yep. Our article that we were in, I found it.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Yeah.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:36.000
It's still from Destructoid.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
I'll link it in chat.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:46.000
And DJ Rama S in chat says, fact, one of the cons I attended, ZenkaCon, got this game in its gaming room either 2008 or 2009.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:49.000
And yeah, like.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:57.000
I again, I failed to see how because the rabble rabble star and, you know, it's the one thing we kind of did here at OLR and also we started it.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
And the rabble rabble got kind of out there.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:07.000
And now, you know, anime cons are bringing it in and so forth because, yes, you know, as it turns out, people love cats.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Even people who are allergic are kind of like, man, I wish I wasn't allergic to cats.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.000
You know, there's at least kind of usually that moment. Sorry.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Sorry to anybody out there who is allergic to cats who might feel differently.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:21.000
But I still feel that the vast majority of people love cats.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
More people love cats than love Madden.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
That's a fact.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
That is a fact.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:30.000
So I.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Yeah. Anyway, so I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get on a tangent, but we haven't talked about that little thing in a while.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Loki's background made me think of that and how to this day we never did get our localized copy.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Apparently the publisher did go under not like so maybe that that's the only receipt done.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Yeah, that's that's the only receipts I've seen that maybe this game didn't do that well after all.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.000
But yeah. So anyway, sorry.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.000
I don't know where I was going with that, but just 109 bucks for it now.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:03.000
And I want the game. What's that? I have the game.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.000
You can never copy. OK, thank you. Or you can borrow my copy. I don't care.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:11.000
I have it still. I have the box copy. I thought it was like right here.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.000
But that's not it. But no, I still have it somewhere.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:20.000
I totally want to just play through it now that I'm getting better with reading.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:26.000
All right. Anyway, pod culture says, quick, maybe we can chip in and buy the IP for VOG.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:31.000
I'm not. Well, I think this came up on a show half year or a year ago or so.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:36.000
And I said, I'd buy the rights, but I'm just going to give them to YY are because I'm not going to be.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.000
But now that Loki makes games, maybe maybe I have to retract that.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Sorry, Aaron. But you helped create a monster here in Loki.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.000
And now maybe we got to give the rights to Loki. I don't know.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:55.000
So we should just let it be what it is. There's been already we had the cat president game.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:00.000
We have the people on from that. Just let the meme die.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:09.000
You know what? I need to I need to finally get off my butt and make my my visual novel.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Yes. With one of the characters being President Cat, who is the CEO of Orange Lounge.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:23.000
OK, so speaking of visual novels, then there was a game and I think was it 2012 or 2016.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.000
There was a game called Cat President that ended up coming out on steam.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:34.000
And of course, I reached out equal. Yeah, I reached out to the developer and I was like, do you know who we are?

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000
And of course, it's no. But he came on that show and he was he was a great sport.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:41.000
He had a great sense of humor. All his motivations for the game were perfect.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
And yeah, it's still out there. Check it out.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:50.000
And so he had no I obviously had no idea about this whole dumb thing we had done in 2008 with President Cat and everything.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:53.000
But, you know, we wanted we wanted to give the game our blessing.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:59.000
And we did. And yeah, he ended up making a sequel either in 2016 or this most recent election.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:03.000
I get all the years are boring. It was 2020. OK, perfect.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Yeah, October. Yeah. So and it's great to see him still being successful and so forth.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:13.000
So maybe we'd buy the rights and give it to him. I don't know. Anyway, let's we don't have we don't have the money.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Let's stop joking. All right. Oh, Bobby's digging up all these old tweets.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Wow. Y'all are putting your search engines to work on Twitter tonight.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Now, this. OK, so the account still exists over at Renno. What is President Cat who actually tweeted what is President Cat?

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:37.000
That was the official account of the game. They still have followers.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Yeah, as they should. Even though they're gone, somebody needs to tweet them.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:48.000
You there. You stopped answering my calls. All right.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Moving on. Enough, enough, enough. All right. I don't know if I ever saw that tweet.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:59.000
What is President Cat? Seriously?

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Someday, long after this show is gone. And I'm gone.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:08.000
I want you to print that tweet out and bury me with it.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:12.000
I just can't wait for the articles about this brand new Nintendo game that's coming out.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:18.000
That's all about pooping on things that that just screams, you know, clickbait headlines.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:24.000
So it's just a matter of time. Well, you know, and what's interesting about the whole thing and shout out to YY as well,

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:27.000
because I did beta test his version of Pixel Poops on Steam.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:32.000
And if you all haven't checked that out in the VOG Network discord, go, you know, YY posted a lot of great info.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:37.000
How you can check that game out, too. And it's funny. It's it's interesting because even though

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:45.000
when YY did it on the Vita, it may be sold a few copies with OLR listeners and, you know, a very limited audience.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:51.000
It has its own what was it, Metacritic page. Does it?

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Yeah, because so him putting it on Steam triggered a bunch of different automated things on different websites.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:05.000
So, for example, GameSpot has its own dedicated forums to it. They have its own Metacritic page.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Stuff like that. It's just funny. But yeah, even the Vita version has its own Metacritic page.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:16.000
But there's no reviews, obviously. Well, we need we need to load it up with some force.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:19.000
No, I'm just kidding. Don't don't do anything against the rules.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:25.000
But but my point I was going with all this is that now that you have this NES version, you know,

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:28.000
maybe that's the thing that suddenly gets people to notice.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:34.000
And I think it's going to have a positive effect for what YY did originally as well, because it's the whole.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
This is so fucking weird to talk about.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:43.000
But the whole franchise is going to get a little more boost and a little more notice because you'd not just have the Steam release.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.000
And people are going to notice it there. But this Nintendo crazy thing you're doing, it's going to be there.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:52.000
And I guess there's also this Commodore 64 thing that Aaron has planned.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:57.000
And who knows who's going to see it from there. So it's it's great anyway.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:04.000
And is it and the first one is on Steam, the waiting page, the page landing pages there.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:08.000
So if you want to go wish list that, that'll help with the algorithms. Oh, smart.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:16.000
But or something like that, tentatively, we're looking at February 3rd, but it may get pushed a little bit.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:22.000
We'll see. I'm just rushing to get mine done. That's kind of what we're waiting on.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:26.000
I think he I think he plans to hit that date. I don't think it's getting bumped back anymore.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:32.000
I mean, I think we're going to it's probably going to be the third.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:39.000
If not, then maybe like a week or so, like not it's been pretty close to the third, I think.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Act Defton Chad is saying, so when is President Cat going to be classic game of the week? It's over 10 years old.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:51.000
In my opinion, Jamie has to save that for a very fucking special day.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Like it's her segment. Do what you want. But in my opinion, Jamie, that's the one Jamie pulls out.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Episode one thousand or the last episode.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Oh, well, are inevitably whenever that is, you know, that that's that's the one you save for a rainy day.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Jamie, is your thoughts on that president capping classic game of the week?

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Either that or. I don't know. We'll see.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:18.000
I may have an I may have an idea whenever she damn well feels like it.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:23.000
No one ever helped me with Gwen's thing, so. All right.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Maybe maybe it'll be a charity charity giveaway. OK. All right.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Let's move on and do some rapid fire news. Let's travel around the world and check out some other news from around the gaming universe.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Loki, why don't you start us off? Hey, let's talk about what you're going to get for free with Xbox Live Gold.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Yeah, that's one hundred twenty dollars a year. And that's good.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:54.000
So starting in February, we're going to be getting Gears five on Xbox one and Resident Evil.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Those are going to be your two Xbox one games. Dandera Trials of Fear Edition and Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb and Lost Planet two.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:10.000
So five games in a month. Not bad. And then, of course,

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:14.000
there's lots of fun mods out there for older games.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:20.000
And one of those games being NBA Jam Tournament Edition from nineteen ninety four.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:28.000
So they have a brandy mod that brings the roster of players to current day and they have.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:34.000
So they're calling it NBA Jam 2K21. And there's a lot of new characters that they added.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:39.000
And of course, along with that, a lot of hidden characters that are added to it as well.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:44.000
So, for example, they've got Johnny Cage from Mortal Kombat in there.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:51.000
They have the Flash. There's looks like what we got here.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Kevin Hart has been added there. Hulk Hogan.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:01.000
They had Jean-Claude Van Damme in there.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:08.000
Let's try to see some of the other ones that they kind of really stuck out is funny because we were just talking about NBA Jam last week.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Yeah. So it's timed right. Yeah.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:20.000
It looks pretty funny. So they've got the whole patch you can download out there and they'll update your game with all these new players and everything.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:24.000
So that's pretty awesome. So go check it out.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:31.000
All right. Let's get into some other news and talk about Puzzle Quest is making a comeback.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:38.000
There's a Puzzle Quest three that actually was announced five or five games because they actually recently acquired Infinity Plus two,

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:42.000
which was the studio in Australia that made Puzzle Quest to begin with.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.000
They have announced a free to play sequel called Puzzle Quest three.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Of course, we hear. Yeah, I know. We hear free to play and it's like, you know, they didn't really do.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:58.000
So there were other puzzle quest games after Puzzle Quest two, but it was free to play like Marvel Puzzle Quest and things like that.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Those games weren't necessarily bad per se, but they weren't quite as exciting, I think, as Puzzle Quest one and two.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:07.000
I don't know. I guess it depends what you consider exciting.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:12.000
I liked the whole like single player quest type of elements that one and two brought to the table.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:15.000
So I would like to see that in Puzzle Quest three.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:23.000
But we know very little about it beyond a very vague teaser trailer and the fact that it's supposed to be coming off coming up this year.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:27.000
So by the way, Marvel Puzzle Quest apparently was a licensed spinoff.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:31.000
It wasn't actually from the same studio. So that is kind of interesting.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:37.000
Also worth noting a delay this time. The Uncharted movie delayed again.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:41.000
I'll give you some guesses why with everything going on in the world.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:49.000
But it has been pushed back again to February 11th, 2022, considering I don't even think they've shot a frame of the movie yet.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:53.000
I wouldn't be surprised, quite honestly, if it gets bumped back again,

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:58.000
considering everything that Hollywood has been going through with COVID and all that.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:04.000
This isn't particularly surprising, but we'll just wait a little longer for that, honestly.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Fine. Maybe February 2022 is when it will be safe for me to go to a movie theater.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Even if I still have to wear a mask in the theater, at least I can go and I can watch the damn movie the way I ought to.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:20.000
That would be very nice. So we'll see.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:23.000
All right. Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Well, I'm sorry, just a quick correction. Sorry, chat corrected me.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:31.000
They have been shooting the movie. There are set photos that are out there.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:34.000
I apologize. I didn't think they'd even started shooting it yet.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:37.000
But apparently the post-production is still going to need some extra time.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Sorry, Jamie, but that was an important correction.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:47.000
OK, well, I'm sure a lot of people remember Don't Starve. Great game.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:54.000
But the company that made it, is it Clay is how it's pronounced, Clay Entertainment.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:07:03.000
I think so. Yeah, they were acquired by Tencent and Tencent, as we know, is responsible for League of Legends and Clash of Clans.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:08.000
They acquired a majority stake in Clay Entertainment. Sorry.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:15.000
So and of course, other things that that Clay made, other than Don't Starve, they did Mark of the Ninja as well.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:21.000
But they apparently are still in full autonomy of creative operations, so they should still be in control of their stuff.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:28.000
We'll see what happens with it. And then in other news,

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Imamura Takaya, who designed Star Fox and Tingle has left Nintendo.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Guess we'll never see any Tingle again. That's not true, necessarily.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:51.000
So he he said on his Facebook, it was translated, Today is my last day of coming to work.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:56.000
I took a selfie with the empty office building. It feels pretty sad to think about not coming here anymore.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:00.000
Hats off to myself for 32 years of hard work.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:10.000
So, yeah, he started in 1989 as a graphic artist, designed vehicles and pilots for F-Zero.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:18.000
He designed Captain Falcon. He did the Star Fox franchise, created Fox McCloud and the other characters.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:23.000
And of course, Tingle.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:30.000
I'm going to remember that for the day I retire. Kudos to me. There's more. I made this possible.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:40.000
The general manager of Takara Tomy Arts, Yodo Tomo, said that Imamura will be working with the company as a freelancer.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:45.000
So we'll see. All right. All right.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:52.000
Well, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games that are coming a little sooner than whatever is worked on next.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Bye, Imamura. So, Loki.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:05.000

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:31.000
Starting Life in Another World, The Prophecy of the Throne on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and possibly Super Meat Boy Forever on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
That's it.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
Going over to Japan and checking out the releases there.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:38.000
You know, it's been slow for a couple weeks and they're making up for it this week.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
It's picking back up again for sure.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Over on the Nintendo Switch, March End Forest, Myelin and the Forest Gift comes out this week.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Ume Niko When They Cry, Saku, Nikobako to Musou no Kōkyo Ukyoku comes out this week.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Pang Adventures is out this week.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Alpaca Ball All Stars, I didn't know there was enough Alpaca Ball to make an All Stars, but apparently there is and that is out this week.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:11.000
As is a little game called Disgaea 6, yes the Disgaea series is still around.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:18.000
A Defiance of Destiny is out this week, as is Galgun Returns, all of that on the Nintendo Switch.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Taking a look at the PlayStation 5, nothing this week.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:24.000
They have a new title next week, but nothing this week.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:27.000
But the 4 has many of those same titles.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
March End Forest, also out on the 4.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:35.000
The Ume Niko When They Cry and Disgaea 6, all of those also out on the PlayStation 4 this week.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Another title I missed also on the Switch and PlayStation 4, Ghostrunner is out this week as well.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:43.000
So things are picking back up again over in Japan.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
How about the UK, Darusaka?

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Three things.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:51.000
On the 28th for Switch, Pang Adventures Buster Edition.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:59.000
On the 29th, Anima Arcade Edition for PlayStation and also for PlayStation, Ghost of a Tale Collector's Edition.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Alright.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:03.000
On the 29th, sorry.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Let's get back into some more news and then we'll get to your topics over in our chat room and our mailbag.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:11.000
But first, more news. Loki.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Yeah, so apparently Valve, Capcom and Bethesda have been fined $9.5 million because they were geo blocking PC games on the Steam storefront.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:30.000
So what that basically means is, of course, not allowing folks to purchase games in other regions.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:37.000
So, for example, say the price for a certain game in Germany was cheaper than in Europe.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:45.000
They would disallow them from purchasing it for a lower price, letting them buy the cheaper version of the game.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Apparently geo blocking breaches the EU antitrust rules.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:56.000
So they were fined around 6.2 million euro.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:08.000
And apparently the it says because they were the owners of Steam, Valve chose not to cooperate with the commission.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:11.000
They were fined 1.6 million euro as well.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Wow.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:13.000
So.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Yeah, I don't know if that's going to make any changes, but it sounds like they're just not cooperating with the price of business.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Or if they're actually taking it seriously.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
It sounds like they may just fully not pay.

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:29.000
And that could lead to some heck of a consequences.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:33.000
So I I would be interested to see what the follow up to this is going to be like.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:36.000
What's the comment? What's what's the next step here?

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:40.000
It sounds like they didn't even try to fight it and take it seriously.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Yeah, basically, the executive vice president, Margaret Vester, said such practices deprive European Union consumers the benefit of the EU digital single market and the opportunity to shop around for the most suitable offer in the EU.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
Yeah, interesting.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:15.000
I don't know. Well, sometimes, you know, if the fine's small enough, they just cost of doing business and they'll keep on doing, especially if they've made more than that kind of money, selling it for a higher price.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.000
So we'll see.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Yeah, I need to raise those funds.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:23.000
I'll be curious to see what comes from this as well, or if they actually pull out of business in some of those countries.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:26.000
I don't know. I kind of doubt I doubt it goes to that.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:29.000
But it is very interesting that none of these companies kind of took this seriously.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:37.000
And now we're here and they could face getting kicked out of the countries if they don't pony up the money or try better to fight it, I guess.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:42.000
So this is one of those things to keep your eye on. I think this is probably not the last thing we've heard about this for sure.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:45.000
So, yeah, something else I don't think we've seen the last of.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:51.000
I know we have not seen the last of ever people making their own peripherals and devices at home.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:57.000
But I would love if Nintendo actually did something with this one. They won't. They'll cease and desist it if nothing else.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:05.000
But we can dream. This person made a homebrew Labo kit. In other words, they made it out of cardboard.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:06.000
I don't think they really made it.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:11.000
I'm glad someone's actually doing something with that, because I've thrown most of mine away.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:18.000
They didn't do actual Labo. It's like a concept that they made out of cardboard called Labo Fit Adventure.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Mike Choi is the guy's name, a hardware hacker. He built the Labo Fit Adventure cart kit.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:33.000
And what happens is that you use a Ring-Con, so the Ring Controller with Ring Fit, to steer and squeeze basically,

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:38.000
if you want to kind of go the right direction and I assume use the boost or items.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:46.000
But you also have to pedal a bike, and that's the part that's made out of cardboard, above a certain speed if you want to keep going.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:49.000
So you have to actually pedal to keep the cart moving.

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:58.000
It's built around a tap-bow robot that will press Joy-Con buttons when you get signals from the Ring-Con and the bike.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:03.000
Other games technically will work, but it's really built with Mario Kart in mind.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:07.000
There's a whole to-do on the YouTube channel about that.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:15.000
And you know what? I'd love to see Nintendo take this concept into an actual Mario Kart game.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Obviously you have to make some concessions for this particular one to work, but as a proof of concept,

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:26.000
I know a lot of people are responding very positively to Ring Fit Adventure during this quarantine.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:30.000
I could stand to play a little more of it myself, to be quite honest.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:37.000
But I think these ideas, especially with those bikes, the Peloton, those bikes are getting more and more popular.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Like, this is a great thing for Nintendo to try to capitalize on, honestly.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
Even if it's made out of cardboard, why not?

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:49.000
They could do it cheaper than a Peloton, so I think Nintendo should get on it.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:52.000
I think this guy's doing him a favor. We'll see if they really do or not.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:57.000
So, all right. Moving on, Darsagra.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:02.000
So Microsoft filed a very interesting patent, kind of scary.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:10.000
They filed a patent that would let the company digitally revived deceased family and friends

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:15.000
using that individual's personal information.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:22.000
So it would create an AI-based chatbot that would be built on that profile that uses their image, their voice data,

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:29.000
social media posts, electronic messages, and other personal information to try to recreate that person

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:35.000
as a rudimentary, not really rudimentary, but sort of like an AI of sorts.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:45.000
And they even went further saying, use a 2D or 3D model of that person, but that's scary.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Yeah.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:50.000
I've never watched Black Mirror, but yeah, it sounds like that episode.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:53.000
That's what Orangewright says in chat. Isn't this a Black Mirror episode?

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
And Pod Culture says, that is fucking scary.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Well, yes. I don't think I'm in a hurry to talk to any of my family members in the virtual way.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:04.000
You know, once in a while, not to get like too depressing, but I'm just going to be honest,

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:07.000
like once in a while, I like to go to my mom's Facebook page.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:13.000
It's a nice little place in the internet where she posted some things and she has some pictures.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:19.000
So when I want to remember, as much as I loathe Facebook, it is a nice thing for me to go back and look at.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Grandmoms.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
What's that?

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:23.000
I go to my grandmoms.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Yeah, but I don't want the page to suddenly start posting again like it is her.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:35.000
And that's essentially what this is. You know, in fact, actually, this led to an interesting thing.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:43.000
So my dad will sometimes get on my mom's old laptop, which she's been logged into Facebook for like five years.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Hopefully she didn't get logged out the other night like everyone else did apparently.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:49.000
I didn't get logged out, but apparently a ton of people got logged out of Facebook.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:55.000
But my dad and my dad has logged into her Facebook like within the past year.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:58.000
So she'll show online. But it's my dad.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:02.000
But even that you can imagine that makes some people go, what?

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Like, did the account get hacked? What's going on?

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:11.000
So anyway, yeah, I don't want this chat bot to exist for things like that.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:18.000
However, as much as people are sitting here going, this is creepy, this is wrong, this is yikes.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:22.000
What about Tupac performing in a hologram?

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Like, I realize that's a kind of a different example, but there does seem to be some sort of demand out there for getting closer to deceased people.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:37.000
I just think it's deceased people you don't actually know.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
And I think that's the key difference.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
None of you out there know Tupac.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:48.000
And insert any hologram performance here, because I think they've said they were going to do it for others, too.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:52.000
And of course, in the moment, I'm blanking, but they've talked like I think Michael Jackson might have been one of them at one point.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:56.000
They're talking about doing like a hologram thing for and so forth.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Gorillas.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:04.000
That's that's different, though, because I know it's different, but I'm saying that it's the same technology.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:09.000
Yes. But but gorillas is actually there behind the hologram actually playing.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
So it's very yes, it's very different, but you're right.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:15.000
That technology is what led to and Hatsune Miku, if you will.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:22.000
That technology is what led to like Tupac holograms and things like that.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
So.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:38.000
And and, you know, the one thing, though, that I didn't go in and say any more about this is that it would also it could be used as an educational tool for historical reenactment, I guess, of of a person from way back when.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Although that's also going to be kind of iffy.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:48.000
It depends on how recently deceased they are, I guess.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Like, what about for those who were before social media existed, where they don't have like such information on that, they only have, you know, like some sound recordings or some.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Like hearsay or things that people wrote, but not necessarily what you write always reflects your personality, not always.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Can they let some people I know talk to Jesus so Jesus can tell them, that's not what I meant.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:22.000
That's what I'd like to see.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Maybe next to do Santa Claus.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:33.000
Well, I they already have a tracker for where is Santa Claus in the world on Christmas Eve?

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:36.000
That's a NORAD thing from. Yeah.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:39.000
DJ Rama in chat says there's more to this.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Microsoft said this would be for dead historical people, too.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:45.000
And yeah, I can see where I think more people might be interested in that.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
What I just said. Yeah, it is. It is.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:50.000
But I just want to make sure all the comments are getting through.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:51.000
Well, I can't wait.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Like, hopefully it doesn't learn from the people at chats with because I can't wait for like, you know, Abraham Lincoln.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:01.000
They become all of a sudden horribly racist because of the Internet.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:05.000
Well, he actually kind of was.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:10.000
OK, insert non-racist person. Never learn anything about your heroes.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Tiger Con chat says, I think this might not go well for some people.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:20.000
Having somebody you know who passed away being brought back in this way has the potential to mess with you mentally as you could break down mentally at how much you miss that person.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Yeah, that part.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
This really isn't for everyone.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:36.000
I think if Microsoft focuses on the historical celebrity side of things, they might have something as interesting as reading your Zodiac in the morning.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:41.000
But that's really I hope something like this is for entertainment purposes only.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:47.000
And that is the end of it. It just seems like a weird thing to be messing with.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:54.000
So Zen Monkey in chat says, when I went to Disneyland, I thought those robot presidents were real people.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:58.000
Hey, they're convincing that Disney robot technology is pretty convincing.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Disneyland and World both have it, but Disneyland has that whole Lincoln that steps up and gets out of the chair and gives the speech.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:10.000
That shit looks real. That's real.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Well done. And they touch up those animatronics, though, like I think every couple of years.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:19.000
But honestly, it was just the best place to sit when it was so freaking hot outside.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:22.000
Yes. And Disney, no one goes in there.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Disney World has that ride where all the presidents are in it.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:30.000
And then I think Lincoln's at the end. But Disneyland doesn't do that.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:34.000
It's just like an auditorium. You go in and it's like all the presidents.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:37.000
Is it all the presidents in the Disneyland one? No, the hall or the hall.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:40.000
Thank you. Yeah, yeah.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:44.000
So and I think there might be some other people there with Lincoln, but it's not everybody.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:49.000
Like it doesn't go through the controversies of, boy, they made Trump look horrible in there.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:52.000
And it's like, well, you know, somebody had it out, I'm sure.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:59.000
Oh, Bobby says Disney World has the current president stand up and give the same speech.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:03.000
It's not Lincoln. It's whoever is currently the president.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:06.000
OK, that's the difference. At Land, it's just always Lincoln.

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:09.000
OK, I get it now. All right.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:16.000
One of these days I'll get to Disney World, but very clearly the plan to go this year to ride the new Tron ride is not happening.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:22.000
So it will be whenever I go. What? When you go, I go.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:27.000
It'll be whenever that Tron ride opens. I mean, I heard they stopped construction on it at some point.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:34.000
So, yikes. I, I swear to God, swear to God, if this whole covid thing fucks up that Tron ride for me, I'm going to be so mad.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:38.000
No, I doubt it. Yeah. All right.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:43.000
Bobby says, yay, fog trip, because when Rob goes, I go, oh, my impact.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:49.000
I feel so influential. Thank you. All right. It'll probably be coupled with Dragon Con one of these years.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Maybe not the same, but after like Soul or something.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:25:00.000
They get you I should get you in on the little cosplay group, though, that I'm doing for for Dragon Con, if it happens.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:05.000
Oh, we're all going and we're all going as a layer. Oh, that's cute. OK.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:10.000
Anyway, let's move on. What's next? Loki, I think you're up next. All right.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:14.000
So shocker people staying home.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:20.000
So they spend more on gaming in 2020, but apparently spending is up quite a bit.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:30.000
Almost 57 billion dollars. So fifty six point nine billion was spent on gaming in the year 2020.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:35.000
You can thank the pandemic. You can thank brand new consoles coming out.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:45.000
Apparently, the. Increase, of course, it was hardware increase was up by 35 percent over 2019.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:54.000
And apparently the U.S. gaming industry, which raked in that fifty six point nine billion,

02:25:54.000 --> 02:26:00.000
which was an increase of twenty seven percent overall over 2019 figures as well.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:07.000
So, yeah. Let's see. And the big games of the year.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:14.000
I don't think they really list anything on here. Of course, last year, Call of Duty, Modern Warfare, Black Ops,

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Cold War, still doing one of the top selling games of the month of December.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:30.000
Oh, yeah. So big no shock there, you know, expected considering that that was how it was trending all year long.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:35.000
I'm curious to see how 2021 works out, considering that I think things are going to stay about the same,

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:42.000
maybe getting better towards the end of the year. I doubt that we're going to see much difference in those numbers being high.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Yeah, it also kind of depends like what they're able to get out, because, you know, they got those big consoles at the end of last year.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:55.000
If there's a new switch, if that actually ends up being a thing, then I think we could look at, you know, we're still going to have some big numbers.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:00.000
But otherwise, we are kind of waiting for the end of the year for the big titles to go with the new consoles.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:08.000
We're waiting for the Halo for Xbox X. We're waiting for the Horizon Forbidden West for PlayStation five, which is the assumed big title this holiday.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:15.000
So I you know, that's kind of the big thing. And then if Nintendo puts a new console out on top of that, that'll be a pretty big deal, too.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:20.000
I'm not sure the pandemic changes much of that. I think that stuff's all going to be in demand.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:26.000
And as I think it's been said before many times, the pandemic is probably not going to be something like a switch.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:29.000
It's not just going to be up tomorrow. Everything's back.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:34.000
It's going to be a lot more gradual than that, I think, as more and more people get vaccinated and so forth.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:41.000
It's just unfortunate that some of these things like Disney World and conventions are Disney World, the old way,

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:50.000
and convention will be the last in sporting events and major arenas full of people will be the last things to come back.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:59.000
But, you know, I think we'll be at restaurants again and can feel relative safety about it, especially if you've been vaccinated by summer, I would hope.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:07.000
But it just depends on how fast they get those vaccines moving. So anyway, Bobby says in chat, my mom got her first poke on the 20th.

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Truly, I'm happy. I'm frustrated because my dad is in his 80s and still hasn't had it done.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:19.000
And he's trying, but it's just part of the problems California is having in general.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:26.000
So the fact that they opened it up to 65 and older just makes it even harder for my dad, who would have qualified under 75 and over.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:33.000
However, I am trying to be, you know, non selfish and realize, you know, a lot of people over 65 are at risk.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:37.000
So I just hope they get them out fast, faster, faster, faster.

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:43.000
But I feel I feel better about it since Wednesday than I have in a long time.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:51.000
I don't know about some of you, but I feel I feel a lot better. So I'm not trying to get political, but sometimes I can't help it.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:56.000
All right. Moving on.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:59.000
Now, one more story for you guys, and this has to do.

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:05.000
Oh, I'm really excited about this because this is an old title coming back for the Nintendo Switch.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:17.000
And this is a good one. A recent rating from the South Korean ratings board indicates that SNK versus Capcom match of the Millennium is on its way to the Nintendo Switch.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:21.000
This was originally a Neo Geo pocket color game in 1999.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:26.000
But of course, it's, you know, the start of a series that eventually brought us.

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:29.000
I mean, Capcom SNK was different because it was the other company.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:37.000
But I just I feel like maybe this will be the first little first little snowball in the avalanche that gets us one of my favorite fighting.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
Probably still my favorite fighting game of all time.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:43.000
Capcom versus SNK, too. But hey, I will take this.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:46.000
I would actually pick this up. SNK versus Capcom.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:50.000
It's been rated by the South Korean ratings board, so it seems like this is certainly incoming.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:54.000
So I love this first comment on this news post.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:57.000
Now we need the best one ever. Capcom versus SNK, too.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:00.000
Comments. Comments are good tonight. What is it? What is it?

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:04.000
No, no, no, no. I need Tatsunoko versus Capcom.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
That's pretty good.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:09.000
You know, they always rumored a sequel and then it never happened.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:13.000
Well, they also said that it was also rumored to be coming out for Switch and that didn't happen.

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:16.000
So, yeah, true.

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
Yes, I agree. Why not both?

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Yeah, why not? Why not? Why not all of the above?

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
All of the above. Correct answer.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:31.000
All right, let's go into the listener roundtable where we take your comments in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:34.000
If you have any questions for us or comments, we'll get to those.

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
We also like to get to our emails.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:39.000
Participate at orangelandrado.com if you want to send us an email.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
I don't know if I saw anything in there.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:48.000
However, Darsagra, if that spam email is still in there, you really you really should read it.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Just redact anything that's identified there.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
Yes, it's fucking funny.

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:57.000
Well, we did get a real email, so I'll read the spam first.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:02.000
OK, read the spam first, because this you all probably saw it on Twitter.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:05.000
But for those that didn't, I'm sorry, this is fucking funny.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:06.000
So please.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:12.000
I'm waiting for it to load because the mailbox is doing that thing where it wants to take five years to load any of the emails.

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:13.000
Oh, no.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Yeah, it's just it's just so ridiculous.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Like, it'll sometimes be just fine and sometimes it'll be like, oh, I'm going to take forever.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Let me get some other comments in chat while we're waiting.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:29.000
Digirama S in chat says we need Namco cross Capcom while we're at it.

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:34.000
Didn't that end up being a tactical thing or am I getting my wrong cross on?

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:37.000
I thought there was a Namco tactical game that was anyway.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
They have they have a capcom.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:40.000
I remember I told you.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
Exxon Crossone.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:43.000
Oh, yeah, that was a project cross on.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:45.000
S.J. one hundred.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:51.000
Matt wants to know what's the status on Jamie getting that arcade one up machine with Strider, who, by the way,

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:56.000
I tweeted that clip of Jamie's God dammit moment from the last episode, which is a great clip.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:32:02.000
You can check it out. Twitter dot com slash O.L.R. Arcade one up liked the tweet.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:03.000
I'm sorry.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
That made me fucking laugh for like five minutes.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:10.000
And I had to text message Jamie like, guess who saw your God dammit?

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:14.000
And and I had to use it to ask for a Polestar and Blazing Star.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:17.000
I know. Of course you did.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:21.000
So it so the email finally loaded.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:28.000
I just found your podcast, Orange Lounge Radio, and wanted to reach out to say welcome to the podcasting world.

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:35.000
I've been a podcast host for years and wanted to do five things I wish I knew when I started podcasting.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:41.000
These five things will help you avoid some mistakes I made and hopefully help you succeed much faster than I did.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:44.000
Feel free to respond if there's anything I can do to help you out.

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:48.000
Have a great day. My reply. Fuck you.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
You can reply to it.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:53.000
You can. I'm sorry, but we've been doing this for 19 years.

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
Then they'll know we read it.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Yeah, my reply.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:00.000
Red receipts come anyway, Rob.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:04.000
Not if you disacknowledged them. But anyway, look, here's the thing.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
It was fucking funny.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:09.000
I look I'm making fun of this.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
I mean, I don't want to because I want to walk a fine line here.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:16.000
I don't want to sound like egotistical or know it all just because we've been doing it so long.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
But I am going to say the right.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:19.000
Yeah, a little bit.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:29.000
But I am going to say what I'm making fun of here is the audacity of this spammer to not even do some basic research to figure out who they were emailing to be like, oh, I've been a podcast host for years.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:35.000
Welcome to podcasting, bitch.

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:40.000
We were here before podcasting was even on iTunes when it was still when it was still lemon Potter.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:43.000
OK, so how long have you been?

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:47.000
OK, so, yes, I'm going to play that card with a spammer, with a real person.

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:52.000
I'm not going to do that, but I thought this might beg a fun question.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:34:01.000
And because we give the information for free and not making you click to our website full of which I'm sure I didn't click because I didn't want him seeing that I read it.

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:06.000
But I'm sure it's full of spam and, you know, banner ads and bullshit.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Since we have been doing it as long as we have.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:11.000
What are your five tips?

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:18.000
I should say our because I don't expect all one of us can come up with what are our five things we wish we knew when we started.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:27.000
So I so I'm going to one up the spammer is what I'm doing by giving away the information right now from somebody who has the receipts that we've been doing this for 19 years.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:34.000
What are the five things you wish you knew when you started podcasting?

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:39.000
And how to make money doing it.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:44.000
Still, still wait figuring that one out.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:48.000
I'll say one. Don't be afraid of change.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:35:05.000
Because change is going to happen, especially when you're talking about technology, which podcasting is a technology that technology is going to change and sometimes you have to be willing to ride with those changes and that is a call that I have not always gotten right here on

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
OLR. And I've been very open about this.

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:14.000
We should have moved to Twitch sooner than we did a lot sooner than we did in the interest of fairness.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:23.000
We did. You may forget or you may not know we we tried the Justin TV thing back in like 2010 2011 and we didn't go back.

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
And in retrospect, we should.

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:30.000
And we did that because we changed studios and we didn't think we in retrospect, that was a bad call.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:37.000
We should have kept going with the video and eventually, you know, the rest of the Internet would catch up with us.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:41.000
But I think we should have made the move to Twitch a lot sooner for what we do.

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:45.000
And of course, Twitch doesn't work for every podcast, but for what we do, it does.

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:54.000
So that would be my general advice is don't be afraid of change and making changes to your show to suit what is going on in the world.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
So that's another one.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
Some some comments in chat.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:03.000
Bobby says you make an NES game and sell it to your audience. That's how you make money.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:09.000
Yeah. Branded branded Vogue Network dot com slash shop branded items.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:14.000
It helps. Bobby also says most people don't make money from the podcast itself.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:19.000
They make money from other ventures that are related to the podcast and are marketed to the podcast audience.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:22.000
Yes. Or sponsorships. Yes.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:30.000
Now, I'm going to say I'm going to steal this one from Akdeft just in the way I'm sure this guy's five things list was just copy pasted from somewhere else.

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:33.000
I'm going to copy paste what Akdeft says because I agree with it.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:37.000
Don't be discouraged of having a small audience. Bingo.

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:40.000
That is absolutely one of the five things you need to know.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Some there is going to be some weeks where one person listens.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:48.000
But you know what? One person listened to what you have to say.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:54.000
And if you are doing it to have thousands of listeners or if you're doing it to make money out the gate,

02:36:54.000 --> 02:37:02.000
I'm here to tell you you're podcasting for the wrong reason and you might want to get out celebrity.

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:06.000
And this is why I'm not always a fan of celebrities getting into podcasting.

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Some of them do it right. Some of them don't do it right.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:14.000
The ones that are motivated by money are not doing it right. And we all know that.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:19.000
And they don't stick around. So anyway, I'm motivated by spite.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Jamie, I want to make sure you get a tip in here. So I think we're up to three. What's one of your tips?

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:31.000
Learn to grow some thick skin. And I hate that it's necessary.

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:45.000
But I've gotten some things that went from laughably misogynist to grossly threatening.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:53.000
You know, and all because I am a female presenting person who has very strong opinions

02:37:53.000 --> 02:38:01.000
and will say them on the Internet in a community that is typically male dominated,

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:07.000
even though we are 50 percent like almost to the number of gamers in the world.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:11.000
And I could probably school some of these little children.

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:19.000
So it's. You get the biggest thing to remember is that.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:23.000
These people don't actually know you, they know a version of you that you project,

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:30.000
and some people are fortunate enough, I would say, to get to know the real person behind the podcast.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:36.000
You know, and we all do it. I mean, I think to an extent, while we try to be genuine,

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:44.000
there's still this sort of. Persona, I guess, that we evoke when we're when we're podcasting,

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:52.000
you know, whether it's voice projection or trying to stay, you know.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:58.000
I'm trying to try to think of like trying to keep our demeanor a certain way.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:02.000
I mean, I certainly am a lot more ranty on this show, I think. I don't know.

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:13.000
I'm pretty ranty anyway, but I will, I think, say things that maybe be a little bit less tactful on the show for the sake

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:18.000
of getting an idea of cross, you know, it's it's.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:24.000
Would this be a conversation that I would have with just I mean, a lot of us, we have had these conversations,

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:29.000
so that that part's legit, and I really think that I try to be as real as possible,

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:35.000
but there are some things, a part of a persona that you still have to project to protect the private self that you are.

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:38.000
Right. Does that make sense? Oh, absolutely.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:43.000
Like when I like when I go out as a sister, I've got my my face on.

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:50.000
I have my habit on. I have my veil, you know, dressed cute in a really freaking weird way.

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:56.000
But that persona, it's still me.

02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:02.000
I still care about the people I work with, but it's going to be a more boisterous, outgoing version of myself.

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:07.000
Same with doing the show when I'm in person with people.

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:11.000
I think I go through my quiet periods where it's just a little bit too much.

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:19.000
You know what I mean? Well, you know this because you know me and a lot of you guys on here have have talked to me on Twitter and everything.

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:27.000
But I think that there needs to be a part of yourself that you're always going to keep private and not publish as much.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:36.000
And so when you do that, you have to understand that some of the feedback that's coming back isn't on who you are at the core of your person.

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:48.000
But who the persona that you've projected is, who the people that others see is like that philosophy that there's there's like the three things that make you who you are.

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:52.000
One of them is how you see yourself. The other is how other people see you. And the truth is somewhere in between.

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:58.000
Yeah. And that goes back to the whole perception thing that I talked about. It doesn't matter what the facts are. It matters perception.

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:02.000
And that's true of a lot of things, a lot of things in this world.

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:13.000
Well, and of course, the other thing, too, and they're saying a lot in in in chat here is that if you love doing podcasting, don't look at it as your job.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:24.000
Yeah. It's not you're not going to make money on this right away. Like, you know, my little well, I'm I've got my my blog that I'm putting together.

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:33.000
I actually put it on hold for very personal reasons. And I'm glad it's not my job or else I would be you know, I would be starving by now.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:44.000
But I've had health concerns come up, you know, and the big thing is that on the show, I think that we're we're very much don't let them see you sweat.

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:50.000
But let them hear you roar.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:58.000
I like that. And I just to go back to your main point, you know, where that all started about the whole like, you know, you have to have a thick skin to do this.

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:06.000
I do agree. I would say with that, though, like you're going to have to be aware there's always going to be haters and there's a couple of ways you can take that.

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:13.000
You can take it. I love this saying that Ronnie, my one of my friends gave me and he was on a reality TV show once he was portrayed as the villain.

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:17.000
He was not he did not get a very nice edit when the whole thing was said and done.

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:23.000
And he had plenty of share of his haters when it was done. And he gave me this quote that I've always held on to and I love it.

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:29.000
And the quote is, let haters be your motivators. And I think that's, you know, one way you can kind of do it.

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:41.000
But I told you I'm motivated by spite. Yeah, I know. But there is, you know, and as much as I love that quote, I will say I you and this is this is a very difficult skill.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:45.000
I refuse to respond to haters.

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:51.000
And it's easier said than done, because sometimes you want to go to these haters and you want to.

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:57.000
You've all seen that Jay and Silent Bob movie, right, where they they critique the movie online and Jay wants to go right.

02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:01.000
Fuck you, you fucking fuck. You are the ball lickers and that whole thing, right?

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:06.000
You are the ones who are the ball lickers. That was that was the whole thing, like responding to an angry thing.

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:16.000
And you want to do that. But I'm not going to waste time responding to haters because I got such more out of it.

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:24.000
That 15 minutes we spent earlier tonight talking about some of these issues that matter to us and you guys going, wow, I'm loving this.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:33.000
This is a teachable thing for me. Please go off. Pre go off, sis. Preach Ted Talk that that that is that is the reward I get for doing this show.

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:38.000
I don't get that if I spend 15 minutes telling a hater why they're an idiot.

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:42.000
OK, so as much as I understand, RuPaul says some stupid shit.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:51.000
Sometimes RuPaul got famous because either she or somebody is ghostwriting some amazing phrases for her and one of the best of all time.

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:55.000
And it is unless they're paying your bills, pay them bitches.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:44:02.000
No mind. And that that is it. You know, I completely understand if you have issues with RuPaul because she puts her foot in her mouth a lot.

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:06.000
But that one tracking you can you can take that to the bank and cash it.

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:10.000
That is a that is a very true to life quote. Absolutely.

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:13.000
What other people think of you is none of your business. Yes.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:18.000
So and that and that's my thing. I don't respond to haters. I'm not going to I'm not going to waste my time with you.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:22.000
Now, there's a difference between feedback and hate.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:27.000
But you'll notice when people come into our chat and unfortunately, because we are on Twitch, it does happen.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:34.000
You get people that come into chat and word and word, F word, fancy ass guy word, if you know what I mean.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:38.000
You know, those types of words we don't tolerate. It's the policy of the moderator team.

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Take out the trash immediately. And that's what they do. And you know what?

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:46.000
What we do here on air? We don't we don't say a goddamn thing about it.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:52.000
That's why I love the moderator teams. They're there to take out the trash before it starts to smell.

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:58.000
Now, I do like I do like a little bit of trolling sometimes, a little bit of trolling. Mostly I save it for my own my own Twitter.

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:03.000
Yes. On your own time. Yes, you do. Yes.

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:09.000
But I don't do anything of the sort like on the the feedback places.

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:16.000
None of that. I'll give people like a little bit of shit, you know, like if it's, you know, good natured ribbing, there's a different story.

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:22.000
But I mean, I don't have time for any of that. Their opinion means nothing to me.

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:25.000
Yeah, they don't know who I am. They don't know who any of us really are.

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:28.000
They haven't been with us through the whole ride. Yeah.

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:35.000
You know, if they were if they've been with us from the beginning and suddenly just like, OK, I'm completely done.

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:39.000
I'm fed up. I don't like who you are anymore. You know.

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:45.000
Honestly, I kind of still if it was like a friend, I would be like, OK, well, why do you feel this way? What happened?

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:52.000
You know, but if it's just like some person who listened to an episode and then decided to take a shit all over the iTunes reviews.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:55.000
Yeah. I don't care. I really don't.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:46:00.000
And, you know, like like again, there's a difference between feedback and haters.

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:08.000
Like if somebody comes to me and says, Rob, last week's episode was really like it was not great to listen to because like Jamie's audio was really low compared to you.

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:12.000
And like something weird is going on there. What? No, I'm just I'm making something.

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:16.000
I'm going to go, oh, shit, was it? Oh, my gosh. OK, I need to look into that.

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:20.000
Sorry about that. Like, thanks for sticking with it, though. You know, and I like, OK, I need to listen to that.

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:23.000
Like, shit, something's wrong. So I'm going to see what's going on there.

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:31.000
But if somebody comes to me and says. Sends an anonymous email from an account going, you should fire Jamie because she's a bitch and no one likes her.

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:35.000
And this happened early on in the early years ago in the show. You know, the sandwich thing.

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:42.000
Yeah, whatever. She'd get back and sandwich me. I'm just going to be like, delete trash block because that's what it is.

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:49.000
It's trash. And so, you know, where trash goes, the trash bin.

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:52.000
And that's how I feel about it. And you wouldn't.

02:46:52.000 --> 02:47:03.000
Well, I'll tell you, it's actually pretty funny is was telling my mom whenever she would want to talk about the tyrant and I'd be like, oh, mom, how's everything in your food disposal going?

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:10.000
What's at the bottom of your trash can? Like, well, why are you asking that? Because I feel the same way when you bring that up to me.

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:15.000
But it's the same thing. It's it's so beneath any of us.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:19.000
They're trying to get a rise and they're just not important enough to get it anyway.

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:24.000
OK, that was four tips. But you know what? It was enough material to be like 20.

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:27.000
So there you go on the house. All right. Let's get to the other email, though.

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:33.000
I was too much time spent on a spam email, but it was too good. I had to I had to get that out. All right.

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:38.000
It was it was potential. It had potential. Evening, everyone.

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:45.000
I had planned to send a detailed email about my gaming predictions, but instead I have another question instead.

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:51.000
Ron Chan. Proofread.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:54.000
He tried it. He was trying to get in before the buzzer. Cut him some slack.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:59.000
What are your what are your favorite DDR beatmania pop music songs to play and listen to?

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:04.000
I recently realized that I haven't played any big money games because the pandemic and I actually miss it.

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:07.000
That's all. Keep it chill. Y'all run my heart.

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:14.000
I know what Facebook post inspired this because I almost replied to it. So thank you for sending it over here.

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:17.000
Can you say the actual question? What songs do you miss or what was your favorite?

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:22.000
I'm sorry. I miss favorites. Your favorite. Oh, Nick, please.

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:30.000
Not so quick from DDR third mix and just pretty much anything erotic in general because it was so stupid, fluffy, dumb.

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:33.000
And that's what DDR music should be. That's when it's great.

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:42.000
Like I just that was my favorite stuff was the just idiotic Europop songs that I adore to this day.

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:47.000
It was my favorite to play for a very long time, just because I like the song.

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:51.000
But I love the the the.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:56.000
Bass stuff, I can remember a DDR solo solo bass.

02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:06.000
Yeah, I like for Beatmania, I still kind of giggle it three to one stars.

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:10.000
I still like.

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:13.000
God, why can't I think of the song now?

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:16.000
I will just say quickly, sorry.

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:20.000
Busy. Beatmania 2D. Oh, Jack and Mark get busy.

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:23.000
I remembered Mark and then I was like, who's the other guy?

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:26.000
Beatmania 2DX, my favorites by far.

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:29.000
I always played as a warm up song, The Beauty of Silence.

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:32.000
I loved that song when there was an eighth style machine over skinny.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:36.000
But my favorite 2DX song of all time is Flotation by Vincent D'Amore.

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:39.000
I remember.

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:42.000
When I would play with Jessica.

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:47.000
And we would do all the Orange Lounge ones and try to perfect score them, remember?

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:52.000
Yeah, yeah. And we did three in a row, as I recall.

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:55.000
Good times. Yeah, that was always pretty fun.

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
But.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:04.000
I really am a big fan of of this style.

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
Just has some really good stuff.

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:09.000
And as for pop and music.

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:13.000
I always start with the same song every fucking time at the machine has it.

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
The gachamanota.

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:18.000
The theme to gachaman. And I sing with it and you have witnessed this.

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
Oh, yeah.

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:23.000
Da da da da da da da da da da.

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:27.000
Yeah, I know the fucking song at this point.

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:30.000
The first three lines are da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
Who is it? Who is it? Who is it?

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:35.000
All right, Loki, you got to answer this, too.

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:40.000
Let's see. So probably, you know, DDR, I was playing mostly extreme.

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:46.000
So I like DTR, Dance Dance Revolution.

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:50.000
Fantasy from Max 2.

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:53.000
Yeah, Max 2 Fantasy.

02:50:53.000 --> 02:51:00.000
When I got my machine with all the songs and then moving on from fifth mix.

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
Fifth mix was so underrated.

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:08.000
From Max, you know, been more back when we were playing fourth,

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:13.000
probably rock beat and dynamite rave and stomp to my beat.

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:16.000
And I don't know.

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:19.000
We used to play a lot of those fours and fives because that's back when we were like learning that stuff.

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:26.000
So any song from Ultra Mix 2, any song from Ultra Mix 2 when they did the different drum music.

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:30.000
Like that's how I discovered Echo Image was Skulk and just, oh, my God.

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:35.000
That was such a like those Xbox DDR games did not get the credit they deserved.

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:40.000
I can't believe that I left out like my favorite Bimani song of all time.

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:43.000
Brilliant to you. Orchestra groove. I knew it.

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:47.000
I was like, why didn't she say it to you? All right.

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:50.000
Second mix was so good and so underrated.

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:54.000
All right. Anyway, we could do a whole three hour show just on this discussion alone.

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:58.000
And we have. So but thank you for the email.

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:02.000
Appreciate that. And yeah, I appreciate the comment a minute ago.

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:03.000
I think it was as you wonder.

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:09.000
Matt said, y'all are stellar for turning a troll spam email into a heartfelt, awesome discussion.

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:14.000
Thank you. I, I felt there was a good discussion in that email.

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:17.000
That's why I insisted Jamie read it anyway.

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:20.000
And thanks to solo two thousand ninety drugs.

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:25.000
So. OK.

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:30.000
That OK. What, Loki? Only one person in chat is going to understand why that's funny.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:35.000
Loki just did a throwback to the very first news story we ever covered on our.

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:40.000
And that was that some. Girl, adult, I don't know,

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:48.000
some person, some individual was taking issue with some of the imagery and DDR solo saying it promoted drug use.

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:54.000
And so I think we spent three hours talking about all the drugs we've done because of DDR.

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:58.000
How about all the drugs I've done as a result of playing DDR?

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:05.000
All right. Painkillers, lidocaine patches, marijuana takes.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:11.000
Oh, no, I'm I'm old and broken enough for the prescriptions, Rob.

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:14.000
All right. I think we need to get to moving to wrapping things up here.

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:20.000
It's it's getting to be after nine o'clock here on the West Coast, so I know we got to wrap up the show.

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:27.000
But thank you so much for the emails. Please send us more. Participate at orange lounge radio dot com is the place to send us emails.

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:33.000
Let's quickly see if there's any last minute stories. Loki at our soccer. I'll check in with you guys.

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:39.000
Not really. There wasn't anything worth noting, I guess.

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:43.000
OK, sorry, I have a Mr. Smoosh in the studio and sadly he's on ground level.

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:50.000
I'm trying to get him up, but he's looking at the camera like I want to knock that over and I'm like, the fuck you will, buddy.

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:55.000
All right. Now he's now he's looking at his other dad in the kitchen prepping dinner.

02:53:55.000 --> 02:54:01.000
All right. Oh, Midna's on a diet. Oh, really? Midna gained a pound.

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:07.000
Oh, I know somebody else who's a pound overweight, but

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:14.000
she's supposed to be right around 12 and she's at 13 and she's going to be eight years old this year.

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:20.000
So she's kind of an old lady. So she's got to watch her waistline.

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:26.000
Well, we had to take our cat to the vet because she was all stuffed up and super congested.

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:30.000
And so they gave her medicine for that. But she's that's Mr. Smoosh every day.

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:35.000
And they're just like, that's just a cat. So I've been trying to get her fattened up.

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:39.000
Well, Midna, Midna actually has to take human allergy medicine.

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:44.000
I forgot what it's called, but it's I have to put a pill in her half a pill in her mouth every morning.

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:49.000
And she's like, OK, feed me. You must appease me, human.

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:54.000
All right. Our children, our fur babies, babies. All right. Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:59.000
The show's been running on a long time. We have a few people in chatter like I'm going to bed.

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:03.000
I'll check out the rest of the podcast. Let's wrap it up and get final thoughts.

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:07.000
Great episode, though, you guys. Thanks, as always, for being here and being a part of the show.

Super duper appreciate those and a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this podcast.

Spotify, whatever. Those all go a very long way. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:42.000

I'll acknowledge you guys after the show's done tonight. But thank you, everybody, on Twitch.

02:55:54.000 --> 02:56:00.000
You can also check out our shop over at VOG Network dot com slash shop where we have some oil, our branded merchandise and VOG Network merchandise.

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:04.000

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:08.000
We'll be adding to that throughout the year. OK, that's enough.

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:15.000
Let's get to our actual final thoughts. I will start tonight by saying, did you all notice that I'm wearing a pillow?

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:20.000
You guys, Loki and Jamie can't really see me, but the listeners can.

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:28.000
So I'm wearing a T-shirt that says Fever Time, so I'm throwing it back pre DDR tonight.

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:34.000
And I missed this game an awful lot. Bust a move or bust a groove, depending on where you played your games, where your games came from.

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:41.000
So I'm going to just give a shout out to that legendary series is my final thought.

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:47.000
Loki, I'll go to you. Your final thought. I forgot to mention this week when I was developing my game, I made a dog.

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:52.000
Well, we have dogs now that eat poop, so that's an accomplishment for this week.

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:57.000
Congratulations. Last but not least, Star Soccer, your final thought.

02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:03.000
So I found the story when we posted after Shermy died.

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:12.000
Because we were talking about how old Midna is and Shermy died October 2012.

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:18.000
Oh, wow. So in Midna, I got her right after that.

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:25.000
Yeah, so 2013. So, yeah, she's she was nine months old when I got her.

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:28.000
She turned one around my birthday and she's going to be a nine year old.

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:32.000
Ron and I were talking about it. Time flies.

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:35.000
She used to sit on our feet. Mm hmm.

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:40.000
I'll never forget when we were talking about the tester, that Sony reality show,

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:45.000
