1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,680
And it looks really interesting, stay tuned to hear details about that.

2
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,080
But after the show, if you're wanting a more fast-paced, arcade-style baseball game

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,520
that does exist, look for a means of playing Super Baseball 2020 or Baseball Stars 2.

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,280
Those have been my favorites for decades.

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,840
This is one story you'll hear tonight.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,800
This and plenty more is coming from your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki right

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,840
now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:45,280
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,200
where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:55,960
It is Orange Lounge Radio Live once again, back in the house, episode number 854 for

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,960
this January the 31st of 2021, the last day of January.

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,200
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you from our studio in Sacramento, California, sadly still

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,680
socially distancing because it's still March 2020 for a lot of us.

14
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,320
And joining me via the magic of Discord, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,320
What's up?

16
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,320
Hi, how are you?

17
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,200
I'm all right.

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Nice wig.

19
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,920
Thank you.

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,760
It's a lace front, Rob.

21
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
Lace.

22
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
Real lace.

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,600
Unfortunately, the podcast folks can't see that sometimes you decide to dress up a little

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,960
bit for the show, which, you know, it's all there you go.

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,960
There you go.

26
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,960
Yes.

27
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,960
Yes.

28
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
Make love to the camera.

29
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,960
Okay.

30
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
Perfect.

31
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,840
I decided that I had been feeling kind of crappy all day, so I was gonna glam up just

32
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,840
a little bit.

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:55,360
So I am wearing the lovely eyeshadow palette by our local queen, Sasha Devereaux, who is

34
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
talented and amazing.

35
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
Look her up.

36
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
She's she's awesome.

37
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,080
And her palette is really good.

38
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,480
I'm not being paid to say this.

39
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,880
And I said once we can get back together in person at some point, I said maybe we could

40
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,960
do like a charity fundraiser for something where if we make like, I don't know, a hundred

41
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,680
bucks, 200 bucks, we'll figure out something fair.

42
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,680
I said the DarkSakura could do my makeup for a show.

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,640
So you're gonna be a bearded queen.

44
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,640
So look forward.

45
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,640
Please look forward to that.

46
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,800
Once COVID is over, that'll be our official COVID is over party.

47
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
All right.

48
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Right.

49
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,200
Anyway, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

50
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,320
Hey, how's it going?

51
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,320
Hey, good, Loki.

52
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,320
How are you doing?

53
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,320
Doing pretty good.

54
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
Yeah.

55
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,320
Busy.

56
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,320
Yeah.

57
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,320
Yeah.

58
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,320
I can't tell.

59
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
What is that game playing behind you tonight?

60
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,320
I can't read the dialogue from here.

61
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
I can't see.

62
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,640
Well, it just relates to this week.

63
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,640
Okay.

64
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,520
It is the indie RPG game called To the Moon.

65
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
Oh.

66
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,400
I love that game.

67
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Yeah.

68
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
That is such a sweet game.

69
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Okay.

70
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
I see what you...

71
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Okay.

72
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,400
To the Moon.

73
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
I see what you did there.

74
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
Okay.

75
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
Okay.

76
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
It took me a minute.

77
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
Yeah.

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
No, but that is, it is a good game for an entirely different reason than what you're

79
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,720
referring to here.

80
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,240
But all right, Loki, if you're going to open that can of worms, why don't we get into our

81
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,760
kickoff topic right off the bat and talk about what's going on, which, okay, I'm gonna be

82
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,240
fair because it's funny because Bobby kind of addressed this on his show too, because

83
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,600
we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the

84
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,320
Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, V-O-G Network, right after the Bobby

85
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Black Wolf show.

86
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,600
And if you are live with us on Sunday night, stop by our chat room because we do like to

87
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,520
read comments from chat.

88
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,120
So we're on right after the Bobby Black Wolf show and Bobby on his show was kind of like,

89
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,140
I'm not really going to talk about it because it's not really gaming news and actually do

90
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,800
kind of agree to an extent.

91
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,280
Like this story has now far eclipsed what is just gaming news.

92
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,520
However, the reason why I think it still qualifies for discussion here and merits discussion

93
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:00,360
is because I think there's definitely an element of gaming culture that went into this and

94
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,680
why people felt the need to save this particular stock.

95
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,480
But I'll let Loki take it from here, even though it is a follow up to last week, kind

96
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,280
of, but it just, it went to the moon this week.

97
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:21,900
Yeah, so basically what's happening is there is these hedge funds that have shorted GameStop

98
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,900
stock.

99
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:28,380
So what shorting means is basically in traditional stocks, when you go long, it means you're

100
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,080
betting on stock is going to raise in price.

101
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,280
So you buy low and you sell high.

102
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,240
Well, short is basically the opposite.

103
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,920
So you buy, you borrow a stock from somebody, you sell it immediately in the hopes that

104
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:48,560
it goes down and then you buy it again low and return the stock that you borrowed.

105
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,680
And then you make the money based off the amount that the stock dropped.

106
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:59,360
Well, what happened was is that these hedge funds did what's almost called like a naked

107
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,760
short where they overshorted the stock 140%.

108
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,800
Now you're wondering how the hell do you sell more stocks than exist?

109
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:16,320
It's because that they're basically, you know, hedge fund A, you know, has a stock and hedge

110
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,400
fund B borrows that stock and then immediately sells it to hedge fund C, which then borrows,

111
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,120
you know, hedge fund D borrows it from C, you know, it's so keeps going.

112
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,120
So you end up getting these multiples and what they do that for is to drop the value

113
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
of the stock.

114
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,840
So they will buy up a lot of these, they'll short them and you to a great extent to drop

115
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,240
the price of the stock down to make money and then sell it once it goes low.

116
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,000
I did address this a little bit last week using turnips as an example, just as a reminder,

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,760
because this is where we all learned about the stonks this year.

118
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,560
Actually, I learned about it in high school.

119
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
Well, okay.

120
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
We played the stock market.

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,160
But did you, did you actually, and I think a lot of economics classes probably did the

122
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,760
fake stock market, but I don't know a lot of people who have put their own money in

123
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
the stock market.

124
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,720
I'm talking outside of 401ks and things that kind of like retirement plans do free do for

125
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,720
you.

126
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
I've invested.

127
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
Yeah.

128
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
Yeah.

129
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
Yeah.

130
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,320
I invested in the place in which I work.

131
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Okay.

132
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:27,520
Well, there's a lot of, there's a lot of people who have not had any experience with any of

133
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,520
that until like animal crossing.

134
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,680
I think really like kind of started getting people like, oh, you know, and I think everybody

135
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,000
kind of knew like, oh, it's a cute little play on the stock market.

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What's happening there.

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,920
But you know, then this started happening.

138
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,360
And now that everybody is having to like, okay, somebody, why the fuck do I keep hearing

139
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,960
about GameStop in the news?

140
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,260
What the hell is going on?

141
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:56,320
So many people have had to like, and I'm going to use this term, dumb it down.

142
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,040
And believe me, there's a lot in my life.

143
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,960
I've needed to make it accessible, dumb down.

144
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
Okay, sure.

145
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
Make it accessible.

146
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
Explain it to me.

147
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
Like I'm five.

148
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
That whole thing.

149
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Right.

150
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,960
So there's been so many people having to explain this, what's going on to people.

151
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,960
Yeah.

152
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,960
So basically what's happening now is so like you would rent a game from blockbuster back

153
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,240
in the day.

154
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,160
Eventually that game is due back.

155
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:27,360
And so what happens is, is if, for example, you have a community like wall street bets

156
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,360
that sees, Hey, look at this stock is short at 140%.

157
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,920
They're going to have to buy that one, you know, eventually to recoup those socks to

158
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,480
return them.

159
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,080
We're just going to purchase a bunch of these stocks and drive the price high.

160
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,960
So what that does is because they're shorting it and the only way they make money is if

161
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,140
it drops in price, they could lose an infinite amount of money because they have to buy it

162
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,660
at some point.

163
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:57,040
And so what the goal is now is there's so many people buying the stock, it's driving

164
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,180
the price up much, much, much higher than they anticipated.

165
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:07,180
So these hedge funds are losing billions of dollars and everybody's making quite a bit

166
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:12,420
of money off of it because these shares, which were originally like, you know, four or $5

167
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,340
each are now $400, $500 each.

168
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,100
And so, I mean, that's a quite, quite the return on investment.

169
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,100
And so what happened, what's happening now though, is because there's no shares to really

170
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,100
buy back.

171
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,780
And even when they do buy it back, I think it's going to drive the price up a little

172
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,740
bit is they have, it's called a short squeeze.

173
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,460
And so really it's just going to skyrocket the stock.

174
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,660
That's why everybody's holding it.

175
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,740
They're not selling their positions.

176
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,440
And so it's just going to keep driving the price up and up and up and up.

177
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,460
And so this week you saw a lot of bullshit with like Robinhood preventing people from

178
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,600
actually buying stock.

179
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,600
There was, you know, they were only allowing you to sell it.

180
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:59,080
They were different brokers that were basically limiting the amount of trades you can do.

181
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:05,280
And it was one of those rare things that like politicians on all sides of the spectrum agreed

182
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:11,640
on was that that, that move that Robinhood pulled was sus as hell basically.

183
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:17,680
And that led to a whole Twitch stream that AOC did, right, Monday night or something

184
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,960
where she was, and I don't even think she was playing a game.

185
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
I missed it.

186
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,900
Sorry, I had a conflict, but I don't even think she was playing a game this time.

187
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,520
I think she went on, she just did like a talking, she had guests and things like that.

188
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,480
But she just kind of had a talk about it, which was interesting.

189
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:37,000
And then of course, I'm sure you all saw, you know, Ted Cruz tried to agree with her

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,920
and then in response AOC definitely like snatched his fucking wig and threw it in the garbage.

191
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,760
But I think he kind of deserved it.

192
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,240
But anyway, I won't go there.

193
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,880
But still, you had people on both sides that were both saying, you know, Robinhood, what

194
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,960
they did was sus.

195
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,240
And there's all sorts of market manipulation going on.

196
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,600
You know, obviously, there's different CNBC has been, you know, accusing the folks on

197
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,420
Wall Street bets of manipulating the market, not even really calling out the hedge funds

198
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,800
that are over shorting it.

199
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,440
And then on top of that, they've been, you know, conveying fake information.

200
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,840
So they've been saying that these hedge funds have already settled their shares, which you

201
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,920
can look at the data and see, no, that's not the case.

202
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,300
So they're trying to put it out there that, oh, yeah, yeah, they've already bought their

203
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,300
shares back.

204
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,300
You guys won.

205
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,160
You can sell your stock now trying to drive the price down.

206
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,800
But it's so manipulative.

207
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,440
It does make you think and, you know, I'm kind of watching chat and I want to get to

208
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
some of that stuff in chat.

209
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,400
But I got two things I want to address here real quick.

210
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,120
And then, Loki, if you have anything else you want to add.

211
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,400
The first thing I want to address is, well, how is this still relevant to gaming?

212
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,800
You know that you're a video game podcast, Orange Launch Radio.

213
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,200
Why are you still talking about this?

214
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,880
Because this is just this just tangentially involves GameStop at this point.

215
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,880
And I would argue, I think it was gaming culture that actually played into this whole thing

216
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,800
and allowed it to happen because, like you said, there was this Reddit community that

217
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,200
observed that there was this trend that was happening on Wall Street of this stock shorting.

218
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,120
And, you know, the rumor came through or the buzz or the tip that some of the hedge funds

219
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,800
were going to be doing this with GameStop stock.

220
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:22,920
I almost want to say stonk instinctively now, but GameStop stonk, stock, God.

221
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,200
They were going to be doing it with that.

222
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,560
And that was the point where there were several people on Reddit and it was that, you know,

223
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,800
kind of pebble that started the avalanche that said, no, you're not going to do this

224
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,280
to my company, my childhood.

225
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,960
You know, for better or for worse, when it comes to GameStop.

226
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,440
I've certainly had my fair share of criticism about them in the past.

227
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,040
They've done a lot of weird shit, you know, over the years.

228
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,320
But I can also recognize, you know, they have really been kind of stepping on it in the

229
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,160
past year to really try to turn shit around.

230
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,000
Hence the Reggie Fils-Aime on the board story we had not that long ago.

231
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,240
And then we had this guy from Chewy, right?

232
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,720
He was like the CEO or something.

233
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,960
I'm sorry, I might be misstating positions, but he and that was that was the big story.

234
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,680
He put his own money into it.

235
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,120
And that was the thing that Reddit kind of tailgated with.

236
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
Right.

237
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,440
So why they're going to make reasons why they believe in the stock.

238
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,920
It's not just, oh, it's because it's over shorted.

239
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,160
They don't really like the company.

240
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:24,600
It's that they they legitimately think that, you know, it's a decent stock and that's undervalued.

241
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,120
And so that's why they were investing in it.

242
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,120
And a lot of these folks, you know, like, for example, the guy that kind of led the

243
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:38,640
charge, I guess, who goes by the username Deep Fucking Value, he he actually invested

244
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,640
back in 2019.

245
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,520
He's actually been talking about it for, you know, a while now.

246
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,560
So this isn't like a brand new thing.

247
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,320
Oh, so the best story I've seen on this whole thing, the best is that there was this kid

248
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,440
like seven or eight years old, maybe 10.

249
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,200
So I don't remember the age, but I remember reading he got as a Kwanzaa gift.

250
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:05,160
His aunt bought him 10 shares of GameStop stock like a year or two ago when he graduated

251
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,480
elementary school or something, I don't know, some type of like, you know, and it was a

252
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,320
cute thing, because, you know, because GameStop stock back then was like five, six bucks.

253
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
Right.

254
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,920
My grandma always got me a savings bond every Christmas, every birthday.

255
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
Right.

256
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,660
That was her little like, I'm going to teach you about investment.

257
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:25,240
But for this family, the the answer, whoever it was, I'm sorry, I don't have the article

258
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,200
in front of me, bought 10 shares of GameStop stock, which at the time was not worth that

259
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
much.

260
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,240
It was six dollars a share, maybe.

261
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,600
So the kid gets like and the kid gets informational pamphlets about GameStop and all this stuff.

262
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,440
And now it was just in the news when GameStop hit like three hundred fifty dollars this

263
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,620
week or whatever it was, they were like, OK, maybe, you know, they let the kid decide,

264
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,860
but the kid decided to sell.

265
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,520
And, you know, that's great news.

266
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,800
You love to see a 10 year old make three thousand dollars and learn about the stock market in

267
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
the process.

268
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,880
And the cool thing was they took two thousand to do something about like paying for school

269
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
and some of that.

270
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,120
But they're going to take the other thousand and reinvest as a family.

271
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,680
And I thought that was a neat little like family learns how to play the stock market

272
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,680
type of story.

273
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,680
It was really touching.

274
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,680
I think.

275
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,680
Yeah.

276
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,600
And there's been a lot of these like kind of different people investing in it as well

277
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,800
and taking the money that they've made from that and, you know, paying for consoles for

278
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:27,080
hospitals and buying stuff for first responders and stuff like that.

279
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:32,080
So, you know, and stories of people being able to raise enough money to pay for surgeries

280
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,300
and health care, whatever the case may be, paying off their student loans, buying a house,

281
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,320
you know, just, you know, stuff that is like night and day for them.

282
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,880
It's changed their life.

283
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,700
So it's pretty incredible.

284
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:51,320
This isn't the only stock to the AMC was another one that they've been doing with Blackberry

285
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
on.

286
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,840
I don't remember the other one.

287
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,840
Nokia was another one.

288
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,140
I think Nokia.

289
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,440
So there's been several that they've been doing this with.

290
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,880
And it's just it's kind of ironic, though, that you see these billionaires now, you know,

291
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,040
complaining, oh, you guys are manipulating the market.

292
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,000
It's like they were doing the same thing.

293
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,360
There's like some some old video clips online of whether the guy that's behind that show

294
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,300
Mad Money or whatever, talking about how he he used to be with a hedge fund and how the

295
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:27,020
manipulated stock prices and stuff by like literally passing off fake news to like different

296
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,620
outlets and stuff to get people scared.

297
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,620
Can we talk about that?

298
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,380
Because this is where the chat is going, because another thing that really pushed this GameStop

299
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:40,020
stock thing that really kind of pushed it forward was, you know, whether you love the

300
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,140
guy or hate the guy, Elon Musk tweeted about it.

301
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,540
And he's got a lot of followers.

302
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,660
He has a lot of influence, especially when it comes to finances.

303
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,260
And he's tweeted about this multiple times.

304
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,300
And he tweeted about the Dogecoin thing, which is a whole other that really is outside of

305
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,300
gaming news.

306
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,540
But it's it's kind of like that whole Dogecoin thing.

307
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,140
The most I'll say about that is that it is showing that this GameStop thing is not the

308
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,660
end of it.

309
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,980
This is going to be something that continues.

310
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,980
How long it continues?

311
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,980
I don't know.

312
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,020
But anyway, my point is and the reason why Elon Musk, assumably, maybe gets involved

313
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,020
in this whole thing.

314
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,300
What does he give a shit about GameStop about all this, besides maybe that he's invested

315
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,300
his own money?

316
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,340
Yeah.

317
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,260
But do you know another very popular company with the short sellers that they love to short

318
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,660
sell the stock with?

319
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,300
It's Tesla.

320
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:33,180
So I'm sure Elon Musk is looking at these guys going, fuck those guys, because they

321
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,180
fuck with me.

322
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,420
And then we saw it in chat.

323
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,700
They're talking about, you know, Bobby, there's.

324
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,700
Go ahead.

325
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:44,220
Well, I'm just saying that this is a big show that basically this is all being manipulated

326
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,060
behind closed doors.

327
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,780
And people shouldn't, you know, go back, going back to another statement that the stock

328
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,940
market is not indicative of the economy, really.

329
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,940
Right.

330
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,900
But it makes you think, going back to the whole like fake story thing, you know, how

331
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:03,940
hard has they've tried to push that narrative about the Tesla autopilot is like a murderous

332
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,860
rampage car out of hell type of thing going on?

333
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,660
You know, I mean, sure.

334
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,880
It sounds like there's, you know, some issues, but I don't.

335
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,980
It's one of those things where it seems like this, you know, and again, it's Christine.

336
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,380
Where, you know, Bobby is actually shown the opposite to be true with his video over

337
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,380
the VOG Network, YouTube.

338
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,020
No, I think it might be on his personal YouTube, but whatever the wherever it is, it actually

339
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:31,100
shows like how autopilot actually saved him in an accident, you know.

340
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:37,940
So my point is it makes you stop and think all of these stories about the narrative behind

341
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,780
companies about Tesla.

342
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:48,980
And here's how this is gaming news, folks, are the negative stories behind GameStop fake?

343
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,680
That's what this is all leading to now.

344
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,660
You know, where there's where there's smoke, there's fire.

345
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,300
And y'all have set foot in a GameStop.

346
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:03,020
I would I wouldn't say it's all fake, but yeah, how much of it how much of it has maybe

347
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,380
been blown up a little bit.

348
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,380
It makes you wonder.

349
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:13,060
Well, the other thing, too, you have folks that are still like they're absolutely pissed

350
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:18,740
about, you know, the last economic crisis they were in from 2008 where the stock market

351
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:24,980
crashed and, you know, how the government bailed out these, you know, banks and everything

352
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,380
and how literally you have the people, you know, on Wall Street, these hedge fund folks,

353
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:34,180
you know, celebrating with champagne while the Occupy Wall Street folks were down below,

354
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,820
you know, protesting everything.

355
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,620
So now a lot of these people, it's like this is personal.

356
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,620
I'm buying the stock.

357
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,180
I don't care if it goes to zero, if it means that these hedge funds are going to lose millions

358
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,900
of dollars, it's worth the price of admission.

359
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,900
So a lot of these folks are just, you know, investing because of that.

360
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,460
They're like, I don't care if I lose, you know, what it really to them.

361
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,100
I mean, the amount that they're investing, there's a finite amount that you can lose

362
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,100
there.

363
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,020
It's, you know, whatever you invested in, whereas the shorts, there is no cap for that.

364
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,980
They can keep going.

365
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,020
So the longer they hold onto it, the more that they lose and the higher it goes.

366
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,020
Yeah.

367
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:15,180
Uh, anything you want to add to this, Jamie, what you, from what you're watching and seeing?

368
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,940
Not, not really.

369
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:22,380
I mean, there's, I'm still in kind of this wait and see mode right now, you know, just

370
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,460
because it is, I mean, we've been talking about this yet for two weeks, but it's still

371
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,500
in early stages.

372
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,940
I think, I think that there's going to be a lot that comes out of the woodwork and I

373
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,620
know a lot of, you know, the news that we consume is manipulated.

374
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:40,300
I mean, I always tell people that if you're going to look at one news source, look at

375
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:47,100
five others, including one that is, uh, an opposing source, you know, it's like, I tell

376
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,740
my mother, you know, okay, link me all this red new stuff, but I want you to also go and

377
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,180
read all this other stuff too.

378
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:58,100
You know, you have to be able to see the big picture and don't necessarily look to American

379
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,100
news sources.

380
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,100
Just saying.

381
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,100
Oh, sorry.

382
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,100
Go ahead.

383
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:09,300
Well, just, just that, um, the biggest thing about it is that go into this with your eyes

384
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,300
open.

385
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,220
Don't expect all of the truth to come out.

386
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,840
It's they're going to try, you know, things go really sour on this.

387
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:25,380
They're going to try to sweep it under, um, it's just another, another sign that the,

388
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:31,060
the stock market is inherently, uh, a corrupt establishment.

389
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,060
Hmm.

390
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,020
Um, I want to read some of these comments about the Tesla thing that Bobby is saying

391
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,020
in our chat.

392
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,260
Cause it is very interesting about, you know, uh, how much is the news, you know, altered

393
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,260
perhaps.

394
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,540
Um, Bobby is, he's saying a lot in chat.

395
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,980
I'm just going to read some of the comments.

396
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:50,500
Um, the video I made on YouTube actually got a lot of press with the shorts, mostly calling

397
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,220
me a dumb ass fan boy.

398
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,860
There were rebuttals on auto websites and calls for me to have my driver's license revoked.

399
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,500
It was wild.

400
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,540
And so, because Bobby was trying to say something good about, yeah, because Bobby was saying

401
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:08,980
something good about, but it also shows that just like that hyperactivity of the internet

402
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:14,020
in general, when it comes to everything, when it comes to politics, when it comes to gaming,

403
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:18,940
fuck, look at the replies to any Xbox or Sony post.

404
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:25,300
The first couple of replies are always like, fuck Xbox, Sony's better or fuck Sony, Microsoft's

405
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,300
better.

406
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,740
And like, shut up.

407
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,820
Like I, I can't believe I'm saying this because this is the show where every gamer has a voice,

408
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:39,060
but like gamers of a certain maturity level.

409
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:43,380
I think I'm getting to the point where it's like, I am not interested in hearing from

410
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,340
these people on Twitter because I don't think they're actually gamers, but that's a whole

411
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,820
nother, I guess, debate.

412
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,820
You know.

413
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:55,300
I still think that we have an unspoken caveat with every gamer.

414
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:00,900
I'd say there's definitely, we don't have room for hateful voices here.

415
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,900
Yes, absolutely.

416
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,900
Yeah.

417
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,940
There is a little bit of a caveat there and there always has been, and if you don't like

418
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,940
it, tough.

419
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,940
Get my ass.

420
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,420
Don't, you might have rabies.

421
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,660
Bobby continues, they're too busy bitching about games.

422
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,740
They have no time left to play games.

423
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,460
Fifth Dream says we're non-toxic gamers have a voice.

424
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,460
Yes.

425
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,460
There's that.

426
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,500
Questbuster says, I'm only surprised that what happened with GameStop didn't happen

427
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
sooner.

428
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,500
That is interesting that it kind of like took this long and I don't know if it's something

429
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,140
about the pandemic or if it's just something about, you know, again, people's childhood

430
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,560
and GameStop in particular or what it is, but I guess it was just this perfect storm

431
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,220
that allowed this to happen now.

432
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:43,100
I'm going to admit, and maybe I shouldn't talk about this on OLR, but I will, I didn't

433
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:49,020
get into the whole GameStop thing because I kind of felt like it's probably too late.

434
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,360
Like that's just my own personal opinion.

435
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,580
Like I kind of feel like late if I went, did you invest in the GameStop thing?

436
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,580
Loki?

437
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,580
Not yet.

438
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,140
Um, Monday I will though, because my account, like it takes a long time for everything.

439
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,820
Um, I was able to get in on AMC because you can do that through cash app actually.

440
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:10,020
So you can open an account through cash app, transfer stuff almost immediately and you

441
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,020
can buy certain stocks.

442
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:15,460
They don't have GameStop on there, which is unfortunate if I did AMC and I'm up a little

443
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,460
bit there.

444
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:21,460
Um, I plan on getting in on Doge as well on Monday, um, just for the hell of it.

445
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,640
I got a Dogecoin somewhere.

446
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,500
Because if you think about like, I didn't really, you shouldn't, I should have done

447
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:31,860
it a long time ago, but like really it's like a fret back when it was like a fraction of

448
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,860
a penny.

449
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,300
It's like, it can really only go up.

450
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,820
I mean, it's just, it is very volatile.

451
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,980
It's going up and down, but you just buy sell.

452
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,080
I mean, I don't know, this is more interesting for me, like considering that, like when the

453
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:48,020
lottery was up to a billion dollars, like I can, I can remember how many lottery tickets

454
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,380
I bought each week that came, I'm like, damn, I could just put that money into the stock

455
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,380
market.

456
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,500
At least that's a little bit more, you know, that's it.

457
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,420
And by the way, you have chatters that are advising you against the Doge thing, but you

458
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,420
know, make your own decision.

459
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:05,620
But I didn't really finish my thought, but I will say, uh, I did not get into the stock

460
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,620
thing.

461
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,020
I got into the first cryptocurrency this week and it was not Doge.

462
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,260
It was different one.

463
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,980
Um, but I, you know, I made my own, I kind of did my own research and made my own decision.

464
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,940
I didn't spend a lot, but it was, it's just, it's exactly Loki's reasoning right there

465
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:23,980
that, that's 50 bucks right now, it's because they're blocking people from buying it right

466
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,980
now.

467
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,620
The apps that used to like Robinhood, another app that you can buy Doge in, they block people

468
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,660
from buying Doge right now.

469
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,060
And a lot of, I know AMC is down a little bit as well.

470
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:41,980
But once again, I don't invest money that I don't expect to lose if, if it, if we lose

471
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,980
it, we lose it.

472
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,980
You know, that was my thing.

473
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,980
That's the point.

474
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:49,900
I put in 50 bucks, which would have been my Reno gambling money in a, in a normal world.

475
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,540
You know, I'm not putting in a ton of money.

476
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,180
I know better than that.

477
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:58,100
I'm just saying it's, it's money that like, it's not going to make a, it's no big deal

478
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,420
if I lose it.

479
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,420
Yeah.

480
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:05,420
And Bobby and Chats says, yeah, I'm considering learning about the stock market in the same

481
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,820
way I go to a casino.

482
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:11,140
I set aside money and I say, I will never see this money again and use that.

483
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,280
And Quest Buster says, Loki is investing right.

484
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,200
Don't invest in anything that you can't afford to lose.

485
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,660
And so Jamie, you're saying, I don't want to lose anything, so I'm just not playing

486
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,660
this game.

487
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,660
And that's fine too.

488
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:28,300
I know, I know that, that mine is invested in a very stable business that is not losing

489
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:34,860
money in most of its markets, that has split several times in the last few years and the

490
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,940
value has of course gone up incredibly.

491
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:43,220
So yeah, I'm pretty happy and, and for the record, I do all of my buying and selling

492
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,220
through E-Trade.

493
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,660
So yeah.

494
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:49,500
And I have, I've used one of those micro investing apps.

495
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,060
I'm not going to give them a free ad, but basically it's one of those apps where you

496
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:55,420
put a little bit of money into it and they, it's a little bit more of a traditional like

497
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,180
stock portfolio type of thing.

498
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:02,060
But again, that's money that would have been extra Starbucks trips during the workday that

499
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,960
I'm not doing right now.

500
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
So there's that.

501
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,720
And yeah, I have a 401k and I've had one for a while, so.

502
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,720
Like Bobby was saying, there's companies that also pay dividends, which mine is set up that

503
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
way.

504
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,600
And my dividends get reinvested into the same stock.

505
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,000
I mean, I could put it in something else if I wanted to, or I could cash that out if I

506
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,480
wanted to.

507
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:33,320
But I'll tell you what, you know, having that money there from my payouts has been, it saved

508
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,760
our tail a couple of times, you know, when we needed that money and we made sure that

509
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,920
we, you know, and the thing is, is that the company, as I said before, it's the company

510
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,080
I work at, which no one gets to know.

511
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,040
But because it's so stable and performing so well, I can basically say, okay, I need

512
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,900
three grand for this and I can go in there and get that three grand and it will have

513
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,920
refilled itself in three to six months.

514
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,320
So or replaced itself.

515
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:06,040
Well, I mean, I will say this, too, about all this story and everything is that I think,

516
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,200
you know, through this whole experience, and I think video games are to credit in part

517
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,200
for this.

518
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,680
Yes, we all learned about the stock market and economics in high school, but how much

519
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:19,800
did we really get practical knowledge and use it until the year we were all stuck at

520
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,460
home and had to play Animal Crossing because there was nothing else to do?

521
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,600
And which honestly, it hasn't ended.

522
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,080
I mean, I realize some parts of the country people think it has, but it hasn't.

523
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,920
The lights at the end of the tunnel, we're not there yet.

524
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,360
But I almost wonder how much of that kind of enabled some of this.

525
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,560
And now with this all over and this getting meme-ified all over Twitter, all over Facebook,

526
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,140
all over social media, I really think we're moving towards something where you're going

527
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:50,220
to see more common people that are investing in the stock market through these apps and

528
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,160
things that let you kind of cherry pick what you want to do.

529
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,760
I think it's and I think video games are a big part of that.

530
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,120
They really are.

531
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,320
So, yeah.

532
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:07,280
So when I was in my economics class, we had to do that stock market thing, create portfolio.

533
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,320
So I spent all my money on penny stocks and then they doubled in price and I made a ton

534
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,320
of money.

535
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,880
So I'm doing the same thing.

536
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,880
You know what we did?

537
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
Good luck.

538
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,880
What did you do?

539
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:28,400
We invested in Intel in 94 and in a funeral home and I'll tell you why.

540
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,760
Keep in mind, this is Jamie the Goth and the funeral home was my idea.

541
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:39,920
It was like a company of funeral homes, like a franchise, but kind of.

542
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,280
I was like, look, people die every day.

543
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,400
They're always going to have business.

544
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:52,840
I've never seen a funeral home, at least any type of related chain, a funeral home ever

545
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,680
go out of business.

546
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,880
I don't want to be disgusting, but you can't help but notice, especially with this past

547
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,720
year and everything that's happened.

548
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,840
Like if you owned a lot of those stocks, you're probably doing pretty well.

549
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,520
Or if you were in the government and bought in on like, was it, I think there was some

550
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,920
of the PPE and body bags and stuff like that.

551
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,800
They were investing in that because they knew that the numbers were going to go up.

552
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,960
I mean, it's gross.

553
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,680
I'm sorry, but that's the reality.

554
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,480
Anyway, I always half wondered if the tyrant had investments in that, and that's why we

555
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:32,600
never had a lot of our, any good legislation on it, but that was a little conspiracy of mine.

556
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,600
If only we could actually investigate those types of things, but anyhow, we won't go there.

557
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,760
Anyway, I'm looking forward to the eighth and I'll leave it at that.

558
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,080
So anything else we want to say about the stonks and all that, and that goes for you

559
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,080
guys in chat as well.

560
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,840
Yeah, Bobby's saying, I should have invested in zoom a year ago.

561
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,560
I don't think they had their IPO yet at that time, but certainly comparable companies,

562
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,560
WebEx, you know, Cisco.

563
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:06,080
One thing I need to repeat what Bobby said, because this is very important, is that we

564
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,440
are not financial advisors.

565
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,360
We don't do any of that.

566
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,040
You know, that's not what we do.

567
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
We're not giving legal advice.

568
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,920
We're not giving financial advice.

569
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,840
So do what you will with what we say.

570
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,920
This is our opinion on the matter.

571
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:29,080
You know, so again, do what you will with what we've shared with you, with our experiences

572
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:34,880
on it, but certainly educate yourself completely before you dive into something like this.

573
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,400
Just don't do it on a whim.

574
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Yeah.

575
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,200
It's sad that we need that disclaimer, but I understand why completely.

576
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,520
So I would hope all that's obvious.

577
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,760
Yes, of course we are not financial advisors.

578
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,280
We're just, we're just schmoes in our basement, but, um, so are all the people that are starting

579
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,200
a wall street revolution right now.

580
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
So congrats.

581
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,040
Let's just be honest.

582
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,040
Like I, like the whole reason I played a lot of, cause I know it's like an insanely, no

583
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,360
way you're going to win any of that stuff, but like, I'm just like at that point right

584
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,320
now with my job and everything, like, I just don't want to do it anymore.

585
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,640
I just don't want to do work anymore.

586
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,720
My mom always said, my mom always said it costs a dollar to dream.

587
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,720
So go get the lotto ticket.

588
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:20,000
And so like at this point, like I just want to have an active, like just something that

589
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,120
I'm doing to try to make things better.

590
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,120
Like I get it.

591
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,300
Like, yeah, you could lose some money on stuff, but if you do, like, if you just be careful

592
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:33,540
with what you're doing and you don't try to overextend yourself, then maybe you can make

593
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,520
some small gains here and there and stuff.

594
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,120
And maybe you do get lucky with some of this stuff.

595
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,880
It's ironic because I actually thought about investing in GameStop a while back because

596
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,680
I was like, well, maybe I should throw some money in the stock market because my 401k

597
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,920
portfolio is not doing that, you know, hot, you know, why not?

598
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,760
And their stock's pretty cheap.

599
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,680
So should have done that, but oh, well, what are you going to do?

600
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,680
Yeah.

601
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,160
All right.

602
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,720
Let's go ahead and move on.

603
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,000
Let's talk about other things that we escape to when we don't want to work anymore.

604
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,280
And that is video games.

605
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,600
So let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks.

606
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,160
So dark soccer, I'll start with you.

607
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,280
How was your gaming week?

608
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,400
Well, lots of Animal Crossing, duh.

609
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:18,640
I also got Cyber Shadow, which is sort of like a Revenge of the Ninja by the same folks

610
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,560
that did Shovel Knight.

611
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:29,740
It definitely has that same kind of feel to it, but it's definitely, definitely a little

612
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,860
bit of a pissy game.

613
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:38,760
You know, there's some cheap kills in there, but your save points are pretty, I'd say pretty

614
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,640
well spread apart.

615
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,260
The fights for the bosses are fairly interesting.

616
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:49,740
It's got some very cool mechanics and some bonuses in there.

617
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,640
The story is pretty okay so far.

618
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,480
Dan, of course, has been playing it a lot more than I have.

619
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,840
So it's sort of like if I start playing a game and then I sit down to watch Dan play

620
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,400
it, it's like, oh, I won't play anymore, you know?

621
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,040
But it's a really good game.

622
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
Absolutely worth checking out.

623
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:10,720
20 bucks on Switch right now on electronic download.

624
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,960
And so there's a pretty rich been it.

625
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:18,560
I'm still playing Boardscapes, which, you know, it's just a good waste of time.

626
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:25,020
So about it, I'm actually been going back and looking at Saturn games.

627
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:31,400
There's this thing that's kind of like an EverDrive for Saturn where you, I think you

628
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:36,920
switch it out in part for the graphic card port on the back of it.

629
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:42,080
And then you load ROMs on it like you would in EverDrive.

630
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,960
I have to look it up again.

631
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,060
It's like 200 bucks.

632
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:52,960
But I'm kind of thinking about it because we have a lot of Saturn games and of course

633
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,840
I don't want anything to happen to them.

634
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,740
But it also means that I can play translated versions of games that I own that I've never

635
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,840
finished because my reading comprehension level in Japanese was not great.

636
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:12,260
So if I find the name of it again, I'll link it in chat, but we've been watching a lot

637
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,560
of like Saturn reviews and things like that.

638
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,220
So that's really where it stuck into my head.

639
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,220
Just throwing that out there.

640
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,300
It's not really what I'm playing, but what I have in mind to play.

641
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,300
All right.

642
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,300
All right.

643
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,300
Oh, and I did play Pirates of the Caribbean pinball.

644
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,300
So I did play some pinball.

645
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,300
Did you get one of those in your house?

646
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,300
Yeah.

647
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,300
One of the Jersey Jack ones.

648
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,860
Oh, nice.

649
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,860
It's in Dan's office.

650
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,860
Wow.

651
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,580
How many machines do you have in your house right now?

652
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,580
In the house?

653
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,700
Physically in the house, four.

654
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,740
And then another six or seven in the garage.

655
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,980
I think we still own like 15.

656
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,300
I consider that part of the house.

657
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

658
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,100
Well, I'm just trying to think about it legitimately.

659
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:55,460
Like my world cup is off at Dan's friends to be shopped.

660
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,300
We just got back shadow.

661
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:03,300
So yeah, Dan put that in the hallway, which completely annoys me, but whatever.

662
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:09,660
Yeah, we've loaned out a few and we have a few and there's some that I really wish I

663
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:15,340
could get rid of because I don't like them and I want money.

664
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,900
Actually the thing is, is that I'm really ready to like get rid of about four tables

665
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,580
and move the ones that are in the house outside.

666
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:26,420
Like maybe keep theater of magic in the house, but that's about it.

667
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,700
Theater and world cup should stay in the house forever because they're my babies.

668
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,320
You know, would it be fair to say, I mean, I know you kind of said that you don't do

669
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,540
a lot with stock or cryptocurrency outside of your one preferred stock, but would it

670
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:41,100
be fair to say that maybe where you do invest money is pinball tables?

671
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:46,420
I mean, cause you kind of take them in, make them better, trade them, flip them, whatever.

672
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,260
I mean, it's kind of what you're doing a little bit.

673
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,260
Yeah.

674
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:54,100
It's not really necessary for hobby, for fun, not for money, I guess.

675
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:59,100
It's like the restoration business, you know, and, and the values of things go up and down.

676
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:09,000
That's really just going to be not, not stock, not really like stocks, but just more of knowing

677
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
your market.

678
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,660
We, you know, try to have the best thing that's out on the market.

679
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:18,680
I guess it's very rudimentary capitalism where you take your, your product or in, or in some

680
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,340
cases, you know, the components of a product, put it together into your product and then

681
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,340
you sell it.

682
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,780
Or, you know, people who flip houses, that's the same thing.

683
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,660
Buy them cheap, fix them cheap, sell them high.

684
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,660
Car flipping.

685
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,660
There's people who do that.

686
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,420
My, one of my exes used to do that with seventies Oldsmobiles.

687
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,420
Yep.

688
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:48,260
Now, if he can find me a 1970 422, then I'm down for that, but the thing is, is that with

689
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:54,820
our network for, for a pinball is that we do have the ability to say, I don't have this,

690
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,540
but I know who does.

691
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,900
And we kind of scratch each other's backs in the community.

692
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:05,240
I mean, there are some really cutthroat people, but for the most part, it's more of a, a community

693
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,240
level thing.

694
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,900
You know, if we've put in work to it, but a good buddy is like, Hey, you know, I really

695
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,260
been looking for, I'm going to throw something out.

696
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:18,620
I've really been looking for doctor who, and I see yours is in really great shape.

697
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,220
I know you just shopped it.

698
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:25,080
We can say, well, you're a good guy and there's a chance we'll get it back from you.

699
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,180
So we'll sell it to you for, for what we paid for it.

700
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:33,980
Plus the repairs, you know, and not make a profit on it, but we know we have a chance

701
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,980
of playing that again.

702
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,380
Cause it's at someone's house.

703
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:41,060
So it's really more like community oriented.

704
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:47,860
It's not quite the same, but it's similar enough to, yeah, Dan wouldn't let me sell

705
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:54,740
my doctor who sorry, Bobby, um, to see a Tiberian chat says Jamie flipping tables, kinda literally.

706
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:59,660
I mean, in a way I, Hey look, one day, one day I will have my baby Pac-Man table one

707
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:03,020
day, but step, step, small steps.

708
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:08,020
One day, if we are going to sell that table, I am going to insist that it be to you.

709
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,020
Okay.

710
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,420
All right.

711
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,420
We got to move on though.

712
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,740
We could, we could do a whole podcast on pinball table, uh, um, maintenance.

713
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,940
I'm kind of surprised Jamie doesn't have one, but maybe someday, uh, but for now let's move

714
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,940
on with other,

715
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,940
I'm not good at that.

716
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,940
Dan does that shit.

717
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,940
All right.

718
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,860
Uh, you, well then you do the production, you get him to be the expert and you're the,

719
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,860
you're the host.

720
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,860
All right.

721
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:32,100
Um, now, uh, I'll tell you Jack danger does that, uh, already better than I do.

722
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,100
So okay.

723
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,100
Fair enough.

724
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,100
Yeah.

725
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,100
All right.

726
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,100
Yeah.

727
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:41,020
So go ahead and give some kudos to dead flip podcast and his live stream.

728
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,180
You want to watch some good pinball, check out dead flip.

729
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,180
All right.

730
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,180
They didn't even pay for that spot.

731
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,180
All right.

732
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,180
Low key.

733
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,180
He's a good guy.

734
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,180
He helped me decide on Dan's Christmas present.

735
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,180
That's fair.

736
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,180
Uh, low key.

737
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,180
How was your game week?

738
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:57,100
Um, so I didn't play a whole ton because I've been working on my game, so I did play a lot

739
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,180
of mobile stuff.

740
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:05,380
So, um, I've been switching between like Pokemon go and Minecraft earth and Orna.

741
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,940
Just depending on where I'm at, usually cause I run out of things to do in one of those.

742
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:13,660
And so I switched to the other one, uh, so I've been doing that and then, um, I picked

743
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,820
up an, an original NES this week.

744
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,260
Um, so that should be coming pretty soon.

745
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:26,360
Uh, so I can test, you know, the games actually burn with my, um, you know, ROM burner.

746
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:33,980
So, uh, you know, game prep prepared for the physical copies of a pixel poops number two.

747
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:38,580
And, uh, yeah, and also we're set to launch on the 10th of February.

748
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:43,300
So just working towards that, just trying to get everything done.

749
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:48,140
Wait, wait, we're set to launch on the 10th of February, meaning your, your NES ROM or

750
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,140
like your game.

751
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,140
Yeah.

752
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:57,700
So like a pixel poops to, um, the pixel poops on steam and the, the, uh, pixel poop 64 should

753
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,100
all be February 10th.

754
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,300
Oh, I didn't know you were all aiming for the same day.

755
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,300
Okay.

756
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,300
Wow.

757
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,620
That's amazing.

758
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,620
Well, good luck.

759
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,620
All right.

760
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,620
Couple more weeks.

761
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,620
Yeah.

762
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:12,580
I've, I've been playing, um, the beta thanks to Y Y R given those codes in our discord

763
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,500
at vog network.com slash discord.

764
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,580
Um, and, uh, it's, it's fun.

765
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:21,780
It's it, it has a lot, I mean, for as silly as the name is and the concept and everything,

766
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:26,900
there is something, it really has like that Atari 2,600, like very simple game, but can

767
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,820
get very difficult, very fast type of charm to it.

768
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,980
Like I didn't even realize that he kind of built something into it where like, once you

769
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,820
get a certain score, it gets a lot harder because the there'll be some different types

770
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,820
of walking.

771
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:43,860
I don't want to ruin it all, but, uh, it's, uh, yeah, it's, it's, it really invokes a

772
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,940
lot of what made those old Atari 2,600 games fun.

773
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:51,900
So, um, check it out, uh, when it hits steam or get on our discord and get the, get the

774
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,700
peekaboo a little bit early.

775
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,700
All right.

776
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:59,500
Um, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says I didn't get a code because I'm going to buy it instead.

777
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,380
I'll, I'll still throw, I think it's actually going to be free to play.

778
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,220
I'll still throw money at the DLC or I'll gift it to somebody.

779
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,940
That's what I did with the last game that he gave me a code for.

780
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:11,860
I, I just get, I bought it for somebody else that I thought would like it.

781
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,900
So, all right.

782
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,260
Um, let's see other, uh, stuff for my gaming week.

783
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,620
Honestly, I've had kind of a slower week when it comes to games as well.

784
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,700
I've been playing a little bit of Pokemon, meaning, uh, shield continuing with the DLC,

785
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,780
but also, um, Pokemon go quite a bit, uh, was working.

786
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,140
I've done all four weeks of the collection challenge and Pokemon go.

787
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,540
So, uh, been doing that and that's fun.

788
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:39,940
Um, and, uh, otherwise, as far as, uh, other games I've been playing Final Fantasy 14 a

789
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:44,580
lot, that's pretty much been most of the bulk of my gaming time, uh, continuing the online

790
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,620
adventures there.

791
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,740
There's a tiny patch coming on Tuesday.

792
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,300
That's going to allow the blue mage job to go up to 70.

793
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,260
So that's really exciting.

794
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,540
And then they're going to do something called the relic weapon, which is like the, uh, a

795
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:58,740
really fancy, you know, uh, weapon you have to work really hard to get.

796
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,300
They're kind of putting another step into that for another upgrade.

797
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,580
So that should be fun as well.

798
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:06,420
And then there are big announcements for Final Fantasy 14 on Friday.

799
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,740
They're actually doing a big stream where they're going to, uh, assumably unveil the

800
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:16,900
next expansion because we were supposed to have fan fest, uh, in San Diego this year

801
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:22,660
in October, but obviously thanks to, uh, miss Rona, we didn't have that, uh, anything.

802
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,860
So this is kind of like the assumed makeup for some of that.

803
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,300
So we're getting that on Friday.

804
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,220
I really wanted to co-stream it, um, with some of my Final Fantasy buddies.

805
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,180
Uh, but we don't know if legally Square is allowing that.

806
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:39,620
So unfortunately we're erring on the side of, um, we'll just watch ourselves and I'll

807
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,220
be here to comment on it on Sunday.

808
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:45,620
But if I find out that they allow co-streams of it, then, um, stay tuned to our Twitter,

809
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:50,100
uh, either over at twitter.com slash OLR for the show or twitter.com slash vog network

810
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,620
for the network, uh, for any updates and last minute things that are plotted.

811
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:57,620
If I find out that Square does indeed allow the co-streaming of that sort of thing.

812
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:00,580
And if anybody happens to know that in our chat, um, let me know.

813
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,740
Cause I'd be very thankful to know that information.

814
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,180
All right.

815
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,500
Uh, but that's really it for my gaming week otherwise.

816
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,980
So let's get into some news and we'll go to Loki for our first story tonight.

817
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,700
Yeah, let's talk about Amazon game studios.

818
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,460
I haven't really heard too much about them.

819
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:21,380
Um, and apparently the reason why is because they're having some issues.

820
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:28,340
Um, so according to a report by Bloomberg, there's been some serious, um, stuff going

821
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,100
on behind the scenes at, uh, Amazon game studio.

822
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:37,380
So right now, um, they had conducted about 30 interviews with former Amazon employees

823
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:41,060
and talked about some of the stuff going on behind the scenes.

824
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:46,180
So for example, they said, uh, the game that they're working on new world, uh, which

825
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:50,660
apparently you play as a colonists in the fictionalized 17th century America.

826
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:57,860
Um, they says the enemy designs born uncomfortable similarity with two native Americans.

827
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:03,700
And after they had hired a tribal consultant, they found that indeed it was offensive.

828
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:11,860
So that, that pushed back the release, uh, from August of 2020 to now some time in the spring.

829
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:17,940
Uh, also you had, you know, courses like bro culture that's going on, which we've heard

830
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:23,540
a lot in different companies, but apparently that's still something that they're, um, dealing

831
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,500
with there as well.

832
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:32,500
And apparently following a disagreement with a male employee, uh, of senior leadership,

833
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:37,860
one of the women that was, uh, interviewed, he made up some new position above her and

834
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,780
hired men into those roles.

835
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:46,900
Um, apparently the leader of the entire games division has never made a video game before.

836
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:54,020
And he's basically frustrated developers with, um, basic takes and had, they said,

837
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:57,380
troubling differentiating between gameplay and concept footage.

838
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:04,020
Um, they were forcing everybody into that, uh, proprietary lumber yard, uh, program that

839
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,420
they had to develop games in.

840
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:11,780
So their game engine, and apparently that was a little bit difficult as well, but now

841
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:16,420
that they have this new guy on board from take two, he's kind of eased that mandate,

842
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,260
but that did cause some issues as well.

843
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,780
So it's just been kind of, uh, not smooth.

844
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:27,060
Um, so yeah, I don't know.

845
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:32,500
I'm curious to see what, what they come out with, but like right now, I mean, to me, it's

846
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:38,980
almost like stadia where they have like these stadia developed games, but like, where are

847
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:39,460
these?

848
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:42,100
I mean, we haven't really seen anything from them.

849
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:42,500
Yeah.

850
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,300
Um, fifth dream in chat says, sounds like a winner all around.

851
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,620
And by that, I mean, close Amazon games and give up.

852
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:51,460
Um, quest buster says they hired some top shelf names to work on their products too.

853
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,460
And most, if not all of them left.

854
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,420
Uh, and then let's see, uh, this is a newer chatter.

855
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,860
So welcome a dragon.

856
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:58,260
Summer.

857
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,460
It's blue on black on my screen, so I can't even read it, but thank you.

858
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:10,660
Jamie says, um, that lumberyard engine is a disaster too.

859
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:13,060
It was cry engine, but then all torn apart.

860
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,420
It's such a shame.

861
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:19,380
So, um, yeah, there's a lot of, uh, issues going on with the Amazon thing and it almost

862
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,460
makes you wonder if they're ever going to get a game out.

863
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:26,980
I mean, yes, I know new world is like, but like, like legit, actually like have a game

864
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:27,380
out.

865
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,780
It's, uh, doesn't, doesn't seem too promising over there.

866
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,380
I didn't have high expectations.

867
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:34,440
Yeah.

868
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,220
So womp, womp.

869
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:37,720
All right.

870
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:42,580
Well, another game, I don't think people necessarily had a high, high expectations for this game,

871
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:45,700
but it's interesting to hear that it's doing, uh, well enough.

872
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,860
And that is the game, the medium.

873
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,980
This seems like a game I want to check this game out because I guess it's supposed to

874
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,300
be like a psychological game, but not gross.

875
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,780
Like it kind of invokes silent Hill.

876
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:59,860
And, uh, I mean, so far as the fact that Akira Yamaoka does some of the music in it

877
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:03,140
and, uh, Mary Elizabeth McGlynn apparently sings some songs in it.

878
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:07,940
So, I mean, talk about a throwback to silent Hill, but it's the game, but I I'm told do

879
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,420
not expect it to be silent Hill or you will be disappointed.

880
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,220
So I want to make sure that is appropriately communicated as well.

881
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:19,060
Um, but it is a game called the medium and the medium came out on PC and X-Box and apparently,

882
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:24,500
uh, via an interview with money.pl, which is a Polish website regarding of course, money,

883
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:30,020
uh, the studio who developed, uh, the medium has said it has already made back its money

884
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,780
for development and marketing costs.

885
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,260
So anything from here out is pure profit.

886
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:39,380
It's, uh, interesting to note that the medium is a day one X-Box game pass game.

887
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,300
And this is how a lot of people are discovering it.

888
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:44,580
And I know that's one reason why it's kind of on my radar right now as well as it's like,

889
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:49,220
Oh, it's a psychological kind of thriller game and I don't have to pay extra money for it.

890
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:52,020
Uh, on top of what I'm already paying for game pass.

891
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,140
So it's interesting to hear that that is already successful.

892
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,980
Some folks are kind of taking that a step further to be like, this is,

893
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:03,380
this is an example of how game pass is successful for a lot of games right now.

894
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:07,060
Um, and so this being more of a fringe title,

895
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:12,420
not sure that people would have dropped $60 to experiment on this game and figure it out.

896
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,860
But with game pass, you got a lot more that are willing to take the risk.

897
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:19,060
So it's, it's very interesting to hear that it's been successful.

898
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:22,580
I mean, breaking even the first week sounds pretty successful to me,

899
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,340
that it's all going to be profit from here on out,

900
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:27,380
especially if they end up releasing a version on switch.

901
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,580
I don't know if that's technically possible,

902
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:31,300
but releasing a version on PlayStation later and who knows what.

903
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,500
So, um, by the way, if you weren't already aware,

904
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,380
X-Box game pass has 15 million subscribers.

905
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,220
So pretty neat.

906
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,060
Uh, those of you that are listening live,

907
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:44,500
they have any of you out there checked out the medium.

908
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:52,420
So, um, uh, dragon semi says, uh, medium screams, silent hill and free on game pass.

909
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,980
Uh, game pass is nailing it so much right now,

910
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:58,580
other than the X-Box gold price increase the X-Box retracted.

911
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,900
Yeah, we talked about that a little bit on last week's show.

912
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:05,780
That was not a great look, but at the end of the day, at least they've retracted.

913
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:08,740
Um, even if they maybe showed their ass a little bit, uh,

914
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:12,180
I think game pass is still the place to be at least for now.

915
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,740
We will see what develops over the next year.

916
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,900
Are they going to do price increase on game pass?

917
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,340
I suppose it's inevitable, but I don't think they can really get away with it

918
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:24,260
until they've got their halo and they've got more of those series X.

919
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:27,300
Um, I don't want to say exclusive cause I know that's not their plan,

920
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:31,860
but series X like focused, I guess games, uh, would really,

921
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,940
I think help sell that a little bit.

922
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:37,940
Uh, pod culture says medium is a rare game that is well done.

923
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,700
I see what you did there like that.

924
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,900
Uh, as John Hunter Matt says, it's on my list of things to try next.

925
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,980
I just signed up for game pass.

926
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,060
So yeah, I want to check that out as well.

927
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,940
Um, I was listening to Bobby cause he's on before us, of course,

928
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:53,540
here at VOG Network and he was talking about a patent that that game has,

929
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,340
where I guess apparently you actually control a character

930
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,860
in kind of two places at once.

931
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:01,140
Like there's a normal realm and a spirit realm type of thing

932
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:02,340
that you're kind of controlling the character.

933
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,780
Sounds like a neat mechanic.

934
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,620
So I, uh, I want to check that out.

935
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:06,820
So pretty cool.

936
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:08,340
All right.

937
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:11,300
Uh, let's move on dark Sakura, something that's been getting

938
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,500
a lot of buzz this week, right?

939
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:13,860
So yeah.

940
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:20,340
Um, Konami, uh, did, uh, some basic restructuring, um, by dissolving,

941
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:23,300
uh, well, it's, it's announced that it played a dissolve three production

942
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,900
divisions to, uh, adapt to the market.

943
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:30,180
Um, and they put this out on the economy's corporate, uh, website,

944
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,140
but this made people think that they were going to be shutting down

945
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:34,980
their video game division.

946
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,580
And they say, this is not the case.

947
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,020
Um, they are very insistent on it.

948
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:44,660
The quote States, the announcement, uh, made refers to an internal

949
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:47,780
restructure with production divisions being consolidated.

950
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:51,860
We have not quote shut down our video game, our video gaming division.

951
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,900
So we'll see.

952
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:58,660
I mean, Konami hasn't really been putting out a whole lot in the way

953
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:59,220
of games.

954
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:03,460
I mean, just like metal gear and some reissues of earlier games.

955
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:10,500
Um, the, uh, the only game I think right now in production is PES 2022.

956
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:14,980
Um, and there's rumors of a silent Hill game, but we don't know.

957
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,700
I wouldn't hedge a lot of money on that.

958
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,980
I'd be very surprised.

959
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:22,820
I think if the Konami, you know, digital thing, you know, for the games

960
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,860
division is still around, hopefully, and I really think this is the best

961
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:26,900
case scenario.

962
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:31,060
They're licensing out a lot of their IPs to other companies, hopefully.

963
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,940
And I think we also know that in Japan, um, they're still doing, you know,

964
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:38,580
cause this game is rooted in like Bamani stuff and some of those, um, uh,

965
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:43,140
more like evergreen, always services online in Japan that they've been

966
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:43,460
doing.

967
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,860
You know, the, the, uh, there's a beat mania 2DX online, Infinitas, whatever

968
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:48,340
is the thing.

969
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:53,060
And they've, they've got, I think sound voltex has one pop music has one.

970
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:55,140
I think a lot of those games kind of have one.

971
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:58,100
So, um, I think that's something they're still invested in as well.

972
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,980
So I w I wouldn't look to other companies to develop music games,

973
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,020
unfortunately.

974
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:06,500
Um, but I think some of these other ones, I wouldn't you love it if they

975
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,300
would let somebody else work on a Castlevania or a silent Hill?

976
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:09,700
I don't know.

977
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:13,940
Well, they had a good shot of good silent Hill game and then fucked them

978
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:14,500
up.

979
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,860
Fucked, uh, uh, true.

980
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,660
That like words Kojima.

981
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,100
Ah, yes.

982
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,300
I can't make words happen.

983
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,500
They fucked Kojima over.

984
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:23,960
Yeah.

985
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,840
So, um, yeah, I wouldn't hold your breath on anything that exciting coming.

986
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:34,840
Um, I maybe some more like retro types of collections, but I don't know.

987
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,120
They've been doing already.

988
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:40,040
So like I said, I don't see anything particularly new for the console market

989
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,720
and retro can only take you so far.

990
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,840
Plus you have to remember a lot.

991
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,960
Like let's say they let another developer make a new Castlevania.

992
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,560
Oh, here's a game that I played this week.

993
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,360
I totally, cause I played it on Sunday after OLR.

994
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,720
So I forgot about it during my gaming week, but, uh, bloodstained

995
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:58,360
ritual of the night has that classic mode that I checked out and boy.

996
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:58,840
Oh boy.

997
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,120
Is it just Castlevania?

998
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:04,680
The like, it's exactly what it's not even shy about it.

999
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,760
It's just like, I'm not even talking about them.

1000
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,800
I'm talking about the classic mode is like old school Castlevania, like

1001
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,720
vampire Hunter, like that old school, you know, original game.

1002
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,720
Uh, and it's, it's fun.

1003
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:16,200
It's great.

1004
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,000
It's well done.

1005
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,080
But it also really makes you realize like, okay, even if Konami suddenly

1006
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:26,360
did another Castlevania game, Igarashi has clearly moved on and is doing his

1007
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,160
own thing.

1008
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,040
So the Castlevania you're going to get, it's going to be different.

1009
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,200
Now different can go both ways.

1010
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,400
I don't think different actually automatically has to be a negative.

1011
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,280
Um, unfortunately you look at Konami and you look at some of their

1012
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,440
choices, um, like the Contra game that came out recently, which honestly,

1013
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:46,120
I guess Dark Tetsuya was a fan, but a lot of people I've kind of seen

1014
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:49,880
online are like that game was, that was Contra full of choices.

1015
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,560
Um, and so, you know, it didn't did it up so well.

1016
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:58,120
Um, but if they let somebody else do a Castlevania, you know, the right

1017
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,120
company might actually be able to do it very well.

1018
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:04,200
Somebody like, um, the people that have been doing the blaster master reboots

1019
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,640
have been knocking it out of the park.

1020
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,640
So why not let them do it?

1021
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,720
Is that way forward or who's actually developing that?

1022
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,480
But they're, they're knocking it out of the park, honestly.

1023
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,240
So, all right.

1024
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:21,400
Um, going to our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, uh, Kate

1025
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:26,440
Catastrophe asks, which company is worse, Konami or EA?

1026
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,440
Um, both for different reasons.

1027
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,120
That's a very hard question.

1028
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:34,280
Um, they both have done some, I mean, it's hard.

1029
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:37,960
I think it's, it's, or I should say it's easy for me to want to say Konami.

1030
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,840
Cause I don't really care about the sports games.

1031
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:41,400
So whatever.

1032
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,760
I mean, there is mass effect.

1033
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,760
So I guess I have that involved with EA.

1034
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,840
But with Konami, you look at how they've tripped over themselves time and time again.

1035
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,720
And this show is really rooted in like music games, Maimani and all that.

1036
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,440
That's, you know, where our name came from and what we talked about for the

1037
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,240
first couple of years of the show and so on was really that culture.

1038
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:02,520
So to see like that whole thing, Konami is really, I mean, I know DDR is still

1039
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,720
around kinda, and I know it still has a loyal following.

1040
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:09,640
I know there's other podcasts that are now doing what we did the first two

1041
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,280
years of our show where they're talking about like DDR culture, music and

1042
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,720
culture and stuff, which is great.

1043
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:14,840
More props to them.

1044
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,320
But I just feel like it could have been so much more.

1045
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,360
It could have been so much more.

1046
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:26,040
And I think Guitar Hero and Rockband and that whole, you know, uh, thing that

1047
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,480
kind of came and went, I think shows that Konami could have done more than

1048
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,520
just like Rock Revolution, which was their answer to all that at the same time.

1049
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,480
That was awful.

1050
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,360
Yeah, but that's, that was their solution to how are we going to go

1051
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,440
up against Guitar Hero and Rockband.

1052
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,960
And it was a terrible idea.

1053
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,480
It was a terrible idea.

1054
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,200
And then after that they had Beaten Groovy.

1055
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,840
So I mean, like choices.

1056
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,060
Yeah.

1057
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,040
All right.

1058
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,640
Let's move on Loki.

1059
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:53,320
Yeah.

1060
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:59,240
So Valve is facing a lawsuit over, uh, apparently issues with the Steam

1061
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:05,640
controller and that it's design actually was patented by somebody else.

1062
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:12,840
So this is, um, regarding a third-party controller maker SCUF that says back

1063
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:18,200
in 2014, that the design for the Steam controller was infringing on the,

1064
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:24,040
uh, Ironbird, Ironberg patents, but they went ahead with the design anyways.

1065
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:29,640
Um, and apparently the patent is regarding the rear side triggers.

1066
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:35,080
They said that that's, um, which is on, I guess, opposite side of the pads.

1067
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:40,200
So what I'm guessing is it's not like your normal trigger buttons, but like

1068
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:45,080
those under controller triggers that you have on some of these, um, you know,

1069
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:49,080
fancier buttons, I think they have like on the, uh, pro controller and stuff

1070
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:52,200
like that from the Xbox pro controller or whatever.

1071
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:58,040
Um, but yeah, so apparently they were filing a lawsuit regarding that.

1072
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:58,520
I don't know.

1073
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,400
The controller sucks.

1074
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,000
So whatever.

1075
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,560
But, um, it's kind of a little late for that.

1076
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,200
They've already discontinued the controller and I don't think that they

1077
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,560
made much money off of that.

1078
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:13,640
It's gonna be hard to argue, uh, losses on that, but we'll see what happens.

1079
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,120
Settlement.

1080
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,000
I'm guessing.

1081
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,560
Did you hear about the other lawsuit and saw involving valve about, um, was it,

1082
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:24,120
no, we had the geo blocking a couple of weeks ago, but there was another one

1083
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:28,520
about, um, their contract clause about that.

1084
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:32,440
Um, you have to, if you could put your game up for sale on steam, which I

1085
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:36,600
think the lawsuit, I think was trying to claim that steam kind of has a sense

1086
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:40,840
of a monopoly on the market when it comes to PC, um, that it has to be

1087
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:44,600
lowest price on steam, even if, so you can't put it like lower price on

1088
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:48,120
humble, or if it goes on sale somewhere else, you have to put on sale on steam

1089
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:51,000
too, which I, I kind of thought, and again, I don't have the story in front

1090
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:51,560
of me.

1091
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,840
Um, maybe some of you in chat recall this a little better than I do.

1092
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,480
Um, but I, I seem to think like.

1093
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:01,960
Didn't, doesn't Amazon have a controversial thing like this too?

1094
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,240
When it comes to their store, um, at least when it comes to mobile apps, I

1095
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,440
know was a thing.

1096
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:10,120
Um, cause that was a very controversial sounds vaguely familiar.

1097
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:10,600
Yeah.

1098
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:14,520
Um, I'm not sure, but yeah, I could, I could see them kind of doing something

1099
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:18,840
like that or not even necessarily just, you know, valve, but like, I think, you

1100
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:23,480
know, a lot of different mobile storefronts and stuff possibly have

1101
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,960
similar types of requirements.

1102
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,440
Yeah.

1103
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,840
Just for fair competition, they'll wedge.

1104
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:32,440
Now Questbuster wants to point out in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog

1105
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:32,760
network.

1106
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:36,680
When it comes to the controller lawsuit, um, it does not appear to be patent

1107
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,880
trolls that are doing this.

1108
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,480
Um, it's saying not surprisingly, also surprisingly, excuse me, not patent

1109
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,520
troll that is suing.

1110
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,440
They actually make specialty controllers.

1111
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,720
They're part of the company that make the scuff controllers that go for nearly

1112
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,320
200 bucks on Amazon.

1113
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:53,240
So, um, it seems like, you know, unfortunately we hear a lot about patent

1114
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:53,960
trolls.

1115
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:56,760
Um, but this may be somebody that actually does have an interest in this

1116
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:01,240
yet again, kind of like Loki was saying these controllers have kind of come and

1117
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,360
gone anyway.

1118
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,040
So it's interesting.

1119
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,040
That's happening.

1120
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:06,200
Yeah.

1121
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,000
These interesting looking controllers there.

1122
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:09,240
Yeah.

1123
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:12,200
I like, I like the fancy designs that they have for them.

1124
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:12,600
Yeah.

1125
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,040
Those analog sticks look pretty nice.

1126
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,080
Why they're 200 bucks.

1127
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:15,320
Right.

1128
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:20,920
Well, I, you know, I want to say I've used something similar to this.

1129
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,920
Like they actually had, and I don't remember this as the same company, but I

1130
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:29,560
remember those types of little, uh, triggers that they had, but they had a

1131
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:30,600
long time ago.

1132
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:36,280
It was this thing you can like strap onto your, uh, Xbox controller.

1133
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:41,080
Cause I actually had one that I got as like a, a promo thing or something.

1134
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,200
And it was weird.

1135
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:45,560
Like you could basically just strap it on.

1136
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:49,640
It looks like this giant spider thing on top of your controller that adds like

1137
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:54,440
all these different buttons and stuff that you basically just pull and push

1138
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,880
different, uh, buttons on the actual controller, but they put them in

1139
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:58,840
different places.

1140
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:03,800
It was really weird, but yeah, it kind of looks like that, but I guess now

1141
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:08,440
they've refined it quite more than that's, you know, spider thing that was

1142
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,000
on there.

1143
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:09,240
Yeah.

1144
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,000
All right.

1145
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,560
Well, let's move on a few more stories for you guys before we get to the

1146
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,920
classic game of the week.

1147
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:19,400
And, uh, first let's talk about this because this is a story about a mod, um,

1148
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,360
that came out recently and it's, it's gone through a lot.

1149
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:26,680
Um, so this is a mod for fallout new Vegas that was really going to be

1150
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,600
transformative of the entire game.

1151
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:33,160
Um, fallout, the frontier is the name of this mod and it did release on January

1152
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:33,800
15th.

1153
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,080
And, uh, it was so popular when it first came out because again, this has been

1154
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,800
something that's been in development for a long time and a lot of people were

1155
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:40,920
involved with this.

1156
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:46,200
Um, you know, uh, doing, you know, fan art and, um, you know, all this stuff.

1157
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:52,280
So, um, anyhow, the mod came out, it crashed nexus mods because it got 82,000

1158
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,720
downloads the day it came out.

1159
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:59,800
And then, uh, a lot of stuff started coming out about it.

1160
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:06,040
Uh, in, in kind of most notably, I should say there was, uh, one of the mod

1161
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:12,280
developers got ejected from the team because of some pedophilic content that

1162
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,520
they had been, uh, posting you.

1163
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,320
Yeah, exactly.

1164
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:15,880
Big you.

1165
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,520
Right.

1166
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:21,160
Uh, and then a few hours after that, the entire mod was taken offline.

1167
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,080
So yeah, big you.

1168
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:26,280
And you know that that is gross and all that stuff.

1169
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,360
But as I mentioned earlier, there's all these people involved with a mod.

1170
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:30,840
Right.

1171
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:35,880
And so this person just basically sank the entire ship right now.

1172
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,000
I'm hearing a lot.

1173
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,760
I haven't played the mod myself.

1174
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,800
I'm hearing a lot of it is, um, there's some kind of strange content in there

1175
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,160
and I'm going to leave it at that.

1176
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:49,000
Um, some of it makes sense in the fallout universe.

1177
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,720
Some of it, like, um, you know, uh, the sex with the death claw doesn't

1178
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,760
necessarily make sense.

1179
01:01:54,760 --> 01:02:00,040
Um, but, uh, you know what, people do nude mods for games.

1180
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:03,480
So if people want to have sex with the death claw, okay, whatever, I guess.

1181
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:07,240
Uh, it also should be pointed out that the discord for this ended up getting

1182
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:10,040
raided by 4chan, which certainly didn't help.

1183
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:14,520
And now you've got all these people that were involved with the project that

1184
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:17,400
are getting docs and all this other stuff.

1185
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:22,760
And it's just, I don't, you know, like, again, no, no money was to, um, be made

1186
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:23,720
off this whole thing.

1187
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:28,520
So, um, I don't know what point they're going to make with that whole thing.

1188
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:32,280
I mean, yes, go after the guy that did the pedophilia, but I don't know.

1189
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,400
But again, I haven't played the mod myself, so I can't say much more than

1190
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:37,960
that.

1191
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:44,120
Uh, looking at chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, SSG100Matt says macho man

1192
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,000
death claws though.

1193
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,320
Oh yeah.

1194
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:48,920
So maybe they were just waiting for the mod to the mod that would turn the death

1195
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,120
claws into something else.

1196
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:50,680
I see.

1197
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,840
That was just forward thinking is what that was.

1198
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:53,480
I see.

1199
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:53,880
I see.

1200
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,960
Questbuster says they can party with the macho man dragons in Skyrim.

1201
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:58,920
Mm hmm.

1202
01:02:58,920 --> 01:02:59,480
All right.

1203
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,040
Ooh, yeah.

1204
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,320
Oh, yeah.

1205
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:02,360
All right.

1206
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:07,480
Anyway, um, you know, thoughts, thoughts to those that, you know, maybe got

1207
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:11,000
involved with the project that didn't know the type of people that were on the

1208
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:11,720
team.

1209
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,400
Um, that's unfortunate.

1210
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:14,280
All right.

1211
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,320
Moving on though, let's go to our next story.

1212
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:18,840
Uh, Dark Soccer, I think it's yours.

1213
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:19,960
All right.

1214
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:24,120
Well, I love Sega as has been proved with a chart recently.

1215
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,160
Thanks, Rob, for letting me know about that.

1216
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:35,080
Um, but anyway, um, Sega is going through a split, um, with its amusement and

1217
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,360
video game divisions.

1218
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:44,440
Um, it is definitely leading to some rumors that, uh, Sega may be in

1219
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,280
pre-acquisition mode, I guess.

1220
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:56,120
Um, so basically, um, those two divisions, um, are, uh, are basically being split

1221
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:56,360
again.

1222
01:03:56,360 --> 01:04:02,520
Like I said, um, the CCO, um, uh, Toshihiro Nagoshi is, uh, going to be creative

1223
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,840
director effective on April 1st.

1224
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,200
That ain't no joke y'all.

1225
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,480
Um, but they will remain under the ownership of Sega Sammy.

1226
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:15,880
Um, and the quote is that it's intended to accelerate global business development

1227
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:19,560
by streamlining their structure and accelerate decision-making.

1228
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:25,880
So they, the other mention on this is that it's intended to transform Sega's

1229
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:29,320
business structure to adapt to the external environment.

1230
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:35,560
But the rumor is still that they are in prime position to be acquired.

1231
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:38,680
Um, there are certainly rumors about Microsoft.

1232
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,360
There's even talk of Nintendo.

1233
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,720
Which if anyone was going to acquire Sega, I would want it to be Nintendo, which

1234
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,080
would be ironic.

1235
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,120
That would be super ironic.

1236
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,880
Yeah, that'd be interesting.

1237
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:50,280
Yeah.

1238
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:55,880
Like if I could time travel to, you know, high school me and go, Hey, guess what?

1239
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,160
Nintendo owns Sega.

1240
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:02,040
People would look at me like I, you know, suddenly grew three, three.

1241
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,880
I know it's, it's this ludicrous.

1242
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,760
It's the talk of, you know, Super Mario Brothers is going to come out for

1243
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:07,960
PlayStation five.

1244
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:12,280
Like the, the reaction you would have to that statement now is the reaction we

1245
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,400
would have had in college too.

1246
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:18,040
Nintendo is, uh, in talks to buy Sega rumor, you know, even, it's just like,

1247
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:18,760
no, they're, come on.

1248
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:19,480
That's ridiculous.

1249
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:27,880
Yeah, but it is, uh, not super ridiculous in today's understanding.

1250
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:28,520
So yeah.

1251
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:29,080
Yeah.

1252
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:34,520
Um, and it's just been the slow decline of Sega, you know, but, oh, actually,

1253
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,360
which reminds me of another game that I played, Rob.

1254
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:40,360
I played crazy taxi on my iPad and it had the full sound.

1255
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:41,560
I had the full soundtrack.

1256
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,060
Good.

1257
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:43,640
Yeah.

1258
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:47,080
So, and anyway, I don't know why I didn't think about it until just now, but

1259
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,280
Sega, Sega.

1260
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,400
Um, tiger con chat says, I don't know about that.

1261
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:55,000
If Nintendo owns Sega and Nintendo would shut down all these Sonic fan

1262
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,920
games and don't give them ideas.

1263
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:02,360
And there's, there's certainly been the rumors about Microsoft for a long

1264
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,000
time.

1265
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,240
And then fantasy star online agreement or a faster online to excuse me,

1266
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,360
agreement happened.

1267
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:09,880
And that just put fuel on the fire.

1268
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,400
So that would be an interesting one too.

1269
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,280
Wouldn't it?

1270
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:18,040
So yeah, yeah, I'd be very, I mean, I also am a big fan of Sega doing their

1271
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:18,520
own thing.

1272
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:22,200
I don't really like all these mega companies that are ending up, but if it

1273
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:25,240
has to be bought, it's going to be interesting either way that goes.

1274
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:28,280
If it isn't intent, I mean, I would rather see Sega go to a company like

1275
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:31,560
Microsoft or Nintendo than, um, Konami or EA.

1276
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:36,120
Oh, don't let, don't let EA do a hostile takeover of that one.

1277
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:41,320
I would rather see people leave some of the big companies just for the sake

1278
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,680
of building up Sega.

1279
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:43,320
Yeah.

1280
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,000
And make it a powerhouse again.

1281
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:51,320
That would be wishful thinking, but it would be nice, uh, pod culture and chat

1282
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:53,240
says, imagine the Nintendo Dreamcast.

1283
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,640
Hey, the Dreamcast mini could be a reality.

1284
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,640
I've already seen it.

1285
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:02,280
Remember when they, uh, they recompiled Mario 64 for the Dreamcast.

1286
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,320
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1287
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,080
It's already a thing.

1288
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:11,800
I'd love, I'd love that if, uh, even if Microsoft did it, that they would

1289
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,920
invest in some of those Sega properties again, it'd be amazing.

1290
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,360
All right, let's move on a few more stories for you.

1291
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:18,860
Loki.

1292
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:20,280
Yeah.

1293
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:24,040
So we just got an update for Animal Crossing because, you know, there's more

1294
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,800
holidays right around the corner.

1295
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,760
So there was an update on the 28th of January.

1296
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:32,280
That's supposed to be prepping us for Valentine's day game day,

1297
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:35,000
Groundhog day and FestiVale.

1298
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:40,840
And FestiVale, well, it's spelled FestiVale.

1299
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:41,400
Okay.

1300
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,480
So welcome to FestiVale.

1301
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:46,840
Except that it's, it's a foreign word.

1302
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:47,340
So.

1303
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:48,360
Fine.

1304
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:48,920
Whatever.

1305
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:49,480
I don't care.

1306
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:53,240
They've got the twerking, uh, peacock there, you know, whatever you want to call it.

1307
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:53,880
It doesn't matter.

1308
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:55,880
Peacock festival.

1309
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:56,200
Yes.

1310
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:56,700
Pave.

1311
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:57,740
Pave.

1312
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:02,120
Um, so that's going to be, I heard his name was Gay Rights.

1313
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,920
Cause that's all I've heard about this event is that it's Gay Rights.

1314
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:09,080
I love Pave.

1315
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:11,720
I haven't seen the event yet.

1316
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:14,120
I am starting, uh, starting tomorrow.

1317
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:18,040
They're going to have a brand new set of outfits that are going to be available

1318
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:22,360
and new reactions, including feeling it.

1319
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:24,600
Let's go Viva and confetti.

1320
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,080
That'd be fun.

1321
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:27,960
Confetti would be fun.

1322
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:28,460
Yeah.

1323
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:29,260
Yeah.

1324
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:35,320
And, um, yeah, so lots of new stuff I've been trying to get my, well, um, my wife's been

1325
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:40,440
trying to get my son to play it because I know that's my cat.

1326
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:41,880
Hi Stella.

1327
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:44,520
She's being loud.

1328
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,080
She knows that.

1329
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,760
Um, what do you want?

1330
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:52,520
Um, so anyways, yeah, new holiday stuff.

1331
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:56,120
I'm still waiting for March when we're supposed to get that, the Nintendo stuff.

1332
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:58,120
That's really the only thing I'm interested in.

1333
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,160
I think that's coming up later.

1334
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:03,320
If anyone wants to know right now, you seasonal items are out.

1335
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:09,720
Um, they do have like a football rug and a glittery megaphone, I guess for the

1336
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:10,440
stupor bowl.

1337
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:16,440
Um, and then there's also the sets of Boon, uh, set where you throw out the beans for

1338
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:17,480
sets of Boon.

1339
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,480
So all right.

1340
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:19,960
Pretty cool.

1341
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:22,440
I like that we actually get all the international stuff.

1342
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:27,960
Yeah, that is nice that we, it's not like locked to certain countries or whatever.

1343
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:32,760
So yes, for those that are watching live, unfortunately it doesn't translate well into

1344
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:37,960
the podcast, but Loki picked up the kitty and now the kitty just meow right in the mic.

1345
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,240
She sure did.

1346
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:49,240
Well, this where every kitty has a voice, I'd rather hear what that cat has to say than

1347
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:50,120
some Twitter users.

1348
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:50,680
That's for sure.

1349
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,240
Probably a better opinion too.

1350
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:54,280
All right.

1351
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:55,320
All right.

1352
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,400
What is your stance on cat food?

1353
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,200
I'm for it.

1354
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,600
All right, let's move on.

1355
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:07,880
Uh, while Loki takes a minute to cuddle Stella there, uh, let's talk about Plex, the movie

1356
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,920
company getting into gaming a little bit.

1357
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:16,760
Uh, Plex is getting into a arcade service that they, I guess, unofficially launched this

1358
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,680
week with some old school games.

1359
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:21,320
So Plex is a media streaming service right now.

1360
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,280
I think I've heard of this, but I can't say I've used it before.

1361
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:28,200
Uh, and they do like TV and movies and audio and photos and things like that.

1362
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:31,400
And now as of this week, they do Atari games.

1363
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:38,680
If you subscribe to Plex arcade, you get Atari classics such as asteroids, missile command,

1364
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:39,400
centipede.

1365
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,560
There actually does appear to be a lot of them in here.

1366
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,960
I'm just kind of looking through some of the screenshots.

1367
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:46,120
A lot of the Atari classics are in there.

1368
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,080
First party stuff.

1369
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,400
You're not going to see the Activision stuff in there, like pitfall.

1370
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:53,640
Um, and because that was, those are Activision games, just the first party Atari stuff.

1371
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:57,240
Um, but they have stuff like I can see the 7,800 poking through where they have like

1372
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,160
Ninja golf is actually there.

1373
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,960
And I'm like, Oh dang, this is, those are some deep cuts in there.

1374
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:08,280
Um, anyhow, you can stream the games, uh, with Android, uh, to Android mobile or TV,

1375
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:13,880
iOS, or TV, iOS, or any Chrome browser and any Bluetooth controller will allow you to

1376
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:14,200
play them.

1377
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:19,400
But what's interesting about this, the Plex thing, which is either $3 a month, if you're

1378
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:26,920
already a Plex Pass owner or $5 a month, if you don't have that, um, you, uh, can actually

1379
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:29,560
load your own ROMs onto this.

1380
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:37,000
And so that's the part that made me go, cause at first I'm like, okay, another company's

1381
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,440
getting into retro gaming, whatever.

1382
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:39,400
But then I was like, wait a minute.

1383
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:44,840
They actually going to allow you to load your own ROMs and even like emulators into the

1384
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:45,800
library.

1385
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,480
That's the part where I'm like, and they're, they're paying you to do it, or I'm sorry,

1386
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:52,120
you're paying them for the privilege to do it.

1387
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,320
That part's very interesting.

1388
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:59,880
But I guess because Plex is a server type of thing, it's just the ease of playing it

1389
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:04,280
on your TV as opposed to, I don't know, having to set up a Raspberry Pi or whatever.

1390
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:08,200
And then you are legally getting all these Atari licenses with that.

1391
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,680
So that part's kind of interesting.

1392
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:16,600
So, um, pod culture in chat says, uh, Zen, you are nuts.

1393
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,760
Plex works just fine and looks okay.

1394
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:19,720
Well, what did Zen say?

1395
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:24,600
Oh, Zen says, Plex has an awful UI that barely works half the time and now they want to stream

1396
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,160
games.

1397
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:25,880
No, thank you.

1398
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:29,880
Uh, Darkdude Studio says, the concept is neat, but I hear there's a lot of lag when you're

1399
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:32,040
streaming, at least in the demo I saw from YouTube.

1400
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:34,840
And Bexobaka says the games suffer from lag.

1401
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,200
So, all right.

1402
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:36,760
Hmm.

1403
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,920
Why can't someone just bring back game room?

1404
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:40,280
Yeah, right?

1405
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:43,960
Seriously, like why would that be so difficult?

1406
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:47,000
Like you would think that someone would be able to come up with the same concept that's

1407
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,920
just like, okay, hey, yeah.

1408
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:53,560
I have an arcade with stuff in it and, you know, I can outfit it with games that you

1409
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,160
can play and stuff like that.

1410
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:55,960
I don't know.

1411
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:57,720
I have Antstream, which is pretty good.

1412
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:02,920
Um, it's a lot of, uh, Commodore and Spectrum games and they're starting to get some Atari

1413
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:03,560
games in it.

1414
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:05,480
Um, disclosure, I back their Kickstarter.

1415
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:06,600
That's why I'm still in it.

1416
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,360
Cause I'm in my second year at this point.

1417
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,680
I think my sub will finally run out this summer.

1418
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:13,880
Um, I wish they'd get the client on Xbox series X though.

1419
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,800
They only have it on Xbox one.

1420
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:18,840
So it's weird to me that it's not on series X, but for whatever reason, it's not.

1421
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:22,760
It's on PC as well, but it all, it streams everything.

1422
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,200
Like it's, it's cloud gaming.

1423
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:29,640
It's basically stadia, but since it's all classic games, there's very little bandwidth

1424
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:32,680
actually being used because the resolution isn't that great.

1425
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:33,000
Yeah.

1426
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,600
And no, actually there's a little bit of artifacting sometimes, but for the most part, especially

1427
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:41,720
in regards to being responsive and stuff, the game's fine.

1428
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:45,800
They just added, um, classic Mortal Kombat not that long ago, like the original arcade

1429
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,560
Mortal Kombat that kind of surprised me.

1430
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,080
So there was that.

1431
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:49,800
All right.

1432
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:54,520
Well, speaking of classic arcades, let's visit the classic game of the week.

1433
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:00,760
Every week, dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, Hey,

1434
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:03,160
you brats, you should check this game out.

1435
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:06,200
Uh, load this onto your Plex server.

1436
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:11,480
Although this one might be a little bit difficult and this one, this is also, uh, one of those

1437
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,720
choices, I think for its uniqueness.

1438
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,200
Um, but I guess I should let dark soccer speak to that.

1439
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,360
So dark soccer brought this up in the past.

1440
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:18,760
You have.

1441
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:23,880
So what is the classic game of the week, which might take a second for the B roll to appear

1442
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,320
as I think I forgot to preload it.

1443
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:26,440
Sorry, but it'll come right up.

1444
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:31,080
Well, well, not that there's really a lot going on on that video.

1445
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,560
I believe I linked to the Dreamcast one.

1446
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,120
You did.

1447
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:40,200
Um, cause the Saturn has no video, but the game is real sound cause they know regret

1448
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,040
or wind of regret.

1449
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:47,000
Um, it was an audio adventure game that was developed by warp.

1450
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,080
It was first released on the Sega Saturn in July, 1997.

1451
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:59,640
And later on the Dreamcast in 1999, real sound was supposed to provide equal access for sighted

1452
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:00,840
and blind players.

1453
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:09,160
Um, so, um, to go actually a little bit more itself, um, warp's president, uh, uh, Kenji

1454
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:16,600
created the game after, uh, getting appreciation letters from, uh, blind fans of his games

1455
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:17,560
in Japan.

1456
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:23,000
And he was thinking that it would be great to have visually disabled fans have games

1457
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,720
that would be rich and involved that they could play and get into.

1458
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:30,200
I'm actually going to read a quote from 2008.

1459
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,640
Um, and an interview with one up.

1460
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:36,360
I had a chance to visit people who are visually disabled and I learned that there are blind

1461
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,040
people who play action games.

1462
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:42,200
Of course, they're not able to have the full experience and they're kind of trying to force

1463
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,480
themselves to be able to play, but they're making the effort.

1464
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:50,680
So I thought that if you turn off the monitor, both, both of you are hearing the same game.

1465
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:54,360
So after you finish the game, you can have an equal conversation about it with blind

1466
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,080
person.

1467
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:58,760
That was the inspiration behind real sound cause I know regret as well.

1468
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:04,280
So, um, he was really excited about it and he really pushed.

1469
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:08,360
So, uh, and, and really a bargaining, uh, thing with Sega.

1470
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:12,120
So, uh, he did that in exchange for exclusive rights to the game.

1471
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:16,680
So they would donate a thousand Sega Saturn consoles to visually impaired people.

1472
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:22,760
Um, and he also personally downloaded, uh, donated, sorry, a thousand copies of the game

1473
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,960
along with the consoles.

1474
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:30,840
Um, and it's only been re-released once, but he said that it has to do with that deal he

1475
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,840
has with, uh, with Sega.

1476
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:39,320
Um, he's, he's basically, it was the only thing that was limiting it that could only

1477
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:41,000
be released on a Sega console.

1478
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:49,800
So, um, it has, uh, actually pretty good voice cast in it, including, um, a really popular

1479
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,120
drama actress, uh, Miho Kanno.

1480
01:16:52,600 --> 01:17:01,320
Um, Ai Maeda who has done some amazing voice acting, um, got, uh, actually a really good

1481
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:03,720
composer, Keiichi Suzuki.

1482
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:07,880
Um, he did, uh, uh, the blind swordsman, Datoichi and outrage.

1483
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:11,080
Um, Aki Koyano did the ending theme.

1484
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:19,160
Um, and the game was actually written by, uh, a, uh, a screenwriter, uh, Yuji Sakamoto,

1485
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:22,840
um, really, really talented group of people that worked on it.

1486
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:33,160
So basically, um, the plot is about central elements, fear and love in a story in Tokyo.

1487
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:37,960
So, uh, there's an elementary student is moved to a new school where she has to join new

1488
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,560
students and seated next to a boy.

1489
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:45,880
Um, the two fall in love, but, and they're really young and they want to elope and they

1490
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:51,960
arranged to meet at the clock tower, but, um, the girl Izumi never shows up as she's transferred

1491
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:55,800
away and then they meet again as college students.

1492
01:17:56,680 --> 01:18:01,560
And so, um, they're dealing then with a mystery that has to do with the disappearance.

1493
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,760
And so that's leading into the story of the game.

1494
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:12,280
Um, and there are, by the way, translations, uh, online, um, for, uh, you can read.

1495
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:19,160
Um, but it basically, um, there is a version, the Dreamcast one, uh, specifically that has

1496
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:27,880
a visual mode that, um, it gives you like a little bit of extra, you know, scenery with

1497
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:33,320
the game, but they both games still exclusively rely on the audio portions of the game.

1498
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:37,800
Um, the, yeah, the Dreamcast visual mode is just really non-essential.

1499
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,000
Um, and it's constructed as an interactive radio drama.

1500
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:47,640
Um, so you're basically listening to the story as it unfolds and you have different forks

1501
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:52,200
in your plot line and you get a chime and that you have to choose the course that the

1502
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:53,160
plot will take.

1503
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:57,800
Um, once you've confirmed your choice, then the plot resumes.

1504
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,520
So it's actually a choose your own adventure kind of story.

1505
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:04,600
Um, very, very unique.

1506
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:12,360
Um, so, um, going further into it, the game really didn't sell very well.

1507
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:18,920
Um, but it's really now considered, um, a collector's item because of Ena's other titles.

1508
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:28,280
Um, they're, um, one of the cool things about this, especially for the collect, uh,

1509
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:34,520
the collectability of it is that you get, um, like different, uh, instructions.

1510
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:41,400
Like for example, in braille and you get seeds, a bag of herb seeds as they're listed, um,

1511
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,720
and a transparent box of the cloud motif.

1512
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:50,760
Um, I, I know someone who had, who had the seeds and that was what I brought up before.

1513
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:53,000
You were talking about things that come with games.

1514
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:53,500
Yeah.

1515
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,880
You know, you could get a bag of seeds.

1516
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:04,520
So, um, so a version of this game with only one path, um, errored, uh, on, uh, a Tokyo

1517
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:11,720
FM in 1997, um, and then there were other games of his that were actually released by

1518
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,240
Real Sound's gameplay.

1519
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:20,200
For example, um, for Enemy Zero that came out in 97 on Saturn, there were enemies that

1520
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:23,000
were invisible and could only be located by sound.

1521
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:30,200
And D2, another of his games, 2000 on Dreamcast, uh, really drew from the limitations to your

1522
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,640
sensory perceptions.

1523
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:36,200
So there are portions of the game where the character is rendered blind with only a voice

1524
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,400
to guide her.

1525
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:42,920
And alternatively, she, uh, another mode, death, where she only has her vision to guide

1526
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:43,420
her.

1527
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:49,960
There was a sequel, um, that was planned called Kiri no Orge.

1528
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:56,760
Um, it was in development to be the second game and it was going to, uh, there was, I

1529
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,040
can't make words happen.

1530
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,560
It was going to be a horror theme.

1531
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:06,360
Um, and they had, uh, ads for it in various magazines, but the couldn't really do to voice

1532
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,960
compression technology.

1533
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:17,240
Some of the story, uh, arcs, um, uh, Kiri no Orge were, uh, put into D2, um, and then

1534
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:22,760
into another game called, uh, well, there was actually going to be another installment

1535
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:26,360
in the series called Spy Lunch, but that of course never developed.

1536
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:33,800
So, um, but this game, um, is still actually popular amongst the visually disabled.

1537
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:40,520
Um, and I really wanted to outline something that it, that was made specifically with that

1538
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:41,560
community in mind.

1539
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:48,440
You know, there are gamers all across the ability scale one way or another.

1540
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:52,920
We, we have listeners of our show who are legally blind.

1541
01:21:53,640 --> 01:22:01,800
Um, and I think that it's great that there was a game that was released specifically

1542
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:06,280
for those people and people in chat are talking about Plex and not listening, I guess, but,

1543
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:08,600
uh, we're having some frame drops as well.

1544
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,600
So it might not just be because of that.

1545
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:11,900
Okay.

1546
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:18,200
At any rate, I felt this game kind of was very important to me that we mentioned it

1547
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:25,800
just simply because, I mean, we have such an A-list designer who was thinking of a

1548
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:30,840
community that is so often left out of the gaming conversation.

1549
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:39,720
And I wish that more, um, more developers would have different things.

1550
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:45,560
Like for example, say that, you know, for certain levels of, uh, the visually impaired,

1551
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,240
you have like a high contrast mode.

1552
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:49,160
Right.

1553
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:49,660
Right.

1554
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:53,320
Well, and Last of Us Part II had a lot of this type of stuff, which was great.

1555
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:54,440
Exactly.

1556
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:54,940
Exactly.

1557
01:22:55,480 --> 01:23:02,280
But I think that, that there needs to be, um, there needs to be more games that are created

1558
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:06,200
with our other ability communities in mind.

1559
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:12,280
I'm going to bring it back to the main shot of us away from the, uh, footage, just because

1560
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:13,960
I want to see if that fixes some of our issues.

1561
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:14,680
I might not.

1562
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:17,960
Sorry, we're, we're getting internet drops that are kind of out of my control.

1563
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,000
I don't know what the hell's going on.

1564
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:19,500
Sorry.

1565
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:20,360
All right.

1566
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:27,000
Well, at any rate, I would have really liked to have had, um, the other stories come out.

1567
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:32,040
Um, I, it just, to me just seems so fun to have like a drama that you can play.

1568
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:36,840
Of course, my comprehension, um, when, when I almost bought a copy of the game, but my

1569
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:40,040
comprehension was not where it needed to be to play it properly.

1570
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:40,680
Right.

1571
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:44,600
So, um, I wonder if I would be able to go back and play it now.

1572
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:45,900
Maybe not.

1573
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:50,520
Um, I was just to say the vibe I kind of get from the game, you know, even though it's,

1574
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:55,960
um, very light on the graphics, because obviously it's, it's with a different medium in mind.

1575
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,080
Well, the Saturn had none.

1576
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:03,240
I, well, I, but I still get that vibe of, um, like an old CD-ROM game that, you know,

1577
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:08,040
you kind of have those very like photographic quality visuals, but they were very simple.

1578
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:08,700
Like Myst?

1579
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:15,480
I, in a way, I guess, but, um, even more like photo, Myst wasn't really photo realistic.

1580
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:19,080
Whereas like, you know, the game we were looking at here was very photo realistic in a way.

1581
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:23,640
Um, I think it's, it's kind of neat because it's just that early CD-ROM technology really

1582
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,800
tried to like, Ooh, make it look real.

1583
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:29,720
You know, I'd almost say in a way, like, I don't know, something like Phantasmagoria,

1584
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:29,960
right.

1585
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,320
It was like real people.

1586
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,840
Phantasmagoria was great.

1587
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:33,080
Right.

1588
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:39,320
And like a real scene and all this stuff, you know, even though it was all cheesy B

1589
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:43,640
community theater, uh, special effects still, you know, that game was kind of legendary

1590
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:44,280
for all of that.

1591
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:47,960
And I think, you know, this game that you just showed us kind of, you know, it still

1592
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:52,600
has that photo realism, obviously just to try, try to invoke images, probably of the

1593
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:58,760
story that's being told, but, you know, even for, I, cause unfortunately I think sometimes

1594
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,000
people hear this, you know, this is true.

1595
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,920
People hear, Oh, this is a game made for a certain audience.

1596
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,800
And if that audience isn't them, then they're like, ah, then what's here for me?

1597
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:08,760
Nothing, you know?

1598
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:09,880
And they skip over it.

1599
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:10,520
Right.

1600
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:13,960
But like, this seems like the type of thing that like could actually just be totally meant

1601
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:16,440
to like, you kind of have playing on the TV or whatever.

1602
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:19,640
And you're just chilling on the couch, kind of laying back, eyes closed.

1603
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:21,080
You don't even have to look at the game.

1604
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:23,320
You can experience the media in a different way.

1605
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:28,120
And so it's like, sometimes it's about broadening the way you consume things, which I think

1606
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:28,680
is interesting.

1607
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:34,920
Well, and the thing, the thing is that there are very few games that are just audio only.

1608
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:40,920
Another one that comes to mind is Papa Sangre, which actually just got, it got a sequel in

1609
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:44,840
2013, but it's a horror themed audio game that came out on iOS.

1610
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:51,160
So there's, there's a few other ones.

1611
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:57,400
Like there's also Chillingham is another one that came out in 2004, but I picked this one

1612
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:05,080
in particular simply because it, it was one of the big games that really put a lot of

1613
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:06,920
focus on it in Japan.

1614
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,080
It's a damn shame we never got a version of it here.

1615
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:16,040
I think that that certainly or at least had other language releases in general, because

1616
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,800
I think a lot of people would have benefited from it.

1617
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:21,000
Well, and there was really nothing like it on the Dreamcast or the Saturn, you know,

1618
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,360
but I say I call it Dreamcast specifically because the Dreamcast was always that weird

1619
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:25,800
system, you know?

1620
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:31,880
And then here was another off the track of usual stuff thing that it tried.

1621
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:35,080
And, you know, just, I bet a lot of people didn't even know this existed.

1622
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:44,760
But it's, it's definitely one of those more interesting games and hopefully my goal is,

1623
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:50,280
this might sound like a little odd goal, but I would like to one day have my listening

1624
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,360
comprehension be good enough to play this game.

1625
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:53,560
All right.

1626
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:54,760
Yep.

1627
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:55,480
So there you go.

1628
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:55,880
Well, thank you.

1629
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,800
Real sounds cause a no regret.

1630
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:58,280
Okay.

1631
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,360
Your classic game of the week.

1632
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:04,600
Very, I honestly, I thought I've heard of them all, but I did not hear of this game

1633
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,440
until looking at it for tonight's show.

1634
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:07,240
So very cool.

1635
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,720
Well, I did tell you about it, about the seeds.

1636
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:11,400
You did, but you tell me about a lot of games.

1637
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:17,720
This is the first time I've actually like seen it, you know, and gotten to, you know,

1638
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:18,360
check it out.

1639
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:21,720
So wait till you see the fucking weird game I picked for next month.

1640
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:22,040
All right.

1641
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:22,440
Can't wait.

1642
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:22,760
Oh yeah.

1643
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:24,200
Cause we're still in January.

1644
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:27,720
We're still in, it's like, there's a lot of five episodes in January this month.

1645
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:31,480
I already have next week's regular game picked out, but the week after is going to be the

1646
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:32,040
weirdo.

1647
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,000
Oh, perfect.

1648
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,760
That'll be just in time for Valentine's day.

1649
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:35,960
So perfect.

1650
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:36,600
Well, yeah.

1651
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:41,400
Then, you know, uh, when I, I'll tell you what it is early, Robin, you'll laugh your

1652
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:41,800
face off.

1653
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:42,120
So, okay.

1654
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:44,760
Well, obviously not now don't ruin it for the listeners, but tell me later, text it

1655
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:45,400
or something.

1656
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:50,200
Um, the, uh, well, yes, there, there is that little football game on TV next week.

1657
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,600
Although that's never stopped us before.

1658
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,920
Um, not going to stop us from doing the show.

1659
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:58,600
And I said, did you pick something themed with the football game?

1660
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:00,600
Is that why you already know next week?

1661
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:01,000
Excuse me.

1662
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:01,480
Nope.

1663
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:01,960
Oh, okay.

1664
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:02,600
I was curious.

1665
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:04,120
All right.

1666
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:06,280
Let's move on.

1667
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:10,440
Let's talk about, I was, I was usually, I don't, the only thing I care about with those

1668
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:12,920
games, the commercials are kind of neat sometimes.

1669
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:16,120
And I did see, cause y'all posted about it in discord.

1670
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:19,720
I saw that whole like Wayne's world is coming back.

1671
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:23,400
Like they actually have Mike Meyers and Dana Carvey doing a Wayne's world for, I guess

1672
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:30,440
it's Uber eats who also had, you know, um, uh, I keep wanting to say Jean-Luc Picard,

1673
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:31,000
but that's not his name.

1674
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:36,840
Patrick Stewart and, um, Skywalker, Mark Hamill, Mark Hamill.

1675
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:39,080
We're in a commercial together for Uber eats.

1676
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:41,720
So they've been getting, getting, paying a lot of, uh, big celebrities.

1677
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:44,680
So they got Mike Meyers and Dana Carvey to reunite and do Wayne's world.

1678
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:46,440
So I guess that's a commercial for the super bowl.

1679
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:47,880
So that, that's kind of neat.

1680
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:52,040
I guess I like the commercial sometimes, but you can see them all online the day before

1681
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:52,840
the day after.

1682
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:53,640
Easy, easy.

1683
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:58,120
And then usually about the puppy bowl, usually the puppy bowl and the kitty half time, which

1684
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:01,960
aren't Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg doing it this year or something.

1685
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:06,040
Somebody posted something discord about like Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg are doing the

1686
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:06,520
animal bowl.

1687
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:08,280
Snoop is trending on Twitter right now.

1688
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:09,320
Huh?

1689
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:12,200
Chad, I think it's for the Super Bowl.

1690
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:12,760
All right.

1691
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:13,800
The superb owl.

1692
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:17,800
And then, um, the other thing I usually care about is the halftime show.

1693
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:23,800
Like when Beyonce did the halftime show life when lady Gaga did the halftime show life

1694
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:26,120
when Beyonce did the halftime show again.

1695
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:29,080
Uh, but she just snuck in there as part of Coldplay life.

1696
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:30,760
Like it was, it was great.

1697
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:33,560
Um, I think this year they have the weekend doing it.

1698
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:36,280
Um, who I actually don't even care about the halftime show.

1699
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:38,120
I like, well, I like, I like his stuff.

1700
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:39,480
I'd be curious to see how it comes out.

1701
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:41,560
I think I love the, uh, Cynthia vibe.

1702
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:45,160
A lot of his songs have, he has a very like old school, Michael Jackson sound to him,

1703
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:46,200
which I really dig.

1704
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:49,400
Um, but, uh, I think he has a ton of guest stars too.

1705
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:50,600
I don't think it's just him.

1706
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:53,320
Let me be curious to see how that turns out, but, uh, yeah.

1707
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:54,680
Anyway.

1708
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:56,280
All right.

1709
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:57,160
Moving on.

1710
01:29:57,160 --> 01:30:00,360
Let's get into some rapid fire news.

1711
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:04,280
Uh, Loki, let's, uh, start us off with some quick stories.

1712
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:05,080
Loki, Loki.

1713
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:05,480
Yeah.

1714
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:08,760
So we talked a little bit last week about what the games for gold for February are going

1715
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:11,480
to be, but now let's talk about PlayStation plus.

1716
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:15,000
So for PlayStation five, we've got destruction all stars.

1717
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:20,120
And then we have on PlayStation four control ultimate edition, which is also on PS five

1718
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:23,080
and concrete genie, all pretty solid titles actually.

1719
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:25,000
So that's going to be for February.

1720
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:34,280
And then we got news that there's a, there was a baseball, um, game that's, you know,

1721
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:40,840
all, uh, you know, uh, NBA jam or, um, what was it NFL?

1722
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:43,320
Uh, I can't remember the NFL one.

1723
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:44,520
Anyways, NFL blitz.

1724
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:45,240
That's right.

1725
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:50,680
And so they had a game coming or that was being worked on called power at baseball.

1726
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:55,960
And it was developed in the mid nineties by Midway and incredible technologies.

1727
01:30:55,960 --> 01:31:01,960
Of course it never actually came out, but because, uh, the video game history foundation

1728
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:03,080
is awesome.

1729
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:08,680
You can actually play a ROM of it on Mame and check out the game itself.

1730
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:10,680
So that is pretty cool.

1731
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:17,000
And I don't know, it just never came out because I guess, I don't know.

1732
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:23,320
They maybe thought that they didn't translate as well as say NBA jam or NFL.

1733
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:25,960
Maybe the licensing didn't come through for some of the people.

1734
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:27,320
I bet that could be an issue too.

1735
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:33,240
So, but yeah, it looks pretty cool and get a chance to play something that, you know,

1736
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:33,800
could have been.

1737
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:34,600
Yeah.

1738
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:39,640
Um, and a shout out cause Jason who, you know, does all our voiceovers and did an amazing

1739
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:41,080
job with the intro as always.

1740
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:47,320
Um, Jason talked about, um, some other alternative, like actiony baseball type of games, uh, that

1741
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:48,760
did come out like baseball stars.

1742
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:49,480
I remember that one.

1743
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:51,000
And that's, that's a great one as well.

1744
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:51,400
So yeah.

1745
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:52,760
That on Neo Geo.

1746
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:53,160
Yeah.

1747
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:55,080
Well, there was a version on NES, believe it or not.

1748
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:56,040
Yeah.

1749
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:56,520
I know.

1750
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:57,000
Yeah.

1751
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,880
So yeah, but it's probably better known for Neo Geo for sure, but yeah.

1752
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,120
Uh, all right, moving on.

1753
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:07,800
Uh, let's talk about destiny two, which destiny two is going to be changing up the way it

1754
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,320
does rewards a little bit.

1755
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,320
There will no longer be weekly bounties.

1756
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:15,800
They're going to go to seasonal, seasonal challenges to try to make things feel a little

1757
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:17,320
less grindy, I guess.

1758
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:20,920
Um, so that is what you can do now.

1759
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:25,800
So there's some goals, uh, that bungee went through and how to make the game more fun.

1760
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:30,360
Uh, in, in, in other words, provide a guide to new returning and veteran players for what

1761
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:34,520
to do today or this week guide the player through the seasonal content week over week,

1762
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:38,920
encourage players to engage with complexities and nuances of the seasonal activity and rituals

1763
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:43,320
and reduce the penalties on XP and bright dust for missing a giver given week.

1764
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:46,600
So they've done a seasonal challenges now that you do objectives.

1765
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:51,480
And you can do objectives during the week, but you have until the end of the season really

1766
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:52,520
to complete them.

1767
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:54,520
Um, not just that one week period.

1768
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:57,640
So, um, you know, you see a lot of games doing seasonal things.

1769
01:32:57,640 --> 01:32:59,960
So destiny two going that direction makes sense.

1770
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:02,760
Um, I have been playing that a little bit on series X.

1771
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:04,600
I haven't played in the last week or two.

1772
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:06,840
Um, but it's a real pretty game.

1773
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:09,160
They, they definitely souped it up for series X.

1774
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:10,600
It looks real good.

1775
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:12,120
So I should play some more of that.

1776
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:12,760
That's for sure.

1777
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:16,200
And man, I wish they had something like this when I was younger.

1778
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:22,360
Um, Lego just put out their own type of app that is for music video making for kids.

1779
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:28,440
It's called video, but it's V I D I Y O video.

1780
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:30,360
That's basically what it is.

1781
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:35,000
So this is a app that allows kids to make their own music videos.

1782
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,560
Um, when you have certain, of course, Lego figures and blocks, you scan them into the

1783
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:43,880
app and it makes the characters go into song and dance with AR.

1784
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:48,280
And then of course, because it's all AR, you can choose where you want to put the

1785
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:51,880
characters in the real world and then kind of, you know, use your camera to shoot them

1786
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:52,680
a little bit.

1787
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:57,240
Um, some of the music comes from universal music groups, uh, pop roster, and there are

1788
01:33:57,240 --> 01:34:00,840
60 seconds samples, so they don't put the whole songs in there, but you can make a little

1789
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:01,960
bit of a sample there.

1790
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:03,160
And I think that's really cute.

1791
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:06,680
Like, you know, get kids, you know, making their own movies when they're young.

1792
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:07,720
I think that's pretty cool.

1793
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:09,960
And a good use of that AR technology.

1794
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:13,080
Interesting to see Lego doing that again, because of course, you know, we talked a lot

1795
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:18,120
about the Mario Legos they've done, um, towards the end of last year, and that used a lot

1796
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:19,720
of interesting technology as well.

1797
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:23,320
So Legos really pushing the envelope y'all.

1798
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:24,440
All right.

1799
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:29,560
They've also got, well, aside from that, they have their stop motion studio thing that they

1800
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:32,920
had a set that you could use your phone to do that.

1801
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:35,400
Um, they've been pushing stuff with unity.

1802
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:41,480
They have their whole Lego, uh, you know, I guess not really a tutorial, but it's kind

1803
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:43,560
of like a kit that you can create stuff with.

1804
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:47,320
So yeah, they've been doing a lot of stuff with like gaming involved.

1805
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:49,960
All right.

1806
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:51,320
Well, let's move on to our Sakura.

1807
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:56,600
Of course, animal crossing happiness.

1808
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:00,360
I was so thrilled when I saw this, even though I pretty much already have the cards.

1809
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:05,080
Um, but, uh, they are doing the Sanrio amiibo cards.

1810
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:12,120
They're coming out at target, um, exclusively at target on March 26th.

1811
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:16,360
Um, they are, uh, six different cards.

1812
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:23,960
Um, these were actually, um, put out for the, uh, welcome amiibo edition of, uh, animal

1813
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:24,840
crossing new leaf.

1814
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:31,320
Um, so you get Rila, who is the hello kitty gorilla, who's kind of creepy.

1815
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:33,160
You get Marty, huh?

1816
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:33,880
I was just laughing.

1817
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:34,840
Oh yeah.

1818
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:41,320
You get Marty, who is the, um, a yellow pom pom pudding, um, character.

1819
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:43,320
You have Chai who is so cute.

1820
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:46,760
She's an elephant with a teacup on her head and she's for pom pom pudding.

1821
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:49,400
Chelsea is, uh, my melody.

1822
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:55,240
Toby is, I actually really liked his set in, uh, in pocket camp too.

1823
01:35:55,240 --> 01:36:01,240
And who is, uh, little twin stars, which little twin stars is my favorite Sanrio group.

1824
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:08,680
What I don't see on here though, is if you're going to be able to welcome the characters.

1825
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:17,000
Um, it says right here that it's only going to be to unlock the in-game posters, which

1826
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:23,880
I mean, I already have, but, um, I'm really hoping that they put out a patch to give us

1827
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:31,320
those animals, because it would be nice to, for me to have Etoile in my, uh, in my village.

1828
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:31,480
Yeah.

1829
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:32,840
That's what I was hopeful about too.

1830
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:37,480
But then I guess, you know, if these cards have existed in Japan already, since the game's

1831
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:40,120
launched, then if the characters were going to be there, they'd be there.

1832
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:45,000
But I, I, I still am crossing my fingers and toes that maybe with the, uh, unveiling of

1833
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,840
the cards officially in the U S maybe they'll patch the game and add the villagers and then

1834
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:49,960
Japan can enjoy that too.

1835
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:53,880
Cause they, I imagine either they have the cards accessible or they, they could do a

1836
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:55,000
reprint pretty easily.

1837
01:36:55,640 --> 01:37:01,160
Well, and on top of that, um, if you've still, if you still have new leaf, then you can get

1838
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:01,800
the characters there.

1839
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:02,280
I reckon.

1840
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:07,080
Well, it says they also have furniture in new leaf as well.

1841
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:10,120
Well, yeah, that was the point of them.

1842
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:12,680
They brought in a different furniture sets.

1843
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:15,720
Those furniture sets are cute too.

1844
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:18,360
I want them in, uh, in, uh, the new one.

1845
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:20,040
Like why pocket camp?

1846
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:25,560
And I had like all of, um, stuff and Toby's the set.

1847
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:26,060
Yeah.

1848
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:28,520
The set was like ultra Japanese.

1849
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:29,160
It was so cute.

1850
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:32,600
But why restrict it to the 3d S version of the game?

1851
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:37,320
That's so old, but I guess, you know, because they were made for the 3d S version.

1852
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:43,480
No, but the amiibos were made for certain things and then they, uh, use them in later

1853
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:43,800
games.

1854
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:46,360
Like most amiibo were for smash brothers.

1855
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:47,000
Right.

1856
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:53,240
There's a, there are a lot of animal crossing characters who I have a physical amiibo for,

1857
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:57,080
and I have their cards that the character is not in the game.

1858
01:37:57,080 --> 01:38:03,000
Like, remember I had my Pascal poster before I could get a picture with Pascal before his

1859
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:03,640
model was out.

1860
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:05,720
I had the pave poster.

1861
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:07,240
I sent you the pave poster.

1862
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:08,920
Yes, I have the pave poster.

1863
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:13,400
And now I can get pave in my studio, you know, because I have the card, but like you can't

1864
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:16,280
get, um, uh, chip.

1865
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:25,400
You can't get porter or Booker and copper or, uh, well for a while you couldn't get

1866
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:28,760
the llamas and then they did their little wedding thing and then you could get them.

1867
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:34,200
Um, but you can't get Peli or Phyllis.

1868
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:34,840
I love Phyllis.

1869
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:35,640
She's so grumpy.

1870
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:36,600
Maybe that's just what it is.

1871
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:39,480
We have to wait for more events because we're, we've been getting some of them as they've

1872
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:40,200
released events.

1873
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,920
Like pave is a good example of that, of the events that they're doing.

1874
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:44,280
We just have to wait for more events, I guess.

1875
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:46,840
But these, these, uh, Hello Kitty ones are villagers.

1876
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:51,800
And so that would be neat if they would put, let them move into the village, but I guess

1877
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:52,280
it's a lot to ask for.

1878
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:55,640
I don't see it happening though, unless they figure out some way to do it.

1879
01:38:55,640 --> 01:39:01,000
But at least the thing with, with, um, this Animal Crossing is that the game we have now

1880
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,160
is not quite the same game we got when it came out.

1881
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:03,660
True.

1882
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:06,120
It's got lots of other stuff to do.

1883
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:11,400
So moving on, since this is supposed to be rapid fire, um, Nintendo, huh?

1884
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:12,440
I just was just laughing.

1885
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:21,560
Oh, Nintendo announced a, uh, monster Hunter rise, uh, special edition switch and, uh,

1886
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:27,240
and also a switch pro controller, uh, for, uh, the same that will be out when the game

1887
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:29,400
is released in Japan on March 26th.

1888
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:33,160
Uh, the price will be 38,400 yen.

1889
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:38,600
So roughly about, you know, 30 or 380 bucks us.

1890
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:44,600
And it has, of course, the, the doc, the unit, the joy cons that are all monster Hunter rise

1891
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:45,100
themed.

1892
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:50,600
Um, and then you can also get the digital copy of the game.

1893
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:54,920
And for the pre-order bonus, there's a deluxe kit with downloadable content.

1894
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:55,640
It looks cool.

1895
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:57,720
I'm not in a monster Hunter, but it looks cool.

1896
01:39:57,720 --> 01:39:58,220
Yeah.

1897
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:01,480
Nothing of course about, you know, the U S so.

1898
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:03,580
All right.

1899
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:05,160
All right.

1900
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:08,520
Well, let's travel around the world, starting in the U S and looking at the rest of the

1901
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:12,040
world too, and check out what will be coming out in release dates.

1902
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:12,540
Loki.

1903
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:13,560
Yes.

1904
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:19,160
Uh, so this week we have cultists simulator on Nintendo switch, uh, destruction all stars

1905

Uh, we have habroxia two on PC PlayStation four Vita, Xbox one and Nintendo switch.

Uh, Haven on Nintendo switch and PlayStation four sky forge on Nintendo switch, uh, werewolf,

01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:04,120
complete edition.

1912
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:04,680
And that's it.

1913
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:06,200
All right.

1914
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:08,360
Well, Japan's list is pretty short this week.

1915
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:12,840
Just that Neo collection, Neo one and two on the PlayStation five.

1916
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:16,680
And then as you were saying, Neo to kind of remastered on the PlayStation four, that is

1917
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:16,760
it.

1918
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:19,000
Those are the soul releases in Japan this week.

1919
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,360
So how about the UK dark soccer?

1920
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:22,520
Only a handful.

1921
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:26,840
We have werewolf, the apocalypse earth blood on the 4th of February.

1922
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:31,640
And then on the 5th, we have anima arcane edition and ghost of the tail collectors

1923
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:32,140
edition.

1924
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:33,960
All right.

1925
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:35,240
All right.

1926
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:39,560
Well, we have a few more stories for you guys before we get to the listener round table

1927
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:42,120
via our chat, as well as our mailbag.

1928
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:45,720
And you can always email the show, participate at orange lounge radio.com.

1929
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:47,720
If you want to drop us a line via email.

1930
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:49,960
Um, but let's get to some more news Loki.

1931
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:53,400
So everybody's probably familiar with the game Celeste.

1932
01:41:53,400 --> 01:42:00,920
I was unaware that the game originally was released on the Pico eight, um, back in 2016

1933
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:03,640
and now, uh, extremely okay.

1934
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:10,280
Games is creating a sequel for that, uh, Pico eight version called Celeste to, uh, Lonnie's

1935
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:14,040
Trek, which is actually available to download now for free.

1936
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:16,920
Um, so that's pretty sweet.

1937
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:20,840
And then you can find that on itch, the IO, um, check it out there.

1938
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:28,200
But I had no idea that that was actually a, uh, game on the Pico eight.

1939
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:28,360
Yeah.

1940
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:29,400
I didn't realize that either.

1941
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:30,200
That's pretty cool though.

1942
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:31,480
That game's everywhere now though.

1943
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:32,760
Yeah.

1944
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:36,120
I'm kind of curious to see if they're going to, you know, port that over to the, like

1945
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:37,560
the newer style or something like that.

1946
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:40,360
That'd be kind of cool, but, um, have to check it out.

1947
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:41,400
Yeah.

1948
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:42,200
Why not?

1949
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:44,040
Why not let the sequel get some of that too?

1950
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:49,080
Cause you know, and they've, they've, um, given it away like as a plus game or a gold

1951
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:53,080
game and, you know, there's a lot of ways, uh, Epic store, I think had it as their free

1952
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:53,960
game at one point.

1953
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:57,080
So there's a lot of ways you've probably added this to your library at some point.

1954
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:59,720
And it is, it's not just like, Oh yay, free game.

1955
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:04,600
It actually is a really like, like bang your head against the wall, tough, like platformer,

1956
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:08,360
but it's, you know, kind of one of those, I would compare it a lot to super meat boy,

1957
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:09,640
like back when it was good.

1958
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:12,120
Um, to like, you know, Oh, just one more.

1959
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:14,600
I'm gonna try this level one more time, one more time.

1960
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:16,840
I'm going to beat it this time.

1961
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:18,600
It's it's that whole kind of thing.

1962
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:19,800
It's a neat game.

1963
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,400
So, all right.

1964
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:26,840
Um, moving on, let's talk about a remaster that didn't happen, but man, I wish we

1965
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:30,680
wish it would have, and that is a GoldenEye 007.

1966
01:43:30,680 --> 01:43:33,240
It was originally going to be for Xbox live arcade.

1967
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:37,720
Now, please don't confuse this with the version of GoldenEye that ended up being on the Wii

1968
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:39,800
by Activision a little bit later.

1969
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:44,200
Um, this is not that, uh, this was something else that was supposed to happen, uh, that

1970
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:47,880
was actually, and some of the footage has actually been released now.

1971
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:53,640
Uh, so there's a YouTube out there where somebody is actually playing it through an emulator.

1972
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:57,560
So they're actually able to see it in like 4k resolution and 60 frames a second, but

1973
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:59,320
you can tell it's a 360 game.

1974
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:01,000
I mean it, but it still looks really good.

1975
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,480
It looks even better than the Nintendo 64 game.

1976
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:07,160
And they even do some multiplayer in it, same screen multiplayer, which is how most people

1977
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:11,800
remember GoldenEye 007 was playing it with friends at a party or in a college dorm or

1978
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:12,840
something like that.

1979
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:19,400
Uh, this whole exercise was from 2007 because a rare of being owned by Microsoft developed

1980
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:22,760
the HD remaster of the Nintendo 64 classic.

1981
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:26,440
Unfortunately, thanks to copyright disputes, it didn't happen.

1982
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:27,560
That's a bummer.

1983
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:31,800
Um, of course we got the Activision version, which, um, for the Wii was, you know, the

1984
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:33,320
Wii didn't have a lot of great shooters.

1985
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:35,960
And apparently this, I didn't play a lot of it.

1986
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:40,600
I think I played it at E3 real quick one year, but, um, apparently a lot of people said it,

1987
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:41,640
it really wasn't bad.

1988
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:44,920
Like it could have been a lot worse as far as like remasters go.

1989
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:48,120
And they did a pretty decent job on the Wii, but I think there's a lot of people that want

1990
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:50,120
to see what Rare themselves would have done.

1991
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:52,040
And this is, this is certainly it.

1992
01:44:52,040 --> 01:45:00,920
So, um, there's rumors that they're going to release this in 2021 as some type of Xbox

1993
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:01,720
thing.

1994
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:05,560
Um, Hey, if they get the licensing and all that stuff worked out, go off.

1995
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:10,200
Like, Hey, if they added that to game pass, that's just another cool thing on game pass

1996
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:10,920
in my opinion.

1997
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:16,520
So, um, yeah, especially since how many same room multiplayer games are there anymore?

1998
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:17,880
There's so few, right?

1999
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:24,840
So anyway, um, dark Tetsuya says, I do believe the Wii version got re-released on PS3 and

2000
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:25,880
360 as well.

2001
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:26,360
Did it?

2002
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:29,720
I only ever remember the Wii one, but you're probably, you're probably right.

2003
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:31,960
I just remember the, the motion control.

2004
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:34,120
Of course, that was the big thing they were pushing, right?

2005
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:38,920
Because on the Wii and in some games did this very well where you would, you'd point at

2006
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:42,280
the screen to shoot and it was almost like using a mouse and keyboard.

2007
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:43,720
It was like mouse and controller.

2008
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:45,240
It was really weird, but it worked.

2009
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:45,880
It worked really well.

2010
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:46,520
Yeah.

2011
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:51,320
So, uh, some games did this better than others, but, um, the golden eye remaster was one of

2012
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:52,120
them that did it pretty well.

2013
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:54,040
All right, moving on.

2014
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:54,680
Dark Sakura.

2015
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:04,840
A little discussion, um, especially with, uh, the particular game, Astral Chain.

2016
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:08,280
Uh, Platinum said that Nintendo is the owner of the IP.

2017
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:14,680
Um, this came after fans noticed that the game's copyright had, that there was a change

2018
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:15,640
to the game's copyright.

2019
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:25,720
Um, so, uh, platinum, um, had said before that it was co-owned by itself and Nintendo

2020
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:31,080
in addition to the, to them having, uh, uh, the game's publishing rights.

2021
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:36,360
Um, and they had even talked about one day it might come, you know, to non-Nintendo platforms,

2022
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:40,440
but basically there was the change and the copyright notice had been modified to remove

2023
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:41,800
the mention of platinum games.

2024
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:49,640
And so they came right out and says, it's as it looks, it is Nintendo and it's on their

2025
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:51,400
website as it's Nintendo.

2026
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:56,600
Um, and they say that right now platinum games is not in a position to answer the question,

2027
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:59,480
uh, to clarify anything about that change in ownership.

2028
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:05,080
I wonder if Nintendo is planning on doing something with it, hence the change.

2029
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:05,880
It's interesting.

2030
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:06,680
Maybe.

2031
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:07,640
Maybe.

2032
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:12,920
Um, speaking of platinum and Nintendo, how about an update on Bayonetta 3, platinum?

2033
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:17,000
Like, I'm sure I'm not the only one to ask this, but, uh, it's been a little while since

2034
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,520
we heard anything about Bayonetta 3.

2035
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:24,200
It'd be crappy if Sega does get sold, you know, to someone who's not Nintendo.

2036
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:27,560
Um, I don't, I doubt they'll do that.

2037
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:30,440
I think the agreement would already be in writing.

2038
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:31,480
I don't think they'd be able to do it.

2039
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:32,520
I mean, I guess anything's possible.

2040
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:33,320
I don't know.

2041
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:37,720
But, um, still I'm all about take the time to get it right.

2042
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:39,000
You know, don't rush the game.

2043
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,040
There's been a pandemic.

2044
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:41,000
I get all that.

2045
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:45,320
Uh, still just a little, a little teaser, a new little update would be, would be wonderful.

2046
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:47,880
That would, that would give me the energy I need to get through the year.

2047
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:52,120
So hopefully the Switch is just setting up for a badass year.

2048
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:55,000
Maybe Bayonetta 3 got pushed to be a Switch Pro game.

2049
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:00,920
One can dream, but can you imagine that the new Zelda and a new Metroid game, like all

2050
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:04,360
hitting at once, like, Oh, that'd be such, that'd be such a hot year.

2051
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:07,960
Like if that's what the Switch Pro's lining up, that's a hot launch lineup.

2052
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:11,800
I I'm, I'm fan, but I'm going to admit, I fully admit I am fanboying.

2053
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:16,840
None of this is based in reality whatsoever, but what a hot lineup that would be.

2054
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:17,960
That's for sure.

2055
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:18,360
All right.

2056
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:20,280
Uh, moving on Loki.

2057
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:22,200
Yeah.

2058
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:25,320
So, uh, some more cyberpunk updates.

2059
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:30,840
So we talked about how there was the 1.1 update, which did fix some stuff, but also

2060
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:33,000
introduced some game breaking bugs.

2061
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:40,360
So now there's the 1.11 update that will fix those game breaking bugs that they last

2062
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:41,640
patch introduced.

2063
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:45,640
So they went ahead and released those already, the hot fix for that.

2064
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:50,040
And it's taking care of some of the issues that were in that.

2065
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:52,920
There's also some more updates coming as well.

2066
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:55,880
Second one's due out in a few weeks.

2067
01:48:55,880 --> 01:49:00,680
So, um, we'll have to wait and see what that improves as well, but at least to see

2068
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:04,280
that they're addressing some of the issues like they had with, uh, the hollow calls,

2069
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:05,480
not coming through and stuff like that.

2070
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:09,720
Um, and then on a completely different topic.

2071
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:18,840
So there's been mods for cyberpunk 2077 that allows you to, um, change, uh, who the

2072
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:21,240
different joy toys are in the game.

2073
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:25,240
So those are the like, uh, cybernetic prostitutes.

2074
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:32,120
And so of course, since Johnny Silverhand is in the game, they've went ahead and swapped

2075
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:33,240
out the character.

2076
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:39,240
Um, that's normally the quote unquote, joy toy and put Keanu Reeves in there.

2077
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:43,880
Or you can also, uh, put in, uh, one of the other characters that they had in there as

2078
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:44,200
well.

2079
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:50,280
But Loki, Loki, Loki, was there any doubt that once we knew that cyberpunk would, would

2080
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:55,160
yes, be a PC game and that yes, Keanu Reeves would be in the game.

2081
01:49:55,160 --> 01:50:00,360
Was there any doubt that the modding community was going to come along and be like, how long

2082
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:02,200
until I can fuck Keanu Reeves?

2083
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:05,960
Like, are we shocked?

2084
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:06,600
Are we shocked?

2085
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:07,160
I am.

2086
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:07,560
I'm not.

2087
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:13,240
Apparently though, what is interesting though is apparently they have removed that mod.

2088
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:16,200
Um, it's so it is not available.

2089
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:16,920
Nothing.

2090
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:18,360
Nothing has ever truly removed.

2091
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:26,920
So Nexus, Nexus mods did take it down, but you know, um, I'm sure you can find it out

2092
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:27,420
there.

2093
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:31,000
So, uh, Nexus mods is having a week, aren't they?

2094
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:32,360
Yeah.

2095
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:33,640
Apparently, well, CG.

2096
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:37,720
So it came to the way it got taken down as it came to a CD project.

2097
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:38,920
Red's attention.

2098
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:44,040
Uh, the studio had said that our most important rule regarding user generated content, uh,

2099
01:50:44,040 --> 01:50:47,800
game mods in particular is that it can't be harmful towards others.

2100
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:53,320
In the case of model swaps, especially those involved in explicit situations, it can be

2101
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:59,000
perceived as such by people who lent us their parents for, as a Korean characters in, uh,

2102
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,600
cyberpunk 2077.

2103
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:01,400
Sorry, internet.

2104
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:04,520
You'll just have to fuck your Keanu Reeves body pillow you bought on wish.

2105
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:05,800
I mean,

2106
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:13,720
I mean, whatever it could have been a lot worse.

2107
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:16,520
He was so clothed in the scenes from what I saw.

2108
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:20,920
But then again, the video that they were showing a lot of that was, uh, cut and like blacked

2109
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:21,160
out.

2110
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:24,520
But, um, I mean, it's just a model swap.

2111
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:27,800
So, but I'm sure it can be much worse.

2112
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:31,160
And of course, just wait, it's early.

2113
01:51:31,160 --> 01:51:33,320
If that game's only been out a couple of months, it's early.

2114
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:37,000
No, the correct way to phrase that is not, it could be much worse.

2115
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:37,560
It is.

2116
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:38,760
It will be much worse.

2117
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:41,160
It's true.

2118
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:42,680
Very true.

2119
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:47,320
Let's revisit the story in six months and see what perverse things the internet has

2120
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:48,120
come up with now.

2121
01:51:50,040 --> 01:51:50,540
Yeah.

2122
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:52,280
All right.

2123
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:57,560
Well, Hey, now that the, now that they have the, the three model out there, I mean, I'm

2124
01:51:57,560 --> 01:52:01,000
sure it'll be a matter of time before we see him added to the Skyrim or something like

2125
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:01,500
that.

2126
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:04,920
All right, let's move on.

2127
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:06,920
Uh, let's see.

2128
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:11,080
Oh, a comment from Marissa Meisel in our chat who says the union has been taking things

2129
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:15,480
like this seriously, not just because of funny sex things, but so actors are exploited

2130
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:17,080
for things they weren't paid for.

2131
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:23,000
You know, that is, I I've heard about that in regards to who was in the game.

2132
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:24,600
Heavy.

2133
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:26,680
Was it heavy rain with the shower scene?

2134
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:28,040
Was that Elliot?

2135
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:29,240
Was that Elliot Page?

2136
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:30,440
Was it somebody else?

2137
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:30,920
No.

2138
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:32,920
Elliot Page was in the sequel.

2139
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:37,080
She was in the, um, Oh gosh, I don't remember what it was.

2140
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:37,960
With like, uh,

2141
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:41,800
why do I remember?

2142
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:43,320
Why do I remember?

2143
01:52:44,440 --> 01:52:50,440
Remember it's he now, but yes, I understand when the, in the game, but, um, let's see,

2144
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:57,560
Elliot Page, there was like a shower scene or something and they had rendered breasts

2145
01:52:58,360 --> 01:53:05,400
and that was really infuriating to, um, Elliot Page because obviously

2146
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:06,840
It was beyond two souls.

2147
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:08,920
That's his beyond two souls.

2148
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:09,880
Thank you.

2149
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:13,720
And, um, that was not part of the agreement basically.

2150
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:19,720
And so when that, even though that wasn't in the game, like I think modders found that

2151
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:26,600
and that infuriated, um, that camp, uh, Elliot pages, you know, and, uh, his representation

2152
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:27,480
and so forth.

2153
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:32,280
Um, and so I, and I believe this is that kind of issue that Marissa is bringing up in chat

2154
01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:37,480
as well is that, yeah, you got to be very careful when you have these likenesses in

2155
01:53:37,480 --> 01:53:40,520
the game, what you can and can't render.

2156
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:46,520
Um, unfortunately, um, you know, the modding community, you can't stop them.

2157
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:50,360
That's and that's the, that's modders going to mod.

2158
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:50,920
Yeah.

2159
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:55,720
So I think it also goes to like, but, but how much ammunition did you give them?

2160
01:53:55,720 --> 01:53:56,360
Right.

2161
01:53:56,360 --> 01:54:03,640
In the case of beyond two souls and Elliot, um, it was, you know, the breasts were rendered

2162
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:04,680
in the game, I guess.

2163
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:08,200
And this whole thing, even though they weren't shown, they were rendered, but it gave the

2164
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:12,680
modders ammunition because it's like, Oh, we don't have to invent breasts because they're

2165
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:13,720
in the game.

2166
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:20,760
Um, but in the case of, uh, um, Keanu Reeves, I'm sure his dong was not rendered for the

2167
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:21,400
game.

2168
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:23,480
So they, but it's probably not even shown, right.

2169
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:26,120
They probably just do like more of a suggestive sexual scene.

2170
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:26,920
I don't know.

2171
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:27,880
I've played the mod.

2172
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:30,040
I'm not going to, but, um, yeah.

2173
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:32,440
Uh, interesting.

2174
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:36,840
Bobby Blackwell reminds us, uh, the Sims is an AO game because of mods.

2175
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:38,360
So says former lawyers.

2176
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:38,920
Yeah.

2177
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:39,160
Yeah.

2178
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:40,760
So interesting.

2179
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:41,080
Interesting.

2180
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:42,360
All right.

2181
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:43,560
Anyhow, let's move on.

2182
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:49,640
Uh, I got one more story for you guys, and this is about, um, uh, Sonic changing voice

2183
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:50,200
actors.

2184
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:52,040
And this is, this is kind of a big deal.

2185
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:56,520
Like, uh, when David Hader left the role of solid snake, it's kind of a big thing.

2186
01:54:56,520 --> 01:55:01,080
So Roger Craig Smith is the name of the guy who's been voicing Sonic the Hedgehog for

2187
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:03,800
quite some time and on like 10 years.

2188
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:04,600
Right.

2189
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:08,200
So on Twitter, he mentioned, uh, no more.

2190
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:13,800
Uh, he does say that, um, uh, I guess a Sega rep has commented to some gaming blogs that

2191
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:15,960
of course they're thankful to Roger.

2192
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:21,240
Um, but, uh, and nothing was said, of course, openly about why is the change going on?

2193
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:28,040
Uh, but fans on Twitter are speculating that Ben Schwartz from the movie is going to be

2194
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:29,000
taking over the role.

2195
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:33,640
Moving forward, which makes sense because I know they're about to shoot that sequel

2196
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:38,680
because I saw one of the actresses on some talk show circuit thing and that's supposed

2197
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:39,160
to be in it.

2198
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:41,160
And she was commenting on that March.

2199
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:41,720
Yeah.

2200
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:45,400
So it's not surprising that Ben Schwartz is coming back.

2201
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:49,240
Um, but that is, you know, it does create kind of that disparity between movie role

2202
01:55:49,240 --> 01:55:53,640
and everything else role where, but I mean, at the same time, what Mark Hamill was playing

2203
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:56,680
the joker in the cartoons for years and years and years and years and years.

2204
01:55:56,680 --> 01:55:59,560
That didn't stop Heath Ledger from the movies and all this other stuff, even though Mark

2205
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:01,640
Hamill is a perfectly fine actor.

2206
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:05,000
Um, but anyway, it's such as the industry.

2207
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:10,520
Um, so Sega says, you know, Roger's portrayal of Sonic is one that fans are sure to remember.

2208
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:13,800
He brought the character to life that it, uh, and then the unsaid thing is, you know,

2209
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:15,720
but he's still fired and let go.

2210
01:56:16,120 --> 01:56:17,160
He was very happy though.

2211
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:20,920
Roger Craig Smith was very thankful for all the outpouring of love that he got on social

2212
01:56:20,920 --> 01:56:23,880
media and lots of people saying nice things, um, about him.

2213
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:25,080
So there was that as well.

2214
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:30,520
So, um, also I need to make sure I say this at some point.

2215
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:36,520
Um, also in a voice actor and actress news, uh, this is really, um, sad, but I have to

2216
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:41,560
mention this somewhere in the show and tip our hats to, uh, Jeanette mouse, who was an

2217
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:46,360
actor actually for resident evil village, uh, who passed away at 39.

2218
01:56:46,360 --> 01:56:51,480
Um, Jeanette played and I I'm sorry, I don't know the game, the village very well, but

2219
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:56,040
she played one of, uh, I guess, witches in the resident evil village.

2220
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:56,600
I think it's the new one.

2221
01:56:58,120 --> 01:56:59,560
Um, the giant woman.

2222
01:57:00,280 --> 01:57:03,480
Is it really supposed to be the new resident evil demo just came out.

2223
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:07,080
Oh, why did I think this was the last one?

2224
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:08,200
Wow.

2225
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:09,160
That's the new one.

2226
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:10,040
Oh my gosh.

2227
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:12,680
And that same week that everybody's going crazy.

2228
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:13,880
Yeah, she was 39.

2229
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:18,760
Um, she was in some films called your sister, sister, and my effortless brilliance, um,

2230
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:21,320
which was a movie that she actually co-wrote as well.

2231
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:27,240
And, uh, no, uh, information has been said as to why she passed, but, uh, the Hollywood

2232
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:32,360
reporter is saying she, she was fighting colon cancer, um, for the past eight months, but

2233
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:38,040
they haven't said that that was because she may have may have contracted COVID and when

2234
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:42,440
the cancer is going, you know, we don't know, but, um, still sad all the same.

2235
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:44,840
I didn't realize it was that same character.

2236
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:46,200
My gosh.

2237
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:46,680
Right.

2238
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:52,520
And you know, and that's, that's right when, you know, she's getting, you know, say what

2239
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:56,040
you will about all those memes and all that stuff that's out there about that character,

2240
01:57:56,040 --> 01:58:00,360
but that's, that's just great press for that actress.

2241
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:05,400
And so that really, really is horrible that she was taken from us really at her prime

2242
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:06,120
with that.

2243
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:07,560
So it's very sad.

2244
01:58:08,120 --> 01:58:09,960
So, um, tipping our hat for that.

2245
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:11,160
All right.

2246
01:58:12,200 --> 01:58:15,480
Let's move on and get into our listener round table.

2247
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:19,240
So we're going to talk a little bit with our emails and any questions that you guys have

2248
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:22,840
in chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

2249
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:25,720
If you have any questions for us, we're happy to take those on.

2250
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:30,280
So, uh, meanwhile, let's open up the mailbag participate at orange launch radio.com is

2251
01:58:30,280 --> 01:58:34,360
the place where you can send your emails every week and a dark soccer is going to open up

2252
01:58:34,360 --> 01:58:35,320
ye old mailbag.

2253
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:37,160
Damn.

2254
01:58:37,160 --> 01:58:38,520
Um, so, okay.

2255
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:41,560
Oh, it's, I'm not going to open spammer again.

2256
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:41,800
Okay.

2257
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:42,280
There we go.

2258
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:46,440
I think we left it up because it was funny, but the emails are still taking like forever

2259
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:47,480
to load for me.

2260
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:47,720
Yeah.

2261
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:52,840
So I always saw one in there and it was really short, but I'll, I'll let you see if there's

2262
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:53,400
two.

2263
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:53,640
Okay.

2264
01:58:53,640 --> 01:58:54,680
Then another one must've just come in.

2265
01:58:54,680 --> 01:59:00,520
But, but the problem is, is that, that, uh, the, the mailbox has been taking like a really

2266
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:02,360
long time to open lately on this computer.

2267
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:03,640
I mean, this computer is ready to go.

2268
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:06,520
Um, oh, I did though.

2269
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:06,760
Sorry.

2270
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:11,080
I just want to say DJ Rama S in regards to the last story, wanted to add Capcom.

2271
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:13,000
Oh, I thought you said Capcom did.

2272
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:16,760
Oh, well, Capcom better put an in memoriam to her in the game.

2273
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:17,560
Yes, they should.

2274
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:17,800
Sorry.

2275
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:21,720
When I first read that, I heard Capcom did, but he's, he's saying that he wants to see

2276
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:22,840
that in the game and I would agree.

2277
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:23,960
That would be very appropriate.

2278
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:24,840
I hope they do that.

2279
01:59:24,840 --> 01:59:25,560
Sorry, Jamie.

2280
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:26,200
Yeah.

2281
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:29,560
Well, at any rate, while I'm waiting for this to load, I did find something funny going

2282
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:31,560
back to the whole Reddit army thing.

2283
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:31,800
Sure.

2284
01:59:32,360 --> 01:59:33,960
Um, now they're looking at commodities.

2285
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:37,800
So silver prices are jumping to a high.

2286
01:59:39,560 --> 01:59:40,520
That was like commodity.

2287
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:42,280
Oh, those things.

2288
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:42,680
Okay.

2289
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:44,200
Yeah.

2290
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:47,320
So now they're looking to, uh, to silver.

2291
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:55,160
They basically bought shares in, um, an Australian, uh, uh, mining firm and they bought big and

2292
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:58,040
they like, like they leapt to 15%.

2293
01:59:58,680 --> 01:59:59,720
So it was pretty crazy.

2294
01:59:59,720 --> 02:00:00,440
Why silver?

2295
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:03,720
Um, because they're shorting that as well.

2296
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:04,200
Yeah.

2297
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:06,440
Oh, okay.

2298
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:14,280
So right now it's at 28.99 an ounce and this email still hasn't fucking loaded.

2299
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:15,960
Time to melt down all the jewelry.

2300
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:22,440
No, the, this, the stupid email now I just loaded.

2301
02:00:22,440 --> 02:00:22,680
Okay.

2302
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:23,720
And it's kind of a big one.

2303
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:28,840
So dear OLR, I just wanted to note that I thought you guys did an incredible job explaining

2304
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:30,760
sexuality and how it relates to furries.

2305
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:33,720
In addition to the fandom, not being purely a sexual thing.

2306
02:00:34,520 --> 02:00:38,760
Jamie is the word community using the word community was appropriate as that's exactly

2307
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:42,840
what a furry is a community that shares a mutual love of anthropomorphic animals across

2308
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:44,680
multiple media forms.

2309
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:47,560
Yes, there are sex and that isn't what defines it.

2310
02:00:48,280 --> 02:00:52,600
Ask yourself what may be going on behind closed doors at your local anime con.

2311
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:57,960
Let people be people, whatever they, uh, whether they have sexual attractions or not.

2312
02:00:57,960 --> 02:01:03,880
Hell, I'll admit that Star Fox has had me hot and bothered for as long as I can remember,

2313
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:08,680
but I also won't judge you for eyeing a poster of Faye Valentine from Cowboy Bebop.

2314
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:14,600
One more thought, honestly, the best way to understand furry is just to go to a furry

2315
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:16,920
convention when it's safe to have cons again.

2316
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:21,400
I identified with furries for a long time, but didn't really get it until I went to my

2317
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:24,200
first Anthrocon in 2013.

2318
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:27,720
Friends were made at those cons that I'll have for life.

2319
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:32,360
And the level of love and acceptance I get from that community is wholly different.

2320
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:36,200
It's comfort I can't have with my friends who don't understand why I find fursuiting

2321
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:36,840
so magical.

2322
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:41,880
I compare it to other conventions where you go because you are a fan of an anime or comic

2323
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:42,920
book series.

2324
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:45,960
In furry, we're fans of each other and the characters we create.

2325
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:47,400
That's what makes it special.

2326
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:51,000
I implore you to check out a convention even if your interest is only fleeting.

2327
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,600
It just might ignite a spark.

2328
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:54,440
Thanks for reading Garth Wolf.

2329
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:56,200
P.S. Rob, bring back guys on the show.

2330
02:01:56,600 --> 02:02:00,040
I had a feeling this email when it was the first paragraph might have been from this

2331
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:05,640
individual, but I'm happy you were happy with the way we represented that on the show.

2332
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:08,520
And I don't think there's a lot else to comment on that email.

2333
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:11,880
I think you made a request there that I think is very fair.

2334
02:02:11,880 --> 02:02:13,640
So that's that's really all there is to say on that.

2335
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:16,520
Well, now I'm waiting five years for this other one to open.

2336
02:02:17,640 --> 02:02:22,360
How about anyone got any stories while I'm waiting for this damn email?

2337
02:02:22,360 --> 02:02:25,480
Well, I was also going to go to chat and look at some comments there in our chat room.

2338
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:30,440
And Tiger Con says there's also people out there who don't find humans attractive, but

2339
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:33,240
find anthropomorphic characters attractive.

2340
02:02:33,240 --> 02:02:35,400
I don't think it's a link.

2341
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:38,680
I think maybe kink or anything, but some people do feel that way.

2342
02:02:38,680 --> 02:02:45,480
So as long as you have consent, as long as you're not hurting anyone or pushing it on

2343
02:02:45,480 --> 02:02:46,120
anyone else.

2344
02:02:48,920 --> 02:02:52,280
As long as everybody is the age of consent, I think this is another important thing to

2345
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:52,840
put out there.

2346
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:53,960
Anything I might be missing?

2347
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:58,920
So have a safe word.

2348
02:02:58,920 --> 02:02:59,420
All right.

2349
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:05,000
I was going to say, though, about the whole like because in the email it went into, you

2350
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,080
know, let me have the furry thing.

2351
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:09,080
You have your Cowboy Bebop poster.

2352
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:13,640
Or I would argue, since we just brought up that character from Resident Evil, I saw all

2353
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:15,320
sorts of things on Twitter about that.

2354
02:03:15,320 --> 02:03:18,680
So everybody's got their thing.

2355
02:03:19,640 --> 02:03:20,440
We'll leave it at that.

2356
02:03:21,720 --> 02:03:22,360
Go ahead, Jamie.

2357
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:24,600
It's loaded, by the way.

2358
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:26,360
It still hasn't loaded?

2359
02:03:26,920 --> 02:03:28,680
No, I can get to it.

2360
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:31,160
I finally started watching Drag Race, though.

2361
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:32,440
Oh, did you?

2362
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:38,600
Yeah, I have one person I loathe and one person I love already.

2363
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:41,400
I can guess both of those.

2364
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:43,240
Okay, who do you think I hate?

2365
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:44,520
Candy.

2366
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:45,400
That's who everybody hates.

2367
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:45,900
Yeah.

2368
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:47,640
Who do you think I love?

2369
02:03:47,640 --> 02:03:49,400
Tamisha Iman, because that's the correct answer.

2370
02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:52,140
Gottmik.

2371
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:53,800
Gottmik's pretty cool.

2372
02:03:54,600 --> 02:03:57,240
Yeah, I think the winner is very, very obvious, though.

2373
02:03:57,240 --> 02:03:59,000
And it's none of those people we just named.

2374
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,840
But anyway, we'll see.

2375
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:01,080
All right.

2376
02:04:01,080 --> 02:04:03,480
Anyhow, let's move on this email.

2377
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:05,640
I got the email up because I get them on my phone as well.

2378
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:11,960
This person did not sign the email and I don't feel comfortable reading the tube line because

2379
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:14,440
I don't know what this person prefers to be called.

2380
02:04:14,440 --> 02:04:16,520
So I will call this anonymous email.

2381
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:19,960
And also, just a reminder, if you want us to read your name on air, which we're happy

2382
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:23,720
to do, don't forget to sign the email with whatever you want to be called and help me

2383
02:04:24,680 --> 02:04:26,760
out with a pronunciation if it's tough.

2384
02:04:27,800 --> 02:04:29,560
But this is unsigned and it's very simple.

2385
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:30,280
It's one sentence.

2386
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:34,360
I would think it would be sent from the phone if it didn't.

2387
02:04:34,360 --> 02:04:36,440
But it doesn't say sent with my iPhone at the bottom.

2388
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:41,080
The question is, what is the best song in video games?

2389
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:45,960
From our anonymous listener, what is the best song in video games?

2390
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:47,320
You know what?

2391
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:53,000
It's a very basic, simple question, but one that we haven't touched on in a long time.

2392
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:56,680
Well, I don't think the emailer expects us to give the definitive answer.

2393
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:59,080
But what is our best, our favorite song in video games?

2394
02:04:59,080 --> 02:05:01,320
What is the best song to us in video games?

2395
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:04,920
I have some answers, but I'll let you guys go first.

2396
02:05:08,680 --> 02:05:16,840
I'm trying to remember if it was used in the game.

2397
02:05:16,840 --> 02:05:18,520
I think it was used in the game.

2398
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:27,400
I want to say that, well, Info High was in the Macross Plus movie.

2399
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:34,200
But I do believe that it was in, yeah, it was in one of the games,

2400
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:36,520
Uta Macross, Somafo De Culture.

2401
02:05:38,280 --> 02:05:40,360
But I can use that song because it was in a game.

2402
02:05:41,160 --> 02:05:41,800
I'm kidding.

2403
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:49,160
Um, honestly, I don't know that there's a best game, a best song,

2404
02:05:49,160 --> 02:05:54,600
because there's so many different genres that I can't really choose one.

2405
02:05:55,720 --> 02:05:57,240
Okay, this is easy for me. I'll do it.

2406
02:05:59,320 --> 02:06:05,400
So for me, the Final Fantasy XIV soundtrack has been a huge reason why I stay with that game.

2407
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:07,160
That's a really good soundtrack.

2408
02:06:07,160 --> 02:06:12,920
Soken has done amazing things with the legacy that Nobuo Imatsu started

2409
02:06:12,920 --> 02:06:14,920
and really taken it in a modern direction.

2410
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:17,000
And honestly, if you're going to start anywhere,

2411
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,400
start with the prologue from Realm Reborn.

2412
02:06:19,400 --> 02:06:21,880
Start with the basic, like the crystal theme.

2413
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:27,800
Listen to that because that is the character creation music in Final Fantasy XIV.

2414
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:32,200
And it is so, like, it is the perfect version of that song.

2415
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:34,600
Literally the perfect version of that song.

2416
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:35,960
And it's in Final Fantasy XIV.

2417
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:37,800
And that, you know, there's other stuff.

2418
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:39,960
Like there's some primal fights that have amazing music

2419
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:42,520
and there's just so many different varieties and genres.

2420
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:48,440
I think Soken is the best video game composer we have out there right now.

2421
02:06:48,440 --> 02:06:50,600
And it's a damn shame he's only doing one game.

2422
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:59,480
Fingers, toes and everything else I have crossed that perhaps he is doing Final Fantasy XVI.

2423
02:06:59,480 --> 02:07:03,320
But that's a lot of work for one person because XIV is enough.

2424
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:05,480
Like there's hundreds of tracks in XIV.

2425
02:07:05,560 --> 02:07:07,720
But I think he's a brilliant, brilliant person.

2426
02:07:08,360 --> 02:07:11,960
I'm actually going to go with a song from a game that I don't really care for,

2427
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:14,200
but it introduced me to one of my favorite singers.

2428
02:07:15,240 --> 02:07:17,320
So Kiss Me Goodbye by Angela Aki.

2429
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:21,720
She's got such a fantastic voice.

2430
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:25,000
She's actually, I think, in the US now finishing up some music production.

2431
02:07:25,720 --> 02:07:29,960
But she's just one of my favorite vocalists ever.

2432
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:34,120
And I even remembered reading an interview where she said she

2433
02:07:34,120 --> 02:07:37,160
had a dream of playing at the Budokan.

2434
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:41,320
She had actually been to a Sheena Ringo concert, who's another singer I like.

2435
02:07:42,920 --> 02:07:45,400
And she got her start with Final Fantasy games.

2436
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:50,680
And was a year later, she's playing at Budokan.

2437
02:07:50,680 --> 02:07:54,200
Yeah, it's interesting to see how like the music from video games

2438
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:56,760
have really influenced some of the artists today.

2439
02:07:56,760 --> 02:08:01,560
Like that Porter Robinson has some pretty good music CDs and stuff.

2440
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:04,840
And my understanding is he's influenced by Beatmania and DDR.

2441
02:08:05,960 --> 02:08:10,920
So he is an artist that kind of represents a lot of that stuff that we all loved,

2442
02:08:11,480 --> 02:08:13,800
when we were in our 20s, although this guy's younger.

2443
02:08:13,800 --> 02:08:16,440
So I imagine he was more of a kid when he heard a lot of this stuff.

2444
02:08:16,440 --> 02:08:18,040
But I just think that's really cool.

2445
02:08:18,040 --> 02:08:20,920
And then you listen to his stuff and you can hear it.

2446
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:23,160
You can hear the Beatmania influence in a lot of his music.

2447
02:08:24,680 --> 02:08:28,920
I will go back to something else, which I'm going to probably go on record saying

2448
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:33,240
it probably has one of my overall favorite video game soundtracks is Chrono Trigger.

2449
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:39,480
Because too far away times will always make me choke up a little bit,

2450
02:08:39,480 --> 02:08:41,720
just somewhere a little bit in my heart.

2451
02:08:41,720 --> 02:08:45,880
And the feel of the theme of Zeal, our shotless theme.

2452
02:08:47,480 --> 02:08:49,960
That one also is one of my favorites.

2453
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:53,640
So I didn't quite get to finish, but I was going to say, no, it's okay.

2454
02:08:53,640 --> 02:08:58,120
It's okay, because you kind of didn't get your answers out there.

2455
02:08:58,360 --> 02:08:58,840
Until now.

2456
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:03,400
But I was going to say, so if I was to get away from the MMOs a little bit,

2457
02:09:03,400 --> 02:09:06,200
especially because I can't really pinpoint a specific song in that game,

2458
02:09:06,200 --> 02:09:07,960
I was going to say Scar of Time.

2459
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:14,200
Even though Chrono Cross is not the greatest game of my life,

2460
02:09:15,160 --> 02:09:21,960
that intro and that song were stunning, especially that song.

2461
02:09:21,960 --> 02:09:26,760
And that's just, I think, a definitive all-time classic game song.

2462
02:09:28,120 --> 02:09:31,080
My third and final answer for this question would be,

2463
02:09:31,080 --> 02:09:34,280
because I would say a song that is extremely versatile,

2464
02:09:34,280 --> 02:09:39,880
meaning like an 8-bit song that has just been reimagined time and time again in glorious ways.

2465
02:09:39,880 --> 02:09:41,880
And this song is amazing.

2466
02:09:41,880 --> 02:09:43,960
Every single time I've heard it reinterpreted,

2467
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:46,280
I think it's a song that can't be bad,

2468
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:50,920
would be the overworld theme from The Legend of Zelda, throwing it back.

2469
02:09:53,400 --> 02:09:54,760
How many times have we heard that song?

2470
02:09:55,320 --> 02:09:56,200
Remixed?

2471
02:09:56,200 --> 02:09:56,920
Orchestral?

2472
02:09:58,840 --> 02:09:59,880
Is it ever bad?

2473
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:02,840
I mean, I guess maybe I'm challenging the internet with that question,

2474
02:10:02,840 --> 02:10:03,880
but you know what I mean?

2475
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:10,120
Like that song is just so versatile and so brilliant.

2476
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:13,960
Like it just, it represents my childhood, really.

2477
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:16,120
So that would be my answer.

2478
02:10:16,120 --> 02:10:18,840
Loki, and I see the chat is lighting up on this.

2479
02:10:18,840 --> 02:10:19,880
I want to get to you guys too,

2480
02:10:19,880 --> 02:10:23,720
but Loki, I got to ask you the email question as well.

2481
02:10:23,720 --> 02:10:25,080
What's the best video game song?

2482
02:10:29,080 --> 02:10:29,720
I don't know.

2483
02:10:30,280 --> 02:10:33,240
I mean, there's lots of good stuff.

2484
02:10:33,240 --> 02:10:34,280
It's hard to pick the best.

2485
02:10:37,640 --> 02:10:38,200
I don't know.

2486
02:10:38,200 --> 02:10:40,920
Like if I'm going to go back to like DDR stuff,

2487
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:42,760
I'd say anything by Naoki.

2488
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:45,320
So I don't know the one that kind of stands up to me

2489
02:10:45,320 --> 02:10:48,920
that used to play a lot on my cabinet is D2R.

2490
02:10:49,880 --> 02:10:52,120
That's kind of encompassing,

2491
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:56,760
like kind of the Naoki song style with like a Brilliant 2U,

2492
02:10:56,760 --> 02:10:58,520
B4U or anything like that.

2493
02:10:58,520 --> 02:10:59,240
But, you know.

2494
02:10:59,240 --> 02:11:02,120
Did you hear that Step Maniacs has new Naoki songs?

2495
02:11:02,120 --> 02:11:03,080
Like they got him over there.

2496
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:04,840
I know Step Maniacs is awesome.

2497
02:11:04,840 --> 02:11:05,720
I know, good for them.

2498
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:06,840
Good for them.

2499
02:11:06,840 --> 02:11:07,640
They have a lot.

2500
02:11:07,640 --> 02:11:08,440
I mean, they're pretty much,

2501
02:11:08,440 --> 02:11:11,320
they have the whole song library now of the whole Bomani series,

2502
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:14,600
because it's like, it's all being brought back in there.

2503
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:17,080
But yeah, like I know he's got new stuff in there.

2504
02:11:17,640 --> 02:11:18,600
So it's pretty cool.

2505
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,680
All right, let me get some of the chat answers.

2506
02:11:20,680 --> 02:11:23,000
You guys are blowing up chat in the best way

2507
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:24,520
and you guys have some great answers here.

2508
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:25,800
Let's see.

2509
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:27,240
DragonSamurai said,

2510
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:29,480
best song in video games?

2511
02:11:29,480 --> 02:11:32,840
Opera song in Final Fantasy 3 or 6 for the Super Nintendo?

2512
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:33,240
Yes.

2513
02:11:33,240 --> 02:11:35,400
I mean, that is, you want to talk Final Fantasy?

2514
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:39,720
Like that moment changed games, truly.

2515
02:11:40,280 --> 02:11:42,520
And the song was a huge part of that.

2516
02:11:43,240 --> 02:11:44,280
Some other answers here.

2517
02:11:44,840 --> 02:11:48,040
Azette says, a thousand words from Final Fantasy X-2,

2518
02:11:48,040 --> 02:11:48,920
the best performed.

2519
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:51,640
Our pal Bobby Blackall says,

2520
02:11:51,640 --> 02:11:53,880
Persona 5, wake up, get up, get out there.

2521
02:11:55,560 --> 02:11:56,040
Let's see.

2522
02:11:56,040 --> 02:11:57,400
Black Compat says,

2523
02:11:57,400 --> 02:12:00,520
I absolutely love the Last of Us Part 1 soundtrack.

2524
02:12:00,520 --> 02:12:01,800
I have that one on vinyl.

2525
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,200
ZenMonkey11 says,

2526
02:12:04,200 --> 02:12:06,600
the instrumental at the start of Streets of Rage.

2527
02:12:06,600 --> 02:12:09,240
I heard that at night on a cool windy day and it gave me life.

2528
02:12:09,240 --> 02:12:11,160
I also love the Killer Instinct song.

2529
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:13,960
Oh my God, Killer Instinct's got such a good soundtrack.

2530
02:12:14,040 --> 02:12:14,600
Hell yeah.

2531
02:12:16,360 --> 02:12:16,860
Let's see.

2532
02:12:18,840 --> 02:12:19,880
Some other comments here.

2533
02:12:20,920 --> 02:12:22,840
Story about Killer Instinct 2.

2534
02:12:22,840 --> 02:12:23,320
What's that?

2535
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:25,960
When Dan and I were still just friends online,

2536
02:12:25,960 --> 02:12:27,640
I was telling him how much I liked.

2537
02:12:28,680 --> 02:12:32,440
I think it was Orchid's theme in Killer Instinct 2.

2538
02:12:33,560 --> 02:12:38,040
And so he kept restarting his game over and over

2539
02:12:38,040 --> 02:12:41,240
so he could get me a WAV file recorded of it.

2540
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:42,060
Hmm.

2541
02:12:42,600 --> 02:12:45,240
And I still have that file somewhere.

2542
02:12:45,240 --> 02:12:45,740
Nice.

2543
02:12:47,800 --> 02:12:51,240
ActDef kind of tried to rephrase the question a little bit.

2544
02:12:52,360 --> 02:12:54,280
And I don't know if this would give you guys different answers,

2545
02:12:54,280 --> 02:12:56,200
but let me read ActDef's version of the question.

2546
02:12:56,840 --> 02:13:00,600
What was the game that made you notice video game music

2547
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:03,000
as something more than just background noise?

2548
02:13:03,640 --> 02:13:05,320
That's a neat question.

2549
02:13:05,320 --> 02:13:05,880
I like that.

2550
02:13:05,880 --> 02:13:07,080
A little different spin on it.

2551
02:13:07,080 --> 02:13:10,840
What's the game that made you notice video game music?

2552
02:13:11,160 --> 02:13:13,800
I would have to throw way fucking back

2553
02:13:14,440 --> 02:13:18,680
because remember, before I grew up on Nintendo Entertainment System,

2554
02:13:18,680 --> 02:13:21,560
there was a period of time between the ages of about five and nine

2555
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:23,640
where I grew up on the Commodore 64.

2556
02:13:24,280 --> 02:13:27,400
And therefore, one of the first background songs I noticed

2557
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:31,080
that really made me notice the music was Pitfall 2, The Lost Caverns.

2558
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:36,200
And that was one of the first times a video game had a static song playing behind it.

2559
02:13:36,200 --> 02:13:39,320
Because think about most of those Atari 2600 games back in the day.

2560
02:13:39,320 --> 02:13:40,360
They were very like,

2561
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:45,400
boop, blip, brrr, like some of those unique noises the 2600 made.

2562
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:49,960
And it wasn't until you had Pitfall 2, specifically The Lost Caverns,

2563
02:13:49,960 --> 02:13:51,400
where you had that theme song.

2564
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:55,880
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

2565
02:13:55,880 --> 02:13:58,520
And then when you would get hit by something,

2566
02:13:58,520 --> 02:14:01,720
then the game would suddenly go into a minor key.

2567
02:14:01,720 --> 02:14:04,920
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

2568
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:06,360
Like it got all sad.

2569
02:14:06,360 --> 02:14:08,120
And it's hard not to notice that.

2570
02:14:08,120 --> 02:14:11,880
And I would say that was the first for me.

2571
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:12,680
How about you guys?

2572
02:14:13,320 --> 02:14:15,880
The game that made you notice video game music.

2573
02:14:16,600 --> 02:14:19,080
Bobby says we're going to get DMCA'd.

2574
02:14:19,080 --> 02:14:20,200
No, we're not.

2575
02:14:20,200 --> 02:14:21,240
I used to always.

2576
02:14:21,240 --> 02:14:23,640
No, it wasn't that it was necessarily music,

2577
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:25,160
but the intro to Space Fury,

2578
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:32,280
where it almost seemed to me like the alien guy who was taunting you was singing to you.

2579
02:14:33,320 --> 02:14:35,800
So that was one that did it for me early on.

2580
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:43,800
There was even like a mousetrap.

2581
02:14:43,800 --> 02:14:45,800
I couldn't play it without the background music

2582
02:14:45,800 --> 02:14:49,000
because it was just sort of like set a rhythm to how I would play it.

2583
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:52,200
And the music wasn't either that dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

2584
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:53,080
you know, over like that.

2585
02:14:54,440 --> 02:14:57,480
Because I'm just trying to think what else.

2586
02:14:59,960 --> 02:15:03,640
I guess if I was going to get into the Nintendo era of stuff,

2587
02:15:03,640 --> 02:15:12,280
it would probably have been playing through the Guardian Legend.

2588
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:16,120
Yeah, because I had a killer soundtrack in it.

2589
02:15:16,120 --> 02:15:17,240
So underappreciated.

2590
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:19,880
But actually, I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to go back.

2591
02:15:20,440 --> 02:15:21,880
I'm going to say it was R-Type.

2592
02:15:22,600 --> 02:15:23,400
Arcade R-Type.

2593
02:15:24,840 --> 02:15:26,840
Because I love the first level music for R-Type.

2594
02:15:27,480 --> 02:15:32,040
And that really made me just think this is what video game music is.

2595
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:37,080
Yeah, I was going to say because Bobby in chat said there were some great

2596
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:39,320
Commodore 64 tracks that slapped.

2597
02:15:39,320 --> 02:15:42,840
Yeah, another one that honestly you wouldn't even think this,

2598
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:45,960
but Dragon's Lair and Dragon's Lair 2,

2599
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:50,120
which were both influenced by the original Dragon's Lair arcade game,

2600
02:15:50,120 --> 02:15:52,040
but they they're not a direct port of it,

2601
02:15:52,040 --> 02:15:55,320
because obviously the Commodore 64 cannot handle those types of graphics.

2602
02:15:55,320 --> 02:15:58,680
But the music in those games, especially the second one,

2603
02:15:58,680 --> 02:16:01,480
which I think was Escape from Singe's Castle or something like that,

2604
02:16:01,480 --> 02:16:02,920
is so good.

2605
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:07,000
Like I remember being like seven and hearing that for the first time,

2606
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:08,360
like just like going, whoa.

2607
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:12,040
And this was the whole time when I was getting into music, like taking organ.

2608
02:16:12,040 --> 02:16:13,320
I didn't take piano lessons.

2609
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:16,040
I took organ lessons because we had one of those like

2610
02:16:16,040 --> 02:16:19,640
70s Wurlitzer synthesizer like church organs in our house.

2611
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:24,600
And it was awesome because that was the that was the thing people bought in the 70s

2612
02:16:24,600 --> 02:16:28,760
that would do like the the automatic bossa nova backing track by hitting the switch.

2613
02:16:28,760 --> 02:16:31,240
And then you do do do anyway.

2614
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:31,880
So that was fun.

2615
02:16:32,600 --> 02:16:34,680
So Loki, anything for you?

2616
02:16:34,680 --> 02:16:37,160
The first game where you really noticed video game music?

2617
02:16:37,880 --> 02:16:39,720
Probably like the Legend of Zelda.

2618
02:16:39,720 --> 02:16:41,080
Yeah. Yeah.

2619
02:16:42,280 --> 02:16:42,780
For sure.

2620
02:16:43,720 --> 02:16:44,220
All right.

2621
02:16:45,160 --> 02:16:47,320
Marissa in chat kind of wondering aloud,

2622
02:16:47,320 --> 02:16:51,000
I'd love to know what the early composers in gaming were thinking,

2623
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:54,760
because so many soundtracks are masterpieces and they had to keep in mind

2624
02:16:54,760 --> 02:16:57,400
how long people would be listening to these songs.

2625
02:16:58,040 --> 02:16:58,540
Yeah.

2626
02:16:59,320 --> 02:17:01,320
Surely someone's made a documentary on this,

2627
02:17:01,320 --> 02:17:05,320
but I would love to hear interviews with some of these like great song makers of old,

2628
02:17:05,320 --> 02:17:08,680
like, you know, Koji Kondo and, you know, the people that really brought us,

2629
02:17:08,680 --> 02:17:12,840
you know, a lot of the eight bit bit music that we're all naming here.

2630
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:18,280
I think Bobby and Dragon Samael basically nailed it.

2631
02:17:18,280 --> 02:17:22,440
They were thinking we only have 10K of space for audio production.

2632
02:17:23,080 --> 02:17:29,560
And honestly, a lot of the early sound designers were really like,

2633
02:17:29,560 --> 02:17:32,520
let's make it sound good and make it work with the game and make it fit.

2634
02:17:32,520 --> 02:17:33,160
True.

2635
02:17:33,160 --> 02:17:33,660
True.

2636
02:17:34,280 --> 02:17:37,880
Now today is a different story, but.

2637
02:17:38,680 --> 02:17:39,180
Yeah.

2638
02:17:40,120 --> 02:17:45,240
And I think that some of like, I remember when I got to meet Koji Kondo in 2006

2639
02:17:46,200 --> 02:17:51,400
and I thanked him for, you know, prolonging my interest in music because he

2640
02:17:51,400 --> 02:17:58,840
did the music for a lot of games that, that were really, I would say inspiring for me

2641
02:17:58,840 --> 02:18:00,440
and the music has really stuck with me.

2642
02:18:00,440 --> 02:18:03,880
And I got to thank him at E3 that one year when they were doing what We Music.

2643
02:18:04,760 --> 02:18:05,260
Yeah.

2644
02:18:05,720 --> 02:18:11,880
Like the preview for We Music and he looked so surprised and delighted by it.

2645
02:18:11,880 --> 02:18:16,360
So I was like, I guess they never did think that it was going to happen.

2646
02:18:16,360 --> 02:18:20,200
And now, you know, just such talent in, in what he does.

2647
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:24,600
And I'm even going to say that who, whoever's doing the music for Animal Crossing this time

2648
02:18:24,600 --> 02:18:33,480
around is really doing just, it's very interesting with Animal Crossing is that the music in this

2649
02:18:33,480 --> 02:18:39,800
particular one seems all like it's variations on the same theme, whether or not it's in the same

2650
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:45,880
key or it has a switch, but it has like even my favorite music in the game, the five o'clock funk

2651
02:18:45,880 --> 02:18:51,880
is what I call it, has that intro, you know, thing as a lick in that tune.

2652
02:18:51,880 --> 02:18:59,320
And I, I really, I'm really looking forward to, not looking forward, but I really like

2653
02:18:59,320 --> 02:19:03,000
when there's that sort of a musical continuity in a game.

2654
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:03,500
Yeah.

2655
02:19:04,280 --> 02:19:07,880
You know, I think Marissa kind of hearing all these answers and what the chat's saying about

2656
02:19:07,880 --> 02:19:13,480
the limitations is kind of having a wow moment and says in chat, Marissa again says limitations

2657
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:16,520
can really help creativity explode sometimes.

2658
02:19:16,520 --> 02:19:17,560
Yeah, absolutely.

2659
02:19:17,560 --> 02:19:18,200
Absolutely.

2660
02:19:18,200 --> 02:19:23,720
And Dragon Samael kind of adds to that saying it's astounding though, when you're so limited

2661
02:19:23,720 --> 02:19:26,680
in what you can make, you had to get that hook right away.

2662
02:19:26,680 --> 02:19:27,800
That's another good point.

2663
02:19:27,800 --> 02:19:29,640
You had to go right into the hook.

2664
02:19:29,640 --> 02:19:31,960
So very, very interesting.

2665
02:19:31,960 --> 02:19:34,840
Have you seen what some cosplayers do on an incredible budget

2666
02:19:35,560 --> 02:19:38,840
and they do these amazing outfits that are all pretty much thrifted?

2667
02:19:38,920 --> 02:19:46,360
I mean, that, that right there, you know, people who I was actually watching, um, I,

2668
02:19:46,360 --> 02:19:51,720
I sometimes like to watch this tiny, tiny home videos and this one person took all of

2669
02:19:51,720 --> 02:19:59,160
the scrap from his, uh, barn and built his wife an office out of scrap.

2670
02:19:59,160 --> 02:20:01,400
But have you seen what La La Ri did on a budget?

2671
02:20:02,200 --> 02:20:03,000
I don't know who that is.

2672
02:20:04,600 --> 02:20:05,400
No, we love her.

2673
02:20:05,400 --> 02:20:06,040
We stan her.

2674
02:20:06,040 --> 02:20:06,600
She's great.

2675
02:20:06,600 --> 02:20:08,440
She's a, I don't know who that is.

2676
02:20:08,440 --> 02:20:09,240
Drag race.

2677
02:20:09,240 --> 02:20:10,760
I thought you watched drag race.

2678
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:11,400
I just started.

2679
02:20:11,400 --> 02:20:12,600
I don't know all their names yet.

2680
02:20:12,600 --> 02:20:13,100
Okay.

2681
02:20:14,440 --> 02:20:15,480
You'll, you'll, you'll get there.

2682
02:20:15,480 --> 02:20:18,920
I don't know when I, I know they kicked off Elliot and then Elliot came back.

2683
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:19,400
Yes.

2684
02:20:19,400 --> 02:20:19,640
All right.

2685
02:20:19,640 --> 02:20:20,040
You'll get there.

2686
02:20:20,040 --> 02:20:20,600
You'll get there.

2687
02:20:20,600 --> 02:20:21,160
All right.

2688
02:20:21,160 --> 02:20:23,160
Uh, moving on.

2689
02:20:23,160 --> 02:20:27,320
Um, and, uh, just because Sia Tabiri in chat says, ouch.

2690
02:20:27,320 --> 02:20:29,080
I said, I said, we stan her.

2691
02:20:29,080 --> 02:20:31,240
I'm just given a little bit of a hard time.

2692
02:20:31,240 --> 02:20:33,880
I can't, you know, do certain things either.

2693
02:20:33,880 --> 02:20:34,520
All right.

2694
02:20:34,520 --> 02:20:35,320
Anyway, moving on.

2695
02:20:35,320 --> 02:20:37,720
I don't want to spoil because I guess Jamie isn't all caught up yet.

2696
02:20:37,720 --> 02:20:38,220
All right.

2697
02:20:38,280 --> 02:20:43,080
Um, let's move on and talk about, uh, some last minute stories.

2698
02:20:43,080 --> 02:20:45,240
If you guys have anything else to, uh, add.

2699
02:20:47,640 --> 02:20:47,960
Yeah.

2700
02:20:47,960 --> 02:20:53,080
I was going to mention that, uh, the battle born servers have finally been deactivated.

2701
02:20:53,080 --> 02:20:53,580
Oh yeah.

2702
02:20:54,920 --> 02:20:56,120
Not playable at all.

2703
02:20:56,120 --> 02:21:00,520
Apparently even that, uh, extended to the single player portion of the game.

2704
02:21:01,080 --> 02:21:05,960
So you got yourself a wonderful little coffee or a coaster now.

2705
02:21:07,800 --> 02:21:08,520
Womp womp.

2706
02:21:09,640 --> 02:21:10,120
Yeah.

2707
02:21:10,120 --> 02:21:16,680
Thing random where apparently, uh, Pokemon red is still being played inside of someone's

2708
02:21:16,680 --> 02:21:18,120
Twitter at avatar.

2709
02:21:18,120 --> 02:21:18,520
Oh yeah.

2710
02:21:18,520 --> 02:21:20,600
We, we had the original story about that.

2711
02:21:20,600 --> 02:21:22,280
A couple is still going right.

2712
02:21:22,280 --> 02:21:22,840
Still going.

2713
02:21:22,840 --> 02:21:23,340
Yeah.

2714
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:25,420
Interesting.

2715
02:21:27,640 --> 02:21:28,840
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

2716
02:21:28,840 --> 02:21:29,340
Yeah.

2717
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:32,120
I didn't know that was still going on.

2718
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:36,920
Anything else from Loki or dark saga?

2719
02:21:36,920 --> 02:21:37,880
That's all I had.

2720
02:21:39,800 --> 02:21:43,000
Um, uh, no, I didn't see anything.

2721
02:21:45,720 --> 02:21:46,600
All right.

2722
02:21:46,600 --> 02:21:51,640
Well then, uh, I guess we will wrap it up pixel boxes as porn went out, uh, with, uh,

2723
02:21:51,640 --> 02:21:53,320
pushing F for battle born in chat.

2724
02:21:54,040 --> 02:21:54,920
All right.

2725
02:21:54,920 --> 02:21:55,960
Uh, that's it.

2726
02:21:55,960 --> 02:22:00,840
We're going to wrap things up here and thank you guys so much for, uh, listening to our

2727
02:22:00,840 --> 02:22:01,320
show tonight.

2728
02:22:01,320 --> 02:22:02,280
We really appreciate it.

2729
02:22:02,280 --> 02:22:04,040
Thank you everybody for taking part.

2730
02:22:04,040 --> 02:22:04,760
Uh, thank you.

2731
02:22:04,760 --> 02:22:05,480
Thank you.

2732
02:22:05,480 --> 02:22:08,920
Um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch radio tonight, tell a friend

2733
02:22:08,920 --> 02:22:09,800
or two about the show.

2734
02:22:09,800 --> 02:22:13,240
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if

2735
02:22:13,240 --> 02:22:15,880
the voices aren't here, we can't put them out.

2736
02:22:15,880 --> 02:22:19,400
So, uh, tell your friends as long as they aren't shit bags, tell your friends.

2737
02:22:19,400 --> 02:22:24,680
And you know, you know, if you have a friend who's a shit bag, but invite your cool friends,

2738
02:22:24,680 --> 02:22:29,080
uh, to the show and, uh, hang out with us and, uh, yeah, well, it's a good way to spend

2739
02:22:29,080 --> 02:22:32,760
a Sunday night, uh, a nice five star review wherever you found the show, whether it's,

2740
02:22:32,760 --> 02:22:38,520
uh, iTunes or Spotify or wherever, uh, it goes a long way, a host on a site like Twitch

2741
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:40,040
that goes a long way as well.

2742
02:22:40,040 --> 02:22:45,000
Uh, also, uh, uh, sharing on social media, uh, super appreciate that stuff.

2743
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:48,440
Um, also I have to give a quick plug to the shop.

2744
02:22:48,440 --> 02:22:52,120
Uh, if you really enjoyed the show tonight and you want to, uh, buy some merchandise

2745
02:22:52,120 --> 02:22:55,880
that says VOG network or OLR on it, please take a moment to swing by the store.

2746
02:22:55,880 --> 02:22:58,680
vognetwork.com slash shop.

2747
02:22:58,680 --> 02:23:02,600
If you want to check out some stuff and yes, we will add some more merchandise to that

2748
02:23:02,600 --> 02:23:04,040
hopefully in the next month or so.

2749
02:23:04,040 --> 02:23:05,880
Um, just a few, a few more things for you guys to check out.

2750
02:23:05,880 --> 02:23:08,040
Someone wants her, her lady shirts.

2751
02:23:08,040 --> 02:23:08,440
Yeah.

2752
02:23:08,440 --> 02:23:10,360
So I said, give me some designs.

2753
02:23:10,360 --> 02:23:11,160
We'll get some shirts.

2754
02:23:11,160 --> 02:23:11,480
All right.

2755
02:23:11,480 --> 02:23:14,040
No, there's designs up there and there's no lady shirt for it.

2756
02:23:14,040 --> 02:23:15,240
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2757
02:23:15,240 --> 02:23:17,560
I said I would add one of the designs to it, to a lady shirt.

2758
02:23:17,560 --> 02:23:21,800
So sure, of course, but it's, it's also my way to try to trick and get some more designs.

2759
02:23:22,120 --> 02:23:23,720
All right.

2760
02:23:23,720 --> 02:23:25,880
Oh, I'll work on something.

2761
02:23:25,880 --> 02:23:26,280
All right.

2762
02:23:26,280 --> 02:23:26,760
Sounds good.

2763
02:23:27,320 --> 02:23:27,720
All right.

2764
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:30,360
Um, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2765
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:32,280
Um, Loki, we'll start with you.

2766
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:32,920
Your final thought.

2767
02:23:33,960 --> 02:23:36,680
My final thought is diamond hands to the moon.

2768
02:23:39,800 --> 02:23:45,480
Uh, my final thought is, um, let's hope crypto coin takes off, except I only put in like

2769
02:23:45,480 --> 02:23:46,040
50 bucks.

2770
02:23:46,040 --> 02:23:47,320
I'm not expecting it to go anywhere.

2771
02:23:47,320 --> 02:23:51,400
Well, if you think about it, like with Doge, I mean, it's at 3 cents right now.

2772
02:23:51,400 --> 02:23:55,240
So even if it goes down to one cent, that's like, just that's two thirds of the money

2773
02:23:55,240 --> 02:23:55,720
they put in.

2774
02:23:55,720 --> 02:23:58,440
But that's not the crypto I invested in.

2775
02:23:58,440 --> 02:24:02,520
I knew that one would be too, you know, all over the map.

2776
02:24:02,520 --> 02:24:07,560
So, um, I, I did a different one that I just kind of did my own research and I was like,

2777
02:24:07,560 --> 02:24:09,720
all right, maybe this one will go up.

2778
02:24:09,720 --> 02:24:11,480
Kind of just playing with it a little bit.

2779
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:12,360
All right.

2780
02:24:12,360 --> 02:24:12,760
We'll see.

2781
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:15,640
Um, dark soccer, your final thought.

2782
02:24:16,840 --> 02:24:19,640
Um, I don't know.

2783
02:24:20,120 --> 02:24:21,720
I don't have thoughts anymore.

2784
02:24:21,720 --> 02:24:27,640
I have a series of random, uh, time has dissolved to the point where I no longer have coherent

2785
02:24:27,640 --> 02:24:28,120
thoughts.

2786
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:33,000
I just say whatever the fuck happens to come out without even processing it, you know?

2787
02:24:33,880 --> 02:24:42,440
Um, yeah, I'm not ready for my staycation to be, be home, but I did have a little health

2788
02:24:42,440 --> 02:24:45,880
scare that I am glad everything came through just fine.

2789
02:24:45,960 --> 02:24:50,040
So, um, some people have been following me on Twitter and thank you for all the support

2790
02:24:50,040 --> 02:24:50,680
that you gave me.

2791
02:24:50,680 --> 02:24:55,240
Um, I had a little cancer scare, um, everything came back benign.

2792
02:24:55,240 --> 02:24:56,120
So, hey.

2793
02:24:56,120 --> 02:24:57,080
All right.

2794
02:24:59,080 --> 02:25:01,240
Um, all right, that's going to do it.

2795
02:25:01,240 --> 02:25:04,120
Thank you so much for listening to another episode of Orange Launch Radio and joining

2796
02:25:04,120 --> 02:25:04,600
us tonight.

2797
02:25:04,600 --> 02:25:06,280
We will be back here in seven days.

2798
02:25:06,280 --> 02:25:09,320
Yes, I understand there's stuff going on on TV, but too bad.

2799
02:25:09,320 --> 02:25:11,000
We're still doing our show as we always do.

2800
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,080
So we will see you next week.

2801
02:25:13,160 --> 02:25:14,840
But until then, have a great week.

2802
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:15,640
Happy gaming.

2803
02:25:15,640 --> 02:25:16,120
Good night.

2804
02:25:43,320 --> 02:25:47,000
Or vog network, but you know, they were all still true.

2805
02:25:50,040 --> 02:25:54,120
See you next week.

2806
02:26:13,080 --> 02:26:24,120
Bye.
