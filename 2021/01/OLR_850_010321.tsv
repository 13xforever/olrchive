0	14260	As the years continue on, technology is only getting better, smaller, faster, and cheaper.
14260	17300	And that enables makers without access to high-end fabrication and materials to make
17300	18920	more and more impressive designs.
18920	23780	Like, for example, a Nintendo 64 that is smaller than the original controller, screen included,
23780	25140	no permanent cables needed.
25140	28340	Praise be to those who have this kind of talent and commitment to pull off such an incredible
28340	29340	feat.
29340	31580	That's the story in the first episode of 2021.
31580	34820	Join your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki for this and the rest of the New
34820	38500	Year's news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
38500	43780	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
43780	47580	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47580	52500	It is Orange Lounge Radio, the very first show of 2021.
52500	61980	My name is Rob Roberts, here with you on January the 3rd of 2021 with my co-hosts.
61980	66860	I am just noticing I did the classic mistake at the beginning of the year, and it still
66860	73720	says 2020 up in the text here on Twitch, because we do tape live every Sunday night at twitch.tv
73720	78640	slash VOG Network, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby
78640	80000	Black Wolf show.
80000	81920	And let's get that officially changed.
81920	84040	Yes, we are in 2021.
84040	88920	Anyway, episode 850 for this January the 3rd of 2021.
88920	97320	Again, I am Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
97320	98320	I'm
98320	99320	Hello.
99320	100320	Hi.
100320	101320	Hi.
101320	102320	How are you, Jamie?
102320	103320	I'm all right.
103320	107760	I've been fighting my new camera today and fighting my mic and fighting my headphones
107760	111080	and, you know, all kinds of garbage.
111080	113080	So yeah, but, but we're good.
113080	114080	Yeah.
114080	116520	You guys should have seen the scramble before the show and I thought we had her and then
116520	117520	it slipped for me.
117520	118520	That's right.
118520	120520	Uh, as you can see, I've got a new camera.
120520	121520	Yeah.
121520	122520	You look really good.
122520	123520	New camera.
123520	124520	Yeah.
124520	125520	Yeah.
125520	129220	It's just the thing is, is that, um, I don't have a long enough cable for it.
129220	134360	So it's nestled in an awkward spot until I can get it adjusted.
134360	136520	Yeah, but it works.
136520	141080	We get, we get the whole sense of your, your nerdy, your nerd cave that you have going
141080	142080	on there.
142080	143080	So it looks good.
143080	144080	Yeah.
144080	145080	Glad to see it.
145080	150400	Uh, I have my, uh, right behind me is that I finally got my supernatural shelf put together
150400	154080	and I realized I need another shelf for it.
154080	155680	One more shelf is never enough.
155680	160960	Uh, going to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, VOG network, because again, we
160960	166000	do tape live on Sunday nights over there, uh, pixel pocket saying, woo, new camera and
166000	168520	pod culture saying, I like the blue on that wall.
168520	169520	I do too.
169520	170520	It's a good color.
170520	171520	Blue.
171520	172520	Sorry.
172520	173520	Podcast folks.
173520	174520	The color Matt painted it, but it's a good color.
174520	178360	It's a good, um, people don't always remember this used to be grandpa's house.
178360	179360	Yes.
179360	182340	I don't know if everybody knew that, but, or captain Matt, depending on which shows
182340	187960	you listen to, but yeah, so, um, now, um, what was I gonna say?
187960	190320	Oh, I was going to ask how your, how your new year's went.
190320	193040	Cause it was, it was kind of weird this year.
193040	197520	I mean, obviously with, with no parties or anything, but just, I watched the time square
197520	202080	thing on TV and it was so weird.
202080	205280	Did you partake in any of that?
205280	206760	Played crossing at midnight.
206760	208840	Oh, of course.
208840	209840	That's it.
209840	214800	I didn't, it, it, it actually wasn't even anything worth talking about.
214800	215800	Yeah.
215800	219280	The, well, the, the animation and animal crossing was super cute.
219280	222560	I saw, um, like a lot of people were doing the clips and putting it, you know, cause
222600	224160	Nintendo has the share thing.
224160	226100	So a lot of people were putting it on Twitter that way.
226100	230240	And I seem to remember making a quip that, um, the, the animal crossing parties looked
230240	233160	a little more hopping than time square did this year.
233160	234600	So it was, uh, it was cute.
234600	236520	I loved the way Nintendo did it.
236520	237520	It's super cute.
237520	246560	Well, I mean, I liked the music in it, I reckon, um, we really, uh, it, the music is actually
246560	251580	what made me kind of happy with new year and then, um, but for the most part, I just wasn't
251580	252580	feeling it.
252580	254780	I haven't really been feeling any holiday, anything.
254780	263100	Um, I hear you, but there's also, I mean, there's been some, uh, some personal drama
263100	269980	around those lines just with, you know, uh, anniversary of people who we've lost and sure
269980	270980	things like that.
270980	275100	So, well, um, let here's hoping that there is, is light at the end of the tunnel for
275100	276100	2021.
276100	280620	And, you know, we can all, we can all get our vaccines and, and bring OLR back together
280660	284820	again, uh, later this year, whenever it may be, and I don't think we have any realistic
284820	285820	timeframe yet.
285820	289140	Um, we'll do it when it's safe for those that are curious, like when's, when's the gang
289140	290140	going to get back together?
290140	293020	Uh, I'd like to know that too, but there's a lot of factors.
293020	296580	So we're just going to keep doing what we're doing in the meantime, which is, uh, worked
296580	301700	out for us, um, through 2020 best it could, uh, let's go on these lines.
301700	306940	We were still together just virtually, virtually together at home.
306940	307940	Yes.
307940	308940	That whole thing.
308940	309940	Absolutely.
310260	314620	Um, just a little bit last week, like, um, you know, uh, I, I was always kind of skeptical
314620	319380	of the idea if it would really work and I'm not sure that technology was really there
319380	324140	even like three, four years ago before disco cord was so commonplace now.
324140	327260	Um, I don't think we could have done this over Skype as easy.
327260	328260	I really don't.
328260	331900	Um, but I think some of the newer things, you know, zoom, I guess we could have used
331900	336660	this or everybody else is using stream yard, not stuff, but, um, uh, I really think the
336660	341580	technologies, thank heavens were there for shows like us and many others, uh, right at
341580	343300	the right time for sure.
343300	345220	So, um, yeah.
345220	348420	And I hope you guys are all staying safe out there as well.
348420	352380	Um, also I did, I should know, well, let me, I'll note it in a minute.
352380	354220	Let me also introduce, I don't make him sit there anymore.
354220	355380	Say hello to tech master.
355380	356380	Loki.
356380	357380	Hello.
357380	358380	Hi.
358380	359380	How are you?
359380	360380	I'm fine.
360380	361380	Sorry.
361380	362380	Jamie and I had to dish.
362380	363900	Uh, you had a big start to the year.
363900	366260	We've got to, we got to talk about this.
366260	369660	You dropped something big.
369660	377660	You took a big crap at the end of the year, but like, you know, uh, there was some, some
377660	382380	bugs that I didn't anticipate that I had to fix, but yeah, I tell us about, I released,
382380	389300	I released a, uh, new year's, uh, New Year's Eve, what was New Year's Eve, um, demo for
389300	390420	a pixel poops too.
390420	396820	So it's got five brand new levels, uh, a few of which that are new year's themes.
396820	402260	And I have like a fun, uh, color changing thing to go along with that and stuff.
402260	404520	So it's, it's available now.
404520	408320	You can download it and play it and check it out.
408320	416940	And it's available over on itch.io on your page, which it's a techmastergames.itch.io.
417940	422740	It's also linked in Discord and on my social media and all that stuff.
422740	423740	Nice.
423740	424740	Well, congratulations.
424740	428100	I did download it and check it out and you have to, you have to have, um, very specific
428100	430340	emulators to run it.
430340	435280	But I, so I used one of the ones you said, yeah, messin's really the best way to go with
435280	436280	that.
436280	442260	Um, I'm going to put together, there's this thing called nest tech, um, that one of the
442260	446200	guys in the community that made this game flee put together to actually publish his
446200	447960	games on steam.
447960	451000	And so it's kind of a wrapper for NES games.
451000	452560	And so it works okay.
452560	456600	Um, I actually checked it out to try to do that.
456600	459800	So I'm just going to set that up and I'll put that up as another download as well.
459800	460800	Nice.
460800	464440	And then that way you don't have to worry about trying to find the emulator and get
464440	466000	your stuff configured.
466000	467760	You can just load it and it'll go.
467760	469640	And so that'd be another way to try it out.
469640	470920	Um, I'll be coming soon.
470960	477480	I, I, I, um, downloaded it and I played a little bit, but I didn't play too much because
477480	480640	I want to do a Twitch stream of it.
480640	483560	And that'll happen soon with awesome games done quick this week.
483560	486360	It might not happen until next week, but that's, that's on the agenda.
486360	491200	I want to, I want to stream Loki's game because here we are, it's been what, like three years.
491200	494120	And now I'm sitting here going, I played Loki's game.
494120	495120	I did.
495120	498520	I can say that here's how we're starting 2021.
498520	503200	I played Loki's game and you have a few folks in chat who checked it out as well.
503200	504200	So congrats.
504200	505200	Yeah.
505200	510240	So I tried to make it difficult because it is going to be, you know, um, it obviously
510240	515320	like if I was just to release the first few levels I had made so far, like in my actual
515320	519320	game, um, it wouldn't be difficult at all, but I just tried to ramp up the difficulty
519320	525600	as each level went on and it also changed the way that the continues work because typically
525600	530280	in the main game, it's going to be, you know, if you continue within like, say a span of
530280	533760	like 10 levels, it resets you back to the beginning of whatever world you're in.
533760	537880	And since this is like a five level demo, it is just resets you back to whatever level
537880	540440	you're in and you get three continues.
540440	549120	Although, I mean, I'm sure you could figure out a way to get more continued if, if, if
549120	556360	you use, you know, certain methods that you might've used in, say, I don't know, Contra
556360	562560	or, okay, shine a fucking spotlight on it, low-key.
562560	563560	But that's okay.
563560	566960	So the Konami code does work, so give it a try.
566960	567960	All right.
567960	572360	Um, and so I just tried to make it a little bit challenging and I have actually ramped
572360	577500	the difficulty down in the last level because I had the spawn time a little bit tighter.
577500	581220	So it was spawning much faster and it got really, really difficult.
581220	585740	So I had to ramp it down because I do want people to actually be able to complete it.
585740	586740	Okay.
586740	591340	So, well, I'm, uh, I'm excited for you to release the full game and it sounds like you
591340	592820	have different ways you can approach it.
592820	595060	Like whether you do like a steam wrapper type of thing.
595060	599080	And of course you had talked about doing some limited, very, very limited cartridge runs
599080	600080	as well.
600080	602940	And I know some of our folks will be into that and, and we'll hear more about that throughout
602940	603940	the year, but congrats.
603940	612900	I did commission artwork for the, um, the actual, um, cartridges themselves and possibly
612900	614080	packaging and stuff like that.
614080	618820	So I've actually be coming in a few weeks, but yeah, it, it it'll be fun.
618820	619820	I'm excited.
619820	623100	Now we get to say game developer, Loki.
623100	626900	You're no longer tech master, Loki, your game developer, Loki.
626900	627900	Okay.
627900	629460	All right.
629460	630460	Anyway.
630460	633020	Uh, let's get into some news.
633100	636940	Well, let's be, let's be honest, the news this week is a little bit lighter, um, as
636940	637940	it usually is.
637940	638940	A little?
638940	639940	Yeah.
639940	640940	I know this, I'm going to be real.
640940	643980	We, we have a few things to talk about and we will, but the news that like the types
643980	648420	of news items we have tonight would probably be like rapid fire any other week.
648420	653220	So it's, it's, it's, you know, there's not a lot going on because of, uh, new, the new
653220	657540	year and the holiday and, and what have you, it's just this, the site, most people probably
657540	659580	in the game industry are just off this week.
659580	664400	In fact, a lot of, uh, journalists and people that report on the industry are off this week.
664400	668460	Even if we're all, you know, staying at home, well, a, we know not everybody stayed at home,
668460	672820	unfortunately, but B, even if you're staying at home, it's still good to take a break.
672820	676220	You don't want to necessarily be working, you know, 365 a year.
676220	679540	So the industry slowed down this week with the new year and everything.
679540	681300	So the news is slowing down as well.
681300	684680	There's a few things that we'll get into it, but this is a really good time for us to take
684680	686580	a look back on 2020.
686620	688620	I know as much as we want to avoid it.
688620	693620	Um, I think there was a great comic out there and I know I shared it on Twitter and Jamie,
693620	695540	I saw you posted it on Facebook.
695540	699540	It was a, it was a great comic that was, uh, and I'm sorry, I forget the artist's name,
699540	704460	but it showed the year 2020 like talking to the grim reaper or something going was, was
704460	706020	I a good year?
706020	713620	And the grim reaper goes, no, Jesus Christ, fuck no, even though it's like the little
713660	714660	dog one.
714660	715660	Was I a good boy?
715660	716660	Yes.
716660	717660	It was a, it was a parody of that.
717660	718660	Yeah, exactly.
718660	724140	Um, it was that which when you wait, I know we don't want to look back on 2020, but when
724140	728220	it comes to games, there were some pretty good ones and this is always a fun thing for
728220	729220	us to do.
729220	732860	And I'm sure half the shows, if not more that you listen to are doing something similar.
732860	737220	And that is to look back on our favorite games of the year.
737220	742580	And I don't like to say the best games of the year or the definitive, no, because everybody's
742580	744200	got their own opinions.
744200	747620	These are our favorite games of the year and there's nothing you can do about it, period.
747620	753300	Um, and you know what, sometimes a game might sneak in there that didn't actually come out
753300	754300	this year.
754300	756940	Uh, I mean, look at among us, right?
756940	760340	I mean, that game has been getting lots of accolades this year.
760340	766060	Technically that came out in 2018 some people take issue with Hades and the early access
766060	767180	to that game.
767180	768740	Not really a 2020 game.
768740	771400	Those rules do not apply here at OLR.
771400	774280	They are our favorite games of 2020.
774280	778840	Um, usually we would go around and go like three, three, three, two, two, two, one,
778840	779840	one, one.
779840	783440	But I think I just want to, you know, with, with the crazy year it's been and the interesting
783440	789040	game releases, I think I just want to let people go and give their lists and, and talk
789040	790400	about their reasons why.
790400	794980	So, um, can, can I call on dark soccer to go first?
794980	798960	Only because I was going to say, I have a really good idea of what's coming.
798960	801540	It was all animal crossing.
801540	804100	I mean, that was really it all animal crossing.
804100	806560	I didn't really play anything else, but animal crossing.
806560	810600	Um, the other stuff that I played was just like retro games.
810600	814800	Like, you know, pop and twi- I played a lot of pop and twinbee.
814800	816520	I played a lot of Puyo Puyo.
816520	820580	So I guess actually that Puyo Puyo championship thing that came out, I would put that as number
820580	822080	two.
822080	827700	Um, but animal crossing, just animal crossing.
827700	832420	Why do you think, like, is, is retro, you know, I don't, I don't need to get too like
832420	835700	into like, what is going through your brain, dark soccer, but just trying to see if maybe
835700	840840	there's something here about like, do you think like the retro games in this year have
840840	843860	been kind of like comfort food in a way?
843860	845180	Yeah, pretty much.
845180	850140	I mean, it's just like, you know, it's, do I want to go out to this fancy new restaurant
850140	856740	that's opened up and everyone loves, or do I want pizza and I want pizza because even
856780	859460	when pizza is bad, it's still pretty fucking good.
859460	861460	Wasn't that a quote, mawrats?
861460	863180	Anyway, or clerks.
863180	864860	Um, no, I hear you.
864860	869540	You know, what's funny because even on the Xbox Series X that I have, I was going back
869540	874500	into my library the other day and I was like, I want to go play gyrus because they released
874500	875940	that on the 360 at one point.
875940	880780	So it's in my library and I had it and I ended up having like a retro day around here and
880780	885940	I, I, and that's kind of why I asked the question is because you know, with as crazy of a year
885940	891500	as it's been, sometimes those old standards and those old go-tos have been the, the comfort
891500	893500	food, the pizza we've needed this year.
893500	894740	So like, I get it.
894740	895740	I do.
895740	901460	Um, SSG100Matt says, uh, I didn't really play too many new 2020 games.
901460	905320	I mostly dug into my backlog that I never touched after I bought them.
905320	908700	So Firewatch was one of my favorite games I played in 2020.
908700	912220	That's a very good point as well about now's the time to dig into the backlog.
912220	915180	Fifth Dream says comfort games came out this year.
915180	916180	Absolutely.
916180	920180	Uh, yeah, I think it was early, early in the year, maybe late last year.
920180	921180	Here's how I'm going to put it.
921180	927940	I'm going to put it as Animal Crossing first and then Breath of the Wild, um, because that's
927940	931820	still, you know, just beautiful and way at the top of the list.
931820	933620	And I'm going to say P.O.P.O.
933620	934620	Championships.
934620	935580	All right.
935580	938140	That's her list and you can't do anything about it.
938140	939140	Yeah.
939140	940700	Um, let's see.
941220	942220	Let's see.
942220	943220	Uh, yeah.
943220	945840	And some, some other folks in chat are kind of like confirming like, yeah, I kind of went
945840	948300	to a lot of my old go-tos as well.
948300	950820	Quest Buster's talking about Gyros warps to Neptune.
950820	951820	No, no, no.
951820	956960	It's always about, you have to get to Neptune so that it's three warps to Uranus.
956960	959180	You have to get that far in the game.
959180	960180	That's the legendary part.
960180	961180	Three warps.
961180	962180	How far is a warp?
962180	963180	I don't know.
963180	967020	Um, anyway, and some folks just talking about some of their comfort games for the year.
967020	968020	Okay.
968020	969840	Um, Loki, how about your list?
969840	973220	You have, you have comfort games on your list or what, how does your 2020 best stuff
973220	975960	shaped up, shape up?
975960	983840	Um, so I've got, let's see, hotshots racing.
983840	987640	That was a pretty fun one because it was kind of like a nineties arcade racer game.
987640	990720	So that was definitely, um, up there.
990720	998880	Uh, gosh, it was hard to decide with like my top three, probably I'd say, um, I don't
998920	999920	know.
999920	1001840	Final fantasy seven was all right, but I never finished it.
1001840	1006760	The remake, um, half-life Alex, I think made more of an impact.
1006760	1007760	I think on me.
1007760	1010680	Cause I thought it was just a really excellent VR game.
1010680	1016400	Um, so half-life Alex, and then of course, cyberpunk 2077, even though it's a buggy mess,
1016400	1017960	but it's still a great game.
1017960	1019600	When does that ever bothered you?
1019600	1020800	It doesn't.
1020800	1021800	Yeah.
1021800	1025880	It just adds to it actually, as long as it doesn't break the game where I can't play
1025880	1027880	it, then I really don't care.
1028200	1033400	Uh, are you, are you purposely putting bugs into, into your, your game?
1033400	1035280	Not purposely, but there's stuff.
1035280	1041040	I know where the bugs are and there's some, some that I can't do anything about and some
1041040	1048200	that maybe my, my rainbow effect caused more problems for, but, uh, you know, that's fine.
1048200	1051440	But no, I'm not purposely putting bugs in the game.
1051440	1056200	Um, orange right is a kind of a green kind of, kind of with a hybrid here of what Jamie
1056200	1060480	and Loki have both said, saying I pretty much stuck to retro games and games that were on
1060480	1061880	my backlog pile.
1061880	1065760	Only 2020 games I really played were animal crossing and hotshot racing.
1065760	1069800	So it's been mainly Minecraft this year again.
1069800	1074000	So it's like, I can't, I can't really do that again, but yeah.
1074000	1078440	Well then I think that's been an important one for you to entertain the kids too, which
1078440	1082920	is something a lot of people are going through in the pandemic is how do I entertain my kids
1082920	1087720	all day, every day when I was used to school being a part of this and outdoor stuff and
1087720	1091160	go going over to someone else's house, you know, that thing it's, it's, that's all been
1091160	1092160	disrupted this year.
1092160	1096080	Well, I finally got a discord set up for my son and his friends.
1096080	1101040	So now that they can, they can chat now with each other, which has been like, he's really
1101040	1102040	enjoyed that.
1102040	1107400	So they're, they're playing like among us and stuff, um, and Roblox doing that.
1107400	1108400	So that's kind of fun.
1108400	1109400	Fun.
1109400	1110400	Nice.
1110400	1111400	All right.
1111400	1112840	So here's the plot to my top three.
1112840	1113840	So here we go.
1113840	1118440	And honestly, like I, I'm kind of with you guys in the sense that like, if you asked
1118440	1122240	me to give a number four, I'm not sure I could give one.
1122240	1129440	Um, I just kind of feel like I have three and then like you guys, Final Fantasy 14,
1129440	1134280	that's my comfort food and continues to be like the social interaction that I get with
1134280	1138240	other people, you know, being able to play with, you know, my friend Shane and my friend
1138240	1142480	Ray and the people that I've played that game with online for a while now, it's, it's
1142480	1144060	a good social thing.
1144060	1149840	So like, honestly, that should be in my top three, but it's not, I did go with games that
1149840	1153320	came out this year just because I did play enough that I did think were that good.
1153320	1154320	So here we go.
1154320	1158480	Um, my number three game, I'm going to say the Final Fantasy seven remake.
1158480	1167400	Um, I don't think it's very often that games have so much behind it when it comes to like
1167400	1172240	the hype and being able to live up to those expectations.
1172240	1178000	But I feel like Final Fantasy seven remake did a great job of delivering a quality game.
1178000	1182020	And I think we've seen time and time again where sometimes that bar gets raised so high,
1182020	1185720	the games can't really meet it and they end up, you know, getting a lot of backlash with
1185720	1186720	that.
1186720	1188840	I didn't feel that at all with Final Fantasy seven.
1188840	1191240	Did I have some minor complaints about the game?
1191240	1192240	Sure.
1192240	1195880	I think a lot of people did, but did I feel like I was getting an experience worthy of
1195880	1202080	being like Final Fantasy 16, um, not to be confused with the actual Final Fantasy 16
1202080	1203480	that got announced this year.
1203480	1207560	But did I feel like I was playing the next iteration of a Final Fantasy game with some
1207560	1208560	familiar characters?
1208560	1210020	Yes, I did.
1210020	1215680	And I have to, and the one thing I really wasn't expecting, I was ready to be pissed
1215680	1221160	about the story to not like to, to, to be like, why did they make just the mid guard
1221160	1225560	section of the, I almost said mid guard somewhere, the mid guard section of the game, the entire
1225560	1227680	first game, why did they do that?
1227680	1233680	But I think the game throughout its paces justified what they did.
1233680	1238240	And without spoiling the ending and getting into the ending, I found the ending to be
1238240	1247500	something where I was like, damn, that was not what I expected, but that's great.
1247500	1250040	And you know, really kind of leaves the door open for what's next.
1250120	1255200	And I do think a lot of people are going to revisit this game this year in 2021.
1255200	1259040	I know we're going to do predictions next week, but I can already tell you, I will absolutely
1259040	1265780	predict there will be a Final Fantasy 7 remaster plus International Edition we'll say, or something
1265780	1270760	like that, that will come with maybe a couple extra fights in the, in the section of the
1270760	1277420	game where you can kind of pick fights, maybe another limited chapter, maybe allowing more
1277420	1281700	control of one character who you never get to control later on in the game.
1281700	1288140	I see some doors available to open a little bit to make just that Final Fantasy 7 plus
1288140	1292940	in the way that you got Final Fantasy 12, the Zodiac Age, and Final Fantasy 10 International
1292940	1295500	and sometimes they do it with Kingdom Hearts.
1295500	1300580	And maybe if you beat it, like Kingdom Hearts, if you beat it all and you get that, you know,
1300580	1308700	perfect run of the game, maybe an extra scene that will start to lead into chapter two of
1308700	1310860	the Final Fantasy 7 remake.
1310860	1314380	And I really believe that's going to come this year because we're going to have the
1314380	1317060	end of the Xbox exclusive window.
1317060	1319900	So I don't see why Square wouldn't want to release the game there.
1319900	1322820	And if they're going to do it there, they're going to do a version that's optimized for
1322820	1327180	the X and the S. They're going to do a PC version that's in tandem with that, which
1327180	1329820	means yay mods for that crowd.
1329820	1333780	And then of course, the PlayStation 5 is going to need a version to bring that up to parody.
1333780	1338860	So I fully anticipate there will be a Final Fantasy 7 plus international edition, something
1338860	1341300	along those lines for holiday this year.
1341300	1345140	If not holiday this year, certainly next year.
1345140	1349460	But I think when the Xbox exclusive window kind of runs out, I think they're going to
1349460	1351900	be itching for their own version of that game.
1351900	1357020	So I was going to say so I have a check because I couldn't remember exactly when I downloaded
1357020	1363860	the app, but apparently it was very almost a 20 20 when I downloaded Orna.
1363860	1368780	So I definitely have to add Orna to the list as well, because I mean, that was pretty much
1368780	1370000	this entire year.
1370000	1371140	So I'll allow it.
1371140	1372140	You're right.
1372140	1373900	I'm totally ignoring my GPS game thing.
1373900	1375780	Orna, Ingress, Pogo, all of it.
1375780	1377900	I'm kind of ignoring it.
1377900	1381540	But yeah, I think those were very important this year as well.
1381540	1388860	Speaking in chat, DJ Rama S theorizes, Rob, expect the Xbox version to be a digital release
1388860	1389860	only.
1389860	1391300	I'm curious more why you think that is.
1391300	1395300	Is that like a supply issue or is that is it going to be on Game Pass?
1395300	1397660	Maybe not there.
1397660	1402600	And Phoenix 7726 says, God, no, please finish the saga first.
1402600	1404620	Leave the milking to EA or Activision.
1404620	1406300	Kingdom Hearts was bad enough with that.
1406300	1407680	I hear you, Phoenix.
1407680	1409620	It's not that I disagree.
1409620	1417060	It's just this whole now PlayStation 5 and Xbox X and S are the new thing.
1417060	1423620	And I just I can't I don't see why Square wouldn't take the opportunity to try to milk
1423620	1425740	another.
1425740	1427580	Maybe they won't go 60 bucks.
1427580	1429380	Maybe they'll go down to 40.
1429380	1431260	But they'll definitely try to milk for more money.
1431260	1435180	So are we going to get Crisis Core and Dirge of Cerberus in there?
1435180	1437260	Yeah, I fucking hope not.
1437260	1442140	Like, get get to work on part two, the whip like it's we're ready for it.
1442140	1446540	But anyway, they need to take the approach of Activision, where they have like five different
1446540	1453660	companies working on one property and they just keep churning out more content for it.
1453660	1458340	And Dijarama is saying Squeenix did it with Kingdom Hearts and Nier Automata.
1458340	1462780	Every exclusive release the PS4s have from Square Enix ends up as a digital release on
1462780	1464060	Xbox a year later.
1464060	1465060	All right.
1465060	1466060	I didn't think about that.
1466060	1469740	I thought Kingdom Hearts had a disc version, but maybe I'm wrong.
1469740	1470740	All right.
1470740	1474620	OK, so that was my number three game Final Fantasy 7 remake.
1474620	1476500	My number two game.
1476500	1478140	This may come as a surprise.
1478140	1481780	My number two game for the year, I'm going to say, is Hades.
1481780	1483940	Hades.
1483940	1491860	It's it's it's cool because Hades is almost in a way like the antithesis of the Final
1491860	1501260	Fantasy 7 remake because you have Final Fantasy 7, the big game, the huge game and all this
1501260	1502580	stuff that comes out.
1502580	1507620	And then Hades is like this this indie game that comes out of nowhere almost.
1507620	1513740	I mean, yes, it had the hype from the, you know, the lead up and all that stuff with
1513740	1515460	the early access.
1515460	1521700	But again, I still I really think Hades kind of came through because of the Switch release
1521740	1523500	and that's what really put it on everybody's radar.
1523500	1525820	So I do really consider it at least that was for me.
1525820	1533460	I do consider it a 2020 game, but it's like this little indie game that did amazing.
1533460	1537260	And Hades.
1537260	1543380	Tells a story with very familiar characters, and it has a game in a very familiar type
1543380	1548600	of game that's been a very controversial genre for a long time, the roguelike.
1548600	1557400	But it does all of these things so well that it doesn't need the bells and whistles of
1557400	1565720	2020 graphics, 2020 flair and the things we would expect from PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series
1565720	1566720	X.
1566720	1574600	It's just a really good game with really great voice acting, really great story and really
1574600	1580480	great mechanics that is absolutely worth your time and quite stellar and one of the
1580480	1581480	best games of the year.
1581480	1585360	And if you're afraid of Hades because you don't like roguelikes, I would really urge
1585360	1590760	you to take a step back and give this one a different go because it does things differently
1590760	1593000	than other roguelikes have before.
1593000	1599220	And it doesn't build on itself quite the same way that other roguelikes have done before.
1599220	1604220	It's a little bit slower, and that's actually a good thing, I think, the way it does it
1604220	1606020	and a little more limited.
1606020	1610940	And I think that really allows you to experience the story in a full way.
1610940	1618020	And Shane is in chat this year and going after me saying, I have wrong opinions about Hades.
1618020	1619860	Nothing was better than Hades this year.
1619860	1621060	Not even the new Frog Fractions.
1621060	1622620	Oh, I forgot about that one.
1622620	1623620	Maybe honorable mentions.
1624020	1629180	Sia Tabiri says, you forgot incredible and thirst inducing art.
1629180	1633660	Shane continues, the game underneath is amazing and the writing and music and voice acting
1633660	1635380	are all great.
1635380	1636820	Honestly, no lies.
1636820	1640100	And is number two really that bad of a spot?
1640100	1641540	I don't think it is.
1641540	1643360	And it's really close.
1643360	1650960	And I did do a last minute switcheroo because I really sat back and I thought about the
1650960	1653920	games that came out this year and like what they've meant and so forth.
1653920	1661560	So that being said, my number one game of the year is Animal Crossing.
1661560	1665340	And that might surprise you because I talked about how I kind of took a break from Animal
1665340	1674120	Crossing for a little bit, but I just don't think, here's the thing, and maybe this is
1674120	1677080	how I play Kate Shane a little bit too, but no, this is my honest answer.
1677080	1678820	This is about, you know, making anyone happy.
1678820	1681540	I said it's my list and you can take it or leave it.
1681540	1688180	I think in any other year, if this was 2019, if this is 2018, I think yes, Hades is number
1688180	1692860	one and Animal Crossing, I'm not even sure makes the top three, maybe number three.
1692860	1702220	I think because of what 2020 did to all of us and I think because of what this year has
1702220	1710340	done to our culture, I think Animal Crossing provided that escape that we desperately needed.
1710340	1714940	And sure, there's lots of games with great storylines, whether Hades, Final Fantasy,
1714940	1718580	Cyberpunk, that maybe was the escape for you as well.
1718580	1724140	But I think the things that Animal Crossing brought us with the virtual graduations, when
1724140	1732000	you couldn't have a graduation in person, with the, my birthday, of course, your birthday,
1732000	1741040	the ability to visit friends when you otherwise can't, I think has been so meaningful in this
1741040	1750560	shit year that Animal Crossing, like, I think helped many of us get through this god-awful
1750560	1751720	year.
1751720	1758780	And so I think honestly, for those reasons, it deserves the kudos as the game that best
1758780	1761060	represents 2020.
1761060	1762780	And that's what it's about.
1762780	1768380	So I thought about that for a long time, like, but I think when I was really thinking about
1768380	1773600	like what, what did the games that came out this year like really mean and what really
1773600	1779120	embodies what 2020 was, what is a symbol of this year?
1779120	1781600	I really truly think it's Animal Crossing.
1781600	1784740	And obviously, Jamie, I'm sure you have no problem hearing this.
1784740	1788660	You are probably the opposite of Shane here in this regard.
1788660	1792340	But I know you and I have talked about this at length.
1792340	1794640	And we talked about it here on this show.
1794640	1796480	And we even did an Animal Crossing.
1796480	1802900	We did a special OLR that was about, and Loki, does that video, does that video have boobies
1802900	1803900	in it?
1803900	1805300	You got to be careful with the Twitch guidelines.
1805300	1808020	No, it's hazy.
1808020	1809020	It's Saints Row.
1809020	1810020	All right.
1810020	1811020	Just look out.
1811020	1812020	All right.
1812020	1813020	No nudity.
1813020	1814020	All right.
1814020	1815020	Anyway, sorry.
1815020	1817900	There's no, there's no nudity in that game.
1818140	1823860	So, um, but, um, Jamie, you know, we've kind of talked about this at length is, is about
1823860	1828380	like, I think, I think it was like the therapy that like so many people kind of needed this
1828380	1829380	year.
1829380	1830380	It really was.
1830380	1831380	Yeah.
1831380	1838060	It just, it, it was there for, I don't know, it just gave people a special kind of outlet
1838060	1841100	and a great distraction that was in a safe place.
1841100	1842100	Yeah.
1842100	1844180	You know, it was very safe.
1844180	1849060	And I'm going to tell you the moment I realized that I needed to change my list actually.
1849060	1854960	And the moment I realized I needed to change my list was New Year's Eve and watching that
1854960	1861560	people were more interested in New Year's Eve on what was going on in their Animal Crossing
1861560	1862560	towns.
1862560	1866020	And this goes far beyond even just the audience of this show.
1866020	1869880	I'm talking about, you know, generally what I saw on social media and everything.
1869880	1873120	There was more interest in what was going on in people's Animal Crossing towns than
1873120	1878040	there was going on in, in Times Square and any of that on TV and so forth.
1878040	1885440	And I think that's just a sign of, of everything of 2020.
1885440	1889980	So I also, I'm also very appreciative that Nintendo has still continued to support the
1889980	1892040	game as strongly as it has.
1892040	1896280	So anyway, I'm going to other comments.
1896280	1900480	As Jonah and Matt says, Rob distracted by strippers, it happened.
1900820	1905480	Shane in chat says Animal Crossing was great, not to crap on it at all and probably deserve
1905480	1907800	somewhere in the top five for sure.
1907800	1910120	And that's it.
1910120	1911700	Everybody's going to have a different list.
1911700	1916060	And even though I gave my three, it's probably not going to match anyone else's three.
1916060	1917060	And that's okay.
1917060	1919920	There are games I didn't get around to playing this year.
1919920	1924380	Last of Us Part Two, which many people have been hyping up, didn't get around to playing
1924380	1930240	it this year because it's the zombie gore stuff that I'm a little...
1930240	1932880	Although people are telling me I need to give it a rest and try it already.
1932880	1935980	So maybe that's a 2021 thing, we'll see.
1935980	1939900	Ghost of Tsushima is another one I just haven't gotten around to yet that I understand is
1939900	1941520	very good as well.
1941520	1947080	And there's plenty of others, but I think everything we all collectively named and many
1947080	1950840	of your favorites as well are worth playing.
1950840	1955720	And honestly, it's funny because he keeps changing his name.
1955720	1956720	What's his name now?
1956720	1959040	No one's special 77 in chat.
1959040	1960040	He always changes his name.
1960040	1961040	Okay.
1961040	1962040	I just have to keep track.
1962040	1963040	So is it...
1963040	1964040	What Nader?
1964040	1965040	Is it...
1965040	1966040	Okay.
1966040	1967040	Oh, yes.
1967040	1972800	No one's special 77 asked us last week, what are the worst games of the year?
1972800	1975820	I don't think I played any.
1975820	1980040	I don't think I played any game where I was like, this is bad.
1980040	1983840	And what's funny later in the show, we're going to talk about what some websites said
1983840	1984840	were bad.
1984840	1987060	And there's actually a game that I played that's on it.
1987080	1990780	And I'm not sure I would call it that bad.
1990780	1995480	And I'm just not sure it was a year for crap games, but maybe because of everything else
1995480	1999940	we've talked about before, we kind of got to where we talked about retro games being
1999940	2005540	the comfort blanket, MMOs being that comfort food, whatever it is that you're into as your
2005540	2008000	comfort games.
2008000	2011300	Maybe we just didn't have time for the bad shit because of all that.
2011300	2012300	I don't know.
2012300	2016240	Or maybe just maybe we're just not as critical of the games and all that, but I tried to
2016240	2018320	give it some real good thought.
2018320	2020480	I don't have any bad games this year.
2020480	2021480	I really don't.
2021480	2024680	I don't know if you guys do, but.
2024680	2028080	I can't think of anything.
2028080	2030820	Yeah, I really can't either.
2030820	2036040	I mean, like I said, I've really just been sticking to the stuff that I like or that
2036040	2038320	I know that I like.
2038320	2042800	I mean, Pixel Poops has crap.
2042800	2043800	That's crappy.
2043800	2045080	That's going to be in my 2021 list for sure.
2045080	2050920	No, I will say right now, Pixel Poops, due to the conflict of interest and that I am
2050920	2057680	a responsible gaming commentator on a podcast out of my spare bedroom, I will not be placing
2057680	2059000	Pixel Poops on my top three.
2059000	2060000	It is ineligible.
2060000	2061720	There's a conflict of interest there.
2061720	2067320	So because I'll put it on my top, Jamie's like, I'll take that.
2067320	2068320	I'll take it.
2068320	2069480	All right.
2069480	2072040	That game is going to get enough promotion here on this show.
2072040	2073040	Number 3.5.
2073040	2074040	All right.
2074040	2075040	Number 3.5.
2075040	2076040	Questbuster.
2076040	2077040	Actually.
2077040	2079040	Oh, go ahead.
2079040	2082920	I will actually go back and say that maybe the game that pissed me off the most this
2082920	2086320	last year was Cuphead because fuck, it's hard.
2086320	2087320	It is.
2087320	2090880	Yep, it is Questbuster in chat says Avengers have a good
2090880	2094240	has a good campaign, but the rest of it was bad.
2094240	2098160	Shane is saying Ori 2 as far as good games go or in the will of the wisps.
2098160	2100360	Don't forget that.
2100360	2101360	Great call out.
2101360	2107440	Another game that isn't on my list because I refuse to play it until I beat Ori in the
2107440	2112560	Blind Forest, the first one, and like a lot of games, I ended up playing that for like
2112560	2113560	four hours.
2113560	2119240	Then I was like, shiny, and went somewhere else, squirrel, and went somewhere else.
2119240	2126040	It happens, but God, the first game is probably on one of my most played games of this year
2126040	2127200	for sure.
2127200	2130320	So all right.
2130320	2131320	Great discussion, you guys.
2131320	2132680	A lot of good games out there.
2132680	2136800	So those are that's some insight into our top games of 2020.
2136800	2138160	All right.
2138160	2139720	Let's take a look now.
2139720	2143560	So sitting here and it's probably hard to see on camera, but sitting here, I have this
2143560	2149200	little silly Darth Vader coin bank thing and I, I don't know.
2149200	2151880	I don't know why it's not I know why it's in my house.
2151880	2157240	It was it was a lovely gift, but it is turned into the time capsule that we have here at
2157240	2160960	OLR that our predictions go into every year.
2160960	2166400	We will be making predictions for 2021 next week on the show because I kind of think it's
2166400	2167920	going to be a slow week next week as well.
2167920	2170160	So we're going to kind of do it virtually.
2170160	2173600	And I'll just write everything down to the other say, since we can't really do our own
2173600	2175220	all in the same place.
2175220	2179640	But I thought tonight we could take a look back at what is in the tin from last year,
2179640	2183900	which I was convinced there's nothing in it, but I peeked just to see is anything in there.
2183900	2187280	And there's like, there's like three slips of paper in it.
2187280	2189300	So I don't know if somebody snuck things in when I wasn't looking.
2189300	2192340	Maybe you put stuff in there and then, and then we forgot.
2192340	2195100	No, I think that we did it all right.
2195100	2198460	Or maybe we never answered it this year or last year.
2198460	2199460	Well, you know what?
2199460	2200460	I'm opening it.
2200460	2201460	Here we go.
2201460	2202460	I'm going to pull them out.
2202460	2203460	Here we go.
2203460	2208500	This one says, okay, this looks like Loki's handwriting.
2208500	2210900	Oh, maybe I threw stuff back in there.
2210900	2211900	You probably did.
2211900	2213700	You probably snuck your own shit in there.
2213700	2214940	All right.
2214940	2223540	EA will close BioWare after Anthem underperforms due to EA shittiness, i.e. loot boxes.
2223540	2224540	Well.
2224540	2226620	No, they haven't done that.
2226620	2229020	Anthem has underperformed.
2229020	2230020	We still-
2230020	2231780	Bounce back with the stuff that they rely on.
2231780	2232780	Yeah.
2232780	2233780	Yeah.
2233780	2237940	I think, I think that's a good point is that BioWare is definitely leaning on the wheelhouse
2237940	2241280	that they know will perform for them, namely Mass Effect.
2241280	2244400	And I think a lot of us were worried about what was going to happen when Mass Effect
2244400	2248120	after Andromeda seemed to get a lukewarm reception.
2248120	2252280	But I think Mass Effect has heard loud and clear, or excuse me, BioWare has heard loud
2252280	2257480	and clear that Mass Effect going back to its roots would make everybody very happy.
2257480	2262560	And so now we know we're getting the remaster, you know, finally next year, it's official.
2262560	2266400	And except there won't be multiplayer, so no loot boxes, Loki.
2266400	2271200	And we know we have that new mystery Mass Effect game that's probably years and years
2271200	2272200	out.
2272200	2274080	And of course, Dragon Age as well.
2274080	2278440	Still kind of is still really thin on what we know about that game.
2278440	2281560	But hopefully, hopefully soon.
2281560	2286220	And then Quest Buster does point out Casey Hudson and Mark Darragh left BioWare.
2286220	2289100	In Hudson's case, he left again.
2289100	2292320	And Shane is saying, I can't wait for him to come back a third time and leave a third
2292320	2293320	time.
2293320	2298240	That's like that's like I'm sorry, I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to go there and
2298240	2302600	I'm not going to apologize for it, but that's that's like watching Trump lose the recount
2302600	2306960	over and over in every state.
2306960	2307960	He tried again.
2307960	2310240	We're doing it's election night all over.
2310240	2313600	And he lost again.
2313600	2314600	Let's go to the next slip.
2314600	2315600	All right.
2315600	2317120	Another one of those, by the way.
2317120	2318120	What's that?
2318120	2322080	I'm still waiting for another time for him to lose, you know, before the day.
2322080	2323080	January 6th.
2323080	2325440	Anyway, this is the last slip.
2325440	2327640	There was two slips in there.
2327640	2330720	This is it.
2330720	2335000	I think this might be Jamie's handwriting because it's not mine.
2335000	2339480	And it says still no Half-Life 3.
2339480	2341480	That was me.
2341480	2344160	Well, we got Half-Life, Alex.
2344160	2345160	I know.
2345160	2346160	I was going to say Half-Life.
2346160	2347700	That's not a three.
2347700	2349020	It's not.
2349020	2350760	That's in the two area.
2351480	2353480	I would say this is mixed.
2353480	2359320	I agree that on its technical, literal purposes, the prediction is correct.
2359320	2361520	There is still no Half-Life 3.
2361520	2368760	However, I would be remiss to think that Half-Life, Alex, was not internally thought of at some
2368760	2371840	point to potentially be Half-Life 3.
2371840	2377000	Somewhere along the way, they said two things.
2377000	2381640	Number one, doing it as a VR exclusive is not going to have the effect we want it to
2381640	2382680	have.
2382680	2385300	So I think they pulled back for that reason.
2385300	2391200	Number two, I think if they'd called it Half-Life 3, people were going to have the expectations
2391200	2393520	that go with Half-Life 3.
2393520	2398560	And no matter what Valve did, they were never going to be able to live up to it.
2398560	2404560	And so I kind of think for that reason, we got Half-Life, Alex.
2404560	2407320	I don't think we ever will get a Half-Life 3.
2407320	2412280	I think if we get Half-Life, it's going to be continuing Half-Life stories kind of like
2412280	2414120	what we got with Half-Life, Alex.
2414120	2416520	But that's another one of those games where if you want to go back to the best games of
2416520	2423440	the year, people that have played it, and especially VR enthusiasts, absolutely have
2423440	2425360	it in their top.
2425360	2427320	And you mentioned it, Loki, to be fair.
2427320	2431640	It is absolutely a stunning piece of game.
2431640	2435760	I haven't gotten around to playing it myself because I only have PlayStation VR.
2435760	2438100	But I'm super curious about it.
2438100	2442080	They need to do some version of that game, though, that people who can't play VR games
2442080	2444560	can play.
2444560	2449520	I think there was a mod that someone made to make it so that you could do without VR,
2449520	2451680	but it's not good.
2451680	2455880	I think there will be Half-Life games like that.
2455880	2461040	I don't think they will do Half-Life, Alex, like that because...
2461040	2465840	You can watch a video or anything because it makes me so sick.
2465840	2466840	It's a lot.
2466840	2469920	The motion is a lot.
2469920	2480840	And yeah, it's interesting to see how there's been some VR games like Doom, I think, and
2480840	2484920	even No Man's Sky has something like this because Doom is so fast paced.
2484920	2488260	If I remember right, Doom was all about teleporting.
2488260	2489260	You don't move.
2489260	2490260	That's not right.
2491260	2492900	That's how Half-Life, Alex, works.
2492900	2493900	It's teleporting.
2493900	2495900	Oh, I thought it was all like motion.
2495900	2496900	Oh, okay.
2496900	2499320	Well, that's good.
2499320	2501780	It did seem like it was going like in everything I've seen.
2501780	2502780	It's like moving very fast.
2502780	2506860	You can teleport quickly, but you know, yeah, it's all teleporting.
2506860	2507860	Yeah.
2507860	2508860	Interesting.
2508860	2512860	All right.
2512860	2516140	See Bobby in chat says they would have to change the game way too much to get it to
2516140	2517500	not work in VR.
2517500	2520020	Yeah, I think it would end up being like a...
2520020	2523140	And that's kind of like where I'm getting at is that at that point it would be a different
2523140	2524140	game.
2524140	2529340	And I'm not saying they shouldn't do that, but I do understand that like not every puzzle,
2529340	2532980	not every element is going to be able to translate.
2532980	2533980	And that's...
2533980	2534980	Yeah.
2534980	2535980	Let's see.
2535980	2538620	What else do I want to mention here in chat?
2538620	2544020	Pele Hanumea talking about what I said about Half-Life 3 and why you nailed it, Rob.
2544020	2547840	And Bobby says Valve will never release a game called Half-Life 3.
2547840	2549140	They would be stupid to do so.
2549140	2551340	It will 100% disappoint.
2551340	2556500	And I think that is exactly where Half-Life is right now.
2556500	2562340	I think the game we should be asking about, and Jamie can agree with me on this, I believe,
2562340	2564020	is Portal.
2564020	2565500	Where's Portal 3?
2565500	2569900	Or some continuing story in that universe, which technically is the Half-Life universe.
2569900	2572800	I don't see them taking Portal to VR.
2572800	2574820	I think that would be a bit much.
2574820	2575820	Not?
2575820	2576820	My God.
2577700	2579340	I'm okay with most VR things.
2579340	2583820	I think even that in VR would be too much.
2583820	2586100	But I would love to see that universe continue.
2586100	2587580	But I'm worried it's the same thing.
2587580	2590340	They'll never put out a game called Portal 3 because it would never live up to the hype
2590340	2591340	of 2.
2591340	2592340	So.
2592340	2594700	If they did it, they wouldn't put like 3 in the name.
2594700	2598700	It would be like called like Portal the other side or something.
2598700	2601860	Portal, all your cake and eat it too or something like that.
2601860	2602860	Something with it.
2602860	2603860	I don't know.
2603860	2604860	I would love to see that.
2604900	2606420	Honestly, for me personally, I'd love to-
2606420	2608420	Portal the edible edition.
2608420	2609420	Portal the edibles.
2609420	2610420	Or Portal the edibles.
2610420	2611420	That's it.
2611420	2612420	That's it.
2612420	2615420	They make a phone version and call it Port-Portal-able.
2615420	2617420	Portal portable potables.
2617420	2620100	Stop stealing our ideas, by the way.
2620100	2622100	This is all of us.
2622100	2624100	Copyright, Rob and Jamie.
2624100	2625100	Patent pending.
2625100	2626100	O-L-R 2021.
2626100	2627100	Alright.
2627100	2628100	So, yeah.
2628100	2629100	Dot com.
2629100	2634660	I would love to return to that universe more than Half-Life personally, but I get it.
2634660	2639100	The hype for something like that would be very, very real.
2639100	2643140	But I think it would still- I don't think there's gonna be an E3 this year.
2643140	2649060	Or if there is, it's gonna be like a scaled down event like it was in years past where
2649060	2651500	you have to show your vaccine green card or something to get in.
2651500	2652500	I don't know.
2652500	2653740	We're still so far off.
2653740	2655140	It's hard to say where the world's gonna be at.
2655140	2659760	But I still have that fantasy of Gabe Newell doing the press conference where he comes
2659760	2665600	out on stage and says, Half-Life 3 out today and then drops the mic and the ceiling opens
2665600	2668320	and a bunch of mics drop on the ceiling.
2668320	2673040	I still have that fantasy in my mind, but I would- that would completely be an acceptable
2673040	2675820	meme with Portal 3 as well.
2675820	2681960	If he came out on stage and said, Portal 3 out today, boom.
2681960	2684960	I would be totally alright with that.
2684960	2686040	Alright.
2686040	2689000	So that was our predictions for the year.
2689000	2690440	We kept it short.
2690440	2691840	How apropro.
2691840	2695480	Anyway, we will do some new predictions next week.
2695480	2698920	So y'all be thinking about that since I'm doing them virtually.
2698920	2702520	We'll probably throw in a couple listener suggestions.
2702520	2704360	So be on the lookout for that.
2704360	2708800	Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing
2708800	2713160	this week, which may overlap with our games of the year.
2713160	2714160	I don't know.
2714160	2716680	I have some different things I can talk about, but let's get into our gaming weeks.
2716680	2717680	We'll start with Dark Sakura.
2717680	2718680	How was your gaming week?
2718680	2720680	I played Animal Crossing.
2720680	2721680	Of course.
2721680	2729120	I played, you know, some Poppin' Twinbee because I mean, it's just a fun little shooter.
2729120	2735280	I mean, everyone needs to go on the Nintendo online and play Poppin' Twinbee, end of story.
2735280	2745360	Also, I actually picked up Okami HD because there's like a Capcom sale going on on the
2745360	2751040	Switch store or Nintendo store or whatever the crap they call it.
2751040	2753640	And I don't have room to download it.
2753640	2758640	We have something wrong with our card that we have on our Switch right now.
2758640	2764200	But yeah, I've just been pretty much in the retro gaming mode, getting stuff setting up
2764200	2771000	to finally start streaming again now that things are working out better, got a few things
2771000	2776000	on Steam that I'm going to play.
2776000	2778480	Looking at a few things anyway that I was going to throw onto the list.
2778480	2781600	So we'll see what happens.
2781600	2788040	But yeah, if anyone has a suggestion, look in my library and let me know what you think
2788040	2791360	you'd want to see me play because I ain't buying anything unless you want to buy it
2791360	2793360	for me.
2793360	2796000	All right.
2796000	2798840	There's a couple more days left on that sale.
2799840	2801560	All right.
2801560	2802560	Loki, how about you?
2802560	2804920	How was your gaming week?
2804920	2809720	It's been mainly just I was rushing to get the demo done for Pixel Poops 2.
2809720	2813120	So that was the majority of the week.
2813120	2820200	Aside from that, though, then I did play a bit more of Minecraft with the kids on our
2820200	2821200	realms.
2821200	2825680	So we were building or still are building a lighthouse.
2825680	2827560	And so that's been quite the endeavor.
2827560	2833840	And then Orna and yeah, that's about it.
2833840	2834840	All right.
2834840	2836440	My gaming week.
2836440	2840600	Outside of the things I already talked about, because I talked about Pixel Poops number
2840600	2843600	2 and GPS gaming is always a thing.
2843600	2844880	I see a zet in chat.
2844880	2847040	Shout out.
2847040	2850280	And yeah, GPS gaming is always a thing, of course.
2850280	2854640	But outside of those, I have now I want to know if Shane was still listening, although
2854640	2858520	it looks like he may have rage quit after hearing the top games.
2858520	2860120	I don't know where he has it on the background.
2860120	2861120	Who knows?
2861120	2863560	But I will say this to earn Shane's favor back.
2863560	2870040	I will say one game I played quite a bit yesterday was I played DJ Max on Steam because I did
2870040	2872120	buy it in the sale.
2872120	2876560	And I invoke Shane there because he was nudging me to pick that up already.
2876560	2880040	So I did buy it because I was like, I'm not going to double dip.
2880040	2881320	I'm not going to double dip.
2881320	2882840	But it finally went on sale.
2882840	2883840	It was pretty cheap.
2883840	2890880	I think I paid $24 for an edition that had the base game and two of the expansions that
2890880	2891880	are new.
2891880	2893960	I don't think they were on the PlayStation 4 version.
2893960	2895960	They're on the PC version only.
2895960	2901880	So I picked that one up and then I bought the Clasiquy pack as well, because I had to
2901880	2902880	have that.
2902880	2907280	I can't play DJ Max and not have Flee, okay?
2907280	2908840	So there's that.
2908840	2910400	So yeah, I was playing that.
2910400	2913200	It's so much easier on a keyboard than it is the controller.
2913200	2917400	I'm hoping I can do a live stream coming soon of the game because it's a lot of fun.
2917400	2921000	Hopefully the music in that is okay.
2921000	2925560	There might be the two songs that are new to PC that might be things I have to avoid,
2925560	2929160	but the rest of it should be all right.
2929160	2932360	So there was that.
2932360	2936160	Last week on the show I talked about Tell Me Why, and I played that a little bit.
2936160	2941240	I continued in Tell Me Why this week, and I did get to the end of the first chapter.
2941240	2944280	So I talked about last week, I'm like, I've got to be close.
2944280	2946280	And I was pretty close.
2946280	2952120	I was in the last section, again, I don't want to spoil, but there's the last section
2952120	2955360	that went on for quite some time, and then I was at the end.
2955360	2959520	And I got to say, I think that section started to show some of the weakness of the game to
2959520	2965960	me, is that some of it, the story is really good, and I'm really engaged in a lot of it.
2965960	2971760	And I like the whole, the twins can kind of see each other's memories and things like
2971760	2972760	that.
2972760	2973760	I'm all into that.
2973760	2979400	But the game in between it can sometimes get a little dryer, like I was exploring this
2979400	2981680	office type area, we'll leave it at that.
2981680	2987220	And there was a big puzzle to solve, which did feel rewarding, but it was very like,
2987220	2991240	go here to get the thing to go here, to get the thing to go here, to get the code to go
2991240	2992240	here.
2992240	2999560	It was just these very basic fetch type things, and I still feel very favorably about the
2999560	3005540	game overall, but I was like, okay, I see why maybe this game isn't exactly showing
3005540	3010880	up on year end best list for the critics and that type of thing, is that there are some
3010880	3013160	kind of dry parts in there.
3013160	3019040	Honestly, when I play it, I'm like, this would be such an awesome movie.
3019040	3022800	I'm kind of surprised they didn't just make an Netflix series out of it or something.
3022800	3024880	It's a very compelling story.
3024880	3028100	I would have loved to see like a movie, but I get why it's a game as well.
3028100	3029100	So tell me why.
3029100	3030880	And I'm going to keep playing more of that.
3030880	3034680	Hopefully don't get too distracted because I do want to see where the story goes.
3034680	3038040	Of course, the first part ends with a big twist.
3038040	3039840	I won't spoil.
3039840	3042480	I kind of think you see it coming.
3042480	3045400	I think if you're paying attention, you see it coming.
3045400	3048560	I did, but maybe not.
3048560	3051520	So I'm kind of, you know, there'll probably be a big twist at the end of part two and
3051520	3053280	then it'll all end with a big twist as well.
3053280	3055760	But I thought it was, it was interesting.
3055760	3057360	So all right.
3057360	3059160	Oh, Shane finally came back.
3059160	3060160	Okay, then you missed.
3060160	3063800	So I will repeat once for you because it's the new year and I'm feeling generous.
3063800	3070480	I had DJ Max as part of my gaming week because I finally bought it on Steam yesterday.
3070480	3078360	And I was, I was hoping maybe that would help, help calm you down about the 80s thing.
3078360	3080540	All right.
3080540	3083840	So yeah, I played some DJ Max yesterday.
3083840	3086200	What else would this week?
3086200	3088840	A little bit more Destiny 2.
3088840	3092160	Oh, Halo Dark Sakura.
3092160	3097800	I actually, and ironically played some Halo this week with all the news last week about
3097800	3100480	Halo going away.
3100480	3104960	I remembered that the Master Chief collection was a thing and I wanted to download it and
3104960	3105960	check it out.
3105960	3108520	And so, yeah, I was playing a little bit of the story mode on that.
3108520	3112480	I will say, and I just, I name checked Dark Sakura to give her a hard time.
3112480	3113760	I know she doesn't care for it.
3113760	3114920	That's fine.
3114920	3120180	One thing I like though about the collection is that with a button press, you flip back
3120180	3122780	between the old graphics and the new graphics.
3122780	3130100	And it's really interesting to see what a long way it's come from just the Xbox, which
3130100	3134900	was, you know, wasn't exactly a bad system or, but like, dang, when you hit that button
3134900	3139100	to toggle between like original Halo graphics and the new one, it's like, wow, this game
3139100	3140100	looks so much better.
3140100	3142100	So this is kind of interesting.
3142100	3143100	All right.
3143100	3146660	So then Shane says nothing is going to calm him down.
3146660	3149100	Well, deal with it, I guess.
3149100	3150740	All right.
3150780	3155740	Let's get into some other things real quick and then we're going to get into some gaming
3155740	3156740	news.
3156740	3160900	I do want to mention here at the top and I'll say it towards the end of the show as well.
3160900	3165660	Awesome Games Done Quick is going this week and I know that has your attention as well.
3165660	3170180	It is a fundraising event for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.
3170180	3171660	I hope I got the charity right.
3171660	3176140	I know it is a cancer prevention and research type of charity.
3176140	3180660	And you know, I know a lot of our attention has been focused on COVID this year and understandably
3180660	3183580	so, but that doesn't mean that cancer went away.
3183580	3184580	We still hate it.
3184580	3186020	We still say, fuck cancer.
3186020	3189700	So I think this is a great cause to be raising money for.
3189700	3195460	And so a lot of gamers have gotten together to put on a great display, the Olympics of
3195460	3199580	speed running, if you will, in a way where they go through games very quickly.
3199580	3201400	It's all in the title actually.
3201400	3205660	And they raise a lot of money for charity, hopefully, hopefully another couple million
3205660	3209220	dollars if the last few years have been any expectation.
3209220	3212500	They are not doing it in person this year, of course.
3212500	3213980	You can imagine why.
3213980	3217500	It is another virtual event similar to the summer event, but that doesn't mean it's any
3217500	3218500	less good.
3218500	3220300	The speed runs are still very solid.
3220300	3225260	The little bits that I've seen very, excuse me, engaging.
3225260	3228820	And a lot of the stories from the speed runners are a lot of fun too.
3228820	3233940	VOG Networks very own Bobby Blackwolf will be one of the hosts for some various speed
3233940	3234940	runs.
3234940	3238760	And you can check him out on Wednesday night or afternoon, depending on what time zone
3238760	3239760	you're in.
3239760	3242360	He'll be hosting a speed run of Devil May Cry 3.
3242360	3246000	And right after that, Yakuza 6, I believe it is.
3246000	3250200	And then on Friday night, this is the one I'm most looking forward to that Bobby's hosting
3250200	3257660	is the Super Mario World 2 speed run, Yoshi's Island speed run that he's doing on Friday.
3257660	3258920	And I love that game.
3258920	3260960	So I'm very excited to see that one.
3260960	3263920	And you know, touch fuzzy, get dizzy and all that.
3263920	3267280	Oops, I got the games backwards, sorry.
3267280	3268280	Bobby corrected me.
3268800	3272560	Yoshi's Island is on Wednesday and Yakuza's on Friday.
3272560	3273560	My bad.
3273560	3274560	At least I got the days right.
3274560	3277720	So Bobby will be there on Wednesday and Friday night.
3277720	3281640	We'll be hosting it here at VOG Network when there's no other scheduled programming because
3281640	3284280	we want to support the event as well.
3284280	3287360	And Bobby being involved with it is pretty cool as well.
3287360	3290800	Remember, if you do decide to donate though, it is not about us.
3290800	3292860	It's not about Bobby.
3292860	3296740	It is about the speed runner a little bit, but it's mostly about the charity.
3296740	3300420	So please keep that in mind if you do decide to donate.
3300420	3303540	I think that's all I have for the housekeeping.
3303540	3307020	We'll mention the Game Stunt Quick thing at the end because for those that are watching
3307020	3311580	live here on Twitch TV tonight, we will go host them after the show tonight.
3311580	3315460	I will not be opening it up to request as I usually do.
3315460	3319180	We're just going to raid Awesome Game Stunt Quick because why wouldn't we?
3319180	3324260	All right, so let's get into some gaming news for our week.
3324260	3327980	As slow of a week as it was, right, Loki?
3327980	3330900	Loki, you are muted, just so you know.
3330900	3331900	So we want to...
3331900	3332900	Sorry about that.
3332900	3338080	So unfortunately, this is not something that we're going to be able to enjoy right away.
3338080	3343820	But of course, we've been getting more sneak peeks from the brand new theme park opened
3343820	3346820	up in Japan for Super Nintendo World.
3346820	3354460	And they kind of alluded to it a little bit when they did the whole thing with Miyamoto
3354460	3364380	talking about these brand new power-up bands that you can get the little kind of little
3364380	3369080	things you can interact with different rides and features that are there.
3369080	3374860	So what's kind of cool is they mentioned that you would be able to use these with the Nintendo
3374860	3375860	Switch.
3375900	3377900	And apparently, we now know how that's going to happen.
3377900	3384960	So for example, they sell bands that are themed after Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Daisy
3384960	3385960	and whatnot.
3385960	3392060	And those bands are actually going to also act as amiibos for those specific characters
3392060	3393060	as well.
3393060	3398620	So for example, if you take the Mario power-up band and you scan it on your Nintendo Switch,
3398620	3400060	you get Mario in the game.
3400060	3403120	So it'd be just like you had a Mario amiibo.
3403120	3406960	So that's kind of cool, a little bit additional functionality for those.
3406960	3409160	Now that's only going to work though with the Nintendo Switch.
3409160	3413720	It will not work with the Wii U and 3DS, but it is still pretty cool that they're going
3413720	3419720	to have these kind of NFC points throughout the park that you can use this.
3419720	3425640	Also, there's been some footage leaked of the actual rides as well.
3425640	3430720	So wow, I did see some POV footage of the Yoshi ride.
3430720	3432480	It doesn't really show much of it.
3432480	3438120	It's mostly outdoors and kind of showing some of the stuff decorated around it, but it's
3438120	3439880	definitely very detailed.
3439880	3442680	So hopefully we'll get some more leaks of that soon.
3442680	3448480	I'm very curious to see what the Mario Kart ride looks like, but at the very least, it's
3448480	3449480	cute.
3449480	3450480	The Yoshi ride stuff.
3450480	3455240	I hope it's better than Autotopia.
3455240	3461000	It's very much like the Adventureland stuff that you would see at Disneyland, you know,
3461000	3467080	just the kind of cutesy, you know, where you ride through a dark tunnel type thing and
3467080	3469720	they've got like the Peter Pan ride, that type of stuff.
3469720	3474800	Like the Peter Pan ride or like, you know, I'd say, yeah, it's like a dark ride basically.
3474800	3476760	So it, it looked cute.
3476760	3480960	I mean, um, and it won't, it won't smell like diesel, like Autotopia.
3480960	3481960	Although I think they did.
3481960	3486280	I think they did switch to electric a few years ago, but I, I, I still have memories
3486280	3487600	of Autotopia.
3487600	3488600	You walk over there.
3488600	3490320	It smells like, it smells like diesel.
3490320	3492360	It smells like poison.
3492360	3493360	As of January.
3493360	3495360	No, they have not switched to diesel.
3495360	3496400	It's still all right.
3496400	3498760	They haven't not switched to electric now.
3498760	3499760	Okay.
3499760	3500760	No, no, no, no.
3500760	3501760	All right.
3501760	3503980	It is very clearly running on gas.
3503980	3507560	Maybe they're pumping the diesel fumes out kind of like at the pizza place.
3507560	3509920	They pump the pizza fumes out and other stuff.
3509920	3512320	They both got that stuff.
3512320	3517720	Like I remember cause we took the monorail in, um, you know, back in January we took
3517720	3522880	the monorail in one time and as it's just kind of going by all of the, uh, Autotopia
3522880	3525240	stuff and it is just strong.
3525240	3528320	It is just full on.
3528320	3529320	I forgot.
3529320	3530320	I forgot.
3530320	3532320	You can say you went to Disneyland in 2020.
3532320	3535560	Not a lot of people got lucky there.
3535560	3536560	Yeah.
3536560	3537560	So January.
3537560	3538560	Yeah.
3538560	3539560	Yeah.
3539560	3540680	Not, not this year though.
3540680	3544120	So at least I don't, we're not planning on it.
3544120	3547700	But anyway, the, the band, I mean, speaking of Disney, the band sounds a lot like, like
3547700	3552220	um, I think the Florida parks for Disney have like a magic band type of thing.
3552220	3555900	Um, it was, I think you use it to kind of like do some entry stuff with the parks.
3555900	3558460	I think fast pass is all embedded in that.
3558460	3562340	Now some of you East coasters might know this system better than me cause I still have not
3562340	3566360	been to a Disney world unfortunately, and it's, it's probably going to be some time
3566360	3567360	off to be real.
3567360	3570460	Um, and they have not brought that over to Disneyland yet.
3570460	3575940	Although I would, I would imagine with the Mario, the super Nintendo world, uh, I would
3575980	3581660	imagine this same system that they've got in Japan is, will absolutely be in the Hollywood
3581660	3585600	version and the Orlando version as well whenever they end up launching.
3585600	3589220	And it's going to be just, yeah, it's, it's a similar system to what they've got already
3589220	3594860	in Harry Potter land with, you know, the whole, um, but again, not Hollywood, Hollywood didn't
3594860	3595860	have it.
3595860	3596860	Well, at least not when I was there.
3596860	3598060	No, they have the ones though.
3598060	3600160	So it's similar to that.
3600160	3603580	It's basically different elements that we'll interact with stuff.
3603580	3609620	So it's, it's not F C, but that one's IR, um, but you know, it's same type of thing.
3609620	3614060	It's an object that interacts with stuff or the Disney, the Disney hats, uh, for world
3614060	3616460	of color.
3616460	3617460	Wasn't that a thing?
3617460	3618460	Yeah.
3618460	3623780	They have like hats that interacted with the world of color show hats or they have like,
3623780	3627260	it's those might be like bracelets and stuff that they have with those.
3627260	3631840	I think, um, Disneyland, I wouldn't be, I would be surprised if they switched to that
3631840	3636000	for fast pass because everything right now is done through the app and it's all scanned
3636000	3637000	in and everything.
3637000	3639600	I would think they'd have to rebuild the whole system that that's based on.
3639600	3644040	Um, and I know right now they have their sort of like interactive things that you can do
3644040	3645040	as well.
3645040	3650400	Like I know with, um, the whole star Wars stuff, they've got different things you scan
3650400	3652280	with your phone and whatnot.
3652280	3655880	Um, so they sort of have something similar.
3655880	3659280	They just went different route, um, which is fine.
3659280	3660880	I mean, this looks pretty cool too.
3660920	3663680	So, you know, I'll have to check it out.
3663680	3664680	Yeah.
3664680	3665680	Sounds neat.
3665680	3668240	I, I, I think we all could use the theme park right now.
3668240	3672400	So it's just one of those things where we're trying to look forward to it, um, in the next
3672400	3673400	year.
3673400	3674400	That's for sure.
3674400	3677880	Um, did anything on the bows that you said the ride leaks, was it just the Yoshi ride
3677880	3678880	or did anything on that?
3678880	3679880	Right.
3679880	3680880	Just the Yoshi.
3680880	3685520	So they had like a small clip that peered on Mario Mario cart.
3685520	3688600	I keep thinking of the Bowser statue they have there, but yeah, right.
3688600	3689600	Yeah.
3689640	3695320	They only showed like, there's like a very brief, like kind of video of riding outside
3695320	3696480	in the Yoshi ride.
3696480	3698880	You can hear some of the music playing and everything.
3698880	3702520	They don't really show much of it inside the actual tunnel.
3702520	3706600	Um, and it's like, it's all filmed sideways and stuff.
3706600	3711000	You do see like, there's a link at the very end, it looks like there's Yoshi with baby
3711000	3715720	Mario and there's Kamek in there, um, and baby peach as well.
3715720	3720200	So, I mean, it definitely looks like, you know, one of the dark rides out of Disneyland
3720200	3726400	or something, but, um, it's, it's not shot very well and it's all over the place, but
3726400	3731120	I'm sure once the park opens up for people, you know, you'll get the folks that are filming
3731120	3732680	the POV rides and stuff like that.
3732680	3733960	So you'll be able to see all that.
3733960	3734960	Oh yeah.
3734960	3737240	That, that stuff will hit the internet the next time.
3737240	3738240	Yeah.
3738240	3743120	Well, I'm not too sure though about the Mario cart stuff cause that's AR.
3743120	3746800	So that might be a little bit tougher to do, but we'll see.
3746800	3747800	All right.
3747800	3753640	Well, let's move on and talk about, uh, an undiscovered secret in a video game was discovered
3753640	3759700	this week and the game is near automata, admittedly a game I've got to go back and finish cause
3759700	3765640	I've heard lots of great things about it and a new, uh, interesting part, uh, or interesting
3765640	3766640	thing.
3766640	3768800	I gotta be very vague here cause I don't want to spoil the game for anybody cause I know
3768800	3772800	it did recently come out on Xbox game pass and not everyone's gotten around to it yet.
3772800	3777280	Um, so, um, an interesting element of the game, uh, has kind of unlocked and this has
3777280	3780360	been secret for like three and a half years.
3780360	3785040	In fact, the games developers teased there was one more secret in the game that had gone
3785040	3787760	undiscovered and it was discovered.
3787760	3793400	So what happened is that there was a guy that kind of reverse engineers like cheat codes
3793400	3799320	and stuff, uh, Lance McDonald, uh, a modern, a data miner, uh, found a cheat code that
3799320	3801800	is actually programmed into the game.
3801800	3806080	And I'm going to kind of say this in very vague, simple terms, essentially what it does,
3806080	3811560	it allows you to skip from the first boss fight to the end of the game directly.
3811560	3817600	So it's like a warp ahead and I'm, I'm explaining that in very vague terms on purpose cause
3817600	3819600	I don't want to ruin the game for anybody.
3819600	3823700	Um, but that's basically what this hidden thing does is it's basically full speed ahead
3823700	3825200	to the end of the game.
3825200	3832120	Um, so, uh, the near account, uh, near Twitter account in Japan actually confirmed this is
3832120	3833120	it.
3833120	3834120	This is the final secret.
3834120	3837680	And the games director, Yoko Taro also said, this is the final secret.
3837680	3842760	So, um, that secret they'd been teasing years ago, finally discovered, and it's always kind
3842760	3847480	of neat to hear about games, uh, having their, even if even it was found in somewhat of an
3847480	3848600	unconventional way.
3848600	3849600	So it was a cheat code.
3849600	3852800	They must've been hoping that somebody would put in a button sequence or something.
3852800	3856920	And I wonder if maybe that button sequence wasn't hidden in other elements of the game
3856920	3863880	or something, but somebody used modding tricks, we'll put it plainly, uh, to instead find
3863880	3864880	the code.
3864880	3866480	What do you think about that Loki?
3866480	3872320	Cause I know you do a lot with, uh, you know, hacking around in the games and doing things.
3872320	3875760	You think that's interesting that that's how this final secret was unveiled?
3875760	3880480	Um, it is interesting that they have it kind of done that way.
3880480	3882560	I can't remember.
3882560	3889320	I want to say like, I think the Stanley parable or something like that had a similar type
3889320	3895080	of a cheat code that you could find that, or there was something, some game, I don't
3895080	3899400	remember which one I'm thinking Stanley parable, but there was something where you actually
3899400	3902320	had to go into the game files to figure something out.
3902320	3904700	I think that one is to get an achievement though.
3904700	3907200	You have to actually modify something to get it.
3907920	3913040	But that's kind of cool that they actually have like this cheat code built in.
3913040	3918380	I mean, I know a lot of people build stuff into protesting and whatnot, but, um, three,
3918380	3920480	almost four years after it's been released.
3920480	3921480	That's pretty cool.
3921480	3922480	Yeah.
3922480	3923480	Pretty cool.
3923480	3924480	All right.
3924480	3925480	Let's move on dark Sakura.
3925480	3926480	What do you have for us tonight?
3926480	3932160	I have some stuff and actually it's kind of a neat stuff for people who like, uh, collecting,
3932160	3934800	you know, vinyl records and everything.
3934840	3941360	So, um, mother two, which we got as earthbound over here is having, um, a vinyl release of
3941360	3942360	the soundtrack.
3942360	3948960	Um, it is of course in Japan right now, um, that it will be, uh, released as the orders
3948960	3950360	for it are already out.
3950360	3956560	Um, but it will include 24 songs from the game, a full track listing, um, including,
3956560	3963380	um, different, uh, mixed versions of the music and, uh, for the U S or outside of Japan,
3963380	3965880	you can order it from play Asia.
3965880	3967980	So pretty cool stuff.
3967980	3973100	Um, and it's, it's just really good soundtrack, you know, for a game.
3973100	3975340	So I'd say if you can grab it, grab it.
3975340	3979380	If you like collecting vinyl vinyl, sure.
3979380	3983560	One of those things that is more and more like the collectors go to thing.
3983560	3988060	Like I feel like, you know, 10 years ago, you might have a vinyl soundtrack that's coming
3988060	3991900	out occasionally, but I feel like lately it's been very, very common.
3991900	3995460	Like it's more and more of a collectible, a thing that people pursue.
3995460	3996460	Any interest in this?
3996460	3997460	Yeah.
3997460	3998460	Any interest?
3998460	4000600	I was just saying, any interest in this from you guys?
4000600	4005260	I don't want this one, but I bought the Vibrib in one, I mean, on my wall, I have a couple
4005260	4006600	of weird Al albums.
4006600	4008020	He signed one of them.
4008020	4015140	Um, I have my Xanadu soundtrack on vinyl, so it's like certain things, but I would really
4015140	4016540	dig having a record player.
4016540	4017540	Yeah.
4017540	4021020	Like especially one of those ones that would do it to USB.
4021140	4022140	Yeah.
4022140	4023140	That would be awesome.
4023140	4024140	That would be cool.
4024140	4025140	All right.
4025140	4027340	Uh, do you still have a record player, Loki?
4027340	4030340	I remember when you used to mix stuff live.
4030340	4034060	No, I got rid of that stuff a while ago, so I wasn't using it.
4034060	4036060	So yeah, I don't.
4036060	4037060	All right.
4037060	4043380	Uh, DJRMS in chat says, I have, uh, Scott Pilgrim versus the world, the game OST on
4043380	4044380	vinyl.
4044380	4045380	Woo.
4045380	4046380	All right.
4046380	4049380	Uh, moving on Loki.
4049380	4050380	Yep.
4050740	4056420	Uh, so we're waiting to hear what the new titles are that are going to be coming to
4056420	4057820	this year.
4057820	4062020	And Inti Creates, um, has been teasing some new titles.
4062020	4067260	They have three titles that they say are in development, but we don't know necessarily
4067260	4070340	what those titles are yet.
4070340	4077100	Um, I thought I saw online that it's not blaster master, but maybe, maybe it is.
4077100	4078560	Um, we'll see.
4078560	4080060	So I don't know.
4080060	4085060	It's just a, we know that there's more titles in development maybe coming out this year,
4085060	4090220	but don't know which classic games or maybe even new franchises that they're planning
4090220	4091220	on bringing out.
4091220	4095300	I would, I thought we got confirmation that bloodstains getting a sequel.
4095300	4096700	So maybe that's one of them as well.
4096700	4098100	I think that is definitely one of them.
4098100	4101140	I do remember the blood stain getting a sequel story recently.
4101140	4102140	Yeah.
4102140	4105380	I think we talked about that like a week or two ago, so I'm sure that's probably one of
4105380	4106380	them.
4106380	4111980	Um, a blaster master three, that would be like a blaster master zero part three.
4111980	4115780	That would be interesting, especially because it would be, it was interesting that it was
4115780	4117820	inspired from that, you know, original NES game.
4117820	4120880	And then they, it kind of got a sequel that was just its own thing.
4120880	4125340	It was independent of any, uh, you know, like the Genesis game or anything else before it,
4125340	4127140	it was kind of its own own universe.
4127140	4129980	So that would be cool to see a faster's quest zero.
4129980	4137100	I honestly, the things I would do and the nasty things I would, I would do that I'm
4137100	4142580	not going to say on air for them to have gotten somehow the license to reboot the guardian
4142580	4147980	legend because they did a really good job of blaster master, honestly.
4147980	4151780	And I feel like if I'm going to play a game like the guardian legend, which is like holy
4151780	4156180	text to me, and I know it's, it's near and dear to dark soccer's heart as well.
4156180	4158660	There's only so many companies I would trust with that.
4158980	4163460	And, and that, that would be one of them based on what they do with blaster master for sure.
4163460	4164460	So yeah.
4164460	4170860	Uh, let's see, um, oh, they're still talking about vinyl in the chat.
4170860	4173740	She Hulk is saying, I have Pac-Man fever on vinyl.
4173740	4180180	I remember when they used to play that at the roller rink, dated myself a little bit.
4180180	4182820	All right.
4182820	4183820	Let's move on.
4183820	4185980	Uh, let's talk about Stardew Valley.
4185980	4186980	Still going.
4186980	4192980	Been around for a couple of years and is about to get a pretty major update 1.5.
4192980	4195820	So there was a update that came out on PC.
4195820	4200220	So this already came out on PC, but we're going to talk a little bit about the consoles.
4200220	4203700	So the patch was something that just get, they didn't really hype it up or anything.
4203700	4206300	It was kind of surprise dropped.
4206300	4211820	Everybody else is supposed to be getting it in January at the end of the month is the
4211820	4212820	current timeframe.
4212820	4216600	It's not like this week, but maybe in three weeks.
4216600	4220560	So update 1.5 is supposed to be ready by the end of January, but they're not going
4220560	4221760	to guarantee that.
4221760	4227180	Uh, I'm sure with everything that's going on right now, uh, they're also bare out bare
4227180	4228180	own.
4228180	4229180	I hope I said that name right.
4229180	4233080	Who, who puts together the game, uh, is kind of talking about the development process,
4233080	4238640	talking about that there is a small team that works with them on the updates saying really
4238640	4239640	small.
4239640	4243640	Uh, 1.5 was apparently two people that actually put that together.
4243640	4244640	So interesting.
4244680	4251400	Uh, this will also have, um, additional bug fixes that were not present when the PC released,
4251400	4258320	uh, already what was in this patch, some new people, new goals, new items, a new quest
4258320	4264440	type, a new farm layout, new character events, community upgrade, home renovations, ducks
4264440	4265680	that swim.
4265680	4268080	Yes, that is one of the bull points.
4268080	4269080	Swimming ducks.
4269080	4270080	That's right.
4270080	4271080	Swimming ducks.
4271080	4273040	Uh, you can sit in chairs, you can move your bed.
4273040	4278680	There are fish tanks, new furniture items, new secrets, and nine new music tracks.
4278680	4281160	And they say there is more that they don't want to spoil.
4281160	4282840	So it is very major update.
4282840	4285440	And I know this is a huge game on the switch.
4285440	4289360	Um, so I'm sure there's a lot, in fact, I know, I know people that play it on the switch
4289360	4293840	and really like, but before animal crossing came out, Stardew Valley was kind of like
4293840	4296160	a game to hold them over, I think for many people.
4296160	4299760	So, um, I know a lot of people will be looking forward to the console release of this for
4299760	4301840	sure.
4301880	4303880	So we'll see when it arrives.
4303880	4305280	Let's move on to other classics.
4305280	4306280	Stark, Sakura.
4306280	4312800	This is also a very cool, and actually I showed it to Dan when I found this and he was like,
4312800	4314080	wow, that's pretty cool.
4314080	4319840	So, um, in Nintendo 64, you know, pretty, you know, I I'd say it's actually kind of
4319840	4323040	a divisive system because not everyone was a big fan.
4323040	4326160	You know, there was the cartridge base, everything.
4326160	4333600	However, um, a modder who goes by the name Gunner reconstructed his Nintendo 64 with
4333600	4339200	some parts from a few other consoles and things like that, and made a portable version.
4339200	4347760	Um, basically, uh, he goes by G-man mods with a Z, um, was, he was able to make a functioning
4347760	4354200	Nintendo 64 that is just barely larger than the cartridges themselves.
4354200	4356240	It's pretty interesting.
4356240	4363200	It looks like he took a few, uh, cues, uh, in, uh, configuration from, uh, the switch
4363200	4367760	just in where the, you know, the, the other triggers are located.
4367760	4376800	Um, and, uh, he says though, that it does have, uh, some flaws that he calls the gaming
4376800	4382280	experience a subpar, um, and that it could actually be really uncomfortable to hold.
4382280	4388480	It has short battery life, but the purpose was to make the world's smallest Nintendo
4388480	4389480	64.
4389480	4397480	Um, it makes me think though, that if it was possible for him to do a handheld version
4397480	4407120	of this, then I don't see why we can't have maybe someplace like analog do a N64 that
4407120	4412700	could be handheld and then perhaps plugged in, uh, for TV play.
4412700	4414520	It just makes me think that it would be possible.
4414520	4419080	Oh, wait, it'd be possible with no one ever buy it and it'd be, or no one would be ever
4419080	4420080	able to buy it.
4420080	4425200	And it would be way too expensive because that's how all of their consoles are.
4425200	4429600	Like I would love an NT mini, but I'm not paying $800 for an NES.
4429600	4430600	I'm sorry.
4430600	4431600	I'm getting a duo.
4431600	4432600	Yeah.
4432600	4436920	And in chat, Bobby is expressing, please not analog until they can figure out supply.
4436920	4440920	Uh, sacred Jade saying waiting on analog to develop and ship something is eternity.
4440920	4441920	All right.
4441920	4444040	So maybe I maybe accompany them as an example.
4444040	4445040	Yeah.
4445040	4446040	Yeah.
4446040	4447040	I get it.
4447040	4448040	Like do a lot.
4448040	4453560	But I wish they were in stock and not that expensive, but what, what, what an authentic
4453560	4456760	Nintendo experience.
4456760	4459360	It is very authentic in that sense.
4459360	4460360	Yes.
4460360	4462560	Anyway, I get what you mean dark soccer.
4462560	4469240	Um, and yeah, it, you know, uh, especially with the patent on the hardware has to be
4469240	4472680	expiring soon if it hasn't already expired.
4472680	4473680	Right.
4473680	4474680	That system came out like 96.
4474680	4475680	Right.
4475680	4479120	And what's, what's the timeframe on that 25 years maybe.
4479120	4480120	I think so.
4480120	4484320	Cause we see the, the NES is and the SNES is out there that, you know, play all the
4484320	4489740	old games that you can buy pretty openly now because I think the, the patents on the hardware
4489740	4491720	and all that kind of run out at some point.
4491720	4497440	So it would be about that time where a Nintendo 64 and PlayStation honestly, uh, would, would
4497440	4498440	be having that as well.
4498440	4502360	So that's going to be interesting to see where those kind of homebrew consoles go, especially
4502360	4503720	when it comes to minis.
4503720	4508440	I think a lot of people surprised Nintendo did not do their own N64 mini and went a different
4508440	4511280	route instead with the whole game and watch thing this last year.
4511280	4520200	So pixel pockets and chat says there are portable gaming devices that run up to PS one and N
4520200	4525480	64 emulation, but it is emulation and not actual hardware of course, but those are pretty
4525480	4527640	cheap and decent quality.
4527640	4531640	So and yeah, some of the things that do Nintendo and Super Nintendo also kind of run through
4531640	4537200	emulation, uh, sometimes to try to improve the lag and all that stuff for HTMI output
4537200	4538200	and all that good stuff.
4538200	4539200	So yeah.
4539200	4540200	All right.
4540200	4546240	Well, we'll see, we'll see if, uh, maybe we can, uh, make these things a mass produced
4546240	4547240	reality someday.
4547240	4548240	Who knows?
4548240	4549240	Anyhow, let's move on.
4549280	4550280	Loki.
4550280	4551280	All right.
4551280	4557280	Um, so let's talk a little bit about, uh, a story that seems to keep coming up every
4557280	4563080	once in a while about Nintendo going after this company in Japan that keeps, uh, renting
4563080	4570240	out these go-karts and costumes like, uh, Mario characters to kind of do your own like
4570240	4573000	Mario Kart tour of Japan.
4573000	4577320	Um, and finally though, I believe it is over.
4577320	4585960	Um, they have, uh, sealed their victory and I guess have been the company Mari car because
4585960	4592040	they thought that they can change their name and get away with that, um, has been now ordered
4592040	4595320	to pay the tune of, uh, 10 million yen.
4595320	4602580	So almost a hundred thousand dollars to Nintendo for unauthorized use of its IPs and safety
4602580	4607000	concerns, which obviously if you're driving a go-kart in traffic, there could be a problem
4607000	4608000	there.
4608000	4615940	Um, also, um, so that, that was the original, uh, settling back in 2017.
4615940	4622600	So then they went to court again because they changed their name to street cart and said
4622600	4627800	that they were unrelated to Nintendo stickers on all over the cards, but then they got charged
4627800	4630640	an even larger fine of 50 million yen.
4630640	4637160	Um, and then finally, you know, now they are going to have to pay that.
4637160	4641600	And it sounds like that the street cart company is actually having trouble staying afloat
4641600	4644560	being that, you know, there's a pandemic going on.
4644560	4650100	So, um, yeah, it's interesting to see that going, but I mean, what did they really think
4650100	4651100	was going to happen?
4651100	4655660	I mean, especially, you know, to tie it back to something you were talking about earlier,
4655660	4659660	you know, now that we know, I think when this all started first going down, we knew that
4659700	4662720	there was a Nintendo world coming to, to universal.
4662720	4664780	We didn't know the details of what would be in it.
4664780	4668980	And now we know, I mean, we speculated there's probably a Mario Kart thing that's going to
4668980	4669980	be in it.
4669980	4670980	Now we know for sure.
4670980	4671980	Yes.
4671980	4675260	The flagship, you know, e-ticket ride, if you will, is a Mario Kart ride.
4675260	4680420	And so, um, of course they want this experience gone because they don't want to create confusion
4680420	4687540	with the park and, uh, yeah, slapping a sticker on there saying not Nintendo isn't exactly
4687540	4688540	enough.
4688540	4689540	No.
4689540	4690540	So.
4690540	4691540	Yeah.
4691540	4696860	So it definitely, definitely, um, not surprised to see it go this way.
4696860	4698060	Yeah, not at all.
4698060	4702140	So, um, it'll be interesting to see if they bring the concept back with something else
4702140	4707300	completely unrelated to Nintendo, but, uh, this money, this fine they owe probably going
4707300	4708300	to put them out of business.
4708300	4710620	And especially, I'm sure the pandemic isn't helping.
4710620	4714420	I don't think things, I think, I think things are a little different over in Japan, but
4714420	4719780	I, I think, uh, I don't think you have like the, the crowded, busy streets and bustling
4719780	4724500	activity, uh, that you're used to seeing throughout all this, uh, pandemic stuff going on, you
4724500	4725500	know?
4725500	4727980	So maybe, maybe later this year, like we're all hoping for everywhere else.
4727980	4728980	Yeah.
4728980	4729980	We'll see.
4729980	4730980	All right.
4730980	4735260	Well, one more before we get to the classic game of the week, which is not this game,
4735260	4740780	but I thought we could talk about a classic anyway, because Gradius three is going to
4740780	4746860	be coming to the PlayStation four and the switch as the latest arcade archives release,
4746860	4752700	uh, Gradius three from 1989, uh, which is, you know, it's a, there, there is a story
4752700	4757180	you go against the bacteria on empire, uh, it, it's a Gradius game.
4757180	4759220	It looks like a lot of the other Gradius games.
4759220	4763640	I remember playing this, do you remember on the PSP, there was a Gradius collection that
4763640	4764640	had them all on it.
4764640	4767440	I remember playing this on there, uh, and this is good.
4767440	4772080	This is the one that has the big, if I is the fire plume levels in it, or was that also
4772080	4775100	in two, two had that as well.
4775100	4779220	It looks the, the fire plumes look different in three, it has a very different look to
4779220	4780220	it.
4780220	4784360	Um, I don't know how, how do you define Gradius three different than the other two dark soccer?
4784360	4787960	I'm not sure there's an easy way to do that.
4787960	4789720	The end, they're all Gradius, you know?
4789720	4790720	Yeah, exactly.
4790720	4795720	Uh, anyway, Gradius three includes a bonus stage from an alternate perspective and hidden
4795720	4798360	stages with the series past.
4798360	4804880	So that is all available this week, um, for about eight bucks on the arcade archives,
4804880	4808840	which is still going, there's over a hundred games that have been released with that.
4808840	4812840	You know, I totally forgot to mention during my gaming week, speaking of like retro collection
4812840	4818000	things, I finally played some of that Sega ages stuff I bought on switch.
4818000	4823160	I actually spent a bit of time playing fantasy zone, uh, the Sega ages version of that because
4823160	4825760	you know, that's a, that's, that's a cute little shooter.
4825760	4829720	It's the greatest version of that game, but it's really, I love fantasy zone.
4829720	4836920	It is, it is straight up defender, but they get ages, which say you get ages ones, the,
4836920	4839960	the Sega ages 20, they didn't do the 2,500 version on that.
4839960	4840960	Did they?
4840960	4841960	I don't think so.
4841960	4842960	No, this is the original.
4842960	4843960	Okay.
4843960	4844960	Nevermind.
4844960	4845960	I'm just confusing it with the 2,500.
4845960	4846960	Yeah, no worries.
4846960	4848200	So, um, but it was fun.
4848200	4849200	Yeah.
4849200	4850200	I played a little bit of that.
4850200	4853840	Fantasy star and Alex Kidd, because those are all the games that I bought when the,
4853840	4857040	cause there was a big sale on all that stuff a couple of weeks ago on the switch.
4857040	4858320	So I, I picked up a bunch of them.
4858320	4859320	So sorry.
4859320	4863240	That just kind of sparked that to mind since we were talking about retro stuff that's available
4863240	4869000	on the switch, even if there's no virtual console per se, I mean, sure there's the,
4869000	4872580	you know, Nintendo online library and stuff, but I think you're seeing more and more companies
4872580	4874560	that are kind of just doing their own types of releases.
4874560	4880800	If I'm not mistaken, Square Enix just did the, um, they did another collection that
4880800	4883560	just came out on, um, the switch.
4883560	4886600	Was it final fantasy legend that just came out?
4886600	4890280	There's like a collection of those old game boy games that just came out on switch as
4890280	4891280	well.
4891280	4893000	So, all right.
4893000	4898160	Well, speaking of classics, let's take a trip down memory lane with the classic game of
4898160	4900000	the week.
4900000	4904040	Every week, dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and she finds a game that she thinks,
4904040	4909040	Hey, you guys, you know, you need to, you need to put down your 2020 games.
4909040	4913040	Nothing good came out this year anyway, besides animal crossing and you need to check out
4913040	4914040	this game instead.
4914040	4919480	Although I got to say before we get to this week's game, cause you picked quite the game
4919480	4920480	for this week.
4920480	4923000	Um, I had to start it off with something major.
4923000	4929920	You had to start off 2021 this, this is, I just have to put the whole, like, this is
4929920	4935660	not a game that holds up well to what is considered, uh, okay in 2020.
4935660	4939200	Like this, this game, this game's got some problematic stuff.
4939200	4940200	It's it's different time.
4940200	4944280	So I want to, I want to make that very clear cause I'm about to play footage from the game
4944280	4950120	and it might be a little bit like, yikes, but I want to find my other, my other link
4950120	4951120	about it.
4951120	4952120	Oh, I'll have to find it.
4952120	4957640	But we're going to talk about this game for the purposes of commentary and where the hell
4957640	4963200	did a game like this come from and how did it get the notoriety that it did.
4963200	4966080	So I, I, I felt this one needed a disclaimer.
4966080	4967080	So there you go.
4967080	4969080	Absolutely needs a disclaimer.
4969080	4974040	Um, I had a feeling that you would, uh, that you would, uh, say something.
4974040	4975040	Well there you go.
4975040	4976320	So there's your disclaimer.
4976320	4983600	It's a, it is a, it is a choice that's going to make you guys go, Oh, okay.
4983600	4986240	So, uh, get to the game, dark saga, please.
4986240	4987240	All right.
4987240	4990880	So the game is Boonga Boonga.
4990880	4991880	Perfect.
4991880	4994000	Oh, and the movie didn't even play.
4994000	4995000	I didn't have it loaded right.
4995000	4997920	Let me fix that real quick and then you'll get that.
4997920	4998920	All right.
4998920	5007080	So I picked Boonga Boonga and, um, it was also known as Spank Em.
5007080	5014960	It was, uh, an arcade game only, thank God, um, that was developed by a South Korean company
5014960	5017760	called TAF systems.
5017760	5024000	And it is the first, and I hope that the only arcade game that simulates something called
5024000	5030440	Concho, which is a prank where you are poked with two fingers in the butt while you're
5030440	5031440	distracted.
5031440	5035040	So yes, it is a Concho game.
5035040	5042000	Um, it, uh, it really became, um, by the way, it came out in 2001.
5042040	5049640	Uh, it really became kind of like a meme when there was a really badly translated, uh, flyer
5049640	5057040	that went out that showed the banking and the Concho, uh, gameplay.
5057040	5062640	And um, the game was designed for the Japanese market, according to advertising material
5062640	5067680	that was actually well received at the 2000 Tokyo game show.
5067680	5075560	Um, they, the contract was for 200 units, only five were, were distributed.
5075560	5083880	Um, and now we're going to get into the, uh, the problematic nature of this.
5083880	5088600	So, and let me go ahead and do a little bit of description of what the cabinet looks like
5088600	5091080	because all we have up, I think is the video, right?
5091080	5092080	Yes.
5092080	5093800	And the podcast, you just can't even see that.
5093800	5094920	All right.
5094960	5103840	So the, the cabinet is, uh, you've got two aspects of it, kind of like, uh, two thirds
5103840	5110440	of it has the monitor and the controller and the right hand side has a thing for prizes.
5110440	5117880	So your controller is a huge, but a gene clad, but I think it is, or slacks or something,
5117880	5124880	but it is a huge butt and it, uh, you use that.
5124880	5130720	You actually have a plastic finger controller as well that you use to stick in the butt.
5130720	5135720	Um, so you have different characters that you can punish.
5135720	5141440	You have the ex-girlfriend, the ex-boyfriend, uh, Yakuza, uh, the mother-in-law, the gold
5141440	5147120	digger, the prostitute, the child molester, and the con artist and their facial expression
5147120	5149360	shows on the monitor.
5149360	5152720	Um, we'll, we'll get to that a little bit later.
5152720	5160480	So, um, you get different cards that rate you on your quote, sexual behavior.
5160480	5166440	And if you perform exceptionally, you get a small plastic trophy that looks like poop.
5166440	5168720	So that is the game.
5168720	5171280	That right there is the game.
5171280	5175160	And people are looking at this footage and it's, it's almost hard to watch because it's
5175160	5179200	just so like the expressions they make are, they're not of God, Jamie.
5179200	5180680	They're not of God.
5180680	5183600	They're completely unnatural.
5183600	5193280	So here is the problem is that, um, first of all, I mean, I honestly think that I don't
5193280	5195200	know how Concho came about.
5195200	5198800	I've always found that to be a disturbing prank.
5198800	5205560	I mean, honestly, I think I would rather get, um, you know, have someone be pantsed then
5205560	5208400	or wedgie then no Concho, but Hey.
5208400	5214080	Um, but anyway, uh, and yes, I know fifth James school kids do it to people.
5214080	5220680	Um, Concho is existed like for an age and it's in all kinds of TV and you name it.
5220680	5224720	I don't think there's anyone over here who's not familiar with the concept.
5224720	5226720	And a lot of kids are assholes.
5226720	5230760	Like a lot of kids are assholes and they like to apparently play with assholes.
5230760	5233240	So anyway, anyway.
5233640	5243720	Um, so basically with this game though, here's what gets to be super problematic about it.
5243720	5256800	And by the way, uh, the way that it, um, it's really terrible is that, um, like there's
5256800	5264600	a whole mode in there that, you know, by punishing a mother-in-law or an ex-girlfriend
5264600	5273880	or something, there's a lot of just misogyny in there, you know, um, like, for example,
5273880	5283800	I mean, like most of the characters in there, from what I understand are female and it really
5283800	5288600	is just like, it's just really problematic.
5288600	5296080	Um, but in other things too, is like the, the fact that it depends on how you perform,
5296080	5301040	like if you do it too soft or too hard, they're going to mock you.
5301040	5306440	And there were, and like I said, there were only five of these that actually were released.
5306440	5313040	So thank God it didn't get more widespread, but it's still just like, it's creepy, you
5313040	5314040	know?
5314040	5318840	And on top of that, I mean, something like this definitely would get like the million
5318840	5321480	moms, you know, losing their shit about it.
5321480	5324360	And this time they would actually be losing their shit over something worth losing their
5324360	5325360	shit over.
5325360	5326840	This game simply couldn't release today.
5326840	5327840	It just can't.
5327840	5332600	Like it's not, it is definitely one of those things where, and I think this might beg the
5332600	5333600	question.
5333600	5336560	So, so why a classic game of the week then?
5336560	5340060	Well, number one, not every classic game that's ever been picked as a good game.
5340060	5343500	And sometimes it's about kind of like learning this new, new world.
5343500	5344500	You sure did.
5344500	5347820	And, and sometimes it's about learning from where we've been.
5347820	5350820	And this game is also one of the, in many ways, I think it's kind of like a game of
5350820	5352380	urban legends.
5352380	5358380	Like we heard about this game and did, and didn't believe that it actually existed.
5358380	5362220	And it does anyway, the, the B roll is finally running out and I don't really want to watch
5362220	5363220	it anymore.
5363220	5364220	So I'm just coming back to us.
5364220	5365220	Yeah.
5365220	5366220	Just leave it there.
5366380	5374260	And that was kind of the whole reason why I do the classic game of the week is to outline
5374260	5382100	things that do exist or have existed or almost existed or has a big impact on the gaming
5382100	5383220	world.
5383220	5388460	And this was a meme for an age, an early internet.
5388460	5394060	I mean, I would even say that this going around the internet, people, people were talking
5394100	5397380	about it for like a couple of years, you know?
5397380	5405220	So this one, uh, I picked it because of its notoriety and the impact it had on gaming
5405220	5406220	culture.
5406220	5407220	Interesting.
5407220	5412220	Interesting that you do a meme-tastic game the week that flash died, which was the source
5412220	5413700	of all of our memes.
5413700	5415500	Bobby got into this on his show a little bit.
5415500	5418580	No, I think it's, I think it's a funny tie-in in a way.
5418580	5420620	I wasn't really saying oops.
5420620	5421620	Oh.
5422100	5427780	I mean, like, I could also do like the lobster catching game, submarine catcher.
5427780	5428780	It's it's fine.
5428780	5429980	You remember that one, don't you?
5429980	5431980	Um, I don't think so.
5431980	5432980	Yeah.
5432980	5437580	I mean, it's up there with like the table flipping game and we need the table flipping
5437580	5438580	game now.
5438580	5440180	I don't know if the table flipping game is 10 years old yet.
5440180	5441180	Well, it's gotta be.
5441180	5442180	I don't think so.
5442180	5448460	It's, it's, but there's also like, but I mean the other like weird one I would have chosen
5448460	5450060	would have been like submarine catcher.
5450060	5451820	I just have to see how old it is.
5451820	5457660	The table flipping game is actually 10 years old, January 22nd, 2010.
5457660	5458660	Ooh.
5458660	5459660	Okay.
5459660	5460660	So pretty, pretty close.
5460660	5462620	It is 11 years old eligible.
5462620	5463620	All right.
5463620	5464620	Good to know.
5464620	5465620	Good to know.
5465620	5467620	See, we'll see.
5467620	5470660	Maybe I'll, maybe I'll do like a classic arcade only.
5470660	5474260	Um, and you, I think you're okay with me bringing it up here.
5474260	5478980	We're still trying to figure out what the theme might be for your special picks in 2021,
5478980	5480220	if any.
5480220	5482740	Maybe this will just be a year with nothing special.
5482740	5486020	We can highlight the record, but she shot her.
5486020	5488180	No, I'm not going to do a package slide.
5488180	5489180	No.
5489180	5490180	Did you run my SS table flipping game?
5490180	5491180	Was it magfest?
5491180	5496580	Uh, table flipping game is in, uh, a lot of content to mall in San Francisco.
5496580	5497580	Yeah.
5497580	5500100	A lot of, uh, yeah, there's, it's at the mall in San Francisco and I want to say, don't
5500100	5502020	they get one in California extreme too.
5502020	5506420	And there's usually, there's a couple of those that travel around to the different conventions,
5506420	5512700	but wasn't magfest the one, um, that it didn't just have the table flipping game, but they
5512700	5516740	had the whole thing where you could donate like $50 to charity or something and you could
5516740	5520300	actually flip a table that they would set up with everything.
5520300	5522700	Like they had a group of volunteers that would set the table.
5522700	5525220	You pay 50 bucks and you can actually flip a real day.
5525220	5526220	Bobby says yes.
5526220	5527220	Okay.
5527220	5528220	That's what I thought.
5528220	5529220	That was the thing.
5529220	5531620	There's like also like another game along those lines, which is like the, the tablecloth
5531620	5532880	pulling game.
5532880	5533880	There's one like that.
5534120	5540600	There were some different games that were along those lines, but, um, but we'll, we'll,
5540600	5541600	we'll see.
5541600	5546120	Cause I'm, I would love to just highlight different weird arcade games.
5546120	5547120	Okay.
5547120	5552080	So this segment is the weird arcade game of the month.
5552080	5555820	That's it officially the fucking weird arcade game of the month.
5555820	5556820	Weird arcade game of the month.
5556820	5557820	All right.
5557820	5563080	No, the fucking weird arcade.
5563080	5566760	You think you can think of 12 to get us, get us through the year?
5566760	5568640	Oh, who are you talking to?
5568640	5569640	All right.
5569640	5570640	All right.
5570640	5571640	So there it is.
5571640	5573800	Your weird fucking arcade game of the month.
5573800	5575040	No fucking weird.
5575040	5576040	Sorry.
5576040	5577520	Fucking weird arcade game.
5577520	5578520	Wait.
5578520	5581400	So it has been said, I'm sorry.
5581400	5585520	You just picked the acronym flag flag.
5585520	5589480	It's the flag flag of the month.
5589480	5590480	I mean, come on.
5590480	5594360	This is from the same person who said that our first tournament was going to be called
5594360	5595360	scat.
5595360	5598640	At least you didn't do the fucking arcade game of the week or the month.
5598640	5599920	That's glad you did.
5599920	5600920	Didn't do that.
5600920	5601920	All right.
5601920	5605880	Uh, the fucking weird arcade game of the month.
5605880	5606880	All right.
5606880	5607880	Perfect.
5607880	5608880	Yeah.
5608880	5609880	The flag.
5609880	5610880	Tweaky flag.
5610880	5613320	And I can't think of anything weirder than Oonga boot.
5613320	5617800	Is it boonga boonga boonga boonga boonga boonga.
5617800	5618800	All right.
5618800	5619800	Or spank them.
5620120	5621120	All right.
5621120	5624120	Dark Tetsuya go update the Wiki.
5624120	5630440	All right, let's get to some rapid fire news because honestly, that's all we have left
5630440	5631440	for tonight.
5631440	5632440	Really.
5632440	5634520	We're going to do some rapid fire news and some release dates, and then we're going to
5634520	5635520	get to the round table.
5635520	5640720	Uh, it's a little shorter tonight just because of this week hasn't had as much going on,
5640720	5644320	but it gives us a little more time to go check out AGDQ or check out the demo for Loki's
5644320	5647240	game or whatever else in gaming is going on for you.
5647240	5650000	So let's travel and look at some rapid fire news pretty quick.
5650000	5652720	And by the way, I'm still going to see if it works on a never drive.
5652720	5653720	So stay tuned.
5653720	5654720	It does.
5654720	5658480	If you do an update to it, I get apparently, but like I don't have anything to test on.
5658480	5660680	So I can't really say.
5660680	5661680	We can test it.
5661680	5663680	I told, I told hubs.
5663680	5664680	Nice.
5664680	5665680	All right.
5665680	5670360	Well, eventually it'll be on a cartridge anyway, so I mean, no problem there.
5670360	5676280	Um, so PlayStation plus, we've got our lineup of games coming out in January, starting off
5676320	5681480	with man eater on PlayStation five and then for PlayStation four shadow of the tomb Raider
5681480	5683720	and greed fall.
5683720	5692440	And then we got the inklings that respawn is working on a brand new franchise or a new
5692440	5694320	IP.
5694320	5700720	And um, we know that because they have a job listing that says, join a small team being
5700720	5703260	formed to develop a brand new IP.
5703260	5705720	So does it get more direct than that?
5705720	5706840	What that AP is?
5706840	5707840	Who knows?
5707840	5711440	We'll find out, I guess eventually, but it is happening.
5711440	5713360	That's it.
5713360	5714880	All right.
5714880	5719800	Uh, let's talk about the worst games of 2020 per Metacritic.
5719800	5722040	Now I don't know how much stock y'all put Metacritic.
5722040	5726140	I don't put a lot in it, but it is interesting to see what, you know, some of their number
5726140	5727640	crunching does.
5727640	5734520	So the 10 worst games, according to Metacritic number 10 is the elder scrolls blades on the
5734520	5740200	switch and that's the one that I've played and I'm like, is it, I get why people don't
5740200	5741200	like it.
5741200	5742200	It does.
5742200	5748840	It does dumb down the elder scrolls formula a little bit too much and yeah, I mean it's
5748840	5753880	probably not totally worth your time, but I don't, I didn't like hate it, but it definitely
5753880	5758360	is not, it does not have the depth of an actual elder scrolls game and I think people kind
5758360	5760280	of see right through that.
5760280	5763520	These others, I haven't played any of these others that are on the list.
5763520	5769640	With an average score of 42, the ninth worst game was gleam light for the switch.
5769640	5775280	With an average score of 41 street power soccer for the PlayStation four was number eight
5775280	5780760	with an average score of 40 tamarin on the PlayStation four was the seventh worst game
5780760	5781760	of the year.
5781760	5790920	A number, uh, sorry, a score of 39 remothered broken porcelain for the PC was a two broken
5790920	5792600	and buggy for this year.
5792680	5799440	Uh, number five was arc of alchemist for the switch, uh, people complaining about its dated
5799440	5802140	graphics and not great story.
5802140	5805960	Number four, the fourth worst game of the year with an average score of 34 for the PC
5805960	5808800	fast and furious crossroads.
5808800	5814360	Yes, to be confused with the fast and furious movie because it was a tie into that game.
5814360	5820560	Uh, the third worst game of the year on the PlayStation four dawn of fear, the second
5820600	5823400	worst game of the year, oops, I accidentally went ahead here.
5823400	5829680	The second worst game of the year, the 13 remake X I I I is kind of how it stylized
5829680	5830680	with the Roman numerals.
5830680	5836880	Uh, the remake of 13 for the Xbox one because it was bugs, bugs, bugs, and the developer
5836880	5841100	actually put out an apology average score of 32.
5841100	5848080	So what was worse than that with an average score of 29 the worst game of 2020 is tiny
5848080	5850200	racer for the switch.
5850200	5856500	A $10 racing game where you take miniature cars through kitchens and forests and apparently
5856500	5864160	the game play stinks and that is the worst game of 2020 according to Metacritic again,
5864160	5866320	however you feel about that.
5866320	5871680	That's kind of subjective I think because like, I don't know, like I think some of those
5871680	5876280	games aren't at so bad on there, but like there's some like shadow of the Ronin revenge
5876280	5879520	of the samurai that didn't make the list, which really should.
5879520	5882560	If you've ever played that game, which I hope you haven't.
5882560	5888200	It's a real PlayStation four game and it's, it's really awful.
5888200	5895040	Um, and there's the guy that makes these games basically does, it's just this giant empty
5895040	5900320	void of nothing that you run around forever and then you fight one monster, they'll immediately
5900320	5901840	kill you and that's it.
5901840	5907440	And um, yeah, I'm surprised that that didn't make the list.
5908240	5911040	I guess no one's played it, so no one's reviewed it.
5911040	5917280	And again, I completely understand if you do not want to put all of your stock in Metacritic,
5917280	5921160	but you know, since we addressed earlier in the show, I had that question from No One
5921160	5924360	Special last week where it was like, what is the worst game of the year?
5924360	5925360	I don't know.
5925360	5928660	I wanted to kind of throw something in here where it's like, but here's what other people
5928660	5930360	are saying.
5930360	5934480	So and why I'm kind of like, I don't know if Elder Scrolls Blades is the worst thing
5934520	5938800	I've played this year, but I guess it wasn't great, but yeah.
5938800	5939800	All right.
5939800	5941360	Anyway, let's move on.
5941360	5944840	Dark Sakura has one more, I think for us, a rapid fire story.
5944840	5954240	Um, the Doom account celebrated 2021 with something that there, it was a thing for a
5954240	5955240	while.
5955240	5964760	Um, but it is a picture of Doom Guy and Isabelle, their, uh, nendoroid, uh, uh, figures skipping
5964760	5972360	along hand in hand amongst some potted plants with the name Happy New Horizons.
5972360	5975440	So the meme will not die in 2021.
5975440	5976960	The name will not, the meme will not die.
5976960	5978480	They are the best of friends.
5978480	5982040	I hope Doom Guy becomes a, uh, they should just do like, you know, when they have the
5982040	5985000	next smash announcement of the people that are being added to it.
5985000	5989800	Just have a two for have, you know, Isabelle and Doom Guy in there.
5989800	5990800	Yeah.
5990800	5992800	Isabelle's in there, but it would be great.
5992800	5993800	Yeah.
5993800	5994800	Isabelle's character already.
5994800	5995800	Okay.
5995800	5996800	Oh yeah.
5996800	5997800	Yeah.
5997800	5998800	Her little intro was adorable too.
5998800	5999800	Yeah.
5999800	6001160	She's she was Doom Guy in there.
6001160	6002160	Yeah.
6002160	6005000	Doom Guy would actually be kind of a neat addition.
6005000	6008080	And I think these memes only play into it a little more.
6008080	6012360	Um, I don't know if Doom Guy is necessarily a Nintendo thing, but let's be real.
6012360	6014760	We're getting to the point where there's a lot of characters in there that I don't
6014760	6017120	always associate with Nintendo platforms.
6017120	6018120	So why not?
6018120	6021040	I think it'd be funny if Doom Guy got in there.
6021040	6022440	All right.
6022440	6026040	Let's travel around the world and check out what games are coming out this week.
6026040	6028960	I don't know if we have a lot, but I'll check.
6028960	6029960	We do it every week.
6029960	6032880	Loki, do we have any games coming out this week in the US?
6032880	6037840	There's not a lot, but there are a couple, so we have werewolf, the apocalypse heart
6037840	6040640	of the forest on Nintendo switch.
6040640	6046440	And then we've Iris fall, uh, which is in the switch PlayStation four and X-Box one.
6046440	6047660	That's it.
6047660	6050080	My Japanese releases are empty.
6050080	6053040	I do not have anything this week in Japan, dark soccer.
6053040	6055040	What about the UK?
6055040	6056040	Equally empty.
6056040	6057040	Yeah.
6057040	6059400	It's quite weak, but we always check in.
6059400	6060400	So at least there's a cut.
6060400	6062600	There's like two games Loki named here in the US.
6062600	6063600	There is that.
6063600	6064600	Yeah.
6064600	6065600	All right.
6065600	6068600	Um, I am going to open up the round table.
6068600	6072560	If you guys have any questions in chat and anything you want to ask us, uh, now is a
6072560	6074480	great time, uh, to put that in.
6074480	6077040	I also don't know if we have any main emails tonight.
6077040	6078040	Did we dark?
6078040	6079040	We have one.
6079040	6080040	Oh, we have one.
6080040	6081040	Okay.
6081040	6083240	Before you read it, I did, I guess I already mentioned this in the show, but I had it here
6083240	6084480	as a placeholder, so I wouldn't forget.
6084480	6086000	And I'll mention it again.
6086000	6087920	Awesome games done quick is this week.
6087920	6089920	And for those of you that are watching on Twitch, stay tuned.
6089920	6093520	Um, after we're done here at OLR, we'll be going to raid that presentation.
6093520	6098880	Um, and I, I think we'll be hosting that pretty much on VOG throughout the entire week.
6098880	6104120	Um, so if you want to chat about it with other folks, uh, and, and, and possibly I'll probably
6104120	6107280	be in there when Bobby's doing the hosting stuff, cause you know, our comments kind of
6107280	6108920	get lost in the big chat.
6108920	6110980	Um, so we will, we will be hosting it.
6110980	6114040	If you want to chat with some of us, you can do that in the VOG chat room.
6114040	6117000	Uh, cause I think we did that last time and it worked out pretty well.
6117000	6118840	So I'm check that out throughout the week.
6118840	6120280	Um, all right.
6120280	6122000	So I've mentioned it twice now, so I know I'm good.
6122000	6123260	So let's get to that email.
6123260	6138060	If you want to send us an email, participate at orange lounge, radio.com, uh, dark soccer.
6138060	6140460	Do you want to get to the email tonight?
6140460	6143980	Yeah, no, it got really quiet for a moment and I thought you were saying something else.
6143980	6144980	So sorry.
6144980	6145980	No, you're good.
6145980	6146980	Okay.
6146980	6147980	Hello.
6147980	6151100	Congratulations to everyone on surviving 2020.
6151100	6157260	Hopefully we'll all get, I'll get shot soon and see things getting back to sort of almost
6157260	6158260	normal.
6158260	6162660	I know I'm really looking forward to actually going out in public and playing DDR again.
6162660	6166900	Last week you mentioned all of the Xbox 360 halo games going offline.
6166900	6169060	I just wanted to point out two things.
6169060	6172700	First that only specific servers for those games are being shut down.
6172700	6176580	You will still be able to play the games, earn most of their achievements and even continue
6176580	6181220	to play custom multiplayer matches with friends as well as multiplayer games over land or
6181220	6188020	split screen matchmaking files, sharing online stats and online challenges, specific things
6188020	6190220	that are going away.
6190220	6195340	Second thing is that literally all of the games affected are also natively available
6195340	6200100	on Xbox one where they will remain available and fully supported.
6200100	6205700	Most of the titles are included in the master chief collection.
6205700	6210340	The two that aren't halo wars and Spartan assault are natively available on their own.
6210340	6213740	If you're a game pass subscriber, you already have access to all of these.
6213740	6217660	If not, they're usually offered at deep discounts during every major sale.
6217660	6222580	Heck they're on sale right now, though only for a few more hours buying them all together
6222580	6227220	would cost about $35 at the moment, which is not bad for an entire series.
6227220	6230660	So I guess what I'm essentially saying is that this shouldn't be a big deal for most
6230660	6231740	people.
6231740	6238940	I suppose only the folks truly affected are those people still regularly playing on Xbox
6238940	6240060	360s.
6240060	6243900	As popular as it was, I can't imagine that there are too many of those left.
6243900	6246820	There's also people who don't own the newer systems.
6246820	6247820	Just saying.
6247820	6248820	Yeah.
6248820	6254060	I think also, sorry, I know there's more email, but just to kind of address that bullet point.
6254060	6255060	You're right.
6255060	6256980	And I don't want to dismiss anything YYR is saying.
6256980	6261000	I think Microsoft's done an excellent job of making sure the game is still playable
6261000	6262560	for most.
6262560	6265960	That being said, there, you know, cause we love our retro here on the show.
6265960	6270400	Of course, there is going to be a subsection of people that are very interested in playing
6270400	6277440	the game as it was in its original form, in its OG form, because as much as you know,
6277440	6282040	Microsoft's done a very good job porting that over with the, uh, master chief collection
6282040	6283040	and so forth.
6283040	6286080	There's always going to be a couple of people that are going to wonder what was it like
6286080	6287560	beforehand?
6287560	6293080	But I, I, I do like, I don't necessarily disagree with what YYR is saying.
6293080	6294240	Like there's, you're right.
6294240	6299080	There's, there's a lot of ways to still experience Halo and play it and have a good time.
6299080	6303960	Um, it's just, I think more of that archivist, you know, person that wants to see it in a
6303960	6308400	museum someday looking back and going, well, that's a bummer that the online is gone, but
6308400	6310320	we all know online never stays around forever.
6310320	6311320	Right.
6311320	6314520	So anyway, sorry, Jamie, but wanted to put that in there.
6314520	6319080	And by saying that I'm currently putting the finishing touches on the Pixel Poops remake,
6319080	6323960	I'm still on track to release sometime this month, though, I'm guessing it'll wind up
6323960	6325400	being toward the end.
6325400	6330000	The Commodore version definitely needs a bit more time in the oven as well.
6330000	6334920	I should be posting on the vlog discord sometime this week regarding testing opportunities.
6334920	6336840	So please look forward to that.
6336840	6340020	Happy pooping and of course happy gaming on the whole.
6340020	6342160	Happy new year, Aaron YYR.
6342160	6343760	Thank you for the update YYR.
6343760	6350200	I'm excited to play both versions of Pixel Poop, all the poop this year between the two
6350200	6352640	games that YYR is doing and the one that Loki's doing.
6352640	6357280	This is definitely the year of poop, as he said in that direct a couple of weeks ago.
6357280	6359280	So love it.
6359280	6361160	All right.
6361160	6362160	That's it for emails, right?
6362160	6363160	Yes.
6363160	6364160	Okay.
6364160	6370360	If you want to send us an email for a future week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
6370360	6373560	So I want to get some of the comments and questions from chat.
6373560	6378240	chatdeftinchat says, when are we finally doing an Among Us night?
6378240	6379600	Great question.
6379600	6384520	After AGDQ, but I really want to make sure we get that in sometime this month or I'll
6384520	6386040	keep putting it off.
6386040	6391760	So probably mid month and I'll try to stew on a good day with Bobby.
6391760	6393180	I'm assuming he wants to do it.
6393180	6397040	If he doesn't want to do it, then I'll work on it with Shane, who I know wants to do it.
6397040	6400060	And we'll try to get that like in the middle of it.
6400060	6404520	We got to get past AGDQ and I want to let Bobby get past his shifts and stuff before
6404520	6407400	we really worry about that.
6407400	6409820	But in the next week or two after that, for sure.
6409820	6412980	Oh, and some people are saying I just bought the game on the Steam sale.
6412980	6415660	Oh, that should be fun.
6415660	6416660	Other questions.
6416660	6417660	Oh, this is good.
6417660	6422320	Azet in chat says, should I submit the street light in front of my house for a Pokestop
6422320	6423320	or gym?
6423320	6424820	Sarcasm implied.
6424820	6425820	Okay.
6425820	6428200	So true story.
6428200	6431740	There was a virtual Ingress event that was going on yesterday.
6431740	6435340	And sometimes what people do is they'll get on to because, you know, it's been virtual
6435340	6437420	Ingress events for like nine months.
6437420	6439300	So people do like recharging of portals.
6439300	6444760	And then they also go on to I still call it OPR because that's what used to be called
6444760	6445760	back in the day.
6445760	6446760	Operation Portal Recon.
6446760	6449020	I think it's called Niantic Wayfarer is what it's called now.
6449020	6453320	And we go in and we review submissions together and they're getting worse and worse.
6453320	6457200	You guys like I was in there reviewing and there was a couple good ones that there was
6457200	6462860	a couple like, you know, play structures at parks, like the best ones I always see
6462860	6468100	are new parks where the street view doesn't show that the park is even built yet.
6468100	6471320	But the photos clearly show there's now a park there.
6471320	6473840	And that's like the best stuff that gets submitted.
6473840	6475460	But then there's so much garbage.
6475460	6479740	You guys like I saw street signs that were getting submitted.
6479740	6483740	I saw one where it was a street sign being submitted.
6483740	6486900	And I was like, this street sign is bad.
6486900	6490180	But how is this little free library in the game?
6490180	6491180	It shouldn't be in there either.
6491180	6494200	I actually put in the note, I'm like, get rid of the little free library next to it
6494200	6496800	because it's like in somebody's backyard.
6496800	6498560	If you look at where the pin is, it's terrible.
6498560	6500360	It's never gotten through the system.
6500360	6505380	Unfortunately, there are people and I knew this would happen when they let Pokemon Go
6505380	6506880	players into there.
6506880	6509840	And I'm not shading Pokemon Go players.
6509840	6511580	I play it too.
6511600	6518800	But the thing is, is that the Pokemon mentality is the more stops, the more gyms, the better
6518800	6520500	more and more and more and more and more.
6520500	6522760	And I get that because you want to be able to spin everything.
6522760	6526440	Who doesn't want to spin on their house for Pokeballs?
6526440	6531560	That is the worst possible thing for Ingress, which is a very player versus player type
6531560	6532560	of thing.
6532560	6534060	And there's what you would think.
6534060	6539480	I just wish that like at some point Niantic, if they're going to allow Pokemon players
6539480	6543580	to approve things, then only let it be approved for Pokemon.
6543580	6545700	Do not let it cross over in Ingress.
6545700	6546700	Because it's getting annoying.
6546700	6547980	It's the Harry Potter thing too.
6547980	6548980	Oh yeah.
6548980	6551820	I always forget about Harry Potter because of her.
6551820	6553220	But I just quit playing all of them.
6553220	6554220	Yeah.
6554220	6556880	But the you're right.
6556880	6558220	That all affects that too.
6558220	6561860	But even generally for Harry Potter, the more the better, I think.
6561860	6564640	So it's kind of the same thing as the Pokemon thing.
6564640	6566620	So it's just, oh yeah.
6566620	6568940	Azet saw a literal rock yesterday.
6569400	6570400	Yep.
6570400	6571400	That was the thing.
6571400	6578480	I saw, I got a stop in Mexico and I'm always usually like, okay, I know these like places
6578480	6584540	like Puerto Rico, Mexico, certain parts, remote Canada, you know, some of these other areas,
6584540	6586080	they need more stuff.
6586080	6590840	But the submission I got in Mexico was a telephone poll.
6590840	6594520	Wasn't painted or anything, just a telephone poll.
6594520	6597520	So it was, it was a no.
6597540	6598980	The description was in Spanish.
6598980	6601140	I didn't even need to run it through Google Translate.
6601140	6604020	I was like, I know what this is and it's garbage.
6604020	6610560	And the supporting statement is always, our neighborhood needs a Pokestop.
6610560	6613240	We need a Pokestop to engage more.
6613240	6615380	There's so many people here that would love a Pokestop.
6615380	6619820	I think I had one that was a laundry room in an apartment complex that was like, the
6619820	6622060	community needs a Pokestop here.
6622060	6624580	We're trying to make a gym and all this stuff.
6625360	6632200	I'm going to be honest, if that wording is in your justification, I'm already like down
6632200	6635060	a point in my mind.
6635060	6639780	If your only justification is we need a Pokestop, you're already down a point.
6639780	6644080	I have a, I don't want to say I always deny, but because there have been a couple that
6644080	6648900	were like park, again, like the park sign example where it's like, this park could use
6648900	6652160	a Pokestop, it's brand new and was just built.
6652160	6654220	I'm like, okay, fair.
6654220	6655780	It meets criteria.
6655780	6660780	I don't love that they're, they're relying only on Pokestop, but I get it.
6660780	6662780	Pokemon Go is the large game.
6662780	6668540	That's where people's brains are at, but you know, just, just remember, it's not only Pokemon
6668540	6670640	people that are reviewing those.
6670640	6676860	So anyway, uh, Tiger Claw says there's a gym located near a Burger King that used to be
6676860	6678160	a Pokestop.
6678160	6682280	That will happen when another Pokestop nearby gets promoted.
6682280	6685340	There's a whole science to it and I won't get into it too much on here.
6685340	6690220	You can read about it online, but basically if you take the map of the world and you split
6690220	6698060	it up into itty bitty squares, if there's two Pokestops in a square, one becomes a gym.
6698060	6703580	If there's five Pokestops in a gym, or excuse me, five Pokestops in a square, two become
6703580	6706020	a gym or is it seven?
6706020	6707300	Is that correct me if I'm wrong.
6707300	6710880	She knows more about this stuff than I do, but it's depending on how many things are
6710880	6713320	in that square, you get more and more gyms.
6713320	6717940	So the reason why the Burger King became a gym is because something became a stop right
6717940	6719300	by it.
6719300	6724740	And I'll give you this tip because not as many people talk about this tip, but we've
6724740	6726920	done it.
6726920	6733920	If you want to control which of the two becomes a gym, you can do that, but you have to have
6733920	6735080	ingress.
6735080	6741640	You don't even have to have a high level account, you can have a level one account.
6741640	6746160	The portal in ingress, because they're all portals in ingress, the portal that has more
6746160	6752600	up-boats on the photos combined overall will become the gym.
6752600	6758720	So this has happened, and I'll admit to this, is that some of the locals here will say,
6758720	6761280	hey, I got a new portal, it's over here.
6761280	6766540	This is going to trigger a gym, which one makes more sense to be the gym?
6766540	6771440	And we'll all go up-boat the photo on the one we want to be the gym so that it pushes
6771440	6773000	that as the gym.
6773000	6775040	So there it is.
6775040	6780800	So you can work the system in control, but you only have the 24 hours from when it goes
6780800	6784440	live to when it promotes to work that out.
6784440	6789640	Because once something becomes a gym, it doesn't regress based on the thumbs up.
6789680	6794600	The only way it regresses from being a gym is if it gets removed.
6794600	6799080	I think even if there's only one, I think if the other stop gets removed and you still
6799080	6800640	have a gym, I think it stays a gym.
6800640	6803960	I don't think anything demotes to stops ever.
6803960	6806640	So anyway, there you go.
6806640	6807640	The more you know.
6807640	6808640	All right.
6808640	6815920	And as that is clarifying that an S14 cell, two to five portals is a gym and six plus
6815920	6817060	equals another gym.
6817060	6818780	So six is the magic number.
6818780	6819780	All right.
6819780	6820780	There you go.
6820780	6823420	A little science on that for your GPS.
6823420	6829140	And again, I encourage people to submit pokey stops, but please just submit legit things.
6829140	6834120	Lots of signs on trails are great and we don't really have enough of them.
6834120	6836580	There's surely a walking trail in your neighborhood.
6836580	6840780	Just make sure you get the sign that officially designates it as a trail.
6840780	6844140	Parks, especially if there's new ones, great.
6844140	6845200	Churches, great.
6845200	6846460	Just make sure.
6846460	6850580	Try to stay away from gated churches or if it's going to be a gated church, then put
6850580	6854020	it on the sign that's out in the street and not inside the gates.
6854020	6856660	I think that's much better.
6856660	6859180	And you know, that type of stuff is great and fine.
6859180	6862380	And I have no problem approving those types of things.
6862380	6867820	But just what was the other here's the here's the all star winner from yesterday.
6867820	6874380	I think this is before we were chatting is that I got a trophy in someone's house.
6874380	6879300	It was a picture of a trophy in someone's house and it said their name and what award
6879300	6880300	they won.
6880300	6883460	And so when I rejected it, I put in the description.
6883460	6889780	Would so and so please stop submitting pokey stops where their name is easily identifiable?
6889780	6893300	And I said that is my reasoning.
6893300	6896300	All right.
6896300	6901900	Anyway, sadly, they don't they don't use I don't think they copy paste those reasonings
6901900	6902900	when they deny it.
6902900	6907660	I wish they would, because I've put some really like shady things in there that deserve to
6907660	6908660	be read.
6908660	6909660	All right.
6909660	6910780	Anyway, I think that's enough.
6910780	6912740	No more emails tonight.
6912740	6917100	So I think we're getting to the point where we wrap up the show.
6917100	6918460	Some last minute stories.
6918460	6919460	Oh, do you last minute stories?
6919460	6920460	All right.
6920460	6921460	Sure.
6921460	6922460	Yeah.
6922460	6923460	Did you say you had one too, Jamie?
6923460	6924780	I do have one and I just have one.
6924780	6927300	Why don't you go first, Jamie, then we'll do Loki.
6927300	6928300	Yeah.
6928700	6935100	Jared Nandan, who cosplayed as the South Park guy who play World of Warcraft, he died of
6935100	6936100	COVID-19.
6936100	6937100	That's terrible.
6937100	6943060	He was a big mainstay in the community, big cosplayer.
6943060	6948260	And he's actually a friend of some of my other friends.
6948260	6953220	So and he would go to the cons.
6953220	6957820	He had like his computer, kind of a computer that recreated the one in the show and the
6957820	6963660	table with all the candy and rock stars on it and everything.
6963660	6964660	And does L.T.J.
6964660	6965660	Rama ask?
6965660	6966780	No, I didn't know him in person.
6966780	6970220	I have friends who know him.
6970220	6974700	So I had heard things peripherally from other people.
6974700	6979140	So it was just sort of like six degrees kind of thing.
6979140	6983540	But yeah, he died for COVID.
6983540	6988420	There is a GoFundMe and Rama just said it, there's a GoFundMe to support the funeral
6988420	6991460	costs for his family.
6991460	6997740	So we can put it somewhere for people to find.
6997740	7001860	But if you can help, please consider helping.
7001860	7003220	That's sad.
7003220	7007120	It's hitting more and more close to home every day.
7007120	7009740	So please, please, please take precautions, folks.
7009740	7013300	I think most people listening to this show are, I don't need to lecture everybody, but
7013300	7019500	I'm just, you know, you don't think it'll affect you or anyone, you know, until it does.
7019500	7020500	That's the thing about it.
7020500	7025620	So actually, if Rama will post it, then I'd appreciate it.
7025620	7026620	Yeah.
7026620	7027620	All right.
7027620	7028620	Loki, let's go to it.
7028620	7030700	Let's go to you.
7030700	7040580	So I had a mod that's been created for Cyberpunk 2077 to allow for a sort of working third
7040580	7044020	person mod, which is kind of cool to be able to play it that game that way.
7044020	7048540	Now it's not perfect because there is quite the process to install it.
7048540	7052220	Plus it doesn't work in cut scenes because the game was meant to be played in a first
7052220	7053480	person view.
7053480	7057780	So there's not really a way to alter the cameras that much.
7057780	7059860	But it is still something.
7059860	7063400	So that's kind of cool that it is available.
7063400	7067900	And if you want to check it out, of course, it's on Nexus mods, so go check it out there.
7067900	7068900	Awesome.
7068900	7069900	Anything else?
7070220	7072220	That's it.
7072220	7073780	All right.
7073780	7076100	Then I think with that, we're about ready to wrap the show up again.
7076100	7079500	I know it's a little shorter tonight, but with the holiday and everything, it just that's
7079500	7080500	the way it was going to work out.
7080500	7084260	We kind of knew that we will be back next week, however, in seven days to talk about
7084260	7088540	whatever happens in the gaming industry next week, we will also be making our 2021 predictions
7088540	7089540	next week.
7089540	7093160	So that should be fun with you guys in our chat over Twitch TV slash VOG network.
7093160	7095940	So we'll help you join us in seven days.

7124620	7126780	That's VOG network dot com slash shop.
7126780	7131460	You can pick up some cool merchandise, including the OLR shirt that Loki's wearing on Twitch
7131460	7132560	tonight.
7132560	7135860	And I got to say, I really like the VOG shirt that I bought there.
7135860	7137320	It's a great shirt and good material.
7137320	7142980	So I and I'm not just saying that because I want the sale is it is a nice shirt.
7142980	7145480	So definitely encourage you to check out the shop.
7145480	7148500	We will be adding to it throughout the year.
7148500	7150500	Just not this week.
7150500	7151500	So check that out.
7151500	7153600	I think that's it.
7153600	7156540	Let's go around now and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap up for the night.
7156540	7158460	So, Loki, I'll start with you.
7158460	7159460	Your final thought tonight.
7159460	7163020	I'm just going to have to be working on my game quite a bit.
7163020	7168900	So hopefully we'll see some more progress on that soon.
7168900	7173820	And my final thought is, you know, just a continued message.
7173820	7175940	I guess I already said this, but, you know, stay safe.
7175940	7178820	Please take precautions.
7178820	7180100	We're almost there.
7180100	7181400	We're almost there.
7181400	7186320	If we can just get to the next administration who might get vaccines out a little bit faster
7186320	7190720	than the current one and so forth, we may have light at the end of the tunnel.
7190720	7193720	And please consider getting vaccinated when it's available.
7193720	7201700	I'm a little shocked at how many people are resisting the idea after all the clinical
7201700	7206120	trials that things went through and everybody that is saying and all the doctors and medical
7206120	7208140	experts that are saying it's safe.
7208140	7209520	I can't wait to get mine.
7209520	7213980	I'll be as soon as they let me I won't get so dark soccer.
7213980	7216360	Your final thought tonight.
7216360	7221460	I wish that we would implement what they did in Indonesia, that if you refuse to wear a
7221460	7226960	mask and I'll even add refuse to get the vaccine, you have to bury the bodies.
7226960	7227960	That's it.
7227960	7228960	Morbid.
7228960	7229960	But yes.
7229960	7230960	All right.
7230960	7231960	Have a great week, everybody.
7231960	7232960	We'll see you in seven days.
7232960	7234760	Happy gaming.
7234760	7236640	Try to make the best of the situation.
7236640	7238000	Enjoy your comfort games.
7238000	7241560	OK, enjoy your backlog, whatever it is you're gaming.
7241560	7242560	Have fun.
7242560	7244500	And we'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7244500	7245500	Have a great night, everyone.
