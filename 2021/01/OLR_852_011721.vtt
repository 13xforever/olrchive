00:00.000 --> 00:13.480
My Gaming Spheres never included Katy Perry, yet I recently learned that she recorded

00:13.480 --> 00:16.940
at least one of her songs in Simlish, the Sims language from The Sims, and this week

00:16.940 --> 00:20.500
Ms. Perry is signed on to be part of Pokemon's 25th anniversary.

00:20.500 --> 00:24.200
When I think of musicians significantly in gaming, I think about EDM mainstays, Marshmallow,

00:24.200 --> 00:27.380
Cascade, and all the other hypesters, but Ms. Perry is absolutely more appropriate and

00:27.380 --> 00:28.880
approachable for the Pokeverse.

00:28.880 --> 00:32.040
This is just my bubble of news and memory, it's now time for your hosts Rob Roberts,

00:32.040 --> 00:35.120
Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news,

00:35.120 --> 00:37.640
starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.640 --> 00:44.120
Hello my friends, out there on the internet, welcome back, it's another week of the show

00:44.120 --> 00:52.080
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio Live, once again, January the 17th of

00:52.080 --> 00:58.000
2021, with episode number 852 of our show.

00:58.120 --> 01:04.840
I am Rob Roberts joining you here in our studio where we always gathered every week to talk

01:04.840 --> 01:10.040
live about the latest and greatest in video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.

01:10.040 --> 01:13.880
Obviously for obvious reasons, I don't need to detail right now, for the last nine months

01:13.880 --> 01:18.200
we've been doing our show in a virtual format, so joining me via the magic of Discord, say

01:18.200 --> 01:20.760
hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:20.760 --> 01:21.760
Hello.

01:21.760 --> 01:23.760
Hi, how are you?

01:23.760 --> 01:26.720
I'm a little frustrated, but okay.

01:26.760 --> 01:30.960
Well, for what it's worth, you sound great right now, so don't change a thing.

01:30.960 --> 01:36.160
Well, honestly, I need a wrench to tighten up this one little bolt on here.

01:36.160 --> 01:40.760
I've been figuring what's going on with my mic is that there's some loose bits on my

01:40.760 --> 01:47.400
arm, and so if I put it in just the right way, it starts drooping down because gravity

01:47.400 --> 01:48.400
always wins.

01:48.400 --> 01:52.680
Y'all were missing Dark Sakura before the show playing with power tools, or actually

01:52.680 --> 01:54.280
I did a, for those that-

01:54.280 --> 01:55.280
What do you mean?

01:55.280 --> 01:56.280
It's a screwdriver.

01:56.840 --> 02:01.360
Well, you got to put some power in that tool, but that's right.

02:01.360 --> 02:02.360
How about the gun show?

02:02.360 --> 02:03.680
There we go.

02:03.680 --> 02:08.760
But so part of the joy of doing this show live, and I put joy in quotes, because we

02:08.760 --> 02:14.160
do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern ish, right after

02:14.160 --> 02:20.120
the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG network.

02:20.120 --> 02:25.000
And the joy of being here for the live stuff is that sometimes we screw up and you get

02:25.000 --> 02:26.040
to see it live.

02:26.800 --> 02:30.600
So tonight I had a false start where I actually, so you know, I'm sure many of you have used

02:30.600 --> 02:35.200
Open Broadcaster Studio, just like we do, and you know the magic of scenes, and sometimes

02:35.200 --> 02:38.300
you might click on the wrong scene or push the wrong button.

02:38.300 --> 02:41.880
And that's what happened tonight is that it played the little pre-show, did the little

02:41.880 --> 02:46.120
bumper, it says VOG network, then it went right to us and Jamie's sitting there trying

02:46.120 --> 02:51.560
to get the microphone going, and I'm like, oops, I hit the wrong button.

02:51.560 --> 02:52.560
Take two.

02:53.560 --> 02:58.160
I mean, I certainly don't mind showing the stuff that happens behind the scenes to the,

02:58.160 --> 03:00.560
you know, 25 people watching right now.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.480
It's it's whatever.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.480
Screw ups happen.

03:03.480 --> 03:04.480
It's whatever.

03:04.480 --> 03:06.840
Anyway, say hello to somebody.

03:06.840 --> 03:10.280
No, say hello to somebody who never screws up.

03:10.280 --> 03:11.880
It's Techmaster Loki.

03:11.880 --> 03:13.280
I do all the time.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.360
I don't know what you're talking about.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.360
OK, that's true.

03:16.360 --> 03:17.360
No, I'm kidding.

03:17.360 --> 03:18.360
How are you?

03:18.360 --> 03:19.720
Ah, my head hurts.

03:19.720 --> 03:21.720
Other than that, I'm good.

03:21.880 --> 03:28.460
So the chatters have correctly called out, I believe, that you've got Scott Pilgrim.

03:28.460 --> 03:30.640
Is that the new one or the old one playing behind you?

03:30.640 --> 03:33.960
I mean, I know it's the same thing, but the remaster is the same.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.680
Well, one's remastered, so it looks a little.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.120
I was watching.

03:37.120 --> 03:42.640
So our pal Ranma from Anime Jam Session was playing on Saturday night, Friday night.

03:42.640 --> 03:43.640
I don't remember.

03:43.640 --> 03:44.640
It was some point.

03:44.640 --> 03:48.480
And I was watching for a few minutes and I did kind of go, oh, this looks a lot cleaner.

03:48.480 --> 03:49.480
Like it's a lot crisper.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.040
He really just comes through.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.040
I think.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.040
Yeah, it's the old one.

03:53.040 --> 03:54.040
OK.

03:54.040 --> 03:56.280
But still, it's close enough, right?

03:56.280 --> 03:57.280
Close enough.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.280
Yeah, it's fine.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.560
I was too late to get the new one.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.300
Have you seen that meme going around?

04:02.300 --> 04:06.580
And Dark Soccer, you can appreciate this one, too, about how nobody watched Scott Pilgrim

04:06.580 --> 04:07.880
for Scott.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.140
And it's always like all these supporting characters.

04:10.140 --> 04:16.080
And if you think about it, like that movie, which I think is only aged better as like

04:16.080 --> 04:19.160
that's one of those movies you look back and is going to really define.

04:19.160 --> 04:24.400
I think that period of time, just like like people look fondly back on 80s movies like

04:24.400 --> 04:27.800
Ferris Bueller's Day Off and some of that, like I think Scott Pilgrim's one of those movies

04:27.800 --> 04:33.360
that kind of represents the arts or whatever you want to call it, like really well.

04:33.360 --> 04:38.040
But I had such some people like Empire Records is one I think that's more 90s.

04:38.040 --> 04:39.280
But yes, I would.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.400
That is definitely one of those movies, for sure.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.560
But like well, and Tiger Claw and Chat says, actually, you know, you're right.

04:44.560 --> 04:48.340
I was thinking of I don't know, I'm stuck in the 90s right now.

04:48.340 --> 04:53.820
Me every day, Tiger Claw and Chat says probably just for Brie Larson, in part, but it's not

04:53.820 --> 04:54.820
just her.

04:54.820 --> 04:55.820
What?

04:55.820 --> 04:56.820
Aubrey Plaza.

04:56.820 --> 04:58.060
Aubrey Plaza's in it.

04:58.060 --> 05:00.780
Anna Kendrick's in it.

05:00.780 --> 05:04.420
The Superman guy in it, whose name I can't remember in the moment.

05:04.420 --> 05:05.420
Chris Evans?

05:05.420 --> 05:06.980
No, he's in it too.

05:06.980 --> 05:08.980
He's Captain America.

05:08.980 --> 05:09.980
He's in it, too.

05:09.980 --> 05:11.540
Brandon Routh.

05:11.540 --> 05:12.540
That's it.

05:12.540 --> 05:13.540
He's in it, too.

05:13.540 --> 05:15.140
They're all in it.

05:15.140 --> 05:19.540
So it's it's it's got like such a huge, strong supporting cast.

05:19.540 --> 05:23.180
And yeah, I love I think that's one of those movies that just gets better the older it

05:23.180 --> 05:24.180
gets.

05:24.180 --> 05:29.020
And I did I did a cult movie screening of it a couple of years ago, whenever the 10th

05:29.020 --> 05:30.100
anniversary was.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.580
And that was a really fun show.

05:31.580 --> 05:34.140
I really want to host that again.

05:34.140 --> 05:36.060
And maybe they'll pair it with Kung Fury again.

05:36.060 --> 05:37.060
I don't know.

05:37.060 --> 05:38.300
Or we'll do Kung Fury was great.

05:38.300 --> 05:39.300
We'll do it.

05:39.300 --> 05:40.300
That was the double feature.

05:40.300 --> 05:41.300
And it was a great double feature.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.620
But or maybe we'll Kung Fury has a great soundtrack.

05:43.620 --> 05:45.220
We'll pair it with the game.

05:45.220 --> 05:48.660
We'll have somebody play through the game live and then watch the movie.

05:48.660 --> 05:49.660
Who knows?

05:49.660 --> 05:50.660
Anything?

05:50.660 --> 05:51.660
Anything?

05:51.660 --> 05:57.120
Going in to chat Bobby Blackwell says the scientist in Picard was in it really see.

05:57.120 --> 06:03.300
It's all these people that ended up like that that movie jump started their careers seriously.

06:03.300 --> 06:06.420
And it's so quotable and has all the all the gifts from it.

06:06.420 --> 06:11.180
I think it was just Dark Sakura literally in a text message the other day.

06:11.180 --> 06:16.500
Cred makes you fat like that was literally a thing that we were talking about the other

06:16.500 --> 06:17.500
day.

06:17.500 --> 06:18.500
Yeah.

06:18.500 --> 06:19.500
Anyway, love it.

06:19.500 --> 06:20.500
All right.

06:20.500 --> 06:21.900
I love that movie.

06:21.900 --> 06:23.180
Me too.

06:23.180 --> 06:27.580
Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, which is about Nintendo and some of the things

06:27.580 --> 06:29.540
that they are continuing to do legally.

06:29.540 --> 06:32.800
Loki, you want to talk about this for us because you probably been following this a little

06:32.800 --> 06:34.060
better than I have.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.060
Yeah.

06:35.060 --> 06:40.380
So there was a channel stack smashing who he does a lot of like different like kind

06:40.380 --> 06:44.620
of console hacking and whatnot, just for the fun of it, I guess.

06:44.620 --> 06:46.220
Oh, so he was sorry.

06:46.220 --> 06:50.340
Quick shout out to our discord over at vog network dot com slash discord, because that's

06:50.340 --> 06:52.040
where I first heard about this.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.940
So this story actually kind of came from there this week.

06:53.940 --> 06:55.580
So vog network dot com slash discord.

06:55.580 --> 06:58.000
I don't shout that out enough at the top of the show.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.300
So I got my quota in for the week.

07:00.300 --> 07:01.300
Sorry, Loki.

07:01.300 --> 07:02.300
Yeah.

07:02.300 --> 07:04.860
Well, we talked about like this guy before he was the one that put out the YouTube videos

07:04.860 --> 07:13.580
on hacking the Game & Watch to actually put different custom ROMs on there and different

07:13.580 --> 07:14.580
mods.

07:14.580 --> 07:19.220
So this was the same guy that was kind of showing that progress along the way.

07:19.220 --> 07:23.020
And of course, because it's something that Nintendo didn't like, they went ahead and

07:23.020 --> 07:32.540
did a copyright strike against it, claiming that he is violating their copyright by putting

07:32.540 --> 07:38.740
this educational video about how to reverse engineer the Game & Watch, which in tech,

07:38.740 --> 07:41.260
I think that completely falls into fair use.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.260
But, you know, it's a Nintendo.

07:42.260 --> 07:44.140
And what what are you going to do soon?

07:44.140 --> 07:45.140
Nintendo?

07:45.140 --> 07:46.140
Are you going to fight against them?

07:46.140 --> 07:47.780
I mean, there's nothing you can do.

07:47.780 --> 07:50.420
So he asked Katari about that one.

07:50.420 --> 07:51.420
Yeah.

07:51.420 --> 07:57.300
He's basically put out he's re-uploaded the videos and blurred out the stuff that has

07:57.300 --> 08:00.580
Nintendo's IP in it.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.500
But it's still really stupid.

08:02.500 --> 08:08.140
He has filed a counterclaim, but he doesn't think that it's going to get dropped, that

08:08.140 --> 08:12.700
they're just going to leave it as a copyright strike because they don't like people hacking

08:12.700 --> 08:14.700
their stuff.

08:14.700 --> 08:19.460
Actually, Dark Sakura, I didn't even think about that comparison, but you really hit

08:19.460 --> 08:23.560
can you elaborate on your joke a little bit for those that may not get it?

08:23.560 --> 08:25.300
So you said ask Katari about that one.

08:25.300 --> 08:26.300
Can you elaborate on that?

08:26.300 --> 08:30.620
Because I actually think you you've struck a really interesting parallel here.

08:30.620 --> 08:39.660
Well, there was just the business that led to Tengen, you know, becoming a thing is that

08:39.660 --> 08:45.820
Tengen had people reverse engineer part of Nintendo's hardware.

08:45.820 --> 08:53.060
And granted, it was under some false pretenses, but it was going back and forth on did they

08:53.060 --> 08:55.820
you know, what did they do with how did they obtain it?

08:55.820 --> 08:56.820
What did they get?

08:56.820 --> 09:04.460
You know what, who has a license to release games on on third party cartridges, you know,

09:04.460 --> 09:13.060
without the Nintendo seal of format cartridges for all of that, you know, had to do with

09:13.060 --> 09:19.220
bypassing Nintendo's chip that's in the logic board of the system.

09:19.220 --> 09:25.600
So that was a big back and forth and it did not work out all that great for Atari, really.

09:25.600 --> 09:31.040
Well, they they still got the ability to sell those cartridges, but the Tetris thing

09:31.040 --> 09:33.440
ended up but that was kind of a separate issue.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.380
The Tetris thing was a completely different issue.

09:35.380 --> 09:40.200
And in the end, what I'm saying is about what how it worked out for Atari in the end.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.520
Who are we left with?

09:41.520 --> 09:42.520
We have Nintendo.

09:42.520 --> 09:43.520
Fair.

09:43.520 --> 09:45.000
Atari is is an IP.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Fair.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
No.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
And you know what, though?

09:48.000 --> 09:51.360
But those the and for those that might remember back in the day, those Tengen cartridges were

09:51.360 --> 09:52.400
shaped differently.

09:52.400 --> 09:56.960
They were different cartridges because Nintendo had a patent on their cartridge.

09:56.960 --> 10:01.640
Atari through Tengen essentially reverse engineered how to make a Nintendo game work on the Nintendo

10:01.640 --> 10:03.840
and came up with their own and their false pretenses.

10:03.840 --> 10:04.840
Yes.

10:04.840 --> 10:05.840
Yes.

10:05.840 --> 10:06.840
And came up with their own cartridge.

10:06.840 --> 10:10.640
But at the end of the day, they won that lawsuit that allowed them to continue selling the

10:10.640 --> 10:17.560
cartridges because they were allowed to basically illegally, even though it was reverse engineered,

10:17.560 --> 10:18.720
it was a little bit shady.

10:18.720 --> 10:19.720
They did lose.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.440
They had to pay a lot for the reverse engineering.

10:21.480 --> 10:22.480
Yeah.

10:22.480 --> 10:25.000
And they did lose some other things when it came to like Tetris.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
But that was a completely different issue is that the license for the arcade, which

10:29.000 --> 10:33.760
our Atari had, and the license for home gaming, which Nintendo had, ended up having to be

10:33.760 --> 10:34.960
proved to be a different thing.

10:34.960 --> 10:39.520
Atari did not have the ability to put Tetris out for console.

10:39.520 --> 10:43.360
There's just because I thought there was a lot more that there's a lot more going on

10:43.360 --> 10:45.160
to the Tetris debacle than just that.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.160
Yes.

10:46.160 --> 10:49.680
But to to simplify it into a three hour show, I think I hit on the big points.

10:49.680 --> 10:50.680
But you're right.

10:50.920 --> 10:53.120
Yes, it does go deeper than that.

10:53.120 --> 10:57.960
And Bobby Black Wolf in our chat over at twitch.tv slash Vogue Network points out a couple other

10:57.960 --> 10:59.960
parallels here.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.440
Universal sued over Donkey Kong and lost.

11:02.440 --> 11:05.440
So Nintendo's Galoob wasn't there wins and losses in court.

11:05.440 --> 11:09.600
And yes, it follows it right up with Galoob and the Sega Genesis.

11:09.600 --> 11:10.600
Yep.

11:10.600 --> 11:16.320
So it's because they have reverse engineered because Sega wanted money, a certain percentage

11:16.320 --> 11:19.300
for their to be able to publish on their system.

11:19.420 --> 11:22.900
And so they just reverse engineer and create all their tools so they wouldn't have to pay

11:22.900 --> 11:23.900
that.

11:23.900 --> 11:28.660
It's it's it's a total EA thing, but they did that as well.

11:28.660 --> 11:35.060
And it's I wanted to kind of conclude my Tengen tangent tangent tangent.

11:35.060 --> 11:36.900
That's an interesting little thing.

11:36.900 --> 11:40.500
But with what Dark Soccer was saying about it didn't work out very well for Atari in

11:40.500 --> 11:46.580
the end is that those cartridges didn't really end up having great sales.

11:46.580 --> 11:50.780
And then there were other not like Color Dreams was one company that came in and started

11:50.780 --> 11:51.780
making cartridges.

11:51.780 --> 11:54.460
Other companies started coming in and making bootleg cartridges, his Bible company.

11:54.460 --> 11:58.580
And the Bible companies did to excuse me.

11:58.580 --> 11:59.580
And you know what?

11:59.580 --> 12:02.780
They all had a reputation for being shitty games.

12:02.780 --> 12:06.760
Like name one of those games that was good.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.900
Tetris was good.

12:08.900 --> 12:10.960
Klax was pretty good, actually.

12:10.960 --> 12:16.020
But like most of the and not even just taking it like the other the others from the Color

12:16.020 --> 12:18.060
Dreams in the Bible, none of them were good.

12:18.060 --> 12:22.460
So an interesting thing is that Nintendo and this kind of worked out in Nintendo's favor

12:22.460 --> 12:28.160
is that all all those games like you knew if it wasn't in an actual Nintendo cartridge,

12:28.160 --> 12:30.900
it was probably going to be a shit game.

12:30.900 --> 12:34.860
And so Nintendo kind of won on the intellectual side with that a little bit.

12:34.860 --> 12:36.980
It's kind of fascinating how that worked out.

12:36.980 --> 12:40.220
And you know, again, this is a tangent fantasy zone.

12:40.220 --> 12:42.820
Oh, I forgot they did that one.

12:42.820 --> 12:43.820
That's right.

12:43.820 --> 12:46.900
The Sega crossovers that Tengen did.

12:46.900 --> 12:47.900
That's right.

12:47.900 --> 12:48.900
OK.

12:48.900 --> 12:51.340
And the color palettes in the two of them were a little bit different.

12:51.340 --> 12:52.340
I mean.

12:52.340 --> 12:53.340
Oh, hi, Dan.

12:53.340 --> 12:57.780
My husband's bringing me my soda.

12:57.780 --> 12:58.780
I have priorities.

12:58.780 --> 12:59.780
Be right back.

12:59.780 --> 13:00.780
It's fine.

13:00.780 --> 13:01.780
OK.

13:01.780 --> 13:02.780
Anyway.

13:02.780 --> 13:03.780
All right.

13:03.780 --> 13:04.780
So.

13:04.780 --> 13:05.780
So anyway.

13:05.780 --> 13:07.500
But I think the point is with this whole like aside is that, you know, Nintendo has

13:07.500 --> 13:13.780
tried to assert some of their you know, you can't hack this whole thing and all this.

13:13.780 --> 13:16.220
And they've lost before on this.

13:16.220 --> 13:20.760
So it is interesting and kind of going back to what Loki was saying, it is interesting

13:20.760 --> 13:25.900
that you have a guy on YouTube that's putting all this together, but kind of is in a situation

13:25.900 --> 13:29.260
where he can't like legally he isn't Atari.

13:29.260 --> 13:33.620
He doesn't have the power to go up against Nintendo, even if he believes that what he's

13:33.620 --> 13:35.020
doing is fair use.

13:35.020 --> 13:42.740
I kind of like I get Nintendo's logic and I get why Nintendo legal is doing this, because

13:42.740 --> 13:45.520
they obviously don't want that instruction out there.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.020
It's not great for them.

13:47.020 --> 13:49.100
It doesn't do anything, though.

13:49.100 --> 13:50.100
It's not hurting anything.

13:50.100 --> 13:55.900
It's not like it's not like breaking it open, like say the NES mini or something like that.

13:55.900 --> 13:58.140
There's no flash storage on there.

13:58.140 --> 13:59.140
Right.

13:59.140 --> 14:02.360
There's enough room for like a ROM one.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.220
You can't really do much with it.

14:04.220 --> 14:08.380
I mean, they're saying that there's maybe modifications that they can do to replace

14:08.380 --> 14:13.420
that chip with a larger chip, but it's pretty much just for funsies.

14:13.420 --> 14:14.660
It's not really doing anything.

14:14.660 --> 14:16.100
It's not going to hurt their bottom line.

14:16.100 --> 14:22.140
If anything, it causes people to want that even more and maybe up the sales there.

14:22.140 --> 14:26.020
And well, you know, and I think ultimately what happens to Nintendo here, and I think

14:26.020 --> 14:31.780
this is one of the most overused phrases from armchair critics on the Internet, but it really

14:31.780 --> 14:32.940
does apply here.

14:32.940 --> 14:38.020
It's that whole Streisand effect thing, which, you know, if you've ever heard about.

14:38.020 --> 14:42.740
Well, not that Streisand effect, but the whole the pictures of her house and like she

14:42.740 --> 14:47.020
sued to get those pictures, and then that the picture ended up everywhere of her house.

14:47.020 --> 14:51.580
It was like if she hadn't called legal attention to it, it probably never would have really

14:51.580 --> 14:53.020
been picked up.

14:53.020 --> 14:59.780
And like Anne Rice suing fan fiction writers that or that, too, I suppose, even though

14:59.780 --> 15:03.100
my mind goes to Fifty Shades of Grey, even though, of course, that's not an Anne Rice

15:03.100 --> 15:06.620
thing, but a fan fiction that got way bigger than it needed to be.

15:06.620 --> 15:10.220
Yeah, but Anne Rice was suing people writing fan fiction of her work.

15:10.220 --> 15:11.220
True.

15:11.220 --> 15:16.020
So but but my point is and why I invoke that over invoked phrase of the Streisand effect

15:16.020 --> 15:21.060
is I kind of think what happens here is that now, like all these, you know, podcasts, news

15:21.060 --> 15:25.620
organizations and so forth that get blogs that are talking about this story are just

15:25.620 --> 15:30.460
calling a light on to, hey, if you want to hack your game and watch, Nintendo doesn't

15:30.460 --> 15:34.860
want you to see it, which makes people want to trade it even more.

15:34.900 --> 15:38.700
So I I almost feel like it's going to have the reverse effect.

15:38.700 --> 15:39.780
Would you agree with that, Loki?

15:41.300 --> 15:42.820
Yeah, I just don't understand.

15:42.820 --> 15:46.740
I mean, I get what they're trying to do, but I don't think it's going to necessarily work.

15:46.740 --> 15:53.100
And honestly, it feels like a misuse of their copyright claim system, because, you know,

15:53.100 --> 15:57.420
if you say something nice about the game and watch, they're not taking your video down.

15:57.420 --> 16:03.580
But if you say something critical or talk about this in an educational way, well, they're

16:03.580 --> 16:04.580
going to take the video down.

16:05.460 --> 16:11.700
OK, I will agree with you to a point, but like educational like that's that's the word

16:11.700 --> 16:13.620
we use to scapegoat the real meaning.

16:13.620 --> 16:15.300
Like, let's just call it what it is.

16:15.300 --> 16:16.420
What laws are they breaking?

16:16.420 --> 16:19.220
There's no laws against reverse engineering hardware there.

16:19.220 --> 16:19.860
They're there.

16:19.860 --> 16:21.220
You own everything.

16:21.220 --> 16:24.980
It's not like you're they're saying, well, if you do this, they'll allow you to pirate

16:24.980 --> 16:25.700
all these games.

16:25.700 --> 16:26.900
It is nothing.

16:26.900 --> 16:28.900
It's modifying your own hardware.

16:28.900 --> 16:31.540
I don't disagree with that, but let's call it what it is.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.980
You don't own your own the devices that you buy from them.

16:35.700 --> 16:38.580
No, I it's it's the same thing about like

16:39.860 --> 16:44.660
hacking phones, hacking portable watches to play Doom on.

16:44.660 --> 16:45.620
It's all that stuff.

16:45.620 --> 16:46.900
It's the same thing.

16:46.900 --> 16:51.860
But Nintendo just doesn't like it because it's how to load a ROM, which they they really

16:51.860 --> 16:55.460
don't like, because because here's the gag, everyone.

16:55.460 --> 16:58.500
This is why it's such a big deal, why Nintendo shutting it down.

16:58.500 --> 17:04.420
Nintendo absolutely wants to do more of these with other games from their archive.

17:05.140 --> 17:05.860
Duh.

17:05.860 --> 17:09.860
That's why they're shutting it down, because they plan to release plenty more of these

17:09.860 --> 17:11.140
this coming holiday.

17:11.140 --> 17:12.900
Absolutely, absolutely.

17:12.900 --> 17:17.140
And they don't want you to make your own, basically.

17:17.140 --> 17:22.020
So but all I'm saying is that call it what it's educating how to side load a ROM like

17:22.020 --> 17:23.700
that's that's what it is.

17:23.700 --> 17:29.460
But I again, I feel like the people that really want to do that are going to do it without

17:29.460 --> 17:30.180
YouTube's help.

17:30.820 --> 17:37.220
And now all these people now know that didn't know before that you can side load and hack

17:37.220 --> 17:39.060
a game and watch if you didn't know that before.

17:39.860 --> 17:40.180
All right.

17:40.820 --> 17:43.940
Yeah, I just think it's it's not going to make any difference.

17:44.820 --> 17:48.580
I'm going to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.

17:49.140 --> 17:54.100
Phoenix 7726 says they could not stop any modern system from being hacked and this won't

17:54.100 --> 17:54.900
work either.

17:54.900 --> 17:58.740
They're wasting time and money fighting a battle whose best outcome is Pyrrhic.

17:59.940 --> 18:00.340
Pyrrhic.

18:00.340 --> 18:00.740
Excuse me.

18:01.300 --> 18:04.580
And Tigerclaws says, imagine a Legend of Zelda game and watch.

18:05.540 --> 18:06.100
Of course.

18:06.820 --> 18:07.620
Why wouldn't they?

18:09.700 --> 18:12.580
And then Bobby Black Wolf says, you don't have to imagine it.

18:12.580 --> 18:15.380
You can do it now, thanks to educational videos.

18:16.900 --> 18:17.940
If you can find them.

18:17.940 --> 18:25.940
Yes, but maybe maybe the word education works in the sense that even if they take the video

18:25.940 --> 18:27.780
down, there will always be a textbook.

18:28.740 --> 18:35.940
Like, I don't know if y'all know, but even if they were to shut down Facebook, Twitter,

18:36.820 --> 18:39.700
whatever social media companies, they all shut down everything.

18:40.340 --> 18:42.740
You could still email like you used to.

18:42.740 --> 18:45.860
You could pick up the phone and call somebody like you used to.

18:45.860 --> 18:50.180
Like, there's still all these other ways to get information out there.

18:50.900 --> 18:53.540
Anyway, let's just go back to LiveJournal.

18:53.540 --> 18:54.580
Yeah, right.

18:55.460 --> 18:56.180
No, actually, no.

18:56.180 --> 18:57.620
LiveJournal got sold.

18:57.620 --> 18:58.980
It's all about dead journal.

19:00.660 --> 19:01.220
Dead journal.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.100
Dark Sakura had a dead journal.

19:04.100 --> 19:05.620
I know that you're muted, by the way.

19:06.740 --> 19:07.700
You muted Dark Sakura.

19:10.580 --> 19:12.340
I have a permanent LiveJournal.

19:12.340 --> 19:12.980
Oh, me too.

19:12.980 --> 19:13.540
Yeah, me too.

19:13.860 --> 19:19.620
And I'm kind of tempted to go back and use it because I kind of kind of sick of stuff.

19:19.620 --> 19:20.900
There's things about it that I miss.

19:21.780 --> 19:23.140
I met my husband on LiveJournal.

19:23.140 --> 19:24.820
I've said that a million times on this show.

19:24.820 --> 19:27.700
Like, I met Extifer, who I've done shows with.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.740
I met on LiveJournal.

19:28.740 --> 19:29.620
My other old roommate.

19:29.620 --> 19:30.740
I'm at a live with him.

19:30.740 --> 19:33.940
I've I've met lots of people because of LiveJournal.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.300
Kind of you guys in a way.

19:35.940 --> 19:41.300
Like, I mean, it's more DDR freak, but I still think we all kind of like kept in touch better

19:41.300 --> 19:43.300
because of something like LiveJournal.

19:43.700 --> 19:47.140
I think that's the story about a lot of my friendships that I formed around that era.

19:47.140 --> 19:51.300
You know, people like you guys, people like Shane, people like, you know, other guests

19:51.300 --> 19:57.540
you've seen on this show before is that like we may not have like met, but we got to be

19:57.540 --> 20:02.980
closer because of LiveJournal and, you know, reading each other's stuff when it wasn't

20:02.980 --> 20:05.620
about like shocking links and things like that.

20:05.620 --> 20:09.300
Phoenix 7726 is suggesting we could go back to Friendster.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.060
Is that even still around anymore?

20:11.060 --> 20:11.460
Is that it?

20:11.460 --> 20:11.700
Yeah.

20:11.700 --> 20:12.980
Is that still around?

20:12.980 --> 20:19.700
I know it was huge in like certain parts of Asia for a while, like long after Facebook.

20:19.700 --> 20:20.980
There's no line.

20:20.980 --> 20:22.900
Yeah, he's lying.

20:23.460 --> 20:28.260
SSG100 Matt is saying they also got burned by the folks using our three cards in the

20:28.260 --> 20:28.900
past.

20:28.900 --> 20:31.380
So this is just them getting ahead of the modding stuff.

20:31.380 --> 20:34.180
Well, this is this isn't even that's completely different.

20:34.180 --> 20:35.060
It is different.

20:35.060 --> 20:35.460
Yeah.

20:35.460 --> 20:37.140
You don't you don't need anything else.

20:37.140 --> 20:38.660
That's the key thing, right?

20:38.660 --> 20:38.900
Yeah.

20:38.900 --> 20:39.060
Yeah.

20:39.060 --> 20:42.660
This is like it's so limited in scope what you can do with this.

20:43.540 --> 20:48.580
I would say like the R3 stuff that's similar to what you have with like the mini systems.

20:50.260 --> 20:51.460
This is nothing like it.

20:51.460 --> 20:58.180
You can literally you have to have like probes and special equipment to be able to actually

20:58.180 --> 21:00.660
dump and put ROMs on there.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.820
It's such an arduous process to do it.

21:04.820 --> 21:08.980
That's like not even really worth it for most people to do it other than just a tinker with

21:08.980 --> 21:09.700
something.

21:09.700 --> 21:13.060
It's just I don't understand why they would even bother with this.

21:13.060 --> 21:15.700
It's just it's such a ridiculous thing.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.700
Like I don't know.

21:17.700 --> 21:22.660
I don't see them cracking down on the NES mini hacking and the SNES mini hacking.

21:22.660 --> 21:24.900
I mean, those videos are all over the place.

21:24.900 --> 21:26.900
Like why this?

21:26.900 --> 21:27.700
I don't know.

21:27.700 --> 21:28.340
It's silly.

21:29.060 --> 21:30.180
Zelda Game and Watch.

21:30.180 --> 21:31.380
Yeah, Zelda Game and Watch.

21:31.380 --> 21:31.700
That's why.

21:31.700 --> 21:34.740
But even still, like even if they put it out, it's still going to sell like crazy.

21:34.740 --> 21:36.260
This will literally affect nothing.

21:37.220 --> 21:41.700
Phoenix 7726 says this very tongue in cheek.

21:41.700 --> 21:44.020
OLRBBS at Rob Roberts.

21:44.020 --> 21:51.860
Dude, BBS is like if you want to know why I'm so screwed up, that's because I was on

21:51.860 --> 22:01.940
BBS's nonstop from like the age of fuck, probably like 12 years old until I remember being on

22:01.940 --> 22:05.380
a BBS and people were trying to get me to go see Rocky Horror Picture Show.

22:05.380 --> 22:06.740
This was long before I was supposed to.

22:06.740 --> 22:08.340
I was like 13 years old.

22:10.340 --> 22:13.060
But people didn't know that because it was a BBS.

22:13.060 --> 22:14.180
Couldn't see people.

22:14.180 --> 22:18.900
I was on BBS's from the time I was like 12 years old until probably well into high school,

22:18.900 --> 22:20.020
probably 17 or 18.

22:20.020 --> 22:23.940
Whenever Prodigy, no, Prodigy was kind of in the middle of that.

22:23.940 --> 22:25.060
But you guys know what I mean.

22:25.060 --> 22:32.420
Like, haven't I joked on this show before we ought to have a VOG network BBS so we can

22:32.420 --> 22:36.500
still play The Pit and Legend of the Dragon, Legend of the Drag Queens.

22:39.220 --> 22:43.540
Sorry to play Legend of the Dragon, Legend of the Red Dragon.

22:46.020 --> 22:52.820
And yes, I would play Legend of the Dragons and Trade Wars 2002, which is which that year

22:52.820 --> 22:54.260
is long past trade wars.

22:54.260 --> 22:54.900
Huh, Rob?

22:54.900 --> 22:55.540
Trade.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.020
Do you remember?

22:56.020 --> 22:57.380
Do you remember Trade Wars?

22:57.380 --> 22:59.140
It was like I didn't do BBS's.

22:59.140 --> 23:01.460
Oh, you got a I was not.

23:01.460 --> 23:03.140
I was not one of one of them.

23:03.140 --> 23:04.740
I was an AOL kid.

23:04.740 --> 23:05.540
OK, OK.

23:06.660 --> 23:07.220
I did.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.220
I did BBS's for a while.

23:10.100 --> 23:11.140
It was kind of just.

23:12.500 --> 23:17.140
You know, there wasn't really Internet access, and then eventually there was a local BBS

23:17.140 --> 23:19.780
that actually allowed you to connect to the Internet.

23:19.780 --> 23:24.260
So you connect through the BBS and then you'd be able to launch a Web browser somehow to

23:24.260 --> 23:25.540
be able to connect to the Internet.

23:25.540 --> 23:27.220
And so I was all over that.

23:27.220 --> 23:33.140
And then that was that was back when then net zero was a thing for a while.

23:33.140 --> 23:36.820
And then I was on that forever because it's free.

23:37.460 --> 23:40.420
And then I don't remember.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.820
Eventually we got high speed Internet somehow.

23:42.820 --> 23:44.340
So like, I don't know.

23:44.340 --> 23:47.460
That wasn't until I think that wasn't until I moved in with Rob.

23:47.460 --> 23:48.980
We got high speed Internet.

23:48.980 --> 23:54.340
BBS was the beginning of the end was when they all got email and you could start getting

23:54.340 --> 23:56.180
email on your BBS account.

23:56.180 --> 23:59.380
And it was kind of like that was when they all started to kind of start to merge into

23:59.380 --> 23:59.620
one.

23:59.620 --> 24:02.100
And it's like the Internet was kind of like born from that.

24:02.980 --> 24:05.380
For me, it was a lot of prodigy back in the day.

24:05.380 --> 24:08.020
I used to post on the bulletin boards and prodigy like all the time.

24:08.020 --> 24:08.900
And yeah, that was.

24:09.780 --> 24:12.420
Yeah, AOL chat rooms are fun.

24:12.420 --> 24:16.340
And like even just with like games and stuff like that, we're able to get stuff.

24:18.660 --> 24:19.940
Yeah, fun times.

24:19.940 --> 24:20.340
All right.

24:20.340 --> 24:24.260
Internet enough reflection from the old folks home on BBS.

24:24.260 --> 24:25.860
Thanks for that derailment chat.

24:26.420 --> 24:27.940
All right.

24:27.940 --> 24:30.580
Let's get into let's get into the new and the now.

24:30.580 --> 24:34.100
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing

24:34.100 --> 24:34.580
this week.

24:34.580 --> 24:36.180
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

24:37.300 --> 24:42.260
Now, again, now that you just put put like food that you're trying to eat, I'm going

24:42.260 --> 24:43.060
to go to Loki then.

24:43.060 --> 24:45.940
Oh, I swallowed quickly.

24:45.940 --> 24:46.440
Okay.

24:47.860 --> 24:48.660
Animal Crossing.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.660
And patterned has new stuff out.

24:52.660 --> 24:53.940
So I've been playing some more patterned.

24:54.500 --> 24:58.340
Um, I have a lot of other stuff going on, so I haven't really, you know, like I said,

24:58.340 --> 24:58.900
played a whole lot.

24:58.900 --> 25:01.860
I'm trying to get through just this month before I start anything new.

25:01.860 --> 25:06.420
But, um, I was going to be setting up the stuff for my stream and not a single person

25:06.420 --> 25:08.420
donated to vote for a game.

25:09.460 --> 25:12.100
So I don't know.

25:12.100 --> 25:12.500
We'll see.

25:13.140 --> 25:14.500
I put the call out.

25:14.500 --> 25:15.380
No one answered.

25:16.180 --> 25:21.540
So well, we might have to poll folks to see if there's something, maybe a different idea

25:21.540 --> 25:22.820
that would get a little more.

25:22.900 --> 25:24.100
Gotta pay for the vote.

25:24.100 --> 25:24.600
Yeah.

25:25.060 --> 25:25.560
All right.

25:26.180 --> 25:29.140
Well, uh, if that's it for Dark Sakura's gaming week, let's go to Loki.

25:29.140 --> 25:30.020
How was your gaming week?

25:30.740 --> 25:31.860
Um, it was all right.

25:31.860 --> 25:34.020
I played mostly Orna.

25:34.020 --> 25:37.540
Um, I did play a bit of Minecraft this week.

25:37.540 --> 25:39.300
I streamed a little bit on.

25:39.300 --> 25:40.420
I saw some of that.

25:40.420 --> 25:40.920
Yeah, yeah.

25:41.540 --> 25:41.860
Yeah.

25:41.860 --> 25:43.460
So I, I tried doing it.

25:43.460 --> 25:44.180
I don't know.

25:44.180 --> 25:48.740
Like I've been getting the itch to do more Minecraft stuff, but like I wanted, I want

25:48.740 --> 25:50.740
to like play with actual people.

25:50.740 --> 25:53.300
Like it's, it's kind of irritating.

25:53.300 --> 25:57.300
I see that like this thing with a bunch of like, not really massive YouTubers, but like

25:57.300 --> 26:03.060
some pretty decent YouTubers, um, decided to do that's the trend nowadays is these,

26:03.060 --> 26:05.460
uh, survival multiplayer servers.

26:05.460 --> 26:13.140
And so like there's dream SMP, which is kind of a dream is a speed runner for, um, Minecraft.

26:13.140 --> 26:15.380
He also does these like manhunt videos and stuff like that.

26:15.380 --> 26:16.900
So it's him and a bunch of friends, Mr.

26:16.900 --> 26:18.180
Beast and stuff like that.

26:18.260 --> 26:21.620
Um, they do their own thing and they kind of have almost like the soap opera thing that

26:21.620 --> 26:22.660
goes on along with it.

26:22.660 --> 26:26.980
So they write their own storyline to go along with that and drama and manufacturer drama

26:26.980 --> 26:27.700
and stuff.

26:27.700 --> 26:32.740
Um, then there's a brand new one called Epic SMP that just started with like Gus Johnson,

26:32.740 --> 26:37.780
a bunch of other, uh, YouTubers as well that are pretty funny kind of on the comedy side

26:37.780 --> 26:38.180
things.

26:38.180 --> 26:39.780
A lot of these guys that I watch.

26:39.780 --> 26:42.660
And so, um, they kind of all started playing.

26:42.660 --> 26:46.340
It was just a bunch of people that like a lot of them haven't really even played Minecraft

26:46.340 --> 26:46.740
before.

26:46.740 --> 26:52.100
And so it's just kind of go, it's a big range of people that have, you know, lots of experience

26:52.100 --> 26:57.060
in Minecraft, some of their primary Minecraft YouTubers and some that just do like comedy

26:57.060 --> 27:00.500
stuff that are just kind of doing it with everybody else.

27:00.500 --> 27:05.460
And so it's just a really cool mix, but it's fun to watch all of them just like work together

27:05.460 --> 27:08.260
and like do something like, man, I want to do that kind of stuff.

27:08.260 --> 27:13.220
But like, I can't find like a group of people cause like in order to do something like that,

27:13.220 --> 27:17.380
you want to have a group of streamers that would actually want to like broadcast on a

27:17.380 --> 27:22.100
regular basis and be able to get people that would play on a regular basis to kind of work

27:22.100 --> 27:23.380
together on something.

27:23.380 --> 27:28.660
Um, I do watch a lot of, you know, YouTube stuff, especially like, uh, Hermitcraft is

27:28.660 --> 27:32.340
another one or truly bedrock on the bedrock side of Minecraft.

27:32.340 --> 27:37.540
Um, they do these kind of like, you know, streams where they're not necessarily griefing

27:37.540 --> 27:41.540
each other, which is kind of one big community that they work towards different things.

27:41.620 --> 27:46.500
Hermitcraft, they have like this whole commerce system that they sell and buy stuff and they

27:46.500 --> 27:48.340
do little activities and fun, like stuff like that.

27:48.340 --> 27:49.700
So that would be fun.

27:49.700 --> 27:51.220
I would love to do that.

27:51.220 --> 27:56.260
Um, but, uh, the best, the closest I can get to that is I have a server where my kids demand

27:56.260 --> 27:58.660
that I go build things for them.

27:58.660 --> 28:03.060
And I end up, you know, having to do all the work and that's it.

28:03.060 --> 28:05.380
And there's no sort of teamwork or anything.

28:05.380 --> 28:08.420
It's just kids complaining about not having stuff.

28:08.420 --> 28:13.460
So that's what I was streaming as I was showing off, like, uh, the realm that we've worked

28:13.460 --> 28:17.620
on for the last 10 months and just all the different things that built in that.

28:17.620 --> 28:22.260
So I just kind of wandered around for a good hour and a half, kind of showing all the builds

28:22.260 --> 28:24.740
off that we've done, uh, or most of the bills.

28:24.740 --> 28:28.500
There are some that are kind of far away that I didn't want to walk to, but, uh, it was

28:28.500 --> 28:33.060
fun for a while, but like after a while, I just kind of, I don't know, it would be a

28:33.060 --> 28:37.300
lot better if there was other people playing at the same time, I think, but I don't know.

28:37.460 --> 28:43.140
It's, and even I know when we try to do like the VOG Minecraft stuff, it's hard because

28:43.140 --> 28:46.900
there's, it's not everybody's playing at the same time.

28:46.900 --> 28:50.420
You need to have people that are really like dedicated to playing at the same time, I guess,

28:50.420 --> 28:54.740
or just coordinate schedules is hard too with, you know, adults.

28:54.740 --> 28:59.700
Um, so I don't know how we would do that, but like it would be, it wouldn't be nice to

28:59.700 --> 29:00.100
build that.

29:00.100 --> 29:03.700
So I'm just going to try to find maybe some folks to start something like that.

29:03.700 --> 29:04.340
Cause it'd be fun.

29:04.900 --> 29:08.020
But in the meantime, I have this, the realm I've been playing for a while.

29:08.020 --> 29:10.900
So I was showing that off and all the bills that we have in there.

29:10.900 --> 29:11.860
So it was pretty cool.

29:11.860 --> 29:12.360
Nice.

29:12.900 --> 29:13.140
All right.

29:13.140 --> 29:13.300
Yeah.

29:13.300 --> 29:14.500
I caught a little bit of that stream.

29:14.500 --> 29:15.940
It was a guy I was lurking.

29:15.940 --> 29:18.100
I, sometimes I do it from my, um, Xbox.

29:18.100 --> 29:21.860
So it's a little bit of a pain in the ass to chat, but I, I lurk.

29:21.860 --> 29:22.820
So it's cool.

29:22.820 --> 29:26.100
I caught a little bit of it, um, my gaming week.

29:26.100 --> 29:30.820
So, uh, speaking of streaming, I did a couple of final fantasy 14 streams in the past week.

29:31.220 --> 29:36.900
Myself and, uh, my friends, Shane and Ray, we were doing some streaming of just like

29:36.900 --> 29:40.660
maps is a big thing we're into in the game right now is that you do these treasure maps

29:40.660 --> 29:44.660
and once in a while, like one out of every four or something, we'll do a portal that

29:44.660 --> 29:46.500
takes you to this big roulette wheel.

29:46.500 --> 29:49.780
And it's almost like you're playing a game show, but you're doing fights on the game.

29:49.780 --> 29:52.180
It's like smash TV, but in final fantasy.

29:52.180 --> 29:56.180
Um, so those have been kind of fun just to stream because, you know, I'm sure the viewers

29:56.180 --> 30:00.100
love to see when we get zonked out or, you know, we think we get zonked out and then

30:00.100 --> 30:04.820
the lightning bolt, uh, crashes and we get another spin, just silly things like that.

30:04.820 --> 30:07.140
So been having fun playing final fantasy 14.

30:07.140 --> 30:11.700
Um, and, uh, we'll try to do some more streams cause that's been a good way to kind of motivate

30:11.700 --> 30:16.420
myself to do some streaming on my personal channel over at Rob Roberts here on Twitch.

30:16.420 --> 30:18.260
Um, but that's not all I've been playing.

30:18.260 --> 30:19.700
I've been playing some other games too.

30:19.700 --> 30:25.060
Um, over on Xbox, I played a little more Tetris effect just because I hadn't cleared

30:25.060 --> 30:27.060
journey mode on Xbox yet.

30:27.060 --> 30:31.220
Um, I played a little bit of the multiplayer previously, but I hadn't really played any

30:31.220 --> 30:31.940
of the single player.

30:31.940 --> 30:35.380
So I kind of, you know, I just went through in the night and knocked all that out, got

30:35.380 --> 30:40.100
some achievements, uh, from playing that front to back and doing all that.

30:40.100 --> 30:45.220
Um, if anybody actually does the Microsoft reward points, uh, they have a thing going

30:45.220 --> 30:49.460
on right now where like up to 10,000 gamers scored that you are in this month turns into

30:49.460 --> 30:50.340
points.

30:50.340 --> 30:53.380
And I like being very recursive with the points.

30:53.380 --> 30:57.060
Cause if you get like 6,000 points, you can get like a $5 Xbox card.

30:57.060 --> 31:01.300
So that's just like five bucks towards your next game or let them stack up and that whole

31:01.300 --> 31:01.540
thing.

31:01.540 --> 31:04.260
So that's kind of, that's, that's fun.

31:04.260 --> 31:08.820
Um, and also on Xbox torchlight three hit game pass.

31:08.820 --> 31:11.140
So I played that just a little bit.

31:11.140 --> 31:15.460
Um, still trying to kind of wrap my head around it because there's a lot that going on in

31:15.460 --> 31:18.260
that game and the tutorial isn't very great.

31:18.260 --> 31:23.060
Um, I'm not sure I'm as into it as I was torchlight two, but I'm going to try to give it a little

31:23.060 --> 31:25.380
more time and see if it's something that grows on me a little bit.

31:25.380 --> 31:29.700
And I've heard kind of in general that not as many people were as big on torchlight three,

31:29.700 --> 31:33.380
um, because I guess it felt a little bit more like it was supposed to be a phone or a spinoff

31:33.380 --> 31:33.540
thing.

31:33.540 --> 31:37.620
And they kind of kind of back ended it into being an official torchlight three.

31:37.620 --> 31:41.300
And I can kind of see that, but I want to be fair and give it a little more time just

31:41.300 --> 31:41.700
to see.

31:42.340 --> 31:47.700
Um, and then otherwise I've been playing a lot of Pokemon shield still working on my

31:47.700 --> 31:48.420
pokey decks.

31:48.420 --> 31:51.780
I'm almost so, uh, not counting the DLC.

31:51.780 --> 31:56.100
I refuse to let myself get the DLC until I finish my pokey decks in the main game.

31:56.100 --> 31:57.300
And I'm getting really close.

31:57.300 --> 31:59.140
You guys I'm under 20 now.

31:59.140 --> 32:01.460
I think last count I was at 17.

32:01.460 --> 32:03.620
Um, I put a call out on Twitter earlier.

32:03.620 --> 32:06.900
I was like, help, I need a Galarian Darumaka.

32:06.900 --> 32:13.140
I can't get one on home because on home you can't specify that you want a Galarian Darumaka.

32:13.140 --> 32:16.900
So every time I would put up like Galarian Corsola, which kind of like the equivalent

32:16.900 --> 32:22.180
in shield, I would get fucking regular Darumakas that somebody caught in Pokemon Go.

32:22.180 --> 32:23.380
I'm like, I don't want these.

32:23.380 --> 32:26.340
I want a Galarian one and I wasn't getting them.

32:26.340 --> 32:31.060
But finally, so I went on Twitter and I ugly begged and thankfully it worked.

32:31.060 --> 32:32.820
Somebody was like, yep, I'm ready.

32:32.820 --> 32:33.620
Here's the code.

32:33.620 --> 32:34.980
It was like, perfect.

32:34.980 --> 32:36.580
So I got what I needed there.

32:36.580 --> 32:39.620
So, um, yeah, so I'm down to like only 17.

32:39.620 --> 32:43.940
Um, I still have some, the other one that's going to be really hard to get is the, um,

32:43.940 --> 32:44.820
there's an apple.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.300
There's an there's Applin.

32:47.300 --> 32:53.460
And then that evolves into one type with a shield item and one type with a sword item.

32:53.460 --> 32:56.260
And I can't find any more of the berries.

32:56.260 --> 32:59.620
I had one to make the app, whatever the evolved one is.

33:00.500 --> 33:05.220
I cannot find another stupid berry or apple or whatever it is to evolve.

33:05.940 --> 33:10.260
Even just get a second one of those to trade somebody for the shield or for the sword

33:10.260 --> 33:10.980
equivalent.

33:10.980 --> 33:12.580
Yeah, it's such a pain in the ass.

33:12.660 --> 33:14.820
So thank you, Appleton and Flapple.

33:14.820 --> 33:18.340
I can never, so I have Appleton, I think I need Flapple.

33:18.340 --> 33:19.780
So I'll figure it out.

33:19.780 --> 33:22.100
Um, I just have to find another one of those berries.

33:22.100 --> 33:25.460
Somebody said you got to check near the trees and sometimes you'll see a sparkling.

33:26.980 --> 33:28.260
Do they still make Snapple?

33:28.820 --> 33:29.540
I think they do.

33:29.540 --> 33:30.820
I think they do as well.

33:30.820 --> 33:32.500
I just, I miss the Snapple lady.

33:32.500 --> 33:33.300
Remember those commercials?

33:33.300 --> 33:34.260
I miss fruitopia.

33:34.260 --> 33:35.620
Hi from Snapple.

33:35.620 --> 33:36.020
All right.

33:36.020 --> 33:38.820
Anyway, uh, she Hulk says, what is Pokemon?

33:39.140 --> 33:42.580
Uh, it's, it's a addicting little game, especially during quarantine.

33:42.580 --> 33:43.700
That's for sure.

33:43.700 --> 33:45.860
So, um, let's see.

33:45.860 --> 33:48.340
Act Def says Appleton is the fat one.

33:48.340 --> 33:49.620
Flapple is the skinny one.

33:49.620 --> 33:50.980
Now that's not very nice.

33:50.980 --> 33:53.620
That's not a very nice way to say it.

33:53.620 --> 33:55.300
Um, let's see.

33:55.300 --> 33:58.100
Bobby Blackwell says, this is why I stopped playing Pokemon sword.

33:58.100 --> 34:03.700
Once the credits rolled, I did two a year ago and then quarantine happened.

34:03.700 --> 34:05.140
And you know what happened guys?

34:05.140 --> 34:06.260
I got really bored.

34:06.260 --> 34:12.820
So I was like, I, I, I'm going to catch, I got bored and bought equipment.

34:14.660 --> 34:15.780
I got bored and bought stuff.

34:16.340 --> 34:18.580
I got bored and I said, you know what?

34:18.580 --> 34:21.140
Today, I'm going to catch them all.

34:21.140 --> 34:21.700
Oh yes.

34:22.420 --> 34:26.260
I'm going to catch them all and I'm still working on it.

34:26.260 --> 34:29.460
So well, better catch Pokemon than, you know, the plague.

34:29.460 --> 34:30.900
That's, that's very true.

34:30.900 --> 34:31.540
Very, very true.

34:32.100 --> 34:32.500
All right.

34:33.380 --> 34:33.940
Anyway.

34:33.940 --> 34:35.700
Um, so that's it for my gaming week.

34:36.100 --> 34:37.060
Lots of Pokemans.

34:37.060 --> 34:38.580
A Pokemon go as well.

34:38.580 --> 34:40.340
I have been playing that too.

34:40.340 --> 34:42.580
Um, a chop community day was Saturday.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.100
I kind of half-assed it.

34:44.100 --> 34:45.620
I got seven shinies.

34:45.620 --> 34:46.740
That's plenty.

34:46.740 --> 34:48.260
I don't need more than that.

34:48.260 --> 34:54.420
Um, and then I forgot to evolve to get the special move, which I'm really annoyed about.

34:54.420 --> 34:57.620
I think I got one that has the special move and I'm really annoyed.

34:57.620 --> 34:58.580
I forgot to do the others.

34:58.580 --> 35:00.580
Oh my, I know fail on all accounts, right?

35:00.580 --> 35:02.340
No pixel Pacas.

35:02.340 --> 35:04.660
I got bored and made a passion's discord server.

35:05.460 --> 35:09.300
Like the soap opera, my favorite soap opera of all time passions.

35:10.500 --> 35:11.540
Oh my God.

35:11.540 --> 35:16.260
I just said FFS passions because for fuck's sake, really?

35:17.620 --> 35:18.820
That's kind of funny.

35:18.820 --> 35:19.460
Oh my God.

35:19.460 --> 35:21.140
It really is the soap opera.

35:21.140 --> 35:22.340
I'm going to join.

35:22.340 --> 35:24.420
I love that with Tabitha and Timmy.

35:27.940 --> 35:29.060
You don't even know.

35:29.060 --> 35:33.620
We used to get together in college and drink and watch, uh, passions that was taped earlier

35:33.620 --> 35:34.100
in the day.

35:34.660 --> 35:35.300
Good times.

35:35.940 --> 35:37.620
You know what we used to do in college?

35:37.620 --> 35:38.180
What?

35:38.180 --> 35:40.100
Play the jumping flash demo on repeat.

35:41.380 --> 35:46.980
We played a lot of Mario Kart, but the other thing was taking all of the anime that my

35:46.980 --> 35:50.980
friends had like third generation, you know, like taped off of TV and whatnot stuff.

35:51.540 --> 35:53.540
And then, uh, make up our own dialogue.

35:55.060 --> 35:59.380
As Joe and Hunter Matt and chat says, can you use elite TM to get payback yet?

35:59.380 --> 36:01.940
I think so, but I'm not going to burn an elite TM on that.

36:01.940 --> 36:04.100
I don't even think that's one of the more useful moves.

36:04.100 --> 36:04.420
Is it?

36:04.420 --> 36:08.660
I feel like there's other Mon with other useful moves that you really want to TM into.

36:08.660 --> 36:10.340
So anyway.

36:11.140 --> 36:11.540
All right.

36:11.540 --> 36:12.260
I got one.

36:12.260 --> 36:13.620
That's probably plenty.

36:13.620 --> 36:14.980
Uh, let's move on.

36:14.980 --> 36:15.300
That's it.

36:15.300 --> 36:16.820
That's enough Pokemon chat.

36:16.820 --> 36:19.300
Let's get into some other gaming news here.

36:19.300 --> 36:20.980
Cause there was some stuff that went on this week.

36:20.980 --> 36:23.860
We're starting to get back into the regular cycle of news again.

36:23.860 --> 36:27.780
Um, and there's a, especially with consumer electronics show this week, although there

36:27.780 --> 36:31.220
wasn't a lot of gaming news out of CES, but there was a little bit.

36:31.220 --> 36:33.220
Um, but there was news on all sorts of fronts.

36:33.220 --> 36:33.540
Right.

36:33.540 --> 36:36.820
And including one story that won't go away.

36:36.820 --> 36:37.140
Right.

36:37.140 --> 36:37.540
Loki.

36:39.300 --> 36:41.060
Uh, that is correct.

36:41.060 --> 36:41.460
Yeah.

36:41.460 --> 36:51.140
So, um, CG CD project red, um, they put out an apology video, uh, talking about their

36:51.140 --> 36:56.740
commitment to quality and which, uh, the co-founder, uh, Marcin.

36:57.620 --> 37:04.580
The wind ski apologize for the state of a cyberpunk 2077, basically said that not to

37:04.580 --> 37:09.780
blame the dev teams, that it was up to the board to decide when to release that game.

37:10.340 --> 37:17.940
Um, also that they were having issues with performance on the, uh, older consoles because

37:17.940 --> 37:23.780
of the streaming service or the asset streaming that they were putting into the game.

37:23.780 --> 37:30.100
Cause it's so condensed into a small area that, um, they have to keep rewriting that

37:30.820 --> 37:33.700
basically said that they put out a roadmap.

37:33.700 --> 37:37.220
Um, like, I mean, I swear to God, it's like, we talk about this all the time with different

37:37.220 --> 37:40.260
games and these roadmaps, like our game socks, right?

37:40.260 --> 37:44.020
Well, it's not sucks, but our game is less than ideal right now.

37:44.020 --> 37:47.940
So now we're going to put out a roadmap and when it's going to be done.

37:47.940 --> 37:52.020
So there's a big patches expected out soon.

37:52.100 --> 37:54.500
I think it actually already came out 1.06.

37:54.500 --> 37:57.140
Um, and actually that just came out the hot fix for that.

37:57.140 --> 38:00.740
And then there should be a more substantial patch in like 10 days or so.

38:00.740 --> 38:03.540
And then another one following that as well.

38:03.540 --> 38:06.420
Um, they're going to be putting out the free DLCs.

38:06.420 --> 38:10.260
There's going to be the next gen consulate date, which was supposed to be coming out.

38:10.260 --> 38:13.140
Now it was originally set for March.

38:13.140 --> 38:13.940
That ain't happening.

38:13.940 --> 38:16.260
That's now coming out the second half of the year.

38:17.700 --> 38:21.300
And yeah, so everything pushed back.

38:21.300 --> 38:25.380
They also said that they're not going to be having their teams crunch,

38:25.380 --> 38:29.380
or they're going to be avoiding crunch on all future product or projects.

38:29.380 --> 38:31.220
He said is one of their priorities.

38:31.220 --> 38:31.460
Okay.

38:31.460 --> 38:32.500
But they said that before.

38:33.940 --> 38:34.180
Yeah.

38:34.180 --> 38:34.660
I'm I'm.

38:35.700 --> 38:38.500
He apologized, but did he resign though?

38:38.500 --> 38:41.780
Did he talk about his personal accountability though?

38:41.780 --> 38:43.860
Did he talk about, see that's.

38:45.380 --> 38:46.020
I don't know.

38:46.020 --> 38:47.620
That's where it kind of starts to lose me.

38:48.180 --> 38:48.660
Yeah.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.340
It's it's no, he did not.

38:50.340 --> 38:53.220
And it, it felt kind of hollow.

38:53.220 --> 38:56.900
Like there was stuff, you know, where they like, oh, we thought it was in good shape.

38:56.900 --> 38:58.340
You know, it was in pretty good shape.

38:59.220 --> 39:00.180
No, you didn't.

39:00.180 --> 39:01.140
You know, better.

39:01.140 --> 39:04.900
You could, there's no way, you know, cause they, I think they mentioned something about

39:04.900 --> 39:09.300
like in our testing, you know, it, everything seemed to be going well, but like there was

39:09.300 --> 39:12.260
stuff that was happening that you guys are experiencing outside our testing.

39:12.260 --> 39:16.340
It's like, dude, like there's, it's just normal gameplay.

39:16.340 --> 39:20.100
Like there's stuff clearly broken.

39:20.100 --> 39:22.420
Stuff that's clearly been pieced together.

39:23.700 --> 39:27.620
You know, uh, they were talking about like the police system in the game and how there

39:27.620 --> 39:31.780
was going to be some police that were corrupt that you could bribe.

39:31.780 --> 39:36.260
Or, you know, if you got your wanted level too high, there would be, you know, assassins

39:36.260 --> 39:37.700
that would come after you and stuff like that.

39:38.580 --> 39:40.180
That is not what's in the game right now.

39:40.180 --> 39:45.220
It is basically you cause a crime and the police teleport to you somehow.

39:45.220 --> 39:47.300
They will literally spawn in right behind you.

39:47.300 --> 39:50.020
Even if you're locked yourself into a closet or something.

39:51.220 --> 39:53.140
It is just ridiculous.

39:53.140 --> 39:58.260
Like just how, uh, rushed everything seems to be.

39:58.260 --> 40:01.940
So like, I don't really buy half of what he's saying.

40:01.940 --> 40:04.820
And honestly, like, show me the receipts.

40:04.820 --> 40:07.540
I want to see these patches and see what it does to the game.

40:07.540 --> 40:09.380
Cause I don't believe you right now.

40:09.380 --> 40:11.220
Show me the receipts, retire bitch.

40:11.220 --> 40:13.380
Cause that's the only way anything's going to change.

40:13.380 --> 40:15.220
Like, sorry, but not sorry.

40:15.220 --> 40:18.100
But Bobby says in chat from now on, we won't have crunch.

40:18.100 --> 40:18.420
Okay.

40:18.420 --> 40:20.820
For real this time from now on, we won't have crunch.

40:20.820 --> 40:21.220
Okay.

40:21.220 --> 40:22.340
Third time's the charm.

40:22.340 --> 40:24.660
Now, from now on, we won't have crunch.

40:24.660 --> 40:28.980
I'm not buying what you're selling retire bitch.

40:28.980 --> 40:31.380
Because that's the only way anything's really going to change.

40:33.540 --> 40:33.860
Yeah.

40:33.860 --> 40:37.220
It's I don't anticipate any sort of changes.

40:37.220 --> 40:38.500
They did, they got caught.

40:38.500 --> 40:41.940
They needed, they felt like that they needed to apologize to save face.

40:43.300 --> 40:44.580
But I mean, come on.

40:44.580 --> 40:51.060
It's just, this is the same stuff that we get from EA and, you know, oh, well, I'm sorry

40:51.060 --> 40:54.260
that the quality of our game, here's the roadmap of how we're laying it out.

40:54.260 --> 40:56.980
Oh, Hey, look, it's Bethesda talking about Fallout 76.

40:56.980 --> 40:59.140
Here's the roadmap on how we're fixing it.

40:59.140 --> 41:04.900
Like, come on you guys, you got to stop doing this, but they're not going to, because

41:04.900 --> 41:11.780
people still buy their games and there's no, there's literally no sort of, um, punishment

41:11.780 --> 41:12.260
for them.

41:12.260 --> 41:14.900
I mean, they, there's no consequences for them to do this.

41:14.900 --> 41:18.500
And that's why you're going to keep seeing them do this because people will keep supporting

41:18.500 --> 41:19.000
them.

41:19.860 --> 41:21.140
Some comments from chat.

41:21.140 --> 41:24.900
Fifth Dream in chat says it's not CD Projekt Red if the guy who runs it resigns.

41:25.780 --> 41:30.260
Mojang would like to have a word, a company that is in a far better position, thanks to

41:30.260 --> 41:32.020
those sorts of changes, that's for sure.

41:33.060 --> 41:37.540
Zen Monkey says be happy with the devil you have now because the next one could be a lot

41:37.540 --> 41:38.260
worse.

41:38.260 --> 41:39.540
I'm not sure.

41:39.540 --> 41:42.740
I mean, I understand that saying and why it's out there.

41:42.740 --> 41:46.820
I'm not sure I would apply it in this scenario.

41:46.820 --> 41:52.900
Like I, again, and I said this early on when this all started happening, the only way that

41:52.900 --> 41:57.860
things are going to change is with new leadership and that, and I stand by what I said four

41:57.860 --> 42:03.060
weeks ago or whenever this stuff first started breaking is that one of these co-leaders is

42:03.060 --> 42:05.140
going down because of this.

42:05.140 --> 42:08.340
And we'll see, it's just, we're just, we're seeing everything play out.

42:08.340 --> 42:12.660
It's all, it's all the motions because, because he, did he not try to blame the board in this

42:12.660 --> 42:13.860
what he said, right?

42:13.860 --> 42:16.020
You think the board's going to have that?

42:16.020 --> 42:17.940
Well, he was, he's part of the board.

42:17.940 --> 42:21.380
So what he is basically trying to do, it wasn't that he was blaming somebody else.

42:21.380 --> 42:27.140
He was basically trying to shift blame from the actual developers saying you shouldn't,

42:27.140 --> 42:31.940
because people are sending death threats to these people because they're dumb and it's

42:31.940 --> 42:32.820
the internet.

42:32.820 --> 42:37.780
So they were basically saying, you know, listen, don't come after the developers.

42:37.780 --> 42:40.580
It's not, they're doing the game is in this situation.

42:40.580 --> 42:44.580
You know, we decided the shift as the board is the one that makes that final decision.

42:44.580 --> 42:44.820
Right.

42:44.820 --> 42:50.020
And you can, don't ever bully developers and people that work at the company.

42:50.020 --> 42:51.700
That's just a stupid thing in general.

42:51.700 --> 42:57.060
So I will, I will say that like, yes, that is the, and that is a message that needs to

42:57.060 --> 43:01.460
be out there, unfortunately, because people don't know how to conduct themselves online.

43:01.460 --> 43:06.020
So that part, certainly I have no problem with that statement, except the fact that

43:06.020 --> 43:07.140
it has to be said at all.

43:07.140 --> 43:07.780
That's for sure.

43:08.340 --> 43:14.580
So, Bobby Blackall says, Cyberpunk 2077 is a failure of management, not a failure of

43:14.580 --> 43:15.860
developers or QA.

43:15.860 --> 43:17.220
100% agree.

43:17.220 --> 43:21.380
And again, there's many people that would say it's not a failure at all, depending on

43:21.380 --> 43:25.060
what platform you're playing it on or, you know, just how your luck has been with what

43:25.060 --> 43:26.420
you've run into in game or not.

43:27.140 --> 43:32.900
And that's, that's part of the interesting kind of layers of this whole story is that

43:32.900 --> 43:35.780
it's not bad for everybody, just some people.

43:35.780 --> 43:37.780
So anyway, all right.

43:39.220 --> 43:42.420
But Loki, you're still, you're still playing the game and for the most part liking it,

43:42.420 --> 43:42.820
right?

43:42.820 --> 43:45.380
I haven't, I haven't played it in a while.

43:45.380 --> 43:46.420
I did like it.

43:46.420 --> 43:48.740
I mean, I thought the story was okay.

43:48.740 --> 43:52.580
I'm okay with some of the bugs right now, as long as it doesn't break the game completely

43:52.580 --> 43:53.380
for me.

43:53.460 --> 43:54.980
So far, I haven't really ran into the thing.

43:54.980 --> 43:56.820
The police thing is kind of stupid.

43:56.820 --> 43:58.500
Like I don't really fight.

43:58.500 --> 44:02.580
I don't really cause any crimes in the game, but like if I wanted to kind of have like

44:02.580 --> 44:07.700
a, you know, spree or something like that, I don't think it's really fair the way that

44:07.700 --> 44:08.500
the system works.

44:08.500 --> 44:10.340
I mean, literally they spawn in anywhere.

44:10.340 --> 44:11.620
Like you can watch videos online.

44:11.620 --> 44:17.060
They show, you know, examples of that where you'll be up on top of like a little, you

44:17.060 --> 44:22.180
know, ledge, like, you know, way up on a building and you shoot somebody, you look around, there's

44:22.180 --> 44:23.060
no one there.

44:23.060 --> 44:25.860
All of a sudden, boom, there's like literally a cop right behind you.

44:25.860 --> 44:27.940
It's like, how did you get up here?

44:27.940 --> 44:29.780
How did you teleport behind me?

44:30.580 --> 44:31.700
It's just silly.

44:32.500 --> 44:33.940
All right, let's move on.

44:33.940 --> 44:37.940
Let's talk about a brand new Nintendo Switch that was announced this week.

44:37.940 --> 44:41.940
Sorry, it's not the Switch Pro that all the gaming media is trying to get you hyped for,

44:41.940 --> 44:45.780
but it's just a, it's a new skin for the classic Nintendo Switch.

44:45.780 --> 44:48.340
Although I will say this is a very good looking system.

44:48.340 --> 44:55.300
It is a Mario themed Nintendo Switch, and it's aptly timed with Super Mario 3D World

44:55.300 --> 44:56.580
plus Bowser's Fury.

44:57.140 --> 45:02.660
This new Switch will be out on February 12th to kind of be in tandem with that for those

45:02.660 --> 45:07.060
that may finally break down and get a Switch because that's the game that's releasing or

45:07.060 --> 45:09.380
those that are spending their stimulus money on a Switch.

45:09.380 --> 45:10.820
I don't know, your money, your business.

45:12.020 --> 45:16.820
But it is a nice, it's a red and blue edition, so it's themed like Mario colors.

45:16.820 --> 45:18.020
Sorry, Luigi fans.

45:18.900 --> 45:20.180
That would get me excited.

45:20.180 --> 45:22.820
How about a green and white one for Luigi suspenders?

45:22.820 --> 45:26.980
But whatever we have or one that you dip it in water and it changes colors.

45:28.100 --> 45:30.020
Don't, please don't dip your Switch into water.

45:30.020 --> 45:31.540
Please do not dip your Switch into water.

45:31.540 --> 45:32.500
That was a dumb joke.

45:32.500 --> 45:33.060
All right.

45:33.060 --> 45:38.260
Anyway, we'll just spread that rumor online and lots of people will break the Switches.

45:38.260 --> 45:38.820
Hehe.

45:38.820 --> 45:40.100
We'll make a video.

45:40.100 --> 45:40.600
All right.

45:41.700 --> 45:43.220
But it's a red and blue system.

45:43.300 --> 45:45.060
So it's like the dock's red.

45:45.060 --> 45:48.660
The little dog ear thing that you put your controllers in is blue.

45:48.660 --> 45:51.140
The Joy-Cons are red and blue.

45:51.140 --> 45:54.420
There's a carrying case that's red and blue with yellow zippers.

45:54.420 --> 45:56.340
It is very like Mario inspired.

45:56.340 --> 45:58.260
It's supposed to kind of look like Mario suspenders.

45:58.980 --> 46:02.420
It's going to cost you the $300 that a Nintendo Switch would cost.

46:03.060 --> 46:04.980
I think it looks really cool though.

46:04.980 --> 46:11.140
Like, and I can't justify spending $300 just to get a Switch in another color.

46:11.140 --> 46:14.740
But if I didn't have a Switch, I'd be all about wanting to get this one.

46:14.740 --> 46:15.460
That's for sure.

46:16.100 --> 46:18.580
Speaking of Mario 3D World and Bowser's Fury.

46:18.580 --> 46:21.700
And we were just talking a little bit about this a couple weeks ago on the show.

46:21.700 --> 46:24.900
Whatever happened to like amiibos being used in games?

46:24.900 --> 46:29.140
Well, apparently Mario 3D World and Bowser's Fury will have some amiibo support.

46:30.180 --> 46:31.780
So what's going to happen?

46:32.340 --> 46:38.820
Bowser and Bowser Jr., their amiibo figures will be returning to retailers and they have

46:38.900 --> 46:40.260
some specific activation.

46:40.260 --> 46:41.940
But we don't know exactly what it is.

46:41.940 --> 46:46.260
And then there are some cat amiibo that will also have some features.

46:46.260 --> 46:49.940
So it sounds like, you know, we're getting some reprints out of this and there will be

46:49.940 --> 46:53.940
some sort of, I bet it will probably give you items in the game or something like that.

46:53.940 --> 46:55.460
Are the cat ones new?

46:56.340 --> 46:58.100
There are some new cat ones coming.

46:58.100 --> 46:58.580
Okay.

46:58.580 --> 46:58.740
Yeah.

46:59.460 --> 47:04.500
So, or they'll unlock some new costumes kind of like Mario Odyssey or something like that.

47:04.500 --> 47:05.000
Who knows?

47:05.880 --> 47:13.240
So Zen Monkey in chat says Nintendo should take a risk and kill off Mario.

47:15.000 --> 47:23.480
Can you imagine, can you imagine Mario murder party where like one of, one of these great

47:23.480 --> 47:28.120
mascots will be killed off by Nintendo, never to be seen again.

47:29.320 --> 47:30.440
Sorry Waluigi.

47:31.240 --> 47:36.280
They tease that several times in the smash videos.

47:36.280 --> 47:38.200
Remember like Sephiroth.

47:38.200 --> 47:39.640
Sephiroth thing was so good.

47:39.640 --> 47:40.140
Yeah.

47:40.760 --> 47:47.640
And then, I know there was another one too, where like his soul got knocked out of his

47:47.640 --> 47:48.920
body or something like that.

47:48.920 --> 47:53.640
I want to say there was some, I think it was a smash video where that happened.

47:53.640 --> 47:55.880
I don't remember which character was though.

47:55.880 --> 47:57.160
Ridley says chat.

47:57.800 --> 47:58.300
Oh yeah.

47:59.100 --> 48:04.140
Um, Sia Tabiri says Mario is missing, but with blood dripping from the letters.

48:05.740 --> 48:07.500
Mario is missing permanently.

48:09.820 --> 48:11.020
You guys are sick.

48:11.020 --> 48:11.520
I love it.

48:13.100 --> 48:14.540
You guys have problems.

48:14.540 --> 48:15.040
All right.

48:16.860 --> 48:21.660
Sia Tabiri says I legitimately still want to murder mystery party in Animal Crossing.

48:21.660 --> 48:26.700
Well, like it, and you know, to keep it legit, it doesn't have to be like actual murder,

48:26.700 --> 48:31.580
but I think it would be fun to have costume parties that are like that in Animal Crossing.

48:31.580 --> 48:32.780
I think that's cool.

48:32.780 --> 48:34.460
So, all right.

48:34.460 --> 48:35.980
Anyhow, let's move on.

48:37.020 --> 48:39.180
Let's talk about a different system than Nintendo.

48:39.180 --> 48:40.380
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

48:42.940 --> 48:45.980
Uh, I have something about the PS5.

48:46.700 --> 48:51.260
So, um, you know, people are always looking for the patents that come out regarding any

48:51.260 --> 48:54.780
of these systems to try to get an idea of what could be happening.

48:54.780 --> 49:00.540
And there has been a patent filed that looks like there's going to be something to,

49:01.500 --> 49:04.220
as an add in, something to add to the experience.

49:04.940 --> 49:09.100
So, um, this particular patent that's come to light,

49:09.740 --> 49:14.300
it looks like a PlayStation VR headset that includes haptic feedback.

49:15.020 --> 49:17.740
There's no dates or anything, of course, with that,

49:17.740 --> 49:22.620
but it looks like one of those ones that could just immediately be implemented.

49:23.260 --> 49:28.860
Um, another one allows players to leave text and audio notes in games for other users.

49:29.580 --> 49:34.300
So, like, if you like, say, walk up on like a trouble point,

49:34.300 --> 49:36.620
then you might get a tip there if you look for it.

49:37.260 --> 49:40.060
You know, that sounds like a Dark Souls thing in every game.

49:40.860 --> 49:42.940
I was actually saying more like Super Mario Maker.

49:43.740 --> 49:44.620
Oh, yeah, that too.

49:44.620 --> 49:45.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:46.140 --> 49:46.640
Yeah.

49:47.280 --> 49:53.680
Um, and, uh, but basically it's there for user generated game advice.

49:54.240 --> 49:58.720
Um, has, and they also specify that it will live quote within

49:58.720 --> 50:02.000
a game space using a virtual coordinate system and quote.

50:02.800 --> 50:05.520
So, um, it could be interesting.

50:06.480 --> 50:09.680
I kind of love that idea as long as I can limit it to my friends.

50:10.480 --> 50:14.000
But I don't want to see stranger danger notes because I'll just see

50:14.000 --> 50:16.080
dicks everywhere in every game I play.

50:16.080 --> 50:21.200
But if I, if I limit it to friends, I'll only see the dicks that Loki drew and put in games.

50:21.200 --> 50:25.040
It would, it would be, it sounds like it would be just like Dark Souls almost, but like.

50:25.040 --> 50:27.040
Or Mario Maker is a good comparison.

50:27.040 --> 50:28.320
If you died here, you suck.

50:30.240 --> 50:31.920
I'd only leave that note for you, Jamie.

50:34.320 --> 50:38.320
Yeah, the thing is, though, is that I wouldn't, uh, look for any notes.

50:39.760 --> 50:41.840
Joke's on you, Rob. I disabled all your notes.

50:42.720 --> 50:44.000
Exactly, exactly.

50:44.320 --> 50:49.040
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says, if you died, if you died here, you're Bobby Black Wolf.

50:49.040 --> 50:52.720
Yep. No, I just leave little notes in every game.

50:52.720 --> 50:58.560
Rob Roberts was here, but you know, the best way not to lose Rob when don't play.

51:01.440 --> 51:04.400
Uh, but seriously, sometimes I'm kidding.

51:04.400 --> 51:06.560
Seriously, that patent sounds really neat.

51:06.560 --> 51:11.520
I'd I'd actually love to see something like that in the, um, uh, ecosystem for PlayStation.

51:12.000 --> 51:17.360
And it makes sense too, because they have the whole like hitting the button to see the,

51:17.360 --> 51:22.640
the YouTube or whatever Sony proprietary video to see how to get certain achievements.

51:22.640 --> 51:25.680
Like that is a thing that's already kind of baked in the PlayStation five.

51:25.680 --> 51:29.840
So like user generated content of that sort makes a lot of sense.

51:29.840 --> 51:34.480
Again, I worry about what happens if everybody and everyone can do that,

51:34.480 --> 51:38.080
but if you can follow certain trusted people or your friends or something like that,

51:38.080 --> 51:40.160
I think it could be really cool to be honest.

51:40.160 --> 51:46.800
To be honest, I think that's a neat feature for the, uh, console and, uh, yeah, I look forward to

51:46.800 --> 51:54.880
it. All right. Well, let's move on Loki. All right. So, you know, it's hard to believe that

51:54.880 --> 52:01.200
even though we're still in the middle of COVID, they were talking about, um, these brand new

52:01.200 --> 52:06.240
tournament leagues that are coming up soon. So starting off with, um, Overwatch, uh,

52:06.320 --> 52:10.880
Overwatch league, they've announced their 2021 season. It sounds like it's going to be kind of

52:10.880 --> 52:17.440
similar to what they've been doing already with, um, you know, taking considerations for COVID and

52:17.440 --> 52:22.000
stuff. So for example, instead of actually traveling to these different parts of the

52:22.000 --> 52:27.600
country, everybody's going to be kind of hunkered down in their own countries and playing online

52:27.600 --> 52:32.720
only match matches. They're structured around regional tournaments. They're splitting up,

52:32.720 --> 52:39.920
uh, the league into two divisions, North America and European. Um, so they're going to be playing

52:39.920 --> 52:47.440
in the 13 team North American division, and then the remaining seven are going to be played in the

52:47.440 --> 52:55.200
Asia division. And then, um, yeah, I mean, it's, it's interesting. I mean, they have to obviously

52:55.200 --> 53:00.080
adapt with everything. Hopefully this year, things will be starting to kind of, uh, the restrictions

53:00.080 --> 53:04.960
will be loosening up towards the end of the year. So things can get back to normal, but it sounds

53:04.960 --> 53:10.400
like it's going to be business as usual, aside from, you know, the structure, the, uh, format changes

53:10.400 --> 53:16.320
for these. So, um, fifth dream in chat says, whoa, Overwatch still exists. That kind of got quiet.

53:16.320 --> 53:20.960
Um, well, keep in mind, there's still Overwatch two on the horizon and they're expecting that that

53:20.960 --> 53:25.440
will certainly give the whole franchise a big kick in the butt because yeah, this whole COVID and

53:25.440 --> 53:30.080
pandemic situation really kind of ham hamstring to the Overwatch league, you know, justice,

53:30.080 --> 53:34.320
it was really starting to get its wings and really take off like COVID really. Well, I would say it

53:34.320 --> 53:39.520
was one, two punch. It wasn't just COVID, but the move to YouTube was a disaster. I'm sorry,

53:39.520 --> 53:44.160
but like it just like the sense of community that they had on Twitch and everything that was a

53:44.160 --> 53:48.320
disaster. Whoever thought of that idea to move. I know they did it for money, but that was,

53:48.320 --> 53:53.280
it was a dumb move. Sorry. Not sorry. That's reality. Um, and so those two things like back

53:53.280 --> 53:57.680
to back, I think really kind of, and I'm not saying like Overwatch league is fucked,

53:57.680 --> 54:01.200
they're over anything like that. Like certainly no, there's, there's still plenty of fans at

54:01.200 --> 54:06.960
Overwatch league. And I think in the long run, especially when two does come out, um, it will,

54:06.960 --> 54:11.120
you know, I think start to get a lot of that growth that was all that was starting to really

54:11.120 --> 54:17.680
be behind it until these situations really, I think kind of put a stop to it for a little bit.

54:17.680 --> 54:24.640
Um, I would fully expect blizzard does not launch Overwatch two until the pandemic is

54:25.520 --> 54:30.240
starting to look like it is in the rear view mirror. I know there's plenty of people saying

54:30.240 --> 54:35.200
COVID will always be around always be, but as far as, you know, uh, being able to have these

54:35.200 --> 54:38.720
big events again, enough people are getting vaccinated and at least the numbers in the

54:38.720 --> 54:44.320
U S are allowing for big events again and that sort of thing. Um, I think blizzard would be

54:44.320 --> 54:49.760
very smart to hold on to Overwatch two until then. And then the Overwatch league, I think will kind

54:49.760 --> 54:57.600
of, um, be in a good place again. Yes. And then on the opposite end of the spectrum there, you

54:57.600 --> 55:04.320
have Capcom announcing that the upcoming Capcom cup and street fighter, uh, league world

55:04.320 --> 55:10.960
championship have been canceled, um, due to obviously the rising cases of COVID-19. Um,

55:10.960 --> 55:15.760
they've made the decision to cancel those in place. They're going to be doing an online

55:15.760 --> 55:20.960
season final for the Capcom pro tour on February 20th and 21st.

55:22.720 --> 55:27.920
Um, tiger claw and chat says, and when they announced Overwatch two, you can expect some

55:27.920 --> 55:32.480
really massive pre-rendered cinematic. Technically Overwatch two has already been announced with a

55:32.480 --> 55:38.160
massive pre-rendered cinematic. However, blizzard likes to drop those pretty regularly and it's

55:38.160 --> 55:42.800
almost certain they will do more character reveals. And if I'm not mistaken, they have

55:42.800 --> 55:48.720
an event, a virtual event in February that I think is supposed to make, uh, kind of make up for their

55:48.720 --> 55:51.840
lack of Blizzcon. Cause obviously with everything in the world, they didn't have a Blizzcon in

55:51.840 --> 55:56.560
November for obvious reasons. So I believe they're doing a virtual event in February, ironically

55:56.560 --> 56:02.800
enough. So is the team behind Final Fantasy 14 is doing an event February 5th, where it's all

56:02.800 --> 56:08.560
but certain the next 14 expansion will be unveiled. And I think blizzard, um, they're

56:08.560 --> 56:13.920
really not due to announce a wow expansion cause one just came out, but certainly Overwatch two

56:13.920 --> 56:20.000
Diablo four might even get a date. I don't know how far along it is that Diablo cell phone game

56:20.000 --> 56:25.120
has all but vanished. So I wonder if they're still going to release it. They might, you know,

56:25.120 --> 56:28.160
time that with February. So blizzard still has a lot of news they're kind of sitting on too.

56:28.880 --> 56:34.320
And I think we'll see all that in February. So, um, I want, before we get to our next story,

56:34.320 --> 56:38.960
I wanted to go back to the earlier, uh, story that Jamie was talking about with leaving notes

56:38.960 --> 56:43.840
and games. Cause there's a really good comment here, uh, from, from our own voiceover guy,

56:43.840 --> 56:50.880
VX Jason XV, who says my note, I would leave pepperoni and cheese. And you know what that

56:50.880 --> 56:56.480
reminded me of is actually like one of the earliest implementations of this before Mario

56:56.560 --> 57:04.720
maker before dark souls, the Oregon trail. Remember when you would die on the Oregon trail,

57:04.720 --> 57:10.560
you could leave a tombstone behind and put like, you could either put like, you know, pepperoni

57:10.560 --> 57:14.320
and sausage was a big one that people would always do. Or you could put like, you know,

57:15.760 --> 57:19.520
name of my third grade teacher died of syphilis here or something like that, you know, whatever

57:19.520 --> 57:24.160
it is, you could put whatever notes you wanted to. And then the players that would come through

57:24.160 --> 57:30.720
later would see those tombstones. So really even before Mario maker or dark souls, the Oregon

57:30.720 --> 57:36.720
trail was the first game that left that technology. That is great. I thought that was worth bringing

57:36.720 --> 57:41.520
up. All right. Anyhow, let's move on and we'll actually continue talking about Blizzard a little

57:41.520 --> 57:48.000
bit because this has to do with a redesign for the battle net, uh, client getting rid of real names.

57:48.000 --> 57:54.080
Well, they got rid of that a long time ago. You never had to do that. Uh,

57:54.080 --> 58:02.880
they realized it was a bad idea. You can connect it to Facebook, I think, or you can choose who

58:02.880 --> 58:07.520
sees that. I don't remember. You know what? Now that I think about it, I think my real name is

58:07.520 --> 58:12.240
still visible on there and I don't like it, but I only show it to people that I know in real life.

58:12.880 --> 58:16.480
I think it's the whole, you can choose to show your real name to like close friends

58:16.480 --> 58:19.920
or something like that. I don't know. Oh, it's been a while since I played Overwatch.

58:19.920 --> 58:23.840
It has. Thank you for reminding me about that real name policy, but anyway, um,

58:24.880 --> 58:29.120
otherwise the client has been redesigned. It is interesting because it is still kind of blending

58:29.120 --> 58:34.400
in the Activision games, which have been in battle net for some time. That's not really new news that

58:34.400 --> 58:39.120
call of duty games are in there, but like you really see it in this new redesign that actually

58:39.120 --> 58:44.480
kind of separates, uh, things into Blizzard and Activision, which is kind of interesting. Uh,

58:44.560 --> 58:48.240
they're saying in this, and I did check it out earlier, but I've been in the beta for a while.

58:48.240 --> 58:53.040
So I've actually saw these changes a while ago, but, uh, there's a new expansive layout for news

58:53.040 --> 58:57.840
and game content and full page view. There's a new social pain. So you can better see friends

58:57.840 --> 59:01.600
and what they're doing in games right now. I have a lot of friends still playing. Wow.

59:01.600 --> 59:07.040
I sign on. There's at least 13 people on my list and wow at any given time. Uh, and they're also

59:07.040 --> 59:11.840
talking about accessibility improvements and that's cool. You can navigate most of the app

59:11.840 --> 59:17.600
with your keyboard and it has better screen reader support as well as improved color contrast.

59:17.600 --> 59:22.080
And those are all great things, uh, to see as well. So if you haven't checked out your battle

59:22.080 --> 59:28.080
net client in a while, it's going to look a lot different next time you launch it. Let's move on

59:28.080 --> 59:34.640
dark soccer. I got a bunch of stuff here. So, um, who remembers Lucas arts?

59:35.280 --> 59:39.680
Well, of course who doesn't? I had friends that worked at Lucas arts. That's how I got to go to

59:39.680 --> 59:48.720
the Skywalker ranch. Yeah. Um, but now we have a Lucasfilm games. So this officially, uh, revealed

59:48.720 --> 59:56.080
by starwars.com that Lucasfilm games is their, uh, identity for their gaming stuff coming from

59:56.080 --> 01:00:01.280
Lucasfilm. Which I also believe was the name of Lucas arts for a brief period in the beginning

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:07.680
before they changed it. Yes. It's kind of like back, back to basics. Yeah, exactly. Um, but

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:12.080
they're really wanting to have this focus specifically on some of the new games that

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:16.960
are come out, bring out the news directly, sort of like, I guess, have their own directs, like how

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:25.360
Nintendo does. Um, but, uh, they are, um, still working of course, though, with, uh, with other

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:32.160
parties out there, you know, they're not just gonna, gonna do it alone. Um, there is, uh, an

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:40.400
open world star wars game being made by Ubisoft. I'm doing a, sorry. Uh, it looks like it might be,

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:45.360
no, it's just, it just says open world game. I don't see anything about it being, uh, uh,

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:51.520
um, an MMO or anything, but it's by Ubisoft massive, the same group that did, uh, the division.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:01:00.320
So there's some talk about that coming out. Um, and then in, uh, other things, um, uh,

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:07.120
machine games is making an Indiana Jones game. So, uh, and it's going to be a collab between

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:14.240
machine games and Lucasfilm games. Neat machine games, by the way, is a, is a part of Bethesda.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:19.840
Yeah. Uh, which, which will be interesting cause the whole Microsoft connection there now too,

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:24.080
which this was probably something that the gears were already turning on before Microsoft bottom.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:27.600
So that is going to make that whole situation more interesting, I think in a way.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:32.320
So I just wanted to have like a mini game. That's how many Nazis can you punch in a minute?

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:40.160
Um, Bobby Black Wolf in chat actually points out it was Lucasfilm games from 1982 to 1990. So it

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:44.720
was more than a brief period, but only the nineties count here at OLR actually. Uh, no,

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:50.160
thanks for the clarification. Um, tiger class says Lucasfilm games has a big library of IPs.

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:55.920
They can bring back besides star wars in Indiana Jones. Oh, hell yeah. Loom. Um, what maniac

01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:00.080
mansion was all part of that too, right? There's a new mania mansion to be amazing,

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:03.360
but they, they kind of did bring that back already. Didn't they,

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:05.920
didn't that come back a couple of years ago under a different, I mean,

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.680
I don't, did they do a telltale? I don't think they did a telltale series for mania mania

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:16.880
mansion aside from just day of the tentacle. Maybe it was a spiritual successor. Maybe that's

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:20.720
where monkey Island would be nice. I mean, you can never have too much monkey Island.

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:27.800
Obviously we're getting some more salmon max. So, um, that's always good. Um,

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:33.520
Ooh. Yeah. Questbuster points out it released games under that label,

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:39.600
such as their adaptation for labyrinth. Yes. It even had David Bowie. Ooh. Ooh,

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:44.960
I'd be in for that. That's for sure. So that's pretty cool. Yeah, no, they had a lot of great

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:49.760
IPs, but obviously they're leveraging some of this big shit. I mean, you don't partner up

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:55.840
with Lucas, you know, entertainment and not get your star Wars on and your Indiana Jones.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:00.560
Like these are the, these are the big ones. And I'm sure if these do well, we'll start to see some

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:07.920
of the, um, lesser known ones that will pop in as well for sure. So, all right. Well, if that's

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.680
all we have for that, then let's move on to our next story. Loki.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:19.280
All right. Um, so it's always fun to talk about like different records being broken on Twitch.

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:25.760
So now we have yet another all time Twitch viewership records set by a Spanish streamer

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:31.040
by the name of the Greg or is that the Greff? I don't know how to pronounce his name. Uh,

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:40.240
but anyways, so he apparently was already a pretty popular streamer. He had, I think a record of 660,000

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:46.640
concurrent viewers for his Fortnite Galactus event that was back in December. And then of course,

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:53.120
because he's such a big, uh, Fortnite streamer, he was unveiling his brand new exclusive Fortnite

01:03:53.120 --> 01:04:03.440
skin, um, that he was, uh, showing off. So because of that, his view count actually went up to 2.4

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:10.960
million, which was now the brand new record for that. So that's even, um, beating out

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:20.960
AOC is among the stream, uh, the AOC streams, um, and several entire like communities of games

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:25.680
at one time. So that's pretty crazy. Well, it's also worth considering that, um, you know,

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.880
sometimes our focus and our reality is very centric around the United States.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:35.200
And we are certainly aware that there are other countries out there, you know, in Canada and

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:41.520
overseas and, uh, Mexico and all that. But I think it also kind of goes to show like how

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:47.440
big of an audience there is in like Latin America for video games. Cause, um, he, he's a Spanish

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:52.800
streamer. He's, he speaks Spanish on streams and all that I'm sure. Right. So it's, it's a big

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:58.960
audience that I think sometimes we might forget is there if we don't speak that language ourselves.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:04.720
And I think it just shows that like, there's huge demand for this in non English speaking countries.

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:11.520
Yeah. For just gaming in general. Absolutely. So, and act deft who I was hoping would agree with me

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:19.680
does. Thank you. I, we, we have, we have our official ambassador to Mexico and active,

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:23.120
although there actually are some other listeners in Mexico. Cause I interact with some on Twitter.

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:27.840
So I don't, I don't want to give all the glory to act deft, but since he is here live, I will let

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:34.560
him have most of it. So, but a lot of love for all of our listeners in Mexico and all the other

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:40.640
countries around the world that aren't just the U S all right. Anyway, uh, pretty cool though.

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:44.560
Uh, interesting that it is still Fortnite that breaks all these records, right?

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:50.000
Yeah. You know, after all this time, I mean, it's still a very popular game, so.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:56.080
I was reading some article on one of those sites. I don't know if it's Kotaku or what it was,

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:59.840
but it was one of those sites. It was talking about that. There's another game that's like

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:05.280
seven years old or something that is starting to find new light on Twitch. Like it's just come out

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:10.400
again out of nowhere, kind of like among us did recently. There's some other new game rust.

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:16.640
Yeah. Rust was because of offline TV. They're doing some, uh, thing with that. I, I did,

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:21.280
I caught a little bit of it, but yeah, it's, they're doing some sort of, I think this is

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:25.440
almost kind of like going back to us talking about with the Minecraft S and P stuff where they'll

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:30.800
kind of structure an event based around like a certain game and do kind of like role play

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:36.160
or whatever with that. And it draws in a lot of viewers. My point is, is that Pixel Poops

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:43.840
will have its day. It will be discovered eventually. And actually on a side note,

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:48.880
uh, with YYR's version of Pixel Poops, I should give a shout out. Um, if you are on our discord

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:53.840
server, cause I need to mention this at some point in the show, um, over at, um, uh, I almost

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:59.280
said Twitch TV, uh, slash vog network is where you can watch the shows, but over at vognetwork.com

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:04.240
slash discord, you can get an invite to our discord server. And if you take a look in our

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:11.840
OLR chat room, there is detail about how you can beta test Pixel Poops for steam and everything

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:17.280
is in fact, I just got my code, so I'm going to be playing it later. Maybe I'll even do a stream.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:22.560
We'll see. So check that out. All the info's in our discord, uh, and, uh, and YYR is hooking

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:27.360
people up right now. So check that out. Uh, Bobby Blackall was saying his game super multitasking

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:32.480
is apparently big in South Korea. Fucking finally that game is getting some traction.

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:37.200
Like that game is brilliant. I hope more people find it than just South Korea.

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:43.040
Um, although it has to, it always, it has to start somewhere. And so why not? It's as good

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:49.600
of a place as any. All right, let's move on. I want to talk about some of the news that

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:54.080
actually came out of consumer electronics show. There wasn't a ton, a ton of gaming news,

01:07:54.080 --> 01:08:00.480
but we did get as expected. We kind of figured this was coming on last week's show arcade one up

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:05.280
since those are, yes, it's gaming, but it's also like furniture in your living room,

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:10.960
dedicated devices type of stuff. CES is kind of the place for that. So, and yes,

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:17.280
we got some new news on arcade cabinets from, uh, CES 2021 for, um, from arcade one up.

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:23.280
And I got to say, these are some fucking good cabinets. Like this, this first one blew my mind.

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:30.480
It is a killer instinct cabinet with killer instinct, killer instinct two and battle toads,

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:35.840
battle toads, double dragon. It's like a rare cabinet. So that is awesome. Like just having

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:41.840
the arcade version of killer instinct two. Fuck. That's awesome. So that like, I want it, but I

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:46.640
don't have the room for it. Here's something that's definitely up dark Sakura's alley a little bit.

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:51.120
And I think it's up mine too. I would love this machine. Although, um, these games have been

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:58.320
released a million times, but why not a cabinet for dragon's lair, dragon's lair two and space

01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:04.960
ACE. And what's really cool about that. You can get one that is either a dragon's lair cabinet,

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:10.240
or you can get a space ACE cabinet, but the entire in the inside parts are still the same.

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:14.320
So that's kind of, so if you want like a S I almost think the space ACE is a little

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:17.920
more desirable because you don't see that one as much. Dragon's lair is kind of everywhere,

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:22.160
but that is neat. I don't know, dark soccer. You've probably played those games to death,

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:25.440
but I know you have a lot of love for Don Bluth. So I don't know, maybe.

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:30.560
I, I, I do. It's I really like his animation. I'll be honest. I'm really not all that great

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:36.240
at either. Um, uh, really any of those cinematic, you know, press the button at the right time type

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:42.880
stories. Um, but I certainly like watching other people play it. I, I certainly, I mean,

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:46.640
they're, they're both great games. I've played quite a bit of dragon's lair, dragon's lair,

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:52.800
two, um, space ACE, um, cliff jumper, which was the loop on the third. Oh,

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:58.560
one. Um, there's that one with the car. What was the one with the car? I played that on Sega CD.

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:05.200
I think I don't remember the one with the car. Um, and it always makes me think of, um,

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:12.880
um, oh gosh, as a, another, uh, it reminds me of the anime writing bean, which it's an

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:18.720
IDs era one. Um, we've had like the special car and everything. It was the race car. Why can't

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:23.680
I think of the name of it now? That one was always fun, but I, I was never any good at them.

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:27.680
And tiger client chat says, maybe they'll release those other laser disc games. You never know.

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:33.120
I mean, now there has been a precedent set that if they want to, they can update those,

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:37.520
those cabinets with new games. And Bobby black Wolf went into great detail on an earlier episode

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:42.160
of his show about, you know, for better or for worse. And actually that is all on the YouTube.

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:46.800
Uh, I know I don't plug the, the VOG network YouTube very often, but that is all chronicled

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:52.480
there. If you want to see that. So like an actual, his outrun cabinet actually got a new game. Um,

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:56.560
even though it was a little bit of pain in the ass to make work, he detailed all that in a video.

01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:01.120
So yes, they could add a new game. These are running off of laser discs anymore.

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:04.960
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. They're just running off of like a USB stick at this point.

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:09.120
So yeah, that's where we're at now. Maybe it was road Avenger, SSG 100. Matt

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:12.560
was suggesting. I kind of think it started with a T, but I might be wrong.

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:18.400
Anyway. I also wanted to call out before we get to, yeah, it was road blast. It was a road blaster,

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:22.560
road Avenger. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I was like road blasters was a different game, but I it's okay.

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:28.800
It's a different. I think it's in like kind of that universe. Yeah. Road Avenger was the game.

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:34.320
Ironically, it was road blaster overseas. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Cause here in America,

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:38.480
here in America road blaster was ironically to bring it full circle, the Atari game

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:44.240
that had the, you know, you had the lasers and stuff on there. So, um, that, that was

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:48.880
an awesome game too. So, all right. Anyway, uh, some other cabinets, I didn't even get to the

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:53.120
other cabinets, although these are, these are a little more recycled cabinets, but kinda like,

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:58.880
you know, uh, freshened up, uh, with a new retro look, uh, there's going to be a new Atari cabinet,

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:05.120
um, that has quite a few games in it. I don't know that game, um, asteroids, asteroid, deluxe,

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:10.000
centipede, crystal castles, gravatar, liberator, major havoc, millipede, missile command space,

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:16.160
dual and tempest. Whew. That's a very, very stocked cabinet. There is a Bondi Namco cabinet,

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:21.200
uh, that will have dig dug, dig dug to Gallagher, Galaxian, Pac-land Pac-Man,

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:27.360
Pac-Mania, Pac and Pal, Mappy, Rompers, Super Pac-Man. That's a pretty stocked cabinet as well.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:33.520
And then there will be a Capcom cabinet with 1994, Loopmaster, Commando, Dark Stalkers,

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:39.600
Final Fight, Ghosts and Goblins, Street Fighter, Street Fighter 2 Turbo, Street Fighter 2 Basic,

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:50.320
and Strider. So that, uh-oh, uh-oh. Uh, there is a new Capcom cabinet and Strider is one of the

01:12:50.320 --> 01:13:04.240
games in it. One of the Arcade 1-Up machines. Uh-oh. Damn it. I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:09.680
have to, I have to leave now because I have to go harass my husband and tell him that such a thing

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:16.480
is going to exist. The moment that broke Dark Sakura finally on Arcade 1-Up, I'm just, I'm dying

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:22.160
over here. What? Well, there's some, but we were thinking about getting, but I mean,

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:30.800
that was, that was me when, when burger time finally happened. God

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:38.080
damn it. They find, they got, they got me gal. They already had it in the Final Fight cabinet

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:42.000
at one point. Oh really? You know, those were marked down to $50 at one point too.

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:46.400
Yeah, I couldn't find them, but I need to, I need to tell husband.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:50.960
Bonds006 says her eyes glazed over when nostalgia. Yep.

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:59.440
Uh, Bobby Blackwall says that was me with Star Wars. And then again with Outrun. I think I,

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:04.320
you know, speaking of Star Wars, I think I texted Melody when that happened. Cause she's always been

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:08.080
huge into Star Wars. One of my good gal pals, Melody. We, I know we've brought up on the show

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:15.280
before, uh, married to, uh, Mel B who everybody in DDR knew back in the day. Um, she's really

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:19.920
super into Star Wars. And I think I remember a text message exchange where I text her that

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:30.160
Star Wars cabinet and it was, that's basically the reply I got. God damn it. It's just, it's the

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:35.600
sound of your wallet. Like just a God, just tell me where I got to send the money. We're doing,

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:41.920
we're doing all this other shit in my house. But you know what? But is the Strider cabinet

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:49.440
one of them? Well, I mean, honestly enough, if we sold like a pinball, we could buy

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:58.240
four machines like this, I don't know, maybe four, four or five or six, who knows? But yeah,

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:03.920
no, I, I, I, I'm just thinking that if there was going to be one that was to be purchased,

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:09.920
I think that Strider might be the one that, that breaks down. Finally broke. All right.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.720
I feel like this should be a thing with arcade one up. Like what is your God damn it cabinet?

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:22.320
What is the cabinet arcade one up has to announce that's going to make you know, God damn it. And

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:26.960
now you got to buy it. Like, like for example, for most, for most people in chat, I'm sorry,

01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:32.160
for most people in chat, spy Hunter, imagine that because that spy Hunter cabinet, God damn it.

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:38.240
All right. So you can check online. Brick seek, for example, is a good place to check for like

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:41.920
discounts. So like we've got one in a local Walmart here. They have the

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:47.680
moral combat cabinet for 75 bucks. Ooh. Ooh. I kind of see that one.

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:55.200
Cause see, it's not that I'd be saving money. I would be losing $75 for games I already own.

01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:00.480
I would be losing space. I don't have in this house. So I already told you,

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:04.640
you could borrow a pinball. I know. I know when we, when we get the new one, maybe.

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:14.880
All right. Anyhow, but not theater, but not that one. Damn. All right. You can borrow anything you

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:24.320
want, but you can't borrow that. Okay. I would do anything for pinball, but I won't do all right.

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:28.400
Forget it. You know what? Let's just get to the classic game of the week before this segment gets

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:35.280
ugly. Every week, our soccer steps into the gaming vault and she says, God damn it. It's

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:40.160
been a long time since I played this game. I'm like, God damn it. If someone needs to

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:46.560
dust in here. It's a classic game of the week. Ironically, the game last week was Strider,

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:51.760
although different Strider, but anyway, it's just for you, Rob. Everything is coming full

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:57.920
circle on OLR tonight. Anyway, but we have a, we have a fun one tonight. I like this choice.

01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:02.080
Classic of the week, dark soccer is going to find a game that's 10 years older or more

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:06.080
to reflect on fondly. And I think for me, I was like, Oh God, this game is, this game is

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:11.920
probably like 20 years old at this point. Yeah. So if you're going by the original,

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:18.800
which is where I'm starting. Yes, of course. So the classic game of the week is Cape story

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:27.040
or as it was in, uh, in Japanese doc to Monogatari. Um, so it is a, one of those quote,

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:32.880
Metroidvania style games. It came out for windows first. This is actually, I think one of the few

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:39.280
ones I've done that started off as a windows game. Um, and it was developed by a Japanese

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:46.800
developer Daisuke Amaya also goes by pixel. Um, and it's free time. Um, the game is a,

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:55.040
a 2d platformer, um, that has those, uh, exploratory elements and, uh, you know,

01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:01.040
discovery and different characters you, uh, encounter along the way and different

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:09.040
branching paths in the story. Um, and it's really one of those, uh, those, you know,

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:14.480
when someone thinks of an indie game cave story should really be the first one that comes to mind

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:21.200
because it was done by one person. You're right. And it broke through in such a way

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:26.800
to like, this was before things like axiom verge and I'm getting to that. Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:33.600
But no, but, uh, it really is the game. I think to the indie game to influence

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:38.960
maybe all indie games, you know, in the, in the modern era, you know, if one person can

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:42.640
make such an Epic game, who's to say that a couple of friends together can't make, you know,

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:48.720
an Epic game. So yeah. So that's where I was really going with that one. Um, and it is a

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:55.600
pretty fast paced game. Um, you basically start as a robot named quote, who wakes up with amnesia

01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:02.240
and must blow shit up and dig and look around and talk to people and figure out who he was

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:11.120
and power up and, uh, getting experience and talking to NPCs and, and having doors attack you.

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:18.800
Yes, you can be attacked by a door. Um, but I mean, it's a very simple game for how it plays,

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:24.880
you know, it's, you know, running, jumping, shooting shit. You've got your HUD, you have

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:31.120
your cute little pixely world and everything. And I remember playing, you know, uh,

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:38.640
translations of this, like in the early days, you know, but you also do have different, you know,

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:45.200
puzzles in the game that you have to solve and, you know, uh, getting through, uh, you know,

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:51.680
really like large amounts of enemies in some points. Um, and then, you know, it's also then

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:58.560
depending on what you do depends on what ending that you get. Like if you save this one character,

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:06.880
you get your memories back. If you, you know, if you don't meet this character, then it's a

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:12.880
completely different game as far as how it ends, you know, you, uh, people can, you know,

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:19.200
friends can turn into enemies if you don't do certain things in the game. So, um, and I'm not

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:22.800
going to, I mean, honestly, it's a, it's a fun game and I didn't really don't want to, want to

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:27.840
spoil it, but, you know, it's a game I really want people to go out and play. I mean, it's very,

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:34.400
it can be very complex. Um, but the game was actually developed over the course of five years.

01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:42.320
Um, uh, Pixel, uh, uh, created this when he was in college and worked on it after getting a job

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:47.600
as a software developer, he wrote, he started by writing title screen music and just different

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:54.480
character movements. And then, you know, the idea evolved from there, um, by him creating

01:20:54.480 --> 01:21:00.960
enclosed spaces, it kind of took that cave feel. And, um, you know, he said that because he didn't

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:05.680
plan it, he did have some problems down the line. Um, cause he didn't have like, you know,

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:11.360
map editing tools and different things to manage things, but he was really going for like an old

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:17.520
school game, something based off of Metroid, um, and pixel art, he wanted really pixel art games.

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:25.360
And so it is, uh, it's really become one of those games that, you know, got passed around from one

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:31.440
person to the next and, you know, different things. Um, but then we got later ports of it.

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:39.600
We had Linux, um, we had, uh, uh, let me see what the other ones were. So yeah, we had, um, uh,

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:49.760
Linux, we had haiku OS, uh, air Ross morph OS, Amiga OS, Mac OS 10, uh, PlayStation portable,

01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:55.920
Xbox streamcast, Sega Genesis, GP two X, GP two X whiz, TI graphing calculator.

01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:00.320
I knew this on my graphing calculator for the record. I was, I was like,

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:04.240
Sega Genesis. Like I knew about things like the 3DS and stuff where I played it, but I didn't

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:08.720
know they, they kind of demade it or, you know what I mean? Like kind of pushed it onto older

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:15.600
stuff too. That's pretty rad. Yeah. Um, but there's a, you know, with some of the other

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:22.480
versions that came out though, we did get updated an updated version. Um, and that came out, um,

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:29.200
on, we were, uh, on March 22nd, 2010 in North America and December 10th, 2010 in Europe.

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:36.800
It was also ported to DSI where, um, November 29th, 2010 in North America and the 22nd of November,

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:42.160
2011 in Japan, um, that didn't have the enhanced graphics from the Wii version,

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:49.680
but it did have the sanctuary attack mode. Um, there is a remake, like a free SDL based version

01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:54.880
of the game of, sorry, of the game engine called NX engine, um, that people have been using to

01:22:54.880 --> 01:23:01.760
modify the game and expand upon it. Um, there was also a re-release for the 3DS, uh, Nintendo E-shop

01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:08.640
and then, um, that version has the DSI, uh, uh, whereas a version of jukebox mode and the

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:14.560
additional modes that were included in cave story plus. So, um, that does bring me to cave story

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:22.000
plus, which was, uh, it has, um, a different script than the original English version. Um,

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:27.840
and it has basically all the various modes from the Wiiware version, the remastered soundtrack,

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:33.280
toggling the style of the graphics between the classic and the Wiiware version and the music and

01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:39.920
all of that has a wind fortress, uh, exclusive level, um, all kinds of stuff. And then you have

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:47.360
a cave story 3d, which is a 3d version of the game that was, uh, uh, published for the Nintendo 3DS.

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:53.200
Um, and I built back on that, but yeah, it had 3d models and a dynamic camera angle system and

01:23:53.200 --> 01:24:00.240
whatnot. I personally prefer just straight up pixels. I will play it. I have the steam copy and

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:07.520
I really like it. Um, but yeah, this game is, and on top of that, it's, it's a big game. I mean,

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:12.320
it's not like, I mean, there's, yeah, everyone's going to speed run whatever the crap they can,

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:18.240
but this game is, it's pretty big. It's going to, you know, be something that you'll sit down

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:27.520
and play for a little while. Um, but yeah, um, there, uh, there's been other, uh, uh, things

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:33.360
to come from this game. Um, the character quote, uh, is a downloadable character in bit trip,

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:40.480
uh, presents runner to future legend of rhythm, alien, um, curly brace. Another character in the

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:47.120
game is a bonus playable character. And, uh, 1,001 spikes. Both of them are in the crossover

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:53.600
fighting game blade strangers. Um, and quote, curly brace and ballast the last fight. Um,

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:59.520
they're all available in another game by the publisher, um, crystal crisis, and you can get

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:04.880
quotes hat in the game Terraria, but this game is considered really to be one of the most

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:11.360
influential, influential games that came out in the, in the aughts. Um, and really the fact that

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:19.440
one person could put this game out, it really, um, inspired other people to do the same. Um,

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:24.560
you know, one, uh, you know, doujin soft, which is a, uh, a Japanese independent game,

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:32.480
um, actually brought back that Metroidvania genre. A lot of people said so, um, and bringing

01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:37.920
back 2d games as a viable platform when everyone was smack dab in the middle of look at all my,

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:45.200
my, uh, polygons is, is so, and, you know, and it also, uh, some of the other games that this

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:52.240
one directly inspired are, were braid, super meat boy, Fez, Mega Man 11, even, um, and it's

01:25:52.240 --> 01:26:00.240
considered really one of the most, uh, influential games. Now, once it was released for free,

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:07.120
you know, but the company, uh, Nicholas, uh, that took over the publishing issued cease and desists

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:12.480
and DMCA against the fan projects that use the game's assets and the decompiled code base.

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:21.040
Um, but, uh, but there were a lot of game developers that really seem to criticize this

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:28.160
action, um, to apply, you know, retrospective rights, uh, to it, you know, because they didn't

01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:36.320
have the original rights on those releases. So, yeah, but anyway, there you go. Awesome game,

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:39.360
cave story. If you haven't played it, I highly suggest doing so.

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:44.560
Great pick. And like you said, I think, and I was kind of getting into there a little bit earlier,

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:50.080
is that like, you know, this game was right on the cusp of when those indie games really just

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:55.520
started to be everywhere because of the fact that the game consoles really started to open up to

01:26:55.520 --> 01:27:00.080
self publishing and that sort of thing. And then we saw more self publishing kind of happen on,

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:05.280
you know, steam platforms and, and, uh, PC and so forth, or, or, or the app store, if you will,

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:11.600
on the, um, uh, Apple side, you know, there's, this was really like a predecessor to all of

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:17.920
that. And I think, you know, there's a little something that all those things are, uh, owing

01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:24.000
to cave story for sure. Absolutely. Yeah. Great pick. So, yeah, well, I'm surprised I actually

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.000
hadn't done it because I mean, story is just one of those games that I remember just playing,

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.800
you know, translated copies of back in the day. Yeah. Uh, as Joe and her mat says,

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:36.480
I feel like this was in the early humble bundles. You're probably absolutely right.

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:42.080
Humble bundle seven. That's where I got it that late. I would have thought it was his one or two,

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:47.280
to be honest. Wow. I believe it was humble bundle seven. No cave story. Plus was a humble bundle

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:52.560
seven. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I played plus. That's right. I forgot. Yeah. Same thing. I remember

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:56.640
picking it up on the WiiWare or, um, was it, we were, no, it was three DS. I got it on three DS

01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:02.720
shop. Cause it was really cheap at one point. Yeah. I just had my, you know, my translated copy,

01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:08.720
my fan translation for the longest time. All right. So yeah. Cave story. All right. Let's

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:15.040
move on. We got to travel around the world and get some rapid fire news. Loki. All right. So

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:21.680
Hogwarts legacy has been delayed in 2022. Hopefully that'll give you enough time to forget

01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:27.360
all the things that, uh, the author said, well, she can, she can, the internet has an

01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:32.640
eternal memory. She can start with an apology, but at least this gives her time to do it, I guess,

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:38.400
but we'll, I'm not going to hold my breath. Yes. Basically, you know, they need more time for the

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:46.640
game. So 2022 for now. And then, uh, apparently Pokemon snap, since it's coming back brand new

01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:53.200
game, uh, they'll be coming out on the switch April 30th. And that was announced, um, with a

01:28:53.200 --> 01:29:00.160
real birthday. Yay. I can't wait to play the new, uh, Pokemon snap, to be honest,

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:04.640
it'll be fun about that. Looking forward to it. Speaking of Pokemon and Jason kind of addressed

01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:08.160
this in tonight's intro. And I think this is, uh, this is like one of those, like,

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:14.160
what type of things. But, um, as Jason pointed out in tonight's intro, uh, it's the Katy Perry

01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:19.680
has been tied with video games before. Uh, she did the Simlish stuff for the Sims. I forgot all

01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:24.480
about that until I heard tonight's intro. I was like, Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There was a few that

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:29.360
were involved with that, but, um, the reason why I'm calling out Katy Perry specifically is because,

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:35.040
uh, the Pokemon company has brought Katy Perry in who is well, and who's to say maybe Lily Allen

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:41.120
will be there too, because they say Katy Perry is the first in a star studded lineup of music stars

01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:48.000
that is supposed to work on what's called P25, a collection of artists that are celebrating

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:53.680
Pokemon throughout the year. You got, you got Jigglypuff. Who else do you need? Anyway,

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:57.840
we don't know exactly like what is Katy Perry doing? We don't know. We assume it's a song

01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:04.640
for maybe some type of soundtrack. Who knows? Um, anyway, uh, but they, they did announce there is,

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:08.480
there is a partnership with Katy Perry. Maybe she's going to host Pokemon idol. I don't know.

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:13.520
Anyway. Um, I suppose this is a good point for me to kind of call out to that there is a

01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:18.800
big rumor going around the internet, um, about diamond and Pearl remakes supposedly being

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:23.840
confirmed, although Nintendo hasn't confirmed shit, neither has the Pokemon company, but I guess

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:28.240
there is a URL that showed up that has a lot of people kind of going, Ooh. And then of course,

01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:33.440
one of those like, well, this website said it, so it must be true. So we're all still kind of

01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:37.600
waiting to see where that ultimately goes. I hope it's true. I'd love to see diamond Pearl remakes,

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:43.200
especially with Sword of Shield's quality of life improvements and tie into Pokemon home.

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:50.160
That'd be fucking great, but, um, you know, we'll see. Um, you would think we would get them, but I,

01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:56.080
again, I, I try not to expect anything from the Pokemon company or Nintendo, cause it usually

01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:59.760
leads to disappointment, but I want to make sure that got called out at some point tonight.

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:04.240
Um, one other story I have has to do with Scott Pilgrim versus the world, the game,

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:09.280
which a lot of people are being reintroduced to this week, or maybe finding it for the first time,

01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:14.800
uh, thanks to the remaster that just came out, uh, and due to all the discussion and interviews and

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:20.400
things, and people kind of poking away at this game, it was discovered, um, Brian Lee O'Malley,

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:25.120
who of course is the creator of, of the franchise, uh, mentioned there was supposed to be another

01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:30.960
DLC. Uh, it was going to be a DLC that focused on the clash at demon head. Uh, it was going to take

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:36.960
place in Montreal and it would actually have envy Adams, Todd Ingram and Lynette guy caught

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:43.040
would all be playable in it. Uh, in the end, the DLC was canceled because of budget cuts.

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:48.000
So I don't know, they cross your fingers in your toes. Maybe they could make that DLC for the new

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:54.800
one. But again, I would not set my expectations anywhere because that always leads to disappointment.

01:31:54.800 --> 01:32:00.480
Anyway, uh, dark Sakura, what do you have for us? How about what might've been, um,

01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:06.720
the, uh, super Famicom was supposed to have a back to the future RPG game, um, from what it

01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:14.720
looks like. Um, it was, uh, there were, it looks like, uh, like a few, uh, shots and some, uh,

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:21.920
sprites put out of, uh, doc Brown and Marty McFly. Um, but yeah, there was supposed to be, uh, kind

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:27.600
of almost like a Zelda like adventure game, um, for back to the future. Um, yeah, it would have

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:32.160
been cool. And it was based on back to the future too. So that would have been, that would have been

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:37.600
cool. One of my favorite games was Willow on the NES. And that was like a movie game that was kind

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:42.960
of Zelda inspired too. So I love that game. I know a lot of people give it shit, but I love that game.

01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:46.880
You know what I like better than that version of Willow, the arcade version,

01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:50.960
the arcade version of Willow was very different. Yeah. Dan and I actually watched a playthrough

01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:56.160
of that the other day. Um, and we were just talking about how there's these beautiful,

01:32:56.160 --> 01:33:02.960
like full-size portraits of, you know, of the, the characters in the movie, like, and this really

01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:09.920
kind of almost disturbing one of Val Kilmer as Badmartigan, but all of that was freaking done in

01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:15.120
pixels. Can you imagine if that had been in the nineties, can you imagine if that had been in the

01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:19.120
Capcom cabinet too, if I was like it's Strider and Willow, that would have been like double

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:24.240
goddamn it. Right. So, you know, you know, what would be like the perfect, uh, adventure one though

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:30.320
would be like three wonders, Strider and Willow. Ooh. Ooh. I'm sure the Willow, you know, the,

01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:36.800
the IP and all that, cause actually isn't Willow getting some sort of, I don't know, reboot or

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:40.800
sequel? Cause that's what every everything is all about now. And I swear there was something about

01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:45.760
like Netflix doing a new Willow of some type. Yeah. Yeah. Somebody's doing something there.

01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:50.880
And the thing that's getting me pissed off is that Willow already has a sequel.

01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:56.640
There were three books that came out. I, I have the books, they're dog-eared and I have read

01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:01.200
the shit out of them. It was, uh, the first one was called Shadow Moon. They were written by,

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:08.320
uh, George Lucas and Chris Claremont of X-Men history. Um, and it was really, really fucking

01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:14.400
good series of books. And if that came out as like a Netflix series, I would piss myself.

01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:19.200
Thank you. Everyone in chat is clarifying. It's a Disney plus. So, and that would make a lot of

01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:24.800
sense because Disney has the Lucas stuff, which I believe this is, was under the banner of Lucas

01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:31.520
arts if I'm not, or yeah. Right. Or Lucasfilm, excuse me. Um, yeah. I would sacrifice, I would

01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:36.160
give someone else's right arm for it to be based off of the books. Cause the books were amazing.

01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:42.880
And if none of you have read those three books, you need to read them. They are amazing. There's

01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:48.240
like one of my favorite book trilogies ever. I'll I'll find my, my, my copies are actually

01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:53.440
right over in a box behind me. So I'll have to, uh, to find them. But basically in a nutshell of

01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:59.280
it, it's sort of like the very beginning of the book is Willow, you know, all wrapped up in his

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:05.840
studies and comes to find out, you know, he goes to like magically visit Allura Dannon on her

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:11.680
birthday and gave her a little protective bear only to find out days later that, um, that Tara

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:18.400
Azleen is destroyed everyone in it, including Mad Martigan and Sorsha. Um, and he sort of goes

01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:23.920
down a completely different path and, and then he has to raise Allura Dannon by himself with

01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:29.440
the brownies. Well, and Bobby says the series is 30 years after the movie. Sia Tabiri is with you

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:34.320
though, that I wonder if it's based on the novel series. Um, you know what though, if they don't

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:40.640
want to bring back Val Kilmer, that could be a plot. I don't know. I want to get, I get what I

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:45.680
said earlier. Don't ever get your hopes up. Then you won't be disappointed. And, and this is right

01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:49.680
at the beginning of the book. So, um, it's not like the biggest of spoilers, but I mean, he does

01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:54.240
have an interaction right at the book cause he thinks he's dreaming, but he's talking to Sorsha

01:35:54.240 --> 01:36:00.160
and Mad Martigan and right at the beginning of the, of the thing. But the mo the books are so

01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:06.320
good. Like I almost, as much as I love the movie, I cannot separate how much I love those books from

01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:11.120
how much I love the movie too. So I really hope that it's based off of, uh, shadow moon and all

01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:14.400
of those. Right. Fair enough. Sorry. We got on a Willow tangent, but that's all right. We always

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:19.600
have room for that. It was a great movie. Um, and then, uh, and then there was a canceled, uh,

01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:28.080
Capcom generations, um, that these, uh, screenshots have, uh, been, uh, uh, uh, surfaced

01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:36.320
and Mike, Oh my God, Chris was involved in okay. Chris Tang, uh, he, um, he was, uh,

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:45.120
leading the team for the development of it. Um, and so, uh, basically, um, it was a, uh,

01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:54.480
action game engine, a proprietary action game, uh, engine that, uh, was, it went into a couple

01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:58.640
of other failed, uh, pitches that were supposed to go out, but there were different Capcom

01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:02.960
characters that were playable, such as mega man and Dante from devil may cry, Yoon from

01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:09.200
street fighters, super Joe from bionic commando. And, uh, it was a little bit of a passion project

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:16.240
that never got off the ground, but he's got a playable, uh, uh, prototype apparently. Um,

01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:22.720
and hopefully we'll get to see it. I might have to just, you know, go bust out. I wonder if this

01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:26.880
has anything to do with that game that Capcom teased at one point that looked like a Capcom

01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:30.560
universe type of thing. And like, some people were like, is this like a mega man maker with

01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:33.600
like street fighter? Do you remember that? They show like a quick little movie at like some E3

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:37.200
and then it, it vanished. It was canceled. Never heard from again. It was a Capcom universe or

01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:43.360
something like that. Uh, I wonder if this was somehow related to that. Oh, just weird.

01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:47.120
I don't remember. Yeah. Somebody in chat's got to know what I'm talking about.

01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:52.400
I'm not, I, I I'll, I'll be honest. I, I'm actually kind of curious to

01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:56.880
just ask him straight up about it. Was it mega man universe? I guess maybe it

01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:02.240
was mega man universe, but this was like a Capcom generations. Yeah. That's what it was called.

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:04.800
Right. Right. But I just remember it because there was some trailer and it had like mega

01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:07.920
man and then like the characters from street fighter showed up and it was like, what?

01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:14.960
So I just remember that was a big thing. Anyway. All right. All right. Well, less, less fan stuff,

01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:19.040
more, uh, reality stuff. What is coming out around the world this week? We're going to

01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:23.840
travel around the world and check out some release dates and we'll start with the U S and see if,

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:26.160
see if things are starting to pick back up again with releases.

01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:31.200
Um, not a whole lot of stuff coming out, but we've got some pretty big things. So

01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:37.200
starting off with hit man three on PC, Nintendo's PlayStation four PlayStation five,

01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:44.880
X-Box one X-Box series X and stadia, uh, ride four on PlayStation five and X-Box series that,

01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:53.440
and then we have skull, the hero Slayer on PC, and finally bladed fury on Nintendo switch,

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:59.680
PlayStation four and X-Box one. And just to clarify for chat before I get to Japanese

01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:04.960
release dates, this was not the mega man cross street fighter. That was a separate thing where

01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:08.640
they put like the street fighter bosses into a mega man thing. And that was like a download

01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:12.720
thing that Capcom did for some anniversary or I don't know what it was, but that is actually not

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:17.520
the same thing I was thinking about, but the chat does seem to coalesce on. It was mega man universe.

01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:22.320
It was like a mega man maker where you could use early Capcom sprites, including like box art,

01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:27.360
mega man. Yeah. That was it. That was it clearly a different project than what dark soccer is

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:32.640
referring to, but I couldn't help but see a common thread there. So I was kind of curious if one kind

01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:38.320
of influenced the other or what, but they both got canceled, which is a bummer. Let's go to Japan

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:41.520
and check out the releases there, which are picking up again. It's been a few weeks since

01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:45.600
we've had some Japanese releases, but now we're back at it on the Nintendo switch this week on

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:51.600
the 21st samurai force Shing and samurai Jack battle through time, both get their releases in

01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:56.960
Japan this week. Uh, and then quickly looking at the PlayStation five and the PlayStation four,

01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:03.680
um, FIFA, I'm sorry, FIFA 21 is next week. So I guess it's still pretty slow on the five

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:09.440
and on the four this week, we have those same games I mentioned on the switch and that's it.

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:14.160
So it's still a little slow. Things really start to pick back up next week though. So

01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:20.400
especially with the new FIFA, uh, dark soccer, how about the UK? Only two. Um, on the 20th,

01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:25.360
we have hit man three. And then on the 21st for PlayStation, we have ride four.

01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:30.800
All right. All right. We're going to get in some more stories and we'll be getting to your emails

01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:35.920
at participate at orange laundry.com a little later, along with your chat influenced, um,

01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:40.240
topics and comments when we get into the listener round table, but we have some more stories for

01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:46.240
your first starting with Loki. Yeah. So this is pretty cool. So there's a brand new campaign

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:53.840
that's being created for portal two called a portal to desolation. And if you, if you won't

01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:58.960
make portal three, we will. Well, the thing is that with valve though, is they they've done this

01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:06.320
before. Like there's been other like portal, um, like full game, like full, like total conversions

01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:11.440
that have been put out. Um, so this is not anything new, but, um, I mean, it is something

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:18.240
new, but it's been done before. So this is supposed to take place, um, in the eighties

01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:25.840
and it features there's star characters called Diana. And it has a brand new like cybernetic

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:32.560
arm system thing that you have almost looks like a Samus's arm cannon, but it's, uh, it has an

01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:38.640
integrated, uh, portal device inside of it as well called brace. And it looks pretty cool. They have

01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:43.200
like a little teaser trailer out there that shows like one of the first, like, um, kind of one of

01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:47.680
the puzzle levels that's in the game. And I really liked the vibe and it kind of reminds me though,

01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:52.720
they have like a lot of, uh, you know, uh, the transitions between screens are almost like half

01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:59.440
life two or half life, I think actually. So, uh, pretty cool. It's been in development for three

01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:04.880
years already. Um, no word yet on what's expected to be out, but I mean, if they're teasing it

01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:10.320
maybe relatively soon, maybe it will be a kind of thing where like, if I already own portal too,

01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:15.920
then I can like kind of grab this. Yeah. I think what it is, if it's anything like the other,

01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:21.680
uh, portal, uh, campaign that they've had out there, you basically have any source engine

01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:27.920
game. You can play this. Oh, interesting. Okay. All right. Well, moving on, let's talk about some

01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:32.800
of the other announcements at CES, although some of these weren't really intentional because some

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:38.080
of these got revoked. And what I'm talking about is that Sony actually had a keynote. And in that

01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:42.800
keynote, they address some upcoming games for the PlayStation five and kind of detailing what to

01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:47.600
look forward to on PlayStation, but was what was interesting is that there were, there was just a

01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:53.200
few frames of some text that had some copyright specifics that gave more information as to when

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:59.520
some of these games were coming out. For example, Square Enix's project Aethia coming out January

01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:06.320
2022. If you take this splash screen, literally, which again, it was, they went back and they took

01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:10.640
it out of the trailer. Uh, they kind of like re-uploaded it or whatever. So they probably

01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:14.400
did not want to be married to any of these dates, especially things that are really far out,

01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:19.840
especially with the pandemic's future still uncertain, um, and all that. So, uh, I can see

01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:22.880
why they went back and changed it, but it was interesting to see some of the things that they

01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:28.080
were thinking or that, you know, might be, you know, kind of what to expect, uh, ghost wire,

01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:35.280
Tokyo and stray that game with the cats that got her his attention 83, both October of 2021. Again,

01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:40.640
if you put all your stock into that screen, hit man three was a part of that presentation and

01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:47.760
said January, 2021, which that part was pretty locked in, um, solar ash, June of 2021,

01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:55.280
Kena breed bridge of spirits, March of 2021, little devil inside July, 2021 horizon,

01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:59.200
forbidden West. They didn't give a month, but they did say late 2021. So,

01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:03.520
and that's not too surprising to hear. That's probably Sony's big game for this year.

01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:10.480
What I thought was interesting though, pragmata also had a date 2023.

01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:17.440
So some of those games you're going to be waiting a little while, but I mean,

01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:22.960
that's pretty typical though of Sony. How many years do we wait for like among us or not among

01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:31.600
us? Um, okay. Last of us to remember that E3 where like they just owned it. Like they, they

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:37.120
made, they literally made everybody cry because back to back was like final fantasy seven is being

01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:43.920
remade. Shenmue three is real. And there was another big one. Oh, the last guardian is coming

01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:51.440
back. I think we're all in the same like thing. Um, that, how long did those games actually take

01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:57.920
to happen a very long time? And that's, you know, that's Sony's thing and Hey, it works for them.

01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:03.280
By the way, if you want to believe rumors and I do believe this one, uh, speaking of the final

01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:08.480
fantasy seven remake, there's another rumor going around social media that the PC and PlayStation

01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:12.640
five version is coming out later this year. And that would not surprise me one bit. What

01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:18.400
surprises me is the Xbox and Microsoft is left out. Um, there must be some interesting reason

01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:23.200
for that, but I'm not surprised. I said that on the show, not that long ago. And it doesn't,

01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:27.920
it doesn't take a genius to figure that out. That absolutely square is going to rerelease that on

01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:32.160
PlayStation five and get its money all over again. Hell yeah. And then of course, a lot of people

01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:38.480
are waiting for the PC version so you can mod it. So if you want your nude mods and whatever else,

01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:47.040
you know, have at it. There you go. Anyway, uh, let's move on. Let's talk about another

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:51.760
old game, dark soccer. Well, more like other people talking about an old game.

01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:58.640
So, um, I don't know how many people, you know, listening like video game documentaries, uh,

01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:04.240
we're certainly big fans of them at my house. Yeah. Um, so there's going to be one about NBA

01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:14.800
Jam. Um, yeah. And I mean, and it was like, you know, the nineties were the heyday of,

01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:22.880
you know, of like the NBA franchise, right? We had space jam. It was all about Michael Jordan.

01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:31.360
Um, and so we had NBA Jam and those, those, uh, you know, we had it in my, in my arcade,

01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:34.880
you couldn't walk by without hearing a boom shakalaka every so often, you know,

01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:40.640
he's on fire. He's on fire. Yeah. I don't talk about sports games a lot, but NBA Jam,

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:45.680
I will tell you that was an incredible sport. That was like probably my second favorite sports

01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:52.800
game ever next to sports game. Cause it was unrealistic. So actually, yes. And I mean,

01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:57.600
and I remember, you know, finding the, uh, the, the, the different builds of it where you could

01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:02.160
play as the mortal combat characters in it and everything. Remember? Yes. Because the NBA wasn't

01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:07.680
happy about that. Oh yeah. And you could play us on bill Clinton, who was president when that

01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:12.160
came out. And I believe some Republican equivalent was also in it, you know, like,

01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:16.880
so you could do political wars and things like that in NBA Jam. I don't think the NBA was happy

01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:22.240
about that at all. And that'll probably be in the documentary. Well, the thing is, is that the NBA

01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:27.920
almost never gave them the, you know, the, uh, license for it. Um, I mean, they couldn't get

01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:34.000
Michael Jordan. He wouldn't let midway use his name or likeness. Um, you know, the licensing

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:40.640
agreement, you know, basically the NBA had a really poor, uh, opinion of arcades in general.

01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:45.360
Um, but it turned out to be one of the most successful, uh, uh, video game franchises. I mean,

01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:49.840
there are how many different releases came out. Um, did I ever do this as a classic game? I don't

01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:54.240
think you did reference. You have to look at the Wiki, I guess, but, um, and it has an arcade one

01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:59.840
up cabinet. Yeah. Yep. Cause of course it does. So, but, but even so, I mean, what we're getting

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:04.960
all this kind of love and resurgence back. So I think it's a great time for a documentary about

01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:12.720
NBA Jam. Um, I mean, I have the Saturn copy of NBA Jam, the PlayStation ones. We have so many

01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:18.800
releases. The Saturn one was kind of the hard one to get ahold of. Um, uh, but I mean, it was,

01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:25.680
it was super, super fun. And then, you know, in a twist, the rumor is that, uh, Michael Jordan

01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:31.920
actually had a modded copy that put him in the game after all. Huh. Um, that's a rumor,

01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:40.000
you know, but Hey, you know, it's on fire. It's going to be, uh, going to be a, uh, a fun thing

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:45.360
to watch. I think I'm really, because I want to just, I want to see more about like those

01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:52.240
different builds of the game because I, I played early builds of this when I was in, uh, in high

01:48:52.240 --> 01:49:01.440
school, actually. Um, Zen monkey 11 and chat says the new NBA Jam is NBA 2k street too. You know,

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:07.040
I think that's not NBA Jam. Well, and, and I think they've tried to replicate the success of

01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:12.560
the original several times because there was an NBA Jam on the Wii or the 360. Like they tried

01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:19.200
to revive it. It was a 360. They've tried to do it several times and nothing really quite had the

01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:24.480
fire of the, literally of the first go around. Like that just wasn't the same. And yes,

01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:29.280
absolutely. NBA, the street, like I, again, I don't talk a lot about sports games, but I know

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:34.560
enough that those street games are to try to get that more arcade style magic. It's almost like

01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:40.240
Forza Horizon versus Forza Motorsport and how Horizon is the more kind of like arcade type

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:45.920
of game. It's, it's kind of like that with the NBA street and the NBA, but, uh, I, nothing is quite

01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:51.920
just put that magic in the bottle quite the same. So, but it's also in the eyes of whatever you

01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:56.560
like. I'm not saying they're a bad game either. If, uh, you know, it's, it's enough of the magic

01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:01.040
for you and you enjoy it with all the new bells and whistles and stuff go off. Those games are

01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:08.320
for you. So it's pretty cool. All right. Um, anyhow, let's move on to another story. I think

01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:16.240
Loki you're up. All right. So let's talk a little bit about, uh, more delays. This is not surprising,

01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:25.280
really. I mean, we're still aware that COVID is a thing. So when originally, um, Nintendo and

01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:30.960
Universal Studios Japan announced that they were going to be opening Super Nintendo World, uh, in

01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:37.920
Japan in February 4th, that's not really going to happen because of the state of emergency that it's

01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:45.600
been declared in Osaka. So now it's been delayed. They haven't announced a new date yet. They will

01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:53.120
once the state of emergency is lifted because of COVID-19. But I mean, this is, it's a pretty

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:57.600
common thing that we're hearing now with different delays, especially when we're talking about

01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:02.720
outdoor theme park. Yeah. I wonder if they won't delay the Olympics again. I know they kind of,

01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:07.120
the Olympic committee kind of put their foot down and said these Olympics are happening in 2021,

01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:13.360
COVID or not. I don't know if I believe it, but then again, by the time we get to June,

01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:18.400
you might think, I mean, they might be doing the Olympics in a audience free stadium and they'll

01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:23.040
make sure that it could be a very different looking Olympics. Um, and they'll make sure

01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:27.680
all the players got vaccinated or whatever, but, uh, it could be interesting. We'll see.

01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:32.480
So, I mean, these are still, I mean, I remember in the early days of the pandemic when we thought,

01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:35.840
it'll just be a couple of weeks. And then, you know, here we are.

01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:39.760
So I would like to point out, I did not think it would be a couple of weeks.

01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:44.320
Yeah. Well, I don't like you being right on this one.

01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:53.360
Well, me either. So, um, well, let's just fingers and toes crossed that maybe now we're getting

01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:59.360
some competent leadership coming in this week that yes, the car will, it's not going to be

01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:04.080
automatic. It's not going to be automatic. Well, my wedding anniversaries this week too,

01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:10.240
you might remember I got married the day before. Yeah. So our four year anniversaries this week,

01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:15.920
uh, uh, Tuesday actually. So yeah, kind of funny how that works. Um, but anyway, yeah, I mean,

01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:20.160
obviously the car is not going to turn around immediately, but at least hopefully we will be

01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:24.800
on a path. I mean, they're talking about, what was it like a hundred million vaccinations in a

01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:31.440
hundred days. Let's hope we'll see. All right. And thank you for the kind words in chat. Appreciate

01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:36.560
it. All right. Let's move on to one more story for you guys. And this has to do with the ESA,

01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:43.280
uh, which, you know, has, has had some issues in the past couple of years, but, uh, this one is,

01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:47.760
is pretty clear, especially with all the recent, you know, uh, things that are going on in the

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:53.200
political world. Uh, the ESA has halted political donations, and this is something that's kind of

01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:59.040
happened across the board because, um, what happened at the Capitol, uh, was, was not good.

01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:05.520
And I think that's about the simplest way I can put it. And it's having ramifications for a lot

01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:11.840
of people. And so the ESA, yes, our industry, the entertainment software association, the group that

01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:18.080
puts on E3, uh, they are stopping political donations due to what happened at the Capitol

01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:22.960
building and all of the fallout from that saying in a statement, given the events and actions that

01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:28.400
led to the violence at the U S Capitol, we are pausing contributions from the ESA PAC,

01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:35.120
as we reflect on the tragedy and our path forward. Uh, just so you know, the ESA has donated both to

01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:41.920
Democrats and Republicans since 2012, but it is interesting to note it's usually Republicans.

01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:47.520
The larger share has gone to that, but that also probably ties into who was leading the

01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:54.840
ESA for a long time. I do your own research and come to your own conclusions, I suppose. Um,

01:53:56.400 --> 01:54:03.280
so anyway, um, the ESA, by the way, has, uh, just because they have donated to some, uh,

01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:09.120
Republican folks before it doesn't mean that they have always, uh, embraced everything that, uh,

01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:15.920
soon to be former president has done. Uh, for example, the ESA in 2018, when our president

01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:21.520
decided to call Haiti and African nations, shithole countries, uh, the ESA came out and

01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:27.440
said that it was repulsive and that that backward thinking has no place in society.

01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:33.200
And that would be one of the cases where the ESA was absolutely correct. Uh, unfortunately they

01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:37.920
don't always get it right when it comes to things like how to run E3, but, uh, or the things they

01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:43.200
tweet, but you know, you, you take the little victories where you can, I suppose, or as Phoenix

01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:48.720
77 26 puts it so eloquent eloquently in chat, took those fuckboys long enough.

01:54:54.240 --> 01:55:00.160
That's why we have a live chat room. All right, let's go to our listener round table,

01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:06.640
uh, where you guys can send us emails, participate at orange lounge, radio.com,

01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:11.120
or if you want to ask us some questions, don't ask about fuckboys though. If you want to ask us

01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:16.640
questions, uh, or what have you in chat twitch.tv slash vog networks, the place to do it. Uh, let's

01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:21.520
see, do we, do we have any emails tonight? Nope. So it's drag race talking. So I haven't watched

01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:26.560
any of it this season yet. Um, if, Oh, that's where I can talk about drag race again. Okay.

01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:30.080
So since you didn't send emails, we get a little bit of drag race talk and all I will say is that

01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:36.160
okay. I'm not going to, I w we don't do spoilers here, but I will say you need to watch this most

01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:43.280
recent episode and understand why we all stand to Misha Iman. We stand her there. That is the

01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:48.160
only option period because, and I didn't know this until just this past week. Okay. So everybody

01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:57.360
knows, and I don't, I don't care if you're gay, straight, bi, pan, eh, any of it, you know,

01:55:57.360 --> 01:56:03.760
that video of the best drag queen entrance of all time, right? Uh, where the it's holding out for

01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:09.360
a hero and the drag queen falls from the ceiling into the splits. Y'all know that, right? Yeah.

01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:13.680
Right. Everybody knows that one. And, uh, her name was Tandy Iman Dupree, I think was her name.

01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:20.480
I'm so sorry if I'm getting it wrong. Um, that is Tamisha Iman's daughter, drag daughter, basically.

01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:25.440
Uh, she passed away. If you didn't know that the drag queen in that epic video passed away,

01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:30.800
um, a few years ago. Uh, but it's her drag mom is on drag race right now. And she is

01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:36.560
all the royalty you would expect her to be. So there's some, yeah, there's some very standable

01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:42.800
people on drag race right now. So there's that. All right. Participate at orangesontrader.com.

01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:47.120
If you have some emails, um, or I guess you want to email us about drag race. I don't know.

01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:51.760
All right. Uh, and I'm looking in chat for questions. We don't have a lot right now,

01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:56.160
but, um, in absence of that, I will ask Loki if we have any last minute stories.

01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:03.040
Um, there's one thing, so I was going to mention, there's a free game you can check out on steam

01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:10.720
called six seasons in a game. It is basically a paint ball recreation of Greendale community

01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:16.240
college from community. And you can play that and play paint ball in there. Perfect. Just like in

01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:22.800
the show. So yeah, six seasons in a game, free on steam, uh, dark to see in chat coming up with a

01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:28.080
question since drag race came up, came up. Has anyone seen AJ and the queen on Netflix?

01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:34.480
Bonus bit of trivia. Roo's roommate apparently plays a prominent role in cyberpunk 2077. Roo

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:40.720
has a husband, not a roommate. He's in cyberpunk. What do they do? They fracking? Well, I don't

01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:48.480
know. Anyway. Um, Oh, Oh, Oh, in the show. That's right. Roo did have it. You're right. Okay. Sorry.

01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:54.800
I was thinking IRL Roo's roommate in the show. Yes. Um, was like, uh, I remember I did see a

01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:58.720
couple episodes of the show, but it was kinda, it was kinda bad. Sorry. It was kinda, it's,

01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:05.360
it's like guilty pleasures. It's a guilty pleasure TV, I guess. So, okay. Okay. So the roommate in

01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:12.320
the show is in cyberpunk. That makes a lot of sense. So, all right. Uh, Loki, any more last

01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:21.280
minute stories? Um, no, that's pretty much it is important things. All right. Well, I guess we're,

01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:25.040
we're a little early, but we're at the end of the show. We don't have a lot else to talk about.

01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:30.000
January is still a slow month. What can you do? Um, thank you guys so much for listening to our

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:33.680
show tonight. Uh, we appreciate you guys participating along with our show, whether you

01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:37.040
were here with us live on Sunday night, or you were listening throughout the week on our podcast

01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:43.520
feed available where great podcasts are found such as Spotify, iTunes, and so forth. Um, you

01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:48.240
can leave us a nice review wherever you found this show. We really appreciate those. Or, uh,

01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:53.120
just tell us, tell a friend or two about the show. Um, word of mouth is the best thing we have to

01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:58.240
spread word of the show. So those of you that have spread the word by telling your friends,

01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:03.280
we really appreciate that. Um, those of you that do auto hosts a VoG network on your Twitch

01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:09.120
accounts, we really appreciate that as well. Um, so yeah, any, all of that stuff we, we super,

01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:15.280
super appreciate. Um, and, um, let's see what else. Oh yes. The shop. Uh, if you want to,

01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:19.760
uh, help us out, uh, in the monetary sense, you don't have to, but it does go a long way and you

01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:25.440
can get some merchandise, vognetwork.com slash shop. If you want to get an OLR t-shirt such

01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:30.880
as the one that Loki's wearing tonight or a VoG network shirt or an OLR sticker or a Bobby mug and,

01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:34.400
and more to come throughout this year, we'll be adding some more merch to that shop,

01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:39.760
vognetwork.com slash shop. All right. I was going to close off the questions,

01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:43.520
but since we're a little early, I'll let one more sneak in here after the buzzer,

01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:49.680
especially because he paid to highlight it. DJ Rama S says, uh, what are y'all's guilty pleasure

01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:56.160
video games? Guilty pleasure games. See, I would consider Final Fantasy 14 one of them,

01:59:56.160 --> 02:00:00.560
even though I think that is a good game. That is like a game I keep going back to,

02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:07.200
um, no matter what a guilty pleasure game. Earth Defense Force. I don't feel guilty about

02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:14.800
anything I play. I mean, I'm playing all, I'm playing all of my, all of my things that I enjoy

02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:22.080
playing. You know, I've got patterned. I have my stupid word game. Wardscapes. I just started

02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:28.400
playing that too. I love it. I'm so good at it. That's that. That's the one where you swipe the

02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:34.240
letters as in a crossword puzzle. I just got into that this week. I would, I would live for that

02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:37.440
playing words with friends too, to the point as like, I'm actually really bored with boards

02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:43.760
with friends too. I only like doing those puzzles. And so I've played, I played completely through

02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:51.280
a whole other game just like this. I beat, I beat it. And now I'm on, what am I on for this game?

02:00:51.280 --> 02:01:00.160
I'm on level, uh, 1,841 and I just made a 20th place in the current tournament.

02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:05.840
So good for you. Yeah. I'm also, I'm also 20th place, but I think it breaks,

02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:10.320
breaks you into groups of a hundred or something like that. Yeah, I think it does. Yeah. So,

02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:14.880
I mean, but I really, I really enjoy, enjoy this game. I wonder how many levels it has

02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:20.320
before I'm done with it, but it was enough that I paid to get no ads. Oh, okay. Nice.

02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:25.280
Yeah. I would say a lot of those cell phone games end up being my guilty pleasure games,

02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:31.600
you know, cause you know, cell phone gaming isn't real gaming, but it is. Um, and so there's,

02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:35.520
there's a lot of, I would say a lot of that stuff falls into the guilty pleasure category for sure,

02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:42.720
for me. Um, those word games, uh, thanks to the, um, uh, reality game I was talking about on last

02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:46.640
week's show, they got me into a game called stacked or something like that. That's really

02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:51.600
addicting. And it's just a very simple, stupid game. Uh, playing that a lot. So yeah, a lot,

02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:57.280
pretty much anything on my phone is a guilty pleasure game. Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says P cross.

02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:04.720
That's a good one too. I may throw out, um, uh, maybe hot to full boyfriend just because I fucking

02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:10.240
love that game. I love how to full boyfriend. Sometimes the game is so ridiculous. It's still

02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:17.520
pretty good. Yeah. Well, I mean, and it goes there. It goes dark. So yeah, I would say mortal

02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:22.960
combat is in that category. I'm not as big on the newer ones, but the older ones to me are kind of

02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:28.320
guilty pleasure games like mortal combat two specifically, I think is a guilty pleasure game

02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:33.600
for me. There you go. Rama. See, don't say I don't love you. I let you squeeze in the last minute

02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:37.760
question there. All right. Uh, now we're going to go through the motions of wrapping everything up.

02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:41.600
Thank you again for listening to the show. I won't repeat everything I said before. Um,

02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:45.600
but, uh, thank you again to everybody who's listening, whether it be, uh, live or on the

02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:50.720
podcast feed, we really appreciate your support. Um, we'll be here next week to do it all over

02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:58.240
again. Um, I hope everybody has a great week, happy gaming, um, and, uh, stay safe, stay, uh,

02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:02.960
far away from any place where you could potentially catch COVID and maybe we will get to the other

02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:07.520
side of this after all. Um, so let's go around and get final thoughts. Uh, Loki,

02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:12.160
I'm gonna start with you at your final thought tonight. Um, just have to work more of my games

02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:19.600
and also, uh, still want to stream some more Minecraft. Yeah. Uh, and my final thought is

02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:24.800
I will really push myself to do a stream this week. That is not final fantasy. I'll probably

02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:29.840
stream that too, but I want to do like DJ max. I keep saying I want to do a Tetris effect stream.

02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:34.320
Now that we're getting these pixel poops codes, I'm asking why, why are, can we stream this or

02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:39.840
do you want me to wait? So I'm hoping to stream something, uh, this week that isn't just final

02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:47.120
fantasy. So there's that last but not least dark soccer. Um, please look at the pinned post on my,

02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:54.160
uh, Twitter it's at dark Sakura. Um, I have a go fund me for a long time friend of the show and one

02:03:54.160 --> 02:04:01.200
of my longtime friends. Um, and the only person who has donated since I put out that call is

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:06.960
someone who doesn't even listen to the show. So anything, if you want me to pick a game

02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:14.720
and I'm going to extend this, you know, another, another week for, for donations, but, um, $10

02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:24.400
as a vote, $50 gets you, uh, uh, I'm going to put it this way. Uh, if you do, uh, $10 is a vote,

02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:31.120
$50 would be a hundred votes and $500 will be an instant game choice as long as I own it.

02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:39.360
So, um, I'll, I'll put it in the chat room and, um, but it's, it's in one of the pinned,

02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:46.400
uh, post on my, on my wall. All right. Well, with that, we hope you guys all have a good week.

02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:52.240
We will see you in seven days to talk about more gaming. Stay safe. Have a good one. Good night.
