0	13480	My Gaming Spheres never included Katy Perry, yet I recently learned that she recorded
13480	16940	at least one of her songs in Simlish, the Sims language from The Sims, and this week
16940	20500	Ms. Perry is signed on to be part of Pokemon's 25th anniversary.
20500	24200	When I think of musicians significantly in gaming, I think about EDM mainstays, Marshmallow,
24200	27380	Cascade, and all the other hypesters, but Ms. Perry is absolutely more appropriate and
27380	28880	approachable for the Pokeverse.
28880	32040	This is just my bubble of news and memory, it's now time for your hosts Rob Roberts,
32040	35120	Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news,
35120	37640	starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.
37640	44120	Hello my friends, out there on the internet, welcome back, it's another week of the show
44120	52080	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio Live, once again, January the 17th of
52080	58000	2021, with episode number 852 of our show.
58120	64840	I am Rob Roberts joining you here in our studio where we always gathered every week to talk
64840	70040	live about the latest and greatest in video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.
70040	73880	Obviously for obvious reasons, I don't need to detail right now, for the last nine months
73880	78200	we've been doing our show in a virtual format, so joining me via the magic of Discord, say
78200	80760	hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
80760	81760	Hello.
81760	83760	Hi, how are you?
83760	86720	I'm a little frustrated, but okay.
86760	90960	Well, for what it's worth, you sound great right now, so don't change a thing.
90960	96160	Well, honestly, I need a wrench to tighten up this one little bolt on here.
96160	100760	I've been figuring what's going on with my mic is that there's some loose bits on my
100760	107400	arm, and so if I put it in just the right way, it starts drooping down because gravity
107400	108400	always wins.
108400	112680	Y'all were missing Dark Sakura before the show playing with power tools, or actually
112680	114280	I did a, for those that-
114280	115280	What do you mean?
115280	116280	It's a screwdriver.
116840	121360	Well, you got to put some power in that tool, but that's right.
121360	122360	How about the gun show?
122360	123680	There we go.
123680	128760	But so part of the joy of doing this show live, and I put joy in quotes, because we
128760	134160	do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern ish, right after
134160	140120	the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG network.
140120	145000	And the joy of being here for the live stuff is that sometimes we screw up and you get
145000	146040	to see it live.
146800	150600	So tonight I had a false start where I actually, so you know, I'm sure many of you have used
150600	155200	Open Broadcaster Studio, just like we do, and you know the magic of scenes, and sometimes
155200	158300	you might click on the wrong scene or push the wrong button.
158300	161880	And that's what happened tonight is that it played the little pre-show, did the little
161880	166120	bumper, it says VOG network, then it went right to us and Jamie's sitting there trying
166120	171560	to get the microphone going, and I'm like, oops, I hit the wrong button.
171560	172560	Take two.
173560	178160	I mean, I certainly don't mind showing the stuff that happens behind the scenes to the,
178160	180560	you know, 25 people watching right now.
180560	182480	It's it's whatever.
182480	183480	Screw ups happen.
183480	184480	It's whatever.
184480	186840	Anyway, say hello to somebody.
186840	190280	No, say hello to somebody who never screws up.
190280	191880	It's Techmaster Loki.
191880	193280	I do all the time.
193280	195360	I don't know what you're talking about.
195360	196360	OK, that's true.
196360	197360	No, I'm kidding.
197360	198360	How are you?
198360	199720	Ah, my head hurts.
199720	201720	Other than that, I'm good.
201880	208460	So the chatters have correctly called out, I believe, that you've got Scott Pilgrim.
208460	210640	Is that the new one or the old one playing behind you?
210640	213960	I mean, I know it's the same thing, but the remaster is the same.
213960	215680	Well, one's remastered, so it looks a little.
215680	217120	I was watching.
217120	222640	So our pal Ranma from Anime Jam Session was playing on Saturday night, Friday night.
222640	223640	I don't remember.
223640	224640	It was some point.
224640	228480	And I was watching for a few minutes and I did kind of go, oh, this looks a lot cleaner.
228480	229480	Like it's a lot crisper.
229480	231040	He really just comes through.
231040	232040	I think.
232040	233040	Yeah, it's the old one.
233040	234040	OK.
234040	236280	But still, it's close enough, right?
236280	237280	Close enough.
237280	238280	Yeah, it's fine.
238280	240560	I was too late to get the new one.
240560	242300	Have you seen that meme going around?
242300	246580	And Dark Soccer, you can appreciate this one, too, about how nobody watched Scott Pilgrim
246580	247880	for Scott.
247880	250140	And it's always like all these supporting characters.
250140	256080	And if you think about it, like that movie, which I think is only aged better as like
256080	259160	that's one of those movies you look back and is going to really define.
259160	264400	I think that period of time, just like like people look fondly back on 80s movies like
264400	267800	Ferris Bueller's Day Off and some of that, like I think Scott Pilgrim's one of those movies
267800	273360	that kind of represents the arts or whatever you want to call it, like really well.
273360	278040	But I had such some people like Empire Records is one I think that's more 90s.
278040	279280	But yes, I would.
279280	281400	That is definitely one of those movies, for sure.
281400	284560	But like well, and Tiger Claw and Chat says, actually, you know, you're right.
284560	288340	I was thinking of I don't know, I'm stuck in the 90s right now.
288340	293820	Me every day, Tiger Claw and Chat says probably just for Brie Larson, in part, but it's not
293820	294820	just her.
294820	295820	What?
295820	296820	Aubrey Plaza.
296820	298060	Aubrey Plaza's in it.
298060	300780	Anna Kendrick's in it.
300780	304420	The Superman guy in it, whose name I can't remember in the moment.
304420	305420	Chris Evans?
305420	306980	No, he's in it too.
306980	308980	He's Captain America.
308980	309980	He's in it, too.
309980	311540	Brandon Routh.
311540	312540	That's it.
312540	313540	He's in it, too.
313540	315140	They're all in it.
315140	319540	So it's it's it's got like such a huge, strong supporting cast.
319540	323180	And yeah, I love I think that's one of those movies that just gets better the older it
323180	324180	gets.
324180	329020	And I did I did a cult movie screening of it a couple of years ago, whenever the 10th
329020	330100	anniversary was.
330100	331580	And that was a really fun show.
331580	334140	I really want to host that again.
334140	336060	And maybe they'll pair it with Kung Fury again.
336060	337060	I don't know.
337060	338300	Or we'll do Kung Fury was great.
338300	339300	We'll do it.
339300	340300	That was the double feature.
340300	341300	And it was a great double feature.
341300	343620	But or maybe we'll Kung Fury has a great soundtrack.
343620	345220	We'll pair it with the game.
345220	348660	We'll have somebody play through the game live and then watch the movie.
348660	349660	Who knows?
349660	350660	Anything?
350660	351660	Anything?
351660	357120	Going in to chat Bobby Blackwell says the scientist in Picard was in it really see.
357120	363300	It's all these people that ended up like that that movie jump started their careers seriously.
363300	366420	And it's so quotable and has all the all the gifts from it.
366420	371180	I think it was just Dark Sakura literally in a text message the other day.
371180	376500	Cred makes you fat like that was literally a thing that we were talking about the other
376500	377500	day.
377500	378500	Yeah.
378500	379500	Anyway, love it.
379500	380500	All right.
380500	381900	I love that movie.
381900	383180	Me too.
383180	387580	Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, which is about Nintendo and some of the things
387580	389540	that they are continuing to do legally.
389540	392800	Loki, you want to talk about this for us because you probably been following this a little
392800	394060	better than I have.
394060	395060	Yeah.
395060	400380	So there was a channel stack smashing who he does a lot of like different like kind
400380	404620	of console hacking and whatnot, just for the fun of it, I guess.
404620	406220	Oh, so he was sorry.
406220	410340	Quick shout out to our discord over at vog network dot com slash discord, because that's
410340	412040	where I first heard about this.
412040	413940	So this story actually kind of came from there this week.
413940	415580	So vog network dot com slash discord.
415580	418000	I don't shout that out enough at the top of the show.
418000	420300	So I got my quota in for the week.
420300	421300	Sorry, Loki.
421300	422300	Yeah.
422300	424860	Well, we talked about like this guy before he was the one that put out the YouTube videos
424860	433580	on hacking the Game & Watch to actually put different custom ROMs on there and different
433580	434580	mods.
434580	439220	So this was the same guy that was kind of showing that progress along the way.
439220	443020	And of course, because it's something that Nintendo didn't like, they went ahead and
443020	452540	did a copyright strike against it, claiming that he is violating their copyright by putting
452540	458740	this educational video about how to reverse engineer the Game & Watch, which in tech,
458740	461260	I think that completely falls into fair use.
461260	462260	But, you know, it's a Nintendo.
462260	464140	And what what are you going to do soon?
464140	465140	Nintendo?
465140	466140	Are you going to fight against them?
466140	467780	I mean, there's nothing you can do.
467780	470420	So he asked Katari about that one.
470420	471420	Yeah.
471420	477300	He's basically put out he's re-uploaded the videos and blurred out the stuff that has
477300	480580	Nintendo's IP in it.
480580	482500	But it's still really stupid.
482500	488140	He has filed a counterclaim, but he doesn't think that it's going to get dropped, that
488140	492700	they're just going to leave it as a copyright strike because they don't like people hacking
492700	494700	their stuff.
494700	499460	Actually, Dark Sakura, I didn't even think about that comparison, but you really hit
499460	503560	can you elaborate on your joke a little bit for those that may not get it?
503560	505300	So you said ask Katari about that one.
505300	506300	Can you elaborate on that?
506300	510620	Because I actually think you you've struck a really interesting parallel here.
510620	519660	Well, there was just the business that led to Tengen, you know, becoming a thing is that
519660	525820	Tengen had people reverse engineer part of Nintendo's hardware.
525820	533060	And granted, it was under some false pretenses, but it was going back and forth on did they
533060	535820	you know, what did they do with how did they obtain it?
535820	536820	What did they get?
536820	544460	You know what, who has a license to release games on on third party cartridges, you know,
544460	553060	without the Nintendo seal of format cartridges for all of that, you know, had to do with
553060	559220	bypassing Nintendo's chip that's in the logic board of the system.
559220	565600	So that was a big back and forth and it did not work out all that great for Atari, really.
565600	571040	Well, they they still got the ability to sell those cartridges, but the Tetris thing
571040	573440	ended up but that was kind of a separate issue.
573440	575380	The Tetris thing was a completely different issue.
575380	580200	And in the end, what I'm saying is about what how it worked out for Atari in the end.
580200	581520	Who are we left with?
581520	582520	We have Nintendo.
582520	583520	Fair.
583520	585000	Atari is is an IP.
585000	586000	Fair.
586000	587000	No.
587000	588000	And you know what, though?
588000	591360	But those the and for those that might remember back in the day, those Tengen cartridges were
591360	592400	shaped differently.
592400	596960	They were different cartridges because Nintendo had a patent on their cartridge.
596960	601640	Atari through Tengen essentially reverse engineered how to make a Nintendo game work on the Nintendo
601640	603840	and came up with their own and their false pretenses.
603840	604840	Yes.
604840	605840	Yes.
605840	606840	And came up with their own cartridge.
606840	610640	But at the end of the day, they won that lawsuit that allowed them to continue selling the
610640	617560	cartridges because they were allowed to basically illegally, even though it was reverse engineered,
617560	618720	it was a little bit shady.
618720	619720	They did lose.
619720	621440	They had to pay a lot for the reverse engineering.
621480	622480	Yeah.
622480	625000	And they did lose some other things when it came to like Tetris.
625000	629000	But that was a completely different issue is that the license for the arcade, which
629000	633760	our Atari had, and the license for home gaming, which Nintendo had, ended up having to be
633760	634960	proved to be a different thing.
634960	639520	Atari did not have the ability to put Tetris out for console.
639520	643360	There's just because I thought there was a lot more that there's a lot more going on
643360	645160	to the Tetris debacle than just that.
645160	646160	Yes.
646160	649680	But to to simplify it into a three hour show, I think I hit on the big points.
649680	650680	But you're right.
650920	653120	Yes, it does go deeper than that.
653120	657960	And Bobby Black Wolf in our chat over at twitch.tv slash Vogue Network points out a couple other
657960	659960	parallels here.
659960	662440	Universal sued over Donkey Kong and lost.
662440	665440	So Nintendo's Galoob wasn't there wins and losses in court.
665440	669600	And yes, it follows it right up with Galoob and the Sega Genesis.
669600	670600	Yep.
670600	676320	So it's because they have reverse engineered because Sega wanted money, a certain percentage
676320	679300	for their to be able to publish on their system.
679420	682900	And so they just reverse engineer and create all their tools so they wouldn't have to pay
682900	683900	that.
683900	688660	It's it's it's a total EA thing, but they did that as well.
688660	695060	And it's I wanted to kind of conclude my Tengen tangent tangent tangent.
695060	696900	That's an interesting little thing.
696900	700500	But with what Dark Soccer was saying about it didn't work out very well for Atari in
700500	706580	the end is that those cartridges didn't really end up having great sales.
706580	710780	And then there were other not like Color Dreams was one company that came in and started
710780	711780	making cartridges.
711780	714460	Other companies started coming in and making bootleg cartridges, his Bible company.
714460	718580	And the Bible companies did to excuse me.
718580	719580	And you know what?
719580	722780	They all had a reputation for being shitty games.
722780	726760	Like name one of those games that was good.
726760	728900	Tetris was good.
728900	730960	Klax was pretty good, actually.
730960	736020	But like most of the and not even just taking it like the other the others from the Color
736020	738060	Dreams in the Bible, none of them were good.
738060	742460	So an interesting thing is that Nintendo and this kind of worked out in Nintendo's favor
742460	748160	is that all all those games like you knew if it wasn't in an actual Nintendo cartridge,
748160	750900	it was probably going to be a shit game.
750900	754860	And so Nintendo kind of won on the intellectual side with that a little bit.
754860	756980	It's kind of fascinating how that worked out.
756980	760220	And you know, again, this is a tangent fantasy zone.
760220	762820	Oh, I forgot they did that one.
762820	763820	That's right.
763820	766900	The Sega crossovers that Tengen did.
766900	767900	That's right.
767900	768900	OK.
768900	771340	And the color palettes in the two of them were a little bit different.
771340	772340	I mean.
772340	773340	Oh, hi, Dan.
773340	777780	My husband's bringing me my soda.
777780	778780	I have priorities.
778780	779780	Be right back.
779780	780780	It's fine.
780780	781780	OK.
781780	782780	Anyway.
782780	783780	All right.
783780	784780	So.
784780	785780	So anyway.
785780	787500	But I think the point is with this whole like aside is that, you know, Nintendo has
787500	793780	tried to assert some of their you know, you can't hack this whole thing and all this.
793780	796220	And they've lost before on this.
796220	800760	So it is interesting and kind of going back to what Loki was saying, it is interesting
800760	805900	that you have a guy on YouTube that's putting all this together, but kind of is in a situation
805900	809260	where he can't like legally he isn't Atari.
809260	813620	He doesn't have the power to go up against Nintendo, even if he believes that what he's
813620	815020	doing is fair use.
815020	822740	I kind of like I get Nintendo's logic and I get why Nintendo legal is doing this, because
822740	825520	they obviously don't want that instruction out there.
825520	827020	It's not great for them.
827020	829100	It doesn't do anything, though.
829100	830100	It's not hurting anything.
830100	835900	It's not like it's not like breaking it open, like say the NES mini or something like that.
835900	838140	There's no flash storage on there.
838140	839140	Right.
839140	842360	There's enough room for like a ROM one.
842360	844220	You can't really do much with it.
844220	848380	I mean, they're saying that there's maybe modifications that they can do to replace
848380	853420	that chip with a larger chip, but it's pretty much just for funsies.
853420	854660	It's not really doing anything.
854660	856100	It's not going to hurt their bottom line.
856100	862140	If anything, it causes people to want that even more and maybe up the sales there.
862140	866020	And well, you know, and I think ultimately what happens to Nintendo here, and I think
866020	871780	this is one of the most overused phrases from armchair critics on the Internet, but it really
871780	872940	does apply here.
872940	878020	It's that whole Streisand effect thing, which, you know, if you've ever heard about.
878020	882740	Well, not that Streisand effect, but the whole the pictures of her house and like she
882740	887020	sued to get those pictures, and then that the picture ended up everywhere of her house.
887020	891580	It was like if she hadn't called legal attention to it, it probably never would have really
891580	893020	been picked up.
893020	899780	And like Anne Rice suing fan fiction writers that or that, too, I suppose, even though
899780	903100	my mind goes to Fifty Shades of Grey, even though, of course, that's not an Anne Rice
903100	906620	thing, but a fan fiction that got way bigger than it needed to be.
906620	910220	Yeah, but Anne Rice was suing people writing fan fiction of her work.
910220	911220	True.
911220	916020	So but but my point is and why I invoke that over invoked phrase of the Streisand effect
916020	921060	is I kind of think what happens here is that now, like all these, you know, podcasts, news
921060	925620	organizations and so forth that get blogs that are talking about this story are just
925620	930460	calling a light on to, hey, if you want to hack your game and watch, Nintendo doesn't
930460	934860	want you to see it, which makes people want to trade it even more.
934900	938700	So I I almost feel like it's going to have the reverse effect.
938700	939780	Would you agree with that, Loki?
941300	942820	Yeah, I just don't understand.
942820	946740	I mean, I get what they're trying to do, but I don't think it's going to necessarily work.
946740	953100	And honestly, it feels like a misuse of their copyright claim system, because, you know,
953100	957420	if you say something nice about the game and watch, they're not taking your video down.
957420	963580	But if you say something critical or talk about this in an educational way, well, they're
963580	964580	going to take the video down.
965460	971700	OK, I will agree with you to a point, but like educational like that's that's the word
971700	973620	we use to scapegoat the real meaning.
973620	975300	Like, let's just call it what it is.
975300	976420	What laws are they breaking?
976420	979220	There's no laws against reverse engineering hardware there.
979220	979860	They're there.
979860	981220	You own everything.
981220	984980	It's not like you're they're saying, well, if you do this, they'll allow you to pirate
984980	985700	all these games.
985700	986900	It is nothing.
986900	988900	It's modifying your own hardware.
988900	991540	I don't disagree with that, but let's call it what it is.
991700	994980	You don't own your own the devices that you buy from them.
995700	998580	No, I it's it's the same thing about like
999860	1004660	hacking phones, hacking portable watches to play Doom on.
1004660	1005620	It's all that stuff.
1005620	1006900	It's the same thing.
1006900	1011860	But Nintendo just doesn't like it because it's how to load a ROM, which they they really
1011860	1015460	don't like, because because here's the gag, everyone.
1015460	1018500	This is why it's such a big deal, why Nintendo shutting it down.
1018500	1024420	Nintendo absolutely wants to do more of these with other games from their archive.
1025140	1025860	Duh.
1025860	1029860	That's why they're shutting it down, because they plan to release plenty more of these
1029860	1031140	this coming holiday.
1031140	1032900	Absolutely, absolutely.
1032900	1037140	And they don't want you to make your own, basically.
1037140	1042020	So but all I'm saying is that call it what it's educating how to side load a ROM like
1042020	1043700	that's that's what it is.
1043700	1049460	But I again, I feel like the people that really want to do that are going to do it without
1049460	1050180	YouTube's help.
1050820	1057220	And now all these people now know that didn't know before that you can side load and hack
1057220	1059060	a game and watch if you didn't know that before.
1059860	1060180	All right.
1060820	1063940	Yeah, I just think it's it's not going to make any difference.
1064820	1068580	I'm going to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network.
1069140	1074100	Phoenix 7726 says they could not stop any modern system from being hacked and this won't
1074100	1074900	work either.
1074900	1078740	They're wasting time and money fighting a battle whose best outcome is Pyrrhic.
1079940	1080340	Pyrrhic.
1080340	1080740	Excuse me.
1081300	1084580	And Tigerclaws says, imagine a Legend of Zelda game and watch.
1085540	1086100	Of course.
1086820	1087620	Why wouldn't they?
1089700	1092580	And then Bobby Black Wolf says, you don't have to imagine it.
1092580	1095380	You can do it now, thanks to educational videos.
1096900	1097940	If you can find them.
1097940	1105940	Yes, but maybe maybe the word education works in the sense that even if they take the video
1105940	1107780	down, there will always be a textbook.
1108740	1115940	Like, I don't know if y'all know, but even if they were to shut down Facebook, Twitter,
1116820	1119700	whatever social media companies, they all shut down everything.
1120340	1122740	You could still email like you used to.
1122740	1125860	You could pick up the phone and call somebody like you used to.
1125860	1130180	Like, there's still all these other ways to get information out there.
1130900	1133540	Anyway, let's just go back to LiveJournal.
1133540	1134580	Yeah, right.
1135460	1136180	No, actually, no.
1136180	1137620	LiveJournal got sold.
1137620	1138980	It's all about dead journal.
1140660	1141220	Dead journal.
1142740	1144100	Dark Sakura had a dead journal.
1144100	1145620	I know that you're muted, by the way.
1146740	1147700	You muted Dark Sakura.
1150580	1152340	I have a permanent LiveJournal.
1152340	1152980	Oh, me too.
1152980	1153540	Yeah, me too.
1153860	1159620	And I'm kind of tempted to go back and use it because I kind of kind of sick of stuff.
1159620	1160900	There's things about it that I miss.
1161780	1163140	I met my husband on LiveJournal.
1163140	1164820	I've said that a million times on this show.
1164820	1167700	Like, I met Extifer, who I've done shows with.
1167700	1168740	I met on LiveJournal.
1168740	1169620	My other old roommate.
1169620	1170740	I'm at a live with him.
1170740	1173940	I've I've met lots of people because of LiveJournal.
1173940	1175300	Kind of you guys in a way.
1175940	1181300	Like, I mean, it's more DDR freak, but I still think we all kind of like kept in touch better
1181300	1183300	because of something like LiveJournal.
1183700	1187140	I think that's the story about a lot of my friendships that I formed around that era.
1187140	1191300	You know, people like you guys, people like Shane, people like, you know, other guests
1191300	1197540	you've seen on this show before is that like we may not have like met, but we got to be
1197540	1202980	closer because of LiveJournal and, you know, reading each other's stuff when it wasn't
1202980	1205620	about like shocking links and things like that.
1205620	1209300	Phoenix 7726 is suggesting we could go back to Friendster.
1209300	1211060	Is that even still around anymore?
1211060	1211460	Is that it?
1211460	1211700	Yeah.
1211700	1212980	Is that still around?
1212980	1219700	I know it was huge in like certain parts of Asia for a while, like long after Facebook.
1219700	1220980	There's no line.
1220980	1222900	Yeah, he's lying.
1223460	1228260	SSG100 Matt is saying they also got burned by the folks using our three cards in the
1228260	1228900	past.
1228900	1231380	So this is just them getting ahead of the modding stuff.
1231380	1234180	Well, this is this isn't even that's completely different.
1234180	1235060	It is different.
1235060	1235460	Yeah.
1235460	1237140	You don't you don't need anything else.
1237140	1238660	That's the key thing, right?
1238660	1238900	Yeah.
1238900	1239060	Yeah.
1239060	1242660	This is like it's so limited in scope what you can do with this.
1243540	1248580	I would say like the R3 stuff that's similar to what you have with like the mini systems.
1250260	1251460	This is nothing like it.
1251460	1258180	You can literally you have to have like probes and special equipment to be able to actually
1258180	1260660	dump and put ROMs on there.
1260660	1262820	It's such an arduous process to do it.
1264820	1268980	That's like not even really worth it for most people to do it other than just a tinker with
1268980	1269700	something.
1269700	1273060	It's just I don't understand why they would even bother with this.
1273060	1275700	It's just it's such a ridiculous thing.
1275700	1277700	Like I don't know.
1277700	1282660	I don't see them cracking down on the NES mini hacking and the SNES mini hacking.
1282660	1284900	I mean, those videos are all over the place.
1284900	1286900	Like why this?
1286900	1287700	I don't know.
1287700	1288340	It's silly.
1289060	1290180	Zelda Game and Watch.
1290180	1291380	Yeah, Zelda Game and Watch.
1291380	1291700	That's why.
1291700	1294740	But even still, like even if they put it out, it's still going to sell like crazy.
1294740	1296260	This will literally affect nothing.
1297220	1301700	Phoenix 7726 says this very tongue in cheek.
1301700	1304020	OLRBBS at Rob Roberts.
1304020	1311860	Dude, BBS is like if you want to know why I'm so screwed up, that's because I was on
1311860	1321940	BBS's nonstop from like the age of fuck, probably like 12 years old until I remember being on
1321940	1325380	a BBS and people were trying to get me to go see Rocky Horror Picture Show.
1325380	1326740	This was long before I was supposed to.
1326740	1328340	I was like 13 years old.
1330340	1333060	But people didn't know that because it was a BBS.
1333060	1334180	Couldn't see people.
1334180	1338900	I was on BBS's from the time I was like 12 years old until probably well into high school,
1338900	1340020	probably 17 or 18.
1340020	1343940	Whenever Prodigy, no, Prodigy was kind of in the middle of that.
1343940	1345060	But you guys know what I mean.
1345060	1352420	Like, haven't I joked on this show before we ought to have a VOG network BBS so we can
1352420	1356500	still play The Pit and Legend of the Dragon, Legend of the Drag Queens.
1359220	1363540	Sorry to play Legend of the Dragon, Legend of the Red Dragon.
1366020	1372820	And yes, I would play Legend of the Dragons and Trade Wars 2002, which is which that year
1372820	1374260	is long past trade wars.
1374260	1374900	Huh, Rob?
1374900	1375540	Trade.
1375540	1376020	Do you remember?
1376020	1377380	Do you remember Trade Wars?
1377380	1379140	It was like I didn't do BBS's.
1379140	1381460	Oh, you got a I was not.
1381460	1383140	I was not one of one of them.
1383140	1384740	I was an AOL kid.
1384740	1385540	OK, OK.
1386660	1387220	I did.
1387220	1389220	I did BBS's for a while.
1390100	1391140	It was kind of just.
1392500	1397140	You know, there wasn't really Internet access, and then eventually there was a local BBS
1397140	1399780	that actually allowed you to connect to the Internet.
1399780	1404260	So you connect through the BBS and then you'd be able to launch a Web browser somehow to
1404260	1405540	be able to connect to the Internet.
1405540	1407220	And so I was all over that.
1407220	1413140	And then that was that was back when then net zero was a thing for a while.
1413140	1416820	And then I was on that forever because it's free.
1417460	1420420	And then I don't remember.
1420420	1422820	Eventually we got high speed Internet somehow.
1422820	1424340	So like, I don't know.
1424340	1427460	That wasn't until I think that wasn't until I moved in with Rob.
1427460	1428980	We got high speed Internet.
1428980	1434340	BBS was the beginning of the end was when they all got email and you could start getting
1434340	1436180	email on your BBS account.
1436180	1439380	And it was kind of like that was when they all started to kind of start to merge into
1439380	1439620	one.
1439620	1442100	And it's like the Internet was kind of like born from that.
1442980	1445380	For me, it was a lot of prodigy back in the day.
1445380	1448020	I used to post on the bulletin boards and prodigy like all the time.
1448020	1448900	And yeah, that was.
1449780	1452420	Yeah, AOL chat rooms are fun.
1452420	1456340	And like even just with like games and stuff like that, we're able to get stuff.
1458660	1459940	Yeah, fun times.
1459940	1460340	All right.
1460340	1464260	Internet enough reflection from the old folks home on BBS.
1464260	1465860	Thanks for that derailment chat.
1466420	1467940	All right.
1467940	1470580	Let's get into let's get into the new and the now.
1470580	1474100	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing
1474100	1474580	this week.
1474580	1476180	So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1477300	1482260	Now, again, now that you just put put like food that you're trying to eat, I'm going
1482260	1483060	to go to Loki then.
1483060	1485940	Oh, I swallowed quickly.
1485940	1486440	Okay.
1487860	1488660	Animal Crossing.
1490500	1492660	And patterned has new stuff out.
1492660	1493940	So I've been playing some more patterned.
1494500	1498340	Um, I have a lot of other stuff going on, so I haven't really, you know, like I said,
1498340	1498900	played a whole lot.
1498900	1501860	I'm trying to get through just this month before I start anything new.
1501860	1506420	But, um, I was going to be setting up the stuff for my stream and not a single person
1506420	1508420	donated to vote for a game.
1509460	1512100	So I don't know.
1512100	1512500	We'll see.
1513140	1514500	I put the call out.
1514500	1515380	No one answered.
1516180	1521540	So well, we might have to poll folks to see if there's something, maybe a different idea
1521540	1522820	that would get a little more.
1522900	1524100	Gotta pay for the vote.
1524100	1524600	Yeah.
1525060	1525560	All right.
1526180	1529140	Well, uh, if that's it for Dark Sakura's gaming week, let's go to Loki.
1529140	1530020	How was your gaming week?
1530740	1531860	Um, it was all right.
1531860	1534020	I played mostly Orna.
1534020	1537540	Um, I did play a bit of Minecraft this week.
1537540	1539300	I streamed a little bit on.
1539300	1540420	I saw some of that.
1540420	1540920	Yeah, yeah.
1541540	1541860	Yeah.
1541860	1543460	So I, I tried doing it.
1543460	1544180	I don't know.
1544180	1548740	Like I've been getting the itch to do more Minecraft stuff, but like I wanted, I want
1548740	1550740	to like play with actual people.
1550740	1553300	Like it's, it's kind of irritating.
1553300	1557300	I see that like this thing with a bunch of like, not really massive YouTubers, but like
1557300	1563060	some pretty decent YouTubers, um, decided to do that's the trend nowadays is these,
1563060	1565460	uh, survival multiplayer servers.
1565460	1573140	And so like there's dream SMP, which is kind of a dream is a speed runner for, um, Minecraft.
1573140	1575380	He also does these like manhunt videos and stuff like that.
1575380	1576900	So it's him and a bunch of friends, Mr.
1576900	1578180	Beast and stuff like that.
1578260	1581620	Um, they do their own thing and they kind of have almost like the soap opera thing that
1581620	1582660	goes on along with it.
1582660	1586980	So they write their own storyline to go along with that and drama and manufacturer drama
1586980	1587700	and stuff.
1587700	1592740	Um, then there's a brand new one called Epic SMP that just started with like Gus Johnson,
1592740	1597780	a bunch of other, uh, YouTubers as well that are pretty funny kind of on the comedy side
1597780	1598180	things.
1598180	1599780	A lot of these guys that I watch.
1599780	1602660	And so, um, they kind of all started playing.
1602660	1606340	It was just a bunch of people that like a lot of them haven't really even played Minecraft
1606340	1606740	before.
1606740	1612100	And so it's just kind of go, it's a big range of people that have, you know, lots of experience
1612100	1617060	in Minecraft, some of their primary Minecraft YouTubers and some that just do like comedy
1617060	1620500	stuff that are just kind of doing it with everybody else.
1620500	1625460	And so it's just a really cool mix, but it's fun to watch all of them just like work together
1625460	1628260	and like do something like, man, I want to do that kind of stuff.
1628260	1633220	But like, I can't find like a group of people cause like in order to do something like that,
1633220	1637380	you want to have a group of streamers that would actually want to like broadcast on a
1637380	1642100	regular basis and be able to get people that would play on a regular basis to kind of work
1642100	1643380	together on something.
1643380	1648660	Um, I do watch a lot of, you know, YouTube stuff, especially like, uh, Hermitcraft is
1648660	1652340	another one or truly bedrock on the bedrock side of Minecraft.
1652340	1657540	Um, they do these kind of like, you know, streams where they're not necessarily griefing
1657540	1661540	each other, which is kind of one big community that they work towards different things.
1661620	1666500	Hermitcraft, they have like this whole commerce system that they sell and buy stuff and they
1666500	1668340	do little activities and fun, like stuff like that.
1668340	1669700	So that would be fun.
1669700	1671220	I would love to do that.
1671220	1676260	Um, but, uh, the best, the closest I can get to that is I have a server where my kids demand
1676260	1678660	that I go build things for them.
1678660	1683060	And I end up, you know, having to do all the work and that's it.
1683060	1685380	And there's no sort of teamwork or anything.
1685380	1688420	It's just kids complaining about not having stuff.
1688420	1693460	So that's what I was streaming as I was showing off, like, uh, the realm that we've worked
1693460	1697620	on for the last 10 months and just all the different things that built in that.
1697620	1702260	So I just kind of wandered around for a good hour and a half, kind of showing all the builds
1702260	1704740	off that we've done, uh, or most of the bills.
1704740	1708500	There are some that are kind of far away that I didn't want to walk to, but, uh, it was
1708500	1713060	fun for a while, but like after a while, I just kind of, I don't know, it would be a
1713060	1717300	lot better if there was other people playing at the same time, I think, but I don't know.
1717460	1723140	It's, and even I know when we try to do like the VOG Minecraft stuff, it's hard because
1723140	1726900	there's, it's not everybody's playing at the same time.
1726900	1730420	You need to have people that are really like dedicated to playing at the same time, I guess,
1730420	1734740	or just coordinate schedules is hard too with, you know, adults.
1734740	1739700	Um, so I don't know how we would do that, but like it would be, it wouldn't be nice to
1739700	1740100	build that.
1740100	1743700	So I'm just going to try to find maybe some folks to start something like that.
1743700	1744340	Cause it'd be fun.
1744900	1748020	But in the meantime, I have this, the realm I've been playing for a while.
1748020	1750900	So I was showing that off and all the bills that we have in there.
1750900	1751860	So it was pretty cool.
1751860	1752360	Nice.
1752900	1753140	All right.
1753140	1753300	Yeah.
1753300	1754500	I caught a little bit of that stream.
1754500	1755940	It was a guy I was lurking.
1755940	1758100	I, sometimes I do it from my, um, Xbox.
1758100	1761860	So it's a little bit of a pain in the ass to chat, but I, I lurk.
1761860	1762820	So it's cool.
1762820	1766100	I caught a little bit of it, um, my gaming week.
1766100	1770820	So, uh, speaking of streaming, I did a couple of final fantasy 14 streams in the past week.
1771220	1776900	Myself and, uh, my friends, Shane and Ray, we were doing some streaming of just like
1776900	1780660	maps is a big thing we're into in the game right now is that you do these treasure maps
1780660	1784660	and once in a while, like one out of every four or something, we'll do a portal that
1784660	1786500	takes you to this big roulette wheel.
1786500	1789780	And it's almost like you're playing a game show, but you're doing fights on the game.
1789780	1792180	It's like smash TV, but in final fantasy.
1792180	1796180	Um, so those have been kind of fun just to stream because, you know, I'm sure the viewers
1796180	1800100	love to see when we get zonked out or, you know, we think we get zonked out and then
1800100	1804820	the lightning bolt, uh, crashes and we get another spin, just silly things like that.
1804820	1807140	So been having fun playing final fantasy 14.
1807140	1811700	Um, and, uh, we'll try to do some more streams cause that's been a good way to kind of motivate
1811700	1816420	myself to do some streaming on my personal channel over at Rob Roberts here on Twitch.
1816420	1818260	Um, but that's not all I've been playing.
1818260	1819700	I've been playing some other games too.
1819700	1825060	Um, over on Xbox, I played a little more Tetris effect just because I hadn't cleared
1825060	1827060	journey mode on Xbox yet.
1827060	1831220	Um, I played a little bit of the multiplayer previously, but I hadn't really played any
1831220	1831940	of the single player.
1831940	1835380	So I kind of, you know, I just went through in the night and knocked all that out, got
1835380	1840100	some achievements, uh, from playing that front to back and doing all that.
1840100	1845220	Um, if anybody actually does the Microsoft reward points, uh, they have a thing going
1845220	1849460	on right now where like up to 10,000 gamers scored that you are in this month turns into
1849460	1850340	points.
1850340	1853380	And I like being very recursive with the points.
1853380	1857060	Cause if you get like 6,000 points, you can get like a $5 Xbox card.
1857060	1861300	So that's just like five bucks towards your next game or let them stack up and that whole
1861300	1861540	thing.
1861540	1864260	So that's kind of, that's, that's fun.
1864260	1868820	Um, and also on Xbox torchlight three hit game pass.
1868820	1871140	So I played that just a little bit.
1871140	1875460	Um, still trying to kind of wrap my head around it because there's a lot that going on in
1875460	1878260	that game and the tutorial isn't very great.
1878260	1883060	Um, I'm not sure I'm as into it as I was torchlight two, but I'm going to try to give it a little
1883060	1885380	more time and see if it's something that grows on me a little bit.
1885380	1889700	And I've heard kind of in general that not as many people were as big on torchlight three,
1889700	1893380	um, because I guess it felt a little bit more like it was supposed to be a phone or a spinoff
1893380	1893540	thing.
1893540	1897620	And they kind of kind of back ended it into being an official torchlight three.
1897620	1901300	And I can kind of see that, but I want to be fair and give it a little more time just
1901300	1901700	to see.
1902340	1907700	Um, and then otherwise I've been playing a lot of Pokemon shield still working on my
1907700	1908420	pokey decks.
1908420	1911780	I'm almost so, uh, not counting the DLC.
1911780	1916100	I refuse to let myself get the DLC until I finish my pokey decks in the main game.
1916100	1917300	And I'm getting really close.
1917300	1919140	You guys I'm under 20 now.
1919140	1921460	I think last count I was at 17.
1921460	1923620	Um, I put a call out on Twitter earlier.
1923620	1926900	I was like, help, I need a Galarian Darumaka.
1926900	1933140	I can't get one on home because on home you can't specify that you want a Galarian Darumaka.
1933140	1936900	So every time I would put up like Galarian Corsola, which kind of like the equivalent
1936900	1942180	in shield, I would get fucking regular Darumakas that somebody caught in Pokemon Go.
1942180	1943380	I'm like, I don't want these.
1943380	1946340	I want a Galarian one and I wasn't getting them.
1946340	1951060	But finally, so I went on Twitter and I ugly begged and thankfully it worked.
1951060	1952820	Somebody was like, yep, I'm ready.
1952820	1953620	Here's the code.
1953620	1954980	It was like, perfect.
1954980	1956580	So I got what I needed there.
1956580	1959620	So, um, yeah, so I'm down to like only 17.
1959620	1963940	Um, I still have some, the other one that's going to be really hard to get is the, um,
1963940	1964820	there's an apple.
1965380	1967300	There's an there's Applin.
1967300	1973460	And then that evolves into one type with a shield item and one type with a sword item.
1973460	1976260	And I can't find any more of the berries.
1976260	1979620	I had one to make the app, whatever the evolved one is.
1980500	1985220	I cannot find another stupid berry or apple or whatever it is to evolve.
1985940	1990260	Even just get a second one of those to trade somebody for the shield or for the sword
1990260	1990980	equivalent.
1990980	1992580	Yeah, it's such a pain in the ass.
1992660	1994820	So thank you, Appleton and Flapple.
1994820	1998340	I can never, so I have Appleton, I think I need Flapple.
1998340	1999780	So I'll figure it out.
1999780	2002100	Um, I just have to find another one of those berries.
2002100	2005460	Somebody said you got to check near the trees and sometimes you'll see a sparkling.
2006980	2008260	Do they still make Snapple?
2008820	2009540	I think they do.
2009540	2010820	I think they do as well.
2010820	2012500	I just, I miss the Snapple lady.
2012500	2013300	Remember those commercials?
2013300	2014260	I miss fruitopia.
2014260	2015620	Hi from Snapple.
2015620	2016020	All right.
2016020	2018820	Anyway, uh, she Hulk says, what is Pokemon?
2019140	2022580	Uh, it's, it's a addicting little game, especially during quarantine.
2022580	2023700	That's for sure.
2023700	2025860	So, um, let's see.
2025860	2028340	Act Def says Appleton is the fat one.
2028340	2029620	Flapple is the skinny one.
2029620	2030980	Now that's not very nice.
2030980	2033620	That's not a very nice way to say it.
2033620	2035300	Um, let's see.
2035300	2038100	Bobby Blackwell says, this is why I stopped playing Pokemon sword.
2038100	2043700	Once the credits rolled, I did two a year ago and then quarantine happened.
2043700	2045140	And you know what happened guys?
2045140	2046260	I got really bored.
2046260	2052820	So I was like, I, I, I'm going to catch, I got bored and bought equipment.
2054660	2055780	I got bored and bought stuff.
2056340	2058580	I got bored and I said, you know what?
2058580	2061140	Today, I'm going to catch them all.
2061140	2061700	Oh yes.
2062420	2066260	I'm going to catch them all and I'm still working on it.
2066260	2069460	So well, better catch Pokemon than, you know, the plague.
2069460	2070900	That's, that's very true.
2070900	2071540	Very, very true.
2072100	2072500	All right.
2073380	2073940	Anyway.
2073940	2075700	Um, so that's it for my gaming week.
2076100	2077060	Lots of Pokemans.
2077060	2078580	A Pokemon go as well.
2078580	2080340	I have been playing that too.
2080340	2082580	Um, a chop community day was Saturday.
2082580	2084100	I kind of half-assed it.
2084100	2085620	I got seven shinies.
2085620	2086740	That's plenty.
2086740	2088260	I don't need more than that.
2088260	2094420	Um, and then I forgot to evolve to get the special move, which I'm really annoyed about.
2094420	2097620	I think I got one that has the special move and I'm really annoyed.
2097620	2098580	I forgot to do the others.
2098580	2100580	Oh my, I know fail on all accounts, right?
2100580	2102340	No pixel Pacas.
2102340	2104660	I got bored and made a passion's discord server.
2105460	2109300	Like the soap opera, my favorite soap opera of all time passions.
2110500	2111540	Oh my God.
2111540	2116260	I just said FFS passions because for fuck's sake, really?
2117620	2118820	That's kind of funny.
2118820	2119460	Oh my God.
2119460	2121140	It really is the soap opera.
2121140	2122340	I'm going to join.
2122340	2124420	I love that with Tabitha and Timmy.
2127940	2129060	You don't even know.
2129060	2133620	We used to get together in college and drink and watch, uh, passions that was taped earlier
2133620	2134100	in the day.
2134660	2135300	Good times.
2135940	2137620	You know what we used to do in college?
2137620	2138180	What?
2138180	2140100	Play the jumping flash demo on repeat.
2141380	2146980	We played a lot of Mario Kart, but the other thing was taking all of the anime that my
2146980	2150980	friends had like third generation, you know, like taped off of TV and whatnot stuff.
2151540	2153540	And then, uh, make up our own dialogue.
2155060	2159380	As Joe and Hunter Matt and chat says, can you use elite TM to get payback yet?
2159380	2161940	I think so, but I'm not going to burn an elite TM on that.
2161940	2164100	I don't even think that's one of the more useful moves.
2164100	2164420	Is it?
2164420	2168660	I feel like there's other Mon with other useful moves that you really want to TM into.
2168660	2170340	So anyway.
2171140	2171540	All right.
2171540	2172260	I got one.
2172260	2173620	That's probably plenty.
2173620	2174980	Uh, let's move on.
2174980	2175300	That's it.
2175300	2176820	That's enough Pokemon chat.
2176820	2179300	Let's get into some other gaming news here.
2179300	2180980	Cause there was some stuff that went on this week.
2180980	2183860	We're starting to get back into the regular cycle of news again.
2183860	2187780	Um, and there's a, especially with consumer electronics show this week, although there
2187780	2191220	wasn't a lot of gaming news out of CES, but there was a little bit.
2191220	2193220	Um, but there was news on all sorts of fronts.
2193220	2193540	Right.
2193540	2196820	And including one story that won't go away.
2196820	2197140	Right.
2197140	2197540	Loki.
2199300	2201060	Uh, that is correct.
2201060	2201460	Yeah.
2201460	2211140	So, um, CG CD project red, um, they put out an apology video, uh, talking about their
2211140	2216740	commitment to quality and which, uh, the co-founder, uh, Marcin.
2217620	2224580	The wind ski apologize for the state of a cyberpunk 2077, basically said that not to
2224580	2229780	blame the dev teams, that it was up to the board to decide when to release that game.
2230340	2237940	Um, also that they were having issues with performance on the, uh, older consoles because
2237940	2243780	of the streaming service or the asset streaming that they were putting into the game.
2243780	2250100	Cause it's so condensed into a small area that, um, they have to keep rewriting that
2250820	2253700	basically said that they put out a roadmap.
2253700	2257220	Um, like, I mean, I swear to God, it's like, we talk about this all the time with different
2257220	2260260	games and these roadmaps, like our game socks, right?
2260260	2264020	Well, it's not sucks, but our game is less than ideal right now.
2264020	2267940	So now we're going to put out a roadmap and when it's going to be done.
2267940	2272020	So there's a big patches expected out soon.
2272100	2274500	I think it actually already came out 1.06.
2274500	2277140	Um, and actually that just came out the hot fix for that.
2277140	2280740	And then there should be a more substantial patch in like 10 days or so.
2280740	2283540	And then another one following that as well.
2283540	2286420	Um, they're going to be putting out the free DLCs.
2286420	2290260	There's going to be the next gen consulate date, which was supposed to be coming out.
2290260	2293140	Now it was originally set for March.
2293140	2293940	That ain't happening.
2293940	2296260	That's now coming out the second half of the year.
2297700	2301300	And yeah, so everything pushed back.
2301300	2305380	They also said that they're not going to be having their teams crunch,
2305380	2309380	or they're going to be avoiding crunch on all future product or projects.
2309380	2311220	He said is one of their priorities.
2311220	2311460	Okay.
2311460	2312500	But they said that before.
2313940	2314180	Yeah.
2314180	2314660	I'm I'm.
2315700	2318500	He apologized, but did he resign though?
2318500	2321780	Did he talk about his personal accountability though?
2321780	2323860	Did he talk about, see that's.
2325380	2326020	I don't know.
2326020	2327620	That's where it kind of starts to lose me.
2328180	2328660	Yeah.
2328660	2330340	It's it's no, he did not.
2330340	2333220	And it, it felt kind of hollow.
2333220	2336900	Like there was stuff, you know, where they like, oh, we thought it was in good shape.
2336900	2338340	You know, it was in pretty good shape.
2339220	2340180	No, you didn't.
2340180	2341140	You know, better.
2341140	2344900	You could, there's no way, you know, cause they, I think they mentioned something about
2344900	2349300	like in our testing, you know, it, everything seemed to be going well, but like there was
2349300	2352260	stuff that was happening that you guys are experiencing outside our testing.
2352260	2356340	It's like, dude, like there's, it's just normal gameplay.
2356340	2360100	Like there's stuff clearly broken.
2360100	2362420	Stuff that's clearly been pieced together.
2363700	2367620	You know, uh, they were talking about like the police system in the game and how there
2367620	2371780	was going to be some police that were corrupt that you could bribe.
2371780	2376260	Or, you know, if you got your wanted level too high, there would be, you know, assassins
2376260	2377700	that would come after you and stuff like that.
2378580	2380180	That is not what's in the game right now.
2380180	2385220	It is basically you cause a crime and the police teleport to you somehow.
2385220	2387300	They will literally spawn in right behind you.
2387300	2390020	Even if you're locked yourself into a closet or something.
2391220	2393140	It is just ridiculous.
2393140	2398260	Like just how, uh, rushed everything seems to be.
2398260	2401940	So like, I don't really buy half of what he's saying.
2401940	2404820	And honestly, like, show me the receipts.
2404820	2407540	I want to see these patches and see what it does to the game.
2407540	2409380	Cause I don't believe you right now.
2409380	2411220	Show me the receipts, retire bitch.
2411220	2413380	Cause that's the only way anything's going to change.
2413380	2415220	Like, sorry, but not sorry.
2415220	2418100	But Bobby says in chat from now on, we won't have crunch.
2418100	2418420	Okay.
2418420	2420820	For real this time from now on, we won't have crunch.
2420820	2421220	Okay.
2421220	2422340	Third time's the charm.
2422340	2424660	Now, from now on, we won't have crunch.
2424660	2428980	I'm not buying what you're selling retire bitch.
2428980	2431380	Because that's the only way anything's really going to change.
2433540	2433860	Yeah.
2433860	2437220	It's I don't anticipate any sort of changes.
2437220	2438500	They did, they got caught.
2438500	2441940	They needed, they felt like that they needed to apologize to save face.
2443300	2444580	But I mean, come on.
2444580	2451060	It's just, this is the same stuff that we get from EA and, you know, oh, well, I'm sorry
2451060	2454260	that the quality of our game, here's the roadmap of how we're laying it out.
2454260	2456980	Oh, Hey, look, it's Bethesda talking about Fallout 76.
2456980	2459140	Here's the roadmap on how we're fixing it.
2459140	2464900	Like, come on you guys, you got to stop doing this, but they're not going to, because
2464900	2471780	people still buy their games and there's no, there's literally no sort of, um, punishment
2471780	2472260	for them.
2472260	2474900	I mean, they, there's no consequences for them to do this.
2474900	2478500	And that's why you're going to keep seeing them do this because people will keep supporting
2478500	2479000	them.
2479860	2481140	Some comments from chat.
2481140	2484900	Fifth Dream in chat says it's not CD Projekt Red if the guy who runs it resigns.
2485780	2490260	Mojang would like to have a word, a company that is in a far better position, thanks to
2490260	2492020	those sorts of changes, that's for sure.
2493060	2497540	Zen Monkey says be happy with the devil you have now because the next one could be a lot
2497540	2498260	worse.
2498260	2499540	I'm not sure.
2499540	2502740	I mean, I understand that saying and why it's out there.
2502740	2506820	I'm not sure I would apply it in this scenario.
2506820	2512900	Like I, again, and I said this early on when this all started happening, the only way that
2512900	2517860	things are going to change is with new leadership and that, and I stand by what I said four
2517860	2523060	weeks ago or whenever this stuff first started breaking is that one of these co-leaders is
2523060	2525140	going down because of this.
2525140	2528340	And we'll see, it's just, we're just, we're seeing everything play out.
2528340	2532660	It's all, it's all the motions because, because he, did he not try to blame the board in this
2532660	2533860	what he said, right?
2533860	2536020	You think the board's going to have that?
2536020	2537940	Well, he was, he's part of the board.
2537940	2541380	So what he is basically trying to do, it wasn't that he was blaming somebody else.
2541380	2547140	He was basically trying to shift blame from the actual developers saying you shouldn't,
2547140	2551940	because people are sending death threats to these people because they're dumb and it's
2551940	2552820	the internet.
2552820	2557780	So they were basically saying, you know, listen, don't come after the developers.
2557780	2560580	It's not, they're doing the game is in this situation.
2560580	2564580	You know, we decided the shift as the board is the one that makes that final decision.
2564580	2564820	Right.
2564820	2570020	And you can, don't ever bully developers and people that work at the company.
2570020	2571700	That's just a stupid thing in general.
2571700	2577060	So I will, I will say that like, yes, that is the, and that is a message that needs to
2577060	2581460	be out there, unfortunately, because people don't know how to conduct themselves online.
2581460	2586020	So that part, certainly I have no problem with that statement, except the fact that
2586020	2587140	it has to be said at all.
2587140	2587780	That's for sure.
2588340	2594580	So, Bobby Blackall says, Cyberpunk 2077 is a failure of management, not a failure of
2594580	2595860	developers or QA.
2595860	2597220	100% agree.
2597220	2601380	And again, there's many people that would say it's not a failure at all, depending on
2601380	2605060	what platform you're playing it on or, you know, just how your luck has been with what
2605060	2606420	you've run into in game or not.
2607140	2612900	And that's, that's part of the interesting kind of layers of this whole story is that
2612900	2615780	it's not bad for everybody, just some people.
2615780	2617780	So anyway, all right.
2619220	2622420	But Loki, you're still, you're still playing the game and for the most part liking it,
2622420	2622820	right?
2622820	2625380	I haven't, I haven't played it in a while.
2625380	2626420	I did like it.
2626420	2628740	I mean, I thought the story was okay.
2628740	2632580	I'm okay with some of the bugs right now, as long as it doesn't break the game completely
2632580	2633380	for me.
2633460	2634980	So far, I haven't really ran into the thing.
2634980	2636820	The police thing is kind of stupid.
2636820	2638500	Like I don't really fight.
2638500	2642580	I don't really cause any crimes in the game, but like if I wanted to kind of have like
2642580	2647700	a, you know, spree or something like that, I don't think it's really fair the way that
2647700	2648500	the system works.
2648500	2650340	I mean, literally they spawn in anywhere.
2650340	2651620	Like you can watch videos online.
2651620	2657060	They show, you know, examples of that where you'll be up on top of like a little, you
2657060	2662180	know, ledge, like, you know, way up on a building and you shoot somebody, you look around, there's
2662180	2663060	no one there.
2663060	2665860	All of a sudden, boom, there's like literally a cop right behind you.
2665860	2667940	It's like, how did you get up here?
2667940	2669780	How did you teleport behind me?
2670580	2671700	It's just silly.
2672500	2673940	All right, let's move on.
2673940	2677940	Let's talk about a brand new Nintendo Switch that was announced this week.
2677940	2681940	Sorry, it's not the Switch Pro that all the gaming media is trying to get you hyped for,
2681940	2685780	but it's just a, it's a new skin for the classic Nintendo Switch.
2685780	2688340	Although I will say this is a very good looking system.
2688340	2695300	It is a Mario themed Nintendo Switch, and it's aptly timed with Super Mario 3D World
2695300	2696580	plus Bowser's Fury.
2697140	2702660	This new Switch will be out on February 12th to kind of be in tandem with that for those
2702660	2707060	that may finally break down and get a Switch because that's the game that's releasing or
2707060	2709380	those that are spending their stimulus money on a Switch.
2709380	2710820	I don't know, your money, your business.
2712020	2716820	But it is a nice, it's a red and blue edition, so it's themed like Mario colors.
2716820	2718020	Sorry, Luigi fans.
2718900	2720180	That would get me excited.
2720180	2722820	How about a green and white one for Luigi suspenders?
2722820	2726980	But whatever we have or one that you dip it in water and it changes colors.
2728100	2730020	Don't, please don't dip your Switch into water.
2730020	2731540	Please do not dip your Switch into water.
2731540	2732500	That was a dumb joke.
2732500	2733060	All right.
2733060	2738260	Anyway, we'll just spread that rumor online and lots of people will break the Switches.
2738260	2738820	Hehe.
2738820	2740100	We'll make a video.
2740100	2740600	All right.
2741700	2743220	But it's a red and blue system.
2743300	2745060	So it's like the dock's red.
2745060	2748660	The little dog ear thing that you put your controllers in is blue.
2748660	2751140	The Joy-Cons are red and blue.
2751140	2754420	There's a carrying case that's red and blue with yellow zippers.
2754420	2756340	It is very like Mario inspired.
2756340	2758260	It's supposed to kind of look like Mario suspenders.
2758980	2762420	It's going to cost you the $300 that a Nintendo Switch would cost.
2763060	2764980	I think it looks really cool though.
2764980	2771140	Like, and I can't justify spending $300 just to get a Switch in another color.
2771140	2774740	But if I didn't have a Switch, I'd be all about wanting to get this one.
2774740	2775460	That's for sure.
2776100	2778580	Speaking of Mario 3D World and Bowser's Fury.
2778580	2781700	And we were just talking a little bit about this a couple weeks ago on the show.
2781700	2784900	Whatever happened to like amiibos being used in games?
2784900	2789140	Well, apparently Mario 3D World and Bowser's Fury will have some amiibo support.
2790180	2791780	So what's going to happen?
2792340	2798820	Bowser and Bowser Jr., their amiibo figures will be returning to retailers and they have
2798900	2800260	some specific activation.
2800260	2801940	But we don't know exactly what it is.
2801940	2806260	And then there are some cat amiibo that will also have some features.
2806260	2809940	So it sounds like, you know, we're getting some reprints out of this and there will be
2809940	2813940	some sort of, I bet it will probably give you items in the game or something like that.
2813940	2815460	Are the cat ones new?
2816340	2818100	There are some new cat ones coming.
2818100	2818580	Okay.
2818580	2818740	Yeah.
2819460	2824500	So, or they'll unlock some new costumes kind of like Mario Odyssey or something like that.
2824500	2825000	Who knows?
2825880	2833240	So Zen Monkey in chat says Nintendo should take a risk and kill off Mario.
2835000	2843480	Can you imagine, can you imagine Mario murder party where like one of, one of these great
2843480	2848120	mascots will be killed off by Nintendo, never to be seen again.
2849320	2850440	Sorry Waluigi.
2851240	2856280	They tease that several times in the smash videos.
2856280	2858200	Remember like Sephiroth.
2858200	2859640	Sephiroth thing was so good.
2859640	2860140	Yeah.
2860760	2867640	And then, I know there was another one too, where like his soul got knocked out of his
2867640	2868920	body or something like that.
2868920	2873640	I want to say there was some, I think it was a smash video where that happened.
2873640	2875880	I don't remember which character was though.
2875880	2877160	Ridley says chat.
2877800	2878300	Oh yeah.
2879100	2884140	Um, Sia Tabiri says Mario is missing, but with blood dripping from the letters.
2885740	2887500	Mario is missing permanently.
2889820	2891020	You guys are sick.
2891020	2891520	I love it.
2893100	2894540	You guys have problems.
2894540	2895040	All right.
2896860	2901660	Sia Tabiri says I legitimately still want to murder mystery party in Animal Crossing.
2901660	2906700	Well, like it, and you know, to keep it legit, it doesn't have to be like actual murder,
2906700	2911580	but I think it would be fun to have costume parties that are like that in Animal Crossing.
2911580	2912780	I think that's cool.
2912780	2914460	So, all right.
2914460	2915980	Anyhow, let's move on.
2917020	2919180	Let's talk about a different system than Nintendo.
2919180	2920380	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
2922940	2925980	Uh, I have something about the PS5.
2926700	2931260	So, um, you know, people are always looking for the patents that come out regarding any
2931260	2934780	of these systems to try to get an idea of what could be happening.
2934780	2940540	And there has been a patent filed that looks like there's going to be something to,
2941500	2944220	as an add in, something to add to the experience.
2944940	2949100	So, um, this particular patent that's come to light,
2949740	2954300	it looks like a PlayStation VR headset that includes haptic feedback.
2955020	2957740	There's no dates or anything, of course, with that,
2957740	2962620	but it looks like one of those ones that could just immediately be implemented.
2963260	2968860	Um, another one allows players to leave text and audio notes in games for other users.
2969580	2974300	So, like, if you like, say, walk up on like a trouble point,
2974300	2976620	then you might get a tip there if you look for it.
2977260	2980060	You know, that sounds like a Dark Souls thing in every game.
2980860	2982940	I was actually saying more like Super Mario Maker.
2983740	2984620	Oh, yeah, that too.
2984620	2985180	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2986140	2986640	Yeah.
2987280	2993680	Um, and, uh, but basically it's there for user generated game advice.
2994240	2998720	Um, has, and they also specify that it will live quote within
2998720	3002000	a game space using a virtual coordinate system and quote.
3002800	3005520	So, um, it could be interesting.
3006480	3009680	I kind of love that idea as long as I can limit it to my friends.
3010480	3014000	But I don't want to see stranger danger notes because I'll just see
3014000	3016080	dicks everywhere in every game I play.
3016080	3021200	But if I, if I limit it to friends, I'll only see the dicks that Loki drew and put in games.
3021200	3025040	It would, it would be, it sounds like it would be just like Dark Souls almost, but like.
3025040	3027040	Or Mario Maker is a good comparison.
3027040	3028320	If you died here, you suck.
3030240	3031920	I'd only leave that note for you, Jamie.
3034320	3038320	Yeah, the thing is, though, is that I wouldn't, uh, look for any notes.
3039760	3041840	Joke's on you, Rob. I disabled all your notes.
3042720	3044000	Exactly, exactly.
3044320	3049040	Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says, if you died, if you died here, you're Bobby Black Wolf.
3049040	3052720	Yep. No, I just leave little notes in every game.
3052720	3058560	Rob Roberts was here, but you know, the best way not to lose Rob when don't play.
3061440	3064400	Uh, but seriously, sometimes I'm kidding.
3064400	3066560	Seriously, that patent sounds really neat.
3066560	3071520	I'd I'd actually love to see something like that in the, um, uh, ecosystem for PlayStation.
3072000	3077360	And it makes sense too, because they have the whole like hitting the button to see the,
3077360	3082640	the YouTube or whatever Sony proprietary video to see how to get certain achievements.
3082640	3085680	Like that is a thing that's already kind of baked in the PlayStation five.
3085680	3089840	So like user generated content of that sort makes a lot of sense.
3089840	3094480	Again, I worry about what happens if everybody and everyone can do that,
3094480	3098080	but if you can follow certain trusted people or your friends or something like that,
3098080	3100160	I think it could be really cool to be honest.
3100160	3106800	To be honest, I think that's a neat feature for the, uh, console and, uh, yeah, I look forward to
3106800	3114880	it. All right. Well, let's move on Loki. All right. So, you know, it's hard to believe that
3114880	3121200	even though we're still in the middle of COVID, they were talking about, um, these brand new
3121200	3126240	tournament leagues that are coming up soon. So starting off with, um, Overwatch, uh,
3126320	3130880	Overwatch league, they've announced their 2021 season. It sounds like it's going to be kind of
3130880	3137440	similar to what they've been doing already with, um, you know, taking considerations for COVID and
3137440	3142000	stuff. So for example, instead of actually traveling to these different parts of the
3142000	3147600	country, everybody's going to be kind of hunkered down in their own countries and playing online
3147600	3152720	only match matches. They're structured around regional tournaments. They're splitting up,
3152720	3159920	uh, the league into two divisions, North America and European. Um, so they're going to be playing
3159920	3167440	in the 13 team North American division, and then the remaining seven are going to be played in the
3167440	3175200	Asia division. And then, um, yeah, I mean, it's, it's interesting. I mean, they have to obviously
3175200	3180080	adapt with everything. Hopefully this year, things will be starting to kind of, uh, the restrictions
3180080	3184960	will be loosening up towards the end of the year. So things can get back to normal, but it sounds
3184960	3190400	like it's going to be business as usual, aside from, you know, the structure, the, uh, format changes
3190400	3196320	for these. So, um, fifth dream in chat says, whoa, Overwatch still exists. That kind of got quiet.
3196320	3200960	Um, well, keep in mind, there's still Overwatch two on the horizon and they're expecting that that
3200960	3205440	will certainly give the whole franchise a big kick in the butt because yeah, this whole COVID and
3205440	3210080	pandemic situation really kind of ham hamstring to the Overwatch league, you know, justice,
3210080	3214320	it was really starting to get its wings and really take off like COVID really. Well, I would say it
3214320	3219520	was one, two punch. It wasn't just COVID, but the move to YouTube was a disaster. I'm sorry,
3219520	3224160	but like it just like the sense of community that they had on Twitch and everything that was a
3224160	3228320	disaster. Whoever thought of that idea to move. I know they did it for money, but that was,
3228320	3233280	it was a dumb move. Sorry. Not sorry. That's reality. Um, and so those two things like back
3233280	3237680	to back, I think really kind of, and I'm not saying like Overwatch league is fucked,
3237680	3241200	they're over anything like that. Like certainly no, there's, there's still plenty of fans at
3241200	3246960	Overwatch league. And I think in the long run, especially when two does come out, um, it will,
3246960	3251120	you know, I think start to get a lot of that growth that was all that was starting to really
3251120	3257680	be behind it until these situations really, I think kind of put a stop to it for a little bit.
3257680	3264640	Um, I would fully expect blizzard does not launch Overwatch two until the pandemic is
3265520	3270240	starting to look like it is in the rear view mirror. I know there's plenty of people saying
3270240	3275200	COVID will always be around always be, but as far as, you know, uh, being able to have these
3275200	3278720	big events again, enough people are getting vaccinated and at least the numbers in the
3278720	3284320	U S are allowing for big events again and that sort of thing. Um, I think blizzard would be
3284320	3289760	very smart to hold on to Overwatch two until then. And then the Overwatch league, I think will kind
3289760	3297600	of, um, be in a good place again. Yes. And then on the opposite end of the spectrum there, you
3297600	3304320	have Capcom announcing that the upcoming Capcom cup and street fighter, uh, league world
3304320	3310960	championship have been canceled, um, due to obviously the rising cases of COVID-19. Um,
3310960	3315760	they've made the decision to cancel those in place. They're going to be doing an online
3315760	3320960	season final for the Capcom pro tour on February 20th and 21st.
3322720	3327920	Um, tiger claw and chat says, and when they announced Overwatch two, you can expect some
3327920	3332480	really massive pre-rendered cinematic. Technically Overwatch two has already been announced with a
3332480	3338160	massive pre-rendered cinematic. However, blizzard likes to drop those pretty regularly and it's
3338160	3342800	almost certain they will do more character reveals. And if I'm not mistaken, they have
3342800	3348720	an event, a virtual event in February that I think is supposed to make, uh, kind of make up for their
3348720	3351840	lack of Blizzcon. Cause obviously with everything in the world, they didn't have a Blizzcon in
3351840	3356560	November for obvious reasons. So I believe they're doing a virtual event in February, ironically
3356560	3362800	enough. So is the team behind Final Fantasy 14 is doing an event February 5th, where it's all
3362800	3368560	but certain the next 14 expansion will be unveiled. And I think blizzard, um, they're
3368560	3373920	really not due to announce a wow expansion cause one just came out, but certainly Overwatch two
3373920	3380000	Diablo four might even get a date. I don't know how far along it is that Diablo cell phone game
3380000	3385120	has all but vanished. So I wonder if they're still going to release it. They might, you know,
3385120	3388160	time that with February. So blizzard still has a lot of news they're kind of sitting on too.
3388880	3394320	And I think we'll see all that in February. So, um, I want, before we get to our next story,
3394320	3398960	I wanted to go back to the earlier, uh, story that Jamie was talking about with leaving notes
3398960	3403840	and games. Cause there's a really good comment here, uh, from, from our own voiceover guy,
3403840	3410880	VX Jason XV, who says my note, I would leave pepperoni and cheese. And you know what that
3410880	3416480	reminded me of is actually like one of the earliest implementations of this before Mario
3416560	3424720	maker before dark souls, the Oregon trail. Remember when you would die on the Oregon trail,
3424720	3430560	you could leave a tombstone behind and put like, you could either put like, you know, pepperoni
3430560	3434320	and sausage was a big one that people would always do. Or you could put like, you know,
3435760	3439520	name of my third grade teacher died of syphilis here or something like that, you know, whatever
3439520	3444160	it is, you could put whatever notes you wanted to. And then the players that would come through
3444160	3450720	later would see those tombstones. So really even before Mario maker or dark souls, the Oregon
3450720	3456720	trail was the first game that left that technology. That is great. I thought that was worth bringing
3456720	3461520	up. All right. Anyhow, let's move on and we'll actually continue talking about Blizzard a little
3461520	3468000	bit because this has to do with a redesign for the battle net, uh, client getting rid of real names.
3468000	3474080	Well, they got rid of that a long time ago. You never had to do that. Uh,
3474080	3482880	they realized it was a bad idea. You can connect it to Facebook, I think, or you can choose who
3482880	3487520	sees that. I don't remember. You know what? Now that I think about it, I think my real name is
3487520	3492240	still visible on there and I don't like it, but I only show it to people that I know in real life.
3492880	3496480	I think it's the whole, you can choose to show your real name to like close friends
3496480	3499920	or something like that. I don't know. Oh, it's been a while since I played Overwatch.
3499920	3503840	It has. Thank you for reminding me about that real name policy, but anyway, um,
3504880	3509120	otherwise the client has been redesigned. It is interesting because it is still kind of blending
3509120	3514400	in the Activision games, which have been in battle net for some time. That's not really new news that
3514400	3519120	call of duty games are in there, but like you really see it in this new redesign that actually
3519120	3524480	kind of separates, uh, things into Blizzard and Activision, which is kind of interesting. Uh,
3524560	3528240	they're saying in this, and I did check it out earlier, but I've been in the beta for a while.
3528240	3533040	So I've actually saw these changes a while ago, but, uh, there's a new expansive layout for news
3533040	3537840	and game content and full page view. There's a new social pain. So you can better see friends
3537840	3541600	and what they're doing in games right now. I have a lot of friends still playing. Wow.
3541600	3547040	I sign on. There's at least 13 people on my list and wow at any given time. Uh, and they're also
3547040	3551840	talking about accessibility improvements and that's cool. You can navigate most of the app
3551840	3557600	with your keyboard and it has better screen reader support as well as improved color contrast.
3557600	3562080	And those are all great things, uh, to see as well. So if you haven't checked out your battle
3562080	3568080	net client in a while, it's going to look a lot different next time you launch it. Let's move on
3568080	3574640	dark soccer. I got a bunch of stuff here. So, um, who remembers Lucas arts?
3575280	3579680	Well, of course who doesn't? I had friends that worked at Lucas arts. That's how I got to go to
3579680	3588720	the Skywalker ranch. Yeah. Um, but now we have a Lucasfilm games. So this officially, uh, revealed
3588720	3596080	by starwars.com that Lucasfilm games is their, uh, identity for their gaming stuff coming from
3596080	3601280	Lucasfilm. Which I also believe was the name of Lucas arts for a brief period in the beginning
3601280	3607680	before they changed it. Yes. It's kind of like back, back to basics. Yeah, exactly. Um, but
3607680	3612080	they're really wanting to have this focus specifically on some of the new games that
3612080	3616960	are come out, bring out the news directly, sort of like, I guess, have their own directs, like how
3616960	3625360	Nintendo does. Um, but, uh, they are, um, still working of course, though, with, uh, with other
3625360	3632160	parties out there, you know, they're not just gonna, gonna do it alone. Um, there is, uh, an
3632160	3640400	open world star wars game being made by Ubisoft. I'm doing a, sorry. Uh, it looks like it might be,
3641040	3645360	no, it's just, it just says open world game. I don't see anything about it being, uh, uh,
3646160	3651520	um, an MMO or anything, but it's by Ubisoft massive, the same group that did, uh, the division.
3652160	3660320	So there's some talk about that coming out. Um, and then in, uh, other things, um, uh,
3660320	3667120	machine games is making an Indiana Jones game. So, uh, and it's going to be a collab between
3667120	3674240	machine games and Lucasfilm games. Neat machine games, by the way, is a, is a part of Bethesda.
3675840	3679840	Yeah. Uh, which, which will be interesting cause the whole Microsoft connection there now too,
3679840	3684080	which this was probably something that the gears were already turning on before Microsoft bottom.
3684080	3687600	So that is going to make that whole situation more interesting, I think in a way.
3688560	3692320	So I just wanted to have like a mini game. That's how many Nazis can you punch in a minute?
3693520	3700160	Um, Bobby Black Wolf in chat actually points out it was Lucasfilm games from 1982 to 1990. So it
3700160	3704720	was more than a brief period, but only the nineties count here at OLR actually. Uh, no,
3704720	3710160	thanks for the clarification. Um, tiger class says Lucasfilm games has a big library of IPs.
3710160	3715920	They can bring back besides star wars in Indiana Jones. Oh, hell yeah. Loom. Um, what maniac
3715920	3720080	mansion was all part of that too, right? There's a new mania mansion to be amazing,
3720080	3723360	but they, they kind of did bring that back already. Didn't they,
3723360	3725920	didn't that come back a couple of years ago under a different, I mean,
3727280	3731680	I don't, did they do a telltale? I don't think they did a telltale series for mania mania
3731680	3736880	mansion aside from just day of the tentacle. Maybe it was a spiritual successor. Maybe that's
3736880	3740720	where monkey Island would be nice. I mean, you can never have too much monkey Island.
3741680	3747800	Obviously we're getting some more salmon max. So, um, that's always good. Um,
3749440	3753520	Ooh. Yeah. Questbuster points out it released games under that label,
3753520	3759600	such as their adaptation for labyrinth. Yes. It even had David Bowie. Ooh. Ooh,
3759600	3764960	I'd be in for that. That's for sure. So that's pretty cool. Yeah, no, they had a lot of great
3764960	3769760	IPs, but obviously they're leveraging some of this big shit. I mean, you don't partner up
3769760	3775840	with Lucas, you know, entertainment and not get your star Wars on and your Indiana Jones.
3775840	3780560	Like these are the, these are the big ones. And I'm sure if these do well, we'll start to see some
3780560	3787920	of the, um, lesser known ones that will pop in as well for sure. So, all right. Well, if that's
3787920	3791680	all we have for that, then let's move on to our next story. Loki.
3793200	3799280	All right. Um, so it's always fun to talk about like different records being broken on Twitch.
3799280	3805760	So now we have yet another all time Twitch viewership records set by a Spanish streamer
3805760	3811040	by the name of the Greg or is that the Greff? I don't know how to pronounce his name. Uh,
3811040	3820240	but anyways, so he apparently was already a pretty popular streamer. He had, I think a record of 660,000
3820240	3826640	concurrent viewers for his Fortnite Galactus event that was back in December. And then of course,
3826640	3833120	because he's such a big, uh, Fortnite streamer, he was unveiling his brand new exclusive Fortnite
3833120	3843440	skin, um, that he was, uh, showing off. So because of that, his view count actually went up to 2.4
3843440	3850960	million, which was now the brand new record for that. So that's even, um, beating out
3851520	3860960	AOC is among the stream, uh, the AOC streams, um, and several entire like communities of games
3860960	3865680	at one time. So that's pretty crazy. Well, it's also worth considering that, um, you know,
3865680	3870880	sometimes our focus and our reality is very centric around the United States.
3870880	3875200	And we are certainly aware that there are other countries out there, you know, in Canada and
3875840	3881520	overseas and, uh, Mexico and all that. But I think it also kind of goes to show like how
3881520	3887440	big of an audience there is in like Latin America for video games. Cause, um, he, he's a Spanish
3887440	3892800	streamer. He's, he speaks Spanish on streams and all that I'm sure. Right. So it's, it's a big
3892800	3898960	audience that I think sometimes we might forget is there if we don't speak that language ourselves.
3898960	3904720	And I think it just shows that like, there's huge demand for this in non English speaking countries.
3905760	3911520	Yeah. For just gaming in general. Absolutely. So, and act deft who I was hoping would agree with me
3911520	3919680	does. Thank you. I, we, we have, we have our official ambassador to Mexico and active,
3919680	3923120	although there actually are some other listeners in Mexico. Cause I interact with some on Twitter.
3923120	3927840	So I don't, I don't want to give all the glory to act deft, but since he is here live, I will let
3927840	3934560	him have most of it. So, but a lot of love for all of our listeners in Mexico and all the other
3934560	3940640	countries around the world that aren't just the U S all right. Anyway, uh, pretty cool though.
3940640	3944560	Uh, interesting that it is still Fortnite that breaks all these records, right?
3945360	3950000	Yeah. You know, after all this time, I mean, it's still a very popular game, so.
3950720	3956080	I was reading some article on one of those sites. I don't know if it's Kotaku or what it was,
3956080	3959840	but it was one of those sites. It was talking about that. There's another game that's like
3959840	3965280	seven years old or something that is starting to find new light on Twitch. Like it's just come out
3965280	3970400	again out of nowhere, kind of like among us did recently. There's some other new game rust.
3970400	3976640	Yeah. Rust was because of offline TV. They're doing some, uh, thing with that. I, I did,
3976640	3981280	I caught a little bit of it, but yeah, it's, they're doing some sort of, I think this is
3981280	3985440	almost kind of like going back to us talking about with the Minecraft S and P stuff where they'll
3985440	3990800	kind of structure an event based around like a certain game and do kind of like role play
3990800	3996160	or whatever with that. And it draws in a lot of viewers. My point is, is that Pixel Poops
3996160	4003840	will have its day. It will be discovered eventually. And actually on a side note,
4003840	4008880	uh, with YYR's version of Pixel Poops, I should give a shout out. Um, if you are on our discord
4008880	4013840	server, cause I need to mention this at some point in the show, um, over at, um, uh, I almost
4013840	4019280	said Twitch TV, uh, slash vog network is where you can watch the shows, but over at vognetwork.com
4019280	4024240	slash discord, you can get an invite to our discord server. And if you take a look in our
4024240	4031840	OLR chat room, there is detail about how you can beta test Pixel Poops for steam and everything
4031840	4037280	is in fact, I just got my code, so I'm going to be playing it later. Maybe I'll even do a stream.
4037280	4042560	We'll see. So check that out. All the info's in our discord, uh, and, uh, and YYR is hooking
4042560	4047360	people up right now. So check that out. Uh, Bobby Blackall was saying his game super multitasking
4047360	4052480	is apparently big in South Korea. Fucking finally that game is getting some traction.
4052480	4057200	Like that game is brilliant. I hope more people find it than just South Korea.
4058080	4063040	Um, although it has to, it always, it has to start somewhere. And so why not? It's as good
4063040	4069600	of a place as any. All right, let's move on. I want to talk about some of the news that
4069600	4074080	actually came out of consumer electronics show. There wasn't a ton, a ton of gaming news,
4074080	4080480	but we did get as expected. We kind of figured this was coming on last week's show arcade one up
4080480	4085280	since those are, yes, it's gaming, but it's also like furniture in your living room,
4085280	4090960	dedicated devices type of stuff. CES is kind of the place for that. So, and yes,
4090960	4097280	we got some new news on arcade cabinets from, uh, CES 2021 for, um, from arcade one up.
4097280	4103280	And I got to say, these are some fucking good cabinets. Like this, this first one blew my mind.
4103280	4110480	It is a killer instinct cabinet with killer instinct, killer instinct two and battle toads,
4110480	4115840	battle toads, double dragon. It's like a rare cabinet. So that is awesome. Like just having
4115840	4121840	the arcade version of killer instinct two. Fuck. That's awesome. So that like, I want it, but I
4121840	4126640	don't have the room for it. Here's something that's definitely up dark Sakura's alley a little bit.
4126640	4131120	And I think it's up mine too. I would love this machine. Although, um, these games have been
4131120	4138320	released a million times, but why not a cabinet for dragon's lair, dragon's lair two and space
4138320	4144960	ACE. And what's really cool about that. You can get one that is either a dragon's lair cabinet,
4144960	4150240	or you can get a space ACE cabinet, but the entire in the inside parts are still the same.
4150240	4154320	So that's kind of, so if you want like a S I almost think the space ACE is a little
4154320	4157920	more desirable because you don't see that one as much. Dragon's lair is kind of everywhere,
4157920	4162160	but that is neat. I don't know, dark soccer. You've probably played those games to death,
4162160	4165440	but I know you have a lot of love for Don Bluth. So I don't know, maybe.
4165440	4170560	I, I, I do. It's I really like his animation. I'll be honest. I'm really not all that great
4170560	4176240	at either. Um, uh, really any of those cinematic, you know, press the button at the right time type
4176240	4182880	stories. Um, but I certainly like watching other people play it. I, I certainly, I mean,
4183120	4186640	they're, they're both great games. I've played quite a bit of dragon's lair, dragon's lair,
4186640	4192800	two, um, space ACE, um, cliff jumper, which was the loop on the third. Oh,
4194080	4198560	one. Um, there's that one with the car. What was the one with the car? I played that on Sega CD.
4198560	4205200	I think I don't remember the one with the car. Um, and it always makes me think of, um,
4205840	4212880	um, oh gosh, as a, another, uh, it reminds me of the anime writing bean, which it's an
4212880	4218720	IDs era one. Um, we've had like the special car and everything. It was the race car. Why can't
4218720	4223680	I think of the name of it now? That one was always fun, but I, I was never any good at them.
4223680	4227680	And tiger client chat says, maybe they'll release those other laser disc games. You never know.
4227680	4233120	I mean, now there has been a precedent set that if they want to, they can update those,
4233120	4237520	those cabinets with new games. And Bobby black Wolf went into great detail on an earlier episode
4237520	4242160	of his show about, you know, for better or for worse. And actually that is all on the YouTube.
4242160	4246800	Uh, I know I don't plug the, the VOG network YouTube very often, but that is all chronicled
4246800	4252480	there. If you want to see that. So like an actual, his outrun cabinet actually got a new game. Um,
4252480	4256560	even though it was a little bit of pain in the ass to make work, he detailed all that in a video.
4256560	4261120	So yes, they could add a new game. These are running off of laser discs anymore.
4261120	4264960	Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. They're just running off of like a USB stick at this point.
4264960	4269120	So yeah, that's where we're at now. Maybe it was road Avenger, SSG 100. Matt
4269120	4272560	was suggesting. I kind of think it started with a T, but I might be wrong.
4273440	4278400	Anyway. I also wanted to call out before we get to, yeah, it was road blast. It was a road blaster,
4278400	4282560	road Avenger. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I was like road blasters was a different game, but I it's okay.
4282560	4288800	It's a different. I think it's in like kind of that universe. Yeah. Road Avenger was the game.
4288800	4294320	Ironically, it was road blaster overseas. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Cause here in America,
4294320	4298480	here in America road blaster was ironically to bring it full circle, the Atari game
4298480	4304240	that had the, you know, you had the lasers and stuff on there. So, um, that, that was
4304240	4308880	an awesome game too. So, all right. Anyway, uh, some other cabinets, I didn't even get to the
4308880	4313120	other cabinets, although these are, these are a little more recycled cabinets, but kinda like,
4313120	4318880	you know, uh, freshened up, uh, with a new retro look, uh, there's going to be a new Atari cabinet,
4318880	4325120	um, that has quite a few games in it. I don't know that game, um, asteroids, asteroid, deluxe,
4325120	4330000	centipede, crystal castles, gravatar, liberator, major havoc, millipede, missile command space,
4330000	4336160	dual and tempest. Whew. That's a very, very stocked cabinet. There is a Bondi Namco cabinet,
4336160	4341200	uh, that will have dig dug, dig dug to Gallagher, Galaxian, Pac-land Pac-Man,
4341280	4347360	Pac-Mania, Pac and Pal, Mappy, Rompers, Super Pac-Man. That's a pretty stocked cabinet as well.
4347360	4353520	And then there will be a Capcom cabinet with 1994, Loopmaster, Commando, Dark Stalkers,
4353520	4359600	Final Fight, Ghosts and Goblins, Street Fighter, Street Fighter 2 Turbo, Street Fighter 2 Basic,
4359600	4370320	and Strider. So that, uh-oh, uh-oh. Uh, there is a new Capcom cabinet and Strider is one of the
4370320	4384240	games in it. One of the Arcade 1-Up machines. Uh-oh. Damn it. I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna
4384240	4389680	have to, I have to leave now because I have to go harass my husband and tell him that such a thing
4389680	4396480	is going to exist. The moment that broke Dark Sakura finally on Arcade 1-Up, I'm just, I'm dying
4396480	4402160	over here. What? Well, there's some, but we were thinking about getting, but I mean,
4406800	4410800	that was, that was me when, when burger time finally happened. God
4410800	4418080	damn it. They find, they got, they got me gal. They already had it in the Final Fight cabinet
4418080	4422000	at one point. Oh really? You know, those were marked down to $50 at one point too.
4422720	4426400	Yeah, I couldn't find them, but I need to, I need to tell husband.
4426960	4430960	Bonds006 says her eyes glazed over when nostalgia. Yep.
4433920	4439440	Uh, Bobby Blackwall says that was me with Star Wars. And then again with Outrun. I think I,
4439440	4444320	you know, speaking of Star Wars, I think I texted Melody when that happened. Cause she's always been
4444320	4448080	huge into Star Wars. One of my good gal pals, Melody. We, I know we've brought up on the show
4448080	4455280	before, uh, married to, uh, Mel B who everybody in DDR knew back in the day. Um, she's really
4455280	4459920	super into Star Wars. And I think I remember a text message exchange where I text her that
4459920	4470160	Star Wars cabinet and it was, that's basically the reply I got. God damn it. It's just, it's the
4470160	4475600	sound of your wallet. Like just a God, just tell me where I got to send the money. We're doing,
4475600	4481920	we're doing all this other shit in my house. But you know what? But is the Strider cabinet
4481920	4489440	one of them? Well, I mean, honestly enough, if we sold like a pinball, we could buy
4490080	4498240	four machines like this, I don't know, maybe four, four or five or six, who knows? But yeah,
4498240	4503920	no, I, I, I, I'm just thinking that if there was going to be one that was to be purchased,
4503920	4509920	I think that Strider might be the one that, that breaks down. Finally broke. All right.
4512000	4516720	I feel like this should be a thing with arcade one up. Like what is your God damn it cabinet?
4517520	4522320	What is the cabinet arcade one up has to announce that's going to make you know, God damn it. And
4522320	4526960	now you got to buy it. Like, like for example, for most, for most people in chat, I'm sorry,
4526960	4532160	for most people in chat, spy Hunter, imagine that because that spy Hunter cabinet, God damn it.
4532960	4538240	All right. So you can check online. Brick seek, for example, is a good place to check for like
4538240	4541920	discounts. So like we've got one in a local Walmart here. They have the
4541920	4547680	moral combat cabinet for 75 bucks. Ooh. Ooh. I kind of see that one.
4549600	4555200	Cause see, it's not that I'd be saving money. I would be losing $75 for games I already own.
4555920	4560480	I would be losing space. I don't have in this house. So I already told you,
4560560	4564640	you could borrow a pinball. I know. I know when we, when we get the new one, maybe.
4564640	4574880	All right. Anyhow, but not theater, but not that one. Damn. All right. You can borrow anything you
4574880	4584320	want, but you can't borrow that. Okay. I would do anything for pinball, but I won't do all right.
4584320	4588400	Forget it. You know what? Let's just get to the classic game of the week before this segment gets
4588400	4595280	ugly. Every week, our soccer steps into the gaming vault and she says, God damn it. It's
4595280	4600160	been a long time since I played this game. I'm like, God damn it. If someone needs to
4600160	4606560	dust in here. It's a classic game of the week. Ironically, the game last week was Strider,
4606560	4611760	although different Strider, but anyway, it's just for you, Rob. Everything is coming full
4611760	4617920	circle on OLR tonight. Anyway, but we have a, we have a fun one tonight. I like this choice.
4617920	4622080	Classic of the week, dark soccer is going to find a game that's 10 years older or more
4622080	4626080	to reflect on fondly. And I think for me, I was like, Oh God, this game is, this game is
4626080	4631920	probably like 20 years old at this point. Yeah. So if you're going by the original,
4631920	4638800	which is where I'm starting. Yes, of course. So the classic game of the week is Cape story
4638800	4647040	or as it was in, uh, in Japanese doc to Monogatari. Um, so it is a, one of those quote,
4647040	4652880	Metroidvania style games. It came out for windows first. This is actually, I think one of the few
4652880	4659280	ones I've done that started off as a windows game. Um, and it was developed by a Japanese
4659280	4666800	developer Daisuke Amaya also goes by pixel. Um, and it's free time. Um, the game is a,
4666800	4675040	a 2d platformer, um, that has those, uh, exploratory elements and, uh, you know,
4675040	4681040	discovery and different characters you, uh, encounter along the way and different
4681040	4689040	branching paths in the story. Um, and it's really one of those, uh, those, you know,
4689040	4694480	when someone thinks of an indie game cave story should really be the first one that comes to mind
4694480	4701200	because it was done by one person. You're right. And it broke through in such a way
4701200	4706800	to like, this was before things like axiom verge and I'm getting to that. Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry.
4708320	4713600	But no, but, uh, it really is the game. I think to the indie game to influence
4714240	4718960	maybe all indie games, you know, in the, in the modern era, you know, if one person can
4718960	4722640	make such an Epic game, who's to say that a couple of friends together can't make, you know,
4722640	4728720	an Epic game. So yeah. So that's where I was really going with that one. Um, and it is a
4728720	4735600	pretty fast paced game. Um, you basically start as a robot named quote, who wakes up with amnesia
4735600	4742240	and must blow shit up and dig and look around and talk to people and figure out who he was
4742240	4751120	and power up and, uh, getting experience and talking to NPCs and, and having doors attack you.
4751840	4758800	Yes, you can be attacked by a door. Um, but I mean, it's a very simple game for how it plays,
4758800	4764880	you know, it's, you know, running, jumping, shooting shit. You've got your HUD, you have
4764880	4771120	your cute little pixely world and everything. And I remember playing, you know, uh,
4772800	4778640	translations of this, like in the early days, you know, but you also do have different, you know,
4778640	4785200	puzzles in the game that you have to solve and, you know, uh, getting through, uh, you know,
4785200	4791680	really like large amounts of enemies in some points. Um, and then, you know, it's also then
4791680	4798560	depending on what you do depends on what ending that you get. Like if you save this one character,
4798560	4806880	you get your memories back. If you, you know, if you don't meet this character, then it's a
4806880	4812880	completely different game as far as how it ends, you know, you, uh, people can, you know,
4812880	4819200	friends can turn into enemies if you don't do certain things in the game. So, um, and I'm not
4819200	4822800	going to, I mean, honestly, it's a, it's a fun game and I didn't really don't want to, want to
4822800	4827840	spoil it, but, you know, it's a game I really want people to go out and play. I mean, it's very,
4827840	4834400	it can be very complex. Um, but the game was actually developed over the course of five years.
4835120	4842320	Um, uh, Pixel, uh, uh, created this when he was in college and worked on it after getting a job
4842320	4847600	as a software developer, he wrote, he started by writing title screen music and just different
4847600	4854480	character movements. And then, you know, the idea evolved from there, um, by him creating
4854480	4860960	enclosed spaces, it kind of took that cave feel. And, um, you know, he said that because he didn't
4861040	4865680	plan it, he did have some problems down the line. Um, cause he didn't have like, you know,
4865680	4871360	map editing tools and different things to manage things, but he was really going for like an old
4871360	4877520	school game, something based off of Metroid, um, and pixel art, he wanted really pixel art games.
4877520	4885360	And so it is, uh, it's really become one of those games that, you know, got passed around from one
4885360	4891440	person to the next and, you know, different things. Um, but then we got later ports of it.
4891440	4899600	We had Linux, um, we had, uh, uh, let me see what the other ones were. So yeah, we had, um, uh,
4899600	4909760	Linux, we had haiku OS, uh, air Ross morph OS, Amiga OS, Mac OS 10, uh, PlayStation portable,
4909760	4915920	Xbox streamcast, Sega Genesis, GP two X, GP two X whiz, TI graphing calculator.
4917360	4920320	I knew this on my graphing calculator for the record. I was, I was like,
4920320	4924240	Sega Genesis. Like I knew about things like the 3DS and stuff where I played it, but I didn't
4924240	4928720	know they, they kind of demade it or, you know what I mean? Like kind of pushed it onto older
4928720	4935600	stuff too. That's pretty rad. Yeah. Um, but there's a, you know, with some of the other
4935600	4942480	versions that came out though, we did get updated an updated version. Um, and that came out, um,
4942480	4949200	on, we were, uh, on March 22nd, 2010 in North America and December 10th, 2010 in Europe.
4949840	4956800	It was also ported to DSI where, um, November 29th, 2010 in North America and the 22nd of November,
4956800	4962160	2011 in Japan, um, that didn't have the enhanced graphics from the Wii version,
4962160	4969680	but it did have the sanctuary attack mode. Um, there is a remake, like a free SDL based version
4969680	4974880	of the game of, sorry, of the game engine called NX engine, um, that people have been using to
4974880	4981760	modify the game and expand upon it. Um, there was also a re-release for the 3DS, uh, Nintendo E-shop
4981760	4988640	and then, um, that version has the DSI, uh, uh, whereas a version of jukebox mode and the
4988640	4994560	additional modes that were included in cave story plus. So, um, that does bring me to cave story
4994560	5002000	plus, which was, uh, it has, um, a different script than the original English version. Um,
5002000	5007840	and it has basically all the various modes from the Wiiware version, the remastered soundtrack,
5007840	5013280	toggling the style of the graphics between the classic and the Wiiware version and the music and
5013280	5019920	all of that has a wind fortress, uh, exclusive level, um, all kinds of stuff. And then you have
5019920	5027360	a cave story 3d, which is a 3d version of the game that was, uh, uh, published for the Nintendo 3DS.
5027920	5033200	Um, and I built back on that, but yeah, it had 3d models and a dynamic camera angle system and
5033200	5040240	whatnot. I personally prefer just straight up pixels. I will play it. I have the steam copy and
5040240	5047520	I really like it. Um, but yeah, this game is, and on top of that, it's, it's a big game. I mean,
5047520	5052320	it's not like, I mean, there's, yeah, everyone's going to speed run whatever the crap they can,
5052320	5058240	but this game is, it's pretty big. It's going to, you know, be something that you'll sit down
5058240	5067520	and play for a little while. Um, but yeah, um, there, uh, there's been other, uh, uh, things
5067520	5073360	to come from this game. Um, the character quote, uh, is a downloadable character in bit trip,
5073360	5080480	uh, presents runner to future legend of rhythm, alien, um, curly brace. Another character in the
5080480	5087120	game is a bonus playable character. And, uh, 1,001 spikes. Both of them are in the crossover
5087120	5093600	fighting game blade strangers. Um, and quote, curly brace and ballast the last fight. Um,
5093600	5099520	they're all available in another game by the publisher, um, crystal crisis, and you can get
5099520	5104880	quotes hat in the game Terraria, but this game is considered really to be one of the most
5104880	5111360	influential, influential games that came out in the, in the aughts. Um, and really the fact that
5111360	5119440	one person could put this game out, it really, um, inspired other people to do the same. Um,
5119440	5124560	you know, one, uh, you know, doujin soft, which is a, uh, a Japanese independent game,
5125200	5132480	um, actually brought back that Metroidvania genre. A lot of people said so, um, and bringing
5132480	5137920	back 2d games as a viable platform when everyone was smack dab in the middle of look at all my,
5137920	5145200	my, uh, polygons is, is so, and, you know, and it also, uh, some of the other games that this
5145200	5152240	one directly inspired are, were braid, super meat boy, Fez, Mega Man 11, even, um, and it's
5152240	5160240	considered really one of the most, uh, influential games. Now, once it was released for free,
5160800	5167120	you know, but the company, uh, Nicholas, uh, that took over the publishing issued cease and desists
5167120	5172480	and DMCA against the fan projects that use the game's assets and the decompiled code base.
5173440	5181040	Um, but, uh, but there were a lot of game developers that really seem to criticize this
5181040	5188160	action, um, to apply, you know, retrospective rights, uh, to it, you know, because they didn't
5188160	5196320	have the original rights on those releases. So, yeah, but anyway, there you go. Awesome game,
5196320	5199360	cave story. If you haven't played it, I highly suggest doing so.
5200320	5204560	Great pick. And like you said, I think, and I was kind of getting into there a little bit earlier,
5204560	5210080	is that like, you know, this game was right on the cusp of when those indie games really just
5210080	5215520	started to be everywhere because of the fact that the game consoles really started to open up to
5215520	5220080	self publishing and that sort of thing. And then we saw more self publishing kind of happen on,
5220080	5225280	you know, steam platforms and, and, uh, PC and so forth, or, or, or the app store, if you will,
5225280	5231600	on the, um, uh, Apple side, you know, there's, this was really like a predecessor to all of
5231600	5237920	that. And I think, you know, there's a little something that all those things are, uh, owing
5237920	5244000	to cave story for sure. Absolutely. Yeah. Great pick. So, yeah, well, I'm surprised I actually
5244000	5248000	hadn't done it because I mean, story is just one of those games that I remember just playing,
5248000	5252800	you know, translated copies of back in the day. Yeah. Uh, as Joe and her mat says,
5252800	5256480	I feel like this was in the early humble bundles. You're probably absolutely right.
5256480	5262080	Humble bundle seven. That's where I got it that late. I would have thought it was his one or two,
5262080	5267280	to be honest. Wow. I believe it was humble bundle seven. No cave story. Plus was a humble bundle
5267280	5272560	seven. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I played plus. That's right. I forgot. Yeah. Same thing. I remember
5272560	5276640	picking it up on the WiiWare or, um, was it, we were, no, it was three DS. I got it on three DS
5276640	5282720	shop. Cause it was really cheap at one point. Yeah. I just had my, you know, my translated copy,
5282720	5288720	my fan translation for the longest time. All right. So yeah. Cave story. All right. Let's
5288720	5295040	move on. We got to travel around the world and get some rapid fire news. Loki. All right. So
5295920	5301680	Hogwarts legacy has been delayed in 2022. Hopefully that'll give you enough time to forget
5301680	5307360	all the things that, uh, the author said, well, she can, she can, the internet has an
5307920	5312640	eternal memory. She can start with an apology, but at least this gives her time to do it, I guess,
5312640	5318400	but we'll, I'm not going to hold my breath. Yes. Basically, you know, they need more time for the
5318400	5326640	game. So 2022 for now. And then, uh, apparently Pokemon snap, since it's coming back brand new
5326640	5333200	game, uh, they'll be coming out on the switch April 30th. And that was announced, um, with a
5333200	5340160	real birthday. Yay. I can't wait to play the new, uh, Pokemon snap, to be honest,
5340160	5344640	it'll be fun about that. Looking forward to it. Speaking of Pokemon and Jason kind of addressed
5344640	5348160	this in tonight's intro. And I think this is, uh, this is like one of those, like,
5348160	5354160	what type of things. But, um, as Jason pointed out in tonight's intro, uh, it's the Katy Perry
5354160	5359680	has been tied with video games before. Uh, she did the Simlish stuff for the Sims. I forgot all
5359680	5364480	about that until I heard tonight's intro. I was like, Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There was a few that
5364480	5369360	were involved with that, but, um, the reason why I'm calling out Katy Perry specifically is because,
5369360	5375040	uh, the Pokemon company has brought Katy Perry in who is well, and who's to say maybe Lily Allen
5375040	5381120	will be there too, because they say Katy Perry is the first in a star studded lineup of music stars
5381920	5388000	that is supposed to work on what's called P25, a collection of artists that are celebrating
5388000	5393680	Pokemon throughout the year. You got, you got Jigglypuff. Who else do you need? Anyway,
5393680	5397840	we don't know exactly like what is Katy Perry doing? We don't know. We assume it's a song
5397840	5404640	for maybe some type of soundtrack. Who knows? Um, anyway, uh, but they, they did announce there is,
5404640	5408480	there is a partnership with Katy Perry. Maybe she's going to host Pokemon idol. I don't know.
5408480	5413520	Anyway. Um, I suppose this is a good point for me to kind of call out to that there is a
5413520	5418800	big rumor going around the internet, um, about diamond and Pearl remakes supposedly being
5418800	5423840	confirmed, although Nintendo hasn't confirmed shit, neither has the Pokemon company, but I guess
5423840	5428240	there is a URL that showed up that has a lot of people kind of going, Ooh. And then of course,
5428240	5433440	one of those like, well, this website said it, so it must be true. So we're all still kind of
5433440	5437600	waiting to see where that ultimately goes. I hope it's true. I'd love to see diamond Pearl remakes,
5437600	5443200	especially with Sword of Shield's quality of life improvements and tie into Pokemon home.
5443200	5450160	That'd be fucking great, but, um, you know, we'll see. Um, you would think we would get them, but I,
5450160	5456080	again, I, I try not to expect anything from the Pokemon company or Nintendo, cause it usually
5456080	5459760	leads to disappointment, but I want to make sure that got called out at some point tonight.
5459760	5464240	Um, one other story I have has to do with Scott Pilgrim versus the world, the game,
5464240	5469280	which a lot of people are being reintroduced to this week, or maybe finding it for the first time,
5469280	5474800	uh, thanks to the remaster that just came out, uh, and due to all the discussion and interviews and
5474800	5480400	things, and people kind of poking away at this game, it was discovered, um, Brian Lee O'Malley,
5480400	5485120	who of course is the creator of, of the franchise, uh, mentioned there was supposed to be another
5485120	5490960	DLC. Uh, it was going to be a DLC that focused on the clash at demon head. Uh, it was going to take
5490960	5496960	place in Montreal and it would actually have envy Adams, Todd Ingram and Lynette guy caught
5496960	5503040	would all be playable in it. Uh, in the end, the DLC was canceled because of budget cuts.
5503040	5508000	So I don't know, they cross your fingers in your toes. Maybe they could make that DLC for the new
5508000	5514800	one. But again, I would not set my expectations anywhere because that always leads to disappointment.
5514800	5520480	Anyway, uh, dark Sakura, what do you have for us? How about what might've been, um,
5520480	5526720	the, uh, super Famicom was supposed to have a back to the future RPG game, um, from what it
5526720	5534720	looks like. Um, it was, uh, there were, it looks like, uh, like a few, uh, shots and some, uh,
5534720	5541920	sprites put out of, uh, doc Brown and Marty McFly. Um, but yeah, there was supposed to be, uh, kind
5541920	5547600	of almost like a Zelda like adventure game, um, for back to the future. Um, yeah, it would have
5547600	5552160	been cool. And it was based on back to the future too. So that would have been, that would have been
5552160	5557600	cool. One of my favorite games was Willow on the NES. And that was like a movie game that was kind
5557600	5562960	of Zelda inspired too. So I love that game. I know a lot of people give it shit, but I love that game.
5563520	5566880	You know what I like better than that version of Willow, the arcade version,
5566880	5570960	the arcade version of Willow was very different. Yeah. Dan and I actually watched a playthrough
5570960	5576160	of that the other day. Um, and we were just talking about how there's these beautiful,
5576160	5582960	like full-size portraits of, you know, of the, the characters in the movie, like, and this really
5582960	5589920	kind of almost disturbing one of Val Kilmer as Badmartigan, but all of that was freaking done in
5589920	5595120	pixels. Can you imagine if that had been in the nineties, can you imagine if that had been in the
5595120	5599120	Capcom cabinet too, if I was like it's Strider and Willow, that would have been like double
5599120	5604240	goddamn it. Right. So, you know, you know, what would be like the perfect, uh, adventure one though
5604240	5610320	would be like three wonders, Strider and Willow. Ooh. Ooh. I'm sure the Willow, you know, the,
5610320	5616800	the IP and all that, cause actually isn't Willow getting some sort of, I don't know, reboot or
5616800	5620800	sequel? Cause that's what every everything is all about now. And I swear there was something about
5620800	5625760	like Netflix doing a new Willow of some type. Yeah. Yeah. Somebody's doing something there.
5626480	5630880	And the thing that's getting me pissed off is that Willow already has a sequel.
5631680	5636640	There were three books that came out. I, I have the books, they're dog-eared and I have read
5636640	5641200	the shit out of them. It was, uh, the first one was called Shadow Moon. They were written by,
5641200	5648320	uh, George Lucas and Chris Claremont of X-Men history. Um, and it was really, really fucking
5648320	5654400	good series of books. And if that came out as like a Netflix series, I would piss myself.
5654400	5659200	Thank you. Everyone in chat is clarifying. It's a Disney plus. So, and that would make a lot of
5659760	5664800	sense because Disney has the Lucas stuff, which I believe this is, was under the banner of Lucas
5664800	5671520	arts if I'm not, or yeah. Right. Or Lucasfilm, excuse me. Um, yeah. I would sacrifice, I would
5671520	5676160	give someone else's right arm for it to be based off of the books. Cause the books were amazing.
5676160	5682880	And if none of you have read those three books, you need to read them. They are amazing. There's
5682880	5688240	like one of my favorite book trilogies ever. I'll I'll find my, my, my copies are actually
5688240	5693440	right over in a box behind me. So I'll have to, uh, to find them. But basically in a nutshell of
5693440	5699280	it, it's sort of like the very beginning of the book is Willow, you know, all wrapped up in his
5699280	5705840	studies and comes to find out, you know, he goes to like magically visit Allura Dannon on her
5705840	5711680	birthday and gave her a little protective bear only to find out days later that, um, that Tara
5711760	5718400	Azleen is destroyed everyone in it, including Mad Martigan and Sorsha. Um, and he sort of goes
5718400	5723920	down a completely different path and, and then he has to raise Allura Dannon by himself with
5723920	5729440	the brownies. Well, and Bobby says the series is 30 years after the movie. Sia Tabiri is with you
5729440	5734320	though, that I wonder if it's based on the novel series. Um, you know what though, if they don't
5734320	5740640	want to bring back Val Kilmer, that could be a plot. I don't know. I want to get, I get what I
5740640	5745680	said earlier. Don't ever get your hopes up. Then you won't be disappointed. And, and this is right
5745680	5749680	at the beginning of the book. So, um, it's not like the biggest of spoilers, but I mean, he does
5749680	5754240	have an interaction right at the book cause he thinks he's dreaming, but he's talking to Sorsha
5754240	5760160	and Mad Martigan and right at the beginning of the, of the thing. But the mo the books are so
5760160	5766320	good. Like I almost, as much as I love the movie, I cannot separate how much I love those books from
5766320	5771120	how much I love the movie too. So I really hope that it's based off of, uh, shadow moon and all
5771120	5774400	of those. Right. Fair enough. Sorry. We got on a Willow tangent, but that's all right. We always
5774400	5779600	have room for that. It was a great movie. Um, and then, uh, and then there was a canceled, uh,
5779600	5788080	Capcom generations, um, that these, uh, screenshots have, uh, been, uh, uh, uh, surfaced
5788080	5796320	and Mike, Oh my God, Chris was involved in okay. Chris Tang, uh, he, um, he was, uh,
5796320	5805120	leading the team for the development of it. Um, and so, uh, basically, um, it was a, uh,
5805840	5814480	action game engine, a proprietary action game, uh, engine that, uh, was, it went into a couple
5814480	5818640	of other failed, uh, pitches that were supposed to go out, but there were different Capcom
5818640	5822960	characters that were playable, such as mega man and Dante from devil may cry, Yoon from
5822960	5829200	street fighters, super Joe from bionic commando. And, uh, it was a little bit of a passion project
5829200	5836240	that never got off the ground, but he's got a playable, uh, uh, prototype apparently. Um,
5836880	5842720	and hopefully we'll get to see it. I might have to just, you know, go bust out. I wonder if this
5842720	5846880	has anything to do with that game that Capcom teased at one point that looked like a Capcom
5846880	5850560	universe type of thing. And like, some people were like, is this like a mega man maker with
5850560	5853600	like street fighter? Do you remember that? They show like a quick little movie at like some E3
5853600	5857200	and then it, it vanished. It was canceled. Never heard from again. It was a Capcom universe or
5857200	5863360	something like that. Uh, I wonder if this was somehow related to that. Oh, just weird.
5863360	5867120	I don't remember. Yeah. Somebody in chat's got to know what I'm talking about.
5867840	5872400	I'm not, I, I I'll, I'll be honest. I, I'm actually kind of curious to
5873120	5876880	just ask him straight up about it. Was it mega man universe? I guess maybe it
5876880	5882240	was mega man universe, but this was like a Capcom generations. Yeah. That's what it was called.
5882240	5884800	Right. Right. But I just remember it because there was some trailer and it had like mega
5884800	5887920	man and then like the characters from street fighter showed up and it was like, what?
5887920	5894960	So I just remember that was a big thing. Anyway. All right. All right. Well, less, less fan stuff,
5894960	5899040	more, uh, reality stuff. What is coming out around the world this week? We're going to
5899040	5903840	travel around the world and check out some release dates and we'll start with the U S and see if,
5903840	5906160	see if things are starting to pick back up again with releases.
5907040	5911200	Um, not a whole lot of stuff coming out, but we've got some pretty big things. So
5911200	5917200	starting off with hit man three on PC, Nintendo's PlayStation four PlayStation five,
5917200	5924880	X-Box one X-Box series X and stadia, uh, ride four on PlayStation five and X-Box series that,
5925760	5933440	and then we have skull, the hero Slayer on PC, and finally bladed fury on Nintendo switch,
5933440	5939680	PlayStation four and X-Box one. And just to clarify for chat before I get to Japanese
5939680	5944960	release dates, this was not the mega man cross street fighter. That was a separate thing where
5944960	5948640	they put like the street fighter bosses into a mega man thing. And that was like a download
5948640	5952720	thing that Capcom did for some anniversary or I don't know what it was, but that is actually not
5952720	5957520	the same thing I was thinking about, but the chat does seem to coalesce on. It was mega man universe.
5957520	5962320	It was like a mega man maker where you could use early Capcom sprites, including like box art,
5962320	5967360	mega man. Yeah. That was it. That was it clearly a different project than what dark soccer is
5967360	5972640	referring to, but I couldn't help but see a common thread there. So I was kind of curious if one kind
5972640	5978320	of influenced the other or what, but they both got canceled, which is a bummer. Let's go to Japan
5978320	5981520	and check out the releases there, which are picking up again. It's been a few weeks since
5981520	5985600	we've had some Japanese releases, but now we're back at it on the Nintendo switch this week on
5985600	5991600	the 21st samurai force Shing and samurai Jack battle through time, both get their releases in
5991600	5996960	Japan this week. Uh, and then quickly looking at the PlayStation five and the PlayStation four,
5996960	6003680	um, FIFA, I'm sorry, FIFA 21 is next week. So I guess it's still pretty slow on the five
6003680	6009440	and on the four this week, we have those same games I mentioned on the switch and that's it.
6009440	6014160	So it's still a little slow. Things really start to pick back up next week though. So
6014160	6020400	especially with the new FIFA, uh, dark soccer, how about the UK? Only two. Um, on the 20th,
6020400	6025360	we have hit man three. And then on the 21st for PlayStation, we have ride four.
6026160	6030800	All right. All right. We're going to get in some more stories and we'll be getting to your emails
6030800	6035920	at participate at orange laundry.com a little later, along with your chat influenced, um,
6035920	6040240	topics and comments when we get into the listener round table, but we have some more stories for
6040240	6046240	your first starting with Loki. Yeah. So this is pretty cool. So there's a brand new campaign
6046240	6053840	that's being created for portal two called a portal to desolation. And if you, if you won't
6053840	6058960	make portal three, we will. Well, the thing is that with valve though, is they they've done this
6058960	6066320	before. Like there's been other like portal, um, like full game, like full, like total conversions
6066320	6071440	that have been put out. Um, so this is not anything new, but, um, I mean, it is something
6071440	6078240	new, but it's been done before. So this is supposed to take place, um, in the eighties
6078960	6085840	and it features there's star characters called Diana. And it has a brand new like cybernetic
6086560	6092560	arm system thing that you have almost looks like a Samus's arm cannon, but it's, uh, it has an
6092560	6098640	integrated, uh, portal device inside of it as well called brace. And it looks pretty cool. They have
6098640	6103200	like a little teaser trailer out there that shows like one of the first, like, um, kind of one of
6103200	6107680	the puzzle levels that's in the game. And I really liked the vibe and it kind of reminds me though,
6107680	6112720	they have like a lot of, uh, you know, uh, the transitions between screens are almost like half
6112720	6119440	life two or half life, I think actually. So, uh, pretty cool. It's been in development for three
6119440	6124880	years already. Um, no word yet on what's expected to be out, but I mean, if they're teasing it
6124880	6130320	maybe relatively soon, maybe it will be a kind of thing where like, if I already own portal too,
6130320	6135920	then I can like kind of grab this. Yeah. I think what it is, if it's anything like the other,
6135920	6141680	uh, portal, uh, campaign that they've had out there, you basically have any source engine
6141680	6147920	game. You can play this. Oh, interesting. Okay. All right. Well, moving on, let's talk about some
6147920	6152800	of the other announcements at CES, although some of these weren't really intentional because some
6152800	6158080	of these got revoked. And what I'm talking about is that Sony actually had a keynote. And in that
6158080	6162800	keynote, they address some upcoming games for the PlayStation five and kind of detailing what to
6162800	6167600	look forward to on PlayStation, but was what was interesting is that there were, there was just a
6167600	6173200	few frames of some text that had some copyright specifics that gave more information as to when
6173200	6179520	some of these games were coming out. For example, Square Enix's project Aethia coming out January
6179520	6186320	2022. If you take this splash screen, literally, which again, it was, they went back and they took
6186320	6190640	it out of the trailer. Uh, they kind of like re-uploaded it or whatever. So they probably
6190640	6194400	did not want to be married to any of these dates, especially things that are really far out,
6194400	6199840	especially with the pandemic's future still uncertain, um, and all that. So, uh, I can see
6199840	6202880	why they went back and changed it, but it was interesting to see some of the things that they
6202880	6208080	were thinking or that, you know, might be, you know, kind of what to expect, uh, ghost wire,
6208080	6215280	Tokyo and stray that game with the cats that got her his attention 83, both October of 2021. Again,
6215280	6220640	if you put all your stock into that screen, hit man three was a part of that presentation and
6220640	6227760	said January, 2021, which that part was pretty locked in, um, solar ash, June of 2021,
6228320	6235280	Kena breed bridge of spirits, March of 2021, little devil inside July, 2021 horizon,
6235280	6239200	forbidden West. They didn't give a month, but they did say late 2021. So,
6239200	6243520	and that's not too surprising to hear. That's probably Sony's big game for this year.
6244400	6250480	What I thought was interesting though, pragmata also had a date 2023.
6252560	6257440	So some of those games you're going to be waiting a little while, but I mean,
6257440	6262960	that's pretty typical though of Sony. How many years do we wait for like among us or not among
6262960	6271600	us? Um, okay. Last of us to remember that E3 where like they just owned it. Like they, they
6271600	6277120	made, they literally made everybody cry because back to back was like final fantasy seven is being
6277120	6283920	remade. Shenmue three is real. And there was another big one. Oh, the last guardian is coming
6283920	6291440	back. I think we're all in the same like thing. Um, that, how long did those games actually take
6291440	6297920	to happen a very long time? And that's, you know, that's Sony's thing and Hey, it works for them.
6297920	6303280	By the way, if you want to believe rumors and I do believe this one, uh, speaking of the final
6303280	6308480	fantasy seven remake, there's another rumor going around social media that the PC and PlayStation
6308480	6312640	five version is coming out later this year. And that would not surprise me one bit. What
6312640	6318400	surprises me is the Xbox and Microsoft is left out. Um, there must be some interesting reason
6318400	6323200	for that, but I'm not surprised. I said that on the show, not that long ago. And it doesn't,
6323200	6327920	it doesn't take a genius to figure that out. That absolutely square is going to rerelease that on
6327920	6332160	PlayStation five and get its money all over again. Hell yeah. And then of course, a lot of people
6332160	6338480	are waiting for the PC version so you can mod it. So if you want your nude mods and whatever else,
6339280	6347040	you know, have at it. There you go. Anyway, uh, let's move on. Let's talk about another
6347040	6351760	old game, dark soccer. Well, more like other people talking about an old game.
6352560	6358640	So, um, I don't know how many people, you know, listening like video game documentaries, uh,
6358640	6364240	we're certainly big fans of them at my house. Yeah. Um, so there's going to be one about NBA
6364240	6374800	Jam. Um, yeah. And I mean, and it was like, you know, the nineties were the heyday of,
6374800	6382880	you know, of like the NBA franchise, right? We had space jam. It was all about Michael Jordan.
6382880	6391360	Um, and so we had NBA Jam and those, those, uh, you know, we had it in my, in my arcade,
6391360	6394880	you couldn't walk by without hearing a boom shakalaka every so often, you know,
6394880	6400640	he's on fire. He's on fire. Yeah. I don't talk about sports games a lot, but NBA Jam,
6400640	6405680	I will tell you that was an incredible sport. That was like probably my second favorite sports
6405680	6412800	game ever next to sports game. Cause it was unrealistic. So actually, yes. And I mean,
6412800	6417600	and I remember, you know, finding the, uh, the, the, the different builds of it where you could
6417600	6422160	play as the mortal combat characters in it and everything. Remember? Yes. Because the NBA wasn't
6422160	6427680	happy about that. Oh yeah. And you could play us on bill Clinton, who was president when that
6427680	6432160	came out. And I believe some Republican equivalent was also in it, you know, like,
6432160	6436880	so you could do political wars and things like that in NBA Jam. I don't think the NBA was happy
6436880	6442240	about that at all. And that'll probably be in the documentary. Well, the thing is, is that the NBA
6442240	6447920	almost never gave them the, you know, the, uh, license for it. Um, I mean, they couldn't get
6447920	6454000	Michael Jordan. He wouldn't let midway use his name or likeness. Um, you know, the licensing
6454000	6460640	agreement, you know, basically the NBA had a really poor, uh, opinion of arcades in general.
6460640	6465360	Um, but it turned out to be one of the most successful, uh, uh, video game franchises. I mean,
6465360	6469840	there are how many different releases came out. Um, did I ever do this as a classic game? I don't
6469840	6474240	think you did reference. You have to look at the Wiki, I guess, but, um, and it has an arcade one
6474240	6479840	up cabinet. Yeah. Yep. Cause of course it does. So, but, but even so, I mean, what we're getting
6479840	6484960	all this kind of love and resurgence back. So I think it's a great time for a documentary about
6484960	6492720	NBA Jam. Um, I mean, I have the Saturn copy of NBA Jam, the PlayStation ones. We have so many
6492720	6498800	releases. The Saturn one was kind of the hard one to get ahold of. Um, uh, but I mean, it was,
6498800	6505680	it was super, super fun. And then, you know, in a twist, the rumor is that, uh, Michael Jordan
6505680	6511920	actually had a modded copy that put him in the game after all. Huh. Um, that's a rumor,
6512560	6520000	you know, but Hey, you know, it's on fire. It's going to be, uh, going to be a, uh, a fun thing
6520000	6525360	to watch. I think I'm really, because I want to just, I want to see more about like those
6525360	6532240	different builds of the game because I, I played early builds of this when I was in, uh, in high
6532240	6541440	school, actually. Um, Zen monkey 11 and chat says the new NBA Jam is NBA 2k street too. You know,
6541440	6547040	I think that's not NBA Jam. Well, and, and I think they've tried to replicate the success of
6547040	6552560	the original several times because there was an NBA Jam on the Wii or the 360. Like they tried
6552560	6559200	to revive it. It was a 360. They've tried to do it several times and nothing really quite had the
6559200	6564480	fire of the, literally of the first go around. Like that just wasn't the same. And yes,
6564480	6569280	absolutely. NBA, the street, like I, again, I don't talk a lot about sports games, but I know
6569280	6574560	enough that those street games are to try to get that more arcade style magic. It's almost like
6574560	6580240	Forza Horizon versus Forza Motorsport and how Horizon is the more kind of like arcade type
6580240	6585920	of game. It's, it's kind of like that with the NBA street and the NBA, but, uh, I, nothing is quite
6585920	6591920	just put that magic in the bottle quite the same. So, but it's also in the eyes of whatever you
6591920	6596560	like. I'm not saying they're a bad game either. If, uh, you know, it's, it's enough of the magic
6596560	6601040	for you and you enjoy it with all the new bells and whistles and stuff go off. Those games are
6601040	6608320	for you. So it's pretty cool. All right. Um, anyhow, let's move on to another story. I think
6608320	6616240	Loki you're up. All right. So let's talk a little bit about, uh, more delays. This is not surprising,
6616240	6625280	really. I mean, we're still aware that COVID is a thing. So when originally, um, Nintendo and
6625280	6630960	Universal Studios Japan announced that they were going to be opening Super Nintendo World, uh, in
6630960	6637920	Japan in February 4th, that's not really going to happen because of the state of emergency that it's
6637920	6645600	been declared in Osaka. So now it's been delayed. They haven't announced a new date yet. They will
6645600	6653120	once the state of emergency is lifted because of COVID-19. But I mean, this is, it's a pretty
6653680	6657600	common thing that we're hearing now with different delays, especially when we're talking about
6657600	6662720	outdoor theme park. Yeah. I wonder if they won't delay the Olympics again. I know they kind of,
6662720	6667120	the Olympic committee kind of put their foot down and said these Olympics are happening in 2021,
6667120	6673360	COVID or not. I don't know if I believe it, but then again, by the time we get to June,
6673360	6678400	you might think, I mean, they might be doing the Olympics in a audience free stadium and they'll
6678400	6683040	make sure that it could be a very different looking Olympics. Um, and they'll make sure
6683040	6687680	all the players got vaccinated or whatever, but, uh, it could be interesting. We'll see.
6687680	6692480	So, I mean, these are still, I mean, I remember in the early days of the pandemic when we thought,
6692560	6695840	it'll just be a couple of weeks. And then, you know, here we are.
6696480	6699760	So I would like to point out, I did not think it would be a couple of weeks.
6700960	6704320	Yeah. Well, I don't like you being right on this one.
6705520	6713360	Well, me either. So, um, well, let's just fingers and toes crossed that maybe now we're getting
6713360	6719360	some competent leadership coming in this week that yes, the car will, it's not going to be
6719360	6724080	automatic. It's not going to be automatic. Well, my wedding anniversaries this week too,
6724080	6730240	you might remember I got married the day before. Yeah. So our four year anniversaries this week,
6730240	6735920	uh, uh, Tuesday actually. So yeah, kind of funny how that works. Um, but anyway, yeah, I mean,
6735920	6740160	obviously the car is not going to turn around immediately, but at least hopefully we will be
6740160	6744800	on a path. I mean, they're talking about, what was it like a hundred million vaccinations in a
6744800	6751440	hundred days. Let's hope we'll see. All right. And thank you for the kind words in chat. Appreciate
6751440	6756560	it. All right. Let's move on to one more story for you guys. And this has to do with the ESA,
6757120	6763280	uh, which, you know, has, has had some issues in the past couple of years, but, uh, this one is,
6763280	6767760	is pretty clear, especially with all the recent, you know, uh, things that are going on in the
6767760	6773200	political world. Uh, the ESA has halted political donations, and this is something that's kind of
6773200	6779040	happened across the board because, um, what happened at the Capitol, uh, was, was not good.
6779040	6785520	And I think that's about the simplest way I can put it. And it's having ramifications for a lot
6785520	6791840	of people. And so the ESA, yes, our industry, the entertainment software association, the group that
6791840	6798080	puts on E3, uh, they are stopping political donations due to what happened at the Capitol
6798080	6802960	building and all of the fallout from that saying in a statement, given the events and actions that
6802960	6808400	led to the violence at the U S Capitol, we are pausing contributions from the ESA PAC,
6808400	6815120	as we reflect on the tragedy and our path forward. Uh, just so you know, the ESA has donated both to
6815120	6821920	Democrats and Republicans since 2012, but it is interesting to note it's usually Republicans.
6821920	6827520	The larger share has gone to that, but that also probably ties into who was leading the
6827520	6834840	ESA for a long time. I do your own research and come to your own conclusions, I suppose. Um,
6836400	6843280	so anyway, um, the ESA, by the way, has, uh, just because they have donated to some, uh,
6843280	6849120	Republican folks before it doesn't mean that they have always, uh, embraced everything that, uh,
6849120	6855920	soon to be former president has done. Uh, for example, the ESA in 2018, when our president
6855920	6861520	decided to call Haiti and African nations, shithole countries, uh, the ESA came out and
6861520	6867440	said that it was repulsive and that that backward thinking has no place in society.
6867440	6873200	And that would be one of the cases where the ESA was absolutely correct. Uh, unfortunately they
6873200	6877920	don't always get it right when it comes to things like how to run E3, but, uh, or the things they
6877920	6883200	tweet, but you know, you, you take the little victories where you can, I suppose, or as Phoenix
6883200	6888720	77 26 puts it so eloquent eloquently in chat, took those fuckboys long enough.
6894240	6900160	That's why we have a live chat room. All right, let's go to our listener round table,
6901920	6906640	uh, where you guys can send us emails, participate at orange lounge, radio.com,
6906640	6911120	or if you want to ask us some questions, don't ask about fuckboys though. If you want to ask us
6911120	6916640	questions, uh, or what have you in chat twitch.tv slash vog networks, the place to do it. Uh, let's
6916640	6921520	see, do we, do we have any emails tonight? Nope. So it's drag race talking. So I haven't watched
6921520	6926560	any of it this season yet. Um, if, Oh, that's where I can talk about drag race again. Okay.
6926560	6930080	So since you didn't send emails, we get a little bit of drag race talk and all I will say is that
6931040	6936160	okay. I'm not going to, I w we don't do spoilers here, but I will say you need to watch this most
6936160	6943280	recent episode and understand why we all stand to Misha Iman. We stand her there. That is the
6943280	6948160	only option period because, and I didn't know this until just this past week. Okay. So everybody
6948160	6957360	knows, and I don't, I don't care if you're gay, straight, bi, pan, eh, any of it, you know,
6957360	6963760	that video of the best drag queen entrance of all time, right? Uh, where the it's holding out for
6963840	6969360	a hero and the drag queen falls from the ceiling into the splits. Y'all know that, right? Yeah.
6969360	6973680	Right. Everybody knows that one. And, uh, her name was Tandy Iman Dupree, I think was her name.
6973680	6980480	I'm so sorry if I'm getting it wrong. Um, that is Tamisha Iman's daughter, drag daughter, basically.
6980480	6985440	Uh, she passed away. If you didn't know that the drag queen in that epic video passed away,
6985440	6990800	um, a few years ago. Uh, but it's her drag mom is on drag race right now. And she is
6990800	6996560	all the royalty you would expect her to be. So there's some, yeah, there's some very standable
6996560	7002800	people on drag race right now. So there's that. All right. Participate at orangesontrader.com.
7002800	7007120	If you have some emails, um, or I guess you want to email us about drag race. I don't know.
7007120	7011760	All right. Uh, and I'm looking in chat for questions. We don't have a lot right now,
7011760	7016160	but, um, in absence of that, I will ask Loki if we have any last minute stories.
7016480	7023040	Um, there's one thing, so I was going to mention, there's a free game you can check out on steam
7023040	7030720	called six seasons in a game. It is basically a paint ball recreation of Greendale community
7030720	7036240	college from community. And you can play that and play paint ball in there. Perfect. Just like in
7036240	7042800	the show. So yeah, six seasons in a game, free on steam, uh, dark to see in chat coming up with a
7042800	7048080	question since drag race came up, came up. Has anyone seen AJ and the queen on Netflix?
7048080	7054480	Bonus bit of trivia. Roo's roommate apparently plays a prominent role in cyberpunk 2077. Roo
7054480	7060720	has a husband, not a roommate. He's in cyberpunk. What do they do? They fracking? Well, I don't
7060720	7068480	know. Anyway. Um, Oh, Oh, Oh, in the show. That's right. Roo did have it. You're right. Okay. Sorry.
7068480	7074800	I was thinking IRL Roo's roommate in the show. Yes. Um, was like, uh, I remember I did see a
7074800	7078720	couple episodes of the show, but it was kinda, it was kinda bad. Sorry. It was kinda, it's,
7078720	7085360	it's like guilty pleasures. It's a guilty pleasure TV, I guess. So, okay. Okay. So the roommate in
7085360	7092320	the show is in cyberpunk. That makes a lot of sense. So, all right. Uh, Loki, any more last
7092720	7101280	minute stories? Um, no, that's pretty much it is important things. All right. Well, I guess we're,
7101280	7105040	we're a little early, but we're at the end of the show. We don't have a lot else to talk about.
7105040	7110000	January is still a slow month. What can you do? Um, thank you guys so much for listening to our
7110000	7113680	show tonight. Uh, we appreciate you guys participating along with our show, whether you
7113680	7117040	were here with us live on Sunday night, or you were listening throughout the week on our podcast
7117040	7123520	feed available where great podcasts are found such as Spotify, iTunes, and so forth. Um, you
7123520	7128240	can leave us a nice review wherever you found this show. We really appreciate those. Or, uh,
7128240	7133120	just tell us, tell a friend or two about the show. Um, word of mouth is the best thing we have to
7133120	7138240	spread word of the show. So those of you that have spread the word by telling your friends,
7138240	7143280	we really appreciate that. Um, those of you that do auto hosts a VoG network on your Twitch
7143280	7149120	accounts, we really appreciate that as well. Um, so yeah, any, all of that stuff we, we super,
7149120	7155280	super appreciate. Um, and, um, let's see what else. Oh yes. The shop. Uh, if you want to,
7155280	7159760	uh, help us out, uh, in the monetary sense, you don't have to, but it does go a long way and you
7159760	7165440	can get some merchandise, vognetwork.com slash shop. If you want to get an OLR t-shirt such
7165440	7170880	as the one that Loki's wearing tonight or a VoG network shirt or an OLR sticker or a Bobby mug and,
7170880	7174400	and more to come throughout this year, we'll be adding some more merch to that shop,
7174400	7179760	vognetwork.com slash shop. All right. I was going to close off the questions,
7179760	7183520	but since we're a little early, I'll let one more sneak in here after the buzzer,
7183520	7189680	especially because he paid to highlight it. DJ Rama S says, uh, what are y'all's guilty pleasure
7189680	7196160	video games? Guilty pleasure games. See, I would consider Final Fantasy 14 one of them,
7196160	7200560	even though I think that is a good game. That is like a game I keep going back to,
7201280	7207200	um, no matter what a guilty pleasure game. Earth Defense Force. I don't feel guilty about
7207200	7214800	anything I play. I mean, I'm playing all, I'm playing all of my, all of my things that I enjoy
7214800	7222080	playing. You know, I've got patterned. I have my stupid word game. Wardscapes. I just started
7222080	7228400	playing that too. I love it. I'm so good at it. That's that. That's the one where you swipe the
7228400	7234240	letters as in a crossword puzzle. I just got into that this week. I would, I would live for that
7234240	7237440	playing words with friends too, to the point as like, I'm actually really bored with boards
7237440	7243760	with friends too. I only like doing those puzzles. And so I've played, I played completely through
7243760	7251280	a whole other game just like this. I beat, I beat it. And now I'm on, what am I on for this game?
7251280	7260160	I'm on level, uh, 1,841 and I just made a 20th place in the current tournament.
7260160	7265840	So good for you. Yeah. I'm also, I'm also 20th place, but I think it breaks,
7265840	7270320	breaks you into groups of a hundred or something like that. Yeah, I think it does. Yeah. So,
7270320	7274880	I mean, but I really, I really enjoy, enjoy this game. I wonder how many levels it has
7274880	7280320	before I'm done with it, but it was enough that I paid to get no ads. Oh, okay. Nice.
7280880	7285280	Yeah. I would say a lot of those cell phone games end up being my guilty pleasure games,
7285280	7291600	you know, cause you know, cell phone gaming isn't real gaming, but it is. Um, and so there's,
7291600	7295520	there's a lot of, I would say a lot of that stuff falls into the guilty pleasure category for sure,
7295520	7302720	for me. Um, those word games, uh, thanks to the, um, uh, reality game I was talking about on last
7302720	7306640	week's show, they got me into a game called stacked or something like that. That's really
7306720	7311600	addicting. And it's just a very simple, stupid game. Uh, playing that a lot. So yeah, a lot,
7311600	7317280	pretty much anything on my phone is a guilty pleasure game. Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says P cross.
7318240	7324720	That's a good one too. I may throw out, um, uh, maybe hot to full boyfriend just because I fucking
7324720	7330240	love that game. I love how to full boyfriend. Sometimes the game is so ridiculous. It's still
7330240	7337520	pretty good. Yeah. Well, I mean, and it goes there. It goes dark. So yeah, I would say mortal
7337520	7342960	combat is in that category. I'm not as big on the newer ones, but the older ones to me are kind of
7342960	7348320	guilty pleasure games like mortal combat two specifically, I think is a guilty pleasure game
7348320	7353600	for me. There you go. Rama. See, don't say I don't love you. I let you squeeze in the last minute
7353600	7357760	question there. All right. Uh, now we're going to go through the motions of wrapping everything up.
7357760	7361600	Thank you again for listening to the show. I won't repeat everything I said before. Um,
7361600	7365600	but, uh, thank you again to everybody who's listening, whether it be, uh, live or on the
7365600	7370720	podcast feed, we really appreciate your support. Um, we'll be here next week to do it all over
7370720	7378240	again. Um, I hope everybody has a great week, happy gaming, um, and, uh, stay safe, stay, uh,
7378240	7382960	far away from any place where you could potentially catch COVID and maybe we will get to the other
7382960	7387520	side of this after all. Um, so let's go around and get final thoughts. Uh, Loki,
7387520	7392160	I'm gonna start with you at your final thought tonight. Um, just have to work more of my games
7392720	7399600	and also, uh, still want to stream some more Minecraft. Yeah. Uh, and my final thought is
7399600	7404800	I will really push myself to do a stream this week. That is not final fantasy. I'll probably
7404800	7409840	stream that too, but I want to do like DJ max. I keep saying I want to do a Tetris effect stream.
7409920	7414320	Now that we're getting these pixel poops codes, I'm asking why, why are, can we stream this or
7414320	7419840	do you want me to wait? So I'm hoping to stream something, uh, this week that isn't just final
7419840	7427120	fantasy. So there's that last but not least dark soccer. Um, please look at the pinned post on my,
7427120	7434160	uh, Twitter it's at dark Sakura. Um, I have a go fund me for a long time friend of the show and one
7434160	7441200	of my longtime friends. Um, and the only person who has donated since I put out that call is
7441200	7446960	someone who doesn't even listen to the show. So anything, if you want me to pick a game
7446960	7454720	and I'm going to extend this, you know, another, another week for, for donations, but, um, $10
7454720	7464400	as a vote, $50 gets you, uh, uh, I'm going to put it this way. Uh, if you do, uh, $10 is a vote,
7465120	7471120	$50 would be a hundred votes and $500 will be an instant game choice as long as I own it.
7472320	7479360	So, um, I'll, I'll put it in the chat room and, um, but it's, it's in one of the pinned,
7479360	7486400	uh, post on my, on my wall. All right. Well, with that, we hope you guys all have a good week.
7486400	7492240	We will see you in seven days to talk about more gaming. Stay safe. Have a good one. Good night.
