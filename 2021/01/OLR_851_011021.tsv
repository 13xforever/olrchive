0	12360	I'm a big fan of making something good out of a bad thing.
12360	15800	And in the spirit of popularity, diversity, meaning and frequency of use, Twitch is going
15800	19000	to rotate PogChamp emotes once every 24 hours.
19000	21800	This feature doesn't have to last forever, but it's going to be a good change-up of
21800	22800	the formula.
22800	25920	And hey, it'll be a lot better than those astroturfed Prime emotes they gave us after
25920	27160	TwitchCon.
27160	28160	This is just my hot take.
28160	31840	It's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to explain more on this
31840	35160	and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where every gamer has
35160	36160	a voice.
36160	43560	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back.
43560	49640	It's another week of Orange Lounge Radio, live once again on this Sunday night for the
49640	56520	second time in the year 2021, with episode number 851 of our show for this January the
56520	58360	10th of 2021.
58360	64320	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
64320	70760	Hi, Jamie, I think you're muted on Discord, just so you know.
70760	71760	Technical issues.
71760	72760	They happen.
72760	73760	I thought I had myself unmuted.
73760	74760	I guess I must have hit something.
74760	75760	That's all right.
75760	76760	Hi.
76760	77760	Hi.
77760	78760	How are you?
78760	79760	Okay.
79760	82100	You were telling me before the show, and I hope you're willing to talk about it on air,
82100	85680	you made a new friend on Twitter in the gaming universe, right?
85680	87920	I did.
87920	91520	And I've been following him for a while, and actually just having a little bit of back
91520	92520	and forth chat.
92520	95800	We talked about mics for a little bit, kind of what led to me, I think, buying the one
95800	96800	that I did.
96800	97800	Oh, nice.
97800	103040	But Tommy Earl Jenkins, who is the voice of Die Hard Man, really, really just cool dude.
103040	105000	In the game Death Stranding, for those who don't know.
105000	106560	Yeah, in Death Stranding, sorry.
106560	110760	But I've tried to check out some of his other stuff.
110760	115600	He's honestly, I think, one of my favorite voices in the game as well.
115600	122000	But I like when I get to connect with people like that and just talk shop, I guess, sometimes,
122000	126640	and just talk about real life and do real people stuff.
126640	128240	It's kind of a thing.
128240	130800	I don't get super starstruck, I guess.
130800	132660	Yeah, me neither.
132660	137200	But I like getting to know people.
137200	138300	I totally get it.
138300	143440	It's the pros and the cons about Twitter, is that it makes celebrity culture and some
143440	147720	of those people that you admire and even people that aren't necessarily gigantic celebrities,
147720	151400	which with all due respect, I would put the voice actors on that level where they're not
151400	158240	like Tom Cruise or a huge movie star or whatever, but they're known in certain circles or contestants
158240	159240	on Drag Race.
159240	160240	They're known in certain circles.
160240	165840	So they get a lot of people able to tweet them directly, which is a good thing and it's
165840	166840	a bad thing.
166840	170760	Obviously, we know there's a lot of disgusting Twitter culture that happens with that direct
170760	176200	accessibility such as people who bully other people and tag things and things that are
176200	178160	completely unnecessary.
178160	183560	But I think as Twitter and those types of services, Facebook, social media, is getting
183560	187000	more ingrained in our culture, people are getting more like, okay, I'm just going to
187000	188000	block haters.
188000	192700	I'm going to mute haters and able to filter that out a little bit, yes, a little better.
192700	197180	Not that it ever excuses that type of behavior, but I think people are learning how to deal
197180	198680	with it a little more.
198680	203200	But the plus side of that, we talk a lot about the negative side of that, and I know Twitter
203200	208720	and all that is a hot button issue this week, and I'm going to try to walk around that.
208720	215740	But I think part of the positives about Twitter is that for those people in very smaller circles
215740	219180	that might not be known to a lot of people, to tweet somebody a small little compliment
219180	223940	like, hey, I loved your work, I'm curious, what kind of microphone do you use?
223940	227280	That is awesome that you can just go to the source and ask that question.
227280	231360	One thing to keep in mind, nobody owes you shit and you might not get an answer.
231360	233380	You know this, Dark Saga, but I'm saying this for everybody else.
233380	237640	You might not get an answer from somebody, but when you do, it feels really good and
237640	239200	it's really cool, right?
239200	244360	And over the years, many of you, I know we hear it a lot, we're not famous.
244360	248900	We do the show a long time, doesn't mean people know who we are.
248900	251220	We're known to certain people in certain groups, right?
251220	252300	It's that same type of thing.
252440	258320	When you guys reach out and tweet me or Jamie or Matt or whatever, and say, this is awesome,
258320	259800	or hey, thanks for doing OLR.
259800	265120	In fact, somebody sent me a tweet this past week just saying, oh man, when you were talking
265120	269180	about the Guardian legend, I so agree with you, that game needs to come back, something
269180	270180	along those lines.
270180	271960	I was kind of talking about that.
271960	276280	Even though that makes me feel really good and validates what we're doing here at OLR
276280	278880	to have a pleasant exchange like that.
278880	280500	I live for that shit.
280500	287880	When you ask, how have you done OLR for 18 years, however old we are, 18 years, interactions
287880	293140	like that, just people wanting to talk cool about video games and keep that going, that's
293140	294140	my feel.
294140	295140	So it's...
295140	296140	I'd like more of that.
296140	297140	Yeah.
297140	298140	Oh yeah, of course.
298140	303180	We have to remember, we're not that big, but I love for the audience that we do have and
303180	304380	the interactions that we have.
304380	309780	So that I'm sure applies to the voice actors that you've interacted with over the years
309780	312740	on Twitter, for sure.
312740	320300	And I've actually made some really good friends just running in some of those same circles.
320300	326060	For me, honestly, I've actually found it to be a lot less toxic of an environment lately,
326060	329200	especially since the...
329200	330200	We all know.
330200	333620	Undesirable population have been...
333620	334620	We all know.
334620	335620	Yes.
336460	341060	But I've also found...
341060	346860	And I don't know what this is exactly, because people are posting this stuff.
346860	354580	Doomscrolling is a thing, it exists for a reason, the phrase, but I've noticed that
354580	362160	it's a little bit more inundating on Facebook because people...
362200	367000	It's in a compartmentalized area, I guess, if that makes sense.
367000	375160	And people are more just likely to make a bunch of comments on it, whereas on Twitter,
375160	379340	I think it's kind of harder to see some of the comments.
379340	385920	And you can mute the thread, and now you can remove...
385920	389400	When people reply to it, you can ask them to remove you from it.
389400	390400	Yes.
390640	392960	Finally have that limiting who can reply feature.
392960	395320	Well, I don't know if Bobby Blackwolf ever did get it.
395320	398760	He might be the one person on Twitter without it, which sucks, sorry, Bobby.
398760	404220	But I think everybody on Twitter, other than Bobby, has this feature where you can limit
404220	407480	to certain replies, and that's a great thing too, I think.
407480	410280	Because sometimes I wanna post something and be like, I'm just gonna say this, get this
410280	412200	out in the universe, get it out of my brain.
412200	413920	I don't wanna talk about it after this.
413920	417960	And it took way too long to come to Twitter, and I'm happy it's there.
417960	419740	Aw, Bobby still doesn't have that feature.
419740	421300	I don't know what's wrong, bro.
421300	424140	I haven't even looked for it.
424140	425140	It's there.
425140	426140	Maybe you don't have it either.
426140	427140	That would be strange.
427140	428140	Oh, I see it.
428140	429140	I have it.
429140	430140	So yeah, you can...
430140	432020	People you follow, only people you mention, everyone.
432020	433020	It's great.
433020	438340	So anyway, we gotta introduce everybody here on the show that our folks out there like
438340	441380	to follow, and that includes Techmaster Loki joining us tonight.
441380	442380	Hello.
442380	443380	Hi, Loki.
443380	444380	How are you?
444380	445380	I'm doing okay.
445380	446380	Good, good.
446380	447540	What's the game playing behind you tonight?
447540	449960	I can't quite tell.
449960	450960	Is that Zelda?
450960	454500	You don't recognize it from AGDQ?
454500	455500	I'm trying to...
455500	459620	No, I can't, because I can't see the main character in it, because you're sitting in
459620	460620	front of him.
460620	461620	Your head's in the way.
461620	462620	Yeah, your head's in the way.
462620	463620	I can't tell.
463620	464620	What did it...
464620	465620	Just tell me.
465620	466620	Is that I Wanna Be The Guy or something?
466620	469660	It's Epic Dumpster Bear 2.
469660	471980	Oh, it sure is.
471980	472980	Okay, okay.
472980	476980	I admittedly tuned out right before that run started.
476980	477980	But nothing.
477980	481980	I loved AGDQ, but just trying to live my life too.
481980	484820	So yeah, okay, I got it, got it.
484820	489200	Speaking of awful games, but with a wink, how is development of Pixel Poops number two,
489200	490200	your game going?
490200	492260	It was kind of slow this week.
492260	495900	I did work on some animation stuff, so I was drawing a dog.
495900	497460	Yeah, and you know what?
497460	499900	Now that I'm asking you this, I know we talked about this on Twitter where it's kind of one
499900	500900	of those...
500900	504180	We all had a lot on our minds this week, so I think we all were a little slower this week,
504180	505180	and that's fine.
505180	511860	Yeah, it was hard to get motivated to do more intensive stuff like that, so I played a lot
511860	516860	of Minecraft instead, literally doing just chores.
516860	523460	It's like, oh, I gotta go fix this path so it looks nicer, or, oh, hey, we're low on
523460	524460	these supplies.
524460	526380	I'm gonna go mine for a while.
526380	528040	Just stupid stuff like that.
528040	532500	I think everybody had to do what they needed to do for their mental health, and admittedly,
532500	537500	I did not watch the entirety of Bobby's hosting run on Wednesday because I could not tear
537500	538500	myself away from the news.
538500	542740	I just physically could not do it, which probably wasn't the greatest thing for my mental health,
542740	544420	admittedly, but it is what it is.
544420	548620	You put Twitch up on the TV using one of your consoles and take out the iPad.
548620	551900	I know, but I'm so bad at multitasking.
551900	552900	Normal people can do that.
552900	553900	I can't.
553900	554900	I don't know what it is.
554900	560220	Let's not have you ever test out any more iterations of that for YYR.
560220	561220	Right?
561220	567260	Yeah, I'm not very good at doing pixel art, so it was surprising.
567260	573260	It was very challenging just to get a four frame walk animation with a dog into such
573260	579700	a small sprite, and it ended up turning out okay.
579700	584120	So anyway, but yeah, I was gonna mention it later in the show, but hell, I'll do it now.
584120	587340	Big congratulations to Bobby Blackwell and the entire crew.
587340	591400	It's much more than one person, but obviously we're partial to our buddy who we've been
591400	594900	working with here on Sunday nights for what, like 15 years, probably more.
594900	599580	I literally have so long I've lost track and helping with the hosting and helping to raise
599580	600940	money for a great charity.
600940	603900	I have a story on it later in the show, so you're gonna hear it twice, but I think it
603900	610300	was something like 2.7 million they raised for prevent cancer foundation via AGDQ.
610300	614780	And the fact that everything is virtual and the fact that they had to compete with all
614780	617980	the crap going on in the world is pretty stunning.
617980	623380	So big ups to the speedrunners, the hosts, the producers, the behind the seniors, everybody
623380	626900	and everyone that made that happen, because it was a beautiful charity thing.
626900	630300	So congrats, that's for sure.
630300	635340	Anyhow, let's get into our show and the things we want to talk about tonight.
635340	638180	So it's a little bit slower of a news week.
638180	642260	We do have some things to get into, but obviously coming off of the holidays, there's not a
642260	644220	lot of big game releases.
644220	648180	The hype machine hasn't started for 2021 just yet.
648180	652620	Consumer electronics show is coming up this week, albeit very, very different because
652620	655340	of the world, I'm sure you all know.
655340	660700	But CES would be about the first point where we start to get some actual gaming, big gaming
660700	661740	ticket items.
661740	663820	So it's still a little slower this week.
663820	668020	So this, and we'll get into what news there is coming up a little bit, but this is a good
668020	672900	time for us to continue to kind of reflect not just on the last year, which we did last
672900	675500	week, but what's ahead, which is what we're going to do this week.
675500	680220	So we have to do this virtually tonight because usually what we would do is Dark Soccer, Loki
680220	685540	and myself would write on some little scraps of paper and we would fill up Mr. Vader here
685540	686540	for the podcast listeners.
686540	690660	I'm holding up a little tin that looks like Darth Vader, but it's more cylindrical.
690660	693660	And we're going to lock him in this little time capsule and we're going to read him at
693660	697560	the start of next year and laugh at how bad our predictions were.
697560	701840	And I think I left the one about Half-Life 3 in here just because that's going to be
701840	704200	in there every year I've decided.
704200	707280	All right, until the end of time.
707280	712280	In fact, honestly, bury me with this so somebody can find the sliver of paper in a thousand
712280	715760	years that says, did Half-Life 3 ever fucking happen?
715760	720260	All right, moving on.
720260	721260	Let's get into some...
721260	722260	Rob.
722260	723260	What?
723260	725800	If it ever does come out, then we need to have a ritual burning.
726320	727320	Oh, of the paper?
727320	728320	Of the paper.
728320	729320	I'm down with that.
729320	731000	Let's bring a little fire to Orange Launch Radio.
731000	732000	That sounds safe.
732000	733000	All right.
733000	735520	We're chanting to the tune of an ABBA song.
735520	736680	All right.
736680	738560	Burning things to the songs of ABBA.
738560	743480	That sounds like a segment on Understation Live or something, but anyway, let's get into
743480	744480	2021 predictions.
744480	746560	So we're going to do this virtually this year.
746560	748120	I'm going to just kind of know everything down.
748120	749120	I'll print it out.
749120	752580	We'll put it in there for next year and we'll do it that way.
752580	755820	So I'm going to go around and see some of the host predictions for this year.
755820	759380	And then we're going to go to chat and get some of yours because we do tape live over
759380	764620	at twitch.tv slash vog network, the voice geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network
764620	768660	every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby
768660	769860	Black Wolf show.
769860	771900	So let's get into some predictions.
771900	773260	All right.
773260	774460	I will start.
774460	775460	I'll do my first.
775460	779220	I never go first in these segments, so it's time for me to go first.
779220	784060	And I'm going to do this one first because I knew I wanted to say this as a prediction
784060	788740	and then some, some leaks came out today that are going to make it look like I'm leaning
788740	789740	into this.
789740	792740	So you guys are going to have to trust me that I was thinking of this before the leaks.
792740	793740	Okay.
793740	795460	And I don't think the leaks are necessarily true.
795460	797900	I'm going to explain how my predictions a little bit different.
797900	799980	I want to talk about switch pro.
799980	801220	Okay.
801220	807200	My prediction, my prediction that I'm writing in is that Nintendo switch pro ain't all that.
807200	812560	Now it doesn't mean it's going to be bad, but it's not going to do 4k handheld gaming.
812560	817600	And I don't really think it's going to do like, like, I think it will support 4k and
817600	822400	the way that PlayStation pro supported 4k, but I don't think it's going to be more powerful
822400	827240	really than it certainly is not going to be as powerful as PlayStation five or Xbox series
827240	829380	X, a hundred percent.
829380	830800	It'll probably upscale that.
830800	831800	I think either.
831800	832800	Yeah.
832800	835720	And I know the leak talked about upscaling, which honestly hadn't come to my mind, but
835720	841200	I was thinking like interface menus, statics, things like that would probably be 4k, but
841200	844880	I don't think the games themselves are going to be as 4k as you want.
844880	846200	It doesn't make the games worse.
846200	847520	Nintendo still makes great games.
847520	851640	I'm just saying, I think a lot of the pipe dream people have in their heads about 4k
851640	856600	breath of the wild part two, I don't think that is going to be a reality, but I do think
856600	859720	we will get a switch pro holiday.
859720	861660	I don't think it's coming any sooner than a holiday.
861660	864300	And I think they're going to do it that way to time it with breath of the wild part two
864300	866300	is one of the release titles for it.
866300	869420	So that's my first prediction for 2021 for sure.
869420	872020	So all right.
872020	876260	And looking in chat, act def says you're stealing one of my cohost predictions that the switch
876260	879940	pro ain't pro and more like a 1.3 version of the console.
879940	883020	You know, again, with the leaks today, I think a lot of people are going to be leaning into
883020	887760	that a little bit, but it's more of those things that the leaks make sense, I think.
887760	889860	So I'm kind of piggybacking on it.
889860	895420	I don't necessarily know if I buy the up sample everywhere part of that.
895420	900500	Like I kind of think that's why I'm not totally leaning into those leaks, but I think elements
900500	902500	of it are right.
902500	907500	So, all right, anyhow, let's talk to dark soccer.
907500	908500	Why not?
908500	909500	What's what's up?
909500	910500	Did I really?
910500	911500	Yes, you did.
911500	912500	I, you stole mine.
912500	914640	That's exactly what I was going to do.
914640	915640	I'm sorry.
915640	916640	So no, you're not.
916640	917640	You're right.
917640	918640	I'm not.
918640	919640	Well, what's your other?
920420	922420	What's the next one on your list then?
922420	929440	Well, I said that some kind soul is going to make me a game featuring possums.
929440	931480	Did dark soccer get a possum game?
931480	936640	Yeah, I need a game with possums.
936640	941120	In 16 bit fashion.
941120	942120	Now so much.
942120	945700	Sorry, I'm quiet, but I'm typing these out as as they're being sick because I have no
945700	948060	advanced knowledge of what these predictions are.
948480	949820	Now, what about the old adage?
949820	953920	If you want something bad enough, you got to do it yourself ain't doing shit.
953920	954920	This is a prediction.
954920	959540	So I'm predicting that somebody is going to be really nice to me and do me a possum adventure
959540	960540	or possum platformer.
960540	963980	It isn't like rocket night adventure.
963980	968040	It's a possum on four legs doing possum things like you have to find trash.
968040	969040	I like that.
969040	970040	And you make friends.
970040	971580	Possum things.
971580	974180	Do something awesome today.
974180	976360	And he has to make friends.
976360	978320	My possum has to make make friends.
978320	981600	He has to have a mama possum who has lots of babies.
981600	987440	And then has to make friends with a raccoon who is literally named trash panda.
987440	991160	And a skunk.
991160	995240	And it's gonna be an active just named it's gonna be called be possum today.
995240	997240	I just said that.
997240	1002480	That's what you're saying I take the name is called be possum today.
1002480	1003480	Okay.
1003880	1008600	Someone has a yeah and like for Norris says he has to eat ticks for energy.
1008600	1014200	Kate catastrophe and Chad says awesome possum kicks Dr. Machino's butt.
1014200	1019400	That's actually I think like a real thing is it really yeah it's awesome possum that's
1019400	1023240	what I'm like trying not to be I want it to be a little four legged possum that jumps
1023240	1029740	up and platforms and has to find garbage and scream at people it's power to stuns its enemies
1029740	1033360	by screaming at it you want a literal garbage video game.
1033400	1039640	I want a garbage video game starring a possum okay and if someone will make it for me I
1039640	1045040	will write the entire story for it I just need I need I need this I need this to be
1045040	1052620	my game of 2021 well you could do it like like epic dumpster or after epic dumpster
1052620	1058360	bear does it's all unity assets I don't like that kind of game though I want it to be like
1058360	1065840	a like a like a Sonic ish kind of game you know jumping on platforms and climbing things
1065840	1071340	and not like doing the midair spins and stuff like that I just want I just want to jump
1071340	1077080	around and eat garbage now since dark Sakura has availability on her list because I ruthlessly
1077080	1082940	stole one of her answers without knowing it chat if you have some predictions why don't
1082940	1086980	you start yelling them out in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog networks that dark
1086980	1093760	soccer can steal one of your answers sound like a plan all right I love her she'll come
1093760	1098800	up with something else I want him to go fast I want him to walk really funny hey moving
1098800	1102960	on we got three hours show we're not going to talk about possums for two hours two and
1102960	1111480	a half hours all right speaking yeah speaking of going fast okay Microsoft is going to quickly
1111480	1120940	acquire Sega in 2021 okay this fan wank rumors been going around for like four years why
1120940	1127740	why and how low key to it even more because they got to figure out how to get in on the
1127740	1137900	Japanese side of the house and honestly they're not gonna purchase Konami so say it is okay
1137900	1143520	good prediction my next prediction I wanted to throw something in for the Intellivision
1143520	1149220	amico because I think a lot of people are going to overlook that this year and my prediction
1149220	1153520	for 2021 would have been one of my predictions oh my bad well you maybe maybe yours will
1153520	1158760	be different because that it would be overlooked oh well no no that's actually not the prediction
1158760	1164760	my prediction is a little bit opposite I'm gonna say the amico will do okay it's certainly
1164760	1168960	gonna have better success than the VCS but I don't think and I'm willing to say this
1168960	1175540	I don't think it's gonna tank as hard as a lot of internet people want to think it will
1175540	1180700	I think the amico will do okay and what I mean by that is that like it's not gonna be
1180700	1186840	like oodles and oodles of cash but it will it will break even enough to pay everybody
1186840	1191260	salaries that worked on it and a little little extra chunk of change for a future project
1191260	1195520	and it's gonna do it's good it's gonna be all right and that's that's my guess for amico
1195520	1199660	but I think it will survive I think it will be supported through all of 2021 I think they
1199660	1203220	will I think with the April release they will continue to push it more and more through
1203220	1207060	the holidays and I think it's something that won't be able to be gauged on its release
1207060	1211060	right out the gate I think this is truly something we have to evaluate at the beginning of next
1211060	1214600	year when it's been on the shelf through a holiday period that hopefully looks a little
1214600	1220280	more like a normal holiday period than this last year did so so I'm sensing a theme with
1220280	1227000	Robin and 2021 it's just gonna be okay it's not gonna be great you know I'll be terrible
1227000	1231180	just okay around Wednesday I was like this is gonna be another shitty year and then on
1231180	1241040	Friday I was like actually 2021 showed up today and said I think the fuck not so anything
1241040	1249380	I 2021 anything can happen 20 roller coaster and it just been like a week 2021 it might
1249380	1255720	be kind of possum speaking of which dark Sakura do you have another prediction for
1255720	1263560	the can a serious one sure so even though my possum one was very very serious I'm not
1263560	1271620	joking about it I think that we're going to see online communities move off of things
1271620	1278000	like just standard internet and smartphone platforms maybe not a move but we're gonna
1278000	1287420	see the new big social media network be in-game networks where I like where you're going with
1287420	1292940	this gone you can so you can be involved in it kind of like have like think of PSO for
1292940	1297820	a moment right mm-hmm imagine that you were in your lobby and PSO and you chat with people
1297820	1301380	in the lobby and you can then chat with your group while you're in your game right you're
1301380	1307820	like even in Wow but you also have an observer mode where you can join in on other people's
1307820	1314200	games as an observer and and follow cam with like one of the characters who you know one
1314200	1319600	of the people that someone's playing okay sorry sorry I don't mean interrupts but something
1319600	1324540	that comes to mind because it I'm not saying it exists but it's bubbling under the surface
1324540	1328320	because I've heard about this and so maybe this is the type of year that it comes through
1328320	1331720	there's a thing called clubhouse and you can only get in with an invite right now so I
1331720	1335280	don't know a lot about it and I know Twitter is trying to launch competitor to it but it's
1335280	1341260	like these audio chat rooms that are set up for people to discuss certain topics and they
1341260	1346140	might be serious like social things that need to be discussed like you know being black
1346140	1350460	in America might be one of these rooms and you you can draw and with dark soccer when
1350460	1353380	you talk about eavesdrop you don't necessarily have to participate you can eavesdrop in other
1353380	1358100	conversations like that's the type of thing that clubhouse and the new potential Twitter
1358100	1361980	feature is supposed to allow you to do now again these haven't really taken off yet they're
1361980	1366080	still kind of because I think the big question still has to be answered how do we moderate
1366080	1371220	this because this could be a nightmare in in trade but you're kind of taking this one
1371220	1377000	step further into games and I think that's kind of cool exactly and it basically also
1377000	1387340	will go into the realm of things like say eSports for example like you can sell tickets
1387340	1393640	to an event and you all sign it kind of like actually how stage it does their things where
1393640	1403040	you not necessarily like a bid but you I'm trying to think of how to phrase this like
1403040	1407240	you know you do like you pay for however much the minimum is for your ticket you can tip
1407240	1412620	more if you want to and then you can attend a virtual concert inside a game environment
1412620	1417300	or it takes to like a live stream of something but it's all done through our various game
1417300	1423600	gaming consoles and I think that one of the selling points for future consoles is that
1423600	1429340	this would be an integrated thing that all of them use for cross console watching and
1429340	1434200	for a lot of you know like say if you're on a PlayStation and you go to watch somebody's
1434200	1440920	game on an Xbox for example do you of course will get ads or you might have to have like
1440920	1447320	pay for an extra tier of account for cross-platform gaming in a cross-platform chat or something
1447320	1456200	in a small way you're almost describing PlayStation home but like 2.0 like next like evolution
1456200	1460400	type of thing I get where you're going because I think I actually like the more you explain
1460400	1465740	your idea the more I'm kind of like I get it because there's a lot again a lot of things
1465740	1470800	bubbling under the surface you talk about the virtual concerts Fortnite has put its
1470800	1475020	foot in the water and dealing with those we just haven't seen something like that gel
1475020	1481940	together where it's like Fortnite is known as the virtual concert space like it hasn't
1481940	1486700	gelled together in a big way yet and I think if I'm hearing right you're saying this is
1486700	1492900	the year it comes together in a big way for some tech company or even you know extended
1492900	1499500	into like a you know like an internet thing where you can you know live stream whatever
1499500	1503100	the game people are on or you have it through steam when you can join in on your game that
1503100	1511660	way too but I'm thinking of making it something that's just beyond just an online social media
1511660	1516240	thing and have it be an integrated network and then you know now I think like future
1516240	1521340	down the line where you like plug into this thing like the fucking matrix and live in
1521340	1525940	it I guess or you know I don't know that would be that would be a little bit crazy
1525940	1531700	but it's just sort of where I'm going for certain things I guess I want to think of
1531700	1543180	something that's going to have longevity and it's hard for me to describe exactly that
1543180	1549380	but I want it to be something that would go forward yeah no I get it I think it's a great
1549380	1553340	addiction let's let's write it down see what happens maybe if we don't see something fully
1553340	1557320	realized we might see though you know kind of kind of check in on how are some of these
1557320	1561800	things growing that I'm saying or like you know they're kind of bubbling under yet and
1561800	1566320	I know chat I'm looking at you know Bobby Black Wolf is saying VR chat alt space VR
1566320	1570120	big screen I'll do these kinds of things but you don't need VR to use them yes but and
1570120	1575600	so does Fortnite but none of these places are like the definitive you know spot for
1575600	1581040	this type of stuff nothing's quite gelled together in that sort of way yet and I think
1581040	1584660	especially coming off of this pandemic and I talked about some of this on last week show
1584660	1590560	how my work is looking at moving into a an environment very very similar to those types
1590560	1594160	of things I'm not going to get too detailed because I it would be wrong of me to give
1594160	1600000	all the details but it's like a similar thing and I think I think that could evolve into
1600000	1605800	some type of like known as a social media platform for all of that and I and a wider
1605800	1610840	adoption of one of those or maybe a couple of those things so it'd be interesting to
1610840	1615400	see for sure one of my other thoughts is actually expanding something like this into a business
1615400	1620800	environment as well because you know zoom by itself is one thing but if you have like
1620800	1628540	a virtual meeting room you know you and I need to talk off air okay it's it's it is
1628540	1637380	out there I can tell you so yeah but again how widely adopted yeah how why everybody
1637380	1641840	knows zoom not everybody knows these other things yet this might be the year we find
1641840	1648340	out anyway for time let me go ahead and move on Loki what is your next prediction my next
1648340	1653020	prediction is that volition is going to announce the next Saints Row game I know it's being
1653020	1659400	worked on they just have to announce it safe prediction but a good one it's about that
1659400	1664620	time right yeah exactly well they've already committed or I've already commented that they're
1664620	1670960	working on one just you know what is it when is it you know yeah so you're saying this
1670960	1676500	year is the year for Saints Row beyond a tweet saying yeah we're doing it months yes obviously
1676500	1680220	I don't anticipate they'll come out this year all right I would like you never know you
1680220	1686220	never know you never know all right my last prediction so here's my real crazy one I've
1686220	1691220	always got to have a crazy one in there so my last prediction that I have is twitch is
1691220	1697300	going to get another viable competitor because I think you know twitch is kind of not gone
1697300	1703620	very checked by a lot of you know yes there's YouTube YouTube doesn't lie to monetize as
1703620	1710980	easily as twitch does and some of these others and I'm gonna go so far as to say I think
1710980	1718660	the shot is gonna come from Twitter I think Twitter is going to launch a twitch competitor
1718660	1723500	and I think because we know they have the technology from their acquisition of periscope
1723500	1729460	I'm not sure that has really leveraged a lot for them but I don't know it's just it's just
1729460	1734420	what my gut says so I'm gonna go with it I feel like twitch might be the ones or excuse me Twitter
1734420	1739820	might be the ones to take a shot at what twitch has going on and we're not gonna talk about
1739820	1747620	Facebook gaming we don't validate it all right let's dark soccer were you able to find a third
1747620	1759300	one I think that we're going to see gaming in and of itself become and this is gonna be a
1759300	1768460	very safe bet but I think we're even gonna see it perhaps surpassing professional sports as a big
1768460	1776540	moneymaker in the US economy it might already be there I I don't think it's coming that way that's
1776540	1780180	why I said this one's pretty much safe you're right this is a safe bet game mostly this year
1780180	1785860	games will continue to make money and a lot of it but you know what you know what this is an
1785860	1792340	industry that has always assumed a safe path and it hasn't always worked out that way 1983 called
1792340	1799940	and said hello right so and I want to say there's been prior years where maybe not us but other
1799940	1803380	shows I've listened to has gone so far as to say there's gonna be another video game crash this
1803380	1810100	year so you're doing the opposite of that you're saying gaming's in a safe place we're gonna
1810100	1815420	continue to make money we're gonna it's it's gonna continue to be mainstream and it's gonna
1815500	1819260	get to the point where because and you know you talk about sports and I think especially with
1819260	1824020	the pandemic and everything going on where more people can't go watch sports now again we hope
1824020	1832140	that at the end of 2021 it's not like this anymore or it's it's on that path to what we remember but
1832140	1839260	I I get it I I think yeah I think I think yes it's a safe pick but I don't think it's a complete
1839260	1847420	100% guarantee go ahead it's not necessarily just going to be the fact that it's going to be these
1847420	1851980	big and I'm on purpose not looking at chat by the way so if anyone say anything about it I don't see
1851980	1858180	it not really I think I think that what we're even going to see is we're going to see the breakup of
1858180	1866260	some of the bigger studios into like kind of how we were seeing in real life how some of the big
1866260	1873260	stores are failing in response to the boutique the rise of the boutique again I think we're gonna
1873260	1879100	start huh sorry I was finish your thought because and I have to read a chat comment because you are
1879100	1883580	on the exact same page as someone else in chat and I'll read that here in a minute but I think
1883580	1888780	that people are going to realize that with these smaller studios that they're getting even better
1888780	1894220	quality because it's not just oh we got to make all this money blah blah blah they're gonna be
1894220	1898940	doing it with crowdsource with a lot more crowdsource backing and when these little
1898940	1903220	studios grow they're gonna employ more people they're gonna put more money into the economy
1903220	1909860	we're really going to see the growth of true competition and have it not just big be you know
1909860	1914820	the the first title Nintendo's economies the Capcom's you know it's there they're already
1914820	1919020	losing their traction so I mean Nintendo is always going to be Nintendo they live in their
1919020	1926940	own universe and they don't count but we're gonna see the indie developer the single developer start
1926940	1933620	expanding a bit more but without losing the things that make us love them and they're going to be a
1933620	1939460	bigger contributor to that economy okay so which chatter do I think you're extremely aligned with
1939460	1948260	here in chat our very own Bobby Blackwell when I said here no here's when our own when I said
1948260	1954980	that comment about the video game crash in 1983 he replied if there's a crash it'll be triple-a
1954980	1960860	games too many people can make video games now that video games will still exist even if the
1960860	1964900	triple-a companies crash and I'm definitely hearing the common denominator between that
1964900	1969780	and what you just said yeah yeah but I mean I don't think we're gonna see the big the big ones
1969780	1976380	crash I really don't but I think they're not going to be as important you're gonna see a little more
1976380	1982420	of an equalization I think is a good way to put it the big lower the Indies come higher because
1982420	1987660	that's been happening very slowly in this industry ever since Xbox Live Arcade launched and steam
1987660	1995300	started having a lot more games on it and I I even sort of changed the one I was going to do
1995300	2000460	because I thought I was gonna do that you know we finally get another Silent Hill game blah blah
2000460	2006780	whatever but I was thinking about that and I was thinking we have really amazing games come out
2006780	2014900	from people who were in those I guess triple-a company universes who broke off on their own and
2014900	2021100	did their own really big game you know they had the backing for it it was considered a triple-a
2021100	2025940	title but I'm referring more to the triple-a studios you know for example Kojima breaking
2025940	2033620	off so those are just you know kind of what cemented that thought in my head so it's kind
2033620	2039700	of a it's a serious one and we're gonna still see that economy growing and employing more people but
2039700	2045260	I think it's not gonna be the big companies that are the driving force so before we get to Loki's
2045260	2049500	third prediction I'm gonna add a chat prediction to the list because it's a little a little bit
2049500	2053540	adjacent to what dark soccer is talking about but separate enough I think it's worthy of being added
2053540	2060380	here and I'm gonna give it to SSJ 100 Matt and put in the jar for this year that says there won't
2060380	2067380	be a video game industry union but there will be a massive dev lockout that will help trigger
2067380	2077180	towards that so we're gonna finally see the damn burst what's that that is true so but it's a
2077180	2081580	prediction you don't know it might maybe they will unionize by the end of the year or maybe we're
2081580	2086740	just gonna have the the event that leads to that still I like that a lot as a prediction it's a
2086740	2090340	little bit adjacent to what you were just talking about but not quite the same thing so yeah for
2090340	2094140	sure anyway guys keep those predictions coming sorry some of them have scrolled off the screen
2094140	2099340	if you had a really good one that I missed put it back so I can pick that up because we'll get a
2099340	2105740	couple more in there meanwhile let's check out Loki's last prediction so my last prediction is
2105820	2113340	gonna be that despite how unlikely it will be there will be a new Silent Hill announcement
2113340	2121540	this week or year not this week that'd be too soon this year I know it's completely unlikely
2121540	2129660	and never gonna happen but crazier things have happened so and I apologize because you cut out
2129660	2136300	there for a little bit I had some problems with my earbuds so I had to listen to the TV you you
2136300	2141040	are going so even though dark soccer just said I thought about doing Silent Hill you are doing
2141040	2148220	Silent Hill and say yes it is happening something safe like oh you know Microsoft will incorporate
2148220	2155420	Xbox Live gold in the games past that's just that's just too safe so I'm gonna do that all
2155420	2161260	right let me get to some other good ones in chat let's do a cup pull a couple of these from chat
2161260	2167220	these are good let's decide which ones of these we want to put in Zen monkey 11 says I have two
2167220	2172860	predictions Facebook will create its own PlayStation Plus Xbox gold type of service so users can play
2172860	2177780	their oculus games without having to log into Facebook if they want to play offline second
2177780	2183900	rockstar will announce GTA 6 but it won't be called GTA 6 oh that's a good one I like that
2183900	2190740	one act deft oh I really like this one e3 is a hundred percent done and it's never coming back
2190740	2201260	I like that one that's a bold-ass prediction let's do it help me with the dead air guys
2202260	2209180	that goes in the jar I like that I agree with Bobby they're not gonna ever and unbundle oculus
2209180	2214580	from Facebook because you know Facebook likes to collect all the data I could see them doing
2214580	2220300	something similar though too I think vibe does this with their library right now where you can
2220300	2225540	get like kind of a path to some of that stuff but I could see them doing something similar with you
2225540	2231060	know the oculus like if they haven't already I swear that there's something out there I've seen
2231340	2237580	advertisements for paying for something you get access to a library of VR games so I don't know
2237580	2247100	yeah I think that is by port so sure why not that's easy all right why by our suggests mine
2247100	2253180	is that Nintendo just hold off sorry mine is that Nintendo will cave to investor pressure and keep
2253500	2261540	3d all-stars on sale past March I think you're half right I don't think it's because of investor
2261540	2268180	pressure but I think the gag will be that it comes back after they have already pulled it
2268180	2273540	like in great Disney way I think it comes back before the end of the switches lifetime but it
2273540	2279820	won't be this year I don't they're gonna do some shenanigans shenanigans will be afoot I'll leave
2279820	2287780	it at that this is a pretty gutsy one from SSG 100 Matt saying Sony PlayStation Plus library will
2287780	2295020	rival game pass when it drops a massive library of PlayStation 1 through PlayStation 3 games at once
2295020	2303340	I feel like that's the fan talking the fan wank the Twitter demanding person talking but I that's
2303340	2309660	PlayStation now though that's what they're trying to sell PlayStation now with hmm oh I like this
2309660	2317060	one from business lamp hi there by the way who says um Google stadia has a surge in popularity
2317060	2321460	you know we're really quick to laugh that off I think in the beginning because of you know we've
2321460	2328820	had a lot of criticisms of stadia but cyberpunk change the game I think not only though that is
2328820	2336220	just because the other versions so bad I don't think that's necessarily like all you need is
2336220	2344260	one all you need is one to hook them in no all right all right all right I think I I think it's
2344260	2349660	a good prediction all right um let's see I had some other ones here okay shad stars ik our buddy
2349660	2356140	Shane playing it extremely safe with the safest prediction I've ever seen super giant will follow
2356140	2361900	up Hades with another amazing game maybe like a first-person shooter mixed with a farming sim I
2361980	2368260	don't know and it'll gain critical acclaim and further cement them as the best indie dev out
2368260	2374820	there I think that's definitely the fanboy and Shane talking but I love the I I love the idea
2374820	2387860	of SPF PS meets farming simulator right I love that um let's see what was one there was one more
2387940	2393180	about Animal Crossing in here and I think it was from Sia Tabiri Sia Tabiri in chat says Animal
2393180	2399940	Crossing New Horizons will by the end of the year provide a way to have a secondary place for
2399940	2406620	second-tier animals you don't have room for on your island similar to the pocket camp cabin oh
2406620	2411380	is that like the Pokemon go eggs you to hide them in a different place we think about that the
2411380	2420060	Animal Crossing the island of the undesirable redemption island is what it is right Animal
2420060	2425660	Crossing redemption island where they have to partake in challenges and only the greatest it's
2425660	2431940	the only time to the death it's the only time that twist will be good all right I'm gonna you know
2431940	2436420	what fuck it I'm putting it in the jar Jamie's not here at the moment she stepped away for a
2436420	2443180	moment so I'm gonna sneak it in when she's not looking Animal Crossing redemption island
2443180	2452660	all right perfect there we go that's enough you guys all had great predictions you know what there
2452660	2457340	is nothing stopping you oh well our folks there is nothing stopping you and especially those are
2457340	2462380	listening on the podcast feed you have a jar somewhere you have a piggy bank that's unused
2462420	2468300	you have a piece of Tupperware somewhere put your predictions that down down right three of them put
2468300	2473460	them down lock them away in a in a thing that you're not gonna look at until next year because
2473460	2477020	I'm gonna ask the listeners again those that decided to actually do this and make their own
2477020	2483500	time capsule I want to know what you got right when we do this again next year so we'll talk
2483500	2490340	about that in chat in one year's time all right dark Tetsuya said redemption and island is that
2490340	2496820	like a survivor thing yes look at least I didn't say Animal Crossing island of the idols okay I
2496820	2504780	knew not to go there okay okay all right anyway all right that's some good predictions we'll see
2504780	2508900	I will print that out cut them up and put them in the jar later again I have to do this virtually
2508900	2514460	this year because we're not all able to do this in studio I think the biggest 2021 prediction I'd
2514540	2523180	like to really hope will come true is that in 2021 we are back to recording in person that is what I
2523180	2529420	would love to see happen in 2021 we're back in person we have vaccines we're able to do this
2529420	2537540	shit in person and yeah all right so good I like the act F says I made a Google spreadsheet that's
2537540	2543220	fine that's a good way to do it I I if you want to do your own virtual time capsule that's fine
2543220	2549580	too a file you don't look at for a year all right anyhow let's get into our gaming weeks
2549580	2553740	let's talk about our gaming weeks and what we've been playing so I'm usually I would start with
2553740	2557580	dark soccer she stepped away for a moment so I'm gonna go ahead and start with Loki how was your
2557580	2566540	day sorry I didn't play a ton of stuff this week it's been mainly Orna and it's been minecraft I
2566540	2576420	finished a lighthouse in the redstone with that I finished tidying up some stuff and then because
2576420	2582660	my kids kept saying they were making secret bases I made a secret base so they'll never find it you
2582660	2587820	need to do a video tour to supplement for our audience here who wants to see some yeah I kept
2587820	2593060	thinking about doing streaming stuff for that and it would be fun there's a lot of people that do
2593180	2598260	their survivor multiplayer servers and stuff that's really a lot of fun if you have a lot
2598260	2605660	of people that are streaming playing with you then you can just keep going on there but yeah
2605660	2610580	I should probably do that I've been thinking about it that was a good good little bonus content thing
2610580	2616700	all right I see dark soccer is back at her chair so if she doesn't mind me calling on her oh she's
2616700	2619780	getting ready to eat something so maybe I will do my gaming week and then we'll come back to
2619780	2636060	our soccer you want to go okay it's just okay pudding pops all right I'm laughing but I'm not
2636060	2648100	meaning to I'm sorry but it's just like oh god the misfortune I'm sorry I was also my exfoliating
2648100	2653980	face stuff too so my throat now has ground-up coffee that was God she's telling you you got
2653980	2666460	a nasty mouth you clean up your act pudding all right how is your gaming week um it was okay I
2666460	2674700	mean mostly I really didn't play a whole lot of anything in favor of watching a GDQ I played
2674700	2681060	Animal Crossing of course patterned has new things out and so I've been playing patterned
2681060	2690860	again because y'all know I love that game and I have other things that I'll need to ask of our
2690860	2696980	listeners when we're done with this segment all right we'll come back to that I'll get into my
2696980	2700900	gaming week okay I've been waiting to tell you guys about this one because I know you're gonna
2701020	2706700	tease me and I totally deserve it but I do want to talk about this a little bit so do you remember
2706700	2713020	about a year and a half ago I played an o RG an online reality game an org and I won you remember
2713020	2716940	that and I talked about that and I called it it's funny that we got into survivor jokes earlier
2716940	2722380	because I called it a survivor LARP you remember that whole thing well I haven't played anything in
2722380	2729500	quite a while but for the last two weeks I actually have plant been playing another one
2729540	2735580	but I was playing in secret because it was an anonymous game at meaning the people in it did
2735580	2741420	not know who each other were now hold on to your butts because if you think me talking about
2741420	2748060	participating in a survivor LARP is the nerdiest thing you've ever fucking heard wait wait lay
2748060	2757340	these and gentle them wait because I've got more the anonymous org that I was participating in was
2757340	2764820	based off of the television show Schitt's Creek where we all had to roleplay various members of
2764820	2771620	the Schitt's Creek community I want you to keep in mind I've seen the show Schitt's Creek four times
2771620	2777060	I think it's a hilarious fucking show I you know that the things I've watched I've enjoyed it y'all
2777060	2784300	know I just play so many video games I hardly ever have time for TV so I was playing this game and it
2784500	2790060	was it wasn't totally survivor it was like Big Brother and it was all like it was a bunch of
2790060	2794420	psychological games like all mishmash together it was pretty intense for the two weeks things
2794420	2798580	like that I'll give you an example for example it'll be like okay the eight people that are left
2798580	2803740	in the game you have a gold medal a silver medal and a bronze medal you can give one of these
2803740	2808820	medals to somebody else in the game the gold's worth five the silver is worth three the bronze
2808940	2814740	is worth one whoever has the least amount of points at the end of this will go up for eviction
2814740	2820380	like the bottom three or something like that will go up for eviction so that is that was like what
2820380	2824980	it was and so it was like a little games and there was one I will tell you where my video gamer ass
2824980	2831300	blew everybody away one of the games was we got to play Tetris a mobile but yet take a screenshot
2831300	2837580	of a Tetris game y'all I smoked the competition in Tetris and I played it one time thank you
2837580	2844580	Tetris effect my 2019 or 18 game of the year for all the practice with Tetris that when I played
2844580	2850980	the played it on the phone it was not a problem for me and that was a lot of fun so pixel pocket
2850980	2857860	says wait so it's Schitt's Creek RP mixed with survivor game yes this is the sixth or seventh
2857860	2863980	circle of nerdom hell that I and it was so much fucking fun like I have to tell you people were
2864020	2870980	really into their characters and the chat is dying to know were you Moira no I was not Moira
2870980	2877820	in fact unfortunately unfortunately Moira and I were very much on strategical opposite sides a
2877820	2883460	great person I'm sure but in the context of the game strategically we were just like completely
2883460	2889420	opposite sides which is funny because the character I was assigned was Johnny Rose or
2889500	2895820	Eugene Levy in the show so my wife and I fought the entire game basically but the like the show
2895820	2901180	well yeah you pretty much sort of well the hilarious thing I had a tight alliance so the
2901180	2908900	Alliance was me Jocelyn shit and Ted the veterinarian who I think dates Alexis or
2908900	2916420	something in a story arc and Robin Robin is Moira's wig in one of the episodes early on
2916420	2923940	so this is the Alliance that pretty much owned the game right to the end of the game and there
2923940	2928140	were other alliances and things like that but you know we were for the for the final five basically
2928140	2934020	so we were kind of in cahoots with Patrick another character so this is the nerdiest fucking thing
2934020	2937700	you've ever heard about in your life but it was so much fun and like getting to talk to everybody
2937700	2942900	afterwards like legit the people I talked to a lot it was all done on slack you're probably
2942940	2947580	wondering how do you do this and this is part of the reason I agreed to do it because I knew it
2947580	2952500	wouldn't be video calls until late in the morning late in the morning like it was last time I played
2952500	2957780	I knew the challenges wouldn't be insane like two-hour endurance challenges like how long can
2957780	2963620	you stand on one foot you know things like that I knew it would be like quick and easy type of
2963620	2969180	stuff and playing on slack was how we did it was that it was only gonna be text chat and things
2969180	2973180	that and it was it kind of was like a throwback to when I used to do this shit on AOL instant
2973180	2979100	messenger back in the day on live journal so so yeah that's how it was so that that's my adventure
2979100	2985580	into the sixth or seventh circle of nerdom hell and I loved it and yeah I thought so oh do you
2985580	2993380	want to know how I did I was I was the runner-up I did not win this time I was the runner-up I got
2993380	2999860	beat unanimously by the person that won but I kind of knew it was coming I know exactly what
2999860	3004660	the the Jocelyn shit won the game spoiler alert because I don't think it's all posted yet sorry
3004660	3013740	Francis if you're listening um but um I you didn't make me sign a contract though um but so Jocelyn
3013740	3019220	won the game and she had very very strong social connections I got to know it is so weird because
3019340	3024420	we were in these characters but at a certain point the roleplay kind of stops and you get to
3024420	3028700	know each other like as people even though I don't actually know who it is but it was somebody I
3028700	3033860	didn't know before we actually like I she told me about how she's always been the runner-up in game
3033860	3039180	she's never won a game and so she won this one I'm like legit happy for she deserved it I know
3039180	3043620	exactly what I well mostly what I did wrong I would have hoped I got one vote but it's all
3043620	3048540	right I'm over it I I knew going into it it was probably gonna go this way and how her game was
3048540	3054380	better than all that and she totally earned it and I will have you all know because it was
3054380	3059340	anonymous nobody knew who was what and people could be characters that were not their own gender or
3059340	3067340	whatever they wanted to do right out of the 11 players in the game 10 of them were men in real
3067340	3073980	life and yes the person playing Moira was a man Robin was a man they were all men one woman in
3073980	3080140	the entire game and guess what the woman was Jocelyn's shit so a woman conquered the entire
3080140	3087020	game so misogyny is dead in 2021 let's hope all right but no seriously congrats if Jessica's out
3087020	3091300	there listening because I told her about the show you earned it you did an amazing job and yeah
3091300	3095540	legit I met some really rad people in that so that's that's why I talk about it on the show
3095540	3103620	and you know if y'all can play D&D it's basically that okay but like a somehow nerdier version of
3103620	3111380	it what I'm actually I got invited to join a roleplay group and I think a few of them might
3111380	3118220	be listening so hello travelers but it's it's a supernatural one well you know any guess guess
3118220	3125180	who's playing a guy oh you this bitch all right we're guess which guy I'm playing uh Castiel no
3125180	3130420	that's the only character name but Dean Sam so close my favorite I only know some of their names
3130420	3137660	all right yeah no it's it's uh it's it's great you know in and in all seriousness you know why
3137660	3140620	are you talking about this on your video game podcast and all that stuff you know we just had
3140620	3144620	this discussion a little bit ago about like mental health and things you have to do to get through a
3144620	3150260	big reason why I signed up for the game was because this was that same week during the
3150260	3157620	holidays where I had to cancel Christmas I had to cancel New Year's I wasn't doing anything so even
3157620	3161780	though you know let's all point at laughing Rob let's all point and laugh at Rob for doing one
3161780	3169380	of these again when he said it's gonna take a lot you know what a pandemic turns out it's a lot it
3169380	3176660	was enough to get me to go do that again so that was that um I'll give the community a shout out
3176660	3183300	to the the community is called TV land kind of like the network over on Facebook and if this
3183300	3189460	sounds like the sixth or seventh circle of nerdom hell you'd like to live in go say hi go check it
3189460	3193780	out they're planning another season I can't say much too much about it but they're they're quick
3193780	3199340	games get your mind off of the bullshit in the real world for a while yeah so shout out to Francis
3199340	3207260	and Stefan over there who did a great job with the TV land game I had a lot of fun um other games
3207260	3212540	I've been playing this week I randomly went on Xbox and started downloading more titles I
3212780	3220980	checked out the burnout paradise okay keep going to say burnout paradise city but that's not it but
3220980	3224900	I played burnout paradise remastered because it's on Xbox game pass I was like I haven't played a
3224900	3228500	burnout game in like five years I want to play one and so that was really fun I was trying to
3228500	3233380	get some achievements in that and it looks really good and really snappy on the Xbox series X I had
3233380	3238660	a lot of fun with that I've been playing a little bit of Pokemon go so they did these collection
3238660	3243900	challenges this week and I was about ready to throw my phone because I could not catch one of
3243900	3250100	the stupid Pokemon that I needed to catch but I finally got it yesterday so all is well unclench
3250100	3255780	but I like the idea of these little mini challenges with collection medals I just wish there was a way
3255780	3261220	to ensure that some of the pokey spawns were like a sure thing because that part started to get
3261220	3267660	really frustrating that was okay that was what was starting to get irritating otherwise some of the
3267660	3275820	other typical GPS games and oh Final Fantasy 14 as always I'm still playing that thing crafting
3275820	3280380	is getting a big thing next week in the game and so I'm all ready for it so yeah that's been that's
3280380	3284940	been a really good escape to to get together with friends and do things in Final Fantasy 14 because
3284940	3289420	I can't do things with friends in the real world so thank you video games thank you survivor LARP's
3289420	3294100	thank you all these things to help us to thank you AGDQ and all these things that help us take

3350300	3359900	a game that's in my my I almost said twitch it's a steam in my steam library or if I can get it
3359900	3364820	figured out just some classic game that I own something you know even if it's something that
3364820	3370740	you think I'll hate if it's a game that you think I'll hate and I don't own it I will accept you
3370740	3379400	buying it for me if it's a low in other words is what you're saying I mean we have a bunch of
3379400	3384980	halos on other systems so I mean I guess I can hook up one of the Xboxes we can fee I can ding
3384980	3392580	dong ditch you my my old Xbox one with my master collection our master chief collection disk if we
3392580	3401020	need to like there's ways there are ways yeah okay um but I will once I can you know get set
3401020	3412500	everything set up my my goal would be to to raise money during it but who whoever contributes I'm
3412500	3414940	trying to think of how to do this right because I don't want to get the channel in trouble or
3414940	3420660	anything don't come don't commit on air maybe just like you know to be continued on your Twitter
3420660	3426500	which you work some of these things out but yeah I'm looking for suggestions but I will take
3426500	3433220	donations with the suggestions and that will add a triple vote okay based on a certain dollar amount
3433220	3441860	and I'll put something like that on my on my Facebook and Twitter's more public anyway so it's
3441860	3448380	easier all right well best of luck I hope I and I can't wait to support the stream or whatever it
3448380	3454300	is you end up doing with that be fun I'll put it this way every every minimum every ten dollar

3461100	3466140	right set a date though but not you don't have to right now but maybe like next week all right yeah
3466140	3474180	it's probably gonna happen my goal actually is to get this going on sometime either next week or the
3474180	3480660	week after but I want to promote it this week and let people think about it okay all right let's get
3480660	3486300	into some gaming news there are some things going on this week even though you know it's it's it's a
3486300	3492100	slower time of year for gaming news we saw a few things to talk about and sometimes that is things
3492100	3499420	things from not just last year but many years ago right Loki yes from 2006 so apparently a core
3499460	3505620	design was a studio that was behind the original Tomb Raider series they were working on a remake
3505620	3513820	of the original game for its 10th anniversary on PSP and of course you know the game never came out
3513820	3522820	on PSP well now they have apparently the contents of the game have been uploaded to the Internet
3522820	3530420	archive as part of I guess the doing of this Tomb Raider fam site called the tomb of ash and
3530420	3539460	apparently they are able you're able to take this and actually play it it looks pretty good actually
3539460	3545380	considering you know it's a remake of the first game I mean I could definitely seen this being
3545380	3552460	released I don't know why it wasn't released at all but apparently it says the game had been
3552460	3558460	canceled instead of being published side entertainment they went with a multi-platform
3558460	3564500	remake developed by Crystal Dynamics which was a two meter anniversary game so this pitch didn't
3564500	3572060	end up making to a final game but the Crystal Dynamics one did so yeah too bad it looks pretty
3572100	3579460	good though yeah I love when these like unearthed games kind of show up all over again and it's like
3579460	3582940	kind of getting to discover this thing and that's kind of been a thing I feel like we've seen more
3582940	3586620	and more of it the past couple months like Sega put out that golden axe thing not that long ago
3586620	3591300	right like there's there's been little yeah these canceled projects coming back to life and I like
3591300	3596780	it when it's official like obviously the Nintendo hack stuff is super dicey but when like the
3596780	3600700	companies kind of like embrace it a little bit it's cool although I guess this one wasn't wasn't
3600780	3605780	really embraced right or well I think it was just that there was another project going on at the
3605780	3613060	same time so it just didn't end up you know come into fruition but um still pretty cool yeah I'd
3613060	3619260	love to check it out do I do I even have a working PSP I guess I still have a working Vita so there
3619260	3624700	is that but might be kind of hard to get going I don't know let's move on and talk about something
3624700	3628060	else from the past that's been making headlines this week you've probably seen this all around
3628420	3634140	different gaming blogs and that is a conversation between Microsoft and Nintendo in fact a lot of
3634140	3639140	the headlines say Microsoft tried to buy Nintendo at some point and essentially and a lot of the
3639140	3645380	headlines are saying and got laughed out of the room as a result which I I don't know if it's
3645380	3649500	quite that simple I mean surely that was probably part of the discussion but of all it also might
3649500	3654900	have been a starting point to try to get to another type of agreement and maybe that is
3654900	3661060	Nintendo games on the Xbox which obviously we all know Nintendo wants no part of that shit
3661060	3670660	Nintendo you know they kind of started to go down that road with the whole CDI I know that was a
3670660	3676020	little bit different the CDI was a result of the CD expansion for the Super Nintendo that never
3676020	3680380	happened as part of like the divorce agreement between Phillips who was helping to work on it
3680380	3687980	and Nintendo Phillips got the right to use like five Nintendo characters in their own games thus
3687980	3694820	the Wanda Gamelan and some other games that really were a stain for Nintendo so Nintendo has no
3694820	3699740	interest on being on other platforms like ever again like Nintendo will die as a company before
3699740	3705380	that ever happens as far as licensing games so like have Microsoft make a Nintendo game or
3705380	3709100	something like that and I don't even know necessarily if they're totally opposed to that
3709100	3716140	I mean you have you know the Mario and Sonic games and those you know are built by Sega true
3716140	3719180	there's been other games you know have been developed by Namco and stuff like that so I
3719180	3725580	don't think that they're completely um you know shooting all of those down but like I mean it
3725580	3730700	would be pretty cool if they had like a service of their own games that they could you know say
3730700	3738060	for example if I could get the Nintendo online channel on you know my Xbox or something like
3738060	3744620	that just say game pass on switch just just lean all the way in okay the only thing though is this
3744620	3749500	story is about a meeting that happened in January 2000 so game pass wasn't even in anybody's
3749500	3754060	imagination at that point yeah it was a long time ago this meeting happened so they were still
3754060	3761340	planning the Xbox at this time and you know and before you say god what a bunch of idiots at
3761340	3767300	Microsoft keep in mind in the year 2000 you're coming back the Wii hadn't happened yet so you're
3767300	3773060	coming out and the GameCube wasn't out yet you were coming off the Nintendo 64 and some technology
3773060	3779620	that was really starting to like not be on that same level as where Sony was at so that was kind
3779620	3785940	of Microsoft's leveraging was you give us or you give us the games we'll give you the technology
3785940	3793940	this is a great partnership and honestly yes but you know and any fanboy who's ever said I wish
3793940	3798580	they would just put Mario games on the PlayStation or on there like that's basically what Microsoft
3798580	3804500	went in there asking but you know it's obviously not taking into consideration that Nintendo wants
3804500	3809780	no fucking part of that they don't need it they don't want it they ain't gonna have it and so
3809780	3814580	that what leads to the headline where they got laughed out of the room um head of business
3814580	3819540	development for Microsoft Bob McBreen said in an interview uh we actually had Nintendo in our
3819540	3824180	building in January 2000 to work through the details of a joint venture where we gave them
3824180	3829780	all the technical specs of the Xbox the pitch was their hardware stunk and compared to Sony
3829780	3835220	PlayStation it did so the idea was listen you're much better at the game portions of it with Mario
3835220	3840900	and all that stuff why don't you let us take care of the hardware and then I love this but it didn't
3840900	3851460	work out it didn't work out but you know yeah but on one hand honestly was Microsoft wrong
3853140	3859700	I don't think they were wrong but the only thing they were wrong about is that Nintendo
3859700	3865060	doesn't give a fuck Nintendo has their own approach to things and that and that continues
3865060	3871220	on into the year 2021 so I don't know I thought that was kind of an interesting thing that was
3871220	3875540	going around but especially because that headline where like Nintendo laughed Microsoft out of the
3875540	3882260	room and I'm kind of like I think it goes a little deeper than that like would if I went back and
3882260	3888980	looked at your old tweets did you laugh Microsoft out of the room on these things where you know
3888980	3893700	Mario should come to PlayStation all that stuff because I don't think a lot of people did so I
3893780	3897140	don't think I was even thinking about that yeah now some folks in our chat room over
3897140	3903380	twitch.tv slash vog network uh pod culture is saying master chief in smash and then act f points
3903380	3911780	out banjo kazooie and steve are in smash so who's to say that a meeting back in 2000 didn't at least
3911780	3916100	and even if they all had a good laugh about it whether they were laughing with or laughing at
3916100	3921620	uh who's to say that opening those lines of communication all those years ago didn't lead to
3922340	3927940	something like what we see now which is a little more of you know the the a little bit of helping
3927940	3934180	each other out here and there so and sj 100 matt says it was not seriously entertained was the
3934180	3942580	actual comment really because the one I read said but it didn't work out you don't say
3944660	3948580	all right I thought that was an interesting story and I loved I loved those little pieces
3948580	3952900	of gaming history where it's kind of like what could have been who knows
3952900	3955940	anyway dark soccer why don't you take us to our next story
3959300	3968820	um the uh a multiple winner uh of the uh tetris world uh champ that I can't make even words
3968820	3974580	happen uh the classic tetris world champion uh jonas newbauer has died um
3974660	3983860	um it uh I don't see exactly what it was that that did it I'd have to to look uh
3984500	3989140	I don't think I think they've just said sudden emergency so it kind of you know
3990580	3999060	but it's still I mean he went seven times so I mean that that's that's uh a very important
3999060	4003460	you know person I guess in the community and to lose somebody so suddenly
4004100	4011380	you know just uh wishing the best for his family yeah this is some um this is some really sad
4011380	4015460	news there's no real easy way to talk about especially somebody young this guy was like
4015460	4020500	three years younger than I am so it's um it's it's really tragic to hear about these types of things
4020500	4025060	and I think a lot of you probably watch those tetris world championship videos that this
4025060	4030340	yes it was that guy yeah that's uh uh was in them that um passed away and that's that's really
4030340	4038740	really sad so um anyhow um tipping our hat and remembering uh this week um let's move on try to
4038740	4044500	move on to uh other news uh it's it's been a heavy week and that has led to some things in
4044500	4055620	the gaming world too right loki um yeah so there is some interesting um things going on on twitch
4055620	4064180	so apparently one of the emotes uh pogchamp was featuring the face of streamer ryan gucex
4064180	4072900	gutiérrez um and apparently they took it down because he was tweeting some extremely um
4073860	4079700	questionable things and they didn't want to necessarily associate with him so because of
4079700	4088180	that they had disabled the pogchamp emotes and um eventually then are replacing it now with
4088180	4094500	a new uh pogchamp emote that will feature different streamer spaces making the same
4095300	4101060	face that they're going to swap out every 24 hours hopefully none of them have said questionable
4101060	4108100	things on twitter well honestly this although obviously the situation is yikes the resolution
4108100	4110820	kind of leads to one of those things where it's like this is kind of the way it should have always
4110820	4119780	been you know like twitch is more than about one person like i'm not here to like knock people like
4119780	4124020	you know ninja or whatever that have done very well i mean unless they act a fool then i will
4124020	4128260	knock them but you know as far as like their success you know and stuff like that hey great
4128260	4134580	they've been successful but twitch is much more than one person you know or one you know community
4134580	4140260	it's about the greater community of all these great twitch streamers that we have and yes
4140260	4145540	diverse types of twitch streamers that we have just in and i'm not just talking about you know
4145540	4151140	things like sexuality and colors of people's skin but the countries they're playing from the types
4151140	4154900	of game that's all important too don't get me wrong but like the types of games that they're
4154900	4160980	playing as well the the things that they're into and the the stories they have to share so i i
4160980	4165700	like this resolution even though the way we got here was a bit of a oh yeah i'm kind of like
4166420	4172180	it should have just been this way from day one like have a rotating face of the why not the
4172180	4177300	people on the front page rotate every day so why not have some of your emotes rotate as well all
4177300	4184020	the time so i mean it's kind of makes sense yeah so yeah and it's interesting sha100 matt says
4184020	4188180	i knew the emoji didn't know it was an actual personality yeah a lot of people didn't know
4188180	4193380	where it came from but you know i'm i'm you know i'm glad they addressed it and ultimately you know
4193380	4201460	you can qq about free speech all you want although you know big huge fat reminder free speech doesn't
4201460	4206500	apply to private platforms so period that's not really has to do with criticizing the government
4206500	4211940	yeah so yeah you can go the free speech is what allows me to say president trump sucks
4211940	4216340	because in some other countries you criticize a leader like that you get thrown in jail
4216340	4222500	so i i'm thankful for folks you can yell fire in a movie theater just saying right so anyway
4223620	4228660	civics less than another day but i think it's also important with everything's been going on this week
4228660	4234020	um but i i think it's really great that we're you know highlighting again a bunch of different
4234020	4238660	people and things like that so and and bob blackwolf rotating through some of the other
4238660	4244420	popular emotes saying these are also people yes of course they're they're uh modeled after people
4244980	4250580	now do you guys want a hot take that i think is is not going to be popular but i'm gonna say it
4250580	4259060	anyway um i think in general these emotes of people's faces are generally a bad idea now
4259060	4264740	don't be wrong hold on let me finish the pogchamp stuff cool some of these iconic twitter things
4264740	4270260	that you know folks have cool but if somebody and nobody has but but i'm gonna say it anyway
4270260	4273860	if somebody were to come up to me and say what emote icon should i make for my channel
4273860	4282180	i'm gonna say please don't use pictures of your face because that's everywhere that's everywhere
4283140	4291300	use something else and maybe use just my my old speaking here but um i don't know what half of
4291300	4297460	that stuff means anyways exactly faces and stuff i have no idea what it's representing um
4298340	4304340	it's cool i guess i mean they can have their own you know uh speech in twitch and whatnot but i
4304340	4309220	just don't get it see you see it seeing them they're very annoying yeah see it tabiri just
4309220	4313300	posted a couple and you know and i know you're doing it to be tongue in cheek and on topic but
4313300	4318340	i literally don't know what i'm looking at they're so small i don't know what they are the face palm
4318340	4323380	i get that one but especially like when we're talking like you know even more popular chat rooms
4324340	4329220	and stuff we're just scrolling by it's like i don't know what it that's just garbage it's
4329220	4334420	literally just garbage being thrown in my face yeah so just something to think about now when
4334420	4338900	i was watching gdq do you know what the most common there were there are two two comedy
4338900	4344740	emotes that i saw the lamp which is an inside joke but it makes sense it's not somebody's face
4345380	4351540	i'll give you that and the clapping emoji yes that that is a good one to spam because we're
4351540	4356500	not in person we don't have an audience so yes use your clapping emoji and use it a lot
4356500	4363220	yeah i believe in fairies yes clap okay it's it makes sense so anyway again you guys are
4363220	4366740	posting these emotes and i'm like what the hell are these i don't even know all right anyway
4369220	4373220	let's move on shall we let's move on to a story about monster hunter you guys have some monster
4373220	4377940	hunter emotes to share because that's what's topical for this story uh a brand new demo for
4378020	4382740	monster hunter rise came out just this past week if you weren't already aware i'm sure if you're
4382740	4387460	a monster hunter fan you are but if you didn't know there is a demo now available for monster
4387460	4392660	hunter rise and it's available on the switch e-shop it is a limited time demo you have to

4401060	4408740	in there we're going to artificially shorting anybody with supplies i don't think this is
4408740	4415140	nintendo is capcom yeah but this is how they have this is how they handle their demos whether it's
4415140	4420820	like you know it's for a limited time or we're gonna allow you to play this demo only 30 times
4420820	4428180	before you can't play it anymore it's an antenna thing so it is limited to uh there are 30 quests
4428180	4433540	in the game and dark tatsuya and chat says there it's limited to 30 plays so it's that same kind
4433540	4439140	of totally totally nintendo told you you know that part's nintendo yeah so oh but bobby says this one
4439140	4444900	specifically is a capcom thing so maybe but nintendo started it capcom's continuing it i
4444900	4453700	don't know but um yeah so uh i but 30 is a lot i mean on those here's the thing have you ever
4453780	4461780	actually used 30 plays of a demo my my kids have yes okay all right i'll let it go all right jumping
4461780	4468740	flash i guess there was that time i downloaded the luminous demo from an e3 kiosk with the ds
4468740	4475060	download thing and i i i refused to turn off my ds for like three weeks so i could keep playing
4475060	4481140	the luminous demo yeah so i used to play all the playstation magazine demos used to bring in the
4481140	4486260	school we'd play like the cool borders 2 2 demo over and over and over and over and over again
4487060	4491140	i eventually bought the game bobby says capcom did this even in other countries
4491700	4499300	um so anyway all right let's move on i i'm curious because i didn't i'm not a big
4499300	4507300	monster hunter person um oh bobby says other consoles not other countries so the same deal
4507380	4514900	is on the playstation whatever so anyway my point is outside the the weird constrictions of it i
4514900	4520420	don't get into monster hunter i have tried several times there was one on the wii u i tried to get
4520420	4524500	into couldn't get into it i tried playing dauntless not that not that long ago i think i
4524500	4528020	saw vg realness or somebody streaming it and i was like i want to try this and i tried i couldn't get
4528020	4532420	into it it's like i can never get into these monster hunter games and i just no offense to
4532420	4537460	the fandom i know these games are huge i just can't get into it so for those that are into
4537460	4542020	the fandom what did you think of monster hunter rise the demo because admittedly i haven't tried
4542020	4546340	it and i'm not exactly in a hurry to although i probably will at some point so i'm kind of
4546340	4554420	curious what those of you who actually played the demo feel about it so um dark tetsuya says it
4554420	4560180	seems like it might be more fun than generations ultimate at least so uh see it tabiri says i'd
4560180	4566100	rather be playing monster rancher all right fine um quest buster says monster hunter world is good
4566100	4571780	stuff but i still need to try out the rise demo uh shad starzik or shane has actually played the
4571780	4578020	demo thank you and says the rise demo was crazy fun and ran so well compared to what i was expecting
4578660	4582900	because it is on the switch and so again and we just talked about this with the nintendo
4582900	4587620	microsoft boardroom story uh nintendo is not known for pushing the boundaries on tech so
4588500	4595060	uh it's still coming off as impressive even with the fact that it's on the switch uh dark tetsuya
4595060	4598820	says yeah that's fair it's probably harder to get into if you're not already familiar which is
4598820	4603620	probably a bad idea fifth dream says monster hunter world was the only monster hunter i played
4603620	4610980	and i loved it and i burnt myself out on monster hunter after like 700 hours so i'm done with it
4610980	4618260	wow you say that now fifth dream but just one hit of the new one you never know so anyway thank you
4618260	4623220	guys for the feedback uh i i'll check it out at some point i gotta go in and download it but i
4623220	4629620	guess it was doing so well it like crashed the servers the day it went up so uh a lot of people
4629620	4634740	wanted to check that out all right moving on uh just a few more stories when we get to our classic
4634740	4636340	game of the week but first dark sakura
4638660	4644980	one of the things about agdq uh this year is that we saw and one of them i watched a uh
4645700	4652100	two world records broken back to back that was pretty cool um the one i actually sat and watched
4652100	4656980	was uh sonic fox oh sorry flying fox i don't know why i said sonic sonic fox that's a different
4657620	4666180	flying fox um actually uh played uh which of the it was one of the sonic okay it was the sonic the
4666180	4672900	hedgehog 2013 and sonic 3 angel island revisited um were the two games that were played so sonic
4672900	4678260	the hedgehog 2013 i believe it was the um android one that had some elements from the later sonic
4678260	4684420	games and uh she beat her time actually she matched the world record during her practice i
4684420	4691860	think and then well surpassed it uh during the final run and then right after that uh zaxxon 96
4691860	4698820	uh broke a world record for sonic 3 angel island revisited i didn't watch that one um but i did
4698820	4704180	see flying fox and just actually just funny watching her reaction was absolutely breathtaking
4704180	4708100	i mean just i love watching that moment where someone accomplishes something and they don't
4708100	4713460	quite believe it make sense yeah oh yeah for sure um so it was really good and congratulations
4714100	4719380	um uh bobby blackwolf went into great detail on awesome games done quick on his show tonight
4719380	4723940	um since he's able to give a little bit of an insider's perspective you know having uh
4723940	4729220	been been a volunteer again this year um and uh or specifically a host i should say because i
4729220	4735300	think there's a difference between those two titles um but uh bobby gave a lot of insight
4735300	4742020	there and was talking about how uh the speed run he was hosting for yoshi's island ended up being
4742020	4749220	like the number three best time of that game ever uh if the person running it didn't already have
4749220	4754180	number two and you you only get on the scoreboard once basically so so it would have been number
4754180	4758500	three and and obviously a lot of people were talking about stage five four and just some of
4758500	4762340	the create and i was actually watching that when i did i did see that part on wednesday and that
4762340	4767460	was insanity that was just like damn that takes some skills i went trying to find the other ones
4767460	4770900	and i couldn't because i knew that there were a couple others that i didn't catch but
4772020	4778900	i uh that i that one for me just because it was when i witnessed i was like yeah yeah girl yeah
4778900	4783380	very cool what were the other two uh bobby's saying there were four in all that happened
4783380	4790900	right during the event diablo 3 um okay wow diablo 3 three man even world record the four
4790900	4797060	man time that's pretty impressive and then super or brothers yeah i said that one i did see because
4797140	4803060	they allotted like 40 minutes to the slot and uh dude beat it in like what 15 minutes 15 minutes
4803060	4808340	something like that no it was pretty quick no i take that back 18 because his time the world
4808340	4814580	record was 36 and he cut it directly in half oh wow roundabout yeah and that was really fun
4814580	4820980	because that one for a kaizo style game it didn't have the same feel to me as a kaizo game it was
4820980	4825940	more of a technical game if that makes sense like not everything in the universe was trying to kill
4825940	4832820	you you just had a set way that you had to beat the puzzle right and yeah super orbit brothers
4832820	4840660	was was a really good one i i that was probably one of my favorite runs to watch next to uh
4840660	4847700	rugby baby that was a great that was a great moment so hard don't don't spoil it don't spoil
4847700	4852900	it because people gotta watch it for themselves no no no but i need to find a picture of like
4852900	4858820	the happiest moment for that baby and have that be like my new icon for everything all right
4859780	4867700	all right let's move on and let hey guys let's talk about nudity loki yes so apparently koei
4867700	4877540	techmo has filed charges against um somebody that was allegedly selling unlicensed dvds filled with
4877540	4884500	naked dead or alive characters so this is kind of like your rule 34 stuff where they i i don't know
4884500	4889380	if they're still using like the source filmmaker and stuff to make some of these things but you
4889380	4894980	know the like cg animated like take video game characters and have them doing illicit stuff
4894980	4900660	well kind of the same type of thing they made a uh dead or alive extreme um venus vacation
4901460	4908900	and have been modding it to you know make it look like they're engaging in sexual activities
4908900	4913140	and then selling dvds which is a big no-no because you don't own those characters and
4913140	4920020	also who buys dvds nowadays um but apparently they have you know gone after them because
4920020	4926260	obviously copyright issues um but it's the internet all those out there those boobies
4926260	4930180	are copyright koei techmo those are we own those
4932900	4939380	but yeah so uh i just i haven't heard of a lot of legal action against a nude mod in quite some
4939380	4945460	time it's been well it's not necessarily a mod per se i mean it's sort of i mean i guess it could be
4945460	4951700	but it's it's more of just like taking the characters and then like turning it into like
4951700	4957140	their own thing kind of like how you see a lot of the um folks doing stuff with the overwatch
4957140	4963300	characters and stuff like that like activision blizzard could come after them you know for doing
4963300	4969060	that type of thing especially if they're profiting from it um i think a lot of it's you know kind of
4969060	4975220	anonymous on the internet and people aren't necessarily selling dvds of it but if if they
4975220	4981460	were caught they could be you know responsible for you know penalties because of copyright and
4981940	4988420	infringement all right i got no good transition here so i'm just gonna get into the next story
4989460	4993940	which has to do with minecraft earth or should i say had to do with minecraft earth
4993940	4999620	because minecraft earth which uh again is the phone game the ar game for minecraft yeah
4999620	5004740	people were saying it's like pokemon go i that that is really i was like that is how you know
5004740	5009780	somebody hasn't played it it was nothing like pokemon go it just happened to take place in the
5009780	5014580	real world loki you've probably played a little bit more of this than anyone else here so let me
5014580	5022980	finish your crew they're shutting it down june 30th 2021 because it didn't work yeah and uh one
5022980	5026500	good thing though is like if you did purchase anything in the game they are giving you a free
5026500	5035220	copy of minecraft so if you um do end up i don't know but basically uh the problem with it was
5035220	5041300	there's like no point to it like it it was like you could you go and click these tappable things
5041300	5048340	to get resources which you could use to get blocks in the game to build stuff but like honestly like
5048340	5054820	the build spaces that you had there's no shortage of blocks i mean it's it's pretty much almost
5054820	5060020	impossible not to have the resources to do things in the game and i don't know if i didn't really
5060020	5064980	play it very long so like they didn't have even really gotten to like a lot of the crafting stuff
5064980	5070420	in there you can make tools and stuff but a lot of that wasn't fully implemented yet when i had
5070420	5076420	stopped playing it um the ar stuff that they did was pretty cool um i mean that was definitely
5076420	5082500	really awesome the problem was because a lot of the ar stuff was reliant on you going places to
5082500	5089460	do all that it was hard to kind of do that in a pandemic um and that that was my next question
5089460	5094260	was is is this because of the pandemic like i i heard they made some changes to try to make it
5094260	5097620	a little more like pokemon go did the same thing that that is something those games have in common
5097620	5102260	so that you would get like these like gem things that you would be able to redeem to like kind of
5102260	5108660	spawn one of those instances near where your location was um and they were kind of cool i
5108660	5113700	mean but it was just there wasn't really like an end goal like there was like different achievements
5113700	5120100	they had along the way to get more xp that you're like okay you know today you have to capture five
5120100	5125300	sheep or something like that and and some of it was like kind of hard to do but like it was just
5126340	5133060	i don't know there was never really a point to it and also it ate my battery like it was a very
5133060	5138740	unoptimized game yeah um i don't know if it that ever changed but like when i was playing it in
5138740	5147460	the very uh early part of when it came out it was just so so unoptimized um i think it's gotten
5147460	5152180	better i've seen like some folks you know especially they've partnered with different
5152180	5158340	minecraft streamers to kind of showcase the different things i know there's one i watch with
5158340	5166100	some of the folks from hermitcraft um agree in and mumbo who do they did this like kind of uh
5166100	5172340	road trip thing and they they really made stonehenge and stuff and uh recreated that in in
5172420	5178100	minecraft earth and so it's kind of cool um but it's just i don't know it's a really great
5178100	5184180	concept i think it was not executed great though and i think i think maybe the pandemic also just
5184180	5189780	like didn't help the inertia in the game and yeah they didn't communicate well like what was the
5189780	5194900	point you know and i think that was a big uh problem with it and and what ssj100 matt is
5194900	5200260	saying in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network i honestly forgot all about it which i
5200260	5206980	is i guess in a sense what was the problem me too matt and the game is on my phone and i just don't
5206980	5210900	because i always check out those ar games because i'm a sucker for all of them i've played them all
5210900	5217380	i've played them all um and and i forgot about minecraft earth because you're right they did
5217380	5220660	they weren't very good at communicating like what's the point what's the competition what
5220660	5225300	am i going for here what's you know what do i have to look forward to tomorrow where do i
5225300	5229300	interact with other people like that just didn't really get realized ever in the game and i don't
5229300	5234500	know if the pandemic just fucked that all up for them or what and they never like i know one of
5234500	5238180	the things that they had talked about is like building creations and putting them out there
5238180	5243460	in the real world which you can sort of do and interact with them but they're not persistent
5243460	5247780	which is kind of irritating i mean i guess that's probably a good thing because there'd be dicks
5247780	5253220	everywhere but um it's just it would still be pretty cool though like get to have that stuff
5253220	5257380	be persistent because then you could just go places and that would be more of like kind of
5257380	5261780	like oh i'm going to go to the park and see what's there you know or something um but there
5261780	5267300	wasn't really anything like that um you could bring a creation that you make and put it out
5267300	5275860	into the real world but like it i don't know it was just it was tough to it had a lot of good ideas
5275860	5282180	but in the end i guess it's just not really um successful but i hope that they bring a lot of
5282180	5287060	i mean they've already brought some of the stuff over to the uh regular minecraft i hope that they
5287060	5292820	bring a lot more of these mobs that they've created in this game to the uh vanilla minecraft
5292820	5300100	as well okay all right well let's take a trip down memory lane and we're gonna go to a time when uh
5300100	5304660	there was there was no ar games you couldn't you couldn't play this stuff on your phone you know
5304660	5310100	why because your phone was in your car or it was in your kitchen on a cord it's the classic game
5310100	5315460	of the week dark sakura is going to take a trip down memory lane and uh find a game in the vault
5315460	5320740	that she thinks hey this game is worthy of your attention and by the way before we get into
5320740	5326100	tonight's game a quick follow-up to last week dark sakura you would be very proud of our twitter
5326100	5331140	people as they have a or excuse me our twitter people are uh wiki people as they have quickly
5331140	5338580	added flag or the fucking weird arcade game of the month officially to the list for this year so
5339300	5345780	i saw everything is set up wonderful thank you five people all right uh so but anyway tonight
5345780	5350500	is not a flag because you did one last week so we've got a good a good old classic in fact again
5350500	5356500	like here we are again episode 851 you have literally picked 601 of these over the years
5356500	5362100	we started the segment in episode 250 you have picked 601 games somehow have never picked this
5362100	5368740	one which i'm like what well you you picked adjacent games but you didn't do this one yeah
5368740	5373060	this one or the one i played dark soccer all right what is it let's get to it what is the
5373060	5380260	classic game of the week i picked the nest version of strider um by the way you're you're a little
5380260	5383460	quiet for the listeners you might want to get just a little bit closer to the microphone i think
5383460	5390020	you'll be better fucking thing sorry my uh i'm a professional yeah you're fine you're much better
5390020	5394660	now yeah well it's just because the thing tilts down and i don't have anything to hold that in
5394660	5400340	place so everyone can see me fighting my mic on oh god i hate this thing no they can't see it
5400340	5407620	because they're watching strider oh good well i hate my pop filter and i want it to die oh my god
5407620	5412660	i hate you okay here we go and that's the sounds of what happens when i fight my tech equipment y'all
5413300	5420740	how i sound now you sound very loud and very clear so strider all right strider so this particular
5420740	5428900	version of strider came out in 1998 uh for the nes released by capcom only uh in north america
5429460	5435940	um i well actually i think only in north america um yeah there's a famicom version uh was never
5435940	5446260	released um this was developed um in tandem with the arcade version um so also the nest version
5446260	5453540	uh was included in the 2006 game boy advance compilation capcom classics mini mix so i'm
5453540	5461860	going to back off a little bit and say that this game is not the same strider that you think it is
5461860	5470980	um it is a uh it's it's a little bit more of a a scroller game size for the platformer but you
5470980	5474660	go and look around for this kind of like more like teenage mutant turtles if that makes sense
5474660	5479780	you have to go find different items um get different discs that have uh information that
5479780	5484820	goes with the plot you have several characters can also give you new abilities um that help you
5484820	5490740	like bypass different uh areas and everything but now here is the thing about this game um
5491460	5502340	this game is based off of um a manga um comic uh comptique uh which is a well it was a among the
5502340	5508900	anthology that was published by uh katakawa shilton um had a strategy manga that was uh
5510340	5518100	released from may to may and october issue made two october issues in 1988 and then a single issue
5519060	5526020	ended up uh tankoban sorry was uh released in november of that year so it basically has the
5526020	5532980	same characters and the plot that was used in the nest version a few differences um where uh
5534260	5540020	i don't i mean there's certain characters that die you know they die in different places um some
5540020	5547620	characters live um and then there was um an uncollected uh chapter that was called
5549940	5557940	that was also uh published after the main series so it has uh uh you know more things that go after
5557940	5565780	the the ending of the game um but at any rate yeah this um this game um well and it was uh
5566420	5572820	actually named strider hiryu um to be released in uh japan there was the it was announced while the
5572820	5580100	manga was out and they had it scheduled to be released but it got delayed to 1989 and then it
5580100	5585540	was cancelled so we still had the localized version that came out here in the u.s. um that
5585540	5595380	came right after the the arcade game um it the artwork on it is interesting i don't it's just
5595380	5605380	when they were doing the super american artwork um yeah but i mean there's people who love this
5605380	5614100	game i mean i'm i'm not one of them i'll just go ahead and say um but you can also uh you know it
5614100	5620420	it's it's got an interesting story to it i do enjoy the story to it um one other thing also
5620420	5625940	this game is that you can use your your it has a password system so um but every time you request
5625940	5633780	a password the game will end with a description of your progress so far and gives the title of the
5633780	5642020	next adventure like it was uh an anime or a tv series or you know even in a manga series so
5642980	5650260	it's kind of neat um but yeah it's it's not if you're expecting to go through with ha ha ha ha
5650260	5657380	and sailing on fighter and fight you know oroboros um it's not the same game it's completely different
5657380	5661300	game it's a very different game and you were kind of talking about like people you know maybe
5661300	5667060	preferred this game i wouldn't say i necessarily preferred it but it's the only one i knew you know
5667060	5672500	as a kid because i didn't have a genesis i uh for whatever reason i never noticed the other strider
5672500	5676340	in the years i think i think a couple years later i saw the strider in the arcade at one point i'm
5676340	5683620	like this is nothing like strider you know um but my frame of reference was this particular game that
5683620	5687780	we had rented a couple times i think nintendo power had some of the maps and i thought the
5687780	5693220	little tunnels that you traveled through were cool so yeah i i i have fond memories of this game but
5693220	5699860	it's clearly the the genesis and the arcade one are are the better games um but this one was
5700820	5706660	what's that he's walking is so fucking weird in that game yeah but this game is gonna meet
5706660	5713940	himself in the chin well and this was also the game that brought us that horrific uh triangle
5713940	5719300	jumping i don't know if you remember that from this game but you had like wall bounce basically
5719300	5726180	and it was really really hard to do and would just drive you crazy i think they did something
5726180	5730740	like it in a metroid game or something later on it was really awful there too uh but even harder
5730740	5737460	here um so yeah i i i do remember this game in fact i see in the in the youtube we're watching
5737460	5741780	right now of somebody playing the game there in egypt and i remember this level like i do this
5741780	5748580	you know and it comes from an era of capcom um there's definitely an engine that powers this
5748580	5754900	game the capcom you know backbone of a lot of their uh a bit nes era games there's a lot about
5754900	5762420	this game that feels like duck tales mega man bionic commando and a lot of the nes games of
5762420	5768740	the era you know what i mean oh that guy just wall jumped right there the sprites uh style is
5768740	5772420	very similar to bionic commando i think stylistically duck tales of course has the
5772420	5776420	disney touch yes of course yeah stylistically i think bionic commando is probably the best
5776420	5784580	comparison in this game yeah yeah but but and i'll be honest you know my i i i had never seen
5784580	5792820	this when i was a kid um my first exposure to strider was totally dying on the first stage in
5792820	5799540	an arcade um and then you know dan's sitting me down when i moved out here and says you're
5799620	5807700	required to play this and i beat it i love i love that these are the requirements uh to date
5808580	5815300	number one you will beat strider there were a few requirements number one was don't smoke number two
5816020	5823700	beat strider reasonable number three was playing through uh castlevania symphony of the night
5824580	5833300	again reasonable very reasonable all all games that i've beaten and you know except for smoking
5833300	5837540	because that's disgusting and i won't do it so well and how many years have you been together
5837540	5847060	as a result 23 this month there you go there you go me personally living in this state on the 23rd
5847060	5848580	oh oh it's your golden year
5850820	5854900	all right it's it's the it's the year of consequence uh anything else
5854900	5862500	is the number of consequence anything else to say about strider um i guess play it if you have it
5863060	5870420	um then you'll see why uh why it makes me cry that's no good music in it though yeah it does
5870420	5875540	have some really good music i think it's it's it's worth checking the manga is really good though
5875540	5882580	it's worth checking out just to see how starkly different the games are and the fact that they
5882580	5887060	were of like the the same you know intellectual property essentially they're two very different
5887060	5896020	games one of you know but i actually did really enjoy the manga it was oh god not the same story
5896020	5901780	that was the wall jump part i and that guy just did it flawlessly i can't watch it it'll affect
5901780	5908180	my internet um but i mean the manga was pretty good i look at it as just like a completely
5908180	5912100	different universe from the main continuity because the main continuity is from the arcade
5912100	5915700	version followed by strider 2 and then there is the remake from that series so
5915700	5920900	i like how every single person that's in this or every single uh sprite or enemy drops
5924020	5928660	what do you mean just drops it just drops like they spawn in they drop
5928660	5934660	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah there's a lot of graphical bugs in this game but on on an old tv keep in mind
5934660	5939300	a lot of the bugs you see on the perimeter or the outside edges keep in mind an old crt tv is going
5939300	5944900	to hide that so it didn't it looks bad now it looks worse than it did back then when you were
5944900	5948980	playing it on an old tv because you can't see some of those graphical bugs that are on the edges
5949540	5955460	that's interesting all right wait that was it there it is your classic game of the week strider
5955460	5961700	the nes version specifically all right thank you dark soccer for that pick let's get into
5961700	5966260	some rapid fire news and travel around the gaming world and see what else is happening this week
5966260	5975780	loki it's all mods so uh first we have this ridiculous snowboard mod for witcher 3 which
5975780	5982900	is hilarious it allows you to add a snowboard to uh jarl's inventory and looks like it works almost
5982900	5992580	like the shield in um breath of the wild i need to play this now um so yeah it's pretty awesome
5992580	5997140	if you want to check it out nexus mods of course and then of course there's a first person mod
5997860	6004420	for moral combat 11 so that's kind of uh uh interesting that's like a straight out of the
6004420	6010820	street fighter playbook there yeah then fps oh yeah that's switch version yeah yeah yeah so
6011460	6018180	um actually i think the 3ds one had that too but yeah so that's also something you can uh
6018180	6024820	check out as well um pretty cool well i don't know how many of you had the super nintendo port
6024820	6030740	of street fighter alpha 2 because most people stuck to the saturn or the playstation if they
6030740	6036180	were going to play this game but there was a super nintendo cartridge version of it uh and get this
6036180	6044260	after 25 years a cheat code has been discovered for this game uh it it was reversed engineered
6044260	6051780	and has been discovered that on the tie if you put k a j in the high score table go to the title
6051780	6057860	screen and hold down lxy and start on the second controller that's a lot you will be able to play
6057860	6065380	the game as shin akuma so that is that is something that's been hiding in that game all this time
6065380	6071620	what'd you say this game you own this game i own this game you should check it out maybe so
6071620	6076260	although i always joke about this game as being like one of the first cartridge games ever played
6076260	6081940	that had load time yeah right yeah um yeah i i figured you would have skipped the super
6081940	6086500	nintendo i know you're a street fighter you know type of gal obviously sakura came from somewhere
6086500	6092020	i didn't have anything else i had a mess that was the best thing i had before i got here okay
6092020	6097780	okay i just borrowed my friend's playstation forever but i i didn't move out here with
6097780	6102660	anything new except i owned a copy of final fantasy 7 and that was like it yeah why why
6102660	6108580	oh and dragon ball gt yyr in chat says holy crap it's no wonder nobody ever found it naturally and
6108580	6112020	it kind of makes me wonder why was it there in the first place and usually with these cheat
6112020	6115620	codes the way it worked back in the day is that if they weren't found or they weren't you know
6115620	6123380	whatever within about a year the cheat codes get leaked by the developer to to draw interest in the
6123380	6128260	game again and get the coverage in the magazines and all that stuff so it's weird that it took 25
6128260	6132340	years in reverse engineering to figure this one out especially when we're talking about another
6132340	6139620	character in the game that's a big fucking deal anyway act f says the super nintendo port of
6139620	6144260	street fighter alpha 2 is a technical prowess yeah for sure i've played that on super nintendo and
6144580	6149940	it's a miracle that it runs that's for sure but maybe that's also it is that you know that was
6149940	6157220	really one of the last games on super nintendo uh 96 when that came out right super nintendo
6157220	6163460	was really on its way out the door at that point so um yeah all right anyway um also on its way
6163460	6170660	out the door netflix not totally just the version that's on the wii u and the 3ds eshop uh the
6170660	6176980	service for netflix will discontinue in june the apps actually were already removed you cannot
6176980	6182420	download them they are gone uh if you already have the app you are able to redownload it but again
6182420	6188900	that will go away on june 30th uh you may or may not remember the wii version of netflix yes netflix
6188900	6194260	was on the wii uh was turned off a long time ago it was turned off back in 2019 what if i have the
6194260	6201620	disk then it's not going to work anymore that's the problem they want to do like a a firmware to
6201620	6207060	netflix there's some older tvs that won't run it anymore and stuff too so and to be able to do
6207060	6211460	things like uh bandersnatch and some of the other things that they're doing with netflix they have
6211460	6215860	to kind of get people off the old platforms so sorry to those that were uh holding out
6216900	6220100	loki what do you i'm sorry we're actually to dark sakura what do you have for us
6220100	6231620	uh well uh the uh total amount for agdq uh 2021 was 2.7 million for for the uh prevent cancer
6231620	6240740	foundation um and uh they even uh hit the uh uh the final uh god why can't i think of the name
6240740	6249700	the uh incentive to do yeah oh my god um to do uh the legend of zelda um ocarina of time uh
6249700	6256740	glitch exhibition which i hate this thing which was actually really really fun um but i started
6256740	6262340	nodding off because it was after midnight um it was it was really great it was really a lot of fun
6262340	6269460	um and then um a uh you know we know about limited run games right but they are doing

6402260	6406260	we want to travel around the world and check out release dates although i have a feeling january's
6406260	6411940	kind of a slow month but let's check in loki yeah so we've got a few games coming up this week
6411940	6417460	starting off with five nights at freddy's core collection on nintendo switch playstation 4 and
6417540	6426820	xbox one mx gp 2020 on playstation 5 and last but not least scott pilgrim versus the world the game
6426820	6434580	complete edition on pc nintendo switch playstation 4 xbox one and stadia there is nothing in japan
6434580	6441060	this week next week we get going again in japan dark sakura we have on the 12th of five nights at
6441060	6450020	freddy's uh core collection and then uh on uh this looks like the 14th uh mx gp 2020 the official
6450020	6456340	motorcross video game on playstation nice that'd be it all right let's get back into some other
6456340	6466660	news loki so apparently uh the roblox corporation the creators of roblox have valued themselves
6466660	6474500	at almost 30 billion dollars after a recent round of investments um of course they still haven't
6474500	6481380	um listed themselves directly yet on the actual stock market but um so far investing seems to be
6481380	6487540	going pretty well i know my kids play constantly so i wouldn't be surprised i hear about that game
6487540	6492340	a lot so and i i've never really gotten into it myself but because i think it's i'm not the right
6492340	6497700	audience for it but uh it's definitely not what i'm into yeah but i mean cool hey you know it
6497700	6505620	seems like kids learn a lot from it so all right yeah um something else you can learn a lot with
6505620	6512740	how to use a twitter avatar to play video games so this is very similar to maybe like uh twitch
6512740	6519700	plays pokemon but instead it's being done with somebody's twitter avatar via twitter now they
6519700	6524660	didn't suddenly figure out how to get like a fully animated twitter avatar that plays out in
6524660	6531700	real time but what's happening is that it's a bot that essentially updates a screenshot in an avatar
6531700	6541140	of pokemon red every 15 seconds so what you do you reply to a tweet and every 15 seconds it scans
6541140	6546580	the replies to that tweet and the button press that got the most tweets is the button that is
6546580	6552420	pressed and the avatar is updated and there it goes it's like the old ass webcam from olr's
6552420	6559940	second or third year it updates every 15 seconds but that's what it is and it it's a clever way to
6559940	6565940	do uh another type of twitch plays pokemon experiment which was the whole it goes back
6565940	6575620	to the whole um what is the analogy can a can a an animal type a novel if you leave a typewriter
6575620	6580500	in front of it or something like that like eventually it will type a novel uh eventually
6580500	6586660	twitter will beat pokemon red because eventually twitch did too with the help of supers superheroes
6586660	6592900	ah and what were the big pokemon names but like they all had ridiculous names because none of
6592900	6600500	it made sense so yeah oh there was the helix thing oh yeah that was a big thing yeah uh
6601140	6606500	jesus s 200 matt says i remember that webcam it was pointed at the guest couch right
6606500	6612340	yeah it was um so loki had actually built an old arcade cabinet and so the camera was on top of
6612340	6618660	the cabinet and pointed towards the couch that's how it is yeah dartitsu says something like a
6618660	6623060	thousand monkeys will eventually type shakespeare it's some it's something along those lines i
6623060	6629140	forget anyway um whatever happened to that cabinet look i think it was fucking gigantic
6629940	6636260	oh i just mantled it when i moved to the second apartment complex because it was upstairs and no
6637620	6645860	no no not moving that upstairs it was too big i never built it uh anyway i think uh what is what
6645860	6650660	is the linked i think it's a screen shakes is the twitter account if you want to check this out i'm
6650660	6654820	trying to trying to load that up now and verify and actually maybe get a peek at where they're
6654820	6661780	at in the game right now um but that is that is the account i believe yeah screen shakes is the
6661780	6668660	one and um i can't tell where they're at based on the avatar my knowledge of pokemon is not
6668660	6674660	that good i'd ask shane to help but he didn't like gen 1 although he still probably knows looks like
6674660	6679540	they're in some sort of town it's loading very slowly for me but yeah screen shake is the account
6679540	6687220	you can do uh to get in on that if you want to play some pokemon on twitter moving on i believed
6687220	6693780	our soccer is next well i might be look my mic's not moving i figured out what the problem was
6693780	6700740	um anyway uh epics games uh they have just recently announced the acquisition of a video
6700740	6711140	game software development company rad game tools um they're uh they basically were saying that um
6712580	6719540	that they are looking for them to assist with more photorealistic uh games and that they uh
6719540	6724340	that they're going to be partnering with epics rendering animation insights and audio teams
6724420	6732020	to bring that technology um into uh unreal engine and beyond that so they really uh
6732020	6739140	like what they do and say they're gonna play nice with them by buying them sounds pretty rad
6741940	6746980	all right uh but that's not the only thing we have to say about epic games right logan
6747940	6754660	uh right because as is the trend with a lot of this uh coronavirus and everything is that a lot
6754660	6761700	of malls aren't doing great especially since nobody can shop in them and in general i know
6761700	6769060	we have a local mall over here that's about ready to be shut down and bulldozed but um my childhood
6770020	6779780	apparently the uh terry town or the carrytown center which is a 980 000 square foot um site
6780820	6787460	and apparently it is this mall that epic is looking to purchase and they're going to
6788180	6796900	make that their brand new campus for um epic games and so they're going to open it in uh 2024
6797780	6803220	uh after they refurbish and rebuild the area so i don't know if they're going to tear down a lot
6803220	6808660	of that stuff but they're at least going to use the area to build their brand new campus but i
6808660	6814500	could see them like kind of just reusing them all well i hope they keep anti-ans like you know
6814500	6820100	there's certain there's certain things in the mall that really should stay that maybe the employees
6820100	6827940	will want to enjoy just based on you know looking at everything it the mall is pretty damn it yeah
6827940	6832980	it looks like sunrise mall that's what she's saying it looks like our mall yeah or pretty much
6832980	6838020	i can't help but think about that uh billy eilish is that her name that video or i always say
6838020	6844260	william eyelash like um in the sketch that was outside my life um but uh her video have you seen
6844260	6847780	that video where she's in the mall and she's just dancing around to see because the mall is
6847780	6852580	completely empty and then but for some reason all the food stuff seems to be open so she just
6852580	6859060	she just walks into anti-ans grabs a pretzel goes to potle gets a bag of chips and i love it because
6859060	6863780	it's just this whole like i'm just gonna eat all this stuff energy and i don't know what she's
6863780	6870740	trying to say with the video but i love it yeah i i do like the pretzel places like if if somebody
6870740	6876900	would work just all that stuff outside of like you know in the mall because man like there's
6876900	6883700	some of those like the uh it wasn't anti-ans they used to go to it was um cinnabon pretzel
6883700	6890980	no it's pretzel time okay oh the other one okay and um like those things are so soaked in butter
6892020	6897300	they're amazing like i would just like so our local grocery store chain over here really
6897300	6901220	actually started selling giant pretzels out of their bakery so that's pretty good but they're
6901220	6906820	not as they're not butter so like that stuff i mean like like going to wintels when i go to yeah
6907060	6914100	disneyland yeah so like now wintels um is it wintels pretzels pretzels pretzels pretzels yes
6915860	6921220	um yeah i need i need someone to sell them like that not the good pretzels like you know the
6921220	6927460	actual pretzels that you make the german pretzels but like i want the buttery ones that's what
6927460	6932660	because like was it um the dairy queen bought up orange julius i'm just about to make an orange
6933220	6940020	for a while and they were gonna have uh orange julius and and now they've discontinued the
6940020	6943620	machines there too i'm like where the hell am i gonna get my orange julius now it's not in the
6943620	6949140	mall it's not dairy queen i mean yeah i can make it to a home like i know how to make those but
6949140	6955220	like the authentic ones so like i can't get that anymore because they shut them all down
6955220	6959460	um as jonah matt mentions the piercing pagoda will be across from hr
6959700	6970180	things though with people buying the uh um store like buying the malls and turning them into uh
6970980	6976980	housing like transitional housing for the homeless i've heard of that too huh yeah i like that better
6976980	6980500	i just love the imagery of epic moving into a mall it's just kind of like you know oh you need
6980500	6988900	to get to finance okay just go through claire's um make a ride at sabaro all right teach your mom

7013460	7017780	all right enough enough mall jokes next there's a suncoast
7019540	7024900	there's still a suncoast i'm like the fuck where the what the one side well there's still a
7024900	7030420	blockbuster that's still on my to-do list if the pandemic doesn't finish it off i'd love to go but
7030420	7036580	i think the last blockbuster up in oregon that's now their whole like mo they have made it their
7036580	7039860	thing it's like we're a tourist destination now because we're the last blockbuster
7040500	7045700	the last blockbuster in the village that's right i am the only blockbuster
7049460	7055380	i just remember that suncoast was the only place that i could go in and buy subbed anime yes back
7055380	7062740	in the day yes because i did not i i don't know there's a lot of people have a fun place for that
7062740	7072020	you know mid 90s late 90s uh uh um voice acting uh you know dubbed voice acting but keep in mind
7072020	7076660	that a lot of the stuff that i started watching was like taped off of tv in japan or you know
7076740	7082980	off of tv in japan or you know sixth generation old fan subs so i wanted to continue with some
7082980	7087780	of the series that were now being commercially released with the same voices and it was the only
7087780	7095300	place that i could go get my ranma vhs tapes fansubbed not fansubbed just subtitled so and
7095300	7101300	they always cost more um i never got why they cost more dart tsuyin chat says i've seen people
7101300	7106340	do youtube vids making the trek to the last blockbuster video you know when i was doing
7106340	7109780	that road trip where i went to go visit shane back in like september october something like
7109780	7114740	that i really considered taking a detour through oregon so i could go there but it would have added
7114740	7119620	like six hours to my trip i needed another day so i could do it like it just wasn't gonna happen
7119620	7125220	that time but uh yeah one of these days uh when covet's over uh dark sakura we'll go on a road
7125220	7132420	trip all right sounds funny we'll go up there and we'll get some act popcorn with butter what was
7132420	7139540	the brand they sold in those stores all right anyway act one no they no act you can still get
7139540	7146260	act popcorn in the grocery store rob yeah okay well that normal what can what can i get that's
7146260	7154020	like specifically is the word oregonian uh anything with no sales tax someone else to
7154020	7159940	pump your gas well that's not what i'm talking about because we we were doing that like once
7159940	7166340	a year anyway when we went to to prosser washington to see danza and voodoo donuts
7166340	7174900	okay voodoo donuts i'll give it that so they are pretty good well and hey vanara can um can vouch
7174900	7181060	for me in our chat can vouch for me gwen can vouch for the the how i would save up paychecks to go by
7181780	7189700	my subtitled anime i love it and the raw version of uh that was like three generations old
7189940	7197780	of legend of the overfiend that we would uh make up our own uh dialogue to all right last story
7197780	7204260	tonight maybe suncoast would be exhibiting here at least attending if they were uh if they have
7204260	7209860	more than one store left but there is consumer electronics show this week that's right it is
7209860	7215940	happening january 11th through 14th but of course not happening in vegas across several convention
7216100	7222900	nope ces 2021 it's virtual just like uh everything else has been for the past year or so uh somebody
7222900	7226500	had just joined chat a minute ago going when was the last time you were all in the same room
7226500	7230660	march much like a lot of you march was the last time we were all in the same room so
7230660	7236020	uh and you know there hasn't really been big conventions since then yes i there's been some
7236020	7244340	ones but i was sick so i think february you're right well i had that cruise i had pneumonia
7244340	7249540	i was on the cruise i think we did one more episode here in studio after the cruise but it
7249540	7254980	was just right it was just loki and i you were sick i soon remember that yeah that was the start
7254980	7261540	and i had pneumonia for like six months yeah yeah all right and then i had pneumonia again go fig
7262180	7267460	all right anyway um so ces is going to be virtual this year uh there'll be you know like live
7267460	7272260	virtual showrooms live stream events and things like that uh and you know what honestly this year
7272260	7275940	you have a lot of companies that are just releasing stuff kind of early but you're not
7275940	7281620	going to be able to go to a room to see televisions anymore uh the laptop pcs and accessories connected
7281620	7287300	homes drones robots transportation virtual cars that's all expected to go online and they're
7287300	7295140	saying it's going to be a slower quieter show fuck off covet 19 um but that is that is what it is all
7295140	7299380	about but we might still get some news out of it um somebody had brought up in chat earlier it's
7299380	7304660	a good time for arcade one up to make some announcements usually um again a lot of those
7304660	7308500	like furniture in your house that do tech things this is a good time for that so we might get some
7308500	7313700	updates and sort of some sort of those types of collectibles but i wouldn't expect i mean very
7313700	7321060	rarely do we get big gaming news at ces even if e3 was a spin-off of ces back in the day i would say
7321060	7325540	the last big thing i remember ces was when microsoft game room was announced rest in peace
7325540	7329380	they did announce that at ces but i i don't i don't think anything like that's going to happen
7329380	7337220	not this year so all right um anyhow that brings us closer to the end of the show but before we
7337220	7341540	wrap up we like to check in with the listeners in the segment we call the listener round table so
7341540	7346340	um and i'm sorry the headline is wrong it's just a chat mailbag um because this is the part of the
7346340	7350980	show where we like to visit our mailbag as well every week we invite you guys to participate
7350980	7355860	participate at orange laundry.com is the place to send us emails and dark sakura will pick
7355860	7360500	um some to read on air if she has any one all right so let's let's get to our email tonight
7361380	7366820	all right um hello peoples during our time of social distancing i've gotten into cocktail
7366820	7372100	mixing the mixology app has been a great aid in this there is nothing that compares to the mixology
7372100	7377620	app on ios as far as cocktail mixing apps go there's nothing like it on android at all mixology
7377620	7383460	did not pay me to send this email this brings to mind a topic for the round table there are many
7383460	7388180	examples of games that are exclusive to one platform for which there are no comparison in
7388180	7397940	their genre which examples spring to your mind um i wish the emailer flash i wish the emailer given
7397940	7404740	us an example read that question one more time a genre that only exists on one no no no so there
7404740	7412580	are there's no comparison in their genre okay okay so i guess there's nothing really like
7412580	7417780	jumping flash on another system and it's just the first thing that sprang to mind um
7420100	7425140	um go back to the roots well i was gonna say the roots of the show the bimani stuff was always like
7425140	7428820	on playstation you didn't really see it anywhere else but then i guess rock band and guitar hero
7428820	7433380	kind of broke that mold and did um kind of put it everywhere because then my brain kind of goes to
7433380	7438660	those you know parappa the rapa but then again sega did have some pretty badass music games of
7438660	7445060	their own back in the day they were just very different um well you know what honestly fuck
7445060	7450900	go back to the dreamcast and look at a lot of those games we don't have anything like where's
7450900	7458340	where's samba de amigo where's uh space channel five where's crazy taxi i would say yeah you know
7458340	7463060	what those are my answers a lot of those like obscure sega dreamcast games that we love i don't
7463140	7467620	think we've seen anything unless the thing to keep in mind until they get ported to other stuff later
7467620	7473540	sorry is it a lot of those more obscure dreamcast games had a lot of their start in the arcade
7474980	7482740	yeah so and they could port their own games and but at the time sega was doing interesting things
7482740	7487540	in the arcades with um you know i i wish we had gotten like something for jumbo safari or
7487620	7493700	something for example that's another good one yeah but we were getting um you know the dreamcast
7493700	7501380	was essentially you know scaled down naomi uh hardware it would play the naomi games so i mean
7501380	7506100	the biggest thing that i was always pissed off that we never got was planet harrier on dreamcast
7506980	7514340	someone if someone like could convert that i would pay for it um but yeah i think that just more goes
7514340	7518580	in line with what sega was doing at that time but it's a good example i mean because we weren't
7518580	7523540	getting some of those same types of games on other systems um shane is pointing out in chat space
7523540	7528180	channel five had a vr release sequel thing not that long ago that's true you know i guess i guess
7528180	7533300	we have revisited those things a few times to move oh that's a good answer too that's a good one the
7533300	7538260	best to move series um my brain also went to how about that we haven't seen this in quite a long
7538260	7542900	time something like okay but i know i know what somebody somebody in chat is going to respond to
7542900	7549780	this instantly i will get there please point blank for uh you know that whole series and the
7549780	7557300	light gun genre in general we haven't seen that in a very long time now i've heard sharp shooter
7557300	7563060	but you know he i was here's where yyr brings up sharpshooter yes yes thank you for pointing out
7563060	7569860	also why yr that uh planet harrier karu and not naomi yeah so but i'm just saying something
7569860	7575700	something really back in that kind of like namco you know a shooter type of thing we haven't that
7575700	7579780	was kind of unique to that and we haven't seen anything like that in a long time i guess so no
7579780	7587300	namco is doing like the giant arcade ticket spitter thing so which is weird that's a tough question i
7587300	7590420	would have need i would need more time to think about that did the email or give us any of their
7590420	7596900	own examples no well i you need to email back who is it i'll get to it when i finish the email
7596900	7602500	all right go on please proceed also i'm intrigued about the possibility of the kentucky fried
7602500	7607140	console as i am always looking for something to do while using my air fryer besides impatiently
7607140	7612340	waiting for my tasty nom noms stay care redertainment skiing is the word i won't use
7612980	7618180	all right redertainment you email us back i i need i need your examples to this question that's
7618180	7625220	a tough question but you know what you know what a feature of the kfc console maybe a console warmer
7625220	7629540	is what we need on other uh consoles maybe it's maybe it's not the games it's the features
7630980	7636260	why would you want your consoles to be warmer did did you not just talk about how you wanted
7636260	7641460	the kfc console last week on the show to warm your chicken my chicken but i don't want something to
7641460	7646820	warm the console all right okay all right yes a warmer in the car if you know what i mean all
7646820	7653860	right well the actual exhaust from cooling this yes yes but i wouldn't put i wouldn't put chicken
7653860	7663540	anywhere near that exactly you know what i want uh something that'll keep my delicious calzone um
7663540	7671460	nice and uh nice and warm because i have a pizza oven now keep your hot pockets hot no no my pizza
7671460	7678500	stuff that i am making from scratch in a propane pizza oven excuse me have one now oh nice nice
7678500	7683300	and i want something that keeps it warm while i'm gaming all right i want to make some easy
7683300	7688180	bake oven cookies while i play games that'd be fun Trixie Mattel did like five videos of using
7688180	7694900	an easy bake oven and it's amazing even dan loves them just saying perfect you need to watch them
7694900	7701300	rob you really do all right uh hey your life will be improved hey live folks uh do you have any
7701300	7705380	questions for us in chat for the round table before we uh move on and wrap up the show shane
7705380	7710100	is saying i would kill for a new bus to move game same in fact he was the one that brought over the
7710260	7715300	spiritual successor whose name i can't remember in the moment dance summit that's it dance summit
7715300	7721860	of which i finally own a copy oh right yeah i remember that yeah yeah uh twitch.tv slash
7721860	7730100	vog network bobby blackwolf asks rugby baby or baby rugby uh and again different things i don't
7730100	7735940	know what rugby baby is you need to find out no spoilers go look up the sequence from uh
7736740	7741940	awesome games done quick it's on youtube and rugby baby just because that's how i heard it
7741940	7748020	the first time and the thing is that i think that with and i don't want to spoil it but i think that
7748020	7753540	bobby's question rugby baby or baby rugby would actually be two completely different things that
7753540	7757380	you wouldn't say this you use the term interchangeably for the same thing i think
7757380	7761940	it would actually be two completely different concepts they would but again i don't want to
7761940	7766500	i don't want to spoil every your homework assignment is to go watch because i'm not
7766500	7771300	going to protect you from spoilers next week audience all right okay so your homework
7771300	7776340	assignment is to go watch rugby baby because i will not protect you from spoilers next week
7776340	7780420	but but get this like the whole time that everyone was talking about that
7781300	7789060	the baby monkey song was going into my head but i was singing rugby baby rugby baby you know so
7789060	7794900	yeah all right uh let's see um there was one that scrolled off the screen real quick before
7794900	7800420	act if said something um oh sacred jade said scott pilgrim game physical release yeah we got
7800420	7804900	that in the rapid fire news but uh anybody planning on picking it up i don't think i'll
7804900	7808980	get the physical release but i will download the game for sure that was a good yeah and the
7808980	7814340	soundtrack is so fucking good um yeah i will definitely check out the game again for sure it
7814420	7822100	was a good game so all right um let's see one other ah yes act deft was asking in chat uh
7822100	7828260	what's a game you're looking forward to seeing released this year um good question i think a lot
7828260	7835300	of times we don't know about them yeah we don't know about them right now um yeah i i feel like
7835300	7842580	breath of the wild 2 this is the year for it and so that is the one i'm gonna say it's so hard we
7842580	7846740	just don't know what's coming out yet if starfield ends up being this year i'm very curious about
7846740	7852420	that i like space games i like the idea of a bethesda game in space i don't like the idea of
7852420	7856900	a buggy game in space so i hope they take the time to get it right so maybe it won't be this year
7856900	7861460	but um those are some titles off top my head that i'm looking forward to i'm trying to think i think
7861460	7866580	there's something in springtime i was looking forward to as well i can't remember them off top
7866580	7875460	my head so all right i can't really think of anything but breath of the wild 2 so yeah and my
7875460	7881860	possum game that someone's going to make pixel poops number two and and yeah pixel poops yyr
7881860	7888260	steam release and commodore release as well and so so when when they finally make this possum
7888260	7894260	game that you you're looking for and they decide to speed run it is it going to be possum games
7894260	7901780	done quick yeah yes there should be a special segment on eight on the next agdq called possum
7901780	7911060	games done quick uh s sj100 matt wants to know now that agdq is over uh among us vog edition when uh
7911060	7917860	soon trademark uh i am working on another vog project right now i uh i don't want to say much
7917860	7924820	more than that but it's coming soon trademark but yes that is on my my mind i wanted to do
7924820	7929460	more streaming this week and i think i actually did one that was the same time as awesome games
7929460	7933220	done quick but for obvious reasons i didn't want to do a lot and i certainly didn't want to do one
7933220	7939300	when bobby was going um so i i'm trying to get back in that habit but we did a really fun stream
7939300	7945780	uh of final fantasy 14 it was uh shad starzik and our buddy ray we were map hunting together and i
7945780	7949380	think we had a lot of fun with that because they built this whole thing in fantasy 14 where you
7949380	7954260	have like a big roulette wheel that spins in some map rooms and it's it's like a game show it's
7954260	7959700	really funny um so i'll try to do some more of that but um i also want to do like some dj max
7959700	7964260	streams and play some other games that aren't just final fantasy 14 although that one is uh
7964260	7968740	certainly a fun one to play all right well i think with that we're going to move to start to wrap up
