WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.360
I'm a big fan of making something good out of a bad thing.

00:12.360 --> 00:15.800
And in the spirit of popularity, diversity, meaning and frequency of use, Twitch is going

00:15.800 --> 00:19.000
to rotate PogChamp emotes once every 24 hours.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.800
This feature doesn't have to last forever, but it's going to be a good change-up of

00:21.800 --> 00:22.800
the formula.

00:22.800 --> 00:25.920
And hey, it'll be a lot better than those astroturfed Prime emotes they gave us after

00:25.920 --> 00:27.160
TwitchCon.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.160
This is just my hot take.

00:28.160 --> 00:31.840
It's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to explain more on this

00:31.840 --> 00:35.160
and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where every gamer has

00:35.160 --> 00:36.160
a voice.

00:36.160 --> 00:43.560
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back.

00:43.560 --> 00:49.640
It's another week of Orange Lounge Radio, live once again on this Sunday night for the

00:49.640 --> 00:56.520
second time in the year 2021, with episode number 851 of our show for this January the

00:56.520 --> 00:58.360
10th of 2021.

00:58.360 --> 01:04.320
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:04.320 --> 01:10.760
Hi, Jamie, I think you're muted on Discord, just so you know.

01:10.760 --> 01:11.760
Technical issues.

01:11.760 --> 01:12.760
They happen.

01:12.760 --> 01:13.760
I thought I had myself unmuted.

01:13.760 --> 01:14.760
I guess I must have hit something.

01:14.760 --> 01:15.760
That's all right.

01:15.760 --> 01:16.760
Hi.

01:16.760 --> 01:17.760
Hi.

01:17.760 --> 01:18.760
How are you?

01:18.760 --> 01:19.760
Okay.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.100
You were telling me before the show, and I hope you're willing to talk about it on air,

01:22.100 --> 01:25.680
you made a new friend on Twitter in the gaming universe, right?

01:25.680 --> 01:27.920
I did.

01:27.920 --> 01:31.520
And I've been following him for a while, and actually just having a little bit of back

01:31.520 --> 01:32.520
and forth chat.

01:32.520 --> 01:35.800
We talked about mics for a little bit, kind of what led to me, I think, buying the one

01:35.800 --> 01:36.800
that I did.

01:36.800 --> 01:37.800
Oh, nice.

01:37.800 --> 01:43.040
But Tommy Earl Jenkins, who is the voice of Die Hard Man, really, really just cool dude.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.000
In the game Death Stranding, for those who don't know.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.560
Yeah, in Death Stranding, sorry.

01:46.560 --> 01:50.760
But I've tried to check out some of his other stuff.

01:50.760 --> 01:55.600
He's honestly, I think, one of my favorite voices in the game as well.

01:55.600 --> 02:02.000
But I like when I get to connect with people like that and just talk shop, I guess, sometimes,

02:02.000 --> 02:06.640
and just talk about real life and do real people stuff.

02:06.640 --> 02:08.240
It's kind of a thing.

02:08.240 --> 02:10.800
I don't get super starstruck, I guess.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.660
Yeah, me neither.

02:12.660 --> 02:17.200
But I like getting to know people.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.300
I totally get it.

02:18.300 --> 02:23.440
It's the pros and the cons about Twitter, is that it makes celebrity culture and some

02:23.440 --> 02:27.720
of those people that you admire and even people that aren't necessarily gigantic celebrities,

02:27.720 --> 02:31.400
which with all due respect, I would put the voice actors on that level where they're not

02:31.400 --> 02:38.240
like Tom Cruise or a huge movie star or whatever, but they're known in certain circles or contestants

02:38.240 --> 02:39.240
on Drag Race.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.240
They're known in certain circles.

02:40.240 --> 02:45.840
So they get a lot of people able to tweet them directly, which is a good thing and it's

02:45.840 --> 02:46.840
a bad thing.

02:46.840 --> 02:50.760
Obviously, we know there's a lot of disgusting Twitter culture that happens with that direct

02:50.760 --> 02:56.200
accessibility such as people who bully other people and tag things and things that are

02:56.200 --> 02:58.160
completely unnecessary.

02:58.160 --> 03:03.560
But I think as Twitter and those types of services, Facebook, social media, is getting

03:03.560 --> 03:07.000
more ingrained in our culture, people are getting more like, okay, I'm just going to

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
block haters.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.700
I'm going to mute haters and able to filter that out a little bit, yes, a little better.

03:12.700 --> 03:17.180
Not that it ever excuses that type of behavior, but I think people are learning how to deal

03:17.180 --> 03:18.680
with it a little more.

03:18.680 --> 03:23.200
But the plus side of that, we talk a lot about the negative side of that, and I know Twitter

03:23.200 --> 03:28.720
and all that is a hot button issue this week, and I'm going to try to walk around that.

03:28.720 --> 03:35.740
But I think part of the positives about Twitter is that for those people in very smaller circles

03:35.740 --> 03:39.180
that might not be known to a lot of people, to tweet somebody a small little compliment

03:39.180 --> 03:43.940
like, hey, I loved your work, I'm curious, what kind of microphone do you use?

03:43.940 --> 03:47.280
That is awesome that you can just go to the source and ask that question.

03:47.280 --> 03:51.360
One thing to keep in mind, nobody owes you shit and you might not get an answer.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.380
You know this, Dark Saga, but I'm saying this for everybody else.

03:53.380 --> 03:57.640
You might not get an answer from somebody, but when you do, it feels really good and

03:57.640 --> 03:59.200
it's really cool, right?

03:59.200 --> 04:04.360
And over the years, many of you, I know we hear it a lot, we're not famous.

04:04.360 --> 04:08.900
We do the show a long time, doesn't mean people know who we are.

04:08.900 --> 04:11.220
We're known to certain people in certain groups, right?

04:11.220 --> 04:12.300
It's that same type of thing.

04:12.440 --> 04:18.320
When you guys reach out and tweet me or Jamie or Matt or whatever, and say, this is awesome,

04:18.320 --> 04:19.800
or hey, thanks for doing OLR.

04:19.800 --> 04:25.120
In fact, somebody sent me a tweet this past week just saying, oh man, when you were talking

04:25.120 --> 04:29.180
about the Guardian legend, I so agree with you, that game needs to come back, something

04:29.180 --> 04:30.180
along those lines.

04:30.180 --> 04:31.960
I was kind of talking about that.

04:31.960 --> 04:36.280
Even though that makes me feel really good and validates what we're doing here at OLR

04:36.280 --> 04:38.880
to have a pleasant exchange like that.

04:38.880 --> 04:40.500
I live for that shit.

04:40.500 --> 04:47.880
When you ask, how have you done OLR for 18 years, however old we are, 18 years, interactions

04:47.880 --> 04:53.140
like that, just people wanting to talk cool about video games and keep that going, that's

04:53.140 --> 04:54.140
my feel.

04:54.140 --> 04:55.140
So it's...

04:55.140 --> 04:56.140
I'd like more of that.

04:56.140 --> 04:57.140
Yeah.

04:57.140 --> 04:58.140
Oh yeah, of course.

04:58.140 --> 05:03.180
We have to remember, we're not that big, but I love for the audience that we do have and

05:03.180 --> 05:04.380
the interactions that we have.

05:04.380 --> 05:09.780
So that I'm sure applies to the voice actors that you've interacted with over the years

05:09.780 --> 05:12.740
on Twitter, for sure.

05:12.740 --> 05:20.300
And I've actually made some really good friends just running in some of those same circles.

05:20.300 --> 05:26.060
For me, honestly, I've actually found it to be a lot less toxic of an environment lately,

05:26.060 --> 05:29.200
especially since the...

05:29.200 --> 05:30.200
We all know.

05:30.200 --> 05:33.620
Undesirable population have been...

05:33.620 --> 05:34.620
We all know.

05:34.620 --> 05:35.620
Yes.

05:36.460 --> 05:41.060
But I've also found...

05:41.060 --> 05:46.860
And I don't know what this is exactly, because people are posting this stuff.

05:46.860 --> 05:54.580
Doomscrolling is a thing, it exists for a reason, the phrase, but I've noticed that

05:54.580 --> 06:02.160
it's a little bit more inundating on Facebook because people...

06:02.200 --> 06:07.000
It's in a compartmentalized area, I guess, if that makes sense.

06:07.000 --> 06:15.160
And people are more just likely to make a bunch of comments on it, whereas on Twitter,

06:15.160 --> 06:19.340
I think it's kind of harder to see some of the comments.

06:19.340 --> 06:25.920
And you can mute the thread, and now you can remove...

06:25.920 --> 06:29.400
When people reply to it, you can ask them to remove you from it.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.400
Yes.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.960
Finally have that limiting who can reply feature.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.320
Well, I don't know if Bobby Blackwolf ever did get it.

06:35.320 --> 06:38.760
He might be the one person on Twitter without it, which sucks, sorry, Bobby.

06:38.760 --> 06:44.220
But I think everybody on Twitter, other than Bobby, has this feature where you can limit

06:44.220 --> 06:47.480
to certain replies, and that's a great thing too, I think.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.280
Because sometimes I wanna post something and be like, I'm just gonna say this, get this

06:50.280 --> 06:52.200
out in the universe, get it out of my brain.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.920
I don't wanna talk about it after this.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.960
And it took way too long to come to Twitter, and I'm happy it's there.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.740
Aw, Bobby still doesn't have that feature.

06:59.740 --> 07:01.300
I don't know what's wrong, bro.

07:01.300 --> 07:04.140
I haven't even looked for it.

07:04.140 --> 07:05.140
It's there.

07:05.140 --> 07:06.140
Maybe you don't have it either.

07:06.140 --> 07:07.140
That would be strange.

07:07.140 --> 07:08.140
Oh, I see it.

07:08.140 --> 07:09.140
I have it.

07:09.140 --> 07:10.140
So yeah, you can...

07:10.140 --> 07:12.020
People you follow, only people you mention, everyone.

07:12.020 --> 07:13.020
It's great.

07:13.020 --> 07:18.340
So anyway, we gotta introduce everybody here on the show that our folks out there like

07:18.340 --> 07:21.380
to follow, and that includes Techmaster Loki joining us tonight.

07:21.380 --> 07:22.380
Hello.

07:22.380 --> 07:23.380
Hi, Loki.

07:23.380 --> 07:24.380
How are you?

07:24.380 --> 07:25.380
I'm doing okay.

07:25.380 --> 07:26.380
Good, good.

07:26.380 --> 07:27.540
What's the game playing behind you tonight?

07:27.540 --> 07:29.960
I can't quite tell.

07:29.960 --> 07:30.960
Is that Zelda?

07:30.960 --> 07:34.500
You don't recognize it from AGDQ?

07:34.500 --> 07:35.500
I'm trying to...

07:35.500 --> 07:39.620
No, I can't, because I can't see the main character in it, because you're sitting in

07:39.620 --> 07:40.620
front of him.

07:40.620 --> 07:41.620
Your head's in the way.

07:41.620 --> 07:42.620
Yeah, your head's in the way.

07:42.620 --> 07:43.620
I can't tell.

07:43.620 --> 07:44.620
What did it...

07:44.620 --> 07:45.620
Just tell me.

07:45.620 --> 07:46.620
Is that I Wanna Be The Guy or something?

07:46.620 --> 07:49.660
It's Epic Dumpster Bear 2.

07:49.660 --> 07:51.980
Oh, it sure is.

07:51.980 --> 07:52.980
Okay, okay.

07:52.980 --> 07:56.980
I admittedly tuned out right before that run started.

07:56.980 --> 07:57.980
But nothing.

07:57.980 --> 08:01.980
I loved AGDQ, but just trying to live my life too.

08:01.980 --> 08:04.820
So yeah, okay, I got it, got it.

08:04.820 --> 08:09.200
Speaking of awful games, but with a wink, how is development of Pixel Poops number two,

08:09.200 --> 08:10.200
your game going?

08:10.200 --> 08:12.260
It was kind of slow this week.

08:12.260 --> 08:15.900
I did work on some animation stuff, so I was drawing a dog.

08:15.900 --> 08:17.460
Yeah, and you know what?

08:17.460 --> 08:19.900
Now that I'm asking you this, I know we talked about this on Twitter where it's kind of one

08:19.900 --> 08:20.900
of those...

08:20.900 --> 08:24.180
We all had a lot on our minds this week, so I think we all were a little slower this week,

08:24.180 --> 08:25.180
and that's fine.

08:25.180 --> 08:31.860
Yeah, it was hard to get motivated to do more intensive stuff like that, so I played a lot

08:31.860 --> 08:36.860
of Minecraft instead, literally doing just chores.

08:36.860 --> 08:43.460
It's like, oh, I gotta go fix this path so it looks nicer, or, oh, hey, we're low on

08:43.460 --> 08:44.460
these supplies.

08:44.460 --> 08:46.380
I'm gonna go mine for a while.

08:46.380 --> 08:48.040
Just stupid stuff like that.

08:48.040 --> 08:52.500
I think everybody had to do what they needed to do for their mental health, and admittedly,

08:52.500 --> 08:57.500
I did not watch the entirety of Bobby's hosting run on Wednesday because I could not tear

08:57.500 --> 08:58.500
myself away from the news.

08:58.500 --> 09:02.740
I just physically could not do it, which probably wasn't the greatest thing for my mental health,

09:02.740 --> 09:04.420
admittedly, but it is what it is.

09:04.420 --> 09:08.620
You put Twitch up on the TV using one of your consoles and take out the iPad.

09:08.620 --> 09:11.900
I know, but I'm so bad at multitasking.

09:11.900 --> 09:12.900
Normal people can do that.

09:12.900 --> 09:13.900
I can't.

09:13.900 --> 09:14.900
I don't know what it is.

09:14.900 --> 09:20.220
Let's not have you ever test out any more iterations of that for YYR.

09:20.220 --> 09:21.220
Right?

09:21.220 --> 09:27.260
Yeah, I'm not very good at doing pixel art, so it was surprising.

09:27.260 --> 09:33.260
It was very challenging just to get a four frame walk animation with a dog into such

09:33.260 --> 09:39.700
a small sprite, and it ended up turning out okay.

09:39.700 --> 09:44.120
So anyway, but yeah, I was gonna mention it later in the show, but hell, I'll do it now.

09:44.120 --> 09:47.340
Big congratulations to Bobby Blackwell and the entire crew.

09:47.340 --> 09:51.400
It's much more than one person, but obviously we're partial to our buddy who we've been

09:51.400 --> 09:54.900
working with here on Sunday nights for what, like 15 years, probably more.

09:54.900 --> 09:59.580
I literally have so long I've lost track and helping with the hosting and helping to raise

09:59.580 --> 10:00.940
money for a great charity.

10:00.940 --> 10:03.900
I have a story on it later in the show, so you're gonna hear it twice, but I think it

10:03.900 --> 10:10.300
was something like 2.7 million they raised for prevent cancer foundation via AGDQ.

10:10.300 --> 10:14.780
And the fact that everything is virtual and the fact that they had to compete with all

10:14.780 --> 10:17.980
the crap going on in the world is pretty stunning.

10:17.980 --> 10:23.380
So big ups to the speedrunners, the hosts, the producers, the behind the seniors, everybody

10:23.380 --> 10:26.900
and everyone that made that happen, because it was a beautiful charity thing.

10:26.900 --> 10:30.300
So congrats, that's for sure.

10:30.300 --> 10:35.340
Anyhow, let's get into our show and the things we want to talk about tonight.

10:35.340 --> 10:38.180
So it's a little bit slower of a news week.

10:38.180 --> 10:42.260
We do have some things to get into, but obviously coming off of the holidays, there's not a

10:42.260 --> 10:44.220
lot of big game releases.

10:44.220 --> 10:48.180
The hype machine hasn't started for 2021 just yet.

10:48.180 --> 10:52.620
Consumer electronics show is coming up this week, albeit very, very different because

10:52.620 --> 10:55.340
of the world, I'm sure you all know.

10:55.340 --> 11:00.700
But CES would be about the first point where we start to get some actual gaming, big gaming

11:00.700 --> 11:01.740
ticket items.

11:01.740 --> 11:03.820
So it's still a little slower this week.

11:03.820 --> 11:08.020
So this, and we'll get into what news there is coming up a little bit, but this is a good

11:08.020 --> 11:12.900
time for us to continue to kind of reflect not just on the last year, which we did last

11:12.900 --> 11:15.500
week, but what's ahead, which is what we're going to do this week.

11:15.500 --> 11:20.220
So we have to do this virtually tonight because usually what we would do is Dark Soccer, Loki

11:20.220 --> 11:25.540
and myself would write on some little scraps of paper and we would fill up Mr. Vader here

11:25.540 --> 11:26.540
for the podcast listeners.

11:26.540 --> 11:30.660
I'm holding up a little tin that looks like Darth Vader, but it's more cylindrical.

11:30.660 --> 11:33.660
And we're going to lock him in this little time capsule and we're going to read him at

11:33.660 --> 11:37.560
the start of next year and laugh at how bad our predictions were.

11:37.560 --> 11:41.840
And I think I left the one about Half-Life 3 in here just because that's going to be

11:41.840 --> 11:44.200
in there every year I've decided.

11:44.200 --> 11:47.280
All right, until the end of time.

11:47.280 --> 11:52.280
In fact, honestly, bury me with this so somebody can find the sliver of paper in a thousand

11:52.280 --> 11:55.760
years that says, did Half-Life 3 ever fucking happen?

11:55.760 --> 12:00.260
All right, moving on.

12:00.260 --> 12:01.260
Let's get into some...

12:01.260 --> 12:02.260
Rob.

12:02.260 --> 12:03.260
What?

12:03.260 --> 12:05.800
If it ever does come out, then we need to have a ritual burning.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.320
Oh, of the paper?

12:07.320 --> 12:08.320
Of the paper.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.320
I'm down with that.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.000
Let's bring a little fire to Orange Launch Radio.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
That sounds safe.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
All right.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.520
We're chanting to the tune of an ABBA song.

12:15.520 --> 12:16.680
All right.

12:16.680 --> 12:18.560
Burning things to the songs of ABBA.

12:18.560 --> 12:23.480
That sounds like a segment on Understation Live or something, but anyway, let's get into

12:23.480 --> 12:24.480
2021 predictions.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.560
So we're going to do this virtually this year.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.120
I'm going to just kind of know everything down.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.120
I'll print it out.

12:29.120 --> 12:32.580
We'll put it in there for next year and we'll do it that way.

12:32.580 --> 12:35.820
So I'm going to go around and see some of the host predictions for this year.

12:35.820 --> 12:39.380
And then we're going to go to chat and get some of yours because we do tape live over

12:39.380 --> 12:44.620
at twitch.tv slash vog network, the voice geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network

12:44.620 --> 12:48.660
every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby

12:48.660 --> 12:49.860
Black Wolf show.

12:49.860 --> 12:51.900
So let's get into some predictions.

12:51.900 --> 12:53.260
All right.

12:53.260 --> 12:54.460
I will start.

12:54.460 --> 12:55.460
I'll do my first.

12:55.460 --> 12:59.220
I never go first in these segments, so it's time for me to go first.

12:59.220 --> 13:04.060
And I'm going to do this one first because I knew I wanted to say this as a prediction

13:04.060 --> 13:08.740
and then some, some leaks came out today that are going to make it look like I'm leaning

13:08.740 --> 13:09.740
into this.

13:09.740 --> 13:12.740
So you guys are going to have to trust me that I was thinking of this before the leaks.

13:12.740 --> 13:13.740
Okay.

13:13.740 --> 13:15.460
And I don't think the leaks are necessarily true.

13:15.460 --> 13:17.900
I'm going to explain how my predictions a little bit different.

13:17.900 --> 13:19.980
I want to talk about switch pro.

13:19.980 --> 13:21.220
Okay.

13:21.220 --> 13:27.200
My prediction, my prediction that I'm writing in is that Nintendo switch pro ain't all that.

13:27.200 --> 13:32.560
Now it doesn't mean it's going to be bad, but it's not going to do 4k handheld gaming.

13:32.560 --> 13:37.600
And I don't really think it's going to do like, like, I think it will support 4k and

13:37.600 --> 13:42.400
the way that PlayStation pro supported 4k, but I don't think it's going to be more powerful

13:42.400 --> 13:47.240
really than it certainly is not going to be as powerful as PlayStation five or Xbox series

13:47.240 --> 13:49.380
X, a hundred percent.

13:49.380 --> 13:50.800
It'll probably upscale that.

13:50.800 --> 13:51.800
I think either.

13:51.800 --> 13:52.800
Yeah.

13:52.800 --> 13:55.720
And I know the leak talked about upscaling, which honestly hadn't come to my mind, but

13:55.720 --> 14:01.200
I was thinking like interface menus, statics, things like that would probably be 4k, but

14:01.200 --> 14:04.880
I don't think the games themselves are going to be as 4k as you want.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.200
It doesn't make the games worse.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.520
Nintendo still makes great games.

14:07.520 --> 14:11.640
I'm just saying, I think a lot of the pipe dream people have in their heads about 4k

14:11.640 --> 14:16.600
breath of the wild part two, I don't think that is going to be a reality, but I do think

14:16.600 --> 14:19.720
we will get a switch pro holiday.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.660
I don't think it's coming any sooner than a holiday.

14:21.660 --> 14:24.300
And I think they're going to do it that way to time it with breath of the wild part two

14:24.300 --> 14:26.300
is one of the release titles for it.

14:26.300 --> 14:29.420
So that's my first prediction for 2021 for sure.

14:29.420 --> 14:32.020
So all right.

14:32.020 --> 14:36.260
And looking in chat, act def says you're stealing one of my cohost predictions that the switch

14:36.260 --> 14:39.940
pro ain't pro and more like a 1.3 version of the console.

14:39.940 --> 14:43.020
You know, again, with the leaks today, I think a lot of people are going to be leaning into

14:43.020 --> 14:47.760
that a little bit, but it's more of those things that the leaks make sense, I think.

14:47.760 --> 14:49.860
So I'm kind of piggybacking on it.

14:49.860 --> 14:55.420
I don't necessarily know if I buy the up sample everywhere part of that.

14:55.420 --> 15:00.500
Like I kind of think that's why I'm not totally leaning into those leaks, but I think elements

15:00.500 --> 15:02.500
of it are right.

15:02.500 --> 15:07.500
So, all right, anyhow, let's talk to dark soccer.

15:07.500 --> 15:08.500
Why not?

15:08.500 --> 15:09.500
What's what's up?

15:09.500 --> 15:10.500
Did I really?

15:10.500 --> 15:11.500
Yes, you did.

15:11.500 --> 15:12.500
I, you stole mine.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.640
That's exactly what I was going to do.

15:14.640 --> 15:15.640
I'm sorry.

15:15.640 --> 15:16.640
So no, you're not.

15:16.640 --> 15:17.640
You're right.

15:17.640 --> 15:18.640
I'm not.

15:18.640 --> 15:19.640
Well, what's your other?

15:20.420 --> 15:22.420
What's the next one on your list then?

15:22.420 --> 15:29.440
Well, I said that some kind soul is going to make me a game featuring possums.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.480
Did dark soccer get a possum game?

15:31.480 --> 15:36.640
Yeah, I need a game with possums.

15:36.640 --> 15:41.120
In 16 bit fashion.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.120
Now so much.

15:42.120 --> 15:45.700
Sorry, I'm quiet, but I'm typing these out as as they're being sick because I have no

15:45.700 --> 15:48.060
advanced knowledge of what these predictions are.

15:48.480 --> 15:49.820
Now, what about the old adage?

15:49.820 --> 15:53.920
If you want something bad enough, you got to do it yourself ain't doing shit.

15:53.920 --> 15:54.920
This is a prediction.

15:54.920 --> 15:59.540
So I'm predicting that somebody is going to be really nice to me and do me a possum adventure

15:59.540 --> 16:00.540
or possum platformer.

16:00.540 --> 16:03.980
It isn't like rocket night adventure.

16:03.980 --> 16:08.040
It's a possum on four legs doing possum things like you have to find trash.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.040
I like that.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.040
And you make friends.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.580
Possum things.

16:11.580 --> 16:14.180
Do something awesome today.

16:14.180 --> 16:16.360
And he has to make friends.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.320
My possum has to make make friends.

16:18.320 --> 16:21.600
He has to have a mama possum who has lots of babies.

16:21.600 --> 16:27.440
And then has to make friends with a raccoon who is literally named trash panda.

16:27.440 --> 16:31.160
And a skunk.

16:31.160 --> 16:35.240
And it's gonna be an active just named it's gonna be called be possum today.

16:35.240 --> 16:37.240
I just said that.

16:37.240 --> 16:42.480
That's what you're saying I take the name is called be possum today.

16:42.480 --> 16:43.480
Okay.

16:43.880 --> 16:48.600
Someone has a yeah and like for Norris says he has to eat ticks for energy.

16:48.600 --> 16:54.200
Kate catastrophe and Chad says awesome possum kicks Dr. Machino's butt.

16:54.200 --> 16:59.400
That's actually I think like a real thing is it really yeah it's awesome possum that's

16:59.400 --> 17:03.240
what I'm like trying not to be I want it to be a little four legged possum that jumps

17:03.240 --> 17:09.740
up and platforms and has to find garbage and scream at people it's power to stuns its enemies

17:09.740 --> 17:13.360
by screaming at it you want a literal garbage video game.

17:13.400 --> 17:19.640
I want a garbage video game starring a possum okay and if someone will make it for me I

17:19.640 --> 17:25.040
will write the entire story for it I just need I need I need this I need this to be

17:25.040 --> 17:32.620
my game of 2021 well you could do it like like epic dumpster or after epic dumpster

17:32.620 --> 17:38.360
bear does it's all unity assets I don't like that kind of game though I want it to be like

17:38.360 --> 17:45.840
a like a like a Sonic ish kind of game you know jumping on platforms and climbing things

17:45.840 --> 17:51.340
and not like doing the midair spins and stuff like that I just want I just want to jump

17:51.340 --> 17:57.080
around and eat garbage now since dark Sakura has availability on her list because I ruthlessly

17:57.080 --> 18:02.940
stole one of her answers without knowing it chat if you have some predictions why don't

18:02.940 --> 18:06.980
you start yelling them out in our chat room over twitch.tv slash vog networks that dark

18:06.980 --> 18:13.760
soccer can steal one of your answers sound like a plan all right I love her she'll come

18:13.760 --> 18:18.800
up with something else I want him to go fast I want him to walk really funny hey moving

18:18.800 --> 18:22.960
on we got three hours show we're not going to talk about possums for two hours two and

18:22.960 --> 18:31.480
a half hours all right speaking yeah speaking of going fast okay Microsoft is going to quickly

18:31.480 --> 18:40.940
acquire Sega in 2021 okay this fan wank rumors been going around for like four years why

18:40.940 --> 18:47.740
why and how low key to it even more because they got to figure out how to get in on the

18:47.740 --> 18:57.900
Japanese side of the house and honestly they're not gonna purchase Konami so say it is okay

18:57.900 --> 19:03.520
good prediction my next prediction I wanted to throw something in for the Intellivision

19:03.520 --> 19:09.220
amico because I think a lot of people are going to overlook that this year and my prediction

19:09.220 --> 19:13.520
for 2021 would have been one of my predictions oh my bad well you maybe maybe yours will

19:13.520 --> 19:18.760
be different because that it would be overlooked oh well no no that's actually not the prediction

19:18.760 --> 19:24.760
my prediction is a little bit opposite I'm gonna say the amico will do okay it's certainly

19:24.760 --> 19:28.960
gonna have better success than the VCS but I don't think and I'm willing to say this

19:28.960 --> 19:35.540
I don't think it's gonna tank as hard as a lot of internet people want to think it will

19:35.540 --> 19:40.700
I think the amico will do okay and what I mean by that is that like it's not gonna be

19:40.700 --> 19:46.840
like oodles and oodles of cash but it will it will break even enough to pay everybody

19:46.840 --> 19:51.260
salaries that worked on it and a little little extra chunk of change for a future project

19:51.260 --> 19:55.520
and it's gonna do it's good it's gonna be all right and that's that's my guess for amico

19:55.520 --> 19:59.660
but I think it will survive I think it will be supported through all of 2021 I think they

19:59.660 --> 20:03.220
will I think with the April release they will continue to push it more and more through

20:03.220 --> 20:07.060
the holidays and I think it's something that won't be able to be gauged on its release

20:07.060 --> 20:11.060
right out the gate I think this is truly something we have to evaluate at the beginning of next

20:11.060 --> 20:14.600
year when it's been on the shelf through a holiday period that hopefully looks a little

20:14.600 --> 20:20.280
more like a normal holiday period than this last year did so so I'm sensing a theme with

20:20.280 --> 20:27.000
Robin and 2021 it's just gonna be okay it's not gonna be great you know I'll be terrible

20:27.000 --> 20:31.180
just okay around Wednesday I was like this is gonna be another shitty year and then on

20:31.180 --> 20:41.040
Friday I was like actually 2021 showed up today and said I think the fuck not so anything

20:41.040 --> 20:49.380
I 2021 anything can happen 20 roller coaster and it just been like a week 2021 it might

20:49.380 --> 20:55.720
be kind of possum speaking of which dark Sakura do you have another prediction for

20:55.720 --> 21:03.560
the can a serious one sure so even though my possum one was very very serious I'm not

21:03.560 --> 21:11.620
joking about it I think that we're going to see online communities move off of things

21:11.620 --> 21:18.000
like just standard internet and smartphone platforms maybe not a move but we're gonna

21:18.000 --> 21:27.420
see the new big social media network be in-game networks where I like where you're going with

21:27.420 --> 21:32.940
this gone you can so you can be involved in it kind of like have like think of PSO for

21:32.940 --> 21:37.820
a moment right mm-hmm imagine that you were in your lobby and PSO and you chat with people

21:37.820 --> 21:41.380
in the lobby and you can then chat with your group while you're in your game right you're

21:41.380 --> 21:47.820
like even in Wow but you also have an observer mode where you can join in on other people's

21:47.820 --> 21:54.200
games as an observer and and follow cam with like one of the characters who you know one

21:54.200 --> 21:59.600
of the people that someone's playing okay sorry sorry I don't mean interrupts but something

21:59.600 --> 22:04.540
that comes to mind because it I'm not saying it exists but it's bubbling under the surface

22:04.540 --> 22:08.320
because I've heard about this and so maybe this is the type of year that it comes through

22:08.320 --> 22:11.720
there's a thing called clubhouse and you can only get in with an invite right now so I

22:11.720 --> 22:15.280
don't know a lot about it and I know Twitter is trying to launch competitor to it but it's

22:15.280 --> 22:21.260
like these audio chat rooms that are set up for people to discuss certain topics and they

22:21.260 --> 22:26.140
might be serious like social things that need to be discussed like you know being black

22:26.140 --> 22:30.460
in America might be one of these rooms and you you can draw and with dark soccer when

22:30.460 --> 22:33.380
you talk about eavesdrop you don't necessarily have to participate you can eavesdrop in other

22:33.380 --> 22:38.100
conversations like that's the type of thing that clubhouse and the new potential Twitter

22:38.100 --> 22:41.980
feature is supposed to allow you to do now again these haven't really taken off yet they're

22:41.980 --> 22:46.080
still kind of because I think the big question still has to be answered how do we moderate

22:46.080 --> 22:51.220
this because this could be a nightmare in in trade but you're kind of taking this one

22:51.220 --> 22:57.000
step further into games and I think that's kind of cool exactly and it basically also

22:57.000 --> 23:07.340
will go into the realm of things like say eSports for example like you can sell tickets

23:07.340 --> 23:13.640
to an event and you all sign it kind of like actually how stage it does their things where

23:13.640 --> 23:23.040
you not necessarily like a bid but you I'm trying to think of how to phrase this like

23:23.040 --> 23:27.240
you know you do like you pay for however much the minimum is for your ticket you can tip

23:27.240 --> 23:32.620
more if you want to and then you can attend a virtual concert inside a game environment

23:32.620 --> 23:37.300
or it takes to like a live stream of something but it's all done through our various game

23:37.300 --> 23:43.600
gaming consoles and I think that one of the selling points for future consoles is that

23:43.600 --> 23:49.340
this would be an integrated thing that all of them use for cross console watching and

23:49.340 --> 23:54.200
for a lot of you know like say if you're on a PlayStation and you go to watch somebody's

23:54.200 --> 24:00.920
game on an Xbox for example do you of course will get ads or you might have to have like

24:00.920 --> 24:07.320
pay for an extra tier of account for cross-platform gaming in a cross-platform chat or something

24:07.320 --> 24:16.200
in a small way you're almost describing PlayStation home but like 2.0 like next like evolution

24:16.200 --> 24:20.400
type of thing I get where you're going because I think I actually like the more you explain

24:20.400 --> 24:25.740
your idea the more I'm kind of like I get it because there's a lot again a lot of things

24:25.740 --> 24:30.800
bubbling under the surface you talk about the virtual concerts Fortnite has put its

24:30.800 --> 24:35.020
foot in the water and dealing with those we just haven't seen something like that gel

24:35.020 --> 24:41.940
together where it's like Fortnite is known as the virtual concert space like it hasn't

24:41.940 --> 24:46.700
gelled together in a big way yet and I think if I'm hearing right you're saying this is

24:46.700 --> 24:52.900
the year it comes together in a big way for some tech company or even you know extended

24:52.900 --> 24:59.500
into like a you know like an internet thing where you can you know live stream whatever

24:59.500 --> 25:03.100
the game people are on or you have it through steam when you can join in on your game that

25:03.100 --> 25:11.660
way too but I'm thinking of making it something that's just beyond just an online social media

25:11.660 --> 25:16.240
thing and have it be an integrated network and then you know now I think like future

25:16.240 --> 25:21.340
down the line where you like plug into this thing like the fucking matrix and live in

25:21.340 --> 25:25.940
it I guess or you know I don't know that would be that would be a little bit crazy

25:25.940 --> 25:31.700
but it's just sort of where I'm going for certain things I guess I want to think of

25:31.700 --> 25:43.180
something that's going to have longevity and it's hard for me to describe exactly that

25:43.180 --> 25:49.380
but I want it to be something that would go forward yeah no I get it I think it's a great

25:49.380 --> 25:53.340
addiction let's let's write it down see what happens maybe if we don't see something fully

25:53.340 --> 25:57.320
realized we might see though you know kind of kind of check in on how are some of these

25:57.320 --> 26:01.800
things growing that I'm saying or like you know they're kind of bubbling under yet and

26:01.800 --> 26:06.320
I know chat I'm looking at you know Bobby Black Wolf is saying VR chat alt space VR

26:06.320 --> 26:10.120
big screen I'll do these kinds of things but you don't need VR to use them yes but and

26:10.120 --> 26:15.600
so does Fortnite but none of these places are like the definitive you know spot for

26:15.600 --> 26:21.040
this type of stuff nothing's quite gelled together in that sort of way yet and I think

26:21.040 --> 26:24.660
especially coming off of this pandemic and I talked about some of this on last week show

26:24.660 --> 26:30.560
how my work is looking at moving into a an environment very very similar to those types

26:30.560 --> 26:34.160
of things I'm not going to get too detailed because I it would be wrong of me to give

26:34.160 --> 26:40.000
all the details but it's like a similar thing and I think I think that could evolve into

26:40.000 --> 26:45.800
some type of like known as a social media platform for all of that and I and a wider

26:45.800 --> 26:50.840
adoption of one of those or maybe a couple of those things so it'd be interesting to

26:50.840 --> 26:55.400
see for sure one of my other thoughts is actually expanding something like this into a business

26:55.400 --> 27:00.800
environment as well because you know zoom by itself is one thing but if you have like

27:00.800 --> 27:08.540
a virtual meeting room you know you and I need to talk off air okay it's it's it is

27:08.540 --> 27:17.380
out there I can tell you so yeah but again how widely adopted yeah how why everybody

27:17.380 --> 27:21.840
knows zoom not everybody knows these other things yet this might be the year we find

27:21.840 --> 27:28.340
out anyway for time let me go ahead and move on Loki what is your next prediction my next

27:28.340 --> 27:33.020
prediction is that volition is going to announce the next Saints Row game I know it's being

27:33.020 --> 27:39.400
worked on they just have to announce it safe prediction but a good one it's about that

27:39.400 --> 27:44.620
time right yeah exactly well they've already committed or I've already commented that they're

27:44.620 --> 27:50.960
working on one just you know what is it when is it you know yeah so you're saying this

27:50.960 --> 27:56.500
year is the year for Saints Row beyond a tweet saying yeah we're doing it months yes obviously

27:56.500 --> 28:00.220
I don't anticipate they'll come out this year all right I would like you never know you

28:00.220 --> 28:06.220
never know you never know all right my last prediction so here's my real crazy one I've

28:06.220 --> 28:11.220
always got to have a crazy one in there so my last prediction that I have is twitch is

28:11.220 --> 28:17.300
going to get another viable competitor because I think you know twitch is kind of not gone

28:17.300 --> 28:23.620
very checked by a lot of you know yes there's YouTube YouTube doesn't lie to monetize as

28:23.620 --> 28:30.980
easily as twitch does and some of these others and I'm gonna go so far as to say I think

28:30.980 --> 28:38.660
the shot is gonna come from Twitter I think Twitter is going to launch a twitch competitor

28:38.660 --> 28:43.500
and I think because we know they have the technology from their acquisition of periscope

28:43.500 --> 28:49.460
I'm not sure that has really leveraged a lot for them but I don't know it's just it's just

28:49.460 --> 28:54.420
what my gut says so I'm gonna go with it I feel like twitch might be the ones or excuse me Twitter

28:54.420 --> 28:59.820
might be the ones to take a shot at what twitch has going on and we're not gonna talk about

28:59.820 --> 29:07.620
Facebook gaming we don't validate it all right let's dark soccer were you able to find a third

29:07.620 --> 29:19.300
one I think that we're going to see gaming in and of itself become and this is gonna be a

29:19.300 --> 29:28.460
very safe bet but I think we're even gonna see it perhaps surpassing professional sports as a big

29:28.460 --> 29:36.540
moneymaker in the US economy it might already be there I I don't think it's coming that way that's

29:36.540 --> 29:40.180
why I said this one's pretty much safe you're right this is a safe bet game mostly this year

29:40.180 --> 29:45.860
games will continue to make money and a lot of it but you know what you know what this is an

29:45.860 --> 29:52.340
industry that has always assumed a safe path and it hasn't always worked out that way 1983 called

29:52.340 --> 29:59.940
and said hello right so and I want to say there's been prior years where maybe not us but other

29:59.940 --> 30:03.380
shows I've listened to has gone so far as to say there's gonna be another video game crash this

30:03.380 --> 30:10.100
year so you're doing the opposite of that you're saying gaming's in a safe place we're gonna

30:10.100 --> 30:15.420
continue to make money we're gonna it's it's gonna continue to be mainstream and it's gonna

30:15.500 --> 30:19.260
get to the point where because and you know you talk about sports and I think especially with

30:19.260 --> 30:24.020
the pandemic and everything going on where more people can't go watch sports now again we hope

30:24.020 --> 30:32.140
that at the end of 2021 it's not like this anymore or it's it's on that path to what we remember but

30:32.140 --> 30:39.260
I I get it I I think yeah I think I think yes it's a safe pick but I don't think it's a complete

30:39.260 --> 30:47.420
100% guarantee go ahead it's not necessarily just going to be the fact that it's going to be these

30:47.420 --> 30:51.980
big and I'm on purpose not looking at chat by the way so if anyone say anything about it I don't see

30:51.980 --> 30:58.180
it not really I think I think that what we're even going to see is we're going to see the breakup of

30:58.180 --> 31:06.260
some of the bigger studios into like kind of how we were seeing in real life how some of the big

31:06.260 --> 31:13.260
stores are failing in response to the boutique the rise of the boutique again I think we're gonna

31:13.260 --> 31:19.100
start huh sorry I was finish your thought because and I have to read a chat comment because you are

31:19.100 --> 31:23.580
on the exact same page as someone else in chat and I'll read that here in a minute but I think

31:23.580 --> 31:28.780
that people are going to realize that with these smaller studios that they're getting even better

31:28.780 --> 31:34.220
quality because it's not just oh we got to make all this money blah blah blah they're gonna be

31:34.220 --> 31:38.940
doing it with crowdsource with a lot more crowdsource backing and when these little

31:38.940 --> 31:43.220
studios grow they're gonna employ more people they're gonna put more money into the economy

31:43.220 --> 31:49.860
we're really going to see the growth of true competition and have it not just big be you know

31:49.860 --> 31:54.820
the the first title Nintendo's economies the Capcom's you know it's there they're already

31:54.820 --> 31:59.020
losing their traction so I mean Nintendo is always going to be Nintendo they live in their

31:59.020 --> 32:06.940
own universe and they don't count but we're gonna see the indie developer the single developer start

32:06.940 --> 32:13.620
expanding a bit more but without losing the things that make us love them and they're going to be a

32:13.620 --> 32:19.460
bigger contributor to that economy okay so which chatter do I think you're extremely aligned with

32:19.460 --> 32:28.260
here in chat our very own Bobby Blackwell when I said here no here's when our own when I said

32:28.260 --> 32:34.980
that comment about the video game crash in 1983 he replied if there's a crash it'll be triple-a

32:34.980 --> 32:40.860
games too many people can make video games now that video games will still exist even if the

32:40.860 --> 32:44.900
triple-a companies crash and I'm definitely hearing the common denominator between that

32:44.900 --> 32:49.780
and what you just said yeah yeah but I mean I don't think we're gonna see the big the big ones

32:49.780 --> 32:56.380
crash I really don't but I think they're not going to be as important you're gonna see a little more

32:56.380 --> 33:02.420
of an equalization I think is a good way to put it the big lower the Indies come higher because

33:02.420 --> 33:07.660
that's been happening very slowly in this industry ever since Xbox Live Arcade launched and steam

33:07.660 --> 33:15.300
started having a lot more games on it and I I even sort of changed the one I was going to do

33:15.300 --> 33:20.460
because I thought I was gonna do that you know we finally get another Silent Hill game blah blah

33:20.460 --> 33:26.780
whatever but I was thinking about that and I was thinking we have really amazing games come out

33:26.780 --> 33:34.900
from people who were in those I guess triple-a company universes who broke off on their own and

33:34.900 --> 33:41.100
did their own really big game you know they had the backing for it it was considered a triple-a

33:41.100 --> 33:45.940
title but I'm referring more to the triple-a studios you know for example Kojima breaking

33:45.940 --> 33:53.620
off so those are just you know kind of what cemented that thought in my head so it's kind

33:53.620 --> 33:59.700
of a it's a serious one and we're gonna still see that economy growing and employing more people but

33:59.700 --> 34:05.260
I think it's not gonna be the big companies that are the driving force so before we get to Loki's

34:05.260 --> 34:09.500
third prediction I'm gonna add a chat prediction to the list because it's a little a little bit

34:09.500 --> 34:13.540
adjacent to what dark soccer is talking about but separate enough I think it's worthy of being added

34:13.540 --> 34:20.380
here and I'm gonna give it to SSJ 100 Matt and put in the jar for this year that says there won't

34:20.380 --> 34:27.380
be a video game industry union but there will be a massive dev lockout that will help trigger

34:27.380 --> 34:37.180
towards that so we're gonna finally see the damn burst what's that that is true so but it's a

34:37.180 --> 34:41.580
prediction you don't know it might maybe they will unionize by the end of the year or maybe we're

34:41.580 --> 34:46.740
just gonna have the the event that leads to that still I like that a lot as a prediction it's a

34:46.740 --> 34:50.340
little bit adjacent to what you were just talking about but not quite the same thing so yeah for

34:50.340 --> 34:54.140
sure anyway guys keep those predictions coming sorry some of them have scrolled off the screen

34:54.140 --> 34:59.340
if you had a really good one that I missed put it back so I can pick that up because we'll get a

34:59.340 --> 35:05.740
couple more in there meanwhile let's check out Loki's last prediction so my last prediction is

35:05.820 --> 35:13.340
gonna be that despite how unlikely it will be there will be a new Silent Hill announcement

35:13.340 --> 35:21.540
this week or year not this week that'd be too soon this year I know it's completely unlikely

35:21.540 --> 35:29.660
and never gonna happen but crazier things have happened so and I apologize because you cut out

35:29.660 --> 35:36.300
there for a little bit I had some problems with my earbuds so I had to listen to the TV you you

35:36.300 --> 35:41.040
are going so even though dark soccer just said I thought about doing Silent Hill you are doing

35:41.040 --> 35:48.220
Silent Hill and say yes it is happening something safe like oh you know Microsoft will incorporate

35:48.220 --> 35:55.420
Xbox Live gold in the games past that's just that's just too safe so I'm gonna do that all

35:55.420 --> 36:01.260
right let me get to some other good ones in chat let's do a cup pull a couple of these from chat

36:01.260 --> 36:07.220
these are good let's decide which ones of these we want to put in Zen monkey 11 says I have two

36:07.220 --> 36:12.860
predictions Facebook will create its own PlayStation Plus Xbox gold type of service so users can play

36:12.860 --> 36:17.780
their oculus games without having to log into Facebook if they want to play offline second

36:17.780 --> 36:23.900
rockstar will announce GTA 6 but it won't be called GTA 6 oh that's a good one I like that

36:23.900 --> 36:30.740
one act deft oh I really like this one e3 is a hundred percent done and it's never coming back

36:30.740 --> 36:41.260
I like that one that's a bold-ass prediction let's do it help me with the dead air guys

36:42.260 --> 36:49.180
that goes in the jar I like that I agree with Bobby they're not gonna ever and unbundle oculus

36:49.180 --> 36:54.580
from Facebook because you know Facebook likes to collect all the data I could see them doing

36:54.580 --> 37:00.300
something similar though too I think vibe does this with their library right now where you can

37:00.300 --> 37:05.540
get like kind of a path to some of that stuff but I could see them doing something similar with you

37:05.540 --> 37:11.060
know the oculus like if they haven't already I swear that there's something out there I've seen

37:11.340 --> 37:17.580
advertisements for paying for something you get access to a library of VR games so I don't know

37:17.580 --> 37:27.100
yeah I think that is by port so sure why not that's easy all right why by our suggests mine

37:27.100 --> 37:33.180
is that Nintendo just hold off sorry mine is that Nintendo will cave to investor pressure and keep

37:33.500 --> 37:41.540
3d all-stars on sale past March I think you're half right I don't think it's because of investor

37:41.540 --> 37:48.180
pressure but I think the gag will be that it comes back after they have already pulled it

37:48.180 --> 37:53.540
like in great Disney way I think it comes back before the end of the switches lifetime but it

37:53.540 --> 37:59.820
won't be this year I don't they're gonna do some shenanigans shenanigans will be afoot I'll leave

37:59.820 --> 38:07.780
it at that this is a pretty gutsy one from SSG 100 Matt saying Sony PlayStation Plus library will

38:07.780 --> 38:15.020
rival game pass when it drops a massive library of PlayStation 1 through PlayStation 3 games at once

38:15.020 --> 38:23.340
I feel like that's the fan talking the fan wank the Twitter demanding person talking but I that's

38:23.340 --> 38:29.660
PlayStation now though that's what they're trying to sell PlayStation now with hmm oh I like this

38:29.660 --> 38:37.060
one from business lamp hi there by the way who says um Google stadia has a surge in popularity

38:37.060 --> 38:41.460
you know we're really quick to laugh that off I think in the beginning because of you know we've

38:41.460 --> 38:48.820
had a lot of criticisms of stadia but cyberpunk change the game I think not only though that is

38:48.820 --> 38:56.220
just because the other versions so bad I don't think that's necessarily like all you need is

38:56.220 --> 39:04.260
one all you need is one to hook them in no all right all right all right I think I I think it's

39:04.260 --> 39:09.660
a good prediction all right um let's see I had some other ones here okay shad stars ik our buddy

39:09.660 --> 39:16.140
Shane playing it extremely safe with the safest prediction I've ever seen super giant will follow

39:16.140 --> 39:21.900
up Hades with another amazing game maybe like a first-person shooter mixed with a farming sim I

39:21.980 --> 39:28.260
don't know and it'll gain critical acclaim and further cement them as the best indie dev out

39:28.260 --> 39:34.820
there I think that's definitely the fanboy and Shane talking but I love the I I love the idea

39:34.820 --> 39:47.860
of SPF PS meets farming simulator right I love that um let's see what was one there was one more

39:47.940 --> 39:53.180
about Animal Crossing in here and I think it was from Sia Tabiri Sia Tabiri in chat says Animal

39:53.180 --> 39:59.940
Crossing New Horizons will by the end of the year provide a way to have a secondary place for

39:59.940 --> 40:06.620
second-tier animals you don't have room for on your island similar to the pocket camp cabin oh

40:06.620 --> 40:11.380
is that like the Pokemon go eggs you to hide them in a different place we think about that the

40:11.380 --> 40:20.060
Animal Crossing the island of the undesirable redemption island is what it is right Animal

40:20.060 --> 40:25.660
Crossing redemption island where they have to partake in challenges and only the greatest it's

40:25.660 --> 40:31.940
the only time to the death it's the only time that twist will be good all right I'm gonna you know

40:31.940 --> 40:36.420
what fuck it I'm putting it in the jar Jamie's not here at the moment she stepped away for a

40:36.420 --> 40:43.180
moment so I'm gonna sneak it in when she's not looking Animal Crossing redemption island

40:43.180 --> 40:52.660
all right perfect there we go that's enough you guys all had great predictions you know what there

40:52.660 --> 40:57.340
is nothing stopping you oh well our folks there is nothing stopping you and especially those are

40:57.340 --> 41:02.380
listening on the podcast feed you have a jar somewhere you have a piggy bank that's unused

41:02.420 --> 41:08.300
you have a piece of Tupperware somewhere put your predictions that down down right three of them put

41:08.300 --> 41:13.460
them down lock them away in a in a thing that you're not gonna look at until next year because

41:13.460 --> 41:17.020
I'm gonna ask the listeners again those that decided to actually do this and make their own

41:17.020 --> 41:23.500
time capsule I want to know what you got right when we do this again next year so we'll talk

41:23.500 --> 41:30.340
about that in chat in one year's time all right dark Tetsuya said redemption and island is that

41:30.340 --> 41:36.820
like a survivor thing yes look at least I didn't say Animal Crossing island of the idols okay I

41:36.820 --> 41:44.780
knew not to go there okay okay all right anyway all right that's some good predictions we'll see

41:44.780 --> 41:48.900
I will print that out cut them up and put them in the jar later again I have to do this virtually

41:48.900 --> 41:54.460
this year because we're not all able to do this in studio I think the biggest 2021 prediction I'd

41:54.540 --> 42:03.180
like to really hope will come true is that in 2021 we are back to recording in person that is what I

42:03.180 --> 42:09.420
would love to see happen in 2021 we're back in person we have vaccines we're able to do this

42:09.420 --> 42:17.540
shit in person and yeah all right so good I like the act F says I made a Google spreadsheet that's

42:17.540 --> 42:23.220
fine that's a good way to do it I I if you want to do your own virtual time capsule that's fine

42:23.220 --> 42:29.580
too a file you don't look at for a year all right anyhow let's get into our gaming weeks

42:29.580 --> 42:33.740
let's talk about our gaming weeks and what we've been playing so I'm usually I would start with

42:33.740 --> 42:37.580
dark soccer she stepped away for a moment so I'm gonna go ahead and start with Loki how was your

42:37.580 --> 42:46.540
day sorry I didn't play a ton of stuff this week it's been mainly Orna and it's been minecraft I

42:46.540 --> 42:56.420
finished a lighthouse in the redstone with that I finished tidying up some stuff and then because

42:56.420 --> 43:02.660
my kids kept saying they were making secret bases I made a secret base so they'll never find it you

43:02.660 --> 43:07.820
need to do a video tour to supplement for our audience here who wants to see some yeah I kept

43:07.820 --> 43:13.060
thinking about doing streaming stuff for that and it would be fun there's a lot of people that do

43:13.180 --> 43:18.260
their survivor multiplayer servers and stuff that's really a lot of fun if you have a lot

43:18.260 --> 43:25.660
of people that are streaming playing with you then you can just keep going on there but yeah

43:25.660 --> 43:30.580
I should probably do that I've been thinking about it that was a good good little bonus content thing

43:30.580 --> 43:36.700
all right I see dark soccer is back at her chair so if she doesn't mind me calling on her oh she's

43:36.700 --> 43:39.780
getting ready to eat something so maybe I will do my gaming week and then we'll come back to

43:39.780 --> 43:56.060
our soccer you want to go okay it's just okay pudding pops all right I'm laughing but I'm not

43:56.060 --> 44:08.100
meaning to I'm sorry but it's just like oh god the misfortune I'm sorry I was also my exfoliating

44:08.100 --> 44:13.980
face stuff too so my throat now has ground-up coffee that was God she's telling you you got

44:13.980 --> 44:26.460
a nasty mouth you clean up your act pudding all right how is your gaming week um it was okay I

44:26.460 --> 44:34.700
mean mostly I really didn't play a whole lot of anything in favor of watching a GDQ I played

44:34.700 --> 44:41.060
Animal Crossing of course patterned has new things out and so I've been playing patterned

44:41.060 --> 44:50.860
again because y'all know I love that game and I have other things that I'll need to ask of our

44:50.860 --> 44:56.980
listeners when we're done with this segment all right we'll come back to that I'll get into my

44:56.980 --> 45:00.900
gaming week okay I've been waiting to tell you guys about this one because I know you're gonna

45:01.020 --> 45:06.700
tease me and I totally deserve it but I do want to talk about this a little bit so do you remember

45:06.700 --> 45:13.020
about a year and a half ago I played an o RG an online reality game an org and I won you remember

45:13.020 --> 45:16.940
that and I talked about that and I called it it's funny that we got into survivor jokes earlier

45:16.940 --> 45:22.380
because I called it a survivor LARP you remember that whole thing well I haven't played anything in

45:22.380 --> 45:29.500
quite a while but for the last two weeks I actually have plant been playing another one

45:29.540 --> 45:35.580
but I was playing in secret because it was an anonymous game at meaning the people in it did

45:35.580 --> 45:41.420
not know who each other were now hold on to your butts because if you think me talking about

45:41.420 --> 45:48.060
participating in a survivor LARP is the nerdiest thing you've ever fucking heard wait wait lay

45:48.060 --> 45:57.340
these and gentle them wait because I've got more the anonymous org that I was participating in was

45:57.340 --> 46:04.820
based off of the television show Schitt's Creek where we all had to roleplay various members of

46:04.820 --> 46:11.620
the Schitt's Creek community I want you to keep in mind I've seen the show Schitt's Creek four times

46:11.620 --> 46:17.060
I think it's a hilarious fucking show I you know that the things I've watched I've enjoyed it y'all

46:17.060 --> 46:24.300
know I just play so many video games I hardly ever have time for TV so I was playing this game and it

46:24.500 --> 46:30.060
was it wasn't totally survivor it was like Big Brother and it was all like it was a bunch of

46:30.060 --> 46:34.420
psychological games like all mishmash together it was pretty intense for the two weeks things

46:34.420 --> 46:38.580
like that I'll give you an example for example it'll be like okay the eight people that are left

46:38.580 --> 46:43.740
in the game you have a gold medal a silver medal and a bronze medal you can give one of these

46:43.740 --> 46:48.820
medals to somebody else in the game the gold's worth five the silver is worth three the bronze

46:48.940 --> 46:54.740
is worth one whoever has the least amount of points at the end of this will go up for eviction

46:54.740 --> 47:00.380
like the bottom three or something like that will go up for eviction so that is that was like what

47:00.380 --> 47:04.980
it was and so it was like a little games and there was one I will tell you where my video gamer ass

47:04.980 --> 47:11.300
blew everybody away one of the games was we got to play Tetris a mobile but yet take a screenshot

47:11.300 --> 47:17.580
of a Tetris game y'all I smoked the competition in Tetris and I played it one time thank you

47:17.580 --> 47:24.580
Tetris effect my 2019 or 18 game of the year for all the practice with Tetris that when I played

47:24.580 --> 47:30.980
the played it on the phone it was not a problem for me and that was a lot of fun so pixel pocket

47:30.980 --> 47:37.860
says wait so it's Schitt's Creek RP mixed with survivor game yes this is the sixth or seventh

47:37.860 --> 47:43.980
circle of nerdom hell that I and it was so much fucking fun like I have to tell you people were

47:44.020 --> 47:50.980
really into their characters and the chat is dying to know were you Moira no I was not Moira

47:50.980 --> 47:57.820
in fact unfortunately unfortunately Moira and I were very much on strategical opposite sides a

47:57.820 --> 48:03.460
great person I'm sure but in the context of the game strategically we were just like completely

48:03.460 --> 48:09.420
opposite sides which is funny because the character I was assigned was Johnny Rose or

48:09.500 --> 48:15.820
Eugene Levy in the show so my wife and I fought the entire game basically but the like the show

48:15.820 --> 48:21.180
well yeah you pretty much sort of well the hilarious thing I had a tight alliance so the

48:21.180 --> 48:28.900
Alliance was me Jocelyn shit and Ted the veterinarian who I think dates Alexis or

48:28.900 --> 48:36.420
something in a story arc and Robin Robin is Moira's wig in one of the episodes early on

48:36.420 --> 48:43.940
so this is the Alliance that pretty much owned the game right to the end of the game and there

48:43.940 --> 48:48.140
were other alliances and things like that but you know we were for the for the final five basically

48:48.140 --> 48:54.020
so we were kind of in cahoots with Patrick another character so this is the nerdiest fucking thing

48:54.020 --> 48:57.700
you've ever heard about in your life but it was so much fun and like getting to talk to everybody

48:57.700 --> 49:02.900
afterwards like legit the people I talked to a lot it was all done on slack you're probably

49:02.940 --> 49:07.580
wondering how do you do this and this is part of the reason I agreed to do it because I knew it

49:07.580 --> 49:12.500
wouldn't be video calls until late in the morning late in the morning like it was last time I played

49:12.500 --> 49:17.780
I knew the challenges wouldn't be insane like two-hour endurance challenges like how long can

49:17.780 --> 49:23.620
you stand on one foot you know things like that I knew it would be like quick and easy type of

49:23.620 --> 49:29.180
stuff and playing on slack was how we did it was that it was only gonna be text chat and things

49:29.180 --> 49:33.180
that and it was it kind of was like a throwback to when I used to do this shit on AOL instant

49:33.180 --> 49:39.100
messenger back in the day on live journal so so yeah that's how it was so that that's my adventure

49:39.100 --> 49:45.580
into the sixth or seventh circle of nerdom hell and I loved it and yeah I thought so oh do you

49:45.580 --> 49:53.380
want to know how I did I was I was the runner-up I did not win this time I was the runner-up I got

49:53.380 --> 49:59.860
beat unanimously by the person that won but I kind of knew it was coming I know exactly what

49:59.860 --> 50:04.660
the the Jocelyn shit won the game spoiler alert because I don't think it's all posted yet sorry

50:04.660 --> 50:13.740
Francis if you're listening um but um I you didn't make me sign a contract though um but so Jocelyn

50:13.740 --> 50:19.220
won the game and she had very very strong social connections I got to know it is so weird because

50:19.340 --> 50:24.420
we were in these characters but at a certain point the roleplay kind of stops and you get to

50:24.420 --> 50:28.700
know each other like as people even though I don't actually know who it is but it was somebody I

50:28.700 --> 50:33.860
didn't know before we actually like I she told me about how she's always been the runner-up in game

50:33.860 --> 50:39.180
she's never won a game and so she won this one I'm like legit happy for she deserved it I know

50:39.180 --> 50:43.620
exactly what I well mostly what I did wrong I would have hoped I got one vote but it's all

50:43.620 --> 50:48.540
right I'm over it I I knew going into it it was probably gonna go this way and how her game was

50:48.540 --> 50:54.380
better than all that and she totally earned it and I will have you all know because it was

50:54.380 --> 50:59.340
anonymous nobody knew who was what and people could be characters that were not their own gender or

50:59.340 --> 51:07.340
whatever they wanted to do right out of the 11 players in the game 10 of them were men in real

51:07.340 --> 51:13.980
life and yes the person playing Moira was a man Robin was a man they were all men one woman in

51:13.980 --> 51:20.140
the entire game and guess what the woman was Jocelyn's shit so a woman conquered the entire

51:20.140 --> 51:27.020
game so misogyny is dead in 2021 let's hope all right but no seriously congrats if Jessica's out

51:27.020 --> 51:31.300
there listening because I told her about the show you earned it you did an amazing job and yeah

51:31.300 --> 51:35.540
legit I met some really rad people in that so that's that's why I talk about it on the show

51:35.540 --> 51:43.620
and you know if y'all can play D&D it's basically that okay but like a somehow nerdier version of

51:43.620 --> 51:51.380
it what I'm actually I got invited to join a roleplay group and I think a few of them might

51:51.380 --> 51:58.220
be listening so hello travelers but it's it's a supernatural one well you know any guess guess

51:58.220 --> 52:05.180
who's playing a guy oh you this bitch all right we're guess which guy I'm playing uh Castiel no

52:05.180 --> 52:10.420
that's the only character name but Dean Sam so close my favorite I only know some of their names

52:10.420 --> 52:17.660
all right yeah no it's it's uh it's it's great you know in and in all seriousness you know why

52:17.660 --> 52:20.620
are you talking about this on your video game podcast and all that stuff you know we just had

52:20.620 --> 52:24.620
this discussion a little bit ago about like mental health and things you have to do to get through a

52:24.620 --> 52:30.260
big reason why I signed up for the game was because this was that same week during the

52:30.260 --> 52:37.620
holidays where I had to cancel Christmas I had to cancel New Year's I wasn't doing anything so even

52:37.620 --> 52:41.780
though you know let's all point at laughing Rob let's all point and laugh at Rob for doing one

52:41.780 --> 52:49.380
of these again when he said it's gonna take a lot you know what a pandemic turns out it's a lot it

52:49.380 --> 52:56.660
was enough to get me to go do that again so that was that um I'll give the community a shout out

52:56.660 --> 53:03.300
to the the community is called TV land kind of like the network over on Facebook and if this

53:03.300 --> 53:09.460
sounds like the sixth or seventh circle of nerdom hell you'd like to live in go say hi go check it

53:09.460 --> 53:13.780
out they're planning another season I can't say much too much about it but they're they're quick

53:13.780 --> 53:19.340
games get your mind off of the bullshit in the real world for a while yeah so shout out to Francis

53:19.340 --> 53:27.260
and Stefan over there who did a great job with the TV land game I had a lot of fun um other games

53:27.260 --> 53:32.540
I've been playing this week I randomly went on Xbox and started downloading more titles I

53:32.780 --> 53:40.980
checked out the burnout paradise okay keep going to say burnout paradise city but that's not it but

53:40.980 --> 53:44.900
I played burnout paradise remastered because it's on Xbox game pass I was like I haven't played a

53:44.900 --> 53:48.500
burnout game in like five years I want to play one and so that was really fun I was trying to

53:48.500 --> 53:53.380
get some achievements in that and it looks really good and really snappy on the Xbox series X I had

53:53.380 --> 53:58.660
a lot of fun with that I've been playing a little bit of Pokemon go so they did these collection

53:58.660 --> 54:03.900
challenges this week and I was about ready to throw my phone because I could not catch one of

54:03.900 --> 54:10.100
the stupid Pokemon that I needed to catch but I finally got it yesterday so all is well unclench

54:10.100 --> 54:15.780
but I like the idea of these little mini challenges with collection medals I just wish there was a way

54:15.780 --> 54:21.220
to ensure that some of the pokey spawns were like a sure thing because that part started to get

54:21.220 --> 54:27.660
really frustrating that was okay that was what was starting to get irritating otherwise some of the

54:27.660 --> 54:35.820
other typical GPS games and oh Final Fantasy 14 as always I'm still playing that thing crafting

54:35.820 --> 54:40.380
is getting a big thing next week in the game and so I'm all ready for it so yeah that's been that's

54:40.380 --> 54:44.940
been a really good escape to to get together with friends and do things in Final Fantasy 14 because

54:44.940 --> 54:49.420
I can't do things with friends in the real world so thank you video games thank you survivor LARP's

54:49.420 --> 54:54.100
thank you all these things to help us to thank you AGDQ and all these things that help us take

54:54.100 --> 55:00.940
our mind off it that's for sure all right let's get into some other news before we do I think

55:00.940 --> 55:09.460
dark soccer you wanted to like throw out something with listeners right I did so one of our our

55:09.460 --> 55:18.220
longtime friends in the show and a really really long-term friend of mine Gwen who may still be in

55:18.220 --> 55:26.780
chat under finara I want to do a few things to help her out she's been in a really tough

55:26.780 --> 55:35.060
situation that's her story to tell but she she's had a lot of very personal loss just in the last

55:35.060 --> 55:41.620
few months and needs need some help so I do have a GoFundMe set up I'll be linking it in chat and

55:42.180 --> 55:50.300
it's pinned on my on my Twitter page at dark Sakura but I would like the listeners to pick

55:50.300 --> 55:59.900
a game that's in my my I almost said twitch it's a steam in my steam library or if I can get it

55:59.900 --> 56:04.820
figured out just some classic game that I own something you know even if it's something that

56:04.820 --> 56:10.740
you think I'll hate if it's a game that you think I'll hate and I don't own it I will accept you

56:10.740 --> 56:19.400
buying it for me if it's a low in other words is what you're saying I mean we have a bunch of

56:19.400 --> 56:24.980
halos on other systems so I mean I guess I can hook up one of the Xboxes we can fee I can ding

56:24.980 --> 56:32.580
dong ditch you my my old Xbox one with my master collection our master chief collection disk if we

56:32.580 --> 56:41.020
need to like there's ways there are ways yeah okay um but I will once I can you know get set

56:41.020 --> 56:52.500
everything set up my my goal would be to to raise money during it but who whoever contributes I'm

56:52.500 --> 56:54.940
trying to think of how to do this right because I don't want to get the channel in trouble or

56:54.940 --> 57:00.660
anything don't come don't commit on air maybe just like you know to be continued on your Twitter

57:00.660 --> 57:06.500
which you work some of these things out but yeah I'm looking for suggestions but I will take

57:06.500 --> 57:13.220
donations with the suggestions and that will add a triple vote okay based on a certain dollar amount

57:13.220 --> 57:21.860
and I'll put something like that on my on my Facebook and Twitter's more public anyway so it's

57:21.860 --> 57:28.380
easier all right well best of luck I hope I and I can't wait to support the stream or whatever it

57:28.380 --> 57:34.300
is you end up doing with that be fun I'll put it this way every every minimum every ten dollar

57:34.300 --> 57:41.100
amount so every multiple of ten will count as an extra vote toward that game awesome okay all

57:41.100 --> 57:46.140
right set a date though but not you don't have to right now but maybe like next week all right yeah

57:46.140 --> 57:54.180
it's probably gonna happen my goal actually is to get this going on sometime either next week or the

57:54.180 --> 58:00.660
week after but I want to promote it this week and let people think about it okay all right let's get

58:00.660 --> 58:06.300
into some gaming news there are some things going on this week even though you know it's it's it's a

58:06.300 --> 58:12.100
slower time of year for gaming news we saw a few things to talk about and sometimes that is things

58:12.100 --> 58:19.420
things from not just last year but many years ago right Loki yes from 2006 so apparently a core

58:19.460 --> 58:25.620
design was a studio that was behind the original Tomb Raider series they were working on a remake

58:25.620 --> 58:33.820
of the original game for its 10th anniversary on PSP and of course you know the game never came out

58:33.820 --> 58:42.820
on PSP well now they have apparently the contents of the game have been uploaded to the Internet

58:42.820 --> 58:50.420
archive as part of I guess the doing of this Tomb Raider fam site called the tomb of ash and

58:50.420 --> 58:59.460
apparently they are able you're able to take this and actually play it it looks pretty good actually

58:59.460 --> 59:05.380
considering you know it's a remake of the first game I mean I could definitely seen this being

59:05.380 --> 59:12.460
released I don't know why it wasn't released at all but apparently it says the game had been

59:12.460 --> 59:18.460
canceled instead of being published side entertainment they went with a multi-platform

59:18.460 --> 59:24.500
remake developed by Crystal Dynamics which was a two meter anniversary game so this pitch didn't

59:24.500 --> 59:32.060
end up making to a final game but the Crystal Dynamics one did so yeah too bad it looks pretty

59:32.100 --> 59:39.460
good though yeah I love when these like unearthed games kind of show up all over again and it's like

59:39.460 --> 59:42.940
kind of getting to discover this thing and that's kind of been a thing I feel like we've seen more

59:42.940 --> 59:46.620
and more of it the past couple months like Sega put out that golden axe thing not that long ago

59:46.620 --> 59:51.300
right like there's there's been little yeah these canceled projects coming back to life and I like

59:51.300 --> 59:56.780
it when it's official like obviously the Nintendo hack stuff is super dicey but when like the

59:56.780 --> 01:00:00.700
companies kind of like embrace it a little bit it's cool although I guess this one wasn't wasn't

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:05.780
really embraced right or well I think it was just that there was another project going on at the

01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:13.060
same time so it just didn't end up you know come into fruition but um still pretty cool yeah I'd

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:19.260
love to check it out do I do I even have a working PSP I guess I still have a working Vita so there

01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:24.700
is that but might be kind of hard to get going I don't know let's move on and talk about something

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:28.060
else from the past that's been making headlines this week you've probably seen this all around

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:34.140
different gaming blogs and that is a conversation between Microsoft and Nintendo in fact a lot of

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:39.140
the headlines say Microsoft tried to buy Nintendo at some point and essentially and a lot of the

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:45.380
headlines are saying and got laughed out of the room as a result which I I don't know if it's

01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:49.500
quite that simple I mean surely that was probably part of the discussion but of all it also might

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:54.900
have been a starting point to try to get to another type of agreement and maybe that is

01:00:54.900 --> 01:01:01.060
Nintendo games on the Xbox which obviously we all know Nintendo wants no part of that shit

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:10.660
Nintendo you know they kind of started to go down that road with the whole CDI I know that was a

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:16.020
little bit different the CDI was a result of the CD expansion for the Super Nintendo that never

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:20.380
happened as part of like the divorce agreement between Phillips who was helping to work on it

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:27.980
and Nintendo Phillips got the right to use like five Nintendo characters in their own games thus

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:34.820
the Wanda Gamelan and some other games that really were a stain for Nintendo so Nintendo has no

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:39.740
interest on being on other platforms like ever again like Nintendo will die as a company before

01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:45.380
that ever happens as far as licensing games so like have Microsoft make a Nintendo game or

01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:49.100
something like that and I don't even know necessarily if they're totally opposed to that

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:56.140
I mean you have you know the Mario and Sonic games and those you know are built by Sega true

01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:59.180
there's been other games you know have been developed by Namco and stuff like that so I

01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:05.580
don't think that they're completely um you know shooting all of those down but like I mean it

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:10.700
would be pretty cool if they had like a service of their own games that they could you know say

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:18.060
for example if I could get the Nintendo online channel on you know my Xbox or something like

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:24.620
that just say game pass on switch just just lean all the way in okay the only thing though is this

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:29.500
story is about a meeting that happened in January 2000 so game pass wasn't even in anybody's

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:34.060
imagination at that point yeah it was a long time ago this meeting happened so they were still

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:41.340
planning the Xbox at this time and you know and before you say god what a bunch of idiots at

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:47.300
Microsoft keep in mind in the year 2000 you're coming back the Wii hadn't happened yet so you're

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:53.060
coming out and the GameCube wasn't out yet you were coming off the Nintendo 64 and some technology

01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:59.620
that was really starting to like not be on that same level as where Sony was at so that was kind

01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:05.940
of Microsoft's leveraging was you give us or you give us the games we'll give you the technology

01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:13.940
this is a great partnership and honestly yes but you know and any fanboy who's ever said I wish

01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:18.580
they would just put Mario games on the PlayStation or on there like that's basically what Microsoft

01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:24.500
went in there asking but you know it's obviously not taking into consideration that Nintendo wants

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:29.780
no fucking part of that they don't need it they don't want it they ain't gonna have it and so

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:34.580
that what leads to the headline where they got laughed out of the room um head of business

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:39.540
development for Microsoft Bob McBreen said in an interview uh we actually had Nintendo in our

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:44.180
building in January 2000 to work through the details of a joint venture where we gave them

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:49.780
all the technical specs of the Xbox the pitch was their hardware stunk and compared to Sony

01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:55.220
PlayStation it did so the idea was listen you're much better at the game portions of it with Mario

01:03:55.220 --> 01:04:00.900
and all that stuff why don't you let us take care of the hardware and then I love this but it didn't

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:11.460
work out it didn't work out but you know yeah but on one hand honestly was Microsoft wrong

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:19.700
I don't think they were wrong but the only thing they were wrong about is that Nintendo

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:25.060
doesn't give a fuck Nintendo has their own approach to things and that and that continues

01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:31.220
on into the year 2021 so I don't know I thought that was kind of an interesting thing that was

01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:35.540
going around but especially because that headline where like Nintendo laughed Microsoft out of the

01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:42.260
room and I'm kind of like I think it goes a little deeper than that like would if I went back and

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:48.980
looked at your old tweets did you laugh Microsoft out of the room on these things where you know

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:53.700
Mario should come to PlayStation all that stuff because I don't think a lot of people did so I

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:57.140
don't think I was even thinking about that yeah now some folks in our chat room over

01:04:57.140 --> 01:05:03.380
twitch.tv slash vog network uh pod culture is saying master chief in smash and then act f points

01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:11.780
out banjo kazooie and steve are in smash so who's to say that a meeting back in 2000 didn't at least

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:16.100
and even if they all had a good laugh about it whether they were laughing with or laughing at

01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:21.620
uh who's to say that opening those lines of communication all those years ago didn't lead to

01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:27.940
something like what we see now which is a little more of you know the the a little bit of helping

01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:34.180
each other out here and there so and sj 100 matt says it was not seriously entertained was the

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:42.580
actual comment really because the one I read said but it didn't work out you don't say

01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:48.580
all right I thought that was an interesting story and I loved I loved those little pieces

01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:52.900
of gaming history where it's kind of like what could have been who knows

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:55.940
anyway dark soccer why don't you take us to our next story

01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:08.820
um the uh a multiple winner uh of the uh tetris world uh champ that I can't make even words

01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:14.580
happen uh the classic tetris world champion uh jonas newbauer has died um

01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:23.860
um it uh I don't see exactly what it was that that did it I'd have to to look uh

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:29.140
I don't think I think they've just said sudden emergency so it kind of you know

01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:39.060
but it's still I mean he went seven times so I mean that that's that's uh a very important

01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:43.460
you know person I guess in the community and to lose somebody so suddenly

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:51.380
you know just uh wishing the best for his family yeah this is some um this is some really sad

01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:55.460
news there's no real easy way to talk about especially somebody young this guy was like

01:06:55.460 --> 01:07:00.500
three years younger than I am so it's um it's it's really tragic to hear about these types of things

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:05.060
and I think a lot of you probably watch those tetris world championship videos that this

01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:10.340
yes it was that guy yeah that's uh uh was in them that um passed away and that's that's really

01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:18.740
really sad so um anyhow um tipping our hat and remembering uh this week um let's move on try to

01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:24.500
move on to uh other news uh it's it's been a heavy week and that has led to some things in

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:35.620
the gaming world too right loki um yeah so there is some interesting um things going on on twitch

01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:44.180
so apparently one of the emotes uh pogchamp was featuring the face of streamer ryan gucex

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:52.900
gutiérrez um and apparently they took it down because he was tweeting some extremely um

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:59.700
questionable things and they didn't want to necessarily associate with him so because of

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:08.180
that they had disabled the pogchamp emotes and um eventually then are replacing it now with

01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:14.500
a new uh pogchamp emote that will feature different streamer spaces making the same

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:21.060
face that they're going to swap out every 24 hours hopefully none of them have said questionable

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:28.100
things on twitter well honestly this although obviously the situation is yikes the resolution

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:30.820
kind of leads to one of those things where it's like this is kind of the way it should have always

01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:39.780
been you know like twitch is more than about one person like i'm not here to like knock people like

01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:44.020
you know ninja or whatever that have done very well i mean unless they act a fool then i will

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:48.260
knock them but you know as far as like their success you know and stuff like that hey great

01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:54.580
they've been successful but twitch is much more than one person you know or one you know community

01:08:54.580 --> 01:09:00.260
it's about the greater community of all these great twitch streamers that we have and yes

01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:05.540
diverse types of twitch streamers that we have just in and i'm not just talking about you know

01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:11.140
things like sexuality and colors of people's skin but the countries they're playing from the types

01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:14.900
of game that's all important too don't get me wrong but like the types of games that they're

01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:20.980
playing as well the the things that they're into and the the stories they have to share so i i

01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:25.700
like this resolution even though the way we got here was a bit of a oh yeah i'm kind of like

01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:32.180
it should have just been this way from day one like have a rotating face of the why not the

01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:37.300
people on the front page rotate every day so why not have some of your emotes rotate as well all

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:44.020
the time so i mean it's kind of makes sense yeah so yeah and it's interesting sha100 matt says

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:48.180
i knew the emoji didn't know it was an actual personality yeah a lot of people didn't know

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:53.380
where it came from but you know i'm i'm you know i'm glad they addressed it and ultimately you know

01:09:53.380 --> 01:10:01.460
you can qq about free speech all you want although you know big huge fat reminder free speech doesn't

01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:06.500
apply to private platforms so period that's not really has to do with criticizing the government

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:11.940
yeah so yeah you can go the free speech is what allows me to say president trump sucks

01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:16.340
because in some other countries you criticize a leader like that you get thrown in jail

01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:22.500
so i i'm thankful for folks you can yell fire in a movie theater just saying right so anyway

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:28.660
civics less than another day but i think it's also important with everything's been going on this week

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:34.020
um but i i think it's really great that we're you know highlighting again a bunch of different

01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:38.660
people and things like that so and and bob blackwolf rotating through some of the other

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:44.420
popular emotes saying these are also people yes of course they're they're uh modeled after people

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:50.580
now do you guys want a hot take that i think is is not going to be popular but i'm gonna say it

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:59.060
anyway um i think in general these emotes of people's faces are generally a bad idea now

01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:04.740
don't be wrong hold on let me finish the pogchamp stuff cool some of these iconic twitter things

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:10.260
that you know folks have cool but if somebody and nobody has but but i'm gonna say it anyway

01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:13.860
if somebody were to come up to me and say what emote icon should i make for my channel

01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:22.180
i'm gonna say please don't use pictures of your face because that's everywhere that's everywhere

01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:31.300
use something else and maybe use just my my old speaking here but um i don't know what half of

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:37.460
that stuff means anyways exactly faces and stuff i have no idea what it's representing um

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:44.340
it's cool i guess i mean they can have their own you know uh speech in twitch and whatnot but i

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:49.220
just don't get it see you see it seeing them they're very annoying yeah see it tabiri just

01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:53.300
posted a couple and you know and i know you're doing it to be tongue in cheek and on topic but

01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:58.340
i literally don't know what i'm looking at they're so small i don't know what they are the face palm

01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:03.380
i get that one but especially like when we're talking like you know even more popular chat rooms

01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:09.220
and stuff we're just scrolling by it's like i don't know what it that's just garbage it's

01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:14.420
literally just garbage being thrown in my face yeah so just something to think about now when

01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:18.900
i was watching gdq do you know what the most common there were there are two two comedy

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:24.740
emotes that i saw the lamp which is an inside joke but it makes sense it's not somebody's face

01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:31.540
i'll give you that and the clapping emoji yes that that is a good one to spam because we're

01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:36.500
not in person we don't have an audience so yes use your clapping emoji and use it a lot

01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:43.220
yeah i believe in fairies yes clap okay it's it makes sense so anyway again you guys are

01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:46.740
posting these emotes and i'm like what the hell are these i don't even know all right anyway

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:53.220
let's move on shall we let's move on to a story about monster hunter you guys have some monster

01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:57.940
hunter emotes to share because that's what's topical for this story uh a brand new demo for

01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:02.740
monster hunter rise came out just this past week if you weren't already aware i'm sure if you're

01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:07.460
a monster hunter fan you are but if you didn't know there is a demo now available for monster

01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:12.660
hunter rise and it's available on the switch e-shop it is a limited time demo you have to

01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:21.060
grab it before january 31st don't we love our limited time i i love like it's like nintendo

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:28.740
in there we're going to artificially shorting anybody with supplies i don't think this is

01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:35.140
nintendo is capcom yeah but this is how they have this is how they handle their demos whether it's

01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:40.820
like you know it's for a limited time or we're gonna allow you to play this demo only 30 times

01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:48.180
before you can't play it anymore it's an antenna thing so it is limited to uh there are 30 quests

01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:53.540
in the game and dark tatsuya and chat says there it's limited to 30 plays so it's that same kind

01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:59.140
of totally totally nintendo told you you know that part's nintendo yeah so oh but bobby says this one

01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:04.900
specifically is a capcom thing so maybe but nintendo started it capcom's continuing it i

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:13.700
don't know but um yeah so uh i but 30 is a lot i mean on those here's the thing have you ever

01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:21.780
actually used 30 plays of a demo my my kids have yes okay all right i'll let it go all right jumping

01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:28.740
flash i guess there was that time i downloaded the luminous demo from an e3 kiosk with the ds

01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:35.060
download thing and i i i refused to turn off my ds for like three weeks so i could keep playing

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:41.140
the luminous demo yeah so i used to play all the playstation magazine demos used to bring in the

01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:46.260
school we'd play like the cool borders 2 2 demo over and over and over and over and over again

01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:51.140
i eventually bought the game bobby says capcom did this even in other countries

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:59.300
um so anyway all right let's move on i i'm curious because i didn't i'm not a big

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:07.300
monster hunter person um oh bobby says other consoles not other countries so the same deal

01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:14.900
is on the playstation whatever so anyway my point is outside the the weird constrictions of it i

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:20.420
don't get into monster hunter i have tried several times there was one on the wii u i tried to get

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:24.500
into couldn't get into it i tried playing dauntless not that not that long ago i think i

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:28.020
saw vg realness or somebody streaming it and i was like i want to try this and i tried i couldn't get

01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:32.420
into it it's like i can never get into these monster hunter games and i just no offense to

01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:37.460
the fandom i know these games are huge i just can't get into it so for those that are into

01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:42.020
the fandom what did you think of monster hunter rise the demo because admittedly i haven't tried

01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:46.340
it and i'm not exactly in a hurry to although i probably will at some point so i'm kind of

01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:54.420
curious what those of you who actually played the demo feel about it so um dark tetsuya says it

01:15:54.420 --> 01:16:00.180
seems like it might be more fun than generations ultimate at least so uh see it tabiri says i'd

01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:06.100
rather be playing monster rancher all right fine um quest buster says monster hunter world is good

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:11.780
stuff but i still need to try out the rise demo uh shad starzik or shane has actually played the

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:18.020
demo thank you and says the rise demo was crazy fun and ran so well compared to what i was expecting

01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:22.900
because it is on the switch and so again and we just talked about this with the nintendo

01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:27.620
microsoft boardroom story uh nintendo is not known for pushing the boundaries on tech so

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:35.060
uh it's still coming off as impressive even with the fact that it's on the switch uh dark tetsuya

01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:38.820
says yeah that's fair it's probably harder to get into if you're not already familiar which is

01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:43.620
probably a bad idea fifth dream says monster hunter world was the only monster hunter i played

01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:50.980
and i loved it and i burnt myself out on monster hunter after like 700 hours so i'm done with it

01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:58.260
wow you say that now fifth dream but just one hit of the new one you never know so anyway thank you

01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:03.220
guys for the feedback uh i i'll check it out at some point i gotta go in and download it but i

01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:09.620
guess it was doing so well it like crashed the servers the day it went up so uh a lot of people

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:14.740
wanted to check that out all right moving on uh just a few more stories when we get to our classic

01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:16.340
game of the week but first dark sakura

01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:24.980
one of the things about agdq uh this year is that we saw and one of them i watched a uh

01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:32.100
two world records broken back to back that was pretty cool um the one i actually sat and watched

01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:36.980
was uh sonic fox oh sorry flying fox i don't know why i said sonic sonic fox that's a different

01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:46.180
flying fox um actually uh played uh which of the it was one of the sonic okay it was the sonic the

01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:52.900
hedgehog 2013 and sonic 3 angel island revisited um were the two games that were played so sonic

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:58.260
the hedgehog 2013 i believe it was the um android one that had some elements from the later sonic

01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:04.420
games and uh she beat her time actually she matched the world record during her practice i

01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:11.860
think and then well surpassed it uh during the final run and then right after that uh zaxxon 96

01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:18.820
uh broke a world record for sonic 3 angel island revisited i didn't watch that one um but i did

01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:24.180
see flying fox and just actually just funny watching her reaction was absolutely breathtaking

01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:28.100
i mean just i love watching that moment where someone accomplishes something and they don't

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:33.460
quite believe it make sense yeah oh yeah for sure um so it was really good and congratulations

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:39.380
um uh bobby blackwolf went into great detail on awesome games done quick on his show tonight

01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:43.940
um since he's able to give a little bit of an insider's perspective you know having uh

01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:49.220
been been a volunteer again this year um and uh or specifically a host i should say because i

01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:55.300
think there's a difference between those two titles um but uh bobby gave a lot of insight

01:18:55.300 --> 01:19:02.020
there and was talking about how uh the speed run he was hosting for yoshi's island ended up being

01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:09.220
like the number three best time of that game ever uh if the person running it didn't already have

01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:14.180
number two and you you only get on the scoreboard once basically so so it would have been number

01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:18.500
three and and obviously a lot of people were talking about stage five four and just some of

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:22.340
the create and i was actually watching that when i did i did see that part on wednesday and that

01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:27.460
was insanity that was just like damn that takes some skills i went trying to find the other ones

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:30.900
and i couldn't because i knew that there were a couple others that i didn't catch but

01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:38.900
i uh that i that one for me just because it was when i witnessed i was like yeah yeah girl yeah

01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:43.380
very cool what were the other two uh bobby's saying there were four in all that happened

01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:50.900
right during the event diablo 3 um okay wow diablo 3 three man even world record the four

01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:57.060
man time that's pretty impressive and then super or brothers yeah i said that one i did see because

01:19:57.140 --> 01:20:03.060
they allotted like 40 minutes to the slot and uh dude beat it in like what 15 minutes 15 minutes

01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:08.340
something like that no it was pretty quick no i take that back 18 because his time the world

01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:14.580
record was 36 and he cut it directly in half oh wow roundabout yeah and that was really fun

01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:20.980
because that one for a kaizo style game it didn't have the same feel to me as a kaizo game it was

01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:25.940
more of a technical game if that makes sense like not everything in the universe was trying to kill

01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:32.820
you you just had a set way that you had to beat the puzzle right and yeah super orbit brothers

01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:40.660
was was a really good one i i that was probably one of my favorite runs to watch next to uh

01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:47.700
rugby baby that was a great that was a great moment so hard don't don't spoil it don't spoil

01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:52.900
it because people gotta watch it for themselves no no no but i need to find a picture of like

01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:58.820
the happiest moment for that baby and have that be like my new icon for everything all right

01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:07.700
all right let's move on and let hey guys let's talk about nudity loki yes so apparently koei

01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:17.540
techmo has filed charges against um somebody that was allegedly selling unlicensed dvds filled with

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:24.500
naked dead or alive characters so this is kind of like your rule 34 stuff where they i i don't know

01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:29.380
if they're still using like the source filmmaker and stuff to make some of these things but you

01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:34.980
know the like cg animated like take video game characters and have them doing illicit stuff

01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:40.660
well kind of the same type of thing they made a uh dead or alive extreme um venus vacation

01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:48.900
and have been modding it to you know make it look like they're engaging in sexual activities

01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:53.140
and then selling dvds which is a big no-no because you don't own those characters and

01:21:53.140 --> 01:22:00.020
also who buys dvds nowadays um but apparently they have you know gone after them because

01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:06.260
obviously copyright issues um but it's the internet all those out there those boobies

01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:10.180
are copyright koei techmo those are we own those

01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:19.380
but yeah so uh i just i haven't heard of a lot of legal action against a nude mod in quite some

01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:25.460
time it's been well it's not necessarily a mod per se i mean it's sort of i mean i guess it could be

01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:31.700
but it's it's more of just like taking the characters and then like turning it into like

01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:37.140
their own thing kind of like how you see a lot of the um folks doing stuff with the overwatch

01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:43.300
characters and stuff like that like activision blizzard could come after them you know for doing

01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:49.060
that type of thing especially if they're profiting from it um i think a lot of it's you know kind of

01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:55.220
anonymous on the internet and people aren't necessarily selling dvds of it but if if they

01:22:55.220 --> 01:23:01.460
were caught they could be you know responsible for you know penalties because of copyright and

01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:08.420
infringement all right i got no good transition here so i'm just gonna get into the next story

01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:13.940
which has to do with minecraft earth or should i say had to do with minecraft earth

01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:19.620
because minecraft earth which uh again is the phone game the ar game for minecraft yeah

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:24.740
people were saying it's like pokemon go i that that is really i was like that is how you know

01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:29.780
somebody hasn't played it it was nothing like pokemon go it just happened to take place in the

01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:34.580
real world loki you've probably played a little bit more of this than anyone else here so let me

01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:42.980
finish your crew they're shutting it down june 30th 2021 because it didn't work yeah and uh one

01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:46.500
good thing though is like if you did purchase anything in the game they are giving you a free

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:55.220
copy of minecraft so if you um do end up i don't know but basically uh the problem with it was

01:23:55.220 --> 01:24:01.300
there's like no point to it like it it was like you could you go and click these tappable things

01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:08.340
to get resources which you could use to get blocks in the game to build stuff but like honestly like

01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:14.820
the build spaces that you had there's no shortage of blocks i mean it's it's pretty much almost

01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:20.020
impossible not to have the resources to do things in the game and i don't know if i didn't really

01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:24.980
play it very long so like they didn't have even really gotten to like a lot of the crafting stuff

01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:30.420
in there you can make tools and stuff but a lot of that wasn't fully implemented yet when i had

01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:36.420
stopped playing it um the ar stuff that they did was pretty cool um i mean that was definitely

01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:42.500
really awesome the problem was because a lot of the ar stuff was reliant on you going places to

01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:49.460
do all that it was hard to kind of do that in a pandemic um and that that was my next question

01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:54.260
was is is this because of the pandemic like i i heard they made some changes to try to make it

01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:57.620
a little more like pokemon go did the same thing that that is something those games have in common

01:24:57.620 --> 01:25:02.260
so that you would get like these like gem things that you would be able to redeem to like kind of

01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:08.660
spawn one of those instances near where your location was um and they were kind of cool i

01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:13.700
mean but it was just there wasn't really like an end goal like there was like different achievements

01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:20.100
they had along the way to get more xp that you're like okay you know today you have to capture five

01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:25.300
sheep or something like that and and some of it was like kind of hard to do but like it was just

01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:33.060
i don't know there was never really a point to it and also it ate my battery like it was a very

01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:38.740
unoptimized game yeah um i don't know if it that ever changed but like when i was playing it in

01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:47.460
the very uh early part of when it came out it was just so so unoptimized um i think it's gotten

01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:52.180
better i've seen like some folks you know especially they've partnered with different

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:58.340
minecraft streamers to kind of showcase the different things i know there's one i watch with

01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:06.100
some of the folks from hermitcraft um agree in and mumbo who do they did this like kind of uh

01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:12.340
road trip thing and they they really made stonehenge and stuff and uh recreated that in in

01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:18.100
minecraft earth and so it's kind of cool um but it's just i don't know it's a really great

01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:24.180
concept i think it was not executed great though and i think i think maybe the pandemic also just

01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:29.780
like didn't help the inertia in the game and yeah they didn't communicate well like what was the

01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:34.900
point you know and i think that was a big uh problem with it and and what ssj100 matt is

01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:40.260
saying in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network i honestly forgot all about it which i

01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:46.980
is i guess in a sense what was the problem me too matt and the game is on my phone and i just don't

01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:50.900
because i always check out those ar games because i'm a sucker for all of them i've played them all

01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:57.380
i've played them all um and and i forgot about minecraft earth because you're right they did

01:26:57.380 --> 01:27:00.660
they weren't very good at communicating like what's the point what's the competition what

01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:05.300
am i going for here what's you know what do i have to look forward to tomorrow where do i

01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:09.300
interact with other people like that just didn't really get realized ever in the game and i don't

01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:14.500
know if the pandemic just fucked that all up for them or what and they never like i know one of

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:18.180
the things that they had talked about is like building creations and putting them out there

01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:23.460
in the real world which you can sort of do and interact with them but they're not persistent

01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:27.780
which is kind of irritating i mean i guess that's probably a good thing because there'd be dicks

01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:33.220
everywhere but um it's just it would still be pretty cool though like get to have that stuff

01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:37.380
be persistent because then you could just go places and that would be more of like kind of

01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:41.780
like oh i'm going to go to the park and see what's there you know or something um but there

01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:47.300
wasn't really anything like that um you could bring a creation that you make and put it out

01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:55.860
into the real world but like it i don't know it was just it was tough to it had a lot of good ideas

01:27:55.860 --> 01:28:02.180
but in the end i guess it's just not really um successful but i hope that they bring a lot of

01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:07.060
i mean they've already brought some of the stuff over to the uh regular minecraft i hope that they

01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:12.820
bring a lot more of these mobs that they've created in this game to the uh vanilla minecraft

01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:20.100
as well okay all right well let's take a trip down memory lane and we're gonna go to a time when uh

01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:24.660
there was there was no ar games you couldn't you couldn't play this stuff on your phone you know

01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:30.100
why because your phone was in your car or it was in your kitchen on a cord it's the classic game

01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:35.460
of the week dark sakura is going to take a trip down memory lane and uh find a game in the vault

01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:40.740
that she thinks hey this game is worthy of your attention and by the way before we get into

01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:46.100
tonight's game a quick follow-up to last week dark sakura you would be very proud of our twitter

01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:51.140
people as they have a or excuse me our twitter people are uh wiki people as they have quickly

01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:58.580
added flag or the fucking weird arcade game of the month officially to the list for this year so

01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:05.780
i saw everything is set up wonderful thank you five people all right uh so but anyway tonight

01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:10.500
is not a flag because you did one last week so we've got a good a good old classic in fact again

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:16.500
like here we are again episode 851 you have literally picked 601 of these over the years

01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:22.100
we started the segment in episode 250 you have picked 601 games somehow have never picked this

01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:28.740
one which i'm like what well you you picked adjacent games but you didn't do this one yeah

01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:33.060
this one or the one i played dark soccer all right what is it let's get to it what is the

01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:40.260
classic game of the week i picked the nest version of strider um by the way you're you're a little

01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:43.460
quiet for the listeners you might want to get just a little bit closer to the microphone i think

01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:50.020
you'll be better fucking thing sorry my uh i'm a professional yeah you're fine you're much better

01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:54.660
now yeah well it's just because the thing tilts down and i don't have anything to hold that in

01:29:54.660 --> 01:30:00.340
place so everyone can see me fighting my mic on oh god i hate this thing no they can't see it

01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:07.620
because they're watching strider oh good well i hate my pop filter and i want it to die oh my god

01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:12.660
i hate you okay here we go and that's the sounds of what happens when i fight my tech equipment y'all

01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:20.740
how i sound now you sound very loud and very clear so strider all right strider so this particular

01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:28.900
version of strider came out in 1998 uh for the nes released by capcom only uh in north america

01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:35.940
um i well actually i think only in north america um yeah there's a famicom version uh was never

01:30:35.940 --> 01:30:46.260
released um this was developed um in tandem with the arcade version um so also the nest version

01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:53.540
uh was included in the 2006 game boy advance compilation capcom classics mini mix so i'm

01:30:53.540 --> 01:31:01.860
going to back off a little bit and say that this game is not the same strider that you think it is

01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:10.980
um it is a uh it's it's a little bit more of a a scroller game size for the platformer but you

01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:14.660
go and look around for this kind of like more like teenage mutant turtles if that makes sense

01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:19.780
you have to go find different items um get different discs that have uh information that

01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:24.820
goes with the plot you have several characters can also give you new abilities um that help you

01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:30.740
like bypass different uh areas and everything but now here is the thing about this game um

01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:42.340
this game is based off of um a manga um comic uh comptique uh which is a well it was a among the

01:31:42.340 --> 01:31:48.900
anthology that was published by uh katakawa shilton um had a strategy manga that was uh

01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:58.100
released from may to may and october issue made two october issues in 1988 and then a single issue

01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:06.020
ended up uh tankoban sorry was uh released in november of that year so it basically has the

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:12.980
same characters and the plot that was used in the nest version a few differences um where uh

01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:20.020
i don't i mean there's certain characters that die you know they die in different places um some

01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:27.620
characters live um and then there was um an uncollected uh chapter that was called

01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:37.940
that was also uh published after the main series so it has uh uh you know more things that go after

01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:45.780
the the ending of the game um but at any rate yeah this um this game um well and it was uh

01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:52.820
actually named strider hiryu um to be released in uh japan there was the it was announced while the

01:32:52.820 --> 01:33:00.100
manga was out and they had it scheduled to be released but it got delayed to 1989 and then it

01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:05.540
was cancelled so we still had the localized version that came out here in the u.s. um that

01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:15.380
came right after the the arcade game um it the artwork on it is interesting i don't it's just

01:33:15.380 --> 01:33:25.380
when they were doing the super american artwork um yeah but i mean there's people who love this

01:33:25.380 --> 01:33:34.100
game i mean i'm i'm not one of them i'll just go ahead and say um but you can also uh you know it

01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:40.420
it's it's got an interesting story to it i do enjoy the story to it um one other thing also

01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:45.940
this game is that you can use your your it has a password system so um but every time you request

01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:53.780
a password the game will end with a description of your progress so far and gives the title of the

01:33:53.780 --> 01:34:02.020
next adventure like it was uh an anime or a tv series or you know even in a manga series so

01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:10.260
it's kind of neat um but yeah it's it's not if you're expecting to go through with ha ha ha ha

01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:17.380
and sailing on fighter and fight you know oroboros um it's not the same game it's completely different

01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:21.300
game it's a very different game and you were kind of talking about like people you know maybe

01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:27.060
preferred this game i wouldn't say i necessarily preferred it but it's the only one i knew you know

01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:32.500
as a kid because i didn't have a genesis i uh for whatever reason i never noticed the other strider

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:36.340
in the years i think i think a couple years later i saw the strider in the arcade at one point i'm

01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:43.620
like this is nothing like strider you know um but my frame of reference was this particular game that

01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:47.780
we had rented a couple times i think nintendo power had some of the maps and i thought the

01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:53.220
little tunnels that you traveled through were cool so yeah i i i have fond memories of this game but

01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:59.860
it's clearly the the genesis and the arcade one are are the better games um but this one was

01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:06.660
what's that he's walking is so fucking weird in that game yeah but this game is gonna meet

01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:13.940
himself in the chin well and this was also the game that brought us that horrific uh triangle

01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:19.300
jumping i don't know if you remember that from this game but you had like wall bounce basically

01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:26.180
and it was really really hard to do and would just drive you crazy i think they did something

01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:30.740
like it in a metroid game or something later on it was really awful there too uh but even harder

01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:37.460
here um so yeah i i i do remember this game in fact i see in the in the youtube we're watching

01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:41.780
right now of somebody playing the game there in egypt and i remember this level like i do this

01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:48.580
you know and it comes from an era of capcom um there's definitely an engine that powers this

01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:54.900
game the capcom you know backbone of a lot of their uh a bit nes era games there's a lot about

01:35:54.900 --> 01:36:02.420
this game that feels like duck tales mega man bionic commando and a lot of the nes games of

01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:08.740
the era you know what i mean oh that guy just wall jumped right there the sprites uh style is

01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:12.420
very similar to bionic commando i think stylistically duck tales of course has the

01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:16.420
disney touch yes of course yeah stylistically i think bionic commando is probably the best

01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:24.580
comparison in this game yeah yeah but but and i'll be honest you know my i i i had never seen

01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:32.820
this when i was a kid um my first exposure to strider was totally dying on the first stage in

01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:39.540
an arcade um and then you know dan's sitting me down when i moved out here and says you're

01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:47.700
required to play this and i beat it i love i love that these are the requirements uh to date

01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:55.300
number one you will beat strider there were a few requirements number one was don't smoke number two

01:36:56.020 --> 01:37:03.700
beat strider reasonable number three was playing through uh castlevania symphony of the night

01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:13.300
again reasonable very reasonable all all games that i've beaten and you know except for smoking

01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:17.540
because that's disgusting and i won't do it so well and how many years have you been together

01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:27.060
as a result 23 this month there you go there you go me personally living in this state on the 23rd

01:37:27.060 --> 01:37:28.580
oh oh it's your golden year

01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:34.900
all right it's it's the it's the year of consequence uh anything else

01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:42.500
is the number of consequence anything else to say about strider um i guess play it if you have it

01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:50.420
um then you'll see why uh why it makes me cry that's no good music in it though yeah it does

01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:55.540
have some really good music i think it's it's it's worth checking the manga is really good though

01:37:55.540 --> 01:38:02.580
it's worth checking out just to see how starkly different the games are and the fact that they

01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:07.060
were of like the the same you know intellectual property essentially they're two very different

01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:16.020
games one of you know but i actually did really enjoy the manga it was oh god not the same story

01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:21.780
that was the wall jump part i and that guy just did it flawlessly i can't watch it it'll affect

01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:28.180
my internet um but i mean the manga was pretty good i look at it as just like a completely

01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:32.100
different universe from the main continuity because the main continuity is from the arcade

01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:35.700
version followed by strider 2 and then there is the remake from that series so

01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:40.900
i like how every single person that's in this or every single uh sprite or enemy drops

01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:48.660
what do you mean just drops it just drops like they spawn in they drop

01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:54.660
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah there's a lot of graphical bugs in this game but on on an old tv keep in mind

01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:59.300
a lot of the bugs you see on the perimeter or the outside edges keep in mind an old crt tv is going

01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:04.900
to hide that so it didn't it looks bad now it looks worse than it did back then when you were

01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:08.980
playing it on an old tv because you can't see some of those graphical bugs that are on the edges

01:39:09.540 --> 01:39:15.460
that's interesting all right wait that was it there it is your classic game of the week strider

01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:21.700
the nes version specifically all right thank you dark soccer for that pick let's get into

01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:26.260
some rapid fire news and travel around the gaming world and see what else is happening this week

01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:35.780
loki it's all mods so uh first we have this ridiculous snowboard mod for witcher 3 which

01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:42.900
is hilarious it allows you to add a snowboard to uh jarl's inventory and looks like it works almost

01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:52.580
like the shield in um breath of the wild i need to play this now um so yeah it's pretty awesome

01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:57.140
if you want to check it out nexus mods of course and then of course there's a first person mod

01:39:57.860 --> 01:40:04.420
for moral combat 11 so that's kind of uh uh interesting that's like a straight out of the

01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:10.820
street fighter playbook there yeah then fps oh yeah that's switch version yeah yeah yeah so

01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:18.180
um actually i think the 3ds one had that too but yeah so that's also something you can uh

01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:24.820
check out as well um pretty cool well i don't know how many of you had the super nintendo port

01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:30.740
of street fighter alpha 2 because most people stuck to the saturn or the playstation if they

01:40:30.740 --> 01:40:36.180
were going to play this game but there was a super nintendo cartridge version of it uh and get this

01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:44.260
after 25 years a cheat code has been discovered for this game uh it it was reversed engineered

01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:51.780
and has been discovered that on the tie if you put k a j in the high score table go to the title

01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:57.860
screen and hold down lxy and start on the second controller that's a lot you will be able to play

01:40:57.860 --> 01:41:05.380
the game as shin akuma so that is that is something that's been hiding in that game all this time

01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:11.620
what'd you say this game you own this game i own this game you should check it out maybe so

01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:16.260
although i always joke about this game as being like one of the first cartridge games ever played

01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:21.940
that had load time yeah right yeah um yeah i i figured you would have skipped the super

01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:26.500
nintendo i know you're a street fighter you know type of gal obviously sakura came from somewhere

01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:32.020
i didn't have anything else i had a mess that was the best thing i had before i got here okay

01:41:32.020 --> 01:41:37.780
okay i just borrowed my friend's playstation forever but i i didn't move out here with

01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:42.660
anything new except i owned a copy of final fantasy 7 and that was like it yeah why why

01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:48.580
oh and dragon ball gt yyr in chat says holy crap it's no wonder nobody ever found it naturally and

01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:52.020
it kind of makes me wonder why was it there in the first place and usually with these cheat

01:41:52.020 --> 01:41:55.620
codes the way it worked back in the day is that if they weren't found or they weren't you know

01:41:55.620 --> 01:42:03.380
whatever within about a year the cheat codes get leaked by the developer to to draw interest in the

01:42:03.380 --> 01:42:08.260
game again and get the coverage in the magazines and all that stuff so it's weird that it took 25

01:42:08.260 --> 01:42:12.340
years in reverse engineering to figure this one out especially when we're talking about another

01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:19.620
character in the game that's a big fucking deal anyway act f says the super nintendo port of

01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:24.260
street fighter alpha 2 is a technical prowess yeah for sure i've played that on super nintendo and

01:42:24.580 --> 01:42:29.940
it's a miracle that it runs that's for sure but maybe that's also it is that you know that was

01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:37.220
really one of the last games on super nintendo uh 96 when that came out right super nintendo

01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:43.460
was really on its way out the door at that point so um yeah all right anyway um also on its way

01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:50.660
out the door netflix not totally just the version that's on the wii u and the 3ds eshop uh the

01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:56.980
service for netflix will discontinue in june the apps actually were already removed you cannot

01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:14.260

01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:21.620
disk then it's not going to work anymore that's the problem they want to do like a a firmware to

01:43:21.620 --> 01:43:27.060
netflix there's some older tvs that won't run it anymore and stuff too so and to be able to do

01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:31.460
things like uh bandersnatch and some of the other things that they're doing with netflix they have

01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:35.860
to kind of get people off the old platforms so sorry to those that were uh holding out

01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:40.100

01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:36.340
motorcross video game on playstation nice that'd be it all right let's get back into some other

01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:46.660
news loki so apparently uh the roblox corporation the creators of roblox have valued themselves

01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:54.500
at almost 30 billion dollars after a recent round of investments um of course they still haven't

01:47:54.500 --> 01:48:01.380
um listed themselves directly yet on the actual stock market but um so far investing seems to be

01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:07.540
going pretty well i know my kids play constantly so i wouldn't be surprised i hear about that game

01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:12.340
a lot so and i i've never really gotten into it myself but because i think it's i'm not the right

01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:17.700
audience for it but uh it's definitely not what i'm into yeah but i mean cool hey you know it

01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:25.620
seems like kids learn a lot from it so all right yeah um something else you can learn a lot with

01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:32.740
how to use a twitter avatar to play video games so this is very similar to maybe like uh twitch

01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:39.700
plays pokemon but instead it's being done with somebody's twitter avatar via twitter now they

01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:44.660
didn't suddenly figure out how to get like a fully animated twitter avatar that plays out in

01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:51.700
real time but what's happening is that it's a bot that essentially updates a screenshot in an avatar

01:48:51.700 --> 01:49:01.140
of pokemon red every 15 seconds so what you do you reply to a tweet and every 15 seconds it scans

01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:06.580
the replies to that tweet and the button press that got the most tweets is the button that is

01:49:06.580 --> 01:49:12.420
pressed and the avatar is updated and there it goes it's like the old ass webcam from olr's

01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:19.940
second or third year it updates every 15 seconds but that's what it is and it it's a clever way to

01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:25.940
do uh another type of twitch plays pokemon experiment which was the whole it goes back

01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:35.620
to the whole um what is the analogy can a can a an animal type a novel if you leave a typewriter

01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:40.500
in front of it or something like that like eventually it will type a novel uh eventually

01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:46.660
twitter will beat pokemon red because eventually twitch did too with the help of supers superheroes

01:49:46.660 --> 01:49:52.900
ah and what were the big pokemon names but like they all had ridiculous names because none of

01:49:52.900 --> 01:50:00.500
it made sense so yeah oh there was the helix thing oh yeah that was a big thing yeah uh

01:50:01.140 --> 01:50:06.500
jesus s 200 matt says i remember that webcam it was pointed at the guest couch right

01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:12.340
yeah it was um so loki had actually built an old arcade cabinet and so the camera was on top of

01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:18.660
the cabinet and pointed towards the couch that's how it is yeah dartitsu says something like a

01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:23.060
thousand monkeys will eventually type shakespeare it's some it's something along those lines i

01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:29.140
forget anyway um whatever happened to that cabinet look i think it was fucking gigantic

01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:36.260
oh i just mantled it when i moved to the second apartment complex because it was upstairs and no

01:50:37.620 --> 01:50:45.860
no no not moving that upstairs it was too big i never built it uh anyway i think uh what is what

01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:50.660
is the linked i think it's a screen shakes is the twitter account if you want to check this out i'm

01:50:50.660 --> 01:50:54.820
trying to trying to load that up now and verify and actually maybe get a peek at where they're

01:50:54.820 --> 01:51:01.780
at in the game right now um but that is that is the account i believe yeah screen shakes is the

01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:08.660
one and um i can't tell where they're at based on the avatar my knowledge of pokemon is not

01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:14.660
that good i'd ask shane to help but he didn't like gen 1 although he still probably knows looks like

01:51:14.660 --> 01:51:19.540
they're in some sort of town it's loading very slowly for me but yeah screen shake is the account

01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:27.220
you can do uh to get in on that if you want to play some pokemon on twitter moving on i believed

01:51:27.220 --> 01:51:33.780
our soccer is next well i might be look my mic's not moving i figured out what the problem was

01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:40.740
um anyway uh epics games uh they have just recently announced the acquisition of a video

01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:51.140
game software development company rad game tools um they're uh they basically were saying that um

01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:59.540
that they are looking for them to assist with more photorealistic uh games and that they uh

01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:04.340
that they're going to be partnering with epics rendering animation insights and audio teams

01:52:04.420 --> 01:52:12.020
to bring that technology um into uh unreal engine and beyond that so they really uh

01:52:12.020 --> 01:52:19.140
like what they do and say they're gonna play nice with them by buying them sounds pretty rad

01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:26.980
all right uh but that's not the only thing we have to say about epic games right logan

01:52:27.940 --> 01:52:34.660
uh right because as is the trend with a lot of this uh coronavirus and everything is that a lot

01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:41.700
of malls aren't doing great especially since nobody can shop in them and in general i know

01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:49.060
we have a local mall over here that's about ready to be shut down and bulldozed but um my childhood

01:52:50.020 --> 01:52:59.780
apparently the uh terry town or the carrytown center which is a 980 000 square foot um site

01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:07.460
and apparently it is this mall that epic is looking to purchase and they're going to

01:53:08.180 --> 01:53:16.900
make that their brand new campus for um epic games and so they're going to open it in uh 2024

01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:23.220
uh after they refurbish and rebuild the area so i don't know if they're going to tear down a lot

01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:28.660
of that stuff but they're at least going to use the area to build their brand new campus but i

01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:34.500
could see them like kind of just reusing them all well i hope they keep anti-ans like you know

01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:40.100
there's certain there's certain things in the mall that really should stay that maybe the employees

01:53:40.100 --> 01:53:47.940
will want to enjoy just based on you know looking at everything it the mall is pretty damn it yeah

01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:52.980
it looks like sunrise mall that's what she's saying it looks like our mall yeah or pretty much

01:53:52.980 --> 01:53:58.020
i can't help but think about that uh billy eilish is that her name that video or i always say

01:53:58.020 --> 01:54:04.260
william eyelash like um in the sketch that was outside my life um but uh her video have you seen

01:54:04.260 --> 01:54:07.780
that video where she's in the mall and she's just dancing around to see because the mall is

01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:12.580
completely empty and then but for some reason all the food stuff seems to be open so she just

01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:19.060
she just walks into anti-ans grabs a pretzel goes to potle gets a bag of chips and i love it because

01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:23.780
it's just this whole like i'm just gonna eat all this stuff energy and i don't know what she's

01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:30.740
trying to say with the video but i love it yeah i i do like the pretzel places like if if somebody

01:54:30.740 --> 01:54:36.900
would work just all that stuff outside of like you know in the mall because man like there's

01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:43.700
some of those like the uh it wasn't anti-ans they used to go to it was um cinnabon pretzel

01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:50.980
no it's pretzel time okay oh the other one okay and um like those things are so soaked in butter

01:54:52.020 --> 01:54:57.300
they're amazing like i would just like so our local grocery store chain over here really

01:54:57.300 --> 01:55:01.220
actually started selling giant pretzels out of their bakery so that's pretty good but they're

01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:06.820
not as they're not butter so like that stuff i mean like like going to wintels when i go to yeah

01:55:07.060 --> 01:55:14.100
disneyland yeah so like now wintels um is it wintels pretzels pretzels pretzels pretzels yes

01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:21.220
um yeah i need i need someone to sell them like that not the good pretzels like you know the

01:55:21.220 --> 01:55:27.460
actual pretzels that you make the german pretzels but like i want the buttery ones that's what

01:55:27.460 --> 01:55:32.660
because like was it um the dairy queen bought up orange julius i'm just about to make an orange

01:55:33.220 --> 01:55:40.020
for a while and they were gonna have uh orange julius and and now they've discontinued the

01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:43.620
machines there too i'm like where the hell am i gonna get my orange julius now it's not in the

01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:49.140
mall it's not dairy queen i mean yeah i can make it to a home like i know how to make those but

01:55:49.140 --> 01:55:55.220
like the authentic ones so like i can't get that anymore because they shut them all down

01:55:55.220 --> 01:55:59.460
um as jonah matt mentions the piercing pagoda will be across from hr

01:55:59.700 --> 01:56:10.180
things though with people buying the uh um store like buying the malls and turning them into uh

01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:16.980
housing like transitional housing for the homeless i've heard of that too huh yeah i like that better

01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:20.500
i just love the imagery of epic moving into a mall it's just kind of like you know oh you need

01:56:20.500 --> 01:56:28.900
to get to finance okay just go through claire's um make a ride at sabaro all right teach your mom

01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:34.020
s says will suncoast and sam goody be open as well look whatever epic wants to do sam goody

01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:39.140
goody neither of those exist anymore they don't time they don't oh fucking a all right

01:56:40.580 --> 01:56:45.380
true story i think i bought my last 45 i ever bought it a sam goody

01:56:46.260 --> 01:56:50.820
the hot dog on the stick stand will be run by the ios app developers

01:56:53.460 --> 01:56:57.780
all right enough enough mall jokes next there's a suncoast

01:56:59.540 --> 01:57:04.900
there's still a suncoast i'm like the fuck where the what the one side well there's still a

01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:10.420
blockbuster that's still on my to-do list if the pandemic doesn't finish it off i'd love to go but

01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:16.580
i think the last blockbuster up in oregon that's now their whole like mo they have made it their

01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:19.860
thing it's like we're a tourist destination now because we're the last blockbuster

01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:25.700
the last blockbuster in the village that's right i am the only blockbuster

01:57:29.460 --> 01:57:35.380
i just remember that suncoast was the only place that i could go in and buy subbed anime yes back

01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:42.740
in the day yes because i did not i i don't know there's a lot of people have a fun place for that

01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:52.020
you know mid 90s late 90s uh uh um voice acting uh you know dubbed voice acting but keep in mind

01:57:52.020 --> 01:57:56.660
that a lot of the stuff that i started watching was like taped off of tv in japan or you know

01:57:56.740 --> 01:58:02.980
off of tv in japan or you know sixth generation old fan subs so i wanted to continue with some

01:58:02.980 --> 01:58:07.780
of the series that were now being commercially released with the same voices and it was the only

01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:15.300
place that i could go get my ranma vhs tapes fansubbed not fansubbed just subtitled so and

01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:21.300
they always cost more um i never got why they cost more dart tsuyin chat says i've seen people

01:58:21.300 --> 01:58:26.340
do youtube vids making the trek to the last blockbuster video you know when i was doing

01:58:26.340 --> 01:58:29.780
that road trip where i went to go visit shane back in like september october something like

01:58:29.780 --> 01:58:34.740
that i really considered taking a detour through oregon so i could go there but it would have added

01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:39.620
like six hours to my trip i needed another day so i could do it like it just wasn't gonna happen

01:58:39.620 --> 01:58:45.220
that time but uh yeah one of these days uh when covet's over uh dark sakura we'll go on a road

01:58:45.220 --> 01:58:52.420
trip all right sounds funny we'll go up there and we'll get some act popcorn with butter what was

01:58:52.420 --> 01:58:59.540
the brand they sold in those stores all right anyway act one no they no act you can still get

01:58:59.540 --> 01:59:06.260
act popcorn in the grocery store rob yeah okay well that normal what can what can i get that's

01:59:06.260 --> 01:59:14.020
like specifically is the word oregonian uh anything with no sales tax someone else to

01:59:14.020 --> 01:59:19.940
pump your gas well that's not what i'm talking about because we we were doing that like once

01:59:19.940 --> 01:59:26.340
a year anyway when we went to to prosser washington to see danza and voodoo donuts

01:59:26.340 --> 01:59:34.900
okay voodoo donuts i'll give it that so they are pretty good well and hey vanara can um can vouch

01:59:34.900 --> 01:59:41.060
for me in our chat can vouch for me gwen can vouch for the the how i would save up paychecks to go by

01:59:41.780 --> 01:59:49.700
my subtitled anime i love it and the raw version of uh that was like three generations old

01:59:49.940 --> 01:59:57.780
of legend of the overfiend that we would uh make up our own uh dialogue to all right last story

01:59:57.780 --> 02:00:04.260
tonight maybe suncoast would be exhibiting here at least attending if they were uh if they have

02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:09.860
more than one store left but there is consumer electronics show this week that's right it is

02:00:09.860 --> 02:00:15.940
happening january 11th through 14th but of course not happening in vegas across several convention

02:00:16.100 --> 02:00:22.900
nope ces 2021 it's virtual just like uh everything else has been for the past year or so uh somebody

02:00:22.900 --> 02:00:26.500
had just joined chat a minute ago going when was the last time you were all in the same room

02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:30.660
march much like a lot of you march was the last time we were all in the same room so

02:00:30.660 --> 02:00:36.020
uh and you know there hasn't really been big conventions since then yes i there's been some

02:00:36.020 --> 02:00:44.340
ones but i was sick so i think february you're right well i had that cruise i had pneumonia

02:00:44.340 --> 02:00:49.540
i was on the cruise i think we did one more episode here in studio after the cruise but it

02:00:49.540 --> 02:00:54.980
was just right it was just loki and i you were sick i soon remember that yeah that was the start

02:00:54.980 --> 02:01:01.540
and i had pneumonia for like six months yeah yeah all right and then i had pneumonia again go fig

02:01:02.180 --> 02:01:07.460
all right anyway um so ces is going to be virtual this year uh there'll be you know like live

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:12.260
virtual showrooms live stream events and things like that uh and you know what honestly this year

02:01:12.260 --> 02:01:15.940
you have a lot of companies that are just releasing stuff kind of early but you're not

02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:21.620
going to be able to go to a room to see televisions anymore uh the laptop pcs and accessories connected

02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:27.300
homes drones robots transportation virtual cars that's all expected to go online and they're

02:01:27.300 --> 02:01:35.140
saying it's going to be a slower quieter show fuck off covet 19 um but that is that is what it is all

02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:39.380
about but we might still get some news out of it um somebody had brought up in chat earlier it's

02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:44.660
a good time for arcade one up to make some announcements usually um again a lot of those

02:01:44.660 --> 02:01:48.500
like furniture in your house that do tech things this is a good time for that so we might get some

02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:53.700
updates and sort of some sort of those types of collectibles but i wouldn't expect i mean very

02:01:53.700 --> 02:02:01.060
rarely do we get big gaming news at ces even if e3 was a spin-off of ces back in the day i would say

02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:05.540
the last big thing i remember ces was when microsoft game room was announced rest in peace

02:02:05.540 --> 02:02:09.380
they did announce that at ces but i i don't i don't think anything like that's going to happen

02:02:09.380 --> 02:02:17.220
not this year so all right um anyhow that brings us closer to the end of the show but before we

02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:21.540
wrap up we like to check in with the listeners in the segment we call the listener round table so

02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:26.340
um and i'm sorry the headline is wrong it's just a chat mailbag um because this is the part of the

02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:30.980
show where we like to visit our mailbag as well every week we invite you guys to participate

02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:35.860
participate at orange laundry.com is the place to send us emails and dark sakura will pick

02:02:35.860 --> 02:02:40.500
um some to read on air if she has any one all right so let's let's get to our email tonight

02:02:41.380 --> 02:02:46.820
all right um hello peoples during our time of social distancing i've gotten into cocktail

02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:52.100
mixing the mixology app has been a great aid in this there is nothing that compares to the mixology

02:02:52.100 --> 02:02:57.620
app on ios as far as cocktail mixing apps go there's nothing like it on android at all mixology

02:02:57.620 --> 02:03:03.460
did not pay me to send this email this brings to mind a topic for the round table there are many

02:03:03.460 --> 02:03:08.180
examples of games that are exclusive to one platform for which there are no comparison in

02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:17.940
their genre which examples spring to your mind um i wish the emailer flash i wish the emailer given

02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:24.740
us an example read that question one more time a genre that only exists on one no no no so there

02:03:24.740 --> 02:03:32.580
are there's no comparison in their genre okay okay so i guess there's nothing really like

02:03:32.580 --> 02:03:37.780
jumping flash on another system and it's just the first thing that sprang to mind um

02:03:40.100 --> 02:03:45.140
um go back to the roots well i was gonna say the roots of the show the bimani stuff was always like

02:03:45.140 --> 02:03:48.820
on playstation you didn't really see it anywhere else but then i guess rock band and guitar hero

02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:53.380
kind of broke that mold and did um kind of put it everywhere because then my brain kind of goes to

02:03:53.380 --> 02:03:58.660
those you know parappa the rapa but then again sega did have some pretty badass music games of

02:03:58.660 --> 02:04:05.060
their own back in the day they were just very different um well you know what honestly fuck

02:04:05.060 --> 02:04:10.900
go back to the dreamcast and look at a lot of those games we don't have anything like where's

02:04:10.900 --> 02:04:18.340
where's samba de amigo where's uh space channel five where's crazy taxi i would say yeah you know

02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:23.060
what those are my answers a lot of those like obscure sega dreamcast games that we love i don't

02:04:23.140 --> 02:04:27.620
think we've seen anything unless the thing to keep in mind until they get ported to other stuff later

02:04:27.620 --> 02:04:33.540
sorry is it a lot of those more obscure dreamcast games had a lot of their start in the arcade

02:04:34.980 --> 02:04:42.740
yeah so and they could port their own games and but at the time sega was doing interesting things

02:04:42.740 --> 02:04:47.540
in the arcades with um you know i i wish we had gotten like something for jumbo safari or

02:04:47.620 --> 02:04:53.700
something for example that's another good one yeah but we were getting um you know the dreamcast

02:04:53.700 --> 02:05:01.380
was essentially you know scaled down naomi uh hardware it would play the naomi games so i mean

02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:06.100
the biggest thing that i was always pissed off that we never got was planet harrier on dreamcast

02:05:06.980 --> 02:05:14.340
someone if someone like could convert that i would pay for it um but yeah i think that just more goes

02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:18.580
in line with what sega was doing at that time but it's a good example i mean because we weren't

02:05:18.580 --> 02:05:23.540
getting some of those same types of games on other systems um shane is pointing out in chat space

02:05:23.540 --> 02:05:28.180
channel five had a vr release sequel thing not that long ago that's true you know i guess i guess

02:05:28.180 --> 02:05:33.300
we have revisited those things a few times to move oh that's a good answer too that's a good one the

02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:38.260
best to move series um my brain also went to how about that we haven't seen this in quite a long

02:05:38.260 --> 02:05:42.900
time something like okay but i know i know what somebody somebody in chat is going to respond to

02:05:42.900 --> 02:05:49.780
this instantly i will get there please point blank for uh you know that whole series and the

02:05:49.780 --> 02:05:57.300
light gun genre in general we haven't seen that in a very long time now i've heard sharp shooter

02:05:57.300 --> 02:06:03.060
but you know he i was here's where yyr brings up sharpshooter yes yes thank you for pointing out

02:06:03.060 --> 02:06:09.860
also why yr that uh planet harrier karu and not naomi yeah so but i'm just saying something

02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:15.700
something really back in that kind of like namco you know a shooter type of thing we haven't that

02:06:15.700 --> 02:06:19.780
was kind of unique to that and we haven't seen anything like that in a long time i guess so no

02:06:19.780 --> 02:06:27.300
namco is doing like the giant arcade ticket spitter thing so which is weird that's a tough question i

02:06:27.300 --> 02:06:30.420
would have need i would need more time to think about that did the email or give us any of their

02:06:30.420 --> 02:06:36.900
own examples no well i you need to email back who is it i'll get to it when i finish the email

02:06:36.900 --> 02:06:42.500
all right go on please proceed also i'm intrigued about the possibility of the kentucky fried

02:06:42.500 --> 02:06:47.140
console as i am always looking for something to do while using my air fryer besides impatiently

02:06:47.140 --> 02:06:52.340

all right redertainment you email us back i i need i need your examples to this question that's

02:06:58.180 --> 02:07:05.220
a tough question but you know what you know what a feature of the kfc console maybe a console warmer

02:07:05.220 --> 02:07:09.540
is what we need on other uh consoles maybe it's maybe it's not the games it's the features

02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:16.260
why would you want your consoles to be warmer did did you not just talk about how you wanted

02:07:16.260 --> 02:07:21.460
the kfc console last week on the show to warm your chicken my chicken but i don't want something to

02:07:21.460 --> 02:07:26.820
warm the console all right okay all right yes a warmer in the car if you know what i mean all

02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:33.860

rob you really do all right uh hey your life will be improved hey live folks uh do you have any

02:08:21.300 --> 02:08:25.380
questions for us in chat for the round table before we uh move on and wrap up the show shane

02:08:25.380 --> 02:08:30.100
is saying i would kill for a new bus to move game same in fact he was the one that brought over the

02:08:30.260 --> 02:08:35.300
spiritual successor whose name i can't remember in the moment dance summit that's it dance summit

02:08:35.300 --> 02:08:41.860
of which i finally own a copy oh right yeah i remember that yeah yeah uh twitch.tv slash

02:08:41.860 --> 02:08:50.100
vog network bobby blackwolf asks rugby baby or baby rugby uh and again different things i don't

02:08:50.100 --> 02:08:55.940
know what rugby baby is you need to find out no spoilers go look up the sequence from uh

02:08:56.740 --> 02:09:01.940
awesome games done quick it's on youtube and rugby baby just because that's how i heard it

02:09:01.940 --> 02:09:08.020
the first time and the thing is that i think that with and i don't want to spoil it but i think that

02:09:08.020 --> 02:09:13.540
bobby's question rugby baby or baby rugby would actually be two completely different things that

02:09:13.540 --> 02:09:17.380
you wouldn't say this you use the term interchangeably for the same thing i think

02:09:17.380 --> 02:09:21.940
it would actually be two completely different concepts they would but again i don't want to

02:09:21.940 --> 02:09:26.500
i don't want to spoil every your homework assignment is to go watch because i'm not

02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:31.300
going to protect you from spoilers next week audience all right okay so your homework

02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:36.340
assignment is to go watch rugby baby because i will not protect you from spoilers next week

02:09:36.340 --> 02:09:40.420
but but get this like the whole time that everyone was talking about that

02:09:41.300 --> 02:09:49.060
the baby monkey song was going into my head but i was singing rugby baby rugby baby you know so

02:09:49.060 --> 02:09:54.900
yeah all right uh let's see um there was one that scrolled off the screen real quick before

02:09:54.900 --> 02:10:00.420
act if said something um oh sacred jade said scott pilgrim game physical release yeah we got

02:10:00.420 --> 02:10:04.900
that in the rapid fire news but uh anybody planning on picking it up i don't think i'll

02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:08.980
get the physical release but i will download the game for sure that was a good yeah and the

02:10:08.980 --> 02:10:14.340
soundtrack is so fucking good um yeah i will definitely check out the game again for sure it

02:10:14.420 --> 02:10:22.100
was a good game so all right um let's see one other ah yes act deft was asking in chat uh

02:10:22.100 --> 02:10:28.260
what's a game you're looking forward to seeing released this year um good question i think a lot

02:10:28.260 --> 02:10:35.300
of times we don't know about them yeah we don't know about them right now um yeah i i feel like

02:10:35.300 --> 02:10:42.580
breath of the wild 2 this is the year for it and so that is the one i'm gonna say it's so hard we

02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:46.740
just don't know what's coming out yet if starfield ends up being this year i'm very curious about

02:10:46.740 --> 02:10:52.420
that i like space games i like the idea of a bethesda game in space i don't like the idea of

02:10:52.420 --> 02:10:56.900
a buggy game in space so i hope they take the time to get it right so maybe it won't be this year

02:10:56.900 --> 02:11:01.460
but um those are some titles off top my head that i'm looking forward to i'm trying to think i think

02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:06.580
there's something in springtime i was looking forward to as well i can't remember them off top

02:11:06.580 --> 02:11:15.460
my head so all right i can't really think of anything but breath of the wild 2 so yeah and my

02:11:15.460 --> 02:11:21.860
possum game that someone's going to make pixel poops number two and and yeah pixel poops yyr

02:11:21.860 --> 02:11:28.260
steam release and commodore release as well and so so when when they finally make this possum

02:11:28.260 --> 02:11:34.260
game that you you're looking for and they decide to speed run it is it going to be possum games

02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:41.780
done quick yeah yes there should be a special segment on eight on the next agdq called possum

02:11:41.780 --> 02:11:51.060
games done quick uh s sj100 matt wants to know now that agdq is over uh among us vog edition when uh

02:11:51.060 --> 02:11:57.860
soon trademark uh i am working on another vog project right now i uh i don't want to say much

02:11:57.860 --> 02:12:04.820
more than that but it's coming soon trademark but yes that is on my my mind i wanted to do

02:12:04.820 --> 02:12:09.460
more streaming this week and i think i actually did one that was the same time as awesome games

02:12:09.460 --> 02:12:13.220
done quick but for obvious reasons i didn't want to do a lot and i certainly didn't want to do one

02:12:13.220 --> 02:12:19.300
when bobby was going um so i i'm trying to get back in that habit but we did a really fun stream

02:12:19.300 --> 02:12:25.780
uh of final fantasy 14 it was uh shad starzik and our buddy ray we were map hunting together and i

02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:29.380
think we had a lot of fun with that because they built this whole thing in fantasy 14 where you

02:12:29.380 --> 02:12:34.260
have like a big roulette wheel that spins in some map rooms and it's it's like a game show it's

02:12:34.260 --> 02:12:39.700
really funny um so i'll try to do some more of that but um i also want to do like some dj max

02:12:39.700 --> 02:12:44.260
streams and play some other games that aren't just final fantasy 14 although that one is uh

02:12:44.260 --> 02:12:48.740
certainly a fun one to play all right well i think with that we're going to move to start to wrap up

02:12:48.740 --> 02:12:53.060
