00:00.000 --> 00:14.260
As the years continue on, technology is only getting better, smaller, faster, and cheaper.

00:14.260 --> 00:17.300
And that enables makers without access to high-end fabrication and materials to make

00:17.300 --> 00:18.920
more and more impressive designs.

00:18.920 --> 00:23.780
Like, for example, a Nintendo 64 that is smaller than the original controller, screen included,

00:23.780 --> 00:25.140
no permanent cables needed.

00:25.140 --> 00:28.340
Praise be to those who have this kind of talent and commitment to pull off such an incredible

00:28.340 --> 00:29.340
feat.

00:29.340 --> 00:31.580
That's the story in the first episode of 2021.

00:31.580 --> 00:34.820
Join your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki for this and the rest of the New

00:34.820 --> 00:38.500
Year's news, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.500 --> 00:43.780
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

00:43.780 --> 00:47.580
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:47.580 --> 00:52.500
It is Orange Lounge Radio, the very first show of 2021.

00:52.500 --> 01:01.980
My name is Rob Roberts, here with you on January the 3rd of 2021 with my co-hosts.

01:01.980 --> 01:06.860
I am just noticing I did the classic mistake at the beginning of the year, and it still

01:06.860 --> 01:13.720
says 2020 up in the text here on Twitch, because we do tape live every Sunday night at twitch.tv

01:13.720 --> 01:18.640
slash VOG Network, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby

01:18.640 --> 01:20.000
Black Wolf show.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.920
And let's get that officially changed.

01:21.920 --> 01:24.040
Yes, we are in 2021.

01:24.040 --> 01:28.920
Anyway, episode 850 for this January the 3rd of 2021.

01:28.920 --> 01:37.320
Again, I am Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:37.320 --> 01:38.320
I'm

01:38.320 --> 01:39.320
Hello.

01:39.320 --> 01:40.320
Hi.

01:40.320 --> 01:41.320
Hi.

01:41.320 --> 01:42.320
How are you, Jamie?

01:42.320 --> 01:43.320
I'm all right.

01:43.320 --> 01:47.760
I've been fighting my new camera today and fighting my mic and fighting my headphones

01:47.760 --> 01:51.080
and, you know, all kinds of garbage.

01:51.080 --> 01:53.080
So yeah, but, but we're good.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.080
Yeah.

01:54.080 --> 01:56.520
You guys should have seen the scramble before the show and I thought we had her and then

01:56.520 --> 01:57.520
it slipped for me.

01:57.520 --> 01:58.520
That's right.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.520
Uh, as you can see, I've got a new camera.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.520
Yeah.

02:01.520 --> 02:02.520
You look really good.

02:02.520 --> 02:03.520
New camera.

02:03.520 --> 02:04.520
Yeah.

02:04.520 --> 02:05.520
Yeah.

02:05.520 --> 02:09.220
It's just the thing is, is that, um, I don't have a long enough cable for it.

02:09.220 --> 02:14.360
So it's nestled in an awkward spot until I can get it adjusted.

02:14.360 --> 02:16.520
Yeah, but it works.

02:16.520 --> 02:21.080
We get, we get the whole sense of your, your nerdy, your nerd cave that you have going

02:21.080 --> 02:22.080
on there.

02:22.080 --> 02:23.080
So it looks good.

02:23.080 --> 02:24.080
Yeah.

02:24.080 --> 02:25.080
Glad to see it.

02:25.080 --> 02:30.400
Uh, I have my, uh, right behind me is that I finally got my supernatural shelf put together

02:30.400 --> 02:34.080
and I realized I need another shelf for it.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.680
One more shelf is never enough.

02:35.680 --> 02:40.960
Uh, going to our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, VOG network, because again, we

02:40.960 --> 02:46.000
do tape live on Sunday nights over there, uh, pixel pocket saying, woo, new camera and

02:46.000 --> 02:48.520
pod culture saying, I like the blue on that wall.

02:48.520 --> 02:49.520
I do too.

02:49.520 --> 02:50.520
It's a good color.

02:50.520 --> 02:51.520
Blue.

02:51.520 --> 02:52.520
Sorry.

02:52.520 --> 02:53.520
Podcast folks.

02:53.520 --> 02:54.520
The color Matt painted it, but it's a good color.

02:54.520 --> 02:58.360
It's a good, um, people don't always remember this used to be grandpa's house.

02:58.360 --> 02:59.360
Yes.

02:59.360 --> 03:02.340
I don't know if everybody knew that, but, or captain Matt, depending on which shows

03:02.340 --> 03:07.960
you listen to, but yeah, so, um, now, um, what was I gonna say?

03:07.960 --> 03:10.320
Oh, I was going to ask how your, how your new year's went.

03:10.320 --> 03:13.040
Cause it was, it was kind of weird this year.

03:13.040 --> 03:17.520
I mean, obviously with, with no parties or anything, but just, I watched the time square

03:17.520 --> 03:22.080
thing on TV and it was so weird.

03:22.080 --> 03:25.280
Did you partake in any of that?

03:25.280 --> 03:26.760
Played crossing at midnight.

03:26.760 --> 03:28.840
Oh, of course.

03:28.840 --> 03:29.840
That's it.

03:29.840 --> 03:34.800
I didn't, it, it, it actually wasn't even anything worth talking about.

03:34.800 --> 03:35.800
Yeah.

03:35.800 --> 03:39.280
The, well, the, the animation and animal crossing was super cute.

03:39.280 --> 03:42.560
I saw, um, like a lot of people were doing the clips and putting it, you know, cause

03:42.600 --> 03:44.160
Nintendo has the share thing.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.100
So a lot of people were putting it on Twitter that way.

03:46.100 --> 03:50.240
And I seem to remember making a quip that, um, the, the animal crossing parties looked

03:50.240 --> 03:53.160
a little more hopping than time square did this year.

03:53.160 --> 03:54.600
So it was, uh, it was cute.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.520
I loved the way Nintendo did it.

03:56.520 --> 03:57.520
It's super cute.

03:57.520 --> 04:06.560
Well, I mean, I liked the music in it, I reckon, um, we really, uh, it, the music is actually

04:06.560 --> 04:11.580
what made me kind of happy with new year and then, um, but for the most part, I just wasn't

04:11.580 --> 04:12.580
feeling it.

04:12.580 --> 04:14.780
I haven't really been feeling any holiday, anything.

04:14.780 --> 04:23.100
Um, I hear you, but there's also, I mean, there's been some, uh, some personal drama

04:23.100 --> 04:29.980
around those lines just with, you know, uh, anniversary of people who we've lost and sure

04:29.980 --> 04:30.980
things like that.

04:30.980 --> 04:35.100
So, well, um, let here's hoping that there is, is light at the end of the tunnel for

04:35.100 --> 04:36.100
2021.

04:36.100 --> 04:40.620
And, you know, we can all, we can all get our vaccines and, and bring OLR back together

04:40.660 --> 04:44.820
again, uh, later this year, whenever it may be, and I don't think we have any realistic

04:44.820 --> 04:45.820
timeframe yet.

04:45.820 --> 04:49.140
Um, we'll do it when it's safe for those that are curious, like when's, when's the gang

04:49.140 --> 04:50.140
going to get back together?

04:50.140 --> 04:53.020
Uh, I'd like to know that too, but there's a lot of factors.

04:53.020 --> 04:56.580
So we're just going to keep doing what we're doing in the meantime, which is, uh, worked

04:56.580 --> 05:01.700
out for us, um, through 2020 best it could, uh, let's go on these lines.

05:01.700 --> 05:06.940
We were still together just virtually, virtually together at home.

05:06.940 --> 05:07.940
Yes.

05:07.940 --> 05:08.940
That whole thing.

05:08.940 --> 05:09.940
Absolutely.

05:10.260 --> 05:14.620
Um, just a little bit last week, like, um, you know, uh, I, I was always kind of skeptical

05:14.620 --> 05:19.380
of the idea if it would really work and I'm not sure that technology was really there

05:19.380 --> 05:24.140
even like three, four years ago before disco cord was so commonplace now.

05:24.140 --> 05:27.260
Um, I don't think we could have done this over Skype as easy.

05:27.260 --> 05:28.260
I really don't.

05:28.260 --> 05:31.900
Um, but I think some of the newer things, you know, zoom, I guess we could have used

05:31.900 --> 05:36.660
this or everybody else is using stream yard, not stuff, but, um, uh, I really think the

05:36.660 --> 05:41.580
technologies, thank heavens were there for shows like us and many others, uh, right at

05:41.580 --> 05:43.300
the right time for sure.

05:43.300 --> 05:45.220
So, um, yeah.

05:45.220 --> 05:48.420
And I hope you guys are all staying safe out there as well.

05:48.420 --> 05:52.380
Um, also I did, I should know, well, let me, I'll note it in a minute.

05:52.380 --> 05:54.220
Let me also introduce, I don't make him sit there anymore.

05:54.220 --> 05:55.380
Say hello to tech master.

05:55.380 --> 05:56.380
Loki.

05:56.380 --> 05:57.380
Hello.

05:57.380 --> 05:58.380
Hi.

05:58.380 --> 05:59.380
How are you?

05:59.380 --> 06:00.380
I'm fine.

06:00.380 --> 06:01.380
Sorry.

06:01.380 --> 06:02.380
Jamie and I had to dish.

06:02.380 --> 06:03.900
Uh, you had a big start to the year.

06:03.900 --> 06:06.260
We've got to, we got to talk about this.

06:06.260 --> 06:09.660
You dropped something big.

06:09.660 --> 06:17.660
You took a big crap at the end of the year, but like, you know, uh, there was some, some

06:17.660 --> 06:22.380
bugs that I didn't anticipate that I had to fix, but yeah, I tell us about, I released,

06:22.380 --> 06:29.300
I released a, uh, new year's, uh, New Year's Eve, what was New Year's Eve, um, demo for

06:29.300 --> 06:30.420
a pixel poops too.

06:30.420 --> 06:36.820
So it's got five brand new levels, uh, a few of which that are new year's themes.

06:36.820 --> 06:42.260
And I have like a fun, uh, color changing thing to go along with that and stuff.

06:42.260 --> 06:44.520
So it's, it's available now.

06:44.520 --> 06:48.320
You can download it and play it and check it out.

06:48.320 --> 06:56.940
And it's available over on itch.io on your page, which it's a techmastergames.itch.io.

06:57.940 --> 07:02.740
It's also linked in Discord and on my social media and all that stuff.

07:02.740 --> 07:03.740
Nice.

07:03.740 --> 07:04.740
Well, congratulations.

07:04.740 --> 07:08.100
I did download it and check it out and you have to, you have to have, um, very specific

07:08.100 --> 07:10.340
emulators to run it.

07:10.340 --> 07:15.280
But I, so I used one of the ones you said, yeah, messin's really the best way to go with

07:15.280 --> 07:16.280
that.

07:16.280 --> 07:22.260
Um, I'm going to put together, there's this thing called nest tech, um, that one of the

07:22.260 --> 07:26.200
guys in the community that made this game flee put together to actually publish his

07:26.200 --> 07:27.960
games on steam.

07:27.960 --> 07:31.000
And so it's kind of a wrapper for NES games.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.560
And so it works okay.

07:32.560 --> 07:36.600
Um, I actually checked it out to try to do that.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.800
So I'm just going to set that up and I'll put that up as another download as well.

07:39.800 --> 07:40.800
Nice.

07:40.800 --> 07:44.440
And then that way you don't have to worry about trying to find the emulator and get

07:44.440 --> 07:46.000
your stuff configured.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.760
You can just load it and it'll go.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.640
And so that'd be another way to try it out.

07:49.640 --> 07:50.920
Um, I'll be coming soon.

07:50.960 --> 07:57.480
I, I, I, um, downloaded it and I played a little bit, but I didn't play too much because

07:57.480 --> 08:00.640
I want to do a Twitch stream of it.

08:00.640 --> 08:03.560
And that'll happen soon with awesome games done quick this week.

08:03.560 --> 08:06.360
It might not happen until next week, but that's, that's on the agenda.

08:06.360 --> 08:11.200
I want to, I want to stream Loki's game because here we are, it's been what, like three years.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.120
And now I'm sitting here going, I played Loki's game.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.120
I did.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.520
I can say that here's how we're starting 2021.

08:18.520 --> 08:23.200
I played Loki's game and you have a few folks in chat who checked it out as well.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.200
So congrats.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.200
Yeah.

08:25.200 --> 08:30.240
So I tried to make it difficult because it is going to be, you know, um, it obviously

08:30.240 --> 08:35.320
like if I was just to release the first few levels I had made so far, like in my actual

08:35.320 --> 08:39.320
game, um, it wouldn't be difficult at all, but I just tried to ramp up the difficulty

08:39.320 --> 08:45.600
as each level went on and it also changed the way that the continues work because typically

08:45.600 --> 08:50.280
in the main game, it's going to be, you know, if you continue within like, say a span of

08:50.280 --> 08:53.760
like 10 levels, it resets you back to the beginning of whatever world you're in.

08:53.760 --> 08:57.880
And since this is like a five level demo, it is just resets you back to whatever level

08:57.880 --> 09:00.440
you're in and you get three continues.

09:00.440 --> 09:09.120
Although, I mean, I'm sure you could figure out a way to get more continued if, if, if

09:09.120 --> 09:16.360
you use, you know, certain methods that you might've used in, say, I don't know, Contra

09:16.360 --> 09:22.560
or, okay, shine a fucking spotlight on it, low-key.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.560
But that's okay.

09:23.560 --> 09:26.960
So the Konami code does work, so give it a try.

09:26.960 --> 09:27.960
All right.

09:27.960 --> 09:32.360
Um, and so I just tried to make it a little bit challenging and I have actually ramped

09:32.360 --> 09:37.500
the difficulty down in the last level because I had the spawn time a little bit tighter.

09:37.500 --> 09:41.220
So it was spawning much faster and it got really, really difficult.

09:41.220 --> 09:45.740
So I had to ramp it down because I do want people to actually be able to complete it.

09:45.740 --> 09:46.740
Okay.

09:46.740 --> 09:51.340
So, well, I'm, uh, I'm excited for you to release the full game and it sounds like you

09:51.340 --> 09:52.820
have different ways you can approach it.

09:52.820 --> 09:55.060
Like whether you do like a steam wrapper type of thing.

09:55.060 --> 09:59.080
And of course you had talked about doing some limited, very, very limited cartridge runs

09:59.080 --> 10:00.080
as well.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.940
And I know some of our folks will be into that and, and we'll hear more about that throughout

10:02.940 --> 10:03.940
the year, but congrats.

10:03.940 --> 10:12.900
I did commission artwork for the, um, the actual, um, cartridges themselves and possibly

10:12.900 --> 10:14.080
packaging and stuff like that.

10:14.080 --> 10:18.820
So I've actually be coming in a few weeks, but yeah, it, it it'll be fun.

10:18.820 --> 10:19.820
I'm excited.

10:19.820 --> 10:23.100
Now we get to say game developer, Loki.

10:23.100 --> 10:26.900
You're no longer tech master, Loki, your game developer, Loki.

10:26.900 --> 10:27.900
Okay.

10:27.900 --> 10:29.460
All right.

10:29.460 --> 10:30.460
Anyway.

10:30.460 --> 10:33.020
Uh, let's get into some news.

10:33.100 --> 10:36.940
Well, let's be, let's be honest, the news this week is a little bit lighter, um, as

10:36.940 --> 10:37.940
it usually is.

10:37.940 --> 10:38.940
A little?

10:38.940 --> 10:39.940
Yeah.

10:39.940 --> 10:40.940
I know this, I'm going to be real.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.980
We, we have a few things to talk about and we will, but the news that like the types

10:43.980 --> 10:48.420
of news items we have tonight would probably be like rapid fire any other week.

10:48.420 --> 10:53.220
So it's, it's, it's, you know, there's not a lot going on because of, uh, new, the new

10:53.220 --> 10:57.540
year and the holiday and, and what have you, it's just this, the site, most people probably

10:57.540 --> 10:59.580
in the game industry are just off this week.

10:59.580 --> 11:04.400
In fact, a lot of, uh, journalists and people that report on the industry are off this week.

11:04.400 --> 11:08.460
Even if we're all, you know, staying at home, well, a, we know not everybody stayed at home,

11:08.460 --> 11:12.820
unfortunately, but B, even if you're staying at home, it's still good to take a break.

11:12.820 --> 11:16.220
You don't want to necessarily be working, you know, 365 a year.

11:16.220 --> 11:19.540
So the industry slowed down this week with the new year and everything.

11:19.540 --> 11:21.300
So the news is slowing down as well.

11:21.300 --> 11:24.680
There's a few things that we'll get into it, but this is a really good time for us to take

11:24.680 --> 11:26.580
a look back on 2020.

11:26.620 --> 11:28.620
I know as much as we want to avoid it.

11:28.620 --> 11:33.620
Um, I think there was a great comic out there and I know I shared it on Twitter and Jamie,

11:33.620 --> 11:35.540
I saw you posted it on Facebook.

11:35.540 --> 11:39.540
It was a, it was a great comic that was, uh, and I'm sorry, I forget the artist's name,

11:39.540 --> 11:44.460
but it showed the year 2020 like talking to the grim reaper or something going was, was

11:44.460 --> 11:46.020
I a good year?

11:46.020 --> 11:53.620
And the grim reaper goes, no, Jesus Christ, fuck no, even though it's like the little

11:53.660 --> 11:54.660
dog one.

11:54.660 --> 11:55.660
Was I a good boy?

11:55.660 --> 11:56.660
Yes.

11:56.660 --> 11:57.660
It was a, it was a parody of that.

11:57.660 --> 11:58.660
Yeah, exactly.

11:58.660 --> 12:04.140
Um, it was that which when you wait, I know we don't want to look back on 2020, but when

12:04.140 --> 12:08.220
it comes to games, there were some pretty good ones and this is always a fun thing for

12:08.220 --> 12:09.220
us to do.

12:09.220 --> 12:12.860
And I'm sure half the shows, if not more that you listen to are doing something similar.

12:12.860 --> 12:17.220
And that is to look back on our favorite games of the year.

12:17.220 --> 12:22.580
And I don't like to say the best games of the year or the definitive, no, because everybody's

12:22.580 --> 12:24.200
got their own opinions.

12:24.200 --> 12:27.620
These are our favorite games of the year and there's nothing you can do about it, period.

12:27.620 --> 12:33.300
Um, and you know what, sometimes a game might sneak in there that didn't actually come out

12:33.300 --> 12:34.300
this year.

12:34.300 --> 12:36.940
Uh, I mean, look at among us, right?

12:36.940 --> 12:40.340
I mean, that game has been getting lots of accolades this year.

12:40.340 --> 12:46.060
Technically that came out in 2018 some people take issue with Hades and the early access

12:46.060 --> 12:47.180
to that game.

12:47.180 --> 12:48.740
Not really a 2020 game.

12:48.740 --> 12:51.400
Those rules do not apply here at OLR.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.280
They are our favorite games of 2020.

12:54.280 --> 12:58.840
Um, usually we would go around and go like three, three, three, two, two, two, one,

12:58.840 --> 12:59.840
one, one.

12:59.840 --> 13:03.440
But I think I just want to, you know, with, with the crazy year it's been and the interesting

13:03.440 --> 13:09.040
game releases, I think I just want to let people go and give their lists and, and talk

13:09.040 --> 13:10.400
about their reasons why.

13:10.400 --> 13:14.980
So, um, can, can I call on dark soccer to go first?

13:14.980 --> 13:18.960
Only because I was going to say, I have a really good idea of what's coming.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.540
It was all animal crossing.

13:21.540 --> 13:24.100
I mean, that was really it all animal crossing.

13:24.100 --> 13:26.560
I didn't really play anything else, but animal crossing.

13:26.560 --> 13:30.600
Um, the other stuff that I played was just like retro games.

13:30.600 --> 13:34.800
Like, you know, pop and twi- I played a lot of pop and twinbee.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.520
I played a lot of Puyo Puyo.

13:36.520 --> 13:40.580
So I guess actually that Puyo Puyo championship thing that came out, I would put that as number

13:40.580 --> 13:42.080
two.

13:42.080 --> 13:47.700
Um, but animal crossing, just animal crossing.

13:47.700 --> 13:52.420
Why do you think, like, is, is retro, you know, I don't, I don't need to get too like

13:52.420 --> 13:55.700
into like, what is going through your brain, dark soccer, but just trying to see if maybe

13:55.700 --> 14:00.840
there's something here about like, do you think like the retro games in this year have

14:00.840 --> 14:03.860
been kind of like comfort food in a way?

14:03.860 --> 14:05.180
Yeah, pretty much.

14:05.180 --> 14:10.140
I mean, it's just like, you know, it's, do I want to go out to this fancy new restaurant

14:10.140 --> 14:16.740
that's opened up and everyone loves, or do I want pizza and I want pizza because even

14:16.780 --> 14:19.460
when pizza is bad, it's still pretty fucking good.

14:19.460 --> 14:21.460
Wasn't that a quote, mawrats?

14:21.460 --> 14:23.180
Anyway, or clerks.

14:23.180 --> 14:24.860
Um, no, I hear you.

14:24.860 --> 14:29.540
You know, what's funny because even on the Xbox Series X that I have, I was going back

14:29.540 --> 14:34.500
into my library the other day and I was like, I want to go play gyrus because they released

14:34.500 --> 14:35.940
that on the 360 at one point.

14:35.940 --> 14:40.780
So it's in my library and I had it and I ended up having like a retro day around here and

14:40.780 --> 14:45.940
I, I, and that's kind of why I asked the question is because you know, with as crazy of a year

14:45.940 --> 14:51.500
as it's been, sometimes those old standards and those old go-tos have been the, the comfort

14:51.500 --> 14:53.500
food, the pizza we've needed this year.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.740
So like, I get it.

14:54.740 --> 14:55.740
I do.

14:55.740 --> 15:01.460
Um, SSG100Matt says, uh, I didn't really play too many new 2020 games.

15:01.460 --> 15:05.320
I mostly dug into my backlog that I never touched after I bought them.

15:05.320 --> 15:08.700
So Firewatch was one of my favorite games I played in 2020.

15:08.700 --> 15:12.220
That's a very good point as well about now's the time to dig into the backlog.

15:12.220 --> 15:15.180
Fifth Dream says comfort games came out this year.

15:15.180 --> 15:16.180
Absolutely.

15:16.180 --> 15:20.180
Uh, yeah, I think it was early, early in the year, maybe late last year.

15:20.180 --> 15:21.180
Here's how I'm going to put it.

15:21.180 --> 15:27.940
I'm going to put it as Animal Crossing first and then Breath of the Wild, um, because that's

15:27.940 --> 15:31.820
still, you know, just beautiful and way at the top of the list.

15:31.820 --> 15:33.620
And I'm going to say P.O.P.O.

15:33.620 --> 15:34.620
Championships.

15:34.620 --> 15:35.580
All right.

15:35.580 --> 15:38.140
That's her list and you can't do anything about it.

15:38.140 --> 15:39.140
Yeah.

15:39.140 --> 15:40.700
Um, let's see.

15:41.220 --> 15:42.220
Let's see.

15:42.220 --> 15:43.220
Uh, yeah.

15:43.220 --> 15:45.840
And some, some other folks in chat are kind of like confirming like, yeah, I kind of went

15:45.840 --> 15:48.300
to a lot of my old go-tos as well.

15:48.300 --> 15:50.820
Quest Buster's talking about Gyros warps to Neptune.

15:50.820 --> 15:51.820
No, no, no.

15:51.820 --> 15:56.960
It's always about, you have to get to Neptune so that it's three warps to Uranus.

15:56.960 --> 15:59.180
You have to get that far in the game.

15:59.180 --> 16:00.180
That's the legendary part.

16:00.180 --> 16:01.180
Three warps.

16:01.180 --> 16:02.180
How far is a warp?

16:02.180 --> 16:03.180
I don't know.

16:03.180 --> 16:07.020
Um, anyway, and some folks just talking about some of their comfort games for the year.

16:07.020 --> 16:08.020
Okay.

16:08.020 --> 16:09.840
Um, Loki, how about your list?

16:09.840 --> 16:13.220
You have, you have comfort games on your list or what, how does your 2020 best stuff

16:13.220 --> 16:15.960
shaped up, shape up?

16:15.960 --> 16:23.840
Um, so I've got, let's see, hotshots racing.

16:23.840 --> 16:27.640
That was a pretty fun one because it was kind of like a nineties arcade racer game.

16:27.640 --> 16:30.720
So that was definitely, um, up there.

16:30.720 --> 16:38.880
Uh, gosh, it was hard to decide with like my top three, probably I'd say, um, I don't

16:38.920 --> 16:39.920
know.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.840
Final fantasy seven was all right, but I never finished it.

16:41.840 --> 16:46.760
The remake, um, half-life Alex, I think made more of an impact.

16:46.760 --> 16:47.760
I think on me.

16:47.760 --> 16:50.680
Cause I thought it was just a really excellent VR game.

16:50.680 --> 16:56.400
Um, so half-life Alex, and then of course, cyberpunk 2077, even though it's a buggy mess,

16:56.400 --> 16:57.960
but it's still a great game.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.600
When does that ever bothered you?

16:59.600 --> 17:00.800
It doesn't.

17:00.800 --> 17:01.800
Yeah.

17:01.800 --> 17:05.880
It just adds to it actually, as long as it doesn't break the game where I can't play

17:05.880 --> 17:07.880
it, then I really don't care.

17:08.200 --> 17:13.400
Uh, are you, are you purposely putting bugs into, into your, your game?

17:13.400 --> 17:15.280
Not purposely, but there's stuff.

17:15.280 --> 17:21.040
I know where the bugs are and there's some, some that I can't do anything about and some

17:21.040 --> 17:28.200
that maybe my, my rainbow effect caused more problems for, but, uh, you know, that's fine.

17:28.200 --> 17:31.440
But no, I'm not purposely putting bugs in the game.

17:31.440 --> 17:36.200
Um, orange right is a kind of a green kind of, kind of with a hybrid here of what Jamie

17:36.200 --> 17:40.480
and Loki have both said, saying I pretty much stuck to retro games and games that were on

17:40.480 --> 17:41.880
my backlog pile.

17:41.880 --> 17:45.760
Only 2020 games I really played were animal crossing and hotshot racing.

17:45.760 --> 17:49.800
So it's been mainly Minecraft this year again.

17:49.800 --> 17:54.000
So it's like, I can't, I can't really do that again, but yeah.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.440
Well then I think that's been an important one for you to entertain the kids too, which

17:58.440 --> 18:02.920
is something a lot of people are going through in the pandemic is how do I entertain my kids

18:02.920 --> 18:07.720
all day, every day when I was used to school being a part of this and outdoor stuff and

18:07.720 --> 18:11.160
go going over to someone else's house, you know, that thing it's, it's, that's all been

18:11.160 --> 18:12.160
disrupted this year.

18:12.160 --> 18:16.080
Well, I finally got a discord set up for my son and his friends.

18:16.080 --> 18:21.040
So now that they can, they can chat now with each other, which has been like, he's really

18:21.040 --> 18:22.040
enjoyed that.

18:22.040 --> 18:27.400
So they're, they're playing like among us and stuff, um, and Roblox doing that.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.400
So that's kind of fun.

18:28.400 --> 18:29.400
Fun.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.400
Nice.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.400
All right.

18:31.400 --> 18:32.840
So here's the plot to my top three.

18:32.840 --> 18:33.840
So here we go.

18:33.840 --> 18:38.440
And honestly, like I, I'm kind of with you guys in the sense that like, if you asked

18:38.440 --> 18:42.240
me to give a number four, I'm not sure I could give one.

18:42.240 --> 18:49.440
Um, I just kind of feel like I have three and then like you guys, Final Fantasy 14,

18:49.440 --> 18:54.280
that's my comfort food and continues to be like the social interaction that I get with

18:54.280 --> 18:58.240
other people, you know, being able to play with, you know, my friend Shane and my friend

18:58.240 --> 19:02.480
Ray and the people that I've played that game with online for a while now, it's, it's

19:02.480 --> 19:04.060
a good social thing.

19:04.060 --> 19:09.840
So like, honestly, that should be in my top three, but it's not, I did go with games that

19:09.840 --> 19:13.320
came out this year just because I did play enough that I did think were that good.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.320
So here we go.

19:14.320 --> 19:18.480
Um, my number three game, I'm going to say the Final Fantasy seven remake.

19:18.480 --> 19:27.400
Um, I don't think it's very often that games have so much behind it when it comes to like

19:27.400 --> 19:32.240
the hype and being able to live up to those expectations.

19:32.240 --> 19:38.000
But I feel like Final Fantasy seven remake did a great job of delivering a quality game.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.020
And I think we've seen time and time again where sometimes that bar gets raised so high,

19:42.020 --> 19:45.720
the games can't really meet it and they end up, you know, getting a lot of backlash with

19:45.720 --> 19:46.720
that.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.840
I didn't feel that at all with Final Fantasy seven.

19:48.840 --> 19:51.240
Did I have some minor complaints about the game?

19:51.240 --> 19:52.240
Sure.

19:52.240 --> 19:55.880
I think a lot of people did, but did I feel like I was getting an experience worthy of

19:55.880 --> 20:02.080
being like Final Fantasy 16, um, not to be confused with the actual Final Fantasy 16

20:02.080 --> 20:03.480
that got announced this year.

20:03.480 --> 20:07.560
But did I feel like I was playing the next iteration of a Final Fantasy game with some

20:07.560 --> 20:08.560
familiar characters?

20:08.560 --> 20:10.020
Yes, I did.

20:10.020 --> 20:15.680
And I have to, and the one thing I really wasn't expecting, I was ready to be pissed

20:15.680 --> 20:21.160
about the story to not like to, to, to be like, why did they make just the mid guard

20:21.160 --> 20:25.560
section of the, I almost said mid guard somewhere, the mid guard section of the game, the entire

20:25.560 --> 20:27.680
first game, why did they do that?

20:27.680 --> 20:33.680
But I think the game throughout its paces justified what they did.

20:33.680 --> 20:38.240
And without spoiling the ending and getting into the ending, I found the ending to be

20:38.240 --> 20:47.500
something where I was like, damn, that was not what I expected, but that's great.

20:47.500 --> 20:50.040
And you know, really kind of leaves the door open for what's next.

20:50.120 --> 20:55.200
And I do think a lot of people are going to revisit this game this year in 2021.

20:55.200 --> 20:59.040
I know we're going to do predictions next week, but I can already tell you, I will absolutely

20:59.040 --> 21:05.780
predict there will be a Final Fantasy 7 remaster plus International Edition we'll say, or something

21:05.780 --> 21:10.760
like that, that will come with maybe a couple extra fights in the, in the section of the

21:10.760 --> 21:17.420
game where you can kind of pick fights, maybe another limited chapter, maybe allowing more

21:17.420 --> 21:21.700
control of one character who you never get to control later on in the game.

21:21.700 --> 21:28.140
I see some doors available to open a little bit to make just that Final Fantasy 7 plus

21:28.140 --> 21:32.940
in the way that you got Final Fantasy 12, the Zodiac Age, and Final Fantasy 10 International

21:32.940 --> 21:35.500
and sometimes they do it with Kingdom Hearts.

21:35.500 --> 21:40.580
And maybe if you beat it, like Kingdom Hearts, if you beat it all and you get that, you know,

21:40.580 --> 21:48.700
perfect run of the game, maybe an extra scene that will start to lead into chapter two of

21:48.700 --> 21:50.860
the Final Fantasy 7 remake.

21:50.860 --> 21:54.380
And I really believe that's going to come this year because we're going to have the

21:54.380 --> 21:57.060
end of the Xbox exclusive window.

21:57.060 --> 21:59.900
So I don't see why Square wouldn't want to release the game there.

21:59.900 --> 22:02.820
And if they're going to do it there, they're going to do a version that's optimized for

22:02.820 --> 22:07.180
the X and the S. They're going to do a PC version that's in tandem with that, which

22:07.180 --> 22:09.820
means yay mods for that crowd.

22:09.820 --> 22:13.780
And then of course, the PlayStation 5 is going to need a version to bring that up to parody.

22:13.780 --> 22:18.860
So I fully anticipate there will be a Final Fantasy 7 plus international edition, something

22:18.860 --> 22:21.300
along those lines for holiday this year.

22:21.300 --> 22:25.140
If not holiday this year, certainly next year.

22:25.140 --> 22:29.460
But I think when the Xbox exclusive window kind of runs out, I think they're going to

22:29.460 --> 22:31.900
be itching for their own version of that game.

22:31.900 --> 22:37.020
So I was going to say so I have a check because I couldn't remember exactly when I downloaded

22:37.020 --> 22:43.860
the app, but apparently it was very almost a 20 20 when I downloaded Orna.

22:43.860 --> 22:48.780
So I definitely have to add Orna to the list as well, because I mean, that was pretty much

22:48.780 --> 22:50.000
this entire year.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.140
So I'll allow it.

22:51.140 --> 22:52.140
You're right.

22:52.140 --> 22:53.900
I'm totally ignoring my GPS game thing.

22:53.900 --> 22:55.780
Orna, Ingress, Pogo, all of it.

22:55.780 --> 22:57.900
I'm kind of ignoring it.

22:57.900 --> 23:01.540
But yeah, I think those were very important this year as well.

23:01.540 --> 23:08.860
Speaking in chat, DJ Rama S theorizes, Rob, expect the Xbox version to be a digital release

23:08.860 --> 23:09.860
only.

23:09.860 --> 23:11.300
I'm curious more why you think that is.

23:11.300 --> 23:15.300
Is that like a supply issue or is that is it going to be on Game Pass?

23:15.300 --> 23:17.660
Maybe not there.

23:17.660 --> 23:22.600
And Phoenix 7726 says, God, no, please finish the saga first.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.620
Leave the milking to EA or Activision.

23:24.620 --> 23:26.300
Kingdom Hearts was bad enough with that.

23:26.300 --> 23:27.680
I hear you, Phoenix.

23:27.680 --> 23:29.620
It's not that I disagree.

23:29.620 --> 23:37.060
It's just this whole now PlayStation 5 and Xbox X and S are the new thing.

23:37.060 --> 23:43.620
And I just I can't I don't see why Square wouldn't take the opportunity to try to milk

23:43.620 --> 23:45.740
another.

23:45.740 --> 23:47.580
Maybe they won't go 60 bucks.

23:47.580 --> 23:49.380
Maybe they'll go down to 40.

23:49.380 --> 23:51.260
But they'll definitely try to milk for more money.

23:51.260 --> 23:55.180
So are we going to get Crisis Core and Dirge of Cerberus in there?

23:55.180 --> 23:57.260
Yeah, I fucking hope not.

23:57.260 --> 24:02.140
Like, get get to work on part two, the whip like it's we're ready for it.

24:02.140 --> 24:06.540
But anyway, they need to take the approach of Activision, where they have like five different

24:06.540 --> 24:13.660
companies working on one property and they just keep churning out more content for it.

24:13.660 --> 24:18.340
And Dijarama is saying Squeenix did it with Kingdom Hearts and Nier Automata.

24:18.340 --> 24:22.780
Every exclusive release the PS4s have from Square Enix ends up as a digital release on

24:22.780 --> 24:24.060
Xbox a year later.

24:24.060 --> 24:25.060
All right.

24:25.060 --> 24:26.060
I didn't think about that.

24:26.060 --> 24:29.740
I thought Kingdom Hearts had a disc version, but maybe I'm wrong.

24:29.740 --> 24:30.740
All right.

24:30.740 --> 24:34.620
OK, so that was my number three game Final Fantasy 7 remake.

24:34.620 --> 24:36.500
My number two game.

24:36.500 --> 24:38.140
This may come as a surprise.

24:38.140 --> 24:41.780
My number two game for the year, I'm going to say, is Hades.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.940
Hades.

24:43.940 --> 24:51.860
It's it's it's cool because Hades is almost in a way like the antithesis of the Final

24:51.860 --> 25:01.260
Fantasy 7 remake because you have Final Fantasy 7, the big game, the huge game and all this

25:01.260 --> 25:02.580
stuff that comes out.

25:02.580 --> 25:07.620
And then Hades is like this this indie game that comes out of nowhere almost.

25:07.620 --> 25:13.740
I mean, yes, it had the hype from the, you know, the lead up and all that stuff with

25:13.740 --> 25:15.460
the early access.

25:15.460 --> 25:21.700
But again, I still I really think Hades kind of came through because of the Switch release

25:21.740 --> 25:23.500
and that's what really put it on everybody's radar.

25:23.500 --> 25:25.820
So I do really consider it at least that was for me.

25:25.820 --> 25:33.460
I do consider it a 2020 game, but it's like this little indie game that did amazing.

25:33.460 --> 25:37.260
And Hades.

25:37.260 --> 25:43.380
Tells a story with very familiar characters, and it has a game in a very familiar type

25:43.380 --> 25:48.600
of game that's been a very controversial genre for a long time, the roguelike.

25:48.600 --> 25:57.400
But it does all of these things so well that it doesn't need the bells and whistles of

25:57.400 --> 26:05.720
2020 graphics, 2020 flair and the things we would expect from PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series

26:05.720 --> 26:06.720
X.

26:06.720 --> 26:14.600
It's just a really good game with really great voice acting, really great story and really

26:14.600 --> 26:20.480
great mechanics that is absolutely worth your time and quite stellar and one of the

26:20.480 --> 26:21.480
best games of the year.

26:21.480 --> 26:25.360
And if you're afraid of Hades because you don't like roguelikes, I would really urge

26:25.360 --> 26:30.760
you to take a step back and give this one a different go because it does things differently

26:30.760 --> 26:33.000
than other roguelikes have before.

26:33.000 --> 26:39.220
And it doesn't build on itself quite the same way that other roguelikes have done before.

26:39.220 --> 26:44.220
It's a little bit slower, and that's actually a good thing, I think, the way it does it

26:44.220 --> 26:46.020
and a little more limited.

26:46.020 --> 26:50.940
And I think that really allows you to experience the story in a full way.

26:50.940 --> 26:58.020
And Shane is in chat this year and going after me saying, I have wrong opinions about Hades.

26:58.020 --> 26:59.860
Nothing was better than Hades this year.

26:59.860 --> 27:01.060
Not even the new Frog Fractions.

27:01.060 --> 27:02.620
Oh, I forgot about that one.

27:02.620 --> 27:03.620
Maybe honorable mentions.

27:04.020 --> 27:09.180
Sia Tabiri says, you forgot incredible and thirst inducing art.

27:09.180 --> 27:13.660
Shane continues, the game underneath is amazing and the writing and music and voice acting

27:13.660 --> 27:15.380
are all great.

27:15.380 --> 27:16.820
Honestly, no lies.

27:16.820 --> 27:20.100
And is number two really that bad of a spot?

27:20.100 --> 27:21.540
I don't think it is.

27:21.540 --> 27:23.360
And it's really close.

27:23.360 --> 27:30.960
And I did do a last minute switcheroo because I really sat back and I thought about the

27:30.960 --> 27:33.920
games that came out this year and like what they've meant and so forth.

27:33.920 --> 27:41.560
So that being said, my number one game of the year is Animal Crossing.

27:41.560 --> 27:45.340
And that might surprise you because I talked about how I kind of took a break from Animal

27:45.340 --> 27:54.120
Crossing for a little bit, but I just don't think, here's the thing, and maybe this is

27:54.120 --> 27:57.080
how I play Kate Shane a little bit too, but no, this is my honest answer.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.820
This is about, you know, making anyone happy.

27:58.820 --> 28:01.540
I said it's my list and you can take it or leave it.

28:01.540 --> 28:08.180
I think in any other year, if this was 2019, if this is 2018, I think yes, Hades is number

28:08.180 --> 28:12.860
one and Animal Crossing, I'm not even sure makes the top three, maybe number three.

28:12.860 --> 28:22.220
I think because of what 2020 did to all of us and I think because of what this year has

28:22.220 --> 28:30.340
done to our culture, I think Animal Crossing provided that escape that we desperately needed.

28:30.340 --> 28:34.940
And sure, there's lots of games with great storylines, whether Hades, Final Fantasy,

28:34.940 --> 28:38.580
Cyberpunk, that maybe was the escape for you as well.

28:38.580 --> 28:44.140
But I think the things that Animal Crossing brought us with the virtual graduations, when

28:44.140 --> 28:52.000
you couldn't have a graduation in person, with the, my birthday, of course, your birthday,

28:52.000 --> 29:01.040
the ability to visit friends when you otherwise can't, I think has been so meaningful in this

29:01.040 --> 29:10.560
shit year that Animal Crossing, like, I think helped many of us get through this god-awful

29:10.560 --> 29:11.720
year.

29:11.720 --> 29:18.780
And so I think honestly, for those reasons, it deserves the kudos as the game that best

29:18.780 --> 29:21.060
represents 2020.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.780
And that's what it's about.

29:22.780 --> 29:28.380
So I thought about that for a long time, like, but I think when I was really thinking about

29:28.380 --> 29:33.600
like what, what did the games that came out this year like really mean and what really

29:33.600 --> 29:39.120
embodies what 2020 was, what is a symbol of this year?

29:39.120 --> 29:41.600
I really truly think it's Animal Crossing.

29:41.600 --> 29:44.740
And obviously, Jamie, I'm sure you have no problem hearing this.

29:44.740 --> 29:48.660
You are probably the opposite of Shane here in this regard.

29:48.660 --> 29:52.340
But I know you and I have talked about this at length.

29:52.340 --> 29:54.640
And we talked about it here on this show.

29:54.640 --> 29:56.480
And we even did an Animal Crossing.

29:56.480 --> 30:02.900
We did a special OLR that was about, and Loki, does that video, does that video have boobies

30:02.900 --> 30:03.900
in it?

30:03.900 --> 30:05.300
You got to be careful with the Twitch guidelines.

30:05.300 --> 30:08.020
No, it's hazy.

30:08.020 --> 30:09.020
It's Saints Row.

30:09.020 --> 30:10.020
All right.

30:10.020 --> 30:11.020
Just look out.

30:11.020 --> 30:12.020
All right.

30:12.020 --> 30:13.020
No nudity.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.020
All right.

30:14.020 --> 30:15.020
Anyway, sorry.

30:15.020 --> 30:17.900
There's no, there's no nudity in that game.

30:18.140 --> 30:23.860
So, um, but, um, Jamie, you know, we've kind of talked about this at length is, is about

30:23.860 --> 30:28.380
like, I think, I think it was like the therapy that like so many people kind of needed this

30:28.380 --> 30:29.380
year.

30:29.380 --> 30:30.380
It really was.

30:30.380 --> 30:31.380
Yeah.

30:31.380 --> 30:38.060
It just, it, it was there for, I don't know, it just gave people a special kind of outlet

30:38.060 --> 30:41.100
and a great distraction that was in a safe place.

30:41.100 --> 30:42.100
Yeah.

30:42.100 --> 30:44.180
You know, it was very safe.

30:44.180 --> 30:49.060
And I'm going to tell you the moment I realized that I needed to change my list actually.

30:49.060 --> 30:54.960
And the moment I realized I needed to change my list was New Year's Eve and watching that

30:54.960 --> 31:01.560
people were more interested in New Year's Eve on what was going on in their Animal Crossing

31:01.560 --> 31:02.560
towns.

31:02.560 --> 31:06.020
And this goes far beyond even just the audience of this show.

31:06.020 --> 31:09.880
I'm talking about, you know, generally what I saw on social media and everything.

31:09.880 --> 31:13.120
There was more interest in what was going on in people's Animal Crossing towns than

31:13.120 --> 31:18.040
there was going on in, in Times Square and any of that on TV and so forth.

31:18.040 --> 31:25.440
And I think that's just a sign of, of everything of 2020.

31:25.440 --> 31:29.980
So I also, I'm also very appreciative that Nintendo has still continued to support the

31:29.980 --> 31:32.040
game as strongly as it has.

31:32.040 --> 31:36.280
So anyway, I'm going to other comments.

31:36.280 --> 31:40.480
As Jonah and Matt says, Rob distracted by strippers, it happened.

31:40.820 --> 31:45.480
Shane in chat says Animal Crossing was great, not to crap on it at all and probably deserve

31:45.480 --> 31:47.800
somewhere in the top five for sure.

31:47.800 --> 31:50.120
And that's it.

31:50.120 --> 31:51.700
Everybody's going to have a different list.

31:51.700 --> 31:56.060
And even though I gave my three, it's probably not going to match anyone else's three.

31:56.060 --> 31:57.060
And that's okay.

31:57.060 --> 31:59.920
There are games I didn't get around to playing this year.

31:59.920 --> 32:04.380
Last of Us Part Two, which many people have been hyping up, didn't get around to playing

32:04.380 --> 32:10.240
it this year because it's the zombie gore stuff that I'm a little...

32:10.240 --> 32:12.880
Although people are telling me I need to give it a rest and try it already.

32:12.880 --> 32:15.980
So maybe that's a 2021 thing, we'll see.

32:15.980 --> 32:19.900
Ghost of Tsushima is another one I just haven't gotten around to yet that I understand is

32:19.900 --> 32:21.520
very good as well.

32:21.520 --> 32:27.080
And there's plenty of others, but I think everything we all collectively named and many

32:27.080 --> 32:30.840
of your favorites as well are worth playing.

32:30.840 --> 32:35.720
And honestly, it's funny because he keeps changing his name.

32:35.720 --> 32:36.720
What's his name now?

32:36.720 --> 32:39.040
No one's special 77 in chat.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.040
He always changes his name.

32:40.040 --> 32:41.040
Okay.

32:41.040 --> 32:42.040
I just have to keep track.

32:42.040 --> 32:43.040
So is it...

32:43.040 --> 32:44.040
What Nader?

32:44.040 --> 32:45.040
Is it...

32:45.040 --> 32:46.040
Okay.

32:46.040 --> 32:47.040
Oh, yes.

32:47.040 --> 32:52.800
No one's special 77 asked us last week, what are the worst games of the year?

32:52.800 --> 32:55.820
I don't think I played any.

32:55.820 --> 33:00.040
I don't think I played any game where I was like, this is bad.

33:00.040 --> 33:03.840
And what's funny later in the show, we're going to talk about what some websites said

33:03.840 --> 33:04.840
were bad.

33:04.840 --> 33:07.060
And there's actually a game that I played that's on it.

33:07.080 --> 33:10.780
And I'm not sure I would call it that bad.

33:10.780 --> 33:15.480
And I'm just not sure it was a year for crap games, but maybe because of everything else

33:15.480 --> 33:19.940
we've talked about before, we kind of got to where we talked about retro games being

33:19.940 --> 33:25.540
the comfort blanket, MMOs being that comfort food, whatever it is that you're into as your

33:25.540 --> 33:28.000
comfort games.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.300
Maybe we just didn't have time for the bad shit because of all that.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.300
I don't know.

33:32.300 --> 33:36.240
Or maybe just maybe we're just not as critical of the games and all that, but I tried to

33:36.240 --> 33:38.320
give it some real good thought.

33:38.320 --> 33:40.480
I don't have any bad games this year.

33:40.480 --> 33:41.480
I really don't.

33:41.480 --> 33:44.680
I don't know if you guys do, but.

33:44.680 --> 33:48.080
I can't think of anything.

33:48.080 --> 33:50.820
Yeah, I really can't either.

33:50.820 --> 33:56.040
I mean, like I said, I've really just been sticking to the stuff that I like or that

33:56.040 --> 33:58.320
I know that I like.

33:58.320 --> 34:02.800
I mean, Pixel Poops has crap.

34:02.800 --> 34:03.800
That's crappy.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.080
That's going to be in my 2021 list for sure.

34:05.080 --> 34:10.920
No, I will say right now, Pixel Poops, due to the conflict of interest and that I am

34:10.920 --> 34:17.680
a responsible gaming commentator on a podcast out of my spare bedroom, I will not be placing

34:17.680 --> 34:19.000
Pixel Poops on my top three.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
It is ineligible.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.720
There's a conflict of interest there.

34:21.720 --> 34:27.320
So because I'll put it on my top, Jamie's like, I'll take that.

34:27.320 --> 34:28.320
I'll take it.

34:28.320 --> 34:29.480
All right.

34:29.480 --> 34:32.040
That game is going to get enough promotion here on this show.

34:32.040 --> 34:33.040
Number 3.5.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.040
All right.

34:34.040 --> 34:35.040
Number 3.5.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.040
Questbuster.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.040
Actually.

34:37.040 --> 34:39.040
Oh, go ahead.

34:39.040 --> 34:42.920
I will actually go back and say that maybe the game that pissed me off the most this

34:42.920 --> 34:46.320
last year was Cuphead because fuck, it's hard.

34:46.320 --> 34:47.320
It is.

34:47.320 --> 34:50.880
Yep, it is Questbuster in chat says Avengers have a good

34:50.880 --> 34:54.240
has a good campaign, but the rest of it was bad.

34:54.240 --> 34:58.160
Shane is saying Ori 2 as far as good games go or in the will of the wisps.

34:58.160 --> 35:00.360
Don't forget that.

35:00.360 --> 35:01.360
Great call out.

35:01.360 --> 35:07.440
Another game that isn't on my list because I refuse to play it until I beat Ori in the

35:07.440 --> 35:12.560
Blind Forest, the first one, and like a lot of games, I ended up playing that for like

35:12.560 --> 35:13.560
four hours.

35:13.560 --> 35:19.240
Then I was like, shiny, and went somewhere else, squirrel, and went somewhere else.

35:19.240 --> 35:26.040
It happens, but God, the first game is probably on one of my most played games of this year

35:26.040 --> 35:27.200
for sure.

35:27.200 --> 35:30.320
So all right.

35:30.320 --> 35:31.320
Great discussion, you guys.

35:31.320 --> 35:32.680
A lot of good games out there.

35:32.680 --> 35:36.800
So those are that's some insight into our top games of 2020.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.160
All right.

35:38.160 --> 35:39.720
Let's take a look now.

35:39.720 --> 35:43.560
So sitting here and it's probably hard to see on camera, but sitting here, I have this

35:43.560 --> 35:49.200
little silly Darth Vader coin bank thing and I, I don't know.

35:49.200 --> 35:51.880
I don't know why it's not I know why it's in my house.

35:51.880 --> 35:57.240
It was it was a lovely gift, but it is turned into the time capsule that we have here at

35:57.240 --> 36:00.960
OLR that our predictions go into every year.

36:00.960 --> 36:06.400
We will be making predictions for 2021 next week on the show because I kind of think it's

36:06.400 --> 36:07.920
going to be a slow week next week as well.

36:07.920 --> 36:10.160
So we're going to kind of do it virtually.

36:10.160 --> 36:13.600
And I'll just write everything down to the other say, since we can't really do our own

36:13.600 --> 36:15.220
all in the same place.

36:15.220 --> 36:19.640
But I thought tonight we could take a look back at what is in the tin from last year,

36:19.640 --> 36:23.900
which I was convinced there's nothing in it, but I peeked just to see is anything in there.

36:23.900 --> 36:27.280
And there's like, there's like three slips of paper in it.

36:27.280 --> 36:29.300
So I don't know if somebody snuck things in when I wasn't looking.

36:29.300 --> 36:32.340
Maybe you put stuff in there and then, and then we forgot.

36:32.340 --> 36:35.100
No, I think that we did it all right.

36:35.100 --> 36:38.460
Or maybe we never answered it this year or last year.

36:38.460 --> 36:39.460
Well, you know what?

36:39.460 --> 36:40.460
I'm opening it.

36:40.460 --> 36:41.460
Here we go.

36:41.460 --> 36:42.460
I'm going to pull them out.

36:42.460 --> 36:43.460
Here we go.

36:43.460 --> 36:48.500
This one says, okay, this looks like Loki's handwriting.

36:48.500 --> 36:50.900
Oh, maybe I threw stuff back in there.

36:50.900 --> 36:51.900
You probably did.

36:51.900 --> 36:53.700
You probably snuck your own shit in there.

36:53.700 --> 36:54.940
All right.

36:54.940 --> 37:03.540
EA will close BioWare after Anthem underperforms due to EA shittiness, i.e. loot boxes.

37:03.540 --> 37:04.540
Well.

37:04.540 --> 37:06.620
No, they haven't done that.

37:06.620 --> 37:09.020
Anthem has underperformed.

37:09.020 --> 37:10.020
We still-

37:10.020 --> 37:11.780
Bounce back with the stuff that they rely on.

37:11.780 --> 37:12.780
Yeah.

37:12.780 --> 37:13.780
Yeah.

37:13.780 --> 37:17.940
I think, I think that's a good point is that BioWare is definitely leaning on the wheelhouse

37:17.940 --> 37:21.280
that they know will perform for them, namely Mass Effect.

37:21.280 --> 37:24.400
And I think a lot of us were worried about what was going to happen when Mass Effect

37:24.400 --> 37:28.120
after Andromeda seemed to get a lukewarm reception.

37:28.120 --> 37:32.280
But I think Mass Effect has heard loud and clear, or excuse me, BioWare has heard loud

37:32.280 --> 37:37.480
and clear that Mass Effect going back to its roots would make everybody very happy.

37:37.480 --> 37:42.560
And so now we know we're getting the remaster, you know, finally next year, it's official.

37:42.560 --> 37:46.400
And except there won't be multiplayer, so no loot boxes, Loki.

37:46.400 --> 37:51.200
And we know we have that new mystery Mass Effect game that's probably years and years

37:51.200 --> 37:52.200
out.

37:52.200 --> 37:54.080
And of course, Dragon Age as well.

37:54.080 --> 37:58.440
Still kind of is still really thin on what we know about that game.

37:58.440 --> 38:01.560
But hopefully, hopefully soon.

38:01.560 --> 38:06.220
And then Quest Buster does point out Casey Hudson and Mark Darragh left BioWare.

38:06.220 --> 38:09.100
In Hudson's case, he left again.

38:09.100 --> 38:12.320
And Shane is saying, I can't wait for him to come back a third time and leave a third

38:12.320 --> 38:13.320
time.

38:13.320 --> 38:18.240
That's like that's like I'm sorry, I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to go there and

38:18.240 --> 38:22.600
I'm not going to apologize for it, but that's that's like watching Trump lose the recount

38:22.600 --> 38:26.960
over and over in every state.

38:26.960 --> 38:27.960
He tried again.

38:27.960 --> 38:30.240
We're doing it's election night all over.

38:30.240 --> 38:33.600
And he lost again.

38:33.600 --> 38:34.600
Let's go to the next slip.

38:34.600 --> 38:35.600
All right.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.120
Another one of those, by the way.

38:37.120 --> 38:38.120
What's that?

38:38.120 --> 38:42.080
I'm still waiting for another time for him to lose, you know, before the day.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.080
January 6th.

38:43.080 --> 38:45.440
Anyway, this is the last slip.

38:45.440 --> 38:47.640
There was two slips in there.

38:47.640 --> 38:50.720
This is it.

38:50.720 --> 38:55.000
I think this might be Jamie's handwriting because it's not mine.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.480
And it says still no Half-Life 3.

38:59.480 --> 39:01.480
That was me.

39:01.480 --> 39:04.160
Well, we got Half-Life, Alex.

39:04.160 --> 39:05.160
I know.

39:05.160 --> 39:06.160
I was going to say Half-Life.

39:06.160 --> 39:07.700
That's not a three.

39:07.700 --> 39:09.020
It's not.

39:09.020 --> 39:10.760
That's in the two area.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.480
I would say this is mixed.

39:13.480 --> 39:19.320
I agree that on its technical, literal purposes, the prediction is correct.

39:19.320 --> 39:21.520
There is still no Half-Life 3.

39:21.520 --> 39:28.760
However, I would be remiss to think that Half-Life, Alex, was not internally thought of at some

39:28.760 --> 39:31.840
point to potentially be Half-Life 3.

39:31.840 --> 39:37.000
Somewhere along the way, they said two things.

39:37.000 --> 39:41.640
Number one, doing it as a VR exclusive is not going to have the effect we want it to

39:41.640 --> 39:42.680
have.

39:42.680 --> 39:45.300
So I think they pulled back for that reason.

39:45.300 --> 39:51.200
Number two, I think if they'd called it Half-Life 3, people were going to have the expectations

39:51.200 --> 39:53.520
that go with Half-Life 3.

39:53.520 --> 39:58.560
And no matter what Valve did, they were never going to be able to live up to it.

39:58.560 --> 40:04.560
And so I kind of think for that reason, we got Half-Life, Alex.

40:04.560 --> 40:07.320
I don't think we ever will get a Half-Life 3.

40:07.320 --> 40:12.280
I think if we get Half-Life, it's going to be continuing Half-Life stories kind of like

40:12.280 --> 40:14.120
what we got with Half-Life, Alex.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.520
But that's another one of those games where if you want to go back to the best games of

40:16.520 --> 40:23.440
the year, people that have played it, and especially VR enthusiasts, absolutely have

40:23.440 --> 40:25.360
it in their top.

40:25.360 --> 40:27.320
And you mentioned it, Loki, to be fair.

40:27.320 --> 40:31.640
It is absolutely a stunning piece of game.

40:31.640 --> 40:35.760
I haven't gotten around to playing it myself because I only have PlayStation VR.

40:35.760 --> 40:38.100
But I'm super curious about it.

40:38.100 --> 40:42.080
They need to do some version of that game, though, that people who can't play VR games

40:42.080 --> 40:44.560
can play.

40:44.560 --> 40:49.520
I think there was a mod that someone made to make it so that you could do without VR,

40:49.520 --> 40:51.680
but it's not good.

40:51.680 --> 40:55.880
I think there will be Half-Life games like that.

40:55.880 --> 41:01.040
I don't think they will do Half-Life, Alex, like that because...

41:01.040 --> 41:05.840
You can watch a video or anything because it makes me so sick.

41:05.840 --> 41:06.840
It's a lot.

41:06.840 --> 41:09.920
The motion is a lot.

41:09.920 --> 41:20.840
And yeah, it's interesting to see how there's been some VR games like Doom, I think, and

41:20.840 --> 41:24.920
even No Man's Sky has something like this because Doom is so fast paced.

41:24.920 --> 41:28.260
If I remember right, Doom was all about teleporting.

41:28.260 --> 41:29.260
You don't move.

41:29.260 --> 41:30.260
That's not right.

41:31.260 --> 41:32.900
That's how Half-Life, Alex, works.

41:32.900 --> 41:33.900
It's teleporting.

41:33.900 --> 41:35.900
Oh, I thought it was all like motion.

41:35.900 --> 41:36.900
Oh, okay.

41:36.900 --> 41:39.320
Well, that's good.

41:39.320 --> 41:41.780
It did seem like it was going like in everything I've seen.

41:41.780 --> 41:42.780
It's like moving very fast.

41:42.780 --> 41:46.860
You can teleport quickly, but you know, yeah, it's all teleporting.

41:46.860 --> 41:47.860
Yeah.

41:47.860 --> 41:48.860
Interesting.

41:48.860 --> 41:52.860
All right.

41:52.860 --> 41:56.140
See Bobby in chat says they would have to change the game way too much to get it to

41:56.140 --> 41:57.500
not work in VR.

41:57.500 --> 42:00.020
Yeah, I think it would end up being like a...

42:00.020 --> 42:03.140
And that's kind of like where I'm getting at is that at that point it would be a different

42:03.140 --> 42:04.140
game.

42:04.140 --> 42:09.340
And I'm not saying they shouldn't do that, but I do understand that like not every puzzle,

42:09.340 --> 42:12.980
not every element is going to be able to translate.

42:12.980 --> 42:13.980
And that's...

42:13.980 --> 42:14.980
Yeah.

42:14.980 --> 42:15.980
Let's see.

42:15.980 --> 42:18.620
What else do I want to mention here in chat?

42:18.620 --> 42:24.020
Pele Hanumea talking about what I said about Half-Life 3 and why you nailed it, Rob.

42:24.020 --> 42:27.840
And Bobby says Valve will never release a game called Half-Life 3.

42:27.840 --> 42:29.140
They would be stupid to do so.

42:29.140 --> 42:31.340
It will 100% disappoint.

42:31.340 --> 42:36.500
And I think that is exactly where Half-Life is right now.

42:36.500 --> 42:42.340
I think the game we should be asking about, and Jamie can agree with me on this, I believe,

42:42.340 --> 42:44.020
is Portal.

42:44.020 --> 42:45.500
Where's Portal 3?

42:45.500 --> 42:49.900
Or some continuing story in that universe, which technically is the Half-Life universe.

42:49.900 --> 42:52.800
I don't see them taking Portal to VR.

42:52.800 --> 42:54.820
I think that would be a bit much.

42:54.820 --> 42:55.820
Not?

42:55.820 --> 42:56.820
My God.

42:57.700 --> 42:59.340
I'm okay with most VR things.

42:59.340 --> 43:03.820
I think even that in VR would be too much.

43:03.820 --> 43:06.100
But I would love to see that universe continue.

43:06.100 --> 43:07.580
But I'm worried it's the same thing.

43:07.580 --> 43:10.340
They'll never put out a game called Portal 3 because it would never live up to the hype

43:10.340 --> 43:11.340
of 2.

43:11.340 --> 43:12.340
So.

43:12.340 --> 43:14.700
If they did it, they wouldn't put like 3 in the name.

43:14.700 --> 43:18.700
It would be like called like Portal the other side or something.

43:18.700 --> 43:21.860
Portal, all your cake and eat it too or something like that.

43:21.860 --> 43:22.860
Something with it.

43:22.860 --> 43:23.860
I don't know.

43:23.860 --> 43:24.860
I would love to see that.

43:24.900 --> 43:26.420
Honestly, for me personally, I'd love to-

43:26.420 --> 43:28.420
Portal the edible edition.

43:28.420 --> 43:29.420
Portal the edibles.

43:29.420 --> 43:30.420
Or Portal the edibles.

43:30.420 --> 43:31.420
That's it.

43:31.420 --> 43:32.420
That's it.

43:32.420 --> 43:35.420
They make a phone version and call it Port-Portal-able.

43:35.420 --> 43:37.420
Portal portable potables.

43:37.420 --> 43:40.100
Stop stealing our ideas, by the way.

43:40.100 --> 43:42.100
This is all of us.

43:42.100 --> 43:44.100
Copyright, Rob and Jamie.

43:44.100 --> 43:45.100
Patent pending.

43:45.100 --> 43:46.100
O-L-R 2021.

43:46.100 --> 43:47.100
Alright.

43:47.100 --> 43:48.100
So, yeah.

43:48.100 --> 43:49.100
Dot com.

43:49.100 --> 43:54.660
I would love to return to that universe more than Half-Life personally, but I get it.

43:54.660 --> 43:59.100
The hype for something like that would be very, very real.

43:59.100 --> 44:03.140
But I think it would still- I don't think there's gonna be an E3 this year.

44:03.140 --> 44:09.060
Or if there is, it's gonna be like a scaled down event like it was in years past where

44:09.060 --> 44:11.500
you have to show your vaccine green card or something to get in.

44:11.500 --> 44:12.500
I don't know.

44:12.500 --> 44:13.740
We're still so far off.

44:13.740 --> 44:15.140
It's hard to say where the world's gonna be at.

44:15.140 --> 44:19.760
But I still have that fantasy of Gabe Newell doing the press conference where he comes

44:19.760 --> 44:25.600
out on stage and says, Half-Life 3 out today and then drops the mic and the ceiling opens

44:25.600 --> 44:28.320
and a bunch of mics drop on the ceiling.

44:28.320 --> 44:33.040
I still have that fantasy in my mind, but I would- that would completely be an acceptable

44:33.040 --> 44:35.820
meme with Portal 3 as well.

44:35.820 --> 44:41.960
If he came out on stage and said, Portal 3 out today, boom.

44:41.960 --> 44:44.960
I would be totally alright with that.

44:44.960 --> 44:46.040
Alright.

44:46.040 --> 44:49.000
So that was our predictions for the year.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.440
We kept it short.

44:50.440 --> 44:51.840
How apropro.

44:51.840 --> 44:55.480
Anyway, we will do some new predictions next week.

44:55.480 --> 44:58.920
So y'all be thinking about that since I'm doing them virtually.

44:58.920 --> 45:02.520
We'll probably throw in a couple listener suggestions.

45:02.520 --> 45:04.360
So be on the lookout for that.

45:04.360 --> 45:08.800
Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing

45:08.800 --> 45:13.160
this week, which may overlap with our games of the year.

45:13.160 --> 45:14.160
I don't know.

45:14.160 --> 45:16.680
I have some different things I can talk about, but let's get into our gaming weeks.

45:16.680 --> 45:17.680
We'll start with Dark Sakura.

45:17.680 --> 45:18.680
How was your gaming week?

45:18.680 --> 45:20.680
I played Animal Crossing.

45:20.680 --> 45:21.680
Of course.

45:21.680 --> 45:29.120
I played, you know, some Poppin' Twinbee because I mean, it's just a fun little shooter.

45:29.120 --> 45:35.280
I mean, everyone needs to go on the Nintendo online and play Poppin' Twinbee, end of story.

45:35.280 --> 45:45.360
Also, I actually picked up Okami HD because there's like a Capcom sale going on on the

45:45.360 --> 45:51.040
Switch store or Nintendo store or whatever the crap they call it.

45:51.040 --> 45:53.640
And I don't have room to download it.

45:53.640 --> 45:58.640
We have something wrong with our card that we have on our Switch right now.

45:58.640 --> 46:04.200
But yeah, I've just been pretty much in the retro gaming mode, getting stuff setting up

46:04.200 --> 46:11.000
to finally start streaming again now that things are working out better, got a few things

46:11.000 --> 46:16.000
on Steam that I'm going to play.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.480
Looking at a few things anyway that I was going to throw onto the list.

46:18.480 --> 46:21.600
So we'll see what happens.

46:21.600 --> 46:28.040
But yeah, if anyone has a suggestion, look in my library and let me know what you think

46:28.040 --> 46:31.360
you'd want to see me play because I ain't buying anything unless you want to buy it

46:31.360 --> 46:33.360
for me.

46:33.360 --> 46:36.000
All right.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.840
There's a couple more days left on that sale.

46:39.840 --> 46:41.560
All right.

46:41.560 --> 46:42.560
Loki, how about you?

46:42.560 --> 46:44.920
How was your gaming week?

46:44.920 --> 46:49.720
It's been mainly just I was rushing to get the demo done for Pixel Poops 2.

46:49.720 --> 46:53.120
So that was the majority of the week.

46:53.120 --> 47:00.200
Aside from that, though, then I did play a bit more of Minecraft with the kids on our

47:00.200 --> 47:01.200
realms.

47:01.200 --> 47:05.680
So we were building or still are building a lighthouse.

47:05.680 --> 47:07.560
And so that's been quite the endeavor.

47:07.560 --> 47:13.840
And then Orna and yeah, that's about it.

47:13.840 --> 47:14.840
All right.

47:14.840 --> 47:16.440
My gaming week.

47:16.440 --> 47:20.600
Outside of the things I already talked about, because I talked about Pixel Poops number

47:20.600 --> 47:23.600
2 and GPS gaming is always a thing.

47:23.600 --> 47:24.880
I see a zet in chat.

47:24.880 --> 47:27.040
Shout out.

47:27.040 --> 47:30.280
And yeah, GPS gaming is always a thing, of course.

47:30.280 --> 47:34.640
But outside of those, I have now I want to know if Shane was still listening, although

47:34.640 --> 47:38.520
it looks like he may have rage quit after hearing the top games.

47:38.520 --> 47:40.120
I don't know where he has it on the background.

47:40.120 --> 47:41.120
Who knows?

47:41.120 --> 47:43.560
But I will say this to earn Shane's favor back.

47:43.560 --> 47:50.040
I will say one game I played quite a bit yesterday was I played DJ Max on Steam because I did

47:50.040 --> 47:52.120
buy it in the sale.

47:52.120 --> 47:56.560
And I invoke Shane there because he was nudging me to pick that up already.

47:56.560 --> 48:00.040
So I did buy it because I was like, I'm not going to double dip.

48:00.040 --> 48:01.320
I'm not going to double dip.

48:01.320 --> 48:02.840
But it finally went on sale.

48:02.840 --> 48:03.840
It was pretty cheap.

48:03.840 --> 48:10.880
I think I paid $24 for an edition that had the base game and two of the expansions that

48:10.880 --> 48:11.880
are new.

48:11.880 --> 48:13.960
I don't think they were on the PlayStation 4 version.

48:13.960 --> 48:15.960
They're on the PC version only.

48:15.960 --> 48:21.880
So I picked that one up and then I bought the Clasiquy pack as well, because I had to

48:21.880 --> 48:22.880
have that.

48:22.880 --> 48:27.280
I can't play DJ Max and not have Flee, okay?

48:27.280 --> 48:28.840
So there's that.

48:28.840 --> 48:30.400
So yeah, I was playing that.

48:30.400 --> 48:33.200
It's so much easier on a keyboard than it is the controller.

48:33.200 --> 48:37.400
I'm hoping I can do a live stream coming soon of the game because it's a lot of fun.

48:37.400 --> 48:41.000
Hopefully the music in that is okay.

48:41.000 --> 48:45.560
There might be the two songs that are new to PC that might be things I have to avoid,

48:45.560 --> 48:49.160
but the rest of it should be all right.

48:49.160 --> 48:52.360
So there was that.

48:52.360 --> 48:56.160
Last week on the show I talked about Tell Me Why, and I played that a little bit.

48:56.160 --> 49:01.240
I continued in Tell Me Why this week, and I did get to the end of the first chapter.

49:01.240 --> 49:04.280
So I talked about last week, I'm like, I've got to be close.

49:04.280 --> 49:06.280
And I was pretty close.

49:06.280 --> 49:12.120
I was in the last section, again, I don't want to spoil, but there's the last section

49:12.120 --> 49:15.360
that went on for quite some time, and then I was at the end.

49:15.360 --> 49:19.520
And I got to say, I think that section started to show some of the weakness of the game to

49:19.520 --> 49:25.960
me, is that some of it, the story is really good, and I'm really engaged in a lot of it.

49:25.960 --> 49:31.760
And I like the whole, the twins can kind of see each other's memories and things like

49:31.760 --> 49:32.760
that.

49:32.760 --> 49:33.760
I'm all into that.

49:33.760 --> 49:39.400
But the game in between it can sometimes get a little dryer, like I was exploring this

49:39.400 --> 49:41.680
office type area, we'll leave it at that.

49:41.680 --> 49:47.220
And there was a big puzzle to solve, which did feel rewarding, but it was very like,

49:47.220 --> 49:51.240
go here to get the thing to go here, to get the thing to go here, to get the code to go

49:51.240 --> 49:52.240
here.

49:52.240 --> 49:59.560
It was just these very basic fetch type things, and I still feel very favorably about the

49:59.560 --> 50:05.540
game overall, but I was like, okay, I see why maybe this game isn't exactly showing

50:05.540 --> 50:10.880
up on year end best list for the critics and that type of thing, is that there are some

50:10.880 --> 50:13.160
kind of dry parts in there.

50:13.160 --> 50:19.040
Honestly, when I play it, I'm like, this would be such an awesome movie.

50:19.040 --> 50:22.800
I'm kind of surprised they didn't just make an Netflix series out of it or something.

50:22.800 --> 50:24.880
It's a very compelling story.

50:24.880 --> 50:28.100
I would have loved to see like a movie, but I get why it's a game as well.

50:28.100 --> 50:29.100
So tell me why.

50:29.100 --> 50:30.880
And I'm going to keep playing more of that.

50:30.880 --> 50:34.680
Hopefully don't get too distracted because I do want to see where the story goes.

50:34.680 --> 50:38.040
Of course, the first part ends with a big twist.

50:38.040 --> 50:39.840
I won't spoil.

50:39.840 --> 50:42.480
I kind of think you see it coming.

50:42.480 --> 50:45.400
I think if you're paying attention, you see it coming.

50:45.400 --> 50:48.560
I did, but maybe not.

50:48.560 --> 50:51.520
So I'm kind of, you know, there'll probably be a big twist at the end of part two and

50:51.520 --> 50:53.280
then it'll all end with a big twist as well.

50:53.280 --> 50:55.760
But I thought it was, it was interesting.

50:55.760 --> 50:57.360
So all right.

50:57.360 --> 50:59.160
Oh, Shane finally came back.

50:59.160 --> 51:00.160
Okay, then you missed.

51:00.160 --> 51:03.800
So I will repeat once for you because it's the new year and I'm feeling generous.

51:03.800 --> 51:10.480
I had DJ Max as part of my gaming week because I finally bought it on Steam yesterday.

51:10.480 --> 51:18.360
And I was, I was hoping maybe that would help, help calm you down about the 80s thing.

51:18.360 --> 51:20.540
All right.

51:20.540 --> 51:23.840
So yeah, I played some DJ Max yesterday.

51:23.840 --> 51:26.200
What else would this week?

51:26.200 --> 51:28.840
A little bit more Destiny 2.

51:28.840 --> 51:32.160
Oh, Halo Dark Sakura.

51:32.160 --> 51:37.800
I actually, and ironically played some Halo this week with all the news last week about

51:37.800 --> 51:40.480
Halo going away.

51:40.480 --> 51:44.960
I remembered that the Master Chief collection was a thing and I wanted to download it and

51:44.960 --> 51:45.960
check it out.

51:45.960 --> 51:48.520
And so, yeah, I was playing a little bit of the story mode on that.

51:48.520 --> 51:52.480
I will say, and I just, I name checked Dark Sakura to give her a hard time.

51:52.480 --> 51:53.760
I know she doesn't care for it.

51:53.760 --> 51:54.920
That's fine.

51:54.920 --> 52:00.180
One thing I like though about the collection is that with a button press, you flip back

52:00.180 --> 52:02.780
between the old graphics and the new graphics.

52:02.780 --> 52:10.100
And it's really interesting to see what a long way it's come from just the Xbox, which

52:10.100 --> 52:14.900
was, you know, wasn't exactly a bad system or, but like, dang, when you hit that button

52:14.900 --> 52:19.100
to toggle between like original Halo graphics and the new one, it's like, wow, this game

52:19.100 --> 52:20.100
looks so much better.

52:20.100 --> 52:22.100
So this is kind of interesting.

52:22.100 --> 52:23.100
All right.

52:23.100 --> 52:26.660
So then Shane says nothing is going to calm him down.

52:26.660 --> 52:29.100
Well, deal with it, I guess.

52:29.100 --> 52:30.740
All right.

52:30.780 --> 52:35.740
Let's get into some other things real quick and then we're going to get into some gaming

52:35.740 --> 52:36.740
news.

52:36.740 --> 52:40.900
I do want to mention here at the top and I'll say it towards the end of the show as well.

52:40.900 --> 52:45.660
Awesome Games Done Quick is going this week and I know that has your attention as well.

52:45.660 --> 52:50.180
It is a fundraising event for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.

52:50.180 --> 52:51.660
I hope I got the charity right.

52:51.660 --> 52:56.140
I know it is a cancer prevention and research type of charity.

52:56.140 --> 53:00.660
And you know, I know a lot of our attention has been focused on COVID this year and understandably

53:00.660 --> 53:03.580
so, but that doesn't mean that cancer went away.

53:03.580 --> 53:04.580
We still hate it.

53:04.580 --> 53:06.020
We still say, fuck cancer.

53:06.020 --> 53:09.700
So I think this is a great cause to be raising money for.

53:09.700 --> 53:15.460
And so a lot of gamers have gotten together to put on a great display, the Olympics of

53:15.460 --> 53:19.580
speed running, if you will, in a way where they go through games very quickly.

53:19.580 --> 53:21.400
It's all in the title actually.

53:21.400 --> 53:25.660
And they raise a lot of money for charity, hopefully, hopefully another couple million

53:25.660 --> 53:29.220
dollars if the last few years have been any expectation.

53:29.220 --> 53:32.500
They are not doing it in person this year, of course.

53:32.500 --> 53:33.980
You can imagine why.

53:33.980 --> 53:37.500
It is another virtual event similar to the summer event, but that doesn't mean it's any

53:37.500 --> 53:38.500
less good.

53:38.500 --> 53:40.300
The speed runs are still very solid.

53:40.300 --> 53:45.260
The little bits that I've seen very, excuse me, engaging.

53:45.260 --> 53:48.820
And a lot of the stories from the speed runners are a lot of fun too.

53:48.820 --> 53:53.940
VOG Networks very own Bobby Blackwolf will be one of the hosts for some various speed

53:53.940 --> 53:54.940
runs.

53:54.940 --> 53:58.760
And you can check him out on Wednesday night or afternoon, depending on what time zone

53:58.760 --> 53:59.760
you're in.

53:59.760 --> 54:02.360
He'll be hosting a speed run of Devil May Cry 3.

54:02.360 --> 54:06.000
And right after that, Yakuza 6, I believe it is.

54:06.000 --> 54:10.200
And then on Friday night, this is the one I'm most looking forward to that Bobby's hosting

54:10.200 --> 54:17.660
is the Super Mario World 2 speed run, Yoshi's Island speed run that he's doing on Friday.

54:17.660 --> 54:18.920
And I love that game.

54:18.920 --> 54:20.960
So I'm very excited to see that one.

54:20.960 --> 54:23.920
And you know, touch fuzzy, get dizzy and all that.

54:23.920 --> 54:27.280
Oops, I got the games backwards, sorry.

54:27.280 --> 54:28.280
Bobby corrected me.

54:28.800 --> 54:32.560
Yoshi's Island is on Wednesday and Yakuza's on Friday.

54:32.560 --> 54:33.560
My bad.

54:33.560 --> 54:34.560
At least I got the days right.

54:34.560 --> 54:37.720
So Bobby will be there on Wednesday and Friday night.

54:37.720 --> 54:41.640
We'll be hosting it here at VOG Network when there's no other scheduled programming because

54:41.640 --> 54:44.280
we want to support the event as well.

54:44.280 --> 54:47.360
And Bobby being involved with it is pretty cool as well.

54:47.360 --> 54:50.800
Remember, if you do decide to donate though, it is not about us.

54:50.800 --> 54:52.860
It's not about Bobby.

54:52.860 --> 54:56.740
It is about the speed runner a little bit, but it's mostly about the charity.

54:56.740 --> 55:00.420
So please keep that in mind if you do decide to donate.

55:00.420 --> 55:03.540
I think that's all I have for the housekeeping.

55:03.540 --> 55:07.020
We'll mention the Game Stunt Quick thing at the end because for those that are watching

55:07.020 --> 55:11.580
live here on Twitch TV tonight, we will go host them after the show tonight.

55:11.580 --> 55:15.460
I will not be opening it up to request as I usually do.

55:15.460 --> 55:19.180
We're just going to raid Awesome Game Stunt Quick because why wouldn't we?

55:19.180 --> 55:24.260
All right, so let's get into some gaming news for our week.

55:24.260 --> 55:27.980
As slow of a week as it was, right, Loki?

55:27.980 --> 55:30.900
Loki, you are muted, just so you know.

55:30.900 --> 55:31.900
So we want to...

55:31.900 --> 55:32.900
Sorry about that.

55:32.900 --> 55:38.080
So unfortunately, this is not something that we're going to be able to enjoy right away.

55:38.080 --> 55:43.820
But of course, we've been getting more sneak peeks from the brand new theme park opened

55:43.820 --> 55:46.820
up in Japan for Super Nintendo World.

55:46.820 --> 55:54.460
And they kind of alluded to it a little bit when they did the whole thing with Miyamoto

55:54.460 --> 56:04.380
talking about these brand new power-up bands that you can get the little kind of little

56:04.380 --> 56:09.080
things you can interact with different rides and features that are there.

56:09.080 --> 56:14.860
So what's kind of cool is they mentioned that you would be able to use these with the Nintendo

56:14.860 --> 56:15.860
Switch.

56:15.900 --> 56:17.900
And apparently, we now know how that's going to happen.

56:17.900 --> 56:24.960
So for example, they sell bands that are themed after Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Daisy

56:24.960 --> 56:25.960
and whatnot.

56:25.960 --> 56:32.060
And those bands are actually going to also act as amiibos for those specific characters

56:32.060 --> 56:33.060
as well.

56:33.060 --> 56:38.620
So for example, if you take the Mario power-up band and you scan it on your Nintendo Switch,

56:38.620 --> 56:40.060
you get Mario in the game.

56:40.060 --> 56:43.120
So it'd be just like you had a Mario amiibo.

56:43.120 --> 56:46.960
So that's kind of cool, a little bit additional functionality for those.

56:46.960 --> 56:49.160
Now that's only going to work though with the Nintendo Switch.

56:49.160 --> 56:53.720
It will not work with the Wii U and 3DS, but it is still pretty cool that they're going

56:53.720 --> 56:59.720
to have these kind of NFC points throughout the park that you can use this.

56:59.720 --> 57:05.640
Also, there's been some footage leaked of the actual rides as well.

57:05.640 --> 57:10.720
So wow, I did see some POV footage of the Yoshi ride.

57:10.720 --> 57:12.480
It doesn't really show much of it.

57:12.480 --> 57:18.120
It's mostly outdoors and kind of showing some of the stuff decorated around it, but it's

57:18.120 --> 57:19.880
definitely very detailed.

57:19.880 --> 57:22.680
So hopefully we'll get some more leaks of that soon.

57:22.680 --> 57:28.480
I'm very curious to see what the Mario Kart ride looks like, but at the very least, it's

57:28.480 --> 57:29.480
cute.

57:29.480 --> 57:30.480
The Yoshi ride stuff.

57:30.480 --> 57:35.240
I hope it's better than Autotopia.

57:35.240 --> 57:41.000
It's very much like the Adventureland stuff that you would see at Disneyland, you know,

57:41.000 --> 57:47.080
just the kind of cutesy, you know, where you ride through a dark tunnel type thing and

57:47.080 --> 57:49.720
they've got like the Peter Pan ride, that type of stuff.

57:49.720 --> 57:54.800
Like the Peter Pan ride or like, you know, I'd say, yeah, it's like a dark ride basically.

57:54.800 --> 57:56.760
So it, it looked cute.

57:56.760 --> 58:00.960
I mean, um, and it won't, it won't smell like diesel, like Autotopia.

58:00.960 --> 58:01.960
Although I think they did.

58:01.960 --> 58:06.280
I think they did switch to electric a few years ago, but I, I, I still have memories

58:06.280 --> 58:07.600
of Autotopia.

58:07.600 --> 58:08.600
You walk over there.

58:08.600 --> 58:10.320
It smells like, it smells like diesel.

58:10.320 --> 58:12.360
It smells like poison.

58:12.360 --> 58:13.360
As of January.

58:13.360 --> 58:15.360
No, they have not switched to diesel.

58:15.360 --> 58:16.400
It's still all right.

58:16.400 --> 58:18.760
They haven't not switched to electric now.

58:18.760 --> 58:19.760
Okay.

58:19.760 --> 58:20.760
No, no, no, no.

58:20.760 --> 58:21.760
All right.

58:21.760 --> 58:23.980
It is very clearly running on gas.

58:23.980 --> 58:27.560
Maybe they're pumping the diesel fumes out kind of like at the pizza place.

58:27.560 --> 58:29.920
They pump the pizza fumes out and other stuff.

58:29.920 --> 58:32.320
They both got that stuff.

58:32.320 --> 58:37.720
Like I remember cause we took the monorail in, um, you know, back in January we took

58:37.720 --> 58:42.880
the monorail in one time and as it's just kind of going by all of the, uh, Autotopia

58:42.880 --> 58:45.240
stuff and it is just strong.

58:45.240 --> 58:48.320
It is just full on.

58:48.320 --> 58:49.320
I forgot.

58:49.320 --> 58:50.320
I forgot.

58:50.320 --> 58:52.320
You can say you went to Disneyland in 2020.

58:52.320 --> 58:55.560
Not a lot of people got lucky there.

58:55.560 --> 58:56.560
Yeah.

58:56.560 --> 58:57.560
So January.

58:57.560 --> 58:58.560
Yeah.

58:58.560 --> 58:59.560
Yeah.

58:59.560 --> 59:00.680
Not, not this year though.

59:00.680 --> 59:04.120
So at least I don't, we're not planning on it.

59:04.120 --> 59:07.700
But anyway, the, the band, I mean, speaking of Disney, the band sounds a lot like, like

59:07.700 --> 59:12.220
um, I think the Florida parks for Disney have like a magic band type of thing.

59:12.220 --> 59:15.900
Um, it was, I think you use it to kind of like do some entry stuff with the parks.

59:15.900 --> 59:18.460
I think fast pass is all embedded in that.

59:18.460 --> 59:22.340
Now some of you East coasters might know this system better than me cause I still have not

59:22.340 --> 59:26.360
been to a Disney world unfortunately, and it's, it's probably going to be some time

59:26.360 --> 59:27.360
off to be real.

59:27.360 --> 59:30.460
Um, and they have not brought that over to Disneyland yet.

59:30.460 --> 59:35.940
Although I would, I would imagine with the Mario, the super Nintendo world, uh, I would

59:35.980 --> 59:41.660
imagine this same system that they've got in Japan is, will absolutely be in the Hollywood

59:41.660 --> 59:45.600
version and the Orlando version as well whenever they end up launching.

59:45.600 --> 59:49.220
And it's going to be just, yeah, it's, it's a similar system to what they've got already

59:49.220 --> 59:54.860
in Harry Potter land with, you know, the whole, um, but again, not Hollywood, Hollywood didn't

59:54.860 --> 59:55.860
have it.

59:55.860 --> 59:56.860
Well, at least not when I was there.

59:56.860 --> 59:58.060
No, they have the ones though.

59:58.060 --> 01:00:00.160
So it's similar to that.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.580
It's basically different elements that we'll interact with stuff.

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:09.620
So it's, it's not F C, but that one's IR, um, but you know, it's same type of thing.

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:14.060
It's an object that interacts with stuff or the Disney, the Disney hats, uh, for world

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:16.460
of color.

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:17.460
Wasn't that a thing?

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:18.460
Yeah.

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:23.780
They have like hats that interacted with the world of color show hats or they have like,

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:27.260
it's those might be like bracelets and stuff that they have with those.

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:31.840
I think, um, Disneyland, I wouldn't be, I would be surprised if they switched to that

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:36.000
for fast pass because everything right now is done through the app and it's all scanned

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
in and everything.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.600
I would think they'd have to rebuild the whole system that that's based on.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:44.040
Um, and I know right now they have their sort of like interactive things that you can do

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.040
as well.

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:50.400
Like I know with, um, the whole star Wars stuff, they've got different things you scan

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.280
with your phone and whatnot.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.880
Um, so they sort of have something similar.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:59.280
They just went different route, um, which is fine.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.880
I mean, this looks pretty cool too.

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.680
So, you know, I'll have to check it out.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:04.680
Yeah.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:05.680
Sounds neat.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.240
I, I, I think we all could use the theme park right now.

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.400
So it's just one of those things where we're trying to look forward to it, um, in the next

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.400
year.

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:14.400
That's for sure.

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.880
Um, did anything on the bows that you said the ride leaks, was it just the Yoshi ride

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:18.880
or did anything on that?

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:19.880
Right.

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:20.880
Just the Yoshi.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:25.520
So they had like a small clip that peered on Mario Mario cart.

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:28.600
I keep thinking of the Bowser statue they have there, but yeah, right.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.600
Yeah.

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:35.320
They only showed like, there's like a very brief, like kind of video of riding outside

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.480
in the Yoshi ride.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:38.880
You can hear some of the music playing and everything.

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:42.520
They don't really show much of it inside the actual tunnel.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:46.600
Um, and it's like, it's all filmed sideways and stuff.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:51.000
You do see like, there's a link at the very end, it looks like there's Yoshi with baby

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.720
Mario and there's Kamek in there, um, and baby peach as well.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:00.200
So, I mean, it definitely looks like, you know, one of the dark rides out of Disneyland

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:06.400
or something, but, um, it's, it's not shot very well and it's all over the place, but

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:11.120
I'm sure once the park opens up for people, you know, you'll get the folks that are filming

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:12.680
the POV rides and stuff like that.

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:13.960
So you'll be able to see all that.

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:14.960
Oh yeah.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.240
That, that stuff will hit the internet the next time.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:18.240
Yeah.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:23.120
Well, I'm not too sure though about the Mario cart stuff cause that's AR.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:26.800
So that might be a little bit tougher to do, but we'll see.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.800
All right.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:33.640
Well, let's move on and talk about, uh, an undiscovered secret in a video game was discovered

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:39.700
this week and the game is near automata, admittedly a game I've got to go back and finish cause

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:45.640
I've heard lots of great things about it and a new, uh, interesting part, uh, or interesting

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:46.640
thing.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.800
I gotta be very vague here cause I don't want to spoil the game for anybody cause I know

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:52.800
it did recently come out on Xbox game pass and not everyone's gotten around to it yet.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:57.280
Um, so, um, an interesting element of the game, uh, has kind of unlocked and this has

01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.360
been secret for like three and a half years.

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:05.040
In fact, the games developers teased there was one more secret in the game that had gone

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.760
undiscovered and it was discovered.

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:13.400
So what happened is that there was a guy that kind of reverse engineers like cheat codes

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:19.320
and stuff, uh, Lance McDonald, uh, a modern, a data miner, uh, found a cheat code that

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.800
is actually programmed into the game.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:26.080
And I'm going to kind of say this in very vague, simple terms, essentially what it does,

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:31.560
it allows you to skip from the first boss fight to the end of the game directly.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:37.600
So it's like a warp ahead and I'm, I'm explaining that in very vague terms on purpose cause

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.600
I don't want to ruin the game for anybody.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:43.700
Um, but that's basically what this hidden thing does is it's basically full speed ahead

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:45.200
to the end of the game.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:52.120
Um, so, uh, the near account, uh, near Twitter account in Japan actually confirmed this is

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.120
it.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.120
This is the final secret.

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:57.680
And the games director, Yoko Taro also said, this is the final secret.

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:02.760
So, um, that secret they'd been teasing years ago, finally discovered, and it's always kind

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:07.480
of neat to hear about games, uh, having their, even if even it was found in somewhat of an

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.600
unconventional way.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:09.600
So it was a cheat code.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.800
They must've been hoping that somebody would put in a button sequence or something.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:16.920
And I wonder if maybe that button sequence wasn't hidden in other elements of the game

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:23.880
or something, but somebody used modding tricks, we'll put it plainly, uh, to instead find

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:24.880
the code.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.480
What do you think about that Loki?

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:32.320
Cause I know you do a lot with, uh, you know, hacking around in the games and doing things.

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:35.760
You think that's interesting that that's how this final secret was unveiled?

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:40.480
Um, it is interesting that they have it kind of done that way.

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:42.560
I can't remember.

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:49.320
I want to say like, I think the Stanley parable or something like that had a similar type

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:55.080
of a cheat code that you could find that, or there was something, some game, I don't

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:59.400
remember which one I'm thinking Stanley parable, but there was something where you actually

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:02.320
had to go into the game files to figure something out.

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:04.700
I think that one is to get an achievement though.

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:07.200
You have to actually modify something to get it.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:13.040
But that's kind of cool that they actually have like this cheat code built in.

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:18.380
I mean, I know a lot of people build stuff into protesting and whatnot, but, um, three,

01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:20.480
almost four years after it's been released.

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:21.480
That's pretty cool.

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:22.480
Yeah.

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.480
Pretty cool.

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:24.480
All right.

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.480
Let's move on dark Sakura.

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.480
What do you have for us tonight?

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:32.160
I have some stuff and actually it's kind of a neat stuff for people who like, uh, collecting,

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:34.800
you know, vinyl records and everything.

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:41.360
So, um, mother two, which we got as earthbound over here is having, um, a vinyl release of

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:42.360
the soundtrack.

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:48.960
Um, it is of course in Japan right now, um, that it will be, uh, released as the orders

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.360
for it are already out.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:56.560
Um, but it will include 24 songs from the game, a full track listing, um, including,

01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:03.380
um, different, uh, mixed versions of the music and, uh, for the U S or outside of Japan,

01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:05.880
you can order it from play Asia.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.980
So pretty cool stuff.

01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:13.100
Um, and it's, it's just really good soundtrack, you know, for a game.

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:15.340
So I'd say if you can grab it, grab it.

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:19.380
If you like collecting vinyl vinyl, sure.

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:23.560
One of those things that is more and more like the collectors go to thing.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:28.060
Like I feel like, you know, 10 years ago, you might have a vinyl soundtrack that's coming

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:31.900
out occasionally, but I feel like lately it's been very, very common.

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:35.460
Like it's more and more of a collectible, a thing that people pursue.

01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:36.460
Any interest in this?

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:37.460
Yeah.

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:38.460
Any interest?

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:40.600
I was just saying, any interest in this from you guys?

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:45.260
I don't want this one, but I bought the Vibrib in one, I mean, on my wall, I have a couple

01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:46.600
of weird Al albums.

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.020
He signed one of them.

01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:55.140
Um, I have my Xanadu soundtrack on vinyl, so it's like certain things, but I would really

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:56.540
dig having a record player.

01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:57.540
Yeah.

01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:01.020
Like especially one of those ones that would do it to USB.

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:02.140
Yeah.

01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:03.140
That would be awesome.

01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:04.140
That would be cool.

01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:05.140
All right.

01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:07.340
Uh, do you still have a record player, Loki?

01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:10.340
I remember when you used to mix stuff live.

01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:14.060
No, I got rid of that stuff a while ago, so I wasn't using it.

01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:16.060
So yeah, I don't.

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:17.060
All right.

01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:23.380
Uh, DJRMS in chat says, I have, uh, Scott Pilgrim versus the world, the game OST on

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:24.380
vinyl.

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:25.380
Woo.

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:26.380
All right.

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:29.380
Uh, moving on Loki.

01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:30.380
Yep.

01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:36.420
Uh, so we're waiting to hear what the new titles are that are going to be coming to

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:37.820
this year.

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:42.020
And Inti Creates, um, has been teasing some new titles.

01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:47.260
They have three titles that they say are in development, but we don't know necessarily

01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:50.340
what those titles are yet.

01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:57.100
Um, I thought I saw online that it's not blaster master, but maybe, maybe it is.

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.560
Um, we'll see.

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.060
So I don't know.

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:05.060
It's just a, we know that there's more titles in development maybe coming out this year,

01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:10.220
but don't know which classic games or maybe even new franchises that they're planning

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:11.220
on bringing out.

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:15.300
I would, I thought we got confirmation that bloodstains getting a sequel.

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:16.700
So maybe that's one of them as well.

01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:18.100
I think that is definitely one of them.

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:21.140
I do remember the blood stain getting a sequel story recently.

01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:22.140
Yeah.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:25.380
I think we talked about that like a week or two ago, so I'm sure that's probably one of

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:26.380
them.

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:31.980
Um, a blaster master three, that would be like a blaster master zero part three.

01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:35.780
That would be interesting, especially because it would be, it was interesting that it was

01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:37.820
inspired from that, you know, original NES game.

01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:40.880
And then they, it kind of got a sequel that was just its own thing.

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:45.340
It was independent of any, uh, you know, like the Genesis game or anything else before it,

01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:47.140
it was kind of its own own universe.

01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:49.980
So that would be cool to see a faster's quest zero.

01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:57.100
I honestly, the things I would do and the nasty things I would, I would do that I'm

01:08:57.100 --> 01:09:02.580
not going to say on air for them to have gotten somehow the license to reboot the guardian

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:07.980
legend because they did a really good job of blaster master, honestly.

01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:11.780
And I feel like if I'm going to play a game like the guardian legend, which is like holy

01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:16.180
text to me, and I know it's, it's near and dear to dark soccer's heart as well.

01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:18.660
There's only so many companies I would trust with that.

01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:23.460
And, and that, that would be one of them based on what they do with blaster master for sure.

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:24.460
So yeah.

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:30.860
Uh, let's see, um, oh, they're still talking about vinyl in the chat.

01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:33.740
She Hulk is saying, I have Pac-Man fever on vinyl.

01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:40.180
I remember when they used to play that at the roller rink, dated myself a little bit.

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.820
All right.

01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:43.820
Let's move on.

01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:45.980
Uh, let's talk about Stardew Valley.

01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:46.980
Still going.

01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:52.980
Been around for a couple of years and is about to get a pretty major update 1.5.

01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:55.820
So there was a update that came out on PC.

01:09:55.820 --> 01:10:00.220
So this already came out on PC, but we're going to talk a little bit about the consoles.

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:03.700
So the patch was something that just get, they didn't really hype it up or anything.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:06.300
It was kind of surprise dropped.

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:11.820
Everybody else is supposed to be getting it in January at the end of the month is the

01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:12.820
current timeframe.

01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:16.600
It's not like this week, but maybe in three weeks.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:20.560
So update 1.5 is supposed to be ready by the end of January, but they're not going

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:21.760
to guarantee that.

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:27.180
Uh, I'm sure with everything that's going on right now, uh, they're also bare out bare

01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:28.180
own.

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:29.180
I hope I said that name right.

01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:33.080
Who, who puts together the game, uh, is kind of talking about the development process,

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:38.640
talking about that there is a small team that works with them on the updates saying really

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:39.640
small.

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:43.640
Uh, 1.5 was apparently two people that actually put that together.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:44.640
So interesting.

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:51.400
Uh, this will also have, um, additional bug fixes that were not present when the PC released,

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:58.320
uh, already what was in this patch, some new people, new goals, new items, a new quest

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:04.440
type, a new farm layout, new character events, community upgrade, home renovations, ducks

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:05.680
that swim.

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:08.080
Yes, that is one of the bull points.

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:09.080
Swimming ducks.

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:10.080
That's right.

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.080
Swimming ducks.

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:13.040
Uh, you can sit in chairs, you can move your bed.

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:18.680
There are fish tanks, new furniture items, new secrets, and nine new music tracks.

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:21.160
And they say there is more that they don't want to spoil.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.840
So it is very major update.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.440
And I know this is a huge game on the switch.

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:29.360
Um, so I'm sure there's a lot, in fact, I know, I know people that play it on the switch

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:33.840
and really like, but before animal crossing came out, Stardew Valley was kind of like

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:36.160
a game to hold them over, I think for many people.

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:39.760
So, um, I know a lot of people will be looking forward to the console release of this for

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.840
sure.

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:43.880
So we'll see when it arrives.

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:45.280
Let's move on to other classics.

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:46.280
Stark, Sakura.

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:52.800
This is also a very cool, and actually I showed it to Dan when I found this and he was like,

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.080
wow, that's pretty cool.

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:59.840
So, um, in Nintendo 64, you know, pretty, you know, I I'd say it's actually kind of

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:03.040
a divisive system because not everyone was a big fan.

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:06.160
You know, there was the cartridge base, everything.

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:13.600
However, um, a modder who goes by the name Gunner reconstructed his Nintendo 64 with

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:19.200
some parts from a few other consoles and things like that, and made a portable version.

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:27.760
Um, basically, uh, he goes by G-man mods with a Z, um, was, he was able to make a functioning

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:34.200
Nintendo 64 that is just barely larger than the cartridges themselves.

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.240
It's pretty interesting.

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:43.200
It looks like he took a few, uh, cues, uh, in, uh, configuration from, uh, the switch

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:47.760
just in where the, you know, the, the other triggers are located.

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:56.800
Um, and, uh, he says though, that it does have, uh, some flaws that he calls the gaming

01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:02.280
experience a subpar, um, and that it could actually be really uncomfortable to hold.

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:08.480
It has short battery life, but the purpose was to make the world's smallest Nintendo

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:09.480
64.

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:17.480
Um, it makes me think though, that if it was possible for him to do a handheld version

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:27.120
of this, then I don't see why we can't have maybe someplace like analog do a N64 that

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:32.700
could be handheld and then perhaps plugged in, uh, for TV play.

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.520
It just makes me think that it would be possible.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:39.080
Oh, wait, it'd be possible with no one ever buy it and it'd be, or no one would be ever

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:40.080
able to buy it.

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:45.200
And it would be way too expensive because that's how all of their consoles are.

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:49.600
Like I would love an NT mini, but I'm not paying $800 for an NES.

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:50.600
I'm sorry.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:51.600
I'm getting a duo.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:52.600
Yeah.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:56.920
And in chat, Bobby is expressing, please not analog until they can figure out supply.

01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:00.920
Uh, sacred Jade saying waiting on analog to develop and ship something is eternity.

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:01.920
All right.

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:04.040
So maybe I maybe accompany them as an example.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.040
Yeah.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.040
Yeah.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:07.040
I get it.

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.040
Like do a lot.

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:13.560
But I wish they were in stock and not that expensive, but what, what, what an authentic

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:16.760
Nintendo experience.

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:19.360
It is very authentic in that sense.

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:20.360
Yes.

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.560
Anyway, I get what you mean dark soccer.

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:29.240
Um, and yeah, it, you know, uh, especially with the patent on the hardware has to be

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:32.680
expiring soon if it hasn't already expired.

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:33.680
Right.

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:34.680
That system came out like 96.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:35.680
Right.

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:39.120
And what's, what's the timeframe on that 25 years maybe.

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:40.120
I think so.

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:44.320
Cause we see the, the NES is and the SNES is out there that, you know, play all the

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:49.740
old games that you can buy pretty openly now because I think the, the patents on the hardware

01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:51.720
and all that kind of run out at some point.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:57.440
So it would be about that time where a Nintendo 64 and PlayStation honestly, uh, would, would

01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:58.440
be having that as well.

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:02.360
So that's going to be interesting to see where those kind of homebrew consoles go, especially

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:03.720
when it comes to minis.

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:08.440
I think a lot of people surprised Nintendo did not do their own N64 mini and went a different

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:11.280
route instead with the whole game and watch thing this last year.

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:20.200
So pixel pockets and chat says there are portable gaming devices that run up to PS one and N

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:25.480
64 emulation, but it is emulation and not actual hardware of course, but those are pretty

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:27.640
cheap and decent quality.

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:31.640
So and yeah, some of the things that do Nintendo and Super Nintendo also kind of run through

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:37.200
emulation, uh, sometimes to try to improve the lag and all that stuff for HTMI output

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.200
and all that good stuff.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:39.200
So yeah.

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.200
All right.

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:46.240
Well, we'll see, we'll see if, uh, maybe we can, uh, make these things a mass produced

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:47.240
reality someday.

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:48.240
Who knows?

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:49.240
Anyhow, let's move on.

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:50.280
Loki.

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:51.280
All right.

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:57.280
Um, so let's talk a little bit about, uh, a story that seems to keep coming up every

01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:03.080
once in a while about Nintendo going after this company in Japan that keeps, uh, renting

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:10.240
out these go-karts and costumes like, uh, Mario characters to kind of do your own like

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:13.000
Mario Kart tour of Japan.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.320
Um, and finally though, I believe it is over.

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:25.960
Um, they have, uh, sealed their victory and I guess have been the company Mari car because

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:32.040
they thought that they can change their name and get away with that, um, has been now ordered

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:35.320
to pay the tune of, uh, 10 million yen.

01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:42.580
So almost a hundred thousand dollars to Nintendo for unauthorized use of its IPs and safety

01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:47.000
concerns, which obviously if you're driving a go-kart in traffic, there could be a problem

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000
there.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:55.940
Um, also, um, so that, that was the original, uh, settling back in 2017.

01:16:55.940 --> 01:17:02.600
So then they went to court again because they changed their name to street cart and said

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:07.800
that they were unrelated to Nintendo stickers on all over the cards, but then they got charged

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:10.640
an even larger fine of 50 million yen.

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:17.160
Um, and then finally, you know, now they are going to have to pay that.

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:21.600
And it sounds like that the street cart company is actually having trouble staying afloat

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:24.560
being that, you know, there's a pandemic going on.

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:30.100
So, um, yeah, it's interesting to see that going, but I mean, what did they really think

01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:31.100
was going to happen?

01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:35.660
I mean, especially, you know, to tie it back to something you were talking about earlier,

01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:39.660
you know, now that we know, I think when this all started first going down, we knew that

01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:42.720
there was a Nintendo world coming to, to universal.

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:44.780
We didn't know the details of what would be in it.

01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:48.980
And now we know, I mean, we speculated there's probably a Mario Kart thing that's going to

01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:49.980
be in it.

01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:50.980
Now we know for sure.

01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:51.980
Yes.

01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:55.260
The flagship, you know, e-ticket ride, if you will, is a Mario Kart ride.

01:17:55.260 --> 01:18:00.420
And so, um, of course they want this experience gone because they don't want to create confusion

01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:07.540
with the park and, uh, yeah, slapping a sticker on there saying not Nintendo isn't exactly

01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:08.540
enough.

01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:09.540
No.

01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:10.540
So.

01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:11.540
Yeah.

01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:16.860
So it definitely, definitely, um, not surprised to see it go this way.

01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:18.060
Yeah, not at all.

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:22.140
So, um, it'll be interesting to see if they bring the concept back with something else

01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:27.300
completely unrelated to Nintendo, but, uh, this money, this fine they owe probably going

01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:28.300
to put them out of business.

01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:30.620
And especially, I'm sure the pandemic isn't helping.

01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:34.420
I don't think things, I think, I think things are a little different over in Japan, but

01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:39.780
I, I think, uh, I don't think you have like the, the crowded, busy streets and bustling

01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:44.500
activity, uh, that you're used to seeing throughout all this, uh, pandemic stuff going on, you

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:45.500
know?

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.980
So maybe, maybe later this year, like we're all hoping for everywhere else.

01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:48.980
Yeah.

01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:49.980
We'll see.

01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:50.980
All right.

01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:55.260
Well, one more before we get to the classic game of the week, which is not this game,

01:18:55.260 --> 01:19:00.780
but I thought we could talk about a classic anyway, because Gradius three is going to

01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:06.860
be coming to the PlayStation four and the switch as the latest arcade archives release,

01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:12.700
uh, Gradius three from 1989, uh, which is, you know, it's a, there, there is a story

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:17.180
you go against the bacteria on empire, uh, it, it's a Gradius game.

01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:19.220
It looks like a lot of the other Gradius games.

01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:23.640
I remember playing this, do you remember on the PSP, there was a Gradius collection that

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:24.640
had them all on it.

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:27.440
I remember playing this on there, uh, and this is good.

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:32.080
This is the one that has the big, if I is the fire plume levels in it, or was that also

01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:35.100
in two, two had that as well.

01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:39.220
It looks the, the fire plumes look different in three, it has a very different look to

01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:40.220
it.

01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:44.360
Um, I don't know how, how do you define Gradius three different than the other two dark soccer?

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:47.960
I'm not sure there's an easy way to do that.

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:49.720
The end, they're all Gradius, you know?

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:50.720
Yeah, exactly.

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:55.720
Uh, anyway, Gradius three includes a bonus stage from an alternate perspective and hidden

01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:58.360
stages with the series past.

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:04.880
So that is all available this week, um, for about eight bucks on the arcade archives,

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:08.840
which is still going, there's over a hundred games that have been released with that.

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:12.840
You know, I totally forgot to mention during my gaming week, speaking of like retro collection

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:18.000
things, I finally played some of that Sega ages stuff I bought on switch.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.160
I actually spent a bit of time playing fantasy zone, uh, the Sega ages version of that because

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.760
you know, that's a, that's, that's a cute little shooter.

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:29.720
It's the greatest version of that game, but it's really, I love fantasy zone.

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:36.920
It is, it is straight up defender, but they get ages, which say you get ages ones, the,

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:39.960
the Sega ages 20, they didn't do the 2,500 version on that.

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:40.960
Did they?

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:41.960
I don't think so.

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:42.960
No, this is the original.

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:43.960
Okay.

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:44.960
Nevermind.

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:45.960
I'm just confusing it with the 2,500.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:46.960
Yeah, no worries.

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.200
So, um, but it was fun.

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:49.200
Yeah.

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:50.200
I played a little bit of that.

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:53.840
Fantasy star and Alex Kidd, because those are all the games that I bought when the,

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:57.040
cause there was a big sale on all that stuff a couple of weeks ago on the switch.

01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:58.320
So I, I picked up a bunch of them.

01:20:58.320 --> 01:20:59.320
So sorry.

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:03.240
That just kind of sparked that to mind since we were talking about retro stuff that's available

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:09.000
on the switch, even if there's no virtual console per se, I mean, sure there's the,

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.580
you know, Nintendo online library and stuff, but I think you're seeing more and more companies

01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:14.560
that are kind of just doing their own types of releases.

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:20.800
If I'm not mistaken, Square Enix just did the, um, they did another collection that

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:23.560
just came out on, um, the switch.

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:26.600
Was it final fantasy legend that just came out?

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:30.280
There's like a collection of those old game boy games that just came out on switch as

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:31.280
well.

01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:33.000
So, all right.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:38.160
Well, speaking of classics, let's take a trip down memory lane with the classic game of

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:40.000
the week.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.040
Every week, dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and she finds a game that she thinks,

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:49.040
Hey, you guys, you know, you need to, you need to put down your 2020 games.

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:53.040
Nothing good came out this year anyway, besides animal crossing and you need to check out

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:54.040
this game instead.

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:59.480
Although I got to say before we get to this week's game, cause you picked quite the game

01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:00.480
for this week.

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:03.000
Um, I had to start it off with something major.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:09.920
You had to start off 2021 this, this is, I just have to put the whole, like, this is

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:15.660
not a game that holds up well to what is considered, uh, okay in 2020.

01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:19.200
Like this, this game, this game's got some problematic stuff.

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:20.200
It's it's different time.

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:24.280
So I want to, I want to make that very clear cause I'm about to play footage from the game

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:30.120
and it might be a little bit like, yikes, but I want to find my other, my other link

01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:31.120
about it.

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.120
Oh, I'll have to find it.

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:37.640
But we're going to talk about this game for the purposes of commentary and where the hell

01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:43.200
did a game like this come from and how did it get the notoriety that it did.

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:46.080
So I, I, I felt this one needed a disclaimer.

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:47.080
So there you go.

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:49.080
Absolutely needs a disclaimer.

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:54.040
Um, I had a feeling that you would, uh, that you would, uh, say something.

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:55.040
Well there you go.

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:56.320
So there's your disclaimer.

01:22:56.320 --> 01:23:03.600
It's a, it is a, it is a choice that's going to make you guys go, Oh, okay.

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:06.240
So, uh, get to the game, dark saga, please.

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.240
All right.

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:10.880
So the game is Boonga Boonga.

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:11.880
Perfect.

01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:14.000
Oh, and the movie didn't even play.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000
I didn't have it loaded right.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.920
Let me fix that real quick and then you'll get that.

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:18.920
All right.

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:27.080
So I picked Boonga Boonga and, um, it was also known as Spank Em.

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:34.960
It was, uh, an arcade game only, thank God, um, that was developed by a South Korean company

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:37.760
called TAF systems.

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:44.000
And it is the first, and I hope that the only arcade game that simulates something called

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:50.440
Concho, which is a prank where you are poked with two fingers in the butt while you're

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:51.440
distracted.

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:55.040
So yes, it is a Concho game.

01:23:55.040 --> 01:24:02.000
Um, it, uh, it really became, um, by the way, it came out in 2001.

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:09.640
Uh, it really became kind of like a meme when there was a really badly translated, uh, flyer

01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:17.040
that went out that showed the banking and the Concho, uh, gameplay.

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:22.640
And um, the game was designed for the Japanese market, according to advertising material

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:27.680
that was actually well received at the 2000 Tokyo game show.

01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:35.560
Um, they, the contract was for 200 units, only five were, were distributed.

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:43.880
Um, and now we're going to get into the, uh, the problematic nature of this.

01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:48.600
So, and let me go ahead and do a little bit of description of what the cabinet looks like

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:51.080
because all we have up, I think is the video, right?

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:52.080
Yes.

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.800
And the podcast, you just can't even see that.

01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:54.920
All right.

01:24:54.960 --> 01:25:03.840
So the, the cabinet is, uh, you've got two aspects of it, kind of like, uh, two thirds

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:10.440
of it has the monitor and the controller and the right hand side has a thing for prizes.

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:17.880
So your controller is a huge, but a gene clad, but I think it is, or slacks or something,

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:24.880
but it is a huge butt and it, uh, you use that.

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:30.720
You actually have a plastic finger controller as well that you use to stick in the butt.

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:35.720
Um, so you have different characters that you can punish.

01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:41.440
You have the ex-girlfriend, the ex-boyfriend, uh, Yakuza, uh, the mother-in-law, the gold

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:47.120
digger, the prostitute, the child molester, and the con artist and their facial expression

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:49.360
shows on the monitor.

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:52.720
Um, we'll, we'll get to that a little bit later.

01:25:52.720 --> 01:26:00.480
So, um, you get different cards that rate you on your quote, sexual behavior.

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:06.440
And if you perform exceptionally, you get a small plastic trophy that looks like poop.

01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:08.720
So that is the game.

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:11.280
That right there is the game.

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:15.160
And people are looking at this footage and it's, it's almost hard to watch because it's

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:19.200
just so like the expressions they make are, they're not of God, Jamie.

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.680
They're not of God.

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:23.600
They're completely unnatural.

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:33.280
So here is the problem is that, um, first of all, I mean, I honestly think that I don't

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:35.200
know how Concho came about.

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:38.800
I've always found that to be a disturbing prank.

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:45.560
I mean, honestly, I think I would rather get, um, you know, have someone be pantsed then

01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:48.400
or wedgie then no Concho, but Hey.

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:54.080
Um, but anyway, uh, and yes, I know fifth James school kids do it to people.

01:26:54.080 --> 01:27:00.680
Um, Concho is existed like for an age and it's in all kinds of TV and you name it.

01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:04.720
I don't think there's anyone over here who's not familiar with the concept.

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:06.720
And a lot of kids are assholes.

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:10.760
Like a lot of kids are assholes and they like to apparently play with assholes.

01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:13.240
So anyway, anyway.

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:23.720
Um, so basically with this game though, here's what gets to be super problematic about it.

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:36.800
And by the way, uh, the way that it, um, it's really terrible is that, um, like there's

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:44.600
a whole mode in there that, you know, by punishing a mother-in-law or an ex-girlfriend

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:53.880
or something, there's a lot of just misogyny in there, you know, um, like, for example,

01:27:53.880 --> 01:28:03.800
I mean, like most of the characters in there, from what I understand are female and it really

01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:08.600
is just like, it's just really problematic.

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:16.080
Um, but in other things too, is like the, the fact that it depends on how you perform,

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:21.040
like if you do it too soft or too hard, they're going to mock you.

01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:26.440
And there were, and like I said, there were only five of these that actually were released.

01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:33.040
So thank God it didn't get more widespread, but it's still just like, it's creepy, you

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:34.040
know?

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:38.840
And on top of that, I mean, something like this definitely would get like the million

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:41.480
moms, you know, losing their shit about it.

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:44.360
And this time they would actually be losing their shit over something worth losing their

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:45.360
shit over.

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:46.840
This game simply couldn't release today.

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:47.840
It just can't.

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:52.600
Like it's not, it is definitely one of those things where, and I think this might beg the

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:53.600
question.

01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:56.560
So, so why a classic game of the week then?

01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:00.060
Well, number one, not every classic game that's ever been picked as a good game.

01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:03.500
And sometimes it's about kind of like learning this new, new world.

01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:04.500
You sure did.

01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:07.820
And, and sometimes it's about learning from where we've been.

01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:10.820
And this game is also one of the, in many ways, I think it's kind of like a game of

01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:12.380
urban legends.

01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:18.380
Like we heard about this game and did, and didn't believe that it actually existed.

01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:22.220
And it does anyway, the, the B roll is finally running out and I don't really want to watch

01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:23.220
it anymore.

01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:24.220
So I'm just coming back to us.

01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:25.220
Yeah.

01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:26.220
Just leave it there.

01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:34.260
And that was kind of the whole reason why I do the classic game of the week is to outline

01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:42.100
things that do exist or have existed or almost existed or has a big impact on the gaming

01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:43.220
world.

01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:48.460
And this was a meme for an age, an early internet.

01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:54.060
I mean, I would even say that this going around the internet, people, people were talking

01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:57.380
about it for like a couple of years, you know?

01:29:57.380 --> 01:30:05.220
So this one, uh, I picked it because of its notoriety and the impact it had on gaming

01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:06.220
culture.

01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:07.220
Interesting.

01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:12.220
Interesting that you do a meme-tastic game the week that flash died, which was the source

01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:13.700
of all of our memes.

01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:15.500
Bobby got into this on his show a little bit.

01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:18.580
No, I think it's, I think it's a funny tie-in in a way.

01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:20.620
I wasn't really saying oops.

01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:21.620
Oh.

01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:27.780
I mean, like, I could also do like the lobster catching game, submarine catcher.

01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:28.780
It's it's fine.

01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:29.980
You remember that one, don't you?

01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:31.980
Um, I don't think so.

01:30:31.980 --> 01:30:32.980
Yeah.

01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:37.580
I mean, it's up there with like the table flipping game and we need the table flipping

01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:38.580
game now.

01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:40.180
I don't know if the table flipping game is 10 years old yet.

01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:41.180
Well, it's gotta be.

01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:42.180
I don't think so.

01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:48.460
It's, it's, but there's also like, but I mean the other like weird one I would have chosen

01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:50.060
would have been like submarine catcher.

01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:51.820
I just have to see how old it is.

01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:57.660
The table flipping game is actually 10 years old, January 22nd, 2010.

01:30:57.660 --> 01:30:58.660
Ooh.

01:30:58.660 --> 01:30:59.660
Okay.

01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:00.660
So pretty, pretty close.

01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:02.620
It is 11 years old eligible.

01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:03.620
All right.

01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:04.620
Good to know.

01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:05.620
Good to know.

01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:07.620
See, we'll see.

01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:10.660
Maybe I'll, maybe I'll do like a classic arcade only.

01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:14.260
Um, and you, I think you're okay with me bringing it up here.

01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:18.980
We're still trying to figure out what the theme might be for your special picks in 2021,

01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:20.220
if any.

01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:22.740
Maybe this will just be a year with nothing special.

01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:26.020
We can highlight the record, but she shot her.

01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:28.180
No, I'm not going to do a package slide.

01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:29.180
No.

01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:30.180
Did you run my SS table flipping game?

01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:31.180
Was it magfest?

01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:36.580
Uh, table flipping game is in, uh, a lot of content to mall in San Francisco.

01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:37.580
Yeah.

01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:40.100
A lot of, uh, yeah, there's, it's at the mall in San Francisco and I want to say, don't

01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:42.020
they get one in California extreme too.

01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:46.420
And there's usually, there's a couple of those that travel around to the different conventions,

01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:52.700
but wasn't magfest the one, um, that it didn't just have the table flipping game, but they

01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:56.740
had the whole thing where you could donate like $50 to charity or something and you could

01:31:56.740 --> 01:32:00.300
actually flip a table that they would set up with everything.

01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:02.700
Like they had a group of volunteers that would set the table.

01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:05.220
You pay 50 bucks and you can actually flip a real day.

01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:06.220
Bobby says yes.

01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:07.220
Okay.

01:32:07.220 --> 01:32:08.220
That's what I thought.

01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:09.220
That was the thing.

01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:11.620
There's like also like another game along those lines, which is like the, the tablecloth

01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:12.880
pulling game.

01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:13.880
There's one like that.

01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:20.600
There were some different games that were along those lines, but, um, but we'll, we'll,

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:21.600
we'll see.

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:26.120
Cause I'm, I would love to just highlight different weird arcade games.

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:27.120
Okay.

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:32.080
So this segment is the weird arcade game of the month.

01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:35.820
That's it officially the fucking weird arcade game of the month.

01:32:35.820 --> 01:32:36.820
Weird arcade game of the month.

01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:37.820
All right.

01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:43.080
No, the fucking weird arcade.

01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:46.760
You think you can think of 12 to get us, get us through the year?

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.640
Oh, who are you talking to?

01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:49.640
All right.

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:50.640
All right.

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:51.640
So there it is.

01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:53.800
Your weird fucking arcade game of the month.

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:55.040
No fucking weird.

01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:56.040
Sorry.

01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:57.520
Fucking weird arcade game.

01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:58.520
Wait.

01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:01.400
So it has been said, I'm sorry.

01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:05.520
You just picked the acronym flag flag.

01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:09.480
It's the flag flag of the month.

01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:10.480
I mean, come on.

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:14.360
This is from the same person who said that our first tournament was going to be called

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:15.360
scat.

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:18.640
At least you didn't do the fucking arcade game of the week or the month.

01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:19.920
That's glad you did.

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:20.920
Didn't do that.

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:21.920
All right.

01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:25.880
Uh, the fucking weird arcade game of the month.

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:26.880
All right.

01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:27.880
Perfect.

01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:28.880
Yeah.

01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:29.880
The flag.

01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:30.880
Tweaky flag.

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:33.320
And I can't think of anything weirder than Oonga boot.

01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:37.800
Is it boonga boonga boonga boonga boonga boonga.

01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:38.800
All right.

01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:39.800
Or spank them.

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:41.120
All right.

01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:44.120
Dark Tetsuya go update the Wiki.

01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:50.440
All right, let's get to some rapid fire news because honestly, that's all we have left

01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:51.440
for tonight.

01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:52.440
Really.

01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:54.520
We're going to do some rapid fire news and some release dates, and then we're going to

01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:55.520
get to the round table.

01:33:55.520 --> 01:34:00.720
Uh, it's a little shorter tonight just because of this week hasn't had as much going on,

01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:04.320
but it gives us a little more time to go check out AGDQ or check out the demo for Loki's

01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:07.240
game or whatever else in gaming is going on for you.

01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:10.000
So let's travel and look at some rapid fire news pretty quick.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.720
And by the way, I'm still going to see if it works on a never drive.

01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:13.720
So stay tuned.

01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:14.720
It does.

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:18.480
If you do an update to it, I get apparently, but like I don't have anything to test on.

01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:20.680
So I can't really say.

01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:21.680
We can test it.

01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:23.680
I told, I told hubs.

01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:24.680
Nice.

01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:25.680
All right.

01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:30.360
Well, eventually it'll be on a cartridge anyway, so I mean, no problem there.

01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:36.280
Um, so PlayStation plus, we've got our lineup of games coming out in January, starting off

01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:41.480
with man eater on PlayStation five and then for PlayStation four shadow of the tomb Raider

01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:43.720
and greed fall.

01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:52.440
And then we got the inklings that respawn is working on a brand new franchise or a new

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:54.320
IP.

01:34:54.320 --> 01:35:00.720
And um, we know that because they have a job listing that says, join a small team being

01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:03.260
formed to develop a brand new IP.

01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:05.720
So does it get more direct than that?

01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:06.840
What that AP is?

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:07.840
Who knows?

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:11.440
We'll find out, I guess eventually, but it is happening.

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:13.360
That's it.

01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:14.880
All right.

01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:19.800
Uh, let's talk about the worst games of 2020 per Metacritic.

01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:22.040
Now I don't know how much stock y'all put Metacritic.

01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:26.140
I don't put a lot in it, but it is interesting to see what, you know, some of their number

01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:27.640
crunching does.

01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:34.520
So the 10 worst games, according to Metacritic number 10 is the elder scrolls blades on the

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:40.200
switch and that's the one that I've played and I'm like, is it, I get why people don't

01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:41.200
like it.

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:42.200
It does.

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:48.840
It does dumb down the elder scrolls formula a little bit too much and yeah, I mean it's

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:53.880
probably not totally worth your time, but I don't, I didn't like hate it, but it definitely

01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:58.360
is not, it does not have the depth of an actual elder scrolls game and I think people kind

01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:00.280
of see right through that.

01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:03.520
These others, I haven't played any of these others that are on the list.

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:09.640
With an average score of 42, the ninth worst game was gleam light for the switch.

01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:15.280
With an average score of 41 street power soccer for the PlayStation four was number eight

01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:20.760
with an average score of 40 tamarin on the PlayStation four was the seventh worst game

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:21.760
of the year.

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:30.920
A number, uh, sorry, a score of 39 remothered broken porcelain for the PC was a two broken

01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:32.600
and buggy for this year.

01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:39.440
Uh, number five was arc of alchemist for the switch, uh, people complaining about its dated

01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:42.140
graphics and not great story.

01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:45.960
Number four, the fourth worst game of the year with an average score of 34 for the PC

01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:48.800
fast and furious crossroads.

01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:54.360
Yes, to be confused with the fast and furious movie because it was a tie into that game.

01:36:54.360 --> 01:37:00.560
Uh, the third worst game of the year on the PlayStation four dawn of fear, the second

01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:03.400
worst game of the year, oops, I accidentally went ahead here.

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:09.680
The second worst game of the year, the 13 remake X I I I is kind of how it stylized

01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:10.680
with the Roman numerals.

01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:16.880
Uh, the remake of 13 for the Xbox one because it was bugs, bugs, bugs, and the developer

01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:21.100
actually put out an apology average score of 32.

01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:28.080
So what was worse than that with an average score of 29 the worst game of 2020 is tiny

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:30.200
racer for the switch.

01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:36.500
A $10 racing game where you take miniature cars through kitchens and forests and apparently

01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:44.160
the game play stinks and that is the worst game of 2020 according to Metacritic again,

01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:46.320
however you feel about that.

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:51.680
That's kind of subjective I think because like, I don't know, like I think some of those

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:56.280
games aren't at so bad on there, but like there's some like shadow of the Ronin revenge

01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:59.520
of the samurai that didn't make the list, which really should.

01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:02.560
If you've ever played that game, which I hope you haven't.

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:08.200
It's a real PlayStation four game and it's, it's really awful.

01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:15.040
Um, and there's the guy that makes these games basically does, it's just this giant empty

01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:20.320
void of nothing that you run around forever and then you fight one monster, they'll immediately

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:21.840
kill you and that's it.

01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:27.440
And um, yeah, I'm surprised that that didn't make the list.

01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:31.040
I guess no one's played it, so no one's reviewed it.

01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:37.280
And again, I completely understand if you do not want to put all of your stock in Metacritic,

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:41.160
but you know, since we addressed earlier in the show, I had that question from No One

01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:44.360
Special last week where it was like, what is the worst game of the year?

01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:45.360
I don't know.

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:48.660
I wanted to kind of throw something in here where it's like, but here's what other people

01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:50.360
are saying.

01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:54.480
So and why I'm kind of like, I don't know if Elder Scrolls Blades is the worst thing

01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:58.800
I've played this year, but I guess it wasn't great, but yeah.

01:38:58.800 --> 01:38:59.800
All right.

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:01.360
Anyway, let's move on.

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:04.840
Dark Sakura has one more, I think for us, a rapid fire story.

01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:14.240
Um, the Doom account celebrated 2021 with something that there, it was a thing for a

01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:15.240
while.

01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:24.760
Um, but it is a picture of Doom Guy and Isabelle, their, uh, nendoroid, uh, uh, figures skipping

01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:32.360
along hand in hand amongst some potted plants with the name Happy New Horizons.

01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:35.440
So the meme will not die in 2021.

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:36.960
The name will not, the meme will not die.

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:38.480
They are the best of friends.

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:42.040
I hope Doom Guy becomes a, uh, they should just do like, you know, when they have the

01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:45.000
next smash announcement of the people that are being added to it.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:49.800
Just have a two for have, you know, Isabelle and Doom Guy in there.

01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:50.800
Yeah.

01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:52.800
Isabelle's in there, but it would be great.

01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:53.800
Yeah.

01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:54.800
Isabelle's character already.

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:55.800
Okay.

01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:56.800
Oh yeah.

01:39:56.800 --> 01:39:57.800
Yeah.

01:39:57.800 --> 01:39:58.800
Her little intro was adorable too.

01:39:58.800 --> 01:39:59.800
Yeah.

01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:01.160
She's she was Doom Guy in there.

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:02.160
Yeah.

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:05.000
Doom Guy would actually be kind of a neat addition.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.080
And I think these memes only play into it a little more.

01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:12.360
Um, I don't know if Doom Guy is necessarily a Nintendo thing, but let's be real.

01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:14.760
We're getting to the point where there's a lot of characters in there that I don't

01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:17.120
always associate with Nintendo platforms.

01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:18.120
So why not?

01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:21.040
I think it'd be funny if Doom Guy got in there.

01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:22.440
All right.

01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:26.040
Let's travel around the world and check out what games are coming out this week.

01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:28.960
I don't know if we have a lot, but I'll check.

01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:29.960
We do it every week.

01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:32.880
Loki, do we have any games coming out this week in the US?

01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:37.840
There's not a lot, but there are a couple, so we have werewolf, the apocalypse heart

01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:40.640
of the forest on Nintendo switch.

01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:46.440
And then we've Iris fall, uh, which is in the switch PlayStation four and X-Box one.

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:47.660
That's it.

01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:50.080
My Japanese releases are empty.

01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:53.040
I do not have anything this week in Japan, dark soccer.

01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:55.040
What about the UK?

01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:56.040
Equally empty.

01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:57.040
Yeah.

01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:59.400
It's quite weak, but we always check in.

01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:00.400
So at least there's a cut.

01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:02.600
There's like two games Loki named here in the US.

01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:03.600
There is that.

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:04.600
Yeah.

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:05.600
All right.

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:08.600
Um, I am going to open up the round table.

01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:12.560
If you guys have any questions in chat and anything you want to ask us, uh, now is a

01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:14.480
great time, uh, to put that in.

01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:17.040
I also don't know if we have any main emails tonight.

01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:18.040
Did we dark?

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:19.040
We have one.

01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:20.040
Oh, we have one.

01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:21.040
Okay.

01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:23.240
Before you read it, I did, I guess I already mentioned this in the show, but I had it here

01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:24.480
as a placeholder, so I wouldn't forget.

01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:26.000
And I'll mention it again.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.920
Awesome games done quick is this week.

01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:29.920
And for those of you that are watching on Twitch, stay tuned.

01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:33.520
Um, after we're done here at OLR, we'll be going to raid that presentation.

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:38.880
Um, and I, I think we'll be hosting that pretty much on VOG throughout the entire week.

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:44.120
Um, so if you want to chat about it with other folks, uh, and, and, and possibly I'll probably

01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:47.280
be in there when Bobby's doing the hosting stuff, cause you know, our comments kind of

01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:48.920
get lost in the big chat.

01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:50.980
Um, so we will, we will be hosting it.

01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:54.040
If you want to chat with some of us, you can do that in the VOG chat room.

01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:57.000
Uh, cause I think we did that last time and it worked out pretty well.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.840
So I'm check that out throughout the week.

01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:00.280
Um, all right.

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:02.000
So I've mentioned it twice now, so I know I'm good.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.260
So let's get to that email.

01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:18.060
If you want to send us an email, participate at orange lounge, radio.com, uh, dark soccer.

01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:20.460
Do you want to get to the email tonight?

01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:23.980
Yeah, no, it got really quiet for a moment and I thought you were saying something else.

01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:24.980
So sorry.

01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:25.980
No, you're good.

01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:26.980
Okay.

01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:27.980
Hello.

01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:31.100
Congratulations to everyone on surviving 2020.

01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:37.260
Hopefully we'll all get, I'll get shot soon and see things getting back to sort of almost

01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:38.260
normal.

01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:42.660
I know I'm really looking forward to actually going out in public and playing DDR again.

01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:46.900
Last week you mentioned all of the Xbox 360 halo games going offline.

01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:49.060
I just wanted to point out two things.

01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:52.700
First that only specific servers for those games are being shut down.

01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:56.580
You will still be able to play the games, earn most of their achievements and even continue

01:42:56.580 --> 01:43:01.220
to play custom multiplayer matches with friends as well as multiplayer games over land or

01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:08.020
split screen matchmaking files, sharing online stats and online challenges, specific things

01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:10.220
that are going away.

01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:15.340
Second thing is that literally all of the games affected are also natively available

01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:20.100
on Xbox one where they will remain available and fully supported.

01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:25.700
Most of the titles are included in the master chief collection.

01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:30.340
The two that aren't halo wars and Spartan assault are natively available on their own.

01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:33.740
If you're a game pass subscriber, you already have access to all of these.

01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:37.660
If not, they're usually offered at deep discounts during every major sale.

01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:42.580
Heck they're on sale right now, though only for a few more hours buying them all together

01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:47.220
would cost about $35 at the moment, which is not bad for an entire series.

01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:50.660
So I guess what I'm essentially saying is that this shouldn't be a big deal for most

01:43:50.660 --> 01:43:51.740
people.

01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:58.940
I suppose only the folks truly affected are those people still regularly playing on Xbox

01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:00.060
360s.

01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:03.900
As popular as it was, I can't imagine that there are too many of those left.

01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:06.820
There's also people who don't own the newer systems.

01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:07.820
Just saying.

01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:08.820
Yeah.

01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:14.060
I think also, sorry, I know there's more email, but just to kind of address that bullet point.

01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:15.060
You're right.

01:44:15.060 --> 01:44:16.980
And I don't want to dismiss anything YYR is saying.

01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:21.000
I think Microsoft's done an excellent job of making sure the game is still playable

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.560
for most.

01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:25.960
That being said, there, you know, cause we love our retro here on the show.

01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:30.400
Of course, there is going to be a subsection of people that are very interested in playing

01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:37.440
the game as it was in its original form, in its OG form, because as much as you know,

01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:42.040
Microsoft's done a very good job porting that over with the, uh, master chief collection

01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:43.040
and so forth.

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:46.080
There's always going to be a couple of people that are going to wonder what was it like

01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:47.560
beforehand?

01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:53.080
But I, I, I do like, I don't necessarily disagree with what YYR is saying.

01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:54.240
Like there's, you're right.

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:59.080
There's, there's a lot of ways to still experience Halo and play it and have a good time.

01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:03.960
Um, it's just, I think more of that archivist, you know, person that wants to see it in a

01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:08.400
museum someday looking back and going, well, that's a bummer that the online is gone, but

01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:10.320
we all know online never stays around forever.

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:11.320
Right.

01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:14.520
So anyway, sorry, Jamie, but wanted to put that in there.

01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:19.080
And by saying that I'm currently putting the finishing touches on the Pixel Poops remake,

01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:23.960
I'm still on track to release sometime this month, though, I'm guessing it'll wind up

01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:25.400
being toward the end.

01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:30.000
The Commodore version definitely needs a bit more time in the oven as well.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:34.920
I should be posting on the vlog discord sometime this week regarding testing opportunities.

01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:36.840
So please look forward to that.

01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:40.020
Happy pooping and of course happy gaming on the whole.

01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:42.160
Happy new year, Aaron YYR.

01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:43.760
Thank you for the update YYR.

01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:50.200
I'm excited to play both versions of Pixel Poop, all the poop this year between the two

01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:52.640
games that YYR is doing and the one that Loki's doing.

01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:57.280
This is definitely the year of poop, as he said in that direct a couple of weeks ago.

01:45:57.280 --> 01:45:59.280
So love it.

01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:01.160
All right.

01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:02.160
That's it for emails, right?

01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:03.160
Yes.

01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:04.160
Okay.

01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:10.360
If you want to send us an email for a future week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:13.560
So I want to get some of the comments and questions from chat.

01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:18.240
chatdeftinchat says, when are we finally doing an Among Us night?

01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:19.600
Great question.

01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:24.520
After AGDQ, but I really want to make sure we get that in sometime this month or I'll

01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:26.040
keep putting it off.

01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:31.760
So probably mid month and I'll try to stew on a good day with Bobby.

01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:33.180
I'm assuming he wants to do it.

01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:37.040
If he doesn't want to do it, then I'll work on it with Shane, who I know wants to do it.

01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:40.060
And we'll try to get that like in the middle of it.

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:44.520
We got to get past AGDQ and I want to let Bobby get past his shifts and stuff before

01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:47.400
we really worry about that.

01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:49.820
But in the next week or two after that, for sure.

01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:52.980
Oh, and some people are saying I just bought the game on the Steam sale.

01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:55.660
Oh, that should be fun.

01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:56.660
Other questions.

01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:57.660
Oh, this is good.

01:46:57.660 --> 01:47:02.320
Azet in chat says, should I submit the street light in front of my house for a Pokestop

01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:03.320
or gym?

01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:04.820
Sarcasm implied.

01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:05.820
Okay.

01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:08.200
So true story.

01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:11.740
There was a virtual Ingress event that was going on yesterday.

01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:15.340
And sometimes what people do is they'll get on to because, you know, it's been virtual

01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:17.420
Ingress events for like nine months.

01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:19.300
So people do like recharging of portals.

01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:24.760
And then they also go on to I still call it OPR because that's what used to be called

01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:25.760
back in the day.

01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:26.760
Operation Portal Recon.

01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:29.020
I think it's called Niantic Wayfarer is what it's called now.

01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:33.320
And we go in and we review submissions together and they're getting worse and worse.

01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:37.200
You guys like I was in there reviewing and there was a couple good ones that there was

01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:42.860
a couple like, you know, play structures at parks, like the best ones I always see

01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:48.100
are new parks where the street view doesn't show that the park is even built yet.

01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:51.320
But the photos clearly show there's now a park there.

01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:53.840
And that's like the best stuff that gets submitted.

01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:55.460
But then there's so much garbage.

01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:59.740
You guys like I saw street signs that were getting submitted.

01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:03.740
I saw one where it was a street sign being submitted.

01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:06.900
And I was like, this street sign is bad.

01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:10.180
But how is this little free library in the game?

01:48:10.180 --> 01:48:11.180
It shouldn't be in there either.

01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:14.200
I actually put in the note, I'm like, get rid of the little free library next to it

01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:16.800
because it's like in somebody's backyard.

01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:18.560
If you look at where the pin is, it's terrible.

01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:20.360
It's never gotten through the system.

01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:25.380
Unfortunately, there are people and I knew this would happen when they let Pokemon Go

01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:26.880
players into there.

01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:29.840
And I'm not shading Pokemon Go players.

01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:31.580
I play it too.

01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:38.800
But the thing is, is that the Pokemon mentality is the more stops, the more gyms, the better

01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:40.500
more and more and more and more and more.

01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:42.760
And I get that because you want to be able to spin everything.

01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:46.440
Who doesn't want to spin on their house for Pokeballs?

01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:51.560
That is the worst possible thing for Ingress, which is a very player versus player type

01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:52.560
of thing.

01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:54.060
And there's what you would think.

01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:59.480
I just wish that like at some point Niantic, if they're going to allow Pokemon players

01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:03.580
to approve things, then only let it be approved for Pokemon.

01:49:03.580 --> 01:49:05.700
Do not let it cross over in Ingress.

01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:06.700
Because it's getting annoying.

01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:07.980
It's the Harry Potter thing too.

01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:08.980
Oh yeah.

01:49:08.980 --> 01:49:11.820
I always forget about Harry Potter because of her.

01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:13.220
But I just quit playing all of them.

01:49:13.220 --> 01:49:14.220
Yeah.

01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:16.880
But the you're right.

01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:18.220
That all affects that too.

01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:21.860
But even generally for Harry Potter, the more the better, I think.

01:49:21.860 --> 01:49:24.640
So it's kind of the same thing as the Pokemon thing.

01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:26.620
So it's just, oh yeah.

01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:28.940
Azet saw a literal rock yesterday.

01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:30.400
Yep.

01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:31.400
That was the thing.

01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:38.480
I saw, I got a stop in Mexico and I'm always usually like, okay, I know these like places

01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:44.540
like Puerto Rico, Mexico, certain parts, remote Canada, you know, some of these other areas,

01:49:44.540 --> 01:49:46.080
they need more stuff.

01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:50.840
But the submission I got in Mexico was a telephone poll.

01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:54.520
Wasn't painted or anything, just a telephone poll.

01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:57.520
So it was, it was a no.

01:49:57.540 --> 01:49:58.980
The description was in Spanish.

01:49:58.980 --> 01:50:01.140
I didn't even need to run it through Google Translate.

01:50:01.140 --> 01:50:04.020
I was like, I know what this is and it's garbage.

01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:10.560
And the supporting statement is always, our neighborhood needs a Pokestop.

01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:13.240
We need a Pokestop to engage more.

01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:15.380
There's so many people here that would love a Pokestop.

01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:19.820
I think I had one that was a laundry room in an apartment complex that was like, the

01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:22.060
community needs a Pokestop here.

01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:24.580
We're trying to make a gym and all this stuff.

01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:32.200
I'm going to be honest, if that wording is in your justification, I'm already like down

01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:35.060
a point in my mind.

01:50:35.060 --> 01:50:39.780
If your only justification is we need a Pokestop, you're already down a point.

01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:44.080
I have a, I don't want to say I always deny, but because there have been a couple that

01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:48.900
were like park, again, like the park sign example where it's like, this park could use

01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:52.160
a Pokestop, it's brand new and was just built.

01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:54.220
I'm like, okay, fair.

01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:55.780
It meets criteria.

01:50:55.780 --> 01:51:00.780
I don't love that they're, they're relying only on Pokestop, but I get it.

01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:02.780
Pokemon Go is the large game.

01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:08.540
That's where people's brains are at, but you know, just, just remember, it's not only Pokemon

01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:10.640
people that are reviewing those.

01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:16.860
So anyway, uh, Tiger Claw says there's a gym located near a Burger King that used to be

01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:18.160
a Pokestop.

01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:22.280
That will happen when another Pokestop nearby gets promoted.

01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:25.340
There's a whole science to it and I won't get into it too much on here.

01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:30.220
You can read about it online, but basically if you take the map of the world and you split

01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:38.060
it up into itty bitty squares, if there's two Pokestops in a square, one becomes a gym.

01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:43.580
If there's five Pokestops in a gym, or excuse me, five Pokestops in a square, two become

01:51:43.580 --> 01:51:46.020
a gym or is it seven?

01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:47.300
Is that correct me if I'm wrong.

01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:50.880
She knows more about this stuff than I do, but it's depending on how many things are

01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:53.320
in that square, you get more and more gyms.

01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:57.940
So the reason why the Burger King became a gym is because something became a stop right

01:51:57.940 --> 01:51:59.300
by it.

01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:04.740
And I'll give you this tip because not as many people talk about this tip, but we've

01:52:04.740 --> 01:52:06.920
done it.

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:13.920
If you want to control which of the two becomes a gym, you can do that, but you have to have

01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:15.080
ingress.

01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:21.640
You don't even have to have a high level account, you can have a level one account.

01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:26.160
The portal in ingress, because they're all portals in ingress, the portal that has more

01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:32.600
up-boats on the photos combined overall will become the gym.

01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:38.720
So this has happened, and I'll admit to this, is that some of the locals here will say,

01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:41.280
hey, I got a new portal, it's over here.

01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:46.540
This is going to trigger a gym, which one makes more sense to be the gym?

01:52:46.540 --> 01:52:51.440
And we'll all go up-boat the photo on the one we want to be the gym so that it pushes

01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:53.000
that as the gym.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.040
So there it is.

01:52:55.040 --> 01:53:00.800
So you can work the system in control, but you only have the 24 hours from when it goes

01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:04.440
live to when it promotes to work that out.

01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:09.640
Because once something becomes a gym, it doesn't regress based on the thumbs up.

01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:14.600
The only way it regresses from being a gym is if it gets removed.

01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:19.080
I think even if there's only one, I think if the other stop gets removed and you still

01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:20.640
have a gym, I think it stays a gym.

01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:23.960
I don't think anything demotes to stops ever.

01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:26.640
So anyway, there you go.

01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:27.640
The more you know.

01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:28.640
All right.

01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:35.920
And as that is clarifying that an S14 cell, two to five portals is a gym and six plus

01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:37.060
equals another gym.

01:53:37.060 --> 01:53:38.780
So six is the magic number.

01:53:38.780 --> 01:53:39.780
All right.

01:53:39.780 --> 01:53:40.780
There you go.

01:53:40.780 --> 01:53:43.420
A little science on that for your GPS.

01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:49.140
And again, I encourage people to submit pokey stops, but please just submit legit things.

01:53:49.140 --> 01:53:54.120
Lots of signs on trails are great and we don't really have enough of them.

01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:56.580
There's surely a walking trail in your neighborhood.

01:53:56.580 --> 01:54:00.780
Just make sure you get the sign that officially designates it as a trail.

01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:04.140
Parks, especially if there's new ones, great.

01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:05.200
Churches, great.

01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:06.460
Just make sure.

01:54:06.460 --> 01:54:10.580
Try to stay away from gated churches or if it's going to be a gated church, then put

01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:14.020
it on the sign that's out in the street and not inside the gates.

01:54:14.020 --> 01:54:16.660
I think that's much better.

01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:19.180
And you know, that type of stuff is great and fine.

01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:22.380
And I have no problem approving those types of things.

01:54:22.380 --> 01:54:27.820
But just what was the other here's the here's the all star winner from yesterday.

01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:34.380
I think this is before we were chatting is that I got a trophy in someone's house.

01:54:34.380 --> 01:54:39.300
It was a picture of a trophy in someone's house and it said their name and what award

01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:40.300
they won.

01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:43.460
And so when I rejected it, I put in the description.

01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:49.780
Would so and so please stop submitting pokey stops where their name is easily identifiable?

01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:53.300
And I said that is my reasoning.

01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:56.300
All right.

01:54:56.300 --> 01:55:01.900
Anyway, sadly, they don't they don't use I don't think they copy paste those reasonings

01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:02.900
when they deny it.

01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:07.660
I wish they would, because I've put some really like shady things in there that deserve to

01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:08.660
be read.

01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:09.660
All right.

01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:10.780
Anyway, I think that's enough.

01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:12.740
No more emails tonight.

01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:17.100
So I think we're getting to the point where we wrap up the show.

01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:18.460
Some last minute stories.

01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:19.460
Oh, do you last minute stories?

01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:20.460
All right.

01:55:20.460 --> 01:55:21.460
Sure.

01:55:21.460 --> 01:55:22.460
Yeah.

01:55:22.460 --> 01:55:23.460
Did you say you had one too, Jamie?

01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:24.780
I do have one and I just have one.

01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:27.300
Why don't you go first, Jamie, then we'll do Loki.

01:55:27.300 --> 01:55:28.300
Yeah.

01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:35.100
Jared Nandan, who cosplayed as the South Park guy who play World of Warcraft, he died of

01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:36.100
COVID-19.

01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:37.100
That's terrible.

01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:43.060
He was a big mainstay in the community, big cosplayer.

01:55:43.060 --> 01:55:48.260
And he's actually a friend of some of my other friends.

01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:53.220
So and he would go to the cons.

01:55:53.220 --> 01:55:57.820
He had like his computer, kind of a computer that recreated the one in the show and the

01:55:57.820 --> 01:56:03.660
table with all the candy and rock stars on it and everything.

01:56:03.660 --> 01:56:04.660
And does L.T.J.

01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:05.660
Rama ask?

01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:06.780
No, I didn't know him in person.

01:56:06.780 --> 01:56:10.220
I have friends who know him.

01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:14.700
So I had heard things peripherally from other people.

01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:19.140
So it was just sort of like six degrees kind of thing.

01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:23.540
But yeah, he died for COVID.

01:56:23.540 --> 01:56:28.420
There is a GoFundMe and Rama just said it, there's a GoFundMe to support the funeral

01:56:28.420 --> 01:56:31.460
costs for his family.

01:56:31.460 --> 01:56:37.740
So we can put it somewhere for people to find.

01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:41.860
But if you can help, please consider helping.

01:56:41.860 --> 01:56:43.220
That's sad.

01:56:43.220 --> 01:56:47.120
It's hitting more and more close to home every day.

01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:49.740
So please, please, please take precautions, folks.

01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:53.300
I think most people listening to this show are, I don't need to lecture everybody, but

01:56:53.300 --> 01:56:59.500
I'm just, you know, you don't think it'll affect you or anyone, you know, until it does.

01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:00.500
That's the thing about it.

01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:05.620
So actually, if Rama will post it, then I'd appreciate it.

01:57:05.620 --> 01:57:06.620
Yeah.

01:57:06.620 --> 01:57:07.620
All right.

01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:08.620
Loki, let's go to it.

01:57:08.620 --> 01:57:10.700
Let's go to you.

01:57:10.700 --> 01:57:20.580
So I had a mod that's been created for Cyberpunk 2077 to allow for a sort of working third

01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:24.020
person mod, which is kind of cool to be able to play it that game that way.

01:57:24.020 --> 01:57:28.540
Now it's not perfect because there is quite the process to install it.

01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:32.220
Plus it doesn't work in cut scenes because the game was meant to be played in a first

01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:33.480
person view.

01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:37.780
So there's not really a way to alter the cameras that much.

01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:39.860
But it is still something.

01:57:39.860 --> 01:57:43.400
So that's kind of cool that it is available.

01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:47.900
And if you want to check it out, of course, it's on Nexus mods, so go check it out there.

01:57:47.900 --> 01:57:48.900
Awesome.

01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:49.900
Anything else?

01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:52.220
That's it.

01:57:52.220 --> 01:57:53.780
All right.

01:57:53.780 --> 01:57:56.100
Then I think with that, we're about ready to wrap the show up again.

01:57:56.100 --> 01:57:59.500
I know it's a little shorter tonight, but with the holiday and everything, it just that's

01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:00.500
the way it was going to work out.

01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:04.260
We kind of knew that we will be back next week, however, in seven days to talk about

01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:08.540
whatever happens in the gaming industry next week, we will also be making our 2021 predictions

01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:09.540
next week.

01:58:09.540 --> 01:58:13.160
So that should be fun with you guys in our chat over Twitch TV slash VOG network.

01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:15.940
So we'll help you join us in seven days.

01:58:15.940 --> 01:58:19.340
Thank you again for tuning in and watching the show, whether you watched it here on Twitch

01:58:19.780 --> 01:58:24.020
or whether you listened to the podcast feed on a popular podcast platforms like iTunes

01:58:24.020 --> 01:58:28.020
and Spotify, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has the

01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:29.020
voice.

01:58:29.020 --> 01:58:33.740
But if the gamers aren't here to have their opinions read, then we don't have enough voices.

01:58:33.740 --> 01:58:34.740
We always use more.

01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:36.340
Tell a friend or two about the show.

01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:38.660
Help us spread the word about the show.

01:58:38.660 --> 01:58:43.180
If you are interested in helping the show out, you can always support our shop over

01:58:43.180 --> 01:58:44.620
at VOG network dot com.

01:58:44.620 --> 01:58:46.780
That's VOG network dot com slash shop.

01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:51.460
You can pick up some cool merchandise, including the OLR shirt that Loki's wearing on Twitch

01:58:51.460 --> 01:58:52.560
tonight.

01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:55.860
And I got to say, I really like the VOG shirt that I bought there.

01:58:55.860 --> 01:58:57.320
It's a great shirt and good material.

01:58:57.320 --> 01:59:02.980
So I and I'm not just saying that because I want the sale is it is a nice shirt.

01:59:02.980 --> 01:59:05.480
So definitely encourage you to check out the shop.

01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:08.500
We will be adding to it throughout the year.

01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:10.500
Just not this week.

01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:11.500
So check that out.

01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:13.600
I think that's it.

01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:16.540
Let's go around now and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap up for the night.

01:59:16.540 --> 01:59:18.460
So, Loki, I'll start with you.

01:59:18.460 --> 01:59:19.460
Your final thought tonight.

01:59:19.460 --> 01:59:23.020
I'm just going to have to be working on my game quite a bit.

01:59:23.020 --> 01:59:28.900
So hopefully we'll see some more progress on that soon.

01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:33.820
And my final thought is, you know, just a continued message.

01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:35.940
I guess I already said this, but, you know, stay safe.

01:59:35.940 --> 01:59:38.820
Please take precautions.

01:59:38.820 --> 01:59:40.100
We're almost there.

01:59:40.100 --> 01:59:41.400
We're almost there.

01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:46.320
If we can just get to the next administration who might get vaccines out a little bit faster

01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:50.720
than the current one and so forth, we may have light at the end of the tunnel.

01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:53.720
And please consider getting vaccinated when it's available.

01:59:53.720 --> 02:00:01.700
I'm a little shocked at how many people are resisting the idea after all the clinical

02:00:01.700 --> 02:00:06.120
trials that things went through and everybody that is saying and all the doctors and medical

02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:08.140
experts that are saying it's safe.

02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:09.520
I can't wait to get mine.

02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:13.980
I'll be as soon as they let me I won't get so dark soccer.

02:00:13.980 --> 02:00:16.360
Your final thought tonight.

02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:21.460
I wish that we would implement what they did in Indonesia, that if you refuse to wear a

02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:26.960
mask and I'll even add refuse to get the vaccine, you have to bury the bodies.

02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:27.960
That's it.

02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:28.960
Morbid.

02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:29.960
But yes.

02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:30.960
All right.

02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:31.960
Have a great week, everybody.

02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:32.960
We'll see you in seven days.

02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:34.760
Happy gaming.

02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:36.640
Try to make the best of the situation.

02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:38.000
Enjoy your comfort games.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:41.560
OK, enjoy your backlog, whatever it is you're gaming.

02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:42.560
Have fun.

02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:44.500
And we'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:45.500
