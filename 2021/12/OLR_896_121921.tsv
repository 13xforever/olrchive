0	17000	I have great news to share. After uproar and politicking, loot boxes are going away! Now you can get on board with your favorite games out of teas!
17000	27000	I don't get it, but I'm not the target market. I'm not willing to pay any amount of money for colors, patterns, and things that I frankly don't pay any attention to in a game.
27000	37000	This is the inevitability in 2022 and for who knows how much longer. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to explain more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	61000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 896 of our show for this December the 19th of 2021.
61000	67000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
67000	68000	Hi.
68000	80000	Hi, and I'm trying to figure out why I can't see you on Twitch right now. That is very strange. I will be working that. Of course we do tape live every Sunday night at twitch.tv slash vog network, the voice geeks network.
80000	91000	Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show and usually you see both of my co hosts and I have no idea why tonight all of a sudden it decided not to do that. That is interesting.
91000	93000	I can see me on.
93000	101000	Yeah, no, no, no, you're fine. It's definitely something on my end so I will work on fixing that. No worries. Meanwhile, how have you been this week? Happy Sunday to you.
101000	104000	It has been a week already.
104000	105000	Uh huh.
105000	109000	Yeah, so I am.
109000	112000	I'm now officially off all my meds.
112000	118000	At least the ones that are supposed to make me feel better about my life, the universe and my place in it.
118000	123000	And, oh, good Lord, it is. I'm confused all the time.
124000	127000	I am a mess, but it's okay.
127000	136000	Okay, so I got the cam issues fixed and I see your lovely bah humbug hat that you're wearing it kind of making me jealous a little bit. I like the hat.
136000	140000	And I'm wearing those that were your death hook for cutie shirts.
140000	150000	I'm wearing my death hook for cutie shirt because I that's how I feel I'm going to be killing later. She's a marketing queen. All right, marketing queen.
150000	154000	Stop Siri, stop telling me to do stuff.
154000	159000	Siri's like, you bought our type shirts, and I'm a guess I bought an R type shirt.
159000	170000	I so want to do a little prank and say hey blah blah blah, set an alarm for 4.30am but then I realized that would do the same thing to all of our listeners, and that's not a very nice prank so I will.
170000	179000	Well on top of that Siri actually pays attention to what your voice sounds like unlike a certain other non Siri voice recognition software.
179000	185000	They're all annoying let's be real. All right, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.
185000	188000	Hey. Hi Loki How are you?
188000	195000	I'm doing fine. Hey, I thought of you because I know you you have this show has been on a very long time I said that a lot.
195000	206000	If it's your first time listening to our Hello and welcome to 896 episodes yeah that's that's we didn't have a lot to catch up it's like the MCU you got to watch all of them know what we're talking about now.
206000	208000	Exactly, exactly.
208000	221000	So, but but way back in the day, I remember you would talk about the matrix a lot because it was a movie series that you really liked. And of course the game came out and I remember you and I lived together when that game came out and I remember watching the game
221000	232000	get played on was a GameCube or whatever you will know maybe it was PS two I don't remember, but I remember watching that game. And so I kind of thought of you because I've been seeing all this hype about the new movie and they just did the movie premiere
232000	238000	in San Francisco actually which I thought was really cool they did the movie premiere the Castro theater I was like oh I've been there several times.
238000	250000	And it was cool and I guess that, you know, not that I totally care about what movie reviewers have to say but I'm curious you know and so I looked at some non spoilery things that were basically like, it's, it's, it's better than the other sequels.
250000	253000	And I'm like good enough for me.
253000	257000	So, I don't know what are your thoughts going into this new matrix movie.
257000	259000	I'm excited for it.
259000	271000	I want to see it in theaters but yeah we'll see if I get to do, we'll see if I get to do that might be a good way for it. Yeah, with all the, you know, all the Omnicron stuff is just like growing by the day.
271000	283000	Oh no no I'm not talking about that so that's fine. I'm talking about the kids and like having that. I was able to sneak away yesterday see Spider Man but yeah it's just tough with that time of year it's just busy and stuff.
283000	288000	COVID I can handle that my children. Oh god.
288000	294000	Well they wanted to see the matrix and I was like oh well we can watch the first movie and my wife's like no we can't watch that movie it's too violent and like fine.
294000	310000	It is a little bit I get to see it and you don't so that's fine. Oh, that's so cool. See, okay, see our pal Bobby Blackwell, maybe that's a thing we can do December 25, but I'm, I'm fine I'm boosted whatever I'm not going to get sick but it's and I would,
310000	315000	I think we've said this plenty on this show but I really urge folks. If you're not already vaccinated.
315000	327000	You, you're, you're going to regret that decision like I don't know I don't know a nice way to say it like if you're not vaccine unless you unless you have a legitimate you're like those that like point, oh 1% of people who have like a legitimate thing
327000	338000	that they can't do it. I'm not talking to that group of course but everyone else who can and doesn't like, I don't know any nice way to say it like you're you're going to regret that decision.
338000	352000	But the other if you're vaccinated and you're just not boosted yet you probably want to do that just food for thought boosted yeah just just do it, it's a quick little appointment, and yeah, you'll you can have faith knowing that if you do get
352000	354000	Miss Omnicron.
354000	362000	She's not going to be deadly it's, it's, you know, it'll be just, you should be boosted to. Yeah, we're all boosted here.
363000	374000	Good, good. I'm glad to hear some folks at least have their appointments set and that is that you're still being proactive about it and you still get a gold star, if you just got your appointment set that's fine.
374000	387000	So but I was looking in chat so Bobby Black Wolf in our chat says, My friends begged me to host a viewing in my theater so we're doing that Thursday night, I wanted to go to a real theater to see it see, I would totally go to the actually
387000	396000	Black Wolf Manor is probably the best possible place to watch that new movie, because then you don't have to worry about COVID, and you get to see it on the big screen.
396000	399000	So I'm jealous. I really am.
399000	405000	What do y'all say let's get in the car and go to Atlanta, Bobby won't mind right he he can do two showings.
405000	414000	Well, I mean, there's two advantages. Number one, Bobby's house, right, and everything inside of Bobby's house and number two Waffle House, my two favorite houses.
414000	417000	Have you met Mrs. Black Wolf? She's fabulous.
417000	427000	I haven't met her. Yeah, she's fabulous you'd love her. So, but I may put Dragon Con off again because it's a really big con and I'm probably doing TwitchCon.
427000	439000	Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah, it's gonna be gonna be a busy year next year so I really hope you know this variant thing comes and goes, you know, and I don't think it.
439000	452000	Well you wait till we get to the Omega strain and then we're all, you know, going to be super mutants. Well the good news is if, if this is a video game podcast I'm going to fire down this rabbit hole but my hope is if Omicron is weaker and not to underestimate
452000	461000	it if it infects more people, and it still causes some major issues to the unvaccinated. It's not going to be pretty and I don't want to make light of that situation.
461000	473000	But on like if you're going to continue to choose not get vaccinated, I literally don't know what I have no respect for you. Well, I'm not going to go that far but I really have no respect for people who aren't vaccinated.
474000	482000	I am not going to go that far. So, I'm just saying, you will have to live with that decision.
482000	488000	No matter, you know, when the people they infect will have to die with that decision just saying so.
488000	498000	Now I forgot where I was going to go with that so forget it let's just get to show you something and I'll be right back. Okay.
498000	508000	Okay so Spider-Man was awesome. How was Spider-Man? It was excellent. No spoilers. OMG spoilers don't spoil. OMG there's spoilers.
508000	511000	That's just how the internet is right now.
511000	519000	No, that's why I had to see it because the internet is the internet be like that so yes so I had to go see it before it was spoiled.
519000	521000	No, it was excellent.
521000	524000	I really liked it.
524000	530000	Okay, okay, Rob. Yes, doo doo doo doo.
530000	535000	Oh, those are cute.
535000	544000	I randomly saw them and I'm like, I know who wants this. Yeah, I loves it. Who, who doesn't need more Golden Girls memorabilia in their house.
544000	553000	I don't know them. All right, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight and I will go to Loki to ask us to start off tonight.
553000	563000	I'm going to be messing with the video here on Twitch just to try to fix some of the delay weird issues here but in the meantime, let's go to Loki and start us off tonight talking about the Nintendo Indie Direct, that was this week.
563000	585000	And I totally did not watch it but it was, I didn't either. It was yeah it was a direct showcase. I mean it's it's indie games, it's fine, you know, indie games are cool and stuff but like I, it was one of those like I literally did not see the announcement that it was out and I think I did see it on my feed like a while back like YouTube, like shortly after I was like, ah, it's fine.
585000	587000	I'll catch up on it later and I forgot.
588000	594000	But anyways, he did like a 20 minute direct that showed off a bunch of different games that are coming out soon.
594000	606000	So let's kind of go over some of those so we had Chicory, a colorful tale, and it is now coming to the switch. It's a creative painting puzzle game which sounds pretty cool.
606000	610000	We had Afterlove EP, which is a rhythm game.
610000	628000	Looks pretty awesome. And what else, Alicia, the Oblivion of the Twin Goddess, a 3D puzzle game with the messenger and was it the creators of the messenger they made a game called Sea of Stars, which is like an isometric RPG.
628000	650000	It looks like it's also got music by Yasunori Mitsuda, who is the composer from Chrono Trigger is doing music in that as well. That's coming out next holiday season.
651000	658000	What else? Locomotive, a point and click whodunit game. They have a Let's Play Oink games.
661000	664000	That's like, I guess, a bundle of board games.
666000	679000	Oink makes me think of that. Did you ever play that like dice? It's not really a dice game, but it's it's sort of like a dice game where you roll like rubber pigs and you try to get them to like it's like almost like Yahtzee, but like with pigs.
680000	684000	That's like a real game. I've played that.
685000	691000	Oink is. Yeah, it's a real game. I used to play that a long time ago as a kid, but yeah, because it's fun just to play the little figures.
692000	701000	What else? River City Girls 2, supposed to be coming out next summer. Olly Olly World is going to be coming to the Switch in February.
701000	717000	We've got a game called Timely, which is an action. Was it? It's a game with a cat and time manipulation. So, you know, I was always suspicious that cats can do that. Now I know.
717000	727000	Let's see, what is it? Omori, which is a time traveling RPG game. I own that game on Steam. Yeah, that's going to the Switch.
728000	739000	And what else? Figment, which is an isometric platformer game. And what else? I think that might have been it.
739000	750000	And I think Endling Extinction is forever. Good to know, you know, as opposed to the other extinction that is not forever, which is an adventure game and that is going to be coming out this spring.
751000	753000	I'm surprised it's taking Figment this long to come out, though.
754000	760000	And this one, this is also awesome. So they're also going to be porting over Grime and Don't Starve Together to the Switch.
761000	770000	And then my favorite title out of the bunch is Dungeon Munchies, a side scroller action platformer that you cook, hunt and eat monsters.
771000	777000	That's kind of great. I like that. Don't worry. Mama will kill it and then cook it and then eat it.
778000	781000	It really should have a cooking mama RPG game. It really should.
781000	797000	We have to like gather your own ingredients and stuff. Isn't that franchise kind of in the toilet now? Like what? Like ever since the whole way the rumor that cooking mama was mining Bitcoin, like that was like a year ago or something like all of the processing power of the switch.
798000	807000	Yeah, like didn't go ahead, Jamie. I was actually going to say a good thing about some of these games on here is like
807000	816000	a lot of people, I mean, they're older games, but they're pretty good that people on the consoles will get to check them out.
817000	821000	Figment came out on Mac. The sequel didn't, which I'm mad about, but you know.
822000	829000	Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's certain things that come out on Steam, but I still kind of wait to see like, oh, maybe this will get ported to the Switch.
829000	836000	Like case in point, the Final Fantasy Pixel remasters. I've really resisted picking those up and haven't played them yet.
837000	841000	And I really kind of want them to come to the Switch and then maybe I'll pick them up because I know what's going to happen.
842000	847000	If I buy them now, they're going to get re-released eventually and then I'll kick myself for having to double dip.
848000	855000	Although I got to admit, especially now that I'm playing Final Fantasy 14 and all the references to Final Fantasy 4 in this latest expansion,
855000	864000	I'm really tempted to get the Final Fantasy 4 pixel remaster. I don't know if I'll make it all the way to this weekend and not pick it up, but we'll see.
865000	870000	I'm going to try. I'm going to use the rest of my willpower, but I suppose if I'm going to buy any Final Fantasy game twice, it would be that one.
871000	876000	Yeah. And to clarify actually, Figment is, it's Figment 2 that's coming out on the Switch.
877000	882000	I might have to say, I haven't read that. It's Figment 1. I missed the 2 in there, but yeah, that's coming out. So it's getting a sequel.
882000	887000	Let's see. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, get a Steam deck so you can mod the fonts in.
888000	897000	My hope is, and maybe it's just a hope, but by the time they release it on all the consoles, they will fix some of those things that were early complaints, such as the font.
898000	903000	But you make a fair point that the Steam version right now is the only one that can be modded, which is probably the way to play it.
903000	909000	Dartusia says, I'm waiting for the six pixel remaster to drop, but yeah, I may get it again if they show up on Switch.
910000	916000	I know, and I feel like they know, and that's why they're not doing it all at once so that they can sell it to you twice because companies are evil like that.
917000	920000	Even Square, who I love most of the time.
921000	926000	Well, Square's backed up with, they said they were interested in FTS. That's all I need to know that they're evil.
927000	936000	Unfortunately, Loki, everyone is at this point, and I don't want to get ahead of ourselves because we have a story coming up about it, but it doesn't matter who everyone is.
937000	949000	Unless the fans scream and shout, such as, I know there was a whole thing with Dead by Daylight and Pinhead and NFTs, and the fans were like, you better the fuck not, and Behaviour finally came out and said, never mind.
950000	952000	And then getting kicked off the Steam anyway.
952000	958000	Or it was more like, that wasn't us, that was the Pinhead people, blah, blah, you know, place and blame.
959000	964000	And then I know I saw a thing this week about the creators of STALKER, or S-T-A-L-K-E-R, you know, that whole series.
965000	971000	They also had something like that where they were like, we're going to launch an NFT, and then the fans were like, I think the fuck you're not.
972000	977000	And they said, oh, oh, oh, never mind, we're listening to the fans, we're not going to do it. Never mind, never mind, reverse course.
977000	981000	But we'll get into, we have a story just like that coming up in a minute.
982000	984000	I suppose we should get into our gaming weeks so we can get there.
985000	987000	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week.
988000	989000	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
990000	996000	I played Dead by Daylight. I've been playing, well, not playing every day, but at least logging in every day.
997000	1012000	I've also been looking at some games. I actually picked up a game on the App Store that's a Castlevania game.
1013000	1016000	It just updated, but I haven't played it yet that I'm probably going to be starting on stream soon.
1017000	1023000	And I'm trying to look at my last update so I can figure out, oh, Castlevania Grimoire of Souls is on Apple.
1023000	1028000	Yeah, yeah, that was like on the Wii or something, I think, and then Apple Arcade has it now. It's like an exclusive, yeah, yeah.
1029000	1030000	I remember that coming up on the show a while ago, yeah.
1031000	1036000	Yeah, so I'm probably going to start playing that because I want to sort of play something every day while I'm on medical leave.
1037000	1039000	Ah, there you go. A little variety.
1040000	1047000	Yeah, patterned updated, so I was touching a little bit of patterned because it's one of my favorite puzzle games right now, like legit, actually a puzzle.
1048000	1053000	Power Washing Clean Simulator, also from the App Store.
1054000	1056000	Oh, I wonder if that's different from Power Watch.
1057000	1066000	It's different. It's actually an iPad game, but I have an M1 Mac, so I can play it on my Mac instead of on my iPad.
1067000	1078000	I got actually some stuff through Steam that is not game, so I've got like some art reference applications now that I've been just playing around with. It's been pretty fun.
1079000	1080000	And I played Theater of Magic yesterday.
1081000	1082000	Oh, like the pinball table?
1083000	1087000	I've been playing, yeah, the real thing that's in the other room. Our anniversary machine.
1088000	1096000	Well, and the thing is, and I don't even know how I missed this, but apparently there's a ball lock, like a secret ball lock behind the chest.
1097000	1098000	Yeah.
1099000	1107000	Well, no, I know there's another one that's around a ramp, the standard one, but there's the secret one behind the chest, and for some reason I either forgot about it or didn't know about it.
1108000	1116000	And so I had like multiple multi balls over a big course of games. We never put that one for tournament rules because that one sucks for tournament play.
1117000	1124000	It's just a really hard one for tournaments. So we have it like on all of the extra buy, like you can get four extra balls on it.
1125000	1127000	But of course, you know, all of our stuff is on free play.
1128000	1137000	You know, speaking of like pinball and stuff, you had a classic game of the week just like two or three weeks ago. You did pinball FX as your classic game of the week. Maybe it was even last week.
1137000	1149000	Um, and I keep thinking of you because I've been logging into the Epic store almost every day to get my free game. I missed a day already, but almost I did get Shamu three when they give that away for free.
1150000	1154000	So I'm sure a lot of people, and I don't like the Epic store. Like I really don't like it, but free is fucking free.
1155000	1159000	So they're giving out games free. I have so many and I don't play.
1160000	1166000	They do that for the holidays all the time. And it usually, it usually starts with a big one and ends with a big one. So the starter.
1167000	1170000	They put out another one today actually, which I haven't checked.
1171000	1174000	Uh, they did. It's um, uh, somebody will say the name.
1175000	1176000	Which I can't play any of them.
1177000	1178000	The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.
1179000	1195000	That's it. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was it. Yeah. So the one they gave away yesterday I already had. But anyway, my point is I keep going in there and I see the ads for pinball FX because, and you talked about this during the gaming week, I guess that's going to be an Epic store exclusive, which I don't love, but that's show business.
1195000	1207000	So, you know, people get exclusives. Um, but I keep seeing the ads for it and I keep wondering, Oh, I wonder if this is sooner rather than later in 2022. Cause I actually, I am really curious to see where the pinball FX series kind of goes, um, in the future.
1208000	1212000	So I don't know. I was just kind of randomly thinking of that. And you talking about pinball and theater magic made me think of that.
1215000	1218000	Also, I want to give a shout out to Stella in Loki's lap right now. Hi Stella.
1219000	1223000	Yeah. She keeps screaming at me. I don't know if it's coming through, but she's just sitting here like screaming that I won't pick her up.
1223000	1232000	Oh, poor kitty. She's a little mad at me too, because she got all up into stuff and nearly broke things and I kind of fussed at her.
1233000	1240000	So Alan is actually home right now. He usually runs errands right at the start of OLR. But since Alan's home, I think smoosh is like under control.
1241000	1246000	He's probably chilling with Alan while Alan plays dead by daylight or no man's sky or whatever he's doing right now.
1246000	1253000	So, um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says my cat does the same thing, which is wonderful when I'm in meetings.
1254000	1262000	Okay. I don't know about you. Oh, funny enough. Alan just walked in here and in behind Alan, Mr. Smoosh, like three steps behind that cat doesn't go anywhere without daddy.
1263000	1268000	Um, but anyway, he gives a shit about me, but other daddy, uh, he's crazy about anyway.
1268000	1275000	Um, Bobby says my cat does the same thing, which is wonderful when I'm in meetings, but I don't know about you guys. I love to see people's animals in meetings.
1276000	1282000	Like I, I will stop the whole zoo meeting to be like, is that your kitty? You know, let's talk about your kitty.
1283000	1284000	And I even do it for puppies and all that.
1285000	1296000	Minda comes into my team meetings all the time. I usually am not on camera. I have, uh, my webcam picture is, uh, Renna looking really excited.
1296000	1299000	And it's saying naturally in Japanese.
1302000	1312000	I was going to say it's good that she does, you know, you know, show up once in a while, but unfortunately she has like a sixth sense of when I'm recording for the voiceovers or something like that.
1313000	1319000	And it's like, she'll be sound asleep and then boom, wake up when I'm recording voiceovers to scream in the background. So that's not fun.
1320000	1321000	She just wants to be famous.
1322000	1328000	All right. Uh, Dar Sacher, I, I rudely interrupted your gaming week with a 10 minute tangent. How else was your gaming week?
1329000	1336000	That, that was a, a lot of screaming was involved at Survivors. Right now it's like, there's no point in playing Dead by Daylight seriously.
1337000	1339000	I was actually talking with just a couple of other people about that earlier.
1340000	1348000	It's like, there's no legit reason to play Dead by Daylight seriously right now because everyone's either snowmanning or memeing because MMR is broken again.
1348000	1354000	And things are glitchy again. So no one's actually being serious.
1355000	1361000	I feel like with Dead by Daylight, you just have to, especially in this MMR age, you just have to stop giving a fuck about winning or losing. Like it's just whatever.
1362000	1370000	There's no winning. I've just given up thinking of there's a concept of winning in the game for me is if I have a good chase and I hook somebody I've won that round.
1371000	1375000	Yeah. Um, there's winning, there's losing and there's disconnecting.
1375000	1381000	No, I have zero respect for an in-game disconnect unless it's like against a black face blubber.
1382000	1390000	I'm totally, yes, that is my policy. I will always DC the minute I see that somebody's running that, um, because that person doesn't deserve to play the game.
1391000	1396000	Um, but, uh, I wish behavior would, well, you don't have that problem because you're always killer so you don't run into that.
1396000	1402000	Because I'm always killer. Yeah. Well, I don't need, I don't like to give people the, the satisfaction of a disconnect.
1403000	1409000	I will, if I'm playing pig, I go on, on stalky stalk mode and hide somewhere where they won't find me.
1410000	1418000	And then I leave the room and I go have a sandwich or some coffee or read a book or, you know, do something fun.
1418000	1421000	I disconnected the other day while I was playing Myers is killer.
1422000	1427000	And I just had a straight up like bully squad who just wasn't interested in doing generators, just wanted to, uh, get me.
1428000	1433000	And I was like, fine, I'll give you what you want DC and enjoy losing all your add-ons. So whatever.
1434000	1440000	Well, I mean, I won't even give that satisfaction. I can just alt tab the game and go do something else.
1440000	1448000	Fair. Uh, Phoenix. And then they're stuck there with no one to react to them and they get zero satisfaction of making me disconnect.
1449000	1453000	Let me, important to answer in chat. So Phoenix 77 26 asks about dead by daylight.
1454000	1458000	Wait, the game just lets you do a racism. So let's back up a minute. Let me explain where this comes from.
1459000	1464000	So when they added Leatherface, the killer who a lot of people call Bubba into the game. Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
1465000	1468000	Yeah, right. The killer from Texas Chainsaw Massacre. What they did is that they gave him custom skins.
1468000	1473000	And of course, you know, Leatherface's kind of emo is that he wears the faces of his victims.
1474000	1480000	So what they did is that they gave, um, uh, Bubba, uh, the, the base four killers that started the game.
1481000	1489000	So they're kind of like iconic survivors, Dwight, Meg, Claudette, and Jake. They gave Bubba, um, those faces.
1489000	1498000	Claudette is black. And so, um, if a Leatherface wears the Claudette one, then that is a black face Bubba.
1499000	1505000	And here's the thing. While you can say like, oh, it's lore and dah, dah, dah, dah, all this stuff.
1506000	1518000	It just, it's, it's tacky. Number one. Number two, every shitbag Leatherface I've ever gone against in the history of playing that game is useless.
1519000	1520000	And that's why I'm using that skin.
1521000	1525000	And on top of that, you can't actually get that skin as a newer player anymore.
1526000	1534000	Yeah. You have to be legacy, I think. And then on top of that, you have to specifically choose that one.
1535000	1543000	Yeah. And here's the thing. I think people do that to be edgy. Um, it's not cute. It's not edgy.
1543000	1550000	And when, you know, I've talked about this whole, like it, it comes from the movie though. I would bet, I would bet a significant amount of money.
1551000	1554000	More than 90% of the people that use that skin have no idea about the lore.
1555000	1556000	Yeah.
1557000	1559000	So I just think it's a tacky decision.
1560000	1563000	They're probably regurgitating that reason from someone else who's used that shitty excuse.
1564000	1565000	Exactly. Exactly.
1566000	1567000	Behavior should remove it.
1568000	1569000	Oh, Alan wants to comment on this cause he, what, what do you want to say?
1570000	1571000	Hi Alan.
1572000	1577000	Oh yeah. He's, I don't know if you can hear him in the other room, but he says, you never see the other three.
1578000	1580000	You only ever see Claudette. Why is that?
1581000	1582000	Yeah.
1583000	1589000	So I think it might actually, and I'll be honest in sort of a reverse thing. It might be kind of hard to tell who's who with the other three.
1590000	1596000	Yeah. Uh, Phoenix 77 26 says, I mean, you say lore and DBD. I say to fuck. I did not know it had lore.
1597000	1598000	Oh yeah. Oh yeah. It's got lore.
1599000	1600000	DBD has a lot of lore.
1601000	1605000	It's like the, as Jamie described it once early on, like the, the Avengers or the, the Marvels.
1606000	1608000	It's the multi, it's the multiverse of survival horror.
1609000	1614000	Um, yeah. Yeah. And you know, and again, it's also the Texas Chainsaw Massacre story, you know?
1615000	1620000	So when behavior did it, they were just like, oh, we're just implementing this thing that's from the lore.
1621000	1627000	And you know, they, they didn't really think on a deeper level, what might shit bags on the internet do with this and why?
1627000	1636000	Well, and on, on top of that, I think that if behavior had been an American company and I'm not to, not to say anything about a French Canadian company, mind you,
1637000	1647000	but there's going to be a little bit of a cultural sensitivity thing that might not have occurred to them that we would definitely have kept our pulse on.
1647000	1648000	Right. You know? Right.
1649000	1656000	Um, it's just, I, I, they should just take it out.
1657000	1664000	And the fact that they haven't, it would really be as easy as a true false code trigger.
1665000	1669000	Yeah. Or just, just convert them into charms or something else.
1670000	1672000	No, no, we don't, unless it's like Claudette head.
1672000	1682000	Yeah, yeah, exactly. Not, I'm not saying like, you know what I mean? Like change them into different types of charms or something so that the people can still be like, yay, I earned this thing.
1683000	1684000	So, um, and then that's that.
1685000	1687000	It's almost always a camping basement bubble on top of it.
1688000	1692000	All right. Anyway, so yeah, that's why I say I have the policy. If I see one, I disconnect.
1693000	1700000	They're never any fun to go against and it's just, and I think the more of us that do that, it's going to force, it never will force behavior to do something, but I wish they would.
1700000	1704000	If, if I was a survivor, that would be the one thing I would disconnect over.
1705000	1709000	But other than that, I don't give people the satisfaction. I'm a lot more stubborn than they are.
1710000	1715000	All right. Anyway, uh, Loki, did we finish out your gaming week or do we even get to your gaming week? I'm sorry.
1716000	1717000	Uh, we never got to it.
1718000	1719000	All right, let's do it. Your gaming week. How was it?
1719000	1735000	So my gaming week was briefly Minecraft. It was mostly video editing because, uh, unfortunately, like early game, when we started a new season in Minecraft, it's harder because it's less scripted or not necessarily scripted.
1736000	1743000	It's less, less planned out. Like I had general ideas. Like I want to do, like build these things or like build these farms, gather these resources or something like that.
1743000	1752000	But like later on in the season, it's more like scheduled out and stuff. And so it's a little easier to know what I need to record for each episode.
1753000	1764000	So it's going through that initial, like dump of video footage. So I had like 12 hours of video footage to comb through to pull out stuff, but the episode turned out great.
1765000	1767000	So go check it out, posted it last night.
1768000	1772000	Awesome. Congrats over at youtube.com slash Loki O L R.
1773000	1781000	Yes. And then, um, that was pretty much the only thing I played, uh, this week. I need to get back my, um, X-Box series X from my sister.
1782000	1783000	Yes, you do.
1783000	1784000	Hopefully she's selling Kingdom Hearts 3.
1785000	1793000	All right. Um, my gaming week, I played a little bit more Minecraft Loki, but nothing too, uh, I started yet another save game and I had a much better luck with my survival.
1794000	1798000	And I was thinking about some of the tips you were saying about leaving the torches on one side underground.
1798000	1806000	So excuse me, I need to play more of it, but I've just been distracted by most of my time of this week. I've been playing Final Fantasy 14.
1807000	1816000	Um, the cues are still messy, but I've kind of figured out how to make them work for me. I have pretty much figured out, like if I go out and do stuff right after work, like I go for a walk or do something.
1817000	1824000	If I start queuing up around seven 30, I'll be in the game by nine. And then I play from nine o'clock to bedtime. Yeah. To, to kind of play out the night.
1824000	1825000	Um, some stuff-
1825000	1826000	I'm not touching it yet.
1826000	1827000	Some stuff is-
1827000	1828000	I don't have that kind of patience.
1828000	1844000	Yeah. Uh, it does take some patience. Um, some stuff is changing with that in a couple of weeks. I, we have a news story item coming up on it because it's the, what they're doing to try to combat these issues that are still going on, like two and a half weeks after early access launched is kind of fascinating.
1844000	1849000	So we'll get to that as a news item later on. Some of you may already know what I'm going to talk about, but just act surprised.
1849000	1859000	Um, but I, since I've got my little system down, that's what's been working for me. And I have been able to progress a ways in the game. Um, some folks in my free company have already beat it.
1859000	1871000	The, uh, expansion. I'm not there yet, but I'm getting closer. Um, to put it in perspective, spoiler free. Um, I am on level 88 quests. Now the max level is 90.
1871000	1880000	My character is 90 because I think most people that have played through the expansion kind of know you, if you do any roulettes at all, you will outpace the MSQ.
1880000	1892000	So my, my character's max level, but I am on level 88 quests within the story. I just finished zone number five and then went into the eight level 88 quests. So that's the most spoiler free way I can put it.
1892000	1907000	Um, but, um, I've been, I've been enjoying it. Um, the story, you know, I, I've, it's, it's a bummer because since we are sensitive about spoilers, I can't name some of the things that I've had a problem with specifically because it would be spoilery.
1907000	1917000	Um, but I will just say, I don't think it's perfect. I think there's some room for improvement. And I think the general thing I could say is that I really am not a fan of stealth.
1917000	1927000	And I think I said this last week on the show, luckily the stealth stuff seemed really contained to one zone. I haven't really seen it since then, but those were really annoying, uh, quests.
1927000	1938000	Um, now granted, I never got to the point where I had to drop down the difficulty all the way to very easy, which is something you can do if you keep wiping. Um, so the, the stealth things are not insurmountable. They're just annoying.
1938000	1949000	Um, but the other thing that bugs the hell out of me are the escort quests. There are way too many of them in the game. And it honestly feels like something that vanilla wow did and figured out is not super fun to do in an MMO.
1949000	1961000	So I don't know why this is showing up all these expansions later in Final Fantasy 14. Those are really my only complaints though. And honestly, they're very minor, um, in light of a lot of other really fantastic things I could say about this expansion.
1961000	1979000	Um, very, very much the downright most beautiful one yet. Uh, the music is amazing. The zones are holy shit. Like unreal. Like some of the later zones that I can't talk to you about are really phenomenal, uh, in the way they look.
1979000	1996000	So, um, there's a lot to see in that regard. I don't know when the moratorium on spoilers lifts, but I'm going to say when patch 6.1 comes out, so not 0.05, that's January, but when 0.1 comes out, I will talk spoilers.
1997000	2007000	But until then, you've got a few months because 0.1s are usually three or four, uh, uh, patches apart. So, or, I'm sorry, three or four months apart between patches. Hello brain.
2007000	2024000	Uh, so I will talk more openly about that around the 6.1 patch because that's when I figure it's fair game. If it's that important to you, uh, and still, I will, I will still, of course I'm not going to spoil the ending or anything like that. I'm not a total jerkbag, but I will, I will be a little, little, I will talk specifically about zones and things like that when we get to the 0.1 patch.
2024000	2041000	Anyway, um, other than that, um, with my afternoons, I, I've also been playing still a bit of Dead by Daylight, honestly. Uh, I got Miss Michaela all the way up to level 40 so I could get her Booners. Uh, if what I'm talking about is that she can Boon Totems is what they do, is what she does.
2041000	2043000	Oh, thanks for the clarification.
2043000	2061000	Yes. So I, I, we sometimes on streams and stuff, we say her Booners. Um, so I got Chris her Booners, uh, which is my main. I like to play Chris and now I, I'm, and Dark Sakura as a killer, I'm sure loves the Booners. No, she doesn't cause all killers hate the Booners.
2061000	2064000	Honestly, I'm kind of indifferent.
2064000	2067000	Oh, I can't stand shadow stuff as a killer.
2068000	2072000	I'll be honest, I don't notice because who do I play?
2072000	2074000	Ah, fair, fair.
2074000	2075000	Pig Freddy?
2075000	2076000	Yeah, yeah.
2076000	2078000	They don't really seem that badly affected by it.
2078000	2080000	Mm-hmm.
2080000	2081000	But...
2081000	2093000	Others, it's, uh, Spirit, who's one that I play a lot, sucks. When there's no scratch marks, that sucks. So, yeah. But anyway, um, so I've been playing a little bit of that as well and then really the only thing...
2093000	2096000	Oh, but imagine how much a scratch mirror Myers would fuck them over.
2096000	2106000	Um, really the only other game I can really talk about, I've been playing a lot of GPS games, uh, uh, Ingress, Pikmin and Pokemon, all of them.
2106000	2115000	Uh, I've walked 30,000 steps this weekend, no joke. Uh, there was a Pikmin community day yesterday and a Pokemon day and there was a lot going on in Ingress.
2115000	2121000	So between all of that, I walked 19,000 steps yesterday. I was pretty much just out like all day walking around doing stuff.
2121000	2125000	Um, but that was, I mean, honestly, it felt really good and, uh, I was having fun.
2125000	2134000	Uh, yeah, there was a Pikmin community day, which was, you know, if you walk 10,000 steps, you get like a special little badge and there were, um, poinsettias because the game's all about flowers showing up.
2134000	2137000	But Pikmin's a little more passive. It's a bit of a set and forget it.
2137000	2150000	But I still, I met up with some of my friends from Ingress, like there was probably a group of about eight of us and it was great because since we were all walking around and planting flowers together, pretty much the minute we got to a flower, there were so many of us.
2150000	2162000	It was just, it takes like 300 flowers to bloom. You have to walk around a little bit, but if there's eight of you, we were just walking right down K street, bam, bam, bam, bam, like every flower was turning into a poinsettia.
2162000	2173000	So, um, that was kind of fun. So, uh, doing that in a group and then of course, Pokemon Go community day, which is like the, the, uh, climax of all the other days throughout the year.
2173000	2187000	Uh, or, uh, you know, he is like the revival day, the encore day. So you could get all the other ones that was going on both Saturday and Sunday. And, um, I actually got, um, quite a few shinies just from Bluetooth catching.
2187000	2197000	I was actually pulling up my game. I felt like I had a Shane weekend of shinies. I got like 22 shinies or something like that. Just random shit around the board.
2197000	2206000	Even a couple of three stars. I was really happy. I got a three star Machop. Um, so that's always nice. Cause you can actually use that one in battles and so forth. Hold on.
2206000	2218000	I'm looking right now to see like how many more shinies I got 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 22. Oh, wow. I called it right the first time. 22 shinies. How about that? So, um, yeah, I had a productive weekend in those games.
2218000	2230000	So yay, fitness. So 19,000 steps yesterday and 11,000 this morning. I walked for five miles this morning, just up and down, downtown, just catching Pokemon and get my steps in. So it was good.
2230000	2246000	And then I think I did a banner in Ingress while I did all that. So man, it's, it's, it's funny because, um, Niantic had this thing where during Pikmin and Pokemon community day on Saturday, it was like, find these, uh, ambassadors in parks.
2246000	2256000	Cause they're going to have some limited swag to find. Well, here's the funny thing. Okay. So we look at the list and you guys will get this and then we'll explain it to the listeners. So we're based in Sacramento, California.
2256000	2264000	So for the location where the Niantic ambassador was supposed to be, the Niantic ambassador was going to be at Cesar Chavez park.
2265000	2270000	Now, do you guys know why Cesar Chavez park is not the best place for Niantic ambassador to be?
2272000	2286000	That is where pretty much the entirety of like the homeless population congregates. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but there's doing, they were literally on Saturday doing a giveaway of blankets in the park.
2286000	2297000	And it was just full of all of that going on. So what apparently happened was that, uh, the Niantic ambassador said, fuck it. And went to the smarter place, Capitol park.
2297000	2306000	But of course they didn't post or tell anybody about that. And, uh, my friends like randomly found them in front of the Capitol. And do you know what the big giveaway was?
2307000	2319000	These signs that looked like they were leftover from Pokemon go Fest or on one side, it said, I'm willing to trade. And on the other side, it says looking for, and you write in your Pokemon with a Sharpie or something like that. That was the big giveaway.
2319000	2329000	Yeah. So, and I'm like, you know, ridiculous. And a lot, a lot of people were saying like that the Niantic representatives knew nothing about Ingress.
2330000	2340000	They only knew about Pokemon go. Like it was very clear that these people don't really work for Niantic, which of course they don't. They were brought in by marketing agencies and things like that, uh, to just fill in for the day.
2340000	2350000	But it's just funny. Cause I'm thinking like, here I am going, I play Ingress. I play Pikmin. I play Pokemon go. I've even played wizards unite for about six months before I stopped.
2350000	2362000	I pretty much, if it's a, if it's a GPS game, I've tried it. So it's just, it's just really funny to me how, like, I don't know. I'm like, maybe I should just sign up for one of these companies and volunteer to do it.
2362000	2372000	But then I guess maybe it would be a conflict of interest with this show. I don't know, but I'm still like, just, it's just silly. Anyway. Um, but yeah, good. Lots of exercise in my gaming week.
2373000	2383000	Uh, DJ Roma S in chat says, so Rob is making his way downtown. So you did walk a thousand miles. Uh, not a thousand, but I would say 13 between yesterday and today. So I'll take it. Right.
2383000	2396000	All right, let's get into our gaming weeks and we're going to start off with Loki with a topic. Oh, quick housekeeping note, actually, before we get into stories, um, because I've been asked a couple of times, are there going to be shows next week?
2396000	2411000	And the answer is yes. Uh, there will still be a show on December 26th, um, because it's the 26th. And so, um, we'll be doing that. What's that? I can't wait. Nevermind. I'm, I'm mathing wrong.
2411000	2422000	No, you're fine. Uh, so there will be a show then, and then there will be a show on January 2nd as well. So, um, we'll be here. So I think Jamie's not here one of those weeks, but we'll still have a show.
2422000	2432000	So we'll see how I feel. Yeah. Um, the one on new, closer to new year's is around when my sleep study is. So fair enough. Yeah. You gotta do what you gotta do for you.
2432000	2444000	If it's just Loki and I hold the, and Stella for holding down the fort for a night, then so be it. We will, uh, we will, but we will still be planning to bring you the shows those weekends because we're, we're hardworking podcasters. Dang it.
2444000	2456000	I'm sure a lot of people are taking the week off who very much deserve it, but, um, honestly, I have nothing better to do next Sunday or the Sunday after. So why not to OLR? That's my real answer.
2456000	2468000	I have nothing better to do. All right. Uh, let's get into some news, uh, getting to a story that we kind of referenced at the top of the show, but, uh, let's get into it. Loki.
2469000	2483000	Yeah. So last week we had Ubisoft announced their NFT platform courts that no one liked and meet, you know, dislike the hell out of it for the announcement video. And then eventually Ubisoft pulled that from YouTube.
2483000	2499000	Um, now there's, uh, comments coming from the posting on their internal social media hub, Mana, that basically, uh, developers have access to. And so with that, there was developers expressing numbers of different concerns about it.
2500000	2516000	Um, one, you know, what problems are they trying to solve with this up, you know, feature, I guess, what are they trying to accomplish with this? Um, the negative connotation that NFTs have and just, you know, other issues with it.
2516000	2536000	So for example, one of the public, one of the developers was saying, I don't really understand the problems being solved here. Is it really worth the extreme negative publicity that this will cause? How can you look at private property, speculation, artificial scarcity and egotism or egoism and say, yes, this is good. I want that. Let's put it in art.
2536000	2554000	Uh, another developer was saying, I normally try to stay positive on our announcements, but this one's upsetting. Um, then going down with that as well. Uh, you know, there was other concerns that folks are just going to manipulate, you know, the games to be able to get some of these NFTs.
2554000	2572000	So one of the ghost recon breakpoint NFTs that they had, or I guess, I can't remember they're calling them in courts. Um, but basically you, in order to get the special helmet, you had to play 600 hours of a game, um, in order to earn it.
2572000	2591000	So what they're going to do now is just have, you know, people that are mining crypto by AFK farming these games for hours to get this helmet that they can turn around and sell, which we've already seen this in games that don't have, you know, NFTs in it, like Halo, they were doing that to kind of grind through the game.
2591000	2607000	So it's just, it's bad. It's, it's really bad. And it's like, why are they even getting into this in the first place aside from that? It's a buzzword and all that stuff. Well, some other speculation says that maybe it's to boost some of their metrics.
2607000	2630000	So Ubisoft CEO, he's come on, is basically also said that NFTs are just the beginning. They're talking about, basically this, he was talking about some other things more just like kind of tech buzzwords, like metaverse, such cringe, web 3.0, and stuff like that.
2631000	2642000	And, uh, unfortunately, one of the buzzwords he didn't talk about was accountability for the widespread allegations of sexual misconduct. So that that's one of those features that's not going to be part of this new plan.
2643000	2649000	I'm sorry to laugh, but I just, I appreciate a good dragging from Loki. That's what I'm laughing at. Loki is not usually the one to do that.
2649000	2668000	Anytime, anytime we mentioned Ubisoft or Activision, it's always going to be a dragging. That's, that's my guarantee. So yes. So apparently, you know, it sounds like that. Oh, so anyways, going back to the kind of tinfoil hat thought of some of these metrics.
2668000	2686000	So say you have to log over 600 hours in game, and they don't really care necessarily that people are just kind of AFK in the game, because it boosts their monthly average user scores or rankings against numbers.
2686000	2699000	So it looks better for, I don't know, maybe advertisers that they're working with, maybe investors. It's a way to kind of boost those numbers when artificially, I guess.
2700000	2709000	There's another developer is saying here, I'm here to make games to promote fun and entertainment. And I don't see how this is going in that direction. It's just another way to milk money.
2710000	2713000	Yeah, it is. That's what it is. That's what they're doing.
2714000	2725000	Mm hmm. As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, Cool story, Eves. Tell me again, how you know what's best for me and gamers when you can't honestly tell your employees they're safe from abuse in the workplace. I mean, drop the mic.
2726000	2727000	The tea is hot.
2727000	2737000	Eves Guillemin is a toxic presence in this industry, just like Bobby Kotek. And as far as I'm concerned, both of them can fuck off into the sun. And that would be a great thing for this industry.
2737000	2745000	I do not need Eves Guillemin to tell me what I want. Fuck all the way off. I will be voting with my wallet. And this is a hard no on this stuff.
2746000	2759000	You know, and here's my word of warning to the CEOs who think they know everything. I'm gonna I'm gonna say why I'm smarter than Eves Guillemin. I'm not gonna say I know everything, but I know I'm smarter than that motherfucker.
2759000	2771000	And I'm gonna tell you exactly why. Because where this is gonna lead, he says, Oh, well, you know, people didn't want loot boxes in the industry. I would say they probably still don't. I think folks have tolerated them.
2771000	2783000	But look where loot boxes ended up. Where are loot boxes now? Tied up within the government, just like your company's sexual harassment issue. Sorry, I'm getting distracted.
2783000	2796000	But they're getting these loot box issues are getting tied up within the government. And now the government is set to regulate and pass rules around this stuff because you all can't play nice in your quest to make money.
2797000	2819000	Do you know what's gonna happen to NFTs? Do you know where the crypto industry is headed? There regulation regulations. Just you and honestly, it'll be necessary. We know what happens when an industry is unregulated, sell enough of these and brag brag brag for $20,000 or whatever the fuck you think you're really going to get for stolen deviating art.
2819000	2827000	Go ahead and guess where this is gonna end up. Regulation city tax central. Enjoy it. You played yourselves.
2828000	2843000	I don't even understand why the push to go into the space in the first place they got they they were so close to running afoul of all these gambling laws because, you know, they're saying, Well, hey, some of these things that you can get in these games, you could turn around sell for real money.
2844000	2872000	money because you're using your in game gems or whatever. And so you can't really take it out of this marketplace to make real cash out of it. But now you can. So like, are you just saying, Hey, come regulate us. I mean, because that's kind of what you're doing. It doesn't make any like it's just so stupid that you would even like, you just like squeak by without getting in trouble for this. And now it's like, okay, now we're gonna double down on that. Okay, well, now you're going to get in trouble.
2872000	2876000	Like, how's that working out for? How's that gonna work out for you? Just, you know, give it a year.
2876000	2905000	Um, just wait, Mike Defton chat says Mexico is already taxing crypto. So lol, to be fair, it is actually already happening here in the States, I want to say any brokerage or whatever, when they do more than $10,000 of crypto or something like that, maybe it's even 1000 I'm sorry, I don't have the latest numbers, but a high amount of crypto, they have to report it to the IRS when there's a transaction and you do have to claim that stuff on your taxes as an income. So like it's starting.
2906000	2927000	But obviously, the threshold is still pretty high right now. But just you wait until they want to tax these NFTs, you know, just hasn't gotten there yet. The government's lagging behind as usual, but it's going to get there. And again, y'all played yourself for throwing so much into this industry. Like it's just ridiculous.
2928000	2950000	Hmm. Bobby says that's why they want everything to be in crypto. So they don't need to use US dollars at all. You can only hold the money in a Swedish bank for so long. Before you know, if you want to spend it here, it's gonna have to cross the line. But I suppose if you want to hold it in a foreign bank forever, and then retire to El Salvador, then that's on you, I guess.
2950000	2978000	And let's say, hypothetically, that we get to some future where some sort of standardized cryptocurrencies accepted around the planet, and we're away from physical money. Well, guess what they're going to tax you in, they're going to tax you in the cryptocurrency. So sorry, you can't get around it. That's just what's going to happen. So if you think that it's going to get to that point, where there's a standard, you know, cryptocurrency that everybody's using, like Bitcoin or something like that, theory is that it's going to get to that point.
2981000	3000000	They're going to just tax you in that it's good if you're at the pay in a theorem or Bitcoin, if they don't tax the currency itself, the taxes will come out in the use of the currency. Mm hmm. Exactly. If you were gonna if you were gonna buy x item, you have x surcharge for the use of cryptocurrency.
3000000	3029000	Phoenix 7726 in chat says, To be fair, a lot of billionaire, excuse me, a lot of billion grifters have gotten away with worse. Oh, I know two wrongs don't make it right. Like it's, you know, yeah, two lefts do. Wait, three lefts do. Three lefts do. Anyway, so I but at the end of the day, if the populace wants to reject this, they have the power to do so if the populace wants to reject Ubisoft games, such as this particular game.
3030000	3053000	One that is feeling like an act of desperation at this point, then they should do that. And so the companies will stop selling this shit as long as you stop buying it. That's what it is at the end of the day. So facts. Mm hmm. All right, let's move on. Let's talk about things worth your money. I think more mini consoles who doesn't love a mini console.
3054000	3081000	These things are all the rage, of course, since the Nintendo NES classic mini kind of dominated a few holiday seasons ago. And now we have we've seen lots of mini since then, right? We've seen a Commodore mini. I just saw a target the other day, this tiny ass fucking Atari that actually had like a TV built into it. It was like no, it was like no bigger than my phone to like play Atari things. I thought that was cute. I didn't buy it, though. But that particular one has been out for a little bit, hasn't it?
3081000	3110000	I've just never seen it, I guess. But so they're everywhere. But anyway, we have another new kind of mini console launching in March, but we just got some more information on it. I think it was going to launch this holiday and it got pushed back. You know, COVID issues, shipping chain, supply chain, blah, blah, blah. So now the Amiga a 500 mini is coming in March of 2022. And it that's I mean, it's it's for some people, this is kind of an obscure, I think system. But I think it's one of those systems like worth your time and learn more.
3111000	3140000	Learning about and knowing and plus, you know, for those real classic gaming enthusiasts or Commodore enthusiasts or people who grew up around the name Amiga, I think this is going to I think is really going to tickle some people the fact that this exists and this is really cool. So retro game limited kind of unveiled that this is coming out on March 25 to 2022. And even though this was originally announced in August, now we know what the games are that are going to be in it, including alien breed 3d.
3140000	3169000	Battle chess. I remember that game that was on PC as well. pinball dreams, which is a real fucking classic Amiga game. If you're a pinball fan, that is seriously one of the best like game pinball things that has ever existed. worms the director cut stunt car racer supercars to dragon's breath. I mean, there's lots and lots of games here and I kind of want one I think it looks fun. So yeah.
3170000	3195000	That'll be coming out in March and it will cost $140. But it includes an integrated keyboard with the mini. And that's pretty cool. I see a little mouse attachment and controller as well. I'm not sure if that's included or what. I didn't see that in the list. But I think that's still kind of neat. Dark Sakura any love for the Amiga? Any love for an Amiga mini?
3195000	3211000	Maybe, maybe. Okay, Bobby, Bobby says it is included. And that this comes from the same company that did the C 64 mini. So that makes sense. That's pretty cool. Well, it makes sense if they have the Commodore license, kind of use that and the Commodore 64 mini was was well done. So I like that.
3225000	3242000	I might get one. We'll see. We'll see. Did you ever get the Commodore 64? I have the mini because Loki got it for me as a present one year, but I never got the full one with the full size keyboard. But I have the mini. Okay. Yeah. All right, let's move on Dark Sakura.
3243000	3268000	So a lot of people have been super into Hades. I mean, since it came out, I have it. I really should play it. It's a really pretty game. It's really awesome. But Hades won a Hugo award. It's the first, pardon me? I said fancy. Yeah, it's the first video game to win a Hugo award.
3269000	3297000	It basically won the one time award for best video game. It beat out Animal Crossing and Last of Us Part Two. And this is pretty awesome. I mean, the, I even would put this like up as a as a pretty big deal. I mean, the Hugo awards are there for science fiction, fantasy works, and to have video games now included in it, even if it's just, you know,
3297000	3311000	the one category for now. It was pretty big, but to have, you know, an effectively indie game win it, beating out some pretty big titles, it's pretty awesome, I think.
3312000	3320000	Well, the Hades is also a great choice, of course. I mean, that kind of goes without saying, but just, you know, a lot of the the narrative and stuff, and especially how, you know, this acknowledgement.
3320000	3337000	I mean, one could argue, you know, it's it's just another silly award or whatever, but I think it does sort of show, like the the general pop culture awareness or whatever the our culture sort of uplifting video games and accepting it more and more as an art form.
3337000	3349000	That's what I sort of see. Yeah, it's always been an art form. We knew this, and now we're the adults. I know we exactly we've always said this, but now I feel like the rest of society is kind of catching up right.
3349000	3359000	And I feel like, like you said, we are the adults now. And I think as our generation is growing up, now you see these types of awards getting, you know, video games getting uplifted more.
3360000	3366000	I don't look at it as like the rest of everybody's, you know, falling in line with it. The fact that we are the line now.
3366000	3385000	Fair. I got that. I mean, you still have, you know, probably the older generations are like, oh, video games, meh, but for us who are now the ones making these decisions, we are the ones those of us who were when our, you know, 30s and 40s who had an S as a kid or an Atari or ColecoVision, me.
3386000	3397000	We're the ones making these decisions now. We're the ones who are in that specific age group that are behind these decisions, and I'm not surprised at all. I'm happy for it.
3397000	3409000	Mm hmm. Bobby Lockliff in chat says, I think it's one category period. I don't think this category is returning next year. So, um, I mean, that's unfortunate.
3409000	3422000	If it's not, hopefully a lot of this buzz that this is generating and some of this discussion will, if they don't plan on bringing it back, we'll have them reconsider because I think it is absolutely something that should be included in the ceremony.
3422000	3432000	Why not? Um, and, uh, Woman Unsilenced in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network says, that's it. You are the line with a thumbs up there for Dark Sakura.
3432000	3449000	So, yep. All right. And, and honestly, though, I mean, this is just, I would, I would hope to see this category return. I mean, honestly, I think it would become, it really should be there as an ongoing category.
3450000	3461000	Um, but then again, there are specific, I actually, I'm not even gonna, gonna give the, the video game awards, any kind of like real thing anymore, because now it's just a big advertisement.
3461000	3470000	You know, I, I think that we should have a dedicated video game award that's simply for artistry and video games.
3471000	3481000	Well, what about the, not the bathtub, but there's a, there's one overseas that I think kind of aspires to do that. And then the name is escaping me in the moment.
3482000	3483000	Yeah.
3485000	3504000	And Bobby Blackwell is pointing out that GDC has one and no one watches it. So that is an interesting, that is an interesting sort of, um, point to bring up is that the game awards, even though, yes, there's a lot of advertisements and stuff because they've got all these exclusives and things that they pull into it.
3504000	3512000	They've got the viewers, whereas the dice awards and these sorts of things, little heart, I don't, I don't even know if they broadcast them online or anything like that.
3513000	3519000	Um, so they're a little, they might, but if they do, they don't get a lot of talk because maybe they don't have a lot of this other stuff.
3519000	3528000	And maybe we need to be supporting it more on Twitch or wherever they're broadcasting it. I don't know. Uh, and SJ 100 Matt does point out the video game awards need to sell ads, or there would be no video game awards.
3528000	3537000	So I'm not saying that they don't need to sell ads, but they are pretty much now specifically almost like this big ad walking advertisement.
3537000	3544000	Now I just think they don't need to blur the line so much between what is an ad and what isn't.
3545000	3551000	Um, and that's just my, like, they try to make it a big illusion and all that stuff. And I think, you know, people have watched enough TV over the years.
3551000	3561000	They've seen enough Oscar ceremonies or whatever Grammys, whatever it is you watch where, you know, we'll be right back after the break with, isn't it like people will, but I get it.
3561000	3567000	They don't, they don't want people to leave and get up and use the bathroom and stuff. They want people to stay and watch and watch the commercials.
3567000	3575000	But, you know, I think a lot of people are just like, you need to stop blurring the line between what's a commercial and you know, what's part of the actual ceremonies.
3575000	3584000	So anyway. All right. Um, anyhow, let's move on with some more stories. Loki.
3584000	3591000	Yep. So, uh, let's talk a little bit about more abuse.
3591000	3601000	So now Bungie's HR, um, head has stepped down, um, because they had reported executives for abuse.
3601000	3614000	And apparently there has been, you know, I think we talked about last week about allegations of workplace culture, crunch hiring practices within Bungie that aren't necessarily, uh, what people like to see.
3615000	3629000	And, you know, basically they've said, you know, when they left that, you know, I know that they need to be trusted to be your advocates, not labeled as enablers or seen as company resources who provides bad actors with safe harbor.
3629000	3639000	Um, that it's been the time that she spent there has been deeply challenging, uh, with deeply challenging interpersonal conflicts.
3639000	3648000	And, um, clearly that was a firing colleagues for performance, bad behavior, and for discrimination, racism, and sexual harassment.
3649000	3664000	And, uh, basically says that, you know, she had suffered similar experiences on her own from a man, an executive and someone that they thought was their friend at Bungie, which resulted in Bungie firing them.
3666000	3674000	So, uh, it looks like they did take action against the one person that was an executive, but the culture still exists.
3674000	3683000	So we've seen this before. I think even Activision, we've had people leave that were the head of HR and stuff because of similar stuff.
3683000	3689000	So hopefully that after they get done looking at these other companies, we look at Bungie now.
3689000	3699000	It's a broken record in this industry at this point. And it's something that, you know, I know it sounds weird to cheer on that the government is coming in and investigating it and doing something about it.
3699000	3708000	But, um, I need the government to do something to Activision that's going to scare the hell out of the rest of the, um, uh, leads and CEOs of these various companies.
3708000	3718000	You know, cause it's like week after week, we have these stories on the show about like, it's not just about which company anymore. It's about the industry.
3718000	3726000	This is an industry problem. And, you know, we just had this discussion about the Hugo Awards and trying to get accepted as an art form and all this stuff.
3726000	3738000	Here's the other side of it. If, if video games want to be taken seriously as an art form, they need to take out the fucking trash, you know, and at least we see it's kind of starting to happen in some places.
3738000	3749000	Although, unfortunately, Bobby Kotick is still employed. Yeah, I think they're really just trying to wait it out to see if the, if people will forget and stop complaining about it.
3749000	3751000	People will forget and stop complaining about it.
3751000	3759000	Allow me to complain about it. Bobby Kotick is still employed at Activision and that pisses me off. So I will be here to remind you.
3759000	3761000	It doesn't directly affect me. So why do I care?
3761000	3766000	Yeah, exactly. But video games, video games.
3766000	3776000	I don't want to be, you know, I don't want to be troubled by all this news. I just want to play my Call of Duty. You know, it's like, I'm sorry, but like.
3776000	3787000	But look at what the dumb fuck standard is bringing us in the industry. You just, you just had the story about NFTs and oh, well, this is where the industry is going like it or not.
3787000	3798000	Says you. Get the fuck out. Says you, the person who enables sexual harassment under your watch.
3798000	3808000	SG100Matt says abuse has been rampant in the industry for decades and we're just hearing about it now because folks are coming forward now. Shit bags are on notice and should be running scared. Their days are numbered.
3808000	3816000	There's been a lot of shady things that have run rampant in the industry for a very long time. Drugs.
3816000	3829000	I don't I don't know if they still do, but go back to the 80s when this industry first started, you know, it was really growing. Drugs. How many games were built on cocaine? Were rampant through this industry.
3829000	3843000	How do you think some of those games got built so fast by one person working long days? And I've seen documentaries where they say, yeah, I was inspired to do this from a cocaine trip I was having at the time.
3843000	3853000	You know, like, you know, so the industry has always had its issues and this is just an issue that really needs fixing.
3853000	3866000	Anyway, let's see. Phoenix 7726 says send regulators in, start finding the millions they hit for each incident of sexual harassment, then bring up the heads on charges for being accessories to a crime.
3866000	3875000	I don't know if it's going to go that far realistically, but I think some of which I mean, not that I disagree, but I just I'm also kind of a realist and how the government works sometimes.
3875000	3887000	And I think some of what you're saying is starting to it's just everything the government moves at a fucking glacial pace. But it's starting. It's starting. And I think of it this way.
3887000	3895000	Go ahead, Darcynra. I'm going to disagree with DJ Ron Matt S in chat. I don't think that's all excessive at all. They all need to be held accountable and they need to be held super accountable.
3895000	3907000	They're all garbage and they need to be treated as such. The end. I, I don't think it's I think it's just unrealistic. Like that's this thing. It's just, it's not going to happen like it's I'm not trying to say I disagree or anything like that.
3907000	3919000	It's just, again, the government's only going to be able to go so far. But anyway, I mean, again, refer to the comment earlier about like billionaires that still get away with tax things and how, you know, you all know what I mean.
3919000	3930000	But anyway, fuck, where was I going with this? Oh, we wouldn't even be talking about these issues at Activision Blizzard right now.
3930000	3939000	I don't think if the government had not stepped in and filed the charges that they did to bring this to the limelight and give voice to the people that were consistently being silenced.
3939000	3950000	So I realize we all have our criticisms of the government, which are completely fair. But in this particular case, like the government did its job finally, slowly.
3950000	3965000	But it finally led to this discussion where we're at now. So anyway, let's move on and talk about speaking of retro games that may or may not have been done on drugs.
3965000	3970000	I don't know if the drugs were still in the industry by the time the Sega Genesis was a thing, but probably a little bit.
3971000	3978000	But there are some new Sega Genesis games that are coming to Nintendo Switch online, which I think is kind of fun.
3978000	3989000	Five more Sega Genesis games coming to Switch online, including Altered Beast, ToeJam & Earl, Dynamite Headdy, Sword of Vermillion, and Thunder Force 2.
3989000	3994000	And I think four of those games are in the prior Soul Genesis collection on the last generation of consoles.
3994000	4001000	But cool, if you're an expansion pack member, you get those games. And you also get Paper Mario that was just added a week ago.
4001000	4009000	If you do not have the expansion pack, you get Jack & Shit. Congratulations.
4009000	4017000	Which we all knew was going to be the problem once Nintendo launched this expansion pack, was that the expansion pack was the only thing that was going to get shown any love.
4017000	4020000	So, I guess it is what it is, huh?
4020000	4029000	By the way, Japan getting the exact same lineup. Sometimes there's differences between what Japan gets and what we get, but that is not the case with this.
4029000	4036000	I have another kind of like random Nintendo side tangent with this that was kind of brought to my attention by Dark Tetsuya, which I think is interesting.
4036000	4040000	I have to admit, I think I've maybe seen this maybe one time ever.
4041000	4049000	But this show's been running a long time online. The Nintendo Minute, they've been going since 2013. Oh, those young kids, those young newbies.
4049000	4053000	But that's still a long time, an impressive time, what, eight years that they've been going.
4053000	4059000	400 episodes of that have happened, but they're not going to be doing the Nintendo Minute anymore.
4059000	4068000	The last episode ever was released on YouTube, and it's called the final episode. And then the hosts of the show give their final words.
4068000	4073000	I don't know why they did this or why now and don't know if there's going to be a replacement or anything like that.
4073000	4078000	But kind of interesting, I guess, that this just kind of happened out of the blue.
4078000	4084000	I feel sorry for those hardworking hosts unless it was their choice, but I don't know. I have a feeling it wasn't.
4084000	4094000	So, all right, moving on. Loki, maybe I should have had you go after the Dark Sakura story because I think this is an interesting follow up.
4094000	4102000	Yeah. So let's see here. Hold on. It pulled up the wrong story here for me.
4102000	4106000	Bobby Blackwoven Chat says the hosts will still be working at Nintendo, but in other roles.
4106000	4110000	But we don't know if those roles are on camera or not. Anyway, sorry. Go ahead, Loki.
4110000	4113000	I think this is actually Jamie's.
4113000	4117000	You are correct. It is my turn. And I was like, what?
4117000	4120000	Sorry, I make mistakes too. Dark Sakura, go ahead.
4121000	4129000	There is a company called Vodio Games did a game called Beast Breaker not long ago.
4129000	4140000	They have partnered with code CWA and they now have the first video game union.
4140000	4148000	They have voltage organized workers, United piezo workers.
4148000	4156000	They've been really influenced by some of those those other ones and their union is called the Vodio Workers United.
4156000	4162000	It represents all of their eligible employees. More than half of them are independent contractors.
4162000	4170000	And it is was basically voluntarily recognized by the company.
4170000	4179000	And they will they don't have the National Labor Relations Board vote.
4179000	4189000	But they say they won't have to force the vote, but they'll be able to go with negotiations for an equitable workplace to work with benefits.
4189000	4194000	You know, and one of the ones they're working on is a four day workweek.
4194000	4197000	So they're there work.
4197000	4204000	I mean, there's also a few other international ones that they're they're sort of working with to try to bring some of the same things about.
4204000	4212000	But I think it's about time. And maybe this new company here will set a good example.
4212000	4220000	Comment from Bobby Blackwell in our chat who says, I'm just curious how bad that culture was that necessitated them to form a union to get better working conditions.
4220000	4227000	Maybe I mean, there might have been things here or there at that company that we don't know about, but maybe it was the industry problems that caused that.
4227000	4231000	Just like, hey, we see what's going on over here and over there and over there.
4231000	4235000	And we don't want to be like that. I mean, actually, I have something to say about that.
4235000	4242000	Oh, please. Code CWA campaign lead. Her name is Emma Canema.
4242000	4247000	Basically, this is her quote about Vodio as an example.
4247000	4251000	They're not organizing because there's some big scary boss like Bobby Kotick or someone.
4251000	4255000	They're organizing because they care so much about the work that they do.
4255000	4261000	They want more say over how it's done, the conditions in which they work to actually make those games they care about.
4261000	4268000	Hmm. So this came up because they love their company that they work for and what they do there.
4268000	4275000	Interesting. At least that answers. Well, in writing, that's what's said, but I think there's certainly an element of that.
4275000	4285000	That's true. I'm not going to discount the words, but I think there's probably an unspoken piece there because I'm kind of reading between the lines when they say, you know, the Bobby Kotick part,
4285000	4290000	you know, like there there is a comparison to something else going on in the industry that they don't want to become.
4290000	4297000	So I do kind of read it between the lines a little bit there. So there's what's said and what's unsaid.
4297000	4302000	All right. Moving on. Now, I think we're over to Loki.
4302000	4315000	Yes. So we talked about this feature that Twitch was adding where you could basically pay to win boost your channel to get more recommendation or featured in more recommendations for users.
4315000	4327000	And apparently there was one hundred twenty five people who took part in that feature and it didn't do very much.
4327000	4333000	So it didn't really have much of an impact at all and was a waste of money.
4333000	4348000	So. Basically, they said after looking at all of the different, you know, the different view counts between those that were using that service and not, there was a negligible difference.
4348000	4356000	And in terms of my data, they said that there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that boost had any kind of impact on their streams.
4356000	4360000	It's almost like it didn't happen. So.
4360000	4367000	It sounded scammy to begin with. And it still sounds scammy.
4367000	4372000	Are you telling me that link exchange didn't work at the end of the day?
4372000	4382000	No, you know, you probably ask because you're probably better off using like one of those shady fiber services or something like that, you know, to get more views if that's what you're looking for.
4383000	4385000	That's against us. So, yeah.
4385000	4388000	OK, that's against us. I'm just do it.
4388000	4392000	I have to say that on the record, it's against us.
4392000	4395000	No, I understand. But I'm like.
4395000	4401000	It's against us, but not if we do it, you know, through the official service.
4401000	4407000	But, oh, the Twitch themselves does it. Yeah, yeah, I get it. Yeah.
4407000	4411000	I just don't think, you know, the front page on Twitch is pretty cluttered.
4411000	4418000	Like you get the one broadcaster that shows up by default and then it's like within the bar, there's six other things to pick from.
4418000	4423000	Then there's, you know, what you're subscribed to. There's a bunch of or following. There's a bunch of those.
4423000	4427000	Then there's like what's popular on Twitch, a bunch of those recommended for you, a bunch of those.
4427000	4431000	Like you're literally presented like 50 different options on the front page of something to watch.
4431000	4436000	And by the way, there is no front page when you're watching on some of the apps because a very different type of front page.
4436000	4440000	So and I think a lot of people are using apps to watch Twitch.
4440000	4449000	And I'm not sure that little, you know, scheme to get more visibility really worked when it came to some of the apps and all that stuff.
4449000	4451000	So I think it's time. If I may. Yeah.
4451000	4463000	I was watching Hydro the other day because I'm usually hanging out in and his channel during the first part of my days before work.
4463000	4471000	And I think he made like he did like the front page thing. And I want to say it didn't really make a whole lot of difference.
4471000	4475000	Which is where the study ended up to. I mean, no, no surprise.
4475000	4481000	I mean, but we know somebody who has done this. Sure. And it didn't really pan out.
4481000	4488000	I mean, I might be wrong, but I remember hearing hearing him say that it didn't really do much.
4488000	4492000	So just as a first person account.
4492000	4496000	All right. Well, moving on to something I hinted at during my gaming week,
4496000	4502000	and that is that there's some major things that are coming to Final Fantasy 14 with this latest expansion,
4502000	4509000	of course, clogging up the game and the queues. The Square Enix is finally taken kind of a radical step,
4509000	4512000	which I'm actually kind of surprised in a pleasant sort of way.
4512000	4516000	I know it's weird, but they have stopped selling Final Fantasy 14.
4516000	4522000	They are suspending the sales and the delivery of the starter edition and the complete edition.
4522000	4528000	So if you've decided you want to start playing Final Fantasy 14, you're going to have to find one on a retail shelf somewhere,
4528000	4532000	because there is no way to get digital copies right now because the game is full.
4532000	4538000	And honestly, truly, as much as I love the game and I've talked about it here on this show for years,
4538000	4542000	I've been playing since Realm Reborn. I've been talking about this game a long time.
4542000	4547000	Now is not the time to start playing until they figure all this shit out, and it may be a couple months.
4547000	4554000	So, yeah. Or coming back, because I think about, like, Bobby, who hasn't played since a Realm Reborn,
4554000	4557000	or even Alan, my husband, also stopped shortly into Heavensward.
4557000	4563000	Now is not the time to come back, because these queues and stuff, even though the expansion is really, really fucking good,
4563000	4568000	the state of the servers is going to test your patience.
4568000	4571000	And I don't know how many people are willing to put up with it, quite frankly.
4571000	4574000	It's not a good way to show your game for the first time.
4574000	4580000	Now, I should say physical copies of this are affected, so when I say you've got to find one on the shelf,
4580000	4584000	I mean, you've got to find one on the shelf now that hasn't been pulled yet.
4584000	4589000	So anyway, yeah. So they will still sell the expansion.
4589000	4594000	So if you're already in the game, and you just need Endwalker, they'll still happily sell that to you.
4594000	4602000	They also increased the free time that, so you might remember a couple weeks ago, they gave away 7 days of free game time.
4602000	4607000	They're now up to 21 days of free game time for those that are subbed to the game right now,
4607000	4613000	so damn near a month, just short of it, but 21 days of free game time because of the issues going on.
4613000	4619000	So at least there's that, is that, you know, these issues have been going on for just short of three weeks, about two and a half weeks.
4619000	4623000	Friday it'll be three weeks, and they've given away three weeks of game time.
4623000	4630000	And I have a feeling they're going to continue to keep giving them away until they get these queue issues sorted.
4630000	4637000	There is a patch coming out on Tuesday that's supposed to fix the disconnection errors,
4637000	4642000	so that you won't get booted out of line when you're in the line, but it's not going to fix the queues.
4642000	4647000	There's still going to be a wait to get into the game, so I think that's kind of interesting.
4647000	4652000	So, again, another apology from Naoki Yoshida in the latest statement.
4652000	4658000	Yeah, 21 days, an additional 14 days being given, so 21 days total.
4658000	4664000	That's a pretty big step to stop selling your game, and they're not making the monthly fee off of it,
4664000	4670000	but you know that what they didn't, they didn't refund anybody who bought that expansion.
4670000	4674000	So that's where they're making their money right now, is off the sales of that expansion,
4674000	4678000	which I'm sure a lot of people who are playing the game, like myself, bought.
4678000	4685000	They are also talking about that they will have a roadmap in January on how they're going to address some of these issues,
4685000	4689000	like getting some new servers for North America and Europe.
4689000	4692000	There's one thing about games I love, it's roadmaps.
4692000	4699000	That's true, but to be fair to the Final Fantasy team, they've been doing these for a while in their letters to the editor.
4699000	4707000	They do roadmaps pretty often, and for the most part, they've stuck to them COVID aside, which I think we can give them a buy on.
4707000	4714000	So when they have their roadmap, I think it'll be pretty close to what's happening there.
4714000	4724000	All right, let's take a trip down memory lane in our next segment to a game that I think you can still buy today, but first, the intro.
4729000	4743000	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4743000	4747000	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4747000	4750000	And what did you pick for us this week, Dark Sakura?
4750000	4753000	VVVVVV.
4753000	4754000	I love that game.
4754000	4755000	Me too.
4755000	4756000	Yeah, it's old enough.
4756000	4758000	I also hate that game.
4759000	4761000	There's certain screens of that game.
4761000	4764000	It is a game that came out in 2010.
4764000	4768000	It's a puzzle platforming game that was created by Terry Cavanaugh.
4768000	4780000	You play a character named Captain Viridian who has to rescue their crew after a teleporter malfunction that sent them all to that dimension of the same name.
4780000	4783000	You can't jump.
4783000	4785000	You have to change the direction of your gravity.
4786000	4791000	And so it's got about over 400 different rooms.
4791000	4795000	You also can have user-created levels.
4795000	4799000	It was originally built in Flash, January 11, 2010.
4799000	4801000	It came out for Windows and OS X.
4801000	4809000	It was ported to C++ by Simon Roth in 2011 and released as part of the Humble Indie Bundle number 3.
4810000	4816000	That particular port allowed it to come out for Linux, Pandora, Nintendo 3DS, and for Switch.
4818000	4824000	So yeah, really the big thing about the game was the fact that you changed the direction of the gravity.
4824000	4836000	It was influenced by a game that came out in 1986 called Terminus, an 8-bit game that you had to avoid hazards by changing gravity in the game.
4836000	4847000	And then there's also different areas that have moving floors, different edge jumps, and different things like that.
4847000	4855000	By jump, I just mean the character, I guess, kind of teleports so that if you touch the edge of the screen, they show up on the other edge.
4855000	4864000	It has eight main levels, including an inter-level, and then four that can be accessed in a non-linear sequence.
4864000	4874000	You have intermission levels, final level, and it's basically just like super exploration with a lot of anger.
4874000	4880000	A lot of anger, frustration, breaking controllers, throwing things around. It's really hard.
4880000	4887000	At any rate, it was based off of an earlier game that Cavanaugh did called Sine Wave Ninja.
4888000	4896000	And he wanted to use the concept for that game to make something a little bit more widespread.
4896000	4903000	It was first unveiled through his blog on June 2009. It had been in development for about two weeks.
4903000	4907000	And the game was finished in about another two weeks after that.
4907000	4920000	It was really also inspired by Commodore 64 games from the 80s, like Monty on the Run and Just Set Willy.
4920000	4933000	The whole thing behind that was the shiny object in a really hard to find location, the sort of tantalizing item that's just out of reach.
4934000	4944000	And then it has a bunch of different strange elements in it that add a little bit of surrealism to the game,
4944000	4950000	including the sad elephant, which has also been nicknamed the elephant in the room,
4950000	4958000	which is basically a large elephant that has one tear coming from its eye and it spans four rooms in the space station area.
4959000	4963000	And it changes color. So the sad elephant.
4966000	4975000	But the sad elephant was actually from dream journals that were kept by Terry Cavanaugh and not from Just Set Willy.
4975000	4980000	So anyway, it was released on January 11th, 2010 for Windows and Mac OS X.
4980000	4985000	There is a trial version that was on the website Congregate with a K.
4985000	4989000	The Linux version was still being developed, but it was hard to port.
4989000	4996000	And so eventually it was rewritten in C++ by another developer named Simon Roth in 2011.
4996000	5000000	And then that led to the Linux implementation to happen.
5000000	5004000	This was considered version 2.0 of VVVVVV.
5004000	5011000	And that launched on July 24th, 2011 in the third Humble Indie Bundle.
5011000	5014000	It also had custom levels and a level editor.
5014000	5020000	And then it led to new graphic modes and different speed improvements,
5020000	5025000	but it didn't support the saved games from the flash version, of course.
5025000	5030000	And a lot of people got this version on Steam without any warning.
5030000	5034000	Apparently they're still working on a save file exporter.
5034000	5037000	So, yay.
5038000	5045000	And so there was a version that came out on Nintendo 3DS.
5045000	5052000	It came out December 29th, 2011 in North America, May 10th, 2012 in Europe.
5052000	5060000	And then it actually did get a Japanese release on October 12th, 2016 via the publisher Piki.
5061000	5068000	And then a demo of the early levels reported to the Commodore 64.
5068000	5070000	Pretty cool, huh, Rob?
5070000	5074000	Yeah, I didn't realize they ported it kind of backwards in a way,
5074000	5078000	because obviously I love this game because it's very reminiscent of Commodore 64.
5078000	5081000	There's a full port of it now on Commodore 64.
5081000	5083000	That's awesome.
5083000	5085000	That came out in April 2017.
5085000	5090000	And then the 10th anniversary of the game's release in January 2020,
5090000	5093000	the source code was made public on GitHub.
5093000	5100000	Soundtrack is all chiptune done by musician Magnus Paison, also known as Soul Eye.
5100000	5106000	And he was approached by Kavanaugh after playing a game called Space Phallus,
5106000	5111000	which is an indie game by Charlie's Games, and he did one of the songs in it.
5111000	5118000	And so the soundtrack is actually out called PPPPP,
5118000	5126000	which was released alongside VVVVVV as a music download or as a CD on Paison's personal website.
5126000	5131000	There's also a power metal version of the soundtrack called MMMMM.
5131000	5135000	It was arranged and performed by a guitarist named Jules Conroy.
5135000	5143000	And the album has a mod file that replaces the in-game chiptune music with the metal tracks.
5143000	5148000	And there is a full LP now.
5148000	5153000	It's a picture LP that came out January 11, 2020 by Materia Collective.
5153000	5155000	And it was really, really well received.
5155000	5164000	Metacritic overall was 81 out of 100 for the Windows version and 83 out of 100 for the 3DS version.
5164000	5168000	It's really been highly lauded.
5168000	5172000	The highest ranked version of it was the iOS version.
5172000	5176000	So take that as you will. Maybe it's easier to play with a touchscreen. Who knows?
5176000	5182000	It was also awarded the NDK 2010 Award for Most Fun and Compelling Game in October 2010.
5182000	5191000	Gamasutra gave it their year-end Independent Game Award, second place in an honorable mention in 2010.
5191000	5199000	So the game's protagonist, Captain Viridian, is a playable character in the Windows version of the game Super Meat Boy.
5199000	5204000	So there you go. V, V, V, V, V.
5204000	5208000	What a great, great, great, great, great pick for Classic Game of the Week.
5208000	5213000	Maybe you should call it V, V, V, which is the sound I make playing it.
5213000	5217000	I think the soundtrack to this game in particular is really incredible.
5217000	5220000	I like the game too. It's just such a simple concept.
5220000	5224000	All it is, is that instead of jumping, you flip gravity.
5224000	5228000	I don't even know how to phrase it.
5228000	5236000	The intensity of the game that showed up as a result of that pretty simple twist is really outstanding.
5236000	5242000	Honestly, I think one of the all-time great games. It's so good.
5242000	5245000	Looking at some comments in chat here, sj100matt says,
5245000	5250000	I remember in early GDQ, they Skyped in Cavanaugh during the run for the game.
5250000	5255000	They broke his own game with glitches in front of him, and his mind was blown.
5255000	5257000	Yes, there is that moment.
5257000	5266000	And I think a lot of people associate this game with a certain era of the Humble Bundle before it became just another shop online.
5266000	5272000	People were really finding some strong indie classics like this through the Humble Bundle,
5272000	5277000	and would still buy them on a platform like the 3DS like I did just because the game's that good.
5277000	5284000	And I saw someone else in chat was saying, oh, yay, I 100%ed this game on 3DS.
5284000	5286000	That's pretty amazing.
5286000	5288000	So great, great Pixar saga.
5288000	5292000	Now I kind of want to play this on stream at some point just because it's so rage-inducing.
5292000	5294000	Maybe I will.
5294000	5298000	It does have that Metroid-like quality that I sure love.
5298000	5300000	I don't know what else to call it.
5300000	5303000	I can only play this game in little bursts before I get really pissed off.
5303000	5305000	Yeah, right?
5305000	5309000	So it's more like, how much do I hate myself and want to scream?
5309000	5311000	And then I'll play that.
5311000	5314000	And then I'll scream, and I'll usually feel better after that and turn the game off.
5314000	5316000	All right.
5316000	5318000	Great pick for the Classic Game of the Week.
5319000	5321000	V, V, V, V, V.
5321000	5326000	Available literally everywhere.
5326000	5328000	I think the only thing you're not going to play that on is a graphing calculator,
5328000	5330000	and to be honest, somebody's probably working on a port.
5331000	5333000	So things to think about.
5333000	5335000	All right.
5335000	5340000	Let's move on and talk about some other news in the gaming industry in rapid-fire news.
5340000	5342000	Loki, we'll go to you.
5342000	5344000	Yeah.
5344000	5350840	We've been talking about a lot of different lawsuits with Sony and dbrand over their face
5350840	5356080	plates and stuff and because Sony was mad that they kind of used the same design.
5356080	5361040	Well now Sony's finally done it and launched their own face plates for the PlayStation
5361040	5362040	five.
5362040	5370160	You can get a bunch of different colors they have pink, light blue, purple, black, and
5370160	5374560	the crimson I guess.
5374560	5379440	Oh here's the official colors cosmic red, midnight black, nova pink, starlight blue,
5379440	5380440	galactic purple.
5380440	5387620	They also have joy cons in that same or the dual shock joy cons because the dual sense
5387620	5392240	five stuff so they have the dual sense controllers as well.
5392240	5397160	So cool you can buy all those accessories for a system you can't buy and those are going
5397160	5400960	to be out in the first half of 2022 assuming scalpers don't get to them in which case they'll
5400960	5403480	be never out again.
5403480	5405700	The pink one looks so good.
5405700	5412000	I don't have a PS5 because I just you know I can't buy one but if I did I would want
5412000	5413000	the pink one.
5413000	5415900	I think it looks cool so someday.
5415900	5421800	Here's the thing that I don't necessarily understand though with these covers like it's
5421800	5426480	cool that it's pink and stuff but how much would you think you would pay for a plastic
5426480	5437840	cover oh I like 20 bucks 30 bucks tops $29.99 these are $55 yeah yeah no thank you no thank
5437840	5441440	you that's why they didn't want the third party folks selling them for cheaper I guess
5441440	5445200	well the dbrand once they they did settle that lawsuit though because the dark plate
5445200	5450580	ones they're available although they're charging $70 for theirs so I don't know if it's necessarily
5450580	5457740	better but it's piece of plastic come on folks going on and then this is kind of cool
5457740	5463020	so you know the last Ghostbusters game that we had was pretty awesome actually and had
5463020	5468900	a lot of the original cast from the movie now we have confirmation apparently that there's
5468900	5474060	going to be a new Ghostbusters game and this is coming from Ernie Hudson who basically
5474060	5479080	said that I just got an email because we're doing another video game they're scheduling
5479080	5484360	it now to do a recording and I'm not sure who's going to do it I know it's me and Danny
5484360	5491380	and I think I'm not sure if we're going to get Billy of course Bill Murray I will do
5491380	5496600	or we'll do anything on it so there'll be another video game one when they bring it
5496600	5501760	out I don't know but it's definitely happening so very cool to hear that they're making another
5501760	5505920	game yeah the new movie seems well received I haven't seen it but it seemed the movie
5505920	5509000	seemed well received so I'm not too surprised to hear they're going to go to another game
5509000	5513840	yes sir there's they've done some really good Ghostbusters games over the year I think about
5513840	5518480	the classic one that was on like Commodore Atari you know all the classic systems that
5518480	5523760	was pretty good for the time and then they did a game for Ghostbusters 2 that I remember
5523760	5527800	playing with my friends and I know the movie was a little and but the game was kind of fun
5527800	5538400	so pretty cool yeah all right dark soccer what do you have so um I'm sorry I'm throwing up a
5538400	5546360	little bit my mouth over over this yeah Netflix is going to be doing a live-action Mega Man no
5546360	5556440	just no please no no that's how I feel I mean cowboy bebop was was pretty cool I mean I need
5556480	5568080	to actually watch a little bit more than just a bit of it yeah cancel yeah but no not not this
5568080	5574240	this isn't something that needs to be live-action I'm sorry it no not at all how are you gonna do
5574240	5582120	this one is he gonna look like the the stupid box art that's no good well you know how you know how
5582120	5587600	they got rid of the model for the Sonic in the Sonic movie well we're just gonna put a helmet
5587600	5595480	on him and that's Mega Man now yeah at any rate it's the the same people that are behind I mean
5595480	5600960	the Witcher which I mean the Witcher was good but I I don't have hopes for this so I'm gonna
5600960	5607520	I'm gonna say no and then for folks who are on Steam it looks like there's a data mine that
5607520	5617280	indicates that Final Fantasy 7 remake intergate is going to be on Steam they found some files in
5617280	5626360	the Epic Game Store release and it indicates a Steamworks folder which tends to go out with
5626360	5634720	the Steam releases so it could be a possibility we'll see I'm sure it'll inevitably come to Steam
5634720	5643520	most of those epics do yeah exactly so I saw an amazing mod though because of course people are
5643520	5648760	already modding the game that's the best thing about it coming to PC where cloud is in the dress
5648760	5653120	from the very beginning in the first scene and so all the cutscenes or you know the stuff that's
5653120	5658920	rendered in the game have him in the dress and it's it's great it's great it was I saw it on
5658920	5663160	Twitter somewhere I have actually a quick story here I was supposed to mention this earlier and I
5663160	5667480	didn't so I'll mention it now when I was talking about minis earlier I was also supposed to bring
5667480	5673360	up this mini and I think it's pretty interesting it is a Sega mini arcade another one so they've
5673360	5679480	already done one but this is a new one the Astro City mini 5 it's a vertical screen mini so it's
5679480	5686680	gonna focus on vertical screen games so I hope you like your shmups they call this also Tate mode
5686680	5695960	for those that speak the lingo there are 22 games that are in the mini V including let's see Gunbird
5695960	5704280	Batsu gun Raiden shark shark shark sonic wings Terra Cresta Zaxxon sounds good yeah there's a
5704280	5708480	lot of a lot of good shooter stuff I recognize some classic games the week from prior in here
5708480	5714880	this definitely seems like something that should be said I would want yeah however in Japan it
5715120	5721120	the only place is coming out right now so you might have to import it it's set to be 19,000 yen
5721120	5727320	which is about the equivalent of 172 dollars so it is a little bit pricey but I mean it is kind of
5727320	5733000	cool some good games in it so definitely worth a look all right let's travel around the world
5733000	5738880	and check out some release dates coming to a retail shelf near you although I don't expect
5738960	5745800	there's a lot this week but I've been surprised before Loki oh you're not gonna be surprised

5870680	5874880	guys and then we'll take some calls if anyone's feeling like doing that in our discord over at
5874880	5881720	vog network.com that's vognetwork.com slash discord let's get to Loki I think this story
5881720	5886600	is really interesting so please look this is kind of a continuation to the one we were talking about
5886600	5894040	a while back it was another video done by people make games who is a documentary group and they had
5894040	5900200	covered some of the stuff the practices on the developer side of roblox and what was going on
5900200	5906600	there how you know kids were being kind of pressured into making games and not really
5906600	5912480	being able to profit from those games because roblox takes such a large cut of the profit on
5912480	5921020	there well as we were talking about with the rest of the industry and the practices there you can
5921020	5927680	only imagine what an unregulated sector of the you know development community that exists outside
5927680	5935200	of the purview of most people how thing is how things are handled there and with children so
5935200	5943240	let's see first off you have a lot of these development groups taking place off-site so
5943240	5948640	they're on discord channels third-party and apparently they're you know there's crunch
5948640	5957200	involved there's you know suspicious business practices you know content moderation that's
5957200	5965640	not really happening for example there's even a marketplace on there where you can get basic it's
5965640	5972160	almost like an auction that you bid for these items and it can be you know thousands of dollars
5972160	5979720	that people are paying for these just like in-game costume pieces that they're putting
5979720	5984040	on their characters so they were talking about some of the developers who made some popular
5984040	5988640	games on roblox where they had a payout of you know a couple thousand dollars they ended up
5988640	5996320	dumping it on a on some in-game items because they're kids and they don't know they're not
5996320	6003080	responsible with money and so along with that responsibility was that and then they they talked
6003080	6011200	about you know how there's different you know developers of one being a developer of this game
6011200	6019000	called sonic simulator who was kicked off the platform for reasons but outside of that though
6019000	6028680	had some troubling relationships with some of the young female developers that he had under him
6028680	6034200	and so just you know sexual harassment so like that so it's basically kind of like the whole
6034200	6040320	game industry but now it's still the game industry you know it's it's not surprising so when we talk
6040320	6047680	about all the like you know terrible behavior in the game industry it just exists everywhere
6047680	6055240	it's not just these big game companies so that's kind of what this was talking about was all of
6055240	6062360	these different issues that are out there that are kind of shocking and some of these you know
6062360	6068920	kind of led people to go you know leave roblox to go develop elsewhere like unity or stuff like that
6068920	6076760	so yikes and oh and by the way roblox is not doing anything about any of these things so they did
6076760	6081240	approach them with you know all the stuff that's going on and they basically gave them a bunch of
6081240	6087680	PR marketing speed mm-hmm that you know hey we have community guidelines you know but they're
6087680	6091920	not doing anything to enforce a lot of these or you know some of the stuff that's happening off
6091920	6097280	platform they're like well it's not on the platform so you know as long as the money's rolling in and
6097280	6104480	the government isn't looking at it who cares exactly so who cares roblox is like mostly children
6104480	6112440	involved in the who cares kids got money too yeah or for example there is there was a guy that was
6112440	6120360	helping you know it was crunching for a long time to work on some game thing that he had kind of
6120360	6124920	taken over and started running and then the people that ran the game they incorporated and they were
6124920	6129960	able to kick him out because you know he doesn't understand contracts and stuff like that and so
6129960	6136200	they were able to basically keep the profits for all that stuff but I think like that like the game
6136200	6145520	the marketplace where you can like bid on stuff the auction house that's just shady especially
6145520	6151320	when there's items they're being sold for like thousands of dollars on there like this is a
6151320	6156760	platform for kids and you're targeting them with thousands of dollars worth of like it's not like
6156760	6162720	items that like start at five dollars and get bid up to that it's they start at thousand like Gucci
6162720	6170400	labeled like things well like a digital item this sounds like a great YouTube to watch if you want
6170400	6177440	to be horrified who is the channel again yeah it's people make games okay I'll have to watch that
6177440	6183960	later I'm I'm in the mood for a horrific documentary all right meanwhile let's counter let's counter
6183960	6190560	that with a feel-good video game very unproblematic except for the name change when it came over
6190560	6196160	stateside let's talk about puzzle bobble puzzle bobble there's a new there's a new at which you
6196160	6202200	might know as bust a move in which case you're wrong but it was released in the u.s. as bust
6202200	6208020	a move several times which is a which really in reality is a legendary dancing game that really
6208020	6216060	needs to come back like it's long overdue at Square Enix the emphasis on Enix anyway but at
6216060	6221060	least the puzzle bobble fans are getting a new game there is a new puzzle bobble in the works
6221060	6226620	at Taito and Taito this isn't room or anything Taito actually announces with the YouTube they
6226620	6232060	are and it was reported by Gamatsu a there was a special video presentation that you can see on
6232060	6239140	YouTube where a director sue Yoshi's shows Aki and the level designer Hidetaka you masa and of
6239140	6244860	course little mascot bub from you know bubble bobble I think there was Bob yep but Bob is in
6244860	6249980	this and you know gets a little look here you know this is the game we have a little pointer
6249980	6256060	and you try to match the bubbles the same color and all that there's only some mock-up stuff you
6256060	6260860	don't really actually see video of the game in motion but they are saying they're gonna take
6261340	6268700	a similar mentality to bubble bobble for friends for player action and family friendly gameplay so
6268700	6273700	that's cute so yeah the four player action looks kind of fun there but yeah so far we don't have
6273700	6282980	a lot besides the fact that they are working on one so cool moving on Dark Sakura so I have so
6282980	6290320	many hopes for this so many fucking hopes so the next Dead by Daylight chapter is going to be
6290320	6298960	bingo as in not the ring the u.s. one although technically is the ring but the Japanese one with
6298960	6307480	Sadako and not that stupid little Samara child it is supposed to be based from the original story
6307480	6314720	which actually makes me think that it's more off of the novel by Suzuki Koji which I have read ring
6314720	6322360	spiral and loop I will tell you right now that the books I've also read birthday and basically
6322360	6329320	I've read all of the Sadako novels and they go in a completely different direction than sort of where
6329320	6334720	they went with the movies just a word of warning there I'm not gonna spoil anything about it but
6334720	6340640	like the spoiler video has like you know the generator you know making its noise because the
6340640	6346320	whole point for survivors in Dead by Daylight is to repair generators so that you can GTFO and
6346320	6355840	then the camera pans over and you see the well and I'm so excited about that the one thing that
6355840	6366360	I am a little bit kind of iffy about is that the the producer behind that is well working on it
6366360	6374520	actually from Kadokawa is Emma Yasuriko who produced the Sadako 3d and Sadako 3d2 I need to
6374520	6382000	see Sadako 3d2 but Sadako 3d was hilariously terrible it was bad and it was so funny like
6382000	6391720	it was what was almost funnier was Sadako versus Kayako Kayako was the onryo from Ju-on the mom
6392560	6399880	okay and I hope that they get it right there's so much they could get right and of course if
6399880	6404440	people are already like oh well it's the spirit 2.0 well duh who do you think the spirit was based
6404440	6412280	off of it's an onryo well I mean a vengeful ghost and and Billy it was one of the first killers in
6412280	6419480	the game who is very much a leather face inspired character and then they got leather face so and
6419560	6425440	they made them different enough they'll find ways to distinguish echo fighters no the thing for me
6425440	6435160	is that I'm wondering how Sadako works as a killer mm-hmm because I mean in the end the deal with
6435160	6441160	with Sadako is that you you have the tape you watch the tape so I wonder if there's gonna be
6441160	6448280	like little TVs hanging around and that you have something like seven cycles in the game or you
6448280	6456440	know something like that before you know it's a head pop like like pig hmm that's how I would do
6456440	6462080	it if I were doing this is I would have her like be able to like climb out of TVs at different
6462080	6469880	places in in the level mm-hmm and you know put like a curse on somebody that if they don't do
6469880	6478880	some action that like maybe it's after 70 seconds or something in it because the games go pretty
6478880	6484960	quickly that you lose a health state or something like that that kind of makes me think of how I
6484960	6491160	would do that but I just would say I think about how the game recently lost demogorgon I mean yes
6491160	6494800	if you already bought demogorgon he's still there so they can't exactly just make even though well
6494800	6500400	since Loki said echo killer you know what's interesting they do have echo survivors basically
6500400	6505840	that like for example you know you have Cheryl Mason has like three different echo skins
6505840	6511360	available where you get like James Sunderland is one of them where James is Cheryl but just
6511360	6516920	a lot of creepypasta yeah so but anyway but that cosmetic hacking we have yet to see an echo killer
6516920	6522040	I actually think that's a rad idea not for this but just in general and in the future I think the
6522080	6527600	idea of an echo killer is actually pretty well actually I take that back pinhead had the
6527600	6532080	Cenobite we do have there's the chatter which are technically different even though there's from the
6532080	6535680	same franchise well she doesn't even do the chatter thing so what's the point as this well
6535680	6539960	the pinhead doesn't say his lines either but anyway we digress echo killer would be cool the
6539960	6546840	box and I came now anyway I was gonna say the game did lose demogorgon as a new character but
6546840	6550600	I could see something like with instead of the week we call them buttholes but they're they're
6550600	6555720	portals that demogorgon opens on the ground transport yeah from one place on the map to
6555720	6559640	another I could see something like that with like the TV mechanic like you're talking about where
6559640	6564800	maybe the TVs are already placed and Sadako does something with that to be able to move around the
6564800	6571840	map quickly yeah I have hopes for this it's probably one of my favorite movie and book
6571840	6578400	series I mean I have read ring spiral loop and birthday like so many times for the record Suzuki
6578400	6586560	Koji is also the guy who wrote dark water though and dark water was actually a collection of short
6586560	6591760	stories but the movie that came out that the u.s. film was based off of was based off of a short
6591760	6601080	story in his book he's like iconic horror writer and I'm I'm really hoping that we see a lot more
6601080	6605320	I don't know if we're gonna get a survivor with this one it doesn't sound like it looks like she's
6605320	6609120	gonna be a standalone killer it does sound like we're getting a survivor I was gonna add because
6609120	6613120	there was a comment there was a quote where they said something like survivor mains have something
6613120	6617960	to look forward to as well I mean that could have been around roundabout comment I think it's
6617960	6622240	something is dead by daylight producer said and I was gonna ask you because I'm familiar with the
6622240	6626840	ring you know like ever tons of people saw that movie that came out I'm less familiar with ring
6626840	6630720	ooh so I was gonna ask you like who does the survivor end up being in this is there a likely
6631120	6643360	for that in the first movie it was the first main character her name was Reiko and she was I believe
6643360	6652640	she was an actress I might be thinking of June 2 but no the first no Reiko was she was now she
6652640	6658800	also was I have to go back and look at actually I'm thinking I'm probably thinking of June instead
6658800	6667200	but the first character in the in the the Japanese movies was a female protagonist but in the books
6667200	6676640	it was a male protagonist who was a journalist interest and he has this other friend who was
6676640	6683160	like this person behind like like programming and epidemiology in the book mm-hmm so I'll go
6683160	6687160	ahead and say a little bit more about the books themselves focused more on the viral aspect of
6687160	6694400	the video and copying the video and how showing it to other people spreads like a virus right
6694400	6702880	until Sadako is taking over everybody in this environment and if I really go too much into it
6702880	6711120	it is absolutely gonna spoil the novels and I want everybody to read them they're so good but the
6711120	6717280	original the original protagonist in the books is is like is a man and his family and his family
6717280	6724520	watches the the video so there there's there's so many different ways that they could go with it I'm
6724520	6733480	really excited and for me being a loner about this and then knowing the the lore behind behind the
6733480	6743960	movie it's a gosh and the the original ring came out in 98 yeah it her name it was Reiko I did
6743960	6752240	remember right the characters name was was Reiko and I just really really really really have some
6752240	6760120	high hopes behind us on top of that it if we were gonna have other survivors in there there could
6760120	6768160	also be he told me who was the assistant to the person that she saw to get advice about the
6768160	6774800	videotape and he watched it but it was my who found his body my ends up being like a main
6774800	6781280	character and one of the other stories too I just I'm really really really super excited about it
6781280	6787000	it's or you know what we could have this is here's a thought Rob uh-huh what if we have Sadako as
6787000	6793920	both a killer and a survivor that could be the interesting twist about survivor means who knows
6793920	6802280	it could be very interesting because her origin story she was actually a victim I think something
6802280	6808120	is really interesting about Dead by Daylight is the way that they kind of get licenses you know
6808120	6811920	because I think it's interesting it really sounds to me like I know they say oh it's gonna be
6811920	6816360	influenced by the movies but it really sounds like they license from the book because I think it was
6816360	6822040	the publisher of the book that made comments about you know the the the but they're working
6822040	6829640	with the the producer of the last two movies interesting but I think it's gonna be they're
6829640	6836080	gonna pick and choose from the Japanese licenses yeah I guess where it makes sense but it exactly
6836080	6840760	but it's also interesting they did go to Ringu where you know they could have tried to do the
6840760	6845840	ring and done it that way and and you know be dealing with a nine-year-old character a nine-year
6845840	6849720	old killer that might be a little weird yeah well and the other thing too I still think it's pretty
6849720	6854920	ridiculous that they have chatterer in there as as we were saying as an echo skin because technically
6854920	6861840	in lore if you watch Hellraiser 2 chatterer is a ten-year-old boy oh but you want to know something
6861840	6868000	else about this with it actually being Sadako instead of it you know in any of the u.s. ones
6868000	6877400	it's gonna be the first intersex character I've yeah in Dead by Daylight or maybe in almost any
6877400	6884840	game practically I would think I'll encourage me if I'm wrong indie games I'm sure but I just it's
6884840	6890360	nice to see that representation on a large scale in something a lot of people don't know about the
6890360	6896320	original series I mean it wasn't even brought up until like much later into the stories that
6896320	6904600	Sadako part of you know what led to some of her problems is that she was born intersex hmm female
6904600	6910160	identifying um so I was just to say a minute ago with the Dead by Daylight licensing I think it's
6910160	6913680	just interesting that they kind of you know went that direction you know they've done some clever
6913680	6917720	things to get some of the things they want in the game like I always think about like ghost face
6917720	6925120	the ghost face being in Dead by Daylight has nothing to do with scream people it people jump
6925200	6930960	to that conclusion but it has nothing to do with scream because even when the movies got ghost
6930960	6935680	faces the killer it was literally a mask that they found at a Halloween store and they licensed the
6935680	6940640	mask so that is exactly what Dead by Daylight they licensed the mask so that's why you don't have
6940640	6945640	Sidney Prescott or any of that as survivors although I think we'd all love it if like Sidney
6945640	6949960	Prescott or Casey or somebody showed up as survivors in the game I guess maybe that it was
6949960	6954840	much cheaper to pay the makers of the ghost face mask and then if you read the lore he's
6954840	6959640	like a photographer in the Midway it's nothing to do with the movies nothing to do the movies
6959640	6965080	I just think it's yeah his name is Danny something yeah but I also though I was still highly
6965080	6970280	disappointed that they did remake Freddy and I mean Quentin don't get me wrong he's pretty now
6970280	6976840	I'm happy with Quentin now but I would have played survivor in a heartbeat if Nancy like
6976840	6983720	Heather Lang and Cams Nancy oh yeah that'd be cool or even better Alice I would love to see a
6983720	6989560	classic Freddy thing show up even if Freddy is already in the game anyway I want Alice as a
6989560	6994360	fucking survivor not another Dead by Daylight tangent all right we better go to another story
6994360	7000040	okay I know I know but just in general though like two of my favorite things you know having
7000040	7005800	a really weird looking baby makes me happy oh sure I get it I get it yeah all right I'm giddy
7005800	7014680	moving on Loki all right so uh CD Projekt Red has finally settled a lawsuit regarding Cyberpunk
7014680	7022520	2077 they this is from the investors who say that basically they were lied to and that the game was
7022520	7029960	virtually unplayable so got to make sure those investors are taken care of um so yes they are
7029960	7037000	going to be awarded 1.85 million dollars unfortunately that doesn't take care of any of
7037000	7044760	the players that had to wait so long for this to become actually playable or yeah it seems the
7044760	7049080	game's in much better shape now at least that's the narrative a lot of the fans are trying to put
7049080	7052760	out there on the internet is that hey come back and visit this game it's a lot better which to be
7052760	7058040	fair you know things like No Man's Sky Diablo 3 they reinvented so there's no reason why Cyberpunk
7058040	7064120	2077 can't be in that so actually my mistake so I I was confused there's two different lawsuits so
7064120	7069080	there's one from the investors this is actually a class action lawsuit that came out of California
7069080	7074280	and so same outcome though no one's gonna get any money because this is a class action lawsuit and
7074280	7079960	the lawyers get money that's someone gets two dollars yeah you can you can file to get a check
7079960	7087480	for 87 cents probably yeah hey I actually one time cashed a class action lawsuit check for five
7087480	7093560	dollars and got myself dinner with it so there you go yeah all right um moving on one more story
7093560	7098040	tonight and it is a sad one and uh you may not know this name but you would definitely know
7098040	7104920	uh her contributions to gaming and pop culture uh unfortunately we lost Vera Lanfer Pacheco
7104920	7111960	uh this week uh most well known I think in the gaming circles as the voice of Daphne Princess
7111960	7119560	Daphne in Dragon's Lair so unfortunately um yeah so she's passed away uh don't know the cause um
7119560	7126760	but uh production designer Don Bluth who was a huge imaginative mind behind Dragon's Lair Space
7126760	7131800	Ace you know games of that era uh mentioned uh the passing in a social media post saying I am
7131800	7138120	saddened by the news of my friend Vera's passing she was a spark that lit up the room um I cherish
7138120	7142040	all of the time we work together and she will surely be missed not only for her artistic
7142040	7146840	talents but for her wonderful personality that she gave to all who knew her we'll miss you Vera
7146840	7153320	rest in peace some other credits under Vera's name Pete's Dragon Banjo the Woodpile Cat
7153320	7159880	Secret of Nim which is kind of a cult classic uh for fucking love it adults of a certain age who
7159880	7166120	were kids and that was also Don Bluth behind that yeah exactly so Don Bluth and Vera worked together
7166120	7173160	quite a bit so um it's no surprise she showed up as Princess Daphne really so um an unfortunate
7173160	7179880	she was didn't she also voice um the one in Space Ace or am I wrong it's not it's not in this story
7179880	7187080	so I'd have to pull up her IMDB but yeah uh Dar Tetsuya in chat says yeah saw that one around
7187080	7191240	discord in the internet not super familiar with Dragon's Lair but still sad you should
7191240	7198120	watch a playthrough and remember that the game came out in like 1983 I think and I'm sure Dark
7198120	7202120	Soccer has done it as a classic game but it probably was some time ago at this point because
7202120	7207880	that segment's been going on for 10 years um but uh the the the segment can be a classic game of
7207880	7212360	the week soon I still have no idea what my new special segment's gonna be for the record
7213480	7219480	I seem to recall last year you figured it out the week of so there's no hurry probably yeah um but
7219480	7225160	anyway uh yeah like it's it's worth watching a playthrough and kind of like just to and remember
7225880	7232440	uh the time of the era that it is and the fact that a game looked like that in 1983 I mean sure
7232440	7237640	they were quote-unquote cheating using a video disc to do it but still it was it was groundbreaking
7237640	7242920	at the time and the animation just really uh gave it that extra level and how consider of them to
7242920	7248840	put a tv on top of the cabinet so that we could all watch yeah yeah right yeah uh Dar Tetsuya says
7248840	7254360	I do remember seeing it on Starrcade if G4 ever re-airs it I'll give it a close watch that's if
7254360	7261880	I forgot that there's a new G4 let's see how long that lasts until that until you mention that yeah
7261880	7266360	I guess uh must see television it's not that I haven't forgot about it but it's only on tv
7266360	7272920	or it's not only on tv they have like episodes but I just can't be bothered it's kind of like
7272920	7277800	how it is right now I just I just I enjoy watching twitch that's just kind of where I'm at right now
7278360	7285240	if there's a twitch channel that was all tech tv oh and uh fifth dream says Starrcade is on
7285240	7291080	it well now that that's television worth watching is it new Starrcade or is it old Starrcade I think
7291080	7297560	it's old Starrcade I I we're gonna make a new Starrcade I I if they if they had launched a
7297560	7301640	new Starrcade I would have already bitched about whoever they got to host it and why I would have
7302040	7309800	host so uh they they haven't that story hasn't crossed the desk yet so all right we are to the
7309800	7313320	point in the show where we're going to invite you guys to participate with the show we take
7313320	7319240	your emails participate at orange lounge radio.com and we welcome your calls over in our green room
7319240	7326440	over at voggenetwork.com slash discord yeah voggenetwork.com slash discord um let's open
7326440	7329320	up the mailbag I don't think there was anything in there but it could be wrong there's nothing
7330280	7335560	well well well participate at orange launch radio.com and maybe we can discuss your query
7335560	7342200	in a future week um let's see oh yeah fifth dream says if they did a new Starrcade it would be all
7342200	7350280	ticket games now mobile Starrcade oh why can't it be classic games why does it have to be newer
7350280	7356040	games classic games I don't think they would have to do they wouldn't do mobile games because no one
7356120	7360040	cares about that or ticket games no one cares about that it's just what's in the arcade it's
7360040	7365000	what kids play because they want to win they don't play it's it's a means to an end basically
7365000	7369240	and Starrcade missed the entirety of the 90s there's a whole other generation of arcade games
7369240	7373880	that could be represented that I think would be really cool anyway we do have a caller waiting in
7373880	7378440	the green room so let's bring them on to the program and see what they have to say hello you
7378440	7385800	are on orange launch radio who is this hello this is pixel pakas hey good to hear from you what's
7385800	7392120	up um I just wanted to like talk about a game that I've been playing lately please um because
7392120	7398360	like it's not getting the attention I feel it really should be um and I love these types of
7398360	7404840	calls let's give it some attention what is it yeah so the game is called uh garage bad dream
7404840	7412840	adventure and um it just released I think this past week on mobile so ios and android maybe
7412840	7418280	that's why it's not getting a lot of discussion since it's not like on steam or consoles um
7419240	7425720	but what is so interesting about this game and what like drew me to it is the fact that I've
7425720	7432680	been following this game for a long time because um garage actually came out in 1999 um in japan
7433400	7440920	on pc it was a super limited game and um somewhere in the like 2010s
7441800	7446200	english speakers started to notice it and were like I want to see like what is this game
7446840	7451880	um because it has like this kind of hr gieger-esque look to it it's a point-and-click
7451880	7458040	adventure but it's kind of disturbing and weird and so people kind of in the west were treating
7458040	7462920	this as like a lost game because there was nothing about it online there was no way to
7462920	7470280	download it nobody had ever uploaded it um nobody had copies of it and so eventually someone did buy
7470280	7478280	a copy for like over a thousand dollars um and you know released it online but um still it was
7478280	7484360	in japanese so you had to understand japanese or have some way to kind of play it um but last year
7484360	7490040	there was a japanese like basically a japanese kickstarter um on a different website of course
7490040	7500200	but to basically modernize it release it again and translate it into english so from 1999 to 2021
7500200	7506760	it's finally available officially in english and um I've been playing it and I think it's quite
7506760	7515880	good quite strange um it's like this weird mechanical world where people it's not people
7515880	7521400	I guess it's the robots that live in sewers um but it's pretty cool and I've been having a lot
7521400	7526440	of fun with it so far um I googled it on my phone while you're talking about it and it looks it looks
7526440	7532200	scary and weird and right up there it looks right up dark sakura's alley yeah absolutely what's it
7532200	7540760	called again garage like a garage door uh garage bad dream adventure okay and yeah the original
7540760	7546840	was in 1999 and I was looking at published by toshiba emi which kind of made me laugh
7546840	7551560	because all the uh they did all the dance mania albums that ddr music came from but I guess
7551560	7559000	they're a huge publisher I wonder if it's an ios game if I can play it on my mac mini one way to
7559400	7563480	interesting because then I can stream it yeah that would be good I'm playing it on my pic
7563480	7567720	my chromebook which also plays it's I mean a different thing but similar concept because
7567720	7573720	it will play the google play games and so I was streaming it through that hold on it's not in the
7573720	7580440	app store it is oh not on the app store I guess I don't know apple so but it is on ios well I mean
7580440	7586440	but I it's not one of the ones that's compatible for um for mac m1 so okay oh bummer I'll have to
7586440	7590280	find another way to do it it looks cool though it totally does look like it's up my alley
7591320	7597320	yeah definitely it's very strange creepy but not super it's not like horror it's more of the look
7597320	7605000	that's kind of weird um there's even a bit of humor in it at times so it's definitely worth
7605000	7610760	a look and because this version is made in unity I feel like they could if they wanted to they could
7610760	7615800	bring this to steam in the future or even a console if they wanted to and I think they should
7617320	7621240	huh it definitely looks interesting thank you have you streamed this at all I know
7621240	7625000	peaceful pockets I catch you on twitch once in a great while doing something did you stream this
7625000	7629560	one at all yeah I've been playing it I started playing it on Friday so I've been just doing
7629560	7635880	little streams here and there randomly um and so far it's been good it's not like one of those
7635880	7641240	really mean point-and-click adventures where you die everywhere randomly um I did die once but
7641320	7646520	but I think it was my own fault I walked under a like crushing machine so I should have known what
7646520	7653080	happened uh but yeah I think it's fun and I would recommend it for sure it's only like five dollars
7653080	7660520	so from one thousand dollars on an auction to five dollars absolutely yeah whoever bought it's like
7661480	7667640	what was I thinking and I'm unfortunately even though thinking uh unfortunately even though
7667640	7672760	dark sakura pointed out it's not available on her mini I did search my iphone uh and it is it
7672760	7677960	is on the iphone app store available yeah that's what I was saying is that it's not one of the ones
7677960	7684680	that's compatible in the m1 um fifth dream in chat says wow boobs saw video skipped ahead tada

7779560	7784520	a lot of the big game releases for the year have already happened the reality is just it's a slow
7784520	7788680	time I'm kind of surprised we had a full show role as it is there was enough news for that um
7788680	7792760	but probably not a lot more outside of that I guess I guess we had to get into youtube
7792760	7797560	documentaries to really fill it fill it out but that is a good one was worth talking about yeah
7797560	7803560	so all right well if that is it let me just peek one more time all right yeah nobody's in there so
