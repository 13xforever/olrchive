1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,280
It's the end of the year, and all through the net, money was flying, fortunes were set.

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,520
But some gaming execs who were told of this bet, they weren't to cash in, but pushback

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,520
was met.

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,760
This topic is boring, but the news now is light.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,560
Ignoring it is detrimental, so we'll discuss it this night.

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,920
I typed up this intro, reciting it by sight.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,040
It's not iambic pentameter, but it gets the job done right.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,040
It's time for the show.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,280
Orange Lounge Radio begins with your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki, to talk

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,600
gaming topics herein.

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:45,160
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,360
where every gamer has a voice.

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,960
It is another episode of Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 897 of our show

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,900
for this December the 26th of 2021.

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,040
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joined by my co-hosts.

16
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,700
First off, I want to give a special shout out to our voiceover guy, Jason, for that

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,700
intro tonight.

18
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,860
He deserves a Grammy for that, just saying.

19
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,980
But also say hello to my co-hosts, who probably also deserve a Grammy, because what does a

20
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,380
Grammy really mean anyway?

21
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,980
Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

22
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,500
I could use a gram of something.

23
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,020
Hey, do you know what today is, Dark Sakura?

24
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,020
Boxing day.

25
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,740
It is boxing day, but it's also, more importantly, my half birthday.

26
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,860
So happy half birthday to me.

27
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,860
So there you go.

28
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,980
I'm 43 and a half today.

29
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,500
So that's like, what, four, three, one, two.

30
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,660
It kind of sounds like it's like an Intellivision release date that they're going to miss or

31
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,660
something like that.

32
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,660
I don't know.

33
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,660
Just the numerology thing.

34
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,660
So there you go.

35
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,940
Birthdays, aren't they fun?

36
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,420
Say hello to Forever Young tech master Loki, also joining us.

37
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,540
Well, you know, I don't know.

38
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,260
They can keep making updates.

39
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,540
It's kind of like how they predict the end of the world.

40
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,580
You know, they'll throw dates out until eventually one of them make it OK.

41
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:03,100
What comes out first in television, Amico or the apocalypse, the Mayans predicted?

42
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,100
Which first?

43
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,460
Or Trump is reinstated as president, you know?

44
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,980
No, no, no, no.

45
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,660
I keep throwing out stuff.

46
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,980
Or what is the banned phrase on the show or that JFK is going to come back or something

47
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,980
like that?

48
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,580
Like, that was the other one.

49
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,580
But yeah.

50
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,620
All right.

51
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,100
We're going to get into our kickoff topic in a minute.

52
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,260
We're doing something a little different for our kickoff topic here.

53
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,020
But first, Dark Sakura, we've got to talk about the holiday.

54
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,220
I hope everybody out there had a great holiday.

55
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,660
And whether you celebrate Christmas or not, because Dark Sakura, I know you don't really

56
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,740
celebrate Christmas, but what you I don't know, I don't put the word to mouth.

57
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,220
You celebrate presents, presents day.

58
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,180
I don't celebrate it as a religious holiday.

59
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,180
I got you.

60
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,340
There's certainly plenty of people that are like that, but I think there's certainly plenty

61
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:58,100
of people where it's like, Christmas is kind of a, it's about Santa and lights and Frosty

62
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,820
the Snowman, but not, you know, that's what it's about for them.

63
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,340
But anyway, my point is, is that it's also about getting together with people you like.

64
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,260
And so Dark Sakura and I, or sometimes don't like, but in my case, it was people I like,

65
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,720
Dark Sakura and I hung out yesterday on the said holiday.

66
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,900
And that was fun.

67
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,180
So I just want to say thank you, Dark Sakura, and publicly embarrass you for having us over.

68
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,020
Because for those that don't follow my Twitter feed, my original Christmas plans with family

69
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,020
got screwed up.

70
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:32,180
And I'm not going to get into the details on the show, but there's somebody irresponsible

71
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,180
in my family.

72
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,180
It's not me.

73
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,180
That's all we're going to say.

74
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,700
And they managed to screw up Christmas plans.

75
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,320
So Alan and I were kind of left without something to do.

76
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,500
And so I was like, what's Dark Sakura doing on December 25th?

77
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,540
And she was like, come over, come over.

78
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,540
Let's have pizza.

79
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,540
We'll have fun.

80
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,540
Play pinball.

81
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,540
And it was.

82
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,540
We had a good time.

83
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,540
And that happened.

84
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,540
Yes.

85
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,540
Exactly.

86
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:01,660
I have to say I was really proud of myself that me in height of lack of medication managed

87
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,660
to keep.

88
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,980
I only forgot how to say words I think three times the entire night.

89
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,260
You were extremely normal last night.

90
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,840
So for what it's worth, is that a compliment?

91
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,260
It's supposed to be.

92
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,220
Well, it's been really hard.

93
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,060
I have to say that unmedicated Jamie is a lot bitchier than medicated Jamie.

94
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,420
That's not an agreement.

95
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,420
It's a huh.

96
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,420
I understand.

97
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,420
Yeah.

98
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,420
Yeah.

99
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:32,460
It's I'm glad I only have like another week to go of this because my test is on the fourth.

100
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,460
You got this.

101
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,460
You got this.

102
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,460
Yeah.

103
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,460
Going to some.

104
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,460
It was me normal.

105
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,460
Just go into some comments and chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at the

106
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,660
voice of geeks network, twitch.tv slash vog network at nine o'clock Eastern six p.m. Pacific

107
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,740
right after the Bobby black will show again that's twitch.tv slash vog network VOG network.

108
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,220
But of course, we're available on demand in many podcast apps.

109
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,580
I want to say at the start of the show, Spotify for Christmas, which I know a lot of people

110
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,080
use that to listen to podcasts, just added podcast ratings.

111
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,820
So for you Spotify peeps, I know some of you are Apple podcast peeps, I know some of you

112
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,020
are like Google Play podcast.

113
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,680
For you Spotify peeps.

114
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,680
Do me a favor.

115
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,460
Do me a solid go in and rate five stars for orange launch radio.

116
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,460
Much appreciated.

117
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,460
Mwah.

118
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,460
Okay.

119
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,460
Just want to get that up at the top of the show.

120
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:25,140
Now to some comments over twitch.tv slash vog network e3 vl was suggesting Half Life

121
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,140
three.

122
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,140
What happens first?

123
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,140
The Intellivision amico or Half Life three.

124
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,800
That was a good one to throw in there.

125
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,060
Bobby Black Wolf talking about Christmas saying I celebrate the secular marketing holiday that

126
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,540
is on December 25th.

127
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,540
Bingo.

128
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:43,300
Um, let's see, um, Sia Tabiri says Christmas is the day of rest after jingle visits.

129
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,100
I believe that is an animal crossing reference, right Jamie?

130
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,220
I still haven't touched the upgrades yet.

131
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,220
Oh, bummer.

132
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,820
We got to get into that.

133
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:57,300
Um, and, uh, Bobby Black Wolf kind of referencing, uh, my time spent, uh, at dark, dark soccer's

134
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,500
house yesterday, Rob sent me a picture and I was like, enjoy your time in pinball heaven.

135
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,500
Yes.

136
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,660
I wanted to send him a picture of your Mando machine.

137
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,720
You've probably already sent him one, but I want to send him a picture of your Mando

138
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,180
machine because the only other place I've played that table was at Bobby's house.

139
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,780
So it was kind of funny that like, I've never played this game anywhere, but at people's

140
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,100
houses one on the east coast, west coast.

141
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,100
Yeah.

142
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:26,100
Well he has some type of super special table too, but yeah, you have that like actual grow

143
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,380
goo in the table.

144
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,380
Yeah.

145
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,460
So Dan's friend, um, who runs, uh, coin op here in town.

146
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,460
Oh shit.

147
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,460
Okay.

148
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,740
Um, there's a mod for the Mandalorian that has an animatronic grow goo in it.

149
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,740
Yeah.

150
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,740
And it looks good.

151
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,740
It's cute.

152
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,740
Exactly.

153
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:50,620
So we, um, when it came up, you know, Dan just went and bought like the little animatronic

154
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,900
figure from target and his friend, uh, installed it.

155
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,860
So now ours moves around and does weird shit and is creepier than ever.

156
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:06,100
I will say something that dark soccer doesn't always represent clearly on this show.

157
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,900
I'm going to put it in very clear terms is how well cared for all of those pinball tables

158
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,900
are.

159
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,900
I mean, of course.

160
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,900
Well, yeah.

161
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,660
I mean, that's, that's mr dark soccer that does a lot of that upkeep, but, um, I still,

162
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,840
those, those machines and there's many machines in your house.

163
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,820
There's like six in the garage.

164
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,220
You have one another four in the office.

165
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:30,420
Then you have like two in the living room, two in the little side area slash dining room.

166
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:38,780
There's six outside in Dan's office, two in the living room and three in the dining

167
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,780
area.

168
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,300
So that's 13 in the house.

169
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,480
We have, I think two loaned out.

170
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,820
Now I want to be clear.

171
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,860
It makes it sound like they live in a hoarder house.

172
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,340
It is not that case at all.

173
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:56,140
We do know it's re it's really not the way they make those pinball machines and fit them

174
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,140
in.

175
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,140
It actually works.

176
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,580
Like, you know, especially like in your dining area in the living room, like you fit them

177
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,980
in and strategical places where like, Oh, this is just, these people love pinball and

178
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,980
it's awesome.

179
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,980
Yeah.

180
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,980
Yeah.

181
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,980
It really works.

182
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,980
In the living room is Star Trek and creature from the black lagoon.

183
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:21,060
And then outside we have, we have the two, the two Jersey Jack ones, which is, uh, AC DC,

184
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,060
not AC DC.

185
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,260
We have, uh, we have pirates and we have, um, guns and roses.

186
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,420
Yeah.

187
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,700
Dan was telling me about that pirates and what a score that one is.

188
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,380
That's like one out of 150 machines or something.

189
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,380
Yeah.

190
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,300
That pirate one was really, and then we've got, we have AC DC cause Dan, I made that

191
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,460
happen for Dan, thanks to, uh, work stocks.

192
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,460
Yeah.

193
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,220
Um, but I want to say, wait, before you, before you go in the inventory, like I wanted to

194
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,960
say about the actual tables is that the upkeep is done very well.

195
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,100
For example, you guys have a theater of magic and you know, I'm going to recognize that

196
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,980
table as one of my all times favorites.

197
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:00,100
But the thing about, well, the thing about it, when you look at the table, like the box

198
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,620
is not all faded like it is on most machines, you're going to see it, uh, a bowling alley

199
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,400
or a bar or whatever, you know, cause it's a pretty popular table.

200
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,960
Your boxes and the, like, there's even like the little chain around the top, which I have

201
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,420
never seen intact.

202
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,300
Oh, that's why, okay.

203
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,540
So I have a story about this one.

204
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,540
Okay.

205
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,540
Quick.

206
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,580
I don't want to inventory all the machines cause it's a video game show, but this one

207
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,540
has got a special story to it.

208
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,540
Okay.

209
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:32,740
So it came up, um, at work we've got, uh, well at the time it was like a, an email mailing

210
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:39,940
list that we had and now we have a Slack chat for it, but one of the, the higher up engineers

211
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:45,620
at the company I work for, um, said, Hey, I'm selling a theater of magic, you know,

212
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,080
in San Jose, you know, blah, blah, blah.

213
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,540
And I messaged him as like, well, what do you want for it?

214
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,460
And then I, you know, I played messenger with Dan and we're like, well, let's just make

215
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,340
this happen.

216
00:09:54,340 --> 00:10:00,900
So we went, um, to San Jose to pick it up and it, it was a fully shopped thing.

217
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,260
We bought extra plastics.

218
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,260
We bought a different versions of, of the, of the, the box.

219
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,580
So we've got all kinds of extra stuff that came with it and he was really fair about

220
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,700
it, but the day that we bought it was our 13th anniversary.

221
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:21,060
So on the bios, when the game boots up, it says happy 13th, Dan and Jamie, that's so

222
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,060
cute.

223
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,060
I love that.

224
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,780
We went and got melody for this.

225
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,780
There you go.

226
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,180
Um, Loki, Loki, I don't want to leave you out.

227
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,320
I w I know right now it's probably hard to think about collectibles because the kids

228
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,340
are still a little rowdy there at that age, but you know, in three or four more years,

229
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,020
you know, the kids are going to be a little more grown up and probably settled down a

230
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,020
little bit.

231
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,020
Yeah.

232
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,200
They'll have problems of a different sort, but you don't have to worry about them wrecking

233
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
pinball tables.

234
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,980
Are you, are you thinking about getting into collecting anything additional?

235
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,980
I don't know.

236
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:58,500
I pinball tables or anything along those lines, Loki, I know the room in my house for anything.

237
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,900
He wants to collect a new house.

238
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,540
I understand.

239
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,420
I need, I need rooms to start collections of things.

240
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,340
I already have an arcade cabinet and a broken arcade cabinet.

241
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,340
So all right.

242
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,960
Well, how many years till Josh is 18 and moves out?

243
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,460
That's when you get to start collecting.

244
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,460
Yeah.

245
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,460
Riley.

246
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,020
He's moving out of 18.

247
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,620
That's very optimistic of you.

248
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,260
All right.

249
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,260
Fair enough.

250
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,260
All right.

251
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,260
I try to include low key in the conversation.

252
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,260
It's fine.

253
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,260
Anyway.

254
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,260
Uh, dark soccer.

255
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,260
Thanks for having us over yesterday.

256
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,260
Uh, we had a good time.

257
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,260
Oh, I should have been sure.

258
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,560
I know it's a little bit of our gaming weeks, but whatever.

259
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,980
It's a holiday show.

260
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,660
Y'all know there's hardly any news this week, so we have time for extra shit.

261
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,660
Okay.

262
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,980
Um, you got one of those little, and this has come up on the show before, but, um, you

263
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,340
got one of those little mini DDR cabinets that look like, you know, one of the little

264
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,500
mini, um, arcade machines, but it's, Oh, you have it out in front of you.

265
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,500
Thank you.

266
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,340
It's actually, but it's dance, dance revolution.

267
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,980
And so I got to check that out a little bit.

268
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,980
Super cute.

269
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:03,140
Um, I, the, the actual DDR that's in it is a little, um, rough.

270
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:08,820
It's kind of like game boy DDR, because what bothered me is that the arrows don't flash

271
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,560
to the beat of the music.

272
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,340
And for me, that's a crucial part of getting my timing right in DDR is being able to see

273
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,340
the flashing of the air.

274
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:21,140
They kind of pulse in an actual, uh, DDR machine, but you know, as far as a mini goes, it's

275
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:26,300
super cute and really cool to be reminiscent.

276
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Yes.

277
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,300
A little bit.

278
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,300
What songs are in it?

279
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,820
It's a paranoia, make it better and, uh, keep on moving.

280
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,820
Yeah.

281
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,820
And that is literally it.

282
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,820
Yeah.

283
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,260
They're all Konami originals, but of course I'm keeping it in its little box because the

284
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,940
artwork on this is classic.

285
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,940
Yeah.

286
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,940
Yeah.

287
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:48,060
I was wondering how long until someone mods, one of those things to play already happened.

288
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:52,340
What, what kind of, how do those things, maybe, you know, Loki, or maybe, you know, dark soccer,

289
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,780
cause I don't, what, what's actually powering the emulation in that thing or what is that

290
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:03,620
running off of the one who modded it actually gutted it and put in like a raspberry pie.

291
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:10,020
Ah, that kind of like, I think that this can't really take anything extra.

292
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,020
I mean, it's dinky.

293
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,740
It's three entire songs.

294
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,740
Yeah.

295
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,300
Granted, they're in good quality, but the person who also, the mod that we saw, like

296
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,060
they modded the lights and everything, what I wish we had gotten with something like the

297
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:30,820
Pump It Up that they got where, um, it's like, I mean, it's kind of hard to tell through

298
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,220
my webcam, but it's about, of course, twice as wide as that with a widescreen monitor,

299
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,580
but it has two dance pads on it that come out like controllers.

300
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,420
Oh, that's really cool.

301
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,420
And so you can play along with it.

302
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,420
Yeah.

303
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,620
Some comments in chat, YYR in chat says it's not an emulation as far as I know.

304
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,060
It's just a newly programmed thing.

305
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,060
Yeah.

306
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,060
I should've, I should've said that.

307
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,060
Yeah.

308
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,700
Cause it's not clearly based on any existing version of DDR cause it's so part, I would

309
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,900
say it's even more parsed back than the Game Boy version.

310
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,900
You know what, if they ever put...

311
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,900
It's DDR.

312
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:09,900
It's, it's more of a DD, DD skirmish, dance, dance skirmish, or DD yarns, dance, dance

313
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,220
disagreement, dance, dance resolution.

314
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,300
Um, anyway, uh, YYR says it's not an emulation as far as I know.

315
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,780
It's just a newly programmed thing.

316
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,780
Yeah.

317
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,580
It's, it's what, uh, DDR would have looked like on an Atari 2600, but slightly better

318
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,580
graphics.

319
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,980
No, it looks better than that.

320
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,980
It does look better than that.

321
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,980
Uh, Orange Right says...

322
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,500
I mean, it looks good for its stinky little screen and everything.

323
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,980
For what it is, for a dinky little $20 thing, it's, it's very clearly a toy that lights

324
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,980
up.

325
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,980
That's what it is.

326
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,980
And it is the basic steps.

327
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,460
Like both of them are all like the basic charts for those three songs.

328
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:46,500
Go into that little gear thing on the very beginning and you can put it in another and

329
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
master and maniac.

330
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,740
So you can play them in the harder songs modes too.

331
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:55,140
But I'm saying just when you pick it up and play it, they're all like the step charts.

332
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,140
Got it.

333
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,140
Got it.

334
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,140
Oh yeah.

335
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,140
The actuals.

336
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,140
Yeah.

337
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,140
Yeah.

338
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,140
Yeah.

339
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,140
For sure.

340
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,140
And the little graphic on it is great.

341
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,140
It looks like just, it doesn't have anyone dancing on it or anything, you know, but it

342
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,140
is like classic DDR.

343
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,140
Yeah.

344
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,300
All right.

345
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:13,260
Um, Bobby Blackwell in chat says, so a lot of these games, more likely old TV games actually

346
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,580
use an NES chip.

347
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:20,700
A lot of the TV games in the 2000 and 2010s are actually just running NES on a chips.

348
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,020
So, um, I don't think it's even an NES thing in those.

349
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,580
I think it's even parse back than that, but, um, you know, it gets the job done.

350
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,300
I think the cutest part is watching the little dance pad light up and things like that.

351
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:37,460
I mean, this is no substitute for digging out your PlayStation and popping in dance

352
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,020
dance revolution, third mix.

353
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,660
It's no substitute for that.

354
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,700
It's just an, it isn't that cute.

355
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,700
Look how far it's come.

356
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,660
Isn't that game old now?

357
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,820
All right.

358
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,580
I need to make little, um, little figures.

359
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:58,900
Like I wonder if my, my little body Coon figures are the right size to stand on it.

360
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:05,380
I have, they're, they're like yay, big, they're like one 12th figures that, um, are used

361
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,140
that I use for art references when I draw.

362
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,060
And I wonder if they would, if not, I could probably make one, but I think it would be,

363
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,860
we talked about that last night with a little mini arcades that I have, cause I have those

364
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,860
other ones.

365
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:24,740
I have the, uh, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles pinball one and the, um, the Galaga, uh, tabletop,

366
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,540
not the tabletop, but the, the table mini arcade.

367
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,540
Yeah.

368
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,540
One of those little one ups.

369
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,540
Yeah.

370
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,500
Now, now you have me knowing I need to go check, check the clearance inventories at

371
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:40,660
places like Ross and, uh, probably if they have it there, then probably home goods, big

372
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:46,900
lots, like all those, like bargain stores were, was at TJ Maxx.

373
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:51,780
And I have looked, I've not seen another, but I swear I will scour.

374
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,860
And if I find them, I'll take you upon appreciate.

375
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,140
Well, well message me first because we need the space for it, but yes.

376
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,140
All right.

377
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,940
Let's put it on the table.

378
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,220
All right.

379
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,720
Let's get into, um, our kickoff topic tonight, something a little different.

380
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,380
So obviously we've been talking a little bit about the holidays.

381
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,380
It's a holiday week.

382
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,540
A lot of people are off work this week.

383
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:16,660
Um, the, the, the, the December 25th Christmas holiday is a big time for, you know, all of

384
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,220
the games that were created throughout the year.

385
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,220
They get released before the holiday.

386
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,620
So, so what I'm saying is that the gaming journalism and gaming media kind of dies down

387
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,400
this week in this time of year, right?

388
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,620
Because there's just not as much going on in the industry while people enjoy time off.

389
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,300
And you know, while most of the big, big titles for the year have been released, things will

390
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:40,540
start to pick up again in mid January, because it's a lot better than it used to be.

391
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:44,460
Um, because now we actually have game releases in January because somewhere along the line,

392
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,660
people figured out, Oh, well, people have those gift cards.

393
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,220
And it's also more the, Oh, we've got to get our games out by the end of the fiscal

394
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,220
year.

395
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,260
Cause that's far more important.

396
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,900
But anyway, this is a slower week.

397
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:02,820
So what ends up happening across gaming media is that we end up with fluff pieces.

398
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,740
What I mean by that is clearly somebody wrote an evergreen type of article or, you know,

399
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,900
somewhat timely for the holidays, they wrote it two weeks ago.

400
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,460
So it could be set to auto publish while they're off for the holidays.

401
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:19,580
Whereas, um, you know, there might not be as much game news and gaming media.

402
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,060
They still need those clicks coming in on the website, right?

403
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,260
They need those ad impressions and all that good stuff, right?

404
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,260
So I thought here we could do something a little new for orange lounge radio.

405
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:31,500
We haven't done this before, but I thought we would travel around the gaming journalism

406
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,420
sites and take a look at some of their fluff pieces and give our own spin on it.

407
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,180
Cause that's what we usually do with the news, right?

408
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,020
Is we kind of give our own spin and talk about it.

409
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:46,060
And we invite you guys in chat as well to, uh, go along with this as well.

410
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:53,300
Um, fifth dream in chat says the best 21 games of 2021 for every console.

411
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,300
Yes.

412
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,300
Much like that.

413
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,140
Except I actually don't have any of those, uh, game of the year type list.

414
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,340
I was going to say topless, but I think there is one actually.

415
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,140
So there's no game of the year type of list yet though.

416
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,140
So let's do it.

417
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:10,240
Let's, let's go around the, um, uh, headlines and, uh, give our takes on some things.

418
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,960
So let's start with this first one.

419
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
Okay.

420
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
This first, oops, not that one.

421
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:20,000
That's a picture of Bobby Black Wolf because I forgot to change the safari grab here.

422
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,440
Let's try that again.

423
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,440
Okay.

424
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,000
The first headline, our first headline was Bobby Black Wolf.

425
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Okay.

426
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,960
So this first headline is from Kotaku and it's called you have died of dysentery, 50

427
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,280
years of traveling the Oregon trail.

428
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,000
And so this article is really just kind of talking about the fact that the Oregon trail,

429
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,920
it is a pretty old game.

430
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,800
Uh, the Oregon trail recently celebrated its 50th birthday.

431
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
And they're actually talking about that.

432
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,680
This is the first franchise to go for half a century.

433
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,920
Uh, originally the Oregon trail was going to be a board game, which I think is kind

434
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,920
of interesting.

435
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,400
I have the card game version.

436
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,520
I don't know about you guys, but like the Oregon trail has had a huge impact on my life,

437
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,880
uh, and my formative years.

438
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,940
What about you guys?

439
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,520
What was the, like, do you remember the Oregon trail?

440
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,880
Was it, was it an impact on you?

441
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,240
I feel like for a lot of people that are around our age, it is because I remember, and I think

442
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,720
I've brought this up on the show before, but I'll repeat myself cause I do that sometimes.

443
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,920
All of us are kind of in that cusp between being a gen X and being a millennial.

444
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,120
I think technically dark soccer and I are gen X.

445
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:35,120
Loki, are you like the first year of millennial or you, are you like the youngest gen X?

446
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,720
I don't know what that means.

447
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,080
I think 81, 80, I think 81 is millennial.

448
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,320
So then we're all gen X, but we do all fall in an interesting sort of what they were calling.

449
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,720
Do you remember Zillennial or XEN?

450
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,800
But another name for this was the Oregon trail generation.

451
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:59,000
And people that said that, I saw that an article, I've ever heard of that.

452
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,120
Go Google it.

453
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,160
It's probably come up in a search or something, but I saw like an article thing.

454
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,440
There was another name for it too, but I forget it because the Oregon trail one jumped

455
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,720
out of my mind.

456
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,080
But I just know the game was huge in my formative years, but what about you guys and your memory

457
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,840
or lack thereof?

458
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,760
I never played Oregon trail as a child.

459
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,760
Really?

460
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,760
Honestly.

461
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,760
Did you ever play it after?

462
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
Yeah.

463
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,760
Okay.

464
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,760
But never as a child.

465
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
Hmm.

466
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,760
Interesting.

467
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
It was always Carmen Sandiego.

468
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,760
Okay.

469
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,760
Okay.

470
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
So there were, okay.

471
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
But there's still something then.

472
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,760
Okay.

473
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Okay.

474
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:40,560
In Alabama, we had a Mac for a hot minute in 1980 something.

475
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:48,800
And then like we had an Apple IIe somewhere in my high school, somewhere.

476
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:55,000
I didn't have regular use with a computer other than having a Coleco Atom where none

477
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,240
of my games worked, mind, because they got erased because Coleco was stupid with how

478
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,920
they built the machine.

479
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,080
You'd get a nice thunderstorm, all of your cassettes were erased, done with that.

480
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:12,240
Mike Defton chat says, I think the Oregon trail is a US only thing probably, but I think

481
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,740
dark soccer is also bringing up that perhaps it's only in the cultures and the parts of

482
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:22,080
America that had computer labs where that was like, but I remember like at my school,

483
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,800
we had a room with like 15 Apple IIe's, but it wasn't like your normal, it was the, you

484
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,600
got to go spend an hour in the computer lab today.

485
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,280
And Mrs. X's class got to go at one o'clock and Mrs. Y's class got to go at two o'clock

486
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,040
and play computer games.

487
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,480
And the Oregon trail was one of the huge ones and everybody wrote anything like that.

488
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,480
Oh, wow.

489
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,480
No, no.

490
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,480
Loki, did you have any memories or it was just me?

491
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,640
No, I had a, we had computer class that we would go to and play the Oregon trail in Carmen

492
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,640
San Diego.

493
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,280
That was pretty much it.

494
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,960
Oh, and I think maybe we also did, what was it, a logo writer.

495
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,280
Oh yeah, logo learning that.

496
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:10,080
Now keep in mind, when the Mac came out, I was 10.

497
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,200
I was already older than you would have been when things like a computer lab in a school

498
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
would have been more commonplace.

499
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,040
I would say still, it's not that far.

500
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,280
And you're in California.

501
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,280
The California thing.

502
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
Yes.

503
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,840
I will say that is probably a big difference there.

504
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,840
Yeah, for sure.

505
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
I never had anything like that.

506
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,800
I only had friends with computers.

507
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
Well.

508
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
Okay.

509
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,040
So the game, the question I also had with this to really kind of ask was what were the

510
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,720
important edutainment games of your formative years, if any.

511
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,480
So dark soccer, you did bring up Carmen San Diego, even if it wasn't in a computer lab

512
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,700
at school, you were playing that at friends' houses.

513
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,040
Was there anything else that you remember?

514
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,760
Like edutainment wise that really resonated with you?

515
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,720
Where in time was my big one?

516
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,080
Where in time was Carmen San Diego?

517
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,240
Because me, I'm a, I'm kind of a history nerd.

518
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,080
But I've always been a bit of a history nerd.

519
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,680
So that was really, really my thing.

520
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,000
The only other stuff that we did, like I played a lot of, I'm going to throw this in there

521
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:14,720
because it kind of was in there, but a lot of crypt equip on the Odyssey 2.

522
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,360
Just all those word scramble ones.

523
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,920
And we would just make them big and crazy to do that.

524
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,760
And I was pretty good at doing the unscrambles like that.

525
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,180
Quiz games were, were a lot of like history quizzes.

526
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,060
I was always really good at those too.

527
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:34,000
Like there were, there were a couple that we had on an Apple 2e that they were pretty

528
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,380
out of date, but you know, trivia is trivia.

529
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,440
Those quiz games were the only games I could get my mom to play with me on Commodore 64

530
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,280
is that, and our favorite was Family Feud.

531
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,560
And I would load it up and she would just tell me the answers to type in because with

532
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,480
my mother, you would think if she touched a keyboard, she'd melt.

533
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,040
She was that computer adverse, but she was like, I'll give you the answers and, you know,

534
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,040
so it would come up.

535
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,640
I'd read, I'd read the question and she'd tell me what the answers she thinks are.

536
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,300
And that's how we played games, but that was, there was a fun way to do it.

537
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,100
So I'll put this way.

538
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,200
My elementary school had a Mac before they had an Apple 2.

539
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Interesting.

540
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,840
Even though it was the newer thing, like when they came out, they got one, one.

541
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,620
Bobby Blackwolf in chat is sharing a similar story saying we would have an Apple 2, one

542
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,080
for the entire grade.

543
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,640
The computer would move to different classrooms in a cart.

544
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,400
Since I had computers at home, I never used the one at school.

545
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,360
I was also a Commodore kid and the Apple 2 just didn't appeal to me.

546
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,560
I was a Commodore kid too, but I loved them all.

547
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:41,840
Like actually when I got to see an Apple 2 or like a TI 99 4a or one of the, I enjoyed

548
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,160
getting to do the stuff I didn't have at home.

549
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,520
So that was always basic for me.

550
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:54,260
Basic programming was kind of where, what my, uh, I guess edutainment was as a kid was

551
00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:04,320
programming the damn balancing ball, you know, or, or you California people are fucking spoiled.

552
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,320
Maybe a little.

553
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,080
Well then Loki, let's talk to another fucking spoiled California person.

554
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,580
What were your edutainment highlights when you were younger?

555
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:17,140
It was just, like I said, the Oregon trail and, uh, Carmen where in the world was Carmen

556
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,140
San Diego.

557
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,660
I think we had, we're in time as well, but I don't remember that too much.

558
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,660
Yeah.

559
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,660
I don't remember where in time as much.

560
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,660
I know it exists.

561
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:29,380
That's all we had in our computer lab, although the last year, like, so it was weird cause

562
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:35,500
I sorta remember this cause the last year I was in grade school or elementary school,

563
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
I should say.

564
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:43,660
We did, they have like a computer in the classroom and I remember it was different than the other

565
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:48,700
ones cause the other computers were kind of like either the monochrome green stuff.

566
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,900
Um, there, I think later on there was some that were more like kind of VGA graphics type

567
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,900
things.

568
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:00,940
But this last one though, it was about how to use a mouse because prior to that we had

569
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,620
never used a mouse before.

570
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,180
That was like a brand new thing.

571
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:08,100
Um, so we had like a game or something, I don't even remember what it was that we learned

572
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,620
how to use the mouse.

573
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:16,340
Probably I remember a big one on the max was, um, was a crystal quest I think was the name

574
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,260
of the game cause they remade it for Xbox arcade in the early days of Xbox.

575
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,260
Okay.

576
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,780
I think it was called crystal quest and you would do, you collect all these little crystals

577
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,540
with the mouse and that's like how you can learn the mouse and then you have to get out

578
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:32,260
the exit and then it would make this, it would make the strangest oddly sexual noise when

579
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,660
you would just get like, like you got all the crystals and then you escape and it goes

580
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:39,780
like when you get out, it's so, yeah, it does.

581
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,340
I don't play the game somebody.

582
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,340
Okay.

583
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,340
Thank you.

584
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,340
Orange right.

585
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,340
Knows what I'm talking about.

586
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,340
Like I'm not like making this up.

587
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:51,940
I'm not like crystal quests is how you learned to do the Mac and you would collect everything

588
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:56,420
and then you get escape the level.

589
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,420
That's funny.

590
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,420
Yeah.

591
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:03,380
I don't play that game at all, but, um, I'm trying to think if we had anything else.

592
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:07,160
It was pretty much that and logo writer, like that was, that was it.

593
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:12,460
Like we, we had a pretty basic computer lab and then after elementary school, actually,

594
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:21,900
we know we did in junior high, we had, um, the first year I did in seventh grade, we

595
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,020
did like they did this program called the exploratory eight or seven or something like

596
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,020
that.

597
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:32,500
And it was basically all the different electives that are available, but you got to do them

598
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,340
for like two to four weeks.

599
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,620
So you'd bounce to every single one.

600
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:44,260
So it was like seven different electives and one of them was computers, but it was just,

601
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,500
it was just computer lab stuff.

602
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:51,580
I think the Elsa did maybe like typing as well, but it was pretty much what they worked

603
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,580
in trail.

604
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,100
I mean, I don't know.

605
00:28:55,180 --> 00:29:00,060
I'll tell you what was, what was funny though, when I was in college now mind, this was me

606
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:04,020
taking a class in 1995, one of my English classes.

607
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:09,220
It was in the computer lab and, um, well, I'll just put it this way.

608
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:17,620
I played a lot of doom in black and white on a black and white Mac, boxy square Mac

609
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,620
classic.

610
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,620
Good times.

611
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:24,460
You know, I will say, I remember like, you know, we're right about that age where the

612
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,860
tech was changing fast because, you know, I, you know, we're talking about these edutainment

613
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,660
games and, you know, elementary school, but kind of like Jamie.

614
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:35,860
Now I start to, I have these memories when I get to about 12 years old, those were the

615
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:40,940
years that we were doing scorched earth in the science lab where he did have, he probably

616
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:46,060
had like seven computers or so in there, but who eats lunch in, you know, the science teacher's

617
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:50,700
classroom, only the most hardcore nerds, but as hardcore nerds, we're look, we're playing

618
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,060
scorched earth.

619
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:56,940
His only rule was do not be looking at anything adult or anything like that.

620
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,940
Do not.

621
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,020
Cause the minute you do that, that's the last time you're going to be in here.

622
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,260
And we were all well behaved nerds.

623
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,100
So we only did the scorched earth thing and the teacher would kind of look over once in

624
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:08,300
a while and go kind of give that interesting look and then go back to grading papers, you

625
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,860
know, just to make sure we weren't looking at porn, you know, that whole type of thing.

626
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,860
I played a lot of kicks.

627
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,860
Oh yeah.

628
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,860
That was a classic.

629
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,860
Yeah.

630
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,860
Yeah.

631
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:23,500
And I had a study study hall for one of my classes.

632
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,420
My senior year of high school, my friend Ashley and I did, and we had it in my favorite teacher's

633
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:33,660
classroom, which she's actually one of the few of my high school teachers I stayed in

634
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:38,820
touch with after graduation until she passed away a few years ago.

635
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,420
She was, she was almost like another mom to me.

636
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,580
That's how I felt at the time.

637
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,160
She really was just an absolute sweetheart.

638
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,840
She and her spouse at the time owned a store, like a hippie store called the Rainbow Connection.

639
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,840
Oh, that's cute.

640
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,840
I like that.

641
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,840
Yeah.

642
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,400
But at any rate, she had an old Apple IIe in the storage closet where we would hang

643
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,920
out in the big storage closet.

644
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:07,160
And I played a lot of kicks, a lot of kicks.

645
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,480
So that is me and school and playing a computer.

646
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,480
All right.

647
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,480
Well, let's go.

648
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,640
This next article I think is a little bit kind of tangential, a little bit to that,

649
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,240
but we're going to travel over to Engadget.

650
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,120
So Engadget on their site has an article called Hitting the Books, Amiga and the Birth of

651
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,280
256 Color Gaming.

652
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:32,640
So I have a feeling this is a little bit probably inspired by that recent announcement of the

653
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,240
Amiga Mini, but I think they actually also get into a book that was written around that

654
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,940
time Creating Qbert and Other Classic Arcade Games.

655
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:45,060
So this is, again, kind of one of those evergreen articles they can put up any time.

656
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:52,060
And they talked about how the Amiga was unprecedented graphics and sound at the time, 4,096 colors,

657
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,960
stereo sound, and all this really cool stuff that was with Amiga.

658
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,100
We never owned an Amiga.

659
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,020
We had a Commodore 64 certainly, but we didn't have an Amiga.

660
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:06,020
And I do remember how the Amiga was one of those ultra realistic things, or at least

661
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,020
at the time.

662
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:13,220
The question I have for chat and for my co-host is, what is an early memory when you remember

663
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:20,100
thinking that computer or console graphics, whatever, were so real and your mind was blown?

664
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,440
Because I think we've all been there over the years is like, oh, graphics are never

665
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,140
going to get better than this.

666
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,420
Graphics can never get better than this.

667
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:30,720
And then yet every console generation, they somehow get better.

668
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,860
But I'm sure as an example, the first time I played Super Mario Brothers 2, I was like,

669
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,860
oh, this is a cartoon.

670
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:40,180
This is like an actual cartoon on TV, but I'm playing it.

671
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:45,820
So what for you guys is a moment when computer or console graphics were so real that your

672
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,820
mind was blown?

673
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,540
Loki, I'll start with you.

674
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:52,820
Oh, gosh, that's a tough one.

675
00:32:52,820 --> 00:33:00,060
The very first time, I would say not necessarily realistic, but Wolfenstein 3D, I remember

676
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:06,140
seeing that at CompUSA being played, and I thought that was really impressive.

677
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:16,960
As far as like super realistic, maybe like Grand Theft Auto 5 or 4, 5 had a ton of detail

678
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,960
in it.

679
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,960
I remember that.

680
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,860
I can't think of any like super detail.

681
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:28,820
I mean, like there's so many games out there, it's just like hard to pick one.

682
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:36,660
But I think the earliest one I was pretty impressed with was probably Wolfenstein 3D

683
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,060
then followed by Quake.

684
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:43,380
I wanted to kind of bold and underline the Wolfenstein 3D part, though, because I know

685
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,900
that game maybe hasn't held up as well over the years, and a lot of people think about

686
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,740
Doom and Quake, kind of like you said.

687
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,860
And certainly, yeah, those games were also hugely important.

688
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:56,720
But like Wolfenstein 3D, obviously that whole 3D part is very important because it was really

689
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,960
the first time I think any of us played like a fully 3D game like that.

690
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,480
Now, granted, people could get technical.

691
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,680
You can go back to like the vector based days and a game like Battlezone or something that

692
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,940
was also 3D.

693
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,280
The concept of 3D gaming was certainly around beforehand, but there was something about

694
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,800
Wolfenstein 3D and the graphics that that brought to the table and everything else that

695
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,800
was just like...

696
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,800
It was Hexen for me.

697
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,800
Very next level.

698
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,800
Of that era.

699
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,680
Well, Hexen was awesome because it was the first time we saw it where it's not a gun,

700
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,680
you know?

701
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,160
Wolfenstein 3D, bang, bang, Quake, bang, you know, all these games were shooty, shooty,

702
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,880
bang, bang, and my favorite phrase, but Hexen kind of put a different twist on it and that

703
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,840
was pretty cool.

704
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,640
So I would actually say Mortal Kombat.

705
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,320
Oh, that's oh, that's a really good answer.

706
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,320
That's a good one.

707
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,320
Yeah.

708
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
Yeah.

709
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,320
Yeah.

710
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,320
What was your what was that like the first time you saw that?

711
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,400
I was like, hey, it's people.

712
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,400
And blood.

713
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,400
This is great.

714
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
Sign me up.

715
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,760
I remember the first time I saw a fatality.

716
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,920
I was like, what?

717
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:07,880
And you know, we still kind of get the talk, even though now by statistics, female oriented

718
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,400
gamers are now have are now the majority of gamers.

719
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,400
Sure.

720
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,660
The the number of identified female gamers has exceeded male gamers.

721
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,520
This is our market.

722
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:25,920
I'm gonna say that now because as when I was that age playing Mortal Kombat and getting

723
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,520
Oh, girls don't play games.

724
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,200
I'm like, fuck you watch me kick your ass.

725
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,360
That started the fuck you let me kick your ass, you know.

726
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,400
And I even remember there's another game that that brought it out for me is this is when

727
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:45,980
I was working at Aladdin's castle in 1995 in Mobile, Alabama.

728
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:50,780
And my boss, it was Namco, it was when Namco had been buying up like a slew of arcades,

729
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,540
they bought Tilt, Aladdin's castle, all of that.

730
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:57,580
And we were sitting there because we got Tekken 3 like a full year before any of the other

731
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:01,580
arcades did, you know, Namco exclusive, that type of thing.

732
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:09,180
And we were I was going on the internet at my at my house with with my lesbian parents

733
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:13,100
and Barbara, rest in peace.

734
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:17,180
And I would look up who the Japanese releases work as they were, you know, after a certain

735
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:22,820
amount of time, they would release a character, we had them in a different order in the US.

736
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:27,340
But Anthony, my boss, and I were just standing there looking at him and he looks over at

737
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:32,820
me as like, you know what these look like what people look like, you know, the previous

738
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:38,220
games like that they were blocky and they were you could see the polygons and this he's

739
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:43,020
like, this is really the first time that I've looked at this and had to take a second glance

740
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,060
and think, Oh, my gosh, this looks real.

741
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,060
Yeah.

742
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,300
I mean, and now look at what we have.

743
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,300
Oh, yeah.

744
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,300
Oh, yeah.

745
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,300
Just after they've gone past that.

746
00:36:51,300 --> 00:37:00,700
But I mean, but at the time, and then the, the the full movement, the the motion capture

747
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,580
was another big thing.

748
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:09,620
And we were just sitting there talking about like, how they did motion capture and how,

749
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:15,940
you know, you could record the movement of a person and incorporate it into a game.

750
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:20,020
YYR in chat is kind of backing up the same choice.

751
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,300
They're saying Virtua Fighter 2 and Daytona USA.

752
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:28,020
I was blown away by Model 2's 3D graphics at 60 frames a second.

753
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:31,580
It looked so real texture mapping was the way of the future.

754
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,580
Yeah.

755
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,940
And I remember those first fighting games were a little bit rough that when they were

756
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:41,660
in 3D, but then like, yeah, as they very quickly evolved into, wow, like very realistic looking

757
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,660
things.

758
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:47,660
Well, and I remember it was, I don't remember how old I was.

759
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,940
I was probably like 13 or 14, but it was my first time going to Las Vegas.

760
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:58,460
And it was when the Luxor had the Sega arcade, it was all Sega owned stuff.

761
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:02,500
And it was, it was, it was a downpour.

762
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,500
We were stuck inside.

763
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,620
It was either the Luxor or the Excalibur because they had the thing that went between

764
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,620
the two.

765
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,620
Yeah.

766
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:16,220
Um, and playing, um, Daytona, um, on like the multi person Daytona set up.

767
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,020
So like eight or 12.

768
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,020
Huh?

769
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,860
Didn't they have like eight or 12 machines linked together?

770
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,860
Yeah.

771
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,860
Yeah.

772
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,340
They were all strung together on like this big platform.

773
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,340
And I'll tell you there's another game.

774
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,900
Were they the ones with the actual like cars?

775
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,900
Yeah.

776
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,420
They're in the little car units.

777
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,420
Yeah.

778
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,420
That'd be awesome.

779
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,860
But I will go out and say there's another game that did that for me, that gave me that

780
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,860
moment.

781
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,860
And that was star blade.

782
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,860
Hmm.

783
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:45,460
And you know, I love star blade, but it had like the immersive cockpit.

784
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:52,620
If you found like the, the, the deluxe ones that would move around space Harrier, if you're

785
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:56,780
in the, and if you have the classic space Harrier or, uh, or afterburner that had the

786
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,180
the move there, I go with my pop filter.

787
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:03,420
Um, if you had the moving cockpits for them, the, the hydraulics and everything, I remember

788
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,660
those at the, what was it?

789
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,660
Starrcade.

790
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:17,060
Um, they had, uh, the, uh, at Scandia, they had one of the, uh, afterburners that moved

791
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,940
around until someone broke it.

792
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,540
Um, I want to get to chat answers cause you guys have some really good stuff in chat,

793
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,980
but since star soccer mentioned the arcade, I had to say, cause I remember my mind was

794
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,220
blown the first time I saw this game and it wasn't very good.

795
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,140
Um, I think it was a Sega thing.

796
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,740
I don't remember, but it was, um, it was the hologram game.

797
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,740
Do you remember that?

798
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:39,140
I think it was time being that it was called, they had it at the mine shop here in sack.

799
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,140
I remember that.

800
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,140
Do you remember?

801
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:44,140
And that the first time I saw that game, my mind was fucking blown.

802
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,020
Like just the hologram gaming.

803
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:51,180
Cause now you actually saw things in that 3d space and it was a really like, it was

804
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:55,940
like dragon's lair, but clunkier, you know, I, I, it did not play well.

805
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,140
It didn't play very well, but it was just, it was definitely a show off-y type of thing.

806
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,900
It was the start of that.

807
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,900
Yeah.

808
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,900
Yeah, for sure.

809
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,580
So anyway, um, getting into some other comments from chats, cause you guys have some great

810
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,580
answers in here.

811
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:11,840
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says another leap was Dreamcast and NFL 2k.

812
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:16,940
It looked like a TV broadcast and sun monkey says, yeah, the sports games always the first

813
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,580
ones to demo the new graphics.

814
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,580
Really good points.

815
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:23,540
You guys, um, fifth dream says dragon's lair, but it really was a cartoon.

816
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,940
Well it's, but still it was using that technology of a laser disc.

817
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,940
Yeah.

818
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,740
Like, you know, that, that was an impressive tech in the eighties.

819
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:35,380
In and of itself, dragon's lair and those, those games like that.

820
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,700
Um, like even going into cliff jumper, which was based off of a loop in the third castle

821
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:48,100
of Cagliostro and what was the racing one, uh, cliff, no, it was, I'll remember the name

822
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:53,860
of it because it always makes me think of, uh, of, uh, being bandit from whatever that

823
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,860
anime that I never remember.

824
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,540
The name is writing bean.

825
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:05,180
Um, but, uh, it's really also just very simple programming, you know, it's if this, then

826
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:08,900
this, if this, then not this, you know, yeah.

827
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:13,140
And it's really just playing on a path and you can memorize how to do it.

828
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:18,080
I mean, despite the cues that come up, but the thing that was great about that is because

829
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,240
they were starting to realize that people would spectate, like lean over people's shoulder

830
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,280
and watch the games.

831
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,860
And it was one of the first ones that they thought to put into their monitor on top of

832
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,820
the machine so that people could watch it being played.

833
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,220
And now they do that with some fighting games, uh, especially for like those, you know, heavy

834
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,400
tournament things, especially when new ones come out.

835
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,880
Um, Mike Deft is saying the game was called time traveler that I was trying to think.

836
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,880
I knew it was time something.

837
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,880
Yeah.

838
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,880
I remember a lot of folks in chat.

839
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,880
Remember it.

840
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,880
Yeah.

841
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,880
Um, I want to get to a couple other answers.

842
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,880
That was another one.

843
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,200
Um, I want to get to this answer from your muse, because I think this is, this is a great

844
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,200
answer for mere muse.

845
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,060
Well, they're all good, but this one in particular, uh, says, I remember being blown away by Ninja

846
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,220
Gaiden because of the cut scenes.

847
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,600
It was like a movie.

848
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,060
Hell yes.

849
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,680
That was groundbreaking for the NES.

850
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,680
You're right.

851
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,680
I was like a movie.

852
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,240
Okay.

853
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:14,620
How many of y'all were guilty of doing the voices since there was no voices?

854
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:17,340
How many of y'all were guilty playing the game with your friend and doing the voices

855
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,340
and the cut scenes?

856
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,340
Okay.

857
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,340
Just me.

858
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,340
That's fine.

859
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,340
Yeah.

860
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,340
People.

861
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,340
Yeah.

862
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,340
Go to different Twitch channels.

863
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,340
People still do that.

864
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,380
Have you been watching any of my play through of hot to full boyfriend?

865
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,380
Yes I have.

866
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,380
I've been lurking.

867
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,380
I've been voice acting everything.

868
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,380
Yes.

869
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,380
Yes.

870
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:37,940
Um, and uh, Bobby Black Wolf with kind of a winky face answer, honestly with the matrix

871
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,820
awakens tech demo.

872
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:43,060
So I mean, I know that's a little bit tongue in cheek, but at the same time it just goes

873
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,340
to show the boundaries are still being broken.

874
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,340
Right.

875
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,420
So, you know, and that's a very recent release.

876
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,420
All right.

877
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,580
Um, we still have, I still have like four more of these, so this is a good, this is

878
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,700
a good time filler tonight.

879
00:42:54,700 --> 00:43:00,420
Uh, but this is our next one here from IGN, our next topic, and they are running with

880
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:05,340
the headline called why 2021 was the year of the multiverse.

881
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:10,940
And by the way, why does IGN need these gigantic fucking ads on their site, especially the

882
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:14,360
ones that autoplay, ah, so annoying.

883
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,700
And of course, you know, their purpose is to make money.

884
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:20,100
You know, if I turn this off, it's just going to go right back on because it never remembers

885
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,420
your saves there anyway.

886
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,480
So here's the thing.

887
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,620
This article is talking about the multiverse.

888
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:28,620
So, you know, IGN kind of talks a bit about more than just gaming.

889
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:32,540
They talk about MCU, but then they talk about, you know, Star Trek.

890
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:37,500
They talk about the Nickelodeon stuff with the Ophineas and Ferb and that whole stuff.

891
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,740
They get into all this stuff and the different multiverses here.

892
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:47,500
So I thought a fun little follow up question to IGN's ad filled article here, uh, would

893
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:53,700
be what multiverse or crossover games since multiverse might be a little difficult, but

894
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:58,180
what multiverse or crossover games do you want to see?

895
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:04,260
So already playing one, dark soccer, you're playing the, the, the fantasy crossover game

896
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,700
you've always wanted to see.

897
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:06,700
I'm playing dead by daylight.

898
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:13,580
How fucking cool is that, that I can play like famous, you know, horror movie killers.

899
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,380
I'm getting Sadako.

900
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,960
That makes me so fucking happy.

901
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:23,580
If we got, you know, uh, Kayako and Toshio next from Zhiyun, I would be even, even happier.

902
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:30,700
Although I would love to have an X-Men game done like Guardians of the Galaxy.

903
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:37,380
I would be over the moon, but that would make me super happy.

904
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,460
I miss having a really good X-Men game to play.

905
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:46,300
The last one I think I played that wasn't a fighting game was the Sega Genesis one,

906
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,300
maybe.

907
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,860
Um, Loki, what about you?

908
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:53,100
Can you think of a multiverse and crossover game you really want to answer pod culture

909
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,100
real quick?

910
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,100
Yeah.

911
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:59,340
Which team it would be a make your own.

912
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,500
All right, Loki.

913
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:07,540
I mean, I guess Ready Player One would be pretty good.

914
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:11,020
I mean, that was just kind of a crossover of all sorts of things.

915
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,260
Um, but that'd be pretty cool.

916
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:17,620
I guess they never did do like a, uh, uh, actual game tying.

917
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:20,660
I mean, I know they did the little Olympics online.

918
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:26,500
They did like a, um, kind of like a, you know, I don't think it's official, but they did

919
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:33,140
like a Ready Player One VR game that had like some different games within it, but it's not

920
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:38,260
really like the actual game or movie or book or whatever.

921
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,780
Um, I just think that'd be pretty cool.

922
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:50,020
Uh, otherwise, you know, something that I'd like to see, I don't know, maybe a Mario Kart

923
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:53,500
game with like characters from other games in it.

924
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,540
Definitely not just Mario Kart, Nintendo Kart.

925
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,540
Yeah.

926
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:01,300
You know, and in chat E3VL has responded to the question saying, you know, basically that

927
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,540
the best crossover game is smash ultimate.

928
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,740
Like, you know, the best crossover game already exists.

929
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:10,100
And I think my answer to this question kind of lies in there too, is that Nintendo has

930
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:14,580
kind of shown that they're willing to bleed their franchises over to make an incredible

931
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,220
game like that.

932
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,260
Let's see that in other genres as well.

933
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:23,540
Um, and I would, I would love to see, because I think everybody remembers the greatness

934
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:25,980
that was Super Mario RPG.

935
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:31,160
And a very easy answer to this would be, we want to see a fucking Super Mario RPG too.

936
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,020
But I think the easy, easy answer, and here's where I'm going to go with this, is we want

937
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:39,940
a, I want a Nintendo Kingdom Hearts type of thing.

938
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:40,940
That's what I want.

939
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:41,940
That would be amazing.

940
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:47,060
And honestly, like, you know, the, the Super Mario RPG, I would love to have a Super Mario

941
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:52,220
RPG, but the Paper Mario games have actually been pretty good in, in kind of, you know,

942
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,220
that realm.

943
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,220
Filling that void.

944
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,220
Yeah.

945
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,220
It's sort of, I mean, it's different.

946
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:00,540
The combat's different in each game and stuff, but like, it's pretty cool.

947
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:05,100
I mean, it's pretty close to that kind of feel of an RPG game, but yeah, I would like

948
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,740
an actual RPG game.

949
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,740
It would be pretty awesome.

950
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:11,300
Uh, DJ Rama S in chat says, fuck yes, Mushroom Kingdom Hearts.

951
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:15,260
Um, Tiger Claw with a couple of comments here saying there was that Super Mario crossover

952
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,700
fan game that lets you play other characters from the NES.

953
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,700
Oh yeah.

954
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:23,700
There was, I think the devs were in Sacramento actually, because I remember there was a kickstart.

955
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:28,060
They tried to kickstart the game with like, they had to change the characters names and

956
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:32,620
make them look slightly different, but they basically still have the same thing.

957
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:37,060
And um, yeah, I don't know what ever happened that it just kind of dropped off the face

958
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,060
of the earth.

959
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:42,060
Um, Tiger Claw in chat says crossover games are kind of all the thing right now, Smash

960
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:45,300
Brothers, Nick All Star Brawl, and now Multiverse.

961
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,080
And then also says there's Fortnite.

962
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,820
They do a lot of crossovers.

963
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:52,620
Well, and that's kind of, I think where IGN was going with the article, you know, even

964
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,900
though yes, it's a fluff piece, I think it is a, you know, an accurate observation is

965
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:01,660
that it's kind of a trend we're seeing when I, I'm going to be honest, when I first opened

966
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,380
it up, I thought I was going to be reading something about the metaverse cause I read

967
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,380
too fast.

968
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:08,780
But then when I was reading what was in front of me, I was kind of, okay, you know, yeah,

969
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:13,180
this does seem to be a trend in gaming is, you know, the WB's got something coming with

970
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,180
all their stuff.

971
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,740
Nickelodeon has their thing.

972
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:19,260
We know the Avengers was a big game reason and so on and so on.

973
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,380
You know, these, these huge crossover games are kind of a big thing right now.

974
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:26,060
Uh, Jordan Ramsey versus Cookie Mama.

975
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,140
I love it.

976
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:29,060
And Gordon Ramsey just mines Bitcoin.

977
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:35,500
Uh, Dark Tetsuya says, I want a new NES remix, but with other third party games, something

978
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,980
like that would be awesome.

979
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:37,980
Hell yes.

980
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,940
I would love, Nintendo needs to revisit that NES remix concept.

981
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:42,940
I think there was a good shit there.

982
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,780
What if Konami brought back Konami YY World?

983
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:50,940
That might be a little obscure for people, but hey, Konami's got the Bomberman thing

984
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:53,580
and they're bringing like, you know what, you want to talk about multiverse?

985
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:54,580
Like what?

986
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,980
Like Pyramid Head is in Bomberman and like now they got Suikoden characters in there.

987
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:03,180
Like Konami's, they, any IP they own, they've put in Bomberman somehow.

988
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,180
That's for sure.

989
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:09,220
So, uh, Sia Tabiri says, I would love to see more of a crime focused Pokemon game like

990
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:13,020
Phoenix Wright cross Pokemon, uh, E3VL points out Detective Pikachu.

991
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:16,380
Yeah, kind of, kind of a little bit, maybe a different tone.

992
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,980
That might be a different tone though.

993
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:18,980
So anyway.

994
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:19,980
All right.

995
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,900
Uh, good answers on that.

996
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,380
Let's go to another headline here.

997
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:31,860
The next headline we have is from, what is this site, GameSpot, uh, who had ran an article.

998
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:36,260
This is really, and look at this again, another gigantic fucking autoplay ad at the top of

999
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:37,260
the page.

1000
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:43,500
Finally, you scroll down and here's the headline, free game roundup, happy holidays.

1001
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,900
And I, they talk about games that are free right now, but then they get into stuff that's

1002
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:52,740
like Xbox games with gold and those aren't exactly free, but whatever.

1003
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,580
It had me thinking about free games.

1004
00:49:54,580 --> 00:50:00,720
By the way, here's a PSA for those listening live on Sunday night, uh, the Epic Game Store

1005
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,680
today is giving away control and I realize people have their opinions on the Epic Game

1006
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,680
Store.

1007
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,680
Some people refuse to touch it.

1008
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,800
I respect that.

1009
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,800
That's fine.

1010
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,780
However, if you are one of the type that's just willing to use it to leech all of the

1011
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:20,600
free stuff on Epic's dime, uh, go, which I am to go for it and pick up control because

1012
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,500
that is the free game, but it's only unfortunately podcast folks probably going to be gone by

1013
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,160
the time the podcast comes around.

1014
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,560
Um, but you know, they've been given away free stuff every day.

1015
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:32,520
I just think the big ones are usually like the first game, maybe the last game.

1016
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:36,560
Uh, and then like, you know, Christmas day and I guess today cause they gave away prey

1017
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,560
yesterday.

1018
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,560
That was a pretty big deal.

1019
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,920
Oh, apparently I have the game already, given it out already.

1020
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,800
I think they did give it out at once.

1021
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,880
Uh, I think I've had it too, but I have it on Stadia.

1022
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:52,240
Um, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says my favorite part of the segment is Rob pointing out the

1023
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,400
actual reason they're releasing these articles by complaining about it.

1024
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,400
Oh, the ads.

1025
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,400
Of course.

1026
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,400
Of course.

1027
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,440
It's on the internet.

1028
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,440
I'm going to complain about things.

1029
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,440
That's what we do here.

1030
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,440
Anyway.

1031
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,920
Um, so of course it was, yeah, dark to see it says Shenmue three was free a week ago

1032
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,440
and like only for a day.

1033
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,440
Yes.

1034
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,000
So what a question do I have about free games?

1035
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,120
It's this.

1036
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,480
Have you ever, this is very much is, is rageinator still out there?

1037
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,000
Cause I think this is very much a rageinator inspired question.

1038
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,920
So wherever you are, shout out buddy.

1039
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:28,480
Have you ever gotten a game on sale or super cheap that ended up being a hugely pleasant

1040
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,760
surprise and by super cheap, that can include free I'll go first because my answer to this

1041
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:38,120
quite honestly would be the classic game that dark soccer picked last week.

1042
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:43,840
VVVVV is absolutely my answer to this because it came in one of those humble bundles and

1043
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:47,760
it wasn't something I was necessarily seeking out, but when I bought the humble bundle,

1044
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,880
I noticed like, Oh, this is kind of like Commodore 64 inspire.

1045
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,720
This looks like it might be fun, obsessed.com with that game obsessed.

1046
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,800
In fact, I kind of want to play it again.

1047
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,920
Maybe that'll be a stream in the near future, but like that was a game where I was not expecting

1048
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,080
that to be as good as it was.

1049
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:08,600
And I got it for very, very, very cheap, maybe not free, but very cheap, like where I felt

1050
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,920
like I stole it.

1051
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:17,440
Um, Loki, anything for you in the, I discovered an amazing game for free or cheap for free

1052
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,440
or cheap?

1053
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:25,120
Um, well, I mean, it was, it's technically it wasn't cheap.

1054
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:32,440
I think it was this, I can't remember if it was 40 or 20, maybe 40, but earth defense

1055
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,560
force 2017.

1056
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:40,120
I think that was, it was pretty cheap and that was just endless amounts of fun.

1057
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:43,640
There was another one I was trying to think of like, but I'm looking through my steam

1058
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:50,440
library and I can't find it because I have too many games in here, but there was another

1059
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,880
one through humble bundle as well.

1060
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:56,080
That was really good, but I can't think of the name of it right now.

1061
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:01,120
Um, well, if you think of it, we'll come back to, um, you know, before I kick it over to

1062
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:05,400
dark soccer with this question, um, actually thinking of the types of games, dark soccer

1063
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,680
enjoys actually brings another very relevant answer to mind.

1064
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:13,440
Dead by daylight was something I got to play because of Xbox game pass.

1065
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,440
And I knew that Alan played the game and really enjoyed it.

1066
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,800
Um, and I'd watched stream.

1067
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,520
He got me into some of this cause he would watch these streamers in bed and I'd just

1068
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,520
be like, what are you watching?

1069
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,520
What are you watching?

1070
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,400
And then, you know, then I, I think they were very funny and, you know, started to get into

1071
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,760
watching the streams as well.

1072
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,920
And then I was like, I don't know if I could play this game cause I'm not big on horror.

1073
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:33,560
And then of course, you know, I was like, oh, it's actually not that gory at the end

1074
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,560
of the day.

1075
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:38,120
Like it's, uh, you know, it's not, you know, actually graphically, it's really not that

1076
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,520
intense of a game.

1077
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,960
It's really just about, you know, the, um, the different mechanics and that whole thing.

1078
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:49,920
Um, so, but it was because the game was on Xbox game pass that I was like, all right,

1079
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,620
I'll download it and check it out.

1080
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:53,120
If I don't know, hold on.

1081
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,240
If I don't like it, no harm, no foul.

1082
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:58,080
I didn't actually spend money on it cause I'm just paying for game pass.

1083
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,480
So that would actually be my other answer.

1084
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,480
Okay.

1085
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,480
Loki quickly years.

1086
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,520
And then we'll go back to dark Sakura until dawn rush of blood.

1087
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:07,400
It was 20 bucks and that was excellent.

1088
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:13,360
It is easily a $60 game easily, but, but yeah, that would be my pick.

1089
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,360
Good answer.

1090
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:19,640
Um, in the chat room, uh, tiger class says VVV is one of those games that speed run.

1091
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,040
Bobby Blackwell points out every game is speed run.

1092
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:26,440
Uh, E3VL says live service online multiplayer games aren't speed run though.

1093
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:30,880
Actually, I hate to well actually you, but I'm going to well actually you, those are

1094
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:31,880
speed run as well.

1095
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:36,320
In fact, cause Shane was telling me about one that he was watching this weekend where

1096
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:42,760
somebody was speed running the entire main story in final fantasy 14 over like 72 hours

1097
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,000
or something like that.

1098
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,640
And it was just getting through the thing as fast as possible without like you could

1099
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,160
not chain run dungeons.

1100
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,880
You actually had to go through the main scenario and do it that way.

1101
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:58,240
So people come up with their own wild rules that in turn become a speed run.

1102
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,240
It's just, you have a lot more options with an MMO.

1103
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,840
Anyway, I'm sorry, dark soccer.

1104
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,080
What about you and cheap or a free discoveries?

1105
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,400
Um, I just got Piconiku, which I've been wanting to play.

1106
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:18,600
Um, I I've got a bunch of games that have just come out, you know, free one way or another.

1107
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:24,760
Like when I started, wow, I think I had like a free thing for it and I played like after

1108
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:29,840
cataclysm for a while, um, dead by daylight.

1109
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:33,680
I don't even remember ever having bought it the first time.

1110
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,400
It might've been a stadia giveaway game at some point for all I know.

1111
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:42,760
Yeah, I think it was cause at the time I, I got all my DLC, like really dirt cheap.

1112
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:46,840
And I have a bunch of great games that I've gotten on stadia for quote free.

1113
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:51,640
I have the pro membership, so there's a lot of really great games that I've picked up

1114
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,640
that way.

1115
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:59,200
Um, I have, I have, uh, I've been wanting to play control and I just got control, um,

1116
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,760
I mean, but I already had it on stadia.

1117
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:07,240
Um, there's always, you know, a lot of the, the ones that pop up on steam for, for dirt

1118
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,240
cheap as well.

1119
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,600
And then people have, have bought me games.

1120
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:16,080
Um, so I really have a hard time naming one versus the other.

1121
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,920
Cause typically it'll take like, I'll pick up a game and I'll be like, okay, this is

1122
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,920
fun.

1123
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,600
And then I'll lose interest cause that's just the way my brain works.

1124
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:28,120
I'll, I'll, you know, I won't stick with it and then I'll find the one and I will stick

1125
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,120
with it.

1126
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:34,480
And that's kind of what dead by daylight is for me right now.

1127
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,840
Um, Detroit actually, uh, I got Detroit pretty cheap.

1128
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:43,320
You know, you brought up world of Warcraft and it did, and you know, between that and

1129
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:47,440
the comment about MMO speed runs in chat kind of made me think that like, usually, you know,

1130
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,960
a lot of those games like, wow, you know, final fantasy 14 does the point, does this

1131
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:57,160
to the point that it's a meme, um, has the free trials to kind of get you hooked and

1132
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,960
it's like play until level, whatever, whatever.

1133
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,440
And then, you know, pay a monthly fee after that.

1134
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,440
And you know, wow.

1135
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,440
Has one.

1136
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,440
Long as he 14 has one.

1137
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,440
It's suspended right now.

1138
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,440
They have one.

1139
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,440
What's that?

1140
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,440
Ragnarok online.

1141
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,440
Oh, or just straight up.

1142
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,320
That was the one I played for free for a long time.

1143
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:16,920
Can Pokemon go ingress saw the cell phone game?

1144
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:17,920
No, no, no.

1145
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,920
Ragnarok online.

1146
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,520
I played in the, in the Japanese beta.

1147
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,520
Yeah.

1148
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,520
Yeah.

1149
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:28,320
The US beta came out and I played in the US beta and then they were going to make us start

1150
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,320
fucking paying for it.

1151
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:36,080
And I paid for it, but, and then they were like, oh, well, your beta characters are coming

1152
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,080
over.

1153
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,440
Then a lot of us jumped ship and then free servers happened and all of that.

1154
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:47,760
But Ragnarok online, I played that for a good 10 years consistently.

1155
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,320
I'm sure as you recall, I have still a picture of our characters sitting in pronterra field

1156
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:55,360
with your, your little major wearing a bow, which I had, then you had a mask or I had

1157
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,360
a mask.

1158
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,200
We were very ahead of our time in that regard.

1159
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,200
Yeah.

1160
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:04,880
I was, I would always, uh, play the assassin and you had a cute little mage.

1161
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,880
Yep.

1162
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:06,880
All right.

1163
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,880
Adorable.

1164
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,280
Uh, just a couple more of these, but I think, I don't know about you guys.

1165
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,280
I'm having fun.

1166
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,120
So let's look at a couple more of these.

1167
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:17,040
Uh, so let's go now over to games, radar.com.

1168
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:22,300
Who's running an article, uh, that says the play team debates, which kids book they would

1169
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,000
turn into a game.

1170
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,040
Um, I don't know who the play team is.

1171
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,760
I'm assuming that's just some thing in house.

1172
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,000
Maybe they have a podcast.

1173
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,420
I don't know, but they're talking about being traumatized by fairy tale and they've got

1174
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:34,420
a mag.

1175
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,420
Oh, it's a magazine.

1176
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:36,420
I see.

1177
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,420
Uh, and so on.

1178
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:39,840
So, uh, of course this lends itself to the quest and there really isn't much of an article

1179
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,840
here is there?

1180
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:41,920
Oh no, I guess it does.

1181
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,760
You just can't tell cause of all the ads.

1182
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:49,440
So they go around and somebody says, Grimm's fairy tale, uh, somebody talks about the far

1183
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,040
away tree, um, and so on and so on.

1184
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:58,440
So of course, I'm going to ask you guys, what book do you want to see made into a video

1185
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,440
game?

1186
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,440
This might be a hard question.

1187
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:04,080
Um, Darcy, I'll start with you.

1188
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:10,260
One of my favorite book series would be the Harold de Valdemar series by Mercedes Lackey.

1189
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:14,420
And I would love that to be made into an RPG where you can play one of the heralds

1190
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:20,060
in, in the, the main kingdom and have all of their interesting little powers and you

1191
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:26,900
go around and rescue people and save and, you know, settle disputes and do all the stuff

1192
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:32,180
that they do in the books and go to the different kingdoms and diplomatic missions and all kinds

1193
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,180
of fun stuff like that.

1194
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,060
I would be totally down for that.

1195
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:36,060
Loki.

1196
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:37,060
How about you?

1197
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:39,780
Um, children's book.

1198
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:43,780
I would say it doesn't have to be Jones, but this is no children's series.

1199
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:49,580
They're going to be ready player one, or it's going to be, uh, you know, uh, Charlie and

1200
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:53,020
chocolate factory, I guess that, Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1201
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,940
Uh, the wizard of Oz would be awesome.

1202
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:59,340
Oh, or like the, the greater Oz store.

1203
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:02,500
There's so many stories in those books that have not been realized.

1204
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,500
Yeah.

1205
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,940
That's a really good answer.

1206
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:08,540
I'm surprised they haven't tried to like MMO that universe.

1207
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:09,860
Maybe that'd be really hard though.

1208
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:15,020
Um, I think they might've, if I recall, I think they approached bounds of state about

1209
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:17,660
it and there was a big rejection.

1210
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:21,620
I have to go back and find that I remembered reading something, but yet they made that

1211
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:23,460
movie with Lea Michelle, whatever.

1212
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:24,460
All right.

1213
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:27,860
Uh, and like James Franco, there's some Oz movie they did a few years ago.

1214
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:30,980
Oh, the great and powerful, the great and powerful.

1215
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:35,500
I kind of wanted to see that, but I always, my favorite that was returned to Oz because

1216
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:38,460
it was like right based off of like three of the books.

1217
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:40,540
That movie fucked us all up as children.

1218
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:46,180
Like again, that speaks, you know, it's funny cause they say we're the Oregon trail generation.

1219
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:47,540
We should be the, what was her name?

1220
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,540
Princess Nambi.

1221
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:50,540
What was her name?

1222
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,540
Nambi.

1223
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:52,540
Yeah.

1224
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:53,540
That should be our job.

1225
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:56,540
We're the, we're the princess Nambi generation because that bitch scarred us all with her

1226
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:58,140
heads in the jars and all that.

1227
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:59,140
I'm sorry.

1228
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:03,620
Or when they start, when they start screaming, Oh yeah.

1229
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,660
Oh, that was great.

1230
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:06,660
Not Lea Michelle.

1231
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:07,660
I thought it was Lea Michelle in that.

1232
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:08,660
All right.

1233
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:09,660
Whatever.

1234
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:10,660
All right.

1235
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,660
But you know who else that was in return to Oz?

1236
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,660
Uh, Farisah Balk.

1237
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:14,660
Yep.

1238
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:15,660
Yeah.

1239
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:16,660
She was Dorothy.

1240
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,660
That was such a good movie.

1241
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:18,940
That was a great movie.

1242
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:25,180
Uh, my book series, I was going to say RL Stein's Goosebumps.

1243
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:26,180
Didn't they do games?

1244
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:27,180
I thought they did some games.

1245
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:31,780
They've done, I think they did, um, movies, uh, but I don't think they've done games or

1246
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:32,780
if they've done games.

1247
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:36,220
There was, there might've been point and click adventure games.

1248
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:40,780
Cause I was going to say the babysitters club, but I'm pretty sure those have been games.

1249
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,180
There's like some point and click.

1250
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:43,180
Okay.

1251
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:44,580
Oh, fifth dream says they've done games.

1252
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:45,580
All right.

1253
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:46,580
Fair enough.

1254
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:47,580
All right.

1255
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:48,580
I tried.

1256
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,580
All right.

1257
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:50,580
Uh, one more article.

1258
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:51,580
All right.

1259
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:52,580
One more.

1260
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:53,580
This has been a long save of this is good.

1261
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:54,580
You guys enjoy this as a time filler.

1262
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:55,580
All right.

1263
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:56,580
Press one in the chat.

1264
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:58,580
If you enjoy, uh, us filling time with this segment.

1265
01:01:58,580 --> 01:01:59,580
All right.

1266
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:04,580
Last story here is from, what website is this?

1267
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:05,580
Even this thing.

1268
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:06,580
Oh, Game Informer.

1269
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:07,580
Okay.

1270
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:08,580
So we're going to visit Game Informer.

1271
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:12,940
And, uh, I thought this was an appropriate one for Orange Launch Radio as we head into

1272
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:17,380
our 20th year of broadcasting next year.

1273
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,500
And remember how it all started?

1274
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:24,220
Cause Dark Soccer, Loki and I all met playing Dance Dance Revolution at the local arcade.

1275
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:31,180
So of course this piece on Game Informer about the top 10 music games caught my eye

1276
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:35,420
or should I say top 10 music games to play right now?

1277
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:36,420
Play them right now.

1278
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:40,900
Well, folks, I thought, I thought, well, it's 10 Loki.

1279
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:46,780
Uh, I thought, I thought we could review the list together, uh, and give our expert opinion

1280
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:48,700
on how well done this list is.

1281
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:49,700
So you guys ready?

1282
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:50,700
Here we go.

1283
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:56,380
So according to Game Informer, and this is in no particular order, uh, Fuser is the first

1284
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:57,740
game that they mentioned.

1285
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:04,580
I did like Fuser, but I liked Fuser as a concept more than a game personally, but I, I, I look

1286
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,140
at it more as like a canvas.

1287
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:08,380
It's like an interactive type of thing.

1288
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:13,280
So, um, it's YYR says, I bet DDR isn't on there.

1289
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,280
We shall see.

1290
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,280
We shall see.

1291
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,680
Uh, Fuser is the first one.

1292
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,340
Rock Band 4.

1293
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:20,860
I think that's a pretty solid pick.

1294
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:25,900
I think a lot of us are nostalgic for the Rock Band Guitar Hero era right now, which

1295
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:31,180
is funny because it's very hard to get those controllers and that sort of stuff.

1296
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:35,620
Like, you know, just when all the plastic shit was filling up our house, now we can't

1297
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:36,820
find it anywhere.

1298
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:37,820
It's just very interesting.

1299
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:38,820
I have them all in my garage.

1300
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:39,820
Good.

1301
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:40,820
Good for you hanging on to them.

1302
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:41,820
Just closet.

1303
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:42,820
Good for you inside my room.

1304
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:43,820
Liking dust.

1305
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,820
All right.

1306
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:47,060
So Rock Band 4 is on their list, so that's two.

1307
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:48,420
Let's see what else is on the list.

1308
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:52,620
So we then have Cadence of Hyrule that Sia Tabiri said in chat.

1309
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:58,860
So, um, this of course is based on, um, Crypt of the Necrodancer, but they did it with Zelda.

1310
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:01,340
So, um, this is cute.

1311
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:08,420
I like that Nintendo lent a very valuable, like they believed in this enough to lend

1312
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:13,240
such a big property to the developers like indie developers.

1313
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:17,580
And I was almost more excited about that than just the fact that it's a solid music game

1314
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:18,620
to be honest.

1315
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:19,620
So.

1316
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:20,620
Hmm.

1317
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:21,620
All right.

1318
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:24,060
Moving on the list, Beat Saber.

1319
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,860
I mean, I think this is a given.

1320
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:32,100
Like it's, it's the, it's, it's like the VR app basically, um, is, is Beat Saber.

1321
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:35,260
And now it has Lady Gaga, which just elevates it that much more.

1322
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:41,620
So I'm on board with the, uh, Beat Saber, uh, the next one on the list, Rez Infinite,

1323
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:44,580
to which I give a giant fuck yes.

1324
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:48,160
This is one of the best music games that will ever be made.

1325
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,980
And in fact, I'm still kind of salty.

1326
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:56,620
The Area X, which was very clearly a prototype for a new Rez game was not fully realized.

1327
01:04:56,620 --> 01:05:01,460
So just, especially now with the graphics that, you know, they're pushing on these consoles.

1328
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:03,100
Oh, right.

1329
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,460
So yeah, I would absolutely agree with Rez Infinite.

1330
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:09,820
Um, the next pick on the list is Tetris Effect.

1331
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:14,500
So not usually something I think of with music game, but at the same time, yes.

1332
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:19,420
Uh, it absolutely does qualify and it is absolutely the best version of Tetris on top

1333
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:20,420
of that.

1334
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:21,420
Um, for sure.

1335
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:27,820
So I, I definitely, uh, you know, uh, Mizuguchi is huge on the music, uh, stuff, obviously,

1336
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:30,980
as we see with Rez Tetris Effect is right up there.

1337
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:31,980
Funny.

1338
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:34,960
And again, I pointed this out on the show before, but I'll say it again.

1339
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:39,980
If you actually look at the credits for Rez Area X, it talks about how it's run on the

1340
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:43,860
Synesthesia engine, which is the exact same engine that runs Tetris Effect.

1341
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:45,100
If you look in the credits.

1342
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:48,340
So those games are connected.

1343
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,340
Yours forever.

1344
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:50,340
All right.

1345
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:52,620
Uh, moving on.

1346
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:56,020
The next game on their list, Thumper.

1347
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:58,080
This is an interesting choice.

1348
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,140
I get it.

1349
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:04,980
I'm not sure it's one of my top 10 favorites of all time, but I do feel like it did bring

1350
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:11,220
something very different to the table, um, with the whole music horror, but they kind

1351
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:13,000
of, they do it in a neat way.

1352
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,480
Like it's not just like, Oh, symbol hovers over thing, press button.

1353
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,880
Like this is a very different way to approach that.

1354
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:22,560
And I can applaud it for that.

1355
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:26,480
So there is that, um, moving on.

1356
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:31,600
And Bobby says, uh, this isn't top 10 of all time, but top 10 to play now, which means

1357
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,600
it's available for modern consoles.

1358
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,800
Well, you know what?

1359
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:41,480
I also, why, why did you all just throw your retro consoles in the dumpster?

1360
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:42,480
Do you all not have phones?

1361
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:49,080
All right, the next item on the list, I'm going to just, so here's one that I'm going

1362
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:51,400
to say, no, this is wrong.

1363
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,200
BPM bullets per minute.

1364
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,600
Um, uh, Alan got this one.

1365
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,440
We're checking it out a little bit.

1366
01:06:58,440 --> 01:06:59,700
I think it wears out.

1367
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:00,700
It's welcome pretty quick.

1368
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,200
I don't think this is that good of a game.

1369
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,200
Uh, sorry.

1370
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:06,460
I know that's kind of mean cause I know it's more of an indie game this month in my humble

1371
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:07,460
bundle thing.

1372
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:08,460
Well, that's good.

1373
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:09,460
It was free.

1374
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:10,460
Uh, I just, I wasn't free.

1375
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:12,900
I had to pay for it, but you know, I just free enough.

1376
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:16,940
I think it's one of those things that sounds cooler than it actually is.

1377
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:18,460
So I don't know.

1378
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:19,460
So there's that.

1379
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:22,380
Uh, let's see the next item on the list.

1380
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:24,140
Audica, uh, is on the list.

1381
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:27,740
This was harmonics is kind of answer to the VR music game space.

1382
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:32,140
I think this game is better than people's memories.

1383
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:36,980
Give it credit for because the conversation is always Beat Saber, Beat Saber, Beat Saber.

1384
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:41,140
And yes, Beat Saber is a good game, but that doesn't mean other VR games that are music

1385
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,180
based can't exist.

1386
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:43,940
And I think Audica is pretty decent.

1387
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:48,180
Um, I've, and I enjoyed, they have a lot of good licensed music in it and so forth.

1388
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:52,140
So, um, I think, I think Audica is worthy of the list, especially if you are looking

1389
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:58,020
at a modern stuff that you can get right now type of list.

1390
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:00,980
Um, yeah.

1391
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:02,860
And then was that it or is there one more?

1392
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:04,140
Oh, there's one more on the list.

1393
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:07,980
And again, I think this is a lazy pick.

1394
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:11,220
Just Dance 2022 is the last one they have on their list.

1395
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:15,620
Um, I, maybe this is just my opinion.

1396
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:21,300
Just Dance 2022, again, this list coming from Game Informer, I think that list is, or that

1397
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:25,300
particular entry, I think Just Dance is more of an exercise title than it is a music game

1398
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:26,300
title.

1399
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:31,360
Um, because yes, it involves music and hypothetically, you're supposed to be doing things in time

1400
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:34,800
to the music, but, um, it doesn't really measure you on that.

1401
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,320
It's really all about the poses.

1402
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:39,680
And I really think that game is more of an exercise game than it is a music game, in

1403
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:40,680
my opinion.

1404
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:43,480
But, um, I realize people have their own opinions.

1405
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:47,180
So what music games did they miss?

1406
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:50,040
And I of course think they miss DDR.

1407
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:53,080
And I, I know, I know Bobby's typing his comment.

1408
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:54,840
It's games you're supposed to be able to play now.

1409
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:58,080
You can walk in any round one or Dave and Buster's and lots of other places and still

1410
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,080
play DDR.

1411
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:05,640
Uh, and I'm just surprised that the granddaddy of music games is not still on that list.

1412
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:11,240
So, um, other thoughts of other oversights, what do you guys think of that list?

1413
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,240
Theatry of them theater.

1414
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,520
Oh, that's an excellent choice.

1415
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,400
I realize you have to go back a little bit because that was a 3DS game.

1416
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:22,480
I think three theater rhythm ought to be revived.

1417
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:26,280
I thought they had newer versions that were like on PlayStation stuff.

1418
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:30,720
Like I thought they had console versions of those, uh, theater of them note was only

1419
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:31,720
on 3DS.

1420
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,960
Um, they have that ribbon.

1421
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:34,960
I'm kidding.

1422
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,520
They have that kingdom hearts game.

1423
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:40,960
Um, but some people were saying was theater of them successor.

1424
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,120
And my answer to that was, I hope not.

1425
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:47,000
I'm actually kind of relieved that kingdom hearts wasn't on this list.

1426
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,840
Sayonara wild hearts count.

1427
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:51,840
Good pick.

1428
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,040
Yes, yes, yes.

1429
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,040
Good pick Loki.

1430
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:57,320
I take, take off BPM and put, um, that one.

1431
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:58,320
Good answer.

1432
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,320
Good answer.

1433
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,320
Good answer.

1434
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:03,720
Uh, anything else jumping out at you guys?

1435
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:09,000
Some folks in chat are talking about, Ooh, Mike, but like, you know, Mike deaf says groove

1436
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,800
coaster and a Tycho no Tatujin.

1437
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,840
So I I'm all for a new version of a theater of them as well.

1438
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:16,840
That's for sure.

1439
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:17,840
All right.

1440
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:18,840
So there you go.

1441
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:24,840
Those are some gaming journalism, fluff pieces, and our take on them to help us fill the gap

1442
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,800
in the news this holiday season.

1443
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:27,960
I hope you enjoyed that.

1444
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:31,240
So maybe we'll do the segment again sometime during a slow news week, because when it's

1445
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:36,560
a slow news week for us, it's a slow news week for those ad revenue, uh, that those

1446
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,680
websites that need to show you full screen ads before you can read someone's hot take

1447
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,760
on what music games you should download.

1448
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:44,800
So there you go.

1449
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,520
And who knows how many of those music games paid to be placed on that list?

1450
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,520
We'll never know.

1451
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,600
All right.

1452
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:53,840
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this

1453
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,640
week in a segment we call how was your gaming week?

1454
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,340
So a dark Sakura, let's go to you.

1455
01:10:58,340 --> 01:10:59,680
How was your gaming week?

1456
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:03,120
Um, it was eventful.

1457
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:06,000
Of course I played a good bit of dead by daylight.

1458
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Like I do.

1459
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:13,200
Um, I've been streaming hot to full boyfriend holiday star, which, uh, I actually just finished

1460
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,240
the main story last night.

1461
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:20,960
Um, but now I'm doing the side stories, you know, I'm not going to do that tonight.

1462
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,760
Um, I'm still, I don't know.

1463
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:25,520
I might, I'm still going to be doing dead by daylight tonight.

1464
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,080
Um, uh, there's been some pinball.

1465
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:33,200
There's been that little tiny DDR that I just showed off.

1466
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:36,400
Um, I play, oh yeah.

1467
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,400
And Fantasian.

1468
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,500
I love Fantasian.

1469
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,680
It's actually such a good little RPG.

1470
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:44,280
I actually have a game I'm looking for.

1471
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:45,440
What's that?

1472
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,000
It's called internal section.

1473
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:52,360
It's kind of a tempest flight game, but it's got a pretty good soundtrack and it's a square

1474
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:56,200
game that did not see release in the U S and this one I've been wanting to get my hands

1475
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,240
on and now I'm kind of on the hunt for it.

1476
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:59,240
Okay.

1477
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,240
Interesting.

1478
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,240
Without me paying 70 bucks.

1479
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:03,040
All right.

1480
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,040
Let's go to Loki.

1481
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,040
Loki.

1482
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,040
How was your gaming week?

1483
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:07,760
It's all Minecraft again.

1484
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:13,920
Um, so yeah, I've been just playing a ton of Minecraft, um, hours and hours, hours just

1485
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,760
getting ready for like my next episode, actually working on it right now.

1486
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:24,000
Um, so I, earlier today I was, um, filming some stuff and then I have a building doing

1487
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
for that.

1488
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,800
So hopefully we'll have that out soon.

1489
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:27,920
All right.

1490
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:32,380
Uh, and for my gaming week, um, I would say the bulk of my gaming week, no surprise is

1491
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:40,460
still on the final fantasy 14 expansion, but on Christmas day yesterday, I beat Endwalker.

1492
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:42,760
So I am completely through the story.

1493
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:43,760
Everything's done.

1494
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:47,960
Uh, I even now I've run the expert dungeons thanks to free company and, you know, starting

1495
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:50,760
to explore some of the post game slash end game content.

1496
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,040
So, um, I will not get into spoilers.

1497
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,040
Don't worry.

1498
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:59,040
Um, however, since I have a lot to say about the story and I have a lot, I want to get

1499
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,240
off my chest about that journey.

1500
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:06,720
Uh, I thought it would be fun to just for funsies, uh, get my final fantasy buddy, Shane,

1501
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:12,640
uh, who you've heard on the network before together to do a spoiler filled final fantasy

1502
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:13,640
14 discussion.

1503
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:16,200
And that is going to be Wednesday night here at VOG network.

1504
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:20,360
Uh, I think it'll probably be about five Pacific, um, but stay tuned to our Twitter for all

1505
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:26,080
the details at VOG network and of course our discord, uh, VOG network.com slash discord,

1506
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,360
and we're going to have a spoiler filled and yes, it will be very clearly marked on the

1507
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:32,120
stream and all that stuff so that nobody accidentally gets spoiled.

1508
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:36,420
We're gonna have a spoiler filled discussion about Endwalker and how we felt about it because

1509
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:38,960
I'm sure Shane feels very similarly.

1510
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:42,560
We have feelings about some of the story and some of the things there.

1511
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:46,440
So we're going to do that, um, a little later this week.

1512
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:52,000
I will mention though that the journey to getting to beating this game was a little

1513
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:58,360
rough because they put out a patch on Tuesday to address some of these queue issues.

1514
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:02,940
The good news is they, they, I don't want to say they fixed the queuing issues because

1515
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:06,800
there is still queues and they are still sometimes thousands of people long.

1516
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:11,240
I do feel like they're getting smaller, but I don't know if that's just because the holiday

1517
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:15,200
or what, you know, and people traveling and going other, just having other things to do

1518
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:19,760
and what that's all about, but people are no longer erroring out while they're waiting

1519
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:20,760
in line.

1520
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:23,120
Uh, or at least I'm not hearing about it nearly as much.

1521
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:26,640
Um, so that, and that was the biggest issue most people had was getting kicked out of

1522
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,560
line after waiting in it for an hour, which can be very frustrating.

1523
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:32,560
So I think people are at a better place with the queue, even though square has long ways

1524
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,540
to go to fix the issue.

1525
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:35,540
That's not the issue.

1526
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:41,540
The issue for me is that a very small, few amount of PC players, including myself, and

1527
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:44,980
I know I'm not alone cause I've seen other people talking about it on Reddit and in Twitter

1528
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:48,460
threads, we are having very bad sound issues.

1529
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:51,300
Uh, it is like sound tearing.

1530
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:56,840
The sound will do something like this when you're trying to play the game, like it's

1531
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:01,340
very like stuttery and you probably had no idea even what I was trying to say there.

1532
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:02,340
And that's what it's feeling.

1533
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:06,100
It feels like when you're trying to play the game, uh, not like a hundred percent of

1534
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:10,980
the time, but when you get into intense action sequences, it does this again, a small amount

1535
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:12,500
of players are seeing this.

1536
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:15,940
The patch on Tuesday was supposed to address these issues.

1537
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:16,940
Made it worse.

1538
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:17,940
Yes.

1539
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:21,740
I read Yoshi P's letter and I did everything he said, didn't change a damn thing.

1540
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:25,300
I need them to revert the sound driver back to the last version.

1541
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:30,580
Um, which, you know, and some people say that modders might be able to fix the last at it's

1542
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:33,700
hard because it's an MMO Loki, but at this point I feel like that's the only way it's

1543
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:34,700
going to get fixed.

1544
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:35,700
Uh, yeah.

1545
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:38,020
And Zebun chat says it's not happening to everyone though.

1546
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:39,020
Right.

1547
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:42,580
And the problem is, is that, and this is the reality.

1548
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:47,700
If it's not happening to a person, then it's not a problem.

1549
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:52,100
So it's really only a problem for me and the minority of players, maybe, I don't know,

1550
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:55,900
maybe 1% of PC players, maybe even less than that who are having these issues.

1551
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:57,340
It's a huge problem.

1552
01:15:57,340 --> 01:16:03,100
And I got to the point on Tuesday or whatever day the patch came out, because it got worse,

1553
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,940
that I was hovering over the cancel button.

1554
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:11,140
Like I was, and I have, y'all know, I have, stand that game hard since the day it came

1555
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:12,140
out.

1556
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:18,620
Um, even 1.0 I played, I was just so, I felt so defeated by the fact that I couldn't even

1557
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:20,620
play this thing that I enjoyed.

1558
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:26,980
Um, but I, I, then I realized, Oh dummy, you play for three months at a time, so you're

1559
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:30,460
paid through through February anyway.

1560
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:32,260
So what did my stupid ass do?

1561
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:36,260
I figured out that the only way I'm going to be able to actually get through the story

1562
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:43,060
and not get spoiled any more than I already had been, was to buy it on PlayStation four

1563
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:46,960
and get a PlayStation license because I knew I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have the problem

1564
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,340
on PlayStation.

1565
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:52,300
So I mean, what, it's not like it's the first time I've bought a game on two different consoles,

1566
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,300
right?

1567
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:57,660
I bought Endwalker on PlayStation four and got that license.

1568
01:16:57,660 --> 01:16:59,060
That's how I beat the game.

1569
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:03,140
And I've been playing on keyboard and mouse on PlayStation four, and it's not the best,

1570
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:08,380
but I will take it versus the sound issues I was having were going through dungeons was

1571
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:10,700
giving me a headache quite honestly.

1572
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:13,340
Um, so at least I finally got through the story.

1573
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:15,660
I still need them to fix the client.

1574
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:20,780
I'm worried if they're ever going to, because again, if the problem isn't there, then people

1575
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:23,340
say it doesn't exist.

1576
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:25,160
Anyway.

1577
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:30,460
So overall, I really enjoyed the expansion.

1578
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:32,940
I don't think it's my favorite expansion story wise.

1579
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:34,780
I think it's somewhere in the middle for me.

1580
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:39,260
I'll get into the reasons why in the spoiler cast, but I did think it was a good end and

1581
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:45,260
there were, I think for me, there was a lot of peaks and valleys.

1582
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:48,540
There were some things that were like, this is better than the game's ever been.

1583
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:53,700
Like the whole last zone up until a point was so, so good.

1584
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:57,660
I was like, Oh, this is, this is, this is the best this game's ever been.

1585
01:17:57,660 --> 01:18:01,380
And then you get to valleys and some of the worst that the game's ever been quite, and

1586
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:03,340
I don't have a nice way to say it.

1587
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:08,620
And for me, that would be things like the, the, the brilliant idea to add stealth quests

1588
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:13,960
into the game that are a little bit moody and temperamental in the way they work, uh,

1589
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:18,220
and escort quests, which is, you know, something vanilla allow had.

1590
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:21,460
So those are some things that are a little bit more value.

1591
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:25,300
And then there's some story things I don't want to say right now, but I I'll say later.

1592
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:30,300
Um, so peaks and valleys for me, but I do think at the end of the day, I think as we

1593
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:35,660
get into the patch expansions, the point one, the point two and so forth, what is a peak

1594
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:42,180
for the game is the technical end of it and the way it plays all of the jobs, as far as

1595
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:46,500
I've seen and heard, they are all in a better place than they've ever been.

1596
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:52,660
And every job is really fun to play right now, even barred, even monk, you know, and

1597
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:57,220
the things that usually we're getting shit on previously are all really fun to play right

1598
01:18:57,220 --> 01:18:58,220
now.

1599
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:02,560
And at the end of the day, that is probably more important than the story is, is the day

1600
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:05,360
to day, like actual gameplay really fun?

1601
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,780
And the answer is yes.

1602
01:19:07,780 --> 01:19:11,520
So that's in short, my take on Final Fantasy 14.

1603
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:15,460
Other than that, I've also still been playing quite a bit of dead by daylight, especially

1604
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:19,300
that day and a half the Final Fantasy and I were fighting, I was trying to get a lot

1605
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:21,260
of blood points in a dead by daylight.

1606
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:24,660
And I'm trying to prestige Cheryl slash James again.

1607
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:27,520
And I'm just about to prestige too.

1608
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:34,260
So I'm about to get to level 50 again, and then prestige Cheryl again, so Dr. Did you

1609
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:35,260
nice?

1610
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:37,420
Oh, and I got a debt trapper.

1611
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:38,420
Oh, cool.

1612
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:39,420
Okay.

1613
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:40,420
Oh, wow.

1614
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:42,220
That's hard to get those a debt.

1615
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:44,980
I got it the first try.

1616
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:45,980
Congrats.

1617
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:48,700
You must have had some survivors that were like babies.

1618
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:49,700
No.

1619
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:50,700
Really?

1620
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:52,180
It was a really good match.

1621
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:53,180
Good for you.

1622
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:54,180
Well, good.

1623
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:55,180
That makes me feel better.

1624
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:57,580
But the thing is, is that I've talked to four other people now who have said that they got

1625
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:58,740
it their first try.

1626
01:19:58,740 --> 01:19:59,740
Huh?

1627
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:00,740
Maybe I need to try it.

1628
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:01,740
Let's see.

1629
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:02,820
Go for it.

1630
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:04,020
It was easier than I thought.

1631
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:06,820
And on top of that, it was on Macmillan's.

1632
01:20:06,820 --> 01:20:10,020
All right.

1633
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:11,020
That's really bad.

1634
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:12,020
Doctor was harder.

1635
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:13,820
Good for my gaming week.

1636
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:17,900
Um, so yeah, I'll probably this week we'll put probably some more fall fantasy 14 no

1637
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:22,060
man's sky expedition four is going to be, I think next week three is happening right

1638
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:23,060
now.

1639
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:25,020
Alan has already finished it.

1640
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,640
He didn't even get a chance to stream it.

1641
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:30,820
He played, he just put the pedal to the metal on expedition three and already finished it

1642
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:32,060
in like three days.

1643
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:34,460
So that's kind of kind of neat.

1644
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:37,620
So I'm really excited to get through expedition four in no man's sky.

1645
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:41,980
And then Alan and I are talking about playing like a co-op game together with all the rewards.

1646
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:43,940
From the expeditions.

1647
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:44,940
I think that'll be really fun.

1648
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:45,940
All right.

1649
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:46,940
I know we had some.

1650
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:47,940
Oh, go ahead.

1651
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:48,940
If I may.

1652
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:50,580
I also forgot to say to those celebrating it.

1653
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:51,580
Happy Kwanzaa today.

1654
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:52,820
Yes, of course.

1655
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:53,820
Happy Kwanzaa.

1656
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:54,820
Um.

1657
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:55,820
Cause that is actually today.

1658
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:58,020
I think you did say boxing at the top of the show.

1659
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:00,340
Uh, what else is, is there anything else today?

1660
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:01,340
I don't know.

1661
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:02,340
There's um.

1662
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:06,260
Happy me shoving all this stuff in my face days.

1663
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:07,260
Happy cookies.

1664
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:08,260
All right.

1665
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:12,020
Um, we do have a few news articles to talk about tonight.

1666
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:14,180
We don't have as many as we would have on the normal show.

1667
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:18,020
Uh, that's why we let the kickoff topic take a lot more time tonight, but we do have a

1668
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:19,700
few articles to talk about.

1669
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:23,220
Uh, definitely this first one, I think we want to do a little bit of a Nelson laugh

1670
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:24,220
maybe.

1671
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:25,220
I don't know.

1672
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:26,220
Maybe we don't.

1673
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:27,220
Uh, Loki.

1674
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:28,220
Why don't you get into this first article tonight?

1675
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:29,220
Yeah.

1676
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:34,420
So, Hey, you remember those wonderful, uh, Ubisoft courts, um, that whole service where

1677
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:40,100
they were selling these things called digits, which were basically in game NFTs.

1678
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:44,260
Well, they haven't sold many of them.

1679
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:52,980
Um, it looks like roughly they sold 15, um, but that's not what you saw putting that number

1680
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:53,980
out.

1681
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:54,980
How did they figure that out?

1682
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:55,980
That only 15 have sold.

1683
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:59,620
Is that like watching people's wallets, which I know they can do in crypto.

1684
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:05,460
So, um, they were looking at, cause you know, with these, they can actually, um, take a

1685
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:07,700
look at, you know, cause it's on the blockchain.

1686
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:11,700
They can take a look at, you know, how many were minted and all that stuff.

1687
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:19,020
Um, so they were looking at, um, I guess a couple of authorized resellers, so raritable

1688
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:25,500
and object, and you kind of looking at, you know, what was selling on those.

1689
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:33,780
So right now they said there's only a handful of sales that was a 94.49 tezos, which is

1690
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:41,380
like guess 380 bucks, but yeah, not very, um, very many have sold so far, which makes

1691
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:47,000
sense because you have to play the game for 600 hours and just, yeah.

1692
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:52,300
So it appears the marketplace is rejecting the NFTs.

1693
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:55,300
So does that mean we're, we're free of them?

1694
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:58,300
We're going to be rid of NFTs forever now in gaming.

1695
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:05,140
Oh, Oh, somebody is going to try to find that magic formula to make it work.

1696
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:06,140
Huh?

1697
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:07,140
Exactly.

1698
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:15,500
And, um, of course there has been, you know, comments regarding, you know, people not liking

1699
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:16,500
the NFTs.

1700
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:24,800
Um, so coming from Ubisoft's blockchain technical director, um, Didier Geneva's, he was saying

1701
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:30,640
that we're doing this anyways, you just need time to get used to it.

1702
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:37,280
Gee, uh, I'm sorry.

1703
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,320
That's what it boils down to.

1704
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,320
That was a paraphrase.

1705
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:43,000
Uh, what he basically said was we have received a lot of feedback since the announcement.

1706
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,920
We hear both the encouragement and the concerns.

1707
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,080
What encouragement no one's encouraging you.

1708
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:51,360
Uh, we understand there is, there is low key to be fair.

1709
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:55,860
There is absolutely because I've seen it and I know people that are in it.

1710
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:59,560
And I, and here's the thing, like, I'm not trying to be a total curmudgeon about the

1711
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:00,560
NFTs.

1712
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,320
I'm trying to get, have an open mind with it.

1713
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:09,320
And I see people on social media, but there is absolutely in on Twitter, on Facebook,

1714
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:15,160
on blog, there is an echo chamber of people gassing each other up that NFTs are the next

1715
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:16,400
big thing.

1716
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:19,080
Whereas the rest of us, and some of you may be involved in it too.

1717
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:22,640
And I'm not, again, this is not a personal attack, but I hope you understand that the

1718
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:27,580
rest of us are looking in from the outside going, this doesn't make sense.

1719
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:32,120
And until here's the thing, I'm sorry to the NFT bros out there.

1720
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:38,680
You have to convince me to get in on this for this to be successful.

1721
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:41,620
You can't sit there and say, well, everybody else is an idiot.

1722
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:43,040
This is the next big thing.

1723
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,040
You're a dummy.

1724
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:47,600
If you don't understand it, it cause guess what that is going to lead to an echo chamber

1725
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,400
that goes down the drain.

1726
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:50,880
No, I get it.

1727
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:56,160
You're basically buying and selling artwork, but it's digital artwork.

1728
01:24:56,160 --> 01:25:03,660
You don't get any actual, like, sure you have digital ownership of it, but like, is this

1729
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:07,160
JPEG worth like the money that you're seeing it's worth?

1730
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:08,280
No, it's not.

1731
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:09,360
I'm sorry.

1732
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:10,920
And it's not really exclusive.

1733
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:15,560
Like if I bought a painting, sure, I could take a picture of it and you could have a

1734
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:21,480
picture of it and you could see the picture of the painting, but it's not a one-to-one

1735
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:24,400
exact duplication of it.

1736
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:30,760
Whereas if I go on the internet and I have an NFT image that's out there, I could make

1737
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:34,020
a direct copy of it and it would cost me nothing.

1738
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:36,840
I have to read this and direct it to you in chat because I think this hits the nail on

1739
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:37,840
the head.

1740
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,700
Dartica in our chat over twitch.tv slash vog network says someone on Twitter compared it

1741
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:45,200
to the company selling stars from other galaxies.

1742
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:46,440
The whole thing from years ago.

1743
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:47,920
Oh, they still do that.

1744
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:48,920
Absolutely.

1745
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:49,920
Get sell a star.

1746
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,760
That is, that is so good.

1747
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:55,800
They already such a good explanation.

1748
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:00,940
It is exactly like that because they even have like these quote unquote games that are

1749
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:02,520
going on with NFTs.

1750
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:09,440
So like they have one where you basically buying land like on earth.

1751
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:14,080
So it's like I go onto Google earth and like, I like that piece and I'm going to buy it

1752
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,080
as an NFT.

1753
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:21,800
E3VL is bringing up the Spiderman NFTs cause a lot of people got them cause you know, the,

1754
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,440
the no way home movie is huge.

1755
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:27,040
Tons of people are seeing it and I guess what was the first hundred thousand or something

1756
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,720
got some sort of NFT in their email.

1757
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,480
And I think a lot of people are going great.

1758
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:35,880
And now people are, I have seen people again, people I know and people I watch on Twitter

1759
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:38,320
are trying to sell those NFTs on Twitter.

1760
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:42,760
I don't know if they're being successful or what, but my, my question is, okay, so what

1761
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:43,760
does it do?

1762
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,200
It's just proof of ownership.

1763
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,680
It's my little virtual badge.

1764
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:53,920
I saw the, the Spiderman movie before any y'all or whatever.

1765
01:26:53,920 --> 01:27:02,680
It would be like if, for example, on, um, steam where you get like little trading papers

1766
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:07,920
and emojis trading cards, whatever the case may be, but each one of those were uniquely

1767
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,480
numbered and unique.

1768
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:12,740
Um, you could then trade those and sell them.

1769
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:14,020
That's basically what this is.

1770
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:20,100
You get a free little image of something and you're going to try to sell it for money.

1771
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:24,960
And this is the thing, and again, NFT folks, this is, this is where my brain breaks down

1772
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:30,160
because I go, but the steam marketplace, which has nothing to do with crypto, nothing to

1773
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:35,580
do with NFT, the steam marketplace already has that where you buy and sell the cards,

1774
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:39,660
buy and sell the emoji crafting, all this, all of that is already built into steam.

1775
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:41,240
It doesn't need an NFT.

1776
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:46,020
And I will understand before, again, I hear people typing in chat already.

1777
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:51,820
I do understand that steam is centralized and maybe you don't like valve.

1778
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:53,900
Maybe you don't like banks or all that stuff.

1779
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:58,560
And then, uh, the, the NFTs and the crypto is all decentralized.

1780
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:02,440
It's the Swiss bank of all this stuff for people too, with everybody getting ripped

1781
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:04,520
off for thousands or millions of dollars.

1782
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:11,140
But then my other thought is, is it really that outside when you have these big companies

1783
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:15,960
that are still getting involved, like you're, you're sure, okay, you're doing the dealing

1784
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:20,660
in crypto, but it's like, you're still passing the money through the NFT, the item through

1785
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:24,020
Ubisoft one way or another.

1786
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:26,620
It's like, are you really being that underground with it?

1787
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:27,620
I don't know.

1788
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:28,620
That's I guess what I don't get.

1789
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:29,620
So anyway.

1790
01:28:29,620 --> 01:28:34,780
Well, um, you know, what we really should be looking at instead of NFTs, you know, in

1791
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:39,700
Ubisoft games is why they haven't addressed the sexual harassment allegations that have

1792
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:42,300
gone on for their company for the longest time.

1793
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:43,300
Great question.

1794
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:49,100
And, you know, because of that, you know, they're also having a surprisingly high turnover.

1795
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:53,260
You don't say because, you know, they're saying that the pay isn't great.

1796
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:57,940
Competitive opportunities are out there and they're freshly or frustrating, frustrated

1797
01:28:57,940 --> 01:29:02,360
at the handling of the scandals and pushing NFTs instead.

1798
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:03,360
So

1799
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:10,660
So Ubisoft's executives are telling the consumers what they want and not listening to what the

1800
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:18,500
market is saying, and they're losing employees and, um, not able to keep the talent in house.

1801
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:25,120
So honestly, all of the things that an executive is supposed to do, the executives are failing

1802
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,120
at.

1803
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:27,120
Is that correct at Ubisoft?

1804
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,120
Yeah.

1805
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:30,760
So Yves Guillemont has a fucking job.

1806
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:31,760
Why?

1807
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,620
Because if I don't do my fucking job, I get let go.

1808
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:37,040
Why does Yves Guillemont have a fucking job?

1809
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:39,220
I don't understand this industry sometimes.

1810
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:41,040
I really don't.

1811
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,200
It's fuck him.

1812
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:43,760
Fuck Bobby Kotick.

1813
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,220
Fuck a lot of these executives generally.

1814
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:50,480
I mean, some some game companies are all right, but generally fuck a lot of these executives

1815
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,480
are terrible.

1816
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:58,840
Anyway, on that happy note, let's move on.

1817
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:02,400
Let's talk about the Final Fantasy pixel remasters.

1818
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:06,280
A lot of them are already available, but people are waiting for the big one.

1819
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:12,840
I think four is kind of a big one, but six is really the one Final Fantasy 6 pixel remaster.

1820
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:13,840
When is it coming out?

1821
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:16,640
And the answer is it's getting pushed back just a little bit.

1822
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:20,760
It was supposed to be out this year, but Square is going to be bumping it back to February

1823
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:22,420
2022.

1824
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:26,740
And Square Enix is talking about that they need the time, need the extra time to apply

1825
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:27,740
the final.

1826
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:28,740
Oops.

1827
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:29,740
Oops.

1828
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:30,740
Sorry, guys.

1829
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:31,740
I hit the wrong button.

1830
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:32,740
We're not ready for that segment yet.

1831
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:33,740
Sorry.

1832
01:30:33,740 --> 01:30:35,300
I meant to hit the down button.

1833
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:36,300
Mistakes happen live.

1834
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:38,380
That's why you tune in to hear all the mistakes.

1835
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:39,380
All right.

1836
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:44,540
So the Final Fantasy pixel remaster again, Final Fantasy 6 delayed to February 2022.

1837
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:49,000
I mean, I guess Final Fantasy 6 is a classic game, so maybe the music was appropriate,

1838
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,380
but it's not the selection for tonight.

1839
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:53,380
All right.

1840
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:58,660
So Final Fantasy 6 pixel remaster will be out on PC, Steam, iOS, and Android in February

1841
01:30:58,660 --> 01:31:00,460
of 2022.

1842
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:04,400
If you've already pre-purchased the game, Square Enix is trying to, and notice that's

1843
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,580
pre-purchase, not pre-order.

1844
01:31:06,580 --> 01:31:08,860
That's already paid full price for the game.

1845
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:13,740
You're going to get some extra soundtrack items, including time-lapse remixes of Locke's

1846
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:16,940
theme, the Decisive Battle, Terra's theme, Searching for Friends.

1847
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:21,940
A time-lapse remix is a soundtrack data that starts with the original version and blends

1848
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:24,420
into the alternative soundtrack version.

1849
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:28,420
And then, of course, two wallpapers talking about things that are pretty easy to see.

1850
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:29,420
Wow.

1851
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:30,420
Wallpapers.

1852
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:31,420
I know, right?

1853
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:32,420
Yeah, it's kind of, kind of...

1854
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:36,140
Maybe I'll get a screensaver with it too.

1855
01:31:36,140 --> 01:31:39,140
Little flying toasters with Final Fantasy 6 pictures on them.

1856
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:40,140
Yeah, exactly.

1857
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:48,460
So anyway, and when I heard that news, I was like, all right, that will probably, let's

1858
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:54,180
see, if that comes out in February, then that means E3 summer is about four months away.

1859
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:57,820
That should be enough time for them to announce that they're going to take the Pixel remasters

1860
01:31:57,820 --> 01:32:02,700
and put them all out on consoles so we can finally have this on Switch, on PlayStation,

1861
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:05,580
on Xbox maybe, and all that good stuff, right?

1862
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:06,580
Right?

1863
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:07,980
Because that's what I'm waiting for.

1864
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:09,980
I hope so.

1865
01:32:09,980 --> 01:32:10,980
All right.

1866
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:11,980
Moving on.

1867
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:13,980
Dark Sakura.

1868
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:16,940
An interesting one in the news news.

1869
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:20,940
You're on mute.

1870
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:21,940
So Dark Sakura.

1871
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:22,940
Yeah.

1872
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:23,940
Oh, there we go.

1873
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:24,940
So this...

1874
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:28,500
Well, I don't want to talk to anybody anyway.

1875
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:36,460
So it had been brought up before how you could play video games on the touchscreen in a Tesla,

1876
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:37,460
right?

1877
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:38,460
Not anymore.

1878
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:44,780
At least while it's in motion, they are no longer going to allow video games to be played

1879
01:32:44,780 --> 01:32:47,820
on the touchscreen when it's in motion.

1880
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:53,820
This is after a safety investigation happened.

1881
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:58,340
So basically, they put out a statement saying that...

1882
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:02,020
I'm just going to read the quote following the opening of a preliminary evaluation of

1883
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:04,580
Tesla's passenger play.

1884
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:12,180
Hold on, they said, in a new software update, it will now be locked and unusable when the

1885
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:14,740
vehicle is in motion.

1886
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:20,500
So it's been something available since December 2020.

1887
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:25,380
But as it is intended to be played by passengers, it hasn't always worked out that way.

1888
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:27,460
There have been drivers playing it.

1889
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:33,140
And so when you have people who are irresponsible, your toys get taken away.

1890
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:36,340
And honestly, it shouldn't have been in the fucking thing to begin with.

1891
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:42,060
Well, and to be clear, there are games in the device that were always meant to be played

1892
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:45,380
while the car is charging, while the car is parked.

1893
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:46,380
That sort of thing.

1894
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:52,460
Because when you drive a Tesla, your gas stops, and I'm using my quotey fingers, often end

1895
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:54,420
up being a little longer.

1896
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:56,740
So the games is to give you something to do.

1897
01:33:56,740 --> 01:34:01,260
And there's video apps too, like Disney Plus and stuff on the Tesla, to help you pass the

1898
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:04,700
time when you're at these stops getting the electricity.

1899
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:06,660
And you might be wondering, why would I spend electricity?

1900
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:07,660
Use your phone.

1901
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:10,380
And some do, but it's fun to have it in the car too.

1902
01:34:10,380 --> 01:34:11,380
It's unnecessary.

1903
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:12,380
I disagree.

1904
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:13,380
100%.

1905
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:19,660
No, it actually is literally not a necessary thing to have in a car.

1906
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:25,220
What's necessary in a car is a speedometer, is your accelerator, is the things that are

1907
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:27,540
used to control the car.

1908
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:28,540
Air conditioner.

1909
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:29,540
Those are necessary.

1910
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:30,540
Okay.

1911
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:35,540
Well, my opinion is, and I'd like to state my opinion, is that there is a benefit to

1912
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:39,460
having these things in the vehicle for the charging amount of time.

1913
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:42,940
And the people that I've talked to, the Tesla owners, when they're parked and stuff, it

1914
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:48,100
is a nice alternative because perhaps they want to have something that they and the passenger

1915
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:52,380
and the kids in the back seat can all participate in together, which you can't really do on

1916
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:53,380
a phone.

1917
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:54,380
So I don't think...

1918
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:57,100
I also agree that air conditioners aren't necessary either.

1919
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:59,100
So this is...

1920
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:00,100
Body.

1921
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:01,100
Okay.

1922
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:04,060
Well then, when you purchase a cardboard box on wheels and that's your way to get around,

1923
01:35:04,060 --> 01:35:05,060
let us know.

1924
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:07,620
I have a 69 Mustang, Rob.

1925
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:10,180
Is that the car you actively drive right now?

1926
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:11,180
It was.

1927
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:12,180
Okay.

1928
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:13,180
Anyway.

1929
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:14,180
So...

1930
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:15,500
But not in a long time.

1931
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:16,500
All right.

1932
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:21,460
So anyway, my point is with this is that this is meant to be played when the cars are in

1933
01:35:21,460 --> 01:35:25,740
park and all this stuff and you're resting at the stop and all this stuff.

1934
01:35:25,740 --> 01:35:30,060
For some reason, they got the bright idea like, oh, well, let's do this thing where

1935
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:32,140
the passengers can play the games.

1936
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:35,780
And there was only a few games, there's only like three of the games that people could

1937
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:36,980
play as a passenger.

1938
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:40,180
But as you mentioned, people couldn't follow the rules.

1939
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:42,660
They just hit the button, confirm you're a passenger.

1940
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:43,660
Yes, of course.

1941
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:44,660
Yes, of course.

1942
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:46,080
And then they're playing the games and no shit.

1943
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:47,420
People got into trouble about that.

1944
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:51,920
That was a dumb, dumb idea to have some of the games in passenger mode.

1945
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:55,060
And I think there was a little bit of a standoff going on between the government and Tesla,

1946
01:35:55,060 --> 01:35:57,180
because this didn't even happen until just a couple of days ago.

1947
01:35:57,180 --> 01:36:01,820
We're finally in this game of Texas Hold'em, Tesla folded and said, all right, nevermind,

1948
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:04,580
we're gonna turn it off because of what's going on.

1949
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:05,580
Which yes, I agree.

1950
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:07,060
Yes is a good thing.

1951
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:12,100
But I don't see the harm in having it for its intended purpose of entertaining everybody

1952
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:13,100
in the vehicle.

1953
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:16,700
When honestly, and everything, everything I've talked to with Bobby and I know other

1954
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:21,600
Tesla owners as well, the video game thing is a show off thing.

1955
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,180
It's like, look, I can play Sonic in the car.

1956
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:25,940
All right, that was fun.

1957
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:28,900
It's like running Doom on a toaster.

1958
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:32,100
You did it to say you did it, but you're not actually going to play all the way through

1959
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:35,440
Doom on a toaster, unless you're that one person on the, there's always that one person

1960
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:36,440
on Reddit.

1961
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:37,600
I sped run Doom on a toaster.

1962
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:38,600
Great.

1963
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:39,600
Hooray for you.

1964
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:40,880
We're also thrilled for you.

1965
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:46,640
But for most people, it's not like something they take very seriously.

1966
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:52,240
And to also tell Bobby, a radio doesn't fucking require that you look at it to interact with

1967
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:53,240
it.

1968
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,520
All right.

1969
01:36:54,520 --> 01:37:00,800
A lot of radio controls are now built into the wheel.

1970
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:03,680
It's absolutely there as a distraction.

1971
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:06,040
It is not a safety feature.

1972
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:11,760
It's an entertainment, but item that can cause a real dangerous distraction to people.

1973
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:13,720
All right.

1974
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:16,560
Let's move on to our next story.

1975
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:17,560
And Loki.

1976
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:19,300
All right.

1977
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:24,200
So it's just like, this is just the year that keeps on giving.

1978
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:29,120
But now GameStop is apparently letting you pay with crypto.

1979
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:31,560
Well, different crypto, I guess.

1980
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:36,420
So they're taking even some meme cryptos as well.

1981
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:41,380
So apparently, they've joined with flexa, which is a payment network that lets you use

1982
01:37:41,380 --> 01:37:45,360
different currency including dogecoin.

1983
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:51,280
Yay, I have a use for dogecoin now.

1984
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:55,120
Not sure what else they're gonna if they're taking like Shiba coin and stuff like that

1985
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:56,120
now.

1986
01:37:56,120 --> 01:38:04,120
They're also doing mana, sand, and some other stuff.

1987
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:07,360
But yeah, it'll be interesting to see what other cryptocurrencies they take.

1988
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:11,020
But I think it's just kind of a gimmick.

1989
01:38:11,020 --> 01:38:13,460
And it's all through this third party thing, right?

1990
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:18,160
So it's not like GameStop employees are actually having to necessarily learn about cryptocurrency

1991
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:22,720
outside of how to process a different type of payment in an app or something like that,

1992
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:23,720
right?

1993
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:24,720
Yeah.

1994
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:29,840
And they're also taking Shiba coin, so they do take that, I am seeing that now, Bitcoin

1995
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,840
and Litecoin.

1996
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:39,360
Okay, so to be fair, so I talked kind of blah on the NFT stuff earlier.

1997
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:42,640
Now let's say something positive about the whole crypto thing.

1998
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:49,440
This is the end game for that market is the ability to use crypto to get goods and services

1999
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:52,280
of which, say what you will about GameStop.

2000
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:56,620
They provide a goods and service that a lot of people are super into.

2001
01:38:56,620 --> 01:38:58,520
So this is the end game for that.

2002
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:03,640
So it's interesting, I mean, I don't know if I'm ready to make a payment.

2003
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:06,460
The thing is, those things are so volatile.

2004
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:12,320
That's like right now, the amount of these are so volatile, it's like gambling.

2005
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:14,960
It's like you perpetually have money in a slot machine.

2006
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:16,960
When you win, you win, good for you.

2007
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:20,880
And you can turn that around and put it right back into GameStop or whatever it is.

2008
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:25,120
But I just, I don't like to hold my money there right now.

2009
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:30,000
But if there was some stability and things like that, maybe I'd be more inclined to do

2010
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
it.

2011
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
I don't know.

2012
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,520
So yeah, that's interesting.

2013
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:38,800
So I don't think I'll be making crypto payments to GameStop anytime soon, though.

2014
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:43,200
But neat, I guess, for those that maybe have a little bit more in their wallet.

2015
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:45,840
All right, moving on.

2016
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:49,920
Let's talk about, oh, this is one of my favorite retro companies.

2017
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:54,280
And I know they're sitting on some good properties, and that is Sunsoft.

2018
01:39:54,280 --> 01:40:00,120
And Sunsoft is looking at maybe doing more of their retro catalog as remakes.

2019
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:04,480
And of course, one of the big ones, yeah, hell yeah, one of the big ones, Quest, baby.

2020
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:05,480
I wish.

2021
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:07,600
I mean, there's a little more licensing that comes into that.

2022
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:10,520
But I also, Blaster Master's the big one.

2023
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:13,680
But Blaster Master Zero, hello, is already a thing.

2024
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:15,120
And they've actually done three of them.

2025
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:18,440
So they did that first one that was kind of a loose remake of the first game.

2026
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:21,960
And now it's spun off into its own trilogy that, you know, obviously the second game

2027
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:26,520
doesn't, as far as I know, really tie to the Genesis one or anything that otherwise was

2028
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:27,520
in canon.

2029
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,360
But it kind of does its own thing, and it's done it well.

2030
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:36,320
Like it's a good trilogy, and in my opinion, Inti Creates kind of did a real bang up job

2031
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,640
with a retro property done right.

2032
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:40,680
I would love to see them take on others.

2033
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:46,360
Well, Sunsoft on their Twitter account, Sunsoft Games wrote a tweet this week that said, hope

2034
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:53,640
your holiday season is fun and festive, BTW, that's internet speak for by the way, we're

2035
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:57,400
thinking about remaking our retro titles in the near future.

2036
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:59,800
Could you tell us which ones you'd prefer?

2037
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:05,040
If you have any, shout us out on Twitter using Sunsoft Games, we'll refer to them.

2038
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,320
Thanks all.

2039
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:09,880
And of course, actually, I am curious, what kind of replies are they getting?

2040
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:10,880
Hold on.

2041
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:13,120
I want to read some of these replies here by going over to Twitter.

2042
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:17,520
I don't really remember anything other than like, they had, you know, Blaster Master,

2043
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:18,520
was it?

2044
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:27,840
Do they have, what was that game, nevermind, I lost it.

2045
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:32,360
Here's to help you remember, here's some of the replies they're getting.

2046
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:35,520
Journey to Silius is in the first reply.

2047
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:39,200
And I do remember, I think Dark Soccer may have highlighted that as a game of the week

2048
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,200
ones.

2049
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:41,200
I did for music.

2050
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:42,200
Oh, the music.

2051
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:46,040
Because that was one that was, like, it was supposed to be a Terminator game and didn't,

2052
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:48,040
like, that was the whole story behind that, right?

2053
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:49,040
I think.

2054
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:51,280
So that was a big one.

2055
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:54,480
They're mentioning 53 stations of the Tokaido.

2056
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:56,560
That's obscure.

2057
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:57,560
Yeah.

2058
01:41:57,560 --> 01:41:59,280
The wing of Medulla Heberike.

2059
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:07,280
Let's see, I'm trying to see some more that they have here on the list.

2060
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:10,640
Somebody brought up that they did do the Batman NES and Famicom games.

2061
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:11,640
That is true.

2062
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:14,280
Obviously the licensing would be a little harder now at this point.

2063
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:21,040
So there is that, lots of people in the replies saying Heberike, Gimmick, and so forth.

2064
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:25,600
But you're right, I have a hard time remembering what they had outside of Blaster Master that

2065
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:30,900
wasn't a more complicated license, like you say, the Fester's Quest and that whole sort

2066
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:31,900
of thing.

2067
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:37,680
So yeah, and DJ Rama S kind of lights that up saying, ooh, Journey to Silius.

2068
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:40,140
Yeah, I think there's a lot of people that would be very into that.

2069
01:42:40,140 --> 01:42:42,060
So who knows?

2070
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:44,340
It could be something that gets approached later.

2071
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:47,820
All right, Sunsoft is taking all your ideas right now.

2072
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:52,100
All right, a couple more stories, then we'll get to the classic game of the week.

2073
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:55,540
But first, Dark Sakura.

2074
01:42:55,540 --> 01:42:57,380
There's another mini arcade machine coming out.

2075
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:59,700
It's the Taito Egret 2 mini.

2076
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:06,020
It's supposed to be coming out in 2022 with 40 different arcade games in it.

2077
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:08,020
I don't see what the list is.

2078
01:43:08,900 --> 01:43:14,620
Arcanoid, Strike Bowling, Plump Pop.

2079
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:15,620
So yeah, there you go.

2080
01:43:15,620 --> 01:43:18,700
If you like mini arcade cabinets, go get one.

2081
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:21,260
I do love mini arcade cabinets.

2082
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:22,980
There's just so many of them now.

2083
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:25,820
It's hard to figure out which ones I want to get more than others.

2084
01:43:25,820 --> 01:43:29,780
We just last week had that vertical Sega one that's on its way out too.

2085
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:31,780
So there's just a lot of good ones.

2086
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:34,180
So it's the time to be a collector.

2087
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:36,260
All right, Loki.

2088
01:43:36,980 --> 01:43:43,380
All right, so if I don't know when we're going to have this has been one of those things

2089
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:46,140
we were talking about, when are we going to get a date for this?

2090
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:50,060
But apparently, the Call of Duty studio, that's

2091
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:55,980
which one they're like all Call of Duty studios, Treyarch has

2092
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:58,860
vaguely promised to do better

2093
01:43:58,860 --> 01:44:04,220
regarding all the sexual harassment, sexism and bullying

2094
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:09,780
notices that have been going out about all sorts of areas in Activision.

2095
01:44:09,780 --> 01:44:12,820
Our goal as a studio is to make awesome games for the world to enjoy,

2096
01:44:12,820 --> 01:44:14,100
having the privilege to pursue.

2097
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:18,740
And that endeavor is made possible because of Treyarch people.

2098
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:22,220
We are a studio comprised of smart, talented, world class creative professionals.

2099
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:23,980
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2100
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:27,780
Our culture has no room for sexism, harassment, racism, bigotry,

2101
01:44:27,780 --> 01:44:30,020
discrimination or bullying.

2102
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:31,900
But yet we find a way.

2103
01:44:31,940 --> 01:44:33,740
As we move forward, I added that part.

2104
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:38,260
As we move forward, providing a safe, diverse, inclusive working environment

2105
01:44:38,260 --> 01:44:42,460
so that many will thrive will be our highest priority.

2106
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:44,460
Cool. How are you going to do that?

2107
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:46,860
Yeah. How about some details?

2108
01:44:46,860 --> 01:44:49,900
How about some some, you know, things besides words?

2109
01:44:49,900 --> 01:44:51,540
How is it meaningful action?

2110
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:53,260
I think is a good way to put it.

2111
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:55,740
Yeah. So we'll see.

2112
01:44:55,740 --> 01:44:58,140
Promises. Hmm. All right.

2113
01:44:58,980 --> 01:45:04,780
And our last story tonight is this is kind of sad.

2114
01:45:04,780 --> 01:45:09,100
It's an arcade we've all here at OLR actually been to once.

2115
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:10,780
I know we went here once. Yeah.

2116
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:14,020
Seattle Gameworks is going to be closing.

2117
01:45:14,020 --> 01:45:17,460
And some folks say, oh, this is from The Last of Us, too,

2118
01:45:17,460 --> 01:45:21,060
because the arcade was actually in the fourth chapter of the game.

2119
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:22,420
You know, a likeness of it.

2120
01:45:22,420 --> 01:45:25,020
But the actual arcade and a lot of people know this arcade, too,

2121
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:26,740
because it's across the street

2122
01:45:26,740 --> 01:45:30,580
ish from the Washington Convention Center where Pax has been for forever.

2123
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:33,860
And that's how Loki Dark Soccer and I all went there once,

2124
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:38,420
because we all went to Pax together once in two thousand eight question mark.

2125
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:41,740
Because, yeah, I think it was the year I had the surgeries and all that stuff.

2126
01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:44,620
I was pretty sick, but was able to squeeze Pax in between that.

2127
01:45:44,620 --> 01:45:45,740
Yeah, it was a great trip.

2128
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:48,620
And I think a lot of people know that game works

2129
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:50,740
probably from going to Pax or something like that.

2130
01:45:50,980 --> 01:45:53,460
And certainly if you look at like the music game roots

2131
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:55,540
and all that stuff of the show,

2132
01:45:55,540 --> 01:45:58,420
you know, there was a big DDR scene there at one point.

2133
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:01,740
And maybe still to this day, as far as I know,

2134
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:05,860
I know they had like a pop music there when I visited my most recent trip,

2135
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:07,940
which was like maybe four or five years ago at this point.

2136
01:46:07,940 --> 01:46:10,140
But, you know, I know they still had some stuff.

2137
01:46:10,620 --> 01:46:12,900
It's very reminiscent of like

2138
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:17,500
a Dave and Busters or, you know, one of those large arcades.

2139
01:46:17,740 --> 01:46:21,180
And obviously pandemic has probably made it a little bit harder to operate.

2140
01:46:21,220 --> 01:46:23,380
That's certainly a part of it.

2141
01:46:23,380 --> 01:46:27,060
And just the general decline of arcades in general.

2142
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:29,580
Tigerclaw is pointing out to Seattle.

2143
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:31,700
Gameworks isn't the only one that's closing.

2144
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:33,460
So is the one in Las Vegas.

2145
01:46:33,460 --> 01:46:36,900
And I had heard that possibly it's an issue with the entire chain.

2146
01:46:37,740 --> 01:46:40,900
So there is there's that.

2147
01:46:40,900 --> 01:46:44,700
Yeah, Gameworks as a company is shuttering, according to this report.

2148
01:46:44,700 --> 01:46:48,500
And again, it's it's probably just a victim of the pandemic, which is sad.

2149
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:53,220
So, yep, several tweets

2150
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:56,420
out there about this, how the word got out of some of the employees were

2151
01:46:57,660 --> 01:47:00,220
kind of letting the news out and all that.

2152
01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:03,340
They're trying to this is interesting, is that one of the folks

2153
01:47:03,340 --> 01:47:07,220
that was talking about the news online, who was

2154
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:13,060
see the composer from Get in the Car Loser, Krista Lee,

2155
01:47:13,540 --> 01:47:16,740
is saying that she's assisting the Video Game History Foundation

2156
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:18,820
in preserving what we can of the place.

2157
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:21,860
Well, that's kind of interesting to kind of work with the History Foundation

2158
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:24,700
and maybe get some of those machines.

2159
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:27,380
They are saying, too, that the Seattle location could be managed

2160
01:47:27,380 --> 01:47:29,500
by the landlord if they were interested.

2161
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:33,860
But unknown if that I mean, that's a that's a real prime piece of real estate

2162
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:37,060
right there. That is the heart of downtown Seattle.

2163
01:47:38,180 --> 01:47:39,860
And I know what it's right across the street.

2164
01:47:39,860 --> 01:47:43,020
If I remember right, like the convention center, the Hyatt is right there

2165
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:44,900
with the big cheesecake factory.

2166
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:47,660
Everybody packs probably now once is right there.

2167
01:47:47,820 --> 01:47:50,100
It's it's right in the heart of downtown Seattle.

2168
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:53,180
And I just it's going to be probably hard to keep a valuable piece of real

2169
01:47:53,180 --> 01:47:55,980
estate like that, especially if it wasn't making the money

2170
01:47:55,980 --> 01:47:57,540
that it needed to to stay open.

2171
01:47:57,540 --> 01:47:59,820
So. Very, very sad.

2172
01:48:00,380 --> 01:48:02,820
So. All right.

2173
01:48:02,820 --> 01:48:06,140
Let's see. And She-Hulk 10 says Alamo is closing as well.

2174
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:09,300
A great movie theater that shows cool independent movies and festive nights.

2175
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:12,060
Really? I didn't hear that. That's sad.

2176
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:13,700
That's unfortunate.

2177
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:18,700
All right. So goodbye to Seattle Game Works.

2178
01:48:19,700 --> 01:48:21,420
And that large, large

2179
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:26,540
real estate they were working with, there's a lot of crane machines in there, too.

2180
01:48:26,540 --> 01:48:29,340
I remember that kind of look like around one, there were so many.

2181
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:33,260
All right. Let's get into our next segment

2182
01:48:33,260 --> 01:48:36,860
to remember Fonder times at Game Works or otherwise.

2183
01:48:36,860 --> 01:48:51,980
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive

2184
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:55,420
into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

2185
01:48:55,780 --> 01:48:58,500
It's time for the classic game of the week.

2186
01:48:59,260 --> 01:49:03,460
And what did you pick here on Episode 897 Dark Soccer for the classic game?

2187
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:06,460
I think Brave Fencer Musashi also.

2188
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:11,580
Musashi Den, which is the legend of Musashi.

2189
01:49:12,100 --> 01:49:16,300
It's an action roleplay game that came out by Square in 1998 for PlayStation.

2190
01:49:17,740 --> 01:49:20,900
I think the big thing with this is that

2191
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:25,340
I want to say that this was the

2192
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:31,420
the same demo for Final Fantasy 7, if I recall correctly.

2193
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:35,740
It was it was kind of a thing with that.

2194
01:49:35,740 --> 01:49:38,900
Yeah, this was like a on the same demo disc, if I'm right.

2195
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:42,380
Or that a demo for Final Fantasy 7 came with it one way or another.

2196
01:49:42,380 --> 01:49:44,460
They were related to each other. I'll have to look it back up again.

2197
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:46,300
Yeah, it was seven or eight. One of the two.

2198
01:49:46,300 --> 01:49:48,380
It was seven. No, it was seven. I know that.

2199
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:51,220
I just don't remember if seven was the demo or if this was the demo.

2200
01:49:52,540 --> 01:49:54,420
Oh, yeah. OK, I got you.

2201
01:49:56,220 --> 01:49:59,020
In any way, I want to say that seven was the demo with this one,

2202
01:49:59,860 --> 01:50:02,820
because there was some big thing about why everyone wanted it.

2203
01:50:03,660 --> 01:50:06,740
But you play as Musashi,

2204
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:11,500
who is a swordman who is summoned to a parallel world

2205
01:50:12,740 --> 01:50:17,020
to defend from the Thirst Quencher empire.

2206
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:20,340
And he's searching for different scrolls that enhance his sword

2207
01:50:20,340 --> 01:50:22,820
and interact with people in the world.

2208
01:50:24,420 --> 01:50:28,820
And it was a big departure from Square's roleplay games.

2209
01:50:29,380 --> 01:50:32,100
It was a very positively received game.

2210
01:50:33,820 --> 01:50:36,940
And he had like these sort of

2211
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:41,180
different chain attacks that he could do

2212
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:43,500
with his katana that was called Fusion.

2213
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:48,500
And it was it was a pretty, pretty neat little game.

2214
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:52,620
You know, you could go in and sleep or go to an inn to recover your energy.

2215
01:50:52,620 --> 01:50:55,140
Some very RPG like elements in it.

2216
01:50:56,140 --> 01:51:05,460
But he's a reincarnation of the legendary Brave Fencer Musashi.

2217
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:11,740
And he goes, his reincarnated self goes back to to save that world.

2218
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:18,660
It was developed in February 1997 by Sakaguchi Hironobu.

2219
01:51:19,740 --> 01:51:21,820
He's a producer, came up with the idea

2220
01:51:22,820 --> 01:51:25,660
by having the the real person,

2221
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:30,780
Miyamoto Musashi, to fight in an alternate world

2222
01:51:30,780 --> 01:51:32,380
that he's actually came from.

2223
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:33,980
So that's kind of where it came about.

2224
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:40,220
And then there's also another character in there named Kojiro,

2225
01:51:40,220 --> 01:51:44,500
who is based off of the swordsman Sasaki Kojiro.

2226
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:49,660
And for anyone who is a Pokemon fan, the original names of Jesse

2227
01:51:49,740 --> 01:51:52,340
and James are Musashi and Kojiro.

2228
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:56,300
So I just thought I would point that out.

2229
01:51:57,420 --> 01:52:02,340
Anyway, so the characters, you know, in the game have like that similar

2230
01:52:04,140 --> 01:52:06,340
rivalry in it.

2231
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:10,180
So anyway, they.

2232
01:52:12,580 --> 01:52:14,620
The game was, of course,

2233
01:52:14,620 --> 01:52:16,860
the name of the game was changed to Brave Fencer Musashi

2234
01:52:16,860 --> 01:52:21,260
instead of Brave Fencer Colu Musashiden, because people would

2235
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:25,380
they feared that that non-Japanese speakers would just say,

2236
01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:28,260
oh, his name is Musashiden. No, no, no, not really.

2237
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:33,180
It it has 78 tracks

2238
01:52:33,260 --> 01:52:37,060
on its soundtrack, a pretty, pretty impressive soundtrack.

2239
01:52:37,860 --> 01:52:42,700
It was released in Japan on July 16th, 1998,

2240
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:46,620
and re-released June 20th, 2000 with Square's Millennium Collection.

2241
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:49,900
It also came with merchandise that included postcards,

2242
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:52,540
a combination camera and cell phone strap,

2243
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:55,660
a handy strap and keychain fobs.

2244
01:52:56,380 --> 01:52:59,980
And then it came out on PlayStation Network on July 9th, 2008

2245
01:52:59,980 --> 01:53:01,620
in the North American market.

2246
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:04,580
It was released October 31st, 1998.

2247
01:53:06,420 --> 01:53:09,940
And yes, this had OK, so I was actually wrong on this.

2248
01:53:09,940 --> 01:53:11,740
This had the demo of Final Fantasy 8.

2249
01:53:11,740 --> 01:53:14,220
OK, I remembered the error is eight.

2250
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:17,100
I thought that it was Final Fantasy 7,

2251
01:53:17,100 --> 01:53:19,540
because I remember this game being older than it is.

2252
01:53:20,140 --> 01:53:22,980
Yeah, the 7 had already been out and it was

2253
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:25,860
I remember it because I did get that game.

2254
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:27,020
Well, I got that.

2255
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:30,140
One of the reasons I got that was because of the demo, for sure.

2256
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:33,380
Yeah, it did have a sequel,

2257
01:53:33,860 --> 01:53:36,100
which was Musashi Samurai Legend.

2258
01:53:36,100 --> 01:53:41,420
It came out for PS2, developed by Squenix and was released in 2005.

2259
01:53:42,020 --> 01:53:46,220
They also released a montage video that celebrated the game's 20th

2260
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:49,900
anniversary since release on July 16th, 2018.

2261
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:53,860
The game for Metacritic got an 81 out of 100.

2262
01:53:55,860 --> 01:53:59,020
And Famitsu gave it a 32 out of 40,

2263
01:53:59,020 --> 01:54:00,900
which is a really good rating for Famitsu.

2264
01:54:02,420 --> 01:54:07,260
It really got some some really good reviews overall,

2265
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:11,500
and the game still remains a favorite for for everybody,

2266
01:54:11,780 --> 01:54:12,940
for a lot of people that played it.

2267
01:54:12,940 --> 01:54:14,820
And if you haven't played it, why the fuck not?

2268
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:19,580
Because I didn't know anyone who had it, and I didn't own it myself.

2269
01:54:20,540 --> 01:54:23,220
I actually never played this.

2270
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:24,260
It's a good game.

2271
01:54:24,260 --> 01:54:26,140
Yeah, it looks cute. Definitely checking out.

2272
01:54:26,140 --> 01:54:30,500
Yeah, it's definitely a PS1 era game, you know, from the graphics and all.

2273
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:34,140
But I noticed YYR kind of I think it's YYR in chat was saying kind of like

2274
01:54:34,620 --> 01:54:38,500
it's it's a special something from Square's PS1 era

2275
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:40,660
where they kind of did a lot of different things.

2276
01:54:41,220 --> 01:54:42,740
And I can definitely see that in this.

2277
01:54:42,740 --> 01:54:45,780
I can tell you what game I think took some influence from this

2278
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:49,500
was at least in like kind of what we're seeing

2279
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:51,780
in this particular area in the game.

2280
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:54,940
Maybe Klonoa took some influence from it.

2281
01:54:54,940 --> 01:54:57,700
Oh, maybe I could see that.

2282
01:54:57,700 --> 01:54:59,660
Yeah. All right.

2283
01:54:59,700 --> 01:55:03,540
I mean, and honestly, for when this game came out, it did a lot.

2284
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:08,020
Yeah, it was pretty advanced for its time. Yeah.

2285
01:55:09,940 --> 01:55:11,180
But anyway, that's it.

2286
01:55:11,180 --> 01:55:13,260
All right. There it is, your classic game.

2287
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:15,500
I don't know if this came out before Klonoa.

2288
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:16,540
I have to check that.

2289
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:19,460
Hold on. That's going to bug me until I look at it, because

2290
01:55:21,060 --> 01:55:23,900
that's why I came out.

2291
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:26,740
Klonoa came out in.

2292
01:55:26,740 --> 01:55:29,980
OK, so actually, yeah, Klonoa came out first.

2293
01:55:30,020 --> 01:55:30,700
OK, so that's right.

2294
01:55:30,700 --> 01:55:32,980
So maybe this took influence from Klonoa then.

2295
01:55:32,980 --> 01:55:35,380
Possibly. Klonoa came out in 87.

2296
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:40,380
All right. There it is, your classic game of the week.

2297
01:55:40,380 --> 01:55:42,980
Brave Fencer Musashi.

2298
01:55:42,980 --> 01:55:45,140
Awesome. All right.

2299
01:55:45,140 --> 01:55:48,140
I thought we'd check in with release dates around the world.

2300
01:55:48,140 --> 01:55:50,140
I'm not sure if there is anything out this week,

2301
01:55:50,140 --> 01:55:52,660
but I thought I would have us all look at the calendar anyway.

2302
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:56,900
So, Loki, do we have anything in the U.S. releasing this week?

2303
01:55:57,620 --> 01:55:59,740
Nope. Nope.

2304
01:55:59,740 --> 01:56:01,620
Looking at Japan.

2305
01:56:02,020 --> 01:56:04,340
I see some peripherals for the Switch,

2306
01:56:04,340 --> 01:56:06,580
but I don't think I see any games this week.

2307
01:56:06,580 --> 01:56:09,020
So it is a quiet week.

2308
01:56:09,020 --> 01:56:10,940
What about the UK Dark Sakura?

2309
01:56:10,940 --> 01:56:13,060
No. Yeah, there it is.

2310
01:56:13,060 --> 01:56:14,940
The one week of the year.

2311
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:16,500
Nothing's coming out.

2312
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:18,260
Everybody's taking a siesta.

2313
01:56:18,260 --> 01:56:20,580
Next week, though, I'm sure that will change.

2314
01:56:20,580 --> 01:56:23,260
OK, here's an opportunity for the listener roundtable.

2315
01:56:23,260 --> 01:56:24,780
If you'd like to give us a call.

2316
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:28,020
Sure, we can take a call or two in our Discord, vognetwork.com

2317
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:29,540
slash Discord.

2318
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:31,700
If you'd like to join the green room is the place to be

2319
01:56:31,700 --> 01:56:33,820
if you want to get in on the conversation.

2320
01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:35,660
We also check our emails.

2321
01:56:35,660 --> 01:56:36,900
I feel like we have another.

2322
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:38,700
There's like three dry weeks in a row, I think.

2323
01:56:38,700 --> 01:56:41,540
But I didn't even bring up the mailbag.

2324
01:56:41,540 --> 01:56:42,700
Hold on.

2325
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:44,500
I'm not sure I saw anything.

2326
01:56:44,500 --> 01:56:46,940
But yeah, please double check because sometimes things

2327
01:56:46,940 --> 01:56:50,020
come in like at the top of the show that I don't see.

2328
01:56:50,020 --> 01:56:52,020
So I'm liking it.

2329
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:52,700
No worries.

2330
01:56:52,700 --> 01:56:56,020
Again, participate at OrangeLoundTrader.com

2331
01:56:56,020 --> 01:56:58,140
is the place to send an email.

2332
01:56:58,180 --> 01:57:02,620
If you would like to get in on the action.

2333
01:57:02,620 --> 01:57:03,500
All right.

2334
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:06,660
To quote the best line from Spaceballs,

2335
01:57:06,660 --> 01:57:09,260
we ain't found shit.

2336
01:57:09,260 --> 01:57:13,380
That was Tim Russ that said that from Star Trek Voyager.

2337
01:57:13,380 --> 01:57:15,180
When they were combing the desert.

2338
01:57:15,180 --> 01:57:17,660
That's right.

2339
01:57:17,660 --> 01:57:19,340
DJ Rama S says he's going to call in.

2340
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:21,740
So we'll just send that in our chat over at Twitch.tv

2341
01:57:21,740 --> 01:57:22,420
slash vognetwork.

2342
01:57:22,420 --> 01:57:23,260
So we'll give him a moment.

2343
01:57:23,260 --> 01:57:24,140
I will check in.

2344
01:57:24,140 --> 01:57:26,620
I know I'm going to say this as I'm half laughing.

2345
01:57:26,660 --> 01:57:29,060
Do we have any last minute stories tonight?

2346
01:57:29,060 --> 01:57:29,940
Nope.

2347
01:57:29,940 --> 01:57:31,780
I had a feeling.

2348
01:57:31,780 --> 01:57:35,380
We were kind of having to scrape what was available to us

2349
01:57:35,380 --> 01:57:37,380
tonight on a slow week.

2350
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:40,460
Well, I do hope everybody's having a great holiday season.

2351
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:42,860
I hope you all have some good New Year's plans.

2352
01:57:42,860 --> 01:57:47,860
I know with the big old Omicron out there and all that stuff,

2353
01:57:47,860 --> 01:57:51,740
some people are having to adjust appropriately and I get it.

2354
01:57:51,740 --> 01:57:53,260
It seems definitely frustrating.

2355
01:57:53,260 --> 01:57:54,500
It's like two years in a row.

2356
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:57,980
But yeah, just be safe y'all this holiday season.

2357
01:57:57,980 --> 01:58:01,260
I hope everybody has a good New Year's no matter

2358
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:02,820
how you spend it.

2359
01:58:02,820 --> 01:58:05,500
YYR was saying I was thinking of emailing because Nintendo

2360
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:07,060
Minute was mentioned last week.

2361
01:58:07,060 --> 01:58:09,500
I heard it ended because Nintendo was closing the site

2362
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:12,460
where those two folks worked and they were unwilling to relocate

2363
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:13,900
but I decided it wasn't worth it.

2364
01:58:13,900 --> 01:58:15,820
I thought they said in the press release

2365
01:58:15,820 --> 01:58:19,860
those guys were being relocated or was that or that they're

2366
01:58:19,860 --> 01:58:21,180
being reallocated.

2367
01:58:21,180 --> 01:58:22,780
Maybe not necessarily relocated.

2368
01:58:22,820 --> 01:58:25,500
Just taking on different roles in the company.

2369
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:30,260
Yeah, that might also be a same thing to say face.

2370
01:58:30,260 --> 01:58:32,860
Bonds006 says Epic Games Store has been giving away games

2371
01:58:32,860 --> 01:58:33,900
every 12 hours.

2372
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:35,380
We kind of addressed that at the top of the show.

2373
01:58:35,380 --> 01:58:37,500
I gave the PSA the control is free right now.

2374
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:43,500
It's every 24 hours unless something changed in the today

2375
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:45,660
or something but I think it's just every 24 hours.

2376
01:58:45,660 --> 01:58:47,780
Every eight might be a little too often.

2377
01:58:47,780 --> 01:58:51,220
We do have a call coming in so let's get to it and say hi.

2378
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:52,460
You are on Orange Launch Radio.

2379
01:58:52,460 --> 01:58:54,340
Who's this?

2380
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:55,740
It's the one and only Rama.

2381
01:58:55,740 --> 01:58:57,060
How is everybody today?

2382
01:58:57,060 --> 01:58:58,180
Doing well.

2383
01:58:58,180 --> 01:58:59,380
What a surprise.

2384
01:58:59,380 --> 01:59:00,860
It's not like you said in chat or anything

2385
01:59:00,860 --> 01:59:01,660
you were going to call in.

2386
01:59:01,660 --> 01:59:03,780
But no, it's always a pleasure to hear from Rama.

2387
01:59:03,780 --> 01:59:04,300
Hi.

2388
01:59:04,300 --> 01:59:05,580
Oh, your setup looks different.

2389
01:59:05,580 --> 01:59:08,580
Are you somewhere else for the holiday?

2390
01:59:08,580 --> 01:59:10,060
Actually, I am home.

2391
01:59:10,060 --> 01:59:13,180
I am not in front of my professional rig.

2392
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:18,500
I am at the other side of my quote unquote studio apartment

2393
01:59:19,340 --> 01:59:21,900
on my laptop with my external camera.

2394
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:23,420
OK, camera's facing a different way.

2395
01:59:23,420 --> 01:59:24,260
All good.

2396
01:59:24,260 --> 01:59:26,140
Well, what's on your mind today, buddy?

2397
01:59:26,140 --> 01:59:28,620
Well, I want to follow up with an article

2398
01:59:28,620 --> 01:59:31,820
that you talked about on the show a couple of weeks ago.

2399
01:59:31,820 --> 01:59:34,580
Which one?

2400
01:59:34,580 --> 01:59:36,260
Stadia.

2401
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:37,940
Oh, sure.

2402
01:59:37,940 --> 01:59:39,820
So what I'm going to do, I'm going

2403
01:59:39,820 --> 01:59:44,540
to turn my webcam to my LG TV.

2404
01:59:44,540 --> 01:59:45,220
OK.

2405
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:48,260
And I'm going to turn it on because after you

2406
01:59:48,260 --> 01:59:51,580
talked about it on the show, I'm like, I got to try this

2407
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:53,700
and see if this works for myself.

2408
01:59:53,700 --> 01:59:57,660
So I'm going to go ahead and turn everything on

2409
01:59:57,660 --> 02:00:00,100
and get it up and running here because I was playing around

2410
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:04,260
with it earlier to make sure I got it working because it

2411
02:00:04,260 --> 02:00:05,940
is finicky with controllers.

2412
02:00:05,940 --> 02:00:07,900
But I kind of got something going.

2413
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:11,820
So let's bring the television up.

2414
02:00:11,820 --> 02:00:12,780
Everything is set.

2415
02:00:15,540 --> 02:00:17,380
I just turn on the Xbox to make sure

2416
02:00:17,420 --> 02:00:19,220
that the TV and everything comes on.

2417
02:00:19,220 --> 02:00:21,700
But here we go.

2418
02:00:21,700 --> 02:00:23,300
I'm going to do this for the Twitch folks

2419
02:00:23,300 --> 02:00:25,700
to make it a little easier to see what you're doing there.

2420
02:00:25,700 --> 02:00:28,260
Oh, of course, it's going to screw up my thing.

2421
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:30,580
Sorry, you've seen a little of the magic there.

2422
02:00:30,580 --> 02:00:32,940
But I'm actually going to make Rama's screen a little bit

2423
02:00:32,940 --> 02:00:34,860
bigger there so you guys can actually

2424
02:00:34,860 --> 02:00:36,820
see what's going on there.

2425
02:00:36,820 --> 02:00:37,540
There we go.

2426
02:00:37,540 --> 02:00:38,020
Yeah.

2427
02:00:42,180 --> 02:00:42,700
There we go.

2428
02:00:42,700 --> 02:00:43,620
I'm going to log in.

2429
02:00:43,620 --> 02:00:45,940
So for the sake of the podcast, folks,

2430
02:00:45,940 --> 02:00:47,460
there's just a Stadia logo that we

2431
02:00:47,460 --> 02:00:49,060
see kind of glowing and loading.

2432
02:00:49,060 --> 02:00:54,660
So it just looks like the system is just going very slow there.

2433
02:00:54,660 --> 02:00:58,540
It's slow, but yet my TV is hardwired to the router

2434
02:00:58,540 --> 02:01:00,260
that's sitting behind the TV.

2435
02:01:00,260 --> 02:01:02,380
OK.

2436
02:01:02,380 --> 02:01:04,540
And as you can see, I kind of played around with it

2437
02:01:04,540 --> 02:01:05,940
earlier with Dirt 5.

2438
02:01:05,940 --> 02:01:10,940
So I signed up, did the one month free of pro.

2439
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:12,900
So I'm like, let me go through all of these games

2440
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:15,340
and just try them out.

2441
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:16,900
Yeah.

2442
02:01:16,900 --> 02:01:20,260
Hey, I found pro worth paying for.

2443
02:01:20,260 --> 02:01:23,700
Well, with all of the video games that I have bought,

2444
02:01:23,700 --> 02:01:25,940
I'm not keeping pro because I don't

2445
02:01:25,940 --> 02:01:28,700
know how often I'm going to jump on here and play it.

2446
02:01:28,700 --> 02:01:31,900
I just heard that Rob said it was free.

2447
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:35,020
I'm like, I got to try this out, load it onto my TV,

2448
02:01:35,020 --> 02:01:36,260
and just see.

2449
02:01:36,260 --> 02:01:40,180
How does it run once you play a game?

2450
02:01:40,180 --> 02:01:41,500
Here's the thing.

2451
02:01:41,540 --> 02:01:45,340
It's fast because I have gigabit internet

2452
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:47,900
and my TV is hardwired to the router that's

2453
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:49,420
literally behind the TV.

2454
02:01:49,420 --> 02:01:50,900
So let me.

2455
02:01:50,900 --> 02:01:54,660
It really is when you're hardwired.

2456
02:01:54,660 --> 02:01:56,620
And the thing is, I could have made it wireless,

2457
02:01:56,620 --> 02:01:57,220
but I'm like, you know what?

2458
02:01:57,220 --> 02:01:58,300
The router is right there.

2459
02:01:58,300 --> 02:01:59,860
So I have extra cabling.

2460
02:01:59,860 --> 02:02:00,780
So why not?

2461
02:02:00,780 --> 02:02:03,260
So I'm just going to fire up a game real quick.

2462
02:02:03,260 --> 02:02:03,740
OK.

2463
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:11,220
Zen Monkey in chat says, what is he doing?

2464
02:02:11,220 --> 02:02:11,740
I'm lost.

2465
02:02:11,740 --> 02:02:14,180
He's firing up Stadia on his LG TV

2466
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:16,980
as we had an article a couple of weeks ago that Stadia is now

2467
02:02:16,980 --> 02:02:19,060
available for LG TVs.

2468
02:02:19,060 --> 02:02:21,220
So Rama's kind of walking us through a little bit

2469
02:02:21,220 --> 02:02:22,580
kind of what it looks like there.

2470
02:02:22,580 --> 02:02:24,700
This is, again, integrated into the TV.

2471
02:02:24,700 --> 02:02:27,740
He's not using some sort of console or anything like that.

2472
02:02:27,740 --> 02:02:30,460
And that's why the focus is getting a little screwy

2473
02:02:30,460 --> 02:02:32,780
is because he's using, he's pointed his laptop

2474
02:02:32,780 --> 02:02:34,500
webcam at the screen.

2475
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:36,940
But again, our podcast listeners can't even see anything.

2476
02:02:36,940 --> 02:02:39,060
But we'll just mention, it looks like he fired up Killer Queen

2477
02:02:39,060 --> 02:02:42,060
Black, and it's just going through all the logos

2478
02:02:42,060 --> 02:02:44,100
that you would see at the start of a game.

2479
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:46,140
It looks like it's still a little fuzzy, Rama.

2480
02:02:46,140 --> 02:02:47,140
I don't know if you just want to wave

2481
02:02:47,140 --> 02:02:50,020
your hand in front of the camera to get it to autofocus again.

2482
02:02:50,020 --> 02:02:52,620
Yeah, it's my, see, this is why I don't

2483
02:02:52,620 --> 02:02:54,140
trust Logitech equipment.

2484
02:02:54,140 --> 02:02:56,180
Yeah, it's a lighting thing at this point.

2485
02:02:56,180 --> 02:02:57,740
All right, all right, that's all right.

2486
02:02:57,740 --> 02:02:59,140
But we get the idea.

2487
02:02:59,140 --> 02:03:01,300
I was just kind of curious like how smooth it

2488
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:03,460
is, you know, in that whole thing.

2489
02:03:03,460 --> 02:03:07,660
I would say it is because I didn't feel any slowdowns when

2490
02:03:07,660 --> 02:03:09,220
I was playing Dirt 5.

2491
02:03:09,220 --> 02:03:14,380
So like I said, I just fired up Killer Queen Black.

2492
02:03:14,380 --> 02:03:15,620
It's just me.

2493
02:03:15,620 --> 02:03:18,780
I have no clue what I am doing.

2494
02:03:18,780 --> 02:03:23,980
So I'm just sitting here just playing through this.

2495
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:26,580
Now, you mentioned that the controller was kind of a pain

2496
02:03:26,580 --> 02:03:27,240
to get set up.

2497
02:03:27,240 --> 02:03:30,380
Can you mention like what the pain points were with that?

2498
02:03:30,380 --> 02:03:36,020
Well, as you know, basically any controller works on any PC.

2499
02:03:36,020 --> 02:03:38,900
You would think that any controller

2500
02:03:38,900 --> 02:03:44,620
would work great on Stadia through an appliance.

2501
02:03:44,620 --> 02:03:49,040
You have to understand that LG uses what's called WebOS,

2502
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:52,340
and that's not really Android per se.

2503
02:03:52,340 --> 02:03:54,980
It's its own little operating system.

2504
02:03:54,980 --> 02:03:58,180
So what I did was I fired it up.

2505
02:03:58,180 --> 02:04:03,480
I plugged in a wired switch controller.

2506
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:05,120
I got nothing.

2507
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:08,720
So I had a special adapter that converts any controller

2508
02:04:08,720 --> 02:04:11,400
to Xbox, and I tried that.

2509
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:12,240
Nothing.

2510
02:04:12,240 --> 02:04:15,880
Tried a different USB port, nada, nothing.

2511
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:17,480
That didn't work either.

2512
02:04:17,480 --> 02:04:21,640
So I decided to break out my PlayStation 4 controller,

2513
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:23,920
plug it into the adapter, nothing.

2514
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:25,380
And I'm looking at the instructions.

2515
02:04:25,380 --> 02:04:30,560
I'm like, wait, it's supposed to work with Xbox 360, Xbox One,

2516
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:33,200
PS4, and certain Logitech controllers.

2517
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:36,560
So I took out the adapter, plugged in the PlayStation 4

2518
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:41,080
controller directly, and it's working.

2519
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:44,760
Well, glad you got it somehow.

2520
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:48,800
Like I said, the load time on this was pretty quick.

2521
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:51,200
But it's just kind of getting to the Stadia

2522
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:54,000
menu that took a hot minute.

2523
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Kind of, sort of.

2524
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:00,840
Like if I turn on the TV, I hit the Home button on the remote,

2525
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:02,780
there's an icon for Stadia right there.

2526
02:05:02,780 --> 02:05:05,180
It takes like maybe less than two minutes for it

2527
02:05:05,180 --> 02:05:08,300
to load up and get things up and running.

2528
02:05:08,300 --> 02:05:09,840
And when you're playing on a computer,

2529
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:11,580
it's going to be a little bit different since it's

2530
02:05:11,580 --> 02:05:12,940
opening right up in Chrome.

2531
02:05:12,940 --> 02:05:14,020
Sure.

2532
02:05:14,020 --> 02:05:18,400
Like right now, when I open my Chrome,

2533
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:22,780
it opens right to Dead by Daylight and launches the game.

2534
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:26,460
Because I have, that was, I never quit out of the game

2535
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:29,460
unless I'm going to play something else.

2536
02:05:29,460 --> 02:05:32,140
So I haven't seen it work on the TV

2537
02:05:32,180 --> 02:05:36,460
before because I've never played it on anything but on my Mac.

2538
02:05:36,460 --> 02:05:38,820
Which of course, it recognizes whatever I have plugged

2539
02:05:38,820 --> 02:05:39,820
into my Mac at the time.

2540
02:05:39,820 --> 02:05:42,180
I haven't tried my controller.

2541
02:05:42,180 --> 02:05:47,460
I just found my wired controller.

2542
02:05:47,460 --> 02:05:49,980
Hey, see, the thing is, I think it'll

2543
02:05:49,980 --> 02:05:52,580
work for Mac because of direct input support.

2544
02:05:52,580 --> 02:05:56,740
So as long as Stadia likes that, it's fine.

2545
02:05:56,740 --> 02:06:00,100
I think because this is web OS and the way it's coded,

2546
02:06:00,140 --> 02:06:02,760
it's going to work on certain controllers.

2547
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:05,860
Because when I plugged in my controller or the adapter,

2548
02:06:05,860 --> 02:06:08,800
it did say, you know, kid device detected.

2549
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:10,780
I'm like, okay, let's give it a shot.

2550
02:06:10,780 --> 02:06:11,720
So, you know.

2551
02:06:14,380 --> 02:06:17,460
So Rama, thank you for the walkthrough of Stadia on the TV.

2552
02:06:17,460 --> 02:06:20,300
It's kind of nice to just be able to see that in motion.

2553
02:06:20,300 --> 02:06:22,220
I do have another call waiting to get in.

2554
02:06:22,220 --> 02:06:23,740
So I want to get that, but first,

2555
02:06:23,740 --> 02:06:26,500
any other final thoughts for us before we get to that?

2556
02:06:27,220 --> 02:06:32,260
Um, my Chinese food was bland for Christmas,

2557
02:06:32,260 --> 02:06:33,820
so I'm not too thrilled about that.

2558
02:06:33,820 --> 02:06:35,140
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

2559
02:06:35,140 --> 02:06:35,940
Sorry to hear that.

2560
02:06:35,940 --> 02:06:39,300
You have to have Dark Sakura send you some tarts.

2561
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:40,620
They were divine.

2562
02:06:40,620 --> 02:06:41,980
I have one left.

2563
02:06:41,980 --> 02:06:43,740
They're mine.

2564
02:06:43,740 --> 02:06:47,220
Well, I'm not going to fight for a tart, OK?

2565
02:06:47,220 --> 02:06:48,260
No, no.

2566
02:06:48,260 --> 02:06:49,300
I'll pass you my tart.

2567
02:06:49,300 --> 02:06:50,580
My tart recipe is easy.

2568
02:06:50,580 --> 02:06:53,540
You buy puff pastry from the grocery store,

2569
02:06:53,540 --> 02:06:55,940
and you buy marmalade from the grocery store,

2570
02:06:55,940 --> 02:06:57,460
and you bake them.

2571
02:06:57,460 --> 02:06:58,060
It was good.

2572
02:06:58,060 --> 02:06:59,620
Sounds good.

2573
02:06:59,620 --> 02:07:01,260
That'll give us something Marco's trying to do

2574
02:07:01,260 --> 02:07:03,180
while we help her move next Sunday.

2575
02:07:03,180 --> 02:07:03,940
Oh, boy.

2576
02:07:03,940 --> 02:07:06,460
Remember, friends help friends move.

2577
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:08,540
Real friends help friends move bodies.

2578
02:07:08,540 --> 02:07:11,620
What makes you think I haven't moved a body already?

2579
02:07:11,620 --> 02:07:14,860
All right, before we get terms of service violated,

2580
02:07:14,860 --> 02:07:15,940
it's hyperbole.

2581
02:07:15,940 --> 02:07:17,860
They are speaking in hyperbole.

2582
02:07:17,860 --> 02:07:19,900
All right, that's going to do it, Rama.

2583
02:07:19,900 --> 02:07:21,140
Thank you so much for the call.

2584
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:22,580
I appreciate it.

2585
02:07:22,580 --> 02:07:23,020
Thank you.

2586
02:07:23,020 --> 02:07:24,660
Take care, y'all, and Happy New Year.

2587
02:07:24,660 --> 02:07:25,380
Same to you.

2588
02:07:25,420 --> 02:07:26,180
Happy New Year.

2589
02:07:26,180 --> 02:07:27,220
Bye bye.

2590
02:07:27,220 --> 02:07:28,220
All right.

2591
02:07:28,220 --> 02:07:30,940
We have another call waiting, so let's just bring them on in.

2592
02:07:30,940 --> 02:07:32,340
Sorry the video is a little funky,

2593
02:07:32,340 --> 02:07:34,340
but we'll fix it right now as we welcome another person.

2594
02:07:34,340 --> 02:07:34,940
Hi.

2595
02:07:34,940 --> 02:07:36,180
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2596
02:07:36,180 --> 02:07:36,780
Who's this?

2597
02:07:40,540 --> 02:07:41,060
Hi.

2598
02:07:41,060 --> 02:07:44,580
You might be muted or we don't hear you.

2599
02:07:44,580 --> 02:07:46,020
Wait, I thought I brought someone.

2600
02:07:46,020 --> 02:07:46,860
They left right away.

2601
02:07:46,860 --> 02:07:47,300
That's what happened.

2602
02:07:47,300 --> 02:07:48,180
Let's try this again.

2603
02:07:48,180 --> 02:07:49,660
It's like, why did the picture change?

2604
02:07:49,660 --> 02:07:50,020
Hi.

2605
02:07:50,020 --> 02:07:51,180
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2606
02:07:51,180 --> 02:07:51,900
Who's this?

2607
02:07:51,900 --> 02:07:53,140
Hey, it's Shane.

2608
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:53,660
Hey, Shane.

2609
02:07:53,660 --> 02:07:54,860
What's up?

2610
02:07:54,860 --> 02:07:59,300
I'm calling to complain because I don't have anything to complain to.

2611
02:07:59,300 --> 02:07:59,900
No, no.

2612
02:07:59,900 --> 02:08:02,340
It's actually, I think it's kind of an interesting thing.

2613
02:08:02,340 --> 02:08:03,340
OK.

2614
02:08:03,340 --> 02:08:04,300
Oh, it's not about me.

2615
02:08:04,300 --> 02:08:06,500
Oh, finally, what a change.

2616
02:08:06,500 --> 02:08:08,780
We'll wait for the show on Wednesday for that.

2617
02:08:11,100 --> 02:08:16,580
No, so this is about our favorite company, Konami, actually.

2618
02:08:16,580 --> 02:08:17,980
Oh, no.

2619
02:08:17,980 --> 02:08:21,180
What is there to complain about there?

2620
02:08:21,180 --> 02:08:23,220
It's worse than I was expecting.

2621
02:08:23,220 --> 02:08:24,060
Let's just say that.

2622
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:28,220
So my local arcade got a 2DX machine.

2623
02:08:28,220 --> 02:08:29,980
I'm super excited about that.

2624
02:08:29,980 --> 02:08:31,060
Started playing it.

2625
02:08:31,060 --> 02:08:34,780
Kind of rekindled my love for 2DX.

2626
02:08:34,780 --> 02:08:42,700
Saw my cousin playing 2DX Infinitus, which is the computer version.

2627
02:08:42,700 --> 02:08:44,060
I'm not sure if you've heard of that.

2628
02:08:44,060 --> 02:08:44,300
OK.

2629
02:08:44,300 --> 02:08:44,580
I have.

2630
02:08:44,580 --> 02:08:45,220
The PC one.

2631
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:46,540
Yeah, we've gotten emails on it before.

2632
02:08:46,540 --> 02:08:49,940
I haven't played it myself, but I'm familiar that Konami's tried to launch.

2633
02:08:49,940 --> 02:08:51,380
They just recently did DER.

2634
02:08:51,380 --> 02:08:52,980
We've heard a lot about.

2635
02:08:53,020 --> 02:08:55,540
They have an online DDR one, yeah.

2636
02:08:55,540 --> 02:08:58,340
Yeah, they also have sound Voltex.

2637
02:08:58,340 --> 02:09:02,020
But we'll stick to 2DX for a moment here.

2638
02:09:02,020 --> 02:09:04,020
So I'm just getting really interested.

2639
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:11,180
So one of the things we did for Christmas is we ordered me a fancy 2DX controller.

2640
02:09:11,180 --> 02:09:14,980
Not very cheap to begin with, but it was cool.

2641
02:09:14,980 --> 02:09:16,220
I'll have a controller.

2642
02:09:16,220 --> 02:09:19,220
I can play 2DX on my computer.

2643
02:09:19,260 --> 02:09:26,540
Infinitus is about $15 a month, which is just another subscription service, whatever.

2644
02:09:26,540 --> 02:09:33,700
But the problem is I didn't know that they sell ridiculously overpriced song packs.

2645
02:09:33,700 --> 02:09:35,860
And there's about 20 of them.

2646
02:09:35,860 --> 02:09:39,020
And that's where the bulk of the music content comes from.

2647
02:09:39,020 --> 02:09:44,860
And each song pack, 25 songs roughly, $60 each.

2648
02:09:44,860 --> 02:09:45,860
Wow.

2649
02:09:45,860 --> 02:09:46,380
Wowie.

2650
02:09:46,380 --> 02:09:47,780
Yeah.

2651
02:09:47,780 --> 02:09:52,460
Yeah, so I just wanted to call and complain about that and just say how ridiculous it

2652
02:09:52,460 --> 02:09:59,660
is to charge $15 a month on top of wanting $60 for each of these song packs, which I'm

2653
02:09:59,660 --> 02:10:03,260
sure they're not anywhere near finished doing.

2654
02:10:03,260 --> 02:10:09,060
They're only up to, I think, maybe heroic verse songs in Infinitus.

2655
02:10:09,060 --> 02:10:11,180
So we're already past that mix.

2656
02:10:11,180 --> 02:10:12,180
So yeah.

2657
02:10:12,180 --> 02:10:13,180
Interesting.

2658
02:10:13,180 --> 02:10:14,180
Yeah.

2659
02:10:14,180 --> 02:10:15,180
And I've heard this before.

2660
02:10:15,220 --> 02:10:19,140
Isn't there a way as well, because I thought this was a thing that I remember going, the

2661
02:10:19,140 --> 02:10:20,140
fuck?

2662
02:10:20,140 --> 02:10:25,620
Like a way that you can play any song, basically like for a dollar, you get a four song game

2663
02:10:25,620 --> 02:10:29,660
just like you were playing an actual arcade machine, but that's on top of your $15 a month.

2664
02:10:29,660 --> 02:10:30,660
Is it?

2665
02:10:30,660 --> 02:10:31,660
That I haven't.

2666
02:10:31,660 --> 02:10:32,660
Or is that?

2667
02:10:32,660 --> 02:10:33,660
That I haven't seen.

2668
02:10:33,660 --> 02:10:34,660
Maybe that's in the DDR game.

2669
02:10:34,660 --> 02:10:35,980
It might be in the DDR game.

2670
02:10:35,980 --> 02:10:41,420
But what I do know about Infinitus besides these song packs is they do have unlockables,

2671
02:10:41,420 --> 02:10:46,180
but apparently they're incredibly grindy to get just like even basic difficulties for

2672
02:10:46,180 --> 02:10:48,420
each of these older songs.

2673
02:10:48,420 --> 02:10:56,300
And they sell boosters to boost how many unlockable points you get for like 12 hours.

2674
02:10:56,300 --> 02:11:02,240
And Orange Right and YYR are both confirming DDR Grand Prix does do that, but not 2DX.

2675
02:11:02,240 --> 02:11:04,620
So that's why my brain was getting crossed.

2676
02:11:04,620 --> 02:11:05,620
Yeah.

2677
02:11:05,620 --> 02:11:06,620
Okay.

2678
02:11:06,980 --> 02:11:11,700
But I think it's just it's such a bummer because this is an amazing way to be able to play

2679
02:11:11,700 --> 02:11:16,620
like some cool stuff at home, but they have to go and Konami it.

2680
02:11:16,620 --> 02:11:18,780
And it's just such a bummer.

2681
02:11:18,780 --> 02:11:21,040
They have to go and Konami it.

2682
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:23,500
That is quite the phrase.

2683
02:11:23,500 --> 02:11:27,700
Do you think that maybe that's why they haven't really pushed this in the US?

2684
02:11:27,700 --> 02:11:32,820
You know, it's this is not something that we really see marketed in the US like at all.

2685
02:11:32,820 --> 02:11:37,560
This is really something that's do you think maybe the Japan culture is just more willing

2686
02:11:37,560 --> 02:11:41,900
to pony up the money for this or just, you know, maybe the way the games are piecemealed

2687
02:11:41,900 --> 02:11:44,740
over there with online services, they're willing to do it.

2688
02:11:44,740 --> 02:11:49,120
Whereas, you know, they know that if this was a bigger deal in the US, this stuff would

2689
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:51,620
probably get called out.

2690
02:11:51,620 --> 02:11:52,620
Maybe so.

2691
02:11:52,620 --> 02:11:58,300
And I think it's also weird that I believe out of the three online PC titles, the DDR

2692
02:11:58,300 --> 02:12:03,340
Sound Vultex and 2DX, it's the only one that does not actually grant you any benefits in

2693
02:12:03,340 --> 02:12:07,340
the arcade if you link your or you have to link an EME's account.

2694
02:12:07,340 --> 02:12:10,980
But I think Sound Vultex and DDR actually give you some sort of benefit, whereas this

2695
02:12:10,980 --> 02:12:16,500
is like, give us a lot of money and a lot of your time to grind stuff.

2696
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:17,500
But that's it.

2697
02:12:17,500 --> 02:12:18,500
We just want that.

2698
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:19,900
Don't worry about the arcade.

2699
02:12:19,900 --> 02:12:24,300
I think there's just so many of us out there that just wish Konami would be bought by somebody

2700
02:12:24,300 --> 02:12:27,240
who could better handle all the intellectual properties.

2701
02:12:27,240 --> 02:12:30,800
But then at the same token, it's like Konami's not going to be for sale as long as they're

2702
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:34,280
making oodles and oodles off slot machines and pachinko and all that stuff, which still

2703
02:12:34,280 --> 02:12:36,280
is doing very well.

2704
02:12:36,280 --> 02:12:38,280
And now they're online services.

2705
02:12:38,280 --> 02:12:45,320
Let's see, and YYR points out DDR gives you nothing in the arcade at present.

2706
02:12:45,320 --> 02:12:47,880
So it's not just something unique to 3DX.

2707
02:12:47,880 --> 02:12:48,880
Sound Vultex.

2708
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:49,880
Okay.

2709
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:50,880
Yeah.

2710
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:54,400
But I'm still going to go all in or not all in on this, but I mean, I got my controller

2711
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:55,400
coming at some point.

2712
02:12:55,560 --> 02:13:01,480
So you're like, all right, maybe I'll do 60 bucks this month, 60 bucks in a couple months

2713
02:13:01,480 --> 02:13:05,120
and build my collection slowly.

2714
02:13:05,120 --> 02:13:10,720
I'll just grind out the unlocked points and get Lionski and then just play that.

2715
02:13:10,720 --> 02:13:12,800
And that's all I need, I guess.

2716
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:17,760
Just play, play the, because that's the sign of a true Bomani addict is that there's the

2717
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:24,000
one song that you had to import a Japanese PlayStation 2 and copy of BeatMania 2DX and

2718
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:25,000
2DX controller.

2719
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:26,320
So you could play the one song.

2720
02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:27,320
Yeah.

2721
02:13:27,320 --> 02:13:28,320
Yeah.

2722
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:32,120
Last time I was at the arcade, I played, I only get two songs per game and they were

2723
02:13:32,120 --> 02:13:33,120
both Lionski.

2724
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:37,840
I was like, I got to let the entire arcade know how good Carlos is.

2725
02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:38,840
So.

2726
02:13:38,840 --> 02:13:42,320
Well, it is arguably one of the best songs in the, in the entire series.

2727
02:13:42,320 --> 02:13:43,560
Oh, definitely.

2728
02:13:43,560 --> 02:13:50,200
And I guess Infinitus has, it's not a Kiriyamaoka, but they do have a sequel to Lionski with

2729
02:13:50,200 --> 02:13:52,160
a puppet and everything.

2730
02:13:52,160 --> 02:13:55,520
It's right next to the original of the Safari.

2731
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:57,960
Oh, the Safari is so good.

2732
02:13:57,960 --> 02:14:00,720
The original of the Safari, not the sped up one.

2733
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:01,720
Yeah.

2734
02:14:01,720 --> 02:14:02,840
No, no, I don't count that one.

2735
02:14:02,840 --> 02:14:05,160
I don't even, I didn't even remember it until you said that.

2736
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:11,920
So I'm sorry for bringing that little unfortunate piece back to light.

2737
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:12,920
That's okay.

2738
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:14,080
I'll forget about it when I take my Ambien.

2739
02:14:14,080 --> 02:14:16,200
So it's all good.

2740
02:14:16,200 --> 02:14:21,620
Well, Shane consider your complaint officially lodged, but as it is a complaint about Konami,

2741
02:14:21,620 --> 02:14:24,220
it has been classified as redundant.

2742
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:25,220
So there you go.

2743
02:14:25,220 --> 02:14:26,220
Yeah.

2744
02:14:26,220 --> 02:14:27,220
Yeah.

2745
02:14:27,220 --> 02:14:31,780
I'm like, I'm not going to get any like email back saying like, thanks for your comment.

2746
02:14:31,780 --> 02:14:33,580
Here's a $2 coupon or something.

2747
02:14:33,580 --> 02:14:34,900
Shane, you used to work there.

2748
02:14:34,900 --> 02:14:39,140
You know how they work and it's worse than when you work there.

2749
02:14:39,140 --> 02:14:40,140
I know.

2750
02:14:40,140 --> 02:14:44,080
How is it worse than getting drunk at lunch and coming back to work?

2751
02:14:44,080 --> 02:14:45,080
I don't understand.

2752
02:14:45,080 --> 02:14:47,980
I don't know how many of those stories you should be telling on this program.

2753
02:14:47,980 --> 02:14:48,980
Whatever.

2754
02:14:48,980 --> 02:14:50,980
It only happened like twice.

2755
02:14:51,340 --> 02:14:52,840
All right.

2756
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:55,780
On that note, we're going to let you go.

2757
02:14:55,780 --> 02:14:56,780
Thanks for the call, Shane.

2758
02:14:56,780 --> 02:14:57,780
I appreciate you.

2759
02:14:57,780 --> 02:14:58,780
No problem.

2760
02:14:58,780 --> 02:14:59,780
Bye.

2761
02:14:59,780 --> 02:15:00,780
Bye.

2762
02:15:00,780 --> 02:15:01,780
Even when you call to complain.

2763
02:15:01,780 --> 02:15:02,780
All right.

2764
02:15:02,780 --> 02:15:04,980
At least this one wasn't about me.

2765
02:15:04,980 --> 02:15:11,780
I think with that, we are going to probably start to wrap up the show here for the night.

2766
02:15:11,780 --> 02:15:15,540
Thank you guys so much for checking out our show tonight.

2767
02:15:15,540 --> 02:15:16,540
Thank you for being here.

2768
02:15:16,540 --> 02:15:19,780
Again, I encourage emails and things of that sort.

2769
02:15:20,780 --> 02:15:22,780
You can tweet us as well.

2770
02:15:22,780 --> 02:15:26,780
I do respond to tweets, even though I don't always remember to read them here on the show.

2771
02:15:29,780 --> 02:15:31,380
Thanks again for downloading our show.

2772
02:15:31,380 --> 02:15:34,180
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange, or watching us live.

2773
02:15:34,180 --> 02:15:37,580
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, help us spread the word.

2774
02:15:37,580 --> 02:15:40,880
Tell a friend because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more

2775
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:45,180
voices here with us on Sunday nights and throughout the week on Twitter and email and all the

2776
02:15:45,180 --> 02:15:49,020
other ways the podcasters, folks interact with us.

2777
02:15:49,020 --> 02:15:52,660
We need more folks to really get more voices here at the table and tell us about some of

2778
02:15:52,660 --> 02:15:58,780
these cool things we might not otherwise cross our desks because we're too busy playing other

2779
02:15:58,780 --> 02:15:59,780
games.

2780
02:15:59,780 --> 02:16:04,740
Also, as I mentioned at the top of the show, Spotify just unleashed reviews, so a nice

2781
02:16:04,740 --> 02:16:09,140
five-star review on Spotify goes a long way, so please consider that.

2782
02:16:09,140 --> 02:16:10,140
You don't use Spotify?

2783
02:16:10,140 --> 02:16:15,180
Well, a nice review or a social media share of whatever you are using does go an awful

2784
02:16:15,180 --> 02:16:18,820
long way, so please consider that as well.

2785
02:16:18,820 --> 02:16:19,820
Thanks again.

2786
02:16:19,820 --> 02:16:26,100
The Discord, if you want to join us for conversation throughout the week, vognetwork.com slash

2787
02:16:26,100 --> 02:16:29,740
Discord, if you want to join the Discord server.

2788
02:16:29,740 --> 02:16:31,100
So there you go.

2789
02:16:31,100 --> 02:16:34,740
I think the time has come to go around and give everybody's final thoughts and wrap it

2790
02:16:34,740 --> 02:16:35,780
up.

2791
02:16:35,780 --> 02:16:42,400
I hope everybody has a great holiday and we'll see you again in 2022.

2792
02:16:42,400 --> 02:16:44,740
It's going to be our 20th year of broadcasting.

2793
02:16:44,740 --> 02:16:49,460
This show started in June of, I almost said 1992, but that would actually be 30 years

2794
02:16:49,460 --> 02:16:54,220
if that was the case, and I think we would have all been in like high school-ish.

2795
02:16:54,220 --> 02:16:57,260
So we will see you.

2796
02:16:57,260 --> 02:16:59,180
We started in 2002.

2797
02:16:59,180 --> 02:17:03,260
We'll see you for our 20th broadcast year 2022 next week.

2798
02:17:03,260 --> 02:17:05,700
Until then, let's get some final thoughts.

2799
02:17:05,700 --> 02:17:07,500
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

2800
02:17:07,500 --> 02:17:11,540
Once again, you're muted.

2801
02:17:11,540 --> 02:17:17,540
Uh, I don't have any.

2802
02:17:17,540 --> 02:17:18,540
I want my soup.

2803
02:17:18,540 --> 02:17:22,540
I want to kill people and burn off my upsetness.

2804
02:17:22,540 --> 02:17:28,660
All right, well, I'm going to just smack survivors around and feel better about the universe

2805
02:17:28,660 --> 02:17:30,500
and my place in it.

2806
02:17:30,500 --> 02:17:34,340
I'm going to run no ed on every build and see how much salt I get.

2807
02:17:34,340 --> 02:17:39,120
All right, Dark Soccer will be doing that live for those folks on Twitch in just a moment

2808
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:40,420
once we wrap it all up here.

2809
02:17:40,420 --> 02:17:43,020
So have a good killing spree, Dark Soccer.

2810
02:17:43,020 --> 02:17:44,020
Later tater.

2811
02:17:44,020 --> 02:17:45,020
All right.

2812
02:17:45,020 --> 02:17:46,180
Loki, we'll go to you.

2813
02:17:46,180 --> 02:17:47,180
Your final thought tonight?

2814
02:17:47,180 --> 02:17:51,100
My final thought is I got to put together my episode for this week.

2815
02:17:51,100 --> 02:17:56,400
I've been doing too much, but I think I've done enough now where I can kind of coast

2816
02:17:56,400 --> 02:17:58,620
on the next couple episodes after this.

2817
02:17:58,620 --> 02:18:01,860
All right, well, best of luck with all of that.

2818
02:18:01,860 --> 02:18:03,080
Yep.

2819
02:18:03,080 --> 02:18:07,860
My final thought is I hope to see you guys on Wednesday for the Final Fantasy XIV spoiler

2820
02:18:07,860 --> 02:18:08,860
stream.

2821
02:18:08,860 --> 02:18:11,420
But I understand you might not want to have everything spoiled yet.

2822
02:18:11,420 --> 02:18:15,300
So if you decide to wait and watch it later, hey, that is fine too.

2823
02:18:15,300 --> 02:18:19,500
We will have it in the VOG network archives for our subscribers to be able to access whenever

2824
02:18:19,500 --> 02:18:20,740
they want.

2825
02:18:20,740 --> 02:18:23,300
Otherwise, that's it.

2826
02:18:23,300 --> 02:18:26,300
I hope, again, you all have a safe New Year celebration, whatever you do.

2827
02:18:26,300 --> 02:18:29,940
And if you're doing something small at home, or if you're doing like a party with friends

2828
02:18:29,940 --> 02:18:33,700
that are all like boosted and masked up and all that stuff, then I hope everything goes

2829
02:18:33,700 --> 02:18:35,680
very well for you guys.

2830
02:18:35,680 --> 02:18:36,680
That's really it.

2831
02:18:36,680 --> 02:18:37,680
Happy gaming, everybody.

2832
02:18:37,680 --> 02:18:39,520
We'll be back next week.

2833
02:18:39,520 --> 02:18:41,440
We'll probably do some talk about games of the year.

2834
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:44,240
I don't know if I have three games of the year for the list.

2835
02:18:44,240 --> 02:18:45,240
We'll see.

2836
02:18:45,240 --> 02:18:48,680
We'll talk about that next week and how we want to do all that and maybe some predictions

2837
02:18:48,680 --> 02:18:51,200
for 2022 because I think we skipped them this year.

2838
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:55,660
We'll blame the pandemic for that and my aloofness, but we'll do some predictions for 2022.

2839
02:18:55,660 --> 02:18:56,660
So stay tuned next week.

2840
02:18:56,660 --> 02:18:57,660
We'll see you guys then.

2841
02:18:57,660 --> 02:18:58,660
Good night.
