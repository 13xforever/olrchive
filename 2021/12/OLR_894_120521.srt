1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,560
It's another week and another Groundswell launch with rampant service issues.

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,840
But in actual news, tonight's topics are an interesting mix of massive universe mashups,

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,960
ongoing social sagas, new release drive, remasters and re-releases, and a couple of glitches.

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,040
It's a cornucopia of potpourri, a cavalcade of conundrums, and video games, the things

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,880
we hold near and dear to our hearts.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,240
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring you details

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,240
of all this and more, starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:47,000
Welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,600
We are live once again with our first show for the month of December, if you can believe

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,600
it.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,960
It's December the 5th of 2021.

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined by my friends as I have been for the last, oh gosh,

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,320
almost 20 years now.

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,480
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,480
Hello.

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,920
Hi Jamie, how are you?

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,920
I'm doing.

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,920
Yeah?

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,920
You're doing?

20
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,400
Still withdrawal is a bitch.

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,400
Yeah.

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,400
I hear you.

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
I hear you.

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,840
I have a friend visiting in the background on camera.

25
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
Do you?

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,480
I did some changes to the studio computer.

27
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,080
My preview is very small, so it's hard for me to see you guys totally, but I see a little

28
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,200
lump on the chair.

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
Yeah.

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,920
Blending in with the black cushions.

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,920
I gotcha.

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
Well, hello, Minda.

33
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,920
Good to see Minda.

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,480
You can see her eyes.

35
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,560
We love a cat cameo.

36
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,520
We always do.

37
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,560
Say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,560
Hello.

39
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,560
Hi, Loki.

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,560
How are you?

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
I'm doing good.

42
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,680
Live on Twitch, because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific,

43
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,080
9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at The Voice of Geeks Network, live

44
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,480
on Twitch, twitch.tv slash vog network.

45
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,600
That's VOG network.

46
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,920
And as we are broadcasting live, there's a video playing behind Loki as there usually

47
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,920
is.

48
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,920
What is this?

49
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,840
It is Minecraft, I'm seeing, right?

50
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
Yeah.

51
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,880
It's the last episode that I put out.

52
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,560
So I ended my season on Collusion MC.

53
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,000
So yeah.

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,640
Well, congratulations on your first season and getting canceled, but new and better things

55
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,640
in store, right?

56
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,680
Well, it's not getting canceled.

57
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:39,320
They just started their second season, actually, and I've been playing on it since I'm waiting

58
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:45,520
for the NerdCraft server to start because they're waiting for some server RAM.

59
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,520
Gotcha.

60
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
Un-canceled.

61
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
Saved by Netflix.

62
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
All right.

63
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,880
And I noticed in chat, S2100 Matt is commenting on your beard.

64
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,080
Loki's beard is coming in thick.

65
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,080
I'm impressed.

66
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,080
Are you trying to grow out your beard?

67
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,080
No.

68
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,080
No.

69
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,080
It's lazy.

70
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
I understand.

71
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
I understand.

72
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,000
For what it's worth, it's quite fetching.

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,320
Thank you.

74
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,200
It's also probably the flannel too.

75
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,640
I've been kind of on a flannel kick lately.

76
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,720
The whole Lumberjack chic.

77
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,040
It is the weather here in Northern California for a Lumberjack dress.

78
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
I don't blame you.

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,560
I don't blame you.

80
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,720
I was in my onesie until about five minutes ago, and then I realized I get really warm

81
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,000
under these lights.

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,120
I love playing video games in my little office in my Snuggie.

83
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,760
Yes, I still rock the Snuggie blanket.

84
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,080
Do they even still run those commercials on TV?

85
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,080
Here I am chilling a product.

86
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,600
There's a different thing now.

87
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Is it?

88
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Well, I still-

89
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
It's like a cloak thing.

90
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Yeah, that's right.

91
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,720
There's like a demon cloak that they sell now, but I still rock that blue Snuggie that

92
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,640
they sent me, or that I bought, that a friend sent me.

93
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,200
This blanket that I'm wearing was free.

94
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
Nice.

95
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,760
And it is older than Julian.

96
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
Aw.

97
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
I love that.

98
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
And it's warm.

99
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
Oh my God.

100
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,760
How old is that kid now?

101
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,760
I think he's got to be like 16, 17.

102
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,760
13.

103
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,760
Oh, I thought older than that.

104
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,760
No, he's going to be 14 in April.

105
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,760
Oh, wow.

106
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
Still.

107
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
Still.

108
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,760
My gosh.

109
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:13,240
And of course, that's Dark Soccer's BFF, yeah, her kid, and who's been on the show before,

110
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,240
but it was a while ago.

111
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,040
I understand we have probably some new listeners since several years ago when Julian came on

112
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,040
the show to talk about, I think, Minecraft and Puzzle Pirates and the types of games

113
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,520
he was into at the time.

114
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,520
So yeah.

115
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,160
He was doing Pirates 101.

116
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
That's it.

117
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
I'm sorry.

118
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,160
It was Pirates 101, not Puzzle Pirates.

119
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,160
I get them confused.

120
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
My bad.

121
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,360
All right.

122
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,680
Let's jump into some gaming news.

123
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,720
That's what we do here at Orange Lounge Radio for the next few hours.

124
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,800
And yeah, the news is picking back up this week after the holiday Thanksgiving week that

125
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
we had last week.

126
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,880
The news is starting to pick up as people are returning to work for the rush before

127
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,600
the end of December and a lot of breaks that people take towards there in the new year

128
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,240
and all that good stuff.

129
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,360
So the news is picking up again.

130
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,640
And we start tonight with a story about a game I play an awful lot of.

131
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,400
So I'm going to get into my gaming week a little bit early, but I'm sure many of you

132
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,740
out there, even if you don't play this game, you've been reading about this and you probably

133
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,460
thought, you know, Rob might have something to say about all this tonight and you would

134
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,460
be correct.

135
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,860
And this has to do with the launch of Final Fantasy 14's latest expansion, Endwalker.

136
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,860
So here's the deal.

137
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:27,320
Technically, Endwalker launched in early access on Friday, which means if you had a digital

138
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:32,060
preorder code or I think any type of preorder code, if you actually got one, I heard some

139
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,980
stores are having problems delivering on that.

140
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,420
But if you got a preorder code, you got to get into the game on Friday, even though the

141
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,100
expansion doesn't actually launch until Tuesday.

142
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,860
The reality of that is, though, that that is the launch day.

143
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,860
Like let's be real.

144
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,220
You know, Final Fantasy 14, it's been growing.

145
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,280
It's bigger than ever.

146
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,060
It's got a lot of more fans.

147
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,180
And yeah, and they've been hyping up this expansion.

148
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,300
And who doesn't want to play the brand new expansion when it comes out?

149
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,060
So Friday was the launch day.

150
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,700
Like Samantha, everything else is just semantics.

151
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:07,820
And I think part of that has been to hide issues like what's been happening this weekend

152
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,820
in the past.

153
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:14,140
For example, a lot of folks in the community joke about Raobahn EX with the Stormblood

154
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,140
launch.

155
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,740
And that was a problem that happened when they launched the expansion two expansions

156
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,740
ago.

157
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,340
Stormblood was that there was a character, Raobahn, and you had to talk to him to start

158
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,340
a solo mission.

159
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,700
Well, the problem was so many people were hounding him.

160
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,540
In a nutshell, he was having a problem cuing everybody for the solo instance.

161
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,780
He started rejecting people and you couldn't proceed past this point.

162
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:41,140
And it was pretty early on in the story and it got really frustrating for a lot of people.

163
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,740
But what happened is that that ended up being, oh, well, that was part of early access, early

164
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,740
launch.

165
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,700
And by Tuesday, when the real launch happened, they were able to patch that and fix that

166
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,780
and all that good stuff.

167
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,060
So most of the time they've been able to kind of hide behind, well, all the problems were

168
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,460
during early access and that's kind of what it feels like it ends up being.

169
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,700
Here's something very interesting that happened this year.

170
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,940
And I think we talked about it last week, or at least I remember tweeting about it.

171
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,440
It might've been something that came out early this week.

172
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,020
The producer behind Final Fantasy XIV, Naoki Yoshida, and his team came out and said, and

173
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,060
I'm going to paraphrase here the way I interpreted it.

174
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,460
And they said, there are going to be server problems when this game launches.

175
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:28,220
We have tried everything we can to try to mitigate this, but you are probably going

176
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:33,220
to have problems and you're probably going to have to wait in a queue to play the game.

177
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,500
And, well, he was right.

178
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,300
A lot of that has been being hit.

179
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:45,780
He also said, because a lot of people wondered if they knew this game was bigger than ever

180
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,480
and they knew they had so many pre-orders that were sold, why didn't they try to buy

181
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,780
more equipment, even if temporary, to boost the servers?

182
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,840
And here's the fascinating thing about this scenario, they did.

183
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,540
Naoki Yoshida said, we tried.

184
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:06,180
We can't get the parts because of the semiconductor shortages.

185
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:13,280
So, in other words, they could not expand the server space to accommodate this expansion

186
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,140
because of crypto and NFT.

187
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,580
Although he didn't actually phrase it that way, but I'm going to go ahead and phrase

188
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,560
it that way because that is a big part of what's causing the semiconductor shortage.

189
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,220
But it still was a fascinating situation.

190
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,980
We've been following games a long time.

191
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,820
We've been playing a lot of MMOs.

192
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,280
We collectively have played a lot of MMOs.

193
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,100
I don't just mean World of Warcraft.

194
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:44,740
I mean Final Fantasy XI, Ragnarok Online, hell, I remember touching Ultima Online for

195
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,740
a hot minute and there's a lot of other things collectively we've tried.

196
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,200
I don't know about you guys, I can't ever think of a time where the developers actually

197
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:00,960
came out and warned, this may be a problem and we tried to mitigate it and we couldn't.

198
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,200
So this is uncharted territory.

199
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:10,360
Well, sure enough, the game launched on Friday, everybody wanted to get in, and there's queue

200
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,320
problems out the wazoo.

201
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,440
And here's the thing, the queue system, you know, you've seen a lot of screenshots on

202
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,400
social media from your friends that play Final Fantasy XIV, I'm sure, with these LOLWTF queue

203
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
times.

204
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,920
5,000 people in queue, 10,000 people in queue, and just like a ton of people waiting to get

205
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,160
in the game.

206
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,240
And I think I can speak for most of the fans, there's always going to be the extreme opinions,

207
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,800
I think I can speak for most of the fans and say, the 5 and 10,000 person queue actually

208
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:45,780
really isn't the problem, yes, it's unfortunate, yes, it's a long wait, but you warned us,

209
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,780
and that's not the problem.

210
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,320
Here's the problem.

211
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,140
People are getting kicked out of that queue.

212
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,540
And an unexpected error will happen after a little bit of time, you're going to get

213
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,440
an error that says 2002, a lobby error.

214
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,160
And when people see that, and then they click OK, and they go and they get frustrated, whatever,

215
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,200
eventually they try to get back in, and oh, they're back at the end of the line, please

216
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,680
wait 5,000 people to get back in the, and of course people are not signing out.

217
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,280
So yikes.

218
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,940
So people get very frustrated because like, I don't mind waiting in line, it's when I

219
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,220
get kicked out of line that I get pissed off.

220
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,860
Now, you may or may not know this, Final Fantasy XIV people, they're challenged with this right

221
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:32,640
now, 2002 specifically apparently has a workaround, and I've done this myself, I did it 5 times

222
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,580
last night, I got kicked out of queue 5 times in a 4,000 person queue last night, and this

223
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,540
worked every single time.

224
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,480
You have to keep an eye on it, because if you're able to click OK, log back in the game,

225
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,800
even if the game kind of errors you out like 3 or 4 times, keep trying to force your way

226
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
in.

227
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,200
If you can get back in that queue in like 5 minutes, you will not lose your place.

228
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,080
If it's a 2002 error.

229
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,340
And I don't think a lot of people know that.

230
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,640
I think they give up, they get frustrated, and they go do something else, which I totally

231
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,640
get.

232
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,480
Here's the other problem, and again I speak from this from experience.

233
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,320
There are other errors besides 2002.

234
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,060
Last night, I tried to sign into the game at a later hour, about 930 Pacific, I figured

235
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,560
it's after midnight Eastern, people were going to start going to bed, so I started to sign

236
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,760
into the game at 930 Pacific.

237
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:24,840
Suddenly at 11 o'clock, I'm down to one person in queue, which I think is a fake message,

238
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,040
but it says one person in queue.

239
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,400
And then error 4004, I get kicked out of the game.

240
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,960
And I go, all right, well, I'll just do what I usually do, log right back in.

241
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,320
I log back in, please wait 3,950 people.

242
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,360
And that was the point when I said, all right, I am not doing this again until I hear the

243
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,760
queue problems are resolved.

244
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,400
Yes, I want to play the game.

245
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,100
Yes, I'm frustrated, I'm seeing people all over social media tweeting about the story

246
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,840
and how great it is.

247
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,640
I was able to play quite a bit on Friday, so I'll be thankful for that, I guess.

248
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,120
I got through the 81 dungeon in that part of the game, but it is very clear that is

249
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,440
all I'm going to get until they work some of these issues out.

250
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,440
So how are they going to work it out?

251
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
What are they going to do?

252
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:17,200
Well, now Kiyoshita did post an update today about everything that's going on.

253
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,480
And in the update, there was a lot that he actually went over, sorry, I'm trying to bring

254
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,240
up the story here.

255
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,080
Okay, so he actually apologized for the congestion.

256
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:33,280
And this was one thing that really struck me actually is that in the statement, he says

257
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,540
a few times he says, I'm sorry.

258
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,700
He doesn't say we're sorry.

259
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,980
He doesn't say sorry, you are having a problem.

260
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,300
He says, I'm sorry.

261
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,540
I want to point that out, highlight it, underline it, because this is why Naoki Yoshida, despite

262
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:54,080
all these issues, is really respected by the Final Fantasy 14 game player base.

263
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,660
Gaming executives take note, that is accountability.

264
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,700
I'm sorry.

265
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,420
Not we're sorry, or sorry, you are having a problem.

266
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,420
I'm sorry.

267
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,020
I think there's a lot of executives that can learn from that.

268
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,200
And certainly there's something about the culture, you know, and so forth and why a

269
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,620
Japanese based company is probably treating this a little differently than I think if

270
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,940
certain other companies were having this problem.

271
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,740
He does go on to say that all players are going to be awarded with seven days free gaming

272
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,740
time.

273
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,980
So basically, you're going to get seven days of time for free because of these issues,

274
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:33,180
which is, I mean, what else literally can they do?

275
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,260
This is the weirdest situation.

276
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,600
The game is too popular for its own good.

277
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:47,040
It is literally too popular and they cannot expand because of supply shortages.

278
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,980
So literally, and he did say in the statement, seven days for now.

279
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,500
But if this keeps continuing, paraphrasing, if this keeps continuing, we're going to look

280
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,440
at doing more.

281
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,600
So I mean, I appreciate that, you know, as a Final Fantasy 14 player who is frustrated

282
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,140
with the lost time on Saturday, I do appreciate that.

283
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:10,100
I'm not sure what the fuck else they can do at this point.

284
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,380
So people are talking about, well, those of us that have been 3,000 subscribed for 3,000

285
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,600
days, we should get priority and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

286
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,080
Please allow me to say this as somebody who has been playing Final Fantasy 14 since 1.0

287
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:30,700
and the alpha for A Realm Reborn, shut the fuck up and stop gatekeeping this game.

288
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,860
You're being an entitled bitch right now and you need to stop it.

289
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,040
So that is not going to fly.

290
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,020
There needs to be a fair solution that works for everybody.

291
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:45,380
And really what the solution is, they just, they need to figure out why is 2002, why is

292
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:50,500
4004, why are these issues kicking people out of line when they're in line?

293
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,240
Naoki Yoshida in the statement does continue to try to like explain what the networking

294
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,240
problems are.

295
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,020
He says there could be problems if you're on Wi-Fi versus wired and basically pledges

296
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,580
that they're going to work on those types of issues.

297
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:12,580
But outside of that, I honestly don't know what happens besides those that are able to

298
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:17,360
wake up at four in the morning and start signing in when nobody else is signing in and get

299
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,340
in the game and have burned through all the content.

300
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:25,340
Those people are going to get bored because they're going to hit the top and nobody else

301
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,340
is there.

302
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,340
It's an MMO.

303
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,960
There's nothing else to do.

304
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,700
And I think those people will get bored and hopefully stop logging in and then eventually

305
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,080
people can catch up and hopefully things will find its rhythm again.

306
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,320
I think they need to delay the release of the raid content.

307
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,560
And I know that is not a popular answer and people are going to hate me for that, especially

308
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,720
end game content raiders, but the rest of us need an opportunity to get there.

309
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,540
And I think they need to cut back on the fever to get to the end as fast as possible.

310
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,840
They need to delay the launch of the raid content.

311
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,600
And I know, again, that will not be a popular decision.

312
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,280
I kind of don't care because, again, I think people need to stop gatekeeping Final Fantasy

313
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:10,380
14 and the raiders can wait two more fucking weeks because, quite honestly, there's a part

314
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,800
of me that really feels this game should have been delayed further.

315
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,780
And I know that would have frustrated me as a fan, but I really think they should have

316
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,820
looked to delaying it to earlier next year when they could have gotten some of the semiconductor

317
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,160
parts and all that good stuff.

318
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,820
And again, as a fan, that would have been super frustrating.

319
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:32,300
But in retrospect, I kind of wish they just would have delayed it to early next year.

320
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:39,260
However, I also understand investors, money, fiscal year, this is Square's cash cow right

321
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,260
now, blah, blah, blah.

322
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,540
That probably was never a plan that was going to fly.

323
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,680
Two weeks was probably bad enough.

324
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,740
So I get that.

325
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,740
I'm going to chat for some comments.

326
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:55,460
VXJ6V, sorry, Jason, our voiceover guy, VXJ6V says, Big enough is never enough.

327
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:01,100
These issues at scale, Final Fantasy XIV, wow, et cetera, will never be fixed.

328
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,620
True.

329
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,580
Questbuster in chat says, hearing that kind of perspective from the developers is frankly

330
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,580
refreshing.

331
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,580
Yikes.

332
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,860
And then Mike Deft goes on to say, Yoshi P is a godsend.

333
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,060
Fifth Dream says Yoshi P, best game director.

334
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:18,180
Like I said, Final Fantasy XVI, no pressure at all, right?

335
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,180
Anyway.

336
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,940
I have one more hot take on this.

337
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,020
You guys want to hear this?

338
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:27,180
Because I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you who is to blame for these issues.

339
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:31,860
And I'm going to name one specific individual who is to blame for these issues.

340
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,180
And it's not Yoshi P. It's not who you think.

341
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,740
You guys want to hear my take?

342
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,740
Sure.

343
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,740
Thanks.

344
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,740
Thanks for the reassurance.

345
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,740
Here it is.

346
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,700
Here is who to blame for Final Fantasy XIV's launch problems.

347
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,540
Bobby Kotick.

348
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:53,300
Bobby Kotick is the person to blame for Final Fantasy XIV's launch issues.

349
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,580
Some of you probably are already starting to connect the dots on why I'm saying this.

350
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,620
Please allow me to explain.

351
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,060
Final Fantasy XIV is more popular than it's ever been before.

352
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,260
Why?

353
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,180
World of Warcraft, unfortunately, has been starting to tank.

354
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,540
People are turning away from the game.

355
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,380
And I know I have friends that are still very loyal to that game, but I think they're loyal

356
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,180
to their communities, not the game.

357
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:22,620
And you're starting to see communities in massive numbers start to go over to Final

358
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,100
Fantasy XIV.

359
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,420
In fact, you know there's been a lot of streamers that have done it.

360
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,900
I know a lot of the media says, Asmongold, Asmongold, sure, there was him and he has

361
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,800
a lot of influence online.

362
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,660
For every Asmongold, there's plenty of other smaller streamers and their communities that

363
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,700
are going over to Final Fantasy XIV.

364
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,620
Again, I don't intend to gatekeep Final Fantasy XIV.

365
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,740
I welcome all of those people.

366
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:50,500
But it is the cause for why the popularity has gone through the roof and why we see these

367
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,860
reports that more people were playing Final Fantasy XIV on Steam this last weekend than

368
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,520
ever have before.

369
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,100
And Steam is just one place to play the game.

370
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,640
You can play without Steam.

371
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,800
You can play on a Mac.

372
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,300
You can play on a PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5.

373
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,580
So this game is clearly more popular than it's ever been before because people are leaving

374
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,180
World of Warcraft.

375
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,180
Why are people leaving World of Warcraft?

376
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,580
When did people start leaving World of Warcraft?

377
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,420
When did World of Warcraft start getting bad?

378
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,760
Can you all think of a point in time?

379
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,700
When did World of Warcraft start getting bad?

380
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,620
Dark Soccer, when did it start getting bad?

381
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,820
Right after whatever came after Legion.

382
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:37,700
And that would have been right around the time that Activision purchased Blizzard.

383
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,700
What else?

384
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,740
Not Burning Legion, not Burning Crusade, but like Legion.

385
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,140
Yeah.

386
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,300
Um, and those would have been pro- that was a little bit after, but you could say that

387
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:51,640
those are the expansions that started under Activision's watch, uh, most likely.

388
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,240
And what else happened with the Activision takeover?

389
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,380
These horrible things that we're hearing about on the side with the sexual harassment and

390
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,980
the threats to kill people and all this disgusting shit.

391
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,300
I really don't want to rehash tonight, but please refer to earlier episodes or literally

392
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,140
anywhere else on the internet right now about what is going on with all that.

393
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:16,380
But all of that behavior ended up driving out the talent at Blizzard.

394
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,300
I mean, one of the few really successful things Blizzard has been able to launch under Activision's

395
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,400
watch was Overwatch.

396
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,000
What happened to the creative director of Overwatch recently?

397
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
He left.

398
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
He left.

399
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,020
Why did he leave?

400
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,780
He was sick of Activision's bullshit.

401
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:38,100
I'm very much reading between the lines, but if you read the report from the staffs and

402
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,620
everything like that, that man, Jeff Kaplan, would often protect his teams from the bullshit

403
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,800
Activision corporate overlords.

404
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,740
So Blizzard started going downhill, WoW started going downhill when Activision started taking

405
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,740
over.

406
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,460
And what is preventing Blizzard from- why are people continuing to leave Blizzard?

407
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,800
You just saw in the news, one of the big tweet folks this week who was instrumental in putting

408
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,340
together a better ABK and all this stuff, she's leaving Blizzard.

409
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,720
Why is she leaving Blizzard?

410
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,640
Because Bobby Kotick still refuses to resign.

411
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,580
So hopefully now the dotted line path is clear.

412
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,520
The person responsible for your Final Fantasy XIV issues this weekend are crypto miners,

413
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,880
NFT folks, and Bobby Kotick.

414
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,000
That's it.

415
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,440
I also want to remind everybody Bobby Kotick should have resigned probably years ago, but

416
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,880
those issues that just came up in the Washington Post are about three weeks old now, and he

417
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,880
still has not resigned.

418
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,140
And yep, I'm going to bring this up a lot until he does, because we need to keep the

419
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,200
pressure up on him and the board.

420
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,400
And we have a story coming up a little later, you know, little Rob Roberts in his spare

421
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,360
room on his dinky little podcast probably doesn't matter, but some folks that matter

422
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,220
are starting to put the pressure on, and we'll get to that later in the show.

423
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:02,220
But it's, yeah, it's very interesting.

424
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,220
Going to chat.

425
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,940
SJ100Matt says it all comes back to Voldecotek.

426
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,500
Yeah, what?

427
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,940
I mean, I know some of you guys are going to think I'm like being dramatic or whatever,

428
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,580
and you know, whatever.

429
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,920
But think about it.

430
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:22,740
Why would Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft all come out and talk about their concerns about Activision?

431
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:28,580
Because all of this affects them too.

432
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,240
Questbuster in chat says, I remember when ATVI said years ago they would stop reporting

433
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,740
subscriber numbers for World of Warcraft in their quarterly fiscal reports.

434
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,840
Everything I'm hearing, and this is hearsay, I have no facts to back it up, so take it

435
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:46,540
as that, is that the game is in worse state subscriber numbers than it's ever been, and

436
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,220
it is classic keeping it afloat right now.

437
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,660
But again, that could be just social media hysteria, I have nothing to back that up.

438
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,380
But it all comes back to Voldecotek.

439
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,380
Garbage.

440
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,380
Yep.

441
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:03,920
So anyway, I don't know what else to say about the login issues.

442
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:11,400
You know, as a Final Fantasy XIV player, sure, I'm frustrated, but we were warned about it.

443
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,500
And I kind of like, I see it for what it is.

444
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,420
Like Yoshi P is doing the best damn job he can.

445
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,340
Like he tried to get the parts.

446
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,180
He can't get the parts.

447
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,180
Like what?

448
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,300
I feel bad for him.

449
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,820
I don't know what else he can do.

450
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,060
But I think they need to push back the raid content and they just need to slow the timetable

451
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:35,100
down so that everybody has a nice chance to consume the content.

452
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:40,740
And the reality is, the power users and the people that are already level 90, I mean I'm

453
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,840
sorry folks, maybe you're on a low pop server or something like that, but the focus needs

454
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:50,380
to be taken off that group and give them, purposefully, less things to do so they stop

455
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,380
logging in.

456
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,020
And it's not going to be a popular resolution.

457
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:58,340
I think it's the only resolution at this point.

458
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,340
For now.

459
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,340
But we'll see.

460
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,340
Maybe in a week they fix some of these other issues, and maybe during the work week less

461
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,860
people are deciding to take off work to play a video game expansion and stuff.

462
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,780
Look I've done it before too, I get it.

463
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,540
And maybe the numbers will help thin out a little bit, but we'll see.

464
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,540
We'll see.

465
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,620
So anyway, those are the issues going on with Final Fantasy XIV's launch.

466
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,900
Otherwise I'm going to say this, I know we're getting into our gaming weeks, I'm getting

467
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,900
a little ahead of myself.

468
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:26,660
I will say this, Friday night, when I was able to play and get past the level 81 dungeon,

469
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:31,940
and I'm not going to spoil or say anything about the story, I'm just going to say, there's

470
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,980
a lot of things done really well in this expansion.

471
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:41,420
I'm really hooked into the story already, and a lot of the Final Fantasy IV references

472
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,660
are so good.

473
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:50,580
Right up to the level 81 dungeon has a ton of them, and I was giddy doing that dungeon

474
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,580
for the first time.

475
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,660
I am having some sound tearing issues, and some technical problems I didn't even get

476
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,100
into yet.

477
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:02,020
I don't know if that has to do with the launch or what, but I'm not going to bore you all

478
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,460
with my technical problems.

479
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,300
I was able to power through it, and I really loved what I experienced so far.

480
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,420
And yeah, I'm bummed I can't be the first through the story like everyone else wants

481
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,820
to be, but it is what it is.

482
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,340
Anyway, let's get to everybody else's gaming weeks.

483
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,080
I do have other stuff I can talk about later, but traditionally we start with Dark Sakura,

484
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,800
so Jamie, how was your gaming week?

485
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,760
It was lots of Dead by Daylight.

486
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,600
If you log in every day, it's sort of, I like how Bourbon said it, it was like a sort of

487
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,880
an advent calendar sort of thing.

488
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,320
You log in every day, you get blood points or iridescent shards or different things in

489
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
game.

490
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,320
So definitely you're playing Dead by Daylight.

491
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,420
Oh, a lot of mobile phone games do that incentive thing.

492
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,040
Daily login bonus.

493
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,280
But this is not a mobile game.

494
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,200
Well, I mean, there's a mobile version, but this is the-

495
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,120
I know, but it's the same concept.

496
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
Yeah.

497
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,480
And there's also a couple of blood point codes floating around.

498
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,480
One is Ho Ho Ho.

499
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
What'd you call it?

500
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,480
Girl, you know you a ho, OK?

501
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
Anyway.

502
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,000
And so I've been doing that.

503
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,400
I've also been playing a lot.

504
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,040
I'm calling it a game for right now, but just because I got it on Steam, but I'm playing

505
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:16,840
in Vroid Studio trying to work on an avatar.

506
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,760
Not that I think I'm going to be a VTuber or anything, but who knows, it'll be good

507
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,720
for those days where I don't feel like doing makeup.

508
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:35,440
And then I've been playing my wordscapes and we have ACDC pinball back in the house now.

509
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,440
And Dance Buddy Will has been over, so there's been a lot of pinball going on in my house.

510
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,080
And I picked up another game on Steam today.

511
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:50,360
There's a sale going on for the same company that does No Man's Sky.

512
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,680
Oh, I know the game because I played a little bit of it.

513
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,680
Go ahead.

514
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,680
What game?

515
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,680
The campfire game.

516
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,680
No.

517
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,920
Oh, I thought you said it was, OK, go ahead.

518
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,840
It's the same company, but I didn't get that game.

519
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:12,340
I got one, gosh, it's called Chime Sharp.

520
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,380
It's like a music Tetris-y, puzzle-y game and it looks pretty interesting.

521
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,260
Hmm, I'll have to look that up.

522
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:24,200
I hate the art style in it, so I'm never going to buy it, but I love the little avatar they

523
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,200
have for it.

524
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,980
It's Kitty Powers matchmaker.

525
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:31,780
It just makes me think that that's like a drag queen trying to hook people up.

526
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,020
I think it's adorable.

527
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,740
Kitty Powers love life.

528
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,980
Just the Kitty Powers character is really, really hilarious looking.

529
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,260
Actually, I think that is a drag queen.

530
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,260
But anyway.

531
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,260
Yeah.

532
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,140
She was at the first GamerX, if I remember right.

533
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:52,220
Yeah, but I was looking at, I wanted to play some of those escape room games, but they're

534
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,220
not Mac and I'm still waiting on my VHS key.

535
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,180
Oh yeah, that game looks cool.

536
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,180
Yeah.

537
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,700
I've been watching Dro play it a lot.

538
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,100
It's been really, it looks really interesting.

539
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:13,980
I still think I might like Dead by Daylight still better, but I also, speaking of Dead

540
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:20,020
by Daylight, when I go on my medical leave, I will be televising my mental breakdown live

541
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,140
on the internet.

542
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:26,340
So there we go.

543
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,340
I look forward to it.

544
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:34,220
I know I was going to say Jamie, I mean, but I can appreciate that you are doing something

545
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:39,620
that you have done for a while as like that routine thing to kind of keep you grounded

546
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,620
through the process.

547
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,260
I think, I think is the nicer way I'd put it.

548
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,260
Yeah.

549
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,260
And actually Dark Tetsuya is mentioning that Dead by Daylight is free on the Epic Games

550
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,260
Store.

551
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,260
It's free until the ninth.

552
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,260
Yes.

553
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:55,860
And we have been seeing a lot of baby killers and baby survivors as a result, and I'm looking

554
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,860
forward to killing them all.

555
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:03,940
And just a public service announcement because I know it is very

556
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,940
well-intentioned.

557
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:08,300
I appreciate people want to make sure we're in the loop on that.

558
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:14,180
I have been told more times than I can count on my hands that DVD is free on the Epic Store

559
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,020
and we did bring it up on last week's show.

560
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,020
So many fucking people.

561
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,020
Thank you though.

562
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:21,640
I appreciate people think of us and so forth, but I just want to be clear.

563
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,640
We know.

564
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,640
Thank you.

565
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,820
I just took the opportunity to remind people that it's going to be free until the ninth.

566
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,300
Let me flip it in a positive way.

567
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,100
And we want you to get it before the ninth.

568
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,100
Don't tell us to get it.

569
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,180
We know you get it before the ninth.

570
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,600
That's the positive spin I'm going to put on it.

571
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:47,380
But at any rate, if you do start playing during this period, don't be discouraged.

572
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,560
You will die many, many times, survivors.

573
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,860
You will die.

574
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,340
And if you are a killer, be prepared to get lots and lots of teabagging throwing your

575
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,340
way.

576
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,620
It's going to happen.

577
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,740
You are not going to win your first match.

578
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,900
Darth Tetsuya in chat says, y'all sucked me in.

579
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,900
Congratulations.

580
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,900
There you go.

581
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,900
Let's put in.

582
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,900
Let's put a notch on the wall.

583
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,900
There you go.

584
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,900
One down.

585
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,860
SSG100 Matt, I think is trolling.

586
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,700
Oh, you can get it free on the Epic Game Store.

587
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,700
Yes.

588
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:23,140
But as a reminder, also on Game Pass for you Xbox slash Windows Game Store affectionados.

589
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,140
So.

590
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,860
And none of y'all can get the Demogorgon and it'll be your loss.

591
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,860
Yeah.

592
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,860
That's okay.

593
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,860
There's better killers.

594
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,860
All right.

595
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:34,580
Everybody is adorable, but do you know what this means, Rob?

596
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,580
You know what this means?

597
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,580
Huh?

598
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,580
No more toxic chips.

599
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,580
Ahoy, Steve.

600
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,580
Oh.

601
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,580
Or whatever.

602
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,820
Oh, there's plenty that already bought this.

603
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,260
There's plenty of them already there, but there won't be any more added to it.

604
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,260
All right.

605
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,260
Scoops Ahoy.

606
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,260
Or Broccoli Nancy.

607
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,260
It's it's.

608
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,020
What was his, what was his like Ahoy hat?

609
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,020
It's Scoops Ahoy.

610
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,020
Scoops Ahoy.

611
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,020
Scoops Ahoy.

612
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,020
That was it.

613
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,460
Well, no more Scoops Ahoy, Toxic Steve and no more Broccoli Nancy.

614
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,860
I will say, and this is the last I'm going to say on this because we do need to move

615
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,660
on from a topic besides Dead by Daylight.

616
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,420
But um, and, and, and, and my husband, Alan said that, or maybe you had said this, Jamie,

617
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,460
I'm confusing you with my husband and that's starting to worry me, Dark Soccer, but we

618
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,420
spend that much time together.

619
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:19,840
Um, one of you said this and that maybe I think you both did, and that is that they

620
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,720
have that skin for Jonathan in the game that is a replacement for Steve and that's cool,

621
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,220
but they really missed an opportunity before they pulled the rights to have an alternate

622
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:35,740
for Nancy, who is the other Scoops Ahoy girl that was in season three.

623
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,740
That is.

624
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,740
I didn't say that.

625
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,740
Okay.

626
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,740
Then it was Alan.

627
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,740
Who's Uma Thurman.

628
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,740
I wanted Barb.

629
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,740
Who's Barb, but Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke's daughter.

630
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,140
I don't remember her name, but she's, she plays that.

631
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,380
She would have been a great addition.

632
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,940
I loved her character.

633
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:54,700
So anyway, no, we just have extra Nancy.

634
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,700
Yes.

635
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,700
All right.

636
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,700
Anything else for your gaming week?

637
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,180
No.

638
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,180
Okay.

639
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,180
Then we'll go to Loki.

640
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,180
Loki.

641
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,180
How was your gaming week?

642
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:11,580
It was video editing and Minecraft, so, uh, it was finishing up season one, which we have

643
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,740
the last episode playing behind me, um, on video.

644
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,740
You're watching the video.

645
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:21,980
And so basically I was finishing up the last episode of season one of collusion because

646
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:27,060
they are resetting their, well, they have reset their server as of Friday and I've actually

647
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,060
been playing on that.

648
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,100
The plan is, I'm not sure if I'm going to be making content on here.

649
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:36,500
I may make a few videos on here, but primarily I'm going to be on nerd craft season two,

650
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,180
whenever that launches.

651
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:43,280
So the way I've been kind of playing it is the collusion stuff's going to be more just

652
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:49,920
like kind of low key, um, not really going to like stress on making like large builds

653
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,920
and stuff like that.

654
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,320
Just more kind of having fun and just playing regular Minecraft.

655
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:01,040
Like today, for example, I built a community farm for, um, a blaze spawner, so blaze farm

656
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,740
for the community to use because they had one set up on the server last season.

657
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,760
So I figured, you know, I'll pitch in, in that kind of sense.

658
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,460
And then the other thing I want to do is like, um, if you take a boat on ice, they go really

659
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,460
fast.

660
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:17,400
And so you can make like a drift course with those and around the place where I've set

661
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,020
up my base, um, just tons of huge ice reversed.

662
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,820
So I may make a course through that.

663
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:28,680
So that kind of stuff kind of contributing to the server, but once, you know, the nerd

664
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,900
craft stuff launches, I mean, playing primarily on there, but I'll come back and visit the

665
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,260
server as much as I can.

666
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:39,020
Cause it was kind of hard cause you know, I was torn leaving the server in the first

667
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:43,380
place because there was really no one playing for the last like four months, which is like

668
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,900
half of the season.

669
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,900
And so it was tough.

670
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,300
Like if I want to grow my channel, I can't really do that when I'm not interacting with

671
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,620
anybody.

672
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:54,820
I kind of felt bad cause they understood why and they're very cool about it.

673
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:59,420
And you know, they're insistent, like, listen, we know that you're not going to play on here,

674
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,420
we'll keep you white listed.

675
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,940
You can come visit as much as you want.

676
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,420
And I was like, okay, well fine.

677
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:07,580
I'll, I'll, I'll play as much as I can and like support, you know, as much as I can.

678
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:12,700
And I mean, it's, it's, it's, you know, definitely, um, kicking right now we've got, you know,

679
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,940
there's probably like eight players playing at all times.

680
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,820
Plus they have voice chat now, which is cool.

681
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,820
The proximity chat.

682
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,820
Oh, cool.

683
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,500
So it's been, it's been kind of fun.

684
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,460
So running into different people and they're trying to build a little bit closer together.

685
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,820
And so they're just kind of getting that server stuff off the ground.

686
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:32,540
We finally come back and visit, but yeah, once we get into the new season, um, with

687
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,540
a nerd craft and stuff, it's just going to be some massive builds and everything like

688
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,540
before.

689
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,700
So, but yeah, just been playing Minecraft.

690
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,700
Awesome.

691
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:46,740
It sounds like you've, uh, had a lot of, uh, good, good times and good memories being made

692
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,740
there.

693
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,260
I need to, I need to dabble back in Minecraft.

694
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,700
It keeps up.

695
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,700
One 18 is amazing.

696
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,700
Yeah.

697
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:58,380
You need to play one 18 because it's just, you know, it's all sorts of craziness.

698
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:03,060
My schedule and gaming suddenly freed up with my inability to play Final Fantasy 14.

699
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,180
And I finished that no man's sky expedition to transition to my gaming week.

700
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,940
I finished the no man's sky expedition, the redo.

701
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,460
So I got my golden Starship.

702
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,740
So did Alan, by the way.

703
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,100
So applause for us both.

704
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,100
Um, but the no man's sky, I did two and three.

705
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,400
I don't need to do those again.

706
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,400
So I have nothing to do.

707
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
No man's sky till the end of the month.

708
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,720
And then Alan and I might start a multiplayer thing, uh, and maybe stream a little bit of

709
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
it, but we'll see.

710
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,920
But anyway, I might do Minecraft just to scratch the itch of the crafting stuff.

711
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,800
Cause you know, there's a lot of that in no man's sky is like a lot of Minecraft really

712
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,840
check out one 18, just like pop in a server and just check it out because like the caves

713
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:44,000
and everything are completely different before there's like very like, it's just really big

714
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,840
vistas and like, everything's kind of like, wow, it's like for the first time type stuff,

715
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,680
you know, they kind of get that, you know, first time playing Minecraft feeling again.

716
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,240
That's pretty fun.

717
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,160
I'm getting into other stuff for my gaming week.

718
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,160
I'm Marissa.

719
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,160
My cell is in chat.

720
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,160
Hi.

721
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,080
Saying my gaming week was sending Rob all my Pikmin bloom postcards because no one else

722
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,080
I know plays.

723
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,880
I have been seeing them, Marissa.

724
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,880
Hello.

725
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,880
Thank you for being here.

726
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,880
And uh, thank you for that.

727
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,880
I appreciate.

728
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,720
I wish I could send you as many back, but because my friend, you know, the Niantic friends

729
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,920
list cross pop it.

730
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,760
So if you add somebody in Pokemon go, they're automatically in Pikmin and, uh, with, uh,

731
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,360
you know, well, you don't have friends in Ingress, but they, they go back and forth.

732
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,840
So I actually have quite a few friends that are addicted to Niantic games like myself

733
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,520
because I met them playing Ingress.

734
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,200
So, um, I have quite a few people I have to set postcards to, but I always try to make

735
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,520
sure I send Marissa at least one or two cute ones from my week.

736
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,120
So, um, hope you've been enjoying those.

737
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:41,160
I will say I have continued to play a lot of Pikmin bloom, um, with everything I've

738
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,000
talked about in my own personal life over the last month, we're trying to be more active

739
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,360
and when I'm eating and all that stuff, I I've been doing pretty good on my walking.

740
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,000
Um, and Pikmin bloom has been a huge motivator for that.

741
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,840
I got to say, I hit level 29 today after a little, a little hike around.

742
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:02,320
I did a three mile walk today, uh, around one of the parks here and, uh, my Pikmin hit

743
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,320
level 29.

744
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,320
So that was pretty cool.

745
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,680
So, um, Oh, Marissa says I play on private property, so I'm probably encouraging trespassing.

746
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,320
How did you get a thing on your private property that you're not supposed to have that?

747
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,320
Just so you know.

748
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:22,160
So lucky you, um, let's see, I want to come visit now cause there's probably a portal

749
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,160
in there.

750
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
That's really hard to get.

751
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,240
Uh, anyway, um, so, uh, what else for my gaming week?

752
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,440
So honestly, no man's sky.

753
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,840
We talked about the final fantasy 14 Pikmin, honestly, guys, that really just leaves a

754
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,680
little bit of debt by daylight.

755
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:41,320
And, uh, I've just been trying to level up, uh, Jonah, cause I really wanted his ability,

756
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:46,480
the new, the new survivor, because I really wanted his ability, um, to, for, for my other

757
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,480
characters.

758
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,640
I got his level 30 ability, which is the one I wanted.

759
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:55,720
And then I saw as much as wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, you mean, uh, non bleach tips,

760
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,720
Guy fairy?

761
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,720
Yes.

762
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,720
Yes.

763
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,120
And as loud as he is, he's loud, but they get, well, a, I always run iron will anyway,

764
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:08,440
but B they gave him a skin that he wears a flat cap.

765
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
Like I do.

766
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,760
And like a little polo shirt.

767
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,560
I was like, Oh, I kind of love CIA guy.

768
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
Yeah, I know.

769
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,800
But, but I think it's good that we're having more, uh, of course Latino characters.

770
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,800
Yes.

771
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,600
And so freaking love Carmina.

772
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,600
Oh yeah.

773
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,720
Anyway, no, it's fine.

774
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,640
I brought it up, but I, it was a part of my week and I did some slightly different things.

775
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,160
So that's really it for my gaming week.

776
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,200
Um, yeah, uh, try to, I'll try to do some more streaming next week.

777
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,600
Uh, I I'm sorry, I never streamed Final Fantasy 14, but because of all the issues going on,

778
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,080
I think you can understand why.

779
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,440
And my sound tearing was pretty bad anyway.

780
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,480
I don't think it would have made for a great stream.

781
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,880
So there's that, uh, before we get into other news, Marissa, another comment in chat says

782
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,280
Pikmin bloom for me is just a more engaging step counter.

783
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,480
That's actually kind of what I like about it.

784
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,680
Is that it, um, uh, it's a lot more simple than ingress or Pokemon go.

785
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,100
It's a more set it and forget it kind of game.

786
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,880
And I, that's actually kind of what I like about it.

787
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,160
It makes it easier to multitask and play that game while you're doing other stuff, um, out

788
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,160
around the world.

789
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,520
Um, as to show 100 mountain chats has been playing forza horizon five when I can.

790
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,520
Yeah.

791
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,760
That's, that's what I need to do and go back and pick up those games.

792
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,020
I've really dropped cold Turkey because they keep stacking on top of each other.

793
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:33,260
Like all these game releases I want to play, I need to play more forza horizon five.

794
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:37,180
I dropped, um, Pokemon, uh, brilliant diamond shining pro.

795
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,860
I brought, I dropped diamond.

796
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:43,180
Like I barely touched it since that first weekend I played it and I need to remedy that

797
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,180
too.

798
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:48,020
Although I'm kind of waiting for like the home connection to be in there.

799
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,700
Cause then I can do the collection challenge and all that stuff.

800
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:55,060
So yeah, I didn't play Pokemon shield until like a year after it was out.

801
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,140
So I'll probably just be a little while before I go back and visit.

802
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:02,260
All right, we're going to get into some more news, just so you know, for scheduling purposes.

803
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,840
Uh, I know the holidays are coming up and a lot of shows are going to be off towards

804
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,840
the end of the month.

805
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,740
Um, honestly, the way the days fall this year in years past, there's been a show on the

806
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,300
25th or on new year's eve or something.

807
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,740
So we haven't really been able to do them, but the way things fall this year, we have

808
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:23,260
a show on January 2nd and a show on December 26th.

809
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,580
So we should be here for those shows.

810
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,820
Dark soccer may be off on the 2nd of January, but Loki and I will hold down the fort if

811
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,780
that's the case, uh, that night.

812
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:35,980
So, uh, we, we will still be or given you content through the next few weeks.

813
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:40,620
So please enjoy that much content I'm sure, but yeah, we'll, we'll see.

814
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:45,340
We might have to, uh, figure out, maybe invite a guest or try to get some evergreen content

815
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,340
somehow.

816
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,340
We'll talk about that.

817
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,340
That's for sure.

818
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,840
Hopefully catch up on our gaming backlogs.

819
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,420
So there shouldn't be any shows off for a little bit.

820
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:56,820
There probably will be a week or two off early next year, uh, for some reasons that I'll

821
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:02,420
get into in a future episode of the show, uh, for meantime, let's get into some gaming

822
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,580
news and some of the other headlines.

823
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:08,460
I guess I alluded to this one earlier, Loki, why don't you start off with this?

824
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:16,020
Uh, yeah, so, um, basically it's more Activision drama.

825
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:21,500
So Activision Blizzard King where the government officials are pressuring, um, the Activision

826
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:26,300
Blizzard guys again, because of, you know, stuff not actually happening.

827
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:32,320
And, um, basically now it's starting to affect the, or they're threatening their company's

828
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,020
profits as well.

829
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:38,860
So it's as we're concerned, the current CEO and board of directors don't have the skillset

830
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:43,480
nor the conviction to Institute these sweeping changes needed to transform their culture

831
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:48,300
to a source for us with the employees and the shareholders and the partners.

832
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:55,340
Um, apparently they have formed a workplace responsibility committee, but you know, we,

833
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,820
as we mentioned last week or the joke I made last week was yes, they formed the committee

834
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:03,420
to investigate themselves and they'll find no wrongdoing whatsoever.

835
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:09,180
Um, but basically they're trying to get the, uh, little public pressure as well, you know,

836
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:13,260
kind of going to the shareholders to try to push pressure on them.

837
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:18,260
And it, I think it has affected them a little bit monetarily, but I don't know if it's like

838
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:23,700
I think it was just temporary, didn't really seem to be like a big, um, hit in their stock

839
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,580
prices or anything like that.

840
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,580
Right.

841
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,900
Um, and then can I give a little more background here?

842
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:33,820
Just because I want to make sure with the, which government officials are upset and why

843
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:37,660
this is different from the criminal investigation happening in California.

844
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:42,140
What you have here is you have a series of States, um, where the treasures of the States

845
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:45,900
have basically come together to say, this is a problem at ABK.

846
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,900
Why?

847
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:52,740
Because you may or may not realize this, a lot of state money gets invested, um, in the

848
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,780
stock market, just like some of your money.

849
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:00,220
Um, because that is how a lot of States pay for like pension plans, uh, and pay for, um,

850
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,140
a lot of different elements of the state.

851
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:07,020
Uh, the money may be invested so that, you know, just like for why a private citizen

852
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,780
would do it, you want to try to make more money.

853
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:15,540
So the problem is because of these issues at ABK and the way the stock is going down,

854
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:21,140
maybe it's not having a huge impact on investments now, but these treasures are speaking up because

855
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:26,500
like whoa, whoa, this now this is starting to affect our money that goes into.

856
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:35,620
So basically the most capably vocal state, uh, shareholders that could possibly speak

857
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:38,820
up government officials are speaking up.

858
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,020
That's the long and short of it.

859
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,460
So I just, I just kind of want to explain that a little bit because I think it's easy

860
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,220
to say, Oh, the government's mad at ABK again.

861
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:48,500
But this is a little different because this isn't a criminal investigation.

862
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:53,200
This is right now it's impacting your money, which is what, again, the CEO is supposed

863
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,620
to be in charge of making sure it doesn't happen.

864
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,620
So sorry, Loki.

865
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:57,620
I just want to clarify.

866
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,140
No, no, that makes sense.

867
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:04,020
And yeah, I mean, maybe they're not necessarily great investment right now.

868
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:09,340
Um, but don't worry, they're going to turn those stock prices right around with the technique

869
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:13,260
that they've used in the past, which is, Hey, we're making lots of money, so let's lay off

870
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,680
some more employees.

871
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:21,160
So they've, uh, the QA testers for call of duty are now facing layoffs after being promised

872
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,520
raises back division.

873
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:30,520
So um, Raven software, uh, the contractors there were told that they would face layoffs

874
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,400
starting January 28th of next year.

875
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,580
Um, because apparently they are done QA testing the game.

876
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,580
It's good enough, I guess.

877
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,580
Right.

878
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,360
Um, this is disgusting.

879
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:48,500
Like, and you know, I, I'm sure there is a, you know, well, Rob, if you wanted to look

880
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,520
at this realistically, these layoffs were probably starting to be planned three months

881
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,800
ago before a lot of this started to come out and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

882
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:02,700
I don't give a fuck because this last year, it's too late off like 800 people.

883
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,440
It's disgusting.

884
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,020
Like I understand people get laid off from businesses that are not profitable sometimes,

885
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:12,380
but it's disgusting to watch the board take home the money that they do.

886
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:16,860
I understand Bobby Kotick cut his salary on paper, but we all know he's still making money.

887
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:20,700
It's disgusting that there's still profits going to the wrong places.

888
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:24,780
And these people, it's that that's the frustrating part.

889
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:29,620
You're watching these hardworking people, the people that most deserve money and don't

890
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:33,700
deserve any of this shit that everybody's throwing at ABK right now.

891
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,720
We were, we're trying to be that protective person, trying to dodge them from the arrows

892
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,460
and the gunfire that are going around on the internet.

893
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:44,920
These are the people we're trying to protect, the hard frontline workers and to see them

894
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:50,280
get laid off when Bobby Kotick keeps his job and the board keeps his job, it is fucking

895
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,920
frustrating.

896
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,160
So frustrating, like beyond the capacity for words.

897
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,240
Yeah, for sure.

898
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,240
Anyway.

899
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:06,920
Um, if that's all you have to say about that, I have another ABK related story, which this

900
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,680
is all I have to say.

901
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:13,140
This is all under that umbrella of we're still going to talk about the business and these

902
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:16,160
news types of things here on the show.

903
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:21,020
And this has to do with some of the fallout when it comes to the Game Awards.

904
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:26,360
So a question came up this week about how my Activision Blizzard be involved at the

905
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,480
2021 Game Awards.

906
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:34,480
And I don't know, there was a Washington Post article where they kind of interviewed Jeff

907
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:40,160
Keeley and this whole thing happened where, you know, there's, and then Kotaku kind of

908
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,160
did a hit piece.

909
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,360
Like, I don't, I don't know what else to call it.

910
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:49,220
They kind of did a hit piece where they were like, Jeff Keeley refuses to, uh, say that,

911
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:53,440
you know, he's not going to have Activision Blizzard involved with the show and all this

912
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,440
stuff.

913
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,240
And again, I think Jeff has a difficult line to walk here.

914
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,240
I really do.

915
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,300
Because again, there is a part of the Game Awards where we want to acknowledge the developers

916
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:08,780
and the people that work hard on the games, even when the antics of the publisher is what's

917
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,060
driving us bonkers.

918
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,060
And that's exactly what's happening here.

919
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,260
It's Activision that we're pissed off at, Bobby Kotick and all this stuff.

920
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:18,800
You know, the people that develop the games, that's not the people we're mad at.

921
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,700
And so I can understand where Jeff is trying to shift the conversation there.

922
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:25,400
Now, other people take issue with, well, look who's on the board.

923
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:30,180
You have the president of Activision who's on the board, which a board of advisors for

924
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:34,900
the Game Awards, which by the way, if y'all on social media before you click retweet would

925
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:38,980
do a little fucking research, sorry, cause this, this does annoy me.

926
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,980
It's not Bobby Kotick.

927
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,620
It's Robert Kosich or something like that.

928
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:47,860
It is a different individual who is the president of Activision.

929
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:51,060
I may be ignorant and I will be the first to say it.

930
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:56,700
I am not aware of this individual being connected to any of the sexual harassment bullshit and

931
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,220
all this stuff that's going on.

932
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:01,620
I, and I may just be unaware and I'm willing to own that.

933
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:05,260
If this individual is tied to that, then it, it sucks and all that.

934
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,400
And one could argue he is the president of Activision.

935
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,060
The onus should be on him to that extent.

936
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:12,100
I will agree with you on that.

937
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,020
Then maybe for that reason, there is no place for him on the board.

938
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:20,860
However, did you not fucking notice before you click that retweet button, Yves Gilman

939
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:27,260
is also on the board from Ubisoft and don't we have quite a few same problems going on

940
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:28,260
over there.

941
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,260
Yep.

942
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:33,660
It's a boys club is what it is.

943
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:41,140
To Jeff's credit, I do notice there are several women and other folks that are in that panel.

944
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:44,500
And it doesn't feel token to me, but I'm not on that board.

945
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,400
It does feel like there are more than one.

946
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,620
There are a few and so forth, but the most problematic of the guys are on it.

947
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:52,620
Oh sure.

948
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:53,620
Sure.

949
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,740
I'm not, I'm not going to excuse that.

950
00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:00,440
And SJ 100 Matt is kind of piping in saying all Jeff said was that he is still navigating

951
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,620
how to handle the issue and Kotaku spurred it into something different with its headline

952
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,620
and article.

953
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:09,660
And I agree that Kotaku really framed this in a negative way that a lot of people ran

954
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:10,660
with.

955
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:14,560
And I think, I don't think it was appropriate to be quite honest.

956
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:22,500
But I do understand to a point the industry needs to say something and Jeff is kind of

957
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,620
representing the industry this week.

958
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:28,580
But I hope you all are very aware the industry is saying something.

959
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:35,340
Did you not hear what Microsoft said, Nintendo said, Sony said, and now the governments of

960
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:40,620
several states are saying in regards to their investment, the pressure is mounting on Bobby

961
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:41,620
Kotick.

962
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:42,620
It will crack.

963
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:48,440
And if there's a miracle, we'll get one before the year's end, I hope, but we'll see.

964
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:54,920
But I do think that piece was a bit inappropriate on Kotaku's part, quite honestly.

965
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,880
There are elements of it I understand, and I even go so far as to agree with.

966
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:04,960
I think basically saying to him, because you have not clearly said no Activision Blizzard

967
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:10,820
at all in my show, you are endorsing all of this behavior, I think that was a shit position

968
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:11,820
to put him in.

969
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,180
I do.

970
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:17,240
Because I think Jeff is in it for the folks on the front lines as well.

971
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,860
And you see that in the types of stuff that he tries to acknowledge and sprinkles out

972
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:23,880
throughout his show and all that stuff.

973
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:29,480
Long story short, after that article came out, Jeff Keighley did write a series of tweets

974
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:35,220
that said Activision Blizzard will not be involved with the show outside of their nominations

975
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,720
and potential wins.

976
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,060
So if they win something, they still get to go on stage and accept the award.

977
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:49,180
But in my humble opinion, the gaming press, if Activision Blizzard should win an award,

978
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:54,820
will not hesitate to comment about these problematic issues with Bobby Kotek in the same breath

979
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,140
as the award.

980
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:00,220
Which is unfortunate for the developers, but is probably what should happen.

981
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:05,260
We need to be reminded that there are problems that still need fixing at Activision Blizzard.

982
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,420
It should totally be a big call out.

983
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:08,420
Absolutely.

984
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:09,420
So.

985
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:12,380
But I don't envy Jeff Keighley in this position.

986
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:16,340
He's like, can't we just celebrate game developers and games and all this stuff?

987
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,580
And you know, I kind of get it.

988
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:22,320
S.J.O. and Hunter Matt in chat says, it wasn't a good look, but Jeff is listening and has

989
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,420
a history of listening.

990
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:26,660
His statement later that night was the best he could do in that situation.

991
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:32,380
And Mike Deff says, I think the only two ABK games there are Call of Duty, and I'm pretty

992
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,740
sure it won't win.

993
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,180
I don't think it'll win either.

994
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,380
I don't think it will either.

995
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,180
So I don't think, I think this is all going to be for naught.

996
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,140
It's all of the polish that they're putting in.

997
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,140
Yeah.

998
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,140
Yeah.

999
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,780
Anyway, speaking of the game world, look, there is much more going on to the game awards

1000
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,820
than just this stuff.

1001
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,740
We're going to get some game reveals.

1002
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:49,800
Jeff has been teasing.

1003
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,320
There's one he's been working on for like two years.

1004
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,900
People are jumping to conclusions.

1005
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,660
It's a Breath of the Wild sequel reveal.

1006
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:03,120
I don't want to jump to that conclusion, but I understand why people are leaping there.

1007
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,780
And Jeff does have a history of working pretty well in Nintendo.

1008
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:09,620
So we might, we might see something pretty exciting there at the game awards.

1009
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,940
But regardless, we're going to see some exciting stuff there.

1010
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,380
It's pretty much winter E3 coming up this week.

1011
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:19,860
So I do want to say here at VOG Network, at least Bobby and myself and Jamie and Loki

1012
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:24,380
are welcome if they can make it certainly, we're going to be co-streaming the game awards

1013
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:27,520
Thursday night starting at 4.15 Pacific.

1014
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:32,100
It's going to be a long night because there's a pre-show at 4.30 Pacific, 7.30 Eastern.

1015
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:35,860
And then I think the awards themselves are at least two hours, maybe even three.

1016
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,360
So it's going to be a long night.

1017
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,860
Do we know how long the awards are Bobby?

1018
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:39,860
Are they three hours?

1019
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,620
I think it might be a long show.

1020
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:44,720
So we're going to be busy Thursday, but we will be co-streaming it here.

1021
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,620
So if you want to, and you know, we try to keep it positive and, and give our reactions

1022
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,980
and gasps to trailers and things like that.

1023
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:53,780
It'll be like watching it with friends in a pandemic safe way.

1024
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:58,900
So we'll be here to do that for you guys Thursday here at VOG Network, twitch.tv slash vog network.

1025
00:52:58,900 --> 00:52:59,900
Yeah.

1026
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:03,900
SJ 100 Matt says, I can see a few acceptance speeches be interesting.

1027
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,180
Me too.

1028
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:08,440
And I think that is going to be the interesting thing in all of this.

1029
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:13,380
It's going to be interesting to see a little bit of that Oscar political speech crossover

1030
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:14,380
to the game awards.

1031
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:17,940
They kind of, kind of, I don't even know if I would call it political, but just workers'

1032
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:18,940
rights.

1033
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:19,940
I think it kind of needs to.

1034
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:22,140
So it'd be very interesting to see what comes of that.

1035
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:23,940
So let's watch it together on Thursday.

1036
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:24,940
All right.

1037
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:28,660
Bobby says, wow, scheduled to go until eight o'clock Pacific.

1038
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:30,180
All right.

1039
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:33,560
That's longer than an episode of this show, but we'll do it three and a half hours on

1040
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,560
Thursday.

1041
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,560
Hope you'll join us.

1042
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,940
No Man's Sky trailers.

1043
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:38,940
Sign me up.

1044
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,500
I fucking love No Man's Sky.

1045
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:44,780
I fail to see the problem, Loki.

1046
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:48,800
Now if it's more Deathloop trailers, actually that game is pretty good from what I understand.

1047
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,980
So I need to, I need to stop harassing that.

1048
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,420
It may even win the game of the year.

1049
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:53,420
So we'll see.

1050
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:54,420
All right.

1051
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,420
Let's move on.

1052
00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:00,540
We have more news going on and I think this one we're going to throw over to Jamie.

1053
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:08,020
So it looks like PlayStation, there's going to be some plans from Sony to hopefully take

1054
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:12,420
over what's going on with Xbox Game Pass, at least give them some solid competition

1055
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,740
for it.

1056
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:18,480
The code name for this service is called Spartacus and it's going to let PlayStation owners pay

1057
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,420
a monthly fee for access to a catalog of modern and classic games.

1058
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:29,160
They apparently were said by people who were not authorized to speak to the press.

1059
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,740
So we have some NDA breakage possibly.

1060
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:41,800
They said that it's going to be available on PS4 and PS5 and quite possibly in the next

1061
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,800
few months.

1062
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,520
And they're also thinking about having a free monthly titles.

1063
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,880
This was actually stated by Bloomberg.

1064
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,260
So it's a pretty big service.

1065
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:55,460
So that's enough for me to give it some merit.

1066
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,460
Yeah.

1067
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:01,020
Jason, I forget his last name, Shear, I think it is with Bloomberg.

1068
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,780
Sorry if I mispronounced the last name.

1069
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:08,260
He's been on top of a lot of stuff lately with the ABK stuff, especially too.

1070
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:11,560
So his Twitter feed's been pretty fascinating follow lately.

1071
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:16,220
So I think when Bloomberg and he's stepping up to report this, I think this is one of

1072
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:19,020
those where there's smoke, there's fire type of things for sure.

1073
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:24,480
Not to say things can't change as I think happened with the Switch Pro.

1074
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,420
But I think it's definitely a smoke, there's fire.

1075
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:29,700
And of course, Sony has to compete with Game Pass, right?

1076
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:35,580
Like we kind of saw that whole like PlayStation 4, what is it, 20 games available on PS5 and

1077
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:36,580
all that.

1078
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,560
That was kind of like the first step in that.

1079
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:44,500
So I think this makes a lot of sense and marrying it to PlayStation Plus and making it all one

1080
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,500
pro.

1081
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:49,340
PlayStation now I don't think is having the type of numbers Sony probably wants.

1082
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:53,820
I think trying to put that all in one package, even if it's multi-tiered, which is a little

1083
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:56,940
weird, but I guess it's working for Nintendo.

1084
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:59,380
I think it has the potential to work out.

1085
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:03,980
I think a lot of people just want to know, is it going to be all cloud gaming or do I

1086
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:07,300
actually get to download PS2 and PS1 games and play them?

1087
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:10,460
It'll be interesting to see how that works out because I think there's still a lot

1088
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:13,300
of resistance to cloud gaming because of bandwidth caps.

1089
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,620
And believe me, I understand.

1090
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:19,620
But with PS1 games, I bet it's probably not going to be as bad as you think.

1091
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:23,760
Because like Antstream, when I was playing that, you know, that's all cloud gaming.

1092
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,620
It was like nothing on my bandwidth.

1093
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:26,620
It really wasn't.

1094
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:27,620
It was probably as much bandwidth.

1095
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,620
I mean the games themselves aren't that big anyways, so yeah, I can imagine that'd

1096
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,620
be pretty decent.

1097
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:32,620
We'll see.

1098
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,300
But well, but can the hardware run them?

1099
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:39,940
I would be shocked if a PlayStation 5 can't run PS1 and PS2 games.

1100
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:43,620
PS3, I get, gets a little dicey, it's a little newer, it was different, you know, but...

1101
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:45,020
He's gonna do that now though.

1102
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:46,020
I know.

1103
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,020
I don't know.

1104
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:48,020
I know.

1105
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:49,020
I have a hard time believing that.

1106
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:53,580
SD100Matt in chat says, I hate the idea of a tiered system as a consumer.

1107
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,220
Just give me a flat rate with everything.

1108
00:56:55,220 --> 00:57:00,120
I see that, but it'll be interesting to see what all they include.

1109
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:05,980
I think a point that the media has not been bringing up enough in regards to this story

1110
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:11,500
that I want to remind people of, Sony, and I've said this on the show before, and I think

1111
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:18,460
we've seen Sony do a little bit of this, Sony has arms and extensions of their company in

1112
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:22,620
other areas that could really sweeten this pot.

1113
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:26,380
You know, if they are gonna go to a three tiered program and that third tier has games

1114
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:33,660
and all that stuff too, why wouldn't that third tier have Crunchyroll, Sony movies,

1115
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:37,620
Sony music, and some of these other things as well?

1116
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:45,060
What if a high tiered pass was beyond just PlayStation and it was gaming and entertainment

1117
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,060
and whatever else too?

1118
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,060
I'm done with that.

1119
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:51,020
It's impossible to get any of the Sony movies on any streaming service aside from Voodoo

1120
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,100
and you have to rent that stuff, so no thanks.

1121
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:56,320
And that's why I think Sony should really be looking at that.

1122
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:02,700
If they're gonna talk a multi-tiered system, then go the, I guess the Apple all-in-one

1123
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:08,660
route where you can get Apple Fitness separately, you can get Apple TV separately and all that,

1124
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:11,180
but they also have that pass that has everything.

1125
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:12,180
That would be a smart route.

1126
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:15,540
I think that would be a smart model for Sony to copy, but that's just my opinion.

1127
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:16,540
We'll see what they do.

1128
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:17,540
So.

1129
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:20,700
Um, Dartasuya in chat says, oh, that's a good point, Rob.

1130
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:21,700
Thank you.

1131
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,680
I try my best on this program and please keep inflating my ego.

1132
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,220
It drives me to do this show more and more.

1133
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,220
Thank you for the reassurance.

1134
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:28,220
I appreciate that.

1135
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,220
All right.

1136
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:33,300
Watch my ego swell live on Twitch.

1137
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:38,180
I need to get a bigger hat and just keep switching hats throughout the show as Dartasuya and

1138
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:42,260
other kind chatters inflate my ego and I just switch into the bigger hats as the show goes

1139
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,260
on.

1140
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,260
All right.

1141
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,740
It'll look like the Kentucky Derby before we're done.

1142
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:47,740
All right.

1143
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,860
Moving on to our next story.

1144
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:50,860
Loki.

1145
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,860
It was kind of cool.

1146
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:55,620
They're doing this whole, uh, Winter Games Fest thing through Xbox.

1147
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:58,820
It's going to be a bunch of the independent developers at Xbox.

1148
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:02,780
Um, they're going to have like a bunch of game demos out.

1149
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:06,460
So they have a small list of the games that are out right now.

1150
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:09,860
Um, not a lot of these are recognized because they are independent games, but like Death

1151
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:15,480
Trash, Loot River, The Tale of Biston, Black Tail and Nobody Saves a World.

1152
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:20,300
And those are supposed to be available, um, from December 7th through the 21st.

1153
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:21,860
You can check out those demos.

1154
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:29,140
They're coming to the Xbox One series and, uh, I think also PC as well, but it's pretty

1155
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:35,020
cool to see some of these, um, kind of like almost like E3 style demos being put up at

1156
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:36,020
one time.

1157
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,020
I know they've done this in the past.

1158
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:38,020
It looks pretty cool.

1159
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,020
Yeah.

1160
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:40,020
I like that.

1161
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:41,020
We're kind of getting all this stuff in the winter time.

1162
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:44,180
Like, uh, you know, off cycle E3 type of thing.

1163
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,980
So yeah, I like that.

1164
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:47,980
Yeah.

1165
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:48,980
Uh, yeah.

1166
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:50,900
So I'm, I'm excited to check some of this stuff out.

1167
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:54,220
We know Xbox has their own cloud things set up too that I'm sure they can deliver some

1168
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:55,220
of this through.

1169
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:56,220
So it'd be interesting.

1170
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:57,220
Yeah.

1171
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:58,220
All right.

1172
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:04,020
Um, y'all know I play way too many AR games from Niantic, um, including Pokemon Go and

1173
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,020
Ingress.

1174
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:09,620
And I even tried that Harry Potter game for a hot minute, but it's going away anyway.

1175
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:14,380
But what could the future of Niantic look like besides, Oh, what Transformers and not

1176
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:17,460
Catan, but whatever else they, what else have they announced that they haven't come out

1177
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:18,460
with yet?

1178
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:19,460
There was another one.

1179
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,220
I don't remember the moment.

1180
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:22,220
Transformers was one.

1181
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:23,220
Yeah.

1182
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:24,220
Maybe it was Pikmin.

1183
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:25,820
And I just, I'm looping that in cause there was three games.

1184
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:26,820
Yeah.

1185
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:27,820
I think it's Pikmin.

1186
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:30,220
I was like trying to think if there's another one on top of Pikmin, but I'm sure there's

1187
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:31,220
more.

1188
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:34,300
Well, you've seen things like when they're advertising their own metaverse, right?

1189
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:39,500
Cause now, and this is like it or not, this is going to become more and more of a conversation

1190
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:43,080
in this decade because this is what everybody's kind of buying into, at least on the corporate

1191
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:48,240
level is this metaverse type of thing, which metaverse going to be the new blockchain thing.

1192
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,240
I hope not.

1193
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:53,960
You know, I don't know when Niantic talks about it, I get it.

1194
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:59,760
When Facebook talks about it, I'm guarded like that's, that's, that's, that's the reality

1195
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,020
of the situation.

1196
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:04,600
But there's, there's been conversation about how other tech companies are kind of going

1197
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:05,600
to this place too.

1198
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,820
But anyway, I don't want to just talk about meta, but I do want to talk about a very interesting

1199
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:11,500
purchase that Niantic made, made this week.

1200
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:16,040
And that is a gameplay recording app called low key.

1201
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:24,240
Not to be confused with a co-host here on orange lounge radio, this is L O W K E Y.

1202
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:32,560
So low key, um, so low key, the, uh, app that Niantic bought, uh, low key was designed with

1203
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:37,060
like casual games in mind or people that don't really want to sit there and edit their videos.

1204
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:41,680
What the app does, it captures videos on the computer and syncs them with the phone.

1205
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:46,360
And then on the phone, you can use very basic, simple editing tools to make short clips for

1206
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,760
mobile viewing.

1207
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,860
That's actually kind, I never knew about this app, but that is, I can actually see the place

1208
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:56,200
for that with people wanting to get on Instagram and TikTok and all like moving that from the

1209
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,560
computer to get on TikTok actually makes a lot of sense to me.

1210
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:02,680
So it sounds like that's the type of thing that low key is trying to do.

1211
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:06,620
Um, so, um, Niantic has purchased low key.

1212
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:11,160
Now they didn't say what low key is going to be involved with, but the quote leadership

1213
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:18,560
in the space will accelerate the social experiences Niantic is building in its products.

1214
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:24,760
We share a common vision for building community around shared experiences and enabling new

1215
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:27,960
ways to connect and play for our explorers.

1216
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:32,260
Let me tell you a true story in the Niantic world for a minute.

1217
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:37,060
So one of my really good friends, uh, one of my favorite people in my life, uh, John,

1218
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:42,160
my old roommate who may have cameoed on this show once or twice when we were at the house.

1219
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:47,300
Do y'all remember when we were on Justin TV, long time OLR people, and we were in that

1220
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:50,600
garage that would get really cold in the winter, but it was insulated.

1221
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,900
It's not super cold.

1222
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,820
And we had like the Christmas lights and actually looked like a studio in there.

1223
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:57,340
That was the house I lived out with John.

1224
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,460
John got super into Pokemon Go.

1225
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:04,300
Um, and I kept nagging him to try Ingress and eventually he finally cried.

1226
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:08,140
Like there was a slow period in Pokemon Go and he played Ingress and he fell in love

1227
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:10,140
with it and he really enjoyed it.

1228
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:13,380
And he's still playing it and he's actually even playing it today.

1229
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:20,860
And uh, he actually sent me a text today and he said, I hiked up Mount San Miguel just

1230
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:24,780
to farm keys for a potential, I guess I shouldn't be giving strategy away, oops.

1231
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:28,820
But he did a big hike today for reasons, wink nudge.

1232
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:32,400
And he actually, and this is going to be very hard to see on the Twitch feed, but you can

1233
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,840
all can see I've been sent a panoramic picture.

1234
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:41,040
He sent me a picture from the top of the mountain where this video game inspired him to go hike

1235
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,580
and go exploring at.

1236
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:44,020
That's awesome.

1237
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:48,900
And then he sent me another picture if I can see it here, hold on, cause I'm going to try

1238
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,180
to put this up onto it.

1239
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:56,160
Then he sent me a picture of his dirty pants that got covered in dirt from the walk.

1240
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:01,180
And I think my response was Ingress, Oh, the places you'll go and shoes you'll ruin in

1241
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:02,500
the process.

1242
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:05,520
So, but anyway, this is my point.

1243
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:09,540
So I didn't just tell you all that to read a cute text message exchange about Niantic.

1244
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:14,640
The key part in there was he sent me a picture from the top of this mountain that he probably

1245
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,680
wouldn't have gone to otherwise.

1246
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:23,260
And I bet you if John Henke, CEO of Niantic heard that story, he would smile and say,

1247
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:26,500
yes, exactly.

1248
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:30,060
And I think that is what this is.

1249
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:33,980
This is going to be because if Niantic is building themselves out as like real world

1250
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:38,540
exploration and they always push this stuff, like take pictures with your Pikmin interacting

1251
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:39,540
in the real world.

1252
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:42,980
But then when community day and stuff rolls around, they like to highlight here's photos

1253
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:47,900
of people gathering and playing and walking and being active and they love to push that

1254
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:48,900
stuff.

1255
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:53,180
I think they really want to take that to the next level with some of this like social sharing

1256
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,180
stuff.

1257
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:57,960
And whether it's, they're going to build it into the apps to like make you able to do

1258
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:02,240
TikTok videos more easily, or they want to build their own network or something.

1259
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:06,320
I'm not sure what's in the cards for that right now.

1260
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:15,560
But I think that is the direction and definitely Niantic's vision for all this stuff.

1261
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:19,400
Mere Muse in chat says, oh, the places you'll go and the mud you'll find.

1262
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,120
Yes, that is true.

1263
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:24,080
Mike Defton chat says, all according to plan.

1264
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:28,280
John Hanke, most look, most likely an accurate quote.

1265
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:32,980
Quest Buster in chat says Niantic jonesing for a piece of the metaverse pie.

1266
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:35,480
They've already said they are going.

1267
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:39,040
If you watch that whole thing about light ship, which we got into a couple of weeks

1268
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:42,860
ago on the show, they said they're going for the metaverse.

1269
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:46,840
It's just Niantic's metaverse is AR.

1270
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:50,640
And I think most of Facebook, because I'm not calling him by the name they want me to

1271
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,840
Facebook's universe, I think is mostly hinged in VR.

1272
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:57,320
But I think there are AR elements to it.

1273
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,060
I think Facebook kind of wants to do everything.

1274
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:01,200
But Niantic's made it very clear.

1275
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:05,520
And that's why I'm I'm kind of excited to see Niantic of all people competing with Facebook,

1276
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,320
because I know who I'm rooting for in that situation.

1277
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:14,780
S2100 Matt says, honestly, I'm shocked they haven't let folks buy clothes to customize

1278
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:18,720
all of their Pokemon and go, oh, wait, just you wait.

1279
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:23,320
Zen Monkey 11 says the goal is probably world domination, like always in a way.

1280
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:26,060
I mean, businesses do exist to make money.

1281
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:28,480
That's the society we live in.

1282
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,120
But Pokemon Go is an example.

1283
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,120
They're doing a pretty good job.

1284
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:34,320
I don't know how well Pikmin's doing, but I think it's doing all right.

1285
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:38,280
It seems to be high up in the download chart of, you know, I don't think the game has to

1286
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:42,560
be the runaway success that Pokemon Go was to be successful, but we'll see.

1287
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:46,400
So anyway, we'll see what develops of this low key purchase.

1288
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:51,480
Every time I hear Niantic getting into social, I'm so curious what they're developing on

1289
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:55,060
the back end, because I know they're starting to build this friends list and everything

1290
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:57,320
is coming together in that regard.

1291
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:01,520
By the way, before I toss it over to Jamie and her story, I did want to give one tiny

1292
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:05,000
update on Niantic's biggest game, Pokemon Go.

1293
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,120
If you were not already aware, they released a pretty major update on iOS.

1294
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:14,460
It didn't change anything about the game mechanics, but for a while now, Android has been running

1295
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:19,580
at 60 frames a second and the iPhone version, for whatever reason, I don't know, hasn't

1296
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:20,580
been.

1297
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:25,820
This new version, you can go into advanced settings and you can now unlock and run the

1298
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:27,480
game at higher frame rates.

1299
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:32,220
It's probably at the cost of battery, but I get pretty good battery out of my, you know,

1300
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:33,220
iPhone.

1301
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,220
I don't even know what iPhone I have.

1302
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:35,220
I think it's an 11.

1303
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:37,360
I still get pretty good battery life out of that.

1304
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,200
And I got to say, the game looks really good.

1305
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,500
Like when you have the unlocked frame rate, it's so smooth.

1306
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:42,500
It's butter.

1307
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:43,500
It's like butter.

1308
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:49,060
Um, and by the way, that feature is also on the Android version for not just 60 frames

1309
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:50,740
a second, but unlocked.

1310
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:52,580
So you can do that if you want.

1311
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:55,820
So anyway, uh, I think it's really, I think it looks really good.

1312
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:59,620
I don't know why it's in advanced settings, but again, my, my assumption is it's tied

1313
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:00,900
to battery life.

1314
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:06,040
Um, so yeah, as Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, I was going to ask how that new update

1315
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,040
looked for you, Rob.

1316
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,040
It looks good.

1317
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:12,460
Well, I mean, Alan has Android because we're, we're a bi-phonal household, uh, and, uh,

1318
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:15,780
Alan is, so I've seen the, the Pokemon at 60 frames a second.

1319
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:17,700
I was, I was like, oh, that does look really good.

1320
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:19,540
I wonder why they won't do all right.

1321
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:21,240
It took them time, but they finally got it over.

1322
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:23,180
So hooray.

1323
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:27,020
And Mike Def says, yeah, I've heard of people having their battery drain a lot quicker.

1324
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:31,740
So yeah, I would, I would say play in short bursts or don't turn that feature on or, you

1325
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:35,340
know, hook it up to a battery charger or whatever.

1326
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:36,340
All right.

1327
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:37,340
Sorry, Jamie.

1328
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:39,340
I just wanted to make sure that important update got out there.

1329
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:41,340
So what do you have for us?

1330
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:48,740
So, um, there has been another leak, um, because leaks, leaks are going to leak, right?

1331
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:51,900
Um, it's been linked, uh, linked, oh my gosh.

1332
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:52,900
I can make words happen.

1333
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:53,900
I promise.

1334
01:08:53,900 --> 01:09:03,260
Um, Bioshock force setting and it's time period, um, actually it was shared by a journalist

1335
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:10,260
named Colin Moriarty, um, who was saying that was going to take place in the 1960s in an

1336
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:12,780
Antarctic city.

1337
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:18,020
And um, it also has matched what other sources have said.

1338
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:21,940
So it could be very, very accurate.

1339
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:24,260
It's supposed to be in a city called Borealis.

1340
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:31,740
Um, the game's code name is Parkside and, uh, basically this, yeah, it's like I said,

1341
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:33,340
it's just matching up with what other people have said.

1342
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:37,540
So we can see if it's right or not when the game comes out.

1343
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:39,580
I'm glad to hear another Bioshock is on the way.

1344
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:43,820
Like I know, I know there's been rumblings, but it's been, it's been a long time since

1345
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:45,220
we've had a Bioshock game.

1346
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:49,060
Bioshock Infinite is pretty aged.

1347
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:52,500
I think Bioshock Infinite can almost be a classic game of the week at this point.

1348
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,780
Maybe it's not that that old, but it's, it's close.

1349
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:57,780
It was a PS3 game, right?

1350
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:58,780
Yes.

1351
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:03,820
So yeah, it's, uh, uh, S21 Hunter Matt says, feels like now's a good time for a Bioshock

1352
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:04,820
game.

1353
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:05,820
Yeah, I think so.

1354
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:09,100
Uh, Questbuster in chat says a city at the foot of the mountains of madness.

1355
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:11,140
I just want to know how they're going to out twist all the other games.

1356
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:12,140
It'd be exciting.

1357
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:14,820
I want to know where the mountains of madness are so I never go there.

1358
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:15,820
All right.

1359
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:22,220
Uh, just a few more stories and then we have the last flag here on orange lounge radio.

1360
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:25,580
If you don't know what I'm talking about, cause you were a newer listener, I'll explain

1361
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:26,860
in just a few more stories.

1362
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:28,420
Yeah, no, we'll explain.

1363
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:29,420
We'll explain to me.

1364
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:30,420
All right.

1365
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:31,420
Uh, but first Loki.

1366
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:32,420
So yeah.

1367
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:39,580
So, um, Fortnite's completed their chapter two and part of that did kind of leak out.

1368
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:46,100
So they did this big finale, um, with a, I guess, cameo of the rock.

1369
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:48,820
Um, I can't remember the character he was playing.

1370
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:50,300
He's leader of the seven, I guess.

1371
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:55,020
Um, and I always get that confused because the seven is the name of the superhero group

1372
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:57,980
and um, the boys.

1373
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:59,740
So that's also confusing.

1374
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:07,140
Um, but anyway, so he made a cameo in that and basically the whole island that you play

1375
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:13,380
on flipped upside down and that is basically opening it up for season three, which then

1376
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:17,300
the trailer leaf for that as well before to this whole event happened, but then they finally

1377
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:19,240
released the official trailer.

1378
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:25,180
So some of the new things coming to season or chapter three, um, is that they're going

1379
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:27,180
to have Spiderman in there as well.

1380
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:33,540
Um, you can do web slinging and they are going to have, uh, these, I guess, tents that you

1381
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:38,500
can get or basically can kind of store your cache of weapons that you get through the

1382
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:39,500
different games.

1383
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,700
And you'll be able to take that with you into other games.

1384
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,620
Um, what else?

1385
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:45,620
Oh, and sliding.

1386
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:48,880
They've added sliding as well, but it looks interesting.

1387
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,620
What about Kelly Clarkson?

1388
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:52,300
Can't they add Kelly Clarkson to the game?

1389
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:53,940
I mean, they probably could.

1390
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:58,700
They gave us Ariana Grande and like, what, why have you, have you seen all the videos

1391
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:02,080
of them duetting and stuff around the internet because of the voice and that stuff.

1392
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,500
If we have Ariana Grande, we need to have Kelly Clarkson.

1393
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:08,180
Like it's just, it's just Kelly Clarkson.

1394
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:11,140
Anybody can be in, in this game now.

1395
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:12,460
I mean, pretty much everything.

1396
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:13,460
Oh.

1397
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:16,540
And, uh, aside from experiment, they're also going to have the Gears worst characters in

1398
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:17,540
there as well.

1399
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:22,100
Uh, that was something else that was shown off in the trailer because why not?

1400
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,100
Yeah.

1401
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:24,100
Yeah.

1402
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,380
So it's, it's interesting.

1403
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:28,660
When are they going to rename the game pop culture orgy?

1404
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:32,100
Cause that's, that's what they're really going for with this and their, their own version

1405
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,220
of the metaverse, I suppose.

1406
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:35,220
Interesting.

1407
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:36,820
I don't know.

1408
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:37,820
All right.

1409
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:42,180
Well, going over to a, another story here that has to do with, I think, I think one

1410
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:46,300
of dark Sakura's favorite, um, gaming, uh, franchises, so I don't know why I'm talking

1411
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,300
about it, but that's all right.

1412
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:48,900
I'll get, I'll get Jamie's reaction to it.

1413
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,260
I did not know this.

1414
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:56,740
Apparently December 4th is dragon age for day because December and four D four.

1415
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,540
So December 4th is dragon age day.

1416
01:12:58,540 --> 01:12:59,540
That's a stretch.

1417
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:03,260
It's a stretch, but you know how like end seven, November 7th is mass effect day.

1418
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:06,660
I guess they've decided to December or December 4th is dragon age day.

1419
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:09,220
And we did get some updates on dragon age.

1420
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:13,660
No, we didn't get new trailer or anything like that, but there were some short stories.

1421
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:17,420
There was a story about gray wardens, which made me think of Jamie and her cosplay.

1422
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:21,660
And there was a one about necromancers that they put up and they also have said the following

1423
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:26,700
about dragon age for speaking of building new worlds and stories for you to explore.

1424
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:30,460
We want to let you all know that we're still hard at work on building the next single player

1425
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:32,740
focused experience for dragon age.

1426
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:36,420
We're excited for next year when we can talk more about what we're working on and what

1427
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:40,420
a lot of people are looking at in that statement is, Oh yay.

1428
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:41,740
Single player focused.

1429
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:44,140
They're not going to try to shove multiplayer into it.

1430
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:47,380
Like bio areas had to do with a lot of other games now.

1431
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:51,140
I don't know, like the multiplayer in mass effect three, I thought it was really underrated

1432
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:52,500
and super fun.

1433
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:56,740
I'm not sure I really liked it in dragon age inquisition and got kind of old.

1434
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:58,060
It was fun to do a couple of times.

1435
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:02,260
I don't know if Jamie, you felt any differently, but I, I, I kind of felt it got old and even

1436
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:03,260
bother.

1437
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:04,260
Yeah.

1438
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:07,420
So how do you feel when you hear that they're focusing on single player?

1439
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:08,420
Makes me excited.

1440
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:13,860
I'm like, why didn't they from the beginning, uh, pressure from EA would be the answer to

1441
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:14,860
that.

1442
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:15,900
However, here's something interesting.

1443
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:17,300
This is what rumors say.

1444
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:23,040
So read into this, what you will, but apparently dragon age four was going to be multiplayer

1445
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:32,460
focused like Anthem was headed in that direction, but then Anthem came out and flop arena'd.

1446
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:38,980
But not only that star Wars, Jedi fallen order, a single player experience game came out and

1447
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:40,660
did very well.

1448
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:44,460
So the rumor is EA backed off the multiplayer thing.

1449
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:49,660
And so Bioware is now focusing on single player, much to the rejoicing of many dragon age fans

1450
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:50,660
everywhere.

1451
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:52,300
So it was not rejoicing.

1452
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:53,300
Yay.

1453
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:58,020
Hey, look, I'm fine with dragon age, having a multiplayer thing, have it a separate game.

1454
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:02,660
This is this, they just have it a separate thing that comes out that I would, I would

1455
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:06,340
really, really, really love nothing more than a new mass effect multiplayer game to come

1456
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:08,960
out to like bridge bridges.

1457
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,380
Just do a multiplayer only game.

1458
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:15,100
I would be so into it if it was like, even, I didn't hate Andromeda's multiplayer.

1459
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:19,300
It wasn't as good as threes, but I liked it enough.

1460
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:20,520
I'd be into it.

1461
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:28,660
So anyway, I'm, I'm perfectly happy with, with just having there being some sort of

1462
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:30,500
separate thing if they were going to do it.

1463
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,340
I mean, that's just how I feel about it.

1464
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:33,340
Yeah, I agree.

1465
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:34,340
I agree.

1466
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:37,680
Uh, Zen monkey 11 and chat says they have a fucking day for everything now.

1467
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:38,780
Just call it every day day.

1468
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:39,780
Yeah.

1469
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:42,900
I think this one was a little bit of a stretch, but there you go.

1470
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:43,900
All right.

1471
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:48,060
Um, let's get to our last segment here that Jamie's going to introduce and something very

1472
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:49,380
special about tonight.

1473
01:15:49,380 --> 01:16:05,140
Uh, but first I'm going to roll this bumper and now it's time to travel back to a simpler

1474
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:10,540
time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1475
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:18,540
It's time for the classic game of the week, but here in the calendar year, 2021 dark soccer

1476
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:24,000
once a month picks a fucking weird arcade game to spotlight.

1477
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,100
And I think she's got one of the best of all here as the last pick.

1478
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:32,220
So once a month, the classic flag fucking weird arcade game of the month, dark soccer,

1479
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:33,220
what did you pick?

1480
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:36,060
I picked prop cycle.

1481
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:37,060
Of course.

1482
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:38,060
Nice.

1483
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:42,180
It's fucking weird, but it's great in the best way, in the best way.

1484
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,180
Oh, totally.

1485
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:44,180
No.

1486
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:45,180
Prop cycle is great.

1487
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:51,420
Um, prop cycle came out when I was working at a Namco arcade and I have a lot of fond

1488
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:53,060
memories of it.

1489
01:16:53,060 --> 01:17:00,300
So in a nutshell, what this is, it is a 3d game with a focus on flying except you're

1490
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:05,220
not flying a plane or a jet or even a hoverboard.

1491
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:07,700
You are on a bicycle with wings.

1492
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:09,980
Well, in the game it has wings.

1493
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:19,540
So basically what you're doing is you are on this bike and you are doing your thing.

1494
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:25,500
You're moving along and you have to pop these bubbles and go through a balloon, sorry, and

1495
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,540
go through these wings and everything.

1496
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:33,100
You're in this world that's like post this huge war.

1497
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:40,500
It was this hyperspace magnetic thing called the Tesla bomb was used in war and it destroyed

1498
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:47,860
everything and it changed the world's terrain and then technology is now fueled by natural

1499
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:48,860
resources.

1500
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:54,180
This game has like this whole like backstory and shit to it that's honestly pretty crazy.

1501
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:57,460
I had no idea this game had a story.

1502
01:17:57,460 --> 01:17:58,460
Right?

1503
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:08,540
But you're going around on this flying thing called the laparopter.

1504
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:15,340
And so this one town, someone like did this thing with another thing.

1505
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:20,500
I know it's like, how did this happen?

1506
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:28,220
And it ended up that you have to go in and find these energy balls and save the world

1507
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:31,460
again against this event from happening.

1508
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:36,220
And so that's where you are with it.

1509
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:41,980
You're having to go through and save the world by popping balloons.

1510
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:53,060
And the prop cycle itself has, it really was considered to be one of the more original

1511
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:54,060
things that came out.

1512
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:56,700
A lot of people went, fuck is this?

1513
01:18:56,700 --> 01:19:01,340
And part of the development team, it was also, I mean, they went out hand gliding to develop

1514
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:05,860
the mechanics of the game.

1515
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:13,180
And they were also inspired by part of Kiki's delivery service with the flying on the balloon.

1516
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:17,620
And they want to convey the sense of writing on the wind.

1517
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:23,420
So they have like a fan that blows on some of this.

1518
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:25,600
I don't know if they had it in all of them.

1519
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,820
Every single one that I have played has had it.

1520
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:28,820
Really?

1521
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:29,820
Hmm.

1522
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:33,500
But they might've had some without.

1523
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:43,460
And they did actually add some different things in the plot to make it more appealing to people.

1524
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:47,780
And they were going to put a sightseeing mode in the game where you could just fly wherever

1525
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:51,500
you want, where you had a time limit, you could just fly around, but they scrapped that

1526
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,280
from there.

1527
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:59,620
It was considered the second most popular arcade game of August, 1996 in Japan.

1528
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:04,580
And certainly one of the most unique games that came out at that time.

1529
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:09,660
Now, the prop cycle has also played a part in pinball.

1530
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:12,020
Yes, in pinball.

1531
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:17,460
And I'm sure people who know and have seen this know exactly what the hell I'm talking

1532
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:18,460
about.

1533
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:23,580
Yes, I am talking about Prop Cycle Adam's family.

1534
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:29,140
Prop Cycle has been hooked up.

1535
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:37,540
The cycle itself has been hooked up to an Adam's family pinball.

1536
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:42,020
And you play pinball while riding the prop cycle.

1537
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:49,940
And the prop cycle fuels the power of the machines that you can keep playing.

1538
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:53,060
Of course, trying not to tilt on that sucker is hard as fuck.

1539
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:54,900
But I digress.

1540
01:20:54,900 --> 01:21:00,260
It actually is, I would say, pretty, pretty fun.

1541
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:05,060
Pretty fun to play and, you know, one of those very interesting things.

1542
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:18,860
I think that it's, what I'm thinking for it, it's one of those things that you would have

1543
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:24,820
to see to believe and play even more to go, excuse me, what.

1544
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:27,020
It sounds, excuse me, what, already.

1545
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:31,660
Well, I mean, it is already what, but it's even more what.

1546
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:34,980
It's pretty interesting.

1547
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:39,740
And there's people who have these machines in their home, there's, I mean, I know that

1548
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:44,580
the people have done some homebrew stuff, I couldn't find any, but it really is just,

1549
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:49,660
you know, neat and whimsical.

1550
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:54,340
And it was a workout, trust me, when I was playing this, it was like, it was my workout.

1551
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:58,700
It was my exercise bike when I worked at my arcade.

1552
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:01,220
And the music is great.

1553
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:06,940
You know, it still is a game that holds up today as far as I think.

1554
01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:08,260
So there you go.

1555
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:09,260
Prop cycle.

1556
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:10,260
Hurray.

1557
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:11,860
Love this game.

1558
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:17,220
I'm sorry, I may have missed this, but was there ever a home version of this?

1559
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:18,940
Did they try?

1560
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:21,660
I do not see that there was a home version.

1561
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:23,820
Um, nope.

1562
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:27,340
I mean, it would be hard because you can't exactly hook up an exercise bike and play

1563
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:30,860
it or anything like that, but you would have, like, this is a game I would have totally

1564
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:31,860
seen on the Dreamcast.

1565
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:33,540
You know what I mean?

1566
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:34,540
It did not.

1567
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:36,780
It did not have one.

1568
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:40,220
On top of that, though, by the way, since I didn't mention it, it was on the M.C.O.'s

1569
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:44,100
Super System 22.

1570
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:49,080
And other games that were out on this, because this will definitely put it in the time frame,

1571
01:22:49,080 --> 01:23:00,340
we had Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer 2, Rave Racer, Time Crisis, Alpine Racer series, Aqua Jet.

1572
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:01,340
What else was there?

1573
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:04,060
Yeah, I said Alpine Racer, didn't I?

1574
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:05,060
Yeah.

1575
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:07,140
So that era of games.

1576
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:10,460
That's great.

1577
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:11,460
And that's it.

1578
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:12,460
All right.

1579
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:13,460
Mm hmm.

1580
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:14,460
So there it is.

1581
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:15,460
The last flag.

1582
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:20,500
And I don't have the wiki in front of me, I guess I should pull that up so we can recap

1583
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:21,500
for the year.

1584
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:25,260
But that is going to be the last fucking weird arcade game.

1585
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:27,460
I can get the wiki up.

1586
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:28,460
I'm working on it, too.

1587
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:29,460
So it'll be a race.

1588
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:30,460
I've got it up right now.

1589
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:31,460
Okay.

1590
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:35,020
So to recap for us, please, the 12 flags of 2021.

1591
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:47,740
Boonga Boonga, Tsukomi Yosei Gip's Nice Tsukomi, Ino no Osanpo, Cho Chabudai Gaishi, The Last

1592
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:58,260
Bar Fighter, Stinky Feet, Sonic Blast Man, Final Furlong, Sega Toilet, The Typing of

1593
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:01,100
the Dead, and now Prop Cycle.

1594
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:02,100
There it is.

1595
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:03,100
That was a good collection.

1596
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:04,100
Congratulations.

1597
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:05,180
Congratulations.

1598
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:10,940
Now I need people to message me to suggest what I'm going to be, what the crap I'm doing

1599
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:13,780
next month, because I have not next month, but next year, because I have no freaking

1600
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:14,780
idea.

1601
01:24:14,780 --> 01:24:15,780
All right.

1602
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:21,620
So send you send your suggestions for the 2022 twist at Dark Sakura on Twitter.

1603
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:23,420
Jamie's been doing this for a few years now, right?

1604
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:26,020
Like the first year was what was it?

1605
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,020
Peripherals.

1606
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:28,020
I think it was the first year.

1607
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:29,020
Right.

1608
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:30,020
Because of the DDR mat and stuff.

1609
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:31,020
You forced.

1610
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:32,020
Actually, no, it was not.

1611
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:33,020
It was system.

1612
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:38,940
It was the console of that was it system peripherals and peripherals and then a classic

1613
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:39,940
eight soundtrack.

1614
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:40,940
Okay.

1615
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:41,940
And then classic pinball.

1616
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:42,940
Oh, yeah.

1617
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:45,940
And then the flag.

1618
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:46,940
Wow.

1619
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:49,900
So this was the fifth year of a twist.

1620
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:51,180
What a twist.

1621
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:52,180
We need more twisties.

1622
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:53,180
I know.

1623
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:55,180
Pretty sure the twist will need twists.

1624
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:56,460
All right.

1625
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:57,780
Um, love that.

1626
01:24:57,780 --> 01:24:58,780
All right.

1627
01:24:58,780 --> 01:24:59,780
But not chameleon twist.

1628
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:00,780
All right.

1629
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:04,300
But don't worry if you're if you don't like twists.

1630
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:08,180
The other weeks out of the month, three or four, depending on how many shows we have

1631
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:13,100
and how long the month is, end up being good old fashioned classic games and more and more

1632
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:17,980
classic games become eligible every day, because really the only rule is that it should be

1633
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:18,980
a game.

1634
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:22,200
I guess there's been a rare exception to this, but for the most part, it needs to be a game

1635
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:25,740
10 years older or more to be eligible for the classic game.

1636
01:25:25,740 --> 01:25:30,160
And way too many times on this show, we have ended up talking about games that we covered

1637
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:34,120
when they were new.

1638
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:35,280
Now they're having games.

1639
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:36,280
I know.

1640
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:37,280
I know.

1641
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,280
But 10 years is a long time.

1642
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:39,800
All right.

1643
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:43,300
Let's travel around the world quickly and check out some other news happening in gaming

1644
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:44,600
with some rapid fire news.

1645
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:47,840
And I think we're going to start with Loki.

1646
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:48,840
Yep.

1647
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:54,280
Um, so we've got some wonderful stuff coming out.

1648
01:25:54,280 --> 01:26:00,760
Starting with, uh, the battlefield 2042 players being mad at, well, EA.

1649
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:05,080
And the reason for that is because they put out some Santa skins.

1650
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:10,960
So the reason why they're mad is because typically this kind of goofy stuff is more along the

1651
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:17,800
lines of what Call of Duty does and, you know, battlefield 2042, which was a hot mess as

1652
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:23,860
it was when it came out is now selling these ridiculous Santa skins in their sort of realistic

1653
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:29,260
somewhat realistic, you know, military shooter game.

1654
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:32,500
And so people just threw a big old fit about it.

1655
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:37,800
And I mean, they had like all sorts of like Fanta skins for their tanks and the helicopters

1656
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:39,880
and stuff like that.

1657
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:45,200
But because of the backlash, they decided to go ahead and pull those skins.

1658
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:51,300
So they're not going to be selling them after all, uh, people.

1659
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:52,300
It's a war on Christmas.

1660
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:54,140
No, I don't think it's a war on Christmas.

1661
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:57,340
It's more of just that, like this game is a buggy mess.

1662
01:26:57,340 --> 01:26:59,100
No, it's a Christmas on war.

1663
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:00,100
Absolutely.

1664
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:01,100
I'm playable.

1665
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:07,140
And you're pushing, you're pushing DLC or like in-game purchases for this game that

1666
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:09,140
it's not worth the money as it is.

1667
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:13,100
So that I think is that the fact that it's just stupid.

1668
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:16,540
I was making, making a joke though, I get it.

1669
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:19,020
I think, I think we need to check in everybody.

1670
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:26,860
Could somebody visit the website gamershateeverything.com and let me know, do gamers still hate everything?

1671
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:29,420
Could someone visit the website and let me know?

1672
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:32,020
I hate everything and I'm a gamer.

1673
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:39,020
And then, um, so PlayStation Plus, we've got stuff coming out here for, um, I guess starting

1674
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:40,400
in December.

1675
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:47,700
So they've got Lego DC Super-Villains on PlayStation 4, Mortal Shell on PlayStation 4 and Godfall

1676
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:53,460
Challenger Edition on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 is like your PlayStation 5 game.

1677
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:58,900
The reason why people are upset about this is because Godfall Challenger Edition is basically

1678
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:06,900
just three end game level modes called Lightbringer, Dreamstones and Ascending Tower of Trials.

1679
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:14,020
Um, apparently it's like a glorified demo to the game, but you can pay to upgrade it

1680
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:15,580
to the full game if you want.

1681
01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:20,100
So now, now they're just saying, you know, instead of the free PlayStation 5 game, it's,

1682
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:21,260
oh, yeah, free demo.

1683
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:28,540
Cool, looking forward to that brand new PlayStation Games Pass service.

1684
01:28:28,540 --> 01:28:32,620
And on this story, this is one of the things where, yes, gamers still hate everything and

1685
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:33,780
I'm right there with them.

1686
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:36,300
This is, this is a stupid sale.

1687
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:37,140
It's fine.

1688
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:40,020
Like even if I had a PlayStation 5, I wouldn't want to play Godfall anyways.

1689
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:43,460
It doesn't look like a very good game and I don't think the reviews were too kind to it.

1690
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:45,780
So whatever.

1691
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:49,460
There's a lot of games that come out on these services that are not great.

1692
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:52,740
I mean, it is what it is, but yeah, the Godfall.

1693
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:58,500
Why not just, I think that's the point is that the entire retail game was nothing that

1694
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:01,780
great if the critics are to be taken at face value.

1695
01:29:01,780 --> 01:29:04,580
So why, why not just give us the fucking game?

1696
01:29:04,580 --> 01:29:08,580
Like, don't give us this like bullshit extended trial or whatever it is.

1697
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:09,860
Give us the whole game.

1698
01:29:09,860 --> 01:29:12,260
God, Dark Soccer.

1699
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:12,980
What do you have?

1700
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:13,940
Maybe some better news?

1701
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:15,860
Um, maybe.

1702
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:22,580
Um, so the next, uh, thing that's going to be on Nintendo 64 for Switch Online coming

1703
01:29:22,580 --> 01:29:26,740
out on December 10th is, uh, Paper Mario.

1704
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:31,220
And it's going to be on there with their, uh, online expansion pack.

1705
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:35,380
And, uh, it'll be really, really fun.

1706
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:37,140
Paper Mario was a really good one.

1707
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:44,340
Um, but, uh, we also know what else is coming as Banjo-Kazooie, F-Zero X, Kirby 64, Mario

1708
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:47,300
Golf, Pokemon Snap, and Majora's Mask.

1709
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:50,020
So yay.

1710
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:52,420
I'm glad that, uh, I've got the upgrade.

1711
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:56,020
And glad they're going nice and slow and adding those games.

1712
01:29:57,540 --> 01:29:59,220
Well, but they're adding quality.

1713
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:05,940
And then, um, then there's a new, uh, crossover going on for, uh, Virtua Fighter,

1714
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:07,220
Five Ultimate Showdown.

1715
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:11,140
We are going to have, um, Yakuza characters in Virtua Fighter.

1716
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:15,620
And I still don't care for Virtua Fighter, but Yakuza characters are going to be pretty fun.

1717
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:17,380
So cool.

1718
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:19,000
Yep.

1719
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:20,980
I think it's a fun crossover.

1720
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:22,420
Indeed it is.

1721
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:26,660
Dark Tetsuya in chat about the Paper Mario on Switch Online says,

1722
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:28,980
sadly, I think that's it for NSO in December.

1723
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:35,380
As far as I know, you mean Nintendo abandoned the non-expansion pack stuff already?

1724
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:37,060
LeGasp.

1725
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:41,460
I mean, color me shocked people.

1726
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:43,220
I'm so surprised.

1727
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:45,220
Look at my surprise face.

1728
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:45,720
Exactly.

1729
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:47,000
All right.

1730
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:48,820
Let's travel around the world.

1731
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:50,500
Do you have to hate everything?

1732
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:51,060
Yes.

1733
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:51,700
Do you have to?

1734
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:54,980
Did you go to the website gamershateeverything.com?

1735
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:56,580
It says right there.

1736
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:57,140
Yes.

1737
01:30:57,140 --> 01:30:58,420
You have to let it linger.

1738
01:30:58,420 --> 01:31:01,060
And it even says it in Comic Sans just for you.

1739
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:01,560
All right.

1740
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:02,840
Rob.

1741
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:04,180
What?

1742
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:04,740
Do you have to?

1743
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:08,180
Um, let's move on.

1744
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:10,660
We're going to travel around the world and check out some release dates,

1745
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:15,700
some things that, um, are coming out, um, that you can buy new games instead of emulated ones.

1746
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:21,060
So let's get, can you guys hear Mr. Smoosh playing with his new toy before we get to this?

1747
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:21,860
Okay.

1748
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:22,660
Thank God.

1749
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:26,980
Because although I'm not, I don't hear him through our microphone, but yeah.

1750
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:27,300
Okay.

1751
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:32,740
So Alan bought him a new toy at the Bougie pet store that we have to get his food at.

1752
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:35,940
Cause our, our cat won't settle for meow mix.

1753
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:37,700
He has to have the nicest stuff.

1754
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:41,220
So Alan decided to get him a new toy and it's a little squeaky toy.

1755
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:44,420
So it's a little mouse that you chase around and go squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak.

1756
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:45,620
Well, that's great.

1757
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:47,940
Except like, it'll be like dead silence.

1758
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:49,780
Like I'm sitting there on the computer.

1759
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:52,180
Alan has his headphones on the room's completely silent.

1760
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:55,060
And then from the hallway, I just hear squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak.

1761
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:57,140
It's like this little squeaky mouse going off.

1762
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:58,420
And now I'm hearing it during the show.

1763
01:31:58,420 --> 01:31:59,860
He's over there playing with it, which is fine.

1764
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:01,220
I want Mr. Smoosh to be entertained.

1765
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:03,060
I think it's funny, but yeah.

1766
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:05,460
Anyway, I just don't want to come through on air.

1767
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:06,420
Cause it sounds a little weird.

1768
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:07,380
All right.

1769
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:09,380
Let's get to release dates.

1770
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:11,060
We'll start with the U S Loki.

1771
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:12,100
Yes.

1772
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:15,300
So we have Final Fantasy 14 and Walker coming out on PC,

1773
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:17,220
Mac PlayStation, PlayStation five.

1774
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:23,860
Spell force three reinforced on PC.

1775
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:28,660
Halo infinite on PC, Xbox one and Xbox series X.

1776
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:34,260
Uh, loop hero on Nintendo switch, uh, monster hunt or I'm sorry.

1777
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:36,660
Monster rancher one and two deep Lux.

1778
01:32:37,540 --> 01:32:40,420
Uh, that's on PC, Nintendo switch and iOS.

1779
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:41,700
And that's it.

1780
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:43,460
All right.

1781
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:46,820
Let's travel to Japan and check out the releases over there.

1782
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:51,780
Um, on the Nintendo switch this week, we have Valise.

1783
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:55,300
The Phantasm soldier collection is out on December the ninth.

1784
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:57,540
Monster rancher one and two DX.

1785
01:32:57,540 --> 01:33:01,700
It's a 25th anniversary box limited edition also out in Japan this week.

1786
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:04,420
Uh, and, uh, let's see fit boxing too.

1787
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:06,820
Uh, that comes with a special joy con attachment.

1788
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:08,180
I guess it's a boxing thing.

1789
01:33:08,180 --> 01:33:09,380
Uh, also out this week.

1790
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:13,300
YouTubers life too is actually getting released in Japan.

1791
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:15,860
I watched a friend of mine play this on Twitch a little bit.

1792
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:17,540
Uh, it looks really silly.

1793
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:17,780
Yeah.

1794
01:33:17,780 --> 01:33:20,420
It's I, but it does say it is an English.

1795
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:24,180
It doesn't look like they've done anything to localize it for Japan,

1796
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:26,740
but it is being released, uh, physically on the switch over there.

1797
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:28,180
So I thought that was interesting.

1798
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:33,300
Um, Alba a wildlife adventure also on Japan, uh, Sakuna of rice and ruin.

1799
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:35,380
That game came out, uh, about a year ago, I think,

1800
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:36,980
but it is now getting a price reduction.

1801
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:41,060
So it re-released with that as it moves into best price collection,

1802
01:33:41,060 --> 01:33:42,900
uh, on the switch this week in Japan.

1803
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:48,020
Monopoly and monopoly madness also out in Japan this week.

1804
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:51,780
Um, that's a lot of releases for switch, but that's what we've got.

1805
01:33:51,780 --> 01:33:56,100
Let me peek at the PlayStation five real quick to see if anything is out there.

1806
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:58,420
Um, dying light to stay human.

1807
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:00,420
That is out on PlayStation five this week.

1808
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:03,380
So I guess that's kind of a worldwide thing this week.

1809
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:06,100
And then quickly peeking at the PlayStation four.

1810
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:10,980
Um, we have, uh, some of the same stuff like YouTubers life too,

1811
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:12,740
is actually also out on PS four.

1812
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:18,020
Uh, the crisis remastered trilogy is also out this week on PS four,

1813
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:21,380
uh, that same Sakuna of rice and ruin also on PlayStation four.

1814
01:34:21,380 --> 01:34:24,820
Monopoly plus monopoly madness, all that good stuff also there as well.

1815
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:29,860
And, um, street fighter five championship edition, all character pack.

1816
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:33,620
So if you want to have the Uber version of that, that is getting

1817
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:36,340
a type of retail re-release in Japan this week.

1818
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:37,620
How about the UK dark Sakura?

1819
01:34:38,660 --> 01:34:41,460
In the UK, we have actually just come out.

1820
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:42,420
We have never song.

1821
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:48,580
We have on the seventh gear club, uh, unlimited to ultimate addition.

1822
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:53,140
We have on the seventh as well, gang beasts for switch.

1823
01:34:53,940 --> 01:35:00,260
Um, beyond a steel sky steel book edition on the eighth, we have halo infinite, um,

1824
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:05,220
on the ninth monopoly madness on the 10th, the eternal cylinder for Xbox.

1825
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:06,580
And that's it for the week.

1826
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:08,040
All right.

1827
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:09,060
Sure.

1828
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:12,340
The year's going to wind down pretty soon here with the releases.

1829
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:16,740
Um, but then it'll pick right back up, uh, early next year, uh, with, uh,

1830
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:19,300
all the stuff they've got to get out before the end of the financial year.

1831
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:20,420
All right.

1832
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:21,140
For sure.

1833
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:22,500
Just a few more stories for you guys.

1834
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:25,700
And then we'll open it up to emails and your calls maybe.

1835
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:29,060
And all that good stuff, uh, with our listener round table, but first,

1836
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:31,220
Oh, I'm sure Loki had to talk about this.

1837
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:32,260
This is too funny, right?

1838
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:32,660
Loki.

1839
01:35:33,220 --> 01:35:33,620
Yeah.

1840
01:35:33,620 --> 01:35:38,500
So all these convenient glitches and bugs that we have in some of the new

1841
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:42,420
Nintendo games are yes, it's hilarious.

1842
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:49,620
So we've got an animal crossing, uh, new horizons, uh, DLC issue.

1843
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:55,300
So the happy home paradise DLC is causing some of the characters

1844
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:56,660
clothes not to appear.

1845
01:35:56,660 --> 01:36:01,780
So they're walking around naked in the game, or at least without clothes.

1846
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:04,580
Um, Hey, you know what?

1847
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:05,620
They just want to be free.

1848
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:08,900
They just want to, they just want to live the way they came into the world.

1849
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:09,400
Come on.

1850
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:12,740
There's going to probably be doing some updates to fix that.

1851
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:16,820
So, um, Nintendo, you think, I think.

1852
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:21,380
And then apparently, uh, Brit Pokemon, brilliant diamond and shining Pearl.

1853
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:23,460
They have a glitch to one year.

1854
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:26,180
Um, what was it you're doing?

1855
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:30,020
Like the surf technique or something like that on the water that it makes it

1856
01:36:30,020 --> 01:36:33,140
look like that the Pokemon are mounting each other.

1857
01:36:33,140 --> 01:36:38,420
So that's something else that's probably going to have to be patched as well.

1858
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:40,200
Wow.

1859
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:41,560
Yeah.

1860
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:43,300
Only Nintendo.

1861
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:47,300
They can't be bothered to put new stuff on Nintendo switch online for the, uh,

1862
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:50,740
lower tier users, but they're going to make catch up, put some goddamn

1863
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:52,100
clothes on, on that Island.

1864
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:53,140
That's for sure.

1865
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:58,020
They know sex sells, you know, got to entice the new players.

1866
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:00,840
All right.

1867
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:05,700
Well, actually a series that, uh, we've talked about a lot that is on the switch,

1868
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:08,820
uh, is expanding, uh, to new platforms this week.

1869
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:14,420
Uh, ACA or the arcade archives has some releases that are coming out on iOS and

1870
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:15,220
Android.

1871
01:37:15,220 --> 01:37:20,260
This is notable because this is AKA Neo Geo specifically, and this is its first

1872
01:37:20,260 --> 01:37:21,140
foray than I think.

1873
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:25,780
I think arcade archives may already be on, um, uh, iOS, Android, but Neo Geo,

1874
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:28,660
uh, this is the first releases that we're seeing on mobiles.

1875
01:37:28,660 --> 01:37:33,940
So we have alpha mission two metal slug five and samurai showdown four.

1876
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:35,460
I'm acoustic revenge.

1877
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:39,620
So if any of those are titles that you, uh, recall from the Neo Geo days or just

1878
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:45,300
things you want to check out, they are available on iOS and Android for 3 99.

1879
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:46,500
So four bucks.

1880
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:51,940
Um, this series was previously only PlayStation four, Xbox one, windows 10 and

1881
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:52,740
switch.

1882
01:37:52,740 --> 01:37:55,300
Um, so they are apparently now available.

1883
01:37:55,300 --> 01:37:57,460
So you can check that out if you want.

1884
01:37:57,460 --> 01:38:00,100
Um, which I know metal slug and samurai showdown.

1885
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:01,940
I don't remember alpha mission two.

1886
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:05,380
Probably if I watched it in motion, I I'd remember it.

1887
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:08,500
These are some later Neo Geo games.

1888
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:09,140
So it's interesting.

1889
01:38:09,140 --> 01:38:11,060
They're kind of starting here, but that's pretty cool.

1890
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:15,380
Uh, you can do a virtual pad customization, uh, and all this stuff.

1891
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:19,620
They have online rankings and button settings and yeah, all that good stuff.

1892
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:25,780
So fun to see that, uh, come out to the phones be very interesting if they do get

1893
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:30,900
into a console archives place later, as was that rumor, uh, a few weeks ago that

1894
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:32,580
we talked about here on the show.

1895
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:33,940
I would love to see them get into that.

1896
01:38:33,940 --> 01:38:34,580
That's for sure.

1897
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:36,180
Um, Dar Sakura.

1898
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:43,460
So, um, we have a release of Shin Megami Tensei five.

1899
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:44,660
It is out.

1900
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:49,460
There is an update, um, that has camera angles and brightness adjustment

1901
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:50,500
available to it.

1902
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:54,180
Um, it also helps you adjust the field of view.

1903
01:38:54,980 --> 01:39:02,100
You, uh, can, uh, change, uh, uh, you actually reduces the number of gimmicks

1904
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:04,660
for jumps after the lay line in a certain area.

1905
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:06,820
They just basically did some general bug fixes.

1906
01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:13,140
And, uh, really the, the depth of view on there is actually pretty intense.

1907
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:17,140
Looking at some of these, uh, differences as are the brightness effects.

1908
01:39:17,140 --> 01:39:18,260
It's actually really cool.

1909
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:19,540
So there you go.

1910
01:39:19,540 --> 01:39:20,500
You can go ahead and get it.

1911
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:21,700
Yep.

1912
01:39:21,780 --> 01:39:25,300
I have some friends that have been playing the game and, and, uh, really enjoying it.

1913
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:29,460
So it's one of those series that, you know, if I had more time, I'd make,

1914
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:32,980
but these games are like a long time to beat if I'm not mistaken.

1915
01:39:32,980 --> 01:39:34,580
So it's just one of those games.

1916
01:39:34,580 --> 01:39:38,420
I just haven't gotten around to yet, but someday, someday, uh, Loki.

1917
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:40,420
All right.

1918
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:47,140
Um, so let's talk about, I, I really hate take two sometimes.

1919
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:54,260
Um, but so take two is now coming after, um, the publisher of the game.

1920
01:39:54,260 --> 01:39:58,340
It takes two, which was that kind of, uh, I don't know.

1921
01:39:58,340 --> 01:40:02,820
It was like sort of a cute, like co-op puzzle game that they had.

1922
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:08,580
Um, and I think this came out a while ago, but now they're just coming after him because,

1923
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:13,300
you know, the name, the trademark for the name sounds too close.

1924
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:19,700
Um, apparently though, uh, yeah, I don't know.

1925
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:24,580
I think the haze light said that it can't comment on ongoing disputes,

1926
01:40:24,580 --> 01:40:26,500
but hopefully that it will be resolved.

1927
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:28,340
I hope they drop this.

1928
01:40:28,340 --> 01:40:29,140
This is ridiculous.

1929
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:32,500
I get it that you have to protect your trademarks and stuff like that, but there's

1930
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:36,980
no confusion between take two, the publisher and it takes two.

1931
01:40:36,980 --> 01:40:41,220
This is, this is definitely an overreach and is definitely just, uh, somebody being a little

1932
01:40:41,220 --> 01:40:45,060
bit too trigger happy about the whole, if you don't defend your trademark, you lose

1933
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:45,780
it type of thing.

1934
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:49,540
So, um, very silly, very, very silly.

1935
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:52,100
Um, and hopefully they settle it quickly.

1936
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:57,060
So, um, S2100 Matt says, I really hope take two wins just out of spite.

1937
01:40:57,060 --> 01:40:58,020
Why would you say that?

1938
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:02,580
Or are you just, are you making a joke because they're both named take two?

1939
01:41:02,580 --> 01:41:03,060
I don't know.

1940
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:05,860
I don't want to take two to win.

1941
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:07,060
I want it takes two to win.

1942
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:12,820
Um, yeah, it takes two should win and then they lose their trademark for take two.

1943
01:41:12,820 --> 01:41:13,700
That'd be funny.

1944
01:41:13,700 --> 01:41:14,020
Yeah.

1945
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:15,540
Oh, that would be funny.

1946
01:41:15,540 --> 01:41:20,340
Um, Oh, S2100 Matt says, I mean, wins game of the year at the game awards.

1947
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:21,540
Oh, okay.

1948
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:22,260
That would be funny.

1949
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:22,500
Okay.

1950
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:23,140
I'm with you there.

1951
01:41:24,020 --> 01:41:26,260
Um, that'll be interesting.

1952
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:27,140
Uh, yeah.

1953
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:31,300
Orange right in chat says Rob base and DJ easy rock, not available for comment.

1954
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:33,060
I see what you did there for what it's worth.

1955
01:41:34,180 --> 01:41:36,260
All right, moving on.

1956
01:41:36,820 --> 01:41:39,460
It takes two to make Sue somebody, right?

1957
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:42,580
It takes two to really start a fight.

1958
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:43,300
All right.

1959
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:47,860
Um, now I'm going to get sued.

1960
01:41:47,860 --> 01:41:48,180
All right.

1961
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:51,060
As I probably deserve it.

1962
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:51,460
All right.

1963
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:55,780
Um, moving on to, uh, one more story here.

1964
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:58,340
Uh, you guys are too much.

1965
01:41:58,340 --> 01:41:58,900
I'm sorry.

1966
01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:04,020
I have to read this comment from Sia Tabiri who says, but how did the Olson twins who

1967
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:04,980
starred in the movie?

1968
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:07,540
It takes to feel about the situation.

1969
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:10,820
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1970
01:42:10,820 --> 01:42:11,780
My reaction.

1971
01:42:11,780 --> 01:42:12,500
Exactly.

1972
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:18,900
I'm sorry, but I'm giving Sia Tabiri the gold star comment of the night award.

1973
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:20,260
Congratulations.

1974
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:23,780
You win 50 internets.

1975
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:24,100
Yes.

1976
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:25,460
You win points.

1977
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:28,020
You win internet points worth nothing.

1978
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:28,500
You know what?

1979
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:34,580
I have some Travis Donovan space bucks that fell from his station when, um, he, uh, closed

1980
01:42:34,580 --> 01:42:35,620
under station life.

1981
01:42:35,620 --> 01:42:38,100
So I have some Travis Donovan fun bucks for you.

1982
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:39,620
Sia Tabiri, please enjoy.

1983
01:42:40,980 --> 01:42:41,460
All right.

1984
01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:44,180
I'm the fan of the no prize.

1985
01:42:45,620 --> 01:42:48,660
The old, uh, no prize that Marvel did.

1986
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:49,620
Right.

1987
01:42:51,060 --> 01:42:51,540
All right.

1988
01:42:51,540 --> 01:42:58,260
Uh, Hey, this is a prize and a real tweet, uh, tweet treat, uh, for those that, uh, bought

1989
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:02,580
quake when it was re-released, you know, that remaster that they put out recently, uh, on

1990
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:03,220
PC.

1991
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:05,700
And I know it's on Xbox and all that good stuff.

1992
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:10,820
Um, this was back in August when they released it, even the switch got this and now this

1993
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:11,540
is pretty cool.

1994
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:15,380
They have updated quake a 25 year old game.

1995
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:17,940
They've gone, but not just the remaster, but now they've updated it.

1996
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:21,140
There is a new co-op hoard mode.

1997
01:43:21,140 --> 01:43:22,260
So that's kind of cool.

1998
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:23,940
So yeah, now you can do a little more.

1999
01:43:23,940 --> 01:43:24,180
Yeah.

2000
01:43:24,180 --> 01:43:25,940
Like PVE type of thing in the game.

2001
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:26,660
So that's cool.

2002
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:29,620
And there's new maps that they're putting in and another campaign.

2003
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:33,380
And of course, bug fixes because who doesn't love bug fixes.

2004
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:34,740
So that's great.

2005
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:36,180
And this just came out this last week.

2006
01:43:36,180 --> 01:43:40,740
It's update two for quake, uh, machine games built the hoard mode.

2007
01:43:40,740 --> 01:43:44,020
And, uh, this is the studio that was behind the Wolfenstein revivals.

2008
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:49,380
You can play this by yourself or up to three friends, and there are four new maps to support

2009
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:50,100
the role.

2010
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:51,620
So that's, that's great.

2011
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:54,900
There's also one more expansion called honey.

2012
01:43:54,900 --> 01:44:00,020
It's a dark and creepy underground town, uh, with more secrets, more enemies, you know,

2013
01:44:00,020 --> 01:44:03,220
typical quake stuff, shoot it in the face, et cetera, et cetera.

2014
01:44:03,220 --> 01:44:07,460
I, I, I'm a fan of the quake remaster, but I have really fond memories of the original

2015
01:44:07,460 --> 01:44:13,540
to go back to, uh, playing that over the internet, uh, via modem when I was in the college dorms.

2016
01:44:13,540 --> 01:44:14,900
So it's pretty awesome.

2017
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:20,740
Dr. Suya says it's been a little while since I've been on quake.

2018
01:44:20,740 --> 01:44:21,940
So might need to fire it up again.

2019
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:26,340
I remember the original team fortress, not the fortress two, but the OG team fortress,

2020
01:44:26,340 --> 01:44:31,620
which was a quake mod, because that's where valve got a lot of their people were the modding

2021
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:32,100
community.

2022
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:33,060
That's where Dota came.

2023
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:34,260
Dota two came from as well.

2024
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:35,300
It was a Warcraft three mod.

2025
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:36,660
One thing valve is really good at.

2026
01:44:37,220 --> 01:44:37,860
Yeah.

2027
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:39,860
I wonder why they stopped doing that.

2028
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:40,260
All right.

2029
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:44,100
Anyway, um, that was it.

2030
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:46,500
That was the last story I had slotted for tonight.

2031
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:48,020
So we're going to get to the listener round table.

2032
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:49,860
We're going to take your questions and chat.

2033
01:44:49,860 --> 01:44:54,340
We're also going to welcome your calls in the green room over at, uh, I almost said

2034
01:44:54,340 --> 01:44:55,940
twitch.tv slash vog network.

2035
01:44:55,940 --> 01:45:00,740
Well, that's the place to send questions too, but also at vog network.com slash discord.

2036
01:45:00,740 --> 01:45:04,340
You can join our discord community and we get sent stories throughout the week, which

2037
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:04,980
is really cool.

2038
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:07,140
And then you can chat about the shows.

2039
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:09,860
Uh, we, we, the hosts check in once in a while too.

2040
01:45:09,860 --> 01:45:11,540
You can send things to us.

2041
01:45:11,540 --> 01:45:17,620
I got sent earlier today, a Ninja turtles cross golden girls fanfic shirt or something

2042
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:21,780
that, uh, it was because I am a golden girl fan, uh, at heart.

2043
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:25,700
My only concern is that the golden girls are like literally everywhere at this point.

2044
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:27,860
And it's almost, it's almost becoming too much.

2045
01:45:27,860 --> 01:45:28,660
I just, you know what?

2046
01:45:28,660 --> 01:45:32,820
I like reruns on TV or Hulu or whatever.

2047
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:34,260
That's where I like my golden girls.

2048
01:45:34,820 --> 01:45:35,220
Anyway.

2049
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:39,780
Um, let's get to the mailbag, participate at orange long trader.com.

2050
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:44,020
If you want to send us an email, uh, I think we had at least one when I went to just one.

2051
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:44,500
All right.

2052
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:44,900
Go forward.

2053
01:45:45,780 --> 01:45:53,620
So, um, the one email we have, dear Rob, first off, you're, you're a wonderful human being

2054
01:45:53,620 --> 01:45:57,140
and you have brought thousands of hours of happiness to my life through the power of

2055
01:45:57,140 --> 01:45:58,260
this podcast.

2056
01:45:58,260 --> 01:46:07,620
However, however, Rob, I got something to say, please do not assume that people wouldn't

2057
01:46:07,620 --> 01:46:11,140
be upset if Square Enix botched your remake of chrono cross.

2058
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:14,340
That game to me is what chrono trigger is to you and others.

2059
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:18,500
It told a heart-wrenching story that had me in tears within the first hour.

2060
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:22,260
Those characters, that irreplaceable soundtrack, the unique battle system.

2061
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:23,220
It's fucking great.

2062
01:46:23,780 --> 01:46:27,380
I typed this email while on a late night walk outside on my phone.

2063
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:29,780
So I apologize for any grammatical mistakes.

2064
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:30,660
You were fine.

2065
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:36,580
I just had to respond to that comment when I heard it with love for the OLR fan, Garth

2066
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:37,060
Wolf.

2067
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:43,060
All I have to say is there's, there's always gotta be that guy.

2068
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:44,580
Congratulations.

2069
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:47,220
But what about this?

2070
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:48,260
No, I, I get it.

2071
01:46:48,260 --> 01:46:49,940
Look, your, your feelings are valid.

2072
01:46:49,940 --> 01:46:55,940
Certainly everybody has interesting emotional connections to games that maybe not everybody

2073
01:46:55,940 --> 01:46:57,220
else feels the same way too.

2074
01:46:57,220 --> 01:47:01,140
Like, you know, we never shut up about the guardian legend and how amazing that game

2075
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:04,100
is and how we'd love to revisit it if done right someday.

2076
01:47:04,980 --> 01:47:07,860
But the reality is a lot of people don't know about that game.

2077
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:11,060
And so if they never came out with one, a lot of people would probably be none the wiser.

2078
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:17,060
Um, but sure, uh, with Chrono Cross, of course there were people that played it and really,

2079
01:47:17,060 --> 01:47:19,860
really, especially, and I think a lot of it might have to do with your age too.

2080
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:25,300
Like, uh, you know, Bobby's said this before and I tend to agree with it that your favorite

2081
01:47:25,300 --> 01:47:28,580
Final Fantasy game is probably the one that was out when you were 12.

2082
01:47:29,380 --> 01:47:34,340
Um, and for me, that was probably around Final Fantasy four, maybe technically probably two

2083
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:36,740
and three in Japan, but probably about Final Fantasy four.

2084
01:47:36,740 --> 01:47:41,700
And yeah, that probably, I don't know, Final Fantasy six has aged so well, but I would

2085
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:42,900
say four is definitely up there.

2086
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:45,060
I probably like four more than most people do.

2087
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:46,580
And I think there's something to that.

2088
01:47:46,580 --> 01:47:51,940
And I would bet you were probably knowing your age, you were probably around 12 when

2089
01:47:51,940 --> 01:47:53,140
Chrono Cross came out.

2090
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:58,100
And so that game probably has a lot of meaning to you just because of that particular moment

2091
01:47:58,100 --> 01:47:58,900
in your life.

2092
01:47:58,900 --> 01:48:02,980
And nothing some asshole says on a podcast is ever going to ruin that.

2093
01:48:02,980 --> 01:48:04,020
Remember that.

2094
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:06,100
So, you know, treasure those memories.

2095
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:11,700
But Dark Sakura will ruin you if you, if you deserve it.

2096
01:48:12,980 --> 01:48:14,180
I will ruin a bitch.

2097
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:16,340
I'm good at that too.

2098
01:48:16,340 --> 01:48:17,140
All right.

2099
01:48:17,140 --> 01:48:18,180
Thank you for the email though.

2100
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:19,140
Especially the first part.

2101
01:48:19,780 --> 01:48:20,260
All right.

2102
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:20,900
Appreciate it.

2103
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:26,020
Again, if you want to send us an email, participate at orange laundry.com is the place to send

2104
01:48:26,020 --> 01:48:26,900
an email.

2105
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:30,020
I see a dear friend of the show has stepped into the green room.

2106
01:48:30,020 --> 01:48:34,100
I know we want to get some last minute stories from Loki here, if there are any first.

2107
01:48:34,100 --> 01:48:35,060
Okay, well, great.

2108
01:48:35,060 --> 01:48:35,700
Well, then good.

2109
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:37,220
We have extra time for calls.

2110
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:39,700
So let's get to, uh, some calls.

2111
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:40,260
Hello.

2112
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:41,860
You're on orange lounge radio.

2113
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:42,340
Who's this?

2114
01:48:43,140 --> 01:48:45,940
Two episodes in a row of extended conversation with me.

2115
01:48:45,940 --> 01:48:46,820
Are you sick of me yet?

2116
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:47,940
Not at all.

2117
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:48,580
Never.

2118
01:48:48,580 --> 01:48:51,380
And, uh, you know, Jason, you do great work for the show.

2119
01:48:51,380 --> 01:48:56,100
People don't realize I was very late in providing a show content tonight because I was out doing

2120
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:56,340
stuff.

2121
01:48:56,340 --> 01:49:00,180
I was walking and stuff, you know, my health comes first, but no, seriously, like Jason

2122
01:49:00,180 --> 01:49:02,100
put together tonight's intro and like 10 minutes.

2123
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:03,060
It was pretty impressive.

2124
01:49:03,060 --> 01:49:03,780
So congrats.

2125
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:04,500
Thank you.

2126
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:08,500
I gotta, I gotta, you know, the, the obvious fallback is that since I can see your folks

2127
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:11,380
preparation as well, I can pick on that.

2128
01:49:11,380 --> 01:49:16,020
Generally, you have all of the stories in there, but it's certainly given that I went

2129
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:21,220
with the, you know, the very meta overview of everything going on and not one particular

2130
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:21,620
story.

2131
01:49:21,620 --> 01:49:23,700
It was a much more, it was a much easier list.

2132
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:27,460
There have been weeks and it's been my fault, not yours.

2133
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:30,820
You provide a great service to the show, but in the past, I'm thinking probably even in

2134
01:49:30,820 --> 01:49:34,980
the pre Twitch days where, um, I would, you, you would do that.

2135
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:38,180
You would pick the show from the article and it wasn't something I show.

2136
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:39,620
Yeah, I remember a couple of times.

2137
01:49:39,620 --> 01:49:42,900
So I would, I would have to just say, Oh, by the way, I want to talk about this during

2138
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:44,980
rapid fire news for reasons.

2139
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:48,180
So all good, all good.

2140
01:49:48,180 --> 01:49:49,060
We all appreciate.

2141
01:49:49,060 --> 01:49:54,980
I love it when you sneak in, you use your intro to sneak in your opinion in that 32nd

2142
01:49:54,980 --> 01:49:58,900
time slot or whatever long, however long the loop is.

2143
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:01,620
Actually, you guys may not, we'll let you peek behind the curtain a little bit.

2144
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:05,220
Jason does have two versions of that intro.

2145
01:50:05,220 --> 01:50:10,260
If I remember right, there's one that has an extra loop of one of the measures in it.

2146
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:13,380
So Jason can have like eight more seconds to say something if he needs it.

2147
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:14,340
Yeah.

2148
01:50:14,340 --> 01:50:19,060
I don't even remember when we put it to use, God, that was like, what, four or five months

2149
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:22,580
ago or something about that, but there was something, yeah, there was something that

2150
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:26,900
I definitely wanted to, I definitely wanted to drill into a lot more apparently.

2151
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:30,180
So it's like, well, music is loopable.

2152
01:50:30,180 --> 01:50:36,100
The composition is very well put together and has a couple key points.

2153
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:37,060
You're very welcome.

2154
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:41,380
Has a couple of key points that are easy to just, you know, move off of and extend.

2155
01:50:41,380 --> 01:50:47,860
And it sounds very natural between a good composition with well-defined breaks and also

2156
01:50:47,860 --> 01:50:53,380
software that makes it stupid easy these days to just, Hey, I want to repeat this section.

2157
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:54,100
Okay.

2158
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:57,220
And there was an, and no disrespect for logic pro right.

2159
01:50:57,220 --> 01:51:02,100
And, and no disrespect to our old intro, because that was given to us by somebody who was going

2160
01:51:02,100 --> 01:51:07,380
to put it on an album at one point and basically couldn't find the right, uh, match for it,

2161
01:51:07,380 --> 01:51:08,820
but thought it made a good bump.

2162
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:11,300
And anyway, gave it to us for the intro for our show.

2163
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:12,500
But, uh, and we loved it.

2164
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:16,740
We used it for over a decade here on the show and shout out to midi head who put that together.

2165
01:51:16,740 --> 01:51:22,980
If he even, if he even makes music anymore, but there was that little time frame in there

2166
01:51:23,620 --> 01:51:27,300
that couldn't be changed because it was just like the music wasn't really loopable or

2167
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:28,020
anything like that.

2168
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:32,820
So, uh, but now with this new one, we have the ability to, if we want to have a longer

2169
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:34,260
intro tonight, we can do that.

2170
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:39,780
The actual video that pans around the studio and also goes on for like two minutes.

2171
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:44,500
So technically if Jason wanted to have like a two minute intro, we could do it, but I'm

2172
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:45,380
careful what you wish for.

2173
01:51:47,380 --> 01:51:51,220
I have, I have thought about things and yeah, you're not wrong.

2174
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:52,260
Be careful what you wish for.

2175
01:51:52,260 --> 01:51:56,340
Some of these days, uh, I, uh, geez, I think it was the last time I was in the studio.

2176
01:51:56,340 --> 01:52:00,580
I made the, I made the joke that one of these days, the intro you're going to get is it

2177
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:06,580
was a colder and stormy night on December 5th in Sacramento, California, when the leaves

2178
01:52:06,580 --> 01:52:07,620
were changing color.

2179
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:07,860
Yeah.

2180
01:52:07,860 --> 01:52:08,580
Anyways.

2181
01:52:08,580 --> 01:52:11,780
Uh, I just, I agree with pod culture for an April fool intro.

2182
01:52:11,780 --> 01:52:14,580
I think you just, you should just start the show in the intro.

2183
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:20,500
Anyway, uh, we can have an extended conversation now though.

2184
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:21,620
What did you want to talk about tonight?

2185
01:52:22,180 --> 01:52:22,420
Yeah.

2186
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:27,460
So I actually wanted to, I wanted, I did want to give an opinion and I wanted to expand

2187
01:52:27,460 --> 01:52:30,980
on the dig that I put in the very, very start of the intro.

2188
01:52:30,980 --> 01:52:36,260
Um, basically like the, the point that I'm making, and I'm gonna explain it a little

2189
01:52:36,260 --> 01:52:37,060
bit more broadly.

2190
01:52:37,060 --> 01:52:39,300
The point I played, should I play the intro again?

2191
01:52:39,940 --> 01:52:42,660
But if you have it on, if you have it on, yeah, absolutely.

2192
01:52:42,660 --> 01:52:43,140
I do.

2193
01:52:43,140 --> 01:52:46,420
I'm just going to warn you actually won't hear it, but the listeners will.

2194
01:52:46,420 --> 01:52:47,780
So I'll tell you when we're on the other side.

2195
01:52:47,780 --> 01:52:48,980
So here's a reminder here.

2196
01:52:49,380 --> 01:52:50,100
Oh my God.

2197
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:51,380
The show's starting over.

2198
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:51,620
No.

2199
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:04,900
It's another week and another groundswell launch with rampant service issues.

2200
01:53:04,900 --> 01:53:09,300
But in actual news, tonight's topics are an interesting mix of massive universe, mashups,

2201
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:13,060
ongoing social sagas, new release, strife, remasters, and rereleases, and a couple of

2202
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:13,620
glitches.

2203
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:17,300
It's a cornucopia of potpourri, a cavalcade of conundrums and video games.

2204
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:19,140
The things we hold near and dear to our hearts.

2205
01:53:20,340 --> 01:53:23,860
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to bring you details

2206
01:53:23,860 --> 01:53:24,740
of all this and more.

2207
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:26,980
Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

2208
01:53:28,580 --> 01:53:29,460
All right, there you go.

2209
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:31,780
Hello, everybody out there on the internet.

2210
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:35,780
And I'm going to, I'm going to let this video keep playing so you can see how long it is

2211
01:53:35,780 --> 01:53:36,900
while Jason gives his thoughts.

2212
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:37,780
So there's the intro.

2213
01:53:39,460 --> 01:53:43,060
Groundswell launch was my two big words.

2214
01:53:43,060 --> 01:53:46,660
What were the two big words also saying that like, this isn't news.

2215
01:53:46,660 --> 01:53:50,500
Because it's not, you know, every multiplayer launch.

2216
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:51,540
Diablo 3.

2217
01:53:52,580 --> 01:53:55,380
I mean, I guess No Man's Sky wasn't exactly live multiplayer.

2218
01:53:55,380 --> 01:53:58,100
I don't remember them having server issues at launch.

2219
01:53:58,100 --> 01:54:02,500
But like this, and I said this, you read out the comment when I said it when we were talking

2220
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:03,620
in the intro in chat.

2221
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:06,820
This problem will not be solved.

2222
01:54:06,820 --> 01:54:07,300
Period.

2223
01:54:07,300 --> 01:54:08,260
It is not going to be.

2224
01:54:08,260 --> 01:54:10,820
Like there's always going to be a reason given for it.

2225
01:54:10,820 --> 01:54:11,860
You had your opinion.

2226
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:16,740
Yoshi P had Yoshi T.

2227
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:18,660
Yoshi P right.

2228
01:54:18,660 --> 01:54:19,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2229
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:24,340
He had his opinion about the supply chain aspect of it, which is true.

2230
01:54:24,340 --> 01:54:27,060
But it doesn't explain why every other one in the past is hard.

2231
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:29,300
Scaling is hard.

2232
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:30,500
I mean, look at Twitter.

2233
01:54:31,140 --> 01:54:36,500
The fail whale was such a prominent thing in history because scale is hard.

2234
01:54:37,140 --> 01:54:44,420
Yeah, like you can you can point to any service growing up or just launching this is what

2235
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:47,300
Final Fantasy 14 fifth expansion.

2236
01:54:47,860 --> 01:54:53,060
It depends if you count Realm Reborn as an expansion or the base game.

2237
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:54,180
Well, it's true.

2238
01:54:54,900 --> 01:54:56,820
I consider Realm Reborn the base game.

2239
01:54:57,380 --> 01:54:59,940
Because that is what everything else is built on now.

2240
01:54:59,940 --> 01:55:04,340
But anyway, computing follows human analogs.

2241
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:05,860
Computing is not different.

2242
01:55:05,860 --> 01:55:06,820
It's just another medium.

2243
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:11,700
I've talked about social networks in the past and Facebook is having all of these social

2244
01:55:11,700 --> 01:55:16,100
problems because of the large public town square problem that every single community

2245
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:16,500
happens.

2246
01:55:17,540 --> 01:55:18,740
Final Fantasy 14.

2247
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:20,900
Picture it as a mall.

2248
01:55:21,460 --> 01:55:26,660
It has tons of entrances to individual stores, to general common areas.

2249
01:55:26,660 --> 01:55:28,340
When does it suck the most?

2250
01:55:29,540 --> 01:55:31,860
Black Friday and December 24th.

2251
01:55:31,860 --> 01:55:38,180
And all of the summer days when the kids can just come in at will, you know, like every

2252
01:55:38,180 --> 01:55:40,900
critical mass is difficult everywhere.

2253
01:55:40,900 --> 01:55:43,700
These problems will not go away.

2254
01:55:43,700 --> 01:55:47,380
And if they are like it's going to it's going to fucking bankrupt the company that finally

2255
01:55:47,380 --> 01:55:51,300
doesn't write because they're going to be so severely over provisioned that, you know,

2256
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:56,980
they're going to blow they're going to blow all their profit and then some because and

2257
01:55:56,980 --> 01:56:02,740
if it's and even even if they over provision, especially in computing, even if Square Enix

2258
01:56:02,740 --> 01:56:09,700
set up three more data centers filled with 500 more servers to do everything.

2259
01:56:09,700 --> 01:56:12,580
Some other component in the middle is going to break down.

2260
01:56:12,580 --> 01:56:16,740
DNS is going to break and some some players aren't going to be able to connect.

2261
01:56:16,740 --> 01:56:21,060
Interconnection is going to is going to break between data servers and some segment of players

2262
01:56:21,060 --> 01:56:21,860
are going to get dropped off.

2263
01:56:21,860 --> 01:56:26,100
Some servers are going to go down like these are not solved problems.

2264
01:56:26,100 --> 01:56:31,300
Servers a service is a mall service is the stores.

2265
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:37,700
You have everybody jamming into a single store and they have to queue up to pay for their

2266
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:43,460
items and you have, you know, one or few cash registers that everybody has to go through.

2267
01:56:43,460 --> 01:56:47,220
Some people leave because they have time commitments and they didn't anticipate the line.

2268
01:56:47,220 --> 01:56:51,620
You have rabble rousers that's put the put the line to a stop because they complain incessantly

2269
01:56:51,620 --> 01:56:54,420
about everything and all the other people immediately after.

2270
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:57,060
Well, I'm just not going to be around for the conflict, so they peace out.

2271
01:56:59,220 --> 01:57:02,340
There are too many things that happen down in the weeds.

2272
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:08,340
That means that this can just be solved by just, oh, let's just have three more stores

2273
01:57:08,340 --> 01:57:09,860
in the mall that are all Macy's.

2274
01:57:09,860 --> 01:57:10,980
That's probably a bad example.

2275
01:57:10,980 --> 01:57:12,500
How how relevant is Macy's?

2276
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:16,340
Let's let's have the dial turn up the graphics on level three, right?

2277
01:57:16,340 --> 01:57:20,500
That doesn't fix it for for every possible reason.

2278
01:57:20,740 --> 01:57:26,420
So like it's a I don't have an answer this because like I said, my answer is that it's

2279
01:57:26,420 --> 01:57:27,700
not it's non-resolvable.

2280
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:33,380
These are things we deal with at scale in excess and it is a fact of life.

2281
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:34,180
What does that mean?

2282
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:40,020
That means you get in on day one and have a subpar experience or don't get in on day

2283
01:57:40,020 --> 01:57:46,820
one and let the traffic die down, which is the solution in all cases unless they do so

2284
01:57:46,820 --> 01:57:49,540
that the company does something critically wrong and just folds up to that point.

2285
01:57:49,540 --> 01:57:52,500
But this is this will not be a solved problem ever.

2286
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:58,900
And if it is, they lied about thousands of people beating down the front door when it

2287
01:57:58,900 --> 01:58:01,220
was maybe 50 that they had to cater to.

2288
01:58:01,220 --> 01:58:04,180
Like that's I do not see a third option.

2289
01:58:04,180 --> 01:58:05,620
That is the way I see it.

2290
01:58:05,620 --> 01:58:10,340
They lie about the demand or it or you will have problems.

2291
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:11,140
Period.

2292
01:58:11,140 --> 01:58:11,640
Yeah.

2293
01:58:12,340 --> 01:58:12,500
Yeah.

2294
01:58:12,500 --> 01:58:15,380
And Zen Monkey 11 in chat says it will be solved with more servers.

2295
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:20,100
And I think that that is but then it's funny because then when you put then you get Wow's

2296
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:24,100
problem, you have too many servers, then the population starts dying and the servers feel

2297
01:58:24,100 --> 01:58:24,580
empty.

2298
01:58:24,580 --> 01:58:29,460
Now Wow did a really smart thing with the whole like cross server thing that is so seamless

2299
01:58:29,460 --> 01:58:32,020
in that game, which Final Fantasy 14 has really struggled with.

2300
01:58:32,020 --> 01:58:36,660
Like they're just now getting to data center travel, hopefully in 6.1.

2301
01:58:36,660 --> 01:58:40,420
But after this whole mess, I would not be surprised if that gets put off a little bit

2302
01:58:40,420 --> 01:58:42,180
because here's something that's very interesting.

2303
01:58:42,180 --> 01:58:47,940
And they were touting this feature that was supposed to be in the 6.0 thing that within

2304
01:58:47,940 --> 01:58:53,700
your data center, you could automatically queue for the world with the lowest pop with

2305
01:58:53,700 --> 01:58:56,340
the lowest queue, lowest line to get in.

2306
01:58:56,340 --> 01:58:58,100
But here's the hilarious part.

2307
01:58:58,100 --> 01:59:02,900
That feature doesn't work right now because when it consistently tries to load your character

2308
01:59:02,900 --> 01:59:08,340
data, which is needed for that future feature, it keeps timing out because there are literally

2309
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:12,100
like everybody else requesting their player data.

2310
01:59:12,740 --> 01:59:15,940
And that's exactly my point of these auxiliary things.

2311
01:59:15,940 --> 01:59:22,580
Like the DNS system has to work out the centralized storage of something that spans multiple stores

2312
01:59:22,580 --> 01:59:31,060
like iPhone launches, you know, new phone launches, like those all boil down to physical

2313
01:59:31,060 --> 01:59:36,660
stock and what, you know, three large tier providers and maybe all of these other little

2314
01:59:36,660 --> 01:59:42,740
offshoots, US Cellular and I mean, Ting is just a sub to Verizon and all that kind of

2315
01:59:42,740 --> 01:59:42,820
thing.

2316
01:59:42,820 --> 01:59:45,060
How about a fucking PlayStation 5?

2317
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:46,980
Why don't we just use that as an example?

2318
01:59:46,980 --> 01:59:49,620
I still can't get one, you know, like.

2319
01:59:51,220 --> 01:59:51,620
Yeah.

2320
01:59:51,620 --> 01:59:55,220
And that's, I don't want to draw that comparison.

2321
01:59:56,020 --> 02:00:00,500
I mean, I do because it's not like, yes, digital is digital and you can just copy and paste

2322
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:03,460
infinitely, but those all take storage somewhere.

2323
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:04,740
Those all take bandwidth.

2324
02:00:04,740 --> 02:00:06,660
That all takes routing power.

2325
02:00:07,380 --> 02:00:09,780
Yeah, it is not ultimately all that different.

2326
02:00:09,780 --> 02:00:10,820
Common denominator.

2327
02:00:10,820 --> 02:00:11,140
Yeah.

2328
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:16,900
Is that the superconductor shortage is screwing the PlayStation 5 and the superconductor shortage

2329
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:22,340
screwed the contingency plans that, you know, to basically turn up the graphics and turn

2330
02:00:22,340 --> 02:00:24,740
up the server space that they had in place.

2331
02:00:24,740 --> 02:00:28,660
So basically gaming is fucked right now because a crypto coin.

2332
02:00:30,580 --> 02:00:32,420
That is all true for this year.

2333
02:00:32,420 --> 02:00:34,580
It's going to happen on Final Fantasy.

2334
02:00:35,940 --> 02:00:39,060
Let's call it 17 or the next or the next expansion.

2335
02:00:39,060 --> 02:00:45,060
Like it's going to happen again, even with society getting back to a, you know, surplus

2336
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:49,700
possible situation because it happened in all years prior to coin mining and everything

2337
02:00:49,700 --> 02:00:51,540
else like scaling.

2338
02:00:51,540 --> 02:00:57,060
Scaling is hard for everyone ever always, period.

2339
02:00:57,060 --> 02:00:59,700
There is no ifs, ands or buts about it.

2340
02:00:59,700 --> 02:01:05,700
This is, I have this thing that I say whenever I can distill it down this concretely.

2341
02:01:05,700 --> 02:01:12,020
Technology doesn't fix social problems and scaling is a social problem.

2342
02:01:12,020 --> 02:01:14,420
It's just in the service and technical world.

2343
02:01:14,420 --> 02:01:19,780
It's very highly a technological problem, but it underpins people, society and social

2344
02:01:19,780 --> 02:01:20,500
events.

2345
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:22,420
Technology does not fix social problems.

2346
02:01:22,420 --> 02:01:24,660
These are evergreen problems.

2347
02:01:24,660 --> 02:01:26,100
They will not be resolved.

2348
02:01:26,100 --> 02:01:27,620
And what does that mean?

2349
02:01:27,620 --> 02:01:34,660
That means that we're going to complain and suffer and we will perpetually have to deal

2350
02:01:34,660 --> 02:01:35,140
with it.

2351
02:01:35,140 --> 02:01:38,180
And, you know, I'm not saying don't have the conversation about it.

2352
02:01:38,180 --> 02:01:40,420
I'm just saying don't be surprised by it.

2353
02:01:40,420 --> 02:01:44,820
Zen Monkey 11 in chat says they can also solve it for the time being by giving every player

2354
02:01:44,820 --> 02:01:48,980
or server a set play time, like a two hour long log or whatever.

2355
02:01:48,980 --> 02:01:50,100
Then they log you out.

2356
02:01:50,100 --> 02:01:52,020
You know, there's that noise.

2357
02:01:52,020 --> 02:01:53,860
Yeah, there's a part of that I get.

2358
02:01:53,860 --> 02:01:57,140
But at the same time, like what if you're in the middle of an instance playing with

2359
02:01:57,220 --> 02:01:59,620
other people when you hit your two hours is up, you know?

2360
02:01:59,620 --> 02:02:03,140
And what if the timer starts when you queue and not when you actually start playing?

2361
02:02:03,140 --> 02:02:03,780
Whoops.

2362
02:02:03,780 --> 02:02:06,180
There'd be a lot of like I get that solution.

2363
02:02:06,180 --> 02:02:08,100
It does seem like on paper that's a good way to do it.

2364
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:12,660
But I just think in practice, it's going to cause even more frustration and that whole

2365
02:02:12,660 --> 02:02:13,540
type of thing.

2366
02:02:13,540 --> 02:02:19,620
I really think the answer here and I think what Yoshi P and Square need to take a good

2367
02:02:19,620 --> 02:02:20,100
look at.

2368
02:02:20,740 --> 02:02:23,620
Is it a good idea to release so much content at once?

2369
02:02:24,340 --> 02:02:29,860
And I think maybe I know that is such a weird thing that I'm saying, but maybe the answer

2370
02:02:29,860 --> 02:02:31,300
is maybe they should.

2371
02:02:31,300 --> 02:02:34,180
That's why that's why I'm saying delay the raid.

2372
02:02:34,180 --> 02:02:38,900
Do not add to this issue by making people feel like they got a gun so fast to get to

2373
02:02:38,900 --> 02:02:40,180
that raid and all this stuff.

2374
02:02:40,180 --> 02:02:44,820
I think if they had, you know, I said earlier, they probably should have delayed Endwalker

2375
02:02:44,820 --> 02:02:45,540
again.

2376
02:02:45,540 --> 02:02:49,220
But you know what they could have done that might have helped a little bit with this?

2377
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:53,300
And maybe if as they're sitting down looking at their lessons learned, what if they had

2378
02:02:53,300 --> 02:02:57,860
released the new jobs Reaper and Sage on Friday?

2379
02:02:58,660 --> 02:03:00,580
And then you know what?

2380
02:03:00,580 --> 02:03:02,420
We'll release the story in January.

2381
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:07,380
It's just about the people like that may that may have softened.

2382
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:10,260
Anything can soften the blue.

2383
02:03:10,260 --> 02:03:14,100
Anything can soften the blow and incremental solutions should be possible, but it's not

2384
02:03:14,100 --> 02:03:15,380
going to fix it.

2385
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:22,660
Rocket League, Rocket League's season five under Epic just started two weeks ago.

2386
02:03:22,740 --> 02:03:28,500
And like the skill level at the start of the season is completely different than the skill

2387
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:29,940
level at the end of the season.

2388
02:03:29,940 --> 02:03:38,340
The queuing times for matches, despite a despite a healthier population to match make against

2389
02:03:38,340 --> 02:03:43,700
is a little bit slower because of the higher levels of communication and arrangement that

2390
02:03:43,700 --> 02:03:44,340
has to happen.

2391
02:03:45,700 --> 02:03:48,820
You know, like you're going to go into the first game you get, but when there's so many

2392
02:03:48,820 --> 02:03:53,700
more queuing at the same time, first come first serve, the line is longer.

2393
02:03:53,700 --> 02:03:55,860
So it takes a little bit longer.

2394
02:03:55,860 --> 02:03:59,060
Granted, that means I'm waiting like five or 10 more seconds.

2395
02:03:59,060 --> 02:04:04,020
I'm not complaining for Rocket League capacity at all by comparison.

2396
02:04:04,020 --> 02:04:12,820
But like I am in favor of optimizations because that is what it always will be.

2397
02:04:13,380 --> 02:04:14,660
Like I said, don't stop.

2398
02:04:14,660 --> 02:04:16,340
Don't stop attempting to improve.

2399
02:04:16,340 --> 02:04:16,980
Don't stop.

2400
02:04:17,620 --> 02:04:19,060
Don't stop talking about it.

2401
02:04:19,060 --> 02:04:23,700
Like I'm not the don't don't don't avoid chasing the solution.

2402
02:04:24,260 --> 02:04:26,020
Just don't be surprised by it.

2403
02:04:26,020 --> 02:04:30,260
It's going to be quite a day and probably a lie when somebody says that they prevented

2404
02:04:30,980 --> 02:04:32,660
these launch catastrophes.

2405
02:04:32,660 --> 02:04:32,900
Yeah.

2406
02:04:32,900 --> 02:04:38,420
And honestly, like I'm sure Yoshi P and his team are looking for that solution, but until

2407
02:04:38,420 --> 02:04:41,060
they find it, they're going to have to keep doling out free game time.

2408
02:04:41,620 --> 02:04:42,260
Let's be real.

2409
02:04:42,820 --> 02:04:43,780
Let's call it like it is.

2410
02:04:44,340 --> 02:04:47,380
The frontline developers are doing all of that work.

2411
02:04:47,380 --> 02:04:52,900
And Yoshi P is, you know, finagling leadership.

2412
02:04:52,900 --> 02:04:53,940
Leadership is leading.

2413
02:04:53,940 --> 02:04:55,380
Frontline developers are doing.

2414
02:04:56,340 --> 02:05:02,260
But yes, yes, the team is absolutely doing everything they can within reasonable human

2415
02:05:02,260 --> 02:05:07,220
capacity and waking hours and energy and mind actually functioning appropriately.

2416
02:05:07,220 --> 02:05:11,860
There is an element of this, though, where I think Yoshi P and really Square, and this

2417
02:05:11,860 --> 02:05:15,220
would go outside the frontline developers, is really try to address this question.

2418
02:05:15,220 --> 02:05:18,260
Where can we get the servers without the superconductors?

2419
02:05:18,260 --> 02:05:23,540
Like and I this is ridiculous, and I wouldn't say they actually do this, but can we pull

2420
02:05:23,540 --> 02:05:28,740
Final Fantasy 11 servers and make them 14 servers to handle this load?

2421
02:05:28,740 --> 02:05:29,780
Now, obviously, I would.

2422
02:05:29,780 --> 02:05:33,380
And there's folks that play Final Fantasy 11 that would it would stab me if I said that

2423
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:35,060
with seriousness.

2424
02:05:35,060 --> 02:05:41,460
But, you know, can we allocate the resources from somewhere else, even if that's Tomb Raider

2425
02:05:41,460 --> 02:05:44,660
or some other game that is under Square's watch?

2426
02:05:44,660 --> 02:05:47,300
Can we allocate those resources to 14 somehow?

2427
02:05:47,300 --> 02:05:48,020
And I don't know.

2428
02:05:48,020 --> 02:05:51,620
Yeah, again, but I think those are the types of questions they have to kind of look at.

2429
02:05:51,620 --> 02:05:54,100
How can we get superconductors if we can't get new ones?

2430
02:05:54,820 --> 02:05:59,860
But by the time they do that, social, you know, demand will probably drop enough that

2431
02:05:59,860 --> 02:06:02,980
it will be less important.

2432
02:06:02,980 --> 02:06:03,700
Yeah.

2433
02:06:03,700 --> 02:06:06,260
A lot of people will have canceled their subscriptions because they're sick of dealing

2434
02:06:06,260 --> 02:06:07,140
with it.

2435
02:06:07,140 --> 02:06:09,220
But if the game is strong enough, they'll come back.

2436
02:06:09,220 --> 02:06:09,720
We'll see.

2437
02:06:10,280 --> 02:06:10,780
Yeah.

2438
02:06:11,080 --> 02:06:13,160
Jason, I really appreciate the perspective, of course.

2439
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:15,080
Thank you for calling in.

2440
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:15,720
Appreciate it.

2441
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:16,280
Anything else?

2442
02:06:16,280 --> 02:06:17,720
Anything else on your mind before we let you go?

2443
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:18,840
No, sir.

2444
02:06:18,840 --> 02:06:19,960
Enjoy the rest of the night, everyone.

2445
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:23,180
All right.

2446
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:25,880
He cracked up for me a little bit there at the end.

2447
02:06:25,880 --> 02:06:30,040
I don't know if it was just my headphones or whatever, but yeah, a good goodbye and

2448
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:30,840
farewell to Jason.

2449
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:33,000
We'll hear him in the intro for next week.

2450
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:35,160
Let me peek back at the green room.

2451
02:06:35,160 --> 02:06:36,520
OK, I don't see anybody else in there.

2452
02:06:37,160 --> 02:06:39,960
So I think we are about where we can wrap up.

2453
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:42,200
Loki, you said you had no last minute stories, right?

2454
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:42,680
Not at all.

2455
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:45,400
So then I think we can wrap up.

2456
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:48,600
So I want to thank you guys for listening to our show tonight, whether you were watching

2457
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:52,760
us live on Twitch here on Sunday night, or you were checking us out on the podcast feed.

2458
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:56,680
Appreciate you being here, checking us out and being with our show.

2459
02:06:56,680 --> 02:07:00,040
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, help us spread the word because

2460
02:07:00,040 --> 02:07:03,560
we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need the voices here to participate

2461
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:04,200
on air.

2462
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:06,120
So please tell a friend about the show.

2463
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:11,720
A five-star review on a place like iTunes, a social share on Spotify, or wherever it

2464
02:07:11,720 --> 02:07:13,320
is that you listen to the show.

2465
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:14,840
All of it goes a long way.

2466
02:07:14,840 --> 02:07:15,640
Thank you very much.

2467
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:17,720
There is no shop currently.

2468
02:07:17,720 --> 02:07:20,920
It's down for maintenance, but we're hoping to get that resolved relatively soon.

2469
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:24,360
And that is, I think, it for me.

2470
02:07:24,360 --> 02:07:26,840
Join our Discord, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

2471
02:07:26,840 --> 02:07:29,240
Let's go around and get everybody's final, final thought.

2472
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:34,360
I will start with DarkSakura as I know she's going to get ready for her post-party here

2473
02:07:34,360 --> 02:07:35,480
live tonight on Twitch.

2474
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:37,400
That's a good way to phrase it.

2475
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:40,200
I don't really have anything.

2476
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:43,880
I'm kind of in meh mode for right now.

2477
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:49,960
So tune in, see what happens on stuff.

2478
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:53,000
Watch me break down live on the internet and everything's good.

2479
02:07:53,640 --> 02:07:55,800
We'll feel better and hang in there, DarkSakura.

2480
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:56,760
I feel all right.

2481
02:07:56,760 --> 02:07:57,480
All right.

2482
02:07:57,480 --> 02:07:58,040
Have a great night.

2483
02:07:58,040 --> 02:07:59,080
We'll talk to you next week.

2484
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:00,520
Later, Tater.

2485
02:08:00,520 --> 02:08:01,000
All right.

2486
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:02,280
And we will go to Loki.

2487
02:08:02,280 --> 02:08:03,240
Your final thought tonight.

2488
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:09,240
My final thought is I hope our season two of NerdCraft gets started here pretty soon.

2489
02:08:09,240 --> 02:08:11,560
It's just waiting on the Ram to arrive.

2490
02:08:12,440 --> 02:08:13,640
It's a long wait.

2491
02:08:15,560 --> 02:08:19,320
I'm just, I'm very much anticipating that getting started soon.

2492
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:26,600
And my final thought is I'm seeing a lot of positive changes from everything I've had

2493
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:29,640
to change in my life with everything that happened a month ago.

2494
02:08:30,680 --> 02:08:35,880
And yeah, my weight loss is starting to show up on the scale, which I like.

2495
02:08:36,600 --> 02:08:41,000
Not that you should let your weight define you, but the reality is I'm gonna have to

2496
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:44,440
lose a little bit if I want to get around everything that's kind of happened lately.

2497
02:08:44,440 --> 02:08:48,280
So it's very nice that things are moving in that positive direction.

2498
02:08:48,280 --> 02:08:49,320
I'm very happy about it.

2499
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:50,600
So cross your fingers.

2500
02:08:50,600 --> 02:08:52,040
I can keep it going for another couple months.

2501
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:53,000
It'd be great.

2502
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:58,200
So hopefully someday a skinny legend again, like I was when I was 18.

2503
02:08:58,840 --> 02:08:59,240
All right.

2504
02:09:00,120 --> 02:09:02,680
But being a little twunk is okay too.

2505
02:09:02,680 --> 02:09:04,440
I have a good night, everybody.

2506
02:09:05,080 --> 02:09:07,160
We'll see you next time for more Orange Launch Radio.

2507
02:09:07,160 --> 02:09:10,520
We'll be back in seven days to talk about the game awards this week.

2508
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:13,960
I'm sure there's going to be a lot of stuff and reveals we'll want to talk about.

2509
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:19,320
Maybe some surprises, whether that be reveals or something someone does or says at the show.

2510
02:09:19,320 --> 02:09:21,800
We'll talk about all that and whatever else comes up in the news.

2511
02:09:21,880 --> 02:09:25,720
And I hope to God our lead story next week is Bobby Kotick's resignation.

2512
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:27,880
But if it's not, we'll keep asking for it.

2513
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:29,960
So we'll be here next week to do it all again.

2514
02:09:29,960 --> 02:09:30,680
Happy gaming.

2515
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:33,320
May the odds be ever in your favor.

2516
02:09:33,320 --> 02:09:36,760
If you're battling the Q's and Final Fantasy 14, I hope you're having a lot of fun.

2517
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:40,040
Even if you're playing a classic like Minecraft or whatever it is you're playing.

2518
02:09:40,040 --> 02:09:40,840
Happy gaming.

2519
02:09:41,880 --> 02:09:43,320
Enjoy the holidays, everybody.

2520
02:09:43,320 --> 02:09:45,560
We'll see you next week here on Orange Launch Radio.

2521
02:09:45,560 --> 02:09:46,360
